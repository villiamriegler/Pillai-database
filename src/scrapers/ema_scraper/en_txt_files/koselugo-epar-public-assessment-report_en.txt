1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant AstraZeneca AB submitted on 6 March 2020  an application for marketing authorisation  to 
the European Medicines Agency (EMA)  for Koselugo, through the centralised procedure falling within 
the Article 3(1) and point  4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No  726/2004.  The eligibility to the centralised 
procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP  on 15 November 2018. 
Koselugo, was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/18/2050  on 31 July 2018  in the 
following condition:  treatment of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). 
Following  the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan 
Medicinal Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Koselugo as an orphan medicinal product in  the 
approved indication. More information on the COMP’s review can be found in the  Orphan maintenance 
assessment report published under the ‘Assessment history’ tab on the Agency’s website: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/koselugo.  
The applicant applied for the following indication:  Koselugo is indicated for the  treatment of paediatric 
patients aged 3 years and above, with  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)  and symptomatic, inoperable 
plexiform neurofibromas (PN). 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC  - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting  certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006,  the application included an EMA Decision on 
the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0279/2019  was not  yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000  and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000,  the applicant  did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
Applicant’s request(s) for consideration 
Conditional marketing authorisation  
The applicant applied for a full marketing authorisation,  but during the assessment, in response to 
CHMP  concerns on the comprehensiveness of the data, requested consideration of its application for a 
Conditional marketing authorisation in accordance with Article 14-a of the above mentioned 
Assessment report  
EMA/549867/2021

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The proposed indication for Koselugo (selumetinib) is: 
Koselugo is indicated for the treatment of paediatric patients  aged 3 years and above, with 
neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)  and symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas (PN). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
NF1  is  a  rare,  autosomal  dominant  genetic  disorder that  is  caused by  germline  mutations  in  the  NF1 
tumour  suppressor  gene  (17q11.2),  which  encodes  the  tumour  suppressor  protein  neurofibromin  1. 
Studies  that  included  both  adult  and  paediatric  populations  reported  prevalence  estimates  of  NF1 
between 20 per 100000 and 24 per 100000  persons (Huson et al. 1989; Poyhonen et al. 2000; Evans et 
al. 2010; Kallionpää et al. 2018), whereas, studies focusing only on paediatric populations or adolescents 
found  slightly  higher  prevalence  estimates  ranging  from  18  per  100000  to  34  per  100000  persons 
(Poyhonen et  al.  2000;  Lammert  et al.  2005;  McKeever et  al. 2008).  Approximately half  of NF1  cases 
are familial, with  penetrance being 100%,  and the  remainder are the  result of  de novo (spontaneous) 
mutations  (Evans et al. 2010).

Page 10/164 
 
 
 
 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Neurofibromin 1 is a guanosine 5' triphosphate (GTP)ase activating protein that promotes the conversion 
of active RasGTP to inactive RAS guanosine 5’-diphosphate, thereby functioning  as a negative regulator 
of the RAS proto oncogene, which  is a key signalling molecule in the control of cell growth (Gutmann et 
al.  2012).  NF1  mutation  that  leads  to  loss  of  function  results  in  a  failure  to  inactivate  RAS.  Affected 
individuals start  life with  1 mutated  (non-functional)  copy and 1  functional  copy of NF1  in  every cell in 
their  body. Although  many of  the  clinical  features of this  syndrome are apparent from birth,  complete 
loss of gene function is needed for formation of tumours (including PN), by acquisition of a somatic NF1 
mutation  in  selected  cells  (Ruggieri  et  al.  2001;  Gutmann  et  al.  2013b).  Patients  with  NF1  have  an 
increased risk of developing tumours of  the central and  peripheral nervous system. PNs are one of the 
most  common  benign  tumours  which  occur  in  approximately  20%  to  50%  of  patients  (Korf.  1999; 
Mautner et al. 2008). 
Malignant  peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNST)  often  arise in  pre-existing PNs  and whilst  MPNSTs 
are  rare  in  the  general  population,  the  lifetime  risk  of  developing  MPNSTs  in  patients  with  NF1  is 
estimated to be 8 to 15.8% (Evans et al. 2002; Nguyen et al. 2011; Uusitalo et al. 2015). The incidence 
of  MPNST  has  been  estimated  to  be  4.6%  in  patients  with  NF1  compared to  0.001%  in  the  general 
population (Ducatman et al. 1986).  Other tumours associated with  NF1  include low grade gliomas, with 
optic  pathway gliomas occurring in ~15%  of  NF1  patients,  as well as malignant  tumours such  as high-
grade  gliomas,  breast  cancer,  leukaemia,  pheochromocytomas and  gastrointestinal  stromal  tumours 
(Gutmann et al. 2017). 
Pathophysiology of NF1-related  plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) 
Neurofibromas are histologically benign nerve sheath tumours, which can be broadly grouped into dermal 
neurofibromas or PNs.  Dermal neurofibromas originate from terminal nerve branches in the  skin, rarely 
developing before puberty, whereas PNs typically grow along large nerves and plexuses and are present 
at  birth  (Hannema  and  Oostenbrink.  2017).  PN  manifestations  vary  and  may  continue  to  become 
apparent through late adolescence and early adulthood (Williams et  al. 2009).  Typical PNs are clinically 
distinct  from localised (or ‘nodular’ or ‘atypical’) neurofibromas in that  they have potential  for malignant 
transformation and  are considered by some to  be  pre-malignant (Gutmann  et  al.  2017;  Higham  et  al. 
2018). 
PNs can have complex shapes and sometimes reach very large size, with  some documented as being 
20% of body weight (Korf. 1999; Mautner  et al. 2008). PNs may develop along nerves anywhere in the 
body, and may be located around the orbit, face, upper and lower limbs, back, thorax, abdomen, neck 
brachial plexus and/or lumbosacral plexus, which result in clinical symptoms such as disfigurement, 
motor dysfunction (weakness and restricted range of motion),  pain, and neurological dysfunction. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis, prognosis 
Diagnosis of NF1 
Due to  the  rarity  of the  disease, the  diagnostic  criteria for  NF1  were  defined at  a  National  Institute  of 
Health  (NIH)  consensus  development  conference  in  1987  (National  Institutes  of  Health  Consensus 
Development Conference, 1987). 
In most cases, the diagnosis of NF1  is  made on clinical  grounds, requiring 2 or more clinical features 
to be present from the defined list of diagnostic criteria for NF1  presented below: 
-  Six  or  more  café-au-lait  macules (diameters  ≥0.5  cm  in  pre-pubertal  patients  or  ≥1.5  cm  in 
post-pubertal patients) 
Assessment report  
EMA/549867/2021

- 
- 
Two or more neurofibromas or 1 PN 
Freckling in axilla or groin 
-  Optic glioma 
- 
Two or more Lisch nodules (iris hamartomas) 
-  A distinctive  bony  lesion (dysplasia of the  sphenoid bone  or dysplasia or thinning  of long  bone 
cortex) 
- 
First-degree relative with  NF1  (diagnosed using the above criteria). 
Genetic testing is performed in rare circumstances and not advocated routinely. 
Growth of PNs  
It has  been observed that  older patients  have slower growing  PNs when compared to younger patients 
(Dombi  et  al.  2007;  Nguyen  et  al.  2012;  Gross  et  al.  2018;  Akshintala  et  al.  2020).  PNs  grow  most 
rapidly  during  the  first  decade of  life  and  whilst  growth  rate  is  highly  variable between  patients,  the 
growth rate of PNs in younger children is generally much greater compared with that in older children or 
adults  (Dombi et  al.  2007;  Tucker et  al.  2009;  Nguyen  et  al. 2012).  It  has been  reported that  the  PN 
growth  rate in children exceeded the  rate of increase in  their body weight  (Dombi et al.  2007)  or body 
mass  index (Tucker  et  al.  2009),  so  the  rapid  tumour  growth  cannot  be  attributed  to  the  anticipated 
growth rate of a child. 
It has also been observed that larger PNs are associated with  slower growth (Akshintala et al. 2020). 
In the  scientific literature the  following median PN growth  rates can be found: +14.3%/year (Dombi et 
al.  2007);  +2.8%/year  (Nguyen  et  al.  2012);  +15.9%/year  (Gross  et  al.  2018);  +12.4%/year 
(Akshintala et al. 2020). 
Spontaneous shrinkage of PNs has been described, but  never exceeding -20%/year (Dombi et al. 2007; 
Nguyen et al. 2012; Akshintala et al. 2020).  For example, Nguyen et al. reported that  35.5% of tumours 
had smaller volumes on  follow up, with  a median measured change in volume of −3.4%/year (Nguyen 
et  al. 2012).  Akshintala  et al.  applied a stricter  definition  for spontaneous tumour  volume reduction to 
exclude e.g. measurement error. They reported that  although  in  47/113  PNs  (41.6%)  the  final volume 
was  less than  the  maximal  volume during  the  entire  period of  follow-up,  only  in  10/113  PNs  (8.8%), 
spontaneous shrinkage could  be confirmed,  with  a  median decrease from  maximum volume of  19.0% 
and  a  median decrease per year  of  3.6%  (Akshintala  et  al.  2020).  Of  note,  all  these  publications  are 
from the  National Cancer Institute  (NCI) Paediatric Oncology Branch (POB). 
PN  associated clinical symptoms 
Patients may have 1 or multiple PNs which result in clinical impact such as pain, neurological and motor 
dysfunction, airway compromise, visual impairment, or disfigurement. The severity may range from mild, 
with modest impact on daily activities to severe. The symptoms or impact from the presence and growth 
of PNs are collectively termed PN associated symptoms (also referred to as morbidities in the literature 
and clinical community) and spontaneous resolution of these symptoms once developed has been shown 
to be extremely unlikely (Gross et al. 2018). 
NF1  is  characterised  by  progressive cutaneous,  neurological,  skeletal,  and  neoplastic  manifestations 
early  in  life  and  the  associated  clinical  signs  and  symptoms  (also  referred  to  as  morbidities  in  the 
literature and clinical community) can be severe. 
The  presence of  PN  can cause weakness and  restricted range  of motion  (Gross et  al.  2018),  and pain 
associated with PN can also interfere with  daily activities despite analgesia (Wolters et al. 2015).  PN can

result  in  life-threatening  complications  due  to  compression  of  vital  structures  (e.g.  great  vessel 
compression,  spinal  cord  compression,  and  airway  obstruction).  A  retrospective  data  analysis  of  the 
clinical records of children with  NF1  reported an increased mortality  rate has been reported in children 
with  symptomatic  PN  (5/154  patients,  3.2%)  compared  to 
those  without  PN  or  with 
unrecognised/asymptomatic PN (2/366 patients, 0.5%,  p=0.024, Prada et al. 2012). The most common 
cause of death  in patients  with  NF1-PN  was  MPNSTs (in  3  patients  aged 14  to 21  years), other causes 
included hypovolemic shock in an 18 year old patient,  due to a PN-related haemothorax and respiratory 
failure in  a 3 year-old patient  due to airway compression (Prada et al. 2012). 
The most common clinical complications leading to surgery were found to be neurologic, disfigurement, 
orthopaedic, and airway complaints (Prada et al. 2012). 
The Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis (REiNS) International Collaboration 
recommends  the  following  patient-reported  outcome  (PRO)  instruments  to  assess  pain  and  physical 
functioning  in NF  clinical trials: 
• 
• 
• 
the  Numerical  rating  scale-11  (NRS-11)  instrument  for  the  (self-reported)  assessment  of  pain 
intensity in  NF patients  aged ≥8  years (Wolters et al. 2013;  Wolters et al. 2016); 
the pain interference index (PII) instrument for the assessment of pain interference in NF1 patients, 
self-reported in patients aged 6-24 years and parent-reported for patients aged 6-18 years (Wolters 
et al. 2016);  and 
the  Patient-reported outcomes measurement information system (PROMIS) instrument  to  measure 
mobility and upper extremity function, self-reported in patients aged 8-17 years and parent-reported 
for patients aged 5-17  years (Wolters et  al. 2016). 
Association of PN volume changes and  development  of clinical morbidities 
Given the rarity of the disorder, there is little available literature that  documents the clinical course and 
impact of PN-related clinical complications. Recently, the first detailed report following the  change in 
PN growth  and development of PN-related clinical symptoms over an extensive time period (at least 7 
years of clinical data in each patient, 41  patients included) was published (Gross et al. 2018).  It was 
reported that  the majority of PN had already resulted in symptoms at the  baseline assessment, where 
the median patient age was 8  years old. Compared with  PN that  did not cause symptoms/clinical 
complications, PN resulting in pain and motor dysfunction tended to be larger in volume at baseline, 
consistent with  an earlier report (Nguyen et al. 2011).  There was a relationship between PN with faster 
growth rates and increases in analgesic use, compared with  those PN with  slower growth  rates. For 
non-motor symptoms, such as visual or bowel/bladder dysfunction,  smaller PN could cause significant 
clinical impact depending on their location and a slower growth rate may also result in  clinical 
deterioration.  
No stable or growing PN had resolution of functional impairment between baseline and maximum 
assessments. 
The overwhelming trend in patients with  stable or growing PN is that their  symptoms remain stable or 
worsen over time. 
NF1  is associated with  an 8- to 15-year reduction in average life expectancy in both  men and women, 
primarily due to malignant neoplasms and cardiovascular causes (Evans et al. 2011;  Uusitalo et al. 
2015).

2.1.5.  Management 
Currently, the only available options to  treat and manage NF1  are pain management and surgical 
excision to remove as much of the PN  as possible. However, for many patients,  surgery is not  a viable 
option as most PN are not  amenable to complete resection due to  encasement of, or close proximity 
to, vital structures (Korf. 1999; Needle et al 1997;  Packer et al 2002).  Furthermore, complete 
resection is difficult  to achieve, with  a high  risk of iatrogenic injury to related nerves and surrounding 
soft tissues and haemorrhage due to the invasiveness or high  vascularity of the PN (Canavese and 
Krajbich. 2011).  Following  subtotal or partial PN resection, 18%  of patients  experienced permanent 
surgical complications, including  speech abnormalities, nerve palsies, and pain, and 55% of patients 
experienced PN regrowth (Prada et  al 2012).  Furthermore, incompletely resected PN  tend to regrow 
after surgery (Canavese and Krajbich. 2011). 
About the product 
Selumetinib Hyd-sulfate (hereafter referred to as selumetinib) is a selective, oral, inhibitor of mitogen-
activated protein kinase kinases 1 and 2 (MEK1/2)  that is not  competitive with  respect to Adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP). MEK1/2  are critical components of the RAS-regulated, RAF-MEK-ERK  pathway 
which is frequently activated in  human cancer. The pathway is activated by an array of receptor types 
including receptor tyrosine kinases, G protein-coupled receptors and cytokine receptors. MEK1/2 are 
dual specificity kinases that  activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2  by phosphorylating 
them at conserved threonine and tyrosine residues in their activation loop. MEK1  and MEK2  show high 
(79%)  amino acid identity and are considered equally able to  phosphorylate and activate their 
substrates ERK1/2. In contrast to the exclusive substrate specificity of MEK1/2  for ERK1/2,  hundreds of 
proteins have been identified  as ERK substrates and this explains how the  RAF-MEK-ERK pathway can 
influence many cellular processes including tumour  cell proliferation, and survival. Therefore, MEK 
inhibition  can block the proliferation and survival of tumour cells in which  the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway is 
activated.  
Of specific relevance to this application, the causative genetic alterations in NF1  are mutations or 
microdeletions in the  tumour suppressor gene NF1  which  encodes the protein neurofibromin-1. 
Neurofibromin-1 contains a GAP (GTPase activating protein) related domain (GAD) whose normal 
function is to  promote the inactivation of RAS through  enhancing its GTPase activity. This results in 
activation of the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway and provides the rationale for the use of selumetinib for the 
proposed indication. 
Further to  the review of the application, the CHMP  agreed to the following indication: 
Koselugo as monotherapy is indicated for the  treatment of symptomatic, inoperable plexiform 
neurofibromas (PN) in paediatric patients with  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)  aged 3 years and above. 
Treatment with  Koselugo should be initiated  by a physician experienced in the  diagnosis and the 
treatment of patients with  NF1  related tumours. 
The recommended dose of Koselugo is 25  mg/m2 of body surface area (BSA), taken orally twice daily 
(approximately every 12 hours). 
Dosing is individualised based on BSA (mg/m2) and rounded to the nearest achievable 5 mg or 10 mg 
dose (up  to a maximum single dose of 50 mg). Different strengths of Koselugo capsules can be 
combined to attain the desired dose (Table 1).

Treatment with  Koselugo should continue as long as clinical benefit is observed, or until  PN progression 
or the development of unacceptable toxicity. There is limited  data in  patients older than  18, therefore 
continued treatment  into adulthood should be based on benefits and risks to the individual patient  as 
assessed by the physician. However, start  of treatment  with Koselugo in adults is not appropriate.  
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP did not  agree to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
not considered to be of major public health interest.  This was based on the  fact that: 
•  Based on the available information, it was considered uncertain whether the limited  data 
package (both in terms of study design and size) would enable to conclude on a positive 
benefit/risk and that  thereby the  unmet medical need would be fulfilled. 
• 
The clinical relevance of the observed activity was considered uncertain given the large 
heterogeneity in the  natural course of the disease in the context of a single arm trial and 
uncertainty regarding the  validity of the provided external controls. Therefore, the CHMP  were 
of the opinion that  the data presented at the time  of the  request did not justify per se an 
accelerated assessment (CHMP conclusion on 12 December 2019). 
The applicant requested consideration of its  application for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation in 
accordance with Article 14-a of the above mentioned Regulation, based on the following criteria: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive. 
It is likely that  the applicant will  be able to provide comprehensive data: 
−  Efficacy and safety data from a second data cut-off (DCO) (proposed DCO: 31 March 2021)  of 
the pivotal SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1 that  will provide 2 years and 9 months of further data. 
AstraZeneca proposes to provide long-term efficacy; PN  response (DOR and PFS) based on 
NCI central analysis, and clinical outcome measures (COA) (pain, motor, and HRQoL)  as well 
as additional long-term safety data. Long-term follow-up data are collected on patients for at 
least 7 years from initiation  of selumetinib treatment. 
−  Efficacy and safety data from a second DCO (27  February 2021) of SPRINT Phase I, that  will 
provide a further 2 years 8 months data from the MAA submission DCO June 2018.  The data 
presented for SPRINT Phase I will include long-term efficacy; PN response (DOR and PFS), 
and safety data as first patient was enrolled in 2011  and last patient was enrolled in 2014. 
Unmet medical needs will  be addressed, as there are no medicinal products authorised in Europe 
for the treatment of NF1  symptomatic, inoperable PN in paediatric patients  aged 3 years and 
above. 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the  risks inherent in the fact 
that  additional data are still required.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of selumetinib hyd-sulfate is 5-[(4-bromo-2-chlorophenyl)amino]-4-fluoro-6-[(2- 
hydroxyethoxy)carbamoyl]-1-methyl-1H-benzimidazol-3-ium hydrogen sulfate corresponding to the

molecular formula C17H17BrClFN4O7S (free base: C17H15BrClFN4O3. It has a relative molecular mass of 
555.76  (free base: 457.68)  and the following  structure: 
Figure 1: Active substance structure 
The chemical structure of selumetinib hyd-sulfate was elucidated by a combination of mass 
spectrometry (MS), proton (1H),  carbon (13C) and fluorine (19F) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 
spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy (IR) and ion chromatography (IC). In addition, the 1:1  salt 
stoichiometry of selumetinib hyd-sulfate has been confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD).  
The active substance does not  exhibit stereoisomerism. 
Selumetinib hyd-sulfate is a non-hygroscopic white  to yellow crystalline powder. Selumetinib has low 
solubility and low permeability as defined by the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) and 
thus is a BCS Class 4 compound. It is practically insoluble in water, slightly soluble in ethanol and 
acetonitrile. 
Selumetinib hyd-sulfate is monomorphic and all batches produced using the proposed manufacturing 
process have exhibited consistent X-ray powder diffraction patterns  (XRPD). Extensive solid-state 
investigations, including  polymorph screening, identified a number of solvates but  no additional 
crystalline non-solvated forms of selumetinib hyd-sulfate. The hyd-sulfate polymorph is controlled in 
the specifications and monitored on stability. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The  active substance is  synthesized in  two  main  steps  with  isolated  intermediates and  one salification 
step,  using  commercially available well  defined starting  materials (SM)  with  acceptable  specifications. 
The  selection  of  starting  materials  has  been  justified  and  considered  appropriate,  since  upstream 
materials  would  not  ensure  a  higher  quality  of  the  active  substance.  The  manufacturer,  synthesis 
process, specifications, analytical methods have been provided. The specifications for  impurities in  the 
starting  materials, the  level of  purge  and  the  control  strategy  were discussed  during  the  review (see 
major  objection  discussed  below).  The  specifications  and  the  in-process  controls  are  presented  and 
justified. 1 
Several PARs have been established. It has been clarified that  these are interpreted as defined in ICH 
Q8 and do not constitute  a design space. Target values for the parameters have also been defined. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting  materials and reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in  accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised. 
Assessment report

The active substance presents a quantitative  structure-activity relationship (QSAR) alert, however it is 
negative in  vitro (Ames negative). 
A risk assessment of the synthesis route with regard to  mutagenic impurities was performed in line 
with  ICH M7 using  two (Q)SAR prediction methodologies complementing each other. It included 
starting materials, intermediates, reagents, synthesis and degradation impurities. Several alerting 
structures (class 1,  2, and 3) were identified. Their control relies upon an understanding of the 
impurity purging capabilities of the manufacturing process. 
All Class 1, 2  and 3 mutagenic impurities  are controlled below the threshold of toxicological concern 
(TTC) limit using  either option  3 or 4 of ICH M7.  Calculated purge factors and purge ratios were used 
to justify the Options  3 or 4 control strategy. In the calculation of required purge, the applicant applied 
an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 10µg/day, for treatment duration of less than  10 years without  any 
justification.  This was questioned during the evaluation since, according to the SmPC, the product is 
indicated for the treatment of paediatric patients  aged 3 years and above, which suggests that  the 
product can be used for a longer time period than  10 years. In addition, when multiple class 2 or 3 
impurities are specified, total mutagenic impurities should be limited to the  ADI for multiple  impurities 
according to  ICH M7 (5µg/day for the sum of all impurities),  even more so as multiple  impurities are 
likely to have same mechanism (e.g. same structural  alert). Considering this,  a major objection asking 
the applicant to revise the control strategy for mutagenic impurities was raised. 
In addition, the available fate and purge data did not  allow to conclude that  the proposed specifications 
for class 2 and 3 mutagenic impurities in upstream process are sufficient to ensure the  levels of 
impurities in the active substance are below 30% of the acceptable limit  and therefore to  support the 
Option 3 control strategy. Supportive analytical results or an appropriate control strategy 
(specifications at the TTC level for multiple  impurities in the drug substance) were requested as part of 
the major objection.  
In his response, the applicant provided analytical data and argued that a <10  years dose duration 
represented the anticipated duration for the treatment of the majority of patients.  Only a subset of 
patients would  be expected to be treated for more than 10 years; dosing extending the full theoretical 
treatment period from 3 to 18  years (15 years duration), although theoretically possible, will  be highly 
unlikely. In fact, median actual treatment in the  clinical studies was below 5 years. Therefore, in line 
with   the exception in ICH M7,  the application of a limit of 100  ppm calculated on a < 10µg/day for a 
<10 years dosing duration and 100 mg selumetinib dose was considered justified. 
The applicant indicated that for all impurities, the purge ratio is appropriately high, reaffirming his 
position that  all such impurities are effectively controlled in  accordance with ICH M7.   It has been 
sufficiently justified that  mutagenic impurities are purged far below 30% of the acceptable limit 
according to  ICH M7.  
A risk assessment for elemental impurities in accordance to ICH Q3D was performed. Intentionally 
added metals and common environmental metals (Class 1 and 2A) were considered. Applying a worst 
case posology (maximum daily dose of 100mg),  the maximum permitted concentration was 
determined. Five batches of active substance were analysed and levels are below 30%  of the PDE 
calculated with option  2B.  
Solvents used in the process have been discussed and appropriate control has been demonstrated.  
The applicant stated that  a risk assessment for the  presence of nitrosamines in selumetinib hyd-sulfate 
had been conducted and a negligible risk of the presence of nitrosamines was identified. It was claimed 
that  nitrosamines that  could be generated during selumetinib hyd-sulfate synthesis would purge to a 
level below the analytical limit of detection in the  active substance. However, the underlying data were

not provided and the finished product was not covered in the risk assessment. This was not considered 
sufficient (see major objection discussion under finished product specification). 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with  the 
clinical development program.  An overview of the  development of the  synthetic process has been 
presented.  
Early studies used selumetinib free base as the active substance, which was manufactured by a route 
that  differed significantly from the  route now  proposed to manufacture selumetinb hyd-sulfate. The 
selumetinib free base route was a linear synthesis via step wise halogenation of the aniline moiety. 
This route was superseded by the convergent selumetinib hyd-sulfate routes, which introduce the 
aniline moiety with the  requisite chloro and bromo subsitituents  already in place, being more efficient, 
safer to operate, more environmentally benign and producting better quality active substance. 
The synthetic route for the  manufacture of selumetinib hyd-sulfate changed in early development from 
the first generation to the second generation route, the main changes being made in order to improve 
the impurity profile and manufacturability. Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail 
and have been justified. The first generation route, was used to  manufacture two  batches that  have 
been used in toxicological studies. The majority of active substance batches have been manufactured 
using the intended commercial manufacturing process (second generation route). These batches have 
been used in clinical and pivotal stability studies.  
The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is considered to be 
comparable with  that produced by the proposed commercial process. 
The active substance is packaged in double low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags, within  a rigid outer 
container. The rigid outer container provides light  and physical protection during storage and transit. 
The primary packaging complies with  EC regulation 10/2011  EC 10/2011  as amended.  
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for description (visual), identification (IR, XPRD), 
assay (LC), organic impurities (LC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF),  residue on ignition  (Ph. 
Eur.), and particle size (laser diffraction). 
2The proposed acceptance criteria for specified organic impurities have been derived following 
principles of ICH and are based on a combination of process capability, toxicological qualification, 
available stability data and batch data from pilot  and commercial scale manufactures.  
 Specified impurities have been qualified by toxicological and clinical studies . All other organic 
impurities are controlled by the individual unspecified impurity clause. 
The control strategy for residual solvents has been justified and is acceptable.  
As indicated above, selumetinib is a BCS Class 4 compound.  Particle size is included in the specification.  
In accordance with the principles of ICH M7, the likelihood of identified Class 1, 2 and 3 impurities being 
present  in  selumetinib  hyd-sulfate  has  been assessed through  process data  and  the  use  of  calculated 
purge factors (see discussion above). All Class 1, 2 and 3 impurities are controlled under either option 3 
or 4 of ICH M7. 
The absence for a specific specification test for counter ion content has been justified on the basis of the 
combination of assay and identification, using two specific identity methods: IR and XPRD, which provide 
assurance for selumetinib hyd-sulfate 1:1  salt stoichiometric form.  
Assessment report

The control of elemental species used in the selumetinib hyd-sulfate manufacturing process  to less than 
the  ICH  Q3D  option  2B  limit  upstream  of  the  active  substance  has  been justified.  Therefore, it  is  not 
necessary to include a specification for them at  the level of the active substance. 
The absence of a test  for microbial limit  has been justified, based on the high  microbiological quality of 
selumetinib  hyd-sulfate batches  and the  low  potential  for microbial growth.  The  potential  for microbial 
contamination  in  selumetinib  hyd-sulfate  has  been  justified  to  be  very  low.  This  was  supported  by 
microbial  testing  performed during  stability  and  development  scale  batches  which  confirmed  that  all 
batches of selumetinib  hyd-sulfate have very low viable counts (<10 cfu/g). 
The  water content  of selumetinib  hyd-sulfate  (and  hence potential  for  microbial growth  on  storage) is 
controlled in the manufacturing process to very low levels . 
A mould challenge test has been performed on selumetinib hyd-sulfate and demonstrates that the active 
substance  does not  support  mould  growth.  In  addition,  it  has  been established  that  selumetinib  hyd-
sulfate does not support microbial growth since the water activity (Aw) of batches are below the minimum 
level required for microbial growth  (Aw 0.60).  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in  accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding 
selumetinib reference standard for identity and assay testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data for an extensive number of batches of the active substance have been provided. 
The results are within  the specifications and consistent  from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of active substance from the  proposed 
manufacturer and three primary pilot scale stability batches from another manufacturer, stored for up 
to 60 months  under long term conditions (25°C  / 60% RH)  and for up to 6 months  under accelerated 
conditions (40°C  / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Photostability  testing 
following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one primary stability  pilot scale batch.   
Batches were  packed in  double  polyethene bags  in  a foil-lined  fibreboard drum.  The container  closure 
for stability studies is representative of the  commercial container closure.  
The following parameters were tested: description, identification  (by XRPD for primary stability; IR for 
commercial stability both  providing discrimination for changes in solid state form), assay, organic 
impurities and water content. Microbiological quality testing  was performed periodically for information 
only. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability  indicating. 
Particle size testing  was not  included in the primary stability study since the particle size of selumetinib 
hyd-sulfate has been shown to be unaffected when  stored in double polyethene bags in a foil-lined 
drum at 25°C/60%  RH during development.  
No significant  change was observed in any of the parameters tested in samples stored for up to  72 
months at long-term (25°C  /60% RH)  and for 6 months at accelerated (40°C /75%  RH) storage 
conditions. All active substance batches complied with  the active substance specification and support 
the proposed retest period. 
No significant  change to description, identification,  assay, water content or microbiological quality was 
observed for the selumetinib hyd-sulfate pilot  scale batch exposed to the photostability  conditions. 
However, the  level of an unspecified organic impurity showed a significant change failing the

specification limit. The photostability  study indicates that,  to ensure the quality of the active substance 
during storage, selumetinib hyd-sulfate should be stored protected from light.  The proposed container 
has been shown to provide suitable protection from light. 
The stability indicating  character of the  analytical method for assay and impurities has been adequately 
demonstrated via forced degradation studies in solid and in  solution phase.  These included: thermal 
stress (60°C,  solid state), hydrolytic degradation (60°C/80%RH,  50°C /75%RH,  60°C/75%RH, 
70°C/75%  RH, photostability  (solid state), acid and base (pH 1, pH  7, and pH 13  solution), oxidative 
hydrolysis and metal ions. 
The main degradation impurities under the different stress conditions have been described The stability 
results indicate that  the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently stable. 
The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 60 months  when stored below 30°C in the 
proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Selumetinib capsules are opaque two-piece hard hypromellose capsules sealed with  a clear 
hypromellose band. They are presented as two strengths: 
•  10 mg capsules presented as white  capsules marked with  ‘SEL 10’ printed in  black ink. 
•  25 mg capsules presented as blue capsules marked with  ‘SEL 25’  printed in black ink. 
The capsules are size 4 (14.3 x 5.3 mm). As described in the SmPC, the capsules should be swallowed 
whole with  water. The capsules should not be chewed, dissolved, or opened, because this  could impair 
drug release and affect the absorption of selumetinib.  This pharmaceutical form and its  size would in 
principle not be considered a suitable age-appropriate formulation as proposed by the applicant as 
there is a risk for reduced patient  compliance (treatment discontinuation)  and, for younger children, a 
risk of choking or chewing the  capsule. The CHMP raised a multidisciplinary Major Objection (MO) 
requesting the applicant to discuss how these aspects will  be addressed in real life practice in the 
paediatric population  and to further justify the use of the capsules in the youngest patients.  Although 
based on clinical experience in the pivotal trial, children from the age of 3 years have been able to 
swallow the capsules whole (with  or without  proper training),  these findings  for a limited number of 
patients are not considered sufficient to conclude that the  capsules are age-appropriate in general and 
in real-life, where it is anticipated  that at least part of especially the younger children will be unable or 
unwilling  to swallow the capsules whole as intended. However, considering the lack of available 
treatment for the intended indication  and the  high unmet medical need in this  seriously debilitating 
condition, the  capsule formulation is exceptionally accepted pending the development by the company 
of an alternative age-appropriate formulation as per the PIP decision for selumetinib. Nevertheless, 
since it is anticipated that  not all children (particularly the  youngest) in  the indicated age range will be 
able or willing  to swallow the capsules whole, it  is considered essential that  the alternative age-
appropriate formulation described in the PIP becomes available as soon as possible. 
First-in-patient  clinical studies in  adults were performed using a 100 mg suspension of selumetinib free 
base in sulfobutylether-beta-cyclodextrin aqueous solution prepared immediately before use. This 
formulation exhibited poor bioavailability due to the  solubility limitations  of the free base and was not 
progressed further. 
Assessment report  
EMA/549867/2021  
Page 21/164 
 
 
 
 
Development of a salt of selumetinib was pursued. The hyd-sulfate salt of selumetinib was selected for 
development as it improves the bioavailability  as demonstrated in the relative bioavailability study; 
Study 5 (D1532C00005).   
Selumetinib hyd-sulfate was progressed to formulation development studies with  a target of delivering 
selumetinib from an oral, immediate release (IR) solid dosage form. 
A Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) was defined which framed the  pharmaceutical development 
program. The primary aim of the  QTPP was to develop an age appropriate formulation which  met the 
needs of the paediatric patient population,  while ensuring establishment of a robust formulation and 
manufacturing process which delivers a product which consistently meets the critical quality attributes 
and exhibits good chemical and physical stability throughout  the product shelf-life.  
The QTTP was to develop an oral, immediate release solid dosage swallable by 3-18 years old patients  
that provides appropriate dosing flexibility for patients based on BSA.  Capsule strengths are to  be 
differentiated through different capsule colours and different bottle  closure colours for each strength. 
The selected manufacturing process and packing configuration should ensure chemical and physical 
stability throughout  the product shelf life.  Physical stability is necessary to maintain the bioavailability 
advantage.   
Pharmaceutical development activities initially focused on the development of an IR tablet,  however 
manufacturability issues and long term excipient incompatibility precluded further tablet  formulation 
development.  Capsule formulations containing  a powder blend were also found to be unfeasible, 
encountering issues of manufacturability and excipient compatibility  analogous with  those observed 
during initial  tablet development.  A screen of lipidic excipients led to the  selection of TPGS vitamin E 
polyethylene glycol succinate (hereinafter referred to as TPGS- Tocopheryl Polyethylene Glycol 
Succinate) for further assessment.     
During this assessment, an encapsulated suspension of  selumetinib hyd-sulfate in a solid matrix of 
TPGS in a sealed two-piece, hard hypromellose capsule shell (size 4) was found to preserve the 
stability  of the hyd-sulfate salt and provide the manufacturability required for a commercial product. A 
dog study (0571KD) demonstrated the good oral bioavailability of selumetinib when presented as an 
encapsulated dispersion of the  hyd-sulfate salt in  a TPGS matrix. 
A comprehensive assessment of the selumetinib capsule formulation was performed to determine 
formulation robustness prior to further clinical development. The impact of selumetinib hyd sulfate 
drug load suspended in TPGS in capsules was evaluated. The actual drug loading of commercial 
capsules falls within  the range assessed. this  formulation design was selected for clinical and 
commercial development. Two strengths of the selumetinib capsule were developed, 10 and 25 mg, 
which support dose flexibility in the proposed indication and patient  population. Both strengths are 
qualitatively equivalent in  terms of composition, however, to maintain  manufacturability and fill weight 
control, drug loading and fill weight was varied within  the range assessed for formulation robustness. 
During development only minor changes were made to  the capsules:  
To support differentiation of the  strengths and support patient compliance, the capsule shell colour 
differs; the  10 mg capsule is white,  and the  25 mg capsule is blue. 
As indicated above, selumetinib is a BCS Class 4 compound and selumetinib  capsules exhibit good oral 
bioavailability. As discussed earlier, a particle size control limit  has been included in the active 
substance specification. TPGS is the  primary excipient present in the formulation and is included for 
stability purposes. During selection of the capsule shell, different types of hard hypromellose capsule 
shells were evaluated. The capsule shell provides a tough protective casing for the product matrix. The 
hypromellose two-piece shell is sealed with  a clear hypromellose band at  the junction of capsule body 
and cap. to prevent leakage of contents.  On contact with  aqueous media in the gastrointestinal tract,

the capsule shell disintegrates and dissolves rapidly to  provide access to the TPGS matrix containing 
the active substance. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their  quality is compliant with 
pharmacopoeial or EC requirements (colouring agents). There are no novel excipients used in the 
finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The compatibility of the active substance with  the excipients used in the  proposed commercial 
formulation has been confirmed by the results of stability studies. 
The potential for selumetinib hyd-sulfate to dissociate and precipitate as selumetinib  free base during 
dissolution in vivo or upon pH  shift from a low gastric pH  to a higher intestinal  pH was taken into 
consideration during  formulation development and evaluation of product performance.  It was 
demonstrated that the selumetinib  capsules, exhibit pH independent dissolution  throughout the 
dissolution timeframe. 
The release profile and stages observed have been discussed. This release mechanism has been well 
characterised throughout development.  
The dissolution method development focused on identifying  a method which  is clinically relevant, 
appropriately discriminating, and which has suitable method capability and robustness for routine 
application.  
During formulation and process development, a suite of dissolution  tests was applied to build  an 
understanding of the product performance across a range of physiological conditions  including 
biorelevant pH,  volumes and hydrodynamics.  
The method established as the commercial quality control (QC) release method for selumetinib 
capsules has shown appropriate level of discrimination representative of the in vivo behaviour of 
variants of relevant failure modes A specification which  controls for complete dissolution of selumetinib 
is proposed as a relevant control for in vivo performance. The limit  was revised during the evaluation 
Selumetinib capsules have demonstrated consistent in vivo product  performance with respect to 
pharmacokinetics throughout  pharmaceutical development. This has been supported by a range of 
relative bioavailability and clinical pharmacology studies which characterised the biopharmaceutics of 
selumetinib and confirmed the in  vivo performance of the commercial selumetinib capsules used in the 
pivotal clinical study; SPRINT. 
A control strategy has been established for selumetinib  capsules which ensures consistent  delivery of a 
quality product. Controls have been defined which  relate to input  raw materials, PARs for CPPs, and in 
process controls across the manufacturing process, end product testing, and packaging and storage 
conditions. This control strategy provides confidence in the continuous  production of selumetinib 
capsules which  meets the quality specification upon release and for the shelf-life of the product. 
The commercial formulation has been used to support  the pivotal clinical study in  NF1;  SPRINT 
(D1532C00057)  and supportive clinical pharmacology and biopharmaceutic studies. 
The primary packaging consists of a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic bottle with child-resistant 
polypropylene closure (10  mg: white  closure, 25  mg:  blue closure) and  silica gel desiccant,  containing 
60  hard  capsules.  The  material  complies  with  EC  requirements.  The  bottles  and  closures  have  been 
tested  to  and  comply with  the  child  resistance requirements in  CFR  1700  and  would  comply with  ISO 
8317:2015.  Selumetinib capsules are packaged within  a protective pack which provides stability for the 
shelf-life of the  product under the proposed storage conditions 
Assessment report  
EMA/549867/2021  
Page 23/164 
 
 
 
The risk of accidental swallowing of the desiccant capsule was also addressed. The desiccant is sufficiently 
visually distinguishable from the product and bears the warning’ in multiple languages and also has a do 
not eat symbol. 
The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the 
intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process for selumetinib capsules consists  of molten liquid  filling  into hard two-piece 
hypromellose capsule shells, which comprises melting of TPGS, mixing of the molten TPGS and the active 
substance to  produce a  homogeneous mixture encapsulation of the  bulk molten  fill material, sealing of 
the  capsules  by  banding  and  packaging.  Given  the  particularities  of  the  manufacturing  process,  the 
process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process. 
A common manufacturing process is applied to both strengths of selumetinib capsules and the 
commercial manufacturing process has been established at  the commercial site. 
A quality, risk-based approach was taken to identify key Critical Quality Attributes  (CQAs) and process 
parameters essential for the consistent delivery of good quality product from the manufacturing 
process. The CQAs identified and controlled for in the  finished product specification are description, 
identity,  uniformity of dosage unit  (UDU),  assay, degradation products, dissolution and microbiological 
quality. 
Establishment and maintenance of a homogeneous mixture of selumetinib hyd-sulfate and TPGS is 
essential for control of content uniformity throughout  manufacturing and ensuring good product quality 
at the end of manufacture. The critical process parameters associated with  this have been defined 
Proven acceptable ranges (PARs) have been established for these critical process parameters and 
provide assurance of process robustness and product quality. Relevant product CQA for each step, 
associated process parameters settings and ranges, and in-process controls have been defined to 
guarantee product quality.  The available development data, the proposed control strategy and batch 
analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support the proposed PARs. 
The  manufacturing  process has  been  adequately  validated on  three  full  production  scale  batches  per 
strength.  It has been demonstrated that  the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished 
product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type 
of manufacturing process.  
Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
description (visual), identification  (LC/UV),  assay (LC),  degradation products  (LC), dissolution  (LC-UV), 
content uniformity (LC),  and microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.). 
Following a request from the CHMP, the applicant added a skip-lot testing for 
microbial limits in the finished product. 
During the review a major objection (MO) was raised since no risk evaluation concerning the presence 
of nitrosamine impurities  in the finished product has been provided. The applicant presented a risk 
assessment for presence of nitrosamines, evaluating the  structure of selumetinib  and its  impurities, the 
presence of nitrosating  agents (nitrites) in  active substance and finished product,  assessment of 
presence of secondary and tertiary amines, assessment of potential formation of nitrosamines in the 
capsules and the calculation of the worst case theoretical levels of nitrosamines in the finished product. 
The company described in detail the origin and purge calculations of the potential  nitrosamines, 
Assessment report  
EMA/549867/2021

nitrosating agents and vulnerable amine structures. All the currently identified root causes for the 
presence of nitrosamines as listed in section 4 of the EMA Q&A document EMA/409815/2020  rev 2 
were considered in the  risk assessment process.  
In the active substance synthesis nitrosamines may potentially be formed from nitrosatable amine 
structures and nitrosating agents present in the process. In the finished product nitrosamines may 
potentially be formed from nitrosatable amine structures carried over from the active substance 
synthesis and trace nitrites in  the excipient TPGS. The worst case estimates were compared with the 
permitted daily exposures extracted from EMA, FDA guidance (NMDA, DIPNA, EIPNA) and for the non-
referenced impurities, on TD50 in the  Lhasa database. The results from the calculations indicate that 
despite the presence of amine impurities and nitrosating impurities,  the estimated exposure levels of 
individual nitrosamines are below 10% of the permitted limit  and the  total exposure levels are below 
the lowest permitted level and below the 18  ng/day identified by the EMA as the default permitted 
level for nitrosamines.  
The applicant also provided more detailed data to substantiate  the estimated exposure levels for 
nitrosamines in order to allow assessing the origin, fate, and purge of the potential  nitrosamines. The 
possible formation of nitrosamines was overall based on conservative assumptions. The applicant 
concludes that  testing  in the finished product is not be necessary. This is acceptable. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been 
assessed on a risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental 
Impurities. The risk assessment concluded that there is no risk. This was confirmed 
by ICP-MS testing of three commercially representative batches of each product 
strength. All elemental impurities were demonstrated to be well below the ICH Q3D 
limits. Therefore, elemental impurities are not included in the finished product 
specification. The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory.  
The omission of a test for water content and residual solvents in selumetinib capsules was also 
justified. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the  ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standard used for 
identity and assay testing  has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 21 batches of 10  mg capsules and 55 batches of 25 mg 
capsules from various scales confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to 
manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability  data  from  three  pilot  scale batches  of  each strength  of  finished  product  stored  for  up  to  36 
months under long  term (25°C / 60%  RH)  and intermediate (30°C/75%  RH) conditions  and for up  to 6  
months  under accelerated conditions  (40°C  / 75%  RH)  according to  the ICH  guidelines were provided. 
The  batches  of  Koselugo are  representative to  those  proposed for  marketing  and  were packed  in  the 
primary packaging proposed for marketing In addition,  bulk pack stability was assessed for one batch of 
selumetinib capsules 10 mg and two batches of selumetinib capsules 25 mg, which were stored in double 
low-density polyethylene bags with  desiccant, inside a container/drum. 
Samples  were  tested  for  description,  assay,  degradation  products,  dissolution,  water  content    (for 
information  only)  and  microbiological quality.  All  the  tests  are performed at  each  time  point  with  the 
exception of the test for microbiological quality which is performed at the 6 month time point at the 40°C 
/75% RH  conditions and annually at  the 25°C /60% RH  and 30°C /75% RH conditions. 
Assessment report  
EMA/549867/2021  
Page 25/164 
 
 
 
The  primary  stability  data  generated  showed  little  or  no  change  in  description,  assay,  dissolution, 
degradation products or microbiological quality when stored in HDPE bottles for 36 months at 25°C/60% 
RH  and 30°C/75%  RH.  An increase in water  content was  observed for all  batches.  This increase is not 
considered significant  as  it  has  no  impact  on  the  critical  quality  attributes  such  as  assay, degradation 
products, dissolution and microbial quality. 
At  accelerated  conditions,  the  10  mg  capsules  showed  little  or  no  change  in  description,  assay, 
degradation products and microbiological quality. A significant  decrease in dissolution was observed for 
all  batches of  capsules and the  dissolution  failed to  meet  the  requirements of the  specification  after 6 
months.  This  observation was  attributed  to  the  melting  point  for TPGS (37°C  -41°C  ).  To avoid, this  a 
temperature  storage  condition  ‘Do  not  store  above  30°C  ’  has  been  established.  Given  that  this 
phenomenon was not observed after 3 months of storage at accelerated conditions for any of the capsule 
strengths,  it  is  not  expected  that  short  excursions  above  the  temperature  storage  restriction  will 
negatively impact product performance. Stability data for the 25 mg capsules showed little  or no change 
in description, assay, degradation products, dissolution  or microbiological quality.   
Stability data for selumetinib capsules 10 and 25 mg stored in the bulk pack for 36 months at 25°C/60% 
RH  showed  similar  results  to  the  capsules  stored  in  the  commercial  packaging.    At  40°C/75%  RH  a 
decrease  in  dissolution  was  observed  resulting  in  out  of  specification.  As  indicated  above,  this  was 
expected given the melting temperature of TPGS.  
Based on the  available stability data, a holding time  of 24  months is applied to selumetinib  capsules 10 
and 25 mg in the bulk pack with  a product label storage condition of ‘Do not  store above 25°C ’. 
A forced degradation study of selumetinib  capsules demonstrated the specificity and stability  indicating 
nature  of  the  LC  method.  Degradation was  observed under  thermal/humidity,  acidic, basic,  photolytic 
and oxidative conditions.  
Photostability  was  assessed for one  batch  of each  strength  in  accordance with  ICH  Q1B. Data  showed 
little or no change in description, assay, dissolution, water content or microbiological quality. An increase 
in the level of an unspecified degradation product in the open petri dish sample was observed, but levels 
were below the  quantitation  limit.  The data confirm that  10 and 25 mg capsules are light  sensitive, and 
the  level of  light  protection  offered by  the  commercial pack is  sufficient  to  prevent degradation under 
photolytic conditions. 
An in-use stability study was also conducted to simulate patient  use. Two aged batches of each capsule 
strength  in  both  the  84  and  60  bottle  count  were  used.  Bottles  were  stored  at  25°C/60%  RH  and 
30°C/75%  RH for 4 and  6 weeks for the 60  and 84 count  study respectively. They were removed twice 
on each day of the study, their caps removed and replaced to simulate patient use. For both the 60 and 
84  count  study,  no  significant  change  in  description,  assay,  degradation  products,  dissolution,  water 
content or microbial quality was observed after 4 or 6 weeks respectively at 25°C/60% RH and 30°C/75% 
RH. 
The data support an in-use period of at least 4 weeks at  25°C/60%  RH and 30°C/75%  RH when  stored 
in the original bottle. 
Based on  available stability  data, the  proposed shelf-life of 3 years for selumetinib capsules 10  and 25 
mg  when stored  in HDPE  bottles  with  desiccant  with  a product  label storage condition  of  ‘Do not  store 
above 30°C. Store in the original bottle to protect from moisture and light. Keep the bottle tightly closed’, 
as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3)  are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and 
finished product has been presented in a satisfactory manner.  
During the procedure a multidisciplinary major objection was raised in relation to 
the proposed pharmaceutical form, which is not considered fully appropriate for the 
intended patient population (children from 3 years of age). Children of young age 
may not be able to swallow the capsule whole due to its size, leading to a risk  for 
reduced patient compliance (treatment discontinuation) and, for younger children, a 
risk of choking or chewing the capsule. However, considering the unmet medical 
need in this seriously debilitating condition, and the data from the pivotal clinical 
trial indicating that patients from the age of 3 years have been able to swallow the 
capsules whole (with or without proper training), and that an alternative age-
appropriate formulation (is currently under development by the company in line 
with an agreed PIP, this has been exceptionally accepted by the CHMP.  
Additional major objections were raised with regards to the proposed control 
strategy for mutagenic impurities and the lack of a risk assessment on potential 
presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product. These major objections 
were adequately addressed by the applicant. 
 Overall, the results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion 
that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance 
with the conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects 
relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated 
and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not  applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Selumetinib has been evaluated in in  vitro and in vivo studies that were designed to characterise the 
pharmacology, safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology of this  compound. Two forms of 
selumetinib have been used in  the nonclinical development studies: selumetinib free base and 
selumetinib hydrogen sulfate salt (hyd-sulfate). Initial  studies were conducted using selumetinib free 
base. Due to the limited  solubility of the  selumetinib free base and the resulting low  bioavailability, 
selumetinib hydrogen sulfate salt (hyd-sulfate) was developed and used in later studies.

Selumetinb and its metabolites have not been tested against MEK of other species used in toxicity 
studies such as mouse, rat, rabbit and Cynomolgus monkey.  
Assays in several tumour cell lines have been used to  demonstrate selectivity for RAF-MEK-ERK 
pathway inhibition  over other related signalling pathways. Tumour cell lines whose growth was most 
potently inhibited  by selumetinib  were enriched for those carrying RAS and BRAF gene mutations and 
which therefore have active RAF-MEK-ERK signalling (Davies et al, 2007;  Dry et al, 2010).  None of the 
tumour cell lines was derived from neurofibrosarcoma, Schwann cells or of nervous system origin.  
Primary pharmacodynamics in vivo 
Selumetinib was originally developed for treatment  of several cancers and later in  treatment of 
paediatric patients  NF1  and PN.  
Selumetinib was initially assessed in anti-tumour  efficacy using human tumour  xenografts (oncology 
proof of concept models (POC). Three studies were performed using the  Calu-6, mutant  KRAS non-
small-cell lung carcinoma human tumour xenograft grown subcutaneously in mice. Selumetinib was 
administrated orally and a dose response study was observed. The minimal effective dose was 
determined at  0.75 mg/kg BID and a statistically  significant inhibition  of tumour growth was observed. 
Moreover, at doses generating clinically relevant exposures, the maximal inhibition  of ERK 
phosphorylation was between 40% and 80%  (Pharmacology Reports 09, 10, 12  and 47).   
To investigate anti-tumour efficacy in the intended  indication, genetically modified mouse models of 
neurofibroma type-1 (deletion of NF1  in Schwann cell precursors results in neurofibroma formation) 
were used in two  studies. Selumetinib resulted in inhibition  of ERK phosphorylation (40  - 60%) and in 
reduction in number (up to 75%)  and size (up to 41%)  of neurofibromas at dose which were close to 
clinically relevant dose (in term of human equivalent dose [HED])  (Pharmacology Reports 54 and 55). 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Selumetinib and N-desmethyl selumetinib were tested at 10  μM (390-fold  greater than the  unbound 
plasma Cmax of selumetinib and > 3000-fold  greater than the  unbound plasma Cmax of N-desmethyl 
selumetinib at the recommended selumetinib clinical dose of 25 mg/m² BID) in a panel of in vitro 
radioligand binding and enzyme assays covering a diverse range of molecular targets. No targets were 
identified that  were considered pharmacologically relevant at human therapeutic plasma exposure 
levels of selumetinib (unbound Cmax = 26  nM) or N-desmethyl selumetinib (unbound Cmax = 3 nM) 
(Study 0320SY).   
Safety pharmacology programme 
Selumetinib  was evaluated in a series of GLP-compliant safety pharmacology studies in  vitro and in 
vivo. No safety concerns have been identified in the safety pharmacology studies conducted with 
selumetinib and its main metabolite N-desmethyl selumetinib at clinically relevant doses.  
The CNS/neurobehavioral safety profile was assessed in rats. In an Irwin assay in male rats, 
selumetinib (10,  30, 100 mg/kg, oral route, single dose) did not induce any adverse neurobehavioral 
effects at  the oral doses up  to 100 mg/kg (study 1758/ARR/03).  However, no PK measurement have 
been performed.  
The respiratory effects of selumetinib were investigated in the anaesthetised rat (Study 1760/ARR/03). 
After single oral gavage administration of selumetinib (10, 30,  100 mg/kg, oral route) in male rats, 
there was no effect on respiratory rate, tidal  volume, lung dynamic compliance or minute  volume up 
100 mg/kg. Airway resistance was slightly  increased (18% above baseline) at 2 hours post-dose in the 
100 mg/kg dose group only. There were no respiratory abnormalities observed in the rat 29-day

toxicity study at this  dose level. No PK measurement have been performed. Concentration and 
exposure at 100 mg/kg in rat are respectively around 36-fold  the clinical intended Cmax and 42-fold 
intended exposure at the recommended clinical paediatric dose (25  mg/m² bid) considering TK 
measurements at D1 in 29-day toxicity in rat (223-002).   
Two safety pharmacology studies addressed the potential adverse cardiovascular or cardiac 
electrophysiological effects of selumetinib (studies 030819.BCP and 0179SZ). In the hERG assay, 
selumetinib was evaluated in stably transfected HEK293 cells at concentrations of 0.1, 0.3, 1  and 3 
and 10 µM,  which produced no concentration-dependent inhibition  of hERG tail current. This maximum 
test concentration was 390-fold greater than the unbound plasma Cmax of selumetinib the 
recommended selumetinib clinical dose of 25 mg/m² BID. In vivo safety pharmacology (telemetry) 
studies were performed in conscious minipigs (study 1759/ARR/03).  Oral dosing of selumetinib (0, 3, 
10 and 30 mg/kg) had no effects on heart rate, blood pressure or ECG intervals (QT, QTc, RR, PR) 
neither up to 30 mg/kg (below the clinical Cmax at 25  mg/m² BID). Likewise, selumetinib had no 
effect on electrocardiographic parameters in monkey after 26-week administration up to 4 mg/kg BID 
(approximately 4-fold the expected clinical Cmax at the  recommended dose). N-desmethyl selumetinib 
did not inhibit  the  hERG current at concentrations up to 100  μM (>30000-fold  the  clinical unbound 
Cmax at 25  mg/m² BID). The presence of N-desmethyl selumetinib in minipig  CV study was not 
investigated.  
Regarding GI system, in the  rat studies, treatment with  a single dose of selumetinib was associated 
with  observations of gastric irritation  at 30 and 100 mg/kg (approximately 24- and 42-fold respectively 
the clinical exposure at 25 mg/m² BID). GI findings were observed in rat and monkey toxicity studies; 
however, no histopathological evidence of gastric irritation  was observed. Erosion/ulceration in the 
non-glandular mucosa of the stomach has been observed in mice at from 1 mg/kg, the lowest dose 
tested in 26-week study, therefore no safety margin could be determined (studies 1761/ARR/03, 
1762/ARR/03 and 1763/ARR/03). 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No non-clinical pharmacodynamics drug interaction  studies were conducted. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods of analysis 
The multi-analyte analytical methods used to assay selumetinib and both its  N-desmethyl and amide 
metabolites in non-clinical pharmacokinetic and pivotal toxicology studies employed LC-MS/MS. 
Toxicokinetic bioanalysis was conducted with  validated assays. Samples of selumetinib, selumetinib N-
desmethyl, and selumetinib  amide in mouse, rat and monkey plasma were shown to be stable for the 
required storage period and during analysis. All bioanalysis met validation and qualification criteria 
applicable at the  time of the study. 
Stability of selumetinib and N-desmethyl selumetinib in plasma samples of mouse, rat and monkey 
stored at ca. -20°C  were demonstrated over a 4-months  storage period and that  of selumetinib amide 
over a 12-month storage period. 
Absorption 
In vivo the absorption of selumetinib was studied  in mice, rats and monkeys after oral and IV single 
dose administration  and after repeated doses (PK dedicated studies or PK parameters measured in 
toxicity studies – Studies KPM017,  KPR024,  KKP023, VKS/0211, 0428PM  KMM058,  VKS0210 and 
0070DP). Two forms were studied: earlier studies were performed with  selumetinib free base showing 
Assessment report  
EMA/549867/2021  
Page 32/164 
 
 
 
a moderate to high absorption at low doses in  all species but at higher doses evidence of  saturable 
absorption was observed. On the contrary, observed exposure after selumetinib hyd-sulfate salt 
administration increased approximately proportionally with  the dose. The second form was therefore 
selected for the further non-clinical and clinical development. 
After oral administration selumetinib hyd-sulfate was rapidly absorbed in all species studied with  Tmax 
occurring after 1-2 h in  mice and monkeys and after 2-4  h in rats. The clearance was measured only in 
monkeys with  selumetinib free base and the value indicated that  clearance was moderate (0.88 
L/h/kg) and volume of distribution  greater than  total body blood volume (1.1 L/kg). The bioavailability 
of selumetinib after oral intake was also determined only in monkey at 56 %.  The half-time T½  was 
determined at  3-7.6h in mice, 2.95-11  h in monkeys after PO intake of selumetinib hyd-sulfate and 
these values were similar to the half-life observed in humans (6.2 h in paediatric patients after the 
intended recommended dose). No accumulation was observed in mice after repeated dose 
administration and low accumulation occurred in monkeys (max 1.9).  Sex-differences were observed in 
mice; exposures were 2-fold higher in  females while no sex-differences were observed in monkeys. 
PK parameters of N-desmethyl selumetinib were also measured after selumetinib hyd-sulfate salt 
administration. This active metabolite was formed with Tmax occurring at 0.6-10  h and was present in 
mice around 2-20%  in 26-weeks study and up to  30% in carcinogenicity study, with  lower proportion 
relative to selumetinib  with time period, while it  was present at very limited quantity  in rats and in 
monkeys (< 0.2% at  3 months in rats and 1-month in  monkeys and not detected in 26-weeks). In 
mice, N-desmethyl selumetinib presented a T1/2 similar than the parent (2.9-7h),  a lower 
bioavailability, a higher clearance and volume of distribution.  No  accumulation was observed. Exposure 
to N-desmethyl selumetinib was higher in male mice than in  females. The half-life T½ was determined 
at 3-8h  in mice and 5-7  h in monkeys. 
PK  parameters  of  selumetinib  amide  were  also  measured  after  selumetinib  hyd-sulfate  salt 
administration.  This second active metabolite was  rapidly formed with  Tmax occurring at  0.5-24  h and 
was present in  around 2%  in mice,  monkeys and rats. Exposures were increased with  multiple  dosing. 
The half-life T½ was determined at 4-27  h in mice. 
Distribution 
The in vitro plasma protein binding of selumetinib and N-desmethyl selumetinib have been studied in 
mouse, rat,  dog, mini-pig,  monkey and human (studies KPJ003 and KPJ027). In all species selumetinib 
showed similar high  protein binding  profile. The determined plasma protein binding was found to be 
independent of concentration for both compounds. Binding of selumetinib was high in all species 
investigated and very high in rat, with  overall mean binding ranked minipig  (93.7%)  < dog (94.6%) < 
monkey (97.7)  < human (98.4%)  < mouse (98.9%)  < rat (99.7%).  Binding was determined for its 
metabolite: binding was also high in all species investigated and very high in rat.  
The tissue distribution  of total  radioactivity in albino male rats and male and female pigmented rats 
and mice following  single oral administration of [14C]selumetinib was evaluated by quantitative  whole-
body autoradiography (QWBA) (studies KMR002  and KMM004).  Total radioactivity was widely 
distributed  with tissue concentrations generally lower than blood and minimal penetration into  the CNS 
and was then eliminated rapidly from the tissues. High concentrations were found in the stomach, 
intestine,  lung, liver, kidney and adrenal gland, but there was no evidence of high affinity melanin-
specific binding  of radioactivity in the pigmented tissues (pigmented skin and uveal tract). Levels of 
radioactivity in  the whole eye was persistent and the T1/2  was determined by liquid scintillation 
counting  (LSC) at 60 h.  
Assessment report  
EMA/549867/2021  
Page 33/164 
 
 
 
 
The tissue distribution  of total  radioactivity was also determined in female nude mice bearing 
subcutaneous Calu-6 xenografts after a single oral administration  of [14C]-selumetinib.  Systemic 
distribution  of radioactivity was similar in rat.  Tumour concentrations were lower than blood levels up 
to 12 hours post dose, however the radioactive concentration remained measurable in the tumour for 
longer than most other tissues. 
Metabolism 
The in vitro metabolism of selumetinib was evaluated in liver microsomes and hepatocytes of mouse, 
rat, dog, monkey and human and in  vivo in mice, rat, dog, monkey and human, respectively (studies 
KMN011,  BE000898-44,  BE000726-85,  KMX028, KMN012).   
In vitro experiments indicated Phase 1 metabolic reactions including oxidation of the side chain, N-
demethylation, and loss of the side chain to form amide and acid metabolites. The N-desmethyl 
metabolite was formed in hepatocyte incubations in human and mouse but  not in rat and monkey. The 
majority of metabolites were detected as glucuronide conjugates in vitro, indicating that  Phase 2 
conjugation is likely to be a significant route of elimination for selumetinib.  The major circulating 
metabolite M2  (selumetinib amide glucuronide[-2H])  in the human ADME study (YAU169)  was 
observed following incubation of selumetinib with  rat and human  hepatocytes, and in rat and mouse 
plasma. In study KMN012,  CYP3A4 was the predominant CYP isoform responsible for selumetinib 
oxidative metabolism with  CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1 and CYP3A5 also involved to a lesser 
extent. This was supported by evidence that  CYP3A4 is the principal isoform in formation of the 
imidazoindazole metabolite M10  which is intermediate in the formation of the major glucuronide 
metabolite M2  found in human plasma and urine (studies ADME-AZS-Wave3-150302, ADME-AZS-
Wave3-150422, 110331_CRP_kmnm633,  BE000021-21,  BS001696-61 and KMN045).  Formation  of the 
active N-desmethyl metabolite appeared primarily mediated by CYP2C19 with  in vitro evidence for 
contributions  from CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9 and CYP2C8. N-desmethyl metabolite is subsequently 
metabolised through  a similar pathway to selumetinib.  
The principal enzymes responsible for the in vitro metabolism of [14C]-selumetinib  by direct 
glucuronidation were investigated by incubation with  nine recombinant UGT enzymes. Formation of a 
single metabolite was extensive. After a 60-minute  incubation with  UGT1A1 and UGT1A3 this 
metabolite accounted for approximately 51.5 and 23.0%  of chromatogram radioactivity, respectively. 
No other UGT enzymes produced any peaks that were not present in  the corresponding controls. 
The dog has not  been used in safety pharmacology and toxicity studies. Only limited  “historical” in vivo 
data are available for this species. Selumetinib was shown to be metabolised by N-demethylation, loss 
of the side chain to  form the acid (M15)  and amide (M14)  metabolites, and direct conjugation with 
glucuronic acid (M4 or M7) as well as desfluorhydroxy selumetinib amide. Peak concentrations of N-
desmethyl selumetinib  (M8) were less than  3% of those of selumetinib in dog plasma. The plasma 
samples for metabolite identification were derived from study 0391KD.  
The cynomolgus monkey has been used as the non-rodent species in repeat-dose toxicity studies. The 
studies to investigate the metabolite profile in vivo in monkeys and the toxicokinetic investigations 
showed that the  metabolism of selumetinib to N-desmethyl selumetinib was very low or absent. 
Selumetinib amide was not  identified in the metabolism studies in monkeys but was detected in plasma 
samples of monkeys obtained from the 26-week repeat dose toxicity study at levels based on the 
AUC(0-12) on average 2.3% and 36.1% of those of selumetinib on Day 1 (Week 1) and Week 26, 
respectively. The major human metabolite M2  (selumetinib amide-glucuronide -2 atomic mass units) 
has not been definitely identified in  vivo in monkey metabolism studies.   
An additional in vitro study (BE002560-24)  has been conducted by the applicant to assess the 
formation of M2,  desfluorohydroxy selumetinib amide glucuronide and the N-desmethyl metabolite 
Assessment report  
EMA/549867/2021  
Page 34/164 
 
 
 
following incubation  of selumetinib in  mouse, rat, dog, monkey and human hepatocytes. The results of 
this study demonstrated the presence of M2 and the absence of the desfluorohydroxy AZD6244 amide 
glucuronide in all the other species including monkey. The active metabolite M8  (N-desmethyl 
selumetinib) was detected in mouse, dog and human hepatocytes, but not in  monkey or rat 
hepatocytes, a finding consistent  with  the earlier in vitro cross-species study (KMN011). 
Excretion 
Excretion balance has been performed in intact and bile  duct cannulated rats,  monkey and mouse. The 
studies  indicated that  fecal elimination  was the  dominant  route, whereas urinary excretion was minor. 
Biliary elimination  was  shown to  play  a major role in  bile  duct  cannulated  rats.  Excretion was  rapid in 
rodent (within  48h) but  longer in  monkeys (up to 120h). 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The oral route of administration was used in  all toxicology studies to match the intended clinical 
administration route, twice daily dosing in monkey, mouse and human; once daily dosing in rat. 
Single dose toxicity 
There were no adverse effects of selumetinib following  single oral doses to  SD rats  (up to  300 mg/kg). 
In monkeys, transient changes in clinical pathology parameters (liver, lymphoid system) were observed 
and the NOEL  was established at 30 mg/kg twice daily (studies 223-001  and 1638-213). 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Selumetinib free base 
Selumetinib free base was firstly developed and studied  in toxicity studies in SD rat and cynomolgus 
monkey. In this early development, two  studies were performed in rat (14-day and 28-days) and one 
in monkeys (28-day) with  selumetinib free base. 
In rat, selumetinib was administrated by oral gavage once a day (unlike the treatment in other species: 
mouse  and  monkey).  The  14-day  study  demonstrated  that  the  MTD  was  above 300  mg/kg/day  (the 
highest  dose  tested);  however,  no  Toxicokinetic  (TK)  analysis  was  performed  to  determine  the 
selumetinib  free  base  level.  In  29-day  study,  GI  tract  was  identified  as  the  main  target  organ  and 
mineralisation of the gastric mucosa was observed in all dose in males and ≥ 30 mg/kg/day in female; 
therefore no  NOAEL  was  determined  in  males  and  the  lowest  dose  10 mg/kg/day  was  determined  in 
females  as  the  NOAEL.  In  29-day  study  in  monkeys,  selumetinib  demonstrated  a  reversible  GI 
intolerability  but  no  NOAEL  was  therefore  determined.  The  later  development  was  performed  with 
selumetinb hyd-sulfate which is the form used in  human. 
Selumetinib hyd-sulfate 
In all pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies, animals were administrated selumetinib hyd-sulfate. The main 
target  organs of  toxicity  in  the  repeat dose studies  were  skin,  bone, GI  tract,  lower  urinary tract  and 
cornea.  Soft  tissue  mineralisation  was  noted  in  gastric  mucosa,  cornea,  kidney,  liver,  myocardium, 
skeletal muscle and stomach in  rodents. 
Mortality 
Selumetinib-related mortalities occurred in mice, rats and monkeys. 
In mice 7-day (>242  mg/kg BID), 1-month (≥103  mg/kg BID) and 26-week (20  mg/kg BID) repeat 
dose studies in  CD-1 mice (studies 0354DM,  0355DM and VKS/0211), administration  of selumetinib 
Assessment report  
EMA/549867/2021  
Page 35/164 
 
 
 
hyd-sulfate was not tolerated and resulted in mortality. Selumetinib-related mortality also occurred at 
100 mg/kg BID in CByB6F1 hybrid female mice in dose range finding (DRF)  for carcinogenicity 
assessment. The main cause of death in these animals was most likely due to microscopic changes in 
the gastrointestinal  tract. The mean exposure at which these deaths occurred were at least 28-fold the 
free AUC in humans at the MRHD   of 25  mg/m² BID. In the 26-week study in  mice, dosing of 
selumetinib hyd-sulfate at 20 mg/kg BID (similar exposure, around 28 x the free AUC in humans at the 
MRHD ) resulted in vascular engorgement of the corpus cavernosum of the bulbocavernosus muscle in 
male mice, which in  some animals resulted in obstruction  of the  urinary tract leading to premature 
deaths between Week 8 and 15. The mechanism underlying these changes is unknown. Premature 
deaths in this group also occurred between Weeks 11  to 25. These early deaths were also accompanied 
by a result of marked inflammatory changes in the large intestine,  in particular the colon and caecum, 
with  occasional perforation and occasional extension to  the serosa. 
In the 3-month  rat study (study 528088),  administration of selumetinib hyd-sulfate at 20 mg/kg/day 
in males and 25  or 50 mg/kg/day in females was not tolerated. All animals in these dose groups were 
euthanized (Days 26  or 30). The clinical signs responsible for death or euthanasia animals included 
multiple skin lesions and/or scabs in  the dorsal and abdominal regions, excessive grooming/scratching, 
fur erected/ungroomed and ploughing.  These deaths occurred at least 91-fold the  total  AUC in 
humans   at the maximum clinical dose of 25 mg/m² BID.  
In the 29-day monkey study ( 1639-213),  severe GI intolerance (persistent diarrhoea and/or dehydration 
) were observed  after selumetinib free base administration at 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg BID (similar exposure 
to that observed at the clinical total AUC). High volume of Captisol seems to enhance GI toxicity observed 
with  selumetinib.  In  an  MTD  study  in  monkeys (VKS/0153)  with  selumetinib  hyd-sulfate at  escalating 
doses,  one  male  was  euthanized  at  15  mg/kg  bid  after  10  days  administration  of  this  dose    with  GI 
intolerance. 
Skin  
In rat  studies,  dose-dependent skin lesions/scabs were observed in  females at doses ≥  25  mg/kg/day  
(160x  the total  clinical  AUC) for 14  days, in females at  ≥ 2.5  mg/kg/d (21x  the  total  clinical AUC) and 
males at ≥ 5  mg/kg/d (32  x the  total  clinical AUC) for 3 months  and these skin effects were correlated 
with  microscopic ulceration at high  doses. In 3-month  study,  NOAEL could be established only in males 
at 2.5 mg/kg/day, the calculated safety margin was 15 times the clinical total AUC. In the longest study 
(2-year  carcinogenicity  study)  dose  dependent  microscopic  findings  of  erosions/ulcers  in  skin  were 
observed in males at ≥ 0.8 mg/kg/day (5.5x the clinical total  AUC or equivalent to the clinical exposure 
for free AUC)  and ≥  1  mg/kg/day in  females (15x  the  clinical total  AUC or 2.9x  the  clinical free AUC), 
NOAEL  could  be established  in  males  at  0.25  mg/kg/d  and  in  females at  0.3 mg/kg/d,  the  calculated 
safety margin was 3 in female and there was no safety margin in  male.  
Gastrointestinal tract 
In mice, GI tract findings were observed after selumetinib administration at ≥ 11  mg/kg BID (19.5x 
the clinical free AUC) in 1-month  study and ≥ 1 mg/kg BID (2x the clinical AUC) in 26-week study.  No 
NOAEL could be determined and no safety margins could be calculated. These GI effects were 
characterised by focal ulceration, inflammation and/or mucosal hypertrophy in the caecum, focal 
colonic serositis, focal degeneration in duodenal Brunner’s glands; glandular epithelial cell 
degeneration and acute inflammatory cell infiltration  in stomach, glandular mucosal erosion/ulceration 
and inflammation and sub-mucosal and serosal inflammation. Similar selumetinib-related changes in 
the GI tract were seen in the 1-month  DRF study in males and in females CByB6F1 hybrid mouse at 
higher exposure.

In monkey, administration of selumetinib hyd-sulfate to monkeys for up to 26  weeks was also 
associated with  GI finding  and dose-limiting finding. Loose/liquid feces were observed at 1.5  mg/kg 
BID in females (similar to the clinical AUC) and at 4 mg/kg BID in males (7x the clinical free AUC). No 
corresponding histopathological changes in the GI tract  were observed. Diarrhoea was associated with 
signs of dehydration and/or body weight  loss requiring a brief dosing holiday or hydration intervention. 
There was evidence of recovery from the GI effects and the associated clinical pathology changes 
following a dosing holiday.  
Bone 
In 3-month  rat  study, microscopic findings were observed in  the femoro-tibial joint  at  a total  exposure 
at least 11-fold greater than the clinical free exposure at 25  mg/m² BID. In males dosed with 10  mg/kg 
BID selumetinib,  physis dysplasia was observed in the  femur and, in  females at 12.5  mg/kg BID, there 
was  decreased cellularity in  the  bone marrow of  the  femur adjacent  to  the  physis. Safety margins  for 
these effects were calculated at 6.1 in  males and 11.5 in females (free AUC). Physeal dysplasia was not 
observed in the  2-year rat carcinogenicity study at exposures around 2.9-  and 3.7-fold  greater than the 
clinical free AUC at 25 mg/m² BID in males and in females, respectively. 
Soft mineralisation 
Dose dependent soft tissue mineralisation (calcium) was observed in a variety of tissues in rats and 
mice. 
In mice, various tissues including  gastric mucosa, cornea, kidney, liver, myocardium, skeletal muscle 
and stomach were observed at dose levels ≥ 11 mg/kg BID (19.5x the  clinical free AUC) in the 1-
month study.  Mineralisation was associated with changes in plasma inorganic phosphate, calcium and 
albumin in both  species. Whilst similar biochemistry changes were observed in the 26-week study, 
tissue mineralisation was restricted to minimal multifocal mineralisation in the liver, in only a small 
number of animals at 20 mg/kg BID (28x the mean clinical free AUC). These findings were persistent 
after one-month recovery period in other tissues and after 13-weeks recovery in liver. No  NOAEL could 
have been determined in mice for this  toxic effect and no safety margins could have been calculated. 
Tissue mineralisation with  selumetinib has not been observed in monkey. 
In rats, soft tissue mineralisation was also noted in a number of organs stomach, kidney, aorta, heart, 
mesenteric lymph node, lung and tongue at doses ≥ 1mg/kg/day in males (7x clinical total  AUC or 
1.3x clinical free AUC) and ≥ 2.5 mg/kg/day in  females (21x clinical  total  AUC, or 4x clinical free 
AUC). Reversibility was not assessed in this study.  
Urinary lower tract 
Vascular engorgement of the  corpus cavernosum of the  bulbocavernosus muscle were observed in  26-
week  mice  at  a  dose  of  20  mg/kg  BID (28  times  the  free  AUC  in  humans  at  the  MRHD    leading  to 
significant  urinary  tract  obstruction  as  well  as  inflammation  and  luminal  haemorrhage of  the  urethra 
leading to early death in male mice. 
Cornea 
In 1-month  study in  mice, ophthalmology findings (oval opacities across the cornea, rough appearance 
to  the  surface  of  the  cornea) were  observed at  all  doses and  histopathologic  exam  revealed a  dose-
dependent mineralisation of  the cornea which  is not  reversible after cessation of treatment.  No  NOAEL 
was established and no safety margin could be determined. Moreover, in 26-week carcinogenicity study, 
eye was also a target organ since higher incidence of adenoma in Hardarian gland were observed at mid-
dose. Ocular malformations were also observed in reproductive toxicity studies. Finally, in correlation to 
these toxic effects, tissue distribution  study  demonstrated that  selumetinib was persistent in  the whole 
eye (T1/2 around 60h).

Genotoxicity 
A complete package of genotoxicity studies in agreement with the  ICH S2 (R1)  guideline, including 
tests for gene mutations  in bacteria and chromosomal aberrations in vitro and in vivo, was performed 
to assess the genotoxic potential of selumetinib.  
Selumetinib free base did not  induce mutations when adequately tested in  five histidine-requiring 
strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537  and E.coli WP2 uvrA) at 
concentrations up to 5000  μg/plate in the absence and in the presence of a rat liver metabolic 
activation system (S9). In the in vitro mammalian chromosome aberration test in mouse lymphoma 
cells, selumetinib free base was negative at dose levels up to 150  µg/mL. In the two in vivo 
chromosomal aberration test (micronucleus), selumetinib free base induced micronuclei in the bone 
marrow of ICR mice (2000  mg/kg single dose at  24h collection time) and CD-1 mice (at 1000  and 
2000  mg/kg at 24h  collection time, equivocal response at 500 mg/kg). A NOAEL was determined at 
160 mg/kg (Cmax =  68.2 µmol/L).   
Centromeric staining  was performed with  slides form the study performed with  selumetinib free base in 
mice. Approximately 60% of the  micronuclei were centromere positive at the two  clearly positive doses 
(1000  and 2000 mg/kg) suggestive of a threshold aneugenic mode of action. In the 26-week repeated 
dose study in  CD1-mice, the highest tested  dose (20 mg/kg BID) resulted in male at  Cmax = 29.6 
µg/ml, around 40-fold the Cmax at the intended recommended dose in paediatric patients (Cmax= 731 
ng/ml at 25  mg/m² BID). Comparison in term of exposure (total AUC) resulted in  the same ratio. The 
Cmax observed at NOAEL (160  mg/kg) after selumetinib free base (Cmax = 68.2 µmol/L  = 31 µg/ml) 
was similar. 
A third in vitro micronucleus assay was performed in CD1-mice with  selumetinib hyd-sulfate to ensure 
higher bioavailability. Selumetinib induced micronuclei in  the bone marrow from 121  mg/kg and above 
(2 doses 24h  apart). A NOAEL  was determined at 24 mg/kg; however, no TK analysis was performed. 
Bridging exposure at the dose of 23 mg/kg (11 mg/kg BID) from the 1-month toxicology study in the 
same mouse strain performed with selumetinib hyd-sulfate (0355AM)  yielded a mean total  AUC of 
56950  ng*h/mL and a mean free AUC of 627 ng*h/mL,  which  resulted in safety margins to the 
respective human AUCs at  the MRHD of 28.3-fold and 19.5-fold. 
Carcinogenicity 
Selumetinib was  administered to  male and female Wistar rats (2-year study)  daily at  0.25,  0.8,  or 2.5 
mg/kg/d  in  males and 0.1,  0.3,  or  1 mg/kg/d  in  females by oral  gavage (study  501094).  Selumetinib 
was not associated with  any neoplastic or pre-neoplastic findings at any dose level (up to x 2.9-3.7 fold 
the  clinical  free AUC,  females  and  males respectively). Selumetinib-related  non-neoplastic  alterations 
that  were considered to be adverse were sporadic incidences of skin erosions/ulcers which were present 
at  higher  incidence  and  severity  in  males  at  ≥ 0.8  mg/kg/day and  at  higher  severity in  females  at  1 
mg/kg/day. There was also a higher incidence of  erythrophagocytosis/erythrocytosis in the  mesenteric 
lymph node of males at 2.5 mg/kg/day. These findings were consistent with  histologic findings reported 
in the previous studies in  rat. 
Selumetinib was administered to male and female Tg.rasH2 mice by oral gavage at 3, 8, or 25/15  mg/kg 
twice  daily  (6,  16,  50/30  mg/kg/day)  for  6  months  (study  20086561).  The  maximum  dose  was    25 
mg/kg BID based on DRF studies but this  dose was reduced to 15  mg/kg BID from week 19 to  week 26 
due to unexpected toxicity consisting of mortality and body weight losses (undetermined cause of death). 
There were no changes in  the negative group  and there were expected changes in the  positive control 
group. No  increase in  the incidence of  any type of tumours in  the  selumetinib groups except an higher 
incidence of  adenoma in  Hardarian  gland  in  2  males  at  mid-dose  (8  mg/kg  BID,  2/25M,  8%)  but  this

higher  incidence  was  still  within  the  historical  control  values  (0-16%,  data  not  provided).  Therefore, 
selumetinib  was  not  carcinogenic in  CByB6F1/Tg rasH2  hemizygous mice  (up  to  x 16  –  24.3-fold  the 
clinical  free AUC, males  and females respectively). Selumetinib-related non-neoplastic  alterations  that 
were  considered to  be  adverse were  observed in  the  cecum  (crypt  hyperplasia in  males  and  females 
administered  ≥  8  mg/kg  BID),  colon  (crypt  hyperplasia  in  males  administered  ≥  3  mg/kg  BID  and 
females  administered  25/15  mg/kg  BID  and  diverticulum  in  males  and  females  administered  25/15 
mg/kg BID), and spleen (increased pigmented macrophages females administered ≥ 3 mg/kg BD).  
Reproduction Toxicity 
A full set of developmental and reproductive studies were conducted in mice, with  potential  effects on 
male fertility  evaluated in the 26-week chronic toxicity study.   
No effect on mating performance and fertility was reported at  up to 40 mg/kg/day in  male mice. 
Sperm parameters remained unaffected at  up to 10 mg/kg/day, the  maximal dose evaluated for that 
endpoint since males of the high dose group were euthanized prematurely. The safety margin for male 
fertility was > 22 based on free AUC levels. In females, mating  performance and fertility were not 
affected at doses up to 75 mg/kg/day, whereas a small reversible decrease in the number of live 
embryos was seen at ≥25 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for both  maternal toxicity and effects on 
reproductive performance was 5 mg/kg/day, corresponding to a safety margin of 3.5  based on free 
AUC levels. 
Dose-range finding and pivotal embryo-foetal development studies showed treatment-related 
embryolethality, foetotoxicity (decreased foetal weights,  delayed ossification), and teratogenicity at 
non-maternotoxic dose levels. In both studies, the  occurrence of foetuses with  open eye(s) was 
increased with  all foetuses affected at 75  mg/kg/day. The incidences of other ocular findings presented 
as minor malformations (folded retina, variation in consistency of lens) were also increased at 75 
mg/kg/day.  
In the pivotal study, the occurrence of foetuses with  open eye(s) was also reported in 3 litters  of the 
low dose group (5 mg/kg/day). This was observed in foetuses derived from dams incorrectly 
administered a dose level of 75  mg/kg/day and clearly associated with  causing this  change during the 
window of developmental sensitivity. The incidence of cleft palate was increased at 75 mg/kg/day in 
the pivotal study, at ≥25  mg/kg/day in the dose-range finding  study, and at ≥4 mg/kg/day in the  pre- 
and post-natal development study. Overall, a developmental NOAEL cannot  be determined for 
selumetinib in mice due to the occurrence of external malformations at ≥1 mg/kg/day (0.4-fold below 
the clinical free Cmax) in the PPND study.  In addition  to the external malformations detailed above, 
the latter study also showed a non-reversible decrease in pup growth  and a decrease in the number of 
pups meeting the criterion for pupil  constriction on PND21 at the non-maternotoxic dose level of 15 
mg/kg/day (6-fold clinical total  Cmax). Toxicokinetic evaluations reported excretion into maternal milk 
and pup exposure to both selumetinib and N-desmethyl selumetinib on lactation day 4. 
Treatment-related external malformations were reported at subclinical exposures, while there were 
safety margins of 3.5 to the clinical Cmax for embryolethal and foetotoxic effects. Pups exposed during 
gestation and lactation at 6-fold  clinical exposure (total  Cmax) were shown to  be affected by reduced 
growth and decreased ability to meet the criterion for pupil constriction  at weaning. There was no 
overall effect on male or female fertility.

Studies on impurities 
One identified  impurity did  not  generate any structural  alert in  SAR and the  response in the  Ames test 
was  weak.  Further  Ames  testing    was  conducted  in  line  with  the  recommendations contained  in  ICH 
S2(R1),  and  was  negative,  demonstrating  the  original  observed  effect  was  due  to  bacterial-specific 
nitroreductase metabolism. One identified  impurity demonstrated positive results in  GLP Ames test and 
is considered as Class 2 impurity as defined in ICH M7(R1) was identified as being mutagenic in an Ames 
test . 
An  Ames test,  conducted  in  accordance with  the  current  requested  guideline  and  GLP  regulation  was 
negative (draft unaudited report).One identified impurity has been predicted positive in silico and tested 
negative in an Ames test according to the applicant. Based on these data it is classified as non-mutagenic 
(Class 5) impurity. In addition, One identified impurity gave positive in silico (Q)SAR alerts. One impurity 
gave alerts in both models and thus is classified as class 3 in accordance with ICH M7(R1). It is controlled 
in the selumetinib hyd-sulfate manufacturing process in accordance with  ICH M7(R1) control option  4. 
Phototoxicity 
Selumetinib absorbs light in the UV range and showed enhanced cytotoxicity in the presence of UV light, 
in an in vitro 3T3 neutral red uptake phototoxicity test at 316 and 1000 μg/mL concentrations which are 
3- and 10-fold above the current ICH S10 (2013) recommended maximum concentration of 100 μg/mL. 
The positive phototoxicity result was seen at concentrations significantly greater (> 8000x) than the free 
clinical Cmax achieved at the maximum intended clinical dose of 25 mg/m² BID. The concentrations for 
the  in  vitro  phototoxicity  evaluation  with  selumetinib  were  selected  based  on  the  OECD  432  (2004) 
evaluation criteria which  was subsequently reduced from 1000  to  100  μg/mL  due to a high  percentage 
of positive results in the update of ICH  S10 (2015).  IC50 for selumetinib  were > 100  µg/ml.  Therefore, 
no clear phototoxic potential  was observed for selumetinib at  clinically relevant concentrations.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The submitted non-clinical studies were conducted in accordance with legal requirements, available 
guidelines. Scientific advices on non-clinical  developmental program has been received and the CHMP 
advice have been followed adequately. 
In in vitro assays, selumetinib was able to inhibit  the activity of purified MEK1 enzyme with  IC50 
values within  clinically relevant concentrations. The potency in these biochemical assays was confirmed 
to be similar to  the potency with  which  selumetinib inhibited RAF-MEK-ERK  signalling in a panel of 
tumour cell lines. The sequence and structures of MEK1  and MEK2  are highly homologous across 
species. Selumetinib has similar activity against MEK1  and MEK2 in inhibiting  the  phosphorylation of 
inactive ERK2. The potency of the N-desmethyl and amide metabolites of selumetinib have been 
tested. N-desmethyl metabolite was approximately 3 to 5-fold more potent  than selumetinib in 
inhibiting  ERK phosphorylation in tumour  cell lines, the amide metabolite was 18 – 50-fold less potent 
than selumetinib.  N-desmethyl metabolite (7% to the parent) may contribute  to efficacy and/or safety 
after administration of selumetinib to a minor extent but  it is unlikely that amide metabolite (2% to the 
parent) contribute to efficacy and/or safety after dosing with selumetinib. 
In in vivo studies, selumetinib was assessed in anti-tumour  efficacy model using human tumour 
xenografts (oncologic POC) and in genetically modified mouse models of neurofibroma type-1 in two 
studies. In this relevant POC, selumetinib resulted in inhibition  of ERK phosphorylation (40 - 60%)  and 
in reduction in number (up to 75%)  and size (up to  41%) of neurofibromas at dose close to  clinically 
relevant dose (in term of HED,  human equivalent dose). 
No off-targets were identified  at relevant human therapeutic plasma exposure levels of selumetinib or 
N-desmethyl selumetinib. 
No safety concerns have been identified in  the safety pharmacology studies conducted with selumetinib 
and its main metabolite N-desmethyl selumetinib at clinically relevant doses. Some minor findings 
included respiratory effects (airway resistance) but these are not considered to  be of clinical relevance. 
Some toxic effects were observed on GI system as observed in toxicity studies. 
The non-clinical absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion studies have been conducted in the 
same species as used in  the toxicology studies.  
Selumetinib was rapidly absorbed in all species studied with  Tmax occurring after 1-2h  in mice and 
monkeys and after 2-4h  in rat. The bioavailability of selumetinib after oral intake was determined only 
in monkey at 56 %.  The half-life T½ was determined at  3-7.6h in  mice, 2.95-11  h in monkeys after PO 
intake of selumetinib  hyd-sulfate and these values are similar as half-life seen in humans (6.2 h in 
paediatric patients  after the  intended recommended dose). No accumulation was observed in mice 
after repeated dose administration and low accumulation occurred in monkeys (max 1.9).  Sex-
differences were observed in mice; exposures were 2-fold higher in females while no sex-differences 
were observed in monkeys. N-desmethyl active metabolite was rapidly formed in mice around 2-20% 
in 26-weeks study and up to 30% in carcinogenicity study (T1/2 similar than the parent, no 
accumulation). Selumetinib amide was rapidly formed, around 2%, in mice, monkeys and rats (T1/2 
longer than the parent, no accumulation).

In all species selumetinib showed similar high protein binding  profile. The in vivo tissue distribution  in 
rat showed that selumetinib was widely distributed to  tissues and organs and was then  eliminated 
rapidly from the tissues. High  concentrations were found in the stomach, intestine,  lung, liver, kidney 
and adrenal gland. Levels of radioactivity in  the whole eye was persistent and the  T1/2 was determined 
by LSC at  60h. 
Selumetinib was metabolised through Phase 1 metabolic reactions including oxidation of the side chain, 
N-demethylation, and loss of the side chain to  form amide and acid metabolites. The majority of 
metabolites were detected as glucuronide conjugates, indicating that  Phase 2 conjugation is likely to 
be a significant  route of elimination for selumetinib. The major circulating metabolite M2  (selumetinib 
amide glucuronide[-2H])  in the  human ADME study  (YAU169) was observed following incubation  of 
selumetinib with  rat and human hepatocytes, and in rat and mouse plasma. CYP3A4 was the 
predominant CYP isoform responsible for selumetinib oxidative metabolism with  CYP2C9, CYP2C19, 
CYP2E1 and CYP3A5 also involved to a lesser extent. This is supported by evidence that  CYP3A4 is the 
principal isoform in formation of the imidazoindazole metabolite M10  which is intermediate in the 
formation of the  major glucuronide metabolite M2  found in human plasma and urine. Formation of the 
active N-desmethyl metabolite appears to be primarily mediated by CYP2C19 with  in vitro evidence for 
contributions  from CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9 and CYP2C8. 
In nonclinical species, selumetinib was excreted predominantly faeces, whereas urinary excretion was 
minor, as well as in human. 
In vitro pharmacokinetic drug interaction  studies were reported in section 2.4.2  of this report. 
The toxicological profile of selumetinib has been characterised via oral repeat-dose in rat initially and 
later in mice and monkeys (twice daily dosing in monkey, mouse and human; once daily dosing in rat).  
In all pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies, animals were administrated selumetinib hyd-sulfate. 
The main effects in mice, rats and monkeys seen after selumetinib exposure were in the  skin, GI tract 
and bones. Scabs associated with microscopic erosions and ulceration at a free exposure similar to the 
clinical exposure (free AUC) at the MRHD were seen in rats. Inflammatory and ulcerative GI tract 
findings associated with  secondary changes in the liver and lymphoreticular system at free exposures 
approximately 19.5 times the clinical free AUC at the MRHD  were observed in mice. Growth plate 
(physeal) dysplasia was seen in male rats dosed for up to 3 months  with selumetinib at  a free 
exposure 11 times the clinical free AUC at the MRHD.  GI findings showed evidence of reversibility 
following a recovery period.  
The skin effects were dose and time dependent and are relevant at clinical exposure. Reversibility for 
skin toxicities and physeal dysplasia was not  evaluated. Vascular engorgement of the corpus 
cavernosum of the  bulbocavernosus muscle were observed in male mice in a 26 week study at a dose 
of 40 mg/kg/day (28  times the free AUC in humans at the MRHD) leading to significant  urinary tract 
obstruction as well as inflammation and luminal  hemorrhage of the urethra leading to early death in 
male mice. The human experience showed no AE on erectile function and these effects cannot be 
explained by the pharmacology of selumetinib. 
In 1-month study  in mice, ophthalmology findings (oval opacities across the cornea, rough appearance 
to the surface of the cornea) were observed at all doses and histopathologic  exam revealed a dose-
dependent mineralisation of the cornea which  is not reversible after cessation of treatment. No  NOAEL   
and no safety margin could be determined. Moreover, in 26-week carcinogenicity study, eye was also a 
target organ since higher incidence of adenoma in hardarian gland were observed at mid-dose. Ocular 
malformations were also observed in reproductive toxicity studies. Finally, in correlation to these toxic 
effects, selumetinib was shown to  be persistent in the  whole eye (T1/2 around 60h) in tissue 
distribution  study.  An ophthalmological evaluation is recommended prior to treatment initiation  and at

any time  a patient  reports new visual disturbances as mentioned in SmPC section 4.4 ocular toxicity 
subsection.  
Dose dependent soft tissue mineralisation was observed after selumetinib administration  in a variety of 
tissues in rats and mice but  not in monkeys. These findings  were persistent after cessation of 
treatment and are consistent  with the  primary pharmacology of selumetinib and also observed with 
other MEK1/2  inhibitors. These effects could be considered relevant in  humans.  The applicant will 
collect calcium and phosphate from ongoing selumetinib clinical studies and will  monitor calcium and 
phosphate elevations during routine pharmacovigilance. Renal events will  be closely monitored in 
paediatric patients.   
The toxicological profile of selumetinib largely reflects the pharmacological action of the  compound and 
is consistent with  the reported findings  for other marketed MEK1/2  inhibitors. 
Aneugenic effects of selumetinb are known as pharmacological action of MEK inhibitors.  However, no 
neoplastic changes were observed in carcinogenicity studies supporting  the long-term treatment of 
children with  selumetinib. 
Selumetinib showed teratogenicity in  an embryo-toxicity study in mice at clinically relevant plasma 
exposures. A second species was not  used for investigating the potential  effects on embryo-foetal 
development, which  is acceptable in view of the toxicological findings reported in mice 
(embryolethality, teratogenicity).  The available data in mice point to potential  adverse effects on 
embryo-foetal and post-natal development at non-maternotoxic dose levels. Treatment-related 
external malformations (open eye) were reported at subclinical exposures, while there were safety 
margins of 3.5  to the clinical free Cmx for embryolethal and foetotoxic effects. Pups exposed during 
gestation and lactation at 6-fold  clinical exposure (total  Cmax) were shown to  be affected by reduced 
growth and decreased ability to meet the criterion for pupil constriction  at weaning.  
No specific juvenile toxicity studies have been conducted but  studies performed in sexually immature 
primates and younger mice cover the age of children from 12 years onwards. Therefore, concerning 
pharmacokinetics, exposure assessments at dose levels investigated in adults are considered to  be 
sufficient to evaluate exposures expected in the younger population, e.g. from 3 years onwards.  
Selumetinib was positive in the  mouse micronucleus study via an aneugenic mode of action.  The free 
mean exposure (Cmax) at the no observed effect level (NOEL)  was approximately 27-times greater than 
clinical free exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD)  of 25 mg/m2. 
Selumetinib is genotoxic and transfers into  breast-milk of lactating mice at concentrations 
approximately the same as in plasma of dams. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment 
with  selumetinib.  
In reproductive studies in mice, no effect on male or female fertility were reported.  
Several impurities have been tested for their genotoxic potential  and are controlled in  the 
manufacturing process in accordance with ICH M7(R1). 
Selumetinib was not carcinogenic in rats or transgenic mice.  
Selumetinib does not  present any phototoxic potential based on the  results of the phototoxicity  study. 
Considering the  provided ecotoxicological data, selumetinib  is not  expected to pose a risk to  surface 
water, groundwater and sediment. The active ingredient selumetinib formed a potentially very 
persistent transformation product in water sediment systems and during transformation in  sewage 
sludge. A terrestrial risk assessment was not required as the trigger value for adsorption to sewage 
sludge is not exceeded. The provided data on logDow in Phase I is suitable to  derive the conclusion 
Assessment report  
EMA/549867/2021  
Page 44/164 
 
 
 
 
that  selumetinib does not meet the PBT characteristics. In conclusion, selumetinib is not expected to 
pose a risk to  the environment when used in accordance with  the SmPC. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical data submitted support the use of selumetinib in the intended indication.  The MAH is 
recommended to submit the final audited GLP AMES report with AZ11129886  (4-bromo-2-
chloroaniline) (study 8466469)  as soon as the report is available. 
Based on a complete Phase II assessment it can be concluded that  no environmental effects are 
expected following the use of selumetinib.

Bioanalysis 
Throughout the  clinical development, different bioanalytical methods were used to  quantify selumetinib 
and its active metabolite N-desmethyl selumetinib in human plasma with K2EDTA as anticoagulant. The 
method 244HHP  was used to support the pivotal paediatric study 057 (SPRINT) and two phases 1 studies 
in healthy volunteers (ADME study 077 and relative bioavailability study 066), whereas method ANAHPP 
was  used  to  support  most  of  phase  I  studies  in  adult’s  healthy  volunteers  performed  in  adults  and 
methods  WMTD070,  WMTD133  were  used  exclusively for  adults’  patients.  These  methods  (including 
244HHP  in  the  target  paediatric  population)  allows  quantification  of  selumetinib  over a  concentration 
range of 2 ng/mL (LLoQ) to 2000 µg/mL and over a range of 2 to 500 ng/mL for N-desmethyl selumetinib 
in plasma samples.  
Pharmacokinetic analysis 
For  single  or multiple-dose  studies,  PK  parameters evaluated  in  plasma  include  Cmax,  Tmax, AUC0-t, 
AUC0-12, AUC0-∞, AUC%extra, RAUC, T1/2, λz, CL/F,  Vz/F,  Vss/F, MAT, MRT,  MRAUC, MRCmax, CL, Vss, Vz PK 
parameters evaluated in urine include Ae, CLr, and fe.  
Standard non-compartmental (model-independent) pharmacokinetic methods were used to calculate PK 
parameters. 
A Population (Pop) PK analysis was performed based on data collected over 13 clinical studies (10 Phase 
I  studies  in  healthy  subjects,  2  Phase  I  monotherapy studies  in  patients  with  advanced cancer and  1 
Phase I/II study in children and young adults with NF-1  and inoperable PN (pivotal study D1532C00057, 
SPRINT). 
Plasma  concentration-time  data  were  analysed  using  a  non-linear  mixed  effects  modelling  approach 
(non-linear  mixed  effects  modelling  software  [NONMEM],  Version 7.3  or  greater).  Post-processing of 
NONMEM  analysis  results  was  carried  out  in  R  version  3.2.4  or  greater.  The  first-order  conditional 
estimation method with  between and within  subjects random effect interaction (FOCE INTER)  was used 
for  NONMEM  computations.  NONMEM  run  execution,  bootstrap,  VPC,  automated  SCM  building  was 
carried out using PsN,  version 4.4 or greater. 
Absorption  
Selumetinib 
Following single or multiple-dosing of selumetinib at doses between 25 mg to 75 mg in adults the median 
Tmax  was  1 
to  1.5h  (Studies  D1532C00005,  D1532C00083,  D1532C00082,  D1532C00081,

After a single  dose of 75  mg,  in  healthy volunteers Cmax ranged from 1150 ng/mL  to  1520  ng/mL,  in 
adult  patients  Cmax ranged from  1207  to 1365  ng/mL.  After multiple  dose of 75  mg in  adult  patients, 
Cmax,ss was 1439 ng/mL (29% CV).  
In  the  pediatric  patients,  after  single  dose  of  selumetinib  from  20  to  30  mg/m2,  PK  parameters are 
presented in Table 11 below.

a. Geometric mean, GCV% geometric coefficient of variation, b Median (range), c Arithmetic mean (SD), d AUC0-12 
At the recommended dose of 25  mg/m2 in the pediatric patients, geometric mean Cmax was estimated 
at 731  ng/mL with  a median Tmax of 1.5 h. 
N-desmethyl selumetinib 
In the SPRINT Phase I/II study (paediatric patients) and in  healthy volunteers, the median Tmax of the 
active metabolite N-desmethyl selumetinib was rapid and ranged from 1 to 1.5 h. 
Following  a  single  75  mg  dose  of  selumetinib  capsules to  healthy  volunteers and  adult  patients,  the 
geometric mean Cmax of N-desmethyl selumetinib ranged from 88 to 106  ng/mL and 67 to 78 ng/mL.  
In  the  pediatric patients,  after single  dose of  selumetinib  from 20  to  30  mg/m2,  PK parameters of  N-
desmethyl selumetinib  are presented in Table 12 below.

At the recommended dose of 25 mg/m2 in the pediatric patients,  geometric mean Cmax of N desmethyl 
selumetinib was estimated at 54 ng/mL  with a median Tmax of 1.5 h. 
Absolute bioavailability 
The  absolute  bioavailability  of  selumetinib  was  estimated  at  around  62.1%  (90%  CI:  60.1  -  64.1) 
following  an  oral  dose  of  75  mg  selumetinib  capsule  formulation  (3x25  mg)  in  the  fasted  state  and 
intravenous administration  of approximately 80 µg  (~ 1 µCi) of [14C]-selumetinib.   
Metabolite ratio based on AUC or Cmax was 7.68% and 6.32%  respectively.

Relative  bioavailability  /Bioequivalence 
Two selumetinib capsule strengths (10 mg white and 25 mg blue) have been used in the SPRINT clinical 
study. 
However,  initially  a  25  mg  white  capsule  was  developed  and  used  during  the  adult  patient  study 
D1532C00005.  Then a  25  mg  blue  capsule was  introduced during  this  study.  The 25  mg  blue  capsule 
was used in all the  studies pertaining to the  clinical pharmacology program. In order, to  bridge the  two 
25  mg  capsules (white  and blue),  a  relative bioavailability study  (Study  D1532C0066)  was  performed 
from which results demonstrated similarity in terms of AUC only with  a 90% CI geometric LS mean ratio 
of 80.09-100.  For Cmax, the  90% CI for the geometric LS mean ratio was 71.75-102.32%. 
Influence of food 
In study  DC1532C0069,  the effect of  a high fat  meal on selumetinib  PK was investigated in  32 healthy 
volunteers  who  were  administered a  single  oral  dose  of  75  mg  selumetinib  in  the  fasted  and  the  fed 
states. PK results indicated that administration  of a high  fat meal delayed the  absorption of selumetinib 
and N-desmethyl selumetinib with  median Tmax delayed from 1h  in the fasted state  to 2.5  h in the  fed 
state. In the fed state the AUC and Cmax of selumetinib was 16% and 50% lower compared to the fasted 
state. For N-desmethyl selumetinib the AUC and Cmax decreased similarly by 14% and 47% respectively.  
In  study DC1532C00020,  the  effect of  a high  fat meal  on selumetinib  PK  was investigated  in  34  adult 
patients who were administered a single oral dose of 75 mg selumetinib in the fasted and the fed states. 
PK results indicated that  administration  of a high fat  meal delayed the absorption of selumetinib and N-
desmethyl selumetinib with  median Tmax delayed from 1h in the fasted state to 4 h in the fed state. In 
the fed state the AUC and Cmax of selumetinib was 19% and 62% lower compared to the fasted state.  
In  study DC1532C0089,  the  effect of a  low  fat  meal on selumetinib  PK was  investigated in  24  healthy 
volunteers who were administered a single oral dose of 50 mg selumetinib capsule in the fasted and the 
fed states. PK results indicated that administration of a low fat meal delayed the absorption of selumetinib 
and N-desmethyl selumetinib with  median Tmax delayed from 1.15h  in the fasted state to 2 h in the fed 
state. In the fed state the AUC and Cmax of selumetinib was 38% and 60% lower compared to the fasted 
state.  
Distribution 
Based on in  vitro investigations (Study  KPJ003), Selumetinib was found  to be highly  bound (98.4%)  to 
human plasma proteins. The unbound fraction was independent of selumetinib concentration. In addition, 
selumetinib  mostly  binds  to  serum  albumin  (96.1%)  compared  to  α-1  acid  glycoprotein (<  35%).  N-
desmethyl selumetinib  was also found to be highly bound (97.9%). 
In the human AME study (Study D1532C0077), the blood-to-plasma radioactivity ratios was determined 
to  be  0.6-0.69,  suggesting  lack of meaningful  distribution  of Selumetinib  into  blood  cells. Based on  in 
vitro investigation (Study KPJ003), B/P ratio ranged from 0.55-0.71. 
Following  IV  dosing,  in  healthy  volunteers  the  selumetinib  volume  of  distribution  at  steady  state  in 
plasma  was  59.8  L,  whereas  following  oral  dosing  the  apparent  distribution  volume  was  170  L,  thus 
indicating  high distribution  in tissues. 
Following  oral  dosing  in  adult  patients  with  advanced solid  malignancies  (Study  DC15320005)  Vss/F 
ranged from 89 to 125  L after a 75  mg dose. 
In paediatric patients Vz/F ranged from 78 to 171 L with  dose ranging from 20 to 30 mg/m2, in line with 
the results obtained in healthy volunteers and adult patients.

Elimination 
The  excretion  and  biotransformation  of  [14C]-selumetinib  were  investigated  in  a  formal  AME  study 
(D1532C0077)  in 6  male healthy  subjects following  a single  oral dose of 75  mg  selumetinib (3x25  mg 
capsule) incorporating 610  µCi of [14C]-selumetinib. 
The  overall  recovery of  radioactivity  was  high  (92.8%  ±  1.09%),  with  59.3%  ±  10.2%  of  the  dose 
recovered in faeces and 33.8 % ± 8.49% recovered in urine. Approximately 19% of [14C]-AZD6244 was 
recovered unchanged in  faeces, whereas less than  1%  was  recovered unchanged in  urine. (see Figure 
2) 
Figure 2: Mean cumulative excretion, in percentage of radioactive dose, in urine and faeces following an 
oral dose of 75 mg 14C- selumetinib 
Metabolite  profiling was performed (Study  YAU69) following  oral dose and more than  90%  and 83% of 
the recovered radioactivity in urine and faeces respectively was identified.  
Selumetinib  appears to  undergo  extensive metabolism  (Figure  3).  Renal clearance of selumetinib  was 
estimated  at  0.084-0.093  L/h  (Study  D1532C0081,  D1532C0082)  and  1.54-2.15  L/h  for N-desmethyl 
selumetinib.  
Fifteen (15)  metabolites were identified in plasma, urine and feces.

Figure 3: Proposed metabolic pathways of selumetinib 
Based  on  in  vitro  investigations  using  human  recombinant  CYP  enzymes  (Study  BS001696-61), 
selumetinib  was  found  to  be  predominantly  metabolized  by  CYP3A4 (85%)  and  to  a  lesser extent  by 
CYP3A5, 2C19, 2D6,  2C9 and 2E1. M8  (N-desmethyl  selumetinib) formation is predominantly mediated 
by CYP2C19 with  lesser contributions  from CYP1A2, 2A6 and 2C9.  Glucuronidation is a significant route 
of elimination for selumetinib phase 1 metabolites to form glucuronide conjugates involving several UGT 
isoforms (mainly UGT1A1 and 1A3).  
Overall the relative contribution  of CYP and UGT were 56%  and 29% respectively based on in vitro data. 
In addition, Selumetinib  showed no inhibition  on CYP1A2, 2A6,   2C8, 2C19 and 2E1,  , but  was found to 
be a  weak inhibitor  of  CYP2C9, 2B6,  2D6  and 3A4.  Time  dependent  inhibition  at  10  to  50  µM  was  not 
observed  for 2C8,  2C9,  2D6 and 3A4/5.  Weak time dependent inhibition  at 50  µM  was observed with 
CYP1A2, 2B6 and 2C19. 
In adult patients, the mean terminal half-life ranged from 5.3 to 7.8 h. In healthy volunteers, across the 
studies, mean terminal half-life ranged from 4 to 21  hours across the  dose range of 25 mg to 75  mg. 
In pediatric patients at the recommended dose of 25 mg/m2 (see Table 13), mean terminal half-life was 
estimated at 6.2 h. 
The  mean apparent  clearances (CL/F)  for  selumetinib  in  healthy  volunteers ranged  from  15.5  to  21.1 
L/h.  In adult  patients after MD of 75 mg BID, CL/F ranged from 12.2  to 18.8  L/h.  
In pediatric patients, at the recommended dose of 25 mg/m2, CL/F  was estimated at 8.8 L/h. 
Pharmacokinetic of metabolites 
Assessment report  
EMA/549867/2021  
Page 54/164 
 
 
 
 
Following  oral dosing of 14C-selumetinib to healthy male subjects, unchanged selumetinib (~40% of the 
radioactivity)  with  other  metabolites  including  glucuronide  of  imidazoindazole  metabolite  (M2;  22%), 
selumetinib glucuronide (M4; 7%), N-desmethyl selumetinib (M8; 3%), and N-desmethyl carboxylic acid 
(M11;  4%)  accounted  for  the  majority  of  the  circulating  radioactivity  in  human  plasma.  N-desmethyl 
selumetinib  represents less than  10% of selumetinib  levels in  human plasma but  is approximately 3  to 
5  times  more  potent  than  the  parent  compound,  contributing  to  about  21%  to  35%  of  the  overall 
pharmacologic activity. 
Across all the studies in adult, metabolite to parent ratio ranged from 5.9 to 7.7%.  In pediatric subjects, 
at  steady  state,  conversion to  the  N-desmethyl  selumetinib  from  parent  was  low  with  with  geometric 
mean metabolite to  parent ratios of 6.06% for Cmax and 6.52%  for AUClast, respectively. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality 
Based on pooled PK data from healthy volunteers, dose proportionality was observed from 25 mg to 75 
mg, with  estimated slope of 0.99 and 1.01  respectively for AUC and Cmax, using a power model. 
In adult  patients,  from 25  mg to  100  mg,  Cmax and  AUC increased dose proportionally. For  paediatric 
patients,  an increase in selumetinib  exposure (AUC) from 20 mg/m² to  25 mg  / m² dose, from 25 mg/ 
m²  to  30  mg/m²  dose,  and  from 20  mg/m²  to  30  mg/  m² dose  was  1.19,  1.09  and 1.3,  respectively 
(study SPRINT). 
Time dependency 
Only  patients  received  multiple  dose  of  selumetinib,  therefore  information  on  time  dependency was 
retrieved from Study D1532C00005  and the SPRINT study. 
For adult and paediatric patients, based on the  terminal half-life, steady state would be expected to be 
achieved after 3  days of BID dosing. In Study D1532C00005,  AUC for selumetinib  was similar after 
single (Day 1) and multiple (Day 8) dosing over time after BID dosing, consistent  with the  terminal 
half-life observed (AUC ratio Day 8/Day 1 ~1.2  to 1.5  at all doses in study D1532C00005). 
Inter and Intra-individual  variability 
Assessment of  intra-subject  and  IIV  for  Cmax and  AUC  from  single  doses  of  75  mg  selumetinib  was 
determined  in  study  D1532C0066.  Cmax  and  AUC  intra-subject  variability  was  34%  and  17% 
respectively. Across patients  studies,  IIV in  exposure was  moderate to  high,  with %CV  of  40  to  68%, 
and 26 to 50% for Cmax and AUC respectively. In healthy subjects, IIV in exposure was marginally less 
variable, with  33 to  48%, and 20 to  32.5% for Cmax and AUC respectively. In paediatric patients  at 25 
mg/m², IIV of AUC and Cmax were 35 and 62%,  respectively. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
In  paediatric  patients,  after  single  dose  of  25  mg/m2  the  geometric  mean  AUC  was  2009  ng.h/mL. 
Minimal  accumulation of ~1.1  fold was observed at steady state  upon twice daily dosing. 
Special populations 
Evaluation of  selumetinib PK in  special populations  was based either on formal dedicated PK studies  or 
on the PopPK analysis. 
Impaired hepatic function 
Assessment report  
EMA/549867/2021  
Page 55/164 
 
 
 
A formal dedicated study (D1532C0082) investigating the effect of various degree of hepatic impairment 
according to  the Child-Pugh classification on PKs of selumetinib was performed. 
Adult  subjects with  normal hepatic function  (n =  8) and mild  hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A, n  = 8) 
were dosed with  50 mg selumetinib,  subjects with  moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh  B, n =  8) 
were administered a 50  or 25  mg dose, and  subjects with  severe hepatic impairment  (Child-Pugh  C, n 
=  8) were administered a 20  mg dose. Selumetinib total  dose normalised AUC and unbound  AUC were 
86% and 69% respectively, in mild hepatic impairment patients, compared to the AUC values for subjects 
with  normal hepatic function.  Selumetinib exposure (AUC) was higher in patients  with  moderate (Child-
Pugh  B)  and severe (Child-Pugh  C)  hepatic  impairment;  the total  AUC  and  unbound  AUC  values were 
159%  and  141%  (Child-Pugh  B)  and  157%  and  317%  (Child-Pugh  C),  respectively, of  subjects  with 
normal hepatic function (see SmPC section 4.2).  There was a trend of lower protein  binding in  subjects 
with  severe hepatic impairment although the  protein binding remained > 99%  (see SmPC section 4.3). 
PK data from specific cohorts including PK data in mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment patients 
from the  dedicated study D1532C0082  were excluded from the Pop PK analysis.  
Impaired renal function 
A formal dedicated study (D1532C0081)  investigating  the effect of various degree of renal impairment 
on PKs of selumetinib was performed. 
The exposure of 50 mg oral selumetinib was investigated in adult subjects with normal renal function (n 
=  11)  and  subjects with  end stage  renal disease (ESRD) (n  =  12).  The ESRD group  showed 16%  and 
28%  lower Cmax and AUC,  respectively, with  the fraction  of unbound selumetinib  being 35%  higher in 
ESRD subjects. As a  result, the  unbound  Cmax and AUC ratios  were 0.97  and 1.13  in  the  ESRD group 
when compared to the  group with  normal renal function.  A small increase, approximately 20%  AUC, in 
the  N-desmethyl  metabolite  to  parent  ratio  was  detected  in  the  ESRD  group  when  compared  to  the 
normal group.  
PK data  from specific cohorts  including  PK data in  end stage  renal disease patients  from the  dedicated 
study D1532C0081  were excluded from the Pop PK analysis. 
Gender 
No  formal  PK study  to  investigate  the  effect  of  gender on  the  PKs  of  selumetinib  and/or  its  active  N-
desmethyl metabolite was submitted.  The effect of gender on the PKs of selumetinib was investigated in 
patients based on the Pop PK approach.  
Based on the results of the final Pop PK model, gender was not found to have an effect on PK parameters 
of selumetinib and/or its  active N-desmethyl metabolite. 
Race 
A formal  dedicated study  (D1532C0086)  investigating  the  effect  of race (Asian)  on PKs  of selumetinib 
was performed. 
The geometric mean ratio (90% CI) of the AUC and Cmax normalised by dose and body weight between 
Chinese and Western population  were 1.19  (1.03,  1.38)  and  1.17  (0.92,  1.48),  respectively. Similarly, 
the  differences of  mean  PK exposure (AUC  and  Cmax) between  Japanese and  Western  subjects  were 
reduced  from  approximately 1.6-1.8-fold  higher  to  approximately  1.4-  to  1.7-fold  higher  after  body 
weight  or BSA normalization. 
Based on the  results of the final Pop PK model, race was found to  have a significant effect covariate on 
selumetinib  CL  and  consequently on  the  systemic  exposure (AUCss)  with  a  19%  reduction  for  Asians 
compared to non-Asians.

Weight/BSA 
The effect of weight on the PKs of selumetinib was investigated in  paediatric patients based on a pooled 
Pop PK analysis. 
BSA was identified  as  a significant  covariate impacting  clearance (CL)  and volumes of  distribution  (V2 
and V3) for selumetinib and Fm/V4 parameter for N-desmethyl selumetinib and therefore retained in the 
final  Pop PK model.  BSA was  related to  CL,  V2, V3  and  Fm/V4  following estimated  exponents of  0.97, 
1.57,  0.97,  -1.0,  respectively,  where  selumetinib  clearance  (parameter  driving  exposure)  increases 
proportionally to  BSA (exponent  is 0.97).  For  a typical  child  10  years old, CL  decreases by  more than 
30% with a BSA 0,7 m² (extreme low 5% of the observed BSA distribution) by comparison to the typical 
value of CL observed with a reference BSA of 1m². In contrast, CL increases by 75% with  a BSA of 1,83 
m²  (extreme  upper  95%  of  the  observed BSA distribution)  by  comparison to  the  typical  value  of  CL 
observed with a reference BSA of 1m².  
Based on  these findings,  an individualised dose based on BSA was proposed in  paediatrics. Among the 
3  levels of  doses  tested  in  the  SPRINT  Phase  I  study,  the  30  mg/m²  BID  dose  was  declared  as  not 
tolerated clinically (see section 2.5.1). Then, the 25 mg/m² BID dose was identified as the recommended 
dose in  paediatric patients. The posology of BSA based dosing is shown in Table 13.

The final Pop PK model was used to simulate 1000  individual steady-state AUC0-12h  for each BSA band 
in paediatric patients aged 3  to 18 years old. The results are visualised in Figure 4.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The ability of selumetinib to be a direct and time-dependent inhibitor of the main CYP enzymes CYP1A2, 
2B6,  CYP2C8,  CYP2C9,  2C19,  2D6  and 3A4,  with  a range  of  concentrations  from 0,05  to  70  µM,  was 
investigated and results are presented below. 
▪ CYPs inhibition  by selumetinib 
Results  from  studies  KMX10,  ADME-AZS-Wave3-150511  and  ADMEAZS-Wave3-150512  show  that,  at 
the  highest  tested concentrations  of 50µM  and  70µM,  direct  inhibition  by selumetinib  was observed on 
CYP1A2, 2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 2C19,  2D6 and 3A4 but with IC50 values > 40µM. Notwithstanding the 
lack  of  Ki  measure,  this  is  far  higher  than  the  worst  estimated  concentrations  of  selumetinib  at  the 
systemic level, i.e. 1,2 µM  and 1,75  µM  for the dose of 25  mg and 50  mg, respectively.  
As  regards  CYP3A4,  according  to  results  from  study  KMX010,  an  IC50  value  could  not  be  calculated 
whereas, from other  studies  ADME-AZS-Wave3-150511 and  ADMEAZS-Wave3-150512, the  estimation 
of R1gut  =1 +  [Igut]/Ki  for both nifedipine and midazolam, provided a value of 13,5   which  is superior 
to  the  cut-off  value  of 11,  indicating  drug-drug  interaction  (DDI) risk  at  the  intestinal  level  cannot  be 
ruled out. 
Selumetinib is a time-dependent inhibitor for CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 with KI values=15,2 µM and 57,5 µM, 
respectively, which are higher than selumetinib worst expected concentrations at systemic level (i.e. 1,2 
µM  and 1,75  µM  at the dose of 25 mg/m² and 50  mg/m² respectively). 
No time-dependant inhibition (TDI) was observed on CYP2D6, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 by selumetinib. Study 
BS002913-68  assessed  the  time-dependent  inhibition  potential  of  selumetinib  toward  CYP2B6  and 
CYP2C8. No TDI was observed against CYP2C8 but a minor effect was observed on CYP2B6 (25.7%  TDI) 
at 50  µM. An additional investigation  to better characterise this signal as part of a second in vitro study 
BS002913-81  was  made and to  estimate KI  and Kinact for CYP2B6. Selumetinib  exhibited a  TDI in vitro 
with  a KI=36µM and Kinact=0, 0165  min-1. 
CYPs inhibition  by N-desmethyl metabolite 
The  potential  for  the  N-metabolite  to  impact  CYP activities  (study  KMX015)  was  investigated.  Results 
showed  that  neither  direct  nor  time-dependent  inhibition  due  to  the  main  selumetinib  metabolite  N-
desmethyl are expected at clinically relevant concentrations.   
CYP1A2, 2B6 and 3A4 induction  by selumetinib 
Two studies were carried out to assess the ability of selumetinib to induce CYP1A2, 2B6 and 3A4: KMX042 
and study 1408211. The study KMX042 investigated selumetinib inducing potential by measuring enzyme 
activities.  
The  study  1408211  assessed selumetinib  induction  on  CYP1A2,  2B6  and  3A4  in  primary  cultures  of 
human hepatocytes by mRNA measurements. No signal of CYP1A2 and CYP2B6 induction  was observed 
at  concentrations  expected at  therapeutic  level.  For  CYP2B6,  conversely, a  2-fold  increase  of  mRNA 
occurred at 100µM.   
Based on the relative induction  score (RIS) correlation method, selumetinib is a CYP3A4 inducer. 
Impact on UGTs 
Assessment report  
EMA/549867/2021  
Page 58/164 
 
 
 
Selumetinib is also glucuronidated by UGT1A1 and to a lesser extent by 1A3. Any inhibition or induction 
of these enzymes is expected to have an impact on selumetinib. A clinical DDI study has been performed 
with  rifampicin (see in  vivo part)  but  not  with  an  inhibitor  such  as atazanavir or imatinib.  The relative 
contribution to selumetinib turnover by CYP and UGT enzymes was investigated in cryopreserved human 
hepatocytes (Study BE000021-21).  Results indicated that CYP mediated metabolites contributes 56% to 
the overall metabolism of selumetinib  and UGT to 29%. 
The  impact  of  selumetinib  on  UGT1A3,  UGT1A4,  UGT1A6,  and  UGT1A9,  was  assessed through  two  in 
vitro DDI studies: BS002913-69  for UGT1A9 and BS002913-80 for UGT1A3, UGT1A4, and UGT1A6.  
Based on the observed data, selumetinib inhibits UGT1A3, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, and UGT1A9 but their IC50 
values  of  24.7,  154,  126  µM  and  235  µM,  respectively,  were  far  higher  than  the  worst  expected 
concentration  at  the  systemic level considering  results  of the  R  value estimations  ([Imax,u]  /  Ki) from 
the basic method. 
Interactions related to efflux transporters and uptake transporters 
In vitro studies suggest that  selumetinib is a substrate for the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), 
P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporters and does not inhibit  the P-gp but  is a weak inhibitor of BCRP. 
Selumetinib  is not  an  OATP1B1 and  OATP1B3 substrate. Selumetinib  inhibited  OATP1B1 and  OATP1B3 
with  an  IC50=8,76  µM  and  19µM,  respectively.  IC50  values  were  upper  than  the  worst  expected 
concentrations at  the  portal  vein level, i.e.  3,75  µM  and  6,5  µM  for the  corresponding doses of 25  mg 
and 50 mg.  
Selumetinib  did  not  inhibit  OCT1  at  the  tested  concentrations  and  was  not  a  substrate  of  this  uptake 
transporter. The potential  inhibitory effect of selumetinib  on the renal uptake transporters OAT1, OAT3 
and OCT2, and on the efflux transporters MATE-1  and MATE-2K  was investigated. Selumetinib inhibited 
OAT3 with an IC50 0,84 µM. IC50 value was lower than the worst expected concentrations of selumetinib 
at the systemic level (50*Cmax,u), i.e. 1,2 µM  and 1,75 for selumetinib dose of 25 mg and 50 mg.  
Selumetinib  also  inhibited  in  vitro  MATE1,  MATE-2K  and  OCT2  with  an  IC50 =  46,4  µM,  82,4  µM  and 
5,64  µM, respectively. 
In silico 
PBPK modelling was applied to estimate the effects of moderate CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 inhibitors  as well 
as  the  effect  of  mild  and  moderate inducers  of  CYP3A4.  The  results  are summarised  in Figure  5.  Co-
administration  of  moderate  inhibitors  of  CYP3A4  and  CYP2C19  were  estimated  by  PBPK  modelling  to 
increase the  exposure of  selumetinib  1.3  to  1.4-fold.  The mild  inducer dexamethasone and  moderate 
inducer efavirenz were predicted not  to affect the  exposure to selumetinib  and to  decrease exposure by 
38%, respectively.

Qualification of the PBPK platform 
Based on the  data provided, the  PBPK platform is considered qualified to evaluate the  effect of CYP3A4 
modulators on selumetinib exposure.  
Sensitivity analysis 
Sensitivity  analyses were  made  with  the  protein  binding  fu,  CYP3A4 and  CYP2C19  Ki  for  inhibition  by 
itraconazole and fluconazole, and IndC50 for induction by rifampicin as well as selumetinib fm for CYP3A4 
and CYP2C19.  
In  summary,  as  regards  itraconazole  Ki  values,  for  both  selumetinib  predicted  Cmax  and  AUC  ratio 
changes were minor in the  range of  Ki tested. Similar results were observed with  fluconazole Ki values 
tested.  A sensitivity analysis was applied by changing CYP3A4 IndC50 from 0.032  to  3.2 μM.  The Cmax 
ratio or AUC ratio increased rapidly as the IndC50 value increased for CYP3A4, indicating this is a sensitive 
parameter in the model.  
A CYP3A4  fm of 25%  provided a reasonable AUC ratio  prediction  for the  itraconazole interaction  (1.52 
predicted versus 1.49  observed) and a CYP3A4 fm of 15%  provided a reasonable Cmax ratio prediction 
for the  itraconazole interaction.  However, a  fm of 25%  for  CYP3A4 was applied  in  the  current PBPK to 
consider the  “worst”  case scenario.   For  CYP2C19 contribution,  a  fm of  15%  could  provide reasonable 
predictions for both  AUC and Cmax ratio for the  fluconazole interaction, therefore a fm of 15%  was used 
in the model.  The Applicant conducted additional sensitivity analysis on selected parameters subject to 
variability: fu, Ki, IndC50 and fm to support the  robustness of the PBPK model. 
Impact of time  interval 
Assessment report  
EMA/549867/2021  
Page 60/164 
 
 
 
 
The impact of timing intervals was also evaluated between administration of selumetinib and strong and 
moderate CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 inhibitors by using PBPK modelling. The simulations predicted AUC and 
Cmax  ratio  of  selumetinib  administered  simultaneously,  or  4,  8  and  12  hours  after  itraconazole  or 
fluconazole and data show similar results as those observed when drugs are given concomitantly. 
Active metabolite and PBPK 
The  active  selumetinib  metabolite  was  shown  to  be  about  3  to  5  times  more potent  than  the  parent 
compound and to contribute about 21% to 35% of the overall pharmacologic activity (see section 2.3.3). 
Additional  simulations  integrating  selumetinib  metabolite  PK  with  or  without  itraconazole,  fluconazole 
and  rifampicine  were  conducted.  The  predicted  Cmax  and  AUC  ratios  of  selumetinib  metabolite  were 
within  0.6 to  1.5-fold of the observed values.  
Impact of a CYP3A4 and CYP2C9/2C19  inhibitor  
A  PBPK  modeling  and  simulation  was  performed  with  voriconazole  as  both  a  CYP3A4  and  CYP2C19 
inhibitor.  Results  predicted  an  increase of  selumetinib  AUC  ratio  about  65%  which  is  higher  than  the 
predicted and observed AUC ratio with itraconazole, about 52% and 49%, respectively. 
Concomitant  use  of erythromycin (moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor)  or fluoxetine  (strong  CYP2C19/CYP2D6 
inhibitor)  is predicted to increase selumetinib AUC by ~30-40%  and Cmax by ~20%. 
Impact of combined UGT1A1 and CYP3A4 inhibition 
PBPK simulations of the impact of a combined UGT1A1 and CYP3A4 inhibitor showed a predicted increase 
of selumetinib exposure about 63%, slightly higher the predicted increase with itraconazole, about 52%.   
Impact of  
In vivo 
Based on in  vitro  data,  two  clinical interaction  studies  were conducted  to  assess the  magnitude of  the 
potential interactions with  selumetinib: 
- the effect of itraconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor,  and fluconazole, a moderate CYP3A inhibitor and 
also  a  CYP2C9  and  2C19  inhibitor  on  selumetinib  pharmacokinetics  were  investigated  in  study 
D1532C00083. 
-  the  effect of rifampicin  as a strong  CYP inducer on  selumetinib  pharmacokinetics was  investigated in 
study D1532C00085.

A  non-statistically  significant  higher  exposure of  selumetinib  exposures in  subjects  with  two  alleles of 
ABCG2 421C>A  was  observed. No  relationship  with  selumetinib  exposure was  observed for  CYP2C19 
genetic variants.

No mechanism of action studies has been submitted with  this application. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
For primary pharmacology data, please refer to section 2.3.2. 
QTc prolongation 
Study D1532C00071  was a Phase I, Double-blind Selumetinib [Hyd-Sulfate]), placebo-controlled, 
open-label (Moxifloxacin) positive-controlled, randomised, three-period crossover study to assess the 
effects of single oral dose of selumetinib (75 mg) on QTc interval compared to placebo, using  AVELOX 
(Moxifloxacin) as a positive control, in  healthy male volunteers aged 18 to 45 years old. 
Following  a single oral dose of selumetinib 75 mg, the highest  upper bound of the 2-sided 90% CIs for 
∆∆QTcF over the  24-hour post dose measurement interval was 2.5 msec on the primary analysis, 
which was lower than the protocol-specified 10  msec upper bound  for concluding no effect. 
Following  a single oral dose of moxifloxacin 400 mg, the lower bound of the 2-sided 90% CI for mean 
∆∆QTcF over the  1- to 4-hour time interval post dose was greater than  5 msec (ie.9.4 msec) on the 
primary analysis, thereby establishing assay sensitivity.  
Mean differences for all ECG intervals were small for selumetinib treatment compared to placebo; 
differences ranged from -3.7 to 0.8  bpm for HR, -0.4  to 0.5 msec for QRS, and 0.1  to 5.3 msec for PR 
over the 0.5-hour to  24-hour post dose measurement period. 
No volunteers on selumetinib or placebo treatment  had QTcF or QTcB values >450  msec or changes 
from baseline >30 msec during the study.  There were no HR  events for selumetinib or placebo that 
met the predefined criterion of >100 bpm. 
No PK/PD relationship was observed between selumetinib and N-desmethyl-selumetinib concentrations 
versus observed, change-from-baseline, and placebo-subtracted change-from-baseline QTcF and QTcB 
values. 
PK/PD modelling 
Two exposure-response (ER) analysis (efficacy and safety) using the predicted exposure metrics (AUCss, 
Cmaxss and Cminss) by the  developed popPK model for both selumetinib and N desmethyl selumetinib 
were submitted. 
ER-efficacy  
Assessment report

Relationship  between predicted  PK exposure metrics and  ORR was  investigated,  on two  datasets (NCI 
dataset included Phase I and Phase II, ICR dataset included  only Phase II). Using  NCI central analysis, 
DoR (duration of response), PFS, best tumour size change and pain score from patient reported outcome 
were assessed vs. exposure of selumetinib and N-desmethyl metabolite.  
For ORR using an exploratory analysis (boxplot), on the  NCI dataset a slight  trend of decreasing AUCss 
or Cmaxss appears to be associated to lower response. On the  ICR dataset a similar trend is  observed. 
Binomial logistic regression on AUCss of selumetinib  versus response indicated no significant exposure-
ORR relationship  in the  Phase I and  Phase II efficacy data from  SPRINT using the  NCI  central analysis 
while  with  the independent  central review shows a minor  trend towards higher exposure having higher 
ORR (p=0.0428)  . 
For PFS, DoR, tumour size change and pain score no clear relationship was identified for both compounds.  
ER-safety  
An exploratory analysis between the most common AE (13 categorical AE) and the predicted PK exposure 
metrics was performed. In addition,  TTO (time  to  onset) and  adverse events actions (no  change, dose 
changed, withdrawn) were also explored. Overall no clear relationship was observed. 
Dose rationale  
Study D1532C0005 in adult patients  with advanced malignancies where selumetinib capsules dose from 
25  mg  to  100  mg were administered,  investigated the  inhibition  of phosphorylation of  ERK considered 
as an indirect measure of MEK inhibition by selumetinib. A direct relationship between selumetinib plasma 
concentration  and  the  inhibition  of  ERK  phosphorylation  was  observed,  with  the  highest  inhibition 
occurring at  the higher selumetinib plasma concentrations. 
In  SPRINT  study,  since  no  ERK  phosphorylation  activity  was  available,  the  plasma  concentration  of 
selumetinib and its  active N-desmethyl metabolite were combined with  a weighting  applied for increase 
potency of  the  metabolite.  The percent inhibition  of  pERK appears similar between  the  20  mg/m² and 
25 mg/m², 30 vs 33% respectively (data not shown). In addition such inhibition was linked to a combined 
exposure PK parameter (weighting  sum of parent and 3 time metabolite). 
The  proposed recommended oral  dose of  selumetinib  is  25  mg/m²  of  body surface area (BSA),  taken 
twice daily (BID). Dosing is individualized based on BSA (mg/ m²) and rounded to the nearest achievable 
5 mg or 10 mg (up to a maximal single dose of 50 mg) as presented in Table 13.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Throughout the  clinical development, different bioanalytical methods were used to  quantify selumetinib 
and  its  active  metabolite  N-desmethyl  selumetinib  in  human  plasma  with  K2EDTA  as  anticoagulant. 
Despite the absence of cross-validation data, there is no indication that the use of different bioanalytical 
methods resulted in different PK results based on popPK analysis.  
The  PK of  selumetinib  in  paediatric  patients  aged  3  to  18  years old  with  NF1  and  inoperable PN  have 
been adequately characterised following single and multiple dosing based on BSA in the dedicated pivotal 
phase 1/ 2 study  057 (SPRINT). To identify a suitable  dose, phase I portion of SPRINT study evaluated 
3  doses of  selumetinib, 20,  25  and 30  mg/m² (n=  9,  4 and  5, respectively), then 25  mg/m²  level was 
selected as the recommended dose for the extension Phase II portion (n= 45)  (see also section 2.5.1).  
Koselugo is for oral use. In view of the effect of food on the PK of selumetinib, it  should be taken on an 
empty stomach with  no food or drink other than water 2  hours prior to  dosing and 1 hour after dosing. 
The capsules should be swallowed whole  with  water. The capsules should not  be chewed, dissolved, or

opened, because this  could  impair  drug release and  affect the  absorption  of selumetinib  (see sections 
4.2, 4.5  and 5.2). 
If a dose of Koselugo is missed, it should only be taken if it is more than 6 hours until  the next scheduled 
dose.  
A  high  frequency  of  gastrointestinal  adverse  events  has  been  observed  in  paediatric  patients.  The 
applicant  is  recommended to  provide the  results  from  study  D1346C00015  evaluating  the  effect of  a 
low-fat meal on PK and tolerability in adolescents. The first CSR report is to be expected 3Q 2022.  Since 
an age-appropriate formulation showing no food effect on AUC and smaller decrease in Cmax compared 
with  capsules, is under  development, the  applicant  may consider using  this  formulation  for this  study. 
In  addition,  the  applicant  is  recommended  to  evaluate  PK  and  tolerability  of  the  age-appropriate 
formulation in paediatric patients  1-7 years of age (study D1346C00004).  The expected timing of study 
report is Q3 2023.   
A pooled Pop PK model for selumetinib and its N-desmethyl metabolite was developed based on plasma 
concentrations  of  selumetinib  and  N-desmethyl  selumetinib  issued from  10  Phase I  studies  in  healthy 
subjects, 2  Phase I studies in  adult  patients with  advanced solid malignancies and the  SPRINT study in 
children with  NF1.  Overall, the  developed Pop PK model  could be  considered adequate to  describe the 
PK  characteristics  of  selumetinib  and  appropriate  for  use  in  predictions  of  selumetinib  systemic 
exposures.  The  PK  parameters  in  adult  healthy  subjects  and  adult  patients  with  advanced  solid 
malignancies, are similar to those in  paediatric patients (3  to ≤ 18 years old) with  NF1. 
BSA was identified as a significant covariate impacting PK parameters of selumetinib (impact of CL >30% 
in the extremes of the observed BSA distribution).   
The  recommended dose of  Koselugo is  25 mg/m2 of  body surface area (BSA), taken  orally twice  daily 
(approximately every 12  hours).  Dosing  is  individualised  based on  BSA (mg/m2)  and  rounded  to  the 
nearest achievable 5 mg or 10 mg dose (up to a maximum single dose of 50 mg). Different strengths of 
Koselugo capsules can be combined to  attain the  desired dose (Table 13). Simulations have shown that 
the recommended 25 mg/m² BSA-based dosing provide similar systemic exposure of selumetinib across 
BSA bands. 
Renal  impairment  is  expected  to  have  no  meaningful  influence  on  the  exposure  of  selumetinib.  As 
exposure in  end stage  renal disease (ESRD) subjects  was  similar to  those  with  normal renal  function, 
investigations  in  mild,  moderate  and  severe renally  impaired  subjects  were  not  performed.  No  dose 
adjustment  is  recommended in  patients  with  mild,  moderate,  severe renal impairment  or  those  with 
ESRD (see sections 4.2  and 5.2  of the SmPC). 
Based on clinical trials,  no dose adjustment  is recommended in  patients  with  mild  hepatic impairment. 
The starting  dose should  be reduced in  patients  with  moderate hepatic impairment  to  20 mg/m2  BSA, 
twice daily. Koselugo is contraindicated for use in patients with  severe hepatic impairment (see sections 
4.2, 4.3  and 5.2 of the SmPC). 
Following  a  single-dose,  selumetinib  exposure appears to  be  higher  in  Japanese, non-Japanese-Asian 
and Indian  healthy adult  subjects  compared to  Western adult  subjects,  however, there is considerable 
overlap with  Western  subjects when  corrected for body  weight  or BSA.  No  specific  adjustment  to  the 
starting  dose is  recommended for paediatric Asian  patients,  however these  patients,  should  be closely 
monitored for adverse events (see sections 4.2  and 5.2  of the  SmPC). 
In  vitro,  selumetinib  is  not  an  inhibitor  of  CYP1A2,  CYP2A6,  CYP2B6,  CYP2C8,  CYP2C9,  CYP2C19, 
CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and CYP2E1.  
In  vitro, selumetinib  is  not  an inducer  of CYP1A2 and  CYP2B6. Selumetinib  is an  inducer of  CYP3A4 in 
vitro, this is however not  expected to be clinically relevant.  
Assessment report  
EMA/549867/2021  
Page 64/164 
 
 
 
In  vitro,  selumetinib  inhibits  UGT1A3,  UGT1A4,  UGT1A6  and  UGT1A9  however  these  effects  are  not 
expected to be clinically relevant. 
DDI studies  show  that  co-administration  with  medicinal  products that  are strong  inhibitors  of  CYP3A4 
(e.g.,  clarithromycin,  grapefruit  juice,  oral  ketoconazole)  or  CYP2C19  (e.g.,  ticlopidine)  should  be 
avoided.    Co  administration  with  medicinal  products  that  are  moderate  inhibitors  of  CYP3A4  (e.g., 
erythromycin and fluconazole) and CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole) should be avoided. If co-administration 
is  unavoidable,  patients  should  be  carefully  monitored  for  adverse events  and  the  selumetinib  dose 
should be reduced. If a patient  is currently taking 25  mg/m2 twice daily, the dose should be reduced to 
20 mg/m2 twice daily. If a patient  is currently taking 20 mg/m2 twice daily, the dose should be reduced 
to 15 mg/m2 twice daily.

In  addition,  concomitant  use  of  strong  CYP3A4 inducers  (e.g.,  phenytoin,  rifampicin,  carbamazepine, 
St. John’s Wort) or moderate CYP3A4 inducers with  Koselugo should be avoided.  
In vitro studies suggest that  selumetinib does not inhibit  the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), P-
glycoprotein  (P-gp),  OATP1B1,  OATP1B3,  OCT2,  OAT1,  MATE1  and  MATE2K  at  the  recommended 
paediatric dose. In vitro, selumetinib is an inhibitor of OAT3. The potential  for a clinically relevant effect 
on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  concomitantly  administered  substrates  of  OAT3  (e.g.,  methotrexate  and 
furosemide) cannot be excluded (see sections 4.2, 4.5  and 5.2 of the SmPC). 
More than  30%  of the paediatric patients  used concomitant medication  with  histamine H2-antagonists, 
proton  pump  inhibitors  or  antacids.  Selumetinib  capsules  do  not  exhibit  pH  dependent  dissolution. 
Koselugo can be used concomitantly with  gastric pH modifying agents (i.e. H2 receptor antagonists and 
proton  pump  inhibitors)  without  any  restrictions,  except for  omeprazole which  is  a  CYP2C19  inhibitor. 
However, monitoring  of these combinations through routine pharmacovigilance is recommended.  
The commercial product contains Vitamin E polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS) as excipient. TPGS has 
the potential to increase the bioavailability of orally administered drug presumably by inhibition of efflux 
transporters (Guo et  al. 2013,  Chang  et al.  1996,  Bogman et al.,  2005).   It  cannot  be excluded that  it 
may cause clinically relevant drug interactions with  substrates of P-gp (e.g. digoxin or fexofenadine). 
The effect  of selumetinib  on  the  exposure of  oral contraceptives has not  been  evaluated. It  cannot  be 
excluded that  selumetinib  may reduce the  effectiveness of oral contraceptives, therefore women using 
hormonal contraceptives should be recommended to add a barrier method (see sections 4.5 and 4.6 of 
the SmPC).

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
An extensive clinical  pharmacology program, including  formal PK  studies including  mass  balance, food 
effect, hepatic and renal impairment, as well as population PK analysis (in adults and paediatric patients) 
and  DDI  assessment  has  been  provided.  Overall,  the  PKs  of  selumetinib  has  been  sufficiently 
characterised  in  healthy  subjects,  adult  patients  with  solid  tumours  and  in  the  target  population  of 
paediatric patients  aged 3 to  18  years old with  NF-1  and inoperable PN (pivotal  phase 1  and 2  SPRINT 
study). The PK of selumetinib appears to  be similar in adult and paediatric patients. The proposed BSA-
based dosing regimen of selumetinib 25  mg/m² BID in children patients is supported.  
Besides, the  applicant  is recommended to  evaluate PK  and tolerability of a  low-fat meal in  adolescents 
(study  D1346C00015)  and  to  evaluate  PK  and  tolerability  of  the  age-appropriate    formulation  in 
paediatric patients  1-7 years of age (study D1346C00004).

2.5.1.  Dose response study 
Methods 
•  Study design 
The dose response study is a Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP)-sponsored Phase I, open-label, 
single-arm, multiple-dose, dose-escalation, multi-centre study of selumetinib in paediatric patients with 
neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)  and inoperable plexiform neurofibroma (PN).  
Inoperable  PN  was  defined  as  PN  that  cannot  be  surgically  completely  removed  without  risk  for 
substantial morbidity due to encasement of, or close proximity to, vital structures, invasiveness, or high 
vascularity of the PN.

Duration  of  study and 
study treatment 
Patients continued in the study until they met at least 1 of the off-study criteria. 
In  order  to limit the potential for exposure  to selumetinib in the  absence  of clinical 
benefit, the following caveats were applied: 
- 
- 
For  patients  with  documented  disease  progression  within  approximately 
1.5 years  prior  to  study  entry  (i.e., ≥20%  increase  in  PN  volume  or  ≥13% 
increase in the product  of longest 2 perpendicular  diameters or ≥6% increase in 
longest diameter), there was no limit to the duration of treatment as long as the 
patient met the requirements  for further  treatment and at the discretion  of the 
institutional principal investigator. 
For  patients  with  no  documented  history  of  disease  progression  within  the 
1.5 years  prior  to study  entry, treatment  duration  was  limited to  2 years  if no 
imaging response (response=volume decreased  by ≥20%) was observed. 
Patients who were removed from treatment after 2 years of therapy for reasons other 
than toxicity or progression,  and who had stable disease, continued  to be monitored 
with  volumetric  MRI  analysis  every  4  to 6  months.  If  the  target  PN  demonstrated 
some  growth  (volume  increase  ≥15%)  within  approximately  2  years  of  stopping 
selumetinib, treatment with selumetinib could be re-started (re-treatment) with the 
goal to  stop  further PN growth.  Patients  were to  be re-consented  to the  study  and 
were required to meet all eligibility criteria, with the exception of prior treatment with 
selumetinib or another  specific MEK  1/2 inhibitor, prior  to selumetinib re treatment. 
Selumetinib re-treatment could continue as long as the target PN remained stable or 
responsive.

Results 
Patient  disposition 
In total,  24  patients  were enrolled in SPRINT Phase I.  Twelve patients  received selumetinib  20 mg/m2 
BID, 6 patients  received selumetinib 25 mg/m2 BID and 6 patients  received selumetinib 30 mg/m2 BID. 
In total,  45.8%  of patients  discontinued  treatment.  AEs and ‘Other’ were the  most common reason for 
treatment discontinuation.  Within  the ‘Other’ category, 2 patients  discontinued because it was ‘deemed 
in the patient’s best interest’ as assessed by the investigator and 1 patient discontinued based on ‘tumour 
becoming resistant’. At DCO, 54.2%  of patients  were continuing  to receive selumetinib. 
There were 17 screen failures in SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1, the reasons being: for 9 patients ‘compliance 
with  study  criteria’  (e.g.,  tumour  not  measurable,  no  PN-related  morbidities,  metal  work  in  situ, 
compliance  issues);  for  4  patients  ‘patient/  family  decision’;  for  4  patients  ‘medical  reasons’  (e.g., 
hypertension, surgery, increased intra ocular pressure); and for a single patient ‘no information given’. 
Demographic and disease characteristics 
Demographic and other patient  characteristics at baseline for SPRINT Phase I are summarised in Table 
17.  
The median age at  enrolment was 10.9 years (range: 3.0  to 18.5  years); 54.2%  of patients were male 
and 75.0% of patients were White. The median time from diagnosis of NF1  and PN to start of selumetinib 
treatment was 8.75 years (range 1.42-17.0 years) and 8.28 years (range 0.79-17.0 years), respectively. 
At baseline the median target PN volume was 1204.50  mL (range: 29.4 to 8744.0  mL). Nineteen patients 
(79.2%)  had received prior medical therapy for PN and/or another NF1-related tumour.  The three most 
common  medical  therapies  (>20%  of  patients  at  the  Anatomical  Therapeutic  Chemical  [ATC]  level) 
received by  these  patients  were  interferons  (including  peginterferon),  selective  immunosuppressants 
(sirolimus) and protein kinase inhibitors (imatinib).

The starting  dose level was 20  mg/m²/dose BID (approximately 50%  of the  adult  maximum tolerated 
dose [MTD]).  This was to be followed by up to 3 dose escalations, with  the highest dose level exceeding 
the adult  MTD by 1 dose level. 
A  contemporary  study  conducted  by  the  Pediatric  Brain  Tumor  Consortium  (Banerjee  et  al  2017) 
determined, the MTD of paediatric patients with  low-grade glioma as selumetinib 25 mg/m² BID and this 
additional dose level was added to the dose schema per protocol amendment. 
As a secondary objective, automated volumetric MRI  analysis was used to  monitor PN  growth  rate. PN 
growth rate was evaluated by a single National  Cancer Institute-  Paediatric Branch Oncology (NCI POB) 
reviewer who is a leading expert in the Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis 
(REiNS) tumour imaging working group. 
In total,  24  paediatric patients were enrolled and treated with  selumetinib  at 4  sites in  the US. At  DCO 
(Data cut-off),  16 (66.7%)  patients  remained within  the  study; of these 13 (54.2%)  patients remained 
on selumetinib. In total, 11 patients discontinued selumetinib; the reasons were: AE (3 patients), disease 
progression  (2  patients),  patient  not  willing  to  continue  (2  patients),  treatment  period  completed  (1 
patient)  and  other  (3  patients).  Eight  patients  discontinued  the  study;  the  most  common reason was 
voluntary discontinuation  by patient (4 patients).

The starting  dose level was 20  mg/m² BID, which  was tolerated (no patients  had  a DLT (Dose-limiting 
toxicity)).  The dose was  escalated to  30 mg/m²  BID, which  was not  tolerated (2/6 patients  had DLTs). 
Based on the dose-limiting toxicity Analysis Set, the  recommended Phase II dose was 25 mg/m² BID.  
Efficacy Outcomes and estimation 
Efficacy of selumetinib, as assessed by target  PN volume measurements, was a secondary objective for 
this study.   
Table 14: Confirmed objective response rate (SPRINT Phase I) 
The objective response rate (ORR) analyses was  based on the  Full  Analysis Set  population. Responses 
were reported at all dose levels. Of the 24 patients  treated: 
-  16  (66.7%;  95%  CI: 44.7,  84.4)  patients  had  a confirmed partial response (cPR) (target  PN  volume 
decrease ≥20% from baseline for ≥4  weeks),  
- 2 (8.3%)  patients had an unconfirmed PR,  
- 5 (20.8%)  patients had stable disease. 
No  patient  (0%)  had  a CR; no  patient  (0%)  had  progression; and  1 patient  (4.2%)  was not  evaluable 
(this  patient did not have any response derivations, primarily due to  out-of-window visits).

DoR  
At  DCO,  median  DoR  from  onset  of  response was  not  reached,  as  only  1  of  the  16  patients  with  a 
confirmed response had  subsequently progressed. All 16  responders had  been followed  up for  at least 
16 months from the onset of response (range: 18 to 65 cycles), and the number (percentage) of patients 
remaining  in  response  after  16,  22  and  28  cycles  was  16  (100%),  14  (87.5%),  and  12  (75.0%), 
respectively. 
In the post-hoc supplementary analysis using all available scans, two  responders eventually progressed 
at  33.1  and  46.3  months  after  response  onset,  respectively. For  this  analysis,  median  DoR  was  not 
reached and the number (percentage) of patients remaining in response after 16, 22 and 24 months was 
17 (100%),  16 (94.1%),  and 14 (82.4%),  respectively.

The median TTR for the 16  responders was 7.5  cycles (95%  CI: 5.0,  10.0).  At  the first  assessment (at 
5  cycles)  8  of  these  (50.0%)  had  their  response, and  by  10  cycles this  number  had  increased to  13 
(81.3%). 
PFS 
At  DCO,  median PFS  was  not  reached (with  a  median  follow-up  for  PFS  of  49.0  cycles), as  only  2/24 
patients (8.3%)  had progressed (none had died). 
In the post-hoc supplementary analysis using all available scans, 4/24 patients (16.7%) had progressed, 
i.e., 2 more than  in the main PFS analysis. For this  analysis, median PFS was not reached. 
2.5.2.  Main study 
A Phase I/II Study of the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MEK) 1 
Inhibitor Selumetinib (AZD6244; HYD Sulfate) in Children with 
Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) and Inoperable Plexiform Neurofibromas 
(PN) (SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1) 
SPRINT Phase II is an ongoing CTEP-sponsored, open-label, single-arm, multi-centre  study of 
selumetinib in children with  NF1  and inoperable PN, with  PN-related morbidity at enrolment, and was 
conducted by the NCI POB (National  Cancer Institute-  Paediatric Branch Oncology). 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Patients were enrolled on 1 of 2 strata based on whether they already had PN-related morbidity 
(Stratum 1) or had no significant clinical morbidity (Stratum 2) but  the potential for significant clinical 
PN-related morbidity at the time of enrolment (see inclusion criteria).  Stratum 2 data were not 
included in this  application. 
The main criteria for inclusion in SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1,  were: 
•  Age: ≥2 and ≤18 years at the time of enrolment. Body surface area ≥0.55 m² and ability to swallow 
whole capsules (assessed at screening using  an empty capsule shell). The age criteria were chosen 
because early childhood and puberty are considered to be the greatest risk for disease progression, 
and selumetinib may provide the  most benefit to  this young group of patients. 
•  Diagnosis: patients  with  NF1  (per NIH  Consensus Conference criteria) and inoperable PN,  defined 
as PN that  could not  be surgically completely removed without  risk for substantial morbidity due to 
encasement of, or close proximity to,  vital structures, invasiveness or high vascularity of the PN.  
The PN had to cause significant morbidity, such as (but not limited to) head and neck PN that  could have 
compromised the airway or great vessels, paraspinal PN that could have caused myelopathy, brachial or 
lumbar  plexus PN  that  could  have caused nerve compression and loss  of function,  PN  that  could  have 
resulted in  major deformity (e.g.  orbital  PN)  or were significantly  disfiguring,  PN  of the  extremity  that 
could have caused limb hypertrophy or loss of function,  and painful PN.  
•  Measurable  disease:  patients must have had at least 1 measurable PN, defined as a PN of at least 
3  cm  measured in  1  dimension.  Patients  who  had  undergone  surgery for  resection  of  a  PN  were 
eligible,  provided the  PN  had  been incompletely  resected and  was  measurable. Measurability  and 
suitability  for volumetric MRI analysis of the  target  PN had to  be confirmed with  the  NCI POB prior 
Assessment report  
EMA/549867/2021  
Page 73/164 
 
 
 
to enrolment. The target PN was defined as the clinically most relevant PN, which had to be amenable 
to volumetric MRI analysis. 
•  Performance status:  patients  >16  years of age must  have had a  Karnofsky performance level of 
≥70%,  and patients ≤16 years old must have had a Lansky performance of ≥70%. 
•  Normal/adequate  haematologic,  hepatic,  renal,  and  cardiac  function,  and  adequate  blood 
pressure.  
•  Prior therapy:  patients with  NF1  were only eligible if complete PN resection was not considered to 
be feasible without  substantial risk or morbidity. 
Since there is no standard effective chemotherapy for patients with  NF1  and PN, patients could have 
been treated on this  study without  having received prior medical therapy directed at their PN. 
•  Since selumetinib is not expected to cause substantial  myelosuppression, there was no limit 
to  the  number of  prior myelosuppressive regimens for PN,  or other  tumour  manifestations 
associated with  NF1,  such as optic  glioma. 
• 
Patients  who  had  received  previous  investigational  agents  or  biologic  therapy,  such  as 
tipifarnib,  pirfenidone,  Peg-Intron,  sorafenib,  imatinib  or  other  targeted  therapies  were 
eligible for enrolment. At  least 4  weeks must  have elapsed since receiving medical therapy 
directed  at  the  PN.  Patients  who  received prior  medical  therapy  for  their  PN  must  have 
recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior therapy to ≤Grade 1 Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4 before entering this  study. 
•  Growth  factors  that  support  platelet  or white  cell number  or  function  must  not  have been 
administered within  the  7 days prior to enrolment. 
•  At least  6 weeks must  have elapsed prior to enrolment since the  patient  received any prior 
radiation therapy. 
•  At  least  4  weeks  must  have  elapsed  since  any  surgeries,  with  evidence  of  good  wound 
healing. 
The main exclusion criteria for in SPRINT Phase II Stratum  1, were: 
•  Ongoing  radiation  therapy,  chemotherapy,  hormonal  therapy  directed  at  the  tumour, 
immunotherapy or biologic therapy. 
•  Any  evidence  of  severe  or  uncontrolled  systemic  disease,  active  infection,  active  bleeding 
diatheses, or  renal transplant,  including  any patient  known to  have hepatitis  B,  hepatitis  C,  or 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were to be excluded. Patients with  HIV who had adequate 
CD4 count, not requiring antiretroviral medication, could be enrolled. 
• 
• 
Inability to swallow capsules, since capsules cannot be crushed or broken. 
Evidence of an optic glioma, malignant glioma, MPNST, or other cancer requiring treatment with 
chemotherapy or radiation therapy. 
•  Supplementation  with  vitamin  E  greater  than  100%  of  the  daily  recommended  dose.  Any 
multivitamin  containing vitamin E must have been stopped prior to  initiation  of therapy. 
•  Ophthalmologic conditions: current or past history of central serous retinopathy, current or past 
history of retinal vein occlusion, known intraocular pressure (IOP) >21 mmHg  (or upper limit of 
normal [ULN]  adjusted by age) or uncontrolled glaucoma (irrespective of IOP). Patients with  any 
other  significant  abnormality  on  ophthalmic  examination  were to  be  discussed with  the  Study 
Chair for potential eligibility. Ophthalmological findings secondary to long-standing optic pathway 
Assessment report

glioma (such  as  visual loss, optic  nerve pallor or strabismus)  or long-standing  orbito-temporal 
PN  (such  as  visual  loss,  strabismus)  were  not  considered  a  significant  abnormality  for  the 
purposes of the study. 
Treatments 
Selumetinib was supplied as 10 mg and 25 mg capsules. Selumetinib was administered orally twice daily 
(approximately every 12 hours) continuously for 28-day cycles with  no rest periods between cycles.  
Patients were instructed to take the dose of selumetinib on an empty  stomach (no food or drink other 
than  water  for  2  hours  before and  1hour  after  dosing)  with  water  only.  The  capsules  were not  to  be 
crushed or broken and were to  be swallowed whole. 
Dosing 
Dosing was performed based on BSA, and doses were rounded to the nearest 5 to 10 mg using a dosing 
nomogram. Selumetinib dosing was capped at 50  mg when BSA was ≥1.9 m².  At follow-up evaluations 
during re-staging visits, selumetinib was adjusted for changes in BSA according to the dosing nomogram 
depicted in Table 20  below.

If the  patient experienced a toxicity requiring  dose modification,  selumetinib was to  be withheld.  If the 
toxicity resolved to meet study parameters or CTCAE v4.0 ≤Grade 1 within  21 days of drug interruption, 
the patient  could resume selumetinib at a dose reduced by 25% to 33%. 
If toxicity recurred in any patient who had resumed treatment at the reduced dose, the dose could have 
been reduced a second time using the same criteria, with  the exception of cardiotoxicity, for which  only 
1 dose reduction was allowed.

Doses reduced for toxicity were in general not to be re-escalated, even if there was minimal or no toxicity 
with  the  reduced dose, with  the following  exception: the dose may have been increased to account  for 
an increase in BSA at the time of on-study evaluations. 
If toxicity recurred in any patient who had resumed treatment at the reduced dose, the dose could have 
been reduced a  second time  (i.e.  a  second selumetinib  dose reduction;  see Table  22)  using  the  same

for toxicities  other  than  cardiotoxicity  were: the  toxicity  resolved to  meet study  parameters  within  21 
days  of  selumetinib  discontinuation  (unless  receiving  clear  clinical  benefit,  as  defined  below  under 
treatment  duration), the  dose was reduced 25% to  33%,  could not  have been re-escalated, and doses 
held were not  made up.

If toxicity recurred after 2 dose reductions, the  patient was removed permanently from selumetinib. 
Treatment duration: 
Patients  continued  in  the  study  until  they met  at  least  1  of  the  off-study criteria.  In  order to  limit  the 
potential  for  exposure  to  selumetinib  in  the  absence  of  clinical  benefit,  the  following  caveats  were 
applied: 
• For patients with documented disease  progression within approximately 1.5 years prior to 
study  entry,  defined  as  ≥20%  increase  in  size  of  PN  by  volumetric  MRI  analysis  (or  ≥13% 
increase in the product of the longest 2 perpendicular diameters, or ≥6% increase in the longest 
diameter), there  was to  be  no limit to  the  duration of  treatment  as long  as the  patient  met 
the protocol-defined requirements for further treatment.    
• For patients with no documented history of disease progression within the 1.5 years prior 
to  trial entry,  the  duration of  the study  was limited  to 2 years  if no  imaging response (i.e. 
response=volume decreased by ≥20%) was observed. 
•  Re-treatment:  Patients  who  were  removed  from  treatment  after  2  years  of  therapy  for 
reasons other  than  toxicity  or progression, and  who  had  stable  disease, were continued  to  be 
monitored  with  volumetric  MRI  analysis every 4  to  6  months.    If  the  PN  demonstrated  some 
growth  (volume  increase  ≥15%)  within  approximately  2  years  of  stopping  selumetinib, 
treatment with selumetinib could be re-started with the goal to stop further PN growth.  Patients 
were to  be re-consented on the study and meet all eligibility criteria, with the  exception of prior 
treatment with  selumetinib or another specific MEK 1/2 inhibitor  prior to re-starting therapy.  In 
these patients, treatment could continue as long as the PN remained stable or responsive (<20% 
increase in the PN volume). 
•  For  patients  who  showed  imaging  response  the  treatment  duration  was  not  to  be 
limited,  unless  the  patient  experienced  subsequent  disease  progression  or  met  other  off-
treatment criteria. 
In all cases, treatment may have been discontinued earlier at the discretion of the institutional principal 
investigator if this was felt to be in the best interest of the patient.

Objectives 
The primary objective was to evaluate confirmed partial and complete response rate of selumetinib using 
volumetric  MRI  analysis  in  children  and  young  adults  with  NF1  and  inoperable  PN  with  PN-related 
morbidity at time of enrolment. 
Secondary objectives included: 
o  Efficacy: Duration of response (DoR), time to progression (TTP), time to tumour response (TTR) 
and progression free survival (PFS). 
o  Clinical outcome measures related to  the target  PN: effect on pain, functional  outcomes (motor 
dysfunction,  airway dysfunction, visual  dysfunction and  bowel/bladder dysfunction  as assigned 
at baseline), disfigurement. 
o  Health-related quality of life (QoL). 
o  Safety: Long-term tolerability and safety, and PK. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
The primary outcome variable pre-specified in the  protocol was objective response rate (ORR), defined 
as the  percentage of patients with  a complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR is target 
PN  volume decrease from baseline ≥20%,  confirmed when  documented by subsequent volumetric MRI 
within  3 to 6 months): 
• CR:  Disappearance of the target PN 
• PR:  Decrease in the  volume of  the target  PN  by 20%  or more compared with  the  baseline. 
The PR is considered unconfirmed at the  first detection,  confirmed when observed again within 
3 to 6 months. 
• Stable disease: Insufficient volume change from baseline to qualify for either PR or progressive 
disease. 
• Progressive disease: Increase in the volume of the target PN by 20%  or more compared with 
baseline or the time of best response after documenting a PR.  The appearance of new PN (with 
the  exception  of  new  discrete  subcutaneous  neurofibromas)  or  unequivocal  progression  of 
existing clinically relevant non-target PN was also to  be considered progressive disease. 
The target PN was selected by the assessing investigator as the most clinically relevant PN, amenable to 
volumetric MRI analysis, to follow during the study.   
Tumour response was evaluated at  re-staging visits prior to Cycles 5, 9,  13, 17,  21, 25,  and then  after 
every 6 cycles until permanent discontinuation  of selumetinib.

Additional objectives and endpoints 
An  additional  objective/endpoint  was  a  comparison  of  PN  growth  rates  and  PFS  in  SPRINT  Phase  II 
Stratum  1 to  the Natural  History (NH)  study (08-C-0079;  NCT00924196),  i.e. a descriptive evaluation. 
Patient data from the NH  study were thus  used as external control data. 
Exploratory objectives and endpoints 
An exploratory objective/endpoint was to assess the relationship between tumour volume/response and 
clinical outcome assessments (COAs), i.e. patient-  (or parent) reported and functional  outcomes. 
First,  correlations  between  COAs  and  PN  volume  at  baseline  were  explored,  as  well  as  correlations 
between changes in COAs and changes in PN volume (assessed as percent change from baseline) at pre-
Cycle 13. Secondly, the association between post-baseline longitudinal changes in COAs and changes in 
PN volume was evaluated. 
Individual patient reviews (IPRs) 
To characterise the efficacy of selumetinib at an individual patient  level, patient data from SPRINT Phase 
II Stratum 1 were also presented in the format of individual patient reviews (IPRs). The aim of each IPR 
was  to  provide  a  comprehensive and  cohesive  narrative of  the  patient’s  journey prior  to  and  during 
treatment with selumetinib, including an Investigator assessment of whether each patient derived clinical 
benefit from study treatment. 
Sample size 
The sample size for the  primary objective of  ORR in  patients with  PN-related  morbidity was based on a 
target response rate to exclude 15% with a lower 2-sided 95% confidence bound. With 50 total evaluable 
Assessment report

symptomatic patients,  an exact binomial  test  with  a  nominal 1-sided  2.5%  significance level had  90% 
power  to  detect  the  difference  between  a  null  hypothesis  response  rate  of  15%  and  an  alternative 
hypothesis response rate  of 36%.  With  14  or more responses out  of the  50  patients,  the lower limit  of 
the exact 2-sided 95% confidence interval for the response rate would be 16.2%  or greater. Thus, 14 or 
more responses in 50 evaluable patients was consistent with results that would statistically significantly 
exceed a 15%  true response rate based on a 2-sided confidence interval. 
Randomisation 
This was a single-arm study. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was open-label. 
Statistical methods 
Description of analysis  populations/sets 
Efficacy analyses related to assessing response in terms of volumetric reduction of target PN (ORR, DoR, 
TTR, PFS and TTP) were conducted on the full  analysis set (FAS) that included all patients  who received 
at least 1 dose of selumetinib. Unless stated otherwise by supplementary analyses, sources of data that 
have not contributed to the efficacy analyses included multiple partial volumes of target PN, off-schedule 
assessments and data  collected after permanent  discontinuation  of selumetinib.  COAs were conducted 
either on  the FAS,  or age-subsets of the  FAS (pain  in subset  of patients  ≥8 years, physical functioning 
in subset of patients ≥5  years) or a subset of the  FAS with  PN-related morbidity. 
Primary endpoint: ORR analyses 
Primary ORR analysis 
Centrally read 3D MRI volumetric MRI analysis was performed by a single reviewer at the NCI POB, who 
was a leading expert in the REiNS Tumor Imaging working group. Response was assessed prior to Cycles 
5,  9,  13,  17,  21,  25  and  then  after  every  6  cycles  until  permanent  discontinuation  of  selumetinib. 
Response assessment was based on evaluation of target PN only and followed the REiNS criteria (Dombi 
et al. 2013). 
NCI POB Central analysis of PN response – Primary Analysis 
At  each scheduled pre-cycle assessment, patients  were programmatically assigned a tumour  response 
derived from volumetric MRI analysis of the target PN prior to Cycles 5, 9, 13, 17, 21,  25 and then  after 
every 6  cycles  until  permanent  discontinuation  of  selumetinib.  In  most  instances,  the  entire  PN  was 
captured by volumetric MRI,  but  in  some instances  a partial volume measurement was collected (e.g., 
due to  movement during MRI,  presence of haematoma or metalwork) –  in this  instance  partial volume 
measurements were used in the programmatic derivation of tumour response only when a single baseline 
partial volume was available, otherwise response was not calculated. Unscheduled volumetric MRI data 
(i.e., data that  did not correspond to a pre-cycle scheduled visit) and data collected following permanent 
treatment  discontinuation  were  not  used  in  the  programmatic  derivation  of  tumour  response. 
Supplementary analyses were performed to  derive ORR and DoR based on all available volumetric MRI 
scans.  
Independent Central Review (ICR) – Sensitivity Analysis 
Assessment report  
EMA/549867/2021  
Page 79/164 
 
 
 
An independent review of volumetric MRIs was conducted (using  target PN only), according to  modified 
REiNS criteria (sensitivity analysis). The ICR was performed retrospectively, after DCO, on the complete 
set of  scheduled volumetric MRIs (target  PN  only) for each patient.  For  the ICR, volumetric MRIs  were 
assessed by  either  an independent  whole  body  radiologist or  a neuro-radiologist  (2  radiologists and  1 
neuro radiologist were available), with  the involvement of   imaging specialists. A written  description of 
the target PN location was provided to  to ensure the same PN was assessed for the ICR analysis. Since 
the  target  PN  was  considered  by  the  site  investigators  to  be  the  most  clinically  relevant  PN  causing 
morbidities at baseline, the independent reviewers needed to assess the same target PN as was assessed 
by the NCI  POB central reviewer. However, the boundary selection of the target PN  was still  performed 
by , to maintain the independent review. Though the NCI POB and ICR analyses followed the same REiNS 
assessment criteria, there were some key differences in the ICR methodology in the handling of partial 
target  PN volumes, image analysis methods and  number of reviewers (NCI  POB: single reviewer, ICR: 
choice of 3 reviewers) compared to the NCI POB central analysis. ORR and DoR analyses were generated 
and a concordance analysis was conducted to describe the NCI POB central analysis target PN responses 
in relation to the ICR analysis responses (based on REiNs). The margins of error for target PN volume at 
baseline  and  for  percentage  change  from  baseline  were  assessed  using  the  intraclass  correlation 
coefficient (ICC), which compared the assessment of 2 independent readers from  on 10 randomly chosen 
patients. 
Secondary endpoint: DoR analyses 
Primary DoR analysis 
Duration of  response (DoR) was  defined as the  time from the  pre-cycle volumetric MRI  assessment of 
the first documented response (subsequently confirmed) until  the pre-cycle volumetric MRI assessment 
of documented progression on treatment or death in the absence of disease progression. It was derived 
based on scheduled pre-cycle volumetric MRI assessments. The Kaplan-Meier (KM) method was used to 
amongst others calculate median DoR and 95% CI, and calculate the median time to onset of response 
from initiation of study treatment and 95% CI. Only patients who had a CR or confirmed PR were included 
in this  analysis. DoR censoring followed the PFS censoring rules ( 
Table 24). 
Sensitivity analyses 
DoR was also derived based on the ICR according to REiNS criteria using the same statistical  method as 
for the NCI POB central analysis. 
A second sensitivity analysis using the actual dates of the NCI POB-based imaging assessments or death 
(if  any)  was  conducted.  DoR  based  on  actual  dates  was  defined  as  the  time  from  the  date  of  first 
documented (and subsequently confirmed) response until the date of documented progression or death 
in the absence of disease progression. 
Secondary endpoint: PFS  analysis 
Progression-free survival (PFS)  was  defined  as  the  time  from  study  treatment  initiation  until  the  pre-
cycle volumetric MRI assessment of objective disease progression on treatment  or death (by any cause 
in  the  absence  of  progression). Median  PFS  with  95%  CIs  was  calculated  using  a  KM  plot.  The  PFS 
censoring rules are summarised in Table 24. 
Assessment report  
EMA/549867/2021  
Page 80/164 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 19: Summary of PFS censoring rules 
Secondary endpoint: TTP analysis 
Time to  progression (TTP)  was  defined as the  time  from  study  treatment  initiation  until  the  pre-cycle 
volumetric  MRI  assessment of  objective disease  progression  on  treatment.  Median  TTP  with  95%  CIs 
was calculated using  a KM  plot. TTP censoring followed the PFS censoring rules ( 
Table 24). 
Secondary endpoint: TTR analysis 
Time  to  response  (TTR)  was  defined  as  the  time  from  study  treatment  initiation  until  the  pre-cycle 
volumetric  MRI  assessment  of  the  first  documentation  of  CR  or  a  subsequently  confirmed  PR.  It  was 
derived  based  on  scheduled  pre-cycle  volumetric  MRI  assessments.  The  pre-cycle  volumetric  MRI 
assessment  of  the  first  documented  response  was  to  coincide  with  that  used  for  the  DoR  endpoint. 
Median  TTR  with  95%  CIs was  calculated  from  a KM  plot.  Only  patients  who  had  achieved a  CR  or a 
confirmed PR were evaluated for TTR.

For analysis of the PROs, the patient- and parent-reported data were analysed and presented separately. 
The  primary  analysis  of  the  COAs  was  based  on  the  descriptive  statistics  and  MMRM  models  that 
summarised  the  changes  over  time.  In  addition,  supportive  analyses  using  clinically  meaningful 
thresholds  (CMTs)  were  conducted.  These  CMTs  were  estimated  using  both  distribution-  (one-half 
standard  deviation)  and  anchor-based  (with  the  global  impression  of  change  [GIC]  as  the  anchor) 
approaches, supplemented with empirical cumulative distribution  function (eCDF) and probability density 
function  (PDF)  curves.  Whenever  available,  thresholds  from  published  literature  were  also  used. 
Regarding missing  data,  the  COAs  were analysed using  the  mixed  model repeated measures  (MMRM) 
under a missing at random (MAR) assumption. 
A few COAs are described in brief below. 
Pain intensity (NRS-11) 
Pain  intensity  was  measured  by  the  Numerical  Rating  Scale-11  (NRS-11),  consisting  of  4 questions 
scored on a scale 0=no pain to  10=worst  pain you can imagine. This pain rating was for the  physician-
selected target PN  only. 
Pain interference index (PII) 
Pain interference was  measured by the PII. The PII is a 6-item  scale that  assesses the extent to  which 
pain has  interfered with  an individual’s daily activities  in the  past  7 days. Items are rated on a  7-point 
Likert scale (0=not  at all to 6=completely), and the total  score is the  mean of the completed items. 
Assessment report  
EMA/549867/2021  
Page 82/164 
 
 
 
 
 
PedsQL 
General Quality of Life (QoL) was measured using the generic Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL 
4.0  Generic Core Scales). The  generic PedsQL assesses function  in  4  domains: 1) Physical  Functioning 
(8 items), 2) Emotional Functioning (5  items), 3) Social Functioning  (5 items) and 4) School Functioning 
(5  items).  Each  item  is  scored  on  a  5-point  Likert  scale  (0  =  never  a  problem;  1 = almost  never a 
problem; 2 = sometimes a  problem; 3  =  often a  problem; 4  = almost  always a problem).  Items were 
reverse-scored and linearly transformed to a 0  to 100  scale (0 =  100, 1  = 75,  2 =  50, 3  = 25,  4 =  0), 
so that higher scores indicated better HRQoL. 
Motor function 
Analysis of motor function includes only those patients  in the FAS with  motor morbidity at enrolment. 
Motor  function  was assessed by  manual muscle test  (MMT)  strength for  each muscle group (scale of 0 
to  5  using  the  Medical  Research Council  scale)  and  range  of  motion  (ROM)  for  joints  (measured  in 
degrees). 
Motor function was also assessed using the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System 
(PROMIS)  Pediatric  Short  Form  v1.0  –  Mobility  8a  and  PROMIS  Pediatric  Short  Form  v1.0  –  Upper 
Extremity  8a.  These  forms  assessed  level  of  motor  function  over  the  past  7  days.  The  short  forms 
consisted  of  8  items  using  a  5-point  Likert  scale format  (i.e.,  0=unable  to  do,  4=can  do  without  any 
difficulty).  Raw  scores were  converted  to  T–scores,  which  are  based  on  reference data  from  the  US 
general population, where mean=50, SD=10. Higher scores indicated better physical functioning. 
Global impression of change (GIC) 
Global impression of change (GIC) in tumour pain, overall pain and tumour-related morbidities compared 
to baseline were measured by the GIC scale, consisting of 3 questions scored on a 7-point scale (1=Very 
much improved to 7=Very much worse), and was self-assessed by patients and also assessed by parents. 
The GIC was used as an anchor to derive clinically meaningful change thresholds as described above. 
Correlation analyses 
The following  clinical outcome assessments were considered for the  correlation analysis with  target  PN 
volume from baseline to pre-Cycle13: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Pain intensity (NRS-11):  patient-reported pain intensity score on the “target tumour” 
Pain interference index (PII): PII score 
Motor function  (PROMIS): mobility  and upper extremity scores 
HRQoL  (PedsQL):  the  PedsQL total  score  and  the  four  domain  scores of  physical functioning, 
emotional functioning,  social functioning  and school functioning. 
The Spearman rank correlation coefficients (r), which measured strength of rank preserving relationship, 
were assessed per Cohen 1998.  Whilst  a  weak correlation coefficient indicated  a  lack of evidence of a 
rank preserving relationship, it was not  to be interpreted as lack of relationship in general. 
- r = 0 to 0.3  equates to a weak correlation 
- r = 0.3 to  0.5 equates to  a moderate correlation 
- r = 0.5 to  1.0 equates to  a strong correlation. 
A  positive  correlation  was  defined  as  both  an  improvement in  the  COA  and  a  reduction  in  target  PN 
volume.

Recruitment 
Recruitment of the 50 patients  was done in 4 paediatric centres in the USA: Childrens National Medical 
Center, National Cancer Institute  Pediatric Oncology Branch, Cincinnati  Childrens Hospital  and The 
Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia. The first patient  was enrolled on 12 August 2015  and the last 
patient was enrolled on 22  August 2016. 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
The original protocol was dated 6-Apr-2011. The first 8 protocol amendments pertained to SPRINT 
Phase I, whereas SPRINT Phase II only came into effect following the 9th protocol amendment. The 
final version of the study protocol, i.e. following the 16th protocol amendment, was dated 14-Jan-2019.   
Protocol deviations 
Two patients (4.0%)  had important protocol deviations identified prior to database lock for the  DCO. 
One patient was taken off-study (on Day 64;  following Cycle 1) due to non-compliance with  protocol 
requirements. Another patient had a Grade 2 AE of LVEF decrease (result=52%; Day 226;  Pre-Cycle 
9); however, the  ECHO was only repeated on Day 338,  16 weeks later and thus not  3 to 6 weeks after 
the initial  finding as outlined in the protocol. No dose modification was required as a result of this AE 
and the patient  was ongoing selumetinib treatment  at DCO.

Additional information was captured in the ‘other dysfunction’ field for morbidities not falling within the assigned categories.  
Assigned by investigator; patients can have more than one PN-related morbidity.  The “Other dysfunction” category included 
patients with PN pain, swallowing, disfigurement and sensory neuropathy.  Patients with PN pain were captured under the pain 
morbidity category (ie, pain present = yes) and sometimes also captured in the ‘other dysfunction’ field. 
Does not include symptoms recorded as ‘other’.  Pain was included as a PN-related morbidity. 
Lansky performance status was assessed in patients who were 16 years of age or younger and Karnofsky performance status 
was assessed in patients who were older than 16 years of age.  Both the Lansky performance status and the Karnofsky 
performance status scores range from 10 to 100, with higher scores indicating better functioning.

-  Symptoms at baseline 
Forty-seven (94.0%) patients had at least 1 disease-related symptom at baseline and over two-thirds of 
these patients  had either a  maximum Grade 2, Grade 3 or Grade 4 symptom at  baseline (22  [44.0%], 
8  [16.0]  and  4  [8.0%]  patients,  respectively). The  Grade  4  symptoms  at  baseline included:  tracheal 
obstruction  extrinsic (2  [4.0%]  patients),  glaucoma, optic  nerve disorder and respiratory failure (each 
in 1 [2.0%]  patient). 
The most commonly reported symptoms at baseline were muscular weakness (34.0%;  Grade 3: 4.0%), 
limb asymmetry (32.0%;  Grade 3: 4.0%),  tumour pain (32.0%;  Grade 3: 2.0%),  joint range of motion 
decreased (26.0%; Grade 3: 8.0%)  and scoliosis (26.0%;  Grade 3: 6.0%). 
Three  patients  had  PN-related  symptoms  and  clinical  findings  recorded  as  PN-related  morbidities,  as 
assigned by the investigator, at baseline and as medical history/examination findings. 
-  Treatment prior to study  entry 
Overall, 39 (78.0%)  patients had received a prior treatment  for PN and/or another NF1-related tumour, 
with  most patients having had either a medical therapy or surgery, or both.

a Medical therapy directed at other NF1 tumours may also be included. 
b Surgery included 4 patients who had one or two biopsies only and no other prior PN-related surgical procedures.  Other NF1-related 
surgeries may also be included. 
The 2 most common PN-directed medical treatments (>20% of patients) received by these patients were 
interferons  (including  peg-interferon)  and  imatinib.  Eighteen  patients  had  received  a  single  medical 
therapy and the remaining patients had received multiple successive medical therapies.  
In total,  28  (56.0%)  patients  had at least  1 prior PN-related or an NF1-related  surgical procedure. The 
most  common prior  surgical procedure was ‘nervous system  neoplasm surgery’, which  was mostly  PN 
debulking  or  resection  from  various  body  locations.  Many  of  these  patients  had  multiple  prior  PN 
resections.

Response required consecutive confirmation within 3 to 6 months after the criteria for first response were met. Partial response 
= a decrease in the volume of the target PN by 20% or more compared with baseline. 
Partial response was achieved  but either no confirmation assessment was performed or a confirmation assessment was 
performed but the response was not confirmed. 
Insufficient volume change from baseline to qualify for either partial response or progressive disease. 
Increase in the volume of the target PN by 20% or more compared with baseline or the time of best response (maximal PN 
shrinkage) after documenting a partial response. 
Two patients did not contribute to efficacy analyses as they did not have any scheduled post-baseline volumetric MRI scans.

-  Secondary endpoint: Duration of response 
At  the DCO, 32  of 33  patients  with  a response had  been followed for at least  12 months  from onset of 
response. Of the 33 responders, the probability of remaining in response after 12 cycles, estimated using 
the  Kaplan-Meier  method,  was  100%  and  median  DoR from onset  of  response was  not  reached. The 
actual  number (percentage) of patients  remaining in  response after 12  and 24  cycles was  29  (87.9%) 
and 9 (27.3%),  respectively. Only 2 patients  who initially responded had progressed by the DCO.

Pain intensity (NRS-11) 
Of the 24 patients, with physician-selected target tumour scores, who completed both baseline and pre-
Cycle 13  assessments, 12  (50.0%)  patients  showed  improvement of  ≥2  points  (which  was  used  as a 
clinically  meaningful  change [CMT]).  Of  the  12  (50.0%)  patients  who  showed  no  change,  10  patients 
had a pain score of 0 or 1 at baseline and therefore had no possibility to improve by 2 points or more.

There was a trend towards improvement in mobility (as rated by parents) at each time point and a trend 
towards  improvement  in  upper  extremity  physical  function  at  pre-Cycle  25.  Some  patients  showed 
improvement on self-reported mobility total scores (6 of 20 patients, 30.0%)  and upper extremity scores 
(5  of  19  patients,  26.3%),  some patients  showed deterioration  from  baseline to  pre-Cycle 13  for  the

A similar trend  was observed for patients-reported scores, where some patients  showing  improvement 
on mobility total scores (9 of 28  patients, 32.1%) and upper extremity scores (4 of 27 patients, 14.8%) 
Several patients  had  a  score  that  was  too  high  at  baseline  and  therefore  could  not  improve  by  the

c Spearman rank correlations. Correlations with an absolute value greater than 0.3 indicate an adequate anchor (Coon and Cook 
2018). 
n = number of patients with both a score and change in target PN volume recorded at pre-Cycle 13. 
The Spearman rank coefficient (r) for self-report was 0.11,  which indicated  a weak correlation between 
the change in PROMIS self-report score (mobility)  and change in target PN volume. The Spearman rank 
coefficient (r)  for parent-reported was  -0.43,  which  indicated a  moderate positive correlation between 
the  change in PROMIS parent-report score (mobility) and  change in target  PN  volume. This correlation 
for  parent-reported  scores  suggests  that  increasing  PROMIS  T-scores,  which  indicate  better  physical 
functioning, were associated with decreasing target PN volumes. Based on the scatterplots, the majority 
of patients or their parents reported no change or improvement in PROMIS mobility scores when target 
PN volume decreased. 
The  Spearman  rank  coefficients  (r)  for  self-reported  was -0.30,  which  indicated  a  moderate  positive 
correlation and, for the parent-reported was -0.16, which  indicated a weak positive correlation between 
the  PROMIS  scores (upper  extremity)  and  change  in  target  PN  volume.  Most  patients  with  decreased 
target  PN  volume  also reported either  no  change  or improvement  in  PROMIS upper  extremity scores, 
and the parent-reported scores were similar based on the scatterplots.

Patients with  lower extremity PN,  cord compression, or airway PN  did not demonstrate an overall mean 
change from baseline in the  6-minute walk test at pre-Cycle 13. 
3. 
Disfigurement 
Disfigurement  was  measured  by  standardised  photography  for  all  patients  who  had  disfigurement 
assigned as a PN-related morbidity at baseline and at all re staging visits. These images were anonymised 
to ensure that patients  could not be identified and genitalia was also respectfully treated. There was no 
formally planned method of assessing changes in disfigurement. 
Forty-four  patients  (88%)  had  disfigurement and  only 3  patients  had this  as  their  sole morbidity. This 
was the most common morbidity and, given the age of the patients, it was difficult to evaluate the impact 
physically  and  on  the  patients’  well-being.  Individual  patient  reviews  were  generated  to  ascertain 
improvement on  a patient-by-patient  basis, since it was  not possible to summarise this  at a population 
level. 
4. 
Health-related  Quality  of Life (HRQoL):  PedsQL 
Based on  self-reported PedsQL  total  scores, there  were 11/33  patients  with  impaired global  HRQoL  at 
baseline. At pre-Cycle 13,  there were 9 out  of 29  patients with  impaired HRQoL.  For the  29 patients  at 
pre-Cycle 13,  11 (37.9%)  patients  showed improvement of ≥10.33  (CMT).  Of the  12  (41.4%)  patients 
who showed no change, 2 patients had a total score of >89.67 at baseline and therefore had no possibility 
to improve by ≥10.33  (maximum PedsQL total score = 100). 
Based on parent-reported PedsQL total scores, there were 28 out  of 50 patients with  impaired HRQoL at 
baseline. At pre-Cycle 13, there were 16 out of 45 patients with impaired HRQoL. For the 45 patients at 
pre-Cycle 13,  based on a CMT  of 11.90,  24 (53.3%)  patients  showed improvement. Of the  20 (44.4%) 
patients  who  showed no  change, 2  patients  had a  total  score of >88.10  at  baseline and  therefore had 
no possibility to improve by ≥11.90  (maximum PedsQL total score =  100). One (2.2%)  patient  showed 
deterioration at pre-Cycle 13. 
Individual patient  reviews (data  not shown) 
Patient  data  from SPRINT  Phase II  Stratum  1  were  also  presented  in  the  format  of  individual  patient 
reviews to characterise the efficacy of selumetinib at an individual patient level. The aim of each IPR was 
to provide a narrative of the patient’s journey prior to  and during treatment with  selumetinib,  including 
an investigator assessment of whether each patient derived clinical benefit from study treatment. 
Each  IPR  includes  programmed tables  and  figures,  baseline  volumetric MRI  images  of  the  target  PN, 
anonymised photographs,  links  to  anonymised baseline  and  pre-Cycle 13  videos (for  each consenting 
patient with  visible PN), and sections of handwritten  text. Each IPR was concluded with  a brief overview 
of the key efficacy and tolerability observations during the study, provided by an AstraZeneca physician. 
For each patient,  the  relevant Investigator determined whether  or not the  patient  had obtained clinical 
benefit, as described in the IPR charter.

Based on the ICR assessment, using the same REiNS criteria as the NCI POB central analysis, of the 22 
patients  with  confirmed  PR,  7 patients  subsequently  had  disease progression.  Median  DoR  was  32.0

A  sensitivity  analysis  using  the  actual  dates  of  the  volumetric  MRI  assessments  (rather  than  DoR 
estimated  in  cycles  used  for  the  primary  analysis)  was  performed  to  account  for  any  delays  or 
interruptions.  The number (percentage) of patients  remaining in response after 12 and 24  months was 
27  (81.8%)  and  6  (18.2%),  respectively.  When  estimated  using  the  Kaplan-Meier  method,  the 
probability of remaining in response after 12 and 24 months was 100%  and 90.2%,  respectively 
Second ICR of Volumetric MRI  Assessments of Target PN  Only According to the REiNS 
Criteria 
A retrospective sensitivity analysis of volumetric MRI assessments (target PN only) according to the 
REiNS criteria by a second ICR was performed .  
This second ICR was performed according to  the same methodology as the first ICR, i.e. methodology 
that  is not fully in line with  the PA recommendations. Although  the reviewers were blinded to visit date 
and visit name, they were presented images of each patient  in a sequential order. 
Target PN Volume over time 
A summary of the  best percentage change from baseline statistics  is presented in Table 38.  Overall 
there was a reduction in target PN  volume consistently detected by all reads (NCI POB, and first and 
second ICR reads).

Impact of dose reductions and interruptions on tumour growth 
In  SPRINT  Phase  II  Stratum  1,  all  50  patients  had  at  least  1  dose  interruption.  AEs  leading  to  dose 
reduction  of  selumetinib  were  reported in  12  (24.0%)  patients.  Discontinuation  of  selumetinib  due  to 
AEs was observed in  6  (12.0%).  Of the  12  patients  who had  at least  1 dose reduction due  to an  AE, 4 
patients had a second dose reduction. 
A  graphical longitudinal  analysis was  performed to  plot  target  PN  growth  rate  in  patients  with  2  dose 
reductions  (4/50  patients),  patients  with  1  dose reduction  (8/50  patients)  and  patients  with  no  dose 
reduction but  with cumulative interruptions  (consecutive or not) between 2 assessments of either more 
than 28  days (6/50  patients) or less than 28  days (32/50  patients). 
Tumour volume increases have been observed in patients with 2 dose reductions or with a dose reduction 
in addition to  prolonged interruptions.

Supplementary post hoc analyses of ORR, DoR and PFS were also presented, using all evaluable 
available volumetric MRI scans, regardless of schedule and regardless of treatment discontinuation, 
and using actual study day as opposed to number of cycles received. 
ORR 
ORR by this  analysis was 66.0%  (33/50;  95% CI: 51.2,  78.8), i.e. the same as by the analysis 
including only the scheduled scans. 
DoR 
For DoR, the  results of this  analysis corresponded exactly to the results of the  sensitivity analysis using 
actual dates (see above). 
PFS 
A KM plot showing PFS based on all available volumetric MRI scans is presented in Figure 31. According 
to this  analysis, 6/50 (12.0%)  patients  progressed, i.e., 3 more patients than were found to have 
progressed using the PFS primary analytical method. 
PFS is defined as the time from study treatment initiation until the date of objective disease progression or death (by any cause in 
the absence of progression). Patients not known to have progressed at the time of analysis are censored at the date of last 
evaluable on-treatment volumetric MRI assessment.  
The values at the base of the figure indicate number of patients at risk. Dots represent censored observations. 
PFS  Progression-free survival.

•  NCI POB NF1  Natural  History study 
Design of Natural History study 
The Natural  History study is a prospective study in patients with NF1,  which is sponsored and conducted 
by the NCI POB. This study  serves as an umbrella protocol for NCI  POB’s clinical study programme and 
the scope of this  study is broader than the data being presented for this application. 
The  Natural  History  study  enrols both  paediatric  and adult  patients  aged ≤35  years old  with  a clinical 
diagnosis of NF1 or a confirmed NF1  mutation, patients are not required to have PN-related morbidity at 
enrolment. There is no  upper age limit  for patients  previously enrolled on  clinical studies at  the  NIH  or 
for patients diagnosed with Malignant  peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNST), or with clinical concern 
for  MPNST,  or  with  infrequent  or  unusual  NF1-related  manifestations.  Patients  must  have  an  ECOG 
performance status  ≤3.  There are no restrictions  in this  study regarding prior treatment  (e.g., surgery 
or radiation) or received investigational therapies (including selumetinib) within  clinical studies including 
the  SPRINT protocol. The  Natural  History  study plans  to  enrol up  to  250  patients,  with  evaluations for 
up to 10  years after the last patient  is enrolled to allow analysis over a meaningful duration of time. 
Enrolment started in 2008  and was ongoing at the  DCO for this application. 
Use as external control for SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1 
The  volumetric MRI  analyses were performed by  a  central reviewer at  the  NCI  POB.  For  patients  with 
multiple  PN  in  the  NH  study  only 1 PN  per  patient  was  selected by  NCI  POB for analysis  and only  the 
volumetric MRI data of the same PN in  each patient,  which  had been followed up for the  longest period 
of  time,  not  affected  by  surgery  and  prior  to  treatment  with  any  MEK  inhibitor,  was  selected  to  be 
included in the NH  analysis. 
NH  study data were presented using  3 analysis sets: 
• 
• 
For the patients in the full NH  analysis set (all ages and who have at least 2 volumetric MRI scans), 
the first  volumetric MRI analysis was used as the baseline PN assessment. The final volumetric MRI 
assessment  was  considered  to  be  the  last  volumetric  MRI  assessment  or  last  volumetric  MRI 
assessment prior to the first use of a MEK inhibitor  including selumetinib. 
The primary analysis set used as an external control for SPRINT data is the age-matched  cohort. 
This  is  a subset  of  the  full  NH  analysis set  including  patients  with  at  least  2  volumetric MRI  scans 
where  the  first  volumetric  MRI  scan  done  within  the  age range  of  3  to  18 years was  used  as the 
baseline PN  assessment for the  NH  study. The  final  volumetric MRI assessment was  considered to 
Assessment report  
EMA/549867/2021  
Page 111/164 
 
 
 
  
 
 
be the last  volumetric MRI  assessment or last volumetric MRI assessment prior to the  first use of a 
MEK inhibitor  including selumetinib. 
• 
For the patients enrolled into the NH  study who then enrolled into SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1, where 
there was volumetric MRI data of the same PN that was followed up during both studies (i.e. the NH 
subset),  the  first  volumetric  MRI  analysis  was  used  as  the  baseline  PN  assessment.  The  final 
volumetric  MRI  assessment  was  considered  to  be  the  last  volumetric  MRI  assessment  or  last 
volumetric MRI  assessment prior to  the  first  use of a  MEK  inhibitor  including  selumetinib.  Of  note, 
for patients in the NH subset, the target PN followed in the overall NH analysis may be different from 
the  target  PN  followed in  the  NH  subset  analysis. Two  paediatric patients  who  participated in  both 
studies were excluded from this dataset  as different PN were followed in  the NH  study and SPRINT 
Phase II Stratum 1. 
Analyses were presented based on the following time periods for all 3 analysis sets: 
•  All available follow-up (i.e., maximum of 17.7  years): From the first volumetric MRI assessment date 
up to  the  last available volumetric MRI assessment or last assessment date  prior to  the  first use of 
a MEK inhibitor,  including selumetinib. 
•  Aligned to maximum follow-up duration  of SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1 (i.e.,  2.8 years). 
PN growth rates for the patients in the NH study and SPRINT Phase II stratum 1 were evaluated using 
2 different methods: crude estimation and mixed models: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
For  the NH  study,  crude PN  growth rate  was defined as the  percent change in PN  volume from the 
first to the last volumetric MRI assessment over the time period in years, where the time period was 
defined  from  the  first  to  the  last  available  volumetric  MRI  assessment  or  last  volumetric  MRI 
assessment date prior  to  the  first  use of a  MEK  inhibitor,  including  selumetinib.  This estimate  was 
also  derived for  the  time  period  aligned  to  the  maximum  follow-up  duration  observed in  SPRINT 
Phase II Stratum 1, i.e., 2.8 years. 
For SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1,  crude PN growth  rate was defined as the  percent change in  target 
PN  volume from the  baseline volumetric MRI  to  the  last  volumetric MRI  assessment over the  time 
period in  years, where  the  time  period  was  defined from  the  baseline volumetric  MRI  assessment 
date to the last evaluable assessment date up to data cut-off or treatment discontinuation (whichever 
occurred first). 
For the NH study, only for the full and age-matched analysis sets, a random coefficient mixed model 
was  fitted  to  get  adjusted  estimates  for  growth  rate.  The  model  included  percent  change  from 
baseline  in  PN  volume  as  response, subject  and  time  as  a  random  effects  and  baseline  age  and 
baseline  PN  volume  as  fixed  effects,  using  an  unstructured  covariance  matrix.  This  model  was 
repeated to include only data up to 2.8  years follow-up, to align with the maximum follow-up duration 
in SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1. 
For  SPRINT  Phase II  stratum  1,  a  repeated measure mixed  model  was  fitted.  It  included  percent 
change from baseline in PN  volume as response, subject and  time (continuous)  as random effects, 
baseline age and baseline PN volume as fixed effects and visit as a repeated measure, using a spatial 
power covariance matrix. 
The adjusted mean was presented for each study and is the predicted percentage growth from baseline 
after  1  year for  a  patient  of  median  age  and  target  PN  volume  at  baseline (based  on  the  medians  in 
SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1). 
The following analyses/matching strategies were performed using the age-matched cohort: 
1.  Naïve comparison (without  using propensity score); 
Assessment report  
EMA/549867/2021  
Page 112/164 
 
 
 
2.  Matched 1:1  (without  replacement) with  a robust variance; 
3.  Weighted using stabilised IPTW; 
4.  Weighted using IPTW with  a robust variance; and 
5.  Matched 1:2  (with  replacement) with  a robust variance. 
Median PFS  with  95%  CIs was calculated using a KM  plot for the full  NH  analysis set  and age-matched 
cohort.  This  analysis  was  also repeated  for  the  time  period  aligned  to  maximum  follow-up  in  SPRINT 
(i.e., 2.8 years). In the NH  study, progression was defined as a ≥20%  increase in PN volume compared 
with  baseline and PFS was defined as the  time from the first  volumetric MRI assessment to  the date of 
documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression. 
Baseline data 
Demographic and  disease characteristics at  baseline for the  NH  study and  SPRINT Phase II Stratum  1 
are summarised in  
Table 45. At baseline, median age and baseline target PN volume were higher in SPRINT Phase II Stratum 
1 than in  the full NH  cohort and the age-matched cohort, and unsurprisingly the NH  subset. 
The number of patients  who (had) received a prior medical treatment for PN was 72 (64.9%) in the full 
NH cohort and 31 (62.0%) in SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1. In both the most common PN-directed medical 
treatment was pegylated interferon. During the course of the NH  study, patients were able to remain on 
or  start  medical  treatment  for  NF1-related  manifestations;  therefore,  the  given  proportion  includes 
medical treatments  at  baseline and  during  the  study.  In the  NH  study,  the  medications  received were 
either  investigational  or  were  used  off  label.  For  patients  who  received  a  MEK  inhibitor,  such  as 
selumetinib,  during  the  NH  study,  data  collected during  the  MEK  inhibitor  treatment  period have been 
excluded from all analyses.

PN volume change  
Age-matched cohort 
In the  Natural  History  age-matched cohort aligned to  maximum follow-up  duration in  SPRINT Phase II 
Stratum  1,  PN  volume  change  from  baseline  ranged  from  -4.1%  (shrinkage)  per  year  to  +147.9% 
(growth)  per  year.  In  contrast,  in  SPRINT  Phase  II  Stratum  1,  the  PN  volume  change  from  baseline 
ranged from -27.3%  (shrinkage) per year to +19.0%  (growth)  per year. The adjusted mean annual PN 
growth  rate  was  +21.3%  (95%  CI:  15.9,  26.8)  in  the  Natural  History  age-matched  cohort,  versus -
16.9%  (95% CI: -20.2, -13.5)  per year in SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1.

NH  subset 
In total, 9 patients who enrolled into the NH  study then enrolled into SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1, where 
there was volumetric MRI data of the same PN across both studies. 
From  baseline to  final  post-baseline  volumetric MRI  assessment, the  median  absolute and  percentage 
change for the NH  subset whilst in the NH  study was 254.0 mL (range 51, 1353) and 118.4%  (range 17, 
343), respectively. For the same 9 patients whilst in SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1 this was -72.0 mL (range

Full  NH  analysis set 
From  baseline to  final  post-baseline  volumetric MRI  assessment, the  median  absolute and  percentage 
change  for  the  full  NH  analysis  set  was  +222.0  mL  (range  -370,  +4725)  and  +73.4%  (range  -40, 
+1429), respectively. For SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1 this was -107.5 mL (range -964, +90) and -22.3% 
(range  -55,  +30),  respectively.  Four  patients  out  of  111  had  spontaneous  shrinkage  of  ≥20%  from 
baseline, which  was  achieved after 4-14  years on  the  NH  study  and  at  which  time  these four  patients 
were aged 21-33 years. There was no spontaneous PN shrinkage of ≥20% within  1 year. 
When  aligned  to  maximum  follow-up  duration  in  SPRINT  Phase II  Stratum  1,  the  median PN  volume 
change  from  baseline  for  the  full  NH  analysis  set  was  17.8%  per  year (range -5.1%  to  245.0%).  In 
SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1, it  was -10.2% (range -27.3% to  19.0%). 
For  the  full  NH  analysis  set,  plots  of  absolute  and  percentage  target  PN  volume  change  in  individual 
patients  over the  maximum 17.7  years follow-up  and over a follow-up  of 2.8  years, i.e.  aligned to  the

Progressive-free survival (PFS) 
Definition 
SRINT:  PFS  is  defined  as  the  time  from  study  treatment  initiation  to  the  pre-cycle  of  documented 
progression or death in  the absence of disease progression.  
Natural  History:  PFS  is  defined  as  the  time  from  first  volumetric  MRI  assessment  to  the  date  of 
documented  progression or  death  in  the  absence of  disease progression.  Patients  not  known  to  have 
progressed or died at the time of analysis were censored at the last available volumetric MRI assessment 
date  or  last  volumetric  MRI  assessment  date  prior  to  the  first  use  of  a  MEK  inhibitor,  including 
selumetinib. 
Age-matched cohort 
In the  Natural  History  age-matched cohort aligned to  maximum follow-up  duration in  SPRINT Phase II 
Stratum  1,  the  majority  of patients  had  progressed (76.1%).  Median  PFS  in  the Natural  History  age-
matched cohort was  1.3 years (95% CI 1.1,  1.6)  with  the  probability of remaining without  progressive 
disease after 2  years of 30.4%  (95%  CI 21.0,  40.3).  The probability of  remaining without  progressive 
disease after 2 years on SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1 was 94.7% [95% CI: 80.6, 98.7].  The median PFS 
could not  be  estimated because most  patients  were still  in  response. Note  that  at  2  years, 29  patients 
were still  followed in the Natural  history group versus 16 in the SPRINT Phase II stratum  1 (and none in 
either group after 3 years). 
Propensity analyses supported  the  primary analyses: PFS  hazard ratio was  0.08  (95%  CI:  0.02,  0.29) 
for the primary method (PSM 1:1) and was 0.09 for both PSM with  replacement and IPTW methods.

When including all available follow-up, the number of PFS events (progression or death) in the NH study 
age-matched cohort  was 80  (87.0%),  i.e.  78  progressions (84.8%)  and 2  deaths  (2.2%).  Median  PFS 
was 1.3  years (95% CI: 1.1, 1.6). The probability of remaining without progression at 1 year was 64.1% 
(95% CI: 53.4,  73.0) and at 2 years 32.7%  (95% CI: 23.3, 42.4).

period, as well as with all available follow-up  
•  Placebo arm of tipifarnib Study  01-C-0222 
Study  01-C-0222  was  sponsored by  CTEP  and  coordinated  by  the  NCI  POB. This  was  a  multi-centre, 
double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomised, cross-over study of tipifarnib (R115777)  in children and 
young adults (≥3 and ≤25 years) with  a clinical diagnosis of NF1  and unresectable, progressive PN with 
the potential to cause significant morbidity (progressive ≥20% increase in PN volume, or ≥13% increase 
in  2-dimensional,  or  ≥6%  increase in  1-dimensional  measurement over last  2  consecutive  volumetric 
MRI scans or within  approximately 1 year prior to trial evaluation).  
Patients were randomised to receive tipifarnib (200  mg/m² orally every 12 hours) or placebo (Phase A) 
and  crossed over to  the  opposite treatment  arm at  the  time  of PN  progression (Phase B). In  each 28-
day treatment  cycle, study treatment was administered for 21 days followed by a 7-day rest period. 
PN  growth  during  the  study  was  monitored using  volumetric  MRI.  Volumetric MRI  of  up  to  3  PNs  was 
performed prior to  the  start  of Cycles 1, 4,  7  and 10  and then  after every 6 cycles (1  cycle=28 days). 
All volumetric MRIs were sent to the  NCI POB for central analysis. A volumetric increase of ≥20%  in at 
least  1  PN  (any  measurable lesion, regardless of  whether  it  was  target  or  non-target)  compared  with 
baseline was defined as progressive disease. In the tipifarnib study there was no differentiation between 
whether the lesion was a target or non-target PN in  the assessment of progression.

Use as external control for SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1 
The placebo arm from Phase A (first  period of cross-over; N=29)  of the study  was used as an external 
control for patients from SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1 for TTP and PFS endpoints. Patients in  the placebo 
arm of Phase A ranged in  age from ≥3  to ≤18 years.  
KM curves for PFS  and TTP were produced separately for the placebo arm of the tipifarnib study during 
Phase A, all  patients  in SPRINT Phase II Stratum  1  and patients  from SPRINT Phase II  Stratum 1  with 
progressive PN at enrolment. Median PFS and TTP were calculated from the corresponding KM plot, with 
95% CIs. 
To  enhance  comparability  between  the  placebo  arm  of  the  tipifarnib  study  and  SPRINT  Phase II 
Stratum 1,  a further analysis that  considered only the  target PN  lesions in the  tipifarnib study  (and not 
the  non-target  lesions)  was  implemented  post  hoc.  Progression for  the  placebo  arm  of  the  tipifarnib 
study  was  programmatically derived  by  the  Applicant  considering  only  the  target  PN  lesions  and  an 
additional PFS/TTP analysis was performed.

Using  the  subgroup  of  patients  from  SPRINT  Phase  II  Stratum  1  with  progressive PN  at  enrolment 
(N=21/50),  the  probability  of  remaining without  progression at  2  years was higher  (88.9%  [95%  CI: 
62.4,  97.1]) than  the placebo arm of tipifarnib  Study 01-C-0222. 
Includes  patients with progressive  disease in the 18 months prior to enrolment to SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1. 
PFS is defined as the time from study treatment/placebo initiation until the pre-cycle/date of objective 
progression  or death (by any cause in the absence  of progression)  for SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1/placebo arm of 
tipifarnib Study 01-C-0222, respectively. 
Patients not known to have progressed  or died at the time of analysis are censored  at the last evaluable 
volumetric MRI  assessment known to be non-progression. 
Figure 36: Kaplan-Meier plot of PFS, placebo arm of tipifarnib  Study 01-C-0222: Phase A and SPRINT 
Phase II Stratum 1 (Progressive PN) 
An analysis of PFS/TTP in the placebo arm of the tipifarnib Study 01-C-0222 (Phase A), which considered 
only  the  target  PN  lesions,  was  performed  to  enhance  comparability  with  the  SPRINT  study.  In  this 
analysis,  of  the  23  patients  who  progressed, 19  patients  progressed based on  target  PNs  only  and  4 
patients  progressed due to  non-target  PNs  only and were censored at  the date  of progression on non-
target lesions, which corresponded to their last available MRI assessment. 
The probability of remaining without  progression at 2 years in the  placebo arm of tipifarnib Study 01-C-
0222,  was  23.5%  (95%  CI: 8.8,  42.3).  An early and maintained  separation over time  in  favour of the 
patients from SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1 was observed when reviewing Kaplan-Meier curves of PFS. 
Supportive study 
See section 2.5.1.  Dose response study. 
Swallowability of Selumetinib  10 mg and 25 mg Hard Capsules 
Selumetinib  is  formulated  as  a  size  4  capsule measuring  approximately 14  mm  in  length  x  5  mm  in 
width.  The capsules cannot be crushed or broken and therefore the ability to swallow the capsules whole 
was  an  entry  requirement  for  the  SPRINT  study.  Training  to  swallow  capsules was  provided  to  those 
patients  who  needed it.  Patients  who  were identified  as having difficulty  in  swallowing  the  selumetinib 
capsule practiced with different surrogates i.e. hard candy of appropriate size (11.8 mm in length and 7 
mm in width  and/or 10.4  mm in diameter).

Of 74 patients enrolled in both SPRINT Phase I and Phase II Stratum 1, 46 patients  were <12  years. Of 
these 10 required training. After training all 10  patients successfully showed their ability  to swallow the 
capsules and they were subsequently recruited in  the studies.  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The application is based on a single open-label, single arm, multi-centre  phase I/II study developed by 
investigators at the National Cancer Institute  (NCI),  and coordinated by the  NCI Paediatric Oncology 
Branch. The Applicant reviewed the protocol and provided selumetinib for the  trial. 
Additionally, the Applicant used as external control: 
- 
- 
Data from a Natural History non interventional prospective study conducted by the NCI POB.  
Data from patients included in  the placebo arm of a tipifarnib randomised placebo controlled in 
children and young adults with  NF1  and progressive PN.  
SPRINT phase I was a multicentre, open-label, single arm, dose escalation study conducted in children 
with  NF1  and inoperable PN designed to  assess the safety of selumetinib and to identify the 
recommended phase II dose. There was no primary efficacy endpoint for this  study. The key secondary 
objective was the percentage PN volume change, calculated from measurements taken using 
volumetric MRI analysis. Partial response (defined as target  PN volume decrease ≥20% from baseline 
for ≥4 weeks) was observed in 66.7 % patients,  8.3% patients had an unconfirmed partial response 
and 20.8% a stable disease. 
Initially, the doses to be tested ranged from 20  mg/m² BID (corresponding to 50 % of the fixed adult 
dose in  cancer) to 50 mg/m² BID by steps of 10  mg. Two doses were tested 20  and 30  mg/m². 
However, following  the publication of a trial (Banerjee et al. 2017)  conducted concurrently by the 
Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium in low-grade selumetinib-treated glioma in which the maximum 
tolerated dose was determined to  be 25 mg/m² the  trial was amended to evaluate this  additional dose 
level and 6 patients were treated with this  dose.  On the basis of the available data, the 25 mg/m² 
dose was chosen as Recommended Phase II dose. When compared to 20 mg/m², efficacy results 
supported this choice. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
SPRINT Phase II (pivotal study) is an open label, non-controlled, single arm, multi-center  study to 
assess efficacy and safety of selumetinib in children (aged 2 to 18  years old) with  NF1  and PN could 
not be surgically completely removed without risk for substantial  morbidity due to  encasement of, or 
close proximity to, vital structures, invasiveness or high vascularity of the PN.  Patients were enrolled in 
one of the  2 strata based on the presence or not  of PN-related morbidity; Stratum 1: PN-related 
morbidity present at  enrolment; stratum  2: no morbidity present at enrolment but potential  for PN-
related morbidity. 
The inclusion was not limited to patients  with  progressive PN. The eligibility criteria are in general 
considered acceptable. 
Due to  the absence of approved medical treatment and the severity of the condition, the Applicant 
considered unethical to conduct  a placebo-controlled study and that  it was appropriate to  conduct a 
single-arm open label study. However, and as was noted at  follow-up Protocol Assistance (PA), 
relatively large-scale placebo-controlled studies in children with NF1  do appear in principle feasible 
(e.g. Payne et al. 2016 [n=146]).  The choice to perform a single-arm study can be understood, but 
this has implications for the overall strength of evidence. Because of the  lack of a comparator in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/549867/2021  
Page 121/164 
 
 
 
pivotal study, a comparison with  external controls, i.e. the tipifarnib study and the NH  study, was 
provided to contextualise and help interpreting the results obtained with  selumetinib.  
Selumetinib is available as capsules (10  and 25 mg). All patients received 25 mg/m² BID orally with  a 
maximum of 50 mg/m² BID. The dose was calculated according to  the body surface of the child which 
evolves with growth  and it  was  not possible to  precisely adjust the  dose according to the  weight and 
height evolution in the  absence of a suitable pharmaceutical form as the  accuracy of the dose could not 
be less than  5 mg to 10 mg. Furthermore patients with  a BSA <0.55 m² (dosage < 10 mg BID) could 
not be included and the dose had to be rounded to the nearest 5 or 10 mg. However, exposure – 
response analyses of SPRINT Phase I and Phase II (Stratum 1),  suggest that  higher exposures might 
be more beneficial.  
Selumetinib is formulated as a size 4 capsule measuring approximately 14 mm in length x 5 mm in 
width.  The capsules cannot be crushed or broken. In both parts of the  study, only patients  able to 
swallow capsules were included. After training,  all patients  in the pivotal study were able to swallow 
the capsules, however given limited number of patients these data are not considered sufficient to 
conclude that the product is age-appropriate in general. In addition,  the capsules must be taken on an 
empty stomach 1  hour before or 2 hours after meal and with water only, which can pose a problem of 
acceptability and compliance for the youngest children. 
The Applicant is currently developing an age-appropriate formulation  more suitable for young children 
as reflected in the paediatric investigation plan and plan to  submit a MAA line extension by 2024. The 
future selumetinib  formulation might  also provide better dose flexibility. The MAH  should update the 
CHMP  regarding the development of the new formulation in the context of the annual renewals. 
The primary endpoint was defined as the percentage of patients with  complete response or confirmed 
partial response (PR), with PR defined as target Plexiform Neurofibroma (PN)  decrease ≥20% 
compared to baseline. Responses were considered confirmed if the PR was maintained at the 
subsequent MRI scan within  3  to 6 months after first response. Responses were assessed by NCI POB 
central analysis using 3D-volumetric MRI according to REiNS recommendations for imaging tumour 
response in neurofibromatosis clinical trials. Assessment was performed by a single reader which is 
considered subjective. It was therefore recommended during protocol assistance that the  primary 
outcome was assessed by an average of ≥2 readers, who are independent and blinded for patient 
exposition and time  point, and that  sequential presentation of images from the same patient  is avoided 
(via random presentation). Since a discrepancy between the investigator-based ORR and the  first 
Independent Review-based ORR was observed (NCI-POB ORR of 66.0% and the ICR ORR of 44.0%),  a 
retrospective sensitivity analysis of volumetric MRI assessments (target PN only) according to  the 
REiNS criteria by a second ICR was performed. However, this second ICR was performed according to 
the same methodology as the  first ICR, i.e. methodology that  was not fully in line with  the protocol 
assistance recommendations. Although  the reviewers were blinded to visit date and visit name, they 
were presented images of each patient  in a sequential order. 
The secondary endpoints, clinical outcomes assessment (COAs) covered a wide range of clinical 
endpoints such as pain intensity (NRS-11),  pain interference (PII), motor function (strength,  range of 
motion, 6-minute  walk test, PROMIS), airway function (FEV,  Apnoea-Hypopnoea), bowel and bladder 
function,  disfigurement, vision function,  and quality  of life (PedSQL).  
In this setting,  clinical outcome assessments are considered critical to demonstrate the clinical 
relevance of the observed tumour reduction. However, due to the  open-label design, the lack of a 
comparator treatment arm and the small sample size, the  interpretability of the  clinical outcome 
endpoints is challenging. It is, however, agreed that  symptoms and impact may vary based on the 
location and extent of PNs, and thus  the use of multiple COAs can be understood. Many of the COAs 
applied to subsets of the  study population only due to PN-specific morbidity and age-based restrictions. 
Assessment report  
EMA/549867/2021  
Page 122/164 
 
 
 
Also, not all COAs used in the pivotal study were validated for, or reliable measures specific to the 
target NF1  population with  symptomatic, inoperable PN. Therefore, the applied clinically meaningful 
thresholds (CMTs) are disputable. The NRS-11,  PII and PROMIS instruments are recommended by the 
REiNS International Collaboration for the assessment of pain and physical functioning  in NF  clinical 
trials. These PRO instruments were applied in the  study to age categories that  differ only slightly from 
those recommended by the REiNS International Collaboration (see PN-associated clinical symptoms). 
This is acceptable for these secondary endpoints that  are not regarded key. The results of all other 
COAs (airway function (FEV, Apnoea-Hypopnoea), bowel and bladder function,  vision function,  6MWT), 
however, are thus  of uncertain value. 
The secondary endpoints DoR, PFS, TTP, and TTR are similarly, to the primary endpoint ORR, based on 
the NCI POB central analysis of PN volume and the  changes in PN volume over time. These secondary 
endpoints are thus  liable to the same (possible) subjectivity. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The pivotal study included 50 patients, aged from 3.5 to  17.4 years (median 10.2 y; mean 10.3  y) at 
enrolment. Male represented 60% of the population. White  subjects (84%)  were the most presented 
patients.  
At baseline, 78% of the patients  had prior disease-related treatment. Prior medication were taken by 62 
% of the patients and 56 % had prior surgery. As per investigator assessment, pain related to the target 
PN was present in half of the patients  (52%). 
The Objective Response Rate, based on NCI POB analysis was 66.0% (95% IC 51.2, 78.8). No patients 
had a complete response, 33 (66.0%)  patients had a confirmed PR (volume decrease ≥ 20% confirmed 
within  3 to  6  months  after first  response), 4  (8.0%)  had an  unconfirmed PR and  11  (22%)  had stable 
disease (volume change < 20%). No patients had a progression and 2 patients did not participate to this 
evaluation due to  the absence of post  baseline MRI scan. 
Most  responders (27/33  = 81.8%)  maintained 20%  shrinkage from baseline during the  study  (median 
follow  up 24 cycles). 
According to  a  sensitivity  analysis by  first  ICR,  an  ORR  of  44%  was  observed.  No  patient  had  a  best 
objective response of progressive disease, 5 (10.0%)  patients had  an unconfirmed PR and 21 (42.0%) 
patients  had  stable  disease.  In  line  with  the  drop  in  ORR,  the  median  best  percentage  change  from 
baseline in target  PN volume dropped to  -22.05%. 
The  results  of  the  second  ICR  showed  that  the  trajectories  of  PN  growth  were  largely  in  the  same 
direction.  Furthermore,  there  appeared  to  be  considerable  agreement  between  both  ICR  reads,  and 
reasonable agreement between  these  and  the  NCI  POB  read. The  second ICR  ORR  was  40%  and  the 
average ICR ORR was 44.0%. 
Median  duration  of  response  was  not  reached  as  at  DCO,  only  2  of  the  33  responders  progressed. 
However, as by definition the response for each patient required confirmation within  3 to 6 months after 
the criterion for the first response was met, there is a guarantee-time bias introduced into the follow-up 
times (i.e. any patient  who had an increase in  tumour size before the  second assessment would not  be 
included in the  subset of patients  by definition). Median DoR is thus quite  long compared to the 3-to-6-
month guarantee-time bias. DoR sensitivity analysis confirmed the  results of the primary analysis. 
Median PFS was not reached as at DCO only 3 of the 33 responders progressed. Because no patient died 
during the study, the  TTP results were identical  to the PFS results. 
Assessment report  
EMA/549867/2021

There is little, and thus no robust data concerning the evolution of the tumour in case of discontinuation 
of selumetinib, and consequently a rationale for continuing therapy once the decrease in tumour volume 
has stabilized, has not  been established. 
The median TTR of 8 cycles (~8 months) is considered quite lengthy and, in the published article on the 
pivotal study,  it is  stated that  the  median time to best response was 16  cycles (Gross et al. 2020),  i.e. 
twice  as  long.  Considering the  limited  data  and  that  some  patients  achieved  a  late  response, a  strict 
recommendation on the need to re-evaluate the interest of continuing treatment in the event of absence 
of response is not  considered appropriate at this stage. The proposed recommendation in section 4.2 of 
the  SmPC that  treatment  with  Koselugo should continue  as long as clinical  benefit is observed, or until 
PN progression or the development of unacceptable toxicity is acceptable. 
Concerning the pain  linked to the  target tumour,  the NRS-11  instrument  was used in patients  aged ≥8 
years. Moreover, baseline and pre-Cycle 13 data was available for less than  half of the patients aged ≥8 
years. A ‘clinically meaningful’ improvement was observed in half of these, i.e. approximately one in four 
patients of the FAS. An evaluation of the correlation between the reduction of the tumour and the clinical 
effect  was  carried out  by  applying  the  correlation coefficients  of  Spearman.  In  the  14  patients  with  a 
pain  threshold  ≥  2  with  baseline, there  was  a  tendency to  a  positive  correlation  between  the  clinical 
improvement is the reduction of the tumour (r = 0.13). 
The influence of pain on daily functioning  showed some improvement in  the score mainly supported by 
the scores reported by the  parents. The correlation between shrinking tumour  and PII was weak. Effect 
on tumour reported pain and global pain was also assessed by the GIC, individually some improvement 
was observed. 
The effect  on motility  was assessed using  self-PROMIS, and  parent reported PROMIS score. A  positive 
trend  was  reported  as rated  by  parents  but  not  for  self-evaluation. At  individual  level, some  patients 
showed  a  meaningful  improvement but  most  of  the  patients  showed  no  change.  The  correlation was 
moderate for self-reported score and weak for parent reported score regarding upper extremity score. 
At  baseline, disfigurement was the  most  common morbidity (44/50  patients  88%).  It  was captured  by 
standardised photography and  there was  no formally planned method  evaluating changes. It  was  only 
evaluated at a patient  level and difficult to assess through  the data provided. 
The effect on quality of life was assessed through the PedsQL. There was a positive trend on the parent-
reported data which  was  less apparent on  the  self-reported data.  However, the  open-label trial design 
limits interpretability those endpoints as patient’s and parent’s knowledge of treatment assignment may 
lead to an overestimation of treatment  effect. 
Overall, the  figures show a trend towards an improvement in some treated patients,  even if there is no 
statistical  correlation between the decrease in the tumour and any clinical improvement at a population 
level, although  some improvement in some clinical outcomes has been observed at an individual level.  
In order to try to highlight  a link between  the evolution of the tumour and the clinical outcomes, 
the  Applicant produced a table summarizing for each patient the  clinical data at  baseline (age, number 
of tumours, location of the target tumour, morbidities), the overall response, the rate of evolution of the 
volume of the tumour, the clinical responses observed, the evolution of the  disfigurement as well as the 
treatment  discontinuations  and  modifications  dose  (data  not  shown).  However,  the  Investigator’s 
assessment and the Applicant’s summary of benefit are post-hoc and therefore likely biased in this open-
label, single-arm study. 
It is very plausible and has been shown that  larger PNs cause more symptoms/morbidity (Nguyen et al. 
2011)  and/or that increases in  PN volume are associated with  increased symptoms/morbidity (Gross et 
Assessment report  
EMA/549867/2021  
Page 124/164 
 
 
 
al. 2018). Therefore, the reverse could be considered equally plausible, i.e. that decreases in PN volume 
are associated with  decreased symptoms/morbidity. 
Overall, the  individual  improvement, confirmed by investigator’s assessment associated with  a durable 
reduction in tumour  volume should be considered relevant in the  context of a seriously debilitating  rare 
disease and a high  unmet medical need. 
•  Supportive data 
In addition to the SPRINT Phase II stratum 1 study, data from the Natural History study and the placebo 
arm of tipifarnib study  were used as external control. 
In  the  tipifarnib  study  only  patients  with  progressive PNs  were  enrolled, whereas  in  the  pivotal  study 
patients were enrolled regardless of PN status at  baseline. Median target PN volume was over 1.5 times 
higher in SPRINT Phase II Stratum  1 when compared to  the tipifarnib  study. In the  scientific literature, 
it has been observed that larger PNs are associated with  slower growth. Notwithstanding  the differences 
in study design and patient population, the difference in PFS/TTP between the tipifarnib study and SPRINT 
Phase II Stratum 1 (progressive PN only) is clearly apparent from the KM curves.  
The NH  study  had a non-interventional/observational study design and its  eligibility  criteria allowed for 
a far broader patient  population to be enrolled than in SPRINT Phase II Stratum  1.  
Median age was ~2  years higher and median target PN volume was ~1.5  times higher in  SPRINT Phase 
II  Stratum  1  when  compared to  the  NH  study  full  analysis set  and  age-matched  cohort.  For  the  vast 
majority of PNs in the  NH  study age-matched cohort the natural course seems to  be to grow or at best 
stay  stable  over  time.  The  median  PN  growth  rate  observed in  the  NH  study  age-matched  cohort 
(15.1%/year to 21.3%/year) appears to be at the  high end of what has been described in literature. In 
some  patients,  spontaneous  shrinkage of  the  target  PN  was  observed, but  there  was  never a  >20% 
change in PN volume from baseline or a decrease of ≥20% within  1 year. These observations are also in 
line with the scientific literature in which spontaneous shrinkage of PNs is described, but never exceeding 
-20%/year. The negative median growth  rate (i.e. a decrease in  volume) observed in the pivotal study 
compares favourably. The  difference in  PFS/TTP  between  the  NH  study  age-matched cohort  and  the 
pivotal study is clearly apparent from the KM curves. The results of the full NH  analysis set were similar 
to the results of the age-matched cohort, both  for PN  growth rate as well as for PFS. 
While a beneficial effect on PFS is observed, the exact magnitude of this  effect remains unknown. 
Both  external controls  could provide some useful context  data,  however considering the  heterogeneity 
of the baseline populations (age, disease progression, tumour volume) and the possible bias, it is difficult 
to carry out relevant comparative analyses between these 2 external controls and the pivotal study. 
Supportive data from SPRINT Phase I were also presented. All efficacy results were similar to  those of 
the  pivotal  study.  It  is  noted  that  in  SPRINT Phase  I  the  definition/classification  of  response was  not 
according to  the  REiNS  criteria.  The responses appeared quite  durable. No  dose-response relationship 
was apparent in the  Waterfall plot  of best percentage change from baseline in target PN volume. 
Additional expert consultation 
Upon  request  from  the  CHMP,  an  ad  hoc  expert  group  meeting  (AHEG)  was  convened on  9  February 
2021.  The AHEG answers to the CHMP  questions on efficacy aspects are as follows: 
1.  To what  extent  does a response as measured by the REINS response definition (Dombi 
et al.  2013) represent patient  benefit per se, and to what extent  would support by 
results from clinical outcome assessments (COAs) be  required? 
Assessment report  
EMA/549867/2021  
Page 125/164 
 
 
 
It was agreed that  response as measured by REiNS criteria is a measure of activity that  can be 
attributed  to selumetinib. It was however not considered sufficient to  conclude on patient  benefit 
per se. However, it  is acknowledged that the  size of the tumour has direct implications on the 
symptoms and manifestations of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)  plexiform neurofibromas (PN) and 
a reduction in tumour size is therefore a critical outcome of the  treatment. The responses have to 
be considered in the context of improved clinical outcomes that  would vary depending on patients 
given the heterogeneity of the disease manifestations. In general, a good correlation is expected 
between response and duration of response, and improvement in clinical outcomes. Indeed, an 
association was observed between REiNS response and investigator-assessed clinical benefit.  
2.  What,  if any, clinical outcomes support clinical efficacy? 
It was agreed that  the following clinical outcomes (not  an exhaustive list) are of relevance in this 
condition: QoL, pain intensity,  vision scale, motor scales, disfigurement. An effect on these clinical 
outcomes combined with  a reduction of the tumour  size would support efficacy of selumetinib. 
Although clinical outcomes improvements at a trial level were not  observed for these endpoints, 
individual benefits were observed in a number of patients (pain intensity,  motor function) and 
confirmed by investigators’ assessments. 
3.  Can  the efficacy of selumetinib for the intended  use be considered established based on 
the results from the pivotal study? 
The efficacy of selumetinib in  patients with  NF1  PN is considered established for the duration of 
follow-up (about 2  years median) as investigated in the  pivotal trial.  This is based on the 
expectation that response and the long duration of response observed will be associated in many 
patients with  improvement in clinical outcomes. This assumption is considered well-justified on the 
basis of the expected effects of durable reductions in tumour volume and the  individual patient 
benefits observed in the trial. Lack of an overall trial-level effect on the pre-specified clinical 
outcomes has to be considered in the context of improved clinical outcomes that would vary 
depending on patients given the heterogeneity of the disease manifestations. In conclusion, based 
on plausible assumptions and a number of reported individual benefits (pain intensity,  motor 
function)  as confirmed by investigators’ assessments, efficacy is considered established. 
There are however several uncertainties related to  the uncontrolled nature of the  study design and 
the fact that  the impact of selumetinib on the natural course of the disease and long terms safety 
cannot be assessed. Both long term efficacy and safety will  have to be carefully monitored in  the 
post-marketing phase to address these uncertainties. 
The AHEG also expressed concerns regarding the lack of guidance on treatment duration given the 
uncertainties on the benefit and harms of long-term treatment. Furthermore, lack of a suitable oral 
formulation will restrict use in some patients.   
The lack of information regarding potential mechanisms of primary and secondary resistance were 
highlighted.   
The AHEG also strongly recommended that prescription of selumetinib  is restricted to physicians 
who are knowledgeable about plexiform neurofibromas.

Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA 
In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of selumetinib in the treatment of symptomatic, inoperable 
plexiform neurofibromas (PN) in paediatric patients with  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)  aged 3  years 
and above, beyond the duration of the follow-up  (about 2 years), the applicant will  submit: 
- Efficacy and safety data from the pivotal SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1 with  longer follow-up.  At the 
original DCO (29-Jun-2018)  the median duration  of selumetinib treatment  in SPRINT Phase II Stratum 
1 was 2.2 years (range 0.1  to 2.9 years). A second (unplanned) DCO on 31-Mar-2021  will provide 2 
years and 9 months of further data. This would more than double the median follow-up. 
- Supportive efficacy and safety data from SPRINT Phase I with  longer follow-up. At  the original DCO 
(29-Jun-2018)  the median duration  of selumetinib treatment  in SPRINT Phase I was 4.4 years (range 
0.4 to  5.9 years). A second DCO on 27-Feb-2021  will  provide 2 years 8 months of further data. This 
would thus  extend the total  follow-up to 6-7  years. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In the single-arm pivotal study SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1, 66% of the patient  were responders by NCI 
POB central analysis and the  median best  percentage change from baseline in  target PN  volume was -
27.85%.  ORR appeared independent from PN  status at enrolment and the responses appeared durable.  
It is agreed that a response as measured by the REINS response definition (Dombi et al. 2013) represents 
patient benefit per se. The natural course of PNs is growth or at best stable over time, and any objective 
response observed in the pivotal study can in principle be attributed  to selumetinib treatment.  
The efficacy data package is limited,  as  the pivotal  efficacy data  are from a single  Phase II study  with 
only 50 patients. 
The  comparison  to  the  external  controls,  i.e.  the  tipifarnib  study  and  the  NH  study,  is  merely  of  a 
descriptive nature and hampered by differences between the pivotal study and these studies, regarding 
e.g. eligibility criteria and baseline demographic and disease characteristics. 
ICR analyses of the imaging data from the pivotal study were performed showing ORRs of 40-44%. While 
the exact effect size of selumetinib treatment on PN volume/growth rate remains unknown, it is however 
assumed that  a  ‘true’  ORR (effect size) could  be expected in  the  range of  40.0-66.0%,  albeit with  CIs 
extending from 26.4%  to  78.8%.  Supportive data from another 24  patients in  SPRINT Phase I  showed 
similar efficacy.  
It is recognised that  in the opinion of either the investigator, the patient, or the patient’s  parents, 
improvement in clinical outcomes (e.g. QoL, pain intensity, vision scale, motor scales, and 
disfigurement) were established. Thus when considering ORR in the context of improved clinical 
outcomes at the patient level, efficacy of selumetinib in patients  with  NF1  PN can be considered 
established, at least for the duration of follow-up of the pivotal trial (about 2  years). 
The CHMP considers the  following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the 
context of a conditional  MA: 
In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of selumetinib in the treatment of symptomatic, inoperable 
plexiform neurofibromas (PN) in paediatric patients with  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)  aged 3  years 
and above, the applicant will  submit an updated analysis of the study SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1 with 
a data cut-off of 31 March 2021. The clinical study report will be submitted by 31 March 2022:

2.6.  Clinical safety 
The principal  source of safety data in  paediatric patients  with  NF1  and  inoperable PN derived from the 
NCI-sponsored open-label SPRINT study. The safety data set included all patients  who received at least 
1 dose of selumetinib. 
Safety data from the following datasets were submitted: 
• 
Pivotal study  SPRINT Phase II stratum  1 (N=50,  data cut-off  29 June  2018);  patients  aged ≥3 
and  ≤18 years  (able  to  swallow  whole  capsules)  received  selumetinib  25  mg/m2  BID  as  a 
monotherapy.  
•  Supportive study SPRINT Phase I (N=24,  data cut-off  29 June 2018);  in  which patients  ≥3 and 
≤18 years  (able  to  swallow  whole  capsules),  received selumetinib  20  mg/m2  BID (n=12),  25 
mg/m2 BID (n=6),  or 30 mg/m2 BID (n=6). 
• 
Paediatric  safety  Pool  (N=74),  data  cut-off  29  June  2018.  This  population  comprised  pooled 
safety data across SPRINT Phase II Stratum  I and Phase I studies; it  did not  include data  from 
SPRINT phase II Stratum  I 90-day safety update  report. All  patients (3  years to 18  years) who 
received selumetinib at any dose in SPRINT Phase I or Phase II Stratum 1 were included. Safety 
data from a sub-group of paediatric patients (n=56)  who received 25 mg/m2 on either study as 
per initial  dose assignment was presented separately. 
• 
Longer-term follow up safety data was provided in the SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1 90-day safety 
update (29 March 2019) report. At the time of the day 90 safety update report (29 March 2019), 
44 (88.0%)  patients remained within  the study. 
To  support  children and  their  family,  some study-mandated  evaluations  i.e.,  medical history,  physical 
examinations and laboratory evaluations were conducted by local health care providers (HCPs). 
In  addition,  safety data  from  7  studies  in  adult  patients  with  cancer (n=347)  including  one phase  III 
study (SUMIT)  were submitted.  Furthermore, safety data from studies  performed as part  of the clinical 
pharmacology program (e.g.  pharmacokinetic and  drug-drug  interactions  studies)  were  also analysed 
although they had been performed in 380  healthy volunteers. 
Patient exposure 
Exposure to  selumetinib for the SPRINT Paediatric pool and the  individual data sub-sets is  presented in 
Table 47.

EMA/549867/2021  
Page 128/164 
 
 
 
In the paediatric pool, the median total duration of selumetinib treatment in paediatric patients with NF1 
who have PN was 28  months (range: < 1 to  71 months),  23%  of patients were exposed to selumetinib 
treatment for > 48 months. 
At  the time  of the  day 90  safety update report (29  March  2019),  44  (88.0%)  patients  remained within 
the  study;  of  these,  30  (60.0%)  patients,  and  a  further  2  re-treatment  patients,  were  continuing  to 
receive  selumetinib.  The  median  total  duration  of  exposure  to  selumetinib  was  1027.50  days  (33.8 
months), and the median actual exposure was 943.98 days (31.0 months). The maximum actual duration 
of exposure was 1290  days (42.4 months). At the DCO date of 29 March 2019, 17 (34.0%) patients had 
>36 months  (>3 years) total treatment  duration. 
Adverse events 
As the  majority  (≥98.0%)  of the  AEs  reported in  the  SPRINT paediatric  population  were attributed  as 
related  to  selumetinib  treatment  by  the  Investigators,  treatment-related  AEs  are  not  presented 
separately. 
Overall incidence of Adverse Events 
The paediatric pool, 73/74  (98.6%) patients  had at least 1 AE (Table 48).

Long-term safety evaluation in SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1 over time 
In  SPRINT  Phase  II  Stratum  1  the  expected duration  of  the  long  term  safety  follow  up  was  7  years 
following initiation  of treatment or 5 years after study drug discontinuation,  whichever was longer.

Safety data during long term follow up 
In the SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1 90 days update safety report (90DSU DCO; 29 March 2019), the most 
frequently reported AEs were the same as those reported at the final CSR (29 June 2018).  
The  cumulative total  number  of patients  for  whom  AEs Grade ≥3  were reported at  the  DCO 29  March 
2019,  remained the same as reported in the final CSR (31 [62.0%]  patients). 
At  the  DCO  29  March  2019,  a  Grade ≥3  dermatitis  acneiform was  reported  for  1  additional  patient 
compared with  the final CSR (6.0% vs 4.0% of patients, respectively). The most commonly reported AEs 
of Grade ≥3, in the 90  days update safety report remained consistent with  those in the final CSR. 
At  the  DCO  29  March  2019,  no  new-treatment  emergent  SAEs were  reported.  However,  1  additional 
patient  had  Grade 3  SAE  of  Malignant  peripheral nerve sheath  tumours  (MPNST)  that  was  considered 
not treatment  emergent and hence not  included in the 90 days update safety report.

Retinal events 
Table 48: Adverse events of Retinal events (medical concept) reported in any category in the SPRINT 
Paediatric pool (Safety analysis set) 
AEs  of  visual  disorder  were all  Grade 1  or  Grade 2;  no  AEs  Grade ≥3  were  reported.  Two  of  the  11 
patients  with  AEs  in  the  sub-group  term  of  visual  disorder events  experienced an  event  which  led  to 
selumetinib dose interruption; none of the visual disorder events led to discontinuation.  Nine (9) patients 
recovered and for 2  patients, outcome was not  recovered or not reported. 
Other  visual  disorder  events  that  were  reported  in  the  trial  population  include:  chorioretinal  scar, 
photophobia and vitreous disorder. Each of these were reported once.  
One  patient  had  an  AE of  Grade 1  chorioretinal scar  (1.4%).  The  AE  did  not  lead  to  selumetinib  dose 
modification or discontinuation and had an outcome of not recovered or not reported. 
A  single  event  of  RPED  was  reported  in  a  paediatric patient  receiving  selumetinib  monotherapy  (25 
mg/m2  twice  daily)  for  pilocytic  astrocytoma  involving  the  optic  pathway  in  an  externally sponsored 
paediatric study 
For selumetinib  the reported retinal effect was in  general, mild  or moderate in  severity, did not  lead to 
treatment  discontinuation,  were manageable by standard supportive therapies,  and generally resolved 
during continued treatment  with selumetinib.

Cardiac events 
Table 49: Adverse events of Cardiac events (medical concept) reported in any category in the SPRINT 
Paediatric pool (Safety analysis set) 
Most AEs of ejection fraction decreased were Grade 2. In the paediatric pool, ejection fraction decreased 
events led  to  selumetinib  dose interruption  and  dose  reduction  in  1 (1.4%)  patient  each;  none of  the 
ejection fraction decreased events led to discontinuation.  Of the 17 patients with  an AE in the sub-group 
term  of  ejection  fraction  decreased events,  12  recovered and  for  5  patients  their  outcome  was  not 
recovered or not reported. 
In SPRINT, phase II stratum 1, LVEF reduction was reported in 11 (22%)  patients; all cases were grade 
2, asymptomatic and did not lead to dose interruptions, reductions or discontinuation. Of the 11 patients, 
6  patients  recovered  and  for  5  patients  the  outcome  was  not  reported.  The  median  time  to  first 
occurrence of LVEF  reduction was 226 days (median duration 78 days). The majority of LVEF reduction 
adverse reactions were reported as reductions from baseline (≥  10% reduction) but were considered to 
remain  in  the  normal  range.  Patients  with  LVEF  lower  than  the  institutional  LLN  at  baseline were  not 
included in the  pivotal study.  In addition, 2 serious cases of LVEF  reduction associated with  selumetinib 
have been reported in paediatric patients who participated in an expanded access program. 
In  the  90  days  update  safety report  (DCO  29  March  2019),  3  patients  had  recurrent AEs  of  ejection 
fraction decreased. 
Oedema events 
In the paediatric pool, AEs in the sub-group term of oedema events were reported for 13.5% (10/74) of 
the patients. AEs were all Grade 1. One had an oedema event which led to selumetinib dose interruption. 
None of the oedema events led to discontinuation.  Of the 10  patients with  an AE in the sub-group term 
of  oedema events,  6  patients  recovered and  for  4  patients  their  outcome  was  not  recovered or  not 
reported. None of the AEs of oedema were associated with  any other AE suggesting a cardiac origin. 
Other cardiac events 
One  other cardiac event  was  reported in  one  paediatric patient;  right  ventricular dysfunction.  This AE 
was grade 1. The event did not lead to selumetinib dose modification or discontinuation and was reported 
as resolved.

Skin and mucous membrane events 
Acneiform rash 
Table 50: Adverse events of acneiform rash (grouped term) reported in the SPRINT Paediatric pool 
(Safety analysis set) 
Two patients experienced an AE of acneiform rash that led to selumetinib dose interruption, no patients 
experienced AEs leading to  selumetinib dose reduction or to  permanent discontinuation  of selumetinib. 
Of the  40 patients  with  an AE in  the grouped term of acneiform rash, 15  patients  recovered and for 25 
patients their outcome was not recovered or not reported. 
In SPRINT, phase II stratum 1, acneiform rash was observed in 25 (50%) patients (median time to onset 
13 days; median duration of 60 days for the maximum CTCAE grade event). The majority of these cases 
were  grade  1  or  2,  observed  in  post-pubertal  patients  (>  12  years)  and  did  not  require  any  dose 
interruptions or reductions. Grade 3 adverse reactions were reported for 4%. 
Non-acneiform rash 
Table 51: Adverse events of non-acneiform rash (grouped term) reported in any category in the SPRINT 
Paediatric pool (Safety analysis set) 
In the paediatric pool 64.9% (48/74)  of the patients  experienced an AE of non-acneiform rash, of which 
2 were  Grade  ≥3  of  severity.  Five  patients  experienced  an  AE  of  non-acneiform  rash  that  led  to 
selumetinib  dose  interruption,  in  2  patients  the  AE  led  to  selumetinib  dose reduction.  In  none  of  the 
patients the AE of non-acneiform rash led to permanent discontinuation of selumetinib. Of the 48 patients 
with  an AE  in the  grouped term of non-acneiform rash, 29 patients  recovered and for 19 patients  their 
outcome  was  not  recovered or  not  reported.  In  SPRINT,  phase  II  stratum  1,  other  (non-acneiform) 
rashes were observed in 35 (70%)  patients in the  pivotal study  and were predominantly grade 1  or 2.

Nail disorder events 
In the  paediatric pool,  64.9%  of the  patients  (34/74)  experienced an  AE of nail  disorders, of which  33 
patients (44.6%)  had paronychia. Seven patients had an AE of Grade ≥3.  Also, in 7 patients  the AE led 
to selumetinib dose interruption, 4 patients  experienced AEs leading to selumetinib dose reduction, and 
1  patient experienced an  AE which led  to permanent discontinuation  of  selumetinib. Of the  34  patients 
(45.9%) with an AE in the grouped term of nail disorder events, 24 patients recovered and for 10 patients 
their  outcome  was  not  recovered or  not  reported.  The  majority  of  the  patients  responded  to  dose 
modification and additional symptomatic/ supportive treatment. 
In SPRINT, phase II stratum 1,  paronychia was reported in 23  (46%)  patients, the  median time  to first 
onset of maximum grade paronychia adverse reaction was 306 days and the median duration of adverse 
reactions was 96 days. The majority of these adverse reactions were grade 1 or 2 and were treated with 
supportive or symptomatic therapy and/or dose modification. Grade ≥ 3  events occurred in three (6%) 
patients.  Seven patients  (3  with  a maximum grade 3 adverse reaction and  4 with  a  maximum grade 2 
adverse reaction)  had a  selumetinib  dose interruption  for  adverse reactions of  paronychia, of whom  3 
had dose interruption followed by dose reduction (2 patients  required a second dose reduction).  In one 
patient (2%)  the event led to  discontinuation. 
Oral mucositis 
In the  paediatric pool  52.7%  of the  patients  (39/74)  had an  AE of  oral mucositis. Most  of the  patients 
had stomatitis.   Five patients  experienced an  AE which  led to  selumetinib dose interruption,  2  patients 
experienced AEs  leading  to  selumetinib  dose reduction;  1  patient  had  an  AE  which  led  to  permanent 
discontinuation of selumetinib. Of the 39 patients with an oral mucositis, 31 recovered and for 8 patients 
their outcome was not recovered or not reported.  
One  patient  treated  with  30  mg/m2  selumetinib,  discontinued  treatment  after  multiple  events  of 
stomatitis, the highest being Grade 3. This patient also had multiple dose interruptions due to stomatitis, 
in addition to  an interruption  followed by dose reduction.

- Elevation of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) 
AEs  were predominantly  Grade 1  or  Grade 2  (55  [74.3%]  patients).  Five  patients  (6.8%)  had  AEs of 
Grade 3 and 3 (4.1%) patients had AEs of Grade 4. In 5 patients an AE of CPK elevation led to selumetinib 
dose reduction  and 1  patient  experienced an  AE which  led  to  discontinuation.  The majority of  the  CPK 
increase  events  did  not  require  either  dose  modification  or  symptomatic/  supportive  treatment  and 
recovered whilst on  selumetinib treatment.  For the  63 patients  with  an AE of CPK increased events, 39 
patients recovered and for 24 patients their outcome was not recovered or not reported. 
Adverse reactions of blood CPK elevation occurred in 76% of patients in SPRINT phase II stratum 1. The 
median time to  first onset of  the maximum grade CPK increase was 106  days and the median duration 
of adverse reactions was 126  days. The  majority of adverse reactions were grade 1  or 2  and  resolved 
with  no  change in  selumetinib  dose. Grade ≥  3  adverse reactions  occurred in  three  (6%)  patients.  A 
grade 4 adverse reaction led to treatment  interruption followed by dose reduction. 
- Muscle events 
AEs were predominantly Grade 1 or Grade 2 (10  [13.5%]  patients), AEs of Grade 3 were reported by 1 
(1.4%)  patient; no AEs of Grade 4 or 5 were reported. 
In  6  patients,  AEs of  CPK increased and myalgia  occurred concurrently.  In all  of  these patients,  after 
the  concurrent occurrence of  myalgia or muscle weakness with  blood CPK increased, there were other 
events  of  blood  CPK  increased reported  on  treatment  with  selumetinib.  However,  myalgia or  muscle 
weakness did not reoccur at these time moments. 
One of the 11 patients with  AEs in the  sub-group term of muscle events experienced an event which led 
to selumetinib dose interruption and 1 patient had an event which led to selumetinib discontinuation. All 
AEs in the sub-group term of muscle events in  the Paediatric pool, were reported as recovered.  
Physeal dysplasia 
In  non-clinical  rat  studies,  physeal  dysplasia has  been  reported  after  treatment  with  MEK  inhibitors, 
including  selumetinib.  In order to ascertain the risk of physeal dysplasia in the paediatric population, a

surrogate  marker of  height  was  used  to  ascertain  the  effect  on  growth  plate.  The  hypothesis  was  as 
follows:  if selumetinib  did affect  the  growth plate  in  children, it  would  also affect the  height  and  linear 
growth.  No  deviating  growth  pattern  was  seen for  children  treated  with  selumetinib  in  comparison to 
natural history patients. 
Gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity 
In the paediatric pool an incidence of gastrointestinal AEs (about 97% of the patient had at least one GI 
AE),  including  vomiting  (82%)  diarrhoea (70%)  and  nausea  (66%),  was  reported.  Grade 3  or higher 
events occurred in  27%  of the  patients  in  the  Paediatric pool,  14.4%  of the  patients  had a  Grade ≥  3 
event of diarrhoea and 8.1%  of  vomiting. Gastrointestinal  SAEs occurred in  5.4%  of the  patients.  Two 
patients (2.7%)  had a SAE of diarrhoea. 
In  SPRINT,  phase II  stratum  1,  vomiting  (41  patients,  82%,  median duration  3  days),  diarrhoea (35 
patients,  70%,  median  duration  5  days),  nausea  (33  patients,  66%,  median  duration  16  days),  and 
stomatitis  (25  patients,  50%,  median  duration  12  days)  were  the  most  commonly  reported 
gastrointestinal  (GI) reactions. The  majority of these cases were grade 1  or 2  and did  not  require any 
dose interruptions  or dose reductions. 
Grade 3  adverse reactions were reported for diarrhoea (8 patients, 16%), nausea (1 patient, 2%), and 
vomiting  (3  patients,  6%).  For  one  patient  diarrhoea  led  to  dose  reduction  and  subsequent 
discontinuation.  No  dose  reduction  or  discontinuation  was  required  for  adverse  reactions  of  nausea, 
vomiting or stomatitis. 
Hair changes 
In SPRINT, phase  II stratum  1, 32%  of  patients  experienced hair changes (reported as hair  lightening 
[PT: hair colour changes] in 11 patients  (22%) and hair thinning  [PT: alopecia]) in  12 patients (24%)); 
in  7  patients  (14%)  both  alopecia  and  hair colour  changes  were reported during  treatment.  All  cases 
were grade 1 and did not require dose interruption  or dose reduction. 
Weight increased 
Certain  events of  weight  increased were classified as  AEs in  SPRINT  Phase II study  based on  the  fact 
that  these events were managed through selumetinib dose modification by the investigator. 
Three patients  out  of 50  experienced weight  increased during  SPRINT phase II study  and another  one 
reported after the 90DSU DCO. All of the  events were Grade 3 and were considered to  be non-serious. 
All of the events resulted in selumetinib dose modification; two patients had an interruption and 1 patient 
had an interruption followed by a dose reduction. Two patients recovered and the outcome was unknown 
for the remaining patients. 
Overdose 
During clinical trials SPRINT phase II and I, 4 and 3 patients experienced selumetinib overdose. Most of 
these cases did  not  lead to  adverse events. In SPRINT phase II, one patient  experienced CTCAE Grade 
2 phlebitis  which  was attributed  by the  investigator to selumetinib  and resulted in dose interruption. In 
SPRINT Phase I CTCAE Grade 2 paronychia was considered by the investigator to  be unlikely related to 
selumetinib  and possibly related  to  family history, and  it  did  not  result  in dose modification.  A  case of 
overdose was reported in a 14-year-old female patient  who was receiving selumetinib for NF1-PN in the 
Early Access Protocol and she  experienced CTCAE Grade 1  dizziness, abdominal  pain, and  vomiting  as 
well as CTCAE Grade 2 dermatitis acneiform. The reporting physician assessed the AE of dizziness to  be 
serious. The investigator  considered the  AEs of  dizziness, abdominal pain,  and vomiting  to  be causally 
related to  the overdose, given there was  a rapid and complete recovery after dose reduction to 35 mg 
BID. However, the dermatitis acneiform persisted after dose reduction.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Eight  (16.0%)  patients  in  SPRINT Phase II Stratum  1  and  11  (14.9%)  patients  in  the  paediatric pool, 
had AEs that  led to hospitalisation.

patients in any group) in SPRINT (Safety analysis set)  
Serious Adverse events of interest 
Malignant  peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNST) 
NF1 represents a major risk factor for development of malignancy, in particular MPNST.  In SPRINT Phase 
II Stratum 1,  two AEs of MPNST were reported; one AE was reported during treatment with selumetinib 
and one AE occurred 6 months after selumetinib was discontinued. In the 90 days updated Safety report 
one addition MPNST event was reported. This patient had already stopped treatment with  selumetinib.  
Laboratory findings 
Samples  for  measurement  of  clinical  laboratory  parameters were  collected  at  screening,  at  intervals 
throughout  the  treatment  period (depending  on the  parameter pre-every 1,  2  or  4 cycles) and  during 
the  follow-up  period.  Any  abnormal  laboratory values  were  to  be  followed  until  return  to  baseline  or 
stabilisation of event. 
Changes from baseline over time in haematology variables 
In  SPRINT  Phase II  Stratum  1  and  the  paediatric  pool  most  commonly reported  grade changes  were 
reported for haemoglobin (28.6%  and  39.7%,  respectively) and neutrophils  (low)  (33.3%  and  41.7%, 
respectively).   
Grade  changes  for  haemoglobin  were  mostly  a  1-grade  shift  increase  from  baseline.  In  the  SPRINT 
Phase II stratum  1 population and  in the  paediatric pool,  4.1% (2/49)  and 2.7%  (2/73)  of the  patients 
Assessment report

experienced a  2-grade shift.    Three-grade shift  was  reported for  4.1%  (2/49)  and  2.7%  (2/73)  of  the 
patients of the SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1 study  and the  paediatric pool respectively. 
Grade changes for neutrophils (low) were reported for 10.4%  and 13.9%  of the patients  in the  SPRINT 
Phase II stratum  1  population and  in  the paediatric  pool. Two-grade shift  from baseline were reported 
for respectively 18.8% (9/48)  and 23.6%  (17/72)  of the  patients, 4.2%  (2/48)  and 4.2% (3/72)  of the 
patients of the SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1 study and the paediatric pool had 3-grade shift from baseline.

Clinical chemistry 
In the SPRINT Phase II Stratum study and paediatric pool, grade changes were most commonly seen for 
creatinine (high);  respectively 63.3%  and 56.2%  of patients experienced a 1-grade shift  increase from 
baseline, 32.7%  and 41.1%  patients experienced a 2-grade shift increase from baseline, and 2.0% and 
1.4% patient  experienced a 4-grade shift  increase from baseline.  
The next most commonly seen grade change was for creatinine kinase (high);  respectively, 59.2% and 
50.7%  of  patients  experienced a  1-grade  shift  increase from  baseline,  6.1%  and  12.3%  of  patients 
experienced a 2-grade shift increase from baseline, 4.1% and 6.8% patients experienced a 3-grade shift 
increase from baseline, and 2.0% and 2.7% patients experienced a 4-grade shift increase from baseline.

Hepatic biochemistry 
In  SPRINT  Phase II  Stratum  1  and  the  paediatric  pool,  the  majority of  patients  had  a  maximum  on-
treatment AST and ALT increase below 3 × ULN.   
None  of the  patients  for  whom elevations of  either ALT  or AST levels were reported, had  preceding or 
coincident elevations in total  bilirubin. 
Renal biochemistry  
Sixteen (32.7%)  patients  in SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1 had a high BUN on treatment, 1  of which  had a 
high BUN  value at  baseline. Twenty-four patients  had high BUN  in the Paediatric pool, 2 of which had a 
high value at baseline. 
Creatinine increased 
In SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1, 14 (28.0%) patients had an AE of blood creatinine increased; the majority 
of these were Grade 1,  with  4 (8.0%)  patients  with  a Grade 2 AE and 1  patient  (2.0%)  with  a Grade 4 
AE. 
In  the  paediatric  pool,  21  (28.4%)  patients  had  an  AE  of  blood  creatinine  increased; the  majority of 
these were Grade 1, with 7 (9.5%)  patients with  a Grade 2 AE and 1 (1.4%)  patient with  a Grade 4 AE. 
One patient experienced an AE of creatinine increased which was considered related to an SAE of acute 
kidney injury. 
Increased creatinine AEs occurred not simultaneously with  changes in other renal function  biochemistry 
tests (urea, BUN). 
Urinalysis 
There were no clinically significant changes noted. 
Other Laboratory values 
Overall comparison of data from SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1  and the  paediatric pool showed that  there 
were no  clinically  significant  changes in  calcium,  glucose,  magnesium, potassium  or  sodium  observed 
during treatment.

Safety in special populations 
Effect of age 
In the paediatric pool, AEs were reported for 44 (97.8%) patients aged 2 to 11 years of age; 24 (100%) 
of patients  aged  12  to  16 years of age and  5  (100%)  patients  aged >16  years of age.  The number of 
patients in the paediatric pool aged >16 years (n=5) was too small to provide a meaningful comparison.  
The  overall  incidence  of  AEs  in  each  category  were  broadly  similar  for  patients  aged  2  to  11  years 
compared with  patients  aged 12  to  16  years; however, the  incidence of  AEs leading  to  hospitalisation 
were higher for the younger population, i.e., AEs leading to hospitalisation were reported for 22.2%  for 
patients aged 2 to 11 years vs 4.2% for patients aged 12  to 16 years.  
AEs of Grade ≥3 were reported for 71.1%  of patients  in the  ≥2  to 11  years age group, compared with 
58.3%  patients in the 12  to 16 years age group. 
SAEs were reported for 26.7% of patients in the ≥2 to 11 years age group, 20.8% in the 12 to 16 years 
age group. 
AEs by SOC and PT were generally reported at similar incidences for all age groups in the paediatric pool.  
Patients  aged ≥ 2  to  11  years (N  =  45)  had a  higher incidence of  the following  adverse drug  reactions 
(ADRs) compared to  patients aged 12 to  18 years (N  = 29):  hypoalbuminaemia, dry skin, pyrexia, hair 
colour changes. 
Dermatitis  acneiform occurred  at  a  higher  frequency  in  the  12  to  16  years age group.  Rash  maculo-
papular was seen more commonly in patients  in the ≥2 to 11  than in the older age group. 
Table 56: SPRINT Paediatric pool: Adverse events by age (Safety analysis set) 
Effect of gender 
In  the  paediatric  pool  the  incidence of  SAEs,  AEs  leading  to  hospitalisation,  AEs  leading to  treatment 
interruption and AESIs of Grade ≥3 were all higher for male patients,  compared with  female patients.  
Effect of race 
In SPRINT Phase II Stratum  1,  AEs were reported for 42  patients  who  were White  and 5  patients  who 
were non-White,  and  in  the  paediatric  pool,  AEs were  reported for  60  patients  who  were  white  and  9 
patients who were non-White.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Dose interruptions  and  reductions  due  to  adverse events  were reported  in  78%  and  32%  of  patients, 
respectively. 
Dose interruptions  and  reductions  due  to  adverse events  were reported  in  78%  and  32%  of  patients, 
respectively. The most commonly reported ADRs leading to dose modification (dose interrupted or dose 
reduced) of selumetinib  were vomiting (26%),  paronychia (16%),  diarrhoea (15%)  and nausea (11%). 
Permanent discontinuation  due to adverse events was reported in 12% of the patients. 
Overall, 6/14  (42.9%)  AEs leading to  treatment discontinuation  were Grade 2, six (42.9%)  were Grade 
3 and two (14.3%)  were Grade 4.  
Of  the  AEs  leading  to  treatment  discontinuation,  events  of  skin  ulcer,  MPNST,  acute  kidney injury  (1 
event), blood creatinine increased (2 events in 1 patient),  and diarrhoea were reported as serious AEs. 
In  both  SPRINT  Phase  II  Stratum  1,  and  the  paediatric  pool,  none  AEs  leading  to  permanent 
discontinuation  of selumetinib  were reported by more than 1 patient.   
The majority (11/14  [78.6%])  of AEs  leading to  selumetinib discontinuation  resolved after selumetinib 
was stopped, and for 3 AEs the outcome was unknown. 
No  new treatment-emergent AEs leading to  permanent discontinuation  of selumetinib  were reported in 
the SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1 90  days updated safety report.  
For the 6 patients who discontinued treatment in SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1, the total treatment duration 
ranged between 43 and 543 days. Of the 10 AEs that led to these 6 patients discontinuing,  2 were CTCAE 
Grade 2, 6 were CTCAE Grade 3, and 2 were CTCAE 4; 7 of these 10 AEs were SAEs.

Adverse events from other studies 
▪ Early Access Program (EAP) 
In  the  ongoing  EAP,  166  patients  (108  patients  via  named patient  supply  under Study  D1346R00001 
and 58  patients  via US  intermediate access protocol for Study D1346R00002)  with  NF1  and inoperable 
PN received selumetinib at a dose of 25 mg/m2 BID (DCO 31 January 2019). 
As part of the EAP, 273 AEs occurred in 75  patients and the nature of AEs reported was consistent with 
the  safety profile of selumetinib  in SPRINT Phase II stratum  1 and  SPRINT phase I studies.  In general, 
the  type of AEs reported in  the  EAP were similar to  the AEs reported in the  clinical study.  The majority 
of AEs were non-serious, with none life-treating or fatal events. SAEs that  led to hospitalisation, included 
urinary tract  infection,  cellulitis,  cystitis,  dermatitis  acneiform, gastrointestinal  disorder,  hallucination, 
and  respiratory  tract  infection.  The  most  commonly  reported  other  SAEs  included  blood  creatine 
phosphokinase  increased  and  dermatitis  acneiform,  diarrhoea,  and  ejection  fraction  increased.  Two 
serious cases of ejection fraction decreased were reported in paediatric patients aged of 6 and 11 years-
old and for whom the event was considered related to selumetinib by the reporting physician. Selumetinib

treatment  was discontinued. During the pivotal SPRINT Phase II stratum  1 and SPRINT phase I studies 
only asymptomatic left ventricular ejection fraction reductions were reported.   
▪ Externally Sponsored Paediatric Studies (ESRs) 
In the ongoing paediatric ESRs, 291 patients  received selumetinib for a range of indications. 
During these studies, 103  cases corresponding to 178  SAEs were reported.  Out  of these 178 SAEs, 21 
events were considered life-threatening. However, the paediatric population  of these studies (low grade 
glioma,  multiply-relapsed paediatric)  differs  from  NF1  patients,  one  cannot  exclude that  these  events 
were precipitated by underlying diseases. 
The  most  commonly  reported  SAEs included  blood  creatine  phosphokinase increased, hydrocephalus, 
headache, rash maculo-papular, hyponatraemia, paronychia, pyrexia, vomiting, dehydration, abdominal 
pain, constipation,  hypoxia, muscular weakness, optic  nerve disorder, seizure, sepsis, suicidal ideation, 
and vision blurred. None of these SAEs had a fatal outcome. AEs that were considered as life threatening 
included  blood  creatine  phosphokinase  increased,  agitation,  anxiety,  optic  nerve  disorders,  sepsis, 
suicidal  ideation,  acidosis,  apnoea,  depressed  level  consciousness,  hydrocephalus,  hyperglycaemia, 
lipase  increased,  pulmonary  haemorrhage, and  pyrexia.  These  data  were  consistent  with  the  safety 
profile of selumetinib.  
Neither in EAP and ESRs studies fatal cases occurred.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The Applicant provided data from two  main datasets: SPRINT II stratum 1 and paediatric pool.  
Due to  the  small paediatric  dataset,  the  evaluation of  selumetinib  has  been completed by  safety data 
from  7  studies  in  adult  patients  with  cancer  (n=347)  including  one  phase  III  study  (SUMIT). 
Furthermore,  safety  data  from  studies  performed as  part  of  the  clinical  pharmacology  program (e.g. 
pharmacokinetic  and  drug-drug  interactions  studies)  were  also  analysed  although  they  had  been 
performed in 380 healthy volunteers.  
Additional  studies,  Early  Access  Program  studies  (EAP),  and  paediatric  externally-sponsored studies 
(ESRs) have been also supplied.   
The ages of  the  children at  the  enrolment ranged from 3  to  19  years (median 10.3  y; mean 10.5y)  in 
the  paediatric  pool.  Male  represented 58.1%  of  the  population.  White  subjects  (87%)  were  the  most 
presented patients. At  baseline, prior medication  was taken by 67.6 %  of the patients  and 59.5 % had 
prior surgery.  
The median exposure time was 26.3 months in the SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1 study, with an additional 
7.4  months duration of exposure at  the moment of the  90 Days safety update analysis. Of the  patients 
included  in  the  Paediatric  pool  analysis, almost  half  (48.6%)  were treated  for  more  than  24  months. 
Although,  the  median  treatment  duration  in  the  paediatric  studies  is  considered  quite  long,  patients 
might  be treated even longer (up to many years) in real life. Furthermore, given the limited duration of 
follow-up, potential  late effects of the treatment are not  known. 
The recommended dose for selumetinib is 25 mg/m² of body surface area (BSA), taken orally twice daily 
(BID; approximately every 12  hours).  Dosing is individualised based on  BSA (mg/m²),  and  rounded to 
Assessment report  
EMA/549867/2021

the nearest achievable 5 mg or 10 mg dose, up  to a maximum single dose of 50 mg. Selumetinib is not 
recommended in patients with  a BSA <0.55 m².    
In the event of toxicity, the  following dose modifications are recommended:

* Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
All  of  74  patients  in  the  paediatric  pool  experienced at  least  one  dose  interruption  over their  entire 
treatment  duration.  Most  of  the  interruptions  were caused  by patient’s  compliance. Overall, 82.4%  of 
patients  experienced  lack  of  compliance,  but  no  correlation  could  be  identified  between  lack  of 
compliance, the  reasons behind,  and patient’s  age. There is  no  indication  that  difficulties  with  capsule 
intake  resulted  in  more  dose  interruptions  or  decreased  compliance  for  the  youngest  age  group. 
Interruptions  were  mostly  short  and  did  not  lead  to  substantial  decrease of  total  treatment  duration. 
Moreover, there was no clear indication  of decreased efficacy in patients with  frequent interruptions. 
Some patients, in particular children < 6 years of age, may be at risk of choking on a capsule formulation 
due to  developmental, anatomical or psychological reasons. Selumetinib should not  be administered to 
patients  who are unable or unwilling  to  swallow the capsule whole. Younger patients  or those  who may 
have  difficulty  swallowing  a  capsule  should  be  assessed for  their  ability  to  swallow  a  capsule  before 
starting treatment.  There are no specific techniques required to swallow selumetinib capsules. Standard 
medicine swallowing  techniques  may help patients.  Referral to an  appropriate health  care professional 
such as a speech and language therapist should be considered if patients are unable to swallow a capsule 
to identify suitable methods that can be tailored to the particular patient  need (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 
of the SmPC). 
Assessment report  
EMA/549867/2021

The risk of choking related to the  size of the  capsule has been added in  the safety concerns of the RMP 
as an  important  potential  risk and will  be further  investigated  in  the  context  of the  non-interventional 
PASS (see SOB). The applicant is developing an age appropriate formulation and is expected to provide 
a status update in the context of the annual renewals. 
AEs  were usually mild  or  moderate in  severity and were  managed by either  dose modification  with  or 
without  additional intervention (symptomatic and/or supportive treatments)  enabling the patients to  be 
on selumetinib treatment for long periods of time.  
In  the  paediatric pool,  the  most  frequently  observed ADRs by Preferred terms  (PTs)  that  characterise 
selumetinib  safety profile were: vomiting  (82%),  rash  (80%),  blood  creatine phosphokinase increased 
(76%),  diarrhoea  (77%),  nausea  (73%),  asthenic  events  (59%),  dry  skin  (58%),  pyrexia  (57%), 
acneiform  rash  (54%),  hypoalbuminaemia  (50%),  aspartate  aminotransferase increased  (50%)  and 
paronychia (45%).  Dose interruptions  and reductions due to adverse events were reported in 78% and 
32% of patients,  respectively.  
Despite the  toxicity  profile of  selumetinib,  treatment  duration  for most  of the  patients  was  quite  long, 
indicating  that the ADRs were manageable for patients. 
In  paediatric  pool,  57/74  and  61/74  patients  experienced diarrhoea  and  vomiting,  respectively, and 
among those 11  and 6  patients  experienced CTCAE Grade ≥  3, respectively.   Other cases were mostly 
CTCAE Grade ≤2  and are described as ADRs in section 4.8  of the  SmPC.  
Although  the  reason  (pathophysiology)  is  not  completely  understood,  a  higher  incidence  of  AEs  of 
diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, and  fatigue was reported in the  first year compared to subsequent years. 
This  was  the  case  for  both  Grade  1-2  events  (majority  of  the  cases)  as  for  Grade  3  events.  Only  3 
patients discontinued  treatment due to one of these common AEs.  
AEs of nausea, vomiting,  and diarrhoea were in most cases managed either with  no  medication or with 
symptomatic  treatment,  which  included  anti-emetics  (for  nausea  and  vomiting)  and  loperamide  (for 
diarrhoea).  
If vomiting  occurs after selumetinib is  administered, an additional  dose is not  to  be taken. The  patient 
should continue with  the next scheduled dose. 
Two events of diarrhoea in 2 patients were managed with  supportive treatment  (defined as medications 
and/or IV fluids and/or blood products), which consisted of sodium chloride and potassium chloride fluids. 
A  total  of  4  patients  had  an  AE  of  weight  increased. The  compatible  time  to  onset  with  selumetinib, 
including  one  with  a  positive  dechallenge,  having  temporarily  needed  interruption  of  selumetinib 
treatment and adjusted dose for resolving, show a trend of pattern for this  AE. No signal emerged from 
non-clinical  data  as regards weight  increased. Based on  the  available data,  no firm  conclusion  can  be 
drawn  regarding  the  causal  association  of  weight  increased  to  selumetinib  and  it  is  therefore  not 
considered as an ADR. This adverse event should be monitored through routine pharmacovigilance. 
Recurrent AEs  were reported, including  patients  who  experienced more than  10  events for  one of  the 
AEs.  Most  of  these  recurrent  events  were  low-grade  and  did  not  lead  to  treatment  discontinuation. 
Although  not  measured, it  can  be  expected that  these  frequent  recurring  or  long-lasting  AEs  have a 
negative effect on quality of life of these individual patients. 
Most  AEs could be  adequately managed with  dose interruptions  (78%  of patients  had an  AE leading to 
dose interruption)  and dose reductions (32%). 
To study the impact  of treatment  holidays to  manage AEs on treatment efficacy, a longitudinal  analysis 
was  conducted  (data not  shown).  Effect  of prolonged  dose interruption  (cumulative  interruptions  [can 
be consecutive or not  consecutive] of >  28 days between 2 assessments) and/or dose reductions on PN 
Assessment report

Page 149/164 
 
 
 
tumour volume change, was analysed. Based on this limited dataset it appears that dose interruption for 
prolonged periods may have greater impact on efficacy than dose reduction. Therefore, the use of formal 
treatment holidays is not recommended. 
Adverse  reactions  of  blurred  vision  have  been  reported  in  paediatric  patients  receiving  selumetinib. 
Isolated cases of RPED, CSR and RVO in adult patients with multiple  tumour types, receiving treatment 
with  selumetinib  monotherapy  and  in  combination  with  other  anti-cancer  agents,  and  in  a  single 
paediatric patient with  pilocytic astrocytoma on selumetinib monotherapy, have been observed. Patients 
should be advised to report any new visual disturbances. In line with clinical practice an ophthalmological 
evaluation  prior  to  treatment  initiation  and  at  any  time  a  patient  reports  new  visual  disturbances  is 
recommended.  In  patients  diagnosed  with  RPED  or  CSR  without  reduced  visual  acuity,  ophthalmic 
assessment should be conducted every 3 weeks until  resolution. If RPED or CSR is diagnosed and visual 
acuity  is affected,  selumetinib  therapy should  be interrupted  and  the  dose reduced when  treatment  is 
resumed.  If  RVO  is  diagnosed,  treatment  with  selumetinib  should  be  permanently  discontinued  (see 
sections 4.2, 4.4  and 4.8  of the  SmPC). 
The risks of RVO, CSR and RPED are considered as potential important  risks in the  RMP (see section on 
Risk Management Plan). 
One grade 1 case of cataract related to selumetinib was reported in SPRINT phase II stratum 1 and two 
cases of  eye disorders were recorded as part  of  the  Early Access Program. No  firm  conclusion  can  be 
drawn  regarding the  causal association  to  selumetinib.  Cataract and  eye disorders should  however be 
monitored through routine pharmacovigilance. 
Asymptomatic  decreases in  ejection  fraction  have been  reported  in  22%  of  paediatric  patients  in  the 
pivotal  clinical  study.  Median  time  to  initial  onset  of  these  adverse reactions  was  226  days.  A  small 
number of serious reports of LVEF reduction associated with selumetinib have been reported in paediatric 
patients who participated in  an expanded access program. 
Paediatric  patients  with  a  history  of  impaired  left  ventricular  function  or  a  baseline  LVEF  below 
institutional  lower  level  of  normal  (LLN)  have  not  been  studied.  LVEF  should  be  evaluated  by 
echocardiogram before initiation  of treatment  to  establish baseline values. Prior to starting  selumetinib 
treatment,  patients  should  have  an  ejection  fraction  above  the  institutional  LLN.  LVEF  should  be 
evaluated  at  approximately  3  month  intervals,  or  more  frequently  as  clinically  indicated,  during 
treatment. Reduction in LVEF can be managed using treatment interruption, dose reduction or treatment 
discontinuation.   In cases of asymptomatic LVEF reduction of ≥ 10 percentage points  from baseline and 
below the institutional  LLN,  selumetinib treatment should be interrupted until resolution. Once resolved, 
selumetinib should be reduced by one dose level when resuming therapy. 
In  patients  who  develop  symptomatic  LVEF  reduction  or  a  grade  3  or  4  LVEF  reduction,  selumetinib 
should be discontinued and a prompt cardiology referral should be carried out (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 
4.8 of the SmPC). 
The risk of LVEF reduction is included in the RMP as an important identified risk (See RMP). 
Cases of oedema have been reported and this AE should be monitored through routine pharmacovigilance 
to  further  understand  if  the  emerging  body  of  data  could  provide  insights  to  better  characterise the 
pathophysiology of this AE in paediatric patients with  NF1. 
Further  to  the  bone  effects identified  in  rats, the  Applicant  carried out  a  comparison of  the  growth  of 
patients enrolled in the paediatric pool in comparison with patients in the Natural History cohort (external 
control) based on the WHO  growth  charts (developed for children at  birth to  five years of age). Results 
(data not shown) indicate homogeneous distribution  of the growth between paediatric population of NF1 
from SPRINT  Phase I and  II studies  with  those from  the  Natural  History  cohort.  However, considering 
Assessment report  
EMA/549867/2021  
Page 150/164 
 
 
 
that  these  data are based on  a prediction,  the  conclusion of  which  should  be interpreted  with  caution, 
and considering the limited number of patients included in the clinical trials, the risk of physeal dysplasia 
cannot  be  ruled  out  and  constitutes  a  potential  concern  in  this  patient  population.  Therefore, physeal 
dysplasia has been  added as an  important  potential  risk in  the  RMP  and  this  risk will  be monitored  as 
part of the planned non-interventional PASS (see section “Risk management Plan”). 
Skin rash (including  maculopapular rash and  acneiform rash),  paronychia and  hair changes have been 
reported very  commonly in  the  pivotal  clinical  study.  Pustular  rash, hair  colour  changes  and  dry  skin 
were  seen more  frequently  in  younger  children  (age  3-11  years) and  acneiform rash  was  seen  more 
frequently in post-pubertal children (age 12-16  years) (see sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC). 
The data provided from the EAP and ESR were of low quality. It is therefore not possible to compare the 
safety data from the  EAP and  ESR with  the  safety results of the  clinical study although  it is agreed that 
no specific trend or pattern is seen from these studies that would  suggest a safety signal. 
In this population,  serious adverse events were reported in 17/74  patients.  The following serious 
adverse reactions were reported: diarrhoea (3%), anaemia (3%) pyrexia (3%),  blood CPK increased 
(3%),  blood creatinine increased (1%). Eleven (11) out of 17 patients  were hospitalized. Most  of them 
recovered. For 4 patients,  the SAE led to permanent discontinuation  of selumetinib and for another one 
who experienced a humerus fracture the outcome was unknown at the 90  DSU DCO. No  death 
occurred in paediatric patients. 
Patients should be advised not to take any supplemental vitamin E. Koselugo 10 mg capsules contain 32 
mg vitamin E as the excipient, D-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS). Koselugo 
25  mg  capsules contain  36  mg  vitamin  E  as  TPGS. High  doses  of  vitamin  E  may increase the  risk of 
bleeding in  patients  taking concomitant  anticoagulant  or antiplatelet  medicinal products (e.g.,  warfarin 
or  aspirin).  Anticoagulant  assessments, including  international  normalized  ratio  or  prothrombin  time, 
should  be  conducted  more  frequently  to  detect  when  dose  adjustments  of  the  anticoagulant  or 
antiplatelet  medicinal products are warranted (see sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC). 
Liver  laboratory abnormalities,  specifically  AST and  ALT  elevations,  can  occur  with  selumetinib.  Liver 
laboratory values should be monitored before initiation  of selumetinib and at least monthly during the 6 
first months of treatment, and thereafter as clinically indicated. Liver laboratory abnormalities should be 
managed with  dose interruption,  reduction or  treatment discontinuation  (see sections  4.2,  4.4 and  4.8 
of the SmPC). 
The risk of hepatotoxicity is included in the RMP as a potential  important risk.  
Haematuria and proteinuria occurred in more than 20% of patients. However no causal relationship could 
be identified. These adverse events will be monitored through routine pharmacovigilance.  
No  causal  relationship  with  selumetinib  could  be  established  for  the  reported  events  of  calcaemia, 
glycaemia,  kalaemia,  magnesaemia,  natraemia  and  amylase  increased.  However,  the  monitoring  of 
these AEs should be pursued through routine pharmacogivilance.  
Age, gender or race did not  raise particular safety issues. 
There  are  no  data  on  the  use  of  selumetinib  in  pregnant  women.  Studies  in  animals  have  shown 
reproductive  toxicity  including  embryofoetal  death,  structural  defects  and  reduced  foetal  weights. 
Koselugo  is  not  recommended  during  pregnancy  and  in  women  of  childbearing  potential  not  using 
contraception. 
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving Koselugo. 
It is recommended that a pregnancy test  should be performed on women of childbearing potential  prior 
Assessment report  
EMA/549867/2021

to  initiating  treatment.  Both  male and female patients  (of reproductive potential)  should be advised to 
use effective contraception during  and for at least 1 week after completion of treatment  with Koselugo. 
If  a  female  patient  or a  female partner  of  a  male  patient  receiving Koselugo  becomes pregnant,  she 
should be apprised of the potential risk to the foetus.  
It is not  known whether selumetinib, or its metabolites, are excreted in human milk. Selumetinib and its 
active  metabolite  are  excreted in  the  milk  of  lactating  mice.  A  risk  to  the  breast-fed child  cannot  be 
excluded, therefore breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment  with Koselugo.  
There are no  data  on the  effect  of Koselugo on  human  fertility.  Selumetinib  had  no impact  on  fertility 
and  mating  performance  in  male  and  female  mice,  although  a  reduction  in  embryonic  survival  was 
observed in female mice (see sections 4.4,  4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC). 
There is no specific treatment for overdose. If overdose occurs, patients should be closely monitored for 
signs  and  symptoms  of  adverse  reactions  and  treated  supportively  with  appropriate  monitoring  as 
necessary. Dialysis is ineffective in the treatment of overdose (see section 4.9 of the SmPC). The risk of 
overdose should be closely monitored through routine pharmacovigilance. 
No studies  on the effects on the ability to  drive and use machines have been performed. Koselugo may 
have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue, asthenia and visual disturbances 
have  been reported  during  treatment  with  selumetinib  and  patients  who  experience these  symptoms 
should observe caution when driving or using machines (see section 4.7 of the SmPC). 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Additional expert consultations 
Upon request from the CHMP,  an ad hoc expert group meeting (AHEG) was convened on 9 February 
2021.  The AHEG answers to the CHMP  questions on safety aspects are as follows: 
1.  Is the safety  profile as observed thus far acceptable  for the target  population.  
The data submitted as part of the  application indicate an overall manageable toxicity for the 
observed exposure. However, caution is warranted, especially for cardiac toxicity and long-term 
safety especially in young patients. Although  there are no specific concerns based on the available 
data, special caution and specific and sensitive monitoring should be implemented to detect any 
possible toxicity and consequences on development.  
2.  Are there concerns about long term safety.  If so, which? 
There are no specific concerns, however, in given the limited duration of follow-up, and especially 
in the vulnerable population  of younger children, special caution is recommended to monitor 
cardiotoxicity and any developmental issues (see above). 
3.  What,  if any, type  of further clinical data  would be required post-approval? 
It was agreed that  long-term efficacy and impact on NF  and safety data should be collected as 
extensively and rapidly as possible, and periodically assessed since the current follow-up is 
relatively short.  
Concerning efficacy, this  should include clinical assessment (including motor activity, pain, 
cosmetic improvement, and PROs). 
Assessment report  
EMA/549867/2021  
Page 152/164 
 
 
 
Concerning safety, the data collection should use specific and sensitive methods to detect any 
possible toxicity and consequences on development, in particular cardiac, skeletal, and neurologic 
development including  cognitive development, as appropriate in the  younger population.  
In term of study design, a randomised trial could of course address important questions although 
feasibility in this rare disease is questioned. Concerning treatment duration and schedule 
optimisation,  there was a suggestion that a randomised controlled trial with  a cross-over design 
could be conducted to  inform on potential  treatment patterns (continuous versus intermittent 
depending on progression) that could improve the outcome, including  quality of life. However, 
again, feasibility was questioned. 
A more likely feasible design would be an observational study or a registry to address both  efficacy 
and safety aspects, as well as treatment duration, treatment  interruptions and reasons, 
subsequent treatments.  
Further development to assess efficacy/safety in younger children is also recommended. 
4.  Are the currently available  pharmaceutical form (capsule and its size) and the measures 
proposed to enhance  treatment  compliance and prevent  choking acceptable  for the 
target  population (i.e. paediatric patients  aged 3 years  and above)? 
It was agreed that  the currently available pharmaceutical form is far from optimal due to especially 
its size (regardless of the age of the patient),  and that  it  may constitute  a prohibitive risk in 
patients for whom adequate choking prevention is not  feasible. 
Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA 
In order to address the uncertainties related to the limited safety data set and the long-term effects of 
selumetinib administered to a paediatric patient population,  the applicant will submit  the following data 
as specific obligations. 
- Safety data from a real-world post-authorisation safety study (PASS) is planned to include a baseline, 
retrospective, cross-sectional cohort comprising approximately 125 NF1  patients  in the EU with 
symptomatic, inoperable PN who have been prescribed at least one dose of selumetinib and who are 
aged 3  to ≤18 years at the start  of selumetinib treatment.  From this study population,  a nested 
prospective cohort of approximately 100  patients aged ≥8  years old (and prior to attainment  of Tanner 
Stage V [sexual maturity  rating]) will be followed prospectively. 
- Efficacy and safety data from the pivotal SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1 with  longer follow-up.  At the 
original DCO (29-Jun-2018)  the median duration  of selumetinib treatment  in SPRINT Phase II Stratum 
1 was 2.2 years (range 0.1  to 2.9 years). A second (unplanned) DCO on 31-Mar-2021  will provide 2 
years and 9 months of further data. This would more than double the median follow-up. 
- Supportive efficacy and safety data from SPRINT Phase I with  longer follow-up. At  the original DCO 
(29-Jun-2018)  the median duration  of selumetinib treatment  in SPRINT Phase I was 4.4 years (range 
0.4 to  5.9 years). A second DCO on 27-Feb-2021  will  provide 2 years 8 months of further data. This 
would thus  extend the total  follow-up to 6-7  years. 
Assessment report  
EMA/549867/2021  
Page 153/164 
 
 
 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The assessment of selumetinib clinical safety is based on data from 74 paediatric patients enrolled in the 
two  pivotal  studies  SPRINT  phase  I  (n=24)  and  SPRINT  phase  II  (n=50),  with  NF1  PN  who  received 
selumetinib  monotherapy  (20-30  mg/m²  twice  daily).  The  median  total  duration  exposure  was  28 
months. The ages of the children at the enrolment ranged from 3 to 19 years. 
Most  of the  AEs were mild  or moderate however two-thirds  of  patients  had an AE  of grade ≥3 mainly: 
diarrhoea,  blood  creatine  phosphokinase  increased,  paronychia,  pyrexia  and  vomiting.  Furthermore, 
drug interruptions due to AEs were observed in more than  three-quarter of paediatric patients occurring 
as  early  as  grade  2.  Therefore,  selumetinib  cannot  be  considered  as  a  well-tolerated  drug  in  this 
population. The incidence of SAEs in the paediatric pool was 23%.  
A high  rate  of temporary dose interruptions  due  to  the  lack of compliance was  observed in  more than 
80% of patients and 77%  stopped due to adverse events.  
Due to  the large size of the capsule, there is a risk of choking in young patients,  notably those under 6-
years old  (see  RMP).  The  applicant  is  developing  an  age-appropriate formulation  and  is  requested  to 
provide a status update in the  context of the annual renewals.  
There are remaining uncertainties regarding the risk of physeal dysplasia which will  be addressed in the 
context of the non-interventional PASS (see SOB). 
The  overall safety  data for  selumetinib  show  adverse drug  reactions consistent  with  the  known  safety 
profile of MEK  2 inhibitors (e.g. binimetinib,  trametinib).  
The CHMP considers the  following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the 
context of a conditional  MA: 
Non-interventional post-authorisation  safety study (PASS): in order to confirm the  long-term safety of 
selumetinib in the treatment  of symptomatic, inoperable PN  in paediatric patients  with NF1  aged 3 
years and above, the applicant will conduct and submit the results of a non-interventional PASS 
comprising approximately 125 NF1  patients in the EU  who have been prescribed at least one dose of 
selumetinib and who are aged 3 to ≤18 years at the  start of selumetinib treatment. A nested cohort of 
approximately 100 patients aged ≥8 years old (and prior to attainment  of Tanner Stage V [sexual 
maturity rating])  will be followed prospectively. The clinical study report will  be submitted  by 31 
December 2027:

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC.

Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the  Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion.  The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with  the international birth  date (IBD). The IBD is 10.04.2020.  The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of selumetinib with  active substances contained in  authorised 
medicinal products in  the European Union  and declared that  it is not  a salt,  ester, ether, isomer, 
mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers selumetinib to be a new active substance as it  is not 
a constituent  of a medicinal product previously authorised within  the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with  target patient  groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that  the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in  the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU)  726/2004,  Koselugo (selumetinib)  is included in  the 
additional monitoring list  as: 
• 
It contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the  EU; 
• 
• 
It has a PASS imposed at the time of authorisation; [REG Art 9(4)(cb), DIR Art 21a(b]; 
It is approved under a conditional marketing authorisation [REG Art 14-a] 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that  this will allow quick identification  of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Koselugo as monotherapy is indicated for the  treatment of symptomatic, inoperable plexiform 
neurofibromas (PN) in paediatric patients with  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)  aged 3 years and above. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Currently there  is no  approved medical treatment  in  the  EU  to  cure, prevent, or  reduce the volume of 
PNs. The only available options to  treat and manage NF1  are pain management and surgical excision to 
Assessment report  
EMA/549867/2021  
Page 157/164 
 
 
 
remove as much  of the  PN  as  possible. However,  for many  patients  surgery is  not  a  viable option  as 
most  PN  are  not  amenable to  complete  resection  due  to  encasement  of,  or  close  proximity  to,  vital 
structures. Furthermore, complete resection is difficult to achieve, with a high risk of iatrogenic injury to 
related nerves and surrounding soft tissues and haemorrhage due to the invasiveness or high vascularity 
of  the  PN.  Following  subtotal  or partial  PN  resection, 18%  of  patients  experienced permanent  surgical 
complications, including speech abnormalities, nerve palsies, and pain, and 55% of patients experienced 
PN regrowth. Furthermore, incompletely resected PN  tend to regrow after surgery. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The  main  evidence of  efficacy submitted  is  from  a  single  phase I/II (SPRINT)  open-label,  single-arm, 
multi-centre  Phase I/II study  that  aimed to  evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of selumetinib 
in  paediatric patients  with  NF1  and  inoperable PN  (defined as  PN  that  cannot  be  surgically completely 
removed without  risk  of  substantial  complications  due  to  encasement of,  or  close  proximity  to,  vital 
structures, invasiveness or high vascularity of the PN).   
The target PN, the PN that  caused relevant clinical symptoms or complications (PN-related morbidities), 
was  evaluated  for  response  rate  using  volumetric  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI)  analysis  per 
Response Evaluation in Neurofibromatosis and Schwannomatosis (REiNS)  criteria.   
Supportive efficacy and safety data were provided from the Phase I of the SPRINT study in which patients 
received selumetinib at doses of 20, 25 and 30 mg/m2 BID (Dombi et al. 2016). 
The Applicant also provided External Control Data (reported in SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1 Clinical Study 
Report)  from  an  NCI  POB  NF1  Natural  History  study  (age-matched  cohort  for  primary  analysis  and 
contextualisation of SPRINT data) and the Placebo arm of tipifarnib  Study 01-C-0222. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In  the  study  SPRINT Phase I/II,  a  total  of  50  paediatric  patients  with  NF1  and  PN  were included.  The 
time of data cut-off for the results is 29-Jun-2018,  at which timethe DCO the median follow-up time was 
24 cycles. 
The ORR on the  target tumour volume according to the  REiNS criteria [Dombi et al. 2013],  was 66.0% 
(95%  IC  51.2,  78.8)  based  on  NCI  POB  analysis  by  a  single  reviewer.  No  patients  had  a  complete 
response, 33  (66.0%)  patients  had a confirmed PR (i.e. volume decrease ≥ 20%  confirmed within  3 to 
6  months  after  first  response),  4  patients  (8.0%)  had  an  unconfirmed  PR  and  11  (22%)  had  stable 
disease (volume change < 20%), and no patients had a progression. Two patients did not participate to 
this evaluation due to the absence of post baseline MRI scan. 
The ORR per (pre-planned) first ICR sensitivity analysis was 44.0% (95% CI: 30.0, 58.7).  Per post-hoc 
second ICR analysis the ORR was 40.0% (95% CI: 26.4, 54.8), and the resulting average ICR was 40.0% 
(95% CI: 30.0,  58.7). 
Median duration of response (DOR) was not  reached. The number (percentage) of patients  remaining in 
(confirmed) response after 12 and 24 cycles was 29 (87.9%)  and 9 (27.3%),  respectively. 
Median progression free survival (PFS) and time to progression (TTP) (no patient  died) was not reached 
(with  a median follow-up for PFS of 24.0 cycles). The median time to onset of response was 7.2 months 
(range 3.3 months to 1.6 years). The median (min-max) time to the maximal PN shrinkage from baseline 
was 14.6 months  (3.3 months to 2.7  years). 
In the SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1, the median PN volume change per year observed was -10.2% (range 
-27.3% to 19.0%). The median best percentage change from baseline in target PN volume was -27.85%.

The  influence  of  pain  on  daily  functioning  showed  a  trend  over improvement  in  the  score  which  was 
mainly supported by the scores reported by the  parents. The correlation between shrinking tumour and 
PII was weak. Effect on tumour reported pain and global pain was also assessed by the GIC, individually 
some improvement was observed. 
The effect on mobility was assessed using  self-PROMIS, a reported and parent reported PROMIS score. 
A positive trend was reported as rated by parents but not for self-evaluation. For mobility, the correlation 
between the  change in  PROMIS and  change in target  PN  volume was weak for self-reported score and 
moderate  for  parent  reported  score. On  the  contrary,  the  correlation was  moderate for  self-reported 
score and weak for parent reported score regarding upper extremity score. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The sample size of  the  pivotal study  SPRINT Phase II stratum  1  is  limited (n=50)  and there  is a  great 
heterogeneity of the population in  terms of location of the target PN and comorbidities.  
The pivotal  study had  a single-arm design  and thus  lacking an  internal  control. The comparison to  the 
external controls provided to  contextualise the  data  was merely of a descriptive nature  and hampered 
by differences between the design of the studies, regarding e.g. eligibility criteria, baseline demographic 
and disease characteristics, and timing  of  imaging. Furthermore, there is a  potential subjectivity in  the 
assessment of the  imaging  data in  the  external control studies  as data  have not  been assessed by ≥2 
independent  readers who  were blinded  for  patient  exposition  and  time  point,  also  avoiding sequential 
presentation of  images from the same patient  (via random presentation),  as was recommended in  the 
protocol assistance (PA). The results are however accepted. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The most common adverse reactions of any grade (incidence ≥  45%) were vomiting (82%), rash (80%), 
blood creatine phosphokinase increased (76%), diarrhoea (77%), nausea (73%), asthenic events (59%), 
dry  skin  (58%),  pyrexia  (57%),  acneiform  rash  (54%),  hypoalbuminaemia  (50%),  aspartate 
aminotransferase increased (50%) and paronychia (45%).  
The  most  commonly  reported  ADRs  of  CTCAE  Grade  ≥3,  by  PTs  were:  diarrhoea  (15%),  blood  CPK 
increase (9%), paronychia (9%),  vomiting (8%), pyrexia (8%)  and rash (5%).  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety data on selumetinib in the treatment  of NF1  is limited  to 74 paediatric patients.  
There is a risk of choking in young patients because of the large capsule. An age-appropriate formulation 
is currently  under development and the  applicant will  provide a status  update  in  the context  of annual 
renewals (see RMP) 
the  effect of  long  term  exposure and  the  long  term  toxicity  on  the  development  of  children  (physeal 
dysplasia) is  unknown.  These issues will  be  further  investigated in  the  context  of  a non-interventional 
PASS study (see SOB).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
There is currently no approved medical therapy for the treatment of symptomatic, inoperable PNs in the 
EU, and there is thus an unmet medical need. 
The  highest  reported  effect  was  the  66%  objective  response  rate  (33  patients)  in  the  pivotal  study 
SPRINT phase II study, when assessed by NCI POB Central analysis (versus 44%  when reanalysed by a 
first Independent Central Review, 40%  by a second ICR, and 44% for the average ICR). All 33 patients 
had a confirmed partial response (defined as volume decrease ≥20%) as best response and none of the 
50 enrolled patients experienced progression. 
Considering  that  the  natural  course  of  PNs  is  growth  or  at  best  stay  stable  over  time,  the  observed 
decrease of  tumour  volume  and  the  absence  of  progression in  the  pivotal  study  can  in  principle  be 
attributed  to selumetinib. 
Regarding clinical  outcomes,  some improvements were  observed, however the  open-label trial  design 
limits  interpretability  of  those  endpoints  as patient’s  and  parent’s  knowledge of treatment  assignment 
may lead to an overestimation of treatment effect. 
While  the  data  have  not  shown  a  statistical  correlation  between  the  ORR  and  the  clinical  outcomes 
assessments, the  AHEG  considered that  efficacy was shown  for  the  duration  of the  pivotal trial  (i.e.  2 
Assessment report  
EMA/549867/2021  
Page 160/164 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
years) as it is plausible that decrease of PN volume is associated with  a decrease in symptoms/morbidity. 
Efficacy is therefore considered established. 
The  toxicity  profile  of  Koselugo  treatment  is  not  considered  mild,  incidence  of  the  grade  3  AEs  are 
considerable, and  recurring  events  are  reported that  might  impact  patients’  quality  of  life.  However, 
most toxicity seemed to be manageable (with treatment interruptions, dose reduction or supportive care) 
in  this  particular  paediatric population,  and  long-term  treatment  is  tolerated by  most  of  the  patients. 
Taking into account the burden of the disease, the safety profile is acceptable. However, to address the 
uncertainties on long-term safety, the  applicant will conduct a PASS.  
The  proposed formulation  is  a  hard  capsule which  is  not  considered appropriate  for younger  patients 
because of its  size; this is considered to  represent a risk as some patients  will have difficulties with  the 
intake of the capsules. Treating physicians should propose standard swallowing techniques. For patients 
who have difficulties swallowing the capsule, referral to an appropriate health care professional such as 
a speech and language therapist could be considered to identify suitable methods that  can be tailored to 
the  particular patient.  For  children who  are not able or  who opposes to  taking the  capsules, treatment 
should not be persevered or started. 
An age appropriate formulation is currently being developed by the MAH and is a binding measure in the 
paediatric investigation  plan.  The MAH  should  report on  the  progress of  the  development of  this  age-
appropriate formulation in the context of the annual renewals. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The observed responses and the absence of progression (as best response) can in principle be attributed 
to  selumetinib.  The  exact  effect  size  of  selumetinib  treatment  on  PN  volume/growth  rate  remains 
unknown, although an ORR in the range of 40.0-66.0%  may be assumed albeit with  CIs extending from 
26.4%  to 78.8%. 
It  is  plausible  that  a  decrease in  PN  volume  is  associated with  a  decrease in  symptoms,  but  a  clear 
correlation has  not  been shown  between  PN  shrinkage and  the  clinical  outcome  assessments used  as 
measures for patient  benefit at the  population level. Despite the limitations  of the pivotal study, clinical 
benefit was reported at the patient level by either the Investigator, the patient, or the patient’s parents. 
Three-quarters of  doses  interruptions  were  related  to  AEs,  i.e.  58/74  patients  (77%),  approximately 
two-thirds  of  patients had  an AE of grade ≥3  and serious adverse events were experienced by 23% of 
patients.  Furthermore a potential  risk of physeal dysplasia cannot be excluded. However, most toxicity 
seemed  to  be  manageable  (with  treatment  interruptions,  dose  reduction  or  supportive  care)  in  this 
particular paediatric population. Taking into  account the  burden of the disease and  the benefit to  some 
patients, the  safety profile is acceptable. However, to address the uncertainties on the long-term safety 
and  the  potential  effect  on  the  development of  children,  the  applicant  will  conduct  and  submit  a  non-
interventional PASS. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available, a conditional marketing authorisation was 
proposed by the CHMP during the  assessment, after having consulted the applicant who requested 
consideration for its application for a conditional marketing authorisation in  accordance with Article 14-
a of Regulation (EC)  No 726/2004. 
The product falls within  the  scope of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004  concerning 
Assessment report  
EMA/549867/2021  
Page 161/164 
 
 
 
conditional marketing authorisations, as it  aims at  the treatment of a seriously debilitating disease. In 
addition, the  product is designated as an orphan medicinal product. 
PNs typically grow along large nerves and plexuses and are present at birth. PN manifestations vary 
and may continue to  become apparent through  late adolescence and early adulthood. Typical PNs are 
clinically distinct from localised (or ‘nodular’ or ‘atypical’) neurofibromas in that  they can have complex 
shapes and sometimes reach very large size, with  some documented as being 20% of body weight. 
PNs may develop along nerves anywhere in the body, and may be located around the orbit, face, 
upper and lower limbs, back, thorax, abdomen, neck brachial plexus and/or lumbosacral plexus, which 
result in clinical symptoms such as disfigurement, motor dysfunction (weakness and restricted range of 
motion), pain, and neurological dysfunction.  They have potential  for malignant transformation and are 
considered by some to be pre-malignant. 
Furthermore, the CHMP considers that the product  fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
authorisation: 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive. When considering ORR in the context of improved clinical 
outcomes at the patient level, efficacy of selumetinib in patients  with  NF1  PN can be considered 
established, at least for the duration of follow-up of the pivotal trial (about 2  years). 
Furthermore, considering the burden of the disease, the safety profile is acceptable. 
• 
It is likely that  the applicant will  be able to provide comprehensive data. The following specific 
obligations (SOBs) are agreed: 
- Efficacy and safety data from the pivotal SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1 with  a longer follow-up. At 
the original DCO (29-Jun-2018)  the median duration of selumetinib treatment in SPRINT Phase II 
Stratum 1 was 2.2 years (range 0.1 to 2.9 years). A second (unplanned)  DCO on 31-Mar-2021 
that  will provide 2 years and 9 months of further data. This would more than  double the  median 
follow-up. 
-  Supportive efficacy and safety data from SPRINT Phase I with  a longer follow-up. At the original 
DCO (29-Jun-2018)  the median duration of selumetinib treatment in SPRINT Phase I was 4.4 
years (range 0.4  to 5.9 years). A second DCO on 27-Feb-2021  that will  provide 2 years 8 months 
of further data. This would thus extend the total  follow-up to 6-7 years. 
-  Safety data from a non-interventional post-authorisation  safety study (PASS). The PASS patient 
population is planned to include a baseline, retrospective, cross-sectional cohort comprising 
approximately 125 NF1  patients in  the EU with  symptomatic, inoperable PN who have been 
prescribed at least one dose of selumetinib  and who are aged 3 to ≤18  years at the start of 
selumetinib treatment. From this  study population, a nested prospective cohort of approximately 
100 patients  aged ≥8  years old (and prior to attainment  of Tanner Stage V [sexual maturity 
rating]) will  be followed prospectively. 
• 
• 
Unmet medical needs will  be addressed, as there is currently no approved medical therapy for the 
treatment of symptomatic, inoperable PNs in the EU. 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the  risks inherent in the fact 
that  additional data are still required. Since no treatment is available to treat patients with  NF1 
PN, the benefits to public  health of the immediate availability of Koselugo is considered to 
outweigh the  risks. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Koselugo in the treatment  of symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas (PN) 
Assessment report  
EMA/549867/2021

in paediatric patients with  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)  aged 3 years and above is positive subject 
to the specific obligations and conditions imposed as part of the conditional marketing authorisation 
granted. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP  review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that  the benefit-risk balance of Koselugo is favourable in the following  indication: 
Koselugo as monotherapy is indicated for the  treatment of symptomatic, inoperable plexiform 
neurofibromas (PN) in paediatric patients with  neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)  aged 3 years and above  
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the conditional  marketing authorisation subject to the 
following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP  review of the  available data, the CHMP considers that  selumetinib is a new active 
substance as it  is not a constituent  of a medicinal product previously authorised within  the European 
Union. 
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the  available paediatric data of studies  subject to  the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0279/2019  and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

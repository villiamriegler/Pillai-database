Extension of indication to include chronic weight management, including weight loss and weight 
maintenance, for MOUNJARO, as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity in 
adults with an initial body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 30 kg/m2 (obesity), or ≥ 27 kg/m2 to < 30 kg/m2 
(overweight) in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbid condition, based on a global, 
pivotal phase 3 study I8F-MC-GPHK (SURMOUNT-1) and five supportive phase 3 studies (SURPASS-1 
to -5) in participants with T2DM and BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2. SURMOUNT-1 is a phase 3, randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide once weekly in 
participants without type 2 diabetes who have obesity or are overweight with weight related 
comorbidities. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Package 
Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 2.1 of the RMP has also been submitted. In addition, the MAH 
took the opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes to the PI. 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included (an) EMA Decision(s) 
P/0033/2023 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0033/2023 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication. 
MAH request for additional market protection 
The MAH requested consideration of its application in accordance with Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) 
726/2004 - one year of market protection for a new indication.

Obesity is defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that impairs health (WHO 2021). It is a 
chronic progressive disease caused by disruptions in the normal mechanisms that control energy 
balance.  
Assessment report  
EMA/539700/2023  
Page 8/167 
 
 
 
 
In 2016, the World Health Organization reported that more than 1.9 billion adults aged 18 years and 
older (39% of adult population) were living with obesity or overweight based on BMI criteria. Of these, 
over 650 million adults had obesity (WHO 2021).  
Obesity is a risk factor for long-term health consequences, many of which represent the top causes of 
mortality globally (WHO 2020). More than 200 health complications have been associated with obesity, 
including cardiometabolic, inflammatory, degenerative, mechano-physical, neoplastic, and 
psychological conditions (Wilding and Jacob 2021). Obesity significantly impacts patients’ daily 
activities and quality of life (Poon et al. 2022). Obesity is also associated with depression, anxiety, and 
increased suicidality (Luppino et al. 2010; Dutton et al. 2013; Wagner et al. 2013). Recently, studies 
indicated that individuals with obesity were more likely to be hospitalized, require mechanical 
ventilation, and die from COVID-19 than those without obesity (Foo et al. 2021; Gao et al. 2021; 
Smati et al. 2021).  
In 2015, excess body weight accounted for approximately 4 million deaths and 120 million disability-
adjusted life years worldwide (GBD 2015 Obesity Collaborators 2017). Secondary to the emergence of 
multisystem comorbid disease, obesity shortens life expectancy, with Class 3 obesity decreasing life 
expectancy by up to 20 years (OECD 2019; Müller et al. 2022). 
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
Tirzepatide is approved as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults with 
T2DM. The present application is for the use of tirzepatide for chronic weight management (CWM). The 
following indication is proposed to be added to section 4.1 of the SmPC: 
“Weight management 
Mounjaro is indicated as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for weight 
management, including weight loss and weight maintenance, in adults with an initial Body Mass Index 
(BMI) of 
• 
• 
≥ 30 kg/m2 (obesity) or 
≥ 27 kg/m2 to <30 kg/m2 (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight related comorbid 
condition (e.g., hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obstructive sleep apnoea, cardiovascular disease, 
prediabetes, or type 2 diabetes mellitus).” 
Management 
Patients with obesity or overweight often do not achieve sustainable weight loss with lifestyle therapies 
alone. Lifestyle-based treatment achieves a 10% weight reduction at 1 year in only some individuals 
(Wing and Hill 2001), and among those that do maintain at 1 year, most regain the weight over longer 
periods of time (Knowler et al. 2009). In addition, weight reduction beyond that achieved with lifestyle 
alone is often needed for the resolution of obesity-related comorbidities and reduction of CV mortality 
(Wing et al. 2011). Bariatric surgery is an effective option for substantial and durable weight reduction 
in select people with obesity. However, the risk of perioperative and postoperative complications, 
limited access, and apprehension regarding the invasive and permanent nature of the procedure, 
results in less than 1% of the eligible population (based on BMI) receiving bariatric surgery as a 
treatment for obesity (ASMBS 2021). Some anti-obesity drugs are available, with the recently 
approved GLP-1 receptor agonists being the most efficacious. Tirzepatide addresses an unmet medical 
need as the effect size of weight reduction exceeds the one achieved with GLP-1 receptor agonists.

2.1.2.  About the product  
Tirzepatide consists of 39 amino acids, and is engineered from the native glucose-dependent 
insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) sequence, modified to bind to both GIP and glucagon-like peptide-1 
(GLP-1) receptors. The structure of tirzepatide includes a C20 fatty diacid moiety and its molecular 
weight is 4.8 kDa. Tirzepatide has a mean half-life of approximately 5 days, which enables once-
weekly dosing. 
Mode of action of tirzepatide: in preclinical studies, tirzepatide showed equal affinity for the GIP 
receptors compared with native GIP but bound with the GLP-1 receptors with approximately 5-fold 
weaker affinity than native GLP-1. Based on the known physiology and pharmacology of GIP and GLP-1 
as well as the results from preclinical studies, the dual signaling triggered by tirzepatide is expected to 
result in a greater body weight reduction and improved control of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, 
beyond that observed with selective GLP-1 receptor agonists alone. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice  
The following studies provide primary evidence for this application: 
-SURMOUNT-1 study in participants with overweight or obesity, and without diabetes mellitus, and –
subgroup analyses of the SURPASS-1, -2, -3, -4, and -5 studies in participants with overweight or 
obesity, and with T2DM. SURPASS subgroup analyses supporting this application are in participants 
with body mass index of 27 kg/m2 or higher. 
Additionally, supportive data from the 36-week open-label tirzepatide lead-in treatment period of the 
SURMOUNT
4 study are summarized. SURMOUNT
4 is an ongoing global Phase 3 study in participants 
with overweight or obesity but without T2DM.

No specific SA had been requested for the CWM indication. The development for CWM was generally 
well in line with the recommendations in Guideline EMA/CHMP/ 311805/2014.  
Paediatric development 
With the “Opinion of the Paediatric Committee on the agreement of a Paediatric Investigation Plan and 
a deferral and a waiver EMA/PDCO/781854/2022, 16th Dec 2022“ the PDCO granted a waiver for 
children from birth to less than 6 years. A PIP for CWM in children from 6 years to 18 years was agreed 
upon. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP  
GCP compliance had been confirmed by the Applicant. During assessment no issue of GCP non-
compliance arose. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects  
2.2.1.  Toxicology  
The applicant did not perform new toxicology studies in support of this extension of indication but re-
calculated the exposure margins for the existing studies (i.e. the studies performed in support of the 
diabetes indication), which is acceptable. In the newly submitted clinical study in non-diabetic obese

subjects (Study SURMOUNT-1) the exposure was slightly higher than in the diabetes programme 
(SURPASS studies). In the SURPASS programme, the mean expose, expressed as AUC(0-τ), τ=168h, 
was 250000 ng•hr/mL (=250 µg•hr/mL). In SURMOUNT-1, it was 266000 ng•hr/mL (=266 µg•hr/mL). 
The following figure shows the dependency of the exposure from body weight. Exposure was markedly 
lower (around 170 µg•hr/mL) in subjects with the highest body weight (around 180 kg) than in 
subjects with low body weight (around 370 µg•hr/mL at 65 kg; values for the 15 mg dose).

Abbreviations: AUC(0-168) = area under the concentration versus time curve from time 0 to 168 hr after dose at 
steady state; QW = once weekly; TZP = tirzepatide. 
Note: Symbols denote individual values. The dashed lines are the loess smoothing fit for each treatment arm. The 
top and bottom margins of the boxplot represent the 75th and 25th percentiles and the whiskers extend to ±1.5 
times interquartile range, respectively. The boxplots summarize data ≤90kg, between 90 and 120 kg, and >120 kg 
for each treatment arm. The x-axis positions of the boxplot are the median body weight for the aforementioned 
intervals (82, 102, and 134 kg). 
There is some inconsistency in exposure between the SURMOUNT-1 study (non-diabetic obese 
subjects) and the SURPASS programme (diabetic subjects) as shown in the table below. Within the 
SURPASS programme, exposure (given as mean steady-state concentration (Css) here) was inversely 
correlated with baseline body weight at all doses tested, i.e. higher body weight led to lower exposure 
(bold numbers in the table) as expected. In contrast, in SURMOUNT-1 exposure was higher 
(underlined numbers) than in the diabetic patients of SURPASS despite a markedly higher mean 
baseline body weight in SURMOUNT-1 (105 kg in SURMOUNT vs. 90 kg in SURPASS [T2DM subjects]).

Due to the desired action of tirzepatide, the patients markedly lost weight during the study so that the 
body weight at study start may not be relevant for the comparison of the steady-state plasma levels 
across the studies. Due to the weight loss during the studies and due to the fact that tirzepatide 
exposure decreases with increasing body weight and vice versa, it is expected that the weight loss 
during the studies leads to an increase in mean tirzepatide plasma levels. However, this was not the 
case in SURMOUNT-1 as shown in the figure below. The highest exposure was observed at Week 36 
(note that the dose was up-titrated up to Week 20, explaining increasing exposure in this period). 
Thereafter, plasma levels declined again. Dosing was terminated at Week 72.

Figure 2. Tirzepatide plasma concentrations following administration of tirzepatide 5, 10, or 15 mg 
once weekly.
Dose escalation was allowed in the studies if there were problems with tolerability. Nevertheless, the 
patient remained in the dose group to which he or she was originally assigned.  
Based on the mean exposure of AUC(0-τ) = 266000 ng•hr/mL (266 µg•hr/mL) in obese subjects 
without diabetes, i.e. the SURMOUNT-1 population, the applicant re-calculated the exposure margins 
for each dose group of each toxicology study of the diabetes programme of tirzepatide. Since the 
exposure in non-diabetic subjects was 6.4% higher than in diabetic subjects (266 vs. 250 µg•hr/mL), 
the exposure multiples decreased accordingly. The results are presented in the table below. For 
comparison, the exposure multiples originally calculated for the diabetes programme are also provided 
(in grey).

Study on Impurities 
Qualification Study 8485844 
The purpose of this study was to qualify impurities (D-Ser32/C-terminal, Gln19, and Gln24 
deamidation) in the test article, tirzepatide, when administered twice weekly (5 total doses) by SC 
injection to rats for at least 2 weeks. 
Male and female Crl:CD(SD) rats were assigned to three groups (10/sex/group). One group was 
administered 3 mg/kg of tirzepatide without spiked levels of impurities(referred to as Lot A), one group 
was administered 3 mg/kg of tirzepatide with spiked levels of impurities(referred to as Lot B), and one 
group was administered the vehicle control (5 mM sodium phosphate and 140 mM sodium chloride, pH 
7.0±0.2).  
Lot A had a purity (in respect to tirzepatide) of 96.3%, and Lot B of 90.2%. Thus, Lot B contained 
more impurities. 
Rats were dosed by SC injection at a volume of 1.5 mL/kg on Days 1, 5, 8, 12, and 15 of the dosing 
phase. 
The assessment of toxicity was based on mortality, clinical observations, body weights, food 
consumption, ophthalmic observations, and clinical and anatomic pathology. 
Noteworthy findings are presented below. 
Mortality 
All rats survived to their scheduled sacrifice. 
Body weight and food consumption 
Tirzepatide (LY3298176) markedly reduce food consumption and body weight gain as expected from 
its pharmacodynamic action. Reduction in food consumption and – consecutive – body weight gain was 
in general slightly more pronounced with Lot B, i.e. the lot that contained a higher amount of 
impurities, see table below.

2.2.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects  
This variation includes two independent non-clinical aspects. First, the applicant re-calculated the 
exposure multiples of the human therapeutic exposure (at the highest recommended dose) vs. the 
animal exposure in the toxicity studies performed during the diabetes development. This was done 
because mean therapeutic exposure was higher in non-diabetic subjects (SURMOUNT-1 study) than in 
diabetic subjects (SURPASS studies). Otherwise, no specific concerns arise from the resulting small 
decrease in the exposure multiples. The multiples remain rather low due to low tolerability of 
tirzepatide in the animal repeated-dose studies and consecutively low dose levels. The fact that no new 
toxicology studies were performed for the obesity programme is acceptable since no higher doses are 
intended in obese patients compared to diabetes patients. 
The second non-clinical aspect was the submission of a new 2-week repeated-dose study in rats to rule 
out unexpected toxicity of certain impurities (D-Ser32/C-terminal, Gln19, and Gln24 deamidation). The 
animals either received a tirzepatide batch containing around 10% impurities, a batch with a markedly 
lower level of impurities or vehicle. Tirzepatide caused the expected pharmacodynamic effects, most 
pronounced was reduced food intake and consecutive decreased weight gain. Notably, this effect was 
somewhat stronger in animals treated with the high-impurity batch. The reason is unclear; since 
toxicokinetic data were not obtained, it cannot be ruled out that this batch had a higher bioavailability 
and hence caused higher exposure. Nevertheless, it is reassuring that no hitherto unknown toxic 
effects were observed, and there is therefore no need to pursue this further. 
2.2.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects  
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of tirzepatide.  
Considering the above data, tirzepatide is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
The application is acceptable from a non-clinical viewpoint. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects  
2.3.1.  Introduction  
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. The MAH has 
provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out 
in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Overview of clinical studies 
Clinical pharmacology study supporting the CWM indication (not included in the original T2DM 
application) Study GPHU was conducted to characterise gastric emptying in participants with obesity. 
Tirzepatide clinical development program for the CWM application: 
-  One pivotal phase 3 study in participants with obesity or overweight, without T2DM (SURMOUNT-
1); 
-  Supportive: the 36-week tirzepatide open-label lead-in period data for a phase 3 study in 
participants with obesity or overweight, without diabetes mellitus (SURMOUNT-4, ongoing); 
Assessment report  
EMA/539700/2023  
Page 17/167 
 
 
 
-  Supportive: post-hoc subgroup analyses of the SURPASS 1-5 studies in patients with T2DM; 
these studies were pivotal for the T2DM indication; only subgroup analysis results in patients with 
BMI above 27kg/m2 are described in this AR. 
N.B. In this AR only studies which had been submitted newly for the CWM indication are described and 
assessed in detail. For studies which were part of the original T2DM application only aspects considered 
relevant for CWM are reported.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
Population PK model 
A population PK analysis was conducted with the data from adults with obesity or overweight. Sparse 
PK sample collection was implemented in Phase 3 study SURMOUNT-1, such that participants were 
randomized to sampling PK time windows of 1 – 24 hours, 24 – 96 hours, or 120 – 168 hours post 
dose at the 3 protocol-specified visits (Weeks 8, 16, and 36) across the duration of the study and PK 
samples were collected pre-dose at the same time as immunogenicity samples at 6 visits (Weeks 0, 4, 
12, 24, 48, and 72) across the duration of the study.  
The model structure and parameter estimates from the previously for the T2DM patients data 
developed model were used to inform the base model for the population PK analysis of data from 
SURMOUNT-1. The observed tirzepatide concentrations from adult participants with obesity or 
overweight in SURMOUNT-1 were adequately described by the same model structure as the population 
PK model previously developed from studies of tirzepatide for treatment of patients with T2DM. The 
PRIOR subroutine in NONMEM had been implemented to incorporate the parameter estimate 
information from the population PK model developed from the extensive tirzepatide concentrations 
collected in the studies of tirzepatide for treatment of patients with T2DM. The bioavailability of 
tirzepatide was incorporated into the PK model as a fixed value parameter based on the results of 
Study GPGE.  
In the development of the T2DM population PK model, the model estimate for the fraction of fat mass 
contributing to the allometry of CL and Q was close to 1 and when fixed to 1 did not show a significant 
change in objective function. Thus, total body weight (TBW) was included in the allometric effect on 
tirzepatide CL in the population PK model for patients with T2DM. In the analysis of SURMOUNT-1, the 
estimate for the fraction of fat mass contributing to the allometry of CL and Q was 0.711 and was 
associated with a significant decrease in objective function compared to a model utilizing TBW. Thus, 
FFM and 71% of fat mass, a combined body mass less than TBW, was included in the allometric effect 
on tirzepatide CL and Q in the final population PK model for SURMOUNT-1. FFM and fat mass were 
calculated as follows: 
Eq 1. FFM (male) = 9270 x BW / (6680 + 216 x BMI)  
Eq 2. FFM (female) = 9270 x BW / (8780 + 244 x BMI)  
Eq 3. Fat Mass = BW – FFM    
The final model was a 2-compartment model with first-order absorption and interindividual variability 
(IIV) on ka, CL, Vc, and proportional residual error. Body weight as a time-varying factor was included 
on clearance and volume of distribution parameters. Allometric exponents were included as fixed 
values on CL, Q, Vc, and Vp parameters in the tirzepatide population PK base and final models (0.8 or 
1 for CL and Vd parameters, respectively).  
Overall, the population estimates from the SURMOUNT-1 population PK model were similar to the 
model estimates from the population PK model developed with data from patients with T2DM.

Effect of body weight on tirzepatide PK 
Body weight had been identified to have a significant influence on tirzepatide PK (Population PK 
analysis, procedure EMA/H/C/5620). As tirzepatide treatment is associated with significant weight loss 
over time, body weight was evaluated as a time-varying as well as a baseline covariate. 
Approximately, every kilogram increase in weight was associated with a 1.1% decrease in tirzepatide 
exposure (AUC0-τ).

tirzepatide 5, 10, or 15 mg QW for an individual with body weight of 70, 90, or 120 kg.
As visualised in the figure 6 above, exposure to tirzepatide increases with increasing body weight with 
the difference between weight groups most pronounced with 15 mg. 
Newly submitted exposure data from SURMOUNT-1 do not indicate a marked increase in tirzepatide 
exposure over time (see pop PK in this AR). 
Gastric emptying (GE) delay 
Study GPHU: was a phase 1, open-label, fixed-sequence study to assess the effect of multiple doses 
of tirzepatide (5 to 15 mg) on the PK parameters of acetaminophen to determine the impact on gastric 
emptying, PD, safety, and tolerability of tirzepatide in participants with obesity or overweight with or 
without T2DM when administered using a prefilled syringe. 
A total of 36 participants with obesity or overweight (18 with T2DM and 18 without T2DM) between the 
ages of 28 and 65 years, inclusive, with a body mass index of 27.12 to 44.87 kg/m2, inclusive, 
received at least 1 dose of study treatment, and 30 participants (15 T2DM participants and 15 non-
T2DM participants) completed the study. All 36 (100.0%) participants were of Hispanic or Latino 
ethnicity. 
Results: peak plasma concentration of acetaminophen as measured by Cmax was reduced by 
approximately 55% and 32% when acetaminophen was administered in the presence of 5 mg (Day 2) 
or 15 mg (Day 37) tirzepatide, respectively, compared to dosing with acetaminophen alone (Day -1). 
This is indicative of tirzepatide delaying GE, and the effect diminishes with repeated dosing over time.  
Peak plasma concentration of acetaminophen, as measured by Cmax, was reduced by a similar extent 
between participants without T2DM (55%) and participants with T2DM (56%) when acetaminophen 
was administered in the presence of 5 mg tirzepatide on day 2 compared to when administered alone, 
with geometric LS means ratio (90% CI) of 1.03 (0.796, 1.34). However, the reduction in Cmax was 
greater for participants with T2DM (43%) compared to participants without T2DM (20%) when 
acetaminophen was administered in the presence of 15 mg tirzepatide on Day 37 compared to when 
administered alone, with geometric LS means ratio (90% CI) of 1.40 (1.06, 1.85). Overall exposure to 
acetaminophen, as measured by AUC(0-tlast) and AUC(0-24) was similar when acetaminophen was 
administered alone (Day -1), in the presence of 5 mg tirzepatide (Day 2), and in the presence of 15

mg tirzepatide (Day 37). Overall exposure of acetaminophen, as measured by AUC(0-tlast), changed 
similarly for participants without T2DM and participants with T2DM, with geometric LS means ratio 
(90%) of 1.02 (0.842, 1.23) for 5 mg tirzepatide on day 2 and 1.14 (0.934, 1.40) for 15 mg 
tirzepatide on day 37. Delays in tmax of 1.00 and 0.50 hours were observed when acetaminophen was 
administered in the presence of 5 and 15 mg tirzepatide, respectively. The extent of delay was similar 
between participants without T2DM and participants with T2DM. The median tmax was approximately 
24 and 18 hours for 5 and 15 mg tirzepatide, respectively. The PK profiles and parameters of 
tirzepatide were generally similar between participants without T2DM and participants with T2DM. 
PD: The magnitude of the decrease in the 6-point PG was much more pronounced in participants with 
T2DM than in participants without T2DM at all time points.  
Safety: the co-administration of tirzepatide and acetaminophen was generally well tolerated in these 
groups of participants without T2DM and participants with T2DM. There were no clinically relevant 
changes in clinical laboratory evaluations, vital sign measurements, or electrocardiograms. No 
hypoglycaemic events or injection site reactions were reported. Overall, the TEAEs reported at the 
highest frequency were GI (nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distension), which is consistent with the 
safety profile of tirzepatide and drugs in the GLP-1 receptor agonist class. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics  
No new pharmacodynamics studies have been submitted, which is acceptable (for pharmacodynamics 
please refer to the AR for the initial MAA). 
2.3.4.   PK/PD modelling   
Body Weight Model 
The model developed from extensive PK and body weight data collected from multiple studies with 
participants with T2DM was used to guide the model development for analysis of SURMOUNT-1 data. 
In this study, the primary efficacy measure was body weight and was evaluated at Weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 
16, 20, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 across the study. Similar to the previously established PK/PD model for 
body weight reduction, a sequential PK/PD modeling approach was used to characterize the effect of 
tirzepatide on reduction in body weight in adult participants with obesity or overweight. Individual post 
hoc PK parameters from the population PK model were used to predict the time course of tirzepatide 
concentration, and the time-varying impact of weight reduction on PK was accounted for in the model 
by updating an individual’s PK parameters with each weight observation over time.  
An indirect response model was used to account for a delay in the effect of tirzepatide in reducing body 
weight. To best elucidate the effect of tirzepatide in reducing body weight, the dependent variables 
used for the modeling were FFM and fat mass. Although the model was developed using the 
subcomponents only, the sum of the predicted FFM and fat mass gives the model-predicted total body 
weight, which was compared against the observed body weight. Therefore, model diagnostics included 
FFM, fat mass, and total body weight.  
Tirzepatide had a significant effect in lowering body weight. According to the drug effect in the model, 
the reduction in body weight was predominantly due to tirzepatide decreasing fat mass about 3 times 
more than decreasing FFM. The drug effect was dose dependent, with higher doses resulting in greater 
loss of body weight. A maximum effect model best described the concentration-effect relationship. The 
typical ‘half-life’ for weight reduction was estimated to be about 22 weeks. This means that it would 
take about 2 years on a stable dose to get to a new steady state of body weight. A time-varying

placebo effect was also included in the model. The placebo effect waned over time, with a half-life of 
about 40 weeks. Sex was a significant covariate and was included in the final model. Females had a 
31% lower baseline FFM than males. Females also had a 5% higher baseline fat mass than males. 
Females had a higher Imax and IC50 relative to males. Asian race was also a significant covariate in 
the model, with Asian patients being estimated to have 11% lower and 25% lower FFM and fat mass at 
baseline, respectively.  
Nausea, Vomiting, and Diarrhoea Models   
Adverse events of special interest, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea were reported by 
participants and entered by study personnel into the electronic case report form at each study visit.  
During model building, tolerance was incorporated into the drug effects acting on the probability of 
transitioning from no AE to mild AE [P(1|0)], and no AE to moderate/severe AE [P(2|0)]. Accumulation 
and decay of the hypothetical tolerance compartment concentration is driven by the first-order rate 
constant, KTOL. A ‘first event’ effect was included to capture the increased probability of transitioning 
to a mild or moderate/severe state following occurrence of the first event and the presence of nausea 
impacted the transition probability to vomiting. A separate linear drug effect was applied to P(0|1) and 
P(0|2). P(1|2) and P(2|1) were not estimable for vomiting due to low number of transitions between 
mild and moderate/severe states and were fixed to low probability value.  
Differences in AEs between sex was included in the model. Females have a decrease in the nausea and 
vomiting tolerance rate constant (KTOL) relative to males. Therefore, females will develop tolerance 
slower than men resulting in a higher and more persistent probability of nausea and vomiting. In the 
NVD model submitted in the original T2DM application, Hispanic ethnicity and Japanese sub-race were 
included as significant covariates on the KTOL parameter. In these participants with obesity or 
overweight, Japanese differences were not estimable as there were no moderate/severe AEs and very 
few reported AE in general. Therefore, the transitions and differences to non-Japanese were fixed to 
low probability values or no differences. Caucasian patients had an increase in baseline probability of 
mild nausea relative to non-Caucasians.  
According to the Applicant, no patient-specific characteristics or tirzepatide administration conditions 
were associated with clinically relevant changes in tirzepatide efficacy, tolerability, or safety and hence, 
thus, no dose adjustments are recommended based on the PKPD models. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology  
Pharmacokinetics 
Study GPHU was newly submitted for the CWM program. It investigated gastric emptying delay caused 
by tirzepatide in overweight and obese patients with or without T2DM. Results showed that tirzepatide 
delayed GE, and the effect diminished with repeated dosing over time. No clinically relevant difference 
in delay of gastric emptying was shown in patients with or without T2DM. Delay of gastric emptying is 
one mechanism by which tirzepatide increases satiety and is therefore a desired action. 
Gastric emptying delay is adequately described in the SmPC. As study GPHU showed similar results as 
study GPGA (performed for the T2DM indication), the respective wording likewise applies to the CWM 
population and does not need to be amended. 
In section 5.2 of the SmPC it is stated: “Special populations; Age, gender, race, ethnicity or body 
weight, do not have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of tirzepatide.” 
Assessment report  
EMA/539700/2023  
Page 24/167 
 
 
 
 
In SURMOUNT-1 absolute weight loss exceeded 20 kg in a considerable proportion of patients (63% of 
patients achieved >20% weight reduction corresponding to an absolute weight loss of 28 kg in a 
person with baseline weight 140 kg). Based on the PK modelling result, every kilogram increase in 
weight was associated with a 1.1% decrease in tirzepatide exposure (AUC0-τ), and it can be expected 
that tirzepatide exposures increase over time during weight loss, necessitating dose reduction. 
These findings contrast with the exposure data from SURMOUNT-1, which showed no marked increase 
over time (see Pop PK in this AR). 
Although it is recognised that tirzepatide is up-titrated individually based on efficacy and tolerability, 
there may be inertia to reduce the dose; this may cause side effects in individual patients. The 
Applicant was asked to justify the sentence above in section 5.2 of the SmPC; the Applicant`s 
response indicated a dependency of tirzepatide PK on body weight. The population PK model, 
describing tirzepatide exposure between populations grouped by intrinsic factors, accounted for body 
weight. The Pop PK model showed exposure decreases with increasing body weight. According to the 
response, this did neither lead to insufficient exposure in patients with high body weight nor to excess 
exposure (and more frequent gastrointestinal AEs) in patients with low body weight.   
To adequately reflect the finding of a dependency of PK on body weight, the MAH was asked to change 
the sentence in section 5.2 to: 
“Special populations; Age, gender, race, ethnicity or body weight, do not have a clinically relevant 
effect on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of tirzepatide. Based on a population PK analysis, the exposure of 
tirzepatide increases with decreasing body weight; however, the effect of body weight on the PK of 
tirzepatide does not appear to be clinically relevant.” 
Overall, the issue of (moderately) increasing exposure during tirzepatide treatment is considered to be 
manageable in clinical practice where individual up-titration will be performed according to individual 
treatment goals and the dose may be adapted based on the physician`s judgement. 
Pop PK: in principle the model development is agreed and pcVPCs show adequate predictions.  
Pharmacodynamics 
No new studies have been submitted, which is acceptable.  
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology  
Study GPHU showed, that tirzepatide delayed gastric emptying, and that the effect diminishes with 
repeated dosing over time. No clinically relevant difference in delay of gastric emptying was shown in 
patients with or without T2DM. Delay of gastric emptying is one mechanism by which tirzepatide 
increases satiety and is therefore a desired action. Gastric emptying delay is adequately described in 
the SmPC. As study GPHU showed similar results as study GPGA (performed for the T2DM indication), 
this wording likewise applies to the CWM population and does not need to be amended. 
Effect of body weight (loss) on PK was further elucidated and accordingly reflected in section 5.2 of the 
SmPC.

Patient-reported outcomes (additional secondary endpoints) 
SF-36v2 acute form 
The SF-36v2 acute, 1-week recall version is a 36-item, generic, participant-administered measure. The 
measure assesses eight domains, including 
• 
Physical Functioning 
•  Role-Physical 
•  Bodily Pain 
•  General Health 
•  Vitality 
•  Social Functioning 
•  Role-Emotional, and 
•  Mental Health. 
The Physical Functioning domain assesses health functioning at the time of assessment, whereas the 
other seven domains assess health functioning from the past week. 
Scoring of domains 
Each item is scored individually on Likert scales of varying lengths:  
•  3-point scale 
•  5-point scale, or 
•  6-point scale. 
The 8 domain scores are then further aggregated into 2 component summary scores: 
• 
Physical Component Summary, and 
•  Mental Component Summary.

IWQOL-Lite-CT 
The IWQOL-Lite-CT is a 20-item, obesity-specific patient-reported outcome instrument developed for 
use in obesity clinical trials. It assesses two primary domains of obesity-related health-related quality 
of life: 
• 
• 
Physical composite, which includes 7 items, and 
Psychosocial composite, which includes 13 items. 
The IWQOL-Lite-CT total score is calculated by using all 20 items. 
This table describes what each composite score evaluates.

higher transformed score correspond to better health-related quality of life and functioning. 
EQ-5D-5L 
The EQ-5D-5L (EuroQoL Group 2019) is a standardized measure of health status. The EQ-5D-5L 
consists of 2 components including a 
• 
• 
descriptive system of the respondent’s health, and 
rating of their current health state using a 0 to 100 mm VAS. 
Overview of descriptive system of respondent’s health 
The descriptive system is made up of 5 dimensions:  
•  mobility 
• 
self-care 
Assessment report  
EMA/539700/2023  
Page 31/167 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
usual activities 
pain or discomfort, and 
anxiety or depression. 
In 2005, the 5L version was introduced. The 5L version scores each dimension at 5 levels: 
• 
• 
no problems 
slight problems 
•  moderate problems 
• 
• 
severe problems, and 
unable to perform or extreme problems. 
A formula that attaches weights to each of these 5 levels can then be used to derive a single health 
state index for each participant. The single health state index values range between (Dolan 1997) 
•  <0, indicating values as worse than death 
•  0, indicating health equivalent to death, and 
•  1, indicating perfect health. 
Overview of current health state rating 
The EQ-VAS records the participant’s self-rated health status on a vertical VAS. The vertical VAS 
endpoints are labelled as  
•  100 or best imaginable health state, and 
•  0 or worst imaginable health state. 
Estimands 
For objectives controlled for type 1 error at 72 weeks, there were two estimands of interest when 
evaluating the primary and key secondary efficacy objectives: 
1.  The treatment-regimen estimand (also referred to in the dossier as “hybrid estimand”), defined 
as the average treatment effect of tirzepatide relative to placebo at 72 weeks, as an adjunct to 
a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity, for the randomized participants 
regardless of the adherence to study drug.  
2.  The efficacy estimand, defined as the average treatment effect of tirzepatide relative to 
placebo at 72 weeks, as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity, in 
the randomized participants had they remained on their randomized treatment for the entire 
planned 72 weeks treatment duration.  
Design 
SURMOUNT-1 was a Phase 3, multicenter, double-blind study that randomly assigned participants to 
receive once-weekly, injectable placebo or tirzepatide 5, 10, or 15 mg. The study investigated the 
efficacy and safety of once-weekly doses of tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg compared with placebo on 
weight reduction. 
Assessment report  
EMA/539700/2023  
Page 32/167 
 
 
 
 
 
The 72-week primary study period in SURMOUNT-1 included a 
•  2-week screening period 
•  72-week primary treatment period for all participants, and 
•  4-week safety follow-up period for all participants except for those with prediabetes at 
randomization continuing into the additional 2-year treatment period. 
Only data from the 72-week treatment period (the primary study period) in all study participants have 
been reported. The design is depicted in the following figure 7. 
Figure 7. Study schema
Abbreviations: QW = once weekly; TZP = tirzepatide.  
Note: All participants will be randomized to at least 72 weeks of treatment to study the effects on body weight 
reduction. Participants who have prediabetes will be studied for a total of 176 weeks of treatment to provide 
sufficient follow-up time to detect potential differences in progression to T2DM (this 2 year treatment period for 
patients with pre-diabetes is ongoing). Randomisation was stratified by prediabetes status, country and sex

Dose-escalation scheme 
Study drug dose escalation was double-blinded. The escalation period lasted up to 20 weeks. For 
participants randomly assigned to tirzepatide, the starting dose was tirzepatide 2.5 mg. Participants 
injected tirzepatide 2.5 mg QW for 4 weeks then increased the dose by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks until 
reaching the appropriate maintenance dose of 
• 
• 
• 
tirzepatide 5 mg 
tirzepatide 10 mg, or 
tirzepatide 15 mg. 
The study drug-escalation period lasted 20 weeks. Participants in the placebo group received matching 
once-weekly placebo. 
Study drug dose modification was not permitted during the primary study period except for 
management of intolerable GI symptoms. 
Background therapy 
For all participants, lifestyle modification was advised. This consisted of  
• 
• 
a hypocaloric diet with a 500-calorie deficit that was individually calculated, and  
an increase in physical activity by 150 minutes per week.  
Lifestyle counseling was administered throughout the entire study.

Statistical methods 
Analysis population and datasets: 
•  Modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population: All randomly assigned participants who took at 
least 1 dose of study drug. In the event of a treatment error, participants were analyzed 
according to the treatment to which they were randomly assigned. 
• 
• 
Efficacy analysis set (EAS): Data obtained during treatment period from mITT population, 
excluding data after early, permanent discontinuation of study drug (last dose date +7 days). 
Full analysis set (FAS): All available data obtained during treatment period from mITT 
population, regardless of adherence to study drug. 
•  Safety analysis set (SS): Data obtained during treatment period plus safety follow-up period 
from mITT, regardless of adherence to study drug.  
There were 2 estimands of interest in evaluating primary and key secondary efficacy objectives 
controlled for type 1 error: 
• 
• 
The treatment-regimen estimand (also referred to as the hybrid estimand in the study protocol 
and SAP), defined as the average treatment effect of tirzepatide relative to placebo at 72 
weeks, as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity, for the 
randomized participants regardless of the adherence to study drug. 
The efficacy estimand, defined as the average treatment effect of tirzepatide relative to 
placebo at 72 weeks, as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity, in 
the randomized participants had they remained on their randomized treatment for the entire 
planned 72 weeks treatment duration.  
(Note: For a single key secondary objective, the prespecified time point is 20 weeks.) 
Assessment report  
EMA/539700/2023  
Page 35/167 
 
 
 
 
 
Analyses related to the treatment-regimen estimand were conducted using the FAS. Analyses of 
continuous variables used an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with multiple imputation of 
missing data. Analyses of percentage of participants achieving target thresholds used a logistic 
regression, with missing continuous values imputed first and then dichotomized. Both models were 
adjusted for baseline value and stratification factors. Multiple imputation of missing data was 
conducted using hybrid imputation: 
• 
• 
For missing data solely due to exceptional circumstances, such as pandemic or natural 
disasters (after other reasons for missing data were ruled out), missing data were imputed 
using all non-missing data of the outcome measurement from the same treatment group. 
For missing data due to all other intercurrent events, missing data were imputed based on 
retrieved dropouts defined as observed outcome measurements from participants in the same 
treatment group who had their outcome measurement collected after early discontinuation of 
study drug. 
An additional sensitivity analysis for the co-primary endpoints was conducted using the FAS and guided 
by the treatment-regimen estimand where all missing data at the primary endpoint time point of 72 
weeks were imputed from retrieved dropouts only, regardless of the 2 missing data categories. 
Analyses related to the efficacy estimand were conducted using the EAS. Analyses of longitudinal 
continuous variables used a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) including treatment group, 
visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, stratification factors as fixed effects, and baseline value as a 
covariate. Restricted maximum likelihood (REML) was used to obtain model parameter estimates and 
the Kenward-Roger option was used to estimate the denominator degrees of freedom. An unstructured 
covariance structure was used to model relationship of within-patient errors. If this model failed to 
converge, the following variance covariance structures were tested in order until convergence was 
achieved: heterogeneous Toeplitz, heterogeneous first order autoregressive, heterogeneous compound 
symmetry, Toeplitz, first order autoregressive, and compound symmetry. Analyses of percentage of 
participants achieving target thresholds used a logistic regression, with missing continuous values 
imputed using the predicted values from the MMRM analysis and then dichotomized. For continuous 
health outcomes collected only once postbaseline per schedule of activities, the last observation carried 
forward (LOCF) approach was applied to impute the missing endpoint, unless specified otherwise. 
No type 1 error rate adjustments were made for conducting analyses relative to the efficacy and 
treatment-regimen estimands, as these 2 estimands were intended for different purposes. Within each 
estimand, the type 1 error was controlled at 5% two-sided for evaluating the primary and key 
secondary efficacy objectives as illustrated by the following figure.

Reason for premature discontinuation from study and study drug 
The most common reason for study discontinuation and study drug discontinuation was withdrawal by 
subject (5.8% and 7.0%, respectively).  
Kaplan-Meier plot of time to premature discontinuation 
Permanent premature discontinuations from study drug occurred throughout the duration of the study 
for participants in all treatment groups. There was a higher probability of treatment discontinuation for 
participants in the placebo group compared with participants in the tirzepatide groups.

Protocol deviations 
A total of 360 participants (14.2%) had at least 1 important protocol deviation. The most common 
important protocol deviations were related to the investigational product, study procedures, and 
eligibility.  
Investigational Product Category 
Incorrect stratification 
There were 151 participants identified with important protocol deviations related to the investigational 
product category with the deviation term of Incorrect stratification category. Of these participants, 84 
were incorrectly stratified as having prediabetes at randomization and 39 as having normoglycaemia at 
randomization. For participants who were incorrectly stratified in IWRS, the Applicant corrected this 
error by changing the glycaemic status. This allowed participants with prediabetes to continue onto the 
Assessment report

additional 2-year treatment period for participants with prediabetes at randomization. The corrected 
glycaemic statuses were used for all data analyses. 
There were also 26 participants incorrectly stratified for the ABPM addendum as using or not using HR-
controlling medications at random. Participants who were incorrectly stratified in the ABPM addendum 
were not corrected in IWRS as there were no implications to the study. Data analyses used the 
corrected medication based on protocol deviations. 
One participant was misclassified under the Incorrect stratification category. This participant should 
have been classified as an inadvertent enrollment for the ABPM addendum.

HR = heart rate; N = number of participants who were randomly assigned and received at least 1 dose of study 
drug; n = number of participants in specified category; TZP = tirzepatide. 
Potential overdose  
Overdose was defined as taking more than 15 mg of tirzepatide in less than 72 hours. During double-
blind trial conduct, potential tirzepatide overdoses were defined as two or more study drug injections 
within 72 hours. Potential overdoses were reported for 38 participants. Upon further review after 
unblinding of treatment assignment, eight of the 38 participants met the definition of tirzepatide 
overdose. Six participants were from the tirzepatide 10mg group and two were from the tirzepatide 
15mg group.  
Eligibility 
There were 84 (3.3%) participants with important protocol deviations related to the protocol deviation 
category of Eligibility. 
Inadvertent enrollment in main study 
Of the 84 participants with important protocol deviations related to Eligibility, there were 28 (1.1%) 
participants with important protocol deviations related to the main study. 
Assessment report

Inadvertent enrollment in ABPM addendum 
Of the 84 participants with important protocol deviations related to Eligibility, there were 56 (2.2%) 
participants with important protocol deviations with the deviation term of Inadvertent enrollment in 
ABPM addendum. Inadvertent enrollment in the ABPM addendum was due to a discrepancy between 
the inclusion and exclusion criteria between the main study and the addendum. For the main study, 
participants were excluded from the study if they had uncontrolled hypertension defined as SBP ≥160 
mmHg and/or DBP ≥100 mmHg (Exclusion Criterion 20). To be eligible for the ABPM addendum, 
participants should have had well-controlled BP (<140/90 mmHg), regardless of antihypertensive 
treatment. The 56 participants inadvertently enrolled in the ABPM addendum had SBP ≥140 mmHg 
and/or DBP ≥90 mmHg. This had no impact on the integrity of the addendum or on the safety of the 
participants. 
Pregnant and/or breastfeeding category 
Overall, 23 participants were identified with important protocol deviations related to the eligibility and 
safety categories with the deviation term of Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Six participants were 
indicated as having important protocol deviations related to eligibility with the deviation term of 
Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. However, none of these participants were pregnant or breastfeeding 
during the study. These participants were of childbearing potential and were not on the required 
contraception prior to randomization (see inclusion criterion). All six participants completed the 
primary study period on study drug. 
Safety deviation category  
There were 16 female participants and 1 participant’s wife who became pregnant during the study that 
were reported as important protocol deviations. These pregnancies were reported as important 
protocol deviations under the safety protocol deviation category. Per protocol, all 16 female 
participants who became pregnant permanently discontinued study drug. 
Overall, 3 participants were identified in the Applicant`s internal safety database as being pregnant 
during the study. All three female participants who became pregnant discontinued study drug. 
Prohibited Concomitant Therapies 
Use of metformin during the study was only permitted for participants diagnosed with T2DM. 
Important protocol deviations were captured for six participants who were not diagnosed with T2DM 
but received metformin. One participant did not have an important protocol deviation reported because 
they initiated metformin at the safety follow-up.  
During the study, the use of weight gain- and weight loss-promoting medications was discouraged, 
although not strictly prohibited. There were 14 participants, across all treatment groups, who used 
weight gain-promoting medications. FDA-approved weight loss medications were used by 4 
participants, 3 in the placebo group and 1 in the tirzepatide 10-mg group, with the intention to treat 
obesity and overweight.  
One additional participant was reported under the deviation term Received weight loss medication for 
receiving a GLP-1 receptor agonist during the study. GLP-1 receptor agonists were not permitted under 
any circumstances during the study. Six participants in total received either semaglutide or liraglutide 
during the study and are captured as important protocol deviations. 
Informed Consent Not Obtained 
One participant randomly assigned to the tirzepatide 15-mg group had an important protocol deviation 
with the deviation term Informed consent not obtained. The study site failed to obtain the

importance of ensuring all Informed Consent are obtained prior to study activities. 
Missing Body Weight at Week 72 
Following database lock, two important protocol deviations with the deviation term Missing weight at 
Week 72 were identified.

Please note: The above mentioned co-morbidities do not entirely match with the co-morbidity inclusion criterion; 
acceptable weight-related comorbidities for participants with BMI ≥27 kg/m2 and <30 kg/m2 included obstructive 
sleep apnea, hypertension, dyslipidemia, or cardiovascular disease. 
Concomitant therapy 
Per protocol, participants were permitted to use concomitant medications that they required during the 
study.  
Exceptions 
During the study 
•  GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors were not permitted under any circumstances  
•  metformin was only permitted for participants diagnosed with T2DM, and 
•  weight gain- and weight loss-promoting medications were discouraged, although not strictly 
prohibited. 
Concomitant medications used during study 
A total of 2289 (90.2%) participants used at least 1 concomitant medication during the study. The 
percentage of participants using concomitant medications was similar across treatment groups. 
Antihypertensive concomitant medication 
Concomitant medications needed to manage BP were allowed during the study. At least 1 
antihypertensive therapy was used by 757 (29.8%) participants at baseline  
At baseline, the most frequently used antihypertensive therapy classes were angiotensin II receptor 
blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and thiazides.

Antidiarrhoeal and Antiemetic Medications 
Investigators were allowed to prescribe medications such as antiemetic or antidiarrhoeal medications 
to mitigate GI symptoms and manage intolerable GI AEs after participants started study drug.  
Generally, more participants treated with tirzepatide than with placebo took antidiarrhoeal or 
antiemetic medications during the postbaseline period (subjects with more than one antidiarrhoeal 
medication: placebo 1.2%, tirzepatide 5 mg 5.4%, tirzepatide 10 mg 6.6%, tirzepatide 15 mg 6.3%; 
subjects with more than one anti-emetic medication: placebo 6.4%, tirzepatide 5 mg 14.1%, 
tirzepatide 10 mg 16.0%, tirzepatide 15 mg 18.1%). The most common antidiarrhoeal and antiemetic 
medications used were loperamide and ondansetron, respectively. 
Antihyperglycaemic Medications 
Use of antihyperglycaemic medications during the study 
If participants developed diabetes during the study, initiation of antihyperglycaemic therapies was 
allowed at the discretion of the participant’s usual care provider. DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor 
agonists were prohibited from use in the study. Participants that developed diabetes during the study 
were allowed to continue in the study and continue on study treatment. However, if a participant that 
developed diabetes was started and remained on a DPP-4 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist, then 
study treatment was discontinued. 
There were 20 (0.8%) participants who initiated use of antihyperglycaemic medications after 
randomization. Antihyperglycaemic medications were predominately used in the placebo group 
compared with the tirzepatide groups, irrespective of a reason to initiate the therapy. 
Participants diagnosed with T2DM who received antihyperglycaemic medications 
Assessment report  
EMA/539700/2023  
Page 48/167 
 
 
 
 
 
There were 5 participants who were diagnosed with T2DM and received either metformin (n=4) or 
semaglutide (n=1). Of these participants, 3 had prediabetes and 2 did not have prediabetes at 
randomization. Four of the participants were in the placebo group, and 1 participant was in tirzepatide 
10 mg group. 
Participants without a T2DM diagnosis who received antihyperglycaemic medications 
The remaining 15 participants were not diagnosed with T2DM but received antihyperglycaemic 
medications. Of these, 
•  9 received metformin (n=7) or dapagliflozin (n=2) to treat  
-prediabetes  
-glucose intolerance  
-insulin resistance, or  
-polycystic ovary syndrome  
•  1 received insulin lispro to treat postoperative hyperglycaemia, and 
•  5 received semaglutide (n=2) or liraglutide (n=3) to treat obesity or overweight, after having 
discontinued study drug. 
Important protocol deviations were determined in 12 of these patients (for details see section “protocol 
deviations” of this AR). 
Compliance with study drug 
Treatment compliance was defined as taking at least 75% of the required doses of study drug. Overall, 
study drug compliance during the entire treatment period was high (2473 participants, 97.4%) and did 
not differ across the treatment groups. 
Efficacy results 
Results of Multiplicity-Adjusted Testing Scheme for Primary and Key Secondary Endpoints 
The statistical analysis plan specified a graphical multiple-testing procedure for the primary and key 
secondary objectives for the efficacy estimand and treatment-regimen estimand. This procedure 
controlled the family-wise type 1 error rate at a 2-side alpha level of 0.05 for individual estimands. 
For both the treatment-regimen and the efficacy estimands, 
• 
tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg achieved superiority to placebo on the co-primary objectives of 
-percent change in body weight at Week 72, and 
-percentage of participants with ≥5% body weight reduction at Week 72

• 
pooled tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg achieved superiority to placebo on the key secondary 
objective of mean change in body weight at Week 20

• 
pooled tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg achieved superiority to placebo on the key secondary 
objective of mean change in SF-36v2 acute form Physical Functioning domain score at Week 
72. 
The full alpha = 0.05 will be passed along to the remaining endpoints at the end of the additional 2-
year follow-up period and final study completion. 
Results for the co-primary endpoint 
The co- primary endpoints for the 10 mg and 15 mg tirzepatide doses consist of  
• 
• 
mean percent change from baseline in body weight at 72 weeks, and 
percentage of participants achieving at least 5% body weight reduction at 72 weeks. 
The same objectives had been pre-defined for the 5 mg dose as key secondary endpoints. 
Please note: results for the tirzepatide 5 mg are given in this section (albeit pre-defined as key 
secondary). 
Percent change in body weight at Week 72 (first component of the co-primary endpoint) 
Using both the treatment-regimen and efficacy estimands, tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg each achieved 
superiority compared with placebo for mean percent change in body weight reduction from baseline to 
72 weeks.

Sensitivity analysis for percent change in body weight (all missing data imputed by 
retrieved drop-outs) 
A sensitivity analysis for percent change in body weight was conducted using the FAS and guided by 
the treatment-regimen estimand where all missing data at 72 weeks are imputed from retrieved 
dropouts only, regardless of the 2 missing data categories (in the analyses above a hybrid imputation 
approach was applied which handled missing data due to exceptional circumstances by using non-
missing data of the primary outcome measure from the same treatment arm=missing at random). This 
sensitivity analysis results showed consistency with the results given for the hybrid estimand. For 
brevity, results of this sensitivity analysis are not further detailed in this AR. 
Body weight change at 20 weeks 
Pooled tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg achieved superiority compared with placebo on the key secondary 
endpoint of mean change from baseline (reduction) in body weight at 20 weeks, using both the 
treatment-regimen estimand (-10.1 kg, placebo adjusted) and efficacy estimand ( 10.7 kg, placebo-
adjusted).

Percentage of Participants with ≥10%, ≥15%, or ≥20% Body Weight Reduction at Week 72 
Using both the treatment-regimen and efficacy estimands, tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg each achieved 
superiority compared with placebo for the percentage of participants achieving ≥10%, ≥15%, and 
≥20% body weight reduction from baseline to 72 weeks. The tirzepatide 5 mg group also had 
significantly greater percentage of participants achieving ≥10%, ≥15%, and ≥20% body weight 
reduction from baseline to 72 weeks compared with placebo (pre-defined as additional secondary 
endpoint).

Abbreviations: mITT = modified intent-to-treat; MMRM = mixed model for repeated measures; TZP = tirzepatide. 
Note 1: Logistic regression with missing value imputed by MMRM analysis for efficacy estimand; logistic regression 
with hybrid imputation analysis for treatment-regimen estimand.  
Note 2: For the tirzepatide 5-mg group, the percentage of participants achieving ≥10% or ≥15% body weight 
reductions at Week 72 is an additional secondary objective and is not controlled for type 1 error. Additionally, ≥20% 
body weight reduction at Week 72 is an exploratory objective for the tirzepatide 5-mg group.  
***p-Value <0.001 versus placebo for superiority. 
Body weight change at 20 weeks 
Body weight change at 20 weeks was assessed as a measure of early efficacy of tirzepatide on body 
weight reduction. Pooled tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg achieved superiority compared with placebo on the 
key secondary endpoint of mean change from baseline (reduction) in body weight at 20 weeks, using 
both the treatment-regimen estimand (-10.1 kg, placebo adjusted) and efficacy estimand (10.7 kg, 
placebo-adjusted).

The aim of this sub-study was to demonstrate that once-weekly pooled TZP 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg 
is superior to placebo for percent change from baseline in total body fat mass. 
Investigative sites performed the body composition DXA scans on either Hologic™ or Lunar™ DXA 
scanners at baseline and week 72 (or early termination); 255 participants enrolled in the DXA 
addendum. 
The table summarizes the percent change in total body fat mass at Week 72. Pooled tirzepatide 5, 10, 
and 15 mg achieved greater mean percent change from baseline in total body fat mass compared with 
placebo.

Change in waist circumference 
Using both the treatment-regimen and efficacy estimands, tirzepatide 5, 10 and 15 mg each achieved 
superiority compared with placebo for mean change (reduction) in waist circumference at 72 weeks.  
Change in waist circumference was a key secondary endpoint controlled for type 1 error for tirzepatide 
10 and 15 mg and was an additional secondary endpoint not controlled for type 1 error for tirzepatide 
5 mg.

Abbreviations: ANCOVA = analysis of covariance; BP = blood pressure; HR = heart rate; TZP = tirzepatide. 
Methodology 
At Visit 2 (Week -1), participants received education and training about ABPM. Prior to Visit 3 (Week 0) 
and following Visit 12 (Week 36), study sites collected ambulatory monitoring of heart rate (HR) and 
blood pressure (BP). 
Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion and exclusion 
A subset of participants eligible for SURMOUNT-1 was asked to participate in the ABPM addendum. 
Eligible participants for this addendum  
• 
• 
had well-controlled BP that was less than 140 mmHg over 90 mmHg, regardless of 
antihypertensive treatment, and 
if they were receiving treatment for hypertension, were on a stable regimen for at least 3 
months prior to screening. 
Participant disposition and characteristics 
A total of 2539 participants were randomized in SURMOUNT-1. Of these, 600 participants enrolled in 
the ABPM addendum. 
Results 
At Week 36, participants randomly assigned to tirzepatide 5, 10, or 15 mg compared with placebo had  
• 
• 
• 
significantly reduced 24-hour mean SBP (-7.4, -10.6, and -8.0 mmHg, respectively) 
reduced 24-hour mean diastolic BP (-2.0, -2.9, and -0.5 mmHg, respectively), and 
significantly increased 24-hour mean HR (2.1, 2.3, and 5.4 bpm, respectively).

The Physical Functioning domain assesses how a participant’s health limits them in activities completed 
during a typical day. The SF-36v2 Physical Functioning domain score was a key secondary endpoint 
controlled for type 1 error. Pooled tirzepatide 10/15 mg achieved superiority on the change from 
baseline (increase) in mean SF-36v2 Physical Functioning domain score compared with placebo. 
Tirzepatide 5 mg also achieved a significantly greater improvement in SF-36v2 acute form Physical 
Functioning domain at Week 72 compared with placebo (additional secondary efficacy endpoint). 
Greater improvements in physical functioning were seen for the subgroup of participants with 
limitations in physical functioning at baseline (assessed by the PGIS-Physical Function item).  
A meaningful within-patient change threshold was evaluated quantitatively for the SF-36v2 acute form 
physical functioning domain (norm-based score), using anchor-based and distribution-based 
approaches. The meaningful within-patient change threshold for improvement was 5.76 for the 
physical functioning norm-based score (with an associated range from 3.84 to 9.60). When applied to 
individual patient change scores from baseline to Week 72 for the Physical Functioning norm-based 
score, 32.8%, 36.6%, and 38.2% of participants receiving tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg, respectively, 
achieved clinically meaningful improvements in physical functioning as assessed by the SF-36v2 
physical functioning domain (that is, change from baseline ≥5.76) compared with 24.5% in the 
placebo group.

SURMOUNT-4 study-patients without T2DM (ongoing; supportive study) 
Study Design  
SURMOUNT-4 is an ongoing phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that was 
designed to assess the efficacy and safety of once-weekly tirzepatide maximal tolerated dose (MTD; 10 
or 15 mg) compared with once-weekly placebo for maintenance of weight reduction. During an initial 
36-week, open-label, tirzepatide lead-in treatment period, all participants received tirzepatide (10 or 
15 mg MTD). At the end of the lead-in period, participants were randomly assigned to switch to either 
once-weekly placebo or to continue on the tirzepatide MTD. The open-label tirzepatide lead-in period 
and protocol-specified interim database lock at 36 weeks are complete with results described below. 
The post-randomization double-blind phase of the study is ongoing.  
The design of SURMOUNT-4 includes 
• 
• 
• 
• 
a 2-week screening period 
a 36-week open-label tirzepatide lead-in treatment period (results included in this summary) 
a 52-week placebo-controlled double-blind treatment period (ongoing), and 
a 4-week safety follow-up period (ongoing). 
The following figure illustrates the study design, including the dose-escalation scheme.

Disposition  
A total of 782 of the 783 participants enrolled received at least 1 dose of tirzepatide in the 36-week 
open-label tirzepatide lead-in period of SURMOUNT-4 and were included in the enrolled population. 
Participants who were not able to tolerate the 10- or 15-mg dose of tirzepatide as their MTD by the 
end of the 36-week lead-in period were discontinued from the study. The final doses of tirzepatide 
administered during the 36-week open-label tirzepatide treatment period were distributed as follows:

Overall, 87.0% of the enrolled participants completed the 36-week lead-in period and 85.6% of the 
enrolled participants completed the lead-in period on tirzepatide. The highest percentages of 
participants in the open-label tirzepatide lead-in period discontinued from the study or study drug due 
to an AE (5.5% and 6.8%, respectively) or withdrawal by subject (3.8% and 4.1%, respectively).  
Results Summary  
Please note: these results are evaluated descriptively based on the observed data during the open-
label period in SURMOUNT-4 without imputation of missing data. 
Change in Body Weight Measures  
At the completion of the 36-week open-label tirzepatide lead-in period of SURMOUNT-4, participants 
treated with tirzepatide reduced body weight from baseline by on average 20.9%. 
In addition, the percentages of participants achieving body weight reduction targets of ≥5% (98.2%), 
≥10% (93.1%), ≥15% (78.7%), or ≥20% (57.0%) by the end of the 36-week tirzepatide lead-in 
period were substantial and clinically meaningful. 
Additional Measures  
Improvements from baseline were also observed for cardiometabolic and PRO-related measures by the 
end of the 36-week open-label tirzepatide lead-in period of SURMOUNT-4.  
SURPASS 1-5- studies in patients with T2DM (supportive studies)

SURPASS-1 
Study Design  
SURPASS-1 was a 40-week, placebo-controlled study, designed to examine the efficacy and safety of 
tirzepatide versus placebo in participants who had inadequate glycaemic control with diet and exercise 
alone and were naive to diabetes injectable therapy and had not been treated with any oral OAMs 
during the 3 months preceding the start of the study.  
The design of SURPASS-1 included: 
• 
• 
• 
an approximately 3-week screening and lead-in period (Study Period I) 
a 40-week treatment period (Study Period II), and 
a 4-week safety follow-up period (Study Period III). 
The following figure illustrates the study design, including the dose-escalation scheme.

includes all study participants, not only those with obesity or overweight.  
Disposition  
The 371 participants with obesity or overweight randomly assigned to treatment in SURPASS-1 
received at least one dose of study drug and were included in the mITT population.  
In the tirzepatide 5-, 10-, and 15-mg groups,  
•  85.3% to 93.8% of participants completed the study, and 
•  81.1% to 92.8% of participants completed study drug. 
In the placebo group, 84.7% and 84.7% of participants completed the study and study drug, 
respectively. Overall, the highest percentage of participants across the treatment groups discontinued 
from the study due to  
•  withdrawal by subject  
-tirzepatide: 1.0% to 9.5%, and 
-placebo: 5.9%, and  
• 
lost to follow-up  
-tirzepatide: 2.2% to 3.2%, and  
-placebo: 4.7%. 
Results Summary  
Three participants from the mITT population (1 randomly assigned to tirzepatide 15 mg, 2 randomly 
assigned to placebo) discontinued study drug due to inadvertent enrollment and were not included in 
the efficacy analysis set or the full analysis set. 
Change in Body Weight  
Tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg significantly reduced body weight from baseline at 40 weeks compared 
with placebo, using the treatment-regimen and efficacy estimands. Significantly higher percentages of 
participants randomly assigned to each dose of tirzepatide compared with placebo achieved body 
weight reductions of ≥5%, ≥10%, or ≥15%, using the treatment-regimen and efficacy estimands. 
Participants receiving tirzepatide 15 mg also achieved significant body weight reductions of ≥20%, 
using both estimands.

SURPASS-5 
Study Design  
SURPASS-5 was a 40-week, double-blind, phase 3 study designed to examine the efficacy and safety 
of tirzepatide versus placebo in participants with T2DM with inadequate glycaemic control on insulin 
glargine, with or without metformin.  
The design of SURPASS-5 included 
• 
• 
• 
an approximately 3-week screening and lead-in period (Study Period I) 
a 40-week treatment period (Study Period II), and 
a 4-week safety follow-up period (Study Period III). 
Participants of SURPASS-5 were required to be on stable doses of once-daily insulin glargine (>0.25 
U/kg/day or >20U/day) and metformin ≥1500 mg/day (if taken) during the 3-month period prior to 
Visit 1. To ensure a valid comparison of the randomized study treatments, participants were required 
to titrate the background insulin glargine using a TTT algorithm (Riddle et al. 2003). Participants were 
instructed to adjust insulin glargine doses to a target FBG of <100mg/dL (5.5 mmol/L).  
The following figure illustrates the study design, including dose-escalation scheme.

This parameter includes all study participants, not only those with obesity or overweight. 
Disposition  
The 407 participants with obesity or overweight randomly assigned to treatment in SURPASS-5 
received at least one dose of study drug and were included in the mITT population. In the tirzepatide 
5-, 10-, and 15-mg groups,  
•  92.2% to 98.0% of participants completed the study, and 
•  82.5% to 92.0% of participants completed study drug. 
In the placebo group, 98.0% and 97.0% of participants completed the study and study drug, 
respectively. Overall, the highest percentage of participants across the treatment groups discontinued 
from the study due to withdrawal by subject (tirzepatide, 1.0% to 3.9%; placebo, 2.0%). The highest 
percentages of participants across the treatment groups discontinued from the study drug due to an 
AE (tirzepatide, 5.7% to 9.7%; placebo, 3.0%) and withdrawal by subject (tirzepatide, 1.0 to 3.9%; 
placebo, 0%). 
Results Summary  
Three participants from the mITT population (1 randomly assigned to tirzepatide 10 mg and 2 
randomly assigned to tirzepatide 15 mg) discontinued the study drug due to inadvertent enrollment 
and were not included in the efficacy analysis set or full analysis set. 
Change in Body Weight  
Tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg significantly reduced body weight from baseline at 40 weeks compared 
with placebo, using the treatment-regimen and efficacy estimands. Participants randomly assigned to 
placebo significantly increased mean body weight from baseline to 40 weeks, using both estimands.  
Compared with placebo, significantly higher percentages of participants randomly assigned to all three 
doses of tirzepatide achieved body weight reduction of ≥5% and ≥10%, using both estimands. 
Significantly higher percentages of participants randomly assigned to tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg 
achieved body weight reduction of ≥15% compared with placebo, using both estimands. Significantly

Change in Waist Circumference  
Tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg significantly reduced waist circumference from baseline at 40 weeks 
compared with placebo, using the treatment-regimen estimand (-4.2, -8.4, and -8.8 cm, respectively; 
p<0.001). Tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg significantly reduced waist circumference from baseline at 
40 weeks compared with placebo, using the efficacy estimand (-4.5, -8.3, and -10.0 cm, respectively; 
p<0.001). 
Change in Lipid Parameters  
Tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg significantly reduced triglycerides, total cholesterol, non-HDL-C, LDL-C, 
and VLDL-C from baseline at 40 weeks compared with placebo, using the treatment-regimen and 
efficacy estimands. No significant differences were seen for HDL-C for any of the tirzepatide groups 
compared with placebo.  
Systolic blood pressure 
Tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg significantly reduced SBP from baseline at 40 weeks compared with 
placebo, using the treatment-regimen (-4.3, -6.2, and -10.8 mmHg, respectively; TZP 5 mg: p<0.05, 
TZP 10 and 15 mg: p<0.001) and efficacy estimands (-4.4, -7.0, and -12.3 mmHg, respectively; TZP 5 
mg: p<0.05, TZP 10 and 15 mg: p<0.001). 
Diastolic blood pressure 
Tirzepatide 15 mg significantly reduced DBP from baseline at 40 weeks compared with placebo, using 
the treatment-regimen and efficacy estimands (-2.2 and -2.6 mmHg, respectively; p<0.05).  
Percent change from baseline in fasting insulin 
Fasting insulin was not analyzed in this study because all participants received a background of insulin 
glargine which could confound the assessment of endogenous insulin. 
Change from baseline in HbA1c (%) 
Tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg significantly reduced HbA1c from baseline at 40 weeks compared with 
placebo, using the treatment-regimen (-1.26, -1.64, and -1.53%, respectively; p<0.001) and efficacy

SURPASS-2  
Study Design  
SURPASS-2 was a 40-week Phase 3 study designed to examine the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide 
versus semaglutide 1 mg once weekly in participants with T2DM who had inadequate glycaemic control 
with metformin alone. Semaglutide 1 mg once weekly was the highest dose of semaglutide available at 
the time that SURPASS-2 was designed and initiated. 
The design of SURPASS-2 included  
• 
• 
• 
an approximately 3-week screening and lead-in period (Study Period I) 
a 40-week treatment period (Study Period II), and 
a 4-week safety follow-up period (Study Period III). 
Participants enrolled in SURPASS-2 were required to be on stable doses of metformin ≥1500 mg/day 
for at least three months prior to screening, during the screening and lead-in period, and throughout 
the treatment period. 
The figure below illustrates the study design, including dose-escalation scheme. The open-label design 
was used for this study because of the differences in devices and dose-escalation schemes used for 
tirzepatide and semaglutide 1 mg.

respectively; TZP 5 mg: p<0.05, TZP 10 mg: p<0.01, TZP 15 mg: p<0.001). Tirzepatide 10 and 15 
mg significantly reduced fasting insulin from baseline at 40 weeks compared with semaglutide 1 mg, 
using the efficacy estimand (-14.9% and -19.7%, respectively; p<0.001). 
Change from baseline in HbA1c (%) 
Tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg significantly reduced HbA1c from baseline at 40 weeks compared with 
semaglutide 1 mg, using the treatment-regimen estimand (-0.15%, -0.38%, and -0.50%, 
respectively; TZP 5 mg: p<0.05, TZP 10 and 15 mg: p<0.001). Tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg 
significantly reduced HbA1c from baseline at 40 weeks compared with semaglutide 1 mg, using the 
efficacy estimand (-0.23%, -0.51%, and -0.64%, respectively; p<0.001). 
Change from baseline in fasting serum glucose 
Tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg significantly reduced FSG from baseline at 40 weeks compared with 
semaglutide 1 mg, using the treatment-regimen (-0.32, -0.59, and -0.66 mmol/L, respectively; TZP 5

Change in Patient-Reported Outcome Measures  
IWQOL-Lite-CT  
SURPASS-2 was the only SURPASS study providing primary support for the CWM indication that 
included the IWQOL-Lite-CT. 
At Week 40, statistically significantly greater improvements in IWQOL-Lite-CT total score, Physical 
Function composite score, and Physical composite scores were observed for tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 
mg compared with semaglutide 1mg among participants with obesity or overweight with T2DM in 
SURPASS-2. The Psychosocial composite score improved significantly with tirzepatide 15 mg compared 
with semaglutide 1 mg in SURPASS-2.

SURPASS-3  
Study Design  
SURPASS-3 was a 52-week, Phase 3 study designed to examine the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide 
versus insulin degludec in participants with T2DM who had inadequate glycaemic control with 
metformin, with or without an SGLT-2i.  
The design of SURPASS-3 included 
• 
• 
• 
an approximately 3-week screening and lead-in period (Study Period I) 
a 52-week treatment period (Study Period II), and 
a 4-week safety follow-up period (Study Period III). 
Participants enrolled in SURPASS-3 were required to be on stable doses of metformin ≥1500 mg/day 
and SGLT-2i (if used) for at least 3 months prior to Visit 1, during the screening and lead-in period, 
and throughout the treatment period. To ensure a valid comparison of the randomized study 
treatments, participants were required to titrate insulin degludec using a TTT algorithm. The initial 
dose of insulin degludec was 10 IU/day ideally at bedtime, titrated to a FBG <90 mg/dL (<5.0 mmol/L) 
(Philis-Tsimikas et al. 2013; Aroda et al. 2016; Pan et al. 2016). 
The figure below illustrates the study design, including the dose-escalation scheme. The open-label 
design was used for this study because of the different dosing frequencies, dose-escalation 
(tirzepatide) or titration (insulin degludec) schemes, and injection devices for tirzepatide and insulin 
degludec.

This parameter includes all study participants, not only those with obesity or overweight. 
Disposition  
The 1255 participants with obesity or overweight randomly assigned to treatment in SURPASS-3 
received at least 1 dose of study drug and were included in the mITT population.  
In the tirzepatide 5-, 10-, and 15-mg groups,  
•  91.6% to 95.6% of participants completed the study, and 
•  84.8% to 88.6% of participants completed study drug. 
In the insulin degludec group, 91.8% and 88.3% of participants completed the study and study drug, 
respectively. Overall, the highest percentages of participants across the treatment groups discontinued 
from the study due to  
•  withdrawal by subject

Two participants from the mITT population (1 randomly assigned to tirzepatide 15 mg and 1 randomly 
assigned to insulin degludec) discontinued the study drug due to inadvertent enrollment and were not 
included in the efficacy analysis set or the full analysis set. 
Change in Body Weight  
Tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg significantly reduced body weight from baseline at 52 weeks compared 
with insulin degludec, using the treatment-regimen and efficacy estimands. Participants treated with 
insulin degludec gained weight between baseline and the primary endpoint visit, likely due to the 
anabolic effects of insulin. Significantly higher percentages of participants randomly assigned to each 
dose of tirzepatide compared with insulin degludec achieved body weight reductions of ≥5%, ≥10%, 
≥15%, and ≥20%, using both estimands.

Body weight change over time 
Steady decreases in body weight were observed over time for participants of the 3 tirzepatide dose 
groups in SURPASS-3, with participants of each dose group reaching near-plateaus by the time of the 
52-week primary endpoint visit. These results show that participants with obesity or overweight with 
T2DM continue to have significant and clinically meaningful body weight reductions for at least 1 year 
from initiation of treatment. Participants treated with insulin degludec gained weight over the same 
time period.

Change in Waist Circumference  
Tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg significantly reduced waist circumference from baseline compared with 
insulin degludec at 52 weeks, using the treatment-regimen estimand (-7.8, -9.5, and -10.4 cm, 
respectively; p<0.001). Tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg significantly reduced waist circumference from 
baseline compared with insulin degludec at 52 weeks, using the efficacy estimand (-8.5, -10.8, 
and -12.0 cm, respectively; p<0.001). 
Change in Lipid Parameters  
Tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg significantly reduced triglycerides, non-HDL-C, and VLDL-C from baseline at 
52 weeks compared with insulin degludec, using the treatment-regimen and efficacy estimands. 
Additionally, all 3 doses of tirzepatide significantly increased HDL-C at 52 weeks compared with insulin 
degludec, using both estimands. There was no significant difference in LDL-C and total cholesterol 
between any of the tirzepatide groups and the insulin degludec group. 
Systolic blood pressure 
Tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg significantly reduced SBP from baseline at 52 weeks compared with 
insulin degludec in the subpopulation of participants in SURPASS-3 with obesity or overweight, using 
the treatment-regimen estimand (-5.6, -6.5, and -5.7 mmHg, respectively; p<0.001). Tirzepatide 5, 
10, and 15 mg significantly reduced SBP from baseline at 52 weeks compared with insulin degludec in 
the subpopulation of participants in SURPASS-3 with obesity or overweight, using the efficacy 
estimand (-5.3, -7.6, and -6.3 mmHg, respectively; p<0.001). 
Diastolic blood pressure 
Tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15mg significantly reduced DBP from baseline at 52 weeks compared with 
insulin degludec in the subpopulation of participants in SURPASS-3 with obesity or overweight, using 
the treatment-regimen estimand (-2.6, -2.6, and -2.2 mmHg, respectively; TZP 5 and 10 mg: 
p<0.001, TZP 15 mg: p<0.01).  
Tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg significantly reduced DBP from baseline at 52 weeks compared with 
insulin degludec in the subpopulation of participants in SURPASS-3 with obesity or overweight, using 
the efficacy estimand (-2.3, -2.9, and -2.5 mmHg, respectively; p<0.001). 
Percent change from baseline in fasting insulin 
Fasting insulin was not analyzed in this study because some participants received insulin degludec 
which could confound the assessment of endogenous insulin. 
Change from baseline in HbA1c (%) 
Tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg significantly reduced HbA1c from baseline at 52 weeks compared with 
insulin degludec, using the treatment-regimen estimand (-0.57%, -0.78%, and -0.92%, respectively; 
p<0.001). 
Tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg significantly reduced HbA1c from baseline at 52 weeks compared with 
insulin degludec, using the efficacy estimand (-0.55%, -0.88%, and -1.08%, respectively; p<0.001). 
Change from baseline in fasting serum glucose 
Tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15mg significantly reduced FSG from baseline at 52 weeks using the 
treatment-regimen (-2.63, -2.84, and -3.10 mmol/L, respectively; p<0.001) and efficacy 
(-2.69, -3.07, and -3.35 mmol/L, respectively; p<0.001) estimands. However, tirzepatide did not 
significantly reduce from baseline mean FSG at 52 weeks compared with insulin degludec.

SURPASS-4  
Study Design  
SURPASS-4 was designed to examine the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide versus insulin glargine in 
participants with T2DM and increased CV risk on stable treatment with at least 1 and no more than 3 
OAMs comprising metformin, SGLT-2i, sulfonylurea, or a combination. No participants were excluded 
based on low eGFR values. Increased CV risk was defined as the presence of 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
coronary heart disease 
peripheral arterial disease presumed to be of atherosclerotic origin 
cerebrovascular disease presumed to be of atherosclerotic origin  
age ≥50 years, history of chronic kidney disease, and an eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (chronic 
kidney disease-epidemiology) on consecutive measurements (Visits 1 and 2), or 
age ≥50 years and congestive heart failure documented as a history of congestive heart 
failure, New York Heart Association Functional Classification II to III. 
The design of SURPASS-4 included 
• 
• 
• 
• 
an approximately 3-week screening and lead-in period (Study Period I) 
a 52-week treatment period (Study Period II) 
a variable treatment period of up to an additional 52 weeks (Study Period III), and 
a 4-week safety follow-up period (Study Period IV). 
To ensure a valid comparison of the randomized study treatments, participants were required to titrate 
insulin glargine using a TTT algorithm. The initial dose of insulin glargine was 10 IU/day, ideally at 
bedtime, titrated to an FBG <100 mg/dL (<5.6mmol/L). 
The figure below illustrates the study design, including dose-escalation scheme. The open-label design 
was used for this study because of the differences in  
• 
• 
• 
dosing frequencies  
dose-escalation (tirzepatide) or titration (insulin glargine) schemes, and  
injection devices for tirzepatide and insulin glargine.

This parameter includes all study participants, not only those with obesity or overweight. 
Disposition  
1689 participants with obesity or overweight were randomly assigned to treatment in SURPASS-4, 
received at least 1 dose of study drug, and were included in the mITT population.  
In the tirzepatide 5-, 10-, and 15-mg groups,  
•  90.6% to 95.4% of participants completed the study, and 
•  86.3% to 88.6% of participants completed study drug. 
In the insulin glargine group, 88.6% and 86.4% of participants completed the study and study drug, 
respectively. Overall, the highest percentages of participants across the treatment groups discontinued 
from the study due to  
• 
death (tirzepatide, 0.4% to 4.3%; insulin glargine, 3.1%), and  
•  withdrawal by subject (tirzepatide, 0.4% to 2.4%; insulin glargine, 3.7%). 
The highest percentages of participants across the treatment groups discontinued from the study drug 
due to  
• 
an AE (tirzepatide, 5.8% to 6.8%; insulin glargine, 2.0%), and  
•  withdrawal by subject (tirzepatide, 1.1% to 2.4%; insulin glargine 4.7%). 
Results Summary  
Overall, 6 participants from the mITT population discontinued the study drug due to inadvertent 
enrollment and were not included in the efficacy analysis set or the full analysis set: 
•  1 randomly assigned to tirzepatide 5 mg 
•  2 randomly assigned to tirzepatide 10 mg  
•  1 randomly assigned to tirzepatide 15 mg, and  
•  2 randomly assigned to insulin glargine. 
Change in Body Weight  
Tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg significantly reduced body weight from baseline at the primary endpoint 
of 52 weeks compared with insulin glargine, using the treatment-regimen and efficacy estimands. 
Participants treated with insulin glargine gained weight between baseline and the primary endpoint 
visit, likely due to the anabolic effects of insulin. 
The percent body weight reduction was significantly greater with all 3 tirzepatide dose groups 
compared with insulin glargine starting at Week 4 and persisted through 104 weeks. The insulin 
glargine group had increases from baseline in body weight at all time points assessed.  
Significantly higher percentages of participants randomly assigned to each dose of tirzepatide 
compared with insulin glargine achieved body weight reductions of ≥5%, ≥10%, ≥15%, or ≥20%, 
using both estimands.

Change in body weight over time 
Steady decreases in body weight were observed over time for participants with obesity or overweight 
in in all dose groups. The effect plateaued at around 52 weeks for the tirzepatide 5- and 10-mg groups 
(-8.5% and -10.0%, respectively) and at around 62 weeks for the tirzepatide 15 mg group (-13.7%).  
The significant reductions in body weight from baseline with tirzepatide compared with insulin glargine 
started at Week 4. In contrast, the body weight of participants treated with insulin glargine increased 
from baseline at all time points assessed.  
For the subset of participants who reached 78 weeks (n=1008 [59.7%]), the body weight reductions 
were maintained (see figure below): 
• 
• 
• 
tirzepatide 5 mg: 166 participants (59.9%)

percent body weight reduction that was near-maximal at 62 weeks for the tirzepatide 5 mg group 
(-8.2%), at 52 weeks for the tirzepatide 10 mg group (-12.1%), and at 72 weeks for the tirzepatide 
15-mg group (-13.7%); thereafter, weight loss plateaued or tended to increase slightly (in the 15 mg 
and 5 mg dose groups Participants treated with insulin glargine steadily gained weight).

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy  
Proposed change 
With this type II variation the following indication is proposed to be added: 
“… 
Weight management 
Mounjaro is indicated as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for weight 
management, including weight loss and weight maintenance, in adults with an initial Body Mass Index 
(BMI) of 
• 
• 
≥ 30 kg/m2 (obesity) or 
≥ 27 kg/m2 to <30 kg/m2 (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight related comorbid 
condition (e.g., hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obstructive sleep apnoea, cardiovascular disease, 
prediabetes, or type 2 diabetes mellitus).” 
Design and conduct of the clinical studies 
Assessment report  
EMA/539700/2023  
Page 104/167 
 
 
 
 
The efficacy of tirzepatide for CWM in adults with overweight (BMI>27kg/m2) or obesity without T2DM 
has been investigated in one pivotal study (SURMOUNT-1). As supportive data, the 36-week open-
label lead-in period data of SURMOUNT-4, a phase 3 randomised withdrawal study in participants 
with obesity or overweight without diabetes mellitus has been submitted. This study is ongoing. Post-
hoc subgroup analyses of the patients with BMI above 27kg/m2 included in the SURPASS 1-5 studies, 
the pivotal studies for the T2DM indication, further support the CWM indication. 
Study designs 
SURMOUNT-1 was a phase 3, double-blind study that randomly assigned participants to receive once-
weekly, injectable placebo or tirzepatide 5, 10, or 15 mg to investigate weight loss. Randomisation was 
stratified based on glycaemic status at baseline (normoglycaemia or pre-diabetes). Results of the 72-
week double-blind treatment period have been reported with this submission. The double-blind period 
was followed by a 4-week follow-up period for patients without prediabetes at baseline and a 2-year 
additional treatment period followed by a 17-week safety follow-up in patients with prediabetes at 
randomisation (ongoing; data not included in this submission). 
Two addenda have been completed during the 72-week study period: 
• 
• 
The DXA addendum was designed to assess changes in body composition from baseline to 
week 72. 
The ABPM addendum was designed to assess mean change in 24-hour blood pressure and 
heart rate from baseline to week 36. 
The study design is considered adequate and generally in line with the recommendations in Guideline 
EMA/CHMP/311805/2014. The randomised treatment period of 72 weeks is adequate. Blinding may 
have been compromised due to the occurrence of gastrointestinal side effects or pronounced weight 
loss in the intervention arms.  
A longer treatment period for patients with pre-diabetes is considered adequate to capture a potential 
delay in onset of T2DM. It is in line with the recommendation in Guideline EMA/CHMP/311805/2014, 
section 6.3. (“To document the effect on some weight related outcomes, e. g. delay in onset of type 2 
diabetes mellitus, longer study durations may be needed…”). No claim with respect to diabetes 
prevention is made. 
SURMOUNT-4 is a multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that was designed to assess the 
efficacy and safety of once-weekly tirzepatide maximal tolerated dose (MTD; 10 or 15mg) compared 
with once-weekly placebo for maintenance of weight reduction. During an initial 36 week, open-label, 
tirzepatide lead-in treatment period, all participants received tirzepatide (10 or 15 mg MTD). At the 
end of the lead-in period, participants were randomly assigned to switch to either once-weekly placebo 
or to continue on the tirzepatide MTD. The 52- week post-randomization double-blind phase of the 
study is ongoing. Conduction of a study using a randomized withdrawal design is endorsed as it will 
provide information on the duration of effect (Guideline EMA/CHMP/ 311805/2014: “A randomised 
withdrawal design, randomising patients on active drug to continue treatment or switch to placebo 
may give some useful information on the duration of the effect.”) 
Post-hoc analyses from SURPASS 1-5 excluding patients with baseline BMI<27m2/kg have been 
submitted; these analyses included 86% of patients included in the overall SURPASS program which 
had been conducted for the T2DM indication. The SURPASS1-5 studies lack important design elements 
of chronic weight management studies. For instance, weight reduction was investigated as secondary 
endpoint and patients were not required to have at least one failed attempt to reduce weight by 
lifestyle modification. Lifestyle interventions in SURPASS 1-5 were tailored to T2DM (e. g. counselling 
dealt with hypoglycaemia). No calorie restriction was recommended on a regular basis; patients were 
Assessment report  
EMA/539700/2023  
Page 105/167 
 
 
 
asked “to continue their usual exercise habits and follow a healthy meal plan” (CSR SURPASS-1). 
However, the study results of SURMOUNT-1 and the SURPASS studies are similar; therefore, the 
differences in counselling did not have a major impact. 
Of note, in SURPASS 2 the active comparator semaglutide was administered at a dose of 1 mg, which 
is below the dose licensed for weight reduction (2.4 mg; see the SmPC of Wegovy); effect sizes have 
to be evaluated bearing this in mind. 
Overall, the SURPASS 1-5 post-hoc analyses add information on the efficacy of tirzepatide in 
overweight/obese patients with T2DM and patients from EU countries/the UK as well as for elderly, 
patient populations not or not well represented in SURMOUNT-1; these studies are considered 
supportive for efficacy. 
Doses and dose escalation scheme (SURMOUNT-1) 
The doses were selected based on body weight reduction observed in Study I8F MC GPGB, which had 
been performed for the T2DM indication. In this study, the weight reduction and HbA1c dose-response 
patterns were similar. Selection of the 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg doses is considered reasonable. Like in 
the SURPASS studies, an up-titration regimen (dose-escalation until week 20) was used in 
SURMOUNT-1 with the aim to ameliorate gastrointestinal side effects. Forced up-titration is adequate 
for study purposes and eases evaluation of dose-response. However, it does not reflect the mode of 
up-titration in clinical practice based on tolerability and therapeutic needs. No changes to the posology 
were introduced with this variation, which is adequate. 
Background therapy (SURMOUNT-1) 
For all participants, lifestyle modification was advised. This consisted of a hypocaloric diet with a 500-
calorie deficit that was individually calculated, and an increase in physical activity by 150 minutes per 
week. Lifestyle counseling was administered throughout the entire study. Lifestyle modification was in 
line with Guideline recommendations as regards calorie deficit and amount of physical activity (e. g. 
AACE/ ACE Guideline, Garvey et al, 2016). Regular enforcement through counseling throughout the 
study is endorsed.  
With the availability of new anti-obesity drugs, the contribution of lifestyle modifications to weight loss 
may become less. Interestingly, even more aggressive regimens seem not to confer greater benefit: in 
the STEP-3 study with semaglutide 2.4 mg, in which more aggressive lifestyle management (“intensive 
behavioral therapy”) add-on semaglutide was investigated, this did not lead to a more pronounced 
weight loss (compared to STEP-1 with standard recommendations; Wadden T. A. et al. 2021). 
Nevertheless, a healthier lifestyle contributes to weight loss, improves its sustainability and improves 
overall cardiovascular, metabolic and mental health. The indication wording adequately reflects that 
tirzepatide should be administered in addition to a calorie-reduced diet and exercise. 
Concomitant medication (SURMOUNT-1) 
Per protocol, participants were permitted to use concomitant medications that they required during the 
study (e. g. anti-emetics, hypertensive drugs, lipid lowering agents). 
Endpoints in SURMOUNT-1 
The co-primary endpoints for assessment of efficacy in SURMOUNT-1 were percent change in body 
weight and percentage of participants reaching ≥5% body weight reduction, measured from 
randomization to week 72. Additional efficacy measures studied included percent of participants 
reaching ≥10%, ≥15%, and ≥20% total body weight reduction, change in waist circumference, change 
in lipid levels, change in BP and change in glycaemic measures. To include the patient`s perspective 
the generic SF-36v2 physical functioning domain score was investigated as a key secondary endpoint

Page 106/167 
 
 
 
with control of type I error (change from baseline to week 72); the other seven domains of SF-36 were 
also evaluated. In addition, results of a responder analysis had been submitted.  
The IWQOL-Lite CT was developed and validated to assess weight-related changes in physical and 
psychosocial functioning in subjects with overweight or obesity. No clinically relevant differences 
(neither for mean changes from baseline nor for within-patient changes) had been pre-defined in the 
CSR. Overall, PRO results have to be seen in the light of potential unblinding of patients who might 
have become aware of their treatment assignment (due to pronounced weight loss or gastrointestinal 
intolerance). 
In a subgroup of patients a validated method (DEXA) was applied to estimate body fat. 
Primary and secondary endpoints were in accordance with regulatory guidance (Guideline on clinical 
evaluation of medicinal products used in weight management 2016, EMA/CHMP/311805/2014). 
Endpoints in SURPASS 1-5 
In SURPASS 1-5, the primary objective was related to glycaemic control; however, mean change from 
baseline in body weight was a key secondary objective controlled for type 1 error. Percentage of 
participants reaching ≥5% body weight reduction was an additional secondary objective not controlled 
for type 1 error. 
Population studied (SURMOUNT-1) 
Patients with a body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m2, or a BMI ≥27 kg/m2 and at least one weight related 
comorbidity with at least one self-reported unsuccessful dietary effort to lose weight were included. 
The patient population included in SURMOUNT-1 represents the intended target population for 
tirzepatide as CWM treatment. The average baseline BMI was 38.0 kg/m2. Approximately 32% of the 
participants had a BMI of at least 40 kg/m2. Patients with BMI below 30kg/m2 made up only 5.5% of 
the study population. 
Acceptable weight-related comorbidities for participants with BMI ≥27 kg/m2 and <30 kg/m2 included 
obstructive sleep apnoea, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, or cardiovascular disease. Nearly two-thirds of 
the participants had at least one weight-related comorbidity at baseline. While the diagnosis of 
diabetes was exclusionary, about 41% of the participants had prediabetes diagnosed at baseline, 
based on HbA1c, FSG, and oral glucose tolerance test assessment during screening. The average 
HbA1c was 5.6% at baseline. 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria are considered adequate. The BMI cut-offs of 30kg/m2 and 27 kg/m2 
(requirement of at least one weight-related co-morbidity) had likewise been applied to characterize the 
target population for GLP-1 agonists for the treatment of overweight and obesity (EPAR Saxenda, 
EMEA/H/C/003780; EPAR Wegovy EMEA/H/C/005422). 
Overall, demographic and baseline characteristics were comparable across the treatment groups. 
No European patients were included in the SURMOUNT studies. The Guideline EMA/CHMP/311805/2014 
states that “a relevant number of patients should be included from EU countries with baseline 
characteristics, lifestyle and non-pharmacological obesity interventions similar to those of EU 
countries”. This deficiency is countered by the SURPASS 3, 4 and 5 studies which included a 
considerable proportion of European patients (53.9%, 29.0% and 79.1%, respectively). Further, in 
SURMOUNT-1 44.9% of patients were from North America where lifestyle and non-pharmacological 
obesity interventions are similar to the EU. 
The average age in SURMOUNT 1 was 44.9 years; the patients were on average about 10-15 years 
younger compared to the SURPASS 1-5 studies (53.0 to 63.2 years). The younger age in SURMOUNT 1 
reflects a somewhat distinct clinical population; the prevalence of obesity, particularly severe obesity, 
Assessment report  
EMA/539700/2023  
Page 107/167 
 
 
 
is highest among 40- to 59-year-old individuals (NCHS 2020), and across age groups, the use of anti-
obesity medication is lowest among those who are >65 years (MacEwan et al. 2021). 
In SURMOUNT-1, across treatment groups, 152 participants (6.0%) were >65 years old, and eight 
participants (0.3%) were >75 years old. The low number of patients older than 75 years in 
SURMOUNT-1 may be partly compensated by a greater representation of this age group in the 
SURPASS 1-5 studies (148 patients, 3.3% older than 75 years). A pooled analysis including all 
obese/overweight patients from SURMOUNT-1 and SURPASS1-5 above 75 years was requested and 
further performed by the MAH to further elucidate efficacy in the elderly. Percent change in body 
weight from baseline was assessed in 243 participants having body weight measurement available at 
baseline (134 treated with tirzepatide [any dose], and 109 participants from control groups [either 
placebo or active comparators]). Percent change in body weight from baseline in elderly participants 
treated with tirzepatide was -9.9% (comparator-adjusted: -9.7%) at Week 40, -10.3% (comparator-
adjusted: -10.2%) at Week 52, and -10.1% (comparator-adjusted: -10.3%) at Week 72. Decreases in 
body weight at all time points were statistically significant from baseline, and when compared to 
changes in body weight in participants in control groups. Body weight reductions were clinically 
relevant in patients above 75 years of age. Hence, the wording in section 4.2 which points at sparse 
data in patients above 85 years is acceptable and can remain unchanged (it has been shifted with this 
variation from SmPC section 4.4 to SmPC section 4.2). 
Few patients with moderate (n=44) and no patients with severe renal impairment had been included. 
The wording in section 4.2 of the SmPC applicable to the T2DM indication is limited to severe renal 
impairment and no change is proposed with this variation: “Renal impairment: no dose adjustment is 
required for patients with renal impairment including end stage renal disease (ESRD). Experience with 
the use of tirzepatide in patients with severe renal impairment and ESRD is limited. Caution should be 
exercised when treating these patients with tirzepatide (see section 5.2).” To further justify this 
wording, a subgroup analysis for the primary endpoint for the 44 patients with moderate renal 
impairment was requested during the procedure . Efficacy was maintained in this subgroup with effect 
sizes comparable to the overall population. TEAE were presented for the safety analysis set for patients 
with moderate renal impairment. It is acknowledged that the total number of participants in the eGFR 
category ≥30 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 is considerably lower than in the higher eGFR categories. 
Moreover, the absolute number of cases within each event is relatively low and it is difficult to 
establish a plausible causal relationship with tirzepatide treatment. Based on these considerations, the 
applicant concluded that the observed increase in OR with decreasing kidney function may rather be a 
chance finding without clinical relevance.  
Statistical methods 
Two estimands of interest were defined for SURMOUNT-1 and SURPASS-1 to -5. 
The treatment-regimen estimand targets the treatment effect regardless of adherence to randomised 
treatment (treatment policy strategy). Analyses related to the treatment-regimen estimand were 
conducted using all available data obtained during treatment period regardless of adherence to study 
drug (for SURMOUNT-1 and SURPASS studies) or initiation of rescue antihyperglycaemic medication 
(for SURPASS studies). Analysis of continuous data used an analysis of covariance model adjusted for 
baseline value and stratification factors. Analysis of proportion of participants achieving target 
thresholds was performed by dichotomizing the continuous outcome, followed by a logistic regression 
that was adjusted for baseline value and stratification factors. In SURMOUNT-1, missing data were 
imputed using hybrid imputation: Missing data due to exceptional circumstances (i.e., pandemics or 
natural disasters) were imputed using all non-missing data of the outcome measurement from the 
Assessment report  
EMA/539700/2023  
Page 108/167 
 
 
 
 
same treatment arm (missing at random) and missing data due to all other intercurrent events other 
than previously defined exceptional circumstances were imputed based on retrieved dropouts defined 
as observed outcome measurements from participants in the same treatment group who had their 
outcome measurement collected after early discontinuation of study drug. A sensitivity analysis for the 
co-primary endpoints was conducted where all missing data were imputed from retrieved dropouts 
only. In SURPASS-1 to -5, missing data were imputed using retrieved dropout (active controlled trials; 
SURPASS-2, -3, and -4) or placebo imputation (placebo-controlled trials; SURPASS-1 and -5). 
The efficacy estimand targets the on-treatment efficacy not confounded by discontinuation of study 
drug (for SURMOUNT-1 and SURPASS studies) or initiation of rescue antihyperglycaemic therapy (for 
SURPASS studies), which reflects the treatment effect for patients who are willing and able to take the 
drug as prescribed (hypothetical strategy). Analyses related to the efficacy estimand were conducted 
using data obtained during treatment period, excluding data after early, permanent discontinuation of 
study drug (last dose date + 7 days; for SURMOUNT-1 and SURPASS studies) or initiating rescue 
antihyperglycaemic medication (for SURPASS studies). Analysis of longitudinal continuous variables 
used a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) using restricted maximum likelihood estimation 
under missing at random. Analysis of proportion of participants achieving target thresholds used a 
logistic regression model. Missing values were imputed using the predicted values from MMRM analysis 
for respective endpoints. The imputed values were further dichotomized for analysis of proportion of 
participants achieving target thresholds. For continuous outcomes collected only once postbaseline, the 
last observation carried forward approach was applied to impute the missing endpoint, unless specified 
otherwise. 
As the guideline (EMA/CHMP/311805/2014) recommends to follow-up all patients for the duration of 
the trial to get a measure of weight change regardless of adherence to randomised treatment, the 
treatment-regimen estimand is considered more relevant for regulatory decision making than the 
efficacy estimand. The dataset used for analyses related to the treatment-regimen estimand and 
handling of missing data are acceptable. 
In SURMOUNT-1, the type 1 error was controlled at 5% two-sided for evaluating the primary and key 
secondary efficacy objectives within each estimand, which is considered appropriate. The results of the 
SURPASS-1 to -5 studies presented are all post hoc analyses which were not controlled for type 1 
error. 
Conduct of SURMOUNT-1 
In general, this study was well-conducted. Treatment compliance was defined as taking at least 75% 
of the required doses of study drug. Overall, study drug compliance during the entire treatment period 
was high (2473 participants, 97.4%) and did not differ across the treatment groups. 
Patient retention during the primary, double-blind period of the study was high, with 88-90% of 
patients on tirzepatide doses completed the double-blind period (77% on placebo); likewise, adherence 
to study drug was high. Compared to previous studies for CWM with only 50-70% of patients 
completing the studies (Greenway et al, 2010, Pi-Sunyer et al., 2015), retention rates in SURMOUNT-1 
were high. COVID-19 related disruptions did not have a meaningful impact on study discontinuations 
and/or study drug discontinuations, or collection of efficacy measures.

In comparison with placebo, tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg each achieved superiority with both the 
treatment-regimen and efficacy estimands on the co-primary endpoints: 
• 
• 
mean percent change (reduction) in body weight from baseline at 72 weeks, and 
percentage of participants achieving ≥5% body weight reduction from baseline to 72 weeks. 
Tirzepatide treatment led to clinically meaningful weight reductions across doses. The mean percent 
weight reduction for tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg at 72 weeks was 15%, 19.5%, and 20.8%, 
respectively. With placebo, weight reduction from baseline was 3.1%. Effect sizes are considered 
large; the effect sizes for tirzepatide 10 mg and 15 mg approached those achieved with bariatric 
surgery for which weight reduction of approximately 25 to 30% at 1 to 2 years had been reported 
(Aminian A et al, 2021; van Rijswijk et al, 2021). 
All doses of tirzepatide demonstrated superiority to placebo for the percentage of participants 
achieving ≥5% weight reduction from baseline to 72 weeks (85.1% , 88.9%, and 90.9% with 
tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg, respectively; placebo 34.5%). A body weight reduction of 5% is 
considered clinically relevant as it translates in an improvement of cardiovascular health (Ryan and 
Yockey, 2017). Results for percent change in body weight were consistent across all subgroups, 
including ethnicity. Albeit only 5.5% of patients had baseline body weight below BMI 30kg/m2, the 
subgroup analysis for percent change in body weight clearly indicated benefit for overweight patients 
(BMI>27kg/m2). 
Other weight reduction related endpoints 
Tirzepatide was superior to placebo in achieving ≥10%, ≥15%, and ≥20% body weight reduction from 
baseline to 72 weeks. Across tirzepatide dose groups, a weight loss ≥10% was observed in 68.5%, 
78.1% and 83.5% of patients, compared to 18.8% with placebo; weight loss ≥15% was observed in 
48.5%, 66.6% and 70.6% of patients compared with 8.8% with placebo; a weight loss ≥20% was 
achieved in 30.0%, 50.1% and 56.7% of patients compared with 3.1% with placebo. Weight 
reductions of at least 10%, 15% and 20% often are a desired goal in the target population, especially 
in patients with very high BMI. Improvement of some weight related complications (reduce 
inflammation in NASH; reduce fat burden in obstructive sleep apnoea, knee pain, and osteoarthritis) 
seem to require higher weight loss than 5% (Ryan and Yockey, 2017). 
Body weight change at 20 weeks was evaluated as a measure of early efficacy of tirzepatide. Clinically 
relevant effect sizes for body weight reduction were shown at week 20 for the pooled 10 mg and 15 
mg tirzepatide group. Data on early non-response had not been submitted initially; no stopping rules 
are proposed in the label. According to the Guideline EMA/CHMP/311805/2014 “the predictive value of 
weight loss after short-term treatment (e.g. 12 weeks treatment on target treatment dose) with 
respect to long-term efficacy should be documented, in order to better identify a population with 
expected long-term benefit and include a potential stopping rule for non-responders in the product 
label”. Therefore, the Applicant was requested to determine the predictive value of response (> 5% 
weight loss) and non-response (< 5% weight loss) at week 12, 16 and week 20 for response or non-
response at week 72; to perform this analysis for all doses separately and to propose a stopping rule, 
if appropriate. In addition, the applicability of a stopping rule for exaggerated response should be 
discussed. As requested the Applicant performed analyses in early non-responders (less than 5% 
weight loss, less than 3% weight loss at Week 12 and Week 24). Selection of the 24-week time-point 
is accepted, as due to up-titration dose-related response cannot be assessed at earlier timepoints. The 
analyses exploring the predictive value of early non-response showed that considerable proportions of 
patients who did not respond at week 24, responded (=achieved more than 5% body weight 
reduction) at week 72. For example: of those who did not achieve 5% body weight reduction at week 
24, 53% on tirzepatide 5mg, 67.7% on tirzepatide 10 mg, and 71.9% on tirzepatide 15 mg (compared 
Assessment report  
EMA/539700/2023  
Page 110/167 
 
 
 
to 13.4% on placebo) achieved over 5% body weight reduction at week 72. In clinical practise, 
response rates may be higher than those achieved with 5 mg (53%), as a patient on 5 mg with good 
tolerability but insufficient weight loss is expected to be up-titrated (which was not possible in 
SURMOUNT-1 in patients allocated to the 5 mg treatment arm). The analyses performed with a lower 
cut-off for non-response (>3% body weight reduction) likewise showed that about half of the early 
non-responders (43-57%) had response at week 72. It is agreed with the MAH, that the value of 
assessment of non-response at week 12 is limited, as patients had not achieved their target dose. In 
contrast, the predictive value of short-term response (in contrast to non-response) on response at day 
72 is high. Since the overall percentage achieving ≥5% weight loss at week 72 is 89% to 96%, and the 
percentage of non-responders at Week 24 achieving ≥5% weight loss at Week 72 is 53% to 72%, more 
than 90% of short-term responders achieved ≥5% weight loss at Week 72, as such meeting the 
responder criterion. Overall, it is agreed that -in the light of the high early and late response rates- the 
predictive value of early response (>5% weight loss) or non-response (<5% weight loss, <3% weight 
loss) for response or non-response at week 72 is limited and does not justify introducing stopping rules 
for tirzepatide for weight management. 
Results for waist circumference supported the results of the co-primary endpoints. Losses in waist 
circumferences were -14.0 cm, -17.7 cm, and -18.5 cm across tirzepatide dose groups, compared with 
-4.0 cm with placebo; this is considered beneficial, as central adiposity is associated with 
cardiovascular risk (Huxley et al., 2010). Results from the DXA sub-study demonstrated that mean 
percent reduction from baseline in total body fat mass was significantly greater for pooled tirzepatide 
5, 10, and 15 mg (-33.9%) compared with placebo (-8.2%). Hence, weight loss was associated with 
loss of fat mass (as distinct from body water or muscle mass), which is desirable. 
Cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular benefit 
Tirzepatide improved cardiovascular risk factors beyond overweight/obesity. Clinically meaningful 
improvements were shown for lipid parameters, blood pressure and measures of glycaemic control. In 
addition to reductions in HbA1c, 95.3% (726 out of 762 patients) of tirzepatide-treated participants 
with prediabetes at baseline reverted to normoglycemia at week 72, compared with 61.9% (167 out of 
270 patients) of placebo-treated participants. Stopping progress to T2DM is considered relevant. 
To determine how improvements in cardiovascular risk factors translate into reduced morbidity and 
mortality in overweight/obese adults, a phase 3 Study (I8F MC GPIJ; SURMOUNT-MMO) is ongoing. 
SURMOUNT-MMO is a long-term, double-blind, placebo controlled, event-driven study that will 
determine if tirzepatide is better than placebo in reducing obesity-related disease and death in adults 
living with obesity and established CVD or CVD risk factors, excluding diabetes. Completion of 
SURMOUNT MMO is projected for 2027. In addition, results from SURPASS-CVOT, in participants with 
T2DM, may provide further insights. Completion of SURPASS-CVOT is projected for 2024 (please refer 
to safety part of this AR for assessment of cardiovascular safety). 
Body weight change over time and sustainability of action 
The percent body weight changes showed separation from placebo starting at week 4 for all three 
tirzepatide groups. The body weight for participants in the tirzepatide 5 mg group continued to 
decrease through week 60 and plateaued by week 72. In the higher dose groups, weight reduction 
attenuated but seemed to continue through week 72. Upon availability, the Applicant should provide 
data of the four week safety follow-up period to further characterise the time course of weight 
reduction across tirzepatide doses.  
Patient reported outcomes 
Compared with placebo all doses of tirzepatide led to small improvements (changes from baseline to 
Assessment report  
EMA/539700/2023  
Page 111/167 
 
 
 
week 72) in SF-36V2 scores measuring overall HrQoL and functioning, physical function and the 
psychosocial composite score. Score differences in the IWQOL-Lite-CT scores were shown for 
tirzepatide compared to placebo. No clinically relevant differences (neither for mean changes from 
baseline nor for within patient changes) had been pre-defined in the CSR. Overall, tirzepatide showed 
consistent small benefits on how overweight/obese patients feel and function. The small effect sizes 
may partly be caused by high baseline scores. The clinical relevance of the effect size is insufficiently 
established. This is accordingly reflected in the revised SmPC. 
Concomitant medication 
As expected, more patients in the tirzepatide compared to the placebo group used antidiarrhoeal and 
antiemetic medication. Use of anti-hypertensive drugs was reduced in the interventions arms during 
the study, while lipid lowering drugs were slightly reduced to a comparable extent in all treatment 
arms. 
Results of supportive studies 
At the completion of the 36-week open-label tirzepatide lead-in period of SURMOUNT-4, participants 
treated with tirzepatide reduced body weight from baseline by 20.9%. During this open-label period, 
88% of patients had been up-titrated to 15 mg. In addition, the percentages of participants achieving 
body weight reduction targets of ≥5% were 98.2%, ≥10% (93.1%), ≥15% (78.7%), or ≥20% (57.0%) 
by the end of the 36-week tirzepatide lead-in period. Improvements from baseline were also observed 
for cardio-metabolic and PRO-related measures. Overall, the SURMOUNT-4 open-label lead-in period 
results were well in line with the outcome of SURMOUNT-1. 
Post-hoc subgroup analyses from SURPASS 1-5 in patients with BL BMI>27kg/m2 and T2DM (results 
presented for the treatment regimen estimand) 
All tirzepatide doses led to a clinically meaningful improvement in percent reduction in body weight in 
the subgroup analyses of all studies. In SURPASS-1 the percent change from baseline was -1.3% with 
placebo and -7.3%, -8.6% and -9.3% with 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg tirzepatide, respectively. In 
SURPASS-5 the percent change from baseline was -1.6% with placebo and -5.8%, -8.1% and -9.4% 
with 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg tirzepatide, respectively. In SURPASS-2 the percent change from 
baseline was -6.1% with semaglutide 1 mg (dose below licensed semaglutide dose for CWM) and -
8.2%, -10.2% and -12.0 % with 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg tirzepatide, respectively. In SURPASS-3 the 
percent change from baseline was 2.1kg with insulin degludec, and -7.7%, -10.5% and -12.0% with 5 
mg, 10 mg and 15 mg tirzepatide, respectively. In SURPASS-4 the percent change from baseline was 
1.7% with insulin glargine and –7.3%, -10.0% and -12.2% with 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg tirzepatide, 
respectively. Other weight related endpoints (waist circumference, percentage of patients reaching 
weight reduction targets) supported the results on percent reduction in body weight. In addition, for 
patients with overweight/obesity in SURPASS 1-5 tirzepatide showed improvements in lipid profile, BP, 
HbA1c, and HrQoL consistent with the effects in SURMOUNT-1 in patients without T2DM. 
In contrast to the SURMOUNT-1 study, patients from the EU/UK had been included in the SURPASS 3, 
4 and 5 studies and subgroup analyses did not hint at differences in weight loss between ethnic 
groups.  
Albeit cross-study comparison has to be done cautiously (as the SURPASS studies were not designed 
as CWM studies), body weight reductions were greater in participants with obesity or overweight 
without T2DM than in participants with obesity or overweight with T2DM (without T2DM 15.0% to 
20.9%, with T2DM 5.8% to 12.2%). This may partly be due to anti-hyperglycaemic medication (SU, 
insulin). An additive effect of the more eagerly supervised lifestyle management in SURMOUNT-1 might

Page 112/167 
 
 
 
 
have contributed. Nevertheless, the effect size of weight loss observed in patients with T2DM is clearly 
clinically relevant. 
For the longer-term studies SURPASS-3 and SURPASS-4, results for the change in percent body weight 
over time had been submitted. Mean percent body weight change seemed to plateau earlier in 
participants with T2DM as compared to those without. While in SURMOUNT-1 body weight reduction 
seemed to be maintained at 72 weeks for the 10 mg and 15 mg tirzepatide doses (this will undergo 
further evaluation when data from the 4-week safety follow-up are available), weight reduction 
plateaued in SURPASS-3 by 52 weeks in all dose groups. Similarly, near plateaus were reached for all 
doses in SURPASS-4 by week 52. Few participants in SURPASS-4 completed the 104 week visit 
(n=176, 10.4%). No further weight loss (and even a slight increase with tirzepatide 10 mg and 15 mg) 
was observed during this longer-term observation.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy  
SURMOUNT-1 demonstrated statistically superior and clinically meaningful weight loss compared with 
placebo in overweight and obese patients without T2DM. The weight loss benefit was supported by 
improvements in other weight related and non-weight related parameters reflecting cardio-metabolic 
health like waist circumference, body fat mass, blood lipids, blood pressure and measures of glycaemic 
control. The patient perspective was taken into account by PRO assessment. Post-hoc analyses from 
the SURPASS studies confirmed the weight loss benefit in patients with T2DM, albeit the weight loss 
and sustainability of action were somewhat less pronounced.  
Overall, tirzepatide is considered a valuable asset for weight management. 
2.5.  Clinical safety  
Introduction 
Data from 25 Phase 1, 2, and 3 studies (submission data cut-off date: 10 June 2022) are included in 
this application for the adult chronic weight management (CWM) indication. The primary safety data 
for tirzepatide (TZP) comes from 2 phase 2 (GPGB, GPGF) and 10 phase 3 studies (global: GPHK, 
GPHN, GPGK, GPGL, GPGH, GPGM, GPGI and GPHO; regional: GPGO, GPGP). Only the data from study 
GPHK (SURMOUNT-1) and GPHN (SURMOUNT-4) are new data specific for this chronic weight 
management application. The SURMOUNT-1 study is completed. The safety data from SURMOUNT-4 
comprise only the initial 36-week open-label period, while the double-blinded treatment is still 
ongoing. Studies GPGK, GPGL, GPGH, GPGM and GPGI were already part of the previous T2DM 
procedure, but a new analysis is now presented for the subgroup of patients with BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2. 
Study GPHO (SURPASS-AP combo) is also a T2DM study, but the results had not yet been submitted in 
the previous T2DM application. From study GPHO, also only safety data for a BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2 are 
included. 
The safety population comprises patients who took at least one dose of study drug. The safety 
assessments were based on all available data through the treatment period and subsequent 4-week 
safety follow-up, regardless of adherence to study drug. The applicant presents four integrated 
analysis sets (Table 40). Due to different dose escalation schemes, the phase 2 and 3 studies were 
analysed separately from each other.

Patient exposure 
In total, 10 065 participants with overweight/obesity received study drug in the 12 phase 2 and 3 
studies. Of these, 7354 participants received TZP in the Phase 2 and 3 studies (AS3C) for 7071 
patient-years (Table 41). A total of 3492 participants received TZP for at least 52 weeks in the phase 
2 and 3 studies, with 2027 receiving TZP for at least 72 weeks. In addition, 2711 participants received 
comparator (active or placebo) for 2905 participant-years. Of the 10 065 participants with 
overweight/obesity, 6744 also had T2DM (TZP_ALL: n=4676 [4167 patient-years]; comparator: 
n=2068 [2142 patient-years]), and 3321 participants had overweight/obesity without T2DM (TZP_ALL: 
n=2678 [2904 patient-years]; comparator; n=643 [763 patient-years]). 
In the phase 2/3 study program (previous T2DM studies and SURMOUNT-1; analysis set AS3C), a total 
of 7354 patients (TZP_ALL group) was exposed to TZP for a mean (SD) exposure time of 50.2 (20.61) 
weeks (min: 1 week, max: 106 weeks; Q1: 39.9 weeks; Q3: 72.0 weeks). An overview of the patient 
numbers and patient-years per time period is shown in Table 41 for analysis set AS3C.

During the primary study period of SURMOUNT-1, the mean treatment exposure was similar across 
treatment groups (placebo: 61.9 weeks; TZP groups: 65.4 to 66.8 weeks). In the integrated 
biopharmaceutic and clinical pharmacology studies, 623 healthy participants, participants with T2DM, 
and participants in special populations (for example, renally or hepatically impaired) received at least 
one dose of either TZP or placebo. Of these, 546 received at least one dose of TZP. 
Adverse events 
Overview 
A  TEAE  (treatment-emergent  adverse  event)  was  defined  as  an  event  first  occurring  or  worsening  in 
severity post-baseline. The maximum severity during the baseline period was used as baseline. Events 
with missing severity during the baseline period were treated as “mild”. Events with a missing severity 
during the post-baseline period were treated as “severe”. Hypoglycaemic events meeting the criteria of 
severe AEs were reported as SAE. Non-severe events were not recorded as TEAEs.

In AS1C (TZP vs. placebo, phase 3; Table 42, upper part), the percentage of patients with TEAEs and 
discontinuations  of  study  treatment  due  to  AE  was  higher  with  TZP  as  compared  to  placebo.  The 
percentage of patients with discontinuations from study due to an AE was similar across all treatment 
groups (TZP dose groups and placebo), with slightly less SAEs in TZP_ALL as compared to placebo. There 
was a weak trend towards fewer deaths in TZP-treated patients as compared to placebo. Similar results 
were obtained in SURMOUNT-1 (Table 42, middle part) and AS4C (TZP_ALL vs. comparator for phase 
2/3 studies; Table 42, lower part).

AEs according to MedDRA Terms 
Except for COVID-19, headache, and nasopharyngitis, the majority of frequently reported TEAEs were 
reported  at  higher  frequency  in  TZP_ALL  as  compared  to  placebo,  specifically  in  the  SOCs 
“Gastrointestinal  disorders”  (TZP_ALL:  54.0%;  placebo:  28.5%)  and  “General  disorders  and 
administration site conditions” (TZP_ALL: 16.6%; placebo: 9.6%). As shown in Table 43, among TEAEs 
occurring  at  ≥5%  in  AS1C,  SURMOUNT-1  and  AS4C,  the  percentage  of  the  gastrointestinal  AEs  like 
nausea,  diarrhoea  and  vomiting  was  higher  in  TZP-treated  patients  than  in  the  control  groups.  TZP-
treated  patients  in  SURMOUNT-1  exhibit  a  higher  incidence  of  nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhoea  and 
constipation than the patients in the corresponding dosing groups of AS1C.

Numerical imbalances disfavouring TZP with regard to less frequent AEs (incidence ≥1% and <5%) in 
safety datasets AS1C, SURMOUNT-1 and AS4C are compiled in Table 44 (limited to those increased 
by  ≥0.2%  in  TZP_ALL  compared  to  placebo).  As  expected,  a  relevant  number  of  AEs  in  the 
gastrointestinal disorders SOC were increased by TZP. Moreover, pancreatic AEs like “lipase increased” 
or “amylase increased” are reported. TZP also increased the frequency of unspecific AEs like dizziness, 
asthenia or fatigue.

Gastrointestinal Adverse Events 
In  the  placebo-controlled  dataset  AS1C,  1581  participants  experienced  TEAEs  in  the  gastrointestinal 
disorders  SOC,  affecting  more  TZP-  than  placebo-treated  subjects  (TZP_ALL:  54.02%;  placebo: 
28.54%). In comparison to placebo, the fraction of  moderate and severe GI  AEs became higher with 
TZP. Accordingly, the fraction of mild GI AEs was reduced in TZP-treated patients (Table 45).

The overall frequency of GI AEs in the overweight/obese population was higher than in the original T2DM 
application  (TZP_ALL:  40.1%;  placebo:  20.4%).  Also,  the  frequency  of  severe/serious  GI  TEAEs  in 
TZP_ALL in dataset AS1C (2.37%) was numerically higher than in the original T2DM placebo-controlled 
analysis  set  (1.1%),  which  is  mainly  driven  by  SURMOUNT-1,  which  accounted  for  59  (TZP_ALL:  52; 
placebo: 7) of the 69 affected patients in AS1C. 
Nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea  
Severity of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea 
AS1C,  AS2C:  The  majority  of  events  of  nausea,  vomiting,  and  diarrhoea  were  mild  to  moderate  in 
severity. Less than 2% of participants in TZP_ALL reported a maximum severity of ‘severe’ for nausea, 
vomiting, or diarrhoea, which is consistent with the data in the original T2DM application. 
Development over time of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea 
AS2C (Phase 3, T2DM programme and SURMOUNT-1): 
Probability of onset appeared highest during the first 4 weeks after TZP treatment start (all on 2.5 mg 
dose) and seemed to decrease in steady state, i.e., after 4 weeks on maintenance dose. The probability 
of onset of nausea and diarrhoea for TZP 10- and 15-mg groups was similar, but higher than for the TZP 
5-mg group. These findings are consistent with the data presented in the original T2DM application. 
Incidence:  The  combined  (Figure  24,  15  mg  TZP  as  example)  and  individual  incidence  of  nausea, 
vomiting, and diarrhoea after initiation of study drug was highest in the TZP 15-mg group, followed by 
Assessment report

TZP 10 mg and TZP 5 mg. This trend was consistent, irrespectively of event severity. Like in the original 
T2DM application, the majority of events occurred during dose-escalation and stabilized over time. At 
any TZP dose, ≤1.6% of patients reported a maximum severity of ‘severe’ in AS2C for the composite of 
nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea during the entire study period.  
Prevalence: The combined (Figure 24, 15 mg TTZP as example) prevalence of nausea, vomiting, and 
diarrhoea after initiation of study drug was highest in the TZP 10-mg group, followed by TZP 15 mg and 
TZP  5  mg.  This  trend  was  mainly  driven  by  the  nausea  component  (increased  with  TZP  10  mg  as 
compared  to  15  mg  and  5  mg).  According  to  the  applicant,  the  secondary  peak  in  the  prevalence  of 
nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea after Week 52 (Figure 24, right graph) is due to SURMOUNT-1, which 
showed  a  higher  prevalence  of  nausea,  vomiting,  and  diarrhoea  as  compared  to  the  T2DM  clinical 
program.  Another  figure  (not  shown  here)  suggests  that,  among  the  individual  components,  this 
secondary peak is most prominent for the AE of nausea.

diarrhoea  by  maximum  severity  in  participants  with  overweight/obesity  in  the  TZP  15  mg  group 
(n=2122) of the AS2C dataset. 
SURMOUNT-1 study: 
To allow a direct comparison with the AS2C dataset discussed in the preceding section, the incidence 
and prevalence of the composite of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea by maximum severity are shown in 
Figure  25  for  the  TZP  15  mg  group  of  SURMOUNT-1.  Incidence  and  prevalence  of  the  composite  of 
nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea are higher in SURMOUNT-1 as compared to AS2C.

Constipation  
Constipation  was  frequently  reported  in  the  TZP  groups  of  the  phase  2/3  studies  (mostly  mild  to 
moderate in severity; more frequently than in original T2DM application). In the phase 3 studies, 0.13 
%  of  TZP-treated  participants  reported  severe  constipation  events  (no  dose  dependency  visible). 
Constipation resulted in study drug discontinuation in 0.09% of the patients. 
Dehydration 
In AS1C, dehydration was reported by 7 participants [placebo: 1 (0.12%); TZP 10 mg: 4 (0.48%), TZP 
15 mg: 2 (0.24%); TZP_ALL: 6 (0.24%)]. All 7 cases (including one severe case) were from SURMOUNT-
1 study. Of the 6 dehydration cases in the TZP group, 2 reported infection shortly before the event, 1 
had chronic kidney disease at baseline, and 3 reported gastrointestinal TEAEs at the time of dehydration. 
None of the dehydration events was serious. 
In  dataset  AS4C  ,  19  subjects  (0.3%)  in  the  TZP_ALL  group  and  6  subjects  (0.2  %)  in  the  pooled 
comparator groups were affected by dehydration. Sub-differentiation according to severity did not reveal 
major group differences (TZP_ALL vs. comparator: moderate: 11 [0.2%] vs. 2 [0.1%]; mild: 6 [0.1%] 
vs.  2  [0.1%],  and  severe:  2  [0.0%]  vs.  2  [0.1%]).  A  total  of  4  (0.06%)  vs.  2  (0.07%)  of  TZP  vs. 
comparator-treated participants reported serious or severe events. 
It is noted that among the AEs associated with discontinuation from TZP treatment (see section below, 
“Discontinuation  due  to  AEs”),  several  PTs  are  listed  that  may  be  related  to  dehydration:  fatigue, 
asthenia, malaise, fall, muscular weakness, orthostatic hypotension, deep vein thrombosis, and vertigo. 
Renal Safety 
In AS1C (Table 46) slightly more patients reported renal TEAEs for TZP_ALL (n=21 [0.84%], 14 from 
SURMOUNT-1) than for placebo (n=4 [0.48%]; 3 from SURMOUNT-1), without TZP dose dependency. 
This is similar to the previous results from the original T2DM application. The frequency of dehydration 
observed  in  TZP-treated  patients  of  AS1C  is  confirmed  in  the  dose  effect  analysis  set  AS2C  (0.91  to 
1.56% in TZP-treated patients). Of note, among 55 (0.87%) participants in AS2C with an event of “Acute 
renal failure”, 13 showed an association with dehydration, vomiting or diarrhoea.

Severity and seriousness: 
7  participants  in  AS1C  (TZP_ALL:  n=6  [0.24%];  placebo:  n=1  [0.12%]),  experienced  ≥1  severe  or 
serious  renal  event.  All  affected  participants  were  from  SURMOUNT-1.  In  the  phase  2/3  comparator-

controlled  analysis  set  (AS4C),  a  total  of  14  (0.22%)  TZP-  vs.  10  (0.37%)  comparator-treated 
participants reported ≥1 serious or severe renal event. 
Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)  
At 40 weeks (primary endpoint for SURPASS-1 and -5), 72 weeks (primary endpoint for SURMOUNT-1) 
and  safety  follow-up,  the  mean  eGFR  reductions  from  baseline  did  not  show  clinically  meaningful 
differences  between  TZP  and  placebo.  The  mean  eGFR  reduction  (in  ml/min/1.73  m2)  was  more 
pronounced after 40 weeks (TZP 5 mg: -2.2; TZP 10 mg: -1.8; TZP 15 mg: -0.5) as compared to 72 
weeks (TZP 5 mg: -0.6; TZP 10 mg: -0.5; TZP 15 mg: 0.6 mg).  
The percentage of patients shifting to lower eGFR categories in AS1C was numerically higher in TZP- as 
compared to placebo-treated patients in AS1C (placebo: 19.3%; TZP: 22.9%). A further differentiation 
of the shifts to lower categories in AS1C is shown in Table 47.

Urine albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) 
In AS1C, mean UACR (% change from baseline) decreased with TZP, while it increased with placebo. 
After 40 weeks (primary endpoint of SURPASS-1 and -5), in comparison to baseline, UACR increased by 
5.5% in the placebo group, but decreased with TZP (5 mg: -14.8%; 10 mg: -25.2%; 15 mg: -15.5%).  
The changes were less pronounced after 72 weeks (primary endpoint for SURMOUNT-1: placebo: +0.2%; 
TZP 5 mg: -8.2%; TZP 10 mg: -9.2%; TZP 15 mg: -6.0%). These observations were confirmed by the 
AS2C dataset (reduction of mean UACR in TZP groups; dose-dependency at 40 and 52 weeks).  
In  AS1C,  fewer  patients  shifted  to  higher  and  more  patients  to  lower  UACR  categories  with  TZP  as 
compared to placebo. This trend was confirmed by the isolated SURMOUNT-1 dataset. 
Metabolic Acidosis 
In the phase 2/3 T2DM programme (AS2C and AS3C, excluding SURMOUNT-1 and -4), three (3) events 
of  metabolic  acidosis  (1 x ketonuria,  1 x ketoacidosis,  and  1 x lactic  acidosis)  occurred.  No  TEAEs  of 
metabolic acidosis were reported in the SURMOUNT-1 study. 
Exocrine Pancreas Safety 
Pancreatitis 
In AS1C, 15 (0.60%) TZP-treated participants with 24 events and 2 (0.24%) placebo-treated participants 
with 2 events of suspected pancreatitis were sent for CEC-adjudication (Table 48). All CEC-confirmed 
cases of acute pancreatitis (TZP_ALL: n=3; Placebo: n=1) in dataset AS1 occurred in the SURMOUNT-1

study. However, the percentage of cases in the group of TZP-treated patients was the same as in the 
placebo group (0.12%).  
In dataset AS4C, 4 events (0.06%; incidence rate [IR] = 0.06) of acute pancreatitis were adjudication-
confirmed for the TZP-ALL group, while 1 event (0.04%; IR = 0.03) was reported for pooled comparator.

AS1C:  
p-amylase was ≤1×ULN at baseline in 88% of the placebo group and in 79.2% of TZP_ALL. The levels 
shifted from ≤1×ULN to higher categories more frequently with TZP than with placebo:

Of the 15 TZP-treated patients, who shifted from baseline p-amylase ≤1×ULN to >3 ×ULN, 1 participant 
(from SURMOUNT-1) had adjudication-confirmed acute pancreatitis.  
Serum lipase was ≤1×ULN at baseline in 89.5% of the placebo group and in 82.0% of TZP-ALL. The 
levels shifted from ≤1×ULN to higher categories more frequently with TZP than with placebo:

Of the 36 TZP-treated patients, who shifted from baseline lipase ≤1×ULN to >3 ×ULN, 2 participants 
(both from SURMOUNT-1) had adjudication-confirmed acute pancreatitis.  
Figure 26 shows the time course for pancreas lipase and p-amylase in the SURMOUNT-1 dataset, which 
constitutes 76.5% of the AS1C dataset. The lipase levels (Figure 26, upper graph) reached a maximum 
at 12 weeks (5 mg and 10 mg) or at 24 weeks (15 mg dose), and remained higher than baseline, even 
at  the  time  of  safety  follow-up.  The  time  course  of  amylase  (Figure  26,  lower  graph)  is  constantly 
slightly increasing in all three TZP dosing groups and also does not reach baseline levels at safety follow-
up. Both lipase and amylase were negligibly affected in the placebo group.

Calcitonin levels 
In  SURMOUNT-1  (GPHK),  17  participants  reported  “blood  calcitonin  increased”  with  no  relevant 
differences between study arms. Nevertheless, as shown in Figure 27, a clear correlation between TZP 
dose  and  percentage  of  calcitonin  increase  (compared  to  baseline)  was  visible.  The  levels  peaked  at 
week 24 in all study arms and slightly decreased until week 72. Nevertheless, at week 72, the percent 
change  from  baseline  was  still  higher  with  TZP  as  compared  to  placebo,  with  a  clearly  visible  dose 
dependency (placebo: 2.8%; TZP 5 mg: 6.9%; TZP 10 mg: 10.5% and TZP 15 mg: 15.2%).

Thyroid malignancies 
In contrast to the previous T2DM procedure, where no thyroid malignancy was reported in phase 2/3, 
the new data show 5 cases of papillary thyroid cancer (for details, see Table 49).

SURMOUNT-1 
Unlike  the  T2DM  studies,  SURMOUNT-1  did  not  include  the  routine  use  of  glucometers  to  capture 
hypoglycaemia  systematically.  Glucometers  were  mainly  provided  to  participants  who  developed 
diabetes  during  the  study,  or  who  reported  symptoms  suggestive  of  hypoglycaemia  requiring  BG 
confirmation.  Participants  who  were  given  glucometers  were  also  provided  diaries  to  record  relevant 
information.  
Severe Hypoglycaemia (severe cognitive impairment requiring assistance of another person to actively 
perform resuscitative actions) 
Of  the  1896  participants  exposed  to  TZP  in  SURMOUNT-1,  one  episode  of  severe  hypoglycaemia  was 
reported by 1 (0.05%) participant in the hospital. The event was associated with multiple organ failure, 
including acute hepatic failure, eventually leading to death. 
Blood glucose <54 mg/dL or severe hypoglycaemia 
In SURMOUNT-1, the percentages and rates of TZP-treated participants reporting hypoglycaemia with 
BG<54 mg/dL or severe hypoglycaemia were low, but higher than in placebo-treated participants (Table 
50).  For  the  majority  (26  of  34  [76%])  of  hypoglycaemic  events  in  TZP-treated  participants  in 
SURMOUNT-1 no symptoms were reported.

TEAEs of hypoglycaemia in AS4C, with severity and seriousness 
Hypoglycaemia was reported in TZP_ALL by 9 (0.14%) patients (severe: n=5; mild: n=4; moderate: 
n=1), and by 13 (0.48%) patients in the pooled comparator group (all events severe). Six (6) events in 
TZP_ALL (0.1%) and 12 events in the pooled comparator group (0.4%) were deemed serious.  
Cardiovascular Safety 
AS1C and AS2C will be discussed, with reference to SURMOUNT-1, where considered necessary. In some 
cases, the applicant has not submitted analyses for AS4C. The results of the ABPM (Ambulatory Blood 
Pressure Monitoring) sub-study in SURMOUNT-1 are provided in the separate section “ABPM sub-study 
in SURMOUNT-1” at the end of this section. 
Blood pressure 
Sitting blood pressure: systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP)  
In AS1C, the baseline values were similar in all treatment groups (placebo, and TZP doses) for both SBP 
(125.4 to 126.2 mmHg) and DBP (79.4 to 80.0 mmHg). Maximal mean decreases were greater with TZP 
than  with  placebo  for  SBP  (TZP:  -7.4  to -9.2 mmHg;  placebo:  -2.1  mmHg)  and  DBP  (TZP -4.5 
to -5.2 mmHg; placebo: -1.7 mmHg). AS2C confirms these observations, but with slightly lower TZP-
induced SBP and DBP reductions. 
Sitting SBP in AS1C was by more than 5 mmHg lower than in the corresponding dataset of the original 
T2DM application, but the range of sitting DBP values was comparable. The maximum mean decreases 
in SBP and DBP were slightly stronger than in the previous T2DM dataset. 
Abnormal blood pressure reductions and hypotension events 
In AS1C, a more patients on TZP as compared to placebo fell into the category of  
-  DBP ≤50 and change from baseline ≤-10 mmHg (TZP_ALL: 20 [0.81%]; placebo: 2 [0.24%]) 
-  SBP ≤90 and change from baseline ≤-20 mmHg (TZP_ALL: 66 [2.67%]; placebo: 2 [0.24%]) 
The  abnormal  blood  pressure  reductions  by  TZP  were  more  pronounced  than  in  the  previous  T2DM 
application.  
A cluster analysis in AS1C for hypotension-related PTs (hypotension, syncope, orthostatic hypotension, 
pre-syncope, blood pressure decreased, and dizziness postural) revealed more TEAEs of hypotension in 
TZP-  than  in  placebo-treated  patients  (TZP_ALL:  62  [2.49%];  placebo:  6  [0.73%]).  The  majority  of 
affected  TZP-treated  patients  was  from  SURMOUNT-1  (52  out  of  62  participants).  Analysis  of  the 
hypotension_narrow cluster (hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, blood pressure decreased) confirmed 
the  above  results  (TZP_ALL:  35  [1.41%];  placebo:  (1  [0.12%].  Again,  the  majority  of  TZP-treated 
participants with events were from SURMOUNT-1 (30 out of 35 participants). 
Severity and seriousness of hypotension events (AS2C) 
Ten (10, 0.16%) participants reported 11 serious or severe events in AS2C (Table 52). It is noted that 
4 of these patients were from SURMOUNT-1 (all randomized to 10 or 15 mg of TZP).

Pulse rate  
In AS1C, baseline mean sitting pulse rate was similar between placebo and TZP (72.3 – 73.4 bpm), but 
increased in all TZP groups at week 4, reaching the maximum value during dose escalation (maximal 
increase  for  TZP:  2.7  –  5.2  bpm;  placebo:  0.8  bpm).  The  mean  pulse  rate  gradually  decreased 
throughout the treatment period. At 72 weeks, the differences from placebo were TZP 5 mg: 0.5 bpm; 
TZP 10 mg: 2.2 bpm, TZP 15 mg: 2.5 bpm. At safety follow-up, the mean pulse rate for all TZP groups 
was by ~2 bpm lower than placebo and baseline. Dataset AS2C confirms these observations.  
The  findings  are  consistent  with  the  observations  in  the  previous  T2DM  application.  In  addition,  an 
analysis of the subpopulation of patients from Japan in AS2C confirms the finding from the original T2DM 
application that TZP induces higher increases in mean pulse in patients from Japan.  
Abnormal pulse rate 
In AS1C, a higher percentage of patients treated with TZP than with placebo met threshold criteria for 
abnormal pulse rate, e.g., for the criterion “change from baseline >20 bpm at any visit” (TZP groups: 
7.48 - 13.21%  vs.  placebo:  4.37%).  The  strongest  effects  were  seen  in  the  TZP  10  mg  and  15  mg 
groups. The difference between the percentages of affected patients in the TZP groups and the placebo 
group were consistent with the original T2DM application. However, the percentage of affected patients 
in the different abnormal pulse rate categories was lower in all treatment groups in the chronic weight 
management application as compared to the original T2DM data. 
The AS2C dataset revealed similar results. The percentage of participants affected by abnormal increases 
in pulse rate was incrementally increasing across TZP doses in almost all of the analysed categories. The 
findings  are  consistent  with  those  observed  in  the  dose-effect  analysis  set  of  the  original  T2DM 
application. 
Electrocardiogram Intervals and Heart Rate 
In analogy to pulse rate, the mean ECG-derived heart rate was increased from baseline with increasing 
TZP  dose  in  AS1C  and  AS2C.  No  other  notable  effects  with  TZP  were  observed  in  the  other  ECG 
parameters (PR interval, QRS interval, QT, QTcF). These results are consistent with those observed in 
the original T2DM application. 
Treatment-emergent arrhythmias and cardiac conduction disorders 
AS1C:  
A  similar  proportion  of  participants  in  TZP_ALL  (3.53%)  and  placebo  (3.26%)  experienced  TEAEs  of 
arrhythmia  and  cardiac  conduction  disorders  in  AS1C,  which  is  consistent  with  the  placebo-controlled 
analysis set in the original T2DM application.  
Seven  (7)  participants  experienced  at  least  1  serious  or  severe  TEAE  of  arrhythmia  and  cardiac 
conduction disorders in AS1C with similar frequency in TZP_ALL (0.20%) and placebo (0.24%). 6 events 
were experienced by 5 TZP-treated participants (3 events in 3 participants from SURMOUNT-1).  
AS2C: 
239 (3.8%) participants across TZP dose groups reported TEAEs of arrhythmia and cardiac conduction 
disorders in AS2C. Of these, 65 were from SURMOUNT-1. As in the original T2DM application, similar

percentages of participants across the TZP dose groups were affected (TZP 5 mg: 89 [4.22%]; TZP 10 
mg: 69 [3.29%]; TZP 15 mg: 81 [3.82%]). 
30  participants  (0.48%)  experienced  serious  or  severe  events  in  AS2C.  Of  these,  3  were  from 
SURMOUNT-1. A total of 6 fatal events occurred in the SURPASS studies. 
Major adverse cardiovascular events (CV safety meta-analysis) 
An external clinical events committee (CEC) adjudicated the MACE events listed in Table 53 in a blinded 
fashion throughout the phase 2 and 3 studies.  
AS1C:  CEC-confirmed  MACE-related  events  occurred  in  23  participants  at  similar  percentages  in  the 
placebo- and TZP_ALL (placebo: 6 [0.73%]; TZP 5 mg: 7 [0.84%]; TZP 10 mg: 8 [0.96%]; TZP 15 mg: 
2 [0.24%]; TZP_ALL: 17 [0.68%]). 9 patients in the TZP group and 5 in the placebo group were from 
SURMOUNT-1. 
AS4C: CEC-confirmed MACE events occurred numerically more frequently with pooled comparator than 
with TZP (TZP_ALL: 100 [1.57%]; comparator: 74 [2.73%]). Details are provided in Table 53.

A  CV  meta-analysis  had  been  previously  performed  for  the  original  T2DM  application.  In  short,  142 
participants experienced the primary endpoint (adjudicated MACE-4: composed of (i) death from CV or 
undetermined causes, (ii) myocardial infarction (iii) stroke, and (iv) hospitalisation for unstable angina 
pectoris)  across  all  seven  Phase  3  clinical  studies  for  T2DM.  Comparison  of  pooled  TZP  vs.  pooled 
comparators revealed a hazard ratio of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.57 to 1.11).  
ABPM (ambulatory blood pressure monitoring) sub-study in SURMOUNT-1 
SURMOUNT-1  included  a  multinational,  blinded  ABPM  sub-study  in  494  participants,  who  received  at 
least 1 dose of study treatment and wore the ABPM device for baseline and post-baseline measurements. 
As shown in Table 54, mean 24-hour SBP decreased from baseline with TZP and increased from baseline 
with placebo. Mean 24-hour DBP decreased from baseline only for TZP 5 mg and 10 mg and was similar 
to  baseline  for  placebo.  Mean  24-hour  pulse  rate  increased  from  baseline  only  for  TZP  15  mg  and 
decreased for placebo.

The  SURMOUNT-1  ABPM  data  were  additionally  analysed  for  treatment-emergent  abnormally  high  BP 
and pulse rate at 36 weeks: 
•  A lower percentage of participants in TZP groups than in the placebo group had abnormally high mean 
daytime SBP, mean nighttime SBP, and mean 24-hour SBP 
•  A lower percentage of participants in the TZP 10 mg group as compared to placebo and the other 
TZP groups had abnormally high mean daytime DBP and mean 24-hour DBP. 
•  Abnormally high mean nighttime DBP was observed in a higher percentage of participants in the 
TZP 15-mg group compared with placebo and other TZP groups. 
•  One participant randomized to TZP 15 mg had abnormally high mean 24-hour pulse rate. 
Amputation or Peripheral Revascularization (only applicable to T2DM studies) 
12  patients  with  overweight/obesity  underwent  amputations  in  phase  3  (TZP:  n=9;  insulin  glargine: 
n=2; insulin degludec: n=1); no case was identified in the phase 2 T2DM studies. 6 of these 12 patients 
had pre-existing peripheral vascular disease and 6 reported tobacco use. Of the 9 TZP-treated patients 
with amputations (5 mg: n=2; 10 mg: n=4; 15 mg: n=3), 6 (0.13%) had an amputation considered 
non-accidental (diabetic foot, peripheral ischemia, infection), b 3 of these 6 patients had pre-existing 
peripheral vascular disease.  
9 patients with overweight/obesity (TZP_ALL: n=6; semaglutide 1 mg: n=1; insulin glargine: n=2) in 
the T2DM studies underwent peripheral revascularization (8 of these had pre-existing peripheral vascular 
disease).

One patient in SURMOUNT-1 reported a severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction, later followed by a 
moderate anaphylactic reaction – please see below, section on “Severe or serious immediate reactions 
(SURMOUNT-1,  AS1C,  AS2C  datasets)”.  None  of  the  participants  reported  serious  immediate 
hypersensitivity reactions. 
AS1C: 
A  higher  proportion  of  participants  in  the  TZP  arms  reported  immediate  hypersensitivity  reactions  as 
compared to placebo (placebo: 3 [0.36%]; TZP 5 mg: 13 [1.56%]; TZP 10 mg: 19 [2.29%]; TZP 15 
mg:  19  [2.29%];  TZP_ALL:  51  [2.05%]).  Of  the  51  affected  TZP-treated  participants,  47  were  from 
SURMOUNT-1  (Table  54).  One  (1)  severe  event  of  hypersensitivity  occurred  in  SURMOUNT-1  (see 
details below). 
AS2C: 
In the phase 3 dose-effect analysis set AS2C, 91 (1.44%) TZP-treated participants reported treatment-
emergent  immediate  hypersensitivity  reactions  with  no  clear  relationship  to  TZP  dose.  The  most 
frequently  reported  events  were  hypersensitivity  (15  [0.24%]),  rash  (11  [0.17%]),  urticaria  (10 
[0.16%]), eczema (8 [0.13%]), injection site rash (8 [0.13%]), and dermatitis (7 [0.11%]). 
No serious event was reported; one (1) severe event of hypersensitivity occurred in SURMOUNT-1 (see 
details  below).  Remaining  events  were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity.  One  participant  (TZP  15  mg) 
discontinued the study drug due to a moderately severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction. 
Severe or serious immediate reactions (SURMOUNT-1, AS1C, AS2C datasets) 
No serious immediate hypersensitivity reactions occurred. 
One severe event was reported (TZP 10 mg): from SURMOUNT-1, female 40-50 year old prediabetes; 
immediate severe hypersensitivity reaction on day 114 (resolved within same day, considered related to 
study drug). Separate anaphylactic reaction reported on day 505 (moderate, not considered related to 
study drug). The participant completed the 72-week treatment period on study drug 3 days later.  
Comparison with previous T2DM data

The difference between TZP_ALL and placebo in the occurrence of immediate hypersensitivity reactions 
was more pronounced in the previous T2DM application as compared to the overweight/obese patients 
(overweight/obese: TZP_ALL, 2.05% vs. placebo, 0.36%; T2DM: TZP_ALL, 0.6% vs. placebo, 0.4%).  
Non-immediate (>24 h after drug administration, but prior to next administration) 
SURMOUNT-1:  
86  participants  experienced  TEAEs  of  potential  (mostly  cutaneous)  non-immediate  hypersensitivity 
reactions  (Table  56),  occurring  more  frequently  with  TZP  (TZP_ALL:  72  [3.80%])  as  compared  to 
placebo (placebo: 14 [2.2%]).

No serious non-immediate hypersensitivity reactions were reported. 
Severe non-immediate hypersensitivity reactions were reported by 2 (0.1%) participants (rash in GPHK 
[TZP 10 mg] and dermatitis in GPHK [TZP 15 mg]. 4 participants discontinued the study drug due to 
non-immediate hypersensitivity reactions. 
Additional hypersensitivity reaction (not identified by pre-specified search criteria):  
One event of leukocytoclastic vasculitis in the lower limbs (TZP 15 mg group) on day 515; patient had 
pharyngotonsilitis on day 510 and was treated with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid from day 512 to 516.  The 
AE was of moderate severity and resolved on Study Day 560.  
AS1C: 
Non-immediate hypersensitivity reactions occurred more frequently in the TZP groups as compared to 
the placebo groups (placebo: 16 [1.93%]; TZP 5 mg: 28 [3.37%]; TZP 10 mg: 26 [3.13%]; TZP 15 mg: 
33 [3.99%]; TZP_ALL: 87 [3.49%]). Of the 87 affected patients, 72 were from SURMOUNT-1.  
No serious event was reported. For the 2 severe events, please see above, SURMOUNT-1 section. The 
remaining  events  were  considered  mild  or  moderate  in  severity.  4  participants  (SURMOUNT-1), 
discontinued the study drug due to non-immediate hypersensitivity reactions. 
AS2C: 
In the phase 3 dose-effect analysis set AS2C, 193 (3.05%) TZP-treated participants reported treatment-
emergent  non-immediate  hypersensitivity  reactions.  A  slight  dose  dependency  was  visible  (5  mg: 
2.70%; 10 mg: 3.05%; 15 mg: 3.39%). Most frequently reported were rash (36 [0.57%]), urticaria (26 
[0.41%]), dermatitis contact (20 [0.32%]), hypersensitivity (19 [0.30%]), rhinitis allergic (17 [0.27%]), 
and eczema (16 [0.25%]).

No serious event was reported. A total of 3 (0.05%) TZP-treated participants (1 per TZP dose group; 2 
from SURMOUNT-1) reported severe non-immediate hypersensitivity reactions (SURMOUNT-1: rash with 
10  mg,  and  dermatitis  with  15  mg;  GPGL:  rhinitis  allergic  with  5  mg).  The  remaining  events  were 
considered  mild  or  moderate  in  severity.  8  TZP-treated  participants  in  AS2C  (4  from  SURMOUNT-1) 
discontinued the study drug due to non-immediate hypersensitivity reactions. 
Comparison with previous T2DM data 
In the overweight/obese patients, non-immediate hypersensitivity reactions occurred more frequently 
than in the previous T2DM dataset, but the % difference between TZP_ALL and placebo was comparable 
(overweight/obese: placebo, 1.93%; TZP_ALL, 3.49%; T2DM: placebo: 1.3%,  TZP_ALL, 2.6%).  
Treatment-emergent  non-immediate  hypersensitivity  reactions  were  reported  more  frequently  in  the 
phase 3 dose-effect analysis set of the current weight reduction application as compared to the previously 
analysed T2DM dataset (3.05% vs. 2.75%).

998 events in 176 (6.9%) participants (154 overlap with MedDRA search above) were retrieved (placebo: 
8 events; TZP groups: 990 events). Most injection site reactions in TZP-treated patients occurred >6 
hours after TZP administration (5 mg: 156 [70.6%]; 10 mg: 300 [71.8%]; 15 mg: 235 [67.0%]).  
From 24 hours to 14 days post-administration, 25.9 to 41.1% of the injection site reactions in the TZP 
groups were reported (5 mg: 82 [37.1%]; 10 mg: 172 [41.1%]; 15 mg: 91 [25.9%]. Most TZP-treated 
patients reported erythema and pruritus, followed by induration, oedema and pain.  
AS1C: 
The  frequency  of  injection  site  reactions  was  higher  with  TZP  than  with  placebo  (TZP_ALL:  7.19%; 
placebo: 1.81%), and the difference between TZP_ALL and placebo was larger than in the original T2DM 
population (previous T2DM data: TZP_ALL: 3.2%; placebo: 0.4%). 
No events were serious, and all were mild or moderate in severity. Regarding the 2 TZP-treated subjects 
who discontinued the study drug, please see preceding section.  
AS2C: 
The percentage of participants reporting treatment-emergent injection site reactions was increased in 
the higher dose groups (5 mg: 3.03%; 10 mg: 5.01%; 15 mg: 5.28%). In most participants, the first 
injection  site  reaction  occurred  during  dose  escalation.  No  events  were  serious,  and  all  were  mild  or 
moderate in severity. 5 (0.08%) TZP-treated participants (including 2 from SURMOUNT-1) discontinued 
study drug due to injection site reactions. 
In the eCRFs, 1775 events were reported in 296 patients (258 overlap with above MedDRA search). The 
number of affected participants was higher with 10 mg and 15 mg of TZP as compared to the 5 mg dose 
(5 mg: 65 [3.08%]; 10 mg: 111 [5.30%]; 15 mg: 120 [5.66%]). Specifically, the percentage of TZP-
treated  participants  reporting  2  to  5  and  >5  events  increased  with  increasing  TZP  dose.  Most  events 
(72.6%) occurred more than 6 hours after study drug administration, with approximately one third of 
events (35.1%) occurring from 24 hours to 14 days after study drug administration. 
Immunogenicity 
A patient was defined as “TE ADA Evaluable” if there is at least one non-missing test result for TZP ADA 
for each of the baseline period and the post-baseline period.  
Definition of ADA+ status:  
•  Treatment-induced: new ADA post-baseline (titer ≥2x minimum required dilution [MRD]) 
•  Treatment-boosted: ADA at least 4-fold increased as compared to baseline 
•  TE  ADA  Inconclusive:  ≥20%  of  the  pre-dose  post-baseline  samples  are  ADA  inconclusive  and  the 
patient is not otherwise TE ADA+.  
Treatment-emergent TZP ADA status 
SURMOUNT-1 
Baseline TE ADA status was comparable across treatment groups, but post-baseline TE ADA+ status was 
considerably  increased  with  TZP  as  compared  to  placebo  (Table  58).  Out  of  2489  TE-ADA  evaluable 
participants, 179 (7.2%) had ADA at baseline (titres from 1:10 to 1:2560; median 1:20). Of the 1858 
TZP-treated TE-ADA evaluable patients, 1226 (66.0%) were treatment-emergent ADA positive, out of 
which  1145  (61.6%)  were  classified  as  treatment-induced,  and  81  (4.4%)  as  treatment-boosted. 
Maximum  titres  for  TZP-treated  TE-ADA-positive  participants  ranged  from  1:20  to  1:20,480  (median 
1:320).

In 43.1 % of the assessed patients, TE ADAs were persistent (ADAs present for ≥16 weeks). Neutralizing 
antibodies against TZP activity on the glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor were 
developed  by  2.2%  of  the  TE  ADA  evaluable  patients,  and  against  TZP  activity  on  the  glucagon-like 
peptide 1 (GLP 1) receptor by 2.4%. Neutralising antibodies against native GIP and GLP 1 were developed 
by 0.8 % and 0.3 %, respectively. 
The percentage of post-baseline TE ADA+ patients in the TZP-treated population was lower in AS2C than 
in SURMOUNT-1 (compare Tables 56 and 57). 
Specific TEAEs by TE ADA 
In the pooled TZP-treated groups of dataset AS2C, the following percentages of TE ADA+ and TE ADA- 
patients experienced hypersensitivity- or injection site reactions: 
•  Hypersensitivity reaction:  
TE ADA+: 170 (4.9%) vs. TE ADA-: 82 (3.0%)   
The 170 TE ADA+ participants with hypersensitivity reactions had ADA titres from 1:20 to 1:10240. 
Out  of  137  TE  ADA+  participants  with  a  maximum  ADA  titre  of  ≥1:5120,  17  experienced  mild  or 
moderate hypersensitivity reactions. No pattern of temporal relationship was observed.  Most events 
were mild or moderate. 3 of the 4 participants with a severe or serious hypersensitivity reaction were 
TE ADA-. One participant from SURMOUNT-1 (TZP 10 mg), who reported severe rash on study day 
80, was TE ADA+ (treatment-induced; peak titre of 1:1280 on study day 84). The TZP-treated patient 
with an anaphylactic reaction (from SURMOUNT-1) was TE ADA-. 
•  Injection site reactions:  
TE ADA+: 256 (7.3%) vs. TE ADA-: 21 (0.8%)  
Assessment report  
EMA/539700/2023  
Page 136/167 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The difference in the percentages of TE ADA+ and TE ADA- patients with injection site reactions is 
larger than in the previous T2DM application (previous data: TE ADA+: 2.32%; TE ADA-: 0.35%). Of 
the 256 affected TE ADA+ participants, the titre ranged from 1:20 to 1:81920 during the treatment 
period. Of 137 TE ADA+ participants with a maximum ADA titre of ≥1:5120, 28 experienced mild or 
moderate injection site reactions (highest titre: 1:81920). No pattern of temporal relationship was 
observed. 38 additional participants with TEAEs of injection site reactions were identified in the eCRF; 
37 of these participants were TE ADA+ (titres 1:20 to 1:20480).  
One participant (TZP 5 mg; from a T2DM study; not captured by MedDRA search for injection site 
reactions) reported moderate cellulitis on study day 107 and a severe SAE of cellulitis at the injection 
site on study day 124 (resolved on study day 148). She was TE ADA+ at study day 84 (treatment-
induced; titre of 1:640) and remained TE ADA+ throughout the study. 
Diabetic Retinopathy Complications (only applicable to T2DM studies) 
21  (0.36%)  TZP-treated  patients  and  6  (0.25 %)  comparator-treated  patients  reported  worsening  of 
fundoscopic examination results (retinopathy eCRF) in the phase 3 studies (SURPASS 1 to 5, SURPASS 
J-Mono, SURPASS J-Combo and SURPASS AP-Combo). 
Search for MedDRA PTs related to diabetic retinopathy complications:  
AS1C: none with TZP vs. 2 (1.09%) patients with placebo (PT of “vision blurred”).  
AS2C (without SURMOUNT-1): TEAE of diabetic retinopathy complications in 34 (0.77%) of TZP-treated 
patients, with similar percentages across dose groups (5 mg: 0.81%; 10 mg: 0.82%; 15 mg: 0.67%). 
Five  patients  (0.11%;  all treated  with  TZP)  experienced  ≥1 serious/severe  TEAE  of  potential  diabetic 
retinopathy  (TZP  5  mg:  2  x  retinal  vein  occlusion;  1  x  retinal  detachment;  TZP  10  mg:  1  x  retinal 
detachment; TZP 15 mg: 1 x macular oedema). 
AS4C: Five (5) TZP-treated (0.11%) and 2 (0.10%) comparator-treated participants reported ≥1 serious 
or severe TEAE of potential diabetic retinopathy. 
Hepatobiliary Disorders 
Hepatobiliary events 
General comment: The most frequently reported hepatobiliary TEAEs in SURMOUNT-1, AS1C and AS2C 
pertained to increases of various hepatic enzymes and to the PT “hepatic steatosis”. 
-  SURMOUNT-1:  52  (2.0%)  patients  with  hepatic  TEAEs;  similar  frequency  across  treatment  groups 
(placebo: 2.2%; TZP groups: 1.7% - 2.4%) 
-  AS1C:  72  (2.17%)  participants  with  hepatic  TEAEs;  similar  frequency  across  treatment  groups 
(placebo: 2.06%; TZP groups: 1.57% to 2.16%). To these 72 participants, SURMOUNT-1 contributed 
38 TZP- and 14 placebo-treated patients.  
-  AS2C:  151  (2.39%)  TZP-treated  participants  (38  from  SURMOUNT-1)  experienced  hepatic  TEAEs; 
similar frequency across TZP groups (2.24% to 2.59%). 
Severe or serious hepatic events (AESI): 
-  SURMOUNT-1/AS1C: 4 patients in AS1C (all TZP-treated and from SURMOUNT-1) reported serious or 
severe events of transaminases increased, hepatic failure, aspartate aminotransferase increased, or 
liver function test increased. 
-  AS4C: 7 (0.11%) TZP-treated patients in AS4C (4 from SURMOUNT-1), and 2 (0.07%) comparator-
treated patients reported serious or severe events.

Hepatic analytes (ALT, AST, ALP, bilirubin)  
AS1C:  
•  Maximum post-baseline ALT: A higher percentage of TZP- as compared to placebo-treated patients 
was in the categories ≥5 x ULN and ≥10 x ULN (Table 60). SURMOUNT-1 contributed 6 of the 7 TZP-
treated patients in category ≥10 x ULN. In 6 cases, the strong ALT elevation was explained by medical 
reasons (i.e., hepatitis, autoimmune disorder, biliary duct obstruction, cholelithiasis, pancreatitis).  
•  Maximum post-baseline AST: Higher percentages of patients with TZP than with placebo were in the 
categories  ≥3  x  ULN,  ≥5  x  ULN  and  ≥10  x  ULN  (Table  60).  This  imbalance  did  not  occur  in  the 
previous  T2DM  application.  Of  note,  all  5  patients  with  post-baseline  AST ≥10 x ULN  were  from 
SURMOUNT-1,  but  in  most  cases,  a  medical  explanation  was  available  (1 x hepatitis  B; 
1 x cholelithiasis with hepatic steatosis; 2 x vigorous exercise; 1 x isolated elevation). 
•  Maximum post-baseline ALP ≥2 x ULN: An imbalance occurred for TZP_ALL (9 [0.4%]) vs. placebo 
(0). SURMOUNT-1 contributed 8 of the 9 cases in TZP_ALL.    
•  Maximum  post-baseline  bilirubin  ≥2  x  ULN:  Similar  imbalance  as  for  ALP  (TZP_ALL:  9  [0.4%]  vs. 
placebo: 1 [0.1%]). All 9 cases in TZP_ALL were from SURMOUNT-1. 
•  ALT, AST, ALP and bilirubin over time: ALT, AST and ALP decreased from baseline to week 40 and 72 
in each TZP group. This trend was more pronounced with TZP than with placebo.  
At  week  40,  72  and  safety  follow-up,  bilirubin  increased  slightly,  but  more  pronounced  in  TZP-  as 
compared to placebo-treated patients.  
•  TEAEs of hepatic enzyme abnormalities: Most events were from SURMOUNT-1 (39 of 42 TZP-treated 
and 11 of 12 placebo-treated patients). Of the 42 events in TZP-treated participants, 20 (48%) were 
mild, 19 (45%) moderate, and 3 (7%) severe. Of the 12 events in placebo-treated participants, 10 
(83%) were mild and 2 (17%) moderate. 
AS2C: 
AS2C is discussed in the following, as the applicant has not provided the results for dataset AS4C.  
•  Maximum  post-baseline  ALT  and  AST:  No  clear  dose-effect  relationship  (Table  60).  The  absolute 
number of TZP-treated patients with maximum post-baseline ALT or AST levels ≥10 x ULN is almost 
the same as in AS1C, i.e., it can be assumed that these cases mostly come from SURMOUNT-1.  
•  Maximum post-baseline bilirubin ≥2 x ULN: TZP_ALL: 14 (0.2%) - of these, 2 had already values ≥2 
x ULN at baseline.   
•  Maximum post-baseline ALP ≥2 x ULN: TZP_ALL: 20 (0.3%) - of these, 3 had already values ≥2 x 
ULN at baseline.   
•  Development  of  ALT,  AST,  ALP  and  bilirubin  over  time:  In  each  TZP  group,  ALT,  AST  and  ALP 
decreased from baseline to week 40, 52 and 72, with a more pronounced effect in higher dose groups. 
Bilirubin slightly increased in TZP-treated patients as compared to baseline. 
•  TEAEs of hepatic enzyme abnormalities: 85 (1.34%) TZP-treated participants reported a TEAE in the 
Liver-related investigations, signs, and symptoms SMQ (no dose-effect relationship); SURMOUNT-1 
contributed 28 of these cases. No event was serious, but 3 events in SURMOUNT-1 were severe. Four 
(4) participants (2 from SURMOUNT-1) discontinued study drug.

Twelve (12) participants (9 from SURMOUNT-1) had an increase in hepatic enzymes ≥10 x ALT and ≥10 
x  AST.  Three  (3)  of  the  “SURMOUNT-1  cases”  are  listed  above  in  the  section  “Drug-induced  serious 
hepatotoxicity  (eDISH  plot)”.  The  other  6  cases  from  SURMOUNT-1  are  listed  as  follows,  along  with 
potential medical explanations: 
−  TZP 10 mg group; ALT- and AST elevation on day 85; antinuclear antibodies titre (1:40) with speckled 
pattern  on  day  92,  but  no  final  diagnosis    cause  of  ALT/AST  increase  unknown.  Study  drug 
permanently discontinued; ALT, AST, ALP, and total bilirubin back to normal on day 225. 
−  TZP 10 mg group; single isolated ALT/AST increase with unknown cause on day 84; no AEs reported 
around the date of the event; participant completed study on study drug. 
−  TZP 5 mg group; AE of gallstones reported on day 54; cholecystectomy on day 84 (TZP administration 
interrupted; last injection prior to hospitalization on day 78); acute pancreatitis reported on day 88 
(end date: day 95). On day 112, ALT and AST had returned to normal. Study drug reinitiated on day 
117. 
−  TZP 10 mg; ALT/AST elevation on day 337. AE of cholelithiasis on day 337; study drug interrupted 
(last injection on day 351); AE of acute cholecystitis on day 370  cholecystectomy performed. On 
day 389, ALT levels were 122 U/L and AST levels were 98 U/L. During the remainder of the study, 
ALT and AST levels further decreased. Study drug reinitiated on day 395. 
− 
 TZP 5 mg group and TZP 15 mg group: ALT and/or AST elevations were presumably due to vigorous 
physical exercise. 
Gallbladder-related disorders 
SURMOUNT-1: As SURMOUNT-1 constitutes the major part of the AS1C dataset, please see AS1C section 
below. Reference to SURMOUNT-1 is included, where considered appropriate. 
AS1C:  Treatment-emergent  gallbladder  disease  occurred  more  frequently  in  TZP-  as  compared  to 
placebo-treated  patients  (placebo:  8  [0.97%];  TZP_ALL:  40  [1.61%]).  All  affected  placebo-treated 
participants and 37 of the 40 TZP-treated participants were from SURMOUNT-1. The % patients affected 
in  TZP  and  placebo  groups  are  higher  than  in  the  original  T2DM  application  (T2DM:  placebo:  0%; 
TZP_ALL: 0.6%). 
The  most  frequently  reported  events  were  cholelithiasis  (TZP_ALL:  22  [0.88%];  placebo:  6  [0.73%]) 
and cholecystitis (including cholecystitis and acute cholecystitis) (TZP_ALL: 13 [0.52%]; placebo: 0%). 
All cholecystitis-related events occurred in SURMOUNT-1. 
An evaluation of gallbladder-related TEAEs in relation to maximum weight reduction (Table 61) revealed 
a higher incidence of gallbladder-related events with increased weight reduction in the TZP group. This 
trend was also visible with placebo, but only few patients on placebo reached a weight reduction ≥20%.

Abbreviations: n = number of participants in treatment group for each category; m = 
number of participants with at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event; TZP = tirzepatide. 
A  total  of  22  (0.88%)  TZP-treated  participants  and  5  (0.60%)  placebo-treated  participants  reported 
serious  or  severe  gallbladder-related  events  in  AS1C  (most  frequently  with  TZP:  cholelithiasis, 
cholecystitis acute and cholecystitis). All 27 participants with serious or severe gallbladder-related events 
were from SURMOUNT-1. Of these, 20 (0.80%) TZP-treated and 5 (0.60%) placebo-treated participants 
had at least 1 serious gallbladder related TEAE. 
AS4C:  A  total  of  83  (1.30%)  TZP-treated  and  22  (0.81%)  comparator-treated  participants  reported 
TEAEs  of  gallbladder  disease.  Cholecystitis  was  reported  by  32  (0.50%)  TZP-treated  (18  from 
SURMOUNT-1) vs. 9 (0.33%) comparator-treated participants (3 from SURMOUNT-1).  
A total of 36 (0.56%) TZP-treated vs. 10 (0.37%) comparator-treated participants reported serious or 
severe  events  of  gallbladder  disease.  Serious  or  severe  events  of  cholecystitis  were  reported  by  17 
(0.27%)  TZP-treated  (10  from  SURMOUNT-1)  vs.  6  (0.22%)  comparator-treated  patients  (3  from 
SURMOUNT-1).31  of  the  36  participants  with  serious  or  severe  gallbladder  disease  reported  SAEs  of 
cholelithiasis (n=15) or cholecystitis (n=16). 
Malignancy 
SURMOUNT-1 dataset 
Overall,  24  (0.9%)  participants  reported  malignancies  (Table  62);  15  of  these  reported  serious 
malignancies (placebo: 7 [1.1%]; TZP 5 mg: 4 [0.6%]; TZP 10 mg: 1 [0.2%]; TZP 15 mg: 3 [0.5%]). 
There is a slight numerical imbalance disfavouring TZP with regard to malignancies of the skin (basal 
cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, highlighted in Table 62).

Most types of malignancies were reported by only 1 or 2 participants. Only basal cell carcinoma, prostate 
cancer, papillary thyroid cancer, and squamous cell carcinoma were reported by ≥2 TZP-treated patients. 
In the completed Phase 2/3 studies (AS3C), no cases of MTC or C-cell hyperplasia were reported. Table 
63 shows the number of treatment-emergent malignancies according to cancer location. The imbalance 
regarding skin malignancies in SURMOUNT-1 noted in the preceding section) is confirmed.

Two  (2)  cases  of  pancreatic  cancer  were  reported  in  participants  with  overweight/obesity  in  AS4C; 
(SURPASS-1,  TZP;  SURMOUNT-1,  placebo).  One  additional  case  of  pancreatic  cancer  (not  included  in 
above  analysis)  occurred  in  a  patient  with  BMI  <27  kg/m2  (SURPASS-4,  TZP).  In  addition,  a  non-
malignant  pancreatic  cyst  (reported  as  pancreatic  neoplasm)  occurred  in  a  TZP-treated  participant  in 
SURPASS-4.  
Four (4) TZP-treated and 1 placebo-treated participant reported papillary thyroid cancer. 3 of the 4 
affected  TZP-treated  participants  were  from  SURPASS-AP-Combo  and  had  pre-existing  thyroid

Major Depressive Disorder/Suicidal Ideation or Behaviour 
SURMOUNT-1 
Columbia-Suicide severity rating scale (C-SSRS) 
C-SSRS captures occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicidal ideation and/or behavior. Ten categories 
are  assessed  by  Y/N  responses,  yielding  three  possible  composite  endpoints:  “Suicidal  ideation”, 
“Suicidal behavior” and “Suicidal ideation or behavior”. In SURMOUNT-1, 12 (0.6%) TZP- and 6 (0.9%) 
placebo-treated  patients  experienced  suicidal  ideation  events.  Two  (2)  TZP-treated  participants 
experienced suicidal behavior events (2 events per participant). There were no completed suicide events. 
PHQ-9 
PHQ-9  is  a  validated  self-reported  screening  tool  that  assesses  presence  and  intensity  of  depressive 
symptoms in a primary care setting. It uses the 9 DSM IV depression criteria, which are scored from 0 
(not  at  all)  to  3  (nearly  every  day).  The  total  scores  are  categorized  into  “not  depressed”,  “mild”, 
“moderate”, “moderately severe” and “severe”. Table 64 summarizes the changes in PHQ-9 categories 
from baseline to Week 72 in SURMOUNT-1. The majority (>65%) of participants in all groups had PHQ-
9 scores indicative of no depression at baseline. More placebo- than TZP-treated participants moved to 
a higher category, and more TZP-treated than placebo-treated patients moved to a lower category.

AS1C analysis according to severity/seriousness: 
Five (5) (0.20%) TZP-treated patients (all SURMOUNT-1) experienced severe or serious TEAEs of major 
depression disorder or suicidal ideation events in (placebo: 0; TZP 5 mg: 1; TZP 10 mg: 2; TZP 15 mg: 
2).  
According to the vignettes provided by the applicant, one of these cases was related to study drug (TZP 
10 mg group; 2 SAEs of suicide attempt on days 360 and 370; patient was “feeling dissatisfied with her 
body due to weight reduction”). 
AS2C:  
A total of 72 (1.14%) TZP-treated participants reported major depressive disorder or suicidal ideation or 
behavior events. Of these, 42 were from SURMOUNT-1. 
−  For Depression SMQ (excluding suicide and self-injury) – incremental increase visible with TZP dose:  
TZP 5 mg: 19 (0.90%); TZP 10 mg: 22 (1.05%); TZP 15 mg: 27 (1.27%)  
−  For  Suicide/self-injury  (2  participants  from  SURMOUNT-1)  –  incremental  increase  visible  with  TZP 
dose: 
TZP 5 mg: 0; TZP 10 mg: 1 (0.05%); TZP 15 mg: 3 (0.14%) 
AS4C analysis according to severity/seriousness: 
A  total  of  8  (0.13%)  TZP-  vs.  1  (0.04%)  comparator-treated  participants  reported  serious  or  severe 
events. 5 of the affected TZP-treated participants were from SURMOUNT-1. Suicide attempt was reported 
in 3 (0.05%) TZP-treated participants (2 from SURMOUNT-1) vs. 1 (0.04%) in the comparator group. 
Completed suicide (depression suicidal) was reported in 1 TZP-treated participant from the original T2DM 
application. 
Abuse Potential 
Initial screening of the CWM Phase 3 studies suggested minimal to no evidence of abuse potential. A 
search  with  the  narrow  terms  from  the  Drug  Abuse  and  Dependence  SMQ  across  the  phase  2  and  3 
studies revealed 1 TZP-treated participant in SURMOUNT-1 with 1 event (SAE) of the PT substance abuse 
(found unresponsive and transported to the Emergency Department on study day 315; urine drug screen 
positive for cocaine and opiates). 
Deaths and Serious adverse events (SAEs) 
Deaths  
As  shown  in  Table  66,  in  the  obese/overweight  population  of  the  phase  2/3  studies,  72  deaths 
(comparator:  32  out  of  2711  [1.18%];  TZP_ALL:  40  out  of  7354  [0.54%]  were  reported.  Over  half 
(61.11%) of the deaths occurred in SURPASS-4, which was conducted in participants with increased CV 
risk. In SURMOUNT-1, 11 deaths were reported, 7 (0.37%) in TZP-treated patients, and 4 (0.62%) in 
the placebo group.

All deaths in Phase 2 and 3 studies were submitted for adjudication by an external CEC. Causes of the 
adjudicated  events  in  the  TZP  group  were  primarily  CV  in  nature  (mainly  sudden  cardiac  death), 
undetermined, or infection. 
In  TZP-treated  participants,  12  deaths  (3  from  SURMOUNT-1;  1  from  SURMOUNT-4)  were  associated 
with  COVID-19  occurred  and  were  adjudicated  as  infection  (n=7),  undetermined  (n=2),  COVID-19 
infection (n=1), pulmonary death (n=1), and sudden cardiac death (n=1).

Other SAEs 
AS1C: The number of patients with ≥1 SAE was similar across treatment groups (TZP 5 mg: 51 [6.13%]; 
10 mg: 57 [6.87%]; 15 mg: 41 [4.95%] and placebo: 53 [6.41%]). The most common SAEs (≥0.2% in 
TZP_ALL) were in the following SOCs:  
- 
Infections and infestations (mainly COVID-19-related, and appendicitis):  
TZP_ALL: 51 (2.05%) vs. placebo: 15 (1.81%) 
-  Hepatobiliary disorders (mainly cholelithiasis):

Laboratory findings 
Clinical laboratory measurements were performed for haematology, chemistry, urinalysis, and special 
analytes at time points specified in each protocol within the TZP phase 2 and 3 studies. For laboratory 
results associated with special safety topics (renal safety, hepatobiliary safety, exocrine pancreas safety, 
thyroid safety), please see corresponding sections above. 
Haemoglobin 
More  TZP-  than  placebo-treated  participants  shifted  from  normal/high  to  low  haemoglobin  in  AS1C 
(placebo: 7.4%; TZP  5 mg: 13.8%; TZP 10 mg: 13.0%; TZP 15 mg: 14.7%; TZP_ALL: 13.8%). The 
incidence in TZP-treated patients was confirmed in AS2C, but without dose/effect relationship (5 mg: 
13.02%; 10 mg: 13.38%; 15 mg: 13.15%). For TZP-treated participants shifting to low haemoglobin

levels in AS1C, the mean drop in haemoglobin was 1.91 g/dL and the mean and median post-baseline 
haemoglobin levels were 11.17 g/dL and 11.20 g/dL respectively.  
Anaemia 
AS1C:  Anaemia  (cluster)  was  reported  by  43  (1.73%;  33  patients  from  SURMOUNT-1)  TZP-  and  7 
(0.85%) placebo-treated participants. For 40 of these participants, the decrease in haemoglobin from 
baseline ranged from -0.1 to -6.2 g/dL. In 2 of these participants, there was no drop in haemoglobin 
from baseline.  
The SURMOUNT-1 participant, diagnosed with adenocarcinoma and receiving chemotherapy, reported a 
decrease of 7.1 g/dL (from 14.5 g/dL at baseline).  
One  participant  from  study  GPGI  (a  T2DM  study)  experienced  a  severe  event  of  anaemia  (drop  in 
haemoglobin  from  13.7  g/dL at  baseline to  11.4  g/dL on  day  169),  but  comorbidities  and  concurrent 
medications (enoxaparin, clopidogrel) may have acted as confounders. 
AS2C, AS4C: There was no dose effect of TZP on anaemia-related TEAEs (TZP 5 mg: 6 [0.3%]; TZP 
10 mg: 11 [0.5%]; TZP 15 mg: 10 [0.5%]). The comparator-controlled AS4C dataset shows a similar 
incidence rate for TZP_ALL and comparator (TZP_ALL: 100 [1.57%]; comparators: 42 [1.55%]). 
Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic factors 
AS1C: Subgroup-by-treatment interactions for TEAEs occurring in ≥5% of patients were analysed in the 
following  subgroups:  age  (<65  years;  ≥65  years),  sex  (male/female),  race  (Asian,  Black/African 
American,  White,  Other),  baseline  BMI  (<30;  ≥30  to  <35;  ≥35  to  <40;  ≥35  kg/m2),  baseline  eGRF 
(<60; ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2) and ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino; not Hispanic or Latino, not reported).  
The strongest interactions (p<0.10) in AS1C are as follows: 
Sex x 
•  Eructation: significant treatment effect (p<0.05) vs. placebo for all three TZP doses in females, but 
only for TZP 10 mg and 15 mg in males.  
Ethnicity x 
•  Eructation: significant treatment effect (p<0.05) vs. placebo for all three TZP doses in “Not Hispanic 
or Latino” patients, but only for TZP 10 mg and 15 mg in those reporting being “Hispanic or Latino”.  
Age x  
•  Diarrhoea: significant treatment effect (p<0.05) vs. placebo in patients <65 years. Lack of this effect 
in  patients  ≥65  years  may  be  due  to  diarrhoea  reported  in  a  higher-than-expected  percentage  of 
placebo-treated participants but in a lower-than-expected percentage of TZP-treated patients in this 
age group.  
• 
Injection site reaction: significant treatment effect (p<0.05) vs. placebo in patients <65 years. Lack 
of this effect in patients ≥65 years may be due to injection site reactions reported by a higher-than-
expected  percentage  of  placebo-treated  participants  but  a  lower-than-expected  percentage  of  TZP 
5mg and 10 mg-treated patients in this age group. 
eGFR x 
•  Diarrhoea:  significant 
treatment  effect 
(p<0.05)  vs.  placebo 
in  patients  with  eGFR 
≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2, but not for patients with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2.

Lack of this effect in patients with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 may be due to diarrhoea reported by 
a  higher-than-expected  percentage  of  placebo-treated  participants,  but  in  a  lower-than-expected 
percentage of TZP 5 mg and 10 mg-treated patients in this eGFR category. 
No subgroup-by-treatment interaction analysis was presented for the AS4C.

Extrinsic factors 
In general, the percentages of frequently reported TEAEs in TZP-treated participants was comparable 
among  regions.  In  dataset  AS4C,  Asian  patients  (excl.  Japan)  were  more  affected  by  diarrhoea  as 
compared to patients from other regions (TZP_ALL: 33.8% in Asia vs. 11.5 - 19.4% in other regions). 
Asian patients (excl. Japan) also reported more events of decreased appetite (TZP_ALL: 24.3% in Asia 
vs. 7.3 - 11.2% in other regions). Nasopharyngitis occurred more frequently in patients from Japan as 
compared to other regions (TZP_ALL: 14.7% vs. 1.9 - 5.7% in other regions). 
Renal or hepatic insufficiency

Few patients with moderate (n=44) and no patients with severe renal impairment have been included 
in SURMOUNT-1. The wording in section 4.2 of the SmPC applicable to the T2DM indication is limited to 
severe renal impairment and no change is proposed with this variation. Regarding patients with 
hepatic impairment, no new data were provided that would lead to a change of the information in the 
SmPC. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Similar to established GLP1 receptor agonists, TZP delays gastric emptying and intestinal transit time. 
This may result in altered absorption of other orally administered concomitant medications, potentially 
altering  PK  parameters  like  Cmax  and  Tmax.  The  influence  of  TZP  on  gastrointestinal  function  was 
addressed with acetaminophen as a probe to assess gastric emptying in the phase 1 study GBGA (healthy 
participants  and  T2DM  patients)  and  in  study  GPHU  (participants  with  obesity  or  overweight  with  or 
without T2DM).  
In  Study  GPGA,  a  delay  in  gastric  emptying  was  indicated  by  a  decrease  of  acetaminophen  Cmax  and 
Tmax) without altering the extent (total drug amount) absorbed. In Study GPHU, acetaminophen PK was 
impacted in a similar manner, and the effect tachyphylaxed faster in participants with obesity and without 
T2DM compared to participants with obesity and T2DM.  
In addition, the drug-drug interaction study GPGR was conducted to evaluate the interaction of TZP with 
combination oral contraceptives in healthy female subjects. No clinically relevant impact was found. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
SURMOUNT-1 
Permanent discontinuation from study drug due to an AE occurred in 137 (5.4%) participants (placebo: 
21  [3.3%];  TZP  5  mg:  30  [4.8%];  TZP  10  mg:  46  [7.2%];  TZP  15  mg:  40  [6.3%]).  AEs  in  the 
Gastrointestinal disorders SOC were the most common reasons for study drug discontinuation (placebo: 
3 [0.5%]; TZP 5 mg: 12 [1.9%]; TZP 10 mg: 28 [4.4%]; TZP 15 mg: 26 [4.1%]. 
AS1C 
In AS1C, a higher percentage of TZP-treated than placebo-treated patients permanently discontinued 
study drug due to an AE (placebo: 26 [3.14]; TZP 5 mg: 38 [4.57%]; 10 mg: 56 [6.75%]; 15 mg: 54 
[6.52%]).  
This difference was mostly driven by AEs from the SOC gastrointestinal disorders (placebo: 4 [0.48]; 
TZP  5  mg:  17  [2.04%];  10  mg:  37  [4.46%];  15  mg:  36  [4.35%]).  The  percentage  of  participants 
discontinuing TZP due to GI AEs (TZP_ALL: 3.61%) was lower than in the placebo-controlled analysis 
set of the original T2DM application (5.0%). However, the percentage in the placebo groups was similar 
(0.48%  in  CWM  application  vs.  0.4%  in  T2DM  application).  The  most  common  GI  TEAEs  leading  to 
discontinuation were nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting. 
Figure  29  shows  an  incremental  increase  with  regard  to  “Time  to  premature  study  treatment 
discontinuation due to AEs” from placebo to TZP 10 mg; however, there is practically no difference any 
more between TZP 10 mg and 15 mg. About half of the participants discontinued study drug due to AEs 
that occurred during dose escalation.

participants with overweight/obesity (placebo-controlled dataset AS1C) 
AS4C and AS2C 
In  AS4C,  436  (6.8%)  of  TZP-treated  participants  (TZP_ALL)  and  102  (3.8%)  of  comparator-treated 
participants discontinued treatment due to an AE. The difference between the two groups was mainly 
driven by the difference in the SOC “Gastrointestinal Disorders” (TZP_ALL: 229 [3.6%]; comparator: 24 
[0.9%]) and “Investigations” (TZP_ALL: 35 (0.5%); comparator: 6 [0.2%]). In the SOC “Investigations”, 
discontinuations in the TZP-treated patients were mostly due to changes in calcitonin, pancreatic and 
hepatic enzymes or excessive weight loss.  
In  the  following,  other  SOCs  are  listed  with  more  discontinuations  in  the  TZP  arm  as  compared  to 
comparator and with the most important AEs responsible for discontinuation in the TZP-treated patients: 
•  General disorders and administration site conditions: TZP_ALL: 25 (0.4); comparator: 7 (0.3) 
In TZP group mainly fatigue (n=5), asthenia (n=4), injection site reaction (n=4), malaise (n=3) 
•  Metabolism and nutrition disorders: TZP_ALL: 24 (0.4); comparator: 1 (0.0) 
In TZP group mainly decreased appetite (n=21) 
• 
Injury, poisoning and procedural complications: TZP_ALL: 5 (0.1); comparator: 1 (0.0) 
In TZP group (n=1 each): Fall, Multiple injuries, procedural headache, road traffic accident and spinal 
column injury 
•  Hepatobiliary disorders: TZP_ALL: 4 (0.2); comparator: 1 (0.0) 
In TZP group (n=1 each): cholelithiasis, cholestasis, hepatic cirrhosis, hepatic failure 
•  Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: TZP_ALL: 3 (0.0); comparator: 1 (0.0) 
In TZP group (n=1 each): muscular weakness, musculoskeletal pain, myalgia 
•  Psychiatric disorders: TZP_ALL: 3 (0.0); comparator:  2 (0.1) 
In TZP group (n=1 each): depression, mania, suicide attempt 
•  Renal and urinary disorders: TZP_ALL: 3 (0.0); comparator: 1 (0.0)  
In TZP group (n=1 each): chronic kidney disease, end stage renal disease, renal mass 
•  Vascular disorders: TZP_ALL: 3 (0.0); comparator: 0 
In TZP group: orthostatic hypotension (n=2), deep vein thrombosis (n=1)

For AS4C, no Kaplan-Meier Plot was presented for discontinuations. However, the plot for the phase 3 
dose effect analysis set AS2C basically confirms what was already shown above for the AS1C dataset.  
In AS2C, a higher percentage of TZP-treated than placebo-treated patients permanently discontinued 
study drug due to an AE with an incremental increase visible across TZP doses (TZP 5 mg: 116 [5.50%]; 
10 mg: 150 [7.16%]; 15 mg: 156 [7.35%]). Again, the differences were mostly driven by AEs from the 
SOC gastrointestinal disorders (TZP 5 mg: 48 [2.28%]; 10 mg: 80 [3.82%]; 15 mg: 89 [4.19%]).  
60.5% (89 out of the 147) of TZP-treated participants in AS2C who discontinued the study drug due to 
nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea did so prior to reaching their maintenance dose. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety  
10 065 overweight/obese participants (6744 with T2DM) received study drug in 12 phase 2/3 studies 
(TZP:  n=7354).  The  exposure  meets  the  recommendations  in  the  “Note  for  Guidance  on  Population 
Exposure” (CPMP/ICH/375/95), and the safety analysis sets are largely acceptable.  
In general, the safety profile of TZP for weight management appears similar to the effect seen in subjects 
with T2DM in the original TZP application. The percentage of patients with TEAEs and discontinuations 
of  study  treatment  due  to  an  AE  (most  commonly  GI  events)  increased  dose-dependently  with  TZP 
compared to placebo.  
While treatment discontinuations occurred at a comparable frequency with the 10 mg and the 15 mg 
TZP dose, fewer patients on TZP 5 mg discontinued treatment. This suggests that the 5 mg dose is an 
important treatment option for obese/overweight patients who do not tolerate higher dose levels. Slightly 
fewer deaths occurred in TZP- as compared to placebo-treated patients. The frequency of SAEs in the 
SOCs “gastrointestinal disorders” and “hepatobiliary disorders” was higher for TZP than for comparator, 
which is consistent with the known safety profile of GLP-1 receptor agonists. Slightly more AEs occurred 
with  TZP  in  the  SOC  “Psychiatric  disorders”,  which  may  be  relevant  for  the  discussion  of 
depression/suicide-related risk (see below).  
As  in  the  previous  T2DM  procedure,  the  most  common  TEAEs  with  higher  incidence  in  TZP-treated 
patients  were  gastrointestinal  events  (specifically  nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhoea  and  constipation).  GI-
related  TEAEs  mostly  occurred  during  dose  escalation  and  decreased  in  the  maintenance  phase.  The 
incidence  of  gastrointestinal  AEs  in  the  CWM  population  was  considerably  larger  (TZP: 51-56%  vs 
placebo: 29%)  than  in  previous  studies  in  the  T2DM  population  (TZP: 37-44%  vs  placebo: 20%).  In 
contrast to previous studies, a secondary peak in prevalence of GI AEs (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea) 
was seen after week 52 in AS2C, driven by SURMOUNT-1 (WM population). However, discontinuations 
due  to  GI  AEs  were  not  higher  in  the  CWM  population  compared  to  the  original  T2DM  population. 
Constipation was added to the paragraph “Summary of safety profile” in the SmPC, which is considered 
justified. 
The AEs of alopecia, hypotension and dizziness were added to SmPC section 4.8.  
Slightly more renal TEAEs and a trend towards a higher percentage of patients shifting to lower eGFR 
categories were observed for TZP as compared to placebo. However, a direct detrimental effect of TZP 
on kidney function is unlikely, specifically as UACR was reduced with TZP as compared to placebo. Loss 
of fluid, e.g. due to GI AEs, and other confounding factors may have contributed to the renal events. 
The  data  on  patients  with  renal  impairment  are  only  limited.  Thus,  the  applicant  has  provided  an 
additional analysis of AEs by renal function for both the AS2C and the AS4C dataset. It is acknowledged 
Assessment report

that the total number of participants in the eGFR category ≥30 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 is considerably 
lower than in the higher eGFR categories. Moreover, the absolute number of cases within each event is 
relatively low and the 17 PTs, for which the OR increased with decreasing kidney function, do not seem 
to  be  interrelated.  Moreover,  it  is  difficult  to  establish  a  plausible  causal  relationship  with  tirzepatide 
treatment. Based on these considerations, the applicant concluded that the observed increase in OR with 
decreasing kidney function may rather be a chance finding without clinical relevance. The applicant has 
further discussed the SOCs of “Investigations” and “General disorders and administration site conditions” 
that  show  the  most  prominent  increase  of  OR  with  decreasing  renal  function  in  the  AS4C  dataset  in 
participants with baseline BMI ≥27 kg/m2. The applicant noted that among the very heterogeneous PTs 
making up these SOCs, the PT of fatigue is mainly driving the General disorders and administration site 
conditions SOC, which typically occurs with anti-obesity medications and is at the same time increased 
in patients with CKD and during weight loss. Similarly, the applicant points out that the PTs of lipase 
increased  or  blood  creatinine  increased  are  increased  in  later  CKD  stages  due  to  reduced  renal 
elimination, and lipase increased is additionally a typical AE of tirzepatide.  
The applicant’s explanation is acknowledged. However, it should be pointed out that an increase of OR 
with decreasing renal function suggests that participants with later CKD stages are more susceptible for 
these AEs. This is independent of whether these AEs are typical AEs for tirzepatide and/or due to reduced 
kidney function.  
An  increased  susceptibility  of  patients  with  reduced  kidney  function  to  AEs  (including  those  typically 
caused by tirzepatide) is also supported by the analysis of the relative risk in the 15 mg vs. the 5 mg 
treatment group in the different kidney function categories of dataset AS2C.  
Most prominently, the relative risk for Injury, poisoning and procedural complications is increased from 
1.08 at eGFR ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2 to 5.62 at eGFR ≥30 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2. However, this effect is 
not driven by one specific PT, but by an imbalance of 1-2 events vs. 0 events (15 mg vs. 5 mg) in PTs 
like  fall,  ankle  fracture,  muscle  strain,  rib  fracture,  contusion,  head  injury,  hip  fracture,  injury,  joint 
dislocation,  ligament  sprain,  limb  injury  or  lower  limb  fracture.  This  may  indicate  that  patients  with 
advanced CKD may be more prone to falls and associated injuries, possibly due to fatigue and other AEs 
reducing  general  wellbeing  and  interfering  with  muscle  strength,  motor  coordination  or  the  ability  to 
concentrate. However, it also cannot be excluded that the above-mentioned injuries partly belong to the 
same subject, which would considerably reduce the impact of the observed increase in OR in this SOC 
category. 
In summary, it seems that patients with advanced CKD are more susceptible to some AEs as compared 
to patients in higher eGFR categories, but due to the low number of cases and due to the fact that, in 
clinical practice, tirzepatide treatment is likely adjusted to individual tolerability, it is not warranted to 
include an extra warning in the SmPC. The current information in the SmPC (“Experience with the use 
of tirzepatide in patients with severe renal impairment and ESRD is limited. Caution should be exercised 
when  treating  these  patients  with  tirzepatide”)  is  considered  sufficient.  A  widening  of  the  wording  to 
moderate renal impairment is currently not required. 
However,  the  applicant  is  requested  to  further  analyse  the  safety  data  of  tirzepatide  across  eGFR 
categories, when more data become available in clinical studies submitted in the future. 
As  already  known  from  other  GLP-1  agonists  and  from  the  TZP  T2DM  programme,  TZP  leads  to  an 
elevation of the pancreatic enzymes lipase and p-amylase, but there was no clear indication that TZP 
increases the risk of pancreatitis. The percentage of patients with serum lipase shifts from ≤1 x ULN to 
>1 x ULN was considerably lower in the current dataset as compared to the preceding T2DM procedure, 
while no such difference was visible for p-amylase. The applicant was requested to compare the mean 
increases of lipase and p-amylase in the comparator-controlled datasets of the previous T2DM application 
and of the current weight reduction application. The applicant has provided the requested comparison.

There is no clinically relevant difference detectable between the increase of pancreatic enzymes in the 
T2DM- and the CWM population with BMI ≥ 27. 
An analysis of hepatobiliary events showed that 9 of 12 “potentially clinically important” cases with ≥10 
x ALT/AST (including three patients in Hy’s law range) were from SURMOUNT-1. However, 7 of these 
cases could be medically explained by cholelithiasis (4 cases), hepatitis B (1 case) and vigorous physical 
exercise (2 cases). Thus, it is unlikely that TZP induces direct hepatic damage, specifically, as the hepatic 
enzymes tend to decrease over time to a higher extent in TZP- as compared to placebo-treated patients. 
The  observed  enzyme  increases  are  probably  due  to  gallbladder  disease  (mainly  cholelithiasis  and 
cholecystitis),  the  risk  of  which  increases  proportionally  to  weight  reduction.  While  cholelithiasis  is 
already labelled in section 4.8 of the SmPC, the AE of cholecystitis was also added with the frequency 
“uncommon” . 
The TZP-induced increases of blood calcitonin were reversible and mostly not of acute clinical concern, 
but  the  consequences  of a  long-term  stimulation  of  calcitonin  release  are  unclear.  The  current  short-
term data do not report medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or C cell hyperplasia. However, spontaneous 
reporting  of  AEs  and  measurement  of  blood  calcitonin  may  not  be  adequate  to  reliably  detect  C-cell 
hyperplasias. It is noted that 5 cases of papillary thyroid cancer occurred (4 in TZP groups). The evidence 
for  a  causal  relationship  between  tirzepatide  (and  GLP-1  RA  in  general)  and  various  forms  of  thyroid 
cancer is rather weak and currently does not allow a conclusion. Nevertheless, an effect of tirzepatide 
cannot be fully excluded. The applicant’s plan to further evaluate the risk of MTC in 2 post-marketing 
studies (active surveillance program in the US and analysis of real-world data) is therefore appreciated. 
However, it is recommended to focus not only on MTC, but also on other forms of thyroid cancer. 
Hypersensitivity and injection site reactions occurred more frequently than in the T2DM application, and 
were reported more often with TZP than with placebo. However, no serious hypersensitivity reaction was 
reported, and most injection site reactions were mild to moderate in severity. Upon request, the applicant 
provided the underlying pooled analysis of immediate and non-immediate hypersensitivity reactions that 
resulted in the frequencies mentioned in section 4.8 of the SmPC. TZP induced a prominent increase in 
ADA (new data added to SmPC section 4.8), which did not appear to influence TZP PK and efficacy. More 
hypersensitivity and injection site reactions occurred in TE ADA+- as compared to TE ADA- patients. The 
percentage difference between TE ADA+ and TE ADA- patients with injection site reactions was larger 
than in the T2DM application. 
An excessive TZP-associated CV risk had been excluded in the previous T2DM application (hazard ratio 
[HR]: 0.80 [95% CI, 0.57 to 1.11]). This was confirmed by the new MACE data for obese/overweight 
patients. However, the MACE used for the new CV safety analysis contained more than four components, 
and no meta-analysis to calculate hazard ratio and 95% CI for conventional 3-point MACE was provided 
for  the  comparator-controlled  AS4C  dataset;  due  to  the  10-15  year  younger  study  population  in 
SURMOUNT-1 a low number of events is expected. The results from the meta-analysis for MACE-3 in 
dataset AS4C also supported the notion that CV risk is not increased in tirzepatide-treated patients. The 
TZP-induced  decreases  in  SBP  and  DBP  were  more  pronounced,  and  hypotension  was  reported  more 
frequently than in the previous T2DM procedure. An abnormally high mean nighttime DBP was observed 
in  the  TZP  15-mg  group  in  the  SURMOUNT-1  ABPM.  However,  the  clinical  significance  of  the  isolated 
finding  of  increased  nighttime  DBP  with  tirzepatide  15  mg  is  unknown.  On  the  one  hand,  increased 
nighttime  DBP  is  known  to  be  associated  with  an  increased  risk  for  CV  events.  On  the  other  hand, 
tirzepatide causes numerous other, rather beneficial effects like body weight reduction, lower mean 24-
hour  SBP,  reduced  daytime  SBP,  reduced  nighttime  SBP,  and  lower  HbA1c,  and  improved  other  key 
cardiometabolic risk factors, including waist circumference and lipid profile. The CV meta-analysis does 
not suggest an increased CV risk associated with tirzepatide. Further CV data are awaited from the phase 
3 study SURMOUNT-MMO (completion projected for 2027) and the ongoing CV outcome study SURPASS-
CVOT in T2DM patients (completion projected for 2024).

The T2DM-specific AEs of hypoglycaemia and diabetic retinopathy were also analysed in the new weight 
management  dataset.  The  applicant  has  clarified  that  the  hypoglycaemias  of  the  category  ”BG  <54 
mg/dL or severe hypoglycaemia” are not related to the use of glucose-lowering medications in addition 
to  tirzepatide.  The  data  on  worsening  diabetic  retinopathy  are  currently  inconclusive  (phase  3 
programme:  TZP:  0.36%  vs.  comparator:  0.25 %).  The  results  of  the  ongoing  dedicated  addendum 
study to SURPASS-CVOT are needed for a more reliable estimation of the TZP-associated retinopathy 
risk.  
The  general  malignancy  risk  does  not  seem  to  be  increased  with  TZP.    However,  the  applicant  was 
requested to provide Forest Plots summarizing all data on the occurrence of various kinds of tumours in 
the TZP- and comparator groups. Across all analysed datasets, tumours affecting breast, gastrointestinal 
system, kidneys and skin were observed with an OR>1.00, i.e, they showed a tendency to be increased 
in the tirzepatide-treated patients. The most prominent increase in risk was observed for skin tumours 
in the analyses regarding the AS4C dataset. When only the phase 2/3 T2DM studies of the original T2DM 
application  were  analysed,  the  most  prominent  increases  in  risk  were  observed  for  tumours  of  the 
gastrointestinal system and of the kidneys. However, it is also noted that the 95% CI are very wide and 
in none of the tumour types with OR>1.00, the lower limit of the CI was >1.00. More data have to be 
collected to allow a final decision on whether the risk for certain tumours may be increased by tirzepatide. 
Thus, the Forest Plots should be amended, whenever new data become available.  
Massive weight loss may be associated with negative emotional effects. On the one hand, there was a 
suicide attempt in a patient which was considered related to TZP-induced weight reduction, and more 
TZP- than comparator–treated patients reported severe or serious TEAEs of major depression or suicidal 
ideation. On the other hand, patient-reported outcomes (C-SSRS, PHQ-9) from SURMOUNT-1 suggest a 
trend  towards  emotional  improvement  with  TZP.  However,  SURMOUNT-1  and  -4  did  not  enroll 
participants with significant active or unstable depression, a PHQ-9 score ≥15 or a lifetime history of 
suicide attempt, and this pre-selection may have influenced the C-SSRS- and PHQ-9 data. Thus, these 
studies  probably  do  not  represent  clinical  reality,  where  active  depression  may  be  more  common  in 
obese/overweight  patients.  The  applicant  submitted  an  analysis  for  the  AS4C  dataset  to  obtain 
information  on  the  incidence  of  all  depression-related  events  in  the  pooled  comparator  groups 
(Depression SMQ, excluding suicide and self-injury and events of suicide/self-injury) and discussed the 
potential relationship to TZP. The available data suggest no difference in the percentage of participants 
reporting  major  depressive  disorder  or  suicidal  ideation  in  AS4C  (TZP_ALL:  1.15%;  comp.:  1.44%). 
Similarly,  no  difference  was  visible  for  individual  SMQs  of  Depression  (excl.  suicide  and  self-injury) 
(TZP_ALL: 1.08%; comp.: 1.40%), or suicide/self-injury (TZP_ALL: 0.06%; comp.: 0.07%). Thus, the 
current results do not suggest an increased risk of depression and suicidality. The applicant states that 
all 4 cases under the suicide/self-injury SMQ reported with tirzepatide were confounded by pre-existing 
mental health issues. However, from the viewpoint of the CHMP, subjects with pre-existing mental health 
issues  may  even  be  more  susceptible  for  potential  negative  effects  of  tirzepatide.  Moreover,  it  is 
reminded that 8 (0.13%) TZP- vs. 1 (0.04%) comparator-treated participants reported at least 1 serious 
or  severe  AE  of  major  depressive  disorder/suicidal  ideation  or  behaviour  in  the  Phase  2  and  3 
comparator-controlled studies. Thus, although no need for action as regards the product information is 
currently seen, the risk for depressive disorders is going to be further evaluated, when new study results 
with tirzepatide in the CWM indication are submitted post-marketing.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety  
The  safety  profile  in  the  new  non-diabetic  obese/overweight  population  confirms  the  profile  from  the 
previous T2DM application. The new population seems to be more susceptible to certain AEs (e.g., GI 
TEAEs). Four new AEs (alopecia, dizziness, cholecystitis and hypotension) were added to section 4.8 of 
Assessment report  
EMA/539700/2023  
Page 154/167 
 
 
 
the SmPC. In addition, the AE of cholecystitis and the slight imbalance in level 2/3 hypoglycaemia for 
TZP vs. placebo has also been adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Some AEs may be related to weight reduction (e.g., gallbladder disease or alopecia). The question, 
whether TZP may increase the risk for depression and suicidality or of certain malignancies requires 
additional data analyses. Finally, data from ongoing studies have to be awaited to arrive at reliable 
conclusions regarding the risks for worsening of diabetic retinopathy and CV events.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan  
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version 2.1 with this application. The (main) proposed RMP 
changes were the following: 
• 
A proposed new indication of chronic weight management (CWM) is included along with 
relevant information on incidence, prevalence, demography, main existing treatment options, natural 
history of the indicated condition, and important comorbidities.  
• 
Updated overall cumulative exposure in Tirzepatide clinical trial program and exposure in 
special populations. 
• 
Updated information on important potential risks considering the proposed new indication of 
CWM. 
• 
Minor editorial changes have been made. 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 2.1 is acceptable. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 2.1 with the following content: 
The safety concerns, PhV plan and risk minimisation measures already in place for Mounjaro 
(Tirzepatide) have not changed in the updated RMP, which is considered acceptable at this point.  
2.7.  Update of the Product information  
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity 
to introduce minor editorial changes to the PI. 
2.7.1.  User consultation  
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
Assessment report  
EMA/539700/2023  
Page 155/167 
 
 
 
 
 
As the introduced changes are considered to not significantly alter the structure of the Package Leaflet 
and the population who performed the user testing of the SmPC prior to introduction of the CWM 
related changes is similar to the new target population, it is agreed not to perform a new readability 
testing. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context  
With this type II variation the following indication is proposed to be added: 
“…Weight management 
Mounjaro is indicated as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for weight 
management, including weight loss and weight maintenance, in adults with an initial Body Mass Index 
(BMI) of 
• 
• 
≥ 30 kg/m2 (obesity) or 
≥ 27 kg/m2 to <30 kg/m2 (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight related comorbid 
condition (e.g., hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obstructive sleep apnoea, cardiovascular disease, 
prediabetes, or type 2 diabetes mellitus).” 
Tirzepatide is a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 
(GLP-1) receptor agonist which is administered subcutaneously once-weekly. 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition  
Overweight/obesity is defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that impairs health (WHO 
2021). It is a chronic progressive disease caused by disruptions in the normal mechanisms that control 
energy balance.  
In 2016, the World Health Organization reported that more than 1.9 billion adults aged 18 years and 
older (39% of adult population) were living with obesity or overweight based on BMI criteria. Of these, 
over 650 million adults had obesity (WHO 2021).  
Obesity is a risk factor for long-term health consequences, many of which represent the top causes of 
mortality globally (WHO 2020). More than 200 health complications have been associated with obesity, 
including cardiometabolic, inflammatory, degenerative, mechano-physical, neoplastic, and 
psychological conditions (Wilding and Jacob 2021). Obesity significantly impacts patients’ daily 
activities and quality of life (Poon et al. 2022). Obesity is also associated with depression, anxiety, and 
increased suicidality (Luppino et al. 2010; Dutton et al. 2013; Wagner et al. 2013). Recently, studies 
indicated that individuals with obesity were more likely to be hospitalized, require mechanical 
ventilation, and die from COVID-19 than those without obesity (Foo et al. 2021; Gao et al. 2021; 
Smati et al. 2021).  
In 2015, excess body weight accounted for approximately 4 million deaths and 120 million disability-
adjusted life years worldwide (GBD 2015 Obesity Collaborators 2017). Secondary to the emergence of 
multisystem comorbid disease, obesity shortens life expectancy, with Class 3 obesity decreasing life 
expectancy by up to 20 years (OECD 2019; Müller et al. 2022).

3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need  
Patients with obesity or overweight often do not achieve sustainable weight loss with lifestyle therapies 
alone. Lifestyle-based treatment achieves a 10% weight reduction at one year in only some individuals 
(Wing and Hill 2001), and most regain the weight over longer periods of time (Knowler et al. 2009). In 
addition, larger effect sizes of weight loss are often needed for the resolution of obesity-related co-
morbidities (sleep apnoea, osteoarthritis) and reduction of CV mortality (Wing et al. 2011). 
Bariatric surgery is an effective option for substantial and durable weight reduction. However, the risk 
of perioperative and postoperative complications, limited access, and apprehension regarding the 
invasive and permanent nature of the procedure, results in less than 1% of the eligible population 
(based on BMI) receiving bariatric surgery as a treatment for obesity (ASMBS 2021). 
Until recently, anti-obesity medication used in conjunction with behaviour modifications demonstrated 
single digit average percentage body weight reductions. The GLP-1 receptor agonist class has 
demonstrated greater body weight reductions than previous AOMs, with some GLP-1 receptor agonists 
achieving a 12.4% change in baseline body weight compared with placebo (Wilding et al. 2021). 
Tirzepatide addresses an unmet medical need, at least in the subpopulation of obese patients without 
T2DM, as the demonstrated effect size of weight loss approaches that achievable with bariatric surgery 
while being less invasive and risky. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies  
The pivotal phase 3 study mainly supporting this application is the SURMOUNT-1 study. This is a 
placebo-controlled, double-blinded study of the safety and efficacy of tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg QW, 
compared with placebo, when used in conjunction with a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical 
activity for weight management. Participants did not have diabetes and had obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2), 
or overweight (BMI ≥27 kg/m2), the latter with at least one weight-related comorbid condition, for 
example, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, CVD, or obstructive sleep apnoea. 
SURMOUNT-4 is currently ongoing and data from the open-label lead-in period were submitted, which 
are considered to support efficacy. The SURPASS 1-5 studies had been conducted for the T2DM 
indication; subgroup analyses in patients with BMI >27kg/m2 support use in patients with T2DM. 
Key design elements of the studies supporting the CWM indication are summarised in the following

3.2.  Favourable effects  
Results are given for the treatment-regimen estimand. 
SURMOUNT-1 
Tirzepatide treatment led to statistically significant weight reductions across doses. The mean percent 
weight reduction for tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg from baseline to 72 weeks (first component of the 
co-primary endpoint) was 15%, 19.5%, and 20.8%. Weight reduction for placebo was 3.1%. The 
percent change difference in body weight from placebo at 72 weeks were 11.9%, 16.4% and 17.8% 
for tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg, respectively. 
Percent patients with a weight reduction of ≥5% body weight at week 72 (second component of the co-
primary primary endpoint for the 10 mg and 15 mg tirzepatide doses) showed superiority to placebo; 
85.1% on tirzepatide 5 mg, 88.9% on tirzepatide 10 mg, and 90.9% on tirzepatide 15 mg, compared 
to 34.5% on placebo. 
Significantly higher percentages of participants treated with tirzepatide 5, 10, or 15 mg compared with 
placebo achieved the secondary endpoints of ≥10%, ≥15%, and ≥20% body weight reductions at 72 
weeks (percentage of participants with weight reduction ≥10%: tirzepatide 5 mg 68.5%, tirzepatide 10 
mg 78.1%, tirzepatide 15 mg 83.5%, placebo 18.8%; percentage of participants with weight reduction 
≥15%: tirzepatide 5 mg 48.0%, tirzepatide 10 mg 66.6%, tirzepatide 15 mg 70.4%, placebo 8.8%; 
percentage of participants with weight reduction ≥20%: tirzepatide 5 mg 30.0%, tirzepatide 10 mg 
50.1%, tirzepatide 15 mg 56.7%, placebo 3.1%).

Results from the DXA addendum demonstrated that mean percent reduction from baseline in total 
body fat mass was significantly greater for pooled tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg (-33.9%) compared 
with placebo (8.2%). 
Tirzepatide 5mg, 10mg and 15mg each achieved superiority compared with placebo for mean change 
(reduction) in waist circumference at 72 weeks (tirzepatide 5 mg -14.0cm, tirzepatide 10mg -17.7cm, 
tirzepatide 15mg -18.5cm, placebo -4.0cm). 
Pooled tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg achieved superiority compared with placebo on the key secondary 
endpoints of mean change in triglycerides (reduction), mean change in non-HDL-C (reduction), and 
mean change in HDL-C (increase) at 72 weeks. Pooled tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg also significantly 
reduced VLDL-C, LDL-C, total cholesterol, and FFA from baseline compared with placebo at 72 weeks. 
Pooled tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg achieved superiority on the key secondary endpoint of mean 
change in SBP (reduction) compared with placebo at 72 weeks. Pooled tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg 
significantly reduced DBP from baseline compared with placebo at 72 weeks. Pooled tirzepatide 5, 10, 
and 15 mg achieved superiority compared with placebo on the key secondary endpoint of mean change 
(reduction) in fasting insulin at 72 weeks (pooled tirzepatide -5.1 mIU/L, placebo -0.8mIU/L). 
Tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg significantly reduced HbA1c from baseline compared with placebo at 72 
weeks (tirzepatide 5 mg -0.4%, tirzepatide 10 mg -0.4%, tirzepatide -0.4%, placebo -0.1%). Of 1032 
participants with prediabetes at baseline, 893 participants had reverted to normoglycemia at Week 72 
as assessed by FSG, HbA1c, and oral glucose tolerance test, using American Diabetes Association 
guideline criteria (ADA 2019): 
• 
• 
placebo: 167 (61.9% of 270) participants, and 
pooled tirzepatide 5, 10, and 15 mg: 726 (95.3% of 762) participants. 
Pooled tirzepatide 10 and 15 mg achieved superiority on the change from baseline (increase) in the 
generic mean SF-36v2 acute form Physical Functioning domain compared with placebo at 72 weeks 
(pooled tirzepatide increase in score by 3.6; placebo increase in score by 1.7 from baseline values of 
49.5 and 49.6, respectively). For the PRO instrument specific for overweight/obesity, the IWQOL-Lite-
CT, all tirzepatide doses showed numerically greater improvements compared with placebo in IWQOL-
Lite-CT Physical Function composite, Physical composite, Psychosocial composite, and total scores. 
SURMOUNT-4 
At the completion of the 36-week open-label tirzepatide lead-in period of SURMOUNT-4, participants 
treated with tirzepatide reduced body weight from baseline by 20.9%. In addition, the percentages of 
participants achieving body weight reduction targets were:  ≥5% (98.2%), ≥10% (93.1%), ≥15% 
(78.7%), or ≥20% (57.0%) by the end of the 36 week tirzepatide lead-in period. 
Subgroup analysis of SURPASS 1-5 
All tirzepatide doses led to reductions in body weight. The mean percent change in body weight for 
tirzepatide-treated participants ranged from -5.8% to -12.2%. 
Tirzepatide demonstrated body weight loss >5% from baseline weight in all studies compared with 
placebo, semaglutide and basal insulin (insulin degludec and insulin glargine): tirzepatide 5 mg: -5.4 
kg (Study GPGI, 40 weeks) to -7.6 kg (Study GPGL, 40 weeks), tirzepatide 10 mg: -7.0 kg (Study 
GPGK, 40 weeks) to -9.6 kg (Study GPGH, 52 weeks), and tirzepatide 15 mg: -7.8 kg (Study GPGK, 40 
weeks) to -11.3 kg (Study GPGH, 52 weeks). All three doses of tirzepatide also had numerically higher 
percentages of participants achieving the ≥10%, ≥15%, and ≥20% weight reduction targets compared 
to placebo and T2DM active comparators, with up to 67% of participants achieving ≥10% weight 
reduction, 40% of participants achieving ≥15% weight reduction, 20% of participants achieving ≥20%

weight reduction. Reductions in body weight were observed regardless of concomitant therapy with SU 
or insulin. A reduction of the volume of visceral adipose tissue, and the volume of abdominal 
subcutaneous adipose tissue, as demonstrated in the MRI sub-study, showed that weight loss was 
related to loss of fat mass. Likewise, other cardiometabolic measures (waist circumference, lipid 
parameters, blood pressure, hepatic fat content) improved with tirzepatide. Tirzepatide led to greater 
improvement in PRO scores compared to placebo or active comparator. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects  
There are no uncertainties with respect to the weight loss benefit in the intended target population. 
Sustainability of action needs to be further substantiated upon availability of the randomised 
withdrawal period and the safety follow-up in SURMOUNT-4 and the safety follow-up in SURMOUNT-1. 
The Applicant has committed to submit these data post-marketing as part of a type II variation. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects  
The  safety  profile  in  the  new  obese/overweight  population  largely  confirms  the  safety  data  from  the 
previous T2DM application. The most prominent unfavourable effects are gastrointestinal TEAEs (more 
commonly occurring than in the previous T2DM application) that also represent the most common causes 
for treatment discontinuation. TZP appears to increase the risk of gallbladder events like cholelithiasis 
or cholecystitis (both included in the SmPC with a frequency of “uncommon”), which is probably due to 
the strong weight reduction rather than a direct effect of TZP.  
Consistent with the previous T2DM data, TZP induced a reversible increase of blood calcitonin, but no 
events  of  C  cell  hyperplasia  or  medullary  thyroid  carcinoma  were  reported.  The  current  data  do  not 
suggest an increased risk for pancreatitis. However, as already known from the T2DM application and 
from other GLP-1 agonists, pancreatic enzymes (p-amylase, lipase) are increased by TZP.  
An abnormally high mean nighttime DBP was observed in the TZP 15-mg group of SURMOUNT-1 ABPM. 
However, the current results do not indicate an increased risk of CV events with TZP, which confirms the 
previous analysis in the T2DM dataset.  
New TEAEs (alopecia, hypotension, cholecystitis and dizziness) were identified in the obese/overweight 
population and were added to the SmPC.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects  
For clarification of the influence of TZP on the risk of worsening of diabetic retinopathy and of CV events 
future data are awaited (retinopathy: ongoing dedicated addendum study to SURPASS-CVOT; CV risk: 
studies SURMOUNT-MMO and SURPASS-CVOT).  
Currently,  the  general  malignancy  risk  does  not  seem  to  be  increased  with  TZP.  The  applicant  has 
provided Forest Plots summarizing all data on the occurrence of various kinds of tumours in the TZP- 
and  comparator  groups.  The  long-term  consequences  of  the  TZP-induced  increase  of  blood  calcitonin 
remain unclear. The methodology used by the applicant to detect C-cell hyperplasia (spontaneous AE 
reporting and blood calcitonin measurements) can probably not reliably identify C cell hyperplasias. MTC 
and pancreatic cancer are followed as important potential risks in the RMP. 
As SURMOUNT-1 and -4 did not enroll participants with depression- and suicide-related problems, the 
patient-reported outcomes (CSSR-S, PHQ-9) may be skewed towards emotionally favorable effects of 
TZP.  However,  currently,  there  are no  clear  indications  that  TZP  treatment may  be  associated  with a 
Assessment report

higher risk of depression or suicide. The risk will be re-assessed, when more data become available in 
the future.

Strengths of evidence related to 
benefits 
•  The CWM development 
program included a target 
population that represents the 
intended patient population for 
CWM with tirzepatide  
•  Across studies, 86% to 96% of 
participants completed the 
primary study period, leading to 
limited missing data at the 
primary endpoint visit and 
allowing for robust assessment 
of the study objectives.

Strengths of evidence related to 
risks 
•  The safety profile of TZP was 
characterized in 7354 participants 
with obesity or overweight treated 
with TZP in the Phase 2/3 studies, 
representing 7071.3 patient-years of 
TZP exposure.  
Limitations and uncertainties related 
to risks 
•  Currently, there are no indications 
that TZP treatment may be 
associated with a higher risk of 
depression or suicide. However, it is 
noted that SURMOUNT-1 and -4 did 
not enroll participants with 
depression- and suicide-related 
problems.  
•  Currently, the general malignancy 
risk does not seem to be increased 
with TZP, but the duration of the 
clinical studies does not allow 
identification of long-latency events, 
such as malignant neoplasms. MTC 
and pancreatic cancer are followed 
as important potential risks in the 
RMP.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion  
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Importance of favourable effects 
The most important benefit of tirzepatide is the clinically meaningful weight reduction demonstrated in 
SURMOUNT-1. The effect size is considered large with considerable proportions of patients achieving a 
weight reduction target of ≥20% body weight. This magnitude of weight reduction approaches that 
seen with bariatric surgery. The reduction in fat mass was about three times greater than the 
reduction in lean mass, resulting in improved body composition.  
Other important benefits are clinically meaningful improvements in lipid parameters, blood pressure 
and measures of glycaemic control. In addition to reductions in HbA1c, the vast majority of patients 
with prediabetes at baseline treated with tirzepatide reverted to normoglycemia. An additional benefit 
is a modest improvement in generic and disease-specific PRO measures, most prominent for physical 
functioning. These key benefits have likewise been shown for patients with T2DM in subgroup analyses 
of the SURPASS studies. 
The evidence of efficacy was considered statistically convincing and there is good concordance among 
efficacy endpoints and among subgroups, underlining the robustness of the results.  
Importance of unfavourable effects 
Assessment report  
EMA/539700/2023  
Page 165/167 
 
 
 
 
 
Highest importance:  
•  Elevated pancreatic enzymes 
•  Depression: may have serious consequences, e.g. suicidality. Relationship to TZP unclear. 
•  Cholelithiasis: it is known that rapid weight loss can trigger gallstones for the same reasons as obesity 
—  it  alters  the  balance  of  cholesterol,  lecithin,  and  bile  acids,  and  prevents  the  gallbladder  from 
emptying adequately; although mostly not life threatening, it may require cholecystectomy. 
Minor importance: 
•  Gastrointestinal TEAEs: mostly occurring temporarily, and can be controlled by dose adjustment 
• 
Increase in serum calcitonin: reversible and mostly without clinical relevance; however, long-term 
consequences are unclear. 
•  TZP-associated increase in nighttime DBP, TZP effects on blood pressure and heart rate: the effect 
on nighttime DBP was only an isolated finding with TZP 15 mg, and the effect on heart rate is well-
known from other GLP1 receptor agonists; both effects are of minor importance, as, in general, no 
increased risk for CV events was identified to date (meta-analysis for MACE-3 in dataset AS4C). 
• 
Increase in pancreatic enzymes: not associated with pancreatitis in most of the cases and well known 
from established GLP1 receptor agonists. 
•  Hypersensitivity- and injection site reactions: mostly not serious or severe, and self-limiting.  
•  Hypotension, dizziness, alopecia: of minor importance, as long, as these AEs are reversible or can be 
controlled by dose reduction. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks  
The key benefit of TZP is pronounced weight reduction accompanied by improvements in 
cardiometabolic parameters. The risk profile of TZP in overweight/obese subjects appears overall 
similar to that in patients with T2DM and therefore is generally acceptable. The benefits of TZP are 
therefore considered to outweigh its risks.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance  
None. 
3.8.  Conclusions  
The overall B/R of Mounjaro is positive. 
4.  Recommendations  
Outcome

of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of indication to include weight management, including weight loss and weight maintenance, 
for MOUNJARO, as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity in adults with an 
initial body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 30 kg/m2 (obesity), or ≥ 27 kg/m2 to < 30 kg/m2 (overweight) in 
the presence of at least one weight-related comorbid condition, based on a global, pivotal phase 3 
study I8F-MC-GPHK (SURMOUNT-1) and five supportive phase 3 studies (SURPASS-1 to -5) in 
participants with T2DM and BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2. SURMOUNT-1 is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide once weekly in participants 
without type 2 diabetes who have obesity or are overweight with weight related comorbidities. As a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated 
in accordance. Version 2.1 of the RMP has also been submitted. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes to the PI. 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Additional market protection 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers that the new therapeutic indication 
brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies and bariatric surgery (see 
appendix 1). 
5.  EPAR changes  
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR 
module 8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

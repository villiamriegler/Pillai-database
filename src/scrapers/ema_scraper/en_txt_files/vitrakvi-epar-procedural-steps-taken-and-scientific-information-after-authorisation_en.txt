SmPC in order to update the efficacy data and the

patients in the pivotal trials (20289 and 20290) for Vitrakvi, 
list of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) based on 
interim results from studies 20289 and 20290. In 
addition, the MAH revised the posology 
recommendations in patients with liver function 
the efficacy and safety data has been updated in its SmPC 
(new data cut off 20 July 2022). In the updated efficacy 
analysis, the overall rate response (ORR) of larotrectinib in 
solid tumours (N=313) is 61%, consistent with what was 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

abnormalities and amended an existing warning on 
hepatotoxicity, updated information on drug-drug 
interaction regarding the effects of CYP3A inhibitors 
and inducers and P-gp inducers. The Package Leaflet 
is updated accordingly. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
previously reported (N=225; ORR 65%). The subset of 
patients with primary CNS tumours now consists of 41 
patients. 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated based on data 
from the new data cut off. Among patients exposed to 
larotrectinib (N=418), eight patients fulfilled the criteria for 
drug-induced liver injury (DILI). As a consequence, the 
term ‘liver injury’ has been added as an ADR in section 4.8 
of the SmPC. The warning on ‘transaminase elevations’ in 
section 4.4 of the SmPC was revised to use the term 
‘hepatotoxicity’ in order to reflect more precisely the nature 
of the reported cases. In addition, section 4.2 of the SmPC 
has been updated to remind physicians to frequently 
monitor liver function of patients after observing 
abnormalities in liver function tests, and provide them with 
guidance on the management of dose reductions and dose 
interruptions.

Annex II 
The CHMP, having reviewed the available information on 
the status of the fulfilment of Specific Obligations and 
having confirmed the positive benefit risk balance, is of the 
opinion that the quality, safety and efficacy of this 
medicinal product continue to be adequately and 
sufficiently demonstrated and therefore recommends the 
renewal of the conditional MA for VITRAKVI, subject to the 
Specific Obligations and Conditions as laid down in Annex II 
to the opinion.

to the opinion 
pharmacokinetic (PopPk) model based on additional 
PK sampling in patients aged 1 month to 6 years 
from study LOXO-TRK-15003 (SCOUT) imposed as a 
specific obligation (SOB). The MAH is also proposing 
to delete this SOB from Annex II. The MAH took the 
opportunity of this variation to introduce corrections 
to section 4.8 of the SmPC and to Annex II. In 
addition the MAH corrected the name of a local 
representative in the PL.

data 
frequently in patients < 6 years of age. They were reported 
in 67% of patients from birth to < 3 months and in 44% of 
patients ≥ 3 months to < 6 years. Also decreased 
neutrophil count has been reported to have led to study 
drug discontinuation, dose modification and dose 
interruption (see section 4.8 of the SmPC). In addition, the 
section 5.2 of the SmPC was updated to provide further 
information reflecting that exposure (Cmax and AUC on day 
1) in paediatric patients at the recommended dose of 100 
mg/m2 with a maximum of 100 mg BID was higher that in 
adults given the recommended dose of 100 mg BID.

are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

open label study to assess the safety and efficacy of 
subjects who completed ULTIMMA-1 and ULTIMMA-2 and 
continued risankizumab treatment were maintained 
through week 160, with 88% (460/525) achieving PASI 90

opportunity to implement editorial changes to the 
SmPC for all strengths / pharmaceutical forms. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
For subjects exposed to long term treatment of 
risankizumab (up to 204 weeks in the extension study), the 
immunogenicity profile observed was consistent compared 
to the first 52 weeks of treatment. 
The safety profile of risankizumab with more than 5 years 
of exposure was consistent with the profile observed up to 
16 weeks.

SmPC 
This variation is based on data previously submitted during 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
the initial marketing authorisation and regarding the 
IMMhance study (M15-992): Risankizumab versus placebo 
in a multicenter randomised double-blind study in patients 
with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis evaluating 
the efficacy and safety with randomised withdrawal and re-
treatment. 
 No new clinical data are submitted with this application. 
The change pertains to the addition of information on 
retreatment after withdrawal of risankizumab to the 
summary of the IMMhance clinical study for completeness. 
The new paragraph introduced is described below:  
“Among subjects who achieved a static Physician Global 
Assessment (sPGA) of clear or almost clear at week 28 and 
relapsed to sPGA of moderate or severe following 
withdrawal from risankizumab, 83.7% (128/153) regained 
sPGA of clear or almost clear after 16 weeks of 
retreatment. Loss of sPGA of clear or almost clear as early 
as 12 weeks after withdrawal from risankizumab (one 
missed dose). Of those subjects who were re-randomised 
Page 12/15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to withdraw from treatment, 80.9% (182/225) relapsed 
and the median time to relapse was 295 days. No 
characteristics were identified to predict the time to loss of 
response or likelihood of regaining response at the 
individual patient level." 
In addition, a clarification on the duration of the IMMHANCE 
study after re-randomization is introduced.

4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Juluca is indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults 
who are virologically-suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen for at least 
six months with no history of virological failure and no known or suspected resistance to any non-nucleoside 
reverse transcriptase inhibitor or integrase inhibitor (see section 5.1).  
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Dolutegravir/rilpivirine should be prescribed by physicians experienced in the management of HIV infection. 
Posology 
The recommended dose of Juluca is one tablet once daily. The tablet must be taken with a meal (see section 
5.2).  
Separate preparations of dolutegravir or rilpivirine are available in cases where discontinuation or dose 
adjustment of one of the active substances is indicated (see section 4.5). In these cases the physician should 
refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for these medicinal products. 
Missed doses 
If the patient misses a dose of Juluca, the patient should take the missed dose with a meal as soon as possible, 
providing the next dose is not due within 12 hours. If the next dose is due within 12 hours, the patient should 
not take the missed dose and simply resume the usual dosing schedule. 
If a patient vomits within 4 hours of taking dolutegravir/rilpivirine, another dolutegravir/rilpivirine tablet 
should be taken with a meal. If a patient vomits more than 4 hours after taking dolutegravir/rilpivirine, the 
patient does not need to take another dose of dolutegravir/rilpivirine until the next regularly scheduled dose.

Elderly 
There are limited data available on the use of Juluca in patients aged 65 years and over. There is no evidence 
that elderly patients require a different dose than younger adult patients (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. In patients with severe 
renal impairment or end-stage renal disease, dolutegravir/rilpivirine should be used with caution, as 
rilpivirine plasma concentrations may be increased secondary to renal dysfunction (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). 
No data are available in subjects receiving dialysis although haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis are not 
expected to affect dolutegravir or rilpivirine exposure (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score A or 
B). Dolutegravir/rilpivirine should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment.  No 
data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score C); therefore 
dolutegravir/rilpivirine is not recommended in these patients (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Juluca in children and adolescents aged less than 18 years have not yet been 
established. Currently available data are described in section 5.2, but no recommendation on a posology can 
be made.  
Method of administration 
Oral use 
Juluca must be taken orally, once daily with a meal (see section 5.2). It is recommended that the film-coated 
tablet be swallowed whole with water and not be chewed or crushed. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Co-administration with the following medicinal products: 
- fampridine (also known as dalfampridine);  
- carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin; 
- rifampicin, rifapentine; 
- proton pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole; 
- systemic dexamethasone, except as a single dose treatment; 
- St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with dolutegravir, and were characterised by rash, 
constitutional findings, and sometimes, organ dysfunction, including severe liver reactions. 
dolutegravir/rilpivirine should be discontinued immediately if signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity 
reactions develop (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by raised liver enzymes, 
fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial oedema, 
eosinophilia, angioedema). Clinical status including liver aminotransferases and bilirubin should be 
monitored. Delay in stopping treatment with dolutegravir/rilpivirine after the onset of hypersensitivity may 
result in a life-threatening allergic reaction.  
Weight and metabolic parameters 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
An increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral therapy. Such 
changes may in part be linked to disease control and lifestyle. For lipids and weight, there is in some cases 
evidence for a treatment effect. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to established 
HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. 
Cardiovascular 
At supra-therapeutic doses (75 and 300 mg once daily), rilpivirine has been associated with prolongation of 
the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram (ECG) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1). Rilpivirine at the recommended 
dose of 25 mg once daily is not associated with a clinically relevant effect on QTc. Dolutegravir/rilpivirine 
should be used with caution when co-administered with medicinal products with a known risk of Torsade de 
Pointes. 
Opportunistic infections 
Patients should be advised that dolutegravir/rilpivirine does not cure HIV infection and that they may still 
develop opportunistic infections and other complications of HIV infection. Therefore, patients should remain 
under close clinical observation by physicians experienced in the treatment of these associated HIV diseases. 
Osteonecrosis 
Although the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, biphosphonates, 
alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been 
reported in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to CART. Patients should be 
advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in 
movement. 
Patients with hepatitis B or C 
No clinical data are available in patients with hepatitis B co-infection. Physicians should refer to current 
treatment guidelines for the management of HIV infection in patients co-infected with hepatitis B virus. 
Limited data is available in patients with hepatitis C co-infection. A higher incidence of liver chemistry 
elevations (Grade 1) were observed in patients treated with dolutegravir and rilpivirine co-infected with 
hepatitis C compared to those who were not co-infected. Monitoring of liver function is recommended in 
patients with hepatitis B and/or C co-infection. 
Interactions with other medicinal products 
Dolutegravir/rilpivirine should not be administered with other antiretroviral medicinal products for the 
treatment of HIV (see section 4.5). 
Juluca should not be taken with any other medicinal product containing dolutegravir or rilpivirine, except in 
case of co-administration with rifabutin (see section 4.5). 
H2-receptor antagonists 
Dolutegravir/rilpivirine should not be co-administered at the same time as H2-receptor antagonists. These 
medicinal products are recommended to be administered 12 hours before or 4 hours after 
dolutegravir/rilpivirine (see section 4.5). 
Antacids 
Dolutegravir/rilpivirine should not be co-administered at the same time as antacids. These medicinal 
products are recommended to be administered 6 hours before or 4 hours after dolutegravir/rilpivirine (see 
section 4.5). 
Supplements and multivitamins 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Calcium or iron supplements, or multivitamins should be co-administered at the same time as 
dolutegravir/rilpivirine, with a meal. If calcium or iron supplements, or multivitamins cannot be taken at the 
same time as dolutegravir/rilpivirine, these supplements are recommended to be administered 6 hours before 
or 4 hours after taking dolutegravir/rilpivirine (see section 4.5).  
Metformin 
Dolutegravir increased metformin concentrations. A dose adjustment of metformin should be considered 
when starting and stopping co-administration of dolutegravir/rilpivirine with metformin, to maintain 
glycaemic control (see section 4.5). Metformin is eliminated renally and therefore it is of importance to 
monitor renal function when co-treated with dolutegravir/rilpivirine. This combination may increase the risk 
for lactic acidosis in patients with moderate renal impairment (stage 3a creatinine clearance [CrCl] 45– 59 
mL/min) and a cautious approach is recommended. Reduction of the metformin dose should be highly 
considered.  
Immune Reconstitution Syndrome 
In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination 
antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic 
pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, such 
reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant examples 
are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis jirovecii 
pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary. 
Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to occur 
in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events 
can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 
Excipients  
Juluca contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase 
deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’.  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Juluca is intended for use as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection and should not be 
administered with other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of HIV. Therefore, information 
regarding drug-drug interactions with other antiretroviral medicinal products is not provided. Juluca contains 
dolutegravir and rilpivirine, therefore any interactions identified with these active substances are relevant to 
Juluca. Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
Effect of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir and rilpivirine 
Dolutegravir is eliminated mainly through metabolism by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase 
(UGT)1A1. Dolutegravir is also a substrate of UGT1A3, UGT1A9, cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4, P-
glycoprotein (P-gp), and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP); therefore medicinal products that induce 
those enzymes may decrease dolutegravir plasma concentration and reduce the therapeutic effect of 
dolutegravir (see Table 1). Co-administration of dolutegravir/rilpivirine and other medicinal products that 
inhibit these enzymes may increase dolutegravir plasma concentration (see Table 1). 
The absorption of dolutegravir is reduced by certain anti-acid medicinal products (see Table 1). 
Rilpivirine is primarily metabolised by CYP3A. Medicinal products that induce or inhibit CYP3A may thus 
affect the clearance of rilpivirine (see section 5.2). Co-administration of dolutegravir/rilpivirine with 
medicinal products that induce CYP3A may result in decreased plasma concentrations of rilpivirine, which 
could reduce the therapeutic effect of dolutegravir/rilpivirine (see Table 1). Co-administration of 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dolutegravir/rilpivirine with medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A may result in increased plasma 
concentrations of rilpivirine (see Table 1). In patients with severe renal impairment or end stage renal 
disease, the combination of dolutegravir/rilpivirine with a strong CYP3A inhibitor should only be used if the 
benefit outweighs the risk (see section 4.2). 
Co-administration of dolutegravir/rilpivirine with medicinal products that increase gastric pH may result in 
decreased plasma concentrations of rilpivirine which could potentially reduce the therapeutic effect of 
dolutegravir/rilpivirine. 
Effect of dolutegravir and rilpivirine on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products 
Based on in vivo and/or in vitro data, dolutegravir is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of medicinal 
products that are substrates of any major enzyme or transporter such as CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and P-gp (for 
more information see section 5.2). 
In vitro, dolutegravir inhibited the renal organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) and multidrug and toxin 
extrusion transporter 1 (MATE1). In vivo, a 10-14% decrease of creatinine clearance (secretory fraction is 
dependent on OCT2 and MATE1 transport) was observed in patients. In vivo, dolutegravir may increase 
plasma concentrations of medicinal products in which excretion is dependent upon OCT2 and/or MATE1 
(e.g. fampridine [also known as dalfampridine], metformin) (see Table 1 and sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
In vitro, dolutegravir inhibited the renal uptake transporters, organic anion transporters (OAT)1 and OAT3. 
Based on the lack of effect on the in vivo pharmacokinetics of the OAT substrate tenofovir, in vivo inhibition 
of OAT1 is unlikely. Inhibition of OAT3 has not been studied in vivo. Dolutegravir may increase plasma 
concentrations of medicinal products in which excretion is dependent upon OAT3. 
Rilpivirine 25 mg once daily is not likely to have a clinically relevant effect on the exposure of medicinal 
products metabolised by CYP enzymes. 
Rilpivirine inhibits P-gp in vitro (IC50 is 9.2 μM). In a clinical study, rilpivirine did not significantly affect 
the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. However, it may not be completely excluded that rilpivirine can increase 
the exposure to other medicinal products transported by P-gp that are more sensitive to intestinal P-gp 
inhibition, e.g. dabigatran etexilate. 
Rilpivirine is an in vitro inhibitor of the transporter MATE-2K with an IC50 of < 2.7 nM. The clinical 
implications of this finding are currently unknown.

The combination of dolutegravir/rilpivirine and 
supplements should be used with particular 
caution. Calcium supplements, iron supplements or 
multivitamins should be co-administered at the 
same time as dolutegravir/rilpivirine with a meal. 
If calcium supplements, iron supplements or 
multivitamins cannot be taken at the same time as 
dolutegravir/rilpivirine, these supplements should 
be taken well separated in time from the 
administration of dolutegravir/rilpivirine 
(minimum 6 hours before or 4 hours after). 
No dose adjustment is required. 
Co-administration may cause significant decreases 
in rilpivirine plasma concentrations. This may 
result in loss of therapeutic effect of 
dolutegravir/rilpivirine. Co-administration of 
dolutegravir/rilpivirine with systemic 
dexamethasone is contraindicated (except as a 
single dose) see section 4.3. Alternatives should be 
considered, particularly for long-term use. 
A dose adjustment of metformin should be 
considered when starting and stopping co-
administration of dolutegravir/rilpivirine with 
metformin, to maintain glycaemic control. In 
patients with moderate renal impairment a dose 
adjustment of metformin should be considered 
when co-administered with dolutegravir, because 
of the increased risk for lactic acidosis in patients 
with moderate renal impairment due to increased 
metformin concentration (section 4.4).

The interaction between dolutegravir and/or rilpivirine and the medicinal product was evaluated in a 
clinical study. All other drug-drug interactions shown are predicted.

This interaction study has been performed with a dose higher than the recommended dose for 
rilpivirine assessing the maximal effect on the co-administered medicinal product. 
NA = Not applicable 
QT prolonging medicinal products  
There is limited information available on the potential for a pharmacodynamic interaction between rilpivirine 
and medicinal products that prolong the QTc interval of the ECG. In a study of healthy subjects, 
supratherapeutic doses of rilpivirine (75 mg once daily and 300 mg once daily) have been shown to prolong 
the QTc interval of the ECG (see section 5.1). Dolutegravir/rilpivirine should be used with caution when co-
administered with a medicinal product with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential should be counselled about the potential risk of neural tube defects with 
dolutegravir (a component of Juluca, see below), including consideration of effective contraceptive 
measures. 
If a woman plans pregnancy, the benefits and the risks of continuing treatment with Juluca should be 
discussed with the patient. 
Pregnancy 
Lower exposures of dolutegravir and rilpivirine were observed during pregnancy (see sections 5.1, 5.2). In 
phase 3 studies, lower rilpivirine exposure, similar to that seen during pregnancy, has been associated with 
an increased risk of virological failure. The use of Juluca during pregnancy is not recommended. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The safety and efficacy of a dual regimen has not been studied in pregnancy. 
Human experience from a birth outcome surveillance study in Botswana shows a small increase of neural 
tube defects; 7 cases in 3,591 deliveries (0.19%; 95% CI 0.09%, 0.40%) to mothers taking dolutegravir-
containing regimens at the time of conception compared to 21 cases in 19,361 deliveries (0.11%: 95% CI 
0.07%, 0.17%) to women exposed to non-dolutegravir regimens at the time of conception. 
The incidence of neural tube defects in the general population ranges from 0.5-1 case per 1,000 live births 
(0.05-0.1%). Most neural tube defects occur within the first 4 weeks of embryonic development after 
conception (approximately 6 weeks after the last menstrual period). 
Data analysed from the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry do not indicate an increased risk of major birth 
defects in over 600 women exposed to dolutegravir during pregnancy but are currently insufficient to address 
the risk of neural tube defects. 
In animal reproductive toxicology studies with dolutegravir, no adverse development outcomes, including 
neural tube defects, were identified (see section 5.3).  
More than 1000 outcomes from exposure to dolutegravir during second and third trimester pregnancy 
indicate no evidence of increased risk of foetal/neonatal toxicity.  
Dolutegravir crosses the placenta in humans. In pregnant women living with HIV, the median foetal 
umbilical cord concentration of dolutegravir was approximately 1.3-fold greater compared with the maternal 
peripheral plasma concentration. 
There is insufficient information on the effects of dolutegravir on neonates. 
Animal studies with rilpivirine do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive 
toxicity (see section 5.3).  
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown if rilpivirine is excreted in human milk. Available toxicological data in animals has shown 
excretion of rilpivirine in milk. Dolutegravir is excreted in human milk in small amounts (a median 
dolutegravir breast milk to maternal plasma ratio of 0.033 has been shown). There is insufficent information 
on the effects of dolutegravir in newborns/infants.  
It is recommended that women living with HIV do not breast-feed their infants in order to avoid transmission 
of HIV. 
Fertility 
There are no data on the effects of dolutegravir or rilpivirine on human male or female fertility. Animal 
studies indicate no clinically relevant effects on male or female fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Juluca has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be informed 
that fatigue, dizziness and somnolence have been reported during treatment with the components of Juluca. 
The clinical status of the patient and the adverse reaction profile of Juluca should be borne in mind when 
considering the patient's ability to drive or operate machinery.

The most frequently reported adverse reactions with Juluca (from clinical studies – see section 5.1) were 
diarrhoea (2%) and headache (2%). 
The most severe adverse reaction, related to the treatment with dolutegravir (from pooled Phase IIb and 
Phase III clinical studies), seen in an individual patient, was a hypersensitivity reaction that included rash 
and severe liver effects (see section 4.4). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The sources of information for the safety database include 2 identical, randomised, open-label studies 
SWORD-1 and SWORD-2 (see section 5.1), pooled studies from individual components and post-marketing 
experience. 
The adverse reactions considered at least possibly related to treatment with the components of Juluca from 
clinical studies and post-marketing experience are listed in Table 2 by body system, organ class and 
frequency. Frequencies are defined as very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1 
000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10 000 to <1/1 000), very rare (<1/10 000), not known (cannot be estimated from 
the available data).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Changes in laboratory biochemistries 
Dolutegravir or rilpivirine have been associated with increases in serum creatinine occurring in the first week 
of treatment when administered with other antiretroviral medicinal products. Increases in serum creatinine 
occurred within the first four weeks of treatment with dolutegravir/rilpivirine and remained stable through 
148 weeks. A mean change from baseline of 9.86 µmol/L (SD 10.4 µmol/L) was observed after 148 weeks 
treatment. These changes are related to inhibition of active transport, and are not considered to be clinically 
relevant as they do not reflect a change in glomerular filtration rate. 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Metabolic parameters 
Weight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked 
to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
No specific symptoms or signs have been identified following acute overdose with dolutegravir or rilpivirine 
apart from those listed as adverse reactions. 
Further management should be as clinically indicated or as recommended by the national poisons centre, 
where available. There is no specific treatment for an overdose of dolutegravir/rilpivirine. If overdose occurs, 
the patient should be treated supportively with appropriate monitoring, including monitoring of vital signs 
and ECG (QT interval), as necessary. As dolutegravir and rilpivirine are highly bound to plasma proteins, 
dialysis is unlikely to result in significant removal of the active substances.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, antivirals for treatment of HIV infections, 
combinations. ATC code: J05AR21 
Mechanism of action 
Dolutegravir inhibits HIV integrase by binding to the integrase active site and blocking the strand transfer 
step of retroviral Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) integration which is essential for the HIV replication cycle. 
Rilpivirine is a diarylpyrimidine non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) of HIV-1. 
Rilpivirine activity is mediated by non-competitive inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). 
Rilpivirine does not inhibit the human cellular DNA polymerases α, β and γ. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Antiviral activity in cell culture  
The IC50 for dolutegravir against various laboratory strains using PBMC was 0.5 nM, and when using MT-4 
cells it ranged from 0.7-2 nM. Similar IC50s were seen for clinical isolates without any major difference 
between subtypes; in a panel of 24 HIV-1 isolates of clades A, B, C, D, E, F and G and group O the mean 
IC50 value was 0.2 nM (range 0.02-2.14). The mean IC50 for 3 HIV-2 isolates was 0.18 nM (range 0.09-0.61). 
Rilpivirine exhibited activity against laboratory strains of wild-type HIV-1 in an acutely infected T-cell line 
with a median IC50 value for HIV-1/IIIB of 0.73 nM (0.27 ng/mL). Rilpivirine demonstrated limited in vitro 
activity against HIV-2 with IC50 values ranging from 2 510 to 10 830 nM.  
Rilpivirine also demonstrated antiviral activity against a broad panel of HIV-1 group M (clades A, B, C, D, 
F, G, H) primary isolates with IC50 values ranging from 0.07 to 1.01 nM and group O primary isolates with 
EC50 values ranging from 2.88 to 8.45 nM. 
Effect of human serum and serum proteins  
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In 100% human serum, the dolutegravir mean protein fold shift was 75 fold, resulting in protein adjusted 
IC90 of 0.064 µg/mL.  
A reduction in the antiviral activity of rilpivirine was observed in the presence of 1 mg/mL alpha-1-acid 
glycoprotein, 45 mg/mL human serum albumin, and 50% human serum as demonstrated by median IC50 
rates of 1.8, 39.2 and 18.5, respectively. 
Resistance 
Resistance in vitro  
Serial passage is used to study resistance evolution in vitro. For dolutegravir, when using the laboratory 
strain HIV-1 IIIB during passage over 112 days, mutations selected appeared slowly, with substitutions at 
positions S153Y and F; these mutations were not selected in patients treated with dolutegravir in the clinical 
studies. Using strain NL432, integrase mutations E92Q (fold change [FC] 3) and G193E (FC 3) were 
selected. These mutations have been selected in patients with pre-existing raltegravir resistance and who 
were then treated with dolutegravir (listed as secondary mutations for dolutegravir).  
In further selection experiments using clinical isolates of subtype B, mutation R263K was seen in all five 
isolates (after 20 weeks and onwards). In subtype C (n=2) and A/G (n=2) isolates the integrase substitution 
R263K was selected in one isolate, and G118R in two isolates. R263K was reported from two individual 
patients with subtype B and subtype C in the Phase III clinical program for ART experienced, INI naive 
subjects, but without effects on dolutegravir susceptibility in vitro. G118R lowers the susceptibility to 
dolutegravir in site directed mutants (FC 10), but was not detected in patients receiving dolutegravir in the 
Phase III program.  
Primary mutations for raltegravir/elvitegravir (Q148H/R/K, N155H, Y143R/H/C, E92Q, T66I) do not affect 
the in vitro susceptibility of dolutegravir as single mutations. When mutations listed as secondary integrase 
inhibitor associated mutations (for raltegravir/elvitegravir) are added to primary mutations (excluding at 
Q148) in experiments with site directed mutants, dolutegravir susceptibility remains at or near wildtype 
level. In the case of the Q148-mutation viruses, increasing dolutegravir FC is seen as the number of 
secondary mutations increase. The effect of the Q148-based mutations (H/R/K) was also consistent with in 
vitro passage experiments with site directed mutants. In serial passage with strain NL432-based site directed 
mutants at N155H or E92Q, no further selection of resistance was seen (FC unchanged around 1). In 
contrast, starting passage with mutants with mutation Q148H (FC 1), a variety of raltegravir associated 
secondary mutations accumulated with a consequent increase of FC to values >10.  
A clinically relevant phenotypic cut-off value (FC vs wild type virus) has not been determined; genotypic 
resistance was a better predictor for outcome. 
Rilpivirine-resistant strains were selected in cell culture starting from wild type HIV-1 of different origins 
and clades as well as NNRTI-resistant HIV-1. The most commonly observed amino acid substitutions that 
emerged included: L100I, K101E, V108I, E138K, V179F, Y181C, H221Y, F227C and M230I. Resistance to 
rilpivirine was considered present when FC in EC50 value was above the biological cut-off (BCO) of the 
assay. 
Resistance in vivo  
Through 48 Weeks with comparative data two subjects receiving dolutegravir plus rilpivirine and two 
subjects continuing their current antiretroviral regimen (CAR) experienced confirmed virologic failure 
leading to withdrawal (CVW) criteria across the pooled SWORD-1 (201636) and SWORD-2 (201637) 
studies. Overall eleven subjects receiving dolutegravir plus rilpivirine met CVW through Week 148, see 
Table 3. The NNRTI-associated substitutions E138E/A and M230M/L were detected in three and two 
subjects at time of withdrawal.

In previously untreated patients receiving dolutegravir + 2 NRTIs in Phase IIb and Phase III, no development 
of resistance to the integrase class, or to the NRTI class was seen (n=876, follow-up of 48-96 weeks). 
In patients with prior failed therapies, but naïve to the integrase class (SAILING study), integrase inhibitor 
substitutions were observed in 4/354 patients (follow-up 48 weeks) treated with dolutegravir, which was 
given in combination with an investigator selected background regimen (BR). Of these four, two subjects 
had a unique R263K integrase substitution, with a maximum FC of 1.93, one subject had a polymorphic 
V151V/I integrase substitution, with maximum FC of 0.92, and one subject had pre-existing integrase 
mutations and is assumed to have been integrase inhibitor experienced or infected with integrase inhibitor 
resistant virus by transmission. The R263K mutation was also selected in vitro (see above). 
From rilpivirine Phase IIIstudies, in the week 48 pooled resistance analysis conducted with previously 
untreated patients, 62 (of a total of 72) virologic failures in the rilpivirine arm had resistance data at baseline 
22 
 
  
 
and time of failure. In this analysis, the resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) associated with NNRTI 
resistance that developed in at least 2 rilpivirine virologic failures were: V90I, K101E, E138K, E138Q, 
V179I, Y181C, V189I, H221Y, and F227C. In thestudies, the presence of the mutations V90I and V189I, at 
baseline, did not affect response. The E138K substitution emerged most frequently during rilpivirine 
treatment, commonly in combination with the M184I substitution. In the week 48 analysis, 31 out of 62 of 
rilpivirine virologic failures had concomitant NNRTI and NRTI RAMs; 17 of those 31 had the combination 
of E138K and M184I. The most common mutations were the same in the week 48 and week 96 analyses. 
From the week 48 to the week 96 analysis, 24 (3.5%) and 14 (2.1%) additional virologic failures occurred in 
the rilpivirine and efavirenz arm, respectively.  
Cross-resistance 
Site-directed INI mutant virus 
Dolutegravir activity was determined against a panel of 60 INI-resistant site-directed mutant HIV-1 viruses 
(28 with single substitutions and 32 with 2 or more substitutions). The single INI-resistance substitutions 
T66K, I151L, and S153Y conferred a greater than 2-fold decrease in dolutegravir susceptibility (range: 2.3-
fold to 3.6-fold from reference). Combinations of multiple substitutions T66K/L74M, E92Q/N155H, 
G140C/Q148R, G140S/Q148H, R or K, Q148R/N155H, T97A/G140S/Q148, and substitutions at 
E138/G140/Q148 showed a greater than 2-fold decrease in dolutegravir susceptibility (range: 2.5-fold to 21-
fold from reference). 
Site-directed NNRTI mutant virus 
In a panel of 67 HIV-1 recombinant laboratory strains with one amino acid substitution at RT positions 
associated with NNRTI resistance, including the most commonly found K103N and Y181C, rilpivirine 
showed antiviral activity (FC≤BCO) against 64 (96%) of these strains. The single amino acid substitutions 
associated with a loss of susceptibility to rilpivirine were: K101P, Y181I and Y181V. The K103N 
substitution did not result in reduced susceptibility to rilpivirine by itself, but the combination of K103N and 
L100I resulted in a 7-fold reduced susceptibility to rilpivirine. 
Considering all of the available in vitro and in vivo data, the following amino acid substitutions, when 
present at baseline, are likely to affect the activity of rilpivirine: K101E, K101P, E138A, E138G, E138K, 
E138R, E138Q, V179L, Y181C, Y181I, Y181V, Y188L, H221Y, F227C, M230I or M230L. 
Recombinant clinical isolates 
Seven hundred and five raltegravir resistant isolates from raltegravir experienced patients were analysed for 
susceptibility to dolutegravir. Dolutegravir had a <10 FC against 94% of the 705 clinical isolates. 
Rilpivirine retained sensitivity (FC ≤ BCO) against 62% of 4786 HIV-1 recombinant clinical isolates 
resistant to efavirenz and/or nevirapine. 
Previously untreated HIV-1 infected adult patients 
In a Week 96 pooled analyses of virologic failures with baseline viral load ≤100,000 copies/mL and 
resistance to rilpivirine (n = 5), subjects had cross-resistance to efavirenz (n = 3), etravirine (n = 4), and 
nevirapine (n = 1). 
Effects on electrocardiogram 
The effect of rilpivirine at the recommended dose of 25 mg once daily on the QTcF interval was evaluated in 
a randomised, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily) controlled crossover study in 60 healthy 
adults, with 13 measurements over 24 hours at steady-state. Rilpivirine at the recommended dose of 25 mg 
once daily is not associated with a clinically relevant effect on QTc. 
When supratherapeutic doses of 75 mg once daily and 300 mg once daily of rilpivirine were studied in 
healthy adults, the maximum mean time-matched (95% upper confidence bound) differences in QTcF 
interval from placebo after baseline correction were 10.7 (15.3) and 23.3 (28.4) ms, respectively. Steady-
state administration of rilpivirine 75 mg once daily and 300 mg once daily resulted in a mean Cmax 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
approximately 2.6-fold and 6.7-fold, respectively, higher than the mean steady-state Cmax observed with the 
recommended 25 mg once daily dose of rilpivirine (see section 4.4). 
No relevant effects were seen with dolutegravir on the QTc interval, with doses exceeding the clinical dose 
by approximately three fold.  
Clinical efficacy and safety  
The efficacy and safety of switching from an antiretroviral regimen (containing 2 NRTIs plus either an INI, 
an NNRTI, or a PI) to a dual regimen of dolutegravir 50 mg and rilpivirine 25 mg was evaluated in 2 
identical 148-week, randomised, open-label, multicentre, parallel-group, non-inferiority studies SWORD-1 
(201636) and SWORD-2 (201637). Subjects were enrolled if they were on their first or second antiretroviral 
regimen with no history of virological failure, had no suspected or known resistance to any antiretroviral and 
had been stably suppressed (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) for at least 6 months prior to screening. Subjects 
were randomised 1:1 to continue their CAR or be switched to a two-agent regimen dolutegravir plus 
rilpivirine administered once daily. The primary efficacy endpoint for the SWORD studies was the 
proportion of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL at Week 48 (Snapshot algorithm for the ITT-
E population). 
At baseline, in the pooled analysis, characteristics were similar between treatment arms with the median age 
of subjects of 43 years (28%, 50 years of age or older; 3%, 65 years of age or older), 22% female, 20% non-
white and 77% were CDC Class A. Median CD+cell count was about 600 cells per mm3 with 11% having 
CD4+ cell count less than 350 cells per mm3. In the pooled analysis, 54%, 26%, and 20% of subjects were 
receiving an NNRTI, PI, or INI (respectively) as their baseline third treatment agent class prior to 
randomisation.  
The pooled primary analysis demonstrated that dolutegravir plus rilpivirine is non-inferior to CAR, with 95% 
of subjects in both arms achieving the primary endpoint of <50 copies/mL plasma HIV-1 RNA at Week 48 
based on the Snapshot algorithm (Table 4). 
The primary endpoint and other outcomes (including outcomes by key baseline covariates) for the pooled 
SWORD-1 and SWORD-2 studies are shown in Table 4.

At Week 148 in the pooled SWORD-1 and SWORD-2 studies, 84% of subjects who received dolutegravir 
plus rilpivirine as of study start had plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL based on the Snapshot algorithm. In 
subjects who initially remained on their CAR and switched to dolutegravir plus rilpivirine at Week 52, 90% 
had plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 148 based on the Snapshot algorithm, which was 
comparable to the response rate (89%) observed at Week 100 (similar exposure duration) in subjects 
receiving dolutegravir plus rilpivirine as of study start. 
Effects on bone 
In a DEXA substudy mean bone mineral density (BMD) increased from Baseline to Week 48 in subjects 
who switched to dolutegravir plus rilpivirine (1.34% total hip and 1.46% lumbar spine) compared with those 
who continued on treatment with a TDF-containing antiretroviral regimen (0.05% total hip and 0.15% 
lumbar spine. Any beneficial effect on fracture rate was not studied. 
Pregnancy 
No efficacy and safety data are available for the combination of dolutegravir and rilpivirine in pregnancy. 
Rilpivirine in combination with a background regimen was evaluated in a clinical study of 19 pregnant 
women during the second and third trimesters, and postpartum. The pharmacokinetic data demonstrate that 
total exposure (AUC) to rilpivirine as a part of an antiretroviral regimen was approximately 30% lower 
during pregnancy compared with postpartum (6-12 weeks). Of the 12 subjects that completed the study, 10 
subjects were suppressed at the end of the study; in the other 2 subjects an increase in viral load was 
observed postpartum, for 1 subject due to suspected suboptimal adherence. No mother to child transmission 
occurred in all 10 infants born to the mothers who completed the study and for whom the HIV status was 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
available. There were no new safety findings compared with the known safety profile of rilpivirine in HIV-1 
infected adults.  
In limited data from small numbers of women who received dolutegravir 50 mg once daily in combination 
with a background regimen, the total exposure (AUC) to dolutegravir was 37% lower during the 2nd 
trimester of pregnancy, and 29% lower during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy, compared with postpartum (6-
12 weeks). Of the 29 subjects that completed the study, 27 subjects were suppressed at the end of the study. 
No mother to child transmission was identified. While 24 infants were confirmed to be uninfected, 5 were 
indeterminate due to incomplete testing, see section 5.2.  
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Juluca in 
one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of HIV infection (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use).  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Juluca is bioequivalent to a dolutegravir 50 mg tablet and a rilpivirine 25 mg tablet administered together 
with a meal. 
Dolutegravir pharmacokinetics are similar between healthy and HIV-infected subjects. The PK variability of 
dolutegravir is low to moderate. In Phase I studies in healthy subjects, between-subject CVb% for AUC and 
Cmax ranged from ~20 to 40% and Cτ from 30 to 65% across studies. The between-subject PK variability of 
dolutegravir was higher in HIV-infected subjects than healthy subjects. Within-subject variability (CVw%) is 
lower than between-subject variability. 
The pharmacokinetic properties of rilpivirine have been evaluated in adult healthy subjects and in adult 
antiretroviral treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected patients. Systemic exposure to rilpivirine was generally lower 
in HIV-1 infected patients than in healthy subjects. 
Absorption  
Dolutegravir is rapidly absorbed following oral administration, with median Tmax at 2 to 3 hours post dose for 
tablet formulation. After oral administration, the maximum plasma concentration of rilpivirine is generally 
achieved within 4-5 hours.  
Juluca must be taken with a meal to obtain optimal absorption of rilpivirine (see section 4.2). When Juluca 
was taken with a meal, the absorption of both dolutegravir and rilpivirine was increased. Moderate and high 
fat meals increased the dolutegravir AUC(0-∞) by approximately 87% and Cmax by approximately 75%. 
Rilpivirine AUC(0-∞) was increased by 57% and 72% and Cmax by 89% and 117%, with moderate and high 
fat meals respectively, compared to fasted conditions. Taking Juluca in fasted condition or with only a 
protein-rich nutritional drink may result in decreased plasma concentrations of rilpivirine, which could 
potentially reduce the therapeutic effect of Juluca.  
The absolute bioavailability of dolutegravir or rilpivirine has not been established.  
Distribution  
Dolutegravir is highly bound (>99%) to human plasma proteins based on in vitro data. The apparent volume 
of distribution is 17 L to 20 L in HIV-infected patients, based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. 
Binding of dolutegravir to plasma proteins is independent of dolutegravir concentration. Total blood and 
plasma drug-related radioactivity concentration ratios averaged between 0.441 to 0.535, indicating minimal 
association of radioactivity with blood cellular components. The unbound fraction of dolutegravir in plasma 
is increased at low levels of serum albumin (<35 g/L) as seen in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment.  
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dolutegravir is present in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In 13 treatment-naïve subjects on a stable dolutegravir 
plus abacavir/lamivudine regimen, dolutegravir concentration in CSF averaged 18 ng/mL (comparable to 
unbound plasma concentration, and above the IC50).  
Dolutegravir is present in the female and male genital tract. AUC in cervicovaginal fluid, cervical tissue and 
vaginal tissue were 6-10% of those in corresponding plasma at steady state. AUC in semen was 7% and 17% 
in rectal tissue of those in corresponding plasma at steady state. 
Rilpivirine is approximately 99.7% bound to plasma proteins in vitro, primarily to albumin. The distribution 
of rilpivirine into compartments other than plasma (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid, genital tract secretions) has not 
been evaluated in humans. 
Biotransformation 
Dolutegravir is primarily metabolised through glucuronidation via UGT1A1 with a minor CYP3A 
component. Dolutegravir is the predominant circulating compound in plasma; renal elimination of 
unchanged active substance is low (< 1% of the dose). Fifty-three percent of total oral dose is excreted 
unchanged in the faeces. It is unknown if all or part of this is due to unabsorbed active substance or biliary 
excretion of the glucuronidate conjugate, which can be further degraded to form the parent compound in the 
gut lumen. Thirty-two percent of the total oral dose is excreted in the urine, mainly represented by ether 
glucuronide of dolutegravir (18.9% of total dose), N-dealkylation metabolite (3.6% of total dose), and a 
metabolite formed by oxidation at the benzylic carbon (3.0% of total dose). 
In vitro experiments indicate that rilpivirine primarily undergoes oxidative metabolism mediated by the 
CYP3A system. 
Drug interactions 
In vitro, dolutegravir demonstrated no direct, or weak inhibition (IC50>50 μM) of the enzymes cytochrome 
P450 (CYP)1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 CYP3A, uridine diphosphate 
glucuronosyl transferase (UGT)1A1 or UGT2B7, or the transporters Pgp, BCRP, BSEP, OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, OCT1, MATE2-K, MRP2 or MRP4. In vitro, dolutegravir did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or 
CYP3A4. Based on this data, dolutegravir is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of medicinal 
products that are substrates of major enzymes or transporters (see section 4.5). 
In vitro, dolutegravir was not a substrate of human OATP 1B1, OATP 1B3 or OCT 1. 
Elimination  
Dolutegravir has a terminal half-life of ~14 hours. The apparent oral clearance (CL/F) is approximately 1L/hr 
in HIV-infected patients based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. 
The terminal elimination half-life of rilpivirine is approximately 45 hours. After single dose oral 
administration of 14C-rilpivirine, on average 85% and 6.1% of the radioactivity could be retrieved in faeces 
and urine, respectively. In faeces, unchanged rilpivirine accounted for on average 25% of the administered 
dose. Only trace amounts of unchanged rilpivirine (< 1% of dose) were detected in urine. 
Special patient populations 
Paediatric population 
Neither Juluca nor the combination dolutegravir and rilpivirine as single entities have been studied in 
children. Dose recommendations for paediatric patients cannot be made due to insufficient data (see section 
4.2). 
The pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir in 10 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected adolescents 
(12 to <18 years of age and weighing ≥40 kg) showed that dolutegravir 50 mg once daily oral dosage 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
resulted in dolutegravir exposure comparable to that observed in adults who received dolutegravir 50 mg 
orally once daily. The pharmacokinetics was evaluated in 11 children 6 to 12 years of age and showed that 
25 mg once daily in patients weighing at least 20 kg and 35 mg once daily in patients weighing at least 30 kg 
resulted in dolutegravir exposure comparable to adults.  
The pharmacokinetics of rilpivirine in 36 antiretroviral treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adolescent subjects 
(12 to <18 years of age) receiving rilpivirine 25 mg once daily were comparable to those in treatment-naïve 
HIV-1 infected adults receiving rilpivirine 25 mg once daily. There was no impact of body weight on 
rilpivirine pharmacokinetics in paediatric subjects in study C213 (33 to 93 kg), similar to what was observed 
in adults.  
Elderly 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis using data in HIV-1 infected adults showed that there was no clinically 
relevant effect of age on dolutegravir or rilpivirine exposures. Pharmacokinetic data in subjects >65 years old 
are very limited. 
Renal impairment 
Renal clearance of unchanged active substance is a minor pathway of elimination for dolutegravir. A study 
of the pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir was performed in subjects with severe renal impairment (CLcr 
<30 mL/min) and matched healthy controls. The exposure to dolutegravir was decreased by approximately 
40% in subjects with severe renal impairment. The mechanism for the decrease is unknown. The 
pharmacokinetics of rilpivirine have not been studied in patients with renal insufficiency.  
Renal elimination of rilpivirine is negligible. No dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild or 
moderate renal impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease, 
dolutegravir/rilpivirine should be used with caution, as rilpivirine plasma concentrations may be increased 
due to alteration of drug absorption, distribution and/or metabolism secondary to renal dysfunction. In 
patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease, the combination of dolutegravir/rilpivirine 
with a strong CYP3A inhibitor should only be used if the benefit outweighs the risk. Dolutegravir/rilpivirine 
has not been studied in patients on dialysis. As dolutegravir and rilpivirine are highly bound to plasma 
proteins, it is unlikely that they will be significantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis (see 
section 4.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
Dolutegravir and rilpivirine are both primarily metabolised and eliminated by the liver.  A single dose of 
50 mg of dolutegravir was administered to 8 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 
B) and to 8 matched healthy adult controls.  While the total dolutegravir concentration in plasma was similar, 
a 1.5- to 2-fold increase in unbound exposure to dolutegravir was observed in subjects with moderate hepatic 
impairment compared to healthy controls.  
In a rilpivirine study comparing 8 patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score A) to 8 matched 
controls, and 8 patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score B) to 8 matched controls, the 
multiple dose exposure of rilpivirine was 47% higher in patients with mild hepatic impairment and 5% 
higher in patients with moderate hepatic impairment.  However, it may not be excluded that the 
pharmacologically active, unbound, rilpivirine exposure is significantly increased in moderate hepatic 
impairment. 
No dose adjustment is considered necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-
Pugh score A or B). Dolutegravir/rilpivirine should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment.  The effect of severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score C) on the pharmacokinetics of 
dolutegravir or rilpivirine has not been studied, therefore dolutegravir/rilpivirine is not recommended in these 
patients. 
Gender 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses from studies with the individual components revealed that gender had 
no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir or rilpivirine.  
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Race  
No clinically important pharmacokinetic differences of dolutegravir or rilpivirine due to race have been 
identified.  
Co-infection with Hepatitis B or C  
Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that hepatitis C virus co-infection had no clinically relevant 
effect on the exposure to dolutegravir or rilpivirine. Subjects with hepatitis B co-infection or hepatitis C 
infection in need of anti-HCV therapy were excluded from studies with the dual combination of dolutegravir 
and rilpivirine. 
Pregnancy and postpartum 
No pharmacokinetic data are available for the combination of dolutegravir and rilpivirine in pregnancy. In 
limited data from small numbers of women in study IMPAACT P1026 who received dolutegravir 50 mg 
once daily during the 2nd trimester of pregnancy, mean intra-individual values for total dolutegravir Cmax, 
AUC24h and C24h values were, respectively, 26%, 37% and 51% lower as compared to postpartum; during the 
3rd trimester of pregnancy, Cmax, AUC24h and Cmin values were, respectively, 25%, 29% and 34% lower as 
compared to postpartum (see section 4.6). 
In women receiving rilpivirine 25 mg once daily during the 2nd trimester of pregnancy, mean intra-
individual values for total rilpivirine Cmax, AUC24h and Cmin values were, respectively, 21%, 29% and 35% 
lower as compared to postpartum; during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy, Cmax, AUC24h and Cmin values were, 
respectively, 20%, 31% and 42% lower as compared to postpartum (see section 4.6). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Non-clinical data for dolutegravir and rilpivirine reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional 
studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity. While dolutegravir was not 
carcinogenic in long-term animal studies, rilpivirine caused an increase in hepatocellular neoplasms in mice 
that may be species specific. 
Reproductive toxicology studies 
In reproductive toxicity studies in animals, dolutegravir was shown to cross the placenta. 
Dolutegravir did not affect male or female fertility in rats at 33 times higher exposures than the AUC-
exposure at 50 mg human clinical dose.  
Oral administration of dolutegravir to pregnant rats did not elicit maternal toxicity, developmental toxicity or 
teratogenicity (38 times the 50 mg human clinical exposure based on AUC). 
Oral administration of dolutegravir to pregnant rabbits did not elicit developmental toxicity or teratogenicity 
(0.56 times the 50 mg human clinical exposure based on AUC).  
Rilpivirine studies in rats and rabbits have shown no teratogenicity and no evidence of relevant embryonic or 
foetal toxicity or an effect on reproductive function at exposures respectively 15 and 70 times higher than the 
exposure in humans at the recommended dose of 25 mg once daily.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Juluca is and what it is used for 
Juluca is a medicine that contains two active ingredients used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
infection: dolutegravir and rilpivirine. Dolutegravir belongs to a group of anti-retroviral medicines called 
integrase inhibitors (INIs), and rilpivirine belongs to a group of anti-retroviral medicines called non-
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). 
Juluca is used to treat HIV in adults aged 18 years and over who are taking other antiretroviral medicines and 
whose HIV-1 infection is under control for at least 6 months. Juluca may replace your current antiretroviral 
medicines. 
Juluca keeps the amount of HIV virus in your body at a low level. This helps maintain the number of CD4 
cells in your blood. CD4 cells are a type of white blood cells that are important in helping your body to fight 
infection. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Juluca 
Do not take Juluca:  
- 
if you are allergic to dolutegravir or rilpivirine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed 
in section 6). 
Do not take Juluca if you are taking any of the following medicines as they may affect the way Juluca 
- 
- 
- 
- 
works: 
fampridine (also known as dalfampridine; used in multiple sclerosis)  
carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin (medicines to treat epilepsy and to prevent 
fits) 
rifampicin, rifapentine (medicines to treat some bacterial infections such as tuberculosis) 
omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole, (medicines to prevent and treat 
stomach ulcers, heartburn or acid reflux disease) 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
dexamethasone (a corticosteroid used in many conditions such as inflammation and allergic reactions) 
when taken by mouth or injected, except as a single dose treatment 
products that contain St John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) (a herbal product used for depression). 
If you are taking any of the above, ask your doctor about alternatives. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor or, pharmacist before taking this medicine. 
Allergic reactions 
Juluca contains dolutegravir. Dolutegravir can cause a serious allergic reaction known as a hypersensitivity 
reaction. You need to know about important signs and symptoms to look out for while you’re taking Juluca. 
→ Read the information ‘Allergic reactions’ in section 4 of this leaflet. 
Liver problems including hepatitis B and/or C 
Tell your doctor if you have or have had problems with your liver, including hepatitis B and/or C. Your 
doctor may evaluate how severe your liver disease is before deciding if you can take this medicine.  
Look out for important symptoms 
Some people taking medicines for HIV infection develop other conditions, which can be serious. These 
include:  
• 
• 
symptoms of infections and inflammation 
joint pain, stiffness and bone problems. 
You need to know about important signs and symptoms to look out for while you’re taking Juluca.  
→ Read the information ‘Other possible side effects’ in section 4 of this leaflet.  
Children and adolescents 
This medicine is not for use in children or adolescents less than 18 years of age, because it has not been 
studied in these patients. 
Other medicines and Juluca 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
Juluca must not be taken with some other medicines (see ‘Do not take Juluca’ earlier in section 2). 
Some medicines can affect how Juluca works, or make it more likely that you will have side effects. Juluca 
can also affect how some other medicines work. 
Tell your doctor if you are taking any of the medicines in the following list: 
•  metformin, to treat diabetes 
•  medicines that may cause a life threatening irregular heartbeat (Torsade de Pointes). As a number of 
different medicines can cause this condition, you should ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not 
sure 
•  medicines called antacids, to treat indigestion and heartburn. Do not take an antacid during the 6 
hours before you take Juluca, or for at least 4 hours after you take it (see also section 3, ‘How to take 
Juluca’) 
•  calcium supplements, iron supplements and multivitamins must be taken at the same time as 
Juluca with a meal. If you can’t take these supplements at the same time as Juluca, do not take a 
calcium supplement, iron supplement or multivitamin during the 6 hours before you take Juluca, 
or for at least 4 hours after you take it (see also section 3, ‘How to take Juluca’) 
•  medicines called H2 receptor antagonists (for example cimetidine, famotidine, nizatidine, 
ranitidine) to treat stomach or intestinal ulcers or used to relieve heartburn due to acid reflux. Do 
not take these medicines during the 12 hours before you take Juluca, or for at least 4 hours after you 
take it (see also section 3, ‘How to take Juluca’) 
•  any medicines to treat HIV infection 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
rifabutin, to treat tuberculosis (TB) and other bacterial infections. If you take rifabutin, your doctor 
may need to give you an additional dose of rilpivirine to treat your HIV infection (see section 3, 
‘How to take Juluca’) 
• 
artemether/lumefantrine used to prevent you catching malaria 
•  clarithromycin and erythromycin, to treat bacterial infections 
•  methadone, used in the treatment of opioid dependence 
•  dabigatran etexilate, used to treat or prevent blood clots. 
  → Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of these. Your doctor may decide that you 
need extra check ups. 
Pregnancy  
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or if you are planning to have a baby:  
→ Use of Juluca is not recommended. Ask your doctor for advice.  
Taking Juluca at the time of becoming pregnant or during the first six weeks of pregnancy, may also increase 
the risk of a type of birth defect, called neural tube defect, such as spina bifida (malformed spinal cord).  
If you could get pregnant while receiving Juluca:  
→ Talk to your doctor and discuss whether there is a need for contraception, such as condom or pills.  
Tell your doctor immediately if you become pregnant or are planning to become pregnant. Your doctor will 
review your treatment. Do not stop taking Juluca without consulting your doctor, as this may harm you and 
your unborn child.  
Breast-feeding  
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed on to 
the baby in breast milk.  
A small amount of the ingredient, dolutegravir, in Juluca can pass into your breast milk. It is not known 
whether the other ingredient, rilpivirine, can pass into your breast milk.  
If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as soon 
as possible.  
Driving and using machines  
Juluca can make you dizzy, tired or drowsy and have other side effects that make you less alert. 
→ Don’t drive or operate machinery unless you are sure you’re not affected.  
Juluca contains lactose 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have intolerance to some sugars, speak with your doctor before 
taking this medicine.  
3. 
How to take Juluca 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you 
are not sure. 
•  The recommended dose of Juluca is one tablet once a day. Juluca must be taken with a meal. A 
meal is important to get the right levels of medicine in your body. A protein-rich nutritional drink 
alone does not replace a meal. 
•  Do not chew, crush or split the tablet, to ensure the full dose is taken. 
Rifabutin 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rifabutin, a medicine to treat some bacterial infections, can lower the amount of Juluca in your body and 
make it less effective. 
If you take rifabutin, your doctor may need to give you an additional dose of rilpivirine. Take the rilpivirine 
tablet at the same time you take Juluca.  
→ Talk to your doctor for further advice on taking rifabutin with Juluca.  
Antacid medicines 
Antacids, to treat indigestion and heartburn, can stop Juluca being absorbed into your body and make it less 
effective. 
Do not take an antacid during the 6 hours before you take Juluca, or for at least 4 hours after you take it.  
→ Talk to your doctor for further advice on taking acid-lowering medicines with Juluca. 
Calcium supplements, iron supplements or multivitamins 
Calcium supplements, iron supplements or multivitamins can stop Juluca being absorbed into your body and 
make it less effective. 
Calcium supplements, iron supplements or multivitamins must be taken at the same time as Juluca. Juluca 
must be taken with a meal. 
If you can’t take these supplements at the same time as Juluca, do not take calcium supplements, iron 
supplements or multivitamins during the 6 hours before you take Juluca, or for at least 4 hours after you take 
it.

Not known  
Frequency cannot be estimated from the available data: 
•  signs or symptoms of inflammation or infection, for example fever, chills, sweats (immune 
reactivation syndrome). 
Other possible side effects 
People taking combination therapy for HIV may get other side effects. 
Symptoms of infection and inflammation  
People with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) have weak immune systems, and are more likely to develop 
serious infections (opportunistic infections). Symptoms of infection may develop, caused by old, hidden 
infections flaring up again as the body fights them. Symptoms usually include fever, plus some of the 
following: 
•  headache 
•  stomach ache 
•  difficulty breathing. 
In rare cases, as the immune system becomes stronger, it can also attack healthy body tissue (autoimmune 
disorders). The symptoms of autoimmune disorders may develop many months after you start taking 
medicine to treat your HIV infection. Symptoms may include: 
•  palpitations (rapid or irregular heartbeat) or tremor 
•  hyperactivity (excessive restlessness and movement) 
•  weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body. 
If you get any symptoms of infection or if you notice any of the symptoms above: 
  → Tell your doctor immediately. Don’t take other medicines for the infection without your doctor’s 
advice. 
Joint pain, stiffness and bone problems 
Some people taking combination therapy for HIV develop a condition called osteonecrosis. With this 
condition, parts of the bone tissue die because of reduced blood supply to the bone. People may be more 
likely to get this condition: 
50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  if they have been taking combination therapy for a long time 
•  if they are also taking anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids 
•  if they drink alcohol 
•  if their immune systems are very weak 
•  if they are overweight. 
Signs of osteonecrosis include: 
•  stiffness in the joints 
•  aches and pains in the joints (especially in the hip, knee or shoulder) 
•  difficulty moving. 
If you notice any of these symptoms: 
→ Tell your doctor. 
Weight, blood lipid and blood glucose effects  
During HIV therapy there may be an increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose. This is 
partly linked to restored health and lifestyle, and sometimes to the HIV medicines themselves. Your doctor 
will test for these changes.  
Reporting of side effects  
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects not listed 
in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix 
V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine.

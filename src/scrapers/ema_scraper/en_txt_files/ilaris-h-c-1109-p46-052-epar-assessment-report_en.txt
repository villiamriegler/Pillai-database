1.  Introduction 
On 15 January, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Ilaris, in accordance with Article 
46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that Study G1301 was an open-label, single-arm, efficacy and safety trial of 4 mg/kg 
canakinumab in Japanese patients with SJIA. Canakinumab was administered to patients every 4 
weeks for at least 48 weeks.  Two interim analyses were conducted at Week 28 and Week 48. The 
analysis at Week 28 was to support the SJIA registration dossier in Japan and analysis at week 48 
supplemented the dossier with additional safety data.  
In the EU, Ilaris (canakinumab) was first granted marketing authorization on 23 October 2009 
(European Commission Decision). Since then, Ilaris is indicated for: 
1. 
 the treatment of the following autoinflammatory periodic fever syndromes in adults, 
adolescents and children aged 2 years and older: 
-  Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) including: 
•  Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS), 
•  Neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID) / chronic infantile neurological, 
cutaneous, articular syndrome (CINCA), 
•  Severe forms of familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS) / familial cold urticaria 
(FCU) presenting with signs and symptoms beyond cold-induced urticarial skin rash. 
- 
Tumour necrosis factor receptor associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) 
-  Hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome (HIDS)/mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD) 
- 
Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), in combination with colchicine, if appropriate. 
2.  The treatment of active Still’s disease including adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD) and systemic 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) in patients aged 2 years and older who have responded 
inadequately to previous therapy with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and 
systemic corticosteroids. Ilaris can be given as monotherapy or in combination with 
methotrexate; 
3.  The symptomatic treatment of adult patients with frequent GA attacks (at least 3 attacks in the 
previous 12 months) in whom NSAIDs and colchicine are contraindicated, are not tolerated, or 
do not provide an adequate response, and in whom repeated courses of corticosteroids are not 
appropriate. 
Ilaris is registered as a powder to be dissolved and injected subcutaneously, i.e., the 150 mg powder 
for solution for injection and the 150 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection (convenient kit).

A new pharmaceutical form, the 150 mg/ml solution for injection presentation, has also been recently 
approved in the EU. Ilaris is administered via subcutaneous injection. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Canakinumab solution for sc injection was provided in vials that contained 150 mg/mL canakinumab in 
a 1 mL solution. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
CACZ885G1301: An open-label, single-arm, active-treatment, efficacy and safety 
study of canakinumab (ACZ885) administered for at least 48 weeks in Japanese 
patients with Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (SJIA) (Final analysis)

Clinical study number and title 
CACZ885G1301: An open-label, single-arm, active-treatment, efficacy and safety study of 
canakinumab (ACZ885) administered for at least 48 weeks in Japanese patients with 
Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (SJIA) (Final analysis) 
Description 
Study CACZ885G1301 evaluated the efficacy and safety of canakinumab in Japanese patients with 
SJIA. It was a phase III study designed to provide efficacy and safety data for canakinumab 
administered for at least 48 weeks as subcutaneous (s.c.) injection every 4 weeks in Japanese patients 
with SJIA. Interim analysis data at Week 28 and Week 48 from this study supported a registration 
submission of canakinumab for the indication of SJIA in Japan. Beyond Week 48, the study allowed 
patients to continue canakinumab treatment until it was approved for SJIA in Japan and was 
commercially available for clinical use. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of canakinumab, defined as the 
proportion of patients who achieved a minimum adapted ACR pediatric (hereafter ACR ped) 30 criteria 
at Week 8 and the proportion of patients with canakinumab treatment who were able to taper 
corticosteroids successfully at Week 28.

Successful oral corticosteroids tapering was defined as meeting one of the following: 
  Patients with prednisone equivalent dose of > 0.8 mg/kg/day at baseline were able to reduce 
their dose to ≤ 0.5 mg/kg/day. 
  Patients with prednisone equivalent dose from ≥ 0.5 mg/kg/day and ≤ 0.8 mg/kg/day at 
baseline were able to reduce their dose by at least 0.3 mg/kg/day. 
  Patients with any initial prednisone equivalent dose at baseline were able to reduce their dose 
to ≤ 0.2 mg/kg/day. 
  Patients with prednisone equivalent dose of ≤ 0.2 mg/kg/day at baseline were able to reduce 
their dose with any reduction 
AND maintaining a minimum aACR ped 30 criterion. 
The study population consisted of male and female patients (≥ 2 to < 20 years of age) with a 
confirmed diagnosis of SJIA as per International League Against Rheumatism definition (Petty et al 
2004) confirmed at least 3 months prior to enrollment with an onset of disease < 16 years of age.  
Active disease at the time of baseline defined as follows was needed : 
  At least 2 joints with active arthritis (using ACR definition of active joint); 
  Documented spiking, intermittent fever (body temperature > 38°C) for at least 1 day during 
the Screening Epoch and within 1 week before first canakinumab dose; 
CRP > 30 mg/L (3 mg/dL) (normal range: < 10 mg/L (1 mg/dL)) 
Study design 
Study G1301 was an open-label, single-arm, efficacy and safety trial of 4 mg/kg canakinumab in 
Japanese patients with SJIA. Canakinumab was administered to patients every 4 weeks for at least 48 
weeks.  Two interim analyses were conducted at Week 28 and Week 48. The analysis at Week 28 was 
to support the SJIA registration dossier in Japan and analysis at week 48 supplemented the dossier 
with additional safety data. Here is reported the final analysis conducted at the end of study. 
Study population /Sample size 
A total of 19 patients entered the study, of which 16 (84.2%) continued until the study ended. Three 
patients prematurely discontinued prior to Week 28. Three patients discontinued the study: two 
patients discontinued due to lack of efficacy and one patient discontinued due the AE (SJIA flare).  For 
two patients discontinued treatment phase due to lack of efficacy, one patient had SJIA flare leading to 
discontinuation of study drug, but the patient was judged by the investigator “lack of efficacy” as the 
primary reason for discontinuing treatment phase.  
All of the patients were Asian and the majority were female (n=13, 68.4%). The mean age was 9.9 
years with 18 pediatric patients aged less than 18 years old and one patient with 19 years old of age.  
Few patients were 6 years old or younger (3 patients, 15.8%) while the remaining patients were >12 
years old. The median weight was 30.1 kg (range, 10.9 to 52.3 kg). 
The median age of SJIA disease onset was 3.0 years (range, 1 to 12 years). The median time from 
SJIA diagnosis to study entry was slightly less than 6 years (2153 days; range, 131 to 6302 days). The 
median number of active joints was 4 (range, 2 to 36) and the median number of joints with limitation 
of motion was 3 (range, 0 to 16). The median standardized CRP at baseline was 198.7 mg/L (range, 
48.8 to 1311.4 mg/L). All patients were receiving concomitant oral corticosteroids therapy at baseline.

The mean (SD) oral prednisone equivalent dose was 0.31 (0.257) mg/kg/day and 73.7% (14/19) of 
the patients received > 0 to ≤ 0.4 mg/kg/day. 78.9% (15/19) of the patients had previously used 
tocilizumab for treatment of SJIA. 
Treatments 
Patients received canakinumab 4 mg/kg (maximum dose was 300 mg) administered subcutaneously 
every 4 weeks at the study center throughout the study. Study drug dose adjustment and/or 
interruptions were not permitted, with the exception of need due to changes in patient size/weight. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy: Efficacy assessments consisted of the adapted ACR pediatric (a ACR ped) criteria, oral 
steroid tapering, flare events, inactive disease, and parent’s or patient’s assessment of pain based on 
the 0-100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) in the Child Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ)©. 
Adapted ACR Pediatric criteria: 
The a ACR ped response variables are the following: 
1. Physician’s global assessment of disease activity on a 0-100 mm VAS 
2. Parent’s or patient’s (if appropriate in age) global assessment of patient's overall well-being 
based upon the 0-100 mm VAS in the CHAQ 
3. Functional ability: CHAQ disability score 
4. Number of joints with active arthritis 
5. Number of joints with limitation of motion 
6. Laboratory measure of inflammation: CRP (mg/L) 
7. Absence of intermittent fever due to SJIA during the preceding week 
A ACR ped 30/50/70/90/100 criteria: 
The a ACR ped 30/50/70/90/100 criteria are defined as meeting all of the following: 
- 
- 
- 
Improvement from baseline of ≥ 30%, ≥ 50%, ≥ 70%, ≥ 90%, or 100%, respectively, in at 
least 3 of the first 6 response variables 
No intermittent fever (i.e. oral, rectal, or axillary body temperature > 38°C only for several 
hours during the day) in the preceding week (variable 7) 
No more than one variable 1-6 worsening by more than 30% 
Oral steroid tapering: 
Patients using concomitant corticosteroids at study entry reduced their corticosteroid dose to the 
lowest possible dose/discontinuation beginning at Week 8 until the end of study, if eligible. 
Bioanalytics: 
Pharmacokinetic assessments: Canakinumab concentrations were assessed in serum by competitive 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) at 100 ng/mL.  
Pharmacodynamic assessments: Total interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) (sum of IL-1β free and bound to 
canakinumab) was analyzed in serum by competitive two ELISA methods based on commercial kits 
with LLOQ at 0.5 pg/mL or 0.299 pg/mL.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/CHMP/269480/2019  
Page 6/13 
 
 
 
 
Immunogenicity: Anti-canakinumab antibodies concentrations were analyzed in serum by a bridging 
electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Soluble protein biomarkers: IL-6 and IL-18 were measured 
with chemilluminescence enzyme immunoassay and enzyme immunoassay, respectively. 
Safety: Safety assessments consisted of collecting all adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events 
(SAEs), with their severity and relationship to study drug and pregnancies (all females of child-bearing 
potential). They included the regular monitoring of hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis; 
regular assessments of vital signs, physical condition, and body weight; electrocardiogram; clinical 
assessment of serositis, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and generalized lymphadenopathy attributable 
to SJIA; sonography of spleen and liver; and local tolerability at the subcutaneous injection site. 
Occurrence of biologic features of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) such as hemorrhages, 
central nervous system dysfunction, hepatomegaly, serum fibrinogen level < 2.5 g/L, cytopenia, 
hypertriglyceridemia, decreased platelet count, increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and 
hyperferritinemia were carefully monitored and significant findings were recorded. 
Statistical Methods 
The co-primary efficacy variables were the proportion of patients who achieved a minimum a ACR ped 
30 criteria at Week 8 and the proportion of patients who were able to taper oral corticosteroids 
successfully at Week 28. The analysis of the co-primary efficacy variables were based on the FAS. 
Successful oral steroid tapering was defined as meeting one of the following: 
1. 
Patients with prednisone equivalent dose of > 0.8 mg/kg/day at baseline were able to reduce 
their dose to ≤ 0.5 mg/kg/day. 
2. 
Patients with prednisone equivalent dose from ≥ 0.5 mg/kg/day and ≤ 0.8 mg/kg/day at 
baseline were able to reduce their dose by at least 0.3 mg/kg/day. 
3. 
Patients with any initial prednisone equivalent dose at baseline were able to reduce their 
dose to ≤ 0.2 mg/kg/day. 
4. 
Patients with prednisone equivalent dose of ≤ 0.2 mg/kg/day at baseline were able to reduce 
their dose with any reduction 
AND maintaining a minimum a ACR 30 ped criterion. 
Frequency tables with the number and percentage of patients achieving a minimum a ACR ped 30 
criteria at Week 8 and patients able to taper oral corticosteroids successfully at Week 28 were 
provided. With a small number of patients in this study, the efficacy results were presented in a 
descriptive manner. Neither a statistical model nor a statistical hypothesis was defined. For secondary 
efficacy variables and safety variables, data were presented in a descriptive manner. Data summaries 
were presented for individual efficacy and safety parameters. Continuous variables were summarized 
by descriptive statistics and number of patients with non-missing data. Categorical variables were 
summarized by absolute frequencies and percentages. Efficacy analyses were based on the FAS and 
safety parameters on the Safety set, which both consisted of all patients who received at least one 
dose of study drug under this study protocol. 
Two interim analyses (at Weeks 28 and 48) were planned and conducted during the study. In order to 
support the registration dossier in Japan, the efficacy and safety analyses up to Week 28 were 
performed after all patients completed the Week 28 assessment. The second analysis was performed 
at Week 48 to supplement the dossier with long-term safety data.

Recruitment/ Number analysed/Baseline data 
All of the patients were Asian and about 70% were female. The mean age was 9.9 years with half of 
the patients aged 6 to < 12 years (52.6%). The number of patients aged 6 or younger was small (3 
patients, 15.8%). The median weight was 30.1 kg (range, 10.9 to 52.3 kg). 
Efficacy and PK/PD results 
- 
For both of the co-primary endpoints, this study showed clinical efficacy of canakinumab 
treatment in Japanese SJIA patients. All of the 19 patients (100%) achieved a minimum of a 
ACR ped 30 at Week 8 and 14 out of 19 patients (73.7%) achieved successful steroid tapering 
at Week 28. As to the a ACR ped 30 endpoint, the confounding effect of steroid on ACR 
response in 4 patients who received increased dose of oral steroid and/or steroid pulse due to 
SJIA flare should be considered; however, this would not impact on the overall conclusion that 
a treatment effect was seen in a high proportion of patients. 
- 
Patients exhibited an early-onset ACR response during the 28 weeks of treatment; over 80% of 
patients achieved a ACR ped 30 or 70 at as early as Week 2 and a ACR ped 90 as early as 
week 4. The responses in a high proportion of patients were maintained through Week 28; the 
proportion of patients with a minimum a ACR ped 30 remained 100% at almost all time points, 
and a ACR ped 70, 90, and 100 were achieved by over 90%, 90%, and 50% of patients, 
respectively, from Week 12 through Week 28. 
- 
The proportion of responders (patients with a minimum of a ACR ped 30) was 84.2% at Week 
2 and increased to 94.7% at Week 4, 100% at Week 8, and remained 100% for most weeks 
through Week 156. The proportion of responders at end of study was 89.5%. 
- 
The proportion of patients who achieved a ACR ped 70 was 84.2% at Week 2 and increased to 
94.7% at Week 4, 100% at Week 8, and remained about 94% or more for most weeks from 
Week 12 to Week 156. The proportion of responders at end of study was 89.5%.  
- 
The proportion of patients who achieved a ACR ped 90 was 63.2% at Week 2 and increased to 
84.2% at Week 4, 89.5% at Week 8, and remained over 90% from Week 12 to Week 44. The 
response was maintained to Week 156 (83.3% to 100%). The proportion of responders at end 
of study was 84.2%. 
- 
The proportion of patients that successfully tapered steroids increased over time from Week 12 
(7/18, 38.9%) to Week 28 (14/16, 87.5%). The proportion of patients that successfully 
tapered steroids remained stable after Week 28, and the proportion remained at or above 80% 
for most weeks through Week 156. At end of study the proportion was 66.7%. The proportion 
of steroid free patients increased over time and was 12.5% (2/16) at Week 28, 31.3% (5/16) 
at Week 48, 68.8% (11/16) at Week 96 and 80.0% (4/5) at Week 144. At end of study the 
proportion of steroid free patients was 55.6% (10/18). 
- 
Each of the seven components of the a ACR ped criteria showed improvements starting at as 
early as Day 3 or Week 2 and for the remainder of the 28 weeks of treatment. The same 
degree of improvement was sustained after Week 28 through Week 48 for all of the 
components: 
- 
The physician’s global assessment of disease activity on a 0-100 mm VAS showed a 
clear decline in disease activity from baseline, with a mean change of −62.6 mm 
(−95.3%) at Week 28, −63.9 mm (−95.9%) at Week 48 and −61.4 mm (−88.9%) at 
end of study.

Page 8/13 
 
 
 
- 
The parent’s or patient’s global assessment of patient’s overall well-being on a 0-100 
mm VAS showed a clear improvement in overall well-being, with a mean change of 
−71.9 mm (−93.9%) at Week 28, −68.6 mm (−88.4%) at Week 48 and −68.1 mm 
(−86.9%) at end of study. 
- 
The CHAQ disability score showed improvement at the first evaluation at Week 2, 
which increased over time. At Weeks 28 and 48, the median change from baseline in 
the score was −1.1 (−100%) showing a treatment effect that is approximately 5.8 
times the MCID. At end of study the median change from baseline was −1.0 (−100%). 
The majority of patients (75.0%) showed an MCID improvement (defined as a 
decrease ≥ 0.19 from baseline) in the score at Weeks 28 and 48 and at end of study. 
- 
- 
The number of joints with active arthritis showed a clear decline, with a median change 
of −4.0 (−100%) at Weeks 28 and 48 and at end of study.  
The number of joints with limitation of motion showed a clear decline, with a median 
change of −2.0 (−100%) at Week 28, −2.5 (−100%) at Week 48 and −2.0 (−100%) 
at end of study. 
- 
Standardized CRP showed a clear decline as early as Day 3 and remained decreased by 
over 90%, with a median percent change from baseline of −98.7% (–188.7 mg/L) at 
Week 28, −99.4% (–188.7 mg/L) at Week 48 and −98.5% (−180.0 mg/L) at end of 
study. 
- 
Absence of intermittent fever due to SJIA was achieved in all patients from Week 4 
through Week 164 for most weeks. There were 2 patients, one at Week 56 and 1 at 
Week 124 with intermittent fever. At end of study, absence of intermittent fever was 
achieved in all patients (19/19). 
- 
The flare criteria were met for a total 3 patients during the first 48 weeks of treatment. One 
patient experienced a flare after oral steroid tapering was started. There were 3 additional 
patients with flare reported after Week 48. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Inactive disease was achieved in 60% to 70% of the patients from Week 4 onwards.  
There was an increase in arithmetic mean serum canakinumab concentrations from Day 3 to 
Week 24. Arithmetic mean concentration was then maintained from Week 24 to end of study, 
indicating that the concentration reached steady state by the time of Week 24. No unexpected 
declines were observed in individual profiles of the serum canakinumab concentrations. 
As expected, an increase in total IL-1β levels was observed following canakinumab dosing, 
signifying the binding of IL-1β to canakinumab. 
Median decreases from baseline were seen in IL-6 levels (−99.1% at Week 2 and −98.4% at 
Week 48). The median decrease from baseline in IL-18 levels was −19.5% at Week 24, but 
due to the large variability, nothing definitive can be concluded at this level of analysis. 
Safety results 
The overall safety profile of canakinumab in this final analysis at end of study was consistent with the 
known canakinumab safety profile for the SJIA patient population and with previous canakinumab 
studies in SJIA. 
The main safety findings are as follows:

- 
The median duration of exposure was 791 days. Approximately 84% of patients received study 
treatment for 96 weeks or more. The mean/median number of injections was 27.5/28.0. 
Treatment-emergent AEs were reported for all patients and the most frequently affected 
primary SOCs were infections and infestations (89.5%; primarily nasopharyngitis) and skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders (84.2%; with eczema and urticaria the most frequent PTs). 
No deaths occurred during the study. 
SAEs were reported for 10 (52.6%) patients and largely represented events associated with 
disease activity and infections. Two patients discontinued study drug during the 48 week 
treatment period, none of the SAEs after Week 48 led to premature discontinuation of study 
drug. 
- 
SAEs of MAS were reported for 3 patients (preferred term, histiocytosis haematophagic). The 
events were adjudicated by the MASAC and the adjudication outcomes were: insufficient 
information for one event, unlikely MAS for one event and possible MAS for one event. 
Additionally, 2 cases with laboratory findings suggestive of potential MAS were adjudicated by 
the MASAC as having some clinical and/or laboratory features of MAS but with possible 
alternative explanation (unlikely MAS). 
- 
- 
Cumulative changes for hemoglobin, platelets, neutrophils, leukocytes, CRP, ferritin, and 
fibrinogen were consistent with the anti-inflammatory response to canakinumab therapy. 
Notable abnormalities for hemoglobin or leukocytes represented isolated findings. None of the 
findings required treatment interruption or were associated with clinically relevant events. 
Notable abnormalities for neutrophils or platelets were noted for one patient for each. 
- 
One (5.3%) patient had newly occurring, notably high ALT of > 20 × ULN during the 48 week 
treatment period. The elevations were noted while the patient was experiencing an AE of SJIA 
flare (reported term) and serious Epstein-Barr virus infection; the values decreased to below 
the baseline level in a month. No patient had combined abnormalities involving ALT/AST with 
total bilirubin and/or alkaline phosphatase (Hy’s Law) during the study. 
- 
Nine (47.4%) patients had newly occurring clinically notable abnormalities in systolic BP, 10 
patients (52.6%) had notable abnormalities in diastolic BP. Many of these notable BP 
abnormalities were transient or isolated events. Abnormalities occurring at more than 2 
consecutive visits were seen for 1 patient with notably low systolic and diastolic BP and for 1 
patient with notably low diastolic BP. The occurrence of low systolic and diastolic BP at 2 or 
more consecutive visits was not reported as an AE for either patient. 
- 
Ten (52.6%) patients had newly occurring clinically notable abnormalities in pulse. Only one of 
these patients had notable abnormalities at more than 2 consecutive visits. No AEs of 
tachycardia or bradycardia were reported. 
- 
- 
Most of the patients had no tolerability reaction. Mild (Grade 1) local injection site reactions 
were reported for 3 (15.8%) patients. 
No anti-canakinumab antibodies were detected through end of study. 
2.3.3.  MAH´s Discussion on clinical aspects 
In study CACZ885G1301, an open label-single-arm study, a strong treatment response to 
canakinumab 4mg/kg every 4 weeks was demonstrated in Japanese patients with active SJIA. The 
onset of action was rapid and observed as early as day 3. By Week 2 the majority of patients achieved

an ACR ped 90 and inactive disease status and maintained this level of response for the remainder of 
the study.  Further, a majority of patients successfully tapered their corticosteroid dose, with the 
proportion of patients able to completely discontinue the corticosteroid increasing over time from 
12.5% at Week 28 to 68.8% at Week 96. 
The overall safety profile in the study was consistent with previous studies with no new safety signals 
observed. The frequency of AEs, including infections and other events of interest, reported during the 
course of the study was consistent with the known safety profile of canakinumab reported in previous 
studies and reflected in the SmPC. 
As the efficacy and safety data were consistent with those of prior clinical studies, the favourable 
benefit-risk profile of Ilaris remains unchanged. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The results of the finalized study G1301 showed the efficacy of canakinumab in inducing and 
maintaining a treatment response and symptom control in the evaluated Japanese patients with active 
SJIA. Results at end of study also showed a high proportion of steroid tapering possibility with 
treatment of canakinumab in SJIA patients. 
Infections were the most frequently reported events during the study. Infections and infestations are 
already described in the SmPC of Canakinumab. SAEs were mostly associated with disease activity and 
infections. some patients presented abnormalities of liver enzymes; however, most of them were 
isolated events with no clinically significant impact on patient management. 
The safety data from the final analysis showed no new safety findings compared to the known safety 
profile of canakinumab. 
No changes to the SmPC were proposed. This is acceptable.

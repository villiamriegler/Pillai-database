2.   Scientific discussion 
2.1.   Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that Study R10933-10987-COV-2069 is part of a clinical development program.  
2.2.   Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
There is no specific paediatric formulation. Each of the casirivimab and imdevimab formulated drug 
substances (FDS) consist of purified protein in an aqueous buffered solution, containing L-histidine, pH 
6.0, sucrose and polysorbate 80. Casirivmab and imdevimab drug products are supplied as liquid 
solutions for intravenous (IV) and SC administrations. The DPs are preservative-free and non-
pyrogenic.

2.3.1.  
Introduction 
This report covers the following post-authorisation commitments undertaken by the MAH: 
Submission of final results of Study R10933-10987-COV-2069 involving paediatric patients in 
accordance with Art.46 of the paediatric regulation and to address the commitment which arose from 
the original marketing authorization (EMEA-H-C-005814) as reported in the CHMP list of questions 
dated 16th September 2021. This study was a part of the PIP procedures EMEA-002964-PIP01-21-M01 
and EMEA-002965-PIP01-21-M01 (Study 5) - R19033-10987-COV-2069: Phase 3, Randomized, 
Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study Assessing the Efficacy and Safety of Anti-Spike SARS-CoV-2 
Monoclonal Antibodies in Preventing SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Household Contacts of Individuals 
Infected with SARS-CoV-2. 
The final analysis for Study COV-2069, reported in clinical study report (CSR) Addendum (#2), 
presents the completed 7-month follow-up period efficacy results and 8-month safety data of a single 
subcutaneous (SC) administration of casirivimab / imdevimab 1200 mg on the prevention of SARS 
CoV-2 infections (overall and symptomatic infections) in participants who were uninfected at baseline 
(Cohort A) and participants who were asymptomatic and SARS-COV-2 positive at baseline (Cohort B). 
The analyses presented in this addendum are based on the final database lock date of 4 November 
2021. 
Findings from the COV-2069 study have been previously presented in two separate reports prior to 
completion of the study: 
The original COV-2069 Primary Analysis CSR (dated 15 Jun 2021) provided the final primary 
● 
analysis for the primary and key secondary endpoints at Day 29 (end of the efficacy assessment period 
[EAP]). Findings were presented on two distinct study populations: Cohort A analyses evaluated 
infection prevention in participants who were uninfected at baseline, and Cohort B focused on early 
treatment to prevent symptomatic progression in participants with asymptomatic infection at baseline. 
A total of 3029 participants were randomized and enrolled in Cohort A (N = 2621) and Cohort B (N = 
314). Efficacy data for primary and secondary endpoints up to the cutoff date of 11 Mar 2021 were 
included. The safety population included all participants randomized through 28 January 2021. 
Additional 554 participants randomized between the study start date through 16 October 2020 were 
included in the administrative assessment  
EMA/902731/2022  
Page 3/27 
 
 
  
 
 
Subsequently, a Primary Analysis CSR Addendum (#1) (dated 29 Sep 2021) was submitted to 
● 
summarize the cumulative key efficacy and safety results for all enrolled participants up to the data 
cut-off of 1 July 2021, which includes an additional 269 participants enrolled in Cohort A and Cohort B 
after the data cut-off for the original Primary Analysis CSR. The results for CSR Addendum #1 were 
considered a sensitivity analysis of the findings presented in the Primary Analysis CSR and 
corroborated the efficacy and safety conclusions from the primary analysis for the study. 
2.3.2.  
Clinical study 
Study R10933-10987-COV-2069: Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled 
Study Assessing the Efficacy and Safety of Anti-Spike SARS-CoV-2 Monoclonal Antibodies in 
Preventing SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Household Contacts of Individuals Infected with SARS-
CoV-2 
Methodology 
Adults and adolescents (age > 12 years) who were household contacts of the first household member 
known to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 infection (index case), but who were themselves either not 
infected or asymptomatic (having no active respiratory or non-respiratory symptoms consistent with 
COVID-19) at the time of screening. In this study, the participant must have been sharing the same 
residence as the index case and must have had a close exposure to the index case. 
Eligible participants were randomized 1:1 to receive a single dose of placebo or casirivimab + 
imdevimab on Day 1. Randomization was performed on an individual participant basis and was 
stratified by local diagnostic assay for SARS-CoV-2 and age/weight groups. However, for analysis, 
cohort allocation was based on results from the central laboratory assessment of SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR 
status at baseline: participants who were negative for SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., uninfected) were allocated to 
Cohort A, and participants who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., with asymptomatic infection) were 
allocated to Cohort B. Each cohort was further subdivided based on baseline serology results from the 
central laboratory. To rule-out prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, participants were assessed for the presence 
of serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies indicative of prior infection: anti-spike [S1] IgA, anti-spike [S1] 
IgG, and antinucleocapsid IgG. Participants were considered seronegative if all available serology tests 
were negative, seropositive if any of the tests were positive, or sero-undetermined if results were 
missing or inconclusive 
No specific paediatric formulation was used in Study COV-2069. Both adult and adolescent participants 
(i.e., age > 12 years) received a single-dose 1200 mg casirivimab+imdevimab (600 mg per mAb) or 
single dose matching placebo, administered as 4 SC injections in the abdomen or thigh. For adults and 
paediatric participants > 10 kg investigators had the option to use an infusion pump for SC 
administration of study drug containing the combined volume with both mAbs. 
For each participant, the study comprised three periods: a 1-day screening/baseline period, a 1-month 
EAP, and a 7-month follow-up period. During the EAP, nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples for analysis 
of SARSCoV-2 RT-qPCR (test) were collected for all participants weekly. The primary efficacy endpoint 
was assessed by RT-qPCR by the central laboratory up to Day 29 (end of EAP). During the follow-up 
period, only participants who were RT-qPCR positive and participants who became symptomatic with 
COVID-19 would continue to have weekly NP swab samples collected. Assessments continued until 
there were two consecutive negative (> 24 hours) RT-qPCR results or until the end of study visit. 
Study Participants 
In this study, 3375 participants were screened. A total of 3298 participants were randomized, of whom 
3270 were treated: 2867 in Cohort A; 335 in Cohort B; 1 in Cohort 1A2; and 67 in the SARS-CoV-2 
Undetermined group3 (refer to CSR Addendum #2, Study COV-2069, Table 1). A total of 94.2% of 
participants completed the end of study visit at the time of the study completion. 
In Cohort A, adolescents (age > 12 to < 18 years) comprised a total of 74/1683 (4.4%) participants in 
the efficacy analysis and 98/2867 (3.4%) participants in the safety analysis (Table 1). In addition, a 
10-year-old paediatric participant was enrolled into Cohort A1 (placebo group, baseline-seropositive). 
EMA/902731/2022  
Page 4/27 
 
 
  
 
 
In Cohort B, adolescents (age > 12 to < 18 years) comprised a total of 28/225 (12.4%) participants in 
the efficacy analysis and 43/335 (12.8%) participants in the safety analysis (Table 2). 
Results 
Overview of safety 
Safety in Adolescent Participants Who Were Uninfected at Baseline (Cohort A) 
Adverse Events in Paediatric Participants (SAF-A and SAF-A1) Cohort A included paediatric participants (≥12 years 
and <18 years of age; termed adolescents). In addition, a 10-year-old  paediatric participant was enrolled into 
Cohort A1 (placebo group, baseline-seropositive) and did not experience any TEAEs during the study. 
In cohort A, the proportion of paediatric participants with TEAEs of Asymptomatic COVID-19 
andCOVID-19 were significantly higher in the placebo group than the casirivimab+imdevimab group 
(Table below). Conversely, the proportion of pediatric participants with TEAEs of Injection site reaction 
(ISR) was higher in the casirivimab + imdevimab group compared to placebo although comparable to 
adult participants. Overall, the types of TEAEs experienced by adolescent participants were similar to 
those observed in the adult population.

Similar to adults, the majority of TEAEs in the cohort A paediatric population were mild or moderate in 
severity (i.e., grade 1 or grade 2) (Table below). 
One adolescent participant reported a Grade 3 TEAE of bone fracture in the placebo group. No other 
adolescent participant reported Grade 3 or Grade 4 TEAEs during the overall study period.

Safety in Adolescent Participants with Asymptomatic Infection at Baseline (Cohort B) 
Paediatric participants in cohort B included adolescent participants only (age ≥12 to <18 years). No participant<12 
years of age enrolled in cohort B. 
COVID-19 was the only TEAE reported by >1 paediatric participant during the study. Regardless of age 
group in cohort B, the incidence of COVID-19 was higher in the placebo group than the 
casirivimab+imdevimab group.

Overview Efficacy 
Supportive exploratory analyses conducted in the paediatric participant population in cohort A was 
performed.  
Treatment with casirivimab+imdevimab resulted in a relative risk reduction for symptomatic SARS-
CoV-2 infections (COVID-19) similar to that in baseline-seronegative participants (81.2% compared to 
placebo) in paediatric (≥12 to <18 years old) participants (100% compared to placebo).

Page 9/27 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Treatment with casirivimab+imdevimab resulted in a relative risk reduction for all SARS-CoV-2 
infections (asymptomatic and symptomatic) similar to that in baseline-seronegative participants 
(68.2% compared to placebo) for paediatric (≥12 years to <18 years old) participants 74.5% 
compared to placebo). 
Efficacy Analyses in Participants Regardless of Baseline Serostatus 
Treatment with casirivimab+imdevimab resulted in a relative risk reduction for symptomatic SARS-
CoV-2 infections (COVID-19) in participants regardless of baseline serostatus (79.7% compared to 
placebo) (Table below) similar to that in baseline-seronegative participants (81.2% compared to 
placebo);

Clinical Pharmacology 
Key clinical pharmacokinetics results for adolescent participants are listed below:  
As of the final database lock (DBL) for this PK analysis, a total of 3270 subjects (3125 adults, 144 adolescents, and 1 
paediatric participant [< 12 years]) were allocated to 1 of 4 cohorts based on age (subjects ≥ 12 years in Cohort A and 
B; and subjects < 12 years in Cohort A1) and SARS-CoV-2 infection status at baseline (negative subjects in Cohort A 
and A1; positive subjects in Cohort B and B1), as measured by central laboratory SARS-CoV-2 RT -qPCR. 
All subjects ≥ 12 years were randomized to receive a single 1200 mg SC dose of casirivimab +imdevimab or placebo 
in a 1:1 ratio per cohort. Of the 3270 participants who were in the safety analysis set, 295 participants were included 
in the PK analysis set (PKAS). 
Table 9 
EMA/902731/2022  
Page 11/27 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
      
 
There were three defined subsets for participants ≥ 12 years: sentinel (subset 1) with dense 
pharmacokinetics (PK) sampling; safety (subset 2) with sparse PK sampling, and all other subjects 
(subset 3) for which no samples for PK were collected. Paediatric participants < 12 years were to be 
randomized to receive a single dose of casirivimab+imdevimab (SC [408, 792, or 1200 mg] or 
intramuscular [48, 96, or 144 mg]; weigh-tiered dose) or placebo in a 1:1 ratio per cohort. There were 
initially two defined subsets for participants < 12 years: paediatric sentinel (subset 4) with sparse PK 
sampling schedule, and all other paediatric participants (subset 5) with sparse PK sampling schedule. 
However, only 1 paediatric participant < 12 years was enrolled in the sentinel subset, in Cohort A1, 
and received placebo SC. 
Table 10
The concentration over time profiles for total casirivimab and total imdevimab following SC 
administration were similar to each other and were characterized by an initial absorption phase 
(adults) followed by a mono-exponential elimination phase.

Assessor’s comment 
Concentrations in serum in paediatric participants (≥12 and <18) with body weights ≥40 kg were 
slightly higher than those observed in adults. The argument that this may be contributed to differences 
in body weight distribution is agreed. External validation of paediatric PK data by use of pop PK 
modelling is requested.

Table 11
Due to the sparse nature of sample collection, non-compartmental analysis was not conducted in the 
paediatric population. 
As shown in Figure 6, in the paediatric participants ≥12 years and <18 years (weighing ≥ 40 kg), 
mono-exponential elimination phase was similar to that observed for adults.  
The first post-dose serum sample in paediatric participants was available at Day28, hence no data are 
available for assessment of the absorption phase in these participants. 
Casirivimab and imdevimab concentrations in serum in paediatric participants (≥12 and <18) with 
body weights ≥40 kg were slightly higher than those observed in adults likely due to differences in 
body weight distribution. 
Casirivimab and imdevimab were detectable in serum over 224 days of sample collection following a 
single 1200 mg SC dose of casirivimab+imdevimab. 
Immunogenicity 
In paediatric participants, the ADA incidence and titer and the NAb incidence observed were similar to 
that observed in overall study population.

2.3.3.  
Discussion on clinical aspects 
Starting from protocol amendment 3, adolescent subjects ≥12 to <18 years of age (weight ≥40 kg) 
were eligible to be enrolled and randomized into the overall study, therefore all paediatric participants 
who enrolled were adolescents.  
Starting from protocol amendment 4, paediatric participants aged <12 years were eligible to be 
enrolled and randomized into the overall study. A single paediatric participant (aged 10 years) enrolled 
into cohort A1 and was randomized to the placebo group but was not included in the efficacy analysis 
because they were seropositive at baseline; however, the participant was included in the safety 
analysis. 
No specific paediatric formulation was used in Study COV-2069. Both adult and adolescent participants 
(i.e., age > 12 years) received a single-dose SC of 1200 mg casirivimab+imdevimab (600 mg per 
mAb) or single dose-matching placebo. 
In Cohort A, the safety analysis population included 99 paediatric participants, 98 adolescents (age > 
12 to < 18 years) and one child participant (age 10 years). Overall, the types and severity of TEAEs 
experienced by adolescent participants were similar to those experienced by adults in the study. The 
single child participant (age 10 years) did not experience any TEAEs during the study 
In Cohort B, the safety analysis included 43 adolescents (age > 12 to < 18 years). Overall, the types 
and severity of TEAEs experienced by adolescent participants were similar to those experienced by 
adults in the study.

Treatment with casirivimab + imdevimab resulted in a relative risk reduction for symptomatic SARS-
CoV-2 infections (COVID-19) similar to that in baseline seronegative participants (100% compared to 
placebo in paediatric participants) 
Treatment with casirivimab + imdevimab resulted in a relative risk reduction for all SARS-CoV-2 
infections (asymptomatic and symptomatic) similar to that in baseline-seronegative participants 
(74.5% compared to placebo in paediatric participants) 
The interpretation of results in paediatric participants is limited due to small sample sizes and small 
number of events. 
Casirivimab and imdevimab were detectable in serum over 224 days of sample collection following a 
single 1200 mg SC dose of casirivimab+imdevimab. 
Due to the sparse PK sample collection, non-compartmental analysis was not conducted in the 
paediatric population. However, data indicate that in the paediatric participants ≥12 years and <18 
years (weighing ≥ 40 kg), mono-exponential elimination phase is similar to that observed for adults. 
No data are available for assessment of the absorption phase in these participants. 
Concentrations in serum in paediatric participants (≥12 and <18) with body weights ≥40 kg were 
slightly higher than those observed in adults. The argument that this may be contributed to differences 
in body weight distribution is agreed. External validation of paediatric PK data by use of population PK 
modelling is requested.  
It is agreed that in paediatric participants, the ADA incidence and titer and the NAb incidence observed 
were similar to that observed in overall study population. 
3.   CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
Casirivimab+imdevimab was well tolerated in adolescent (age ≥12 to <18 years). The safety profile in 
adolescents was comparable to the safety profile in adults. The types of TEAEs experienced by 
adolescent participants were similar to those observed in the adult population. 
The treatment effect observed in supportive exploratory analyses conducted in the adolescent 
participants in Cohort A was consistent with the treatment effect observed in the adult participants in 
this cohort for the 8-month study period. 
Based on the PK results provided no changes for the SmPC section 5.2 is warranted.

MAH response 
In the overall cohort B population (asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive at baseline) including 
adults and adolescents, and regardless of serostatus at baseline (including seronegative, seropositive, 
and indeterminate), a single 1200 mg SC dose of casirivimab+imdevimab (REGN10933+REGN10987) 
prevented the progression to symptomatic COVID-19 in recently infected asymptomatic participants 
during the entire 8 month study period, with a relative risk reduction of 37.8% as compared to 
placebo. 
These results are similar to the Cohort B efficacy results in adults and adolescents, regardless of 
serostatus at baseline, previously reported in Table 34 of CSR addendum 1 demonstrating a 38.5% 
relative risk reduction during the primary efficacy analysis period (29 days).  
In adolescent participants (age 12 to <18 years), casirivimab + imdevimab as compared to placebo, prevented the 
progression to symptomatic COVID- 19 during the entire 8-month study period with a relative risk reduction of 73.9% 
(Table 1). In participants who were age ≥18 years, casirivimab+imdevimab, as compared to placebo, prevented the 
progression to symptomatic COVID-19 with a relative risk reduction of 29.8% during the entire 8-month study period.  
Although a greater relative risk reduction is observed in the adolescent population (73.9%) as 
compared to the adult population (29.8%), interpretation of this post-hoc analysis is limited due to the 
small number of symptomatic infections in the adolescent population and the small sample size of the 
adolescent population 
Assessor’s comment 
The requested data are provided. We agree with the MAH that although a greater relative risk 
reduction is observed in the adolescent population (73.9%) as compared to the adult population 
(29.8%), interpretation of this post-hoc analysis is limited due to the small number of symptomatic 
infections in the adolescent population and the small sample size of the adolescent population

No results in seropositive patients were provided. Please provide efficacy results separately for 
MAH response 
Cohort A (prevention of symptomatic infection): 
EMA/902731/2022  
Page 18/27 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
In Table 2, we provide efficacy results for the prevention of symptomatic infection by 
casirivimab+imdevimab as compared to placebo, separately for seronegative and seropositive subjects 
by age group, during the entire 8-month study period. 
Although greater relative risk reduction is observed in the seronegative adolescent population (100%) 
compared to the seronegative adult population (80.4%) (Table 17 in CSR addendum 2) and compared 
to the combined seronegative adult and adolescent population (81.2%) (Table 16 in CSR addendum 
2), interpretation of this post-hoc analysis is limited due to the small number of symptomatic infections 
in the adolescent population and the small sample size of the adolescent population.  
In seropositive adolescents aged 12 to < 18 years, there were no symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections 
in either casirivimab+imdevimab or placebo groups. The interpretation of the relative risk reduction 
with casirivimab+imdevimab in the seropositive adult population (40.1%) limited due to low 
symptomatic infection events in both the casirivimab+imdevimab and placebo groups, consistent with 
pre-existing natural immunity (seropositivity) conferring protection against infection. 
Cohort A (prevention of any infection, including symptomatic and asymptomatic): 
In Table 3, we provide efficacy results for the development of any infection (including symptomatic and 
asymptomatic) during the entire 8-month study period, separately for seronegative and seropositive 
subjects by age group.  
Although a greater relative risk reduction is observed in the seronegative and seropositive adolescent 
populations (74.5% and 100% respectively) compared to the seronegative and seropositive adult 
EMA/902731/2022

populations, interpretation of this post-hoc analysis is limited due to the small number of infections in 
the adolescent population and the small sample size of the adolescent population. The interpretation of 
the relative risk reduction with casirivimab+imdevimab in the seropositive adult population (33.8%) is 
limited due to low infection events in both the casirivimab+imdevimab and placebo groups, consistent 
with pre-existing natural immunity (seropositivity) conferring protection against infection. 
Cohort B: 
In Table 4, we provide efficacy results for cohort B participants (asymptomatic SARSCoV- 2 RT-PCR 
positive at baseline) who develop symptomatic infection, separately for seronegative and seropositive 
subjects by age group, during the entire 8-month study period. 
Similar to the overall Cohort B efficacy results in seronegative adults and adolescents, previously 
reported in Table 29 of CSR addendum 1, demonstrating a 31.1% relative risk reduction during the 29-
day primary efficacy analysis period, new analyses demonstrate a relative risk reduction of 30.3% 
during the entire 8-month study period. In the new analyses where efficacy results are reported 
separately by age group, there is a greater relative risk reduction observed in the seronegative 
adolescent population (62.5%) compared to the seronegative adult population (24.4%). 
Interpretation of this post-hoc analysis by age group is limited by the small sample size of the 
subgroups. The interpretation of the relative risk reduction with casirivimab+imdevimab in the 
seropositive adolescent (100%) and adult population (20%) is limited to low infection events in both 
groups, consistent with their known pre-existing natural immunity (seropositivity) conferring protection 
against infection. 
Assessor’s comment 
The requested information is provided.  
We agree with the MAH that interpretation of this post-hoc analysis by age group is limited by the 
small sample size of the subgroups.

QUESTION 3 
3. 
External validation of paediatric PK data by use of pop PK modelling should be provided. 
MAH Response 
The external validation of population PK modelling is presented below. The results demonstrate that 
the population PK models, which incorporated allometric scaling and age impact to account for the 
effect of body weight and age on PK parameters in pediatric subjects, were able to predict

concentrations of casirivimab and imdevimab in serum in pediatric subjects for the pediatric dose 
equivalents to the adult 1200 mg SC dose well, indicating the model-based predictions based on adult 
data are consistent with the observed pediatric data. 
Method 
Two population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) models with the same model structure were developed for 
casirivimab and imdevimab based on an analysis dataset comprised of 3687 casirivimab and 3716 
imdevimab adult subjects from three clinical studies (R10933-10987-COV-2067, R10933-10987-COV-
2069, and R10933-10987-COV-20145). The developed PopPK models for casirivimab and imdevimab 
were 2-compartment models with linear elimination and first-order absorption following subcutaneous 
(SC) dosing (R10933-PK-21053-SR-01V1). The PopPK models for casirivimab and imdevimab were 
used to perform simulations in virtual adult and pediatric populations receiving weight-tiered single 
dose of casirivimab+imdevimab given subcutaneously as outlined below. PopPK model parameters 
were fixed to the estimates from the final PK models of casirivimab and imdevimab (R10933-PK-
21053-SR-01V1) with inter-subject variability incorporated via simulated interindividual random 
effects. Given the uncertainty in the estimation of the weight related exponents scaling the structural 
parameters in the analyses of the adult data, allometric scaling based on theoretical weight related 
exponents and age impact were applied to account for the effect of body size and age on PK 
parameters in pediatric populations (Basu et al., 2020).Simulated concentration-time profiles (median 
and 90% prediction interval) of casirivimab and imdevimab overlaid with observed data from Study 
R10933-10987-COV- 2069 are presented. 
• Dosing setup: 
- 1200 mg SC single dose casirivimab+imdevimab for ≥40 kg group 
- 792 mg SC single dose casirivimab+imdevimab for ≥20 to <40 kg group

MAH’s CONCLUSION 
Overlay plots of population PK simulated concentrations of casirivimab and imdevimab in serum 
[median (90% Prediction Interval)] versus observed concentrations for each pediatric body weight tier 
showed good agreement between predicted and observed concentrations through day 112, with the 
population PK model slightly underestimating concentrations at day 224. 
These results from the validation demonstrate that the population PK models, which incorporated 
allometric scaling and age impact to account for the effect of body weight and age on PK parameters in 
pediatric subjects, were able to predict concentrations of casirivimab and imdevimab in serum in 
pediatric subjects for the pediatric dose equivalents to the adult 1200mg SC dose well, indicating the 
model-based predictions based on adult data are consistent with the observed pediatric data. 
Assessor’s comment 
From a methodological point of view, the MAH’s approach is not supported and is contradictory to the 
EMA Q&A (https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/research-development/scientific-
guidelines/clinical-pharmacology-pharmacokinetics/modelling-simulation-questions-answers). 
Maturation effect in terms of additional age-related effects in addition to the weight effect is not 
expected to affect the PK of mabs in subjects at the age of 12 and above but only at very young age 
and thus at weight below 20 kg. Thus, the MAH’s approach to include age-related effects in addition to 
weight-related effects for simulating the exposure for adolescents above 20 kg of weight is not 
supported. Of note, there is data of only one adolescent subjects at weight below 40 kg. 
The MAH was reasoning that age impact was applied to account for the effect of body size and age on 
PK parameters in paediatric populations, given the uncertainty in the estimation of the weight related 
exponents scaling the structural parameters in the analyses of the adult data. Instead, the MAH may 
have tried to estimate the weight effect based on a comprehensive weight range, to investigate the 
impact of fixed versus estimated allometric exponents. No definite model selection to justify the chosen 
maturation function has been provided, in addition. External validation based on the adult pop PK 
model is thus considered missing, even for the weight category above 40 kg (adolescents).  
Simulated concentration-time profiles (median and 90% prediction interval) of casirivimab and 
imdevimab overlaid with observed data from Study R10933-10987-COV- 2069 are presented, with is 
supported.  
Nevertheless, paediatric PK data (observations) and presented simulations indicate the predominant 
weight effect and the observed paediatric PK data indicate consistency. Nevertheless, the issue of 
accounting for weight and age-related effects may become relevant in case of a potential extension of 
indication for other paediatric age groups. 
Issue not further pursued.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Iclusig is indicated in adult patients with 
•  chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast phase chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) who are 
resistant to dasatinib or nilotinib; who are intolerant to dasatinib or nilotinib and for whom 
subsequent treatment with imatinib is not clinically appropriate; or who have the T315I 
mutation 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph+ ALL) who are resistant 
to dasatinib; who are intolerant to dasatinib and for whom subsequent treatment with imatinib is 
not clinically appropriate; or who have the T315I mutation. 
See sections 4.2 for the assessment of cardiovascular status prior to start of therapy and 4.4 for 
situations where an alternative treatment may be considered. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with 
leukaemia. Haematologic support such as platelet transfusion and haematopoietic growth factors can 
be used during treatment if clinically indicated. 
Before starting treatment with ponatinib, the cardiovascular status of the patient should be assessed, 
including history and physical examination, and cardiovascular risk factors should be actively 
managed. Cardiovascular status should continue to be monitored and medical and supportive therapy 
for conditions that contribute to cardiovascular risk should be optimised during treatment with 
ponatinib. 
Posology 
The recommended starting dose is 45 mg of ponatinib once daily. For the standard dose of 45 mg once 
daily, a 45 mg film-coated tablet is available. Treatment should be continued as long as the patient 
does not show evidence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
Patients should be monitored for response according to standard clinical guidelines.  
Discontinuing ponatinib should be considered if a complete haematologic response has not occurred 
by 3 months (90 days). 
The risk of arterial occlusive events is likely to be dose-related. Reducing the dose of Iclusig to 15 mg 
should be considered for CP-CML patients who have achieved a major cytogenetic response taking the 
following factors into account in the individual patient assessment: cardiovascular risk, side effects of 
ponatinib therapy, time to response, and BCR-ABL transcript levels (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). If dose 
reduction is undertaken, close monitoring of response is recommended. In patients with loss of 
response the dose of Iclusig can be re-escalated to a previously tolerated dosage of 30 mg or 45 mg 
orally once daily. 
Management of toxicities 
Dose modifications or interruption of dosing should be considered for the management of 
haematological and non-haematological toxicities. In the case of severe adverse reactions, treatment 
should be withheld. 
For patients whose adverse reactions are resolved or attenuated in severity, Iclusig may be restarted 
and escalation of the dose back to the daily dose used prior to the adverse reaction may be considered, 
if clinically appropriate. 
For a dose of 30 mg or 15 mg once daily, 15 mg and 30 mg film-coated tablets are available. 
Myelosuppression 
Dose modifications for neutropenia (ANC* < 1.0 x 109/L) and thrombocytopenia 
(platelet < 50 x 109/L) that are unrelated to leukaemia are summarized in Table 1.

*ANC = absolute neutrophil count 
Arterial occlusion and venous thromboembolism 
In a patient suspected of developing an arterial occlusive event or a venous thromboembolism, Iclusig 
should be immediately interrupted. A benefit-risk consideration should guide a decision to restart 
Iclusig therapy (see sections 4.4 and 4.8) after the event is resolved. 
Hypertension may contribute to risk of arterial occlusive events. Iclusig treatment should be 
temporarily interrupted if hypertension is not medically controlled.

Elderly patients 
Of the 449 patients in the clinical study of Iclusig, 155 (35%) were ≥ 65 years of age. Compared to 
patients < 65 years, older patients are more likely to experience adverse reactions. 
Hepatic impairment 
Patients with hepatic impairment may receive the recommended starting dose. Caution is 
recommended when administering Iclusig to patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 
5.2). 
Renal impairment 
Renal excretion is not a major route of ponatinib elimination. Iclusig has not been studied in patients 
with renal impairment. Patients with estimated creatinine clearance of ≥ 50 mL/min should be able to 
safely receive Iclusig with no dosage adjustment. Caution is recommended when administering Iclusig 
to patients with estimated creatinine clearance of < 50 mL/min, or end-stage renal disease. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Iclusig in patients less than 18 years of age have not been established. No 
data are available. 
Method of administration 
Iclusig is for oral use. The tablets should be swallowed whole. Patients should not crush or dissolve 
the tablets. Iclusig may be taken with or without food. 
Patients should be advised not to swallow the desiccant canister found in the bottle. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Important adverse reactions 
Myelosuppression 
Iclusig is associated with severe (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events grade 3 or 4) thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anaemia. Most of the patients with grade 3 or 
4 platelet count decreased, anaemia or neutropenia, developed it within the first 3 months of treatment. 
The frequency of these events is greater in patients with accelerated phase CML (AP-CML) or blast 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
phase CML (BP-CML)/Ph+ ALL than in chronic phase CML (CP-CML). A complete blood count 
should be performed every 2 weeks for the first 3 months and then monthly or as clinically indicated. 
Myelosuppression was generally reversible and usually managed by withholding Iclusig temporarily 
or reducing the dose (see section 4.2). 
Arterial occlusion 
Arterial occlusions, including fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, retinal arterial occlusions associated 
in some cases with permanent visual impairment or vision loss, stenosis of large arterial vessels of the 
brain, severe peripheral vascular disease, renal artery stenosis (associated with worsening, labile or 
treatment-resistant hypertension), and the need for urgent revascularization procedures have occurred 
in Iclusig-treated patients. Patients with and without cardiovascular risk factors, including patients age 
50 years or younger, experienced these events. Arterial occlusion adverse events were more frequent 
with increasing age and in patients with history of ischaemia, hypertension, diabetes, or 
hyperlipidaemia.  
The risk of arterial occlusive events is likely to be dose-related (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). 
Arterial occlusive adverse reactions including serious reactions, have occurred in the PACE phase 2 
trial (see section 4.8). Some patients experienced more than 1 type of event.  
The median time to onset of the first cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular arterial 
occlusive events was 351, 611, and 605 days, respectively. 
Iclusig should not be used in patients with a history of myocardial infarction, prior revascularization or 
stroke, unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the potential risk (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
In these patients, alternative treatment options should also be considered before starting treatment with 
ponatinib. 
Before starting treatment with ponatinib, the cardiovascular status of the patient should be assessed, 
including history and physical examination, and cardiovascular risk factors should be actively 
managed. Cardiovascular status should continue to be monitored and medical and supportive therapy 
for conditions that contribute to cardiovascular risk should be optimised during treatment with 
ponatinib. 
Monitoring for evidence of arterial occlusion should be performed and if decreased vision or blurred 
vision occurs, an ophthalmic examination (including fundoscopy) should be performed. Iclusig should 
be interrupted immediately in case of arterial occlusion. A benefit -risk consideration should guide a 
decision to restart Iclusig therapy (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Venous thromboembolism  
Venous thromboembolic adverse reactions including serious reactions have occurred in the PACE 
phase 2 trial (see section 4.8). 
Monitoring for evidence of thromboembolism should be performed. Iclusig should be interrupted 
immediately in case of thromboembolism. A benefit -risk consideration should guide a decision to 
restart Iclusig therapy (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Retinal venous occlusions associated in some cases with permanent visual impairment or vision loss 
have occurred in Iclusig-treated patients. If decreased vision or blurred vision occurs, an ophthalmic 
examination (including fundoscopy) should be performed. 
Hypertension  
Hypertension may contribute to risk of arterial thrombotic events, including renal artery stenosis. 
During Iclusig treatment, blood pressure should be monitored and managed at each clinic visit and 
hypertension should be treated to normal. Iclusig treatment should be temporarily interrupted if 
hypertension is not medically controlled (see section 4.2). 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the event of significant worsening, labile or treatment-resistant hypertension, treatment should be 
interrupted and evaluation for renal artery stenosis should be considered. 
Treatment-emergent hypertension (including hypertensive crisis) occurred in Iclusig-treated patients. 
Patients may require urgent clinical intervention for hypertension associated with confusion, headache, 
chest pain, or shortness of breath. 
Aneurysms and artery dissections 
The use of VEGF pathway inhibitors in patients with or without hypertension may promote the 
formation of aneurysms and/or artery dissections. Before initiating Iclusig, this risk should be 
carefully considered in patients with risk factors such as hypertension or history of aneurysm. 
Congestive heart failure 
Fatal and serious heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction occurred in Iclusig-treated patients, 
including events related to prior vascular occlusive events. Patients should be monitored for signs or 
symptoms consistent with heart failure and they should be treated as clinically indicated, including 
interruption of Iclusig. Discontinuation of ponatinib should be considered in patients who develop 
serious heart failure (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Pancreatitis and serum lipase 
Iclusig is associated with pancreatitis. The frequency of pancreatitis is greater in the first 2 months of 
use. Check serum lipase every 2 weeks for the first 2 months and then periodically thereafter. Dose 
interruption or reduction may be required. If lipase elevations are accompanied by abdominal 
symptoms, Iclusig should be withheld and patients evaluated for evidence of pancreatitis (see section 
4.2). Caution is recommended in patients with a history of pancreatitis or alcohol abuse. Patients with 
severe or very severe hypertriglyceridemia should be appropriately managed to reduce the risk of 
pancreatitis. 
Hepatotoxicity 
Iclusig may result in elevation in ALT, AST, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase. Most patients who 
had an event of hepatotoxicity had their first event during the first year of treatment. Hepatic failure 
(including fatal outcome) has been observed. Liver function tests should be performed prior to 
treatment initiation and monitored periodically, as clinically indicated. 
Haemorrhage 
Severe haemorrhage, including fatalities, occurred in Iclusig-treated patients. The incidence of severe 
bleeding events was higher in patients with AP-CML, BP-CML and Ph+ ALL. Gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage and subdural hematoma were the most commonly reported grade 3/4 bleeding events. 
Most haemorrhagic events, but not all, occurred in patients with grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia. Iclusig 
should be interrupted and patients evaluated for serious or severe haemorrhage. 
Hepatitis B reactivation 
Reactivation of hepatitis B in patients who are chronic carriers of this virus has occurred after these 
patients received BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Some cases resulted in acute hepatic failure or 
fulminant hepatitis leading to liver transplantation or a fatal outcome. 
Patients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with Iclusig. Experts in liver 
disease and in the treatment of hepatitis B should be consulted before treatment is initiated in patients 
with positive hepatitis B serology (including those with active disease) and for patients who test 
positive for HBV infection during treatment. Carriers of HBV who require treatment with Iclusig 
should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and 
for several months following termination of therapy (see section 4.8). 
Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome  
Post-marketing cases of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) have been reported in 
Iclusig-treated patients. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PRES is a neurological disorder that can present with signs and symptoms such as seizure, headache, 
decreased alertness, altered mental functioning, vision loss, and other visual and neurological 
disturbances. 
If diagnosed, interrupt Iclusig treatment and resume treatment only once the event is resolved and if 
the benefit of continued treatment outweighs the risk of PRES. 
Medicinal product interactions 
Caution should be exercised with concurrent use of Iclusig and moderate and strong CYP3A inhibitors 
and moderate and strong CYP3A inducers (see section 4.5).  
Concomitant use of ponatinib with anti-clotting agents should be approached with caution in patients 
who may be at risk of bleeding events (see “Myelosuppression” and “Haemorrhage”). Formal studies 
of ponatinib with anti-clotting medicinal products have not been conducted. 
QT prolongation 
The QT interval prolongation potential of Iclusig was assessed in 39 leukaemia patients and no 
clinically significant QT prolongation was observed (see section 5.1). However, a thorough QT study 
has not been performed; therefore a clinically significant effect on QT cannot be excluded. 
Special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
Patients with hepatic impairment may receive the recommended starting dose. Caution is 
recommended when administering Iclusig to patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 
5.2). 
Renal impairment 
Caution is recommended in when administering Iclusig to patients with estimated creatinine clearance 
of < 50 mL/min or end-stage renal disease (see section 4.2). 
Lactose 
This medicinal product contains lactose monohydrate. Patients with rare hereditary problems of 
galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take 
this medicinal product. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Substances that may increase ponatinib serum concentrations 
CYP3A inhibitors 
Ponatinib is metabolized by CYP3A4.  
Co-administration of a single 15 mg oral dose of Iclusig in the presence of ketoconazole (400 mg 
daily), a strong CYP3A inhibitor, resulted in modest increases in ponatinib systemic exposure, with 
ponatinib AUC0-∞ and Cmax values that were 78% and 47% higher, respectively, than those seen when 
ponatinib was administered alone.  
Caution should be exercised and a reduction of the starting dose of Iclusig to 30 mg should be 
considered with concurrent use of strong CYP3A inhibitors such as clarithromycin, indinavir, 
itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, 
troleandomycin, voriconazole, and grapefruit juice. 
Substances that may decrease ponatinib serum concentrations 
CYP3A inducers 
Co-administration of a single 45 mg dose of Iclusig in the presence of rifampin (600 mg daily), a 
strong CYP3A inducer, to 19 healthy volunteers, decreased the AUC0-∞ and Cmax of ponatinib by 62% 
and 42%, respectively, when compared to administration of ponatinib alone. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Co-administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, 
rifabutin, rifampicin, and St. John’s Wort with ponatinib should be avoided, and alternatives to the 
CYP3A4 inducer should be sought, unless the benefit outweighs the possible risk of ponatinib 
underexposure. 
Substances that may have their serum concentrations altered by ponatinib  
Transporter substrates 
In vitro, ponatinib is an inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP. Therefore, ponatinib may have the potential to 
increase plasma concentrations of co-administered substrates of P-gp (e.g., digoxin, dabigatran, 
colchicine, pravastatin) or BCRP (e.g., methotrexate, rosuvastatin, sulfasalazine) and may increase 
their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions. Close clinical surveillance is recommended when 
ponatinib is administered with these medicinal products.  
Paediatric population 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females  
Women of childbearing age being treated with Iclusig should be advised not to become pregnant and 
men being treated with Iclusig should be advised not to father a child during treatment. An effective 
method of contraception should be used during treatment. It is unknown whether ponatinib affects the 
effectiveness of systemic hormonal contraceptives. An alternative or additional method of 
contraception should be used.  
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data from the use of Iclusig in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Iclusig should be 
used during pregnancy only when clearly necessary. If it is used during pregnancy, the patient must be 
informed of the potential risk to the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether Iclusig is excreted in human milk. Available pharmacodynamic and 
toxicological data cannot exclude potential excretion in human milk. Breast-feeding should be stopped 
during treatment with Iclusig. 
Fertility 
No human data on the effect of ponatinib on fertility are available. In rats, treatment with ponatinib 
has shown effects on female fertility and male fertility was not affected (see section 5.3). The clinical 
relevance of these findings to human fertility is unknown. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Iclusig has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Adverse reactions such as 
lethargy, dizziness, and vision blurred have been associated with Iclusig. Therefore, caution should be 
recommended when driving or operating machines. 
4.8 
Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
In the PACE phase 2 trial (see section 5.1) the most common serious adverse reactions > 2% 
(treatment-emergent frequencies) were pneumonia (7.3%), pancreatitis (5.8%), abdominal pain 
(4.7%), atrial fibrillation (4.5%), pyrexia (4.5%), myocardial infarction (4.0%), peripheral arterial 
occlusive disease (3.8%), anaemia (3.8%), angina pectoris (3.3%), platelet count decreased (3.1%), 
febrile neutropenia (2.9%), hypertension (2.9%), coronary artery disease (2.7%), cardiac failure

congestive (2.4%), cerebrovascular accident (2.4%), sepsis (2.4%), cellulitis (2.2%), acute kidney 
injury (2.0%), urinary tract infection (2.0%) and lipase increased (2.0%). 
Serious arterial cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular occlusive adverse reactions 
(treatment-emergent frequencies) occurred in 10%, 7%, and 9% of Iclusig-treated patients, 
respectively. Serious venous occlusive reactions (treatment-emergent frequencies) occurred in 5% of 
patients.  
Arterial cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular occlusive adverse reactions 
(treatment-emergent frequencies) occurred in 13%, 9%, and 11% of Iclusig-treated patients, 
respectively. Overall arterial occlusive adverse reactions have occurred in 25% of Iclusig-treated 
patients from the PACE phase 2 trial with a minimum 64 months follow-up, with serious adverse 
reactions occurring in 20% of patients. Some patients experienced more than one type of event. 
Venous thromboembolic reactions (treatment-emergent frequencies) occurred in 6% of patients. The 
incidence of thromboembolic events is higher in patients with Ph+ ALL or BP-CML than those with 
AP-CML or CP-CML. No venous occlusive events were fatal. 
After a minimum follow-up of 64 months, the rates of adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation 
were 20% in CP-CML, 11% in AP-CML, 15% in BP-CML and 9% in Ph+ ALL.  
In the OPTIC phase 2 trial (see section 5.1) with a median duration of follow-up of 31.1 months, 
overall arterial occlusive adverse reactions have occurred in 10% of Iclusig-treated patients (45 mg 
cohort) and serious adverse reactions occurring in 4.3% of patients (45 mg cohort). Arterial 
cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular occlusive adverse reactions 
(treatment-emergent frequencies) occurred in 4.3%, 2.1%, and 3.2% of Iclusig-treated patients (45 mg 
cohort), respectively. Of the 94 patients in the 45 mg cohort, 1 patient experienced a venous 
thromboembolic reaction. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The frequencies of adverse reactions are based on 449 CML and Ph+ALL patients exposed to 
ponatinib in the PACE phase 2 trial. See section 5.1 for information on the main characteristics of 
participants in the trial. Adverse reactions reported in all CML and Ph+ ALL patients are listed by 
system organ class and by frequency in Table 4. Frequency categories are very common (≥ 1/10), 
common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) and uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), 
very rare (< 1/10,000), and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each 
frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Vascular occlusion (see section 4.2 and 4.4). 
Serious vascular occlusion has occurred in patients treated with Iclusig, including cardiovascular, 
cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular events, and venous thrombotic events. Patients with and 
without cardiovascular risk factors, including patients age 50 years or younger, experienced these 
events. Arterial occlusive adverse events were more frequent with increasing age and in patients with 
history of ischaemia, hypertension, diabetes, or hyperlipidaemia. 
In the PACE phase 2 trial (see section 5.1) with a minimum 64-month follow-up, arterial 
cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular occlusive adverse reactions 
(treatment-emergent frequencies) occurred in 13%, 9%, and 11% of Iclusig-treated patients, 
respectively. Overall, arterial occlusive adverse reactions have occurred in 25% of Iclusig-treated 
patients from the PACE phase 2 trial, with serious adverse reactions occurring in 20% of patients. 
Some patients experienced more than one type of event. The median time to onset of the first 
cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular arterial occlusive events was 351, 611, and 
605 days, respectively in the PACE trial. Venous thromboembolic reactions (treatment-emergent 
frequencies) occurred in 6% of patients. 
In the OPTIC phase 2 trial (see section 5.1) with a median 31.1 months follow-up, arterial 
cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular occlusive adverse reactions 
(treatment-emergent frequencies) occurred in 4.3%, 2.1%, and 3.2% of Iclusig-treated patients (45 mg 
cohort), respectively. Overall, arterial occlusive adverse reactions have occurred in 10% of 
Iclusig-treated patients (45 mg cohort) with serious adverse reactions occurring in 4.3% of patients 
(45 mg cohort). The median time to onset of the first cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral 
vascular arterial occlusive events was 295, 379, and 23 days, respectively in the OPTIC trial. Of the 94 
patients in OPTIC (45 mg cohort), 1 patient experienced a venous thromboembolic reaction.

Myelosuppression 
Myelosuppression was commonly reported in all patient populations. The frequency of Grade 3 or 4 
thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anaemia was higher in patients with AP-CML and 
BP-CML/Ph+ ALL than in patients with CP-CML (see Table 5). Myelosuppression was reported in 
patients with normal baseline laboratory values as well as in patients with pre-existing laboratory 
abnormalities.  
Discontinuation due to myelosuppression was infrequent (thrombocytopenia 4%, neutropenia and 
anaemia < 1% each). 
Hepatitis B reactivation  
Hepatitis B reactivation has been reported in association with BCR-ABL TKIs. Some cases resulted in 
acute hepatic failure or fulminant hepatitis leading to liver transplantation or a fatal outcome (see 
section 4.4). 
Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (SCARs) 
Severe skin reactions (such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome) have been reported with some BCR-ABL 
Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors. Patients should be warned to immediately report suspected skin reactions, 
especially if associated with blistering, peeling, mucosal involvement or systemic symptoms.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

4.9  Overdose 
Isolated reports of unintentional overdose with Iclusig were reported in clinical trials. Single doses of 
165 mg and an estimated 540 mg in two patients did not result in any clinically significant adverse 
reactions. Multiple doses of 90 mg per day for 12 days in a patient resulted in pneumonia, systemic 
inflammatory response, atrial fibrillation, and asymptomatic, moderate pericardial effusion. Treatment 
was interrupted, the events resolved, and Iclusig was restarted at 45 mg, once daily. In the event of an 
overdose of Iclusig, the patient should be observed and appropriate supportive treatment given.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01EA05 
Ponatinib is a potent pan BCR-ABL inhibitor with structural elements, including a carbon-carbon 
triple-bond, that enable high affinity binding to native BCR-ABL and mutant forms of the ABL 
kinase. Ponatinib inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of ABL and T315I mutant ABL with IC50 values 
of 0.4 and 2.0 nM, respectively. In cellular assays, ponatinib was able to overcome imatinib, dasatinib, 
and nilotinib resistance mediated by BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations. In preclinical mutagenesis 
studies, 40 nM was determined as the concentration of ponatinib sufficient to inhibit viability of cells 
expressing all tested BCR-ABL mutants by > 50% (including T315I) and suppress the emergence of 
mutant clones. In a cell-based accelerated mutagenesis assay, no mutation in BCR-ABL was detected 
that could confer resistance to 40 nM ponatinib.  
Ponatinib elicited tumour shrinkage and prolonged survival in mice bearing tumours expressing native 
or T315I mutant BCR-ABL. 
At doses of 30 mg or greater plasma steady state trough concentrations of ponatinib typically exceed 
21 ng/mL (40 nM). At doses of 15 mg or greater, 32 of 34 patients (94%) demonstrated a ≥ 50% 
reduction of CRK-like (CRKL) phosphorylation, a biomarker of BCR-ABL inhibition, in peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells. 
Ponatinib inhibits the activity of other clinically relevant kinases with IC50 values below 20 nM and 
has demonstrated cellular activity against RET, FLT3, and KIT and members of the FGFR, PDGFR, 
and VEGFR families of kinases. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
PACE Trial 
The safety and efficacy of Iclusig in CML and Ph+ ALL patients who were resistant or intolerant to 
prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy were evaluated in a single-arm, open-label, international, 
multicenter trial. All patients were administered 45 mg of Iclusig once-daily with the possibility of 
dose de-escalations and dose interruptions followed by dose resumption and re-escalation. Patients 
were assigned to one of six cohorts based on disease phase (CP-CML; AP-CML; or 
BP-CML/Ph+ ALL), resistance or intolerance (R/I) to dasatinib or nilotinib, and the presence of the 
T315I mutation. 
Resistance in CP-CML was defined as failure to achieve either a complete haematological response 
(by 3 months), a minor cytogenetic response (by 6 months), or a major cytogenetic response (by 
12 months) while on dasatinib or nilotinib. CP-CML patients who experienced a loss of response or 
development of a kinase domain mutation in the absence of a complete cytogenetic response or 
progression to AP-CML or BP-CML at any time on dasatinib or nilotinib were also considered 
resistant. Resistance in AP-CML and BP-CML/Ph+ ALL was defined as failure to achieve either a 
major haematological response (AP-CML by 3 months, BP-CML/Ph+ ALL by 1 month), loss of major 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
haematological response (at any time), or development of kinase domain mutation in the absence of a 
major haematological response while on dasatinib or nilotinib.  
Intolerance was defined as the discontinuation of dasatinib or nilotinib due to toxicities despite optimal 
management in the absence of a complete cytogenetic response for CP CML patients or major 
haematological response for AP CML, BP CML, or Ph+ ALL patients. 
The primary efficacy endpoint in CP-CML was major cytogenetic response (MCyR), which included 
complete and partial cytogenetic responses (CCyR and PCyR) by 12 months. The secondary efficacy 
endpoints in CP-CML were complete haematological response (CHR) and major molecular response 
(MMR). 
The primary efficacy endpoint in AP-CML and BP-CML/Ph+ ALL was major haematological 
response (MaHR), defined as either a complete haematological response (CHR) or no evidence of 
leukaemia (NEL). The secondary efficacy endpoints in AP-CML and BP-CML/Ph+ ALL were MCyR 
and MMR. 
For all patients, additional secondary efficacy endpoints included: confirmed MCyR, time to response, 
duration of response, progression free survival, and overall survival. Also, post-hoc analyses to assess 
the relationship of shorter-term cytogenetic (MCyR) and molecular (MMR) response outcomes with 
longer-term outcomes of PFS and OS, maintenance of response (MCyR and MMR) after dose 
reductions, and PFS and OS by Arterial Occlusive Event status were conducted. 
The trial enrolled 449 patients of which 444 were eligible for analysis: 267 CP-CML patients (R/I 
Cohort: n = 203, T315I Cohort: n = 64), 83 AP-CML patients (R/I Cohort: n = 65, T315I Cohort: 
n = 18), 62 BP-CML (R/I Cohort: n = 38, T315I Cohort: n = 24), and 32 Ph+ ALL patients (R/I 
Cohort: n = 10, T315I Cohort: n = 22). A prior MCyR or better (MCyR, MMR, or CMR) to dasatinib 
or nilotinib was only achieved in 26 % patients with CP-CML and a prior MaHR or better (MaHR, 
MCyR, MMR, or CMR) was only achieved in 21 %, and 24 % of AP-CML, and BP-CML/Ph+ALL 
patients, respectively. Baseline demographic characteristics are described in Table 6 below.

CP-CML patients who received fewer prior TKIs attained higher cytogenetic, haematological, and 
molecular responses. Of the CP-CML patients previously treated with one, two, three or four prior 
TKIs, 75% (12/16), 68% (66/97), 44% (63/142), and 58% (7/12)) achieved a MCyR while on Iclusig, 
respectively. The median dose intensity was 28 mg/day or, 63% of the expected 45 mg dose. 
Of the CP-CML patients with no mutation detected at entry, 49% (66/136) achieved a MCyR. 
For every BCR-ABL mutation detected in more than one CP-CML patient at entry, a MCyR was 
achieved following treatment with Iclusig. 
In CP-CML patients who achieved MCyR, the median time to MCyR was 2.8 months (range: 1.6 to 
11.3 months) and in patients who achieved MMR, the median time to MMR was 5.5 months (range: 
1.8 to 55.5 months). At the time of updated reporting with minimum follow-up for all ongoing patients 
of 64 months, the median durations of MCyR and MMR had not yet been reached. Based on the 
Kaplan-Meier estimates, 82% (95% CI: [74%–88%]) of CP-CML (median duration of treatment: 
32.2 months) patients who achieved a MCyR are projected to maintain that response at 48 months and 
61% (95% CI: [51%- 70%]) of CP-CML patients who achieved a MMR are projected to maintain that 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
response at 36 months. The probability of all patients with CP-CML maintaining MCyR and MMR did 
not change further when the analysis was extended out to 5 years. 
With a minimum follow-up of 64 months, 3.4% (9/267) of CP-CML patients experienced 
transformation of their disease to AP-CML or BP-CML. 
For CP-CML patients overall (N = 267), as well as for CP-CML R/I Cohort A patients (N = 203) and 
T315I Cohort B patients (N = 64), the median OS has not yet been reached. For the overall CP-CML 
disease group, the probability of survival at 2, 3, 4, and 5 years is estimated as 86.0%, 81.2%, 76.9%, 
and 73.3%, respectively, as shown in Figure 1. 
Figure 1- Kaplan-Meier estimates for overall survival in the CP-CML population (Treated 
Population) 
CP-CML patients who achieved MCyR or MMR response within the first year of treatment had 
statistically significantly improved progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to 
those patients who did not meet the treatment milestones. A MCyR at the 3-month landmark 
correlated strongly and statistically significantly with PFS and OS (p< 0.0001 and p = 0.0006, 
respectively). Statistical significance was achieved in the correlation of PFS and OS with a MCyR at 
the 12-month landmark (p = < 0.0001 and p = 0.0012, respectively).

The median dose intensity was 44 mg/day in the BP CML/Ph+ ALL patients. 
The median time to MaHR in patients with AP-CML, BP-CML, and Ph+ ALL was 0.7 months (range: 
0.4 to 5.8 months), 1.0 months (range: 0.4 to 3.7 months), and 0.7 months (range: 0.4 to 5.5 months), 
respectively. At the time of updated reporting with minimum follow-up for all ongoing patients of 
64 months, the median duration of MaHR for AP-CML (median duration of treatment: 19.4 months) 
BP-CML (median duration of treatment: 2.9 months), and Ph+ ALL (median duration of treatment: 
2.7 months) patients was estimated as 12.9 months (range: 1.2 to 68.4 months), 6.0 months (range: 
1.8 to 59.6 months), and 3.2 months (range: 1.8 to 12.8 months), respectively. 
For all patients in the PACE phase 2 trial, the dose intensity-safety relationship indicated that there are 
significant increases in grade ≥ 3 adverse events (cardiac failure, arterial thrombosis, hypertension, 
thrombocytopenia, pancreatitis, neutropenia, rash, ALT increase, AST increase, lipase increase, 
myelosuppression, arthralgia) over the dose range of 15 to 45 mg once-daily.  
The analysis of the dose intensity-safety relationship in the PACE phase 2 trial concluded that after 
adjusting for covariates, the overall dose intensity is significantly associated with an increased risk of 
arterial occlusion, with an odds ratio of approximately 1.6 for each 15 mg increase. In addition, results 
from logistic regression analyses of data from patients in the phase 1 trial, suggest a relationship 
between systemic exposure (AUC) and occurrence of arterial thrombotic events. A reduction in dose is 
therefore expected to reduce the risk of vascular occlusive events, however, the analysis suggested that 
there may be a ‘carry over’ effect of higher doses such that it might take up to several months before a 
dose reduction manifests in risk reduction. Other covariates that show a statistically significant 
association with the occurrence of vascular occlusive events in this analysis are medical history of 
ischemia and age. 
Dose reduction in CP-CML patients 
In the PACE phase 2 trial, dose reductions were recommended following adverse events. Additional 
recommendations for prospective dose reduction in all CP-CML patients in the absence of adverse 
events were introduced in this trial with the aim of reducing the risk of vascular occlusive events.  
With a minimum follow-up of 48 months, and approximately 2 years after the recommendation for 
prospective dose reduction, there were 110 CP-CML patients ongoing. A majority of these ongoing 
patients (82/110 patients; 75%) were reported to be receiving 15 mg at the last dose, while 
24/110 patients (22%) were receiving 30 mg, and 4/110 (4%) were receiving 45 mg. At the time of 
study closure initiation (minimum follow-up of 64 months, and more than 3 years after the 
recommendation for prospective dose reduction), 99 CP-CML patients were ongoing and 77 (78%) of 
these patients received 15 mg as their last dose on study. 
Safety 
In the PACE phase 2 trial, 86 CP-CML patients achieved MCyR at a dose of 45 mg, 45 CP-CML 
patients achieved MCyR after a dose reduction to 30 mg, mostly for adverse events.  
Vascular occlusive events occurred in 44 of these 131 patients. Most of these events occurred at the 
dose at which the patient achieved MCyR; fewer events occurred after dose reduction.

The median time to onset of the first cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular arterial 
occlusive events was 351, 611, and 605 days, respectively. When adjusted for exposure, the incidence 
of first arterial occlusive events was greatest in the first two years of follow-up and declined with 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
decreasing daily dose intensity (following recommendation for prospective dose reduction). Factors 
other than dose may also contribute to this risk of arterial occlusion. 
Efficacy 
Data from the PACE phase 2 trial are available for the maintenance of response (MCyR and MMR) in 
all CP-CML patients who underwent dose reduction for any reason. Table 11 shows these data for 
patients who achieved MCyR and MMR at 45 mg; similar data are available for patients who achieved 
MCyR and MMR at 30 mg.  
The majority of patients who underwent dose reduction maintained response (MCyR and MMR) for 
the duration of currently available follow-up. A proportion of patients did not undergo any dose 
reduction, based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.

The anti-leukaemic activity of Iclusig was also evaluated in a phase 1 dose escalation study that 
included 65 CML and Ph+ ALL patients; the study is completed. Of 43 CP-CML patients, 31 
CP-CML patients achieved a MCyR with a median duration of follow-up of 55.5 months (range: 1.7 to 
91.4 months). At the time of reporting, 25 CP-CML patients were in MCyR (median duration of 
MCyR had not been reached). 
OPTIC Open-label randomized Phase 2 Trial 
The safety and efficacy of Iclusig was evaluated in the OPTIC phase 2 trial, a dose-optimization trial. 
Eligible patients had CP-CML whose disease was considered to be resistant to at least 2 prior kinase 
inhibitors or who have the T315I mutation. Resistance in CP-CML while on a prior kinase inhibitor 
was defined as failure to achieve either a complete hematologic response (by 3 months), a minor 
cytogenetic response (by 6 months), or a major cytogenetic response (by 12 months), or development 
of a new BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutation or new clonal evolution. Patients were required to have 
> 1% BCR-ABL1IS (by real-time polymerase chain reaction) at trial entry. Patients received one of 
three starting dosages: 45 mg orally once daily, 30 mg orally once daily, or 15 mg orally once daily. 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients who received a starting dose of 45 mg or 30 mg had a mandatory dose reduction to 15 mg 
once daily upon achieving ≤ 1% BCR-ABL1IS. The primary efficacy endpoint was a molecular 
response based on the achievement of ≤ 1% BCR-ABL1IS at 12 months. All patients reached the 
12-month time point (primary endpoint) by the primary analysis data cut-off. The median duration of 
follow-up for the 45 mg cohort (N = 94) was 31.1 months (95% CI: 24.1, 36.0). Only the efficacy 
results for the recommended starting dose of 45 mg are described below. A total of 282 patients 
received Iclusig: 94 received a starting dose of 45 mg, 94 received a starting dose of 30 mg, and 94 
received a starting dose of 15 mg. Baseline demographic characteristics are described in Table 12 for 
patients who received a starting dose of 45 mg.

Efficacy results are summarised in Table 13. 
The primary endpoint was met in patients who received a starting dose of 45 mg.  
Overall, 44% of patients had one or more BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations at study entry with the 
most frequent being T315I (27%). The subgroup analysis based on baseline T315I mutation status 
showed similar ≤ 1% BCR-ABL1IS rates at 2 months in patients with and without T315I (see Table 13 
below). No mutations were detected at study entry for 54% of the patients who received the starting 
dose of 45 mg. 
With a minimum follow up of two years among patients with CP-CML, the proportion of patients 
experiencing transformation of their disease to either AP-CML or BP-CML was 10.6% and 3.2% 
respectively.

response at baseline was excluded from the analysis. 
(g) Of the 91 patients, one patient did not have a baseline mutation assessment and was excluded from the 
response by mutation analysis. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints included complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) at 12 months, 
major molecular response (MMR) at 12 and 24 months, complete hematologic response at 3 months, 
time to response, duration of response, maintenance of response, progression free survival (PFS), and 
overall survival (OS). In addition, additional assessment included the rates of molecular response at 
each patient visit at 3-month intervals for 36 months based on the achievement of ≤ 1% BCR-ABL1IS. 
•  At 12 months, 34% (31/91) and 17% (16/93) of patients achieved CCyR, and MMR, respectively. 
At 24 months, 24% (18/75) of patients achieved MMR. The median duration of MMR had not yet 
been reached. 
•  The median duration of ponatinib treatment was 21 months. 
•  Of the 45 patients who had a dose reduction after achieving ≤ 1% BCR-ABL1IS, 28 patients 
(62%) maintained their response at the reduced dose for at least 90 days. Of the 28 patients, 18 
patients (64%) maintained the response for at least one year. Median duration of response (MR2) 
was not reached. The probabilities of maintaining MR2 at 12 months and at 24 months were 
79.13% and 73.17% respectively. 
•  The molecular response rates (measured by achievement of ≤ 1% BCR-ABL1IS) at 12 months 
was lower among patients who had received treatment with ≤ 2 prior TKIs compared with 
patients who had received ≥ 3 prior TKIs (40% vs 48%), respectively).

Cardiac electrophysiology 
The QT interval prolongation potential of Iclusig was assessed in 39 leukaemia patients who received 
30 mg, 45 mg, or 60 mg Iclusig once daily. Serial ECGs in triplicate were collected at baseline and at 
steady state to evaluate the effect of ponatinib on QT intervals. No clinically significant changes in the 
mean QTc interval (i.e., > 20 ms) from baseline were detected in the study. In addition, the 
pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models show no exposure-effect relationship, with an estimated 
QTcF mean change of –6.4 ms (upper confidence interval –0.9 ms) at Cmax for the 60 mg group.  
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Iclusig in children from birth to less than 1 year in CML and Ph+ ALL. The European Medicines 
Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Iclusig in paediatric patients 
from 1 year to less than 18 years in CML and Ph+ ALL (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric 
use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Peak concentrations of ponatinib are observed approximately 4 hours after oral administration. Within 
the range of clinically relevant doses evaluated in patients (15 mg to 60 mg), ponatinib exhibited dose 
proportional increases in both Cmax and AUC. The geometric mean (CV%) Cmax and AUC(0-τ) 
exposures achieved for ponatinib 45 mg daily at steady state were 77 ng/mL (50%) and 
1296 ng•hr/mL (48%), respectively. Following either a high-fat and low-fat meal, plasma ponatinib 
exposures (Cmax and AUC) were not different versus fasting conditions. Iclusig may be administered 
with or without food. Co-administration of Iclusig with a potent inhibitor of gastric acid secretion 
resulted in a minor reduction in ponatinib Cmax without a reduction in AUC0-∞. 
Distribution 
Ponatinib is highly bound (> 99%) to plasma proteins in vitro. The blood/plasma ratio of ponatinib is 
0.96. Ponatinib is not displaced by concomitant administration of ibuprofen, nifedipine, propranolol, 
salicylic acid, or warfarin. At daily doses of 45 mg, the geometric mean (CV%) apparent steady state 
volume of distribution is 1101 L (94%) suggesting that ponatinib is extensively distributed in the 
extravascular space. In vitro studies suggested that ponatinib is either not a substrate or is a weak 
substrate for both P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein BCRP. Ponatinib is not a substrate for the 
human organic anion transporting polypeptides OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and the organic cation 
transporter OCT-1. 
Biotransformation 
Ponatinib is metabolized to an inactive carboxylic acid by esterases and/or amidases, and metabolized 
by CYP3A4 to an N-desmethyl metabolite that is 4 times less active than ponatinib. The carboxylic 
acid and the N-desmethyl metabolite comprise 58% and 2% of the circulating levels of ponatinib, 
respectively. 
At therapeutic serum concentrations, ponatinib did not inhibit OATP1B1 or OATP1B3, OCT1 or 
OCT2, organic anion transporters OAT1 or OAT3, or bile salt export pump (BSEP) in vitro. 
Therefore, clinical medicinal product interactions are unlikely to occur as a result of  
ponatinib-mediated inhibition of substrates for these transporters. In vitro studies indicate that clinical 
medicinal product interactions are unlikely to occur as a result of ponatinib-mediated inhibition of the 
metabolism of substrates for CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A or CYP2D6.  
An in vitro study in human hepatocytes indicated that clinical medicinal product interactions are also 
unlikely to occur as a result of ponatinib-mediated induction of the metabolism of substrates for 
CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A. 
Elimination 
Following single and multiple 45 mg doses of Iclusig, the terminal elimination half-life of ponatinib 
was 22 hours, and steady state conditions are typically achieved within 1 week of continuous dosing. 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
With once-daily dosing, plasma exposures of ponatinib are increased by approximately 1.5-fold 
between first dose and steady state conditions. Although plasma ponatinib exposures increased to 
steady-state levels with continuous dosing, a population pharmacokinetic analysis predicts a limited 
increase in apparent oral clearance within the first two weeks of continuous dosing, which is not 
considered clinically relevant. Ponatinib is mainly eliminated via faeces. Following a single oral dose 
of [14C]-labeled ponatinib, approximately 87% of the radioactive dose is recovered in the faeces and 
approximately 5% in the urine. Unchanged ponatinib accounted for 24% and < 1% of the administered 
dose in faeces and urine, respectively, with the remainder of the dose comprising metabolites. 
Renal impairment  
Iclusig has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. Although renal excretion is not a major 
route of ponatinib elimination, the potential for moderate or severe renal impairment to affect hepatic 
elimination has not been determined (see section 4.2). 
Hepatic impairment  
A single dose of 30 mg ponatinib was administered to patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic 
impairment and to healthy volunteers with normal hepatic function. Ponatinib Cmax was comparable in 
patients with mild hepatic impairment and healthy volunteers with normal hepatic function. In patients 
with moderate or severe hepatic impairment, ponatinib Cmax and AUC0-∞ were lower and ponatinib 
plasma elimination half-life was longer in patients with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment 
but not clinically significantly different than in healthy volunteers with normal hepatic function. 
In vitro data showed no difference in plasma protein binding in plasma samples of healthy subjects 
and hepatically impaired (mild, moderate and severe) subjects. Compared to healthy volunteers with 
normal liver function, no major differences in ponatinib PK were observed in patients with varying 
degrees of hepatic impairment. A reduction of the starting dose of Iclusig in patients with hepatic 
impairment is not necessary (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Caution is recommended when administering Iclusig to patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 
4.2 and 4.4).  
Iclusig has not been studied at doses above 30 mg in patients with hepatic impairment (Childs-Pugh 
Classes A, B & C). 
Intrinsic factors affecting ponatinib pharmacokinetics 
No specific studies have been performed to evaluate the effects of gender, age, race, and body weight 
on ponatinib pharmacokinetics. An integrated population pharmacokinetic analysis completed for 
ponatinib suggests that age may be predictive of variability for ponatinib apparent oral clearance 
(CL/F). Gender, race and body weight were not predictive in explaining ponatinib pharmacokinetic 
intersubject variability. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Iclusig has been evaluated in safety pharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, reproductive 
toxicity, phototoxicity and carcinogenicity studies. 
Ponatinib did not exhibit genotoxic properties when evaluated in the standard in vitro and in vivo 
systems. 
Adverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to 
clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use are described below. 
Depletion of lymphoid organs was observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and cynomolgus 
monkeys. The effects were shown to be reversible after withdrawal of the treatment.  
Hyper-/hypoplastic changes of the chondrocytes in the physis were noted in repeat-dose toxicity 
studies in rats. 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In rats, inflammatory changes accompanied by increases in neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, and 
fibrinogen levels were found in the preputial and clitoral glands following chronic dosing.  
Skin changes in the form of crusts, hyperkeratosis, or erythema were observed in toxicity studies in 
cynomolgus monkeys. Dry flaky skin was observed in toxicity studies in rats. 
In a study in rats, diffuse corneal edema with neutrophilic cell infiltration, and hyperplastic changes in 
the lenticular epithelium suggestive of a mild phototoxic reaction were observed in animals treated 
with 5 and 10 mg/kg ponatinib.  
In cynomolgus monkeys, systolic heart murmurs with no macroscopic or microscopic correlates were 
noted in individual animals treated with 5 and 45 mg/kg in the single dose toxicity study and at 1, 2.5 
and 5 mg/kg in the 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study. The clinical relevance of this finding is 
unknown.  
In cynomolgus monkeys, thyroid gland follicular atrophy mostly accompanied by a reduction in T3 
levels and a tendency toward increased TSH levels were observed in the 4-week repeat-dose toxicity 
study in cynomolgus monkeys.  
Ponatinib-related microscopic findings in the ovaries (increased follicular atresia) and testes (minimal 
germ cell degeneration) in animals treated with 5 mg/kg ponatinib were noted in repeat-dose toxicity 
studies in cynomolgus monkeys. 
Ponatinib at doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg produced increases in urine output and electrolyte excretions 
and caused a decrease in gastric emptying in safety pharmacology studies in rats. 
In rats, embryo-foetal toxicity in the form of post-implantation loss, reduced foetal body weight, and 
multiple soft tissue and skeletal alterations were observed at maternal toxic dosages. Multiple foetal 
soft tissue and skeletal alterations were also observed at maternal nontoxic dosages.  
In a fertility study in male and female rats, female fertility parameters were reduced at dose levels 
corresponding to human clinical exposures. Evidence for pre- and post-implantation loss of embryos 
was reported in female rats and ponatinib may therefore impair female fertility. There were no effects 
on male rat fertility parameters. The clinical relevance of these findings on human fertility is 
unknown. 
In juvenile rats, mortality related to inflammatory effects was observed in animals treated with 
3 mg/kg/day, and reductions in body weight gain were observed at doses of 0.75, 1.5 and 3 mg/kg/day 
during the pre-weaning and early post-weaning treatment phases. Ponatinib did not adversely affect 
important developmental parameters in the juvenile toxicity study. 
In a two-year carcinogenicity study in male and female rats, oral administration of ponatinib at 0.05, 
0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg/day in males and at 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg/day in females did not result in any 
tumorigenic effects. The 0.8 mg/kg/day dose in females resulted in a plasma exposure level generally 
lower or equivalent to the human exposure at the range of dose from 15 mg to 45 mg daily. A 
statistically significant increased incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the clitoral gland was 
observed at that dose. The clinical relevance of this finding for humans is not known.

Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Iclusig is and what it is used for 
Iclusig is used to treat adults with the following leukaemia types who are no longer benefiting from 
treatment with other medicines, or have a certain genetic difference known as a T315I mutation: 
• 
chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML): a blood cancer involving too many abnormal white blood 
cells in the blood and the bone marrow (where blood cells are formed). 
Philadelphia-chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph+ ALL): a type of 
leukaemia involving too many immature white blood cells in the blood and blood forming bone 
marrow. In this kind of leukaemia, some of the DNA (genetic material) has become rearranged 
to form an abnormal chromosome, the Philadelphia chromosome. 
• 
Iclusig belongs to a group of medicines called tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In patients with CML and 
Ph+ ALL, changes in the DNA trigger a signal that tells the body to produce abnormal white blood 
cells. Iclusig blocks this signal, thereby stopping the production of these cells. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Iclusig 
Do not take Iclusig 
• 
if you are allergic to ponatinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
6).

ever had or might now have a hepatitis B infection. This is because Iclusig could cause hepatitis 
B to become active again, which can be fatal in some cases. Patients will be carefully checked 
by their doctor for signs of this infection before treatment is started. 
Your doctor will perform: 
• 
• 
evaluations of your heart function and the condition of your arteries and veins 
a complete blood count 
This will be repeated every 2 weeks for the first 3 months after starting the therapy. Afterwards 
it is performed monthly or as indicated by the doctor. 
checks of the serum protein known as lipase 
A serum protein called lipase will be checked every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, then 
periodically. A break in treatment or a decrease in dose may be required when lipase is 
increased. 
liver tests 
Liver function tests will be performed periodically, as indicated by your doctor. 
• 
• 
A brain condition called posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been reported in 
patients treated with ponatinib. Symptoms may include sudden onset of severe headache, confusion, 
seizures, and vision changes. Tell your doctor straight away if you experience any of these symptoms 
during your treatment with ponatinib, because it could be serious.

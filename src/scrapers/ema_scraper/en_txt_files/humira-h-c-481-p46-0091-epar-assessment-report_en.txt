1.  Introduction 
On March 3 2016, the MAH submitted the study M13-687 for Humira, including one paediatric subject 
(17 years old), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
Study M13-687 was an OL, single arm study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of 
adalimumab dose escalation to 80 mg eow in Japanese patients with Crohn’s disease who lost response 
to adalimumab 40 mg eow. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
Humira is currently approved for several inflammatory diseases in adults, including rheumatoid 
arthritis, plaque psoriasis, arthritic psoriasis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease and ankylosing 
spondylitis. In the paediatric population Humira is indicated for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis, enthesitis-related arthritis, paediatric plaque psoriasis and Crohn´s disease. 
For paediatric Crohn´s disease the current indication is severe active Crohn's disease in paediatric 
patients (from 6 years of age) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including 
primary nutrition therapy, a corticosteroid, and an immunomodulator, or who are intolerant to or have 
contraindications for such therapies. 
However, on 1 April 2016, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a 
positive opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation. 
The CHMP adopted an extension to the existing indication in paediatric Crohn's disease as follows: 
 "Humira is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in paediatric 
patients (from 6 years of age) who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including 
primary nutrition therapy,and a corticosteroid and/or an immunomodulator, or who are intolerant to or 
have contraindications for such therapies." 
This new indication is currently pending a decision by the European Commission.

to adalimumab 40 mg eow. A total of 28 subjects received at least 1 dose of adalimumab in Study 
M13-687. The majority of subjects were male (57.1%) and the mean age was 33.6 years. The mean 
duration of Crohn's disease for these subjects was 8.61 years. The mean CDAI at Baseline was 308.4 
and approximately one-half of the subjects (46.4%) had severe Crohn's disease (baseline CDAI > 
300).

escalated dose to 80 mg adalimumab eow. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 28 patients were enrolled in M13-687 across 12 study sites in Japan and all patients received 
at least 1 dose of adalimumab. Of the 28 patients enrolled in the study, 18 (64.3%) patients 
completed the study and 10 (35.7%) patients discontinued from the study. The primary reason for 
discontinuation by these 10 patients was as follows: 3 (10.7%) patients discontinued because of an 
adverse event, 6 (21.4%) patients discontinued because of a lack of efficacy, and 1 (3.6%) patient 
discontinued for other reasons (use of concomitant prohibited medicine).  
Baseline Demographics:  
Of the 28 patients included in the efficacy analysis set, a majority were male (57.1%) and the mean 
age was 33.6 years (range: 17 to 51 years). There was only one patient (17 years old) under 18 years 
old.  The mean duration of CD at study entry was 8.61 years. The mean CDAI at Week 0 was 308.4 
and approximately one-half of patients (46.4%) had severe CD (CDAI > 300). The majority (89.3%) of 
patients had a Week 0 CRP level of ≥ 1.0 mg/dL. The mean duration of exposure to adalimumab at 
Week 0 was 1.27 years. 
Efficacy results 
The proportion of patients who achieved CR-50 at Week 8 was 75.0% (95% CI: 55.1%–89.3%) (non-
responder imputation [NRI]). The proportion of patients who achieved clinical remission (CDAI < 150) 
at Week 4 was 14.3% (4 of 28 patients) (NRI). The proportion increased through Week 24 and then 
was maintained through the end of the study (Week 52: 35.7% [10 of 28 patients]). The proportion of 
patients who achieved CR-50 at Week 4 was 67.9% (19 of 28 patients) (NRI). The proportion was

maintained through the end of the study (Week 52: 57.1%, 16 of 28 patients). The proportion of 
patients who achieved CR-70 at Week 4 was 46.4% (13 of 28 patients). The proportion increased over 
time through Week 24 and was maintained through the end of the study (Week 52: 57.1%, 16 of 28 
patients) (NRI). The proportion of patients who achieved CR-100 was 32.1% (9 of 28 patients) at 
Week 4. The proportion increased over time through Week 24 and was maintained through the end of 
the study (Week 52: 46.4%, 13 of 28 patients) (NRI). The mean change from Week 0 in CRP was –
0.570 mg/dL at Week 4. This mean decrease was maintained through the end of the study (range from 
–0.426 to -1.008 mg/dL) (last observation carried forward [LOCF]).  
CHMP's comment: 
The efficacy results are difficult to interpret as this is an open-label study. The effect of dose escalation 
of adalimumab (Humira®) in patients with Crohn´s disease seems to be clinically relevant for some 
patients.  
Safety results 
No deaths were reported in the study. A total of 8 patients (28.6%) experienced 11 treatment 
emergent serious adverse events (SAE). The most frequently reported SAE was Crohn's disease (4 of 
28 patients [14.3%]); all other SAEs were reported by 1 patient each (ileus, intestinal obstruction, 
small intestinal ulcer haemorrhage, subileus, anal abscess, pneumonia bacterial, and allergic 
transfusion reaction). All SAEs were moderate in severity and considered to have no reasonable 
possibility of being related to adalimumab, except for the SAE of pneumonia bacterial experienced by 1 
patient that the investigator considered to have a reasonable possibility of being related to 
adalimumab. Four patients (14.3%) discontinued from adalimumab because of an AE related to their 
Crohn's disease (Crohn’s disease [2 patients], ileus [1 patient] and subileus [1 patient]). The 
investigator considered these events to be serious and to have no reasonable possibility of being 
related to adalimumab. All treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) leading to discontinuation 
resolved after discontinuation. One patient under the age of 18 years old experienced a serious TEAE 
(intestinal obstruction of moderate severity with no reasonable possibility of being related to 
adalimumab). 
Among the categories of AEs of special interest (AESI) that were examined, the following results were 
observed:  
Infections: Nineteen patients (67.9%) reported infectious AEs; nasopharyngitis was the most 
frequently reported event. The majority of infectious AEs were mild, nonserious, and considered to 
have no reasonable possibility of being related to adalimumab. All of these events resolved. Two 
patients (7.1%) reported serious infectious AEs (pneumonia bacterial and anal abscess), both of which 
resolved. 
Immune reactions: Two patients (7.1%) reported events of allergic reaction (urticaria), which the 
investigator considered to be mild to moderate in severity, and nonserious. One event was considered 
to have a reasonable possibility of being related to adalimumab and the other event was considered to 
have no reasonable possibility of being related to adalimumab. Both events resolved.  
Gastrointestinal Disorders: One patient (3.6%) reported an event of intestinal stricture, which the 
investigator considered to be moderate in severity, serious, and to have no reasonable possibility of 
being related to adalimumab, attributing the event to the patient’s Crohn’s disease. The event 
resolved.

Hematologic disorders: Three patients (10.7%) reported hematologic disorders (anemia in 2 patients 
and leukopenia in 1 patient), which the investigator considered to be moderate in severity, nonserious, 
and to have no reasonable possibility of being related to adalimumab. All 3 events resolved. 
Liver failure and other liver events: One patient (3.6%) reported a liver failure and other liver events 
(hepatic function abnormal), which the investigator consider to be mild in severity, nonserious, and to 
have no reasonable possibility of being related to adalimumab. The event resolved.  
Injection site reactions: One patient (3.6%) reported an intermittent event of injection site reaction, 
which the investigator considered to be moderate in severity, nonserious, and to have a reasonable 
possibility of being related to adalimumab.  
In this study, no patients reported events of opportunistic infection.  
CHMP's comment: 
No new or unexpected safety events were identified. Of note, the paediatric subject (a 17 year old 
male subject) experienced a TEAE in form of an intestinal obstruction. This event is most likely related 
to the underlying disease. 
3.  Discussion on clinical aspects and CHMP’s overall 
conclusion and recommendation 
Study M13-687 was an open-label, non-comparative, post marketing study performed in Japan. The 
study evaluated the efficacy and safety of adalimumab dose escalation to 80 mg eow in patients with 
Crohn's disease who lost response to adalimumab 40 mg eow. For some patients losing response to 
40mg adalimumab (Humira®) eow, a dose escalation to 80 mg eow may be clinically meaningful. No 
new safety concerns were identified. The effect of adalimumab (Humira®) in patients with Crohn´s 
disease was generally as expected and no unexpected safety issues occurred. Only one paediatric 
patients was included in this trial. This patient experienced a TEAE in form of an intestinal obstruction 
which was likely related tol the underlying disease.  The presented data does not change the benefit 
risk for adalimumab in the paediatric approved indications. No changes are warranted in the SmPC. 
Overall conclusion 
The study report for Study M13-687 has been provided as requested according to Article 46 of 
Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. There were no unexpected findings.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in adult patients 
treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia 
and myelodysplastic syndromes). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Neulasta therapy should be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in oncology and/or 
haematology. 
Posology 
One 6 mg dose (a single pre-filled syringe) of Neulasta is recommended for each chemotherapy cycle, 
given at least 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy. 
Special populations 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Neulasta in children has not yet been established. Currently available data 
are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be made.

Patients with renal impairment 
No dose change is recommended in patients with renal impairment, including those with end-stage 
renal disease. 
Method of administration 
Neulasta is injected subcutaneously. The injections should be given into the thigh, abdomen or upper 
arm. 
For instructions on handling of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of granulocyte-colony stimulating factors (G-CSFs), the trade 
name of the administered product should be clearly recorded in the patient file. 
Limited clinical data suggest a comparable effect on time to recovery of severe neutropenia for 
pegfilgrastim to filgrastim in patients with de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) (see section 5.1). 
However, the long-term effects of pegfilgrastim have not been established in AML; therefore, it 
should be used with caution in this patient population. 
G-CSF can promote growth of myeloid cells in vitro and similar effects may be seen on some 
non-myeloid cells in vitro. 
The safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim have not been investigated in patients with myelodysplastic 
syndrome, chronic myelogenous leukaemia, and in patients with secondary AML; therefore, it should 
not be used in such patients. Particular care should be taken to distinguish the diagnosis of blast 
transformation of chronic myeloid leukaemia from AML. 
The safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim administration in de novo AML patients aged < 55 years with 
cytogenetics t(15;17) have not been established. 
The safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim have not been investigated in patients receiving high dose 
chemotherapy. This medicinal product should not be used to increase the dose of cytotoxic 
chemotherapy beyond established dosage regimens. 
Pulmonary adverse events 
Pulmonary adverse reactions, in particular interstitial pneumonia, have been reported after G-CSF 
administration. Patients with a recent history of pulmonary infiltrates or pneumonia may be at higher 
risk (see section 4.8). 
The onset of pulmonary signs such as cough, fever, and dyspnoea in association with radiological 
signs of pulmonary infiltrates, and deterioration in pulmonary function along with increased neutrophil 
count may be preliminary signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In such circumstances 
pegfilgrastim should be discontinued at the discretion of the physician and the appropriate treatment 
given (see section 4.8). 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Glomerulonephritis 
Glomerulonephritis has been reported in patients receiving filgrastim and pegfilgrastim. Generally, 
events of glomerulonephritis resolved after dose reduction or withdrawal of filgrastim and 
pegfilgrastim. Urinalysis monitoring is recommended. 
Capillary leak syndrome 
Capillary leak syndrome has been reported after G-CSF administration and is characterised by 
hypotension, hypoalbuminaemia, oedema and haemoconcentration. Patients who develop symptoms of 
capillary leak syndrome should be closely monitored and receive standard symptomatic treatment, 
which may include a need for intensive care (see section 4.8). 
Splenomegaly and splenic rupture 
Generally asymptomatic cases of splenomegaly and cases of splenic rupture, including some fatal 
cases, have been reported following administration of pegfilgrastim (see section 4.8). Therefore, 
spleen size should be carefully monitored (e.g. clinical examination, ultrasound). A diagnosis of 
splenic rupture should be considered in patients reporting left upper abdominal pain or shoulder tip 
pain. 
Thrombocytopenia and anaemia 
Treatment with pegfilgrastim alone does not preclude thrombocytopenia and anaemia because full 
dose myelosuppressive chemotherapy is maintained on the prescribed schedule. Regular monitoring of 
platelet count and haematocrit is recommended. Special care should be taken when administering 
single or combination chemotherapeutic agents which are known to cause severe thrombocytopenia. 
Myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia in breast and lung cancer patients 
In the post-marketing observational study setting, pegfilgrastim in conjunction with chemotherapy 
and/or radiotherapy has been associated with development of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and 
acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in breast and lung cancer patients (see section 4.8). Monitor breast 
and lung cancer patients for signs and symptoms of MDS/AML. 
Sickle cell anaemia 
Sickle cell crises have been associated with the use of pegfilgrastim in patients with sickle cell trait or 
sickle cell disease (see section 4.8). Therefore, physicians should use caution when prescribing 
pegfilgrastim in patients with sickle cell trait or sickle cell disease, should monitor appropriate clinical 
parameters and laboratory status and be attentive to the possible association of this medicine with 
splenic enlargement and vaso-occlusive crisis. 
Leukocytosis 
White blood cell (WBC) counts of 100 × 109/L or greater have been observed in less than 1% of 
patients receiving pegfilgrastim. No adverse events directly attributable to this degree of leukocytosis 
have been reported. Such elevation in white blood cells is transient, typically seen 24 to 48 hours after 
administration and is consistent with the pharmacodynamic effects of this medicine. Consistent with 
the clinical effects and the potential for leukocytosis, a WBC count should be performed at regular 
intervals during therapy. If leukocyte counts exceed 50 × 109/L after the expected nadir, this medicine 
should be discontinued immediately. 
Hypersensitivity 
Hypersensitivity, including anaphylactic reactions, occurring on initial or subsequent treatment have 
been reported in patients treated with pegfilgrastim. Permanently discontinue pegfilgrastim in patients 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with clinically significant hypersensitivity. Do not administer pegfilgrastim to patients with a history 
of hypersensitivity to pegfilgrastim or filgrastim. If a serious allergic reaction occurs, appropriate 
therapy should be administered, with close patient follow-up over several days. 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), which can be life-threatening or fatal, has been reported rarely in 
association with pegfilgrastim treatment. If the patient has developed SJS with the use of 
pegfilgrastim, treatment with pegfilgrastim must not be restarted in this patient at any time. 
Immunogenicity 
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. Rates of generation of 
antibodies against pegfilgrastim is generally low. Binding antibodies do occur as expected with all 
biologics; however, they have not been associated with neutralising activity at present. 
Aortitis 
Aortitis has been reported after G-CSF administration in healthy subjects and in cancer patients. The 
symptoms experienced included fever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain and increased inflammatory 
markers (e.g. c-reactive protein and white blood cell count). In most cases aortitis was diagnosed by 
CT scan and generally resolved after withdrawal of G-CSF. See also section 4.8. 
Other warnings 
The safety and efficacy of Neulasta for the mobilisation of blood progenitor cells in patients or healthy 
donors has not been adequately evaluated. 
The needle cap of the pre-filled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which may 
cause allergic reactions. 
Increased haematopoietic activity of the bone marrow in response to growth factor therapy has been 
associated with transient positive bone-imaging findings. This should be considered when interpreting 
bone-imaging results. 
Sorbitol 
The additive effect of concomitantly administered products containing sorbitol (or fructose) and 
dietary intake of sorbitol (or fructose) should be taken into account. 
Sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 6 mg dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Due to the potential sensitivity of rapidly dividing myeloid cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy‚ 
pegfilgrastim should be administered at least 24 hours after administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy. 
In clinical trials, Neulasta has been safely administered 14 days before chemotherapy. Concomitant 
use of Neulasta with any chemotherapy agent has not been evaluated in patients. In animal models 
concomitant administration of Neulasta and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or other antimetabolites has been 
shown to potentiate myelosuppression. 
Possible interactions with other haematopoietic growth factors and cytokines have not been 
specifically investigated in clinical trials. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The potential for interaction with lithium, which also promotes the release of neutrophils, has not been 
specifically investigated. There is no evidence that such an interaction would be harmful. 
The safety and efficacy of Neulasta have not been evaluated in patients receiving chemotherapy 
associated with delayed myelosuppression e.g. nitrosoureas. 
Specific interaction or metabolism studies have not been performed, however, clinical trials have not 
indicated an interaction of Neulasta with any other medicinal products. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of pegfilgrastim in pregnant women. Studies in 
animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Pegfilgrastim is not recommended during 
pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. 
Breast-feeding 
There is insufficient information on the excretion of pegfilgrastim/metabolites in human milk, a risk to 
the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue 
breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from pegfilgrastim therapy taking into account the benefit of 
breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
Pegfilgrastim did not affect reproductive performance or fertility in male or female rats at cumulative 
weekly doses approximately 6 to 9 times higher than the recommended human dose (based on body 
surface area) (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Pegfilgrastim has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions were bone pain (very common [≥ 1/10]) and 
musculoskeletal pain (common [≥ 1/100 to < 1/10]). Bone pain was generally of mild to moderate 
severity, transient and could be controlled in most patients with standard analgesics. 
Hypersensitivity-type reactions, including skin rash, urticaria, angioedema, dyspnoea, erythaema, 
flushing, and hypotension occurred on initial or subsequent treatment with pegfilgrastim (uncommon 
[≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100]). Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis can occur in patients 
receiving pegfilgrastim (uncommon) (see section 4.4). 
Capillary Leak Syndrome, which can be life-threatening if treatment is delayed, has been reported as 
uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100) in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy following 
administration of G-CSFs; see section 4.4 and section “Description of selected adverse reactions” 
below. 
Splenomegaly, generally asymptomatic, is uncommon. 
Splenic rupture including some fatal cases is uncommonly reported following administration of 
pegfilgrastim (see section 4.4).

Uncommon pulmonary adverse reactions including interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary oedema, 
pulmonary infiltrates and pulmonary fibrosis have been reported. Uncommonly, cases have resulted in 
respiratory failure or ARDS, which may be fatal (see section 4.4). 
Isolated cases of sickle cell crises have been reported in patients with sickle cell trait or sickle cell 
disease (uncommon in sickle cell patients) (see section 4.4).

2 This adverse reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance but not observed in randomised, controlled clinical 
trials in adults. The frequency category was estimated from a statistical calculation based upon 1 576 patients receiving 
Neulasta in nine randomised clinical trials. 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Uncommon cases of Sweet’s syndrome have been reported, although in some cases underlying 
haematological malignancies may play a role. 
Uncommon events of cutaneous vasculitis have been reported in patients treated with pegfilgrastim. 
The mechanism of vasculitis in patients receiving pegfilgrastim is unknown. 
Injection site reactions, including injection site erythaema (uncommon) as well as injection site pain 
(common) have occurred on initial or subsequent treatment with pegfilgrastim. 
Common cases of leukocytosis (White Blood Count [WBC] > 100 × 109/L) have been reported (see 
section 4.4). 
Reversible, mild to moderate elevations in uric acid and alkaline phosphatase, with no associated 
clinical effects, were uncommon; reversible, mild to moderate elevations in lactate dehydrogenase, 
with no associated clinical effects, were uncommon in patients receiving Neulasta following cytotoxic 
chemotherapy. 
Nausea and headaches were very commonly observed in patients receiving chemotherapy. 
Uncommon elevations in liver function tests (LFTs) for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST), have been observed in patients after receiving pegfilgrastim following 
cytotoxic chemotherapy. These elevations are transient and return to baseline. 
An increased risk of MDS/AML following treatment with Neulasta in conjunction with chemotherapy 
and/or radiotherapy has been observed in an epidemiological study in breast and lung cancer patients 
(see section 4.4). 
Common cases of thrombocytopenia have been reported. 
Cases of capillary leak syndrome have been reported in the post-marketing setting with G-CSF use. 
These have generally occurred in patients with advanced malignant diseases, sepsis, taking multiple 
chemotherapy medications or undergoing apheresis (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
The experience in children is limited. A higher frequency of serious adverse reactions in younger 
children aged 0-5 years (92%) has been observed compared to older children aged 6-11 and 
12-21 years respectively (80% and 67%) and adults. The most common adverse reaction reported was 
bone pain (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Single doses of 300 mcg/kg have been administered subcutaneously to a limited number of healthy 
volunteers and patients with non-small cell lung cancer without serious adverse reactions. The adverse 
events were similar to those in subjects receiving lower doses of pegfilgrastim.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: immunostimulants, colony stimulating factor; ATC Code: L03AA13 
Human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a glycoprotein, which regulates the 
production and release of neutrophils from the bone marrow. Pegfilgrastim is a covalent conjugate of 
recombinant methionyl human G-CSF (r-metHuG-CSF) with a single 20 kd polyethylene glycol 
(PEG) molecule. Pegfilgrastim is a sustained duration form of filgrastim due to decreased renal 
clearance. Pegfilgrastim and filgrastim have been shown to have identical modes of action, causing a 
marked increase in peripheral blood neutrophil counts within 24 hours, with minor increases in 
monocytes and/or lymphocytes. Similarly to filgrastim, neutrophils produced in response to 
pegfilgrastim show normal or enhanced function as demonstrated by tests of chemotactic and 
phagocytic function. As with other haematopoietic growth factors, G-CSF has shown in vitro 
stimulating properties on human endothelial cells. G-CSF can promote growth of myeloid cells, 
including malignant cells, in vitro and similar effects may be seen on some non-myeloid cells in vitro. 
In two randomised, double-blind, pivotal studies in patients with high-risk stage II-IV breast cancer 
undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin and docetaxel, use of 
pegfilgrastim, as a single once per cycle dose, reduced the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of 
febrile neutropenia similarly to that observed with daily administrations of filgrastim (a median of 
11 daily administrations). In the absence of growth factor support, this regimen has been reported to 
result in a mean duration of grade 4 neutropenia of 5 to 7 days, and a 30-40% incidence of febrile 
neutropenia. In one study (n = 157), which used a 6 mg fixed dose of pegfilgrastim the mean duration 
of grade 4 neutropenia for the pegfilgrastim group was 1.8 days compared with 1.6 days in the 
filgrastim group (difference 0.23 days, 95% CI -0.15, 0.63). Over the entire study, the rate of febrile 
neutropenia was 13% of pegfilgrastim-treated patients compared with 20% of filgrastim-treated 
patients (difference 7%, 95% CI of -19%, 5%). In a second study (n = 310), which used a 
weight-adjusted dose (100 mcg/kg), the mean duration of grade 4 neutropenia for the pegfilgrastim 
group was 1.7 days, compared with 1.8 days in the filgrastim group (difference 0.03 days, 95% CI 
-0.36, 0.30). The overall rate of febrile neutropenia was 9% of patients treated with pegfilgrastim and 
18% of patients treated with filgrastim (difference 9%, 95% CI of -16.8%, -1.1%). 
In a placebo-controlled, double-blind study in patients with breast cancer the effect of pegfilgrastim on 
the incidence of febrile neutropenia was evaluated following administration of a chemotherapy 
regimen associated with a febrile neutropenia rate of 10-20% (docetaxel 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 
4 cycles). Nine hundred and twenty-eight patients were randomised to receive either a single dose of 
pegfilgrastim or placebo approximately 24 hours (day 2) after chemotherapy in each cycle. The 
incidence of febrile neutropenia was lower for patients randomised to receive pegfilgrastim compared 
with placebo (1% versus 17%, p < 0.001). The incidence of hospitalisations and IV anti-infective use 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
associated with a clinical diagnosis of febrile neutropenia was lower in the pegfilgrastim group 
compared with placebo (1% versus 14%, p < 0.001; and 2% versus 10%, p < 0.001). 
A small (n = 83), phase II, randomised, double-blind study in patients receiving chemotherapy for de 
novo acute myeloid leukaemia compared pegfilgrastim (single dose of 6 mg) with filgrastim, 
administered during induction chemotherapy. Median time to recovery from severe neutropenia was 
estimated as 22 days in both treatment groups. Long-term outcome was not studied (see section 4.4). 
In a phase II (n = 37) multicentre, randomised, open-label study of paediatric sarcoma patients 
receiving 100 mcg/kg pegfilgrastim following cycle 1 of vincristine, doxorubicin and 
cyclophosphamide (VAdriaC/IE) chemotherapy, a longer duration of severe neutropenia (neutrophils 
< 0.5 × 109/L) was observed in younger children aged 0-5 years (8.9 days) compared to older children 
aged 6-11 years and 12-21 years (6 days and 3.7 days, respectively) and adults. Additionally a higher 
incidence of febrile neutropenia was observed in younger children aged 0-5 years (75%) compared to 
older children aged 6-11 years and 12-21 years (70% and 33%, respectively) and adults (see 
sections 4.8 and 5.2). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
After a single subcutaneous dose of pegfilgrastim, the peak serum concentration of pegfilgrastim 
occurs at 16 to 120 hours after dosing and serum concentrations of pegfilgrastim are maintained during 
the period of neutropenia after myelosuppressive chemotherapy. The elimination of pegfilgrastim is 
non-linear with respect to dose; serum clearance of pegfilgrastim decreases with increasing dose. 
Pegfilgrastim appears to be mainly eliminated by neutrophil-mediated clearance, which becomes 
saturated at higher doses. Consistent with a self-regulating clearance mechanism, the serum 
concentration of pegfilgrastim declines rapidly at the onset of neutrophil recovery (see figure 1).

Study Day 
GRH0005 v3 
Due to the neutrophil-mediated clearance mechanism, the pharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim is not 
expected to be affected by renal or hepatic impairment. In an open-label, single dose study (n = 31) 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
various stages of renal impairment, including end-stage renal disease, had no impact on the 
pharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim. 
Elderly 
Limited data indicate that the pharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim in elderly subjects (> 65 years) is 
similar to that in adults. 
Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim were studied in 37 paediatric patients with sarcoma, who 
received 100 mcg/kg pegfilgrastim after the completion of VAdriaC/IE chemotherapy. The youngest 
age group (0-5 years) had a higher mean exposure to pegfilgrastim (AUC) (± Standard Deviation) 
(47.9 ± 22.5 mcg·hr/mL) than older children aged 6-11 years and 12-21 years (22.0 ± 13.1 mcg·hr/mL 
and 29.3 ± 23.2 mcg·hr/mL, respectively) (see section 5.1). With the exception of the youngest age 
group (0-5 years), the mean AUC in paediatric subjects appeared similar to that for adult patients with 
high-risk stage II-IV breast cancer and receiving 100 mcg/kg pegfilgrastim after the completion of 
doxorubicin/docetaxel (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Preclinical data from conventional studies of repeated dose toxicity revealed the expected 
pharmacological effects including increases in leukocyte count, myeloid hyperplasia in bone marrow, 
extramedullary haematopoiesis and splenic enlargement. 
There were no adverse effects observed in offspring from pregnant rats given pegfilgrastim 
subcutaneously, but in rabbits pegfilgrastim has been shown to cause embryo/foetal toxicity (embryo 
loss) at cumulative doses approximately 4 times the recommended human dose, which were not seen 
when pregnant rabbits were exposed to the recommended human dose. In rat studies, it was shown that 
pegfilgrastim may cross the placenta. Studies in rats indicated that reproductive performance, fertility, 
oestrous cycling, days between pairing and coitus, and intrauterine survival were unaffected by 
pegfilgrastim given subcutaneously. The relevance of these findings for humans is not known.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Neulasta is and what it is used for 
Neulasta contains the active substance pegfilgrastim. Pegfilgrastim is a protein produced by 
biotechnology in bacteria called E. coli. It belongs to a group of proteins called cytokines, and is very 
similar to a natural protein (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor) produced by your own body. 
Neulasta is used to reduce the duration of neutropenia (low white blood cell count) and the occurrence 
of febrile neutropenia (low white blood cell count with a fever) which can be caused by the use of 
cytotoxic chemotherapy (medicines that destroy rapidly growing cells). White blood cells are 
important as they help your body fight infection. These cells are very sensitive to the effects of 
chemotherapy which can cause the number of these cells in your body to decrease. If white blood cells 
fall to a low level there may not be enough left in the body to fight bacteria and you may have an 
increased risk of infection. 
Your doctor has given you Neulasta to encourage your bone marrow (part of the bone which makes 
blood cells) to produce more white blood cells that help your body fight infection. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Neulasta 
Do not use Neulasta 
• 
if you are allergic to pegfilgrastim, filgrastim, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Neulasta: 
• 
• 
if you experience an allergic reaction including weakness, drop in blood pressure, difficulty 
breathing, swelling of the face (anaphylaxis), redness and flushing, skin rash and areas of the 
skin that itch. 
if you have an allergy to latex. The needle cap on the pre-filled syringe contains a derivative of 
latex and may cause severe allergic reactions. 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
if you experience a cough, fever and difficulty breathing. This can be a sign of Acute 
Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). 
if you have any of the following or combination of the following side effects: 
- 
swelling or puffiness, which may be associated with passing water less frequently, 
difficulty breathing, abdominal swelling and feeling of fullness, and a general feeling of 
tiredness. 
These could be symptoms of a condition called “Capillary Leak Syndrome” which causes blood 
to leak from the small blood vessels into your body. See section 4. 
if you get left upper abdominal pain or pain at the tip of your shoulder. This may be a sign of a 
problem with your spleen (splenomegaly). 
if you have recently had a serious lung infection (pneumonia), fluid in the lungs (pulmonary 
oedema), inflammation of the lungs (interstitial lung disease) or an abnormal chest x-ray (lung 
infiltration). 
if you are aware of any altered blood cell counts (e.g. increase in white blood cells or anaemia) 
or decreased blood platelet counts, which reduces the ability of your blood to clot 
(thrombocytopenia). Your doctor may want to monitor you more closely. 
if you have sickle cell anaemia. Your doctor may monitor your condition more closely. 
if you are a patient with breast cancer or lung cancer, Neulasta in combination with 
chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy may increase your risk of a precancerous blood 
condition called myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or a blood cancer called acute myeloid 
leukaemia (AML). Symptoms may include tiredness, fever, and easy bruising or bleeding. 
if you have sudden signs of allergy such as rash, itching or hives on the skin, swelling of the 
face, lips, tongue or other parts of the body, shortness of breath, wheezing or trouble breathing 
these could be signs of a severe allergic reaction. 
if you have symptoms of inflammation of aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood 
from the heart to the body), this has been reported rarely in cancer patients and healthy donors. 
The symptoms can include fever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain and increased 
inflammatory markers. Tell your doctor if you experience those symptoms. 
Your doctor will check your blood and urine regularly as Neulasta can harm the tiny filters inside your 
kidneys (glomerulonephritis). 
Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome) have been reported with the use of Neulasta. Stop 
using Neulasta and seek medical attention immediately if you notice any of the symptoms described in 
section 4. 
You should talk to your doctor about your risks of developing cancers of the blood. If you develop or 
are likely to develop cancers of the blood, you should not use Neulasta, unless instructed by your 
doctor. 
Loss of response to pegfilgrastim 
If you experience a loss of response or failure to maintain a response with pegfilgrastim treatment, 
your doctor will investigate the reasons why including whether you have developed antibodies which 
neutralise pegfilgrastim’s activity. 
Other medicines and Neulasta 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
28

are planning to have a baby. 
Unless your doctor directs you otherwise, you must stop breast-feeding if you use Neulasta. 
Driving and using machines 
Neulasta has no or negligible effect on the ability to drive or use machines. 
Neulasta contains sorbitol (E420) and sodium 
This medicine contains 30 mg sorbitol in each pre-filled syringe which is equivalent to 50 mg/mL. 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 6 mg dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
3.

Instructions for injecting with the Neulasta pre-filled syringe 
This section contains information on how to give yourself an injection of Neulasta. It is important that 
you do not try to give yourself the injection unless you have received training from your doctor, nurse, 
or pharmacist. If you have questions about how to inject, please ask your doctor, nurse, pharmacist for 
assistance. 
How do you, or the person injecting you, use Neulasta pre-filled syringe? 
You will need to give yourself the injection into the tissue just under the skin. This is known as a 
subcutaneous injection. 
Equipment that you need 
To give yourself a subcutaneous injection you will need: 
• 
• 
a pre-filled syringe of Neulasta; and 
alcohol wipes or similar.

What should I do before I give myself a subcutaneous injection of Neulasta? 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
6. 
Remove from the refrigerator. 
Do not shake the pre-filled syringe. 
Do not remove the cap from the syringe until you are ready to inject. 
Check the expiry date on the pre-filled syringe label (EXP). Do not use it if the date has passed 
the last day of the month shown. 
Check the appearance of Neulasta. It must be a clear and colourless liquid. If there are particles 
in it, you must not use it. 
For a more comfortable injection, let the pre-filled syringe stand for 30 minutes to reach room 
temperature or hold the pre-filled syringe gently in your hand for a few minutes. Do not warm 
Neulasta in any other way (for example, do not warm it in a microwave or in hot water). 
7.  Wash your hands thoroughly. 
8. 
Find a comfortable, well-lit, clean surface and put all the equipment you need within reach. 
How do I prepare my Neulasta injection? 
Before you inject Neulasta you must do the following: 
1. 
Hold the syringe barrel and gently take the cap from the 
needle without twisting. Pull straight as shown in pictures 1 
and 2. Do not touch the needle or push the plunger. 
2. 
You may notice a small air bubble in the pre-filled syringe. You do not have to remove the air 
bubble before injecting. Injecting the solution with the air bubble is harmless. 
3. 
You can now use the pre-filled syringe. 
Where should I give my injection? 
The most suitable places to inject yourself are: 
• 
• 
If someone else is injecting you, they can also use the back of your arms. 
the top of your thighs; and 
the abdomen, except for the area around the navel.

injection site. If needed, you may cover the injection site with a plaster.

help and advice.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for avelumab, the scientific conclusions 
of PRAC are as follows: 
Patients with pre-existing autoimmune disease 
In view of available data on immune-related adverse reactions in patients with pre-existing autoimmune 
disease from the literature, and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC Rapporteur 
considers a causal relationship between avelumab and an increased risk of immune-related adverse 
reaction in patients with pre-existing autoimmune disease is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC 
concluded that the product information of products containing avelumab should be amended accordingly. 
Sarcoidosis 
In view of available data on sarcoidosis from clinical trials, the literature and spontaneous reports 
including in some cases a close temporal relationship, and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the 
PRAC considers a causal relationship between avelumab and sarcoidosis is at least a reasonable 
possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing avelumab should be 
amended accordingly. 
Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and 
grounds for recommendation. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for avelumab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing avelumab is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

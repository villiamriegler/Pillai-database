CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Xadago is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD) as 
add-on therapy to a stable dose of levodopa (L-dopa) alone or in combination with other PD medicinal 
products in mid-to late-stage fluctuating patients.  
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Treatment with safinamide should be started at 50 mg per day. This daily dose may be increased to 
100 mg/day on the basis of individual clinical need.  
If a dose is missed the next dose should be taken at the usual time the next day. 
Elderly 
No change in dose is required for elderly patients. 
Experience of use of safinamide in patients over 75 years of age is limited.

Hepatic impairment 
Safinamide use in patients with severe hepatic impairment is contraindicated (see section 4.3). No 
dose adjustment is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment. The lower dose of 50 mg/day is 
recommended for patients with moderate hepatic impairment. If patients progress from moderate to 
severe hepatic impairment safinamide should be stopped (see section 4.4). 
Renal impairment 
No change in dose is required for patients with renal impairment. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of safinamide in children and adolescents under 18 years of age have not been 
established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
For oral use. 
Safinamide should be taken with water. 
Safinamide may be taken with or without food. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients (see section 6.1).  
Concomitant treatment with other monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Concomitant treatment with pethidine (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2).  
Use in patients with albinism, retinal degeneration, uveitis, inherited retinopathy or severe progressive 
diabetic retinopathy (see sections 4.4 and 5.3). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
General warning 
In general, safinamide may be used with selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) at the lowest 
effective dose, with caution for serotoninergic symptoms. In particular, the concomitant use of 
safinamide and fluoxetine or fluvoxamine should be avoided, or if concomitant treatment is necessary 
these medicinal products should be used at low doses (see section 4.5). A washout period 
corresponding to 5 half-lives of the SSRI used previously should be considered prior to initiating 
treatment with safinamide. 
At least 7 days must elapse between discontinuation of safinamide and initiation of treatment with 
MAO inhibitors or pethidine (see section 4.3 and 4.5). 
When safinamide is co-administered with products that are BCRP substrates, please refer to the SmPC 
for that particular medicinal product. 
Hepatic impairment 
Caution should be exercised when initiating treatment with safinamide in patients with moderate 
hepatic impairment. In case patients progress from moderate to severe hepatic impairment, treatment 
with  safinamide should be stopped (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5.2).  
Potential for retinal degeneration in patients with prior history of retinal disease  
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Safinamide should not be administered to patients with ophthalmological history that would put them 
at increased risk for potential retinal effects (e.g., family history of hereditary retinal disease, or 
history of uveitis) see sections 4.3 and 5.3. 
Impulse control disorders (ICDs)  
Impulse control disorders can occur in patients treated with dopamine agonists and/or dopaminergic 
treatments. Some reports of ICDs have also been observed with other MAO-inhibitors. Safinamide 
treatment has not been associated with any increase in the appearance of ICDs.  
Patients and carers should be made aware of the behavioural symptoms of ICDs that were observed in 
patients treated with MAO-inhibitors, including cases of compulsions, obsessive thoughts, 
pathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, impulsive behaviour and compulsive 
spending or buying. 
Dopaminergic side effects 
Safinamide used as an adjunct to levodopa may potentiate the side effects of levodopa, and pre-
existing dyskinesia may be exacerbated, requiring a decrease of levodopa. This effect was not seen 
when safinamide was used as an adjunct to dopamine agonists in early stage PD patients. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
In vivo and in vitro pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
MAO inhibitors and pethidine 
Safinamide must not be administered along with other MAO inhibitors (including moclobemide) as 
there may be a risk of non-selective MAO inhibition that may lead to a hypertensive crisis (see section 
4.3).  
Serious adverse reactions have been reported with the concomitant use of pethidine and MAO 
inhibitors. As this may be a class-effect, the concomitant administration of safinamide and pethidine is 
contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
There have been reports of medicinal product interactions with the concomitant use of MAO inhibitors 
and sympathomimetic medicinal products. In view of the MAO inhibitory activity of safinamide, 
concomitant administration of safinamide and sympathomimetics, such as those present in nasal and 
oral decongestants or cold medicinal products containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine, requires 
caution (see section 4.4). 
Dextromethorphan 
There have been reports of medicinal product interactions with the concomitant use of 
dextromethorphan and non-selective MAO inhibitors. In view of the MAO inhibitory activity of 
safinamide, the concomitant administration of safinamide and dextromethorphan is not recommended, 
or if concomitant treatment is necessary, it should be used with caution (see section 4.4). 
Antidepressants  
The concomitant use of safinamide and fluoxetine or fluvoxamine should be avoided (see section 4.4), 
this precaution is based on the occurrence of serious adverse reactions (e.g. serotonin syndrome), 
although rare, that have occurred when SSRIs and dextromethorphan have been used with MAO 
inhibitors. If necessary, the concomitant use of these medicinal products should be at the lowest 
effective dose. A washout period corresponding to 5 half-lives of the SSRI used previously should be 
considered prior to initiating treatment with safinamide. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Serious adverse reactions have been reported with the concomitant use of selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic/tetracyclic 
antidepressants and MAO inhibitors (see section 4.4). In view of the selective and reversible MAO-B 
inhibitory activity of safinamide, antidepressants may be administered but used at the lowest doses 
necessary. 
In vivo and in vitro pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Safinamide may transiently inhibit BCRP in vitro. In drug-drug-interaction studies in human, a weak 
interaction was observed with rosuvastatin (AUC increase between 1.25 and 2.00 fold) but no 
significant interaction was found with diclofenac.  
It is recommended to monitor patients when safinamide is taken with medicinal products that are 
BCRP substrates (e.g., rosuvastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, ciprofloxacin, methotrexate, topotecan, 
diclofenac or glyburide) and to refer to their SmPCs to determine if a dose adjustment is needed. 
Safinamide is almost exclusively eliminated via metabolism, largely by high capacity amidases that 
have not yet been characterized. Safinamide is eliminated mainly in the urine. In human liver 
microsomes (HLM), the N-dealkylation step appears to be catalysed by CYP3A4, as safinamide 
clearance in HLM was inhibited by ketoconazole by 90%.  
Safinamide inhibits OCT1 in vitro at clinically relevant portal vein concentrations. Therefore, caution 
is necessary when safinamide is taken concomitantly with medicinal products that are OCT1 
substrates and have a tmax similar to safinamide (2 hours) (e.g. metformin, aciclovir, ganciclovir) as 
exposure to these substrates might be increased as a consequence. 
The metabolite NW-1153 is a substrate for OAT3 at clinically relevant concentrations.  
Medicinal products that are inhibitors of OAT3 given concomitantly with safinamide may reduce 
clearance of NW-1153, i.e., and thus may increase its systemic exposure. The systemic exposure of 
NW-1153 is low (1/10 of parent safinamide). This potential increase is most likely of no clinical 
relevance as NW-1153, the first product in the metabolic pathway, is further transformed to secondary 
and tertiary metabolites.  
Paediatric population 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Safinamide should not be given to women of childbearing potential unless adequate contraception is 
practiced.  
Pregnancy  
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of safinamide in pregnant women. Studies in 
animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Xadago is not recommended during 
pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. 
Breast-feeding 
Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of safinamide in milk 
(for details see 5.3).  
A risk for the breast-fed child cannot be excluded. Xadago should not be used during breast-feeding. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fertility 
Animal studies indicate that  safinamide treatment is associated  with  adverse reactions  on female rat 
reproductive performance and sperm quality. Male rat fertility is not affected (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Somnolence and dizziness may occur during safinamide treatment, therefore  patients should be 
cautioned about using hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain 
that safinamide does not affect them adversely. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Dyskinesia was the most common adverse reaction reported in safinamide patients when used in 
combination with L-dopa alone or in combination with other PD treatments.  
Serious adverse reactions are known to occur with the concomitant use of SSRIs, SNRIs, 
tricyclic/tetracyclic antidepressants and MAO inhibitors, such as hypertensive crisis (high blood 
pressure, collapse), neuroleptic malignant syndrome (confusion, sweating, muscle rigidity, 
hyperthermia, CPK increase), serotonin syndrome (confusion, hypertension, muscle stiffness, 
hallucinations), and hypotension. With MAO-inhibitors there have been reports of drug interactions 
with concomitant use of sympathomimetic medicinal products.  
Impulse control disorders; pathological gambling, increased libido, hypersexuality, compulsive 
spending or buying, binge eating and compulsive eating can occur in patients treated with dopamine 
agonists and/or other dopaminergic treatments.

Description of selected adverse dreactions 
Dyskinesia occurred early in treatment, was rated “severe”, led to discontinuation in very few patients 
(approx. 1.5%), and did not require reduction of dose in any patient. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In one patient suspected of consuming more than the daily prescribed dose of 100 mg for one month, 
symptoms of confusion, sleepiness, forgetfulness and dilated pupils were reported. These symptoms 
resolved on discontinuing the medicinal product, without sequelae. 
The expected pattern of events or symptoms following intentional or accidental overdose with 
Safinamide would be those related to its pharmacodynamic profile: MAO-B inhibition with 
activity-dependent inhibition of Na+ channels. The symptoms of an excessive MAO-B inhibition 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(increase in dopamine level) could include hypertension, postural hypotension, hallucinations, 
agitation, nausea, vomiting, and dyskinesia.  
There is no known antidote to safinamide or any specific treatment for safinamide overdose. If an 
important overdose occurs, safinamide treatment should be discontinued and supportive treatment 
should be administered as clinically indicated.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic  group:  Anti-Parkinson-Drugs,  monoamine  oxidase  -B  inhibitors,  ATC  code: 
N04BD03.  
Mechanism of action 
Safinamide acts through both dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic mechanisms of action. Safinamide 
is a highly selective and reversible MAO-B inhibitor causing an increase in extracellular levels of 
dopamine in the striatum. Safinamide is associated with state-dependent inhibition of voltage-gated 
sodium (Na+) channels, and modulation of stimulated release of glutamate. To what extent the non-
dopaminergic effects contribute to the overall effect has not been established. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Population PK models developed from studies in patients with Parkinson’s disease indicate that the 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics effects of safinamide were not dependent on age, gender, 
weight, renal function and exposure to levodopa, indicating that dose adjustments will not be required 
based on these variables. 
Pooled analyses of adverse event data from placebo controlled studies in Parkinson’s disease patients 
indicate that the concomitant administration of safinamide together with a broad category of 
commonly used medicinal products in this patient population (antihypertensive, beta-blockers 
cholesterol lowering, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products, proton pump inhibitors, 
antidepressants, etc.) was not associated with an increased risk for adverse events. Studies were not 
stratified for co-medication, and no randomized interaction studies were performed for these medicinal 
products.  
Clinical efficacy 
Studies in mid- to late-stage PD patients 
The efficacy of safinamide as add-on treatment in mid-to late-stage PD (LSPD) patients with motor 
fluctuations, currently receiving L-dopa alone or in combination with other PD medicinal products, 
was evaluated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies: Study SETTLE (Study 27919; 50-100 
mg/day; 24 weeks), and Study 016/018 (50 and 100 mg/day; 2-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
study).  
The primary efficacy parameter was the change from baseline to endpoint in ‘ON Time without 
troublesome dyskinesia’.  
Secondary efficacy parameters included OFF Time, UPDRS II and III (Unified Parkinson’s Disease 
Rating Scale – sections II and III), and CGI-C (Clinical Global Impression of Change)  
Both the SETTLE and 016/018 studies indicated significant superiority of safinamide, compared to 
placebo, at the target doses of 50 and 100 mg/day for the primary, and selected secondary, efficacy 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
variables, as summarized in the table below. The effect on ON Time was maintained at the end of the 
24-month double-blind treatment period for both safinamide doses as compared to placebo.

Paediatric population 
The pharmacodynamic effects of safinamide have not been assessed in children and adolescents. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Safinamide absorption is rapid after single and multiple oral dosing, reaching Tmax in the time range 1.8-
2.8 h  after  dosing  under  fasting  conditions.  Absolute  bioavailability  is  high  (95%),  showing  that 
safinamide  is  almost  completely  absorbed  after  oral  administration  and  first  pass  metabolism  is 
negligible. The high absorption classifies safinamide as a highly permeable substance.  
Distribution 
The volume of distribution (Vss) is approximately 165 L which is 2.5-fold of body volume indicating 
extensive extravascular distribution of safinamide. Total clearance was determined to be 4.6 L/h 
classifying safinamide as a low clearance substance.  
Plasma protein binding of safinamide is 88-90%. 
Biotransformation 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In humans, safinamide is almost exclusively eliminated via metabolism (urinary excretion of 
unchanged safinamide was <10%) mediated principally through high capacity amidases, that have not 
yet been characterized. In vitro experiments indicated that inhibition of amidases in human 
hepatocytes led to complete suppression of the NW-1153 formation. Amidase present in blood, 
plasma, serum, simulated gastric fluid and simulated intestinal fluid as well as human 
carboxylesterases hCE-1 and hCE-2 are not responsible for the biotransformation of safinamide to 
NW-1153. The amidase FAAH was able to catalyse the formation of NW-1153 at low rates only. 
Therefore, other amidases are likely to be involved in the conversion to NW-1153. Safinamide’s 
metabolism is not dependent on Cytochrome P450 (CYP) based enzymes. 
Metabolite structure elucidation revealed three metabolic pathways of safinamide. The principal 
pathway involves hydrolytic oxidation of the amide moiety leading to the primary metabolite 
‘safinamide acid’ (NW-1153). Another pathway involves oxidative cleavage of the ether bond forming 
‘O-debenzylated safinamide’ (NW-1199). Finally the ‘N-dealkylated acid’ (NW-1689) is formed by 
oxidative cleavage of the amine bond of either safinamide (minor) or the primary safinamide acid 
metabolite (NW-1153) (major). The ‘N-dealkylated acid’ (NW-1689) undergoes conjugation with 
glucuronic acid yielding its acyl glucuronide. None of these metabolites are pharmacologically active. 
Safinamide does not appear to significantly induce or inhibit enzymes at clinically relevant systemic 
concentrations. In vitro metabolism studies have indicated that there is no meaningful induction or 
inhibition of cytochrome P450, CYP2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A3/5 at 
concentrations which are relevant (Cmax of free safinamide 0.4 µM at 100 mg/day) in man. Dedicated 
drug-drug interaction studies performed with ketoconazole, L-dopa and CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 
substrates (caffeine and midazolam), did not detect any clinically significant effects on the 
pharmacokinetics of safinamide, or L-dopa, caffeine and midazolam.  
A mass balance study showed that the plasma AUC0-24h of the unchanged 14C-safinamide accounted for 
approximately 30% of the total radioactivity AUC0-24h, indicative of an extensive metabolism.  
Transporters 
Preliminary  in  vitro  studies  have  shown  that  safinamide  is  not  a  substrate  for  the  transporters  P-gp, 
BCRP, OAT1B1, OAT1B3, OATP1A2 or OAT2P1. Metabolite NW-1153 is not a substrate for OCT2, 
or OAT1, but it is substrate for OAT3. This interaction has the potential to reduce the clearance of NW-
1153  and  increase  its  exposure;  however  the  systemic  exposure  of  NW-1153  is  low  (1/10  of  parent 
safinamide), and as it is metabolised to secondary and tertiary metabolites, it is unlikely to be of any 
clinical relevance.  
Safinamide transiently inhibits BCRP in the small intestine (see section 4.5). At concentrations of 
50µM, safinamide inhibited OATP1A2 and OATP2P1. The relevant plasma concentrations of 
safinamide are substantially lower, therefore a clinically relevant interaction with co-administered 
substrates of these transporters is unlikely. NW-1153 is not an inhibitor of OCT2, MATE1, or 
MATE2-K up to concentrations of 5µM. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
The pharmacokinetics of safinamide are linear after single and repeated doses. No time-dependency was 
observed. 
Elimination 
Safinamide undergoes almost complete metabolic transformation (<10% of the administered dose was 
found unchanged in urine). Substance-related radioactivity was largely excreted in urine (76%) and only 
to a low extent in faeces (1.5%) after 192 hours. The terminal elimination half-life of total radioactivity 
was approximately 80 hours.  
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The elimination half-life of safinamide is 20-30 hours. Steady-state is reached within one week. 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
Safinamide exposure in patients with mild hepatic disease increased marginally (30% in AUC), while 
in patients with moderate hepatic impairment exposure increased by approximately 80% (see section 
4.2). 
Patients with renal impairment 
Moderate  or  severe  renal  impairment  did  not  alter  the  exposure  to  safinamide,  compared  to  healthy 
subjects (see section 4.2).  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Retinal degeneration was observed in rodents after repeated safinamide dosing resulting in systemic 
exposure below the anticipated systemic exposure in patients given the maximal therapeutic dose. No 
retinal degeneration was noted in monkeys despite higher systemic exposure than in rodents or in 
patients at the maximum human dose. 
Long-term studies in animals have shown convulsions (1.6 to 12.8 times human clinical exposure, 
based on plasma AUC). Liver hypertrophy and fatty changes were seen only in rodent livers at 
exposures similar to humans. Phospholipidosis was seen mainly in the lungs in rodents (at exposures 
similar to humans) and monkeys (at exposures greater than 12 fold higher than human). 
Safinamide did not present genotoxic potential in in vivo and in several in vitro systems using bacteria 
or mammalian cells.  
The results obtained from carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats showed no evidence of tumorigenic 
potential related to safinamide at systemic exposures up to 2.3 to 4.0 times respectively, the 
anticipated systemic exposure in patients given the maximal therapeutic dose.  
Fertility studies in female rats showed reduced number of implantations and corpora lutea at exposures 
in excess of 3 times the anticipated human exposure. Male rats showed minor abnormal morphology 
and reduced speed of sperm cells at exposures in excess of 1.4 times the anticipated human exposure. 
Male rat fertility was not affected. 
In embryo-foetal developmental studies in rats and rabbits malformations were induced at safinamide 
exposures 2 and 3-fold above human clinical exposure, respectively. The combination of safinamide 
with levodopa/carbidopa resulted in additive effects in the embryo-foetal development studies with a 
higher incidence of foetal skeletal abnormalities than seen with either treatment alone.  
In a pre- and postnatal developmental rat study, pup mortality, absence of milk in the stomach and 
neonatal hepatotoxicity were observed at dose levels similar to the anticipated clinical exposure. Toxic 
effects on the liver and accompanying symptoms as yellow/orange skin and skull, in pups exposed to 
safinamide during lactation are mediated mainly via in utero exposure, whereas exposure via the 
mother’s milk had only a minor influence.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Xadago is and what it is used for 
Xadago is a medicine that contains the active substance safinamide. It acts to increase the level of a 
substance called dopamine in the brain, which is involved in the control of movement and is present in 
reduced amounts in the brain of patients with Parkinson’s disease. Xadago is used for the treatment of 
Parkinson’s disease in adults.  
In mid- to late-stage patients experiencing sudden switches between being “ON” and able to move and 
being “OFF” and having difficulties moving about, Xadago is added to a stable dose of the medicine 
called levodopa alone or in combination with other medicines for Parkinson’s disease. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Xadago 
Do not take Xadago 
- 
- 
- 
- 
If you are allergic to safinamide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).  
If you are taking any of the following medicines: 
-  Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors such as selegiline, rasagiline, moclobemide, 
phenelzine, isocarboxazid, tranylcypromine (e.g. for treatment of Parkinson’s disease or 
depression, or used for any other condition).  
-  Pethidine (a strong pain killer).  
You must wait at least 7 days after stopping Xadago treatment before starting treatment with 
MAO inhibitors or pethidine. 
If you have been told that you have severe liver problems  
If you have an eye condition which might put you at risk of potential damage to your retina (the 
light sensitive layers at the back of your eyes), e.g. albinism (lack of pigment in your skin and 
eyes), retinal degeneration (loss of cells from light sensitive layer at the back of the eye), or 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
uveitis (inflammation inside of the eye), inherited retinopathy (inherited disorders of the vision), 
or severe progressive diabetic retinopathy (a progressive decrease of the vision due to diabetes). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor before taking Xadago

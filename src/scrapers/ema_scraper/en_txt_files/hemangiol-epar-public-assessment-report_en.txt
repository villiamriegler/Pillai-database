2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Infantile haemangioma (IH) are benign vascular tumours of childhood, characterised by endothelial 
cell proliferation. They occur in 3% to 10% of the population. Generally, these lesions are not 
detectable at birth but appear during the first 4 to 6 weeks of life. IHs exhibit a characteristic 
evolution with early rapid growth (proliferation) followed by a stabilisation period and a slow 
spontaneous involution. Known risk factors for the development of IH are: female gender (female to 
male ratio of 2.4:1), Caucasian ethnicity, low birth weight (especially <1500 g), and products of 
multiple gestations.  
Whilst most IH exhibit an uncomplicated clinical course, some are associated with complications 
that can be life-threatening (e.g. respiratory failure in airway IH, congestive heart failure in liver IH) 
or function-threatening. If left untreated, they can leave permanent sequelae which may trigger 
psychological morbidity. Although most are not worrisome, around 12% of IHs are significantly 
complex, requiring referral to specialists for consideration of treatment. 
IH are extremely heterogeneous in terms of size, location, risk of complication, rate of proliferation 
and involution, and results after involution. For this reason, there is no established severity 
classification and the decision to treat by systemic therapy is individualized, weighing therapeutic

risks against potential benefits. Currently, the first line treatment is corticosteroids (only authorised 
in France and Germany for severe cases), interferon alpha (IFN alpha) and vincristine are also used 
off-label as second line treatment. 
About the product 
Hemangiol is an oral solution of propranolol, a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor blocking 
agent. When access to beta-receptor sites is blocked by propranolol, the chronotropic, inotropic, 
and vasodilatator responses to beta-adrenergic stimulation are decreased proportionately. 
Consequently, propranolol is mainly proposed as antihypertensive treatment in humans. 
Propranolol has been used since 1960’s in adults for cardiovascular therapies and is commonly 
prescribed in several clinical situations, including control of hypertension, management of angina, 
prophylaxis of migraine, management of essential tremor, management of anxiety, adjunctive 
management of thyrotoxicosis, and prophylaxis of upper gastro-intestinal bleeding in patients with 
portal hypertension and oesophageal varices. In children, specific dosing recommendations have 
been established and its clinical use is accepted in several situations such as hypertension, 
arrhythmias, tetralogy of Fallot spells, hypertrophic myocardiopathy, and thyrotoxicosis.  
Propranolol is a well-known drug for which capsule and tablet formulations are approved in both the 
European Union (EU) and the United States (US) for use in adults. Since 2000, an oral solution 
(Syprol) was registered in the United Kingdom for the use in children for the treatment of 
arrhythmia, phaechromocytoma, thyrotoxicosis, migraine, and tetralogy of Fallot.  
The use of propranolol in the treatment of IH began after the publication by Leauté-Labrèze et al in 
2008, who discovered by chance the potential effect of this substance on IH: propranolol was 
administered to a child with a nasal capillary haemangioma (stabilised on corticosteroid) to treat an 
obstructive hypertrophic myocardiopathy; after treatment initiation haemangioma changed from 
intense red to purple, and it softened, and improvement was observed with no regrowth after 
corticosteroid discontinuation. 
The global clinical development plan for propranolol was designed and performed in line with 
recommendations made by both the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA), and comprises three clinical trials, including two Phase I PK studies and a 
pivotal Phase II/III study. In addition, at the request of the French Competent Authority (Agence 
Nationale de Sécurité du Médicament et des Produits de Santé [ANSM]), Study V00400 SB 301 was 
conducted to allow the continued use of propranolol in patients who had participated in a previous 
clinical trial, and for whom the investigator judged it clinically appropriate to continue treatment 
with oral propranolol. A Compassionate Use Program (CUP) is on-going in France. The first 
nominative authorisation (i.e. on a named patient basis) was approved on 13 Apr 2010 and was 
modified to a cohort authorisation in July 2012. Within the remit of the CUP, propranolol is 
prescribed to infants with proliferating high risk IH who could not be included in one of the ongoing 
clinical studies. In addition a CUP has been ongoing in Switzerland since February 2011. 
The development programme/compliance with CHMP guidance/scientific advice 
Scientific advice was obtained from the EMA on 19 February 2009 
(EMEA/H/SA/1222/1/2008/PED/III).  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/8171/2014 
Page 10/86 
 
  
  
 
The design for pivotal Study 201 was established in line with recommendations made by both the 
EMA and FDA during a Parallel Scientific Advice meeting. The study design was then discussed 
through a Special Protocol Assessment in the United States (US) and a paediatric investigation plan 
(PIP) in Europe.  
It was stated in the parallel advice EMA/FDA meeting minutes that the presence of a placebo control 
in the phase II/III pivotal study did not allow, for ethical reasons, the inclusion of high risk IH: life- 
or function-threatening and ulcerated IH [with pain and lack of response to simple wound care 
measures]. The FDA stated that the inclusion of IH patients of moderate severity would not preclude 
approval in patients with more severe lesions.  
The p-value for the Phase II/III pivotal study was adjusted to 0.005 in the statistical analysis plan, 
following advice from the FDA (letter dated 02 October 2009) that a single study with a robust 
p-value (<0.01) may be sufficient to allow approval based on a single trial.  
However, in order to provide supportive data on the efficacy of oral propranolol in high risk IH cases, 
selected studies investigating the treatment of high risk IH with oral propranolol reported in the 
literature have been included in the analysis of efficacy. In addition, some efficacy data are 
available for high risk IH cases in the CUP in terms of discontinuation of treatment due to good 
efficacy and follow-up data collected post-hoc for a subgroup of patients.  
According to ICH E1, there are several exceptions to the size of the safety database for an 
investigational drug that is generally accepted (approximately 1500 treated patients). A smaller 
number of patients may be accepted if there is already well-documented historical data available on 
a specific drug/drug class and if the population intended for treatment is small. Propranolol 
hydrochloride fulfils the former criterion, and the target IH population fulfils the latter (12% of 3 to 
10% of births, i.e. 0.36 to 1.2% of births).  
The safety analysis submitted is composed of data from more than 2451 patients treated with 
propranolol from the following sources:  
1. 
Frequency of adverse events (AEs) from the pooled database (Studies 201 and 102): 424 
patients with IH treated with propranolol for up to 24 weeks.  
2. 
Cumulative safety analysis from the CUP in France (660 patients) including non-serious 
reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs).  
3. 
Presentation of all serious adverse events (SAEs) from Studies 201, 102, 301 and from the 
CUP.  
4. 
Literature review of 60 scientific publications (involving 1367 patients with IH treated with 
propranolol) of which individual case reports have been extracted from 39 publications 
(involving 623 patients with IH treated with propranolol) and reported in a narrative form.  
The PIP was approved by the Paediatric Committee of the EMA on 27 October 2010 and followed by 
4 amendments. The following completed studies were checked for compliance: quality measures, 
V00400 SB 101 2A, V00400 SB 201, Pharmacokinetic study in paediatric population. The PDCO 
adopted on 8 February 2013 an opinion confirming the compliance of all studies in the agreed 
paediatric investigation plan as set out in the Agency's Decision (P/0004/2013) of 21 January 2013.

especially in toxicology, are old and were not conducted according to GLP standards. The single new 
toxicology study in juvenile rats has been conducted with Hemangiol in compliance with GLP. There 
is a deviation in the acceptable criteria of Quality Controls for the dosage of the cardiac biomarkers 
(in the range 50-150% instead of 75-125%). Information on the use of computer systems has been 
provided  
GCP: all clinical studies were conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, with the 
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki in effect at the time and following Good Clinical Practice. 
A routine GCP inspection has been conducted for the pivotal clinical trial (study V00400 SB 201)

It is to be initiated in infants aged 5 weeks to 5 months (see section 4.2). 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Hemangiol is presented as an oral solution containing propranolol in the form of hydrochloride salt, 
as the active substance. Each ml of the solution contains 3.75 mg of propranolol. 
Other ingredients used in the formulation are hydroxyethylcellulose, saccharin sodium, strawberry 
flavour (contains propylene glycol), vanilla flavour (contains propylene glycol), citric acid and 
purified water. 
The solution is packed in an amber-glass bottle fitted with a low density polyethylene (LDPE) insert 
and a child resistant polypropylene (PP) screw cap, provided with a polypropylene (PP) oral syringe 
graduated in mg of propranolol. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Propranolol (as propranolol hydrochloride) is chemically designated as 
(2RS)-1-[(1-methylethyl)amino]-3-(naphthalen-1-yloxy)propan-2-ol hydrochloride and has the 
following structure: 
It is a white to off-white powder, soluble in water and alcohol, slightly soluble in chloroform, 
practically insoluble in ether. The substance melts between 163°C and 166°C. It is produced as 
racemic mixture of R and S enantiomers. 
As there is a monograph of propranolol hydrochloride in the European Pharmacopoeia, the 
manufacturer of the active substance has been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the European 
Pharmacopoeia (CEP) for propranolol hydrochloride which has been provided within the current 
Marketing Authorisation Application. 
Manufacture 
Propranolol hydrochloride is well known active substance, described in the Ph. Eur. The chemistry, 
manufacturing and control information on propranolol hydrochloride has been evaluated by the 
European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines (EDQM) and a CEP has been issued. A copy of the 
CEP has been provided. In addition the holder of the certificate has declared the absence of use of 
materials of human or animal origin in the manufacturing process of propranolol hydrochloride. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/8171/2014 
Page 13/86 
 
 
  
  
 
Specification 
The drug substance complies with the Ph. Eur. monograph specifications. No additional tests, apart 
those listed in the Ph. Eur. monograph were required by the CEP. It has been confirmed that only 
impurities listed in the monograph may be present in the active substance and no additional 
impurity is specified in the CEP from the manufacturer. 2-propanol is declared in the CEP as the 
solvent used in the last steps of the synthesis and controlled by an appropriate limit. Analytical 
procedures for control of the active substance are the same as the one described in the Ph. Eur. 
monograph. 
Batch analysis data of the three batches of propranolol hydrochloride were provided. The results 
were within the specification limits, consistent from batch to batch and demonstrated compliance 
with the Ph. Eur. monograph for this substance. 
Stability 
The retest period and type of the container for storing the substance are also included in the 
certificate. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The objective of the product development was to obtain an oral solution with a concentration of the 
active substance of 3.75mg/ml, specially designed for administration to paediatric population. 
The development of the formulation is well described. The applicant has adopted a systematic risk 
based approach in optimising the product attributes to meet the target quality profile. In 
accordance with ICH Q8 (R2) the following steps were followed: 
•  definition of the Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) as it relates to quality, safety and 
efficacy,  
• 
identification of potential Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) of the finished product, so that 
those product characteristics having an impact on product quality can be studied and 
controlled  
•  determination of critical quality attributes of the active substance and selection of the 
appropriate excipients to deliver finished product of the desired quality,  
•  selection of an appropriate manufacturing process,  
•  definition of a control strategy to guarantee the quality of the finished product. 
Taste was considered an important finished product characteristic in view of the target population, 
which includes infants. Therefore formulation development focused on the excipients selection 
(texturing agent, pH adjustment agent, sweetening agent, preservative) and the flavouring of the 
product as propranolol is a bitter active substance. The choice and role of each excipient was 
appropriately justified. There are no novel excipients or excipient of human or animal origin used in 
the formulation. All excipients are compendial substances and comply with relevant Ph. Eur. 
monographs, except for the flavours. The flavours are food grade according to Regulation (EC) No 
1334/2008, have an approved regulatory status and are considered GRAS (Generally Recognized as 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/8171/2014 
Page 14/86 
 
  
  
 
Safe). Flavours are solubilised in propylene glycol. The percentage of propylene glycol which is 
brought by the strawberry and vanilla flavours is equal to 0.26% (m/V). Taking into account the 
maximal daily dose of 3 mg/kg and the concentration of the solution of 3.75 mg/ml, the maximal 
daily volume of the oral solution is 0.8 ml/kg which represents a maximal intake of propylene glycol 
at level 2.08 mg/kg/day. This is in accordance with the reflection paper: “Formulations of choice for 
the paediatric population” where it is recommended that “products containing high levels of 
propylene glycol should not be administered to paediatric patients below the age of 4 years”.  
An evaluation of the taste masking efficiency of the bitterness of propranolol was performed by the 
methodology of the electronic tongue. The results demonstrated around ≈80% masking effect 
compared to the reference in water. It addition, it has been confirmed that neither signals of poor 
acceptability nor premature treatment discontinuation were observed for reasons of taste during 
clinical studies. Furthermore the applicant clarified that the acceptability (including palatability) 
assessments cannot be added to any on-going study, since the treatment period is completed. 
However, the collection of such data will be considered in future clinical studies. 
The use of preservative was found to be unnecessary. Microbiological studies performed on the 
formulation with and without preservative allowed the removal of the sodium propionate (used in 
clinical trial formulations) from the commercial formulation due to the concentration of propranolol 
in the formula and the antimicrobial properties of propranolol. 
According to the SmPC section 4.2, the product may be diluted in a small quantity of milk, apple or 
orange juice. Compatibility studies were performed with the finished product diluted in the milk and 
in the juice to support the claim. 
The product is presented with a measuring device (oral syringe). Justification of the choice of the 
measuring  device  has  been  provided.  Graduation  scale  has  been  validated  with  the  finished 
product. Dosing accuracy and precision over the graduation range have also been demonstrated.  
Adventitious agents 
None of the excipients used for Hemangiol are of animal or human origin. 
Manufacture of the Product 
The manufacturing process is standard. The product is manufactured by dissolving the components 
sequentially, followed by clarification, filling and capping. The process was subject to a risk 
assessment and the manufacturing steps considered to impact critical quality attributes were 
evaluated. For each manufacturing step, the in-process controls are defined to monitor the 
compliance of the process. 
Suitable batch analysis data was provided on five batches of the product manufactured in the 
proposed commercial scale. The results indicated that the manufacturing process was reproducible 
and provides product that complies with the in-process and finished product specifications. 
The process validation studies will be conducted on 3 production-scale batches at each of the 
proposed manufacturing sites. A satisfactory commercial scale validation scheme has been 
presented. This approach is acceptable as the manufacturing process is standard.

Product Specification 
The product specification is conventional and includes tests for organoleptic characteristics (colour, 
clarity and odour), identification of the active substance by retention time and UV-spectrum, 
microbial contamination, pH, deliverable volume, purity (degradation products by HPLC) and 
content of the active substances (HPLC). The release and shelf-life specifications are identical with 
the exception of the pH limit. 
The specification has been established based on development history, manufacturing history and on 
the results from the on-going ICH stability programme. Analytical methods and proposed 
acceptance criteria were established in accordance with the guidance ICH Q6A “Test Procedures 
and Acceptance Criteria for New Drug Substances and New Drug Products: Chemical Substances”. 
Analytical methods were adequately validated. 
Batch analysis data have been provided on five commercial scale batches from the proposed 
commercial manufacturing sites, demonstrating compliance with the proposed release 
specification. It has been demonstrated that the finished product specification is suitable to control 
the quality of the product. 
Stability of the Product 
Stability data on five commercial scale batches, manufactured at the proposed manufacturing sites 
and scales were provided. The conditions used in the stability studies are in accordance with the ICH 
stability guideline. Data on up to 24 months of long term (25°C/60% RH) and intermediate 
(30°C/75% RH) and 6 months of accelerated (40°C/75% RH) storage conditions were provided. 
Samples were tested for organoleptic characteristics, pH, degradation products, microbial purity, 
assay, efficacy of preservation. The analytical procedures used were stability indicating and these 
were the same analytical methods as used for release of the finished product. 
Stability testing included also forced degradation study. The product was exposed to elevated 
temperatures (heat stress), freezing and cooling (refrigerator conditions). In addition a 
photostability study was performed in accordance with ICHQ1B. Freezing of the bottle and its 
contents resulted in breakage. It has been concluded that the finished product cannot be stored in 
the freezer and a specific labelling recommendation “Do not freeze” was included in the product 
information. No physical, organoleptic or chemical changes were noted during the storage in 
refrigerator. It has been concluded that storage of the finished product in refrigerator is allowed. 
Furthermore, an appropriate in-use testing has been carried out to demonstrate that the product 
could be used for 2 months after opening without special storage conditions. Since stability studies 
are on-going the applicant was not able to provide results from the in-use testing at the end of 
shelf-life. As the microbiological quality of the product was studied under simulated in-use 
conditions at release and during stability at different check points, sufficient evidence was gathered 
to support the extrapolation of the in-use stability at the end of shelf-life. Nevertheless the applicant 
was recommended to perform the in-use stability study at the end of shelf-life of the finished 
product. In addition, the applicant was recommended to confirm the efficacy of antimicrobial 
preservation (Ph. Eur. 5.1.3) under simulated in-use conditions at the end of shelf-life of the 
finished product. The applicant agreed with both recommendations from the Committee.

The overall stability data for Hemangiol oral solution proved that the product is stable under tested 
conditions. The results generated during the stability studies support the proposed shelf-life and 
storage conditions as defined in the SmPC. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of Hemangiol oral solution has been adequately established. In general, satisfactory 
chemical and pharmaceutical documentation has been submitted in support of the marketing 
authorisation application. 
The quality of the active substance (propranolol hydrochloride) is assured by a European Certificate 
of Suitability of the Monograph of the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP). 
The pharmaceutical development of the finished product has been satisfactorily described. The 
excipients are well established compendial substances and used in acceptable quantities. Their 
function has been satisfactorily described. Formulation development was focussed on producing a 
dosage form with appropriate dosing flexibility for administration of the product to young children. 
Aspects relating to the acceptability and palatability of the formulation were appropriately 
addressed during development. 
The method of manufacture is considered standard and has been satisfactorily described, including 
in-process tests. The data shows consistent manufacture and is considered sufficient for this 
manufacturing process. A satisfactory validation protocol has been provided. 
The proposed specifications were justified based on the batch and stability results, and are in 
general adequate for assuring the product quality and therefore were accepted.  
The stability program is considered satisfactory. The batches placed on stability are considered 
representative of the product to be marketed. The results generated during the stability studies 
support the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as defined in the SmPC. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
The quality of the product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the 
conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform 
clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory 
manner. There are no unresolved quality issues, which have a negative impact on the Benefit Risk 
balance of the product. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the applicants to take due account of technical and scientific 
progress, the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
•  To perform the in-use stability study at the end of shelf-life of the finished product (36 
months). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/8171/2014 
Page 17/86 
 
  
  
 
•  To perform the test of efficacy of antimicrobial preservation (Ph. Eur. 5.1.3) under simulated 
in-use conditions at the end of shelf-life of the finished product (36 months). 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Propranolol is a well-known product with a long-term experience in clinical use, for more than 40 
years in adults but also in children. Therefore, the use of the new oral liquid formulation of 
propranolol hydrochloride in infants, Hemangiol, is supported by a review of updated published non 
clinical studies in adult and juvenile animals. Moreover, the applicant conducted a GLP toxicity study 
in juvenile rats with an oral administration of the new formulation. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Some in vivo experimental models of haemangioma were established to study the pathogenesis of 
haemangioma. These animal models generally corresponded to human haemangioma tissue 
implanted into immunodeficient mice.  
However, the applicant did not perform any pharmacodynamic studies in these models to support a 
proof-of-concept for the treatment of IH with propranolol due to: 
- technical difficulties: these models are difficult to establish, need a lot of experience and are only 
proposed in few research universities in US or China and have not been validated so far by 
pharmacological interventions; 
- the availability, at the start of development, of numerous published clinical data reporting 
successful treatment of IH with propranolol. 
The pathogenesis of infantile haemangioma remains poorly understood; the neovascularisation and 
angiogenesis are probably involved. The potential mechanisms of action of propranolol described in 
the literature in proliferating IH could include: 
1. a local haemodynamic effect (vasoconstriction and decrease of IH lesion perfusion) 
2. an antiangiogenic effect (decrease expression of VEGF and bFGF by blocking the mitogen 
activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Raf activation or the Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF) 
pathway. 
3. an aptotosis triggering effect on capillary endothelial cells.

The mechanism of action of propranolol in IH was investigated using experimental models and this 
is summarised thereafter in the Table 1.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The main pharmacological effect of propranolol not related to its desired therapeutic target and 
submitted by the applicant in the IH is the hypoglycaemic effect (see Table 2).  
In fasted rats, an intraperitoneal injection of insulin produced a moderate hypoglycaemic effect, 
which was significantly enhanced by the SC administration of propranolol. However, propranolol did 
not alter blood sugar levels when tested alone. According to the authors, propranolol, by 
β-adrenergic blockade, may interfere with glycogenolytic and lipolytic actions of catecholamine 
liberated in response to hypoglycaemia, thereby counteracting normal homeostatic mechanisms 
involved in returning blood sugar to normal levels. Another possibility is that propranolol released 
endogenous insulin as shown in isolated perfused rat pancreas, whereby propranolol could act 
synergistically with insulin at its site of action to promote increased glucose uptake by muscles. 
Moreover, the effects of propranolol were consistent with antagonism of the beta-adrenergic effect 
of circulating adrenaline.

Safety pharmacology programme 
The hERG test is positive but there is a safety margin of 534 for infants at 3 mg/kg/d of propranolol. 
There is no effect of the propranolol on the QTc in vivo1. At toxic doses, propranolol may cause 
bronchospasm, and induce increased airway resistance, especially in asthmatic patients2. There are 
no effects on nervous central system detected in the juvenile toxicity study with propranolol.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No additional pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies in animals were considered necessary. In 
the absence of specific drug interaction studies in children, the drug interactions with propranolol 
are those known in adults and described in details in the SmPC of the product. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The applicant reviewed published data in relation to the pharmacokinetics (PK) of propranolol. 
However most of the studies were performed in mature animals. In addition, the Applicant 
conducted a toxicity study in juvenile rats in which toxicokinetic evaluation was performed. 
The non-clinical PK data from the literature indicate that propranolol is rapidly and almost 
completely absorbed after oral administration in animal (adult rat, dog and monkey and juvenile rat 
between PND4 and PND21) and in human. The absolute bioavailability is weak, 8 to 25% in rat, 27 
% in dog and 3 % in monkey due to an extensive first pass metabolism by the liver. Peak plasma 
concentration is reached about 1 hour after dosing and is independent of the administered dose. 
High concentrations of drug-related radioactivity were found in the lungs, and relatively high 
concentrations were also found in the brain, the liver and the kidneys. After administration 
of 14C-propranolol at 1mg/kg per os in dogs, about 2 µg/g in lung, 0.40 µg/g in brain and kidney, 
0.70 µg/g in liver of 14C-propranolol found 1 hour after dose. This radioactivity became negligible 
after 8h post dose. This distribution profile is in agreement with the distribution characteristics of a 
lipophilic drug. The binding of propranolol to plasma proteins is 92.2% in rat, 96.6% in dog, 99.2% 
in monkey, and is 93.9% in human.

From the literature, in vitro data in S9 fraction of rats and human liver microsomes, as well as in 
vivo data in rats indicate that propranolol is extensively metabolized through three primary routes: 
ring hydroxylation, side-chain oxidation and direct glucuronidation. In vivo studies show some 
interspecies differences in propranolol metabolism. In the rat, ring hydroxylation is predominant, 
while side-chain oxidation is predominant in the dog. In both species a majority of propranolol 
metabolites are recovered in urine as glucuronides. In human, it was estimated that these routes of 
metabolism accounted for 42%, 41% and 17% of the total metabolism, respectively. Moreover, the 
4-hydroxy-propranolol active metabolite was quantified, its plasma exposure accounting for less 
than 7% of the parent drug exposure. 
In vitro studies indicate that the ring hydroxylation is catalysed mainly by CYP2D6. The side-chain 
oxidation is mediated by CYP1A2 and to some extent by CYP2D6. Propranolol is a substrate of 
CYP2C19, with a negligible contribution to the side-chain oxidation. 
Data from the literature indicate that the excretion route and rate of propranolol are similar in 
non-clinical species and in human. A majority of a propranolol dose is excreted in urine within 24 
hours after oral administration, mostly as metabolites. The urinary excretion of propranolol is 
around 68%, 80% and 70% in rat, dog and monkey, respectively, and 90% in human. 
In vitro data from the literature indicate that P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is not a major determinant of 
propranolol disposition and that propranolol has a limited potential to be an inhibitor of the P-gp.  
In vitro investigations on cytochromes P-450 (CYP) evidenced a potential for propranolol to be a 
weak inhibitor of CYP1A2 and moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6. This CYP2D6 inhibition potential has no 
consequences on in vivo drug-drug interactions, propranolol is not mentioned as a CYP2D6 inhibitor 
in different health authorities’ drug-drug interaction database (e.g. FDA drug development and 
drug interaction: table of substrates, inhibitors and inducers). 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Acute toxicity of propranolol is poorly documented in animals, lethal doses 50 (LD50) are only 
reported in mice by several routes of administration: oral (565 mg/kg), IV (22-35 mg/kg), and IP 
(107 mg/kg). 
At toxic doses, propranolol may cause bronchospasm, and induce increased airway resistance, 
especially in asthmatic patients. The primary cause of death related to propranolol administration at 
toxic doses in the spontaneously breathing rat, is respiratory failure followed by cardiovascular 
failure. Thus, the central and not the peripheral beta-blocker activity seems to be the most 
important factor for inducing death3.

Repeat dose toxicity 
Very few repeat-dose toxicity studies conducted with propranolol were identified in the literature. 
These studies were carried out only in rodents, more than 20 years ago. These studies were not GLP 
compliant. No plasma exposure to propranolol was available under the experimental conditions of 
these studies.

A juvenile toxicity study was conducted in support of this application and further described below 
(see other toxicity studies).  
Genotoxicity 
The applicant detailed the published genotoxicity data with propranolol. The Ames tests were 
negative with doses of propranolol up to 1000 µg/plate. In vitro genotoxicity studies carried out in 
rats and humans hepatocytes and in Chinese hamster V79 cells showed negative results on 
cytotoxicity test and DNA fragmentation assay. Propranolol did not cause DNA damage, whatever 
the tested concentration. Propranolol up to 37.25 mg/kg did not induce a significant increase in 
polychromatic erythrocytes carrying micronuclei compared to control (p<0.001) and did not induce 
significant chromosomal aberrations in spermatocytes at all doses up to 111.75 mg/kg. Based on 
overall available published data, there was no evidence of propranolol genotoxicity.

No carcinogenic effect of propranolol was reported in the literature. In dietary administration 
studies in which mice and rats were treated with propranolol hydrochloride for up to 18 months at 
doses of up to 150 mg/kg/day, there was no evidence of drug-related tumorigenesis.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
The targeted patient population is a paediatric population. The evaluation of the reproductive and 
developmental toxicity of propranolol was thus limited to its potential effects both on male and 
female fertilities when given in adult animals and on postnatal development when given in juvenile 
animals. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/8171/2014 
Page 23/86 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
Propranolol demonstrated some effects on male and female fertility in vitro and in vivo in the rat. 
Propranolol at equivalent human therapeutic doses might induce hazardous effects on male fertility 
following repeated administration in rats but these effects were always reversible as they returned 
to normal values after discontinuation of treatment.  
Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic assessment was performed within the pivotal juvenile toxicity study described below 
(see other toxicity studies). 
Local Tolerance  
No local tolerance study was conducted which is acceptable given the clinical experience with 
propranolol. 
Other toxicity studies 
A GLP compliant toxicity study conducted in juvenile rats by the applicant showed that propranolol 
given orally up to 40 mg/kg/d, between PND 4 to 21 did not induce treatment-related effects on 
reproductive parameters and reproductive development, developmental parameters and 
neurologic development. Thus, the NOAEL was considered to be 40 mg/kg/day (representing an 
AUC of 1051 h•ng/ml in females and 2516 h.ng/ml in males) for these endpoints leading to a safety 
margin of 1.2 in females and of 2.9 in males. Nevertheless, mortality (4 pups out of a total of 64 in 
the main group) was observed at 40 mg/kg/day but the relationship to propranolol administration 
could not be established. For that reason, the NOAEL for juvenile toxicity was considered to be 20 
mg/kg/day (representing an AUC0-24h of 262 and 2211 h•ng/mL in male and female rats, 
respectively) resulting in the absence of sufficient exposure margins to clinical exposure (AUC0-24h 
of 860 h•ng/mL). 
In published studies in juvenile animals, propranolol administration induced a deficit in body weight 
and body weight gain but this was always reversible at cessation of treatment. Retarded growth 
rate following chronic oral propranolol administration to growing rats was independent of changes 
in plasma growth hormone and hypothalamic somatostatin concentration.

The values log Kow are variable according the references provided and were not determined 
experimentally. As propranolol hydrochloride is an ionisable compound, an ion-corrected log Dow and 
logKow was calculated to be 0.68 ± 0.01 or 3.45 ± 0.01, respectively, below the action limit of 4.5. 
As a result testing for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity is not required. 
The propranolol hydrochloride PECSURFACEWATER value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L with the 
use of a refined Fpen based estimation for the prevalence of the treated haemangioma of 12 %. The 
applicant follows the recommendations of the guideline and determines an acceptable PECsw. A 
phase II assessment is therefore not needed. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new studies of acute and chronic systemic toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity or reprotoxicity 
were performed. The published toxicological data are sufficient and scientifically relevant for the 
development of Hemangiol. The main effects reported after repeated administration of propranolol 
in adult and juvenile rats were a transient decrease in body weight associated with a transient 
decrease in organ weight. These effects were completely reversible when treatment was 
discontinued.  
No genotoxic potential of propranolol was evidenced in the review of literature.  
Long-term carcinogenicity studies, carried out in mice and rats treated with propranolol (up to 150 
mg/kg/day for 18 month) showed no evidence of drug-related tumorigenesis. Moreover, there is no 
signal from clinical safety data and the duration of treatment in infants (6 months) is short. 
Propranolol demonstrated some effects on male and female fertility in vitro and in vivo in the rat. 
Propranolol at equivalent human therapeutic doses might induce hazardous effects on male fertility 
following repeated administration in rats but these effects were always reversible as they returned 
to normal values after discontinuation of treatment. Moreover, no reproductive effect was observed 
in the GLP juvenile toxicity study and despite the long-term in clinical use for cardiovascular 
diseases, none side effects have been reported about fertility of children treated by propranolol. A 
risk for the environment is not expected. 
In the published data, a higher rate of mortality was always reported at dose levels higher than 50 
mg/kg/day in juvenile rats. Because of the absence of specific propranolol related clinical signs of 
toxicity or macroscopic lesions in animals which died following propranolol administration, a robust 
relationship between mortality and propranolol administration on the basis of these experimental 
parameters, remain difficult to establish.  
Consequently, the relationship between mortality and propranolol administration in juvenile rats at 
dose levels lower than 50 mg/kg/day appears unlikely. Moreover, propranolol has been widely 
prescribed in the paediatric population for more than 40 years, either for cardiovascular disease or

infantile haemangioma, and no signal concerning a potential relationship between treatment and 
any major safety concerns was reported in the literature. Only one fatal case was reported with 
propranolol in the treatment of infantile haemangioma, which was attributed to acute renal failure 
following diarrhoea. Then, the relevance of the uncertain treatment-related mortality seen at the 
highest dose in juvenile rats appears to be of little relevance for the paediatric population.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Propranolol is a well-known and already approved medicinal product in the EU. It has been used for 
many years in adults for cardiovascular indications. Its pharmacokinetic characteristics have been 
extensively documented in adults and its main PK features in adult patients elucidated. However, 
data in infants are very limited. 
Hemangiol is an oral solution containing 4.28 mg/ml of propranolol as hydrochloride salt 
(corresponding to 3.75 mg/ml propranolol base). The intended dose is 1.5 mg/kg body weight bid. 
This solution appears to be suitable for administration in infants weighing up to 12.5 kg. At the 
claimed dose (1.5 mg*2/kg), the intake volume is less than 5 ml. The applicant submitted a PIP 
intended to guarantee adequate and relevant development of Hemangiol in the treatment of IH, 
which was approved by the Paediatric Committee of the EMA on 27 Oct 2010 and followed by 4 
amendments leading to the final PIP decision P/0004/2013. 
Propranolol pharmacokinetic characteristics have been extensively documented in adults. Its main 
PK features in adult patients are summarised below. 
In addition, in order to assess the biopharmaceutical performances of the paediatric oral solution 
comparatively to a current EU marketed propranolol tablet formulation and the characterisation of 
propranolol PK properties in the target population i.e. in infants with IH, the applicant performed 
two PK studies. One conducted in adult healthy volunteers and the second in paediatric patients.  
The analytical techniques employed in the study are adequately validated. Their performances are 
suitable for the planned investigations.  
Standard methods were used for pharmacokinetic and statistical analyses. 
Absorption  
The applicant has presented clinical pharmacokinetic data of absorption from propranolol published 
data. Propranolol is almost completely absorbed after oral administration. However, it undergoes 
high first-pass metabolism by the liver and on average only about 25% of propranolol reaches the 
systemic circulation. Maximum plasma drug concentrations (Cmax) occur approximately 1 to 
2 hours after an oral dose. Administration of protein-rich foods increases the bioavailability of 
propranolol by about 50% with no change in time of maximal plasma concentration (Tmax). 
Propranolol is a substrate for the intestinal efflux transporter, P-glycoprotein (P-gp). However, 
studies suggest that P-gp is not dose-limiting for intestinal absorption of propranolol in the usual 
therapeutic dose range. 
Distribution 
The Applicant has presented clinical pharmacokinetic data of distribution from published data. 
Approximately 90% of circulating propranolol is bound to plasma proteins. Propranolol is a racemic 
mixture, the (S-) and (R-)enantiomers being preferentially bound to α1-glycoprotein (α1-GP) and 
albumin (HSA), respectively. The volume of distribution of propranolol is approximately 4 L/kg. 
Propranolol crosses the blood-brain barrier. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/8171/2014 
Page 30/86 
 
  
  
 
A comparative bioavailability study in adult healthy volunteers showed that the relative 
bioavailability of the solution (5 mg/mL) is approximately 20% higher than that observed with the 
tablets.  
The study has been conducted under fasting conditions, while the oral solution will be used under 
fed conditions. The applicant brought literature data suggesting that food intake would not influence 
propranolol bioavailability. Section 4.2 of the SmPC has been updated to reflect the use of 
propranolol as instructed in the pivotal clinical study. 
Elimination 
The Applicant has presented clinical pharmacokinetic data on elimination and metabolism based on 
published data. Propranolol is extensively metabolized through three primary routes: ring 
hydroxylation (mainly 4-hydroxylation), side-chain oxidation, and direct glucuronidation. It has 
been estimated that these routes of metabolism accounted for 42%, 41%, and 17% of the total 
metabolism, respectively, but with considerable variability between individuals. The four major final 
metabolites are propranolol glucuronide, naphthyloxylactic acid, glucuronic acid, and sulfate 
conjugates of 4-hydroxy propranolol. The T1/2 of propranolol ranges from 3 to 6 hours. Propranolol 
is excreted as metabolites in urines, less than 1% of a dose being excreted as unchanged drug in 
the urine4. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Propranolol is a class I compound almost completely absorbed after oral administration and having 
demonstrated a linear pharmacokinetics. 
Special populations 
Paediatric population: The pharmacokinetics of propranolol has been evaluated at steady-state in 
23 IH infants receiving a 3 mg/kg (propranolol base) bid. The included patients have been stratified 
in two groups: Group 1 from 35 to 90 days-old, and Group 2 from 91 to 150 days-old at inclusion. 
The data collected has been analysed following two approaches: a classical non Compartmental 
Analysis (NCA) and a model based approach (population-PK). 
- 
From the NCA analysis, the following findings have been reported: In both groups, the peak 
concentration was reached 2 hours after dosing, with a mean maximum plasma drug concentration 
(Cmax) of about 79 ng/mL. These values are comparable to those published in the literature for 
infants suffering from cardiovascular diseases. The corresponding plasma exposures (area under 
the plasma concentration time curve; AUC0-12 were 541 and 430 h*ng/mL in Groups 1 and 2, 
respectively. The total plasma clearance of propranolol was 2.7 and 3.3 L/h/kg in Groups 1 and 2, 
respectively. These values evidenced that once corrected for weight, primary pharmacokinetic 
parameters such as clearance (CL/F) determined in infants are similar to those published in the 
literature for propranolol in adults (ranging from 2.1 to 5.2 L/h/kg according to the study). These 
data indicate that CL/F is a very consistent parameter for propranolol across age. However, 
considering that the PK profiles have been established in limited number of  patients (respectively

8 and 11 in each age group) only on the basis of six plasma samples (0, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 9 hours after 
dosing). Therefore, the estimation of PK parameters could not be accurate and thus should be 
handled cautiously.  
- 
A population pharmacokinetic model using a body weight function on plasma clearance was 
established. This model adequately predicted the pharmacokinetics of propranolol in infants, and 
confirmed that the dose expressed as mg/kg should be used without further dose adaptation by 
range of age. Furthermore, this model was applied to estimate the impact on the maximum plasma 
concentration of the interval between the two intakes in the day, and documented that the 
maximum concentration is marginally affected when comparing a 9- or 12-hour dosing interval. 
Gender: It has been proposed that the clearance of propranolol in men is dependent on circulating 
concentrations of testosterone. In women, none of the metabolic clearances for propranolol showed 
any significant association with either oestradiol or testosterone5. 
Race: Sowinski et al [1996]6 investigated the pharmacokinetics of propranolol in African-American 
in comparison to Caucasian subjects. The clearance of (R)- and (S)-propranolol were about 76% 
and 53% higher in African-Americans than in Caucasians, respectively. Chinese subjects had a 
greater proportion of unbound propranolol in plasma compared to Caucasians (18% to 45% 
higher), which was associated with a lower plasma concentration of α 1-GP7. 
Renal Impairment: Bianchetti et al, [1976]8 investigated the pharmacokinetics of propranolol in 
patients with chronic renal failure and patients on regular dialysis, in comparison to healthy 
subjects. The Cmax of propranolol in the chronic renal failure group was 3- and 6-fold higher than 
those observed in the dialysis patients and in the healthy subjects, respectively. Propranolol plasma 
clearance was also reduced in the patients with chronic renal failure. Chronic renal failure has been 
associated with a decrease in drug metabolism via down-regulation of hepatic cytochrom P450 
activity resulting in a lower “first-pass” clearance 9. 
Hepatic Impairment: Propranolol is extensively metabolized by the liver. Wood et al, [1978]10 
investigated the pharmacokinetics of propranolol in patients with liver cirrhosis in comparison to 
healthy subjects. The steady-state unbound concentration of propranolol in patients with cirrhosis 
was 3-fold higher than in healthy subjects. In cirrhotic patients, the T1/2 increased to 11 hours 
compared to 4 hours in healthy subjects. 
Genetic Polymorphism: In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers (PM), no difference in terms of oral clearance 
or T1/2 of propranolol was observed when compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EM). 
Nevertheless, in the CYP2D6 PM population, the partial clearance of 4-OH propranolol was 
significantly lower, and the partial clearance of naphthyloxyactic acid was significantly higher than 
in the CTP2D6 EM population.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The Applicant did not perform any drug interaction studies in the target population. The same drug 
interactions than for adults have been included in section 4.5 of the SmPC which is considered 
acceptable.  
In vitro studies indicated that the aromatic hydroxylation of propranolol is catalysed mainly by 
CYP2D6. The side-chain oxidation of propranolol was mainly mediated by CYP1A2 and to some 
extent by CYP2D6. The ring hydroxylation of propranolol was mediated almost exclusively by 
CYP2D6. The contribution of CYP2C19 to side-chain oxidation was negligible11. Because the 
metabolism of propranolol involves multiple CYP isoenzymes (CYP2D6, 1A2, 2C19), 
co-administration with drugs that are metabolized by, or affect the activity (induction or inhibition) 
of one or more of these pathways may lead to clinically relevant drug interactions. 
Combinations should not only consider infants given any other medicinal products but also infants 
breastfed by mothers taking any other medicinal products. In this case, the need of stopping 
breast-feeding should be discussed. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No specific pharmacodynamic studies have been submitted with this application.  
Mechanism of action 
Currently, the pathogenesis of IH remains poorly understood. Potential mechanisms of action of 
propranolol claimed by the Applicant for treatment of proliferating IH are the following, there are 
based on bibliographic references:  
A local hemodynamic effect: vasoconstriction, which is a classical consequence of beta-adrenergic 
blockade and decrease of IH lesion perfusion;  
An anti-angiogenic effect characterized by a decrease of the proliferation of vascular endothelial 
cells, a reduction of the neovascularization and formation of vascular tubules, and a reduction of the 
secretion of Matrix Metalloproteinase 9 which is crucial for endothelial cell migration. Several 
hypotheses for the molecular mechanism of action are yet to be elucidated; 
An apoptosis-triggering effect on capillary endothelial cells. Beyond this effect, beta-2 
adrenoceptors are expressed on the capillary endothelial cells, their activation promotes the 
vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor signalling pathways and the 
resulting proangiogenesis/proliferation; their blockade by propranolol can inhibit capillary 
endothelial cell proliferation.  
The proposed target of propranolol is illustrated in Figure 1.

2.4.4.  Discussion and conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The applicant has not performed specific studies on absorption, distribution, elimination or 
interactions; clinical pharmacokinetic data from the literature were presented instead. This is 
acceptable since the pharmacokinetic characteristics are well described in the literature. Additional 
clinical PK studies are not considered necessary. 
In order to assess the biopharmaceutical performances of the paediatric oral solution comparatively 
to a current EU marketed propranolol tablet formulation and the characterisation of propranolol PK 
properties in the target population i.e. in infants with IH, the applicant performed two PK studies. 
One conducted in adult healthy volunteers and the second in paediatric patients. Bioavailability of 
the oral solution compared to the reference tables has also been established in 12 adults showing 
that the extent of absorption was 20% higher for the solution compared with the tablet formulation. 
The PK profile in children has been characterised in a PK study in 23 infants. Propranolol is 
metabolised in the liver and excreted by the kidneys.  
There is no data in children in cases of renal or hepatic impairment, therefore the use of propranolol 
is not recommended in these cases (this has been reflected in sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC).  
The mechanism of action remains poorly understood and based on published hypothesis. The 
applicant has not performed any study to further clarify this mechanism. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The propranolol clinical program in proliferating IH consists in one pivotal phase II/III study 
(V00400 SB201), one PK phase I study (V00400SB102), a compassionate use program and 
literature review.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/8171/2014 
Page 34/86 
 
 
  
  
 
The first claimed indication, proliferating IH requiring systemic therapy, is wider than the population 
included in the clinical pivotal trial V00400SB201. The efficacy of propranolol in high-risk patients 
(i.e. life and function-threatening or severe ulcerated IH) is only based on data from PK Study 102, 
a compassionate use program and on publications.  
As a consequence, the Applicant proposed a more specific indication:  
"HEMANGIOL is indicated in the treatment of proliferating infantile haemangioma requiring 
systemic therapy: 
- Life-or function-threatening haemangioma, 
- Ulcerated haemangioma with pain and/or lack of response to simple wound care measures, 
- Haemangioma with a risk of permanent scars or disfigurement. 
It is to be initiated in infants aged 5 weeks to 5 months (see section 4.2)". 
A summary of all sub-categories of the target population is presented in Table 7.

2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No dedicated dose-response study has been performed for this application. The proposed regimen 
was extensively discussed with the EMA during the paediatric investigation plan, based on published 
data in the target indication and on the experience of propranolol in the paediatric population for 
cardiologic indications. Based on the available data and the already known safety profile of 
propranolol, 2 dosages (1mg/kg/day and 3mg/kg/day divided in 2 intakes) and 2 durations of 
treatment (3 or 6 months) were chosen.

The dose has been expressed in propranolol base in line with EU guidelines whereas the dose is 
expressed in propranolol hydrochloride in the SmPC of the already authorised medicinal products in 
Europe. In order to avoid the risk of confusion, clarifications have been added to the product 
information.

Treatments 
Patients received in double-blind conditions study treatment with an oral solution of either: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Propranolol 1 mg/kg/day 3 months (regimen 1) 
Propranolol 1 mg/kg/day 6 months (regimen 2), 
Propranolol 3 mg/kg/day 3 months (regimen 3) 
Propranolol 3 mg/kg/day 6 months (regimen 4) 
Placebo for 6 months 
The treatment duration was 6 months (24 weeks): 3 months (12 weeks) of propranolol followed by 
3 months (12 weeks) of placebo or 6 months of propranolol or placebo. 
The 3 mg/kg/day dose (regimens 3 and 4) was titrated using 1 mg/kg/day increments during the 
first 3 weeks. 
Consequently, to maintain the double-blind conditions on placebo and all propranolol arms 
throughout the treatment period, patients assigned to one of the two 3 months treatment duration 
regimens have received placebo for the last 3 months of treatment and dummy titration was used 
for patients assigned to placebo or a 1 mg/kg/day propranolol regimen. 
Study treatment was administered to patients orally, twice daily (morning and late afternoon). 
Objectives 
The primary objectives of this study were to identify the appropriate dose and duration of 
propranolol treatment, and to demonstrate its superiority over placebo based on the 
complete/nearly complete resolution of the target IH at Week 24 (W24). The study had also a safety 
objective, to document the safety profile of the four regimens of propranolol in the treatment of IH 
in infants aged 1 to 5 months (35 to 150 days) at inclusion. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
The primary outcome assessed the evolution of target IH from baseline to W24 evaluated based on 
the intra-patient blinded centralized independent qualitative assessments (Type 1) of W24 
photographs of the target IH compared to baseline. A treatment success was defined as a 
centralized assessment of complete/nearly complete resolution of the target IH at W24 compared to 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/8171/2014 
Page 38/86 
 
  
  
 
baseline.  ‘Nearly complete resolution’ was defined as: a minimal degree of telangiectasia, 
erythema, skin thickening, soft tissue swelling, and/or distortion of anatomic landmarks. 
Due to the lack of guideline, the primary outcome was discussed and established following scientific 
advices/discussions with the regulatory agencies. Both qualitative and quantitative assessments 
are needed to correctly assess the effect of treatment. A centralized blinded evaluation of 
standardized photographs has been performed to ensure the robustness of this criterion. However, 
the assessment is not considered as fully blinded as readers known which photographs 
corresponded to baseline condition. The acquisition method procedure for photographs and the 
evaluation were extensively detailed in the protocol. The training of the photographer, the 
procedure of acquisition, the quality control check and the blinded assessment are considered to 
allow an independent and reproducible assessment of the primary outcome. 
Secondary endpoint: success/failure (binary endpoint) based on the investigator onsite qualitative 
assessment of complete resolution of the target IH at W48, where a treatment success is defined as 
complete resolution of the target IH without sequelae or with minimal sequelae at W48. This (post- 
W24) endpoint is not analysed in the present report. 
Other secondary endpoints: 
Centralised assessments of the target IH: 
1. Endpoints based on the independent blinded assessments of complete/nearly complete 
resolution (Type 1): 
Success/failure at W12 compared to baseline, where treatment success was defined as for the 
primary efficacy endpoint 
Time to first sustained complete/nearly complete resolution (W12, W24 compared to baseline) 
2. Endpoints based on the independent blinded 3-point scale assessments of IH evolution (Type 2: 
improvement, stabilization or worsening 2): 
Categorical endpoints for target IH evolution between paired patient-visits (W5, W8, W12, W16, 
W20 or W24 compared to baseline, W5, W8, W12, W16 or W20, respectively). A global 
improvement was also computed on the W5-W24 period (Yes/No). 
Time to first sustained improvement (first improvement after which there is no worsening) 
3. Endpoints based on centralized quantitative assessments: 
Continuous and categorical endpoints (change in size and colour of target IH) at W12 and W24 
compared to baseline 
Investigator on-site qualitative assessments at each scheduled post-baseline visit 
compared to baseline: 
-  Categorical endpoints for complete/nearly complete resolution of target IH, 
  Nearly complete resolution was defined as a minimal degree of telangiectasia, erythema, skin 
thickening, soft tissue swelling or distortion of anatomical landmarks and/or a minimal palpable 
component.

-  Categorical  endpoints  for  complete  resolution  (3-point  scale:  no  sequelae;  minimal  sequelae 
defined  as  minimal  telangiectasia,  macular  discolouration  and/or  textural  change;  marked

or skin contours) 
-  Time to first sustained complete/nearly complete resolution

worsening) 
-  Time to first sustained improvement (first improvement after which there is no worsening) 
Parent(s) or guardian(s) on-site qualitative assessments at each scheduled 
post-baseline visit compared to the previous scheduled visit 
-  Categorical  endpoints  for  target  IH  evolution  (3-point  scale:  improvement,  stabilization, 
worsening) 
-  Time to first sustained improvement (first improvement after which there is no worsening) 
Other  investigator  on-site  qualitative  assessments  at  each  scheduled  post-baseline 
visit: 
-  Categorical  endpoints  based  on  assessments  of  target  IH  complications:  functional 
impairment/ulceration/haemorrhaging 
-  Categorical  endpoints  based  on  qualitative  assessments  of  complete  resolution  of  nontarget 
facial IH and non-facial IH at each scheduled post-baseline visit (3-point scale: no sequelae; 
minimal sequelae; marked sequelae) 
-  Categorical endpoints based on whether or not invasive procedures were carried out during the 
study on the target/non-target facial/non-facial IH. 
Sample size 
The appropriate sample size has been calculated to achieve adequate power (>90%) for an overall 
one-sided type I error rate of α=0.005 to test for superiority of the selected regimen(s) of 
propranolol versus placebo under the different scenarios investigated. 
Randomisation 
Randomisation was managed by an independent randomization team and centralized via an IVRS. 
Stratified block randomization in a 2:1 ratio (each propranolol regimen: placebo) was used in both 
stages of the study. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/8171/2014

Blinding (masking) 
A number of measures were taken to maintain the blinding in the double-blind study: 
The placebo oral solution and the active solutions were identical in terms of colour, viscosity, odour 
and volume to be administered. The investigator in charge of the clinical assessment of 
haemangioma was not involved in the electrocardiogram (ECG) assessment during the study 
treatment period, since bradycardia is an easy observable effect of beta-blockers. ECG data were 
maintained blinded. For the primary criterion assessment, pairs of photographs per patient were 
centrally assessed by two independent readers who were blinded to the treatment arms. 
The interim analysis was conducted by an Independent Statistician and reviewed by the 
Independent Data Monitoring Committee. 
Statistical methods 
Interim analysis 
In order to select one or two “best” regimens of propranolol for Stage 2 of the study, where the 
“best” regimen was defined as the most efficacious of all regimens with a good safety profile, an 
interim analysis was carried out at the end of Stage 1 after the first 40:20 (propranolol: placebo) 
patients per treatment arm had completed their visit W24 or been prematurely withdrawn from the 
study treatment. This analysis was performed by an independent statistician and reviewed by an 
independent data monitoring committee to avoid unblinding of the study personnel (investigational 
sites, Sponsor and Sub-contractor project team). Efficacy was evaluated based on intra-patient 
blinded centralized independent qualitative assessments of the target IH photographs.  
Primary analysis  
The analysis of all data of the study until W24/EOT referred as the primary analysis was carried out 
after all patients randomized in the study had completed their visit W24 or been prematurely 
withdrawn from the study treatment. A one-sided significance level of 0.005 was chosen for this 
single pivotal phase III study. The p-values from the first and second stages of the study were 
combined using the weighted inverse normal combination function. Simes’ method was used to 
define an adjusted first stage p-value ensuring the type I error rate control. 
The primary efficacy analysis data set was the intention-to-treat (ITT) data set: all randomized 
patients in Stage 1 and all the patients in Stage 2 randomized to placebo or the selected regimen of 
propranolol and having received at least one dose of study therapy (or in the case of uncertainty). 
The wording “or in the case of uncertainty” need to be clarified. This is the primary efficacy analysis 
data set. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 460 patients were randomized to treatment, of whom 456 received at least one dose of 
study treatment. The first 190 randomized patients having either completed the 24-week study 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/8171/2014 
Page 41/86 
 
  
  
 
treatment period or been prematurely withdrawn from study treatment entered the Stage 1 of the 
study, of whom 188 were treated. 
The number of patients lost to follow-up is low (11/460) and similar in the 5 treatments arms. 
However, early treatment discontinuations were frequent (29.8%) and unbalanced with 36 of 55 
patients (65.5%) in the placebo arm and 14 of 102 patients (13.7%) in the propranolol 3mg/kg/day 
6 months arm. The main reason (22.4%) was due to treatment inefficacy judged by the investigator 
(defined as a “worse state compared to the previous visit”), followed by parental decision (8.5%); 
safety reason only represented 1.7% of cases. The rate of treatment inefficacy was particularly 
high, 58.2%, in the placebo arm in which treatment discontinuation occurred since the first weeks 
of treatments. In the 2 regimens 3 months of propranolol followed by 3 months of placebo, the 
same observation can be made with a rate of discontinuation for inefficacy of 30.3% in the 
1mg/kg/day arm and 24.8% in the 3 mg/kg/day arm. A change in KM curve was also observed after 
90 days, the rate of discontinuations increasing when infants were switched to placebo.

Recruitment 
The first patient was enrolled 24th February 2010 and the last completed visit (W24) date was 8th 
May 2012. 
Conduct of the study 
The study was conducted in 56 recruiting (i.e. having screened at least one patient) investigating 
centres from 16 countries (Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, 
Lithuania, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation, Spain and the United 
States of America [USA]). The original protocol was dated 25th June 2009.  
There were 18 study amendments. Eight protocols and six amendments (excluding a local 
amendment) were introduced. Versions 4 to 7 were used during the recruitment period, and the 8th 
protocol version (dated 19 March 2012) was circulated even after the end of the inclusion (since the

The interim analysis conducted to choose the best regimen of propranolol (dosage and duration) for 
the treatment of proliferating IH, showed that the primary outcome, “complete or nearly complete 
resolution”, was obtained in less than 10% of patients for the placebo, the 1 mg/kg/day 3 months 
and the 3 mg/kg/day 3 months regimens. It was 37.5% in the 1 mg/kg/day 6 months regimen. The 
best results were obtained in the 3 mg/kg/day 6 months regimen with 62.8% of patients reaching 
the outcome. Thus, this regimen was recommended by the IDMC.

The primary endpoint, “complete or nearly complete resolution of IH at week 24”, showed a 
statistical significant difference in favour of the 3 mg/kg/day 6 months compared to placebo. The 
combined p-value (<0.0001) showed that the difference was statistically significant at the 0.005 
level. An important difference was observed in the response to treatment between propranolol and 
placebo: 60.4% versus 3.6%. Moreover, results were concordant between the two stages of the 
study. Propranolol demonstrated a significant clinical efficacy of treatment on proliferating IH in the 
CHMP assessment report

included population. When results were adjusted by age, localisation or randomisation, they were 
similar in each category. 
The photographs were assessed by two readers (three readers until September 2011), 
discrepancies between their assessment were observed for 50 cases at W24. Of them, 28 were 
finally considered as complete/nearly completed resolution and 22 as failure. A significant number 
of patients received propranolol after they experienced a premature end of study treatment which 
was mainly related to treatment lack of efficacy. After EOT, the exposure to propranolol was 
particularly significant in the placebo arm (45.5% exposure, vs 30.6% and 10.9% in the other 
arms). The protocol planned that these patients were considered as “failure” in ITT data set 
considered for the statistical analysis for the primary outcome. Thus, the result of the centralised 
qualitative assessment of these patients was arbitrarily considered “negative” without any real 
assessment and did not take into account the possibility of spontaneous IH resolution (seen in 2 
patients from a total of 24 whom remained in the placebo arm until W24). 
Of the patients who discontinued treatment prematurely, follow-up up to W24 was completed for 
14/36 patients in the placebo group, these 14 patients received at least one IH treatment between 
early discontinuation and W24. In the propranolol 3 mg/kg/day group, of the patients who 
discontinued treatment prematurely, follow-up up to W24 was completed for 8/14 patients, with 
5/8 received at least one treatment for IH between early discontinuation and W24.

Evolution of IH over time 
In the placebo arm, improvement was seldom observed and about 11% worsening was observed at 
the two first comparisons (W5 versus baseline and W8 versus W5). The evolution was clearly 
different in the 3 mg/kg/day 6 months group, with early improvement in a vast majority of the 
patients.

Investigator’s on site qualitative assessment   
IH complete/nearly complete resolution at each visit 
An important discrepancy was observed between the centralised and the investigators assessment 
for the outcome “complete/near complete response between baseline and W24”. According to the 
centralised reading, the response rate was 3.6% in the placebo arm vs 60.4% in the 3 mg/kg/day 
6 months arm, whereas when considering the investigator judgement they were respectively 
10.5% and 26.7%. The applicant considers such differences were justified by the fact that the 
investigators’ assessment of the same criterion was subject to greater heterogeneity (56 
investigating sites versus 2 expert readers), less reproducibility (no training for this parameter, no 
validation of intra/inter reader reproducibility) and was also methodologically different since based 
on a direct visual examination of the patient at W24 with the W0 pictures and medial data available 
at the investigator site.

According to the applicant, the difference between the centralised assessment and the investigator 
onsite assessment can be explained by the missing data that are handled differently. So a new 
analysis performed on the investigators’ assessment transformed into binary outcome and using 
the same statistical methods as the primary analysis is provided (a difference was observed in 
favour of the 3 mg/kg/day arm but the percentage of patients with complete/nearly complete 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/8171/2014 
Page 49/86 
 
 
  
  
 
resolution of IH 22.8% was still lower than for the centralised assessment 60.4%). However to be 
convincing, different analyses handling missing data under various assumptions should have been 
provided. Furthermore, discrepancies were observed even between centralised readers.  
Ancillary analyses 
Sustainability of Treatment Effect and Regrowth  
In relation to persistence of efficacy, overall, the earliest treatment failures were seen in the 
placebo 6 months regimen and passing 50% treatment failure by Week 5. This was followed by the 
3-month propranolol treatment regimens, with the first notable increase in treatment failures at 
Week 16 (after the transfer to placebo for 3 months, at Week 12). The lowest proportion of 
treatment failures were seen in the 6 month propranolol treatment regimens, less than 10% of 
patients in the 3 mg/kg/day 6 months regimen had failed treatment by Week 16, just over 10% by 
Week 20, and approximately 40% had failed treatment by Week 24.

On the further 72 weeks open label period of the pivotal study that is still ongoing, complete or 
nearly complete resolution criterion used for the demonstration of efficacy during the double-blind 
part of the study is still maintained at Week 48 in 54.2% of patients having been treated with 
propranolol 1 mg/kg./day for 6 months and 59.8% of patients having been treated with propranolol 
3 mg/kg./day for 6 months. , only about 11% of patients of the 3 mg/kg/day 6 months regimen 
required the re-introduction of a systemic treatment.

Isolated cases of regrowth of IH have been reported in the literature, after definitive discontinuation 
of propranolol treatment following an initial successful response. Based on the submitted data 
(pivotal Study 201, CUP and publications), the risk of IH regrowth after the end of treatment does 
not seem negligible (around 14%). In the pivotal trial, among the patients who have completed the 
24 week period (n=323), 25 patients have been retreated by propranolol or other beta-blocker. 
Several hypotheses have been put forward: the duration of treatment, the age at initiation and/or 
at the end of treatment, the size or the morphology of the haemangioma, but currently no formal 
conclusions can be raised.

Study V00400SB102: A Phase I multicentre, open-label, repeated-dose, pharmacokinetic study 
of propranolol in infants treated for proliferating infantile haemangioma (IHs) requiring systemic 
therapy. 
There was a higher proportion of female patients than male in both groups (17/23 [73.9%] overall 
were female). The patients were stratified into treatment groups by age and, as a result, the mean 
age for patients in Group 1 was 69.7 days (ranging from 50 to 89 days) and in Group 2 was 128.2 
days (ranging from 91 to 152 days). Mean weight, height, and head circumference were similarly

higher in Group 2 than Group 1. At baseline there were no major IH complications and no cardiac 
complications. Resolution of the target IH was seen as early as Day 28 and by Day 84, 36.4% of 
patients (8/22) had resolution of their target IH. In addition, complications of IH disappeared over 
time, confirming the regression of the IH. 
Compassionate use program: the CUP conducted in France has included 922 patients, between 
13 Apr 2010 and 12 April 2013. The objective was not to assess the efficacy of propranolol oral 
solution. The recruited population included more severe patients than the main clinical study 201. 
The dose and the titration phase are similar than in this study but the treatment duration is not 
limited to 6 months (mean duration = 7.1 months, calculated based on 313 patients who 
discontinued treatment). The mean age at inclusion, i.e. 5.7 months, was also higher than in the 
clinical study (around 3.5 months), which a very important range from 1 days to 6.2 years. 
“Efficacy” data have been provided for 313 patients (34%) for whom the main reason for 
discontinuation (83.7 %) is a good efficacy. Among the 262 patients who stopped treatment for 
good efficacy, a reintroduction has been necessary for 4 patients more than 2 months after 
discontinuation, one of them needing a second reintroduction. Among the 262 patients who stopped 
treatment for good efficacy 154 were reported as complete/almost complete recovered.  
Literature review: The demonstration of clinical efficacy of propranolol in the treatment of 
proliferating IH requiring systemic treatment for severe cases (life- and function-threatening, 
severe ulcerated) is based on this literature review.  
A literature review has been performed of all articles published in this field since the first discovery 
of the efficacy of propranolol for the treatment of IH by Leauté-Labrèze in 2008. Seventy one (71) 
key publications (studies and cases reported) have been selected to present a critical analysis of the 
efficacy of oral propranolol in cases of IH requiring systemic therapy. It represented 364 patients. 
This literature review has provided data of propranolol efficacy in treating high-risk IH, focusing on 
ulcerated IH, ocular IH, airway IH, hepatic IH and PHACES: 
- Ocular IH: 3 prospective interventional studies (n=22 patients with ocular IH treated with 
propranolol), 17 case series (n=127), 6 individual case reports (n=6). 
- Ulcerated IH: 3 prospective interventional studies (n=12 patients with ulcerated IH treated with 
propranolol), 7 case series, including 4 case series that only evaluated ulcerated IH and 3 case 
series that included ulcerated IH as part of a wider IH population (n=71 patients with ulcerated IH 
treated with propranolol), 4 individual case reports. 
- Airway IH: 2 multicentre retrospective studies (n=19 patients with airway IH treated with 
propranolol), 10 case series (n=34 patients with airway IH treated with propranolol), 11 individual 
case reports.  
- Hepatic IH: 2 case series (n=11 patients with hepatic IH treated with propranolol) and 9 individual 
case reports. 
- PHACES: 4 case series (n=36 patients with PHACES treated with propranolol) and 1 individual 
case report.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The current application is based on one pivotal clinical trial (study 201), one supportive PK trial 
(study 102), data from a compassionate use program and publications.  
The applicant selected 3 mg/kg/day for the main efficacy studies based on the long experience in 
treatment for cardiological indications in children of the dose range 1-4 mg/kg/day with a 
well-known efficacy and safety profile. The applicant has also followed the advice of the FDA and 
EMA to study different doses (1 mg/kg/day and 3 mg/kg/day) and treatment duration (3 months 
and 6 months). Propranolol was administered always around meal time to avoid hypoglycaemia. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal Study 201 was a randomized, double-blind, controlled, multidose, multicentre, adaptive 
phase II/III study in infants with proliferating infantile haemangioma (IHs) requiring systemic 
therapy to compare 4 regimens of propranolol (1 or 3 mg/kg/day for 3 or 6 months) to placebo.  
Treatments were adequate and the regimens used were in compliance with FDA and EMA advice.  
Due to the adaptive design, the study was divided into two phases with an interim analysis 
conducted by an IDMC to select the dose to be pursued in the second phase. The rationale for the 
choice of one (3 mg/kg/day 6 months) of the two groups treated with propranolol was not clearly 
defined. 
The primary endpoint assessed the evolution of the target IH from baseline to week 24, based of 
intra-patient blinded photographs judged by two independent readers. The chosen outcome was 
complete/nearly complete resolution of the target IH at W24 compared to baseline.  
Moreover, a training of the photographers and detailed procedure for the acquisition, the quality 
control and the assessment have been elaborated to sustain the robustness and the reproducibility 
of the evaluation of this endpoint. The blinded assessment is particularly important in this target 
disease, due to the early claimed effect of propranolol on aspect and morphology of IH during the 
first hours of treatment and the fact that haemangioma can spontaneously reverse. However, 
considering that readers knew which photograph of the pairs was taken at baseline, the assessment 
was not fully blinded.  
The secondary endpoint defined in the protocol was success/failure based on the investigator 
qualitative assessment on complete resolution at W48, this analyse was not submitted in the 
current application. A large number of other secondary endpoints were assessed by three ways: 
centralised assessment, investigator’s on-site assessment and parental assessment.  
The phase I Study 102was submitted as a supportive study. It is a multicentre, open-label, 
repeated-dose, pharmacokinetic study of propranolol in 23 infants treated for proliferating IHs 
requiring systemic therapy only studied the efficacy of propranolol has a secondary endpoint. 
Patients were treated in absence of comparator/placebo. No centralised assessment of efficacy 
endpoints was performed.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Pivotal study 201 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/8171/2014 
Page 55/86 
 
  
  
 
All baseline characteristics were well-balanced between both treatment groups.   
For the primary efficacy endpoint in the 6-month regimen, the difference in response rate between 
Hemangiol and placebo was highly clinically and statistically significant. The efficacy results seem 
similar by age group and haemangioma localisation. 
A significant number of patients received propranolol after they experienced a premature end of 
study treatment mainly related to lack of efficacy. After EOT, the exposure to propranolol was 
particularly significant in the placebo arm (45.5% exposure, vs 30.6% and 10.9% in the other 
arms). The protocol planned that these patients were considered as “failure” in ITT data set 
considered for the statistical analysis for the primary outcome. Thus, the result of the centralised 
qualitative assessment of these patients was arbitrarily considered “negative” without any real 
assessment and did not take into account the possibility of spontaneous IH resolution (seen in 2 
patients from a total of 24 whom remained in the placebo arm until W24). The new analysis 
submitted by the Applicant, excluding all premature discontinuations, even if the results were in line 
with the primary analysis, is not sufficient to explore the impact of premature discontinuations. 
Thus, based on the overall data, it cannot be ruled out that the difference on efficacy observed in 
favour of propranolol 3mg/kg/day arm has been overestimated taking into account that the 
spontaneous resolution of the IH cannot be assessed. 
A large number of secondary efficacy endpoints have been assessed by central reading, by 
investigators and by parents, they were globally in favour of propranolol efficacy for the treatment 
of IH.  
Regarding the criterion of “complete or nearly complete resolution of target IH” an important 
discrepancy has been observed between central and investigator onsite assessment (consistent in 
115 of 156 cases only). However, in view of the consistent result across efficacy endpoints this did 
not raise concerns.  
Moreover in this pivotal trial, a low number of regrowth of IH was observed in the overall population. 
In the CUP, 4 cases of retreatment with propranolol have been documented. Based on study results 
and on publications (14% of patients with regrowth), the risk of IH regrowth after the end of 
treatment does not seem negligible. Several hypotheses have been put forward: the duration of 
treatment, the age at initiation and/or at the end of treatment, the size or the morphology of the 
haemangioma, but currently no formal conclusions can be made.  
PK study 102 was submitted to further support the efficacy data. Some limitations have been 
identified to properly demonstrate the efficacy of propranolol in the target indication. A limited 
number of patients (n=23) were included; however the characteristic of patients were in line with 
those of the main clinical study, with the exception that more severe patients can be treated. The 
efficacy results of study 102 are considered supportive an in line with the efficacy results of the 
pivotal study. 
Results in high risk patients from the compassionate use program were in line with those observed 
in the pivotal trial and supported the efficacy of propranolol in the treatment of high risk IH.  
The literature review submitted by the applicant also supports the efficacy of propranolol in the 
target population. .

2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The Applicant has investigated twice daily dosing of propranolol administered at daily doses of 1 and 
3 mg/kg for up to 3 or 6 months in study V00400 SB 2 01. The results from this study provide 
evidence of efficacy for the dose of 3 mg/kg/day for 6 months. The target population has been 
redefined and the Applicant had performed further analysis of available data to sustain the 
extrapolation of the pivotal study results to the high risk patients. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The primary safety analysis encompasses pooled data from the following two clinical studies, in the 
target population of infants with proliferating IHs requiring systemic therapy: 
− Study 102, an open-label, repeated-dose study to determine the steady-state PK of propranolol 
in 23 infants. 
− Study 201, a pivotal, adaptive Phase II/III, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial with four 
regimens of propranolol (final dose of 1 and 3 mg/kg/day, each for 3 or 6 months, following 
uptitration). In total, 456 received at least one dose of study treatment (401/propranolol and 
55/placebo). 
Additional safety analyses presented in this submission encompass data from the following sources: 
− Study 301, an ongoing multicentre, open-label study of propranolol in infants with proliferating IH 
requiring systemic therapy, who had participated in Studies 102 or 201. At the cut-off date of 31 
Dec 2012, 11 patients have been enrolled and 1 SAE has been notified. 
− A compassionate use program (CUP) on-going in France and Switzerland. A total of 660 patients 
have been treated. 
− Studies and individual case reports of patients with IH treated with oral propranolol presented in 
the scientific literature. For the evaluation of safety, a total of 1367 patients from 60 publications 
were considered. 
However, the clinical safety dataset does not include the data from the follow-up phase of study 201 
until week 96 and from the study 301, these data should be provided when available. 
Patient exposure 
The clinical studies 102 and 201 performed in infant patients were pooled in the global V00400SB 
safety database for the purpose of this submission. Overall, 479 patients in the pooled safety 
population were exposed to study drug (V0400SB or placebo): 23 patients in study 102 and 456 in 
study 201.

In patients with infantile haemangioma, the recommended dose of propranolol is 3 mg/kg/day 
divided in two intakes (with a titration phase) for 6 months. 220 patients were exposed to this 
dosage with a mean duration of 70 days for the 3 months regimen and of 147 days for the 6 months 
regimen. Thus, taking into account the titration phase, 88 patients were exposed to the claimed 
regimen. It can consider that the number of patients exposed to propranolol at the target dose and 
duration is low considering the potential target population (range mentioned in the RMP is 15000 to 
45000 patients per year in Europe).  
The mean duration of exposure in the 3 mg/kg/days 6 months regimen was 161.0 days (less than 
6 months), with a range from 19 to 190 days.  Moreover, it should be noted that the exposure to 
study drug was markedly lower with placebo than with propranolol in terms of number of patients 
and duration of treatment. Consequently, the comparison of the safety profile between placebo and 
propranolol is biased and should be interpreted with caution. Finally, propranolol has not been 
studied for duration of treatment beyond 6 months; thus, the safety profile of a long-term 
treatment in the claimed population has not been established.   
Baseline characteristic 
Regarding baseline demographic characteristics, no significant difference was detected between 
treatment groups by age, sex, race (majority of Caucasians), in the pooled safety data from studies 
102 and 201. Mean weight at birth was 3.0 kg and most patients were female (71.4%). The target 
IH was more commonly facial (71.2%) than non-facial (28.8%). Regarding age, the mean age at 
randomization was 103.8 days, with 63.0% of patients aged 91-150 days at randomization and 
37.0% aged 35-90 days at randomization. As a consequence, there are fewer safety data for the 
younger patients. Moreover, 26.2% of patients were born prematurely, with a slightly higher rate of 
prematurity in the placebo regimen (34.5%) compared to the propranolol arms (21.6-27.5%). 
Thus, the safety extrapolations need to be limited to the studied population only, particularly safety 
data on younger children (less than 35 days) or premature treated are missing, and this population 
should be included in potential off label use. Regarding the disease history, no significant 
differences were detected between treatment groups. The more frequent localisation is facial IH, 
this is also due to the original protocol which only included initially facial IH, other locations were

authorised later. Moreover, no major difference has been observed between arms on medical 
history or on concomitant disease.  
The most used concomitant medications during the clinical trials were vitamins and vaccines, which 
can be considered as common talking into, account the target population of infants between 5 
weeks and 1 year. 
Adverse events 
The Table  summarises the adverse events pooled by dose of V0400SB, all V0400SB or all placebo, 
whatever the regimen. 
Table 19: Summary of Adverse Events (Updated Table 24 of the CSR) 
The SOCs with the highest frequencies were infections and infestations (56.8%), gastrointestinal 
disorders (50.2%), and general disorders and administration site conditions (29.5%). It should also 
be noted that more than 20% of patients exposed to propranolol have psychiatric disorders, skin 
and soft tissue disorders and respiratory disorders.

As expected, the percentage of patients with at least 1 related TEAE was notably higher in each 
pooled V0400SB group (37.5% in the pooled V0400SB 1 mg/kg/day group and 35.3% in the 
V0400SB 3 mg/kg/day group) than in the pooled placebo group (14.8%). They are representative 
of class-effect events with beta-blockers; the most common related TEAEs were: peripheral 
coldness, diarrhoea, sleep disorder, middle insomnia, and nightmare. The incidence in this young 
population is low and no dose-response effect was observed between low and high dose of 
propranolol.

Most of the TEAEs which higher incidence with propranolol than with placebo integrated well known 
non-serious side effects of propranolol such as diarrhoea, vomiting, peripheral coldness, sleep 
disorder, middle insomnia, somnolence, restlessness, hypersomnia and agitation, as well as events 
frequently occurring in young infants such as constipation, vaccination complication, conjunctivitis, 
gastroenteritis, infantile colic, flatulence, influenza, viral infection, erythema, abdominal pain… The 
incidence in this young population is low and no dose-response effect was observed between low 
and high dose of propranolol.

The majority of AE have mild to moderate intensity; the number of patients with severe adverse 
events both in placebo or treatments arms is low. The unknown outcomes were rare (only 8 patients 
in the safety database). 
No difference was observed regarding the number of adverse events between the 2 categories of 
age (35-90 and 91-150 days), the prematurity, the sex or the IH localisation. However, premature 
born children should be considered as high-risk population regarding severe events.  
Important identified risks with propranolol  
Hypoglycaemia, bradycardia, hypotension, and bronchospasm are important identified risks known 
to occur with propranolol in infants. During the pivotal clinical trial (study 201), parents were 
provided a specific letter on safety monitoring during the treatment phase and were also advised on 
the management of hypoglycaemia, hypotension and bradycardia. Acute monitoring has been 
performed before treatment initiation and at each increase of dose. Warning and precaution for use 
have been included in the SmPC and PL, to give recommendations regarding the hours of 
administration and the monitoring of children. 
Hypoglycaemia: the 2 reported cases of hypoglycaemia were of mild intensity without symptom. 
Moreover, the general context of gastroenteritis and vomiting for one patient can explain the 
occurrence of hypoglycaemia. Due to the low number of cases, it can be consider that the titration 
phase and the advices given to parents have been efficient. Hypoglycaemia is particularly a safety 
concern in infants born prematurely. 
Bradycardia was reported in 1 patient during the uptitration period and 1 patient after uptitration. 
The 2 reported cases of bradycardia were of moderate intensity: one with clinical significance and 
one without symptom. Due to the low number of cases, it can also be considered that the titration 
phase and the acute monitoring (ECG monitoring at the first dose and at each dose increase, 
specialist advice in case of cardiac abnormalities) of patients during the administration have been 
efficient. 
For HR values, on treatment a decrease around 8-10 bpm was observed in propranolol arm, not 
recovered in placebo arm. The decreased HR was maintained all along the study. No major effect on 
QT prolongation was observed during clinical trials. After the first intake and each dose increase, the 
effect of propranolol on heart rate should be carefully monitored, including blood pressure and heart 
rate at least hourly for at least 2 hours.    
Hypotension was reported for 3 patients during the uptitration period and 3 patients after 
uptitration. Moreover, a decrease for diastolic and systolic blood pressure was observed during the 
titration phases both in placebo and propranolol groups. At expected this decrease was more 
marked in the propranolol arms due to its pharmacological properties. The changes for blood

pressure from baseline are quite stable during the treatment phase. The difficulty to properly 
monitored blood pressure in this young population is acknowledged, thus these results were quite 
difficult to interpret and no dose relationship can be fully demonstrated. 
Four cases of bronchospasm have been reported in the safety database, equally shared between 
placebo and propranolol arm; they were of mild to moderate intensity and all patients recovered.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There was no death in the pooled safety population.  
In total, 36 SAEs were reported in 27 treated patients including 34 TE SAEs in 26 patients. The most 
common serious adverse events were: condition aggravated, drug ineffective and bronchiolitis 
(each reported in 3 patients), and bronchitis (2 patients). Regarding the intensity of SAE, 11 were 
considered as mild, 12 as moderate and 13 as severe. Four patients (all on V0400SB) had SAEs that 
were considered treatment-related by both the investigator and the Sponsor: bradycardia in the 
context of non-related enterocolitis, second degree AV block in a patient with a probable 
pre-existing cardiological disease, and aggravated condition (in 2 patients). In addition, one SAE of 
severe bronchitis was considered related by the Sponsor only. All related SAEs resolved with 
corrective treatment, except for AV block which spontaneously resolved.

Two deaths have been reported in the supportive data, one during the CUP and one in a publication:  
- A 5-month infant, with biliary atresia and severe pulmonary arterial hypertension, had received 
propranolol for 13 days with good cardiovascular tolerance. She received five injections of 
lauromacrogol for sclerosis of oesophageal varices under general anaesthesia. Fifteen minutes after 
the last injection, she experienced an atrioventricular block grade 3, refractory to treatment,

followed by cardiac arrest and death of the infant in the following hours despite intensive 
resuscitations measures. Causality of V0400SB was considered doubtful considering the context of 
occurrence and very close monitoring since propranolol initiation (FR-2011-1487). 
- One death was reported by Metry et al 2013. One patient with IH of the face, chest, back, neck, 
arm, hand, airway, and the gastro-intestinal tracts with PHACE syndrome was treated with oral 
propranolol 1 mg/kg/day in combination with corticosteroids at 2 mg/kg/day. Although IH response 
was considered excellent the patient experienced severe sleeping disturbances and worsening of 
peripheral arteriopathy with digital infarction leading to death after 16 months of propranolol 
treatment. 
Laboratory findings 
Glycaemia: Propranolol prevents the response of endogenous catecholamines to correct 
hypoglycaemia and also masks the adrenergic warning signs of hypoglycaemia, particularly 
tachycardia, palpitations and sweating. Therefore blood glucose levels were monitored. It should be 
noted that the majority of patients in each pooled dose group had no change in glycaemia category 
during the 4h post-dose period, and the predose value were similar at each up-titration phase. The 
number of patients with decreasing shift in glycaemia category was low (less than 15% in each 
groups) and similar in placebo or propranolol groups.  
Other biochemistry parameters: the normal ranges for each biochemistry parameter were used to 
categorize patients as having low, normal or high values at each visit and the number of patients 
who had shifts in category from the baseline value. No change from baseline in category was the 
most common outcome for most biochemistry parameters. Several cases of high potassium values 
and blood potassium increase were observed in the safety database, this important risk should be 
further discussed.  
Haematology: The known safety profile of propranolol did not show a deleterious impact on 
haematological parameters. The number of study drug related AEs is very low, thus no signal was 
detected 
Neutropenia: a review of all grade 4 neutropenia has been performed. 9 cases have been identified. 
Out of the 9 cases of grade 4 neutropenia: 
- 2 patients (520104 and 160210) had grade 4 neutropenia at screening (one in placebo and the 
other in the propranolol 1mg/kg/d group); the value was normalized at week 24 with no clinical 
signs of infection. Therefore it’s unlikely that the study drug played any role on these cases. 
- the other 7 patients (all of them in a propranolol treatment groups) had screening values from 
normal to grade 3 neutropenia, all of them presented worsening of the screening value up to grade 
4 neutropenia during treatment and related mild infectious condition. Five out of the seven patients 
had the infectious condition during the propranolol treatment, one patient (050805) had the 
infectious condition during the 3 months placebo treatment but after 3 months of propranolol 
treatment, and one patient (810107) had the infectious condition after the end of 6 months 
propranolol treatment.

Vital signs 
The 6 adverse events of hypotension on the pivotal study were all asymptomatic and were not 
serious or severe in intensity. Bradycardia was more common with the higher dose of V0400SB but 
overall numbers were too small to make meaningful comparisons. On ECG, the PR interval 
increased from the pre-dose values at +2h and +4h on each day of dose increase, with a greater 
increase observed with V0400SB than with placebo. The PR interval prolongation observed with 
V0400SB is in line with the known effects of propranolol as well as with the physiological increase 
with age TEAEs of QT prolongation were reported for 3 patients during uptitration and 1 patient 
after uptitration. These TEAEs were asymptomatic and were not serious. There were no relevant 
findings regarding respiratory rate, body temperature, or physical exam (height, weight, and head 
circumference). 
Safety in special populations 
By Age: IH growth mostly occurs before 5 months, therefore to target the proliferative phase of IH, 
patients in this study were aged 35-150 days at randomization. In addition, a previous study 
showed that 80% of the full IH size is reached during the early proliferative stage at a mean age of 
3 months (i.e. 90 days). Therefore patients were stratified by at randomization into 2 age 
categories: 35-90 days and 91-150 days. No differences were observed in the occurrence of TEAEs 
of special interest (hypotension, bradycardia, bronchospasm and hypoglycaemia) between the two 
age categories, although low patient numbers did not allow for robust comparisons to be made. By 
Gender: No differences were observed in the occurrence of TEAEs of special interest (hypotension, 
bradycardia, bronchospasm and hypoglycaemia) between males and females, although low patient 
numbers did not allow for robust comparisons to be made. By IH Localization: Comparison of 
patients with facial and non-facial IH within each regimen for each demographic parameter showed 
variability, but no obvious patterns of differences. Overall, no meaningful differences in the safety 
profile arose upon an analysis of patient subgroups (age, sex, IH localization, prematurity, or birth 
weight) in comparison with the overall pooled population were found but premature patients are 
still considered as higher risk patients.  
Withdrawal and Rebound: From the data provided, 11% of patients of the 3mg/kg/day 6 months 
regimen required reintroduction of a systemic treatment; However the real rebound effect will be 
more accurately assessed when the long term safety data post-treatment withdrawal up to Week 96 
will be available in Q2 2014. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Concomitant use of propranolol is not recommended with bradycardia –inducing calcium-channel 
blockers (diltiazem, verapamil, bepridil). Co-administration with propranolol can cause altered 
automaticity (excessive bradycardia, sinus arrest), sino-atrial and atrio-ventricular conduction 
disorders, and increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias (torsades de pointes) along with heart 
failure. This combination must only be administered under close clinical and ECG monitoring, 
particularly at the start of the treatment. 
Caution should be exercised when proporanolol is administered in combination with cardiovascular 
medicinal products such as antiarrhythmics. Propafenone has negative inotropic and beta-blocking 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/8171/2014 
Page 66/86 
 
  
  
 
properties that can be additive to those of propranolol, despite a reassuring study in healthy 
volunteers. The metabolism of propranolol is reduced by co-administration of quinidine, leading to 
a 2- to 3- fold increased blood concentration and greater degrees of clinical beta-blockade.  
Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent with negative chronotropic properties that may be additive 
to those seen with β-blockers such as propranolol. Automatism and conduction disorders are 
expected because of the suppression of sympathetic compensative mechanisms. The metabolism of 
intravenous lidocaine is inhibited by co-administration of propranolol, resulting in a 25% increase in 
lidocaine concentrations. Lidocaine toxicity (neurological and cardiac adverse events) has been 
reported following co-administration with propranolol. 
Both digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart 
rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia. 
Caution should be exercised when patients receiving a beta blocker are administered a 
dihydropyridine. Both agents may induce hypotension, heart failure in patients whose cardiac 
function is partially controlled because of additive inotropic effects. Reduction of reflex sympathetic 
response involved when excessive distal vasodilatation. 
When combined with beta-blockers, drugs that decrease arterial pressure (ACE Inhibitors, 
angiotensin II-receptors antagonists, diuretics, alpha-blockers whatever the indication, 
centrally-acting antihypertensives, reserpine, etc) can cause or major hypotension, notably 
orthostatic. With centrally-acting antihypertensives, beta-blockers may exacerbate the rebound 
hypertension after clonidine abrupt withdrawal, and propranolol should be stopped several days 
before discontinuing clonidine. 
Patients with infantile haemangioma may be at increased risk if they have received or are 
concomitantly receiving treatment with corticosteroids because adrenal suppression may result in 
loss of the counterregulatory cortisol response and increase the risk of hypoglycaemia. This also 
applies when children are breastfed by mothers treated with corticosteroids in case of high dosage 
or prolonged treatment. 
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) have been reported to blunt the antihypertensive 
effect of beta-blocking agents. 
Drugs that induce postural hypotension (nitrates derivatives, type 5-phosphodiesterase inhibitors, 
tricyclic antidepressants, antipsychotics, dopaminergic agonists, levodopa, amifostine, baclofen…) 
may add their effects to that of betablockers. 
Blood levels of propranolol may be decreased by co-administration of enzyme inducers like 
rifampicin or phenobarbital. 
All beta-blocking agents can mask certain symptoms of hypoglycaemia: palpitations and 
tachycardia. Use of propranolol alongside hypoglycaemic therapy in diabetic patients should be with 
caution since it may prolong the hypoglycaemic response to insulin. In this case, inform the 
caregiver, and increase monitoring of blood glucose levels, particularly at the start of treatment. 
Co-administration of cholestyramine or colestipol with propranolol resulted in up to 50% decrease 
in propranolol concentrations.

Halogenated anaesthetic agents may depress myocardial contractility and vascular compensating 
response when administered with propranolol. Beta stimulating agents may be used to counteract 
the beta-blockade. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In total, in the pooled safety population, 26 TEAEs leading to definitive study drug discontinuation 
were reported for 22 patients. The percentage of patients reporting TEAEs leading to definitive 
study drug discontinuation was slightly higher in the pooled placebo group (4.7%) than in each 
pooled V0400SB group: 2.0% in the pooled V0400SB 1 mg/kg/day group and 3.1% in the pooled 
V0400SB 3 mg/kg/day group. No emergent preferred term was identified to induce treatment 
discontinuation, but in 5 cases, the drugs discontinuation was due to lack of efficacy (3 cases of 
condition aggravated, 2 drug ineffective), all in the placebo group

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In clinical trials for proliferating infantile haemangioma, the most frequently reported adverse drug 
reactions in infant treated with Hemangiol were sleep disorders, aggravated respiratory tract 
infections such as bronchitis and bronchiolitis associated with cough and fever, diarrhoea, and 
vomiting.  
Globally, the most severe adverse reactions reported in the compassionate use program and in 
literature concerned hypoglycaemia (and related event like hypoglycaemic seizure) and aggravated 
respiratory tract infections with respiratory distress. 
The 4 major identified risks of propranolol are hypoglycaemia, bradycardia, hypotension and 
bronchospasm. As a consequence, a number of precautions should be taken when children are 
treated with Hemangiol. 
Prior to initiating propranolol therapy, a screening for the risks associated with propranolol use must 
be performed. An analysis of the medical history and a full clinical examination must be performed 
including heart rate, cardiac and pulmonary auscultation. 
In case of suspected cardiac abnormality, a specialist advice must be sought before treatment 
initiation to determine any subjacent contra-indication.  
In case of acute broncho-pulmonary abnormality, the initiation of the treatment should be 
postponed. 
Propranolol, due to its pharmacological action, may cause or worsen bradycardia or blood pressure 
abnormalities. After the first intake and each dose increase, physicians are advised to monitor the 
clinical and heart rate, including blood pressure and heart rate must be performed at least hourly for 
at least 2 hours. In case of symptomatic bradycardia or bradycardia under 80 bpm, immediate 
specialist advice must be sought. In case of severe and/or symptomatic bradycardia or hypotension 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/8171/2014 
Page 68/86 
 
  
  
 
occurring at any time during treatment, treatment must be discontinued and a specialist advice 
should be sought. 
Propranolol prevents the response of endogenous catecholamines to correct hypoglycaemia. It 
masks the adrenergic warning signs of hypoglycaemia, particularly tachycardia, shakiness, anxiety 
and hunger. It can aggravate hypoglycaemia in children, especially in case of fasting, vomiting or 
overdose. 
These hypoglycaemic episodes associated with the taking of propranolol may present exceptionally 
in the form of seizures and/or coma. As a consequence, if clinical signs of hypoglycaemia occur, it 
is necessary to make the child drink a sugary liquid solution and to temporarily stop the treatment. 
Appropriate monitoring of the child is required until symptoms disappear. In children with diabetes, 
blood glucose monitoring should be increased. 
In the event of lower respiratory tract infection associated with dyspnoea and wheezing, treatment 
should be temporarily discontinued. The administration of beta2 agonists and inhaled 
corticosteroids is possible. The readministration of propranolol may be considered when the child 
has fully recovered; in case of reoccurrence, treatment should be permanently discontinued. In the 
event of isolated bronchospasm, treatment must be permanently discontinued. 
Sympathetic stimulation may be a vital component supporting circulatory function in patients with 
congestive heart failure, and its inhibition by beta blockade may precipitate more severe failure. 
There are very limited safety data of propranolol in PHACE syndrome patients available. Propranolol 
may increase the risk of stroke in PHACE syndrome patients with severe cerebrovascular anomalies 
by dropping blood pressure and attenuating flow through occluded, narrow, or stenotic vessels.  
Therefore, infants with large facial infantile haemangioma should be thoroughly investigated for 
potential arteriopathy associated with PHACE syndrome, with magnetic resonance angiography of 
the head and neck and cardiac imaging to include the aortic arch, prior to considering propranolol 
therapy. 
Since propranolol passes through breast milk, mothers being treated with propranolol who 
breastfeed their infant should inform their health care professional. 
Beta-blockers will result in an attenuation of reflex tachycardia and an increased risk of 
hypotension. It is necessary to alert the anaesthetist to the fact that the patient is being treated 
with beta-blockers. Therefore, when a patient is scheduled for surgery, beta-blocker therapy should 
be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to the procedure. 
Cases of hyperkalaemia have been reported in patients with large ulcerated haemangioma. A 
monitoring of electrolyte should be performed in these patients. 
No relevant difference was observed in the safety profile based on the age (35-90 days or 90-150 
days), the prematurity, the sex or the IH localisation. However, as infants born prematurely are at 
higher risk of undesirable events, special care should be taken to them.  
Discontinuation rate due to adverse events was low, 11 cases (4.7%) were reported in the placebo 
arm and 11 (2.6%) in the propranolol arm.   
During the pivotal study (study 201), patients between 5 weeks and 5 months were monitored 
every 3-4 weeks and recalculation of the dose was performed according to body weight. The 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/8171/2014

applicant has presented calculations showing the difference between the actual dose received and 
the theoretical dose based on body weight with adjustments every month from W5 to W24 (as 
planned in the protocol). On average, patients were under-dosed by 6.66% with monthly 
adjustments as compared to 11.9% when adjustments are every 2 months (as proposed in the 
SmPC). The CHMP agrees with the applicant that underdosage of 6-7% will not have any impact on 
safety. 
The complementary safety data from the CUP and scientific publications since 2008 are in line with 
the safety profile shown in the pivotal study and does not add any new safety signal.  
The inspection of the pivotal trial showed that the AE section of the submitted CSR was incomplete; 
the Applicant has therefore submitted an update of the safety database. One hundred and sixty 
seven (167) diaries are still missing, but no new information impacting the benefit/risk profile can 
be expected. The new analysis performed by the Applicant leads to the inclusion of 126 AEs 
collected over the W0-W24/EOT period, which represented 5.4% of the total AEs reported (2298) in 
the study over this period. No new SAE or death has been added. Thus, this update did not modify 
the overall safety profile of propranolol in the claimed indication. The Applicant performed new 
analysis of the 9 reported cases of neutropenia and a literature review regarding this risk in the 
target population. No case has been identified in this review and no formal conclusion can be made: 
the unbalance of cases between groups can be explained by the lower duration of exposure in the 
placebo arm and these cases may be due to transient neutropenia following benign viral and/or 
bacterial childhood infections.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing 
have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Propranolol is a well-known substance, used both in adults and children for many years. The overall 
safety profile of propranolol in patients with proliferating infantile haemangioma is considered 
acceptable on the basis of the data submitted. The update of the safety database after the issues 
which had arisen during the GCP inspection of the pivotal trial did not modify the overall safety 
profile in the target population.  The safety profile in younger children or of long-term exposure 
beyond 6 months cannot be established at the present time. A close monitoring of identified risks 
(hypotension, bradycardia, hypoglycaemia and bronchospasm) at the initiation of treatment and at 
each dose increase, as well as throughout the treatment is essential; recommendations have been 
included in the product information. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considers that the pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the 
legislative requirements and provides adequate evidence that the applicant has the services of a 
qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance and has the necessary means for the notification 
of any adverse reaction suspected of occurring either in the Community or in a third country.

Hypoglycaemia and 
Proposed text in SmPC: 
related seizures 
Section 4.2: HEMANGIOL is to be taken during or right after a 
feeding to avoid the risk of hypoglycaemia. It should be 
administered directly into the child's mouth using a graduated oral 
syringe, calibrated in mg of propranolol, supplied with the oral 
solution bottle. 
If the child is not eating or is vomiting it is recommended to skip the 
dose.  
HEMANGIOL and the feed must be given by the same person in 
order to avoid the risk of hypoglycaemia. If different people are 
involved, good communication is essential in order to ensure the 
safety of the child. 
Section 4.3: Subjects prone to hypoglycaemia;  
Premature infants, for whom the corrected age of 5 weeks has not 
been reached 
Section 4.4: Propranolol prevents the response of endogenous 
catecholamines to correct hypoglycaemia. It masks the adrenergic 
warning signs of hypoglycaemia, particularly tachycardia, 
palpitations and sweating. It can aggravate hypoglycaemia in 
children, especially in case of fasting, vomiting or overdose. 
These hypoglycaemic episodes associated with the taking of 
propranolol may present exceptionally in the form of seizures 
and/or coma. 
If clinical signs of hypoglycaemia occur, it is necessary to make the 
child drink a sugary liquid solution and to temporarily stop the 
treatment. Appropriate monitoring of the child is required until 
symptoms disappear.

Proposed text in leaflet: 
In section what you need to know before your child receives 
HEMANGIOL 
Do not give HEMANGIOL if your child: 
• 
is born prematurely and he/she has not reached the corrected 
age of 5 weeks (the corrected age being calculated by 
substracting the number of weeks premature from the actual 
age). 
•  weighs less than 2 kg. 
• 
is prone to low blood sugar level. 
In section Warning 
This medicine can mask the warning signs of hypoglycaemia (also 
known as low blood sugar level), especially if the baby is fasting, 
vomiting or in case of overdose. These signs may be: 
•  Minor: pallor, tiredness, sweating, shakiness, palpitations, 
anxiety, hunger, difficulty waking up. 
•  Major: excessive sleeping, difficulty to get a response, poor 
feeding, temperature decrease, convulsions (fits), brief pauses 
in breathing, loss of consciousness. 
To avoid risks of hypoglycaemia, your child must be fed regularly 
during treatment. If your child is not eating, develops another 
illness or is vomiting, it is recommended to skip the dose. Do not 
give HEMANGIOL to your child until he has been correctly fed again.  
If your child has any signs of hypoglycaemia while taking 
HEMANGIOL, administer if possible oral liquid containing sugar and, 
if symptoms persist, call your doctor right away or go directly to

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The results of the pivotal phase 3 study showed compelling evidence of efficacy for the 3mg/kg/day 
dosing regimen administered for 6 months in the treatment of proliferating IH requiring systemic 
therapy. Two patients (3.6%) in the placebo 6 months regimen and 61 patients (60.4%) in the 3 
mg/kg/day 6 months regimen presented complete or nearly complete resolution of their IH 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/8171/2014 
Page 82/86 
 
  
  
 
between baseline and Week 24. The combined p-value (<0.0001) showed that the difference was 
highly statistically significant. The results on the secondary efficacy endpoints supported the 
primary endpoint from central readers, however placebo get better results on the investigator’s and 
parents’ on site assessment. The efficacy results seem similar by age group and haemangioma 
localization.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
Uncertainty about long-term effect treatment  
Uncertainties still remain on the real rebound rate. Preliminary data from the pivotal study shows 
that approximately 11% of the patients required reintroduction of systemic therapy after week 24; 
but data from the 96 weeks follow-up period is not yet available. The Applicant should provide the 
information about the clinical outcome of those who required reintroduction of systemic therapy 
and efficacy maintenance at week 96. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Adverse events (and AE related to the study drug) were experienced by 65.3% of patients (14.8% 
related) in the pooled placebo group and 86.8% of patients (36.3% related) in the pooled all 
V0400SB group, with no difference between V0400SB dose groups. The most common adverse 
events considered as related to study drug were peripheral coldness, diarrhoea, sleep disorder, and 
nightmare, all of which are known side effects of propranolol. Most adverse events were of mild or 
moderate maximum intensity, with a first onset before or on the Week 12 visit and most patients 
recovered. No dose-dependence was seen for the most common adverse events except for 
diarrhoea and bronchitis.  
Hypoglycaemia, bradycardia, hypotension, and bronchospasm are important identified risks known 
to occur with propranolol in infants and were reported in the pooled safety population 
hypoglycaemia (2 patients), bradycardia (2 patients), hypotension (total 6 patients including 1 on 
placebo) and bronchospasm (total 4 patients including 2 on placebo). In general, the SAEs reported 
in the pooled safety population corresponded to the known safety profile of propranolol; no new 
safety signals have been identified. 
The GCP inspection of the pivotal trial highlighted that the safety profile of propranolol in the target 
population could be incomplete. As a consequence, the Applicant submitted an update of the safety 
database. Nine cases of neutropenia have been reported: the unbalance of cases between groups 
can be explained by the lower duration of exposure in the placebo arm and these cases may be due 
to transient neutropenia following benign viral and/or bacterial childhood infections. No formal 
conclusion can be made on the additional data. Thus, this information was included in the SmPC and 
the RMP. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/8171/2014

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Long-term effect beyond 6 months of treatment with propranolol treatment could not be assessed. 
This information will be provided in the context of study V0400SB201 long term safety follow-up 
and in a drug utilisation study (see section 2.8). 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The effects of the treatment are clinically relevant as Hemangiol showed complete or nearly 
complete resolution of IH in more than 60 % of the patients.  
The safety profile did not show new safety signals than those already known for propranolol and 
w2as overall acceptable, given the benefits observed.  
Benefit-risk balance 
The benefit-risk balance is considered as positive 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The efficacy of propranolol for the treatment of proliferating infantile haemangioma requiring 
systemic therapy:  Life- or function-threatening haemangioma, ulcerated haemangioma with pain 
and/or lack of response to simple wound care measures, haemangioma with a risk of permanent 
scars or disfigurement, is supported by a single pivotal trial. 
Propranolol, at the dosage of 3 mg/kg/day for 6 months, demonstrated a statistically significant 
effect on the complete/nearly complete resolution of target IH in the studied population.  The safety 
profile of propranolol in the current submission is in line with the one’s already known for this 
substance.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Hemangiol in the treatment of proliferating infantile haemangioma 
requiring systemic therapy: 
- Life- or function-threatening haemangioma, 
- Ulcerated haemangioma with pain and/or lack of response to simple wound care measures, 
- Haemangioma with a risk of permanent scars or disfigurement. 
It is to be initiated in infants aged 5 weeks to 5 months (see section 4.2).

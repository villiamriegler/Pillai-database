Each 20 mL vial contains 500 μg ziconotide (as acetate). 
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Solution for infusion (infusion). 
Clear, colourless solution. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Prialt is indicated for the treatment of severe, chronic pain in adults who require intrathecal (IT) 
analgesia. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with ziconotide should only be undertaken by physicians experienced in intrathecal (IT) 
administration of medicinal products. 
Patients should undergo a neuropsychiatric evaluation before, after starting and during intrathecal 
ziconotide and immediately when any depressive signs or symptoms appear. (See Section 4.3, 4.4, 4.8 
and 5.1). 
Posology 
Dose initiation 
Dosing of ziconotide should be initiated at no more than 2.4 μg/day and titrated on an individual 
patient basis according to analgesic response and adverse reactions. 
Dose titration 
For each dose titration, assess the dosing requirements and adjust the pump infusion flow rate as 
required to achieve the new dosing. 
Patients may be titrated in dose increments of ≤ 2.4 μg/day, up to a maximum dose of 21.6 μg/day. 
The minimal interval between dose increases is 24 hours; the recommended interval, for safety 
reasons, is 48 hours or more.  
The maximum daily dose is 21.6 µg/day (0.9 µg/h). 
The median dose at response is approximately 6.0 μg/day and approximately 75% of responsive 
patients required ≤ 9.6 μg/day in placebo-controlled clinical trials. However, to limit the occurrence of 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
serious adverse reactions, reports from clinical practice indicate that responsive patients may require a 
smaller daily dose of approximately 3.0 - 4.5 µg/d or lower. 
Adjust the dose of intrathecal ziconotide according to the severity of pain, the patient’s response to 
therapy, and the occurrence of adverse reactions.  
General management of side effects 
If necessary the dose can be decreased by any amount (including stopping the infusion) for the 
management of adverse reactions. 
Stopping rule 
Treatment should be discontinued in case of lack or insufficient efficacy, defined as pain reduction by 
less than 20% at the maximal tolerated dose. The benefit/risk should always be evaluated by the 
physician on an individual basis. 
Renal impairment 
Studies have not been conducted in patients with impaired renal function. Caution should be exercised 
when ziconotide is administered to patients with impaired renal function. 
Hepatic impairment 
Studies have not been conducted in patients with impaired hepatic function. Caution should be 
exercised when ziconotide is administered to patients with impaired hepatic function. 
Older patients ≥ 65 years of age 
Dose adjustment is not required in older adults. However, it should be taken into account that renal 
and/or hepatic insufficiency is more common in patients ≥ 65 years of age. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of ziconotide in children aged 0 to 18 years have not been established. 
No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Intrathecal use. 
Ziconotide must be administered as a continuous infusion via an intrathecal catheter, using an external 
or internally implanted mechanical infusion pump capable of delivering an accurate infusion volume. 
As the risk of meningitis secondary to prolonged catheterisation of the intrathecal space is greater with 
an external catheter infusion system, internal systems are recommended to administer ziconotide for 
prolonged periods (see section 4.4). An external catheter system should only be used when an internal 
system cannot be implanted. 
When low doses of ziconotide are required, for example when initiating titration, ziconotide must be 
diluted before use with preservative-free sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. 
For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Combination with IT chemotherapy (see section 4.5).

Pre-existing history of psychosis with ziconotide.  
History of suicidal attempt or suicidal ideation with ziconotide.(see Section 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8). 
Infection at the microinfusion injection site, uncontrolled bleeding diathesis, and spinal canal 
obstruction that impairs circulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Patients should undergo a neuropsychiatric evaluation before, after starting and during intrathecal 
ziconotide, and immediately when any depressive signs or symptoms appear (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 
4.8). 
Caregivers should contact a physician immediately if the patient experiences symptoms of potentially 
life-threatening adverse event. 
Long-term use 
Although ziconotide has been studied in long-term, open label efficacy and safety clinical trials, 
controlled studies of longer than 3 weeks duration have not been conducted (see section 5.1). Possible 
long-term local toxic effects on the spinal cord have not been excluded and preclinical data in this 
respect are limited (see section 5.3). Therefore, caution is needed during long-term treatment. 
Risk of infection 
The administration of medicinal products by the intrathecal (IT) route carries the risk of potentially 
serious infections, such as meningitis, which may be life threatening. Meningitis due to the entrance of 
organisms along the catheter track or inadvertent contamination of the infusion system is a known 
complication of intrathecal medicinal product administration, especially with external systems. 
Patients and physicians must be vigilant for typical symptoms and signs of meningitis. 
The optimal intrathecal placement of the catheter tip has not been established. Lower catheter tip 
placement, e.g. at the lumbar level, may reduce the incidence of ziconotide-related neurological 
adverse reactions. Therefore, catheter tip placement should be carefully considered to allow adequate 
access to spinal nociceptive segments whilst minimising medicinal product concentrations at cerebral 
levels. 
Only a small number of patients have received systemic chemotherapy and IT ziconotide. Caution 
should be exercised when ziconotide is administered to patients who are receiving systemic 
chemotherapy (see section 4.5).

Elevations in creatine kinase 
Elevations in creatine kinase, which are usually asymptomatic, are common amongst patients on 
intrathecal ziconotide. Progressive elevation of the creatine kinase is uncommon. However, monitoring 
of creatine kinase is recommended. In the event of progressive elevation, or clinically significant 
elevation in association with clinical features of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis, discontinuation of 
ziconotide should be considered. 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have not been observed during clinical trials and the 
immunogenicity of ziconotide administered by the IT route appears to be low. However, the potential 
for severe allergic reactions cannot be excluded and spontaneous reports of anaphylactic reactions 
have been received. 
Cognitive and neuropsychiatric adverse reactions 
Cognitive and neuropsychiatric adverse reactions, particularly confusion, are common in patients 
treated with ziconotide. Cognitive impairment typically appears after several weeks of treatment. 
Episodes of acute psychiatric disturbances, such as hallucinations, paranoid reactions, hostility, 
aggressiveness, delirium, psychosis and manic reactions have been reported in patients treated with 
ziconotide. The ziconotide dose should be reduced or discontinued if signs or symptoms of cognitive 
impairment or neuropsychiatric adverse reactions develop, but other contributing causes should also be 
considered. The cognitive effects of ziconotide are typically reversible within 1 - 4 weeks after 
discontinuation of the medicinal product, but may persist in some cases. It is recommended that 
patients undergo a neuropsychiatric evaluation before and after starting intrathecal ziconotide. 
In patients with severe chronic pain there is a higher incidence of suicide and suicide attempts than in 
the general population. Ziconotide may cause or worsen depression with the risk of suicide in 
susceptible patients. Patients with a history of suicide-related events prior to commencement of 
treatment are known to be at greater risk of suicidal thoughts or suicidal behaviour, and should receive 
careful monitoring during treatment. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek 
medical advice should signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge. Patients with a pre-existing 
history of suicidal attempt with ziconotide should not be given ziconotide again. Ziconotide is 
contraindicated in patients with a history of suicidal attempt or ideation with ziconotide (section 4.3). 
Depression of Central Nervous System (CNS) 
Patients have experienced depressed levels of consciousness while receiving ziconotide. The patient 
usually remains conscious and breathing is not depressed. The event may be self-limited, but 
ziconotide should be discontinued until the event resolves. The re-introduction of ziconotide is not 
recommended in these patients. Withdrawal of concomitant CNS depressant medicinal products 
should also be considered as they may contribute to the reduced level of arousal. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Specific clinical medicinal product interaction studies have not been conducted with ziconotide. 
However, low plasma ziconotide concentrations, metabolism by ubiquitous peptidases and relatively 
low plasma protein binding (see section 5.2) make metabolic-based interactions or plasma protein 
displacement type interactions between ziconotide and other medicinal products unlikely. 
No clinical data are available on the interaction between IT chemotherapy and IT ziconotide. 
Ziconotide is contraindicated in combination with IT chemotherapy (see section 4.3). 
Only a small number of patients have received systemic chemotherapy and IT ziconotide. Caution 
should be exercised when ziconotide is administered to patients who are receiving systemic 
chemotherapy (see section 4.4). 
Medicinal products that affect specific peptidases/proteases would not be expected to impact upon 
ziconotide plasma exposure. Based on very limited clinical investigations, both angiotensin converting 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
enzyme inhibitors (e.g., benazepril, lisinopril and moexipril) and HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., 
ritonavir, saquinavir, indinavir), have no readily apparent effect on plasma ziconotide exposure. 
Ziconotide does not interact with opiate receptors. If discontinuing opiates when initiating ziconotide 
therapy, opiate withdrawal should be gradual. For patients being withdrawn from IT opiates, the IT 
opiate infusion dose should be gradually tapered over a few weeks and replaced with a 
pharmacologically equivalent dose of oral opiates. Adding IT ziconotide to stable doses of IT 
morphine (see section 5.1), is possible but requires special attention, as a high rate of neuropsychiatric 
adverse reactions (confusion/thinking abnormal, paranoid reactions and hallucinations, and abnormal 
gait), some of them serious, was observed in Study 202 despite a low dose of ziconotide. Vomiting and 
anorexia, and peripheral oedema were also observed when IT ziconotide was added to IT morphine. 
The addition of IT morphine to stable doses of IT ziconotide is better tolerated (pruritus has been 
reported) (see section 5.1). 
An increased incidence of somnolence has been observed when ziconotide is administered 
concomitantly with systemic baclofen, clonidine, bupivacaine or propofol thus for the time being their 
simultaneous use is discouraged. 
No data are available regarding the concomitant use of partial opioid agonists (e.g. buprenorphine) 
with ziconotide. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of ziconotide in pregnant women. 
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Ziconotide is  not recommended  during  pregnancy  and  in  women  of  childbearing  potential  not  using 
contraception.  
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether ziconotide/metabolites are excreted in human milk. 
A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded.  
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Prialt 
therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the 
woman. 
Fertility 
No specific studies with ziconotide in humans have been conducted to evaluate effects on fertility. In a 
study on male and female fertility in rats no effects in males while reductions in corpora lutea; 
implantation sites and number of live embryos were observed in females (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Prialt has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Ziconotide may cause confusion, somnolence and other neurological adverse reactions, therefore 
patients must be advised not to drive or operate machines if affected.

Summary of the safety profile 
The safety of ziconotide administered as a continuous intrathecal infusion has been evaluated in more 
than 1,400 patients participating in acute and chronic pain clinical trials. The duration of treatment has 
ranged from one-hour bolus infusion to continuous use for more than 6 years. The median exposure 
time was 43 days. The infusion dose rate ranged from 0.03 - 912 μg/day, with a median final dose rate 
of 7.2 μg/day. 
In clinical trials, 88% of patients experienced adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions 
reported in long-term clinical trials were dizziness (42%), nausea (30%), nystagmus (23%), 
confusional state (25%), gait abnormal (16%), memory impairment (13%), vision blurred (14%), 
headache (12%), asthenia (13%), vomiting (11%), and somnolence (10%). Most adverse reactions 
were mild to moderate in severity and resolved over time.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Meningitis 
Administration of medicinal products by the intrathecal route carries the risk of potential serious 
infections, such as meningitis, which may be life threatening. Patients and physicians must be vigilant 
for typical symptoms and signs of meningitis (see section 4.4). 
Elevations of creatine phosphokinase 
Elevations in creatine phosphokinase were usually asymptomatic. Monitoring of creatine 
phosphokinase is recommended. Discontinuation of ziconotide should be considered in the event of 
progressive or significant elevation of creatine phosphokinase in association with clinical features of 
myopathy or rhabdomyolysis (see section 4.4). 
CNS adverse reactions 
Cognitive and neuropsychiatric adverse reactions are common in patients treated with ziconotide. 
Cognitive impairment typically appears after several weeks of treatment. Episodes of acute psychiatric 
disturbances, such as hallucinations, paranoid reactions, hostility, aggressiveness, delirium, psychosis 
and manic reactions have been reported in patients treated with ziconotide. The ziconotide dose should 
be reduced or discontinued if signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment or neuropsychiatric adverse 
reactions develop, but other contributing causes should also be considered. The cognitive effects of 
ziconotide are typically reversible within 1 - 4 weeks after discontinuation of the medicinal product, 
but may persist in some cases.  
The available data do not exclude the possibility of an increased risk of suicide when using ziconotide. 
Prialt is contra-indicated in patients with a history of suicidal attempt or suicidal ideation with 
ziconotide (section 4.3). It is recommended that patients undergo a neuropsychiatric evaluation before 
and after starting intrathecal ziconotide (see section 4.2 and 4.4).

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In intravenous infusion studies, healthy male volunteers received ziconotide at doses of up to 
70,000 μg/day or 3,200 times the maximum recommended daily intrathecal infusion dose. Postural 
hypotension was observed in almost all subjects who received high intravenous doses of ziconotide. 
The maximum recommended intrathecal dose is 21.6 μg/day. The maximum intended intrathecal dose 
of ziconotide in clinical trials was 912 μg/day following upward titration over 7 days. 
Symptoms 
In one clinical study a male cancer patient received an accidental IT ziconotide overdose of 744 μg 
over a 24-hour period (31 μg/hour) and resumed treatment at the intended dose after experiencing a 
reduction in Visual Analog Scale of Pain Intensity (VASPI) from 82 to 2.5 mm. In some patients who 
received intrathecal doses greater than the maximum recommended dose, exaggerated 
pharmacological effects, e.g., ataxia, nystagmus, dizziness, stupor, depressed level of consciousness, 
muscle spasms, confusional state, sedation, hypotension, aphasia, speech disorder, nausea and 
vomiting were observed. There was no indication of respiratory depression. Most patients under 
observation recovered within 24 hours of withdrawal of the medicinal product. 
Management 
General medical supportive measures should be administered to patients who receive an overdose until 
the exaggerated pharmacological effects of the medicinal product have resolved. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Analgesics, other analgesics and antipyretics, ATC code: N02BG08 
Mechanism of action 
Ziconotide is a synthetic analogue of a ω-conopeptide, MVIIA, found in the venom of the Conus 
magus marine snail. It is an N-type calcium channel blocker (NCCB). NCCs regulate neurotransmitter 
release in specific neuronal populations responsible for the spinal processing of pain. In binding to 
these neuronal NCCs ziconotide inhibits the voltage sensitive calcium current into primary nociceptive 
afferents terminating in the superficial layers of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. In turn, this inhibits 
their release of neurotransmitters (including Substance P) and therefore, the spinal signalling of pain. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Though statistically significant relationships and reasonable correlation between cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) exposure (AUC, Cmax) and clinical response measures have been observed following 1 hour IT 
administration, no well-defined dose-concentration-response relationships have yet been identified. 
Many responsive patients obtain near-maximal analgesia within a few hours of delivery of an 
appropriate dose. However, maximal effects may be delayed in some patients. Given the occurrence of 
analgesia and adverse reactions at similar doses, the recommended minimum interval between dose 
increases is 24 hours; the recommended interval, for safety reasons, is 48 hours or more. If necessary 
the dose can be decreased by any amount (including stopping the infusion) for the management of 
adverse reactions. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Nervous system adverse reactions, particularly dizziness, nausea and abnormal gait appear to be 
correlated with CSF exposure, though a definitive relationship has not been established. 
Low plasma exposure occurs during IT infusion due to the low recommended IT infusion rates and 
relatively rapid plasma clearance (see section 5.2). Therefore, pharmacological effects related to 
systemic exposure should be minimal. 
The median dose at response is approximately 6.0 μg/day and approximately 75% of responsive 
patients required ≤ 9.6 μg/day in placebo-controlled clinical trials. However, to limit the occurrence of 
serious adverse reactions, reports from clinical practice indicate that responsive patients may require a 
smaller daily dose of approximately 3.0 - 4.5 µg/d or lower.  
To limit the occurrence of serious adverse reactions, a low starting dose and slow titration interval is 
recommended, always considering the narrow therapeutic window. A maximum dose of 21.6 μg/day is 
recommended. 
However, in clinical trials it has been observed that patients who tolerate doses of 21.6 μg/day 
following slow titration over a 3 to 4-week period, generally tolerate higher doses up to 48.0 μg/day. 
There is no evidence of the development of pharmacological tolerance to ziconotide in patients. 
However, in view of limited data, the development of tolerance cannot be excluded. Examination of 
the patency of the intrathecal catheter should be considered if the required ziconotide dose continually 
increases and there is no benefit or increase in adverse reactions. 
Alternative dosing regimens including initiation of dosing with lower doses of ziconotide and bolus 
administration have been explored in a limited number of studies available in the literature. 
Bolus administration studies suggest that bolus dosing may be useful in identifying patients who may 
benefit from long term use of ziconotide, however, bolus administration may result in more adverse 
reactions than administration by continuous infusion. These studies suggest that alternative methods of 
administration of ziconotide may be possible however, due to the limited numbers of patients, the 
results are inconclusive and there is currently insufficient evidence to make definitive 
recommendations for such alternative dosing regimens. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
There were three placebo-controlled clinical trials of IT ziconotide. 
Two short-term studies, 95-001 (malignant pain) and 96-002 (non-malignant pain), involving 
366 patients, demonstrated the efficacy of IT ziconotide in severe chronic pain using the percent 
change in Visual Analog Scale of Pain Intensity (VASPI) as the primary efficacy measure. These 
studies were of short duration, 5 and 6 days respectively, and used a more rapid dose escalation and 
higher doses than recommended in Section 4.2.

SD – Standard Deviation. 
The aetiologies of pain in studies 95-001 (malignant pain) and 96-002 (non-malignant pain) were 
varied and included bone pain (n = 38) mostly due to bone metastases (n = 34), myelopathy (n = 38), 
half of whom had spinal cord injury with paralysis (n = 19), neuropathy (n = 79), radiculopathy 
(n = 24), spinal pain (n = 91) mostly due to failed back surgery (n = 82), and other aetiologies (n = 82). 
Some patients had more than one cause of pain. The efficacy of IT ziconotide was apparent in all 
groups. 
Study 301 (n = 220) was of longer duration (21 days), involved more cautious up-titration and lower 
doses of IT ziconotide, and enrolled the most refractory population of patients studied in the three 
studies. All patients in the 301 study had failed IT therapy with combinations of analgesics and their 
physicians considered that 97% of the patients were refractory to currently available treatments. The 
majority had spinal pain (n = 134), especially failed back surgery (n = 110); a lower proportion had 
neuropathy (n = 36). Only five had malignant pain. The primary endpoint was the percent change in 
VASPI score. The efficacy of IT ziconotide in study 301 was lower than in the previous two, 
short-term studies. The frequency and severity of adverse reactions were also lower, mainly as a result 
of lower starting dose at 2.4 µg/d (0.1 µg/h). Titration was allowed after a minimum of 24 hours and 
dose increments were limited to 1.2-2.4 µg/d.

Post-marketing experience 
Since market authorization approval, real-world data were published for long-time pain management 
with ziconotide monotherapy in <100 patients. In patients responding to initial trialing (about 50% of 
patients), safe and effective utilization of ziconotide with low starting dose, low titration dose and less 
frequent titration intervals resulted in pain relief with improved safety profile compared to high initial 
dose and rapid titration. 
Combination studies with IT Morphine 
Clinical studies 201 and 202 indicate that the combination of IT ziconotide and IT morphine may 
effectively reduce pain and decrease systemic opioid use over a sustained period of time for patients 
whose pain was inadequately controlled with their maximum tolerated dose of IT ziconotide (median

ziconotide to stable doses of IT morphine, as with the initiation of IT ziconotide monotherapy, the 
appearance of psychotic adverse reactions (e.g., hallucinations, paranoid reactions) or discontinuation 
due to increased adverse reactions may occur (see section 4.5). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The CSF pharmacokinetics of ziconotide have been studied following one-hour IT infusions of 
1 - 10 μg of ziconotide in patients with chronic pain. The plasma pharmacokinetics following 
intravenous doses (0.3 – 10 μg/kg/24 h) were also studied. IT and intravenous pharmacokinetics data 
are summarised below.

CL = clearance; Vd = distribution volume; t½ = half life 
Absorption 
Following one-hour IT administration (1 – 10 μg), both cumulative exposure (AUC; range: 83.6 –
608 ng/h/mL) and peak exposure (Cmax; range: 16.4 – 132 ng/mL) values were variable and 
dose-dependent, but appeared only approximately dose-proportional. Plasma concentrations following 
continuous (≥ 48 h) IT infusion (≤ 21.6 μg/day) appear to be relatively low and typically undetectable 
(i.e., about 80% of plasma samples collected from pain patients contain no quantifiable medicinal 
product; < 0.04 ng/mL). No accumulation of ziconotide in plasma following long-term IT 
administration (up to 9 months) has been observed. 
Distribution 
Median ziconotide CSF volume of distribution (Vd: 99 mL) is between the spinal cord CSF volume 
(approximately 75 mL) and total CSF volume (approximately 130 mL). Ziconotide appears to 
distribute mainly within the CSF until transferred to the systemic circulation. Upon reaching the 
systemic circulation, ziconotide appears to be more extensively distributed, based on a plasma 
distribution volume of approximately 30 L and is only about 53% bound (non-specifically) to human 
plasma proteins. 
Biotransformation 
Ziconotide is a peptide consisting of 25 naturally-occurring amino acids of the L-configuration, and 
does not appear to be appreciably metabolised in the CSF. Following passage into the systemic 
circulation, ziconotide is expected to be primarily susceptible to proteolytic cleavage by various 
ubiquitous peptidases/proteases present in most organs (e.g., kidney, liver, lung, muscle, etc.), and thus 
degraded to peptide fragments and its individual constituent free amino acids. The generated free 
amino acids are expected to be taken up by cellular carrier systems and either subjected to normal 
intermediary metabolism or used as substrates for constitutive biosynthetic processes. Due to the wide 
distribution of these peptidases it is not expected that hepatic or renal impairment would affect the 
systemic clearance of ziconotide. The biological activity of the various expected proteolytic 
degradation products has not been assessed. It is unlikely that the degradation products of ziconotide 
will have significant biological activity, as peptides consisting of the individual peptide loop structures 
have been found to have binding affinities for N-type voltage sensitive calcium channels that are 
several orders of magnitude lower than that of the parent (ziconotide) compound. 
Elimination 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mean ziconotide CL (0.38 mL/min) approximates adult human CSF turnover rate (0.3 - 0.4 mL/min). 
Hence, ziconotide appears to be mainly eliminated from the CSF (mean t½ = 4.6 h) by bulk flow of 
CSF out of the CNS through the arachnoid villi with subsequent transfer into the systemic circulation. 
Very low circulating plasma concentrations of ziconotide may be observed following IT 
administration due to both the low IT infusion rate and relatively rapid plasma clearance. The mean 
plasma elimination half-life (t½) is 1.3 h. Ziconotide is a relatively small molecular weight peptide 
(MW = 2,639) and is filtered by the kidney glomerulus, but only minimal amounts of ziconotide 
(< 1%) are recovered in human urine following intravenous infusion. This is because almost all of the 
filtered active substance is rapidly endocytosed and ultimately transported back to the systemic 
circulation. 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
No formal studies assessing the impact of renal or hepatic dysfunction have been conducted; however, 
given that peptidases are present in various body organs, it is not anticipated that renal or hepatic 
dysfunction will significantly impact systemic exposure of ziconotide. 
Other special populations 
Although only limited data are available, there is no obvious effect of race, height, weight, gender or 
age on CSF ziconotide exposure after IT administration. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Effects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the 
maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use. 
In subchronic continuous intrathecal infusion studies in rats and dogs, behavioural effects were seen at 
doses ≥ 8-fold the maximum recommended clinical intrathecal infusion dose of 21.6 μg/day (on a 
mg/kg basis). These effects were defined by exaggerated pharmacological actions of ziconotide and 
not by neurotoxic lesions or target organ toxicity. Observations included transient and reversible 
neurological effects consisting of tremors, uncoordinated movements and hyper- and hypoactivity. 
The long-term consequences to neuronal function of continuous N-type calcium-channel block have 
not been demonstrated in experimental animals. Changes in neurological signalling have not been 
studied in experimental animals. Ziconotide did not induce bacterial gene mutation and was not 
genotoxic. Chronic animal studies have not been performed to assess the carcinogenic potential of 
ziconotide. However, ziconotide did not induce cell transformation in the in vitro Syrian hamster 
embryo (SHE) assay and did not increase cell proliferation (pre-neoplastic lesion formation) or 
apoptosis after subchronic intrathecal exposure in dogs. 
In rat fertility studies, there were no effects in males while reductions in corpora lutea; implantation 
sites and number of live embryos were observed in females. No adverse effects on female reproduction 
and post-natal development in rats were seen at systemic exposures up to 2,300 times human 
exposures at the maximum recommended intrathecal dose. 
Ziconotide was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits at exposures < 100 times human plasma levels. 
These results do not indicate a significant risk to humans due to the relatively high systemic exposures 
needed to elicit these effects in rats and rabbits.

section 6.6. 
6.3  Shelf life 
4 years 
In-use shelf-life (diluted product) 
Chemical and physical in use stability has been demonstrated for 60 days at 37°C. 
From a microbiological point of view, if the product is diluted it should be transferred to the infusion 
pump immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the 
responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C – 8°C, unless dilution 
has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. 
6.4  Special precautions for storage 
Store in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). Do not freeze. Keep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect 
from light. 
For storage conditions after dilution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. 
6.5  Nature and contents of container 
Type I glass vials with butyl rubber stoppers coated with fluorinated polymer. 
Each vial contains 20 mL solution for infusion. 
One vial per carton. 
6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
If dilution is required, Prialt must be diluted aseptically with preservative-free sodium chloride 
9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection before use. The concentration of the solution used in the 
infusion pump must be no lower than 5 μg/mL ziconotide in an external pump and 25 μg/mL in an 
internal pump. 
Strict aseptic procedures must be used during the preparation and handling of the solution for infusion 
and refilling of the pump. The patient and health-care providers must be familiar with the handling of 
the external or internal infusion system and be aware of the need to guard against infection. 
Specific instructions for using the pumps must be obtained from the manufacturer.

Prialt has been shown to be chemically and physically compatible with the implantable Synchromed 
pump and the external CADD-Micro pump at the concentration levels indicated above. Chemical and 
physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 14 days at 37ºC in the Synchromed pump when the 
pump has not previously been exposed to the medicinal product. The initial fill must therefore be 
replaced after 14 days. 
Prialt was stable for 60 days at 37°C in the Synchromed pump previously exposed to the medicinal 
product. Stability has been demonstrated for 21 days at room temperature in the CADD-Micro pump. 
The technical data are given only for information and should not limit health-care providers’ choice. 
CE marked pumps equivalent to the Synchromed and CADD-Micro pump should be used to deliver 
Prialt. 
Pumps previously used to deliver other medicinal products must be washed out three times with 
sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection (preservative-free) before being filled with 
Prialt. The introduction of air into the pump reservoir or cartridge should be minimised, as oxygen can 
degrade ziconotide. 
Prior to initiation of therapy, an internal pump must be rinsed three times with 2 mL of Prialt at 
25 μg/mL. The concentration of Prialt in a naïve pump may be reduced due to adsorption onto the 
surfaces of the device, and/or dilution by the residual space of the device. Because of this, after the 
first use of Prialt, the reservoir should be emptied and refilled after 14 days. Subsequently the pump 
should be emptied and refilled every 60 days. 
Prialt should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discolouration prior to administration. 
The solution should not be used if discoloured or cloudy or if particulate matter is observed. 
For single use only. Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in 
accordance with local requirements.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Prialt is indicated for the treatment of severe, chronic pain in adults who require intrathecal (IT) 
analgesia. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with ziconotide should only be undertaken by physicians experienced in intrathecal (IT) 
administration of medicinal products. 
Patients should undergo a neuropsychiatric evaluation before, after starting and during intrathecal 
ziconotide and immediately when any depressive signs or symptoms appear. (See Section 4.3, 4.4, 4.8 
and 5.1). 
Posology 
Dose initiation 
Dosing of ziconotide should be initiated at no more than 2.4 μg/day and titrated on an individual 
patient basis according to analgesic response and adverse reactions. 
Dose titration 
For each dose titration, assess the dosing requirements and adjust the pump infusion flow rate as 
required to achieve the new dosing. 
Patients may be titrated in dose increments of ≤ 2.4 μg/day, up to a maximum dose of 21.6 μg/day. 
The minimal interval between dose increases is 24 hours; the recommended interval, for safety 
reasons, is 48 hours or more.  
The maximum daily dose is 21.6 µg/day (0.9 µg/h). 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The median dose at response is approximately 6.0 μg/day and approximately 75% of responsive 
patients required ≤ 9.6 μg/day in placebo-controlled clinical trials. However, to limit the occurrence of 
serious adverse reactions, reports from clinical practice indicate that responsive patients may require a 
smaller daily dose of approximately 3.0 - 4.5 µg/day or lower. 
Adjust the dose of intrathecal ziconotide according to the severity of pain, the patient’s response to 
therapy, and the occurrence of adverse reactions.  
General management of side effects 
If necessary the dose can be decreased by any amount (including stopping the infusion) for the 
management of adverse reactions. 
Stopping rule 
Treatment should be discontinued in case of lack or insufficient efficacy, defined as pain reduction by 
less than 20% at the maximal tolerated dose. The benefit/risk should always be evaluated by the 
physician on an individual basis. 
Renal impairment 
Studies have not been conducted in patients with impaired renal function. Caution should be exercised 
when ziconotide is administered to patients with impaired renal function. 
Hepatic impairment 
Studies have not been conducted in patients with impaired hepatic function. Caution should be 
exercised when ziconotide is administered to patients with impaired hepatic function. 
Older patients ≥ 65 years of age 
Dose adjustment is not required in older adults. However, it should be taken into account that renal 
and/or hepatic insufficiency is more common in patients ≥ 65 years of age. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of ziconotide in children aged 0 to 18 years have not been established. 
No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Intrathecal use. 
Ziconotide must be administered as a continuous infusion via an intrathecal catheter, using an external 
or internally implanted mechanical infusion pump capable of delivering an accurate infusion volume. 
As the risk of meningitis secondary to prolonged catheterisation of the intrathecal space is greater with 
an external catheter infusion system, internal systems are recommended to administer ziconotide for 
prolonged periods (see section 4.4). An external catheter system should only be used when an internal 
system cannot be implanted. 
When low doses of ziconotide are required, for example when initiating titration, ziconotide must be 
diluted before use with preservative-free sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. 
For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Combination with IT chemotherapy (see section 4.5). 
Pre-existing history of psychosis with ziconotide.  
History of suicidal attempt or suicidal ideation with ziconotide (see Section 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8). 
Infection at the microinfusion injection site, uncontrolled bleeding diathesis, and spinal canal 
obstruction that impairs circulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Patients should undergo a neuropsychiatric evaluation before, after starting and during intrathecal 
ziconotide, and immediately when any depressive signs or symptoms appear (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 
4.8). 
Caregivers should contact a physician immediately if the patient experiences symptoms of potentially 
life-threatening adverse event. 
Long-term use 
Although ziconotide has been studied in long-term, open label efficacy and safety clinical trials, 
controlled studies of longer than 3 weeks duration have not been conducted (see section 5.1). Possible 
long-term local toxic effects on the spinal cord have not been excluded and preclinical data in this 
respect are limited (see section 5.3). Therefore, caution is needed during long-term treatment. 
Risk of infection 
The administration of medicinal products by the intrathecal (IT) route carries the risk of potentially 
serious infections, such as meningitis, which may be life threatening. Meningitis due to the entrance of 
organisms along the catheter track or inadvertent contamination of the infusion system is a known 
complication of intrathecal medicinal product administration, especially with external systems. 
Patients and physicians must be vigilant for typical symptoms and signs of meningitis. 
The optimal intrathecal placement of the catheter tip has not been established. Lower catheter tip 
placement, e.g. at the lumbar level, may reduce the incidence of ziconotide-related neurological 
adverse reactions. Therefore, catheter tip placement should be carefully considered to allow adequate 
access to spinal nociceptive segments whilst minimising medicinal product concentrations at cerebral 
levels. 
Only a small number of patients have received systemic chemotherapy and IT ziconotide. Caution 
should be exercised when ziconotide is administered to patients who are receiving systemic 
chemotherapy (see section 4.5). 
Elevations in creatine kinase 
Elevations in creatine kinase, which are usually asymptomatic, are common amongst patients on 
intrathecal ziconotide. Progressive elevation of the creatine kinase is uncommon. However monitoring 
of creatine kinase is recommended. In the event of progressive elevation, or clinically significant 
elevation in association with clinical features of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis, discontinuation of 
ziconotide should be considered. 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have not been observed during clinical trials and the 
immunogenicity of ziconotide administered by the IT route appears to be low. However, the potential 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for severe allergic reactions cannot be excluded and spontaneous reports of anaphylactic reactions 
have been received. 
Cognitive and neuropsychiatric adverse reactions 
Cognitive and neuropsychiatric adverse reactions, particularly confusion, are common in patients 
treated with ziconotide. Cognitive impairment typically appears after several weeks of treatment. 
Episodes of acute psychiatric disturbances, such as hallucinations, paranoid reactions, hostility, 
aggressiveness, delirium, psychosis and manic reactions have been reported in patients treated with 
ziconotide. The ziconotide dose should be reduced or discontinued if signs or symptoms of cognitive 
impairment or neuropsychiatric adverse reactions develop, but other contributing causes should also be 
considered. The cognitive effects of ziconotide are typically reversible within 1 - 4 weeks after 
discontinuation of the medicinal product, but may persist in some cases. It is recommended that 
patients undergo a neuropsychiatric evaluation before and after starting intrathecal ziconotide. 
In patients with severe chronic pain there is a higher incidence of suicide and suicide attempts than in 
the general population. Ziconotide may cause or worsen depression with the risk of suicide in 
susceptible patients. Patients with a history of suicide-related events prior to commencement of 
treatment are known to be at greater risk of suicidal thoughts or suicidal behaviour, and should receive 
careful monitoring during treatment. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek 
medical advice should signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge. Patients with a pre-existing 
history of suicidal attempt with ziconotide should not be given ziconotide again. Ziconotide is 
contraindicated in patients with a history of suicidal attempt or ideation with ziconotide (section 4.3). 
Depression of Central Nervous System (CNS) 
Patients have experienced depressed levels of consciousness while receiving ziconotide. The patient 
usually remains conscious and breathing is not depressed. The event may be self-limited, but 
ziconotide should be discontinued until the event resolves. The re-introduction of ziconotide is not 
recommended in these patients. Withdrawal of concomitant CNS depressant medicinal products 
should also be considered as they may contribute to the reduced level of arousal. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Specific clinical medicinal product interaction studies have not been conducted with ziconotide. 
However, low plasma ziconotide concentrations, metabolism by ubiquitous peptidases and relatively 
low plasma protein binding (see section 5.2) make metabolic-based interactions or plasma protein 
displacement type interactions between ziconotide and other medicinal products unlikely. 
No clinical data are available on the interaction between IT chemotherapy and IT ziconotide. 
Ziconotide is contraindicated in combination with IT chemotherapy (see section 4.3). 
Only a small number of patients have received systemic chemotherapy and IT ziconotide. Caution 
should be exercised when ziconotide is administered to patients who are receiving systemic 
chemotherapy (see section 4.4). 
Medicinal products that affect specific peptidases/proteases would not be expected to impact upon 
ziconotide plasma exposure. Based on very limited clinical investigations, both angiotensin converting 
enzyme inhibitors (e.g., benazepril, lisinopril and moexipril) and HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., 
ritonavir, saquinavir, indinavir), have no readily apparent effect on plasma ziconotide exposure. 
Ziconotide does not interact with opiate receptors. If discontinuing opiates when initiating ziconotide 
therapy, opiate withdrawal should be gradual. For patients being withdrawn from IT opiates, the IT 
opiate infusion dose should be gradually tapered over a few weeks and replaced with a 
pharmacologically equivalent dose of oral opiates. Adding IT ziconotide to stable doses of IT 
morphine (see section 5.1), is possible but requires special attention, as a high rate of neuropsychiatric 
adverse reactions (confusion/thinking abnormal, paranoid reactions and hallucinations, and abnormal 
gait), some of them serious, was observed in Study 202 despite a low dose of ziconotide. Vomiting and 
anorexia, and peripheral oedema were also observed when IT ziconotide was added to IT morphine. 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The addition of IT morphine to stable doses of IT ziconotide is better tolerated (pruritus has been 
reported) (see section 5.1). 
An increased incidence of somnolence has been observed when ziconotide is administered 
concomitantly with systemic baclofen, clonidine, bupivacaine or propofol thus for the time being their 
simultaneous use is discouraged. 
No data are available regarding the concomitant use of partial opioid agonists (e.g. buprenorphine) 
with ziconotide. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of ziconotide in pregnant women. 
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Ziconotide is  not recommended  during  pregnancy  and  in  women  of  childbearing  potential  not  using 
contraception.  
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether ziconotide/metabolites are excreted in human milk. 
A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded.  
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Prialt 
therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the 
woman. 
Fertility 
No specific studies with ziconotide in humans have been conducted to evaluate effects on fertility. In a 
study on male and female fertility in rats no effects in males while reductions in corpora lutea; 
implantation sites and number of live embryos were observed in females (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Prialt has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Ziconotide may cause confusion, somnolence and other neurological adverse reactions, therefore 
patients must be advised not to drive or operate machines if affected. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety of ziconotide administered as a continuous intrathecal infusion has been evaluated in more 
than 1,400 patients participating in acute and chronic pain clinical trials. The duration of treatment has 
ranged from one-hour bolus infusion to continuous use for more than 6 years. The median exposure 
time was 43 days. The infusion dose rate ranged from 0.03 - 912 μg/day, with a median final dose rate 
of 7.2 μg/day. 
In clinical trials, 88% of patients experienced adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions 
reported in long-term clinical trials were dizziness (42%), nausea (30%), nystagmus (23%), 
confusional state (25%), gait abnormal (16%), memory impairment (13%), vision blurred (14%),

headache (12%), asthenia (13%), vomiting (11%), and somnolence (10%). Most adverse reactions 
were mild to moderate in severity and resolved over time.

a. From spontaneous reporting 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Meningitis 
Administration of medicinal products by the intrathecal route carries the risk of potential serious 
infections, such as meningitis, which may be life threatening. Patients and physicians must be vigilant 
for typical symptoms and signs of meningitis (see section 4.4). 
Elevations of creatine phosphokinase 
Elevations in creatine phosphokinase were usually asymptomatic. Monitoring of creatine phosphokinase 
is  recommended.  Discontinuation  of  ziconotide  should  be  considered  in  the  event  of  progressive  or 
significant  elevation  of  creatine  phosphokinase  in  association  with  clinical  features  of  myopathy  or 
rhabdomyolysis (see section 4.4). 
CNS adverse reactions 
Cognitive and neuropsychiatric adverse reactions are common in patients treated with ziconotide. 
Cognitive impairment typically appears after several weeks of treatment. Episodes of acute psychiatric 
disturbances, such as hallucinations, paranoid reactions, hostility, aggressiveness, delirium, psychosis 
and manic reactions have been reported in patients treated with ziconotide. The ziconotide dose should 
be reduced or discontinued if signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment or neuropsychiatric adverse 
reactions develop, but other contributing causes should also be considered. The cognitive effects of 
ziconotide are typically reversible within 1 - 4 weeks after discontinuation of the medicinal product, 
but may persist in some cases.  
The available data do not exclude the possibility of an increased risk of suicide when using ziconotide. 
Prialt is contra-indicated in patients with a history of suicidal attempt or suicidal ideation with 
ziconotide (Section 4.3). It is recommended that patients undergo a neuropsychiatric evaluation before and 
after starting intrathecal ziconotide (see section 4.2 and 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In intravenous infusion studies, healthy male volunteers received ziconotide at doses of up to 
70,000 μg/day or 3,200 times the maximum recommended daily intrathecal infusion dose. Postural 
hypotension was observed in almost all subjects who received high intravenous doses of ziconotide. 
The maximum recommended intrathecal dose is 21.6 μg/day. The maximum intended intrathecal dose 
of ziconotide in clinical trials was 912 μg/day following upward titration over 7 days. 
Symptoms 
In one clinical study a male cancer patient received an accidental IT ziconotide overdose of 744 μg 
over a 24-hour period (31 μg/hour) and resumed treatment at the intended dose after experiencing a 
reduction in Visual Analog Scale of Pain Intensity (VASPI) from 82 to 2.5 mm. In some patients who 
received intrathecal doses greater than the maximum recommended dose, exaggerated 
pharmacological effects, e.g., ataxia, nystagmus, dizziness, stupor, depressed level of consciousness, 
muscle spasms, confusional state, sedation, hypotension, aphasia, speech disorder, nausea and 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
vomiting were observed. There was no indication of respiratory depression. Most patients under 
observation recovered within 24 hours of withdrawal of the medicinal product. 
Management 
General medical supportive measures should be administered to patients who receive an overdose until 
the exaggerated pharmacological effects of the medicinal product have resolved. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Analgesics, other analgesics and antipyretics, ATC code: N02BG08 
Mechanism of action 
Ziconotide is a synthetic analogue of a ω-conopeptide, MVIIA, found in the venom of the Conus 
magus marine snail. It is an N-type calcium channel blocker (NCCB). NCCs regulate neurotransmitter 
release in specific neuronal populations responsible for the spinal processing of pain. In binding to 
these neuronal NCCs ziconotide inhibits the voltage sensitive calcium current into primary nociceptive 
afferents terminating in the superficial layers of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. In turn, this inhibits 
their release of neurotransmitters (including Substance P) and therefore, the spinal signalling of pain. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Though statistically significant relationships and reasonable correlation between cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) exposure (AUC, Cmax) and clinical response measures have been observed following 1 hour IT 
administration, no well-defined dose-concentration-response relationships have yet been identified. 
Many responsive patients obtain near-maximal analgesia within a few hours of delivery of an 
appropriate dose. However, maximal effects may be delayed in some patients. Given the occurrence of 
analgesia and adverse reactions at similar doses, the recommended minimum interval between dose 
increases is 24 hours; the recommended interval, for safety reasons, is 48 hours or more. If necessary 
the dose can be decreased by any amount (including stopping the infusion) for the management of 
adverse reactions. 
Nervous system adverse reactions, particularly dizziness, nausea and abnormal gait appear to be 
correlated with CSF exposure, though a definitive relationship has not been established. 
Low plasma exposure occurs during IT infusion due to the low recommended IT infusion rates and 
relatively rapid plasma clearance (see section 5.2). Therefore, pharmacological effects related to 
systemic exposure should be minimal. 
The median dose at response is approximately 6.0 μg/day and approximately 75% of responsive 
patients required ≤ 9.6 μg/day in placebo-controlled clinical trials. However, to limit the occurrence of 
serious adverse reactions, reports from clinical practice indicate that responsive patients may require a 
smaller daily dose of approximately 3.0 - 4.5 µg/ay or lower. 
To limit the occurrence of serious adverse reactions, a low starting dose and slow titration interval is 
recommended, always considering the narrow therapeutic window. A maximum dose of 21.6 μg/day is 
recommended. 
However, in clinical trials it has been observed that patients who tolerate doses of 21.6 μg/day 
following slow titration over a 3 to 4-week period, generally tolerate higher doses up to 48.0 μg/day. 
There is no evidence of the development of pharmacological tolerance to ziconotide in patients. 
However, in view of limited data, the development of tolerance cannot be excluded. Examination of 
the patency of the intrathecal catheter should be considered if the required ziconotide dose continually 
increases and there is no benefit or increase in adverse reactions. 
Alternative dosing regimens including initiation of dosing with lower doses of ziconotide and bolus 
administration have been explored in a limited number of studies available in the literature. 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bolus administration studies suggest that bolus dosing may be useful in identifying patients who may 
benefit from long term use of ziconotide, however, bolus administration may result in more adverse 
reactions than administration by continuous infusion. These studies suggest that alternative methods of 
administration of ziconotide may be possible however, due to the limited numbers of patients, the 
results are inconclusive and there is currently insufficient evidence to make definitive 
recommendations for such alternative dosing regimens. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
There were three placebo-controlled clinical trials of IT ziconotide. 
Two short-term studies, 95-001 (malignant pain) and 96-002 (non-malignant pain), involving 
366 patients, demonstrated the efficacy of IT ziconotide in severe chronic pain using the percent 
change in Visual Analog Scale of Pain Intensity (VASPI) as the primary efficacy measure. These 
studies were of short duration, 5 and 6 days respectively, and used a more rapid dose escalation and 
higher doses than recommended in Section 4.2.

SD – Standard Deviation. 
The aetiologies of pain in studies 95-001 (malignant pain) and 96-002 (non-malignant pain) were 
varied and included bone pain (n = 38) mostly due to bone metastases (n = 34), myelopathy (n = 38), 
half of whom had spinal cord injury with paralysis (n = 19), neuropathy (n = 79), radiculopathy 
(n = 24), spinal pain (n = 91) mostly due to failed back surgery (n = 82), and other aetiologies (n = 82). 
Some patients had more than one cause of pain. The efficacy of IT ziconotide was apparent in all 
groups. 
Study 301 (n = 220) was of longer duration (21 days), involved more cautious up-titration and lower 
doses of IT ziconotide, and enrolled the most refractory population of patients studied in the three 
studies. All patients in the 301 study had failed IT therapy with combinations of analgesics and their 
physicians considered that 97% of the patients were refractory to currently available treatments. The 
majority had spinal pain (n = 134), especially failed back surgery (n = 110); a lower proportion had 
neuropathy (n = 36). Only five had malignant pain. The primary endpoint was the percent change in 
VASPI score. The efficacy of IT ziconotide in study 301 was lower than in the previous two, 
short-term studies. The frequency and severity of adverse reactions were also lower, mainly as a result 
of lower starting dose at 2.4 µg/d (0.1 µg/h). Titration was allowed after a minimum of 24 hours and 
dose increments were limited to 1.2-2.4 µg/d.

Post-marketing experience 
Since market authorization approval, real-world data were published for long-time pain management 
with ziconotide monotherapy in <100 patients. In patients responding to initial trialing (about 50% of 
patients), safe and effective utilization of ziconotide with low starting dose, low titration dose and less 
frequent titration intervals resulted in pain relief with improved safety profile compared to high initial 
dose and rapid titration. 
Combination studies with IT Morphine 
Clinical studies 201 and 202 indicate that the combination of IT ziconotide and IT morphine may 
effectively reduce pain and decrease systemic opioid use over a sustained period of time for patients 
whose pain was inadequately controlled with their maximum tolerated dose of IT ziconotide (median 
8.7 μg/day, mean 25.7 μg/day – study 201) or with IT morphine (study 202) alone. When adding IT 
ziconotide to stable doses of IT morphine, as with the initiation of IT ziconotide monotherapy, the 
appearance of psychotic adverse reactions (e.g., hallucinations, paranoid reactions) or discontinuation 
due to increased adverse reactions may occur (see section 4.5). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The CSF pharmacokinetics of ziconotide have been studied following one-hour IT infusions of 
1 - 10 μg of ziconotide in patients with chronic pain. The plasma pharmacokinetics following 
intravenous doses (0.3 – 10 μg/kg/24 h) were also studied. IT and intravenous pharmacokinetics data 
are summarised below.

CL = clearance; Vd = distribution volume; t½ = half life 
Absorption 
Following one-hour IT administration (1 – 10 μg), both cumulative exposure (AUC; range: 83.6 –
608 ng/h/mL) and peak exposure (Cmax; range: 16.4 – 132 ng/mL) values were variable and 
dose-dependent, but appeared only approximately dose-proportional. Plasma concentrations following 
continuous (≥ 48 h) IT infusion (≤ 21.6 μg/day) appear to be relatively low and typically undetectable 
(i.e., about 80% of plasma samples collected from pain patients contain no quantifiable medicinal 
product; < 0.04 ng/mL). No accumulation of ziconotide in plasma following long-term IT 
administration (up to 9 months) has been observed. 
Distribution 
Median ziconotide CSF volume of distribution (Vd: 99 mL) is between the spinal cord CSF volume 
(approximately 75 mL) and total CSF volume (approximately 130 mL). Ziconotide appears to 
distribute mainly within the CSF until transferred to the systemic circulation. Upon reaching the 
systemic circulation, ziconotide appears to be more extensively distributed, based on a plasma 
distribution volume of approximately 30 L and is only about 53% bound (non-specifically) to human 
plasma proteins. 
Biotransformation 
Ziconotide is a peptide consisting of 25 naturally-occurring amino acids of the L-configuration, and 
does not appear to be appreciably metabolised in the CSF. Following passage into the systemic 
circulation, ziconotide is expected to be primarily susceptible to proteolytic cleavage by various 
ubiquitous peptidases/proteases present in most organs (e.g., kidney, liver, lung, muscle, etc.), and thus 
degraded to peptide fragments and its individual constituent free amino acids. The generated free 
amino acids are expected to be taken up by cellular carrier systems and either subjected to normal 
intermediary metabolism or used as substrates for constitutive biosynthetic processes. Due to the wide 
distribution of these peptidases it is not expected that hepatic or renal impairment would affect the 
systemic clearance of ziconotide. The biological activity of the various expected proteolytic 
degradation products has not been assessed. It is unlikely that the degradation products of ziconotide 
will have significant biological activity, as peptides consisting of the individual peptide loop structures 
have been found to have binding affinities for N-type voltage sensitive calcium channels that are 
several orders of magnitude lower than that of the parent (ziconotide) compound. 
Elimination 
Mean ziconotide CL (0.38 mL/min) approximates adult human CSF turnover rate (0.3 - 0.4 mL/min). 
Hence, ziconotide appears to be mainly eliminated from the CSF (mean t½ = 4.6 h) by bulk flow of 
CSF out of the CNS through the arachnoid villi with subsequent transfer into the systemic circulation. 
Very low circulating plasma concentrations of ziconotide may be observed following IT 
administration due to both the low IT infusion rate and relatively rapid plasma clearance. The mean 
plasma elimination half-life (t½) is 1.3 h. Ziconotide is a relatively small molecular weight peptide 
(MW = 2,639) and is filtered by the kidney glomerulus, but only minimal amounts of ziconotide 
(< 1%) are recovered in human urine following intravenous infusion. This is because almost all of the 
filtered active substance is rapidly endocytosed and ultimately transported back to the systemic 
circulation. 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No formal studies assessing the impact of renal or hepatic dysfunction have been conducted; however, 
given that peptidases are present in various body organs, it is not anticipated that renal or hepatic 
dysfunction will significantly impact systemic exposure of ziconotide. 
Other special populations 
Although only limited data are available, there is no obvious effect of race, height, weight, gender or 
age on CSF ziconotide exposure after IT administration. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Effects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the 
maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use. 
In subchronic continuous intrathecal infusion studies in rats and dogs, behavioural effects were seen at 
doses ≥ 8-fold the maximum recommended clinical intrathecal infusion dose of 21.6 μg/day (on a 
mg/kg basis). These effects were defined by exaggerated pharmacological actions of ziconotide and 
not by neurotoxic lesions or target organ toxicity. Observations included transient and reversible 
neurological effects consisting of tremors, uncoordinated movements and hyper- and hypoactivity. 
The long-term consequences to neuronal function of continuous N-type calcium-channel block have 
not been demonstrated in experimental animals. Changes in neurological signalling have not been 
studied in experimental animals. Ziconotide did not induce bacterial gene mutation and was not 
genotoxic. Chronic animal studies have not been performed to assess the carcinogenic potential of 
ziconotide. However, ziconotide did not induce cell transformation in the in vitro Syrian hamster 
embryo (SHE) assay and did not increase cell proliferation (pre-neoplastic lesion formation) or 
apoptosis after subchronic intrathecal exposure in dogs. 
In rat fertility studies, there were no effects in males while reductions in corpora lutea; implantation 
sites and number of live embryos were observed in females. No adverse effects on female reproduction 
and post-natal development in rats were seen at systemic exposures up to 2,300 times human 
exposures at the maximum recommended intrathecal dose. 
Ziconotide was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits at exposures < 100 times human plasma levels. 
These results do not indicate a significant risk to humans due to the relatively high systemic exposures 
needed to elicit these effects in rats and rabbits.

6.3  Shelf life 
4 years 
In-use shelf life (diluted product) 
Chemical and physical in use stability has been demonstrated for 60 days at 37°C. 
From a microbiological point of view, if the product is diluted it should be transferred to the infusion 
pump immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the 
responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C – 8°C, unless dilution 
has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. 
6.4  Special precautions for storage 
Store in a refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). Do not freeze. Keep the vial in the outer carton in order to protect 
from light. 
For storage conditions after dilution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. 
6.5  Nature and contents of container 
Type I glass vials with butyl rubber stoppers coated with fluorinated polymer. 
Each vial contains 1, 2 or 5 mL solution for infusion. 
One vial per carton. 
Not all pack sizes may be marketed. 
6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
If dilution is required, Prialt must be diluted aseptically with preservative-free sodium chloride 
9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection before use. The concentration of the solution used in the 
infusion pump must be no lower than 5 μg/mL ziconotide in an external pump and 25 μg/mL in an 
internal pump. 
Strict aseptic procedures must be used during the preparation and handling of the solution for infusion 
and refilling of the pump. The patient and health-care providers must be familiar with the handling of 
the external or internal infusion system and be aware of the need to guard against infection. 
Specific instructions for using the pumps must be obtained from the manufacturer. 
Prialt has been shown to be chemically and physically compatible with the implantable Synchromed 
pump and the external CADD-Micro pump at the concentration levels indicated above. Chemical and 
physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 14 days at 37ºC in the Synchromed pump when the 
pump has not previously been exposed to the medicinal product. The initial fill must therefore be 
replaced after 14 days. 
Prialt was stable for 60 days at 37°C in the Synchromed pump previously exposed to the medicinal 
product. Stability has been demonstrated for 21 days at room temperature in the CADD-Micro pump. 
The technical data are given only for information and should not limit health-care providers’ choice. 
CE marked pumps equivalent to the Synchromed and CADD-Micro pump should be used to deliver 
Prialt. 
Pumps previously used to deliver other medicinal products must be washed out three times with 
sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection (preservative-free) before being filled with 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Prialt. The introduction of air into the pump reservoir or cartridge should be minimised, as oxygen can 
degrade ziconotide. 
Prior to initiation of therapy, an internal pump must be rinsed three times with 2 mL of Prialt at 
25 μg/mL. The concentration of Prialt in a naïve pump may be reduced due to adsorption onto the 
surfaces of the device, and/or dilution by the residual space of the device. Because of this, after the 
first use of Prialt, the reservoir should be emptied and refilled after 14 days. Subsequently the pump 
should be emptied and refilled every 60 days. 
Prialt should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discolouration prior to administration. 
The solution should not be used if discoloured or cloudy or if particulate matter is observed. 
For single use only. Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in 
accordance with local requirements.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Prialt is and what it is used for 
Prialt contains the active substance ziconotide which belongs to a group of medicines, called 
analgesics or ‘painkillers’. Prialt is used for the treatment of severe, long-term pain in adults who need 
a painkiller by intrathecal injection (injection into the space that surrounds the spinal cord and the 
brain). 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Prialt 
You should not be given Prialt 
- 
if you are allergic to ziconotide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you are receiving an anticancer medicine into the space around your spinal cord. 
if you have a history of suicidal attempt or suicidal ideation with ziconotide 
Warnings and precautions 
Patients should undergo a neuropsychiatric evaluation before, after starting and during intrathecal 
ziconotide, and immediately when any depressive signs or symptoms appear. 
Caregivers should contact a physician immediately if the patient experiences symptoms of potentially 
life-threatening adverse event. 
Talk to your doctor before you are given Prialt 
- 
The effects of long-term treatment of Prialt are uncertain at this time and the possibility of toxic 
effects on the spinal cord have not yet been ruled out. In case of a need for long term treatment, 
monitoring may be necessary (as decided by your doctor). 
If you are receiving Prialt via a pump worn outside your body, it is important you check once 
daily for any signs of infection at the point where the tube enters your body. 
If you observe any signs of infection around the tube, such as skin redness, swelling, pain or 
discharge, you must tell your doctor immediately and seek treatment for the infection. 
If you develop any tenderness in the area around the tube without signs of infection, you should 
seek advice from your doctor as soon as possible as tenderness may be an early sign of 
infection. 
If you are receiving Prialt via a pump worn outside your body and any part of the infusion 
tubing becomes disconnected, you must contact your doctor or nurse immediately.

If you have any of the following symptoms: high temperature, headache, stiff neck, tiredness, 
confusion, feeling sick, vomiting or occasional fits, these may be signs of meningitis. You must 
tell your doctor immediately if you experience any of the above symptoms. 
If you notice any adverse change in your thinking, mood or memory, please tell your doctor. 
If you are receiving chemotherapy please tell your doctor. 
You may have an increased level of an enzyme called creatine kinase in your blood and 
although this does not usually cause any symptoms or problems, your doctor is likely to monitor 
its level. In addition, you may also occasionally experience muscular problems. If such is the 
case, you should immediately notify your doctor, as he/she may decide to halt your Prialt 
treatment. 
You should tell your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms after 
receiving your treatment; sudden wheeziness, difficulty in breathing, pain in the chest, swelling 
of eyelids, face or lips, rash or itching (especially affecting the whole body). These may be signs 
of a severe allergic reaction. 
In patients that suffer from severe long term pain, there is a higher likelihood of suicide and 
attempted suicide than in the general population. Prialt may also cause or worsen depression in 
people that are already susceptible. If you are experiencing depression or have a history of 
depression please inform your healthcare professional before you are commenced on Prialt. If 
after starting Prialt you experience a worsening of your depression or have any other symptoms 
affecting your mood, please inform your healthcare professional. 
You may experience drowsiness or may not be fully aware of your surroundings whilst 
receiving treatment. If this happens, you should immediately notify your doctor, as he/she may 
decide to halt your Prialt treatment. 
Children and adolescents 
Prialt is not recommended for use in children and adolescents. 
Other medicines and Prialt 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines (for example, 
baclofen used to treat muscle spasticity, clonidine used to treat high blood pressure, bupivacaine used 
for local anaesthesia, morphine used for pain, propofol used for general anaesthesia or any medicine 
which is administered by intrathecal injection (injection into the space that surrounds the spinal cord 
and the brain)). You may feel drowsy if you are given Prialt with certain other medicines used to treat 
pain. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 
Prialt  is  not  recommended  during  pregnancy  and  in  women  of  childbearing  potential  not  using 
contraception.  
Driving and using machines 
The use of Prialt has been reported to cause confusion and drowsiness. Ask your doctor for advice 
before you drive or operate machinery. 
Prialt contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per maximum recommended intrathecal dose 
(21.6 micrograms per day), that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
3.  How to use Prialt 
Your treatment with Prialt will be managed by a doctor who has experience of giving medicines into 
the space around the spinal cord, and in the use of internal and external infusion pumps. 
48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The recommended starting dose is at no more than 2.4 micrograms per day. Your doctor may adjust 
the dose of Prialt very slowly according to the severity of your pain by adding no more than 
2.4 micrograms/day. The maximum dose is 21.6 micrograms/day. At the start of your treatment your 
doctor may increase your dose every 1 to 2 days or more. If needed, the dose may be decreased or 
injection stopped if the side effects are too great. 
Prialt is given as a very slow continuous injection into the space surrounding the spinal cord 
(intrathecal use). The medicine will be administered continuously from a pump either implanted into 
your abdominal wall or placed externally in a belt pouch. Your doctor will discuss with you the kind of 
pump that will be most suitable for you and when you need to have your pump refilled. 
Pain relief may be achieved through a stepwise process by adjusting the dose of Prialt very slowly. If 
you feel that you are still in too much pain while receiving Prialt, or that the side effects are too great, 
talk to your doctor. 
Before giving you Prialt, your doctor might decide to slowly stop giving you opiates (other types of 
medicinal product which are used to treat pain) into your spinal cord and instead replace with 
alternative pain medicinal products. 
If you receive more Prialt than you should 
If you receive more Prialt than your doctor intended, you may feel unwell with signs such as 
confusion, problems with speech, word finding difficulties, excessive shaking, light-headedness, 
excessive sleepiness, feeling or being sick. If this happens, consult your doctor or hospital 
immediately. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.

Other sources of information 
Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: 
http://www.ema.europa.eu. There are also links to other websites about rare diseases and treatments. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Instructions for use and handling 
Prialt is supplied as a clear, colourless solution in single use vials. It should be inspected visually for 
particulate matter and discolouration prior to administration. The solution should not be used if 
discoloured or cloudy or if particulate matter is observed. 
For single use only. Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in 
accordance with local requirements.  
If dilution is required, Prialt must be diluted aseptically with preservative-free sodium chloride 
9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection before use. The concentration of the solution used in the 
infusion pump must be no lower than 5 μg/mL ziconotide in an external pump and 25 μg/mL in an 
internal pump. 
Strict aseptic procedures must be used during the preparation and handling of the solution for infusion 
and refilling of the pump. The patient and health-care providers must be familiar with the handling of 
the external or internal infusion system and be aware of the need to guard against infection. 
Specific instructions for using the pumps must be obtained from the manufacturer. 
Prialt has been shown to be chemically and physically compatible with the implantable Synchromed 
pump and the external CADD-Micro pump at the concentration levels indicated above. Chemical and 
physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 14 days at 37ºC in the Synchromed pump when the 
pump has not previously been exposed to the medicinal product. The initial fill must therefore be 
replaced after 14 days. 
Prialt was stable for 60 days at 37°C in the Synchromed pump previously exposed to the medicinal 
product. Stability has been demonstrated for 21 days at room temperature in the CADD-Micro pump. 
The technical data are given only for information and should not limit health-care providers’ choice. 
CE marked pumps equivalent to the Synchromed and CADD-Micro pump should be used to deliver 
ziconotide.  
53 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pumps previously used to deliver other medicinal products must be washed out three times with 
sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection (preservative-free) before being filled with 
ziconotide. The introduction of air into the pump reservoir or cartridge should be minimised, as 
oxygen can degrade ziconotide. 
Prior to initiation of therapy, an internal pump must be rinsed three times with 2 mL of the solution at 
25 μg/mL. The concentration of Prialt in a naïve pump may be reduced due to adsorption onto the 
surfaces of the device, and/or dilution by the residual space of the device. Because of this, after the 
first use of Prialt, the reservoir should be emptied and refilled after 14 days. Subsequently the pump 
should be emptied and refilled every 60 days.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Prialt is and what it is used for 
Prialt contains the active substance ziconotide which belongs to a group of medicines, called 
analgesics or ‘painkillers’. Prialt is used for the treatment of severe, long-term pain in adults who need 
a painkiller by intrathecal injection (injection into the space that surrounds the spinal cord and the 
brain). 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Prialt 
You should not be given Prialt 
- 
if you are allergic to ziconotide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you are receiving an anticancer medicine into the space around your spinal cord. 
if you have a history of suicidal attempt or suicidal ideation with ziconotide 
Warnings and precautions 
Patients should undergo a neuropsychiatric evaluation before, after starting and during intrathecal 
ziconotide, and immediately when any depressive signs or symptoms appear. 
Caregivers should contact a physician immediately if the patient experiences symptoms of potentially 
life-threatening adverse event. 
Talk to your doctor before you are given Prialt 
- 
The effects of long-term treatment of Prialt are uncertain at this time and the possibility of toxic 
effects on the spinal cord have not yet been ruled out. In case of a need for long term treatment, 
monitoring may be necessary (as decided by your doctor). 
If you are receiving Prialt via a pump worn outside your body, it is important you check once 
daily for any signs of infection at the point where the tube enters your body. 
If you observe any signs of infection around the tube, such as skin redness, swelling, pain or 
discharge, you must tell your doctor immediately and seek treatment for the infection. 
If you develop any tenderness in the area around the tube without signs of infection, you should 
seek advice from your doctor as soon as possible as tenderness may be an early sign of 
infection. 
If you are receiving Prialt via a pump worn outside your body and any part of the infusion 
tubing becomes disconnected, you must contact your doctor or nurse immediately.

If you have any of the following symptoms: high temperature, headache, stiff neck, tiredness, 
confusion, feeling sick, vomiting or occasional fits, these may be signs of meningitis. You must 
tell your doctor immediately if you experience any of the above symptoms. 
If you notice any adverse change in your thinking, mood or memory, please tell your doctor. 
If you are receiving chemotherapy please tell your doctor. 
You may have an increased level of an enzyme called creatine kinase in your blood and 
although this does not usually cause any symptoms or problems, your doctor is likely to monitor 
its level. In addition, you may also occasionally experience muscular problems. If such is the 
case, you should immediately notify your doctor, as he/she may decide to halt your Prialt 
treatment. 
You should tell your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms after 
receiving your treatment; sudden wheeziness, difficulty in breathing, pain in the chest, swelling 
of eyelids, face or lips, rash or itching (especially affecting the whole body). These may be signs 
of a severe allergic reaction. 
In patients that suffer from severe long term pain, there is a higher likelihood of suicide and 
attempted suicide than in the general population. Prialt may also cause or worsen depression in 
people that are already susceptible. If you are experiencing depression or have a history of 
depression please inform your healthcare professional before you are commenced on Prialt. If 
after starting Prialt you experience a worsening of your depression or have any other symptoms 
affecting your mood, please inform your healthcare professional. 
You may experience drowsiness or may not be fully aware of your surroundings whilst 
receiving treatment. If this happens, you should immediately notify your doctor, as he/she may 
decide to halt your Prialt treatment. 
Children and adolescents 
Prialt is not recommended for use in children and adolescents. 
Other medicines and Prialt 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines (for example, 
baclofen used to treat muscle spasticity, clonidine used to treat high blood pressure, bupivacaine used 
for local anaesthesia, morphine used for pain, propofol used for general anaesthesia or any medicine 
which is administered by intrathecal injection (injection into the space that surrounds the spinal cord 
and the brain)). You may feel drowsy if you are given Prialt with certain other medicines used to treat 
pain. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 
Prialt  is  not  recommended  during  pregnancy  and  in  women  of  childbearing  potential  not  using 
contraception.  
Driving and using machines 
The use of Prialt has been reported to cause confusion and drowsiness. Ask your doctor for advice 
before you drive or operate machinery. 
Prialt contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per maximum recommended intrathecal dose 
(21.6 micrograms per day), that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to use Prialt 
Your treatment with Prialt will be managed by a doctor who has experience of giving medicines into 
the space around the spinal cord, and in the use of internal and external infusion pumps. 
56 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The recommended starting dose is at no more than 2.4 micrograms per day. Your doctor may adjust 
the dose of Prialt very slowly according to the severity of your pain by adding no more than 
2.4 micrograms/day. The maximum dose is 21.6 micrograms/day. At the start of your treatment your 
doctor may increase your dose every 1 to 2 days or more. If needed, the dose may be decreased or 
injection stopped if the side effects are too great. 
Prialt is given as a very slow continuous injection into the space surrounding the spinal cord 
(intrathecal use). The medicine will be administered continuously from a pump either implanted into 
your abdominal wall or placed externally in a belt pouch. Your doctor will discuss with you the kind of 
pump that will be most suitable for you and when you need to have your pump refilled. 
Pain relief may be achieved through a stepwise process by adjusting the dose of Prialt very slowly. If 
you feel that you are still in too much pain while receiving Prialt, or that the side effects are too great, 
talk to your doctor. 
Before giving you Prialt, your doctor might decide to slowly stop giving you opiates (other types of 
medicinal product which are used to treat pain) into your spinal cord and instead replace with 
alternative pain medicinal products. 
If you receive more Prialt than you should 
If you receive more Prialt than your doctor intended, you may feel unwell with signs such as 
confusion, problems with speech, word finding difficulties, excessive shaking, light-headedness, 
excessive sleepiness, feeling or being sick. If this happens, consult your doctor or hospital 
immediately. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Instructions for use and handling 
Prialt is supplied as a clear, colourless solution in single use vials. It should be inspected visually for 
particulate matter and discolouration prior to administration. The solution should not be used if 
discoloured or cloudy or if particulate matter is observed. 
For single use only. Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in 
accordance with local requirements.  
If dilution is required, Prialt must be diluted aseptically with preservative-free sodium chloride 
9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection before use. The concentration of the solution used in the 
infusion pump must be no lower than 5 μg/mL ziconotide in an external pump and 25 μg/mL in an 
internal pump. 
Strict aseptic procedures must be used during the preparation and handling of the solution for infusion 
and refilling of the pump. The patient and health-care providers must be familiar with the handling of 
the external or internal infusion system and be aware of the need to guard against infection. 
Specific instructions for using the pumps must be obtained from the manufacturer. 
Prialt has been shown to be chemically and physically compatible with the implantable Synchromed 
pump and the external CADD-Micro pump at the concentration levels indicated above. Chemical and 
physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 14 days at 37ºC in the Synchromed pump when the 
pump has not previously been exposed to the medicinal product. The initial fill must therefore be 
replaced after 14 days.

Prialt was stable for 60 days at 37°C in the Synchromed pump previously exposed to the medicinal 
product. Stability has been demonstrated for 21 days at room temperature in the CADD-Micro pump. 
The technical data are given only for information and should not limit health-care providers’ choice. 
CE marked pumps equivalent to the Synchromed and CADD-Micro pump should be used to deliver 
ziconotide. 
Pumps previously used to deliver other medicinal products must be washed out three times with 
sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection (preservative-free) before being filled with 
ziconotide. The introduction of air into the pump reservoir or cartridge should be minimised, as 
oxygen can degrade ziconotide. 
Prior to initiation of therapy, an internal pump must be rinsed three times with 2 mL of the solution at 
25 μg/mL. The concentration of Prialt in a naïve pump may be reduced due to adsorption onto the 
surfaces of the device, and/or dilution by the residual space of the device. Because of this, after the 
first use of Prialt, the reservoir should be emptied and refilled after 14 days. Subsequently the pump 
should be emptied and refilled every 60 days.

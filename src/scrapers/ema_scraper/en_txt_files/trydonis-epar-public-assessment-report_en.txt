1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A. submitted on 24 November 2017 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Trydonis, through the centralised procedure under 
Article 3 (2)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon 
by the EMA/CHMP on 10 November 2016. The eligibility to the centralised procedure under Article 3(2)(b) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 was based on demonstration of  interest of patients at Community level. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Maintenance treatment in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) who are not adequately treated by a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting 
beta2-agonist (for effects on symptoms control and prevention of exacerbations see section 5.1). 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 10(c) of Directive 2001/83/EC – relating to informed consent from a marketing authorisation holder 
for an authorised medicinal product. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information with a letter from the MAH of Trimbow, 
Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A, allowing the cross reference to relevant quality, non-clinical and/or clinical data. 
This application is submitted as a multiple of Trimbow authorised on 17 July 2017 in accordance with Article 
82.1 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
CW/0001/2015 on the granting of a class waiver. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to 
the proposed indication. 
Scientific Advice 
The applicant received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on 21 February 2013 and 10 April 2013. The Scientific 
Advice pertained to non-clinical and clinical aspects of the development and on the Phase III studies’ design

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
COPD is strongly linked to tobacco smoking, particularly cigarette smoking and is a male predominant 
condition, in COPD clinical trials in developed countries generally about two thirds of included patients are 
male and for both males and females the average age tends to be in the early sixties. In poor countries the 
male predominance is not as marked as women may develop COPD as a result of cooking over open fires. 
The prevalence is quite variable on a local basis with higher prevalence linked to lower affluence and social 
status. Screening would be possible by mass measurement of lung function which is cheap, easy, and non-
invasive, but is not done in practice. There have been no substantial trials of the value of screening for COPD.  
Tobacco smoking cessation or non/never smoking is an effective measure and societal efforts have been 
made in that direction rather than into screening programmes.  
2.1.2.  Biologic features 
COPD is characterised by cough, excess sputum production, airways narrowing leading to air trapping and 
hyperinflation of the chest, and loss of lung tissue (emphysema). In its more advanced stages it causes strain 
and eventually failure, of the cardiac right ventricle. 
Assessment report  
EMA/155337/2018 
Page 6/13 
  
  
 
 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Clinical presentation tends to be as cough and breathlessness in a heavy cigarette smoker and is unusual 
before approximately the age of forty.  
Exacerbations in COPD are driven by episodes of acute inflammation, usually following a viral or bacterial 
infection. While current maintenance therapies prevent exacerbations in many COPD patients, exacerbation 
events in others remain poorly controlled, resulting in frequent use of oral corticosteroids and antibiotics and, 
in many cases, recurrent hospital admissions. This is particularly exemplified in a sub-population of patients 
termed frequent exacerbators. Despite treatment, some patients do not regain their baseline lung function 
following an exacerbation and repeated events can lead to an accelerated decline in lung function, resulting in 
a worsening overall quality of life for patients and a significant burden on healthcare resources. 
The prognosis in terms of morbidity and mortality is directly linked to the extent of lung damage. 
2.1.4.  Management 
Management is through smoking cessation, pharmacological intervention with bronchodilators and anti-
inflammatory agents and, when necessary treatment of respiratory infections, physical rehabilitation is aimed 
primarily at muscle strengthening, and in advanced cases long term domiciliary oxygen administration is 
helpful and has a proven benefit on lung function. Some patients are suitable for lung volume reduction 
surgery to reduce non-gas exchanging thoracic space. Once developed the condition is only partly reversible 
so more treatment options are always welcome.  
About the product 
This is an informed consent application in accordance with article 10c of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
The product of this application is a duplicate with identical composition and documentation as Trimbow 
87 micrograms /5 micrograms /9 micrograms pressurised inhalation, authorized on 17 July 2017, marketing-
authorisation holder, Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A. 
Approval was granted for the following indication: 
Maintenance treatment in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) who are not adequately treated by a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting 
beta2-agonist (for effects on symptoms control and prevention of exacerbations see section 5.1). 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
Trydonis 87 micrograms /5 micrograms /9 micrograms pressurised inhalation, the medicinal product of this 
marketing authorisation application, is a duplicate of Trimbow 87 micrograms /5 micrograms /9 micrograms 
pressurised inhalation. Trydonis 87 micrograms /5 micrograms /9 micrograms pressurised inhalation have 
the same qualitative and quantitative composition in terms of active substance, and the same pharmaceutical 
form as the reference product Trimbow 87 micrograms /5 micrograms /9 micrograms pressurised inhalation. 
The MAH for the authorised medicinal product and for the product applied for in the informed consent 
application is the same, Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A. 
Assessment report  
EMA/155337/2018 
Page 7/13 
  
  
A letter of consent to grant full and permanent access to the dossier (module 1 to 5) of the reference product 
Trimbow to fulfil its obligations as MAH as described in Directive 2001/83/EC has been provided with this 
submission. 
2.2.  Compliance with GLP, GMP, GCP 
GLP 
All pivotal non-clinical studies were performed to GLP 
GMP inspection(s) 
No GMP inspection is requested based on this application. 
GCP 
With respect to GCP compliance the Applicant stated within the MAA that the clinical studies were conducted 
in compliance with local regulation and guidance, with the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) 
guidelines and with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) regulations. Study subjects/patients were accorded all rights 
granted by the Declaration of Helsinki. 
2.3.  Quality aspects 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Trimbow application, the quality data in support of the 
Beclometasone / Formoterol / Glycopyrronium bromide Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A. application are identical to 
the up-to-date quality data of the Trimbow dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all 
post-marketing procedures). 
2.4.  Non Clinical aspects 
Trydonis is submitted under an informed consent application, article 10(c) of directive 2001/83/EC. Reference 
is made to TRIMBOW (EMEA/H/C/004257, EU/1/17/1208). The applicant refers to module 4 of the TRIMBOW 
MA.  Therefore,  the  non-clinical  data  in  support  of  the  Trydonis  MAA  are  identical  to  the  up-to-date  non-
clinical  data  of  TRIMBOW  dossier,  which  have  been  assessed  and  authorised  by  the  CHMP.  No  new  non-
clinical data has been submitted.  
The  Applicant  provided  an  environmental  risk  assessment  in  accordance  with  the  “Guideline  on  the 
environmental  risk  assessment  of  medicinal  products  for  human  use”  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00  corr  2). 
The PEC values in Phase I for all active ingredients (beclometasone dipropionate (BDP), formoterol fumarate 
dehydrate  (FF),  and  glycopyrronium  bromide  (GB))  are  below  the  action  limit  of  0.01  µg/L.  For  the  active 
substances  FF  and  GB  no  assessment  in  Phase  II  Tier  A  is  required.  BDP  and  its  active  metabolite 
beclometasone  monopropionate  (B17MP)  are  glucocorticoids.  Glucocorticoids  play  a  role  in  many 
physiological  processes  and  act  as  endocrine  disruptors.  Therefore,  according  to  the  EMA  guideline 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00),  a  tailored  environmental  risk  assessment  strategy  should  be  followed  to 
address its specific mechanism of action irrespective of the action limit of 0.01 µg/L. 
The  Applicant  provided  acceptable  experimental  values  on  log  K OW  of  -0.02  and  -1.35  for  FF  and  GB, 
respectively.  No  further  PBT  assessment  is  required.  For  B17MP  an  experimental  value  of  3.49  is  available

3.  Overall conclusion and benefit risk assessment 
Trydonis  87  micrograms  /5  micrograms  /9  micrograms  pressurised  inhalation,  solution  (beclometasone 
dipropionate/formoterol  fumarate  dihydrate/glycopyrronium)  is  submitted  under  an  informed  consent 
application, article 10(c) of directive 2001/83/EC.  
The  reference  product  for  this  application  is  TRIMBOW  87  micrograms  /5  micrograms  /9  micrograms 
pressurised inhalation, solution (EMEA/H/C/004257, EU/1/17/1208).  
Trydonis and TRIMBOW have the same qualitative and quantitative composition in terms of active substances 
and the same pharmaceutical form. Therefore, the benefit-risk of Trydonis is considered to be positive in the 
following indication: 
Maintenance  treatment  in  adult  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease 
(COPD)  who  are  not  adequately  treated  by  a  combination  of  an  inhaled  corticosteroid  and  a  long-acting 
beta2-agonist (for effects on symptoms control and prevention of exacerbations see section 5.1) 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Trydonis is favourable in the following indication: 
Trydonis is indicated as a maintenance treatment in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who are not adequately treated by a combination of an inhaled 
corticosteroid and a long-acting β2-agonist (for effects on symptoms control and prevention of exacerbations  
see section 5.1).

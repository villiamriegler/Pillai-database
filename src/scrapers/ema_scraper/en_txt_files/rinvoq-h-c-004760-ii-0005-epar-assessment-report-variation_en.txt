2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is a group of diseases that share common clinical, radiographic, and genetic 
features. These include Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS), Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA), reactive arthritis, 
enteropathic or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-related arthritis, and undifferentiated 
Spondyloarthritis.  A more universally consistent way of categorizing SpA patients is to define them by 
their primary and predominant clinical manifestation of axial or peripheral SpA.  
Axial SpA encompasses a spectrum of disease manifestations, which has been split into two categories, 
AS (also called radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) and non-radiographic axial SpA (nr-axSpA), based 
on the 1984 modified New York criteria, which require the presence of sacroiliitis on plain conventional 
radiographs for the classification of AS. The prevalence of AS differs between regions and has been 
estimated to be up to 0.5 % with similar estimated prevalence rates for nr-axSpA, resulting in an 
Assessment report  
EMA/708068/2020  
Page 7/94 
 
 
 
overall prevalence for axial SpA in the United States of approximately up to 1% or even higher in the 
overall population. 
Claimed the therapeutic indicationThe MAH applied for the following indication: 
“Ankylosing spondylitis 
RINVOQ is indicated for the treatment of active ankylosing spondylitis in adult patients who have 
responded inadequately to conventional therapy.” 
The recommended dose of upadacitinib was 15 mg once daily. 
Management 
In 2016, the ASAS and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) published updated treatment 
recommendations for axial SpA, and in 2019 the American College of Rheumatology/Spondylitis 
Association of America/Spondyloarthritis Research and Treatment Network (SPARTAN) published 
updated axial SpA treatment recommendations.  The first-line treatment of axial SpA consists of 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In patients with persistently high disease activity 
despite a course of two NSAIDs given over a total of at least 4 weeks, initiation of a bDMARD is 
recommended, and current practice is to start with a tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitor (TNFi).  If 
TNFi therapy fails, switching to another TNFi or an interleukin-17 inhibitor (IL-17i) is recommended. 
Despite recent advances in the treatment of axial SpA, there remains a significant unmet medical 
need, as only approximately 45% to 50% of patients in the studies of TNFi showed an ASAS40 
response, and only approximately 15% to 20% achieved a state of remission. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
The JAK family is composed of 4 family members:  JAK1, 2, 3, and Tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2).  
Activation of JAK pathways initiates expression of survival factors, cytokines, chemokines, and other 
molecules that facilitate leukocyte cellular trafficking and cell proliferation, which contribute to 
inflammatory and autoimmune disorders.  Hence, the JAK family has evoked interest in the area of 
inflammatory diseases, leading to the development of various JAK inhibitors with different selectivity 
profiles against JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and Tyk2. 
Upadacitinib is a selective and reversible JAK inhibitor. In human cellular assays, upadacitinib 
preferentially inhibits signalling by JAK1 or JAK1/3 with functional selectivity over cytokine receptors 
that signal via pairs of JAK2. 
Upadacitinib (ABT-494) (Rinvoq) is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that was approved for the treatment 
of moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the United States (US) on 16 August 
2019, by the European Commission on 18 December 2019, and has since been approved in multiple 
other countries. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
Scientific Advice was received from CHMP in June 2019, the following issues of relevance for the 
current application were discussed: 
• 
Whether Study M16-098 could be regarded as a pivotal study for this application; this was 
considered a matter of assessment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/708068/2020  
Page 8/94 
 
 
 
• 
• 
The omission of an active control arm in the axSpA study; this was considered acceptable  
Reducing or stopping treatment; the MAH was encouraged to develop an approach for studying 
dose reduction and/or stopping treatment with upadacitinib 15 mg QD, in patients with an extended 
period of low disease activity/near remission. It is recommended to implement this in the long follow-
up phase of patients with active nr-axSpA and with Ankylosing Spondylitis in the clinical study 
program. 
Adherence to the given Advice is commented throughout the report. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
According to the MAH, the pivotal clinical phase 2/3 study M16-098 supporting this Application, is 
being conducted in accordance with the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) and Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines and relevant regulatory requirements.  Subjects are accorded all 
rights granted by the Declaration of Helsinki.  All protocols received approval by the appropriate 
governing investigational review board, ethics committee, or similar authority. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The MAH has provided an ERA, but no new data for the environmental risk assessment were included 
with this application. The submitted ERA was updated from the original ERA submitted for the MAA for 
RA approval, to support the new indication PsA (ongoing procedure), and to support the new indication 
AS (present procedure). 
In the original ERA the results of the Phase I assessment triggered a Phase II Tier A assessment and 
the standard suite of fate and effect studies were completed. 
Upadacitinib is very persistent in sediment according to the OECD 308 study. A Phase II Tier B 
extended effects on water sediment was thus triggered. 
Phase 1 
The daily dose for the indications RA, PsA  and AS is 15 mg/day, resulting in PECSURFACEWATER values of 
0.075 µg/L for each of the indications when using the default Fpen value of 0.01. 
A PECSW-TOTAL was calculated (0.23 µg/L) and was used to re-calculate the Phase II Tier A and Tier B 
PEC/PNEC ratios.  
The Log Pow were 1.81 (pH 4), 2.50 (pH 7), and 2.48 (pH 9).  
Phase II 
For this application, the same PNEC values were presented as for the original ERA submitted for the 
MAA. In the table below the updated PEC/PNEC ratios are presented, based on the PEC value obtained 
for all three indications. These ratios remain far below 0.1, and the conclusion remains: The clinical 
use of upadacitinib is not expected to be a risk for the environment.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The objectives of the clinical pharmacology programme supporting the application for ankylosing 
spondylitis (AS) were to characterize the population pharmacokinetics of upadacitinib in patients with 
AS and to evaluate the relationships between upadacitinib plasma exposures and efficacy as well as 
safety in subjects with active AS using data from Phase 2/3 Study M16-098. 
In total, 92 subjects with active AS who had at least one measurable upadacitinib concentration were 
included in the population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis and 187 subjects [93 subjects administered 
upadacitinib 15 mg once daily (QD) and 94 subjects administered placebo] were included in the 
exposure-response analyses. 
Table 2. Summary of Data Included in the Population Pharmacokinetics and Exposure-Response 
Analyses for Efficacy and Safety 
Analytical method  
Plasma concentrations of upadacitinib were determined using a previously assessed 
(EMEA/H/C/004760/0000) validated liquid chromatography method with tandem mass spectrometric 
detection. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of the assay of plasma samples of Study M16-098 for 
the determination of upadacitinib concentrations is 0.0505 ng/mL. The bioanalytical method was found 
to be adequately validated.

Population pharmacokinetic analysis 
Parameters from the previously built model in healthy volunteers and subjects with rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) were fixed and the model was re-run on the AS dataset by only re-estimated inter-
subject variability (IIV) and residual error terms using the nonlinear mixed effects modeling software, 
nonlinear mixed-effects model (NONMEM). It was further evaluated if subjects with AS have 
significantly different pharmacokinetics from subjects with RA by estimating apparent oral clearance 
(CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution of central compartment (Vc/F) using the AS dataset and 
assessing if the objective function value and visual predictive checks are significantly improved. 
Figure 1. Observed upadacitinib Concentrations Versus Binned Time After Last Dose in AS and RA 
Populations 
Results 
The pharmacokinetic analyses included 452 concentration records with 12 records (2.7%) below the 
LLOQ. One subject (Subject 10291005) was excluded from the analyses because of having 
discontinued treatment after 4 days and having only one concentration measurement, which was BLQ. 
Given the small fraction of concentration below the LLOQ, the M5 imputation method was used by 
imputing BLQ concentrations with the LLOQ/2. Four upadacitinib concentrations (< 1%) were flagged 
as outliers.  
The re-estimation of upadacitinib CL/F and Vc/F using data from subjects with AS did not result in a 
significant change in OFV (model run002, OFV 1762). A model with re-estimated Vc/F only did not 
result in a significant change in OFV from run001 (model run002b OFV 1763) but was found to be 
more stable in terms of successful estimation and covariance steps. This model was hence used to 
obtain the individual Bayesian estimates to derive exposures for the exposure-response analyses. The 
population estimate for Vc/F (171 L) was similar to that obtained from the previously developed RA 
model (156 L).

Parameter estimates of this model (run002b) are provided in Table 3. The additive error term is 
estimated to be very small (7.16E-6) but was kept in the model for consistency with the RA model. 
Random effect distributions by covariates did not indicate that trends exist for the AS population.

Cavg and AUCss,24 were calculated from the individual Bayesian estimates. Trough plasma 
concentration (Ctrough) and Cmax were obtained by steady-state simulations over 21 days. Model-
estimated plasma exposures were very similar to those previously reported in subjects with RA for the 
15 mg QD dose (median Cmax, Cavg, and Ctrough of 41.1, 15.1, and 3.82 ng/mL in RA compared to 
39.6, 14.5 and 3.50 ng/mL in AS, respectively).

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Upadacitinib is a selective and reversible JAK inhibitor. In human cellular assays, upadacitinib 
preferentially inhibits signalling by JAK1 or JAK1/3 with functional selectivity over cytokine receptors 
that signal via pairs of JAK2. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Model-estimated upadacitinib average plasma concentration (Cavg) in subjects with AS in the active 
treatment arm were derived using empirical Bayesian estimates from the population pharmacokinetics 
analysis. Exploratory exposure-response quartile plots were first evaluated for the efficacy and safety 
endpoints to identify the efficacy and safety variables that have a clear relationship with upadacitinib 
Cavg. Only efficacy and safety variables identified to exhibit a clear relationship with upadacitinib Cavg 
were evaluated further using exposure-response models.  
Models describing the relationship between upadacitinib Cavg and efficacy as well as safety variables 
were constructed as logistic regression models using R version 3.5.2 or later. For each of the evaluated 
efficacy and safety variables, models with and without a drug effect function were compared to 
determine if there is a statistically significant effect of upadacitinib exposures on the probability of 
occurrence of each variable. Model selection was based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) since 
non-nested models were compared for base model development.  
The covariates specified for potential investigation for influence on clinical response included the 
following: demographics (age, body weight, sex, race.), baseline disease characteristics (baseline 
PtGA, baseline BASDAI, baseline BASFI, baseline inflammation (based on the mean of Questions 5 and 
6 of BASDAI assessment), baseline CRP level, concomitant medication(s), geographic region and 
duration of disease. 
The covariates specified for potential investigation for influence on safety events included the 
following: demographics (age, body weight, sex, race, etc.), geographical region and baseline 
laboratory measurements. 
Exposure-efficacy 
Exposure-efficacy quartile plots for the percentage of subjects who achieved ASAS20 or ASAS40 
response at Week 14 versus upadacitinib Cavg are presented in Figure 4. upadacitinib Cavg values 
associated with 15 mg QD dose (7 to 33 ng/mL) were associated with higher ASAS20 and ASAS40 
response rates compared to placebo. Within the upadacitinib 15 mg QD treatment arm, no clear trends 
for exposure-response relationship were observed for ASAS20 or ASAS40.

Page 15/94 
 
 
 
 
Figure 4. Exposure-Response Quartile Plots for ASAS20 and ASAS40 at Week 14 in Subjects with AS 
Logistic regression analyses were conducted for ASAS20 and ASAS40 responses to confirm observed 
trends in the exposure-response quartile plots. Linear and non-linear logistic exposure-response 
regression models were compared to models with only intercept and treatment effect terms (placebo 
or upadacitinib 15 mg) for describing each efficacy variable.  ASAS20 and ASAS40 responses were best 
described by models with only an intercept and treatment effect parameters, versus models with 
exposure-driven responses (i.e., using Cavg), based on lower AIC values.  
Exposure-safety 
Exposure-safety quartile plots were generated to identify safety variables demonstrating upadacitinib 
exposure-dependent changes. Subjects were binned according to their individual model predicted 
plasma exposures into quartiles, and the percent of subjects with specific safety events/laboratory 
changes were plotted for each quartile. There were no cases of serious infections or neutropenia 
(Grade 3 or higher: < 1 × 109/L) at Week 14. Only one variable (> 1 g/dL decrease in haemoglobin 
from baseline) showed a trend between upadacitinib Cavg and percent of subjects experiencing the 
event at Week 14 (Figure 5). 
Figure 5. Exposure-Response Quartile Plots for Safety Variables at Week 14 in Subjects with AS 
Logistic regression modelling was performed for the relationship between upadacitinib Cavg and the 
percentage of subjects experiencing > 1 g/dL decrease in haemoglobin from baseline at Week 14. 
There was a statistically significant relationship between increasing upadacitinib Cavg and the 
percentage of subjects experiencing > 1 g/dL decrease in haemoglobin from baseline at Week 14. This 
was based on the lower AIC value for the logistic regression model with an exposure effect compared 
to the model without any drug effect (AIC: 118.204, p-value of likelihood ratio compared to model 
without drug effect: 0.039). A logistic regression model with a linear drug effect function best 
described the probability of experiencing a > 1 g/dl decrease in haemoglobin from baseline at Week 
14. The estimated slope parameter for the base linear logistic regression model describing the 
relationship for decrease in haemoglobin from baseline was 0.070. 
Covariates were tested on the exposure-safety base model for decreases in haemoglobin. Only 
baseline haemoglobin was retained as a covariate on the intercept of the model (Table 4). Higher 
baseline haemoglobin values were associated with a higher percentage of subjects, independent of 
upadacitinib treatment, experiencing a > 1 g/dL decrease from baseline haemoglobin at Week 14.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The objectives of the clinical pharmacology programme supporting the application for AS were to 
characterize the population pharmacokinetics of upadacitinib and to evaluate the relationships between 
upadacitinib plasma exposures and efficacy as well as safety in subjects with active AS using data from 
Phase 2/3 Study M16-098. The data were evaluated using population PK analysis, graphical evaluation 
and exposure-response (logistic regression) analysis.  
Population pharmacokinetic model 
The population PK model previously developed in subjects with RA was determined to adequately 
characterize upadacitinib pharmacokinetics. However, there was high shrinkage (50%) on V2/F, which 
means that Cmax was shrunk towards the population mean.  
The MAH chose to evaluate if the PK between the AS and RA population were similar by re-estimating 
the IIV and subsequently also central volume of distribution. The MAH did not present results when 
only IIVs were re-estimated. The %RSEs are high on IIV (26-110%). The shrinkage values for IIV on 
CL/F and V/F were moderate to low. As expected, the shrinkage value for IIV on the extended release

absorption (Ka) was high. Nonetheless, the individual exposure predictions are considered reliable. A 
small trend in the GOF plots indicates that the model has problems capturing some of the lower 
observed concentrations. The VPCs show a similar trend at the later timepoints since last dose. 
Overall, upadacitinib pharmacokinetics appear to be similar in subjects with AS and RA, and the model 
estimated Cavg were 14.5 ng/mL and 15.1 ng/mL, respectively. 
Exposure-response 
In the exposure-efficacy analyses of upadacitinib on the probability of achieving ASAS20 and ASAS40 
at Week 14, there was a statistically significant treatment effect observed between the placebo and 
upadacitinib 15 mg QD arms. The was no trend towards increased responses with increasing 
upadacitinib exposures within the 15 mg QD arm.  
With increasing upadacitinib exposures, a relationship was found in the percentage of patients 
experiencing decreases in haemoglobin of ≥ 1 g/dL from baseline. No patient experienced changes of ≥ 
2 g/dL decreases in haemoglobin from baseline. No statistically significant trend was found for the 
probability of experiencing any infection, changes in platelet count, or lymphopenia (Grade 3 or higher 
at Week 14) and increasing upadacitinib exposure. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP considered that adequate methods have been used to evaluate the PK and exposure-
response in AS patients. The exposure-efficacy analyses of upadacitinib support the 15 mg QD dosing 
regimen. The CHMP concluded that upadacitinib pharmacokinetics are consistent between rheumatoid 
arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis patients. Section 5.2 of the SmPC was updated accordingly. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
According to the MAH, the selection of the upadacitinib 15 mg QD dose for evaluation in the AS pivotal 
phase 2/3 Study M16-098 was informed by the upadacitinib exposure-response analyses conducted 
using results from 4 RA studies:  two Phase 2 studies (Studies M13-537 and M13-550) and two Phase 
3 studies (Studies M13-549 and M13-542), as well as published results for a Phase 2b AS study of 
another JAKi, tofacitinib (van der Heijde D, Deodhar A, Wei JC, et al.  Tofacitinib in patients with 
ankylosing spondylitis:  a phase II, 16-week, randomised, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study.  
Ann Rheum Dis.  2017;76(8):1340-7).  
Exposure-response analyses using data from upadacitinib Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in subjects with 
RA demonstrated that plasma exposures associated with a dose of upadacitinib 15 mg QD maximized 
upadacitinib efficacy.  Furthermore, exposure-response analyses showed that doses lower than 15 mg 
QD (e.g., 7.5 mg QD) are expected to provide sub-optimal efficacy in the treatment of axial 
spondyloarthritis (axSpA). Using data across Phase 2 and 3 RA studies, exposure-response 
relationships for different safety measures (across 7.5, 15, and 30 mg dose range) showed no 
exposure-dependent increase in occurrence of the following events at either Week 12/14 or Week 
24/26: pneumonia, herpes zoster infection, changes in platelet count (platelets ≥ 600 × 109/L with 
baseline ≤ 400 × 109/L, platelets > 400 × 109/L with baseline ≤ 400 × 109/L), lymphopenia (grade 4 
or higher), and neutropenia (grade 3 or higher upadacitinib exposures of 30 mg QD or higher were 
associated with significantly higher incidences of hemoglobin decrease from baseline (> 1 g/dL and > 2 
g/dL) at Week 12/14 and at Week 24/26 compared with placebo and upadacitinib 15 mg QD).

ASAS 20 calculation for rescue and discontinuation criteria no longer applies post Week 104 
Objectives 
Period 1 
To evaluate the efficacy of upadacitinib compared with placebo on reduction of signs and symptoms as 
measured by the proportion of subjects who achieve an ASAS 40 response at Week 14 in subjects with 
active AS who have had an inadequate response to at least 2 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs) or intolerance to or a contraindication for NSAIDs, and who are naïve to biologic disease-
modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARD). 
To assess the safety and tolerability of upadacitinib in subjects with active AS who have had an 
inadequate response to at least 2 NSAIDs or intolerance to or a contraindication for NSAIDs, and who 
are bDMARD-naïve. 
Period 2 
To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of upadacitinib through up to 2 years of treatment in 
subjects who have completed Period 1.

Subjects achieving ASAS partial remission,  
Change from baseline in the following outcomes:  
•  BASFI,  
• 
linear Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index (BASMIlin), 
•  Maastricht Ankylosing Spondylitis Enthesitis Score (MASES),  
•  work productivity and activity impairment (WPAI) 
•  ASAS Health Index.   
Additional key secondary endpoints included ASAS20 response at Week 14 and change from baseline 
in SPARCC MRI sacroiliac joint score at Week 14 
Definition of endpoints 
ASAS40 response: at least 40% improvement and an absolute improvement of at least 2 units on a 
numerical rating scale of 0– 10 from baseline in at least 3 of the following 4 domains, with no 
worsening in the remaining domain: Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity, Patient's 
Assessment of Total Back Pain, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI), and 
inflammation defined as the mean of the BASDAI questions  on severity and duration of morning 
stiffness (see below for definitions of BASDAI and BASFI). 
ASAS Partial Remission:  Absolute score of ≤ 2 units for each of the 4 domains identified above. 
Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS)(CRP):  The ASDAS is a composite index that 
combines the following 5 disease activity variables:  spinal pain (BASDAI Question 2 NRS score 0 – 
10), peripheral joint pain/swelling (BASDAI Question 3 NRS score 0 – 10), duration of morning 
stiffness (BASDAI Question 6 NRS score 0 – 10), PtGA, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP).  
Higher scores indicate more active disease. 
ASDAS(CRP) Disease Activity States and Response Categories:  ASDAS score can be categorized into 
the following ASDAS disease activity states and response categories: 
•  ASDAS Inactive Disease:  ASDAS < 1.3 
•  ASDAS Low Disease Activity:  ASDAS < 2.1 
•  ASDAS Major Improvement:  a change from baseline ≤ –2.0) 
•  ASDAS Clinically Important Improvement:  change from baseline ≤ –1.1 
MRI SPARCC Spine score:  In total, 23 discovertebral units (DVUs) are assessed by a reviewer per 
subject and time point, and the 6 most severely affected DVUs are selected by each reviewer and used 
to calculate the MRI Spine SPARCC score.  The maximum score for all 6 DVUs is 108. 
BASDAI:  The BASDAI assesses disease activity levels and consists of 6 questions measured on a 0 to 
10 NRS pertaining to the 5 major symptoms of AS:  fatigue; spinal pain (neck, back, hips); peripheral 
joint pain/swelling; areas of localized tenderness (also called enthesitis, or inflammation of tendons 
and ligaments); and morning stiffness (duration and severity).  The overall BASDAI score ranges from 
0 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater disease activity.  Questions 1 through 5 have responses 
that can range from 0 (none) to 10 (very severe); Question 6 has a response range from 0 (0 hours) 
to 10 (2 or more hours), and 5 represents 1 hour. 
BASDAI50:  BASDAI50 response is defined as at least 50% improvement from Baseline in the BASDAI 
score.

Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life (ASQoL) questionnaire:  The ASQoL is an AS specific QoL 
measure that consists of 18 items and evaluates concepts such as ability to perform activities of daily 
living, emotional functioning, pain, fatigue, and sleep problems.  Each item on the ASQoL is given a 
score of "1" or "0," where a score of "1" is given when an item is affirmed indicating adverse QoL.  
Total scores range from 0 to 18, with higher scores representing worse QoL. 
The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI):  The BASFI assesses functional limitations 
in AS.  It consists of 10 items measured on a 0 to 10 NRS, with 0 = easy and 10 = impossible, and 
assesses the subject's ability to perform activities such as dressing, bending, reaching, turning, and 
climbing steps.  The total score (mean of the 10 item scores) ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores 
indicating worse functioning. 
BASMI:  The BASMI assesses spinal mobility in patients with AS.  The Linear BASMI (BASMIlin) 
composite score was calculated using the BASMI components:  lateral lumbar flexion; tragus to wall 
distance, lumbar flexion, intermalleolar, and cervical rotation.  Scores for each assessment range from 
0 to 10, and the BASMIlin total score is the average of the 5 assessment scores.  Higher scores 
indicate decreased spinal mobility. 
The Maastricht Ankylosing Spondylitis Enthesitis Score (MASES tool) is used to assess enthesitis in AS.  
The presence or absence of enthesitis at 13 different sites, noting the subjects' responses, is assessed.  
The following left and right locations were graded for presence (1) or absence (0) of enthesitis:  1st 
Costochondral joint, 7th Costochondral joint, Posterior Superior Iliac Spine, Anterior Superior Iliac 
Spine, Iliac Crest, Proximal Insertion of Achilles tendon; the 5th Lumbar Spinous process was also 
graded for enthesitis yielding a total score ranging 0 – 13. 
Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI):  A patient-reported measure of work productivity 
including presenteeism, absenteeism, overall work productivity loss, and daily activity impairment. 
ASAS Health Index (HI):  The ASAS HI is an instrument for use in patients with all forms of axSpA.  It 
consists of 17 items measuring aspects of global functioning and health that are typical and relevant 
for axSpA patients.  Items are scored dichotomously (0 = do not agree; 1 = agree) and assess pain, 
emotional function, sleep, sexual function, mobility, self-care, and community life.  Total scores range 
from 0 to 17, with lower scores indicating better health. 
Sample size 
The planned total sample size of 170, 85 in each treatment arm, was expected to provide at least 90% 
power to detect a 26% difference in ASAS 40 response rates at Week 14 assuming a placebo ASAS 40 
response rate of 20%, using a two-sided α = 0.05 and accounting for 10% dropout rate.  
Randomisation 
Subjects who met eligibility criteria were to be randomised at day 1 (baseline) in a 1:1 ratio to one of 
the two treatment arms, upadacitinib 15 mg QD or placebo, using IRT (Interactive Response 
Technology). 
Randomisation was stratified by screening high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) (≤ upper limit of 
normal [ULN] vs. > ULN) and geographic region (United States [US]/Canada, Japan, Rest of the World 
[RoW]).

Blinding (masking) 
Period 1 was double-blind. In order to achieve and maintain the blind, upadacitinib tablets and placebo 
tablets provided for the study were to be identical in appearance. Period 2 is an open label long-term 
extension in which all subjects are treated with open label upadacitinib 15 mg QD. An unblinded 
analysis was planned once all subjects had completed Period 1 (Week 14) or discontinued prior to 
Week 14. Study sites and subjects were to remain blinded to the treatment assignment in Period 1 for 
the duration of the study. All sponsor personnel with direct oversight of the conduct and management 
of the trial (with the exception of Drug Supply Management Team) were to remain blinded to each 
subject's treatment throughout Period 1. 
Statistical methods 
The primary analysis was conducted, as had been planned, after all subjects had completed Week 14 
or discontinued prior to Week 14.  
The SAP (version 2.0) was dated 20 Dec 2018 and the primary database lock for Period 1 (Week 0- 
14) was conducted on 05 February 2019 (the cut-off date was 21 Jan 2019). 
All the efficacy analyses were performed using the Full Analysis Set which included all subjects who 
had been randomised and had received at least one dose of study drug. In addition, a PP Set and a 
Safety Set was pre-defined. The PP Set was a subset of the FAS and consisted of all FAS subjects who 
did not have any major protocol deviations up to Week 14. The Safety Analysis Set consisted of all 
subjects who received at least one dose of study drug with subjects analysed "as treated". 
All efficacy analyses were performed adjusting for the stratification factor of hsCRP level collected at 
screening visit. No adjustment was made for multiple centres, and no summaries by study site are 
provided.  
The primary estimand 
The primary estimand was defined as the difference in the proportion of AS patients who achieved 
ASAS 40 response at Week 14 and did not discontinue study drug by Week 14, comparing those who 
were randomised to the upadacitinib 15 MG QD group and received study drug to those who were 
randomised to placebo and received study drug. 
For binary key secondary efficacy endpoints, the primary estimand was defined as for the primary 
endpoint. 
For continuous key secondary efficacy endpoints, the estimand was defined as the difference in mean 
change from baseline at Week 14 under the assumption that patients with missing data including those 
due to premature discontinuation of study drug could have their measurements at Week 14 predicted 
by their observed data and the observed data for other patients for their respective assessments 
during follow-up. The comparison was upadacitinib 15 mg QD vs placebo for patients randomised and 
treated with at least one dose of study drug. 
Handling of missing data and intercurrent events 
NRI 
For binary endpoints, including the primary endpoint, a non-responder imputation approach was 
applied. Subjects who prematurely discontinued from study drug were considered as non-responders 
for all subsequent visits after discontinuation. In addition, any subject with any missing value for 
binary variables at a specific visit was to be treated as non-responder for that visit. 
Assessment report  
EMA/708068/2020  
Page 26/94 
 
 
 
MMRM 
Analyses of continuous endpoints were performed using a MMRM model based on the assumption of 
missing at random. For the MMRM analysis, any data collected after premature discontinuation of study 
drug were excluded. 
As Observed (AO) 
The AO data handling implied that no imputation of missing evaluations was performed, and a subject 
who did not have an evaluation on a scheduled visit was excluded from the AO analysis for that visit. 
Regardless of premature discontinuation of study drug, all observed data was used in the analysis.  
Primary efficacy analysis 
The primary efficacy endpoint was ASAS 40 response at Week 14. Comparisons between upadacitinib 
and placebo was performed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test adjusting for the 
stratification factor of hsCRP level (≤ ULN vs. > ULN). Point estimate, 95% CI using normal 
approximation and p-value for the treatment comparison was presented. In addition, point estimate 
and 95% CI using normal approximation was provided for the response rate for each treatment group. 
The number and percentage of non-responders for ASAS40 was to be summarized into three 
categories: 
1. Subjects who discontinued study drug by Week 14 
2. Subjects who didn't discontinue study drug but had missing Week 14 ASAS 40 measurements 
3. Subjects with ASAS 40 measurements observed and on study drug at Week 14 but didn't meet 
ASAS 40 response criteria 
Analysis of Key Secondary Endpoints: 
For binary key secondary efficacy endpoints, the primary estimand was defined as for the primary 
endpoint and used the same analysis approach. Frequencies and percentages were reported for each 
treatment group and comparisons between the two treatment groups were performed using the 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, adjusting for main stratification factor of screening hsCRP level (> 
upper limit of normal [ULN] vs ≤ ULN). 
For continuous key secondary efficacy endpoints between group comparisons were carried out using a 
mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM). The least squares mean change from baseline and 95% 
confidence interval were reported. The mixed model included treatment group, visit, and treatment-
by-visit interaction as fixed effects, and the corresponding baseline values and the main stratification 
factor of screening hsCRP level (>ULN vs ≤ ULN) as the covariates. An unstructured variance 
covariance matrix was used. The parameter estimations were based on the assumption of data being 
missing at random and using the method of restricted maximum likelihood (REML). 
Supplementary and sensitivity analyses 
For the primary efficacy endpoint, the CMH analysis was repeated using As Observed (AO) data 
handling without any imputation. This analysis was conducted on the FAS based on randomised 
treatment groups. The corresponding estimand for the supplementary analysis was defined as the 
difference in the proportion of AS patients who achieved ASAS40 response at Week 14, regardless of 
whether the subject had discontinued study drug by Week 14, comparing upadacitinib 15 MG QD vs 
placebo for those who were randomised, received study drug and had a efficacy measurement at Week 
14 visit.

EMA/708068/2020  
Page 27/94 
 
 
 
Supplementary estimands were defined also for key secondary endpoints and aligned analyses using 
AO data handling were conducted.  
Handling of Multiplicity 
The overall type I error rate of the primary and multiplicity-adjusted key secondary endpoints was 
strongly controlled at 0.05 level using a fixed testing sequence where statistical significance could be 
claimed for a lower ranked endpoint only if the previous endpoint in the sequence met the 
requirements of significance. As a node in the fixed testing sequence, a group of multiple endpoints 
(including proportion of subjects with BASDAI 50 response, proportion of subjects with ASAS partial 
remission, changes from baseline in ASQoL, BASFI, BASMIlin, MASES, and WPAI) was tested using the 
Hochberg procedure at 0.05 level, conditional on significance of higher-ranked endpoints.  
Graphical multiple testing procedure; 
Efficacy Subgroup Analysis 
The primary efficacy endpoint was further examined in the following subgroups: 
Treatment differences between upadacitinib and placebo were presented in a Forest plot with the point 
estimate and a 95% confidence interval using normal approximation.

EMA/708068/2020  
Page 28/94 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Long-Term Efficacy 
Long-term efficacy by time point was summarized based on observed data only (As Observed). The As 
Observed (AO) data handling implied that no imputation of values for missing evaluations were 
performed and thus, subjects without an evaluation on a scheduled visit were excluded from the AO 
analysis for that visit. Regardless of premature discontinuation of study drug, all observed data were 
used in the analysis. 
Analyses were performed by randomised treatment group sequence: 
1. Placebo → upadacitinib 15 mg QD 
2. upadacitinib 15 mg QD → upadacitinib 15 mg QD 
There was no statistical testing; descriptive statistics were provided for each randomised treatment 
group sequence. These included the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, 95% CI, 
median, minimum, Q1, Q3 and maximum for continuous endpoints; and frequencies and percentages 
with 95% CI using normal approximation for binary endpoints. Plots by randomised treatment group 
sequence over time were provided for the primary endpoint and all ranked (key) secondary endpoints.  
At the cut-off date for the interim study report, all subjects had either discontinued prematurely or had 
completed 64 weeks of the study. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 187 subjects were randomized (please refer to tables below).  A total of 89 subjects in each 
treatment group completed Period 1 on study drug and entered Period 2 on study drug. One subject 
completed Period 1 study participation after discontinuing study drug.  Adverse event was the most 
frequent primary reason for discontinuing study drug in the placebo group (3 subjects); in the 
upadacitinib group, adverse event and withdrawal by subject each accounted for 2 subjects. 
Adverse events and withdrawal by subjects were also the most frequent reasons for discontinuation 
from study participation in Period 1.  Up to the data cut-off date, 28 subjects who entered Period 2 on 
study drug discontinued study drug; the most frequent primary reason for discontinuation of study 
drug was lack of efficacy.

pain medications and Week 20 instead of Week 24 for certain concomitant csDMARDs.  
•  Allowed earlier discontinuation of study drug treatment (at Week 24 instead of Week 32), 
including calculation of Assessment of Spondylo-Arthritis international Society (ASAS) 20 score 
beginning at Week 16 to determine subject response. 
•  Updated results from other clinical studies in support of benefit and risk assessment.  
•  Update references to spondyloarthritis to specify axial manifestation, where not previously

Supplemental electronic case report form (eCRF) for embolic and thrombotic events.  
•  Updated the list of Adverse Events of Special Interest. 
•  Updated adverse event severity assessment and laboratory and vital sign change assessment 
to reference Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) criteria. 
•  Updated the instructions on collection of adverse event information after subject premature 
discontinuation for subjects who continued in the study but were off study drug. 
•  Updated supplemental information to be collected for certain cardiovascular, herpes zoster, 
and thrombotic/embolic adverse events reported during the study.   
•  Updated Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSAR) event reporting reference.  
•  Updated information to be collected on pregnancies reported during the study.  
•  Updated toxicity criteria for potentially serious gastrointestinal (GI) events reported during the 
study.  
•  Updated toxicity management guidelines for serum creatinine laboratory values.

events that have been observed in subjects who receive JAK inhibitors, including upadacitinib 
•  Added management of thrombosis events. 
•  Added management of herpes zoster and a recommendation for periodic skin examination for 
subjects who are at increased risk for skin cancer. 
•  Amended the wording for subjects who experience a study drug interruption > 7 consecutive 
days during Weeks 1 through 14 (Period 1) or > 30 consecutive days during Period2 to allow 
the Investigator to decide if the drug should be re-started; previous wording required that 
upadacitinib be permanently discontinued if interruptions of those lengths occurred

There were approximately 71% males and 29% females. The mean duration of AS symptoms at 
Baseline was 14.4 years (median = 10.6 years), and the mean duration since AS diagnosis was 6.9 
years (median = 3.5 years).  Mean and median Baseline values for PtGA, Patient's Assessment of Total 
Back Pain, Patient's Global Assessment of Pain, BASDAI, inflammation (mean of BASDAI Q5 and Q6), 
which use a 0 to 10 NRS, were 6.4 to 7.0.  The mean hsCRP was 10.7 mg/L (median = 7.4 mg/L; 
upper limit of normal [ULN] = 2.87 mg/L).  The mean MRI SPARCC scores for spine and sacroiliac 
joints were 11.2 (mean = 4.5) and 6.6 (median =0.5), respectively  
The most frequently reported conditions (≥ 5% of total subjects) in the medical history were 
hypertension (18.2%), osteoarthritis (13.4%), seasonal allergy (9.1%), latent tuberculosis (8.0%), 
asthma (7.0%), vitamin D deficiency (7.0%), foot deformity (5.9%), depression (5.3%), and spinal 
pain (5.3%). All subjects had prior NSAID use except for 1 subject who had a contraindication to 
NSAID use (186/187).  Approximately 37% to 38% of subjects in each group had prior conventional-
synthetic (cs) DMARD use, and approximately 18% to 19% of subjects in each group had prior 
corticosteroid use. 
During Period 1, 86.2% of subjects in the placebo group and 76.3% of subjects in the upadacitinib 
group took ≥ 1 concomitant NSAID.  In the placebo group, 12.8% of subjects took ≥ 1 concomitant 
corticosteroid compared with 6.5% of subjects in the upadacitinib group and 18.1% in the placebo 
group and 14.0% in the upadacitinib group received concomitant csDMARD therapy. 
Numbers analysed 
A total of 187 subjects were randomized in the study, 94 in the placebo group and 93 in the 
upadacitinib group.   
All randomised subjects received at least one dose of randomised treatment and were thereby included 
in the Full Analysis Set. This was the primary analysis set to be used for all efficacy analyses. For 
number of subjects included in each analysis set, see below excerpt from Table 5 in the Participant 
flow section (above).

Outcomes and estimation 
Period 1 data were analysed using the primary database (05 February 2019). Long-term data were 
analysed using the 1-year database (13 February 2020). 
Outcome of the Primary Endpoint   
A statistically significant difference vs placebo was achieved for upadacitinib treatment based on the 
primary endpoint ASAS40 at Week 14 using NRI. 
Table 13: Analysis of ASAS40 at Week 14 (NRI; FAS), M16-098 Study 
The majority of the ASAS40 non-responders were based on observed data. Out of the 14 subjects 
imputed as non-responders, 5 were due to missing measurements, and 9 were due to study drug 
discontinuation prior to Week 14; see the table below.

Outcome of the ranked secondary endpoints  
In the table presenting ranked key secondary endpoints “N” had not been explained and for the 
continuous endpoints’ “N” was consistently smaller than the number of subjects  included in FAS 
(placebo:94 and upadacitinib:93). Upon request from the CHMP, the MAH confirmed that all subjects 
included in the FAS was also included in the analyses of ranked key secondary continuous endpoints 
and that "N" in Table 15 represents the number of subjects with change from baseline measurements 
at Week 14.

Long-Term Efficacy Results 
The MAH states that the long-term efficacy data were analysed on as observed data for each 
randomized treatment group sequence. 
According to the MAH, in long-term data through Week 64, ASAS40 response rates and component 
scores were consistently maintained and continued to improve over time for subjects who were 
randomized to upadacitinib.  Subjects who were randomized to placebo and switched to upadacitinib at 
Week 14 showed a similar response to upadacitinib in terms of speed of onset and magnitude of 
improvement after switching.  Each ASAS component had a similar pattern of continued improvement 
in subjects who were randomized to upadacitinib and rapid onset of improvement after switching.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
With this submission, the MAH seeks to add a new indication for Rinvoq (upadacitinib) for the 
treatment of adult patients with active AS who have responded inadequately to conventional therapy. 
This application is supported by data from one phase 2/3 multicenter study, M16-098, that is currently 
ongoing. The first part of the study (Period 1) is a 14-week randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 
placebo-controlled period designed to compare the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib 15 mg once daily

(QD) versus placebo. The second part of the study (Period 2) is an open-label, long-term extension to 
evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of upadacitinib 15 mg QD in subjects who have 
completed Period 1. The study duration included a 35-day screening period; a 14-week randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled period (Period 1); a 90-week open-label extension period (Period 2); 
and a 30-day follow-up visit.  
The MAH has followed most of the advice in the Guideline on the Clinical Investigation of Medicinal 
products for the treatment of Axial Spondyloarthritis (EMA/CPMP/EWP/4891/03 Rev.1, Corr 1*). The 
guideline states that products belonging to new therapeutic classes may need also comparison against 
an accepted active comparator (e.g. anti TNF treatments) for the target population. A three-arm trial is 
therefore recommended, particularly in the case when biological naive patients are to be studied. This 
topic was discussed in the Scientific Advice received from the CHMP (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/340675/2019) 
and the study design was considered acceptable. However, today several biological therapies with the 
same indication exist; hence, the MAH was invited to provide a critical discussion comparing the 
benefits and risks of upadacitinib vs. TNF inhibitors and IL-17 inhibitors previously approved for the 
treatment of AS to put the results into context. Acknowledging the limitation of  judging from head-to-
head studies in RA and PsA and based on the data provided by the MAH, the treatment effects 
observed with upadacitinib in Study M16-098 are within the range of those observed with approved 
targeted therapies for AS, such as TNF inhibitors or IL-17 inhibitors. However, the rates of herpes 
zoster and CPK elevations seem to be higher in subjects on upadacitinib compared to those on the 
TNF-inhibitor adalimumab. 
The EMA guideline states that specific dose response studies should be performed in patients with 
axSpA since there are several antecedents of different response to medicinal products in patients with 
AS compared to the same product in other rheumatic diseases or other AS-related non-articular 
disorders. The initial study protocol aimed to compare two different doses of upadacitinib (15 mg and 
30 mg) but this approach was abandoned with amendment 1. Instead, only the 15 mg dose is used in 
the current study based on exposure-response analyses conducted using results from 4 RA studies and 
a review of a published phase 2 study in another JAK-inhibitor. As stated in the CHMP Advice from 
June 2019, “The dose i.e. 15 mg QD seems an appropriate based on exposure-response analyses 
conducted in RA. From a pragmatic point of view the dose justification is less relevant as study M16-
098 is already completed with the intended dose”. In the exposure-efficacy analyses of upadacitinib on 
the probability of achieving ASAS20 and ASAS40 at Week 14, there was no trend towards increased 
responses with increasing upadacitinib exposures within the 15 mg QD arm but with increasing 
upadacitinib exposures, a relationship was found in the percentage of patients experiencing decreases 
in haemoglobin of ≥ 1 g/dL from baseline. Taken together, although the support for the proposed 
posology in the AS indication is not completely in line with the relevant EMA guidelines, with the 
efficacy and safety data generated by the proposed dose at hand, the justification for the proposed 
dose is considered acceptable to the CHMP. 
As stated in the EMA guideline and also discussed in the SA, once resolution of inflammation has been 
achieved, the possibility of using a reduced dose, or an increased dosing interval or even to stop 
treatment while maintaining disease control, may be valuable information for prescribers and its 
investigation is encouraged. The MAH plans to study treatment withdrawal in related patient 
populations (AS-patients that are bDMARD-inadequate responders and non-radiographic axial SpA 
patients). 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria of the pivotal clinical study adequately defined the intended 
population for the indication. Subjects in the study were to be adults (≥ 18 years of age) and have a 
clinical diagnosis of AS meeting the modified New York Criteria for AS. The subjects were to have an 
active disease defined by having a Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) score 
Assessment report  
EMA/708068/2020  
Page 52/94 
 
 
 
≥ 4 and a Patient's Assessment of Total Back Pain score ≥ 4. In addition, they should have an 
inadequate response to at least 2 NSAIDs over an at least 4-week period in total at maximum 
recommended or tolerated doses or had an intolerance to or contraindication for NSAIDs as defined by 
the Investigator. They also had to be bDMARD naïve but could have received or be on concomitant 
csDMARD treatment. The CHMP considered that the inclusion and exclusion criteria were adequate and 
reflected the intended population in the proposed indication text: “RINVOQ is indicated for the 
treatment of active ankylosing spondylitis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to 
conventional therapy”. 
Eligible patients were randomized in a ratio 1:1 to either upadacitinib 15 mg extended release tablet 
once daily or placebo. After week 14, all patients were to receive upadacitinib 15 mg open label. 
Rescue therapy was allowed after week 16 if the patients had not achieved at least ASAS20 response 
at two consecutive visits.  Rescue therapy included adding or modifying doses of NSAIDs, 
acetaminophen/paracetamol or low potency opioid medications (tramadol or combination of 
acetaminophen and codeine or hydrocodone) (after week 16) and/or modify dose of  MTX or SSZ (after 
week 20). 
The primary endpoint ASAS40 is considered the preferred ASAS response criterion in the current EMA 
Guideline and is supported by the CHMP. The study has in addition several defined multiplicity-
controlled key secondary endpoints evaluating not only symptomatic features, but also spinal mobility 
(BASMI), structural damage (SPARCC, evaluating MRI spine inflammation), enthesitis (MASES), and 
quality of life (ASQoL). The chosen endpoints are endorsed by the CHMP. 
Statistical considerations 
Study M16-098 was initially designed as a placebo-controlled three-arm study to assess two doses of 
upadacitinib; 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD. The study design was revised within a protocol amendment 
before the first subject’s first visit; with no subjects enrolled under the original protocol version. 
Hence, the CHMP did not raise any concern. The planned sample size was 170 (1:1). Although the 
sample size is considered limited given the clinical context, the sample size estimation was 
appropriate. It was based on the primary endpoint and was for the purpose of showing a difference 
versus placebo in ASAS 40 response rate shown to be sufficient. At randomisation subjects were 
stratified by baseline hsCRP (≤ ULN vs. > ULN) and geographic region (US/Canada, Japan, Rest of the 
World). In the efficacy analyses only hsCRP was adjusted for and the MAH was requested to justify this 
point during the review. The rationale for not taking region into account in the analysis was the 
expected few subjects within a stratum. An analysis of the primary endpoint adjusting for both 
stratification factors was nonetheless provided and compared with the primary analysis in which region 
was omitted, the CMH p-values were shown to be similar. The majority of subjects were enrolled at 
sites in Europe (71.1%) and the geographic regions used in subgroup analyses were North America, 
Europe and Other, and hence do not match the strata used for randomisation. This was acceptable to 
the CHMP since the difference will be minor due to that the majority of subjects in the RoW stratum 
emanated from Europe. In addition, the number of subjects randomised in Japan was very limited 
(n=13). Within the RoW stratum, 14/17 countries were European which implied that balance between 
randomised arms was nonetheless achieved irrespective of strata used. 
The primary analysis was conducted, as had been planned, after all subjects had completed Week 14 
or discontinued prior to Week 14. The SAP (version 2.0) was dated 20 Dec 2018 and the primary 
database lock for Period 1 (Week 0- 14) was conducted on 05 February 2019 (the cut-off date was 21 
Jan 2019). The majority of subjects completed period 1 on study drug: 95.7% (89/93) in the 
upadacitinib 15 mg QD arm and 94.7% (89/94) in the placebo arm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/708068/2020  
Page 53/94 
 
 
 
All randomised subjects received at least one dose of randomised treatment and were thereby included 
in the Full Analysis Set. This was the primary analysis set to be used for all efficacy analyses.   
The multiple testing procedure for the primary and the 10 ranked key secondary endpoints is 
considered to have implied strong control of the type I error rate at the 0.05 level. 
The open label phase in the second period of the study hampers the assessment of long-term efficacy. 
However, overall, the statistical analysis methods were considered acceptable to the CHMP. 
The primary estimand was defined as the difference in the proportion of (randomised and treated) AS 
patients who achieved ASAS 40 response at Week 14 and did not discontinue study drug by Week 14. 
Albeit the notation “intercurrent events” has been used, intercurrent events were not explicitly defined 
or discussed. In the analysis of the primary endpoint, subjects who prematurely discontinued from 
study drug were considered as non-responders for all subsequent visits after discontinuation. In 
addition, a non-responder imputation was used for those subjects with a missing assessment at the 
week 14 visit. Rescue therapy was not allowed until week 16; hence, need of rescue should not have 
been expected to have any impact on the primary analysis. The missing data approach was considered 
acceptable to the CHMP and considered to be aligned with the estimand definition. For binary key 
secondary efficacy endpoints, the estimand was defined as for the primary endpoint and used the 
same analysis approach. Binary endpoints were analysed using a CMH test stratified by hsCRP 
providing a p-value for the difference. The point estimate for the difference and corresponding 95% CI 
was estimated using normal approximation.  
For continuous key secondary efficacy endpoints, the estimand was defined as the difference in mean 
change from baseline at Week 14 under the assumption that patients with missing data including those 
due to premature discontinuation of study drug could have their measurements at Week 14 predicted 
by their observed data and the observed data for other patients for their respective assessments 
during follow-up. Analyses of continuous endpoints were performed using a MMRM model based on, in 
alignment with how the estimand had been defined, the assumption of missing at random without any 
explicit imputation in case data was missing. For the MMRM analysis, any data collected after 
premature discontinuation of study drug was excluded. 
Estimand definitions and hence the approach to the handling of missing data did thereby differ 
depending on whether an endpoint was continuous or binary. Since continuous endpoint assessment 
implies an assumption of continued benefit after treatment discontinuation and/or missed visits, 
additional analyses were requested during the review (see further below). 
A supplemental estimand was defined implying for both binary and continuous endpoints that all 
available data at week 14 were to be accounted for regardless of premature discontinuation of study 
drug. For the primary endpoint, the primary CMH analysis was repeated using As Observed data 
handling without any imputation. Contrary to the primary analysis, to be included a subject had to 
have an assessment week 14 albeit ignoring whether the subject was still on randomised treatment or 
not. The lack of an imputation approach in the supplemental analysis was not supported by the CHMP. 
Given the requirement to have an observed value at week 14, the clinical interpretation of this 
estimand was found difficult to understand. Additional analyses were performed post-hoc based on 
regulatory feedback (FDA); among them an analysis of the primary endpoint based on a treatment 
policy estimand, hence ignoring any intercurrent events, using the full analysis set and a non-
responder imputation (NRI) approach to impute the missing ASAS40 responses at Week 14. The CHMP 
considered that this analysis supports the primary outcome and was robust. 
With regard to long-term efficacy analyses, there was no statistical testing planned; only descriptive 
statistics and confidence intervals have been provided. This is agreed by the CHMP. The analyses of 
long-term efficacy were performed using an As Observed (AO) analysis approach which implied that all 
Assessment report  
EMA/708068/2020  
Page 54/94 
 
 
 
observed data was included in the analyses irrespective of whether a subject stayed on randomised 
study drug or not. This approach is not necessarily sufficiently conservative in estimating efficacy 
within each randomised treatment group sequence. Further, they were considered not to be very 
transparent. Hence, the results were difficult to interpret and additional analyses of long-term efficacy 
were requested during the review (see below). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 187 patients were randomized, 94 patients to the placebo group and 93 patients to the 
upadacitinib group. During the first study period (the 14 weeks placebo-controlled period), 9 
participants (4.8%) discontinued the study drug, 5 patients in the placebo group and 4 patients in the 
upadacitinib group. The main reasons for discontinuation were adverse events in the placebo group 
(3/5) and adverse events and withdrawal by subjects in the upadacitinib group (2 patient each).  
A total of 178 (95.2%) patients continued to the second period and received OL upadacitinib (89 
participants from the placebo group and 89 participants from the upadacitinib group). During the OL 
period, 28 patients (15.7%) discontinued study drug. The primary reason for study drug 
discontinuation was lack of efficacy (N=11, 6.2%) and adverse events (N=8, 4.5%). The number of 
subjects who permanently discontinued study drug in Period 2 was the same (each n = 14) for the two 
treatment group sequences.  
The majority of the included patients were male (70.6%), white (82.5%) and European (71.1%). The 
mean age was 45.4 years, mean duration of AS symptoms was 14.4 years, and the mean duration 
since AS diagnosis was 6.9 years.  
The included patients had an active disease indicated by a median (min, max) value of 7.0 (1,10) in 
Patient's Assessment of Total Back Pain and a median value of 6.7 (2,10) in BASDAI. It is noted that 
some patients had a lower disease activity than what was postulated by the inclusion criterion (e.g. 
<4); however, this did not differ between the placebo and upadacitinib group and was addressed by an 
additional analysis excluding the 20 patients (10.7%) who did not meet the eligibility criteria related to 
disease activity (see below). 
All subjects had prior NSAID use except for 1 subject who had a contraindication to NSAID use. 
Approximately 37% to 38% of subjects in each group had prior conventional-synthetic (cs)DMARD use 
and approximately 18% to 19% of subjects in each group had prior corticosteroid use. 
There were some slight imbalances between the two study groups during the placebo-controlled 
period; a numerically higher proportion of subjects in the placebo-group than the upadacitinib group 
took ≥ 1 concomitant NSAID (86.2% vs 76.3%), concomitant csDMARD (18.1% vs 14.0%) and 
concomitant corticosteroids (12.8% vs 6.5%). Otherwise, baseline demographic characteristics were 
generally balanced across treatment groups. 
A statistically significant higher proportion of patients in the upadacitinib group reached ASAS40 at 
week 14 in comparison to the placebo group (51.6% vs 25.5%, p<0.001). The point estimate for the 
difference was 26.1% (95% CI: 12.6%, 39.5%) which is very close to what had been assumed at the 
planning stage (26%). In a post-hoc analysis aligned with a treatment policy estimand the difference 
between the treatments was 25.0% (95% CI: 11.6%, 38.5%) supporting that the primary endpoint 
outcome can be considered robust. Contributing to this conclusion is that the majority of the ASAS 40 
non-responders, 87.8% (101/115), are stated to have been based on observed data and that the 14 
subjects imputed as non-responders was balanced across the two randomised treatments arms 
(upadacitinib: 6, placebo: 8). 
Assessment report  
EMA/708068/2020  
Page 55/94 
 
 
 
An additional analysis for the primary endpoint excluding the 20 patients (10.7%) who did not meet 
the eligibility criteria related to disease activity demonstrated that 56.1% of the patients in the 
upadacitinib group and 28.2% in the placebo group achieved ASAS40 at Week 14 i.e. results were 
consistent with those of the primary analysis. 
Treatment with upadacitinib 15 mg resulted in improvements in individual ASAS components (patient 
global assessment of disease activity, total back pain assessment, inflammation, and function) and 
other measures of disease activity, including hsCRP, at week 14 compared to placebo. 
The difference between treatment groups seems to be observed already at week 2. Results for the key 
secondary endpoints supported the outcome of the primary endpoint, showing statistically significant 
better effect in the upadacitinib group compared to placebo in changes from baseline to Week 14 in 
ASDAS(CRP), SPARCC MRI spine, and BASFI, and proportion of subjects who had BASDAI50 and an 
ASAS partial remission at week 14. 
Of a total of 10 ranked key secondary endpoints, five succeeded whereof the majority were among 
those highest ranked (according to MAH). Among the endpoints that failed three were PROs (ASQoL, 
ASAS(HI) and WPAI Overall Work Impairment). For ASQoL and ASAS(HI) there were numerically 
differences favouring upadacitinib and having used another multiple testing procedure, they could 
eventually have succeeded, at least statistically (nominally p= 0.016 for ASQoL and nominally p= 
0.007 for ASAS(HI)). For the analysis of MASES and WPAI Overall Work Impairment it was considered 
by the CHMP that it could, at least in part, be a question of power and eventually an underestimation 
of the number of subjects that where to contribute with data.  
Across key ranked secondary endpoints, the CHMP considered that there was an uncertainty for 
several of the endpoints due to the amount of missing data. For the binary endpoint analyses, all 
randomised subjects had an assessment at week 14, if not observed, subjects were assigned a value 
(0 referring to failure) but for the analyses of change from baseline, no explicit imputation method was 
applied. A rather high proportion of subjects was not included in the analysis of the MRI of the spine 
and sacroiliac joints score, the MAH clarified that only subjects with MRIs that were performed within 
the pre-specified analysis window were part of the primary MRI analysis. These answers were 
considered acceptable to the CHMP. 
Among continuous endpoints for which a statistically significant difference in favour of upadacitinib was 
demonstrated, the “N” for ASDAS (CRP) and BASFI represented approximately 90% of randomised 
subjects and was also similar in the two arms. For SPARCC-Score Spine, it is acknowledged that the 
number of subjects in this respect was much lower and also unbalanced between randomised arms: 
60/94 (63.8%) in the placebo arm and 68/93 (73.1%) in the upadacitinib arm. 
Considering the assumption of missing at random in the primary analysis and the requirement of 
having an assessment week 14 in the supplemental analysis of continuous endpoints, additional 
analyses of all ranked key continuous secondary endpoints were requested during the review. They 
were to be based on all subjects in the FAS using multiple imputation (MI) and a jump to reference 
approach. Sensitivity analyses for all ranked key secondary continuous endpoints were provided. They 
are considered to offer more conservative estimates of the treatment efficacy of upadacitinib in 
comparison with placebo albeit have no impact on study conclusions. For the key secondary endpoint 
change from baseline in ASDAS (CRP) at Week 14, the presentation of outcomes in the Section 5.1 of 
the SmPC from the primary analysis was agreed given the small differences in the estimates and the 
convincing statistically evidence.  
During the first 14 weeks, it is noticed that a plateau seems to be reached at week 12-14 in the 
upadacitinib group although results from the long term analysis provided by the MAH seems to indicate 
additional improvement beyond this timepoint. While clinical response is generally achieved with 
Assessment report  
EMA/708068/2020  
Page 56/94 
 
 
 
upadacitinib treatment within 14 to 16 weeks, response rates further improve with continued 
treatment beyond Week 16, particularly for endpoints reflecting greater depth of response, such as 
remission and low disease activity. However, of the subjects that have not even achieved ASAS20 at 
week 16, only few additional subjects attain an initial ASAS20 response after this time point. Based on 
these observations, the MAH proposed to add the following text to section 4.2 of the SmPC: 
“Consideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients with ankylosing spondylitis who 
have shown no response after 16 weeks of treatment. Some patients with initial partial response may 
subsequently improve with continued treatment beyond 16 weeks.” 
The SmPC-proposal was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
The CHMP noted that many subjects stayed in the study and contributed with data up to at least week 
64. However, 28 patients (15.7%) discontinued study drug treatment during the OLE period, the 
primary reason being lack of efficacy (n=11, 6.2%). Presentation of study drug discontinuations in 
period 2 was only summarised for all subjects combined and a new table was requested describing 
subjects’ status and reasons for study drug discontinuation in period 2 by randomised treatment group 
sequence (upadacitinib – upadacitinib and placebo – upadacitinib). In addition, the MAH was requested 
to summarize e.g. need of rescue during period 2. The MAH clarified that per the data cutoff date (31 
January 2020) the number of subjects ongoing in Period 2 on drug without having received rescue 
medication (among subjects entering period 2 on drug) was high in both groups and also very similar; 
69/89 (77.5%) in the placebo-upadacitinib group and 68/89 (76.4%) in the upadacitinib- upadacitinib 
group. At the time, only a few subjects (4 and 3 respectively) had completed period 2 / week 104 all 
on study drug and without having received rescue. 
After week 14, all the patients were to receive upadacitinib open label. The data provided by the MAH 
seems to imply that the percentage of patients receiving ASAS 40 response were still increasing after 
week 14, and at week 52 as many as 80% of the patients had received ASAS 40 response. This finding 
is quite remarkable (even if figures are somewhat overestimated, see below) and still unexplained. 
However, it does not seem to be driven by the use of rescue medication. Up to the data cut-off date, 
rescue medication was provided to only 8 subjects; 3 subjects in the placebo-to-upadacitinib group 
and 5 subjects in the upadacitinib group. In this small subgroup, the addition of rescue medication 
resulted in only a few subjects achieving an ASAS40 response at Week 52: 1 in the placebo-to-
upadacitinib group and 2 in the upadacitinib group. In the analyses of long-term efficacy, an “As 
observed” (AO) data handling was used. The AO implied that no imputation of values for missing 
evaluations were performed and thus, subjects without an evaluation on a scheduled visit were 
excluded from the AO analysis for that visit. Further, all observed data was included in the analysis 
regardless of premature discontinuation of study drug. Hence, additional analyses of ASAS40 were 
requested by the CHMP. The number of observed and imputed non-responders together with reason in 
case NRI was applied were presented. Based on these analyses, the outcomes initially presented based 
on data “as observed” implied that efficacy at later time-points have been overestimated. In the FAS 
(NRI) analysis performed in response to the CHMP, the week 52 response rate among those initially 
randomised to upadacitinib 15 mg was estimated to be 67.7% (63/93). The CHMP recognised that in 
the week 52 analysis, few had received rescue or had missing visits and also, that it was not that 
many in the upadacitinib arm who had discontinued treatment with study drug (12.9% (12/93)). 
Based on the additional analyses performed, the CHMP considered that there is support of a continued 
benefit of treatment with upadacitinib beyond week 14 and currently, there is data available up to 
week 64.  
A treatment effect vs placebo was seen across the investigated subgroups including subgroups based 
on concomitant use of NDAIDs and steroids.

2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
A clinically relevant effect as measured by ASAS40 has been demonstrated for upadacitinib 15 mg in 
the target population of subjects with active AS and inadequate response or intolerance/ 
contraindication to NSAIDs.  Overall, there is also support from secondary endpoints measuring 
different aspects of the disease. 
Although there is still an uncertainty with regards to the precise magnitude of the long-term efficacy, 
the CHMP agreed that there is support of a continued benefit of treatment with upadacitinib beyond 
week 14. 
Hence, the indication for the treatment of active ankylosing spondylitis in adult patients who have 
responded inadequately to conventional therapy was considered acceptable to the CHMP from an 
efficacy perspective. The proposed dosing regimen of 15mg once daily was also supported by the 
CHMP.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Safety data from the randomized, controlled Phase 2/3 study (Study M16-098) in subjects with active 
AS was submitted along with supportive safety data from upadacitinib rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 
psoriatic arthritis (PsA) clinical programs. 
Patient exposure 
A total of 182 subjects received ≥ 1 dose of upadacitinib 15 mg in the Phase 2/3 Study M16-098, 
representing 237.6 patient years (PYs).  In the 14-week placebo-controlled period, subjects in the 
upadacitinib and placebo groups each had a mean exposure of approximately 95 days (~13.6 weeks).  
Up to the data cutoff date, 160 of the 182 subjects (87.9%) had exposure to upadacitinib for ≥ 12 
months.

g-Term (Safety Analysis Set) 
Adverse events 
A TEAE was defined as any event with onset on or after the first dose of study drug and up to 30 days 
after the last dose of study drug or up to the cutoff date, whichever came first.  Treatment-emergent 
AEs for the placebo-controlled period were defined as any AE with an onset date that was on or after 
the first dose of study drug in the placebo-controlled period and prior to the first dose of study drug in 
Period 2 or up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug, whichever was earlier.  Events for which 
the onset date was the same as the study drug start date were assumed to be treatment-emergent, 
unless exact times of the events were available.  All AEs are treatment-emergent unless otherwise 
noted. Adverse events were coded by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) using the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) dictionary.  
Placebo-controlled period 
An overview of TEAEs in the placebo-controlled part of the pivotal study is presented in the table 
below.

Table 21: Overview of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events in the Placebo-Controlled Period (Safety 
Analysis Set), Study M16-098 
In the placebo-controlled period, the most frequently reported (≥ 15% of subjects) TEAEs by MedDRA 
system organ classes (SOC) in the upadacitinib group were Infections and Infestations (20.4%), 
Gastrointestinal Disorders (19.4%) , and Investigations (16.1%). Infections were reported by 20.4% 
of subjects in the upadacitinib group and 26.6% of subjects in the placebo group.  The most frequently 
reported infections (≥ 2 subjects) in the upadacitinib group were nasopharyngitis, influenza, and 
tonsillitis and in the placebo group were nasopharyngitis, rhinitis, upper respiratory tract infection, 
pharyngitis, urinary tract infection, and viral infection. 
In the placebo-controlled period, the most frequently reported TEAEs (≥ 5% of subjects) in the 
upadacitinib group were blood creatine phosphokinase (CPK) increased, diarrhoea, nasopharyngitis, 
and headache compared with diarrhoea and nausea in the placebo group. The frequencies of CPK 
increased and ALT increased were 8.6% and 4.3%, respectively, in the upadacitinib group compared 
with 2.1% for each event in the placebo group. Nausea was the event most frequently reported in a 
larger proportion of subjects in the placebo group (5.3%) compared with the upadacitinib group 
(1.1%).

Long-term data  
In the long-term data up to the data cutoff date, 618 AEs (260.1 events [E]/100 PYs) were reported in 
182 subjects (237.6 patient-years [PYs]) who received upadacitinib 15mg QD.  Among the 182 
subjects exposed to upadacitinib, 7 severe AEs (2.9E/100 PYs), 14 SAEs (5.9E/100 PYs) and 15 AEs 
(6.3E/100 PYs) leading to discontinuation were reported.  No deaths were reported

In the long-term data, upadacitinib TEAE rates were highest in the SOC of Infections and Infestations 
(80.0 E/100 PYs), followed by the SOCs of Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders (27.4 
E/100 PYs), Gastrointestinal Disorders (26.9E/100 PYs), and Investigations (26.5 E/100 PYs). Among 
infections, nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection had the highest event rates, 15.6 and 
10.9 E/100 PYs, respectively. Overall, the most frequently reported events (≥ 5 E/100 PY) were 
nasopharyngitis, blood CPK increased, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, ALT increased, and 
diarrhea.

A total of 186 AEs (78.3 E/100 PYs) were considered by the investigator to have a reasonable 
possibility of being related to upadacitinib treatment.  Study-drug related AEs with ≥ 5E/100 PYs were 
blood CPK increased, nasopharyngitis, and upper respiratory tract infection. 
Extra-Articular Manifestations of AS 
Uveitis: In the current AS study, 24 (25.5%) subjects in the placebo group and 16 (17.2%) subjects in 
the upadacitinib group had anterior uveitis at Baseline (Screening) In the placebo-controlled period, 3 
(3.2%) subjects receiving placebo experienced uveitis flares (PT: iridocyclitis; the 3 subjects on 
placebo had a history of uveitis). No subject receiving upadacitinib experienced uveitis flares. 
In the long-term data, 13 uveitis events (PTs of iridocyclitis, iritis, and uveitis) were reported at a rate 
of 5.5E/100 PY in subjects receiving upadacitinib. All uveitis events with upadacitinib treatment were 
observed subjects with a history of uveitis. 
Inflammatory Bowel Disease: In the placebo-controlled period, 1 subject on placebo (without a history 
of inflammatory bowel disease), and no subject on upadacitinib had a new onset of inflammatory 
bowel disease. In the long-term data, no new onset or exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease 
was observed during upadacitinib treatment.

No deaths occurred up to the data cut-off date. 
Other Serious Adverse Events 
In the placebo-controlled period, 1 SAE of spinal osteoarthritis was reported in a subject in the 
upadacitinib group, and 1 SAE of cardiovascular disorder was reported in a subject in the placebo 
group. 
In the long-term data, 14 SAEs (5.9 E/100 PYs) were reported in 12 subjects; according to the MAH, 
there was no discernible pattern to the SAEs reported. Three SAEs were reported in the 
Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders SOC:  osteoarthritis, periarthritis, and spinal 
osteoarthritis. Three SAEs were reported in the Injury, Poisoning, and Procedural Complications SOC:  
facial bones fracture, multiple fractures, and radius fracture. Other SOCs had ≤ 2 SAEs reported.

Adverse Drug Reactions 
Adverse events were evaluated for inclusion as adverse drug reactions (ADR) based on the totality of 
the evidence with the following considerations: disproportionate number of reports between placebo 
and upadacitinib, similar trend among medically-related events, temporal relationship, 
dechallenge/rechallenge information for relevant event reports, preclinical data, and biological 
plausibility based on mechanism of action and/or class effect. All currently labeled ADRs for RA and 
PsA were reviewed against the Study M16-098 safety data to determine whether any meaningful 
change in the rates for the ADRs had occurred to warrant a frequency change in the presentation in 
Assessment report

the ADR table.  Following this assessment process, the MAH concludes that no new ADRs were 
identified based on analysis of AEs and medical review of the placebo-controlled data. In addition, all 
the currently labeled ADRs had no meaningful change in their rates. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
As of the data cut-off date, no events in the following AESI categories were reported in Study M16-098 
by any subject: serious infection, NMSC, lymphoma, gastrointestinal perforation, renal dysfunction, 
active TB, adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) or adjudicated VTE. 
Opportunistic Infections 
A single subject experienced 2 episodes of non-serious esophageal candidiasis, 1 AE in each study 
period resulting in temporary interruption of study drug. Both events resolved after treatment. 
Opportunistic infections are an identified risk of upadacitinib treatment, and a warning regarding this 
risk is included in the current product information 
Herpes Zoster 
No herpes zoster AE was reported in the placebo-controlled period.  
In the long-term data, 5 events (2.1 E/100 PYs) of herpes zoster were reported in 4 subjects. All 
herpes zoster AEs were assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug. 
None of the herpes zoster events were serious, but 1 subject discontinued study drug as a result of a 
herpes zoster AE. All events were mild or moderate in severity and confined to a single dermatome. 
Herpes zoster is an identified risk for upadacitinib treatment and is described in the current product 
information. The MAH states that long-term event rate of herpes zoster observed with upadacitinib 15 
mg in the AS clinical study was not higher than that observed previously in the RA programme.   
Malignancy 
No malignancy, including NMSC and lymphoma, was reported in the placebo-controlled period.  
In the long-term data, 1 malignancy (0.4 E/100 PYs), a SAE of squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, 
was observed. The AE was reported in a former smoker who had < 5 months exposure to upadacitinib.  
The AE was assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug. As an 
important potential risk, malignancies are included in the warnings and precautions of current product 
information. The MAH states that an increased risk of malignancy has not been observed with 
upadacitinib 15 mg therapy during the AS, PsA and RA clinical trials to date. However, malignancies 
have a long latency to onset, and administration of immunomodulatory drugs may increase a person's 
susceptibility to develop malignancies. 
Hepatic Disorders 
In the placebo-controlled period, the proportion of subjects with AEs of hepatic disorders was greater 
in the upadacitinib group than the placebo group (5.4% versus 2.1%. Seven non-serious AEs of 
hepatic disorders were reported in 5 subjects in the upadacitinib group. The hepatic disorders in these 
subjects were all asymptomatic alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 
increased or hepatic enzymes increased. None of the events led to discontinuation of study drug.  Five 
of 7 events in the upadacitinib group were mild, and 2 were moderate.  
At Week 14, greater mean increases from Baseline in ALT and AST (each 5.8 U/L) were observed in 
subjects in the upadacitinib group vs the placebo group (ALT:  –2.7 U/L; AST:  –1.4 U/L).  The 
majority of ALT/AST elevations were <3 × ULN. 
Assessment report  
EMA/708068/2020  
Page 68/94 
 
 
 
In the long-term data, 24 hepatic disorders (10.1 E/100 PYs) were reported in 15 subjects who 
received upadacitinib. No report was serious, and none led to discontinuation of study drug.  ALT 
increased (12 events [5.1E/100 PYs]) and AST increased (7 events [2.9 E/100 PYs]) were the most 
frequently reported hepatic disorders.  Eight AEs of ALT increased, and 4 AEs of AST increased were 
assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug. Through Week 64, greater 
mean changes from Baseline in ALT, AST, and bilirubin upadacitinib therapy were observed in subjects 
who received upadacitinib. Two subjects had potentially clinically significant Grade 3 ALT/ AST 
increases. Both ALT and AST values decreased to normal ranges or Baseline levels without study drug 
discontinuation.  No cases met the biochemical criteria for Hy's law. Increases in ALT and AST are 
listed as ADRs in the current product information. The MAH states that the nature and severity of ALT 
and AST elevations observed with upadacitinib 15 mg in the AS patient population, as judged by the 
assessment of the reported laboratory values, were similar to that reported previously in the RA 
programme. Due to the observation of transaminase elevations with upadacitinib treatment, potential 
for drug induced liver injury remains an important potential risk for upadacitinib. 
Anemia 
No AE of anemia was reported in the placebo-controlled period. At Week 14, mean changes from 
Baseline in hemoglobin were for the upadacitinib group 0.1 g/L and for the placebo group –0.2 g/L.  No 
Grade 3 hemoglobin value was reported in the placebo or upadacitinib group.  
In the long-term data, 3 events (1.3 E/100 PYs) of anemia were reported. No event was serious, 
severe, or led to study drug discontinuation. According to the MAH, through Week 64, mean 
hemoglobin values were essentially unchanged in subjects who received upadacitinib. No subjects had 
≥ Grade 3 decreases in hemoglobin. Recommendations for dose interruption of upadacitinib for low 
hemoglobin are provided in the current product information.  The MAH states that overall, no clinically 
meaningful impact on hemoglobin levels was observed with upadacitinib 15 mg treatment in the AS 
clinical studies.  The long-term rate of anemia observed was, according to the MAH, not higher than 
that reported previously in the RA program. 
Lymphopenia 
In the placebo-controlled period, no AE of lymphopenia was reported.   
At Week 14, a numerically greater mean increase from Baseline in lymphocyte count was observed in 
subjects in the upadacitinib group vs the placebo group (0.139 × 109/L vs 0.015 × 109/L).  No≥ Grade 
3 lymphocyte count decrease was reported in the placebo or upadacitinib group. In the long-term data, 
2 events (0.8 E/100PYs) of lymphopenia were reported.  Neither event was serious, severe, or led to 
study drug discontinuation. The MAH states that overall, lymphocyte mean changes from Baseline were 
small in subjects receiving upadacitinib through Week 64, and lymphocyte values tended to fluctuate 
between increases and decreases. No subject had a post-Baseline Grade ≥ 3 lymphocyte count 
decrease. Recommendation for dose interruption of upadacitinib for low absolute lymphocyte count is 
provided in the current product information. According to the MAH, overall, no clinically meaningful 
impact on lymphocyte counts was observed with upadacitinib 15 mg treatment in the AS clinical 
studies. The long-term rate of lymphopenia observed was not higher than that reported previously in 
the RA programme. 
Neutropenia 
In the placebo-controlled period, 1 AE of neutropenia (Grade 2 neutrophil count decreased) assessed 
as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug was reported in the upadacitinib 
group.  Study drug was interrupted for 5 days and re-started.  A numerically greater mean decrease 
from Baseline in neutrophil count was observed in the upadacitinib group vs the placebo group at Week 
Assessment report  
EMA/708068/2020  
Page 69/94 
 
 
 
14 (−0.595 × 109/L vs −0.052 × 109/L).  In addition, a larger proportion of subjects in the 
upadacitinib group compared with the placebo had shifts from high or normal at Baseline to low post-
Baseline values in neutrophil count (16.5% compared with 4.3%, respectively. In the long-term data, 
7 (2.9 E/100 PYs) AEs of neutropenia were reported, the majority of these events were not associated 
with infections.  Five neutropenia AEs were assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being related 
to study drug. Most events were mild, no event was serious, and no subject discontinued study drug as 
a result of an AE of neutropenia. The MAH states that neutrophil mean changes from Baseline were 
small through Week 64.  Two subjects (1.1%) experienced Grade 3 neutrophil count decreases. 
Neutropenia is listed as an ADR for upadacitinib, and the recommendation for dose interruption of 
upadacitinib for low absolute neutrophil count is also provided in the current product information. The 
long-term rate and severity of the neutropenia in the AS clinical studies were, according to the MAH, 
similar to that observed previously in the RA programme. 
Creatine Phosphokinase Elevation 
In the placebo-controlled period, a larger proportion of subjects who received upadacitinib (8 [8.6%] 
subjects) had AEs of CPK elevation compared with placebo (2 [2.1%] subjects).  Events in 4 subjects 
who received upadacitinib and 1 subject who received placebo were mild and assessed as having a 
reasonable possibility of being related to study drug.  No subjects had severe events. At Week 14, 
subjects in the upadacitinib group had a numerically greater mean increase in CPK versus placebo 
group (upadacitinib 58.5U/L vs placebo –57.8 U/L).  A Grade3 (> 5 – 10 × ULN) increased CPK value 
was reported in 1(1.1%) subject in each of the placebo and upadacitinib groups  
In the long-term data, 28 AEs of CPK elevation (11.8 E/100 PYs), none severe, were reported in 23 
subjects (19 male; 4 female) who received upadacitinib. Sixteen events were assessed as having a 
reasonable possibility of being related to study drug.  All events were non-serious, and none led to 
discontinuation of study drug). Mean CPK values increased from Baseline to Week 4 for subjects who 
received upadacitinib group and then generally stabilized through Week 64.  Most CPK elevations were 
<4 × ULN, and the majority of subjects were asymptomatic.  "Exercise or other vigorous physical 
activity" was reported by more than 50% of subjects who had increased CPK. Five (2.7%) Grade 3 and 
2 (1.1%) Grade 4 elevations were reported).  Most of the Grade 3 and Grade 4 CPK elevations 
occurred at 1 time point only followed by normalization at subsequent testing.  All Grade3 or 4 CPK 
elevations occurred in young male subjects; 86% (6 of 7) did not lead to study drug interruption or 
discontinuation. Two CPK increases were reported as AEs. No event of rhabdomyolysis was reported. 
The MAH concludes that CPK elevation is an identified ADR for upadacitinib and is considered to pose 
minimal clinical impact due to most elevations being asymptomatic and drug discontinuations related 
to CPK elevations being uncommon. In addition, the AS population has a predominance of males who 
have a greater muscle mass than females, which may contribute to a higher rate of CPK elevations 
being observed in the AS study compared to the RA clinical programme. However, the nature (e.g., 
nonseriousness, few leading to study drug discontinuation, lack of associated symptoms) and severity 
of CPK elevations in the AS program was, according to the MAH, similar to that observed previously in 
the RA programme. 
Renal Dysfunction 
No AEs of renal dysfunction were reported up to the data cut-off date.  At Week 14, subjects in the 
upadacitinib group had a numerically greater mean increase from Baseline in serum creatinine versus 
the placebo group.  According to the MAH, through Week 64, minimal mean increases from Baseline in 
serum creatinine were observed for subjects receiving upadacitinib.  No Grade ≥ 3 value for creatinine 
was reported.  The MAH states that overall, no clinically meaningful impact on creatinine levels was 
observed with upadacitinib 15 mg treatment in the AS clinical studies.

Other Areas of Safety Interest   
Lipids 
Mean values for total cholesterol, HDL-C and LDL-C increased for subjects receiving upadacitinib 
through Week 64.  In the long-term data, 5.0%, 6.1%, and 15.5% of subjects had shifts from low or 
normal at Baseline to high final post-Baseline values for LDL-C, total cholesterol, and HDL-C, 
respectively.  In total, 4 (2.2%) subjects had Grade 3 and 2 (1.1%) subjects had Grade 4 triglyceride 
increases; 1 (0.5%) subject had Grade 3 increase of total cholesterol. Two nonserious events of 
hypertriglyceridemia were reported. Current upadacitinib information in RA, advises prescribers to 
assess lipid parameters at approximately 12 weeks following initiation of treatment and manage 
patients according to applicable clinical guidelines for hyperlipidemia. 
Laboratory findings 
Additional Clinical Laboratory Measurements  
Evaluation of mean changes over time and potentially clinically significant abnormalities in hemoglobin 
values and neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, as well as transaminases and CPK were evaluated and 
reported in the section for the respective associated AESIs. The MAH states that other than that 
discussed in the AESI sections above, evaluation of changes in hematology and clinical chemistry 
values  did not identify any significant safety concerns with upadacitinib treatment. 
At Week 14, the mean increase from Baseline in platelets was 8.4 × 109/L in the upadacitinib group 
versus 1.0 × 109/L in the placebo group. No subject had a post Baseline platelet value meeting ≥ 
Grade 3 values (during the placebo-controlled period or in the long-term data). 
For most hematology and chemistry parameters, small numbers of subjects shifted from high or 
normal at Baseline to low post-Baseline or from low or normal at Baseline to high post-baseline. In 
long-term data, ≥ 10% of subjects shifted from high or normal at baseline to low post-baseline for 
hemoglobin and neutrophil counts and from low or normal at baseline to high post-baseline for ALT, 
AST, bilirubin, BUN, albumin, cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol. 
Vital Signs  
According to the MAH, through Week 64, few subjects had potentially clinically significant (PCS) vital 
sign values for increased or decreased systolic or diastolic blood pressure, increased or decreased 
pulse, or increased or decreased respiratory rate; no subject had increased temperature.   
In the long-term data, eight subjects (4.4%) had decreased weight > 7% from Baseline, and 40 
subjects (22.0%) experienced a weight increase > 7%. Weight gain is an ADR for upadacitinib and is 
listed in the current product information. The weight changes observed in the AS clinical study is 
according to the MAH similar to those reported in the RA clinical development programme. 
Safety in special populations 
Pregnancy  
There were no pregnancies reported to date in female subjects in the AS program.  
The MAH has provided information about pregnancies in the other study programmes. As of 15 
February 2020, there were a total of 39 pregnancies reported in female subjects conservatively 
considered to have been exposed to upadacitinib in clinical studies of RA, PsA, atopic dermatitis, 
ulcerative colitis, and CD. Of the 39 pregnancies, 13 were live births in women exposed to upadacitinib 
Assessment report  
EMA/708068/2020  
Page 71/94 
 
 
 
during the first 4 to 8 weeks of pregnancy with no congenital anomalies reported. There were 12 
spontaneous abortions identified in pregnant females with various risk factors (e.g., age > 35 years of 
age, MTX exposure during pregnancy) and the resulting rate of spontaneous abortion was consistent 
with what has been reported in patients with rheumatic diseases on MTX. Four elective terminations 
did not report any foetal defects.  There was 1 ectopic pregnancy, 1 unknown outcome, and 8 
pregnancies were ongoing as of the data cut off (15 February 2020). 
Other safety data in special populations 
According to the MAH, safety in Special Groups Subgroup analyses of AE data for E/100 PYs, AESI/100 
PYs, AEs by SOC and PT were performed for age, sex, race and body mass index (BMI) groups; 
analyses did not reveal a clinically relevant increased risk for upadacitinib treatment based on these 
intrinsic subject factors. Given this assessment, no special considerations for upadacitinib 15 mg 
treatment based on the age, sex, race, BMI, or age are warranted beyond those already described for 
the RA patient population. For the extrinsic factor of csDMARD use, < 20% of subjects were on 
concomitant csDMARDs during the study. As a result, no conclusions can be made regarding increased 
risk of AEs when upadacitinib is used in combination with csDMARDs. However, the MAH states that 
based on the analysis of data from the upadacitinib PsA programme with a larger sample size, the 
safety profile was generally similar between the upadacitinib monotherapy and upadacitinib 
combination therapy, with the exception of higher rates of serious infections, hepatic disorder, and CPK 
elevation in the combination therapy.  Of note, csDMARDs have generally not been demonstrated to be 
effective in AS and are not part of the overall treatment recommendations. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the placebo-controlled period, the proportion of subjects with AEs leading to discontinuation of study 
drug was similar in subjects receiving upadacitinib (2 [2.2%] subjects) and placebo (3[3.2%] subjects) 
Events of dyspepsia, blood CPK increased, and atlantoaxial instability were each reported in 1 subject 
in the placebo group, and events of otitis media and myalgia were each reported in 1 subject in the 
upadacitinib group. The subject with myalgia did not have a concurrent CPK increase. There were no 
laboratory AEs in a subject receiving upadacitinib that led to discontinuation of study drug.

Post marketing experience 
Upadacitinib 15 mg daily dose was first approved for the treatment of RA on 16 August 2019 
(international birth date [IBD]) in the United States. Through 31 January 2020, upadacitinib has been 
approved in 41 countries with estimated cumulative exposure of 3,138 patient treatment years across 
9 countries. 
The overall safety of upadacitinib 15 mg QD therapy was evaluated through review of post-marketing 
reports (spontaneous, solicited, literature) received from 16 August 2019 through 15 February 2020.  
Assessment report  
EMA/708068/2020

Search of the AbbVie global safety database retrieved 1,573 reports. Overall, 90% of the reports were 
considered nonserious and 95% were from solicited source. The most frequently reported MedDRA 
SOC was Infections and Infestations, in which nasopharyngitis, sinusitis, and URTI had the greatest 
number of reports. Among all the reports, the most common AEs reported included headache (7%), 
nausea (7%), drug ineffective (6%), fatigue (6%), and arthralgia (5%) The most commonly reported 
SAE was pneumonia (1%), and the remaining SAEs were reported in less than 0.5% of the retrieved 
reports.  Generally, the type and pattern of SAEs reported were, according to the MAH, similar to what 
has been observed in the RA clinical trials for upadacitinib. Causality could not be assessed for the few 
reports describing events of hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions due to limited information in these 
reports. Review of the post-marketing reports did not identify any new safety risks for the marketed 
upadacitinib in treating patients with moderately to severely active RA. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Extent of exposure and overview of adverse events  
A total of 182 AS subjects received ≥ 1 dose of upadacitinib 15 mg and up to the data cut-off date, 
160 of the 182 subjects had exposure to upadacitinib for ≥ 12 months. Although the extent of 
exposure for the patient population targeted by the new indication sought is limited, it is considered 
acceptable to the CHMP as safety information can largely be extrapolated from the approved RA-
indication. This was discussed also the CHMP SA in which it was stated: “It is agreed that the safety 
experience of upadacitinib can be further supported by information from trials performed in other 
rheumatology indications i.e. RA and in PsA”. 
As stated in the Rinvoq EPAR, important observed adverse events in the RA population are infections, 
haematological disturbances, elevated liver enzymes and CPK elevations. The risk for malignancy and 
cardiovascular disorder are to be further addressed in post-authorization studies. Further, use in 
patients with severe renal impairment is listed as a safety concern in the RMP. Upadacitinib is 
contraindicated in active tuberculosis (TB) or active serious infections, severe hepatic impairment and 
pregnancy. upadacitinib should not be used during breast-feeding. 
In the 14-week placebo-controlled period, 62.4 % of the subjects in the upadacitinib group and 55.3 % 
in the placebo group had any AEs. No patients in the upadacitinib group had any severe AE and similar 
proportions of subjects in the placebo and upadacitinib groups had ≥ 1 SAEs (1.1% in each group) and 
AEs leading to discontinuation (2.2% in the upadacitinib group and 3.2% in the placebo group).  
Infections were reported by 20.4% in the upadacitinib group and 26.6% in the placebo group. The 
most frequently reported infections (≥ 2 subjects) in the upadacitinib group were nasopharyngitis, 
influenza, and tonsillitis. No serious infections were reported by any subject in this study. 
In the placebo-controlled period, the most frequently reported TEAEs (≥ 5% of subjects) in the 
upadacitinib group were increased blood CPK, diarrhea, nasopharyngitis, and headache compared with 
diarrhea and nausea in the placebo group.  The frequencies of CPK increased and ALT increased were 
8.6% and 4.3%, respectively, in the upadacitinib group compared with 2.1% for each event in the 
placebo group.   
In the long-term data up to the data cut-off date, 618 AEs (260.1 events [E]/100 PYs) were reported 
in 182 subjects (237.6 patient-years [PYs]) who received upadacitinib 15mg QD. Seven (7) severe AEs 
(2.9E/100 PYs), 14 SAEs (5.9E/100 PYs) and 15 AEs (6.3E/100 PYs) leading to discontinuation were 
reported.  No deaths were reported. 
For comparison, it can be noted that according to the Rinvoq EPAR, in the short-term placebo-
controlled safety set in the development programme for RA, the frequency for infections and 
Assessment report  
EMA/708068/2020  
Page 74/94 
 
 
 
infestations was 27.2% in the upadacitinib 15 mg group and 20.6% in the placebo group. According to 
the EPAR, in both the short-term and long-term RA datasets, adverse events were most frequently 
reported in the Infectious and Infestations SOC. The incidence of AEs for upadacitinib 15 mg 
monotherapy (over 48 weeks) was 345.4/100 PY while the incidence of serious infections for 
upadacitinib 15 mg in combination with MTX (over 48 weeks) was 4.1/100 PY. 
Adverse events of special interest 
No events in the following AESI categories were reported by any subjects in the study: serious 
infection, NMSC, lymphoma, gastrointestinal perforation, renal dysfunction, active TB, adjudicated 
MACE or adjudicated VTE.  It is noted that there were no exclusion criteria for VTE in the original 
protocol, and it is noted that the only patients with contraindication for NSAID in the study were due to 
previous VTE. In addition, 8% of the patients had latent TB.  
Opportunistic Infections 
A single subject experienced 2 episodes of non-serious esophageal candidiasis, 1 AE in each study 
period resulting in temporary interruption of study drug.  Both events resolved after treatment. 
Opportunistic infections are an identified important risk of upadacitinib treatment, and a warning in 
SmPC section 4.4 regarding this risk is included in the current product information. This is adequate 
also for the new AS indication. 
Herpes Zoster 
In the long-term data, 5 events (2.1 E/100 PYs) of herpes zoster were reported in 4 subjects, leading 
to discontinued study drug in one patient. All events were mild or moderate in severity and confined to 
a single dermatome. Herpes zoster is an identified important risk for upadacitinib treatment and is 
described in section 4.8 of the SmPC as uncommon. In addition, multidermatomal herpes zoster is 
mentioned in the section 4.4 of the SmPC. The long-term event rate of herpes zoster observed with 
upadacitinib 15 mg in the AS clinical study was not higher than that observed previously in the RA 
program (4.3 E/100 PYs).   
Malignancy 
One malignancy (0.4 E/100 PYs), a SAE of squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, was observed. The 
AE was reported in a former smoker who had < 5 months exposure to upadacitinib. The AE was 
assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug. Malignancies are safety 
concerns included in the RMP and also included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. This is adequate also for 
the AS population. 
Hepatic Disorders 
In the placebo-controlled period of the AS study, the proportion of subjects with AEs of hepatic 
disorders was greater in the upadacitinib group than the placebo group (5.4% versus 2.1%). The 
hepatic disorders in these subjects were all asymptomatic alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) increased or hepatic enzymes increased.  None of the events led to 
discontinuation of study drug.  In the long-term data, 24 hepatic disorders (10.1 E/100 PYs) were 
reported in 15 subjects who received upadacitinib.  No report was serious, and none led to 
discontinuation of study drug. Two subjects had potentially clinically significant Grade 3 ALT/ AST 
increases but both ALT and AST values decreased to normal ranges or Baseline levels without study 
drug discontinuation. In both cases there were confounding factors (co-medication, alcohol). 
Increases in ALT and AST are listed as common ADRs (corresponds to ≥ 1/100 to <1/10) in the current 
product information. According to the Rinvoq EPAR, in the previous studies in RA programme, 
upadacitinib 15 mg was associated with a small (about 5 U/L) increase in mean ALT and AST levels in 
Assessment report  
EMA/708068/2020  
Page 75/94 
 
 
 
short-term analyses, and ALT increases of 5*ULN or greater were seen in about 1.5% of subjects 
compared to less than 0.5% of subjects on placebo. This small increase persisted on long-term 
treatment. Two subjects in the long-term “Any Ph 3 UPA 15” analysis set met biochemical criteria for 
Hy’s Law, but both subjects had alternative aetiologies (malignant melanoma, and concomitant use of 
INH). In the long-term Any Ph 3 UPA 15 analysis set, the exposure-adjusted event rate (EAER) of 
treatment-emergent hepatic disorders was 14.4 E/100 PY, most events being transaminase elevations. 
Elevations were usually asymptomatic and transient even in the setting of continued treatment; the 
EAER of hepatic disorders leading to study drug discontinuation was 0.8 E/100 PY. 
Overall, the nature and severity of ALT and AST elevations observed with upadacitinib 15 mg in the AS 
patient population appear broadly similar to that reported previously in the RA programme.  Due to the 
observation of transaminase elevations with upadacitinib treatment, potential for drug induced liver 
injury remains an important potential risk for upadacitinib. Section 4.4 of the SmPC describes the 
effect of upadacitinib on transaminases and advices the prescriber on how to proceed in cases of liver 
enzyme elevation. This is considered relevant also for the new indication that this application targets. 
Anemia 
In the Exposure-response analysis submitted with this application, it was noted that with increasing 
upadacitinib exposures, a relationship was found in the percentage of patients experiencing decreases 
in haemoglobin of ≥ 1 g/dL from baseline. This is consistent with information from the RA population 
from the Rinvoq EPAR, in which it is stated that overall there was very little effect on mean 
haemoglobin with the 15 mg dosage of upadacitinib but the 30 mg dosage did induce a more 
observable decrease in haemoglobin.  
Reassuringly, judging from the provided clinical safety data, also in the AS population, the 15 mg dose 
seemed to be associated with very limited influence on Hb. No AE of anemia was reported in the 
placebo-controlled period.  At Week 14, mean changes from Baseline in hemoglobin were minimal for 
the upadacitinib (0.1 g/L) and placebo groups (–0.2 g/L). In the long-term data, 3 events (1.3 E/100 
PYs) of anemia were reported.  No event was serious, severe, or led to study drug discontinuation.  
Through Week 64, mean hemoglobin values were essentially unchanged in subjects who received 
upadacitinib.  
The current SmPC text, including the recommendations for dose interruption of upadacitinib for low 
hemoglobin is considered appropriate also for the new AS indication. 
Lymphopenia 
In the placebo-controlled period, no AE of lymphopenia was reported.  At Week 14, a numerically 
greater mean increase from Baseline in lymphocyte count was observed in subjects in the upadacitinib 
group vs the placebo group.  In the long-term data, 2 events (0.8 E/100PYs) of lymphopenia were 
reported.  Neither event was serious, severe, or led to study drug discontinuation. Overall, lymphocyte 
mean changes from Baseline were small in subjects receiving upadacitinib through Week 64, and 
lymphocyte values tended to fluctuate between increases and decreases. No subject had a post-
Baseline Grade ≥ 3 lymphocyte count decrease. Recommendation for dose interruption of upadacitinib 
for low absolute lymphocyte count is provided in the current product information which is considered 
adequate also for the new AS indication. 
Neutropenia 
In the placebo-controlled period, 1 AE of neutropenia (Grade 2 neutrophil count decreased) assessed 
as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug was reported in the upadacitinib 
group.  Study drug was interrupted for 5 days and re-started. A numerically greater mean decrease 
from Baseline in neutrophil count was observed in the upadacitinib group vs the placebo group at Week 
Assessment report  
EMA/708068/2020  
Page 76/94 
 
 
 
14.  In addition, a larger proportion of subjects in the upadacitinib group compared with the placebo 
had shifts from high or normal at Baseline to low post-Baseline values in neutrophil count (16.5% 
compared with 4.3%, respectively. In the long-term data, 7 (2.9 E/100 PYs) AEs of neutropenia were 
reported, the majority of these events were stated not to be associated with infections. Five 
neutropenia AEs were assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug.  Most 
events were mild, no event was serious, and no subject discontinued study drug as a result of an AE of 
neutropenia.  Neutrophil mean changes from Baseline were small through Week 64.  Two subjects 
(1.1%) experienced Grade 3 neutrophil count decreases.  
In the current SmPC, neutropenia is listed as common adverse reaction (frequency ≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) 
and it is stated that in placebo-controlled RA studies with background DMARDs, for up to 12/14 weeks, 
decreases in neutrophil counts below 1,000 cells/mm3 in at least one measurement occurred in 1.1% 
and <0.1% of patients in the upadacitinib 15 mg and placebo groups, respectively. Mean neutrophil 
counts decreased over 4 to 8 weeks. The decreases in neutrophil counts remained stable at a lower 
value than baseline over time including with extended therapy. The SmPC also includes a 
recommendation for dose interruption of upadacitinib for low absolute neutrophil count. The CHMP 
agreed that this recommendation is appropriate also for the new AS indication. 
Creatine Phosphokinase Elevation 
In the placebo-controlled period, a larger proportion of subjects who received upadacitinib (8 [8.6%] 
subjects) had AEs of CPK elevation compared with placebo (2 [2.1%] subjects). It is noted that only 
half of the events in the respective groups were according to the MAH assessed as having a reasonable 
possibility of being related to study drug (4/8 in the upadacitinib group and 1/2 in the placebo group).  
No subjects had severe events. At Week 14, subjects in the upadacitinib group had a numerically 
greater mean increase in CPK versus placebo group (upadacitinib 58.5U/L vs placebo –57.8 U/L).  A 
Grade 3 (> 5 – 10 × ULN) increased CPK value was reported in 1(1.1%) subject in each of the placebo 
and upadacitinib groups.  
In the long-term data, 28 AEs of CPK elevation (11.8 E/100 PYs), none severe, were reported in 23 
subjects who received upadacitinib.  Sixteen events were assessed as having a reasonable possibility 
of being related to study drug.  All events were non-serious, and none led to discontinuation of study 
drug. Mean CPK values increased from Baseline to Week 4 for subjects who received upadacitinib 
group and then generally stabilized through Week 64.  Most CPK elevations were <4 × ULN, and the 
majority of subjects were asymptomatic.  "Exercise or other vigorous physical activity" was reported 
by more than 50% of subjects who had increased CPK. Five (2.7%) Grade 3 and 2 (1.1%) Grade 4 
elevations were reported.  Most of the Grade3 and Grade 4 CPK elevations occurred at 1 time point 
only followed by normalization at subsequent testing.  All Grade 3 or 4 CPK elevations occurred in 
young male subjects; 86% (6 of 7) did not lead to study drug interruption or discontinuation.  Two CPK 
increases were reported as AEs.  No event of rhabdomyolysis was reported.  
According to the current SmPC, in placebo-controlled studies with background DMARDs in the RA 
population (for up to 12/14 weeks) increases in CPK values were also observed. CPK elevations > 5 x 
upper limit of normal (ULN) were reported in 1.0% and 0.3% of RA patients over 12/14 weeks in the 
upadacitinib 15 mg and placebo groups, respectively. Blood CPK increased is listed as a common 
(frequency ≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) adverse reaction in the SmPC. According to the Rinvoq EPAR, CPK 
elevations were observed in 2.8% of RA patients treated with upadacitinib 15 mg (vs 0.6% in placebo 
treated subjects, both in combination with csDMARDs) during the first 3 months. Across the five phase 
3 RA studies, the incidence of any CPK elevation was 10.1/100 PYs in the group that received 
upadacitinib 15 mg in combination with a non-MTX csDMARD and 4.8/100 PY in the group that 
received upadacitinib 15 mg in combination with MTX alone. 
Assessment report  
EMA/708068/2020  
Page 77/94 
 
 
 
The MAH believes that the predominance of males in the AS population (with males generally having 
greater muscle mass than females), may contribute to a higher rate of CPK elevations being observed 
in the AS study compared to the RA clinical programme. This might be the case but it should also be 
noted that as the estimate is based on rather few patients and events, it is expected to have a rather 
low precision, hampering the comparative conclusions that can be drawn. In any way, the 
nonseriousness of the observed events, the few events leading to study drug discontinuation and lack 
of associated symptoms indicates that this observation is not likely to pose large clinical impact. Thus, 
no further action was considered warranted by the CHMP. 
Renal Dysfunction 
No AEs of renal dysfunction were reported up to the data cut-off date.  At Week 14, subjects in the 
upadacitinib group had a numerically greater mean increase from Baseline in serum creatinine versus 
the placebo group. According to the MAH, through Week 64, minimal mean increases from Baseline in 
serum creatinine were observed for subjects receiving upadacitinib.  No Grade ≥ 3 value for creatinine 
was reported. The CHMP agreed that no update to the SmPC was required for the new AS indication. 
Other Areas of Interest 
Lipids 
Mean values for total cholesterol, HDL-C and LDL-C increased for subjects receiving upadacitinib 
through Week 64.  In the long-term data, 5.0%, 6.1%, and 15.5% of subjects had shifts from low or 
normal at Baseline to high final post-Baseline values for LDL-C, total cholesterol, and HDL-C, 
respectively.  In total, 4 (2.2%) subjects had Grade 3 and 2 (1.1%) subjects had Grade 4 triglyceride 
increases; 1 (0.5%) subject had Grade 3 increase of total cholesterol. Two nonserious events of 
hypertriglyceridemia were reported. Current advice for prescribers on the product information for 
upadacitinib in RA is to assess lipid parameters at approximately 12 weeks following initiation of 
treatment and manage patients according to applicable clinical guidelines for hyperlipidemia. The same 
advice is applicable to AS. 
Weight gain 
Eight subjects (4.4%) had decreased weight > 7% from Baseline, and 40 subjects (22.0%) 
experienced a weight increase > 7%. Weight gain is an ADR for upadacitinib and is listed in the current 
product information.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of upadacitinib in AS in the proposed posology of 15mg QD, is considered by 
the CHMP to be consistent with the safety profile in the approved RA-indication and thus covered in the 
approved SmPC and RMP (see RMP section). The MAH proposed to add a general statement in section 
4.8 of the SmPC to inform about the consistency of safety data between the indications, this statement 
was agreed on by the CHMP. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
SpA is a group of diseases that share common clinical, radiographic, and genetic features. This 
includes AS, PsA, reactive arthritis, enteropathic or IBD-related arthritis, and undifferentiated SpA. A 
more universally consistent way of categorizing SpA patients is to define them by their primary and 
predominant clinical manifestation of axial or peripheral SpA. Axial SpA encompasses a spectrum of 
disease manifestations, which has been split into two categories, AS and nr-axSpA, based on the 1984 
modified New York criteria, which require the presence of sacroiliitis on plain conventional radiographs 
for the classification of AS. AxSpA affects up to 1.4% of the Caucasian adult population worldwide.  
AxSpA is characterised by chronic inflammation of the axial skeleton (sacroiliac joint and spine), as 
well as variable involvement of the peripheral joints. As the disease progresses, it can lead to new 
bone formation in the form of syndesmophytes and joint ankylosis, primarily in the axial skeleton. 
Patients with axSpA may also have extra articular manifestations of the disease such as enthesitis, 
anterior uveitis, psoriasis (Ps), and IBD, as well as comorbidities of aortitis or cardiac conduction 
abnormalities. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In 2016, the ASAS and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) published updated treatment 
recommendations for axial SpA, and in 2019 the American College of Rheumatology/Spondylitis 
Association of America/Spondyloarthritis Research and Treatment Network (SPARTAN) published 
updated axial SpA treatment recommendations.  The first-line treatment of axial SpA consists of 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In patients with persistently high disease activity 
despite a course of two NSAIDs given over a total of at least 4 weeks, initiation of a bDMARD is 
recommended, and current practice is to start with a tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitor (TNFi).  If 
TNFi therapy fails, switching to another TNFi or an interleukin-17 inhibitor (IL-17i) is recommended. As 
pointed out by the MAH, despite recent advances in the treatment of axial SpA, there remains a 
significant unmet medical need, as only approximately 45% to 50% of patients in the studies of TNFi 
showed an ASAS40 response, and only approximately 15% to 20% achieved a state of remission.   
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The application is supported by a pivotal clinical phase 2/3 study; M16-098, which is still on-going. The 
first part of the study (Period 1) is a 14-week randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-
controlled period designed to compare the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib 15 mg once daily (QD) 
versus placebo. The second part of the study (Period 2) is a 90-week open-label, long-term extension. 
A 30-day follow-up visit was also included. 
Subjects in the study were adults with a clinical diagnosis of AS meeting the modified New York 
Criteria for AS. The subjects were to have an active disease defined by having a BASDAI score ≥ 4 and 
a Patient's Assessment of Total Back Pain score ≥ 4. In addition, they should have an inadequate 
response to at least 2 NSAIDs over an at least 4-week period in total at maximum recommended or 
tolerated doses or had an intolerance to or contraindication for NSAIDs as defined by the Investigator. 
They also had to be bDMARD naïve but could have received or be on concomitant csDMARD treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/708068/2020  
Page 87/94 
 
 
 
A total of 187 patients were randomized, 94 patients to the placebo group and 93 patients to the 
upadacitinib group. 
The primary estimand was defined as the difference in the proportion of (randomised and treated) AS 
patients who achieved ASAS 40 response at Week 14 and did not discontinue study drug by Week 14. 
ASA40 is an EMA guideline-preferred responder index which incorporates improvement in Patient 
Global Assessment, Pain Assessment, Function (BASFI) and inflammation. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
A statistically significant higher proportion (95% CI) of patients in the upadacitinib group reached 
ASAS40 at week 14 in comparison to the placebo group: 51.6 (41.6, 61.8) % vs 25.5 (16.7, 34.3) % 
(p<0.001). The difference between treatment groups seems to be observed as early as week 2. 
Results for the key secondary endpoints generally supported the outcome of the primary endpoint. 
Five of the 10 ranked, secondary endpoints showed a statistically significant better effect in the 
upadacitinib group compared to placebo, these were: changes from baseline to Week 14 in 
ASDAS(CRP), SPARCC MRI spine and BASFI and the respective proportions of subjects who had 
BASDAI50 and an ASAS partial remission at week 14.  ASDAS (CRP) and BASDAI are measures of 
disease activity while SPARCC while SPARCC is a scoring system for active inflammatory lesions 
detected by MRI and BASFI is a functional index. 
The change from baseline in ASDAS-CRP (95% CI) was -1.45 (-1.62, -1.28) in the upadacitinib group 
and -0.54 (-0.71,-0.37) in the Placebo group (p<0.001).  The change from baseline in SPARCC MRI 
spine score (95% CI) was -6.93 (-8.58, -5.28) in the Upadacitib group and -0.22 (-2.01, 1.57) in the 
Placebo group (p<0.001). The change from baseline in BASFI (95% CI) was -2.29 (-2.73, -1.85) in the 
Upadacintib group and -1.30 (-1.74,-0.86) in the Placebo group (p=0.001). The BASDAI50 response % 
(95% CI) was 45.2 (35.0, 55.3) in the upadacitinib group and 23.4 (14.8, 32.0) in the Placebo group 
(p=0.002). The ASAS partial remission % (95% CI) was 19.4 (11.3, 27.4) in the Upadacitib group and 
1.1 (0.0, 3.1) in the Placebo group (p<0.001). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Among the endpoints that failed three were PROs (ASQoL, ASAS(HI) and WPAI Overall Work 
Impairment): for ASQoL and ASAS(HI) there were numerically differences favouring upadacitinib and 
having used another multiple testing procedure, they could eventually have succeeded, at least 
statistically (nominally p= 0.016 for ASQoL and nominally p= 0.007 for ASAS(HI)). For the analysis of 
MASES and WPAI Overall Work Impairment it was considered by the CHMP that it could, at least in 
part, be a question of power and eventually an underestimation of the number of subjects that where 
to contribute with data. The issue was therefore not further pursued by CHMP.  
Although there is still an uncertainty with regards to the precise magnitude of the long-term efficacy, 
the CHMP agreed that there is support of a continued benefit of treatment with upadacitinib beyond 
week 14. 
Among the subjects that have not even achieved ASAS20 at week 16, only few additional subjects 
attain an initial ASAS20 response after this time point. Section 4.2 of the SmPC states that 
consideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients with ankylosing spondylitis who 
have shown no response after 16 weeks of treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/708068/2020

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In the placebo-controlled period, 62.4 % of the subjects in the upadacitinib group and 55.3 % in the 
placebo group had any AEs. No patients in the upadacitinib group had any severe AE and similar 
proportions of subjects in the placebo and upadacitinib groups had ≥ 1 SAEs (1.1% in each group) and 
AEs leading to discontinuation (2.2% in the upadacitinib group and 3.2% in the placebo group).  
Infections were reported by 20.4% in the upadacitinib group and 26.6% in the placebo group. The 
most frequently reported infections (≥ 2 subjects) in the upadacitinib group were nasopharyngitis, 
influenza, and tonsillitis. As of the data cut-off date, no events of serious infections were reported from 
the study. 
In the placebo-controlled period, the most frequently reported TEAEs (≥ 5% of subjects) in the 
upadacitinib group were increased blood creatine phosphokinase (CPK), diarrhea, nasopharyngitis, and 
headache compared with diarrhea and nausea in the placebo group.  The frequencies of CPK increased 
and ALT increased were 8.6% and 4.3%, respectively, in the upadacitinib group compared with 2.1% 
for each event in the placebo group. 
In the long-term data up to the data cut-off date, 618 AEs (260.1 events [E]/100 PYs) were reported 
in 182 subjects (237.6 patient-years [PYs]) who received upadacitinib 15mg QD. Seven (7) severe AEs 
(2.9E/100 PYs), 14 SAEs (5.9E/100 PYs) and 15 AEs (6.3E/100 PYs) leading to discontinuation were 
reported.  No deaths were reported. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety data base in AS is rather limited. A total of 182 subjects received ≥ 1 dose of upadacitinib 
15 mg, representing 237.6 patient years (PYs). Up to the data cut-off date, 160 of the 182 subjects 
had exposure to upadacitinib for ≥ 12 months. However, as safety data can to a large extent be 
extrapolated from the approved RA-indication, this is considered acceptable by the CHMP.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
A clinically relevant and robust effect as measured by ASAS40 has been demonstrated for upadacitinib 
15 mg in the target population of subjects with active AS and inadequate response or 
intolerance/contraindication to NSAIDs. Overall, there are support from secondary endpoints 
measuring different aspects of the disease.  
The safety findings in the AS development programme were generally consistent with the findings in 
the RA development programme and thus adequately described in the currently approved PI and RMP. 
The safety database in AS is limited; however, as safety data can to a large extent be extrapolated 
from the approved RA-indication, this is considered acceptable to the CHMP.

Page 90/94 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
No important limitations regarding the favourable effects remain. Although there is still an uncertainty 
with regards to the precise magnitude of the long-term efficacy, the CHMP agreed that there is support 
of a continued benefit of treatment with upadacitinib beyond week 14. 
The safety profile of upadacitinib in AS in the proposed posology, is considered broadly similar to the 
safety profile in the approved RA-indication and thus generally covered in the approved SmPC and 
RMP. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Rinvoq in the treatment of active ankylosing spondylitis in adult patients who have 
responded inadequately to conventional therapy is positive. 
4.  Recommendations

any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted: 
At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being 
received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to launch of RINVOQ in each Member State the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) must agree 
about the content and format of the educational programme, including communication media, 
distribution modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with the National Competent 
Authority.  
The objective of the programme is to increase awareness of HCPs and patients on the risks of serious 
and opportunistic infections including TB, herpes zoster, foetal malformation (pregnancy risk), MACE, 
and VTEs and how to manage these risks. 
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where RINVOQ is marketed, all healthcare 
professionals and patients/carers who are expected to prescribe, dispense or use RINVOQ have access 
to/are provided with the following educational package: 
The physician educational material should contain: 
• 
• 
• 
The Summary of Product Characteristics 
Guide for healthcare professionals  
Patient Alert Card (PAC) 
The Guide for healthcare professionals shall contain the following key elements: 
• 
General introductory language that the HCP measure contains important information to assist 
the discussion with patients when prescribing upadacitinib. The brochure also informs on steps which 
can be taken to reduce a patient's risk for key safety aspects of upadacitinib.

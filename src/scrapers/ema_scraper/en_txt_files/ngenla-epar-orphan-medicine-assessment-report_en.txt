COMP opinion (adoption via written

procedure) 
2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product designation in 2013 was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the proposed condition appears justified on the grounds of preliminary clinical 
data with patients affected by the condition showing normalisation of IGF-1 levels. 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 4 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made; 
the sponsor has provided satisfactory argumentation to establish that the condition is chronically 
debilitating and life-threatening due to the psychosocial impact, the cardiovascular risk, and risk of 
decreased bone mass and fractures; 
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the European 
Union, sufficient justification has been provided that recombinant modified human growth hormone 
may be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. This appears justified on the 
grounds of improved pharmacokinetic properties that may allow for a less frequent administration 
compared to currently authorised products. This would constitute a major contribution to patient 
care, and is supported by preliminary clinical data that show a once-weekly administration 
potential. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation 
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
The designated condition included both, paediatric and adult forms of growth hormone deficiencies 
(GHD) and is still acceptable as an orphan condition. 
GHD is a consequence of deficient or insufficient growth hormone secretion that is generally associated 
with defects in the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus. In the paediatric population GHD is primarily 
idiopathic, whereas in the adult population GHD more often is caused by tumours in the central 
nervous system, cranial irradiation, head trauma or organic causes. GHD in children is characterised by 
a diminished growth velocity and a markedly reduced final adult height compared to that predicted 
(Rosenfeld et al, 2001). In addition to profound growth failure, children with GHD develop the same 
physiological and cognitive abnormalities as the adult population. GHD may be present already at birth 
but is generally first discovered within the first years of childhood.  
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
Page 4/11 
 
 
 
 
 
Adult growth hormone deficiency (AGHD) is characterised by several clinical features that comprises 
general health and quality of life. If left untreated, AGHD is associated with increased body fat, 
decreased lean body mass, reduced bone mineral density, disturbed lipoprotein metabolism, reduced 
exercise capacity, increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and decreased cognition 
and psychological well-being (Alexopoulou et al, 2010; Molitch et al, 2011).  
The approved therapeutic indication “Ngenla is indicated for the treatment of children and adolescents 
from 3 years of age with growth disturbance due to insufficient secretion of growth hormone” falls 
within the scope of the designated orphan condition “Treatment of Growth hormone deficiency”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP. 
Clinical efficacy of somatrogon investigated in support of the treatment in paediatric patients with 
growth hormone deficiency (GHD) was evaluated in one Phase 2 dose-finding study ( CP-4-004 + 
OLE), a pivotal Phase 3 study (CP-4-006 +OLE) and an additional phase 3 patient preference study 
C0311002).  
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
No change in the chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature of the condition has been 
reported since the designation of the orphan medicinal product.  
The condition is associated with a wide range of neuropsychiatric, cognitive, cardiac, metabolic, 
muscular, and bone symptoms. GHD in children is characterised by a diminished growth velocity and a 
markedly reduced final adult height compared to that predicted (Rosenfeld et al, 2001). In addition to 
profound growth failure, children with GHD develop the same physiological and cognitive abnormalities 
as the adult population. If left untreated, AGHD is associated with increased body fat, decreased lean 
body mass, reduced bone mineral density, disturbed lipoprotein metabolism, reduced exercise 
capacity, increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and decreased cognition and 
psychological well-being (Alexopoulou et al, 2010; Molitch et al, 2011).  
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor contracted with an external company to replicate the literature search conducted for the 
original orphan designation application (ODA), and identify any new published literature since that 
application or any prior published literature that was not included with the original ODA. 
The literature search review on the incidence and/or prevalence of GHD identified 2 additional studies 
published since the ODA was submitted in August 2012. The literature search also identified 3 studies 
published prior to the ODA in 2012 that had the potential to be included, however only 2 of the 3 
studies were included. The study from Audi et al, 2002, was excluded as it included aetiologies that, 
according to the sponsor, were not proven as validated GHD. 
The point prevalence estimate at the end of the study period was 3.75 per 10,000 among all 
hypopituitary cases in the Fernandez-Rodriguez, 2013 article. As only a subset (~60%) had GH 
deficiency, the sponsor re-calculated the prevalence to include all 126 cases of GHD as the numerator 
among the 405,208 subjects reported at risk in the study denominator, which results in a prevalence 
of 3.11 per 10,000. 
For the database review at the Children’s Hospital at Helsinki University in Finland during 2015–2020 
(Karkinen et al, 2020) the prevalence of GHD was not reported directly. Therefore, assumptions were 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
Page 5/11 
 
 
 
 
 
made in order to calculate a prevalence estimate based on the available data in the study and that of 
the population of Finland. The conclusion was 0.74 per 10,000, which is line with the range of 
estimates from other childhood GHD studies. 
With regards to the Migliaretti et al, 2006 article a prevalence of a treated prevalence rate of 9.44 per 
10,000, was reported. However, in order to sum the childhood and adult GHD prevalence estimates, 
the population at risk for this study was required to be re-calculated based on the total population of 
area of investigation (Piedmont, Italy) during the study period. Re-calculating the treated prevalence 
based on the new denominator, the treated prevalence was estimated as 598 GHD cases per 
4,271,733 persons, or 1.40 per 10,000 for this study. The sponsor still considers this figure an outlier 
but could be due to the case definition and diagnostic criteria used for GHD in Italy at the time of the 
study. 
The sponsor applied pooled mean estimates by GHD subpopulation which was then summed to obtain 
the total GHD prevalence. For estimates of prevalence derived from incidence, a treatment duration of 
10 years was used for conversion to prevalence for childhood GDA prevalence estimates, and a 
treatment duration of 25 years was used for conversion to prevalence for adult GDA prevalence 
estimates.

The sponsor concludes on a prevalence of 4.6 in 10,000. This is slightly less than what has been used 
in recent designations and marketing authorisations, however the difference is due to adjusted figures 
in order to reflect only the GHD patients reported in the studies as well as a correction with regards to 
the general population in the area the study was made. This results in somewhat lower figures. It 
cannot be ascertained that the adjustments the sponsor has done are entirely correct, but they seem 
plausible and therefore the adjustment could be warranted and therefore the COMP accepted the 
proposed prevalence of 4.6 in 10,000. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
The standard treatment for patients with GHD (children and adults) in the EU is daily, s.c. injection 
with recombinant hGH (somatropin). The sponsor provided a list of current approved products for daily 
administration in the EU for treatment of GHD in children and adults, all of which contain somatropin 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
Page 7/11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
  
  
  
  
as active ingredient. They also include the recently authorised long acting somatropin Sogroya 
(somapacitan) which is approved for “replacement of endogenous growth hormone (GH) in adults with 
growth hormone deficiency (AGHD)”. 
Lonapegsomatropin Ascendis Pharma recently received a positive CHMP opinion for the treatment of 
growth failure in children and adolescents aged from 3 years up to 18 years due to insufficient 
endogenous growth hormone secretion (growth hormone deficiency [GHD]). However, this product has 
not yet received the EC decision and is therefore not considered authorised.  
The daily administered somatropin products are generally authorised for children which is the target 
patient population for Ngenla. Therefore, they are considered as satisfactory methods and a significant 
benefit will have to be justified. 
Sogroya, on the other hand is only approved for adults and therefore Sogroya is not considered a 
satisfactory method for treatment of children with GHD.  
Significant benefit 
The original sponsor of the orphan designation asked for scientific advice in 2016 in relation to the 
clinical development as well as the study designed to evaluate the patient preferences. The sponsor 
seems to have implemented the advice in the study design.  
As somatrogon is non-inferior to Genotropin in the treatment of paediatric GHD patients who have or 
have not received prior growth hormone treatment, the sponsor bases the justification of significant 
benefit on a major contribution to patient care.  
Following receipt of the above advice, a new clinical outcome assessment tool called the Dyad Clinical 
Outcome Assessment (DCOA) was developed by Pfizer (also referred to as the Life Interference 
Questionnaire for Growth Hormone Deficiency [LIQ-GHD] (Turner-Bowker et al, 2020). Briefly, the 
DCOA contains several modules, intended to be completed by the patient, the caregiver, or the patient 
and caregiver together (as a “dyad”). The content is organized into 2 main sections, referred as DCOA 
1 and DCOA 2. 
C0311002 was a randomized, open-label, multi-center, 2-period crossover study in children 3 to 
<18 years of age with GHD. Subjects had been on stable treatment with an rhGH injection 
administered once daily (ie, either Genotropin® Pen® or Genotropin® GoQuick Pen,® HumatroPen®, or 
Omnitrope® Pen) for at least 3 months prior to enrollment. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 
one of  2 sequences, either 12 weeks of treatment with daily Genotropin followed by 12 weeks of 
treatment with once weekly Somatrogon (Sequence 1), or 12 weeks of treatment with once weekly 
somatrogon followed by 12 weeks of treatment with daily Genotropin (Sequence 2), for a total 
treatment duration of 24 weeks.

Figure 1.  C0311002 Study Design 
The primary endpoint in Study C0311002, treatment burden, was assessed as the difference in mean 
Overall Life Interference total scores between the weekly injection schedule and daily injection 
schedule as assessed by the Patient Life Interference Questionnaire. Of the 87 participants that were 
randomized, 43 were randomized to the Genotropin then somatrogon sequence and 44 were 
randomized to the somatrogon then Genotropin sequence. 
The study met its primary endpoint and the treatment burden as assessed by the Overall Life 
Interference total score was lower for the once weekly somatrogon injection schedule than for the once 
daily Genotropin injection schedule. See table 5 from sponsors application.

difference/no preference between injection schedules for most variables within the DCOA 2 
questionnaire. 
The assumption of significant benefit of Ngenla on basis of major contribution to patient care still 
holds. 
4.  COMP position adopted on 21 December 2021 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product. 
the prevalence of growth hormone deficiency (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was 
estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be 4.6 in 10,000 persons in the 
European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to psychosocial problems linked to the short stature, 
abdominal obesity, reduced bone mass with increased risk of developing osteopenia, osteoporosis 
and bone fractures. In children the condition can cause episodes of hypoglycaemia and delayed 
puberty. Adults are in addition affected by decreased lean body mass, reduced muscle strength 
and exercise capacity. The condition can be life-threatening with a twofold excess in overall 
mortality compared to the general population; 
• 
although satisfactory methods for the treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union, the assumption that Ngenla may be of potential significant benefit to those 
affected by the orphan condition still holds. The sponsor provided data from clinical trials 
demonstrating that somatrogon (once weekly growth hormone) and somatropin (once daily growth 
hormone) are of comparable efficacy. In addition, treatment satisfaction data from a specifically 
designed study demonstrated that the treatment burden for patients and carers was reduced for 
somatrogon as compared to the somatropin control. This was considered acceptable in support of a 
major contribution to patient care. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Ngenla, recombinant modified 
human growth hormone, somatrogon for treatment of growth hormone deficiency (EU/3/12/1087) is 
not removed from the Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

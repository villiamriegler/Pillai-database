Pursuant to Article 7.2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH 
submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 9 August 2023 an application for a group of 
variations. 
The following changes were proposed:

Grouped application comprising two type II variations as follows: 
C.I.4 – Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC in order to update the safety information based on interim 
(6 months post-dose 3 in 12-15 years old) and final results from study C4591001, listed as a category 
3 study in the RMP. This is a phase 1/2/3, placebo-controlled, randomised, observer-blind, dose-
finding study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and efficacy of COMIRNATY against 
COVID-19 in healthy individuals.  
C.I.11.b - Submission of an updated RMP version 10.1 in order to revise RMP milestones of final study 
reports of other on-going procedures, including other administrative and editorial changes.  
The requested group of variations proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics 
and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
Within this type II variation, the MAH has submitted the final data from the clinical study C4591001, 
listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. Safety interim data to support a proposed update in section 
4.8 in the SmPC for adolescents aged 12-15 years who had received one booster dose of BNT162b2 
30µg has also been provided. 
Efficacy 
Study C4591001 was a phase 1/2/3 multicentre, multinational, randomised, placebo-controlled, 
observer-blind, dose finding, vaccine candidate-selection, and efficacy study in healthy individuals ≥12 
years of age. The study population included more than 40,000 individuals. Participants received 2 
doses of Original Comirnaty 30 µg and were followed up for up to 2 years post-dose 2. Originally, the 
study had an active arm and a placebo arm, but after the approval of the vaccine, the participants in 
the placebo arm were offered vaccination, resulting in a cross-over arm. The study continued with 
options to receive booster doses with the Original vaccine (3rd and 4th dose). The participants gave 3-5 
blood samples to monitor for seroconversion after possible infection (N-antigen antibody detection). 
In the current final report, the MAH presented data from asymptomatic infection surveillance (in 
population without and with evidence of SARS-CoV-2 prior infection), the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/446369/2023  
Page 4/88 
 
 
 
during entire study period and also an immunogenicity analysis of a third dose of BNT162b2 at a lower 
dose of 5 or 10 µg administered to smaller population (N= 80) of Phase 2/3 participants. 
The asymptomatic infection surveillance was performed using two distinct biomarkers: nucleic acid 
amplification test (NAAT) in a subpopulation (N=4,000) and N-protein detections in the entire 
population (N=40,000). The NAAT surveillance included several uncertainties as the time window to 
detect viral RNA is limited, especially if the infection is asymptomatic. Also, the surveillance for 
asymptomatic infections did not start immediately after vaccination but started 2.9 months post-dose 
2 in the United States (USA) and 5.3 months post-dose 2 in Argentina. There were only 44 
asymptomatic cases accrued from 3,921 previously uninfected individuals, showing that asymptomatic 
cases were rather rare or have been missed. The vaccine efficacy (VE) result based on a such testing 
gave very wide confidence interval (CI), showing the uncertainty, VE= 37.2% (95% CI -20.0%; 
66.7%). Among the small population of previously infected individuals, a high rate of asymptomatic 
cases were detected (45 out of 210). Despite the low numbers, the data showed better protection 
against asymptomatic infections for participants who have been infected before vaccination compared 
to the earlier infected but unvaccinated participants VE = 70.8% (95% CI: 39.7%; 87.1%).  
N-protein specific antibodies were stable, long-lasting markers for natural SARS-CoV-2 infection 
regardless of the virus strain. The entire study population was sampled for blood after at least 1 and 6 
months post-dose 2 and tested for the seroconversion to N-protein. This analysis showed that 
Comirnaty Original 30 µg provided protection against asymptomatic infections after 2 doses during the 
study period: VE = 52.9% (95% CI: 47.2%; 57.9%). As this biomarker is trustable and the study 
population was very large, it can be concluded that 2 doses of Original Comirnaty provided protection 
against asymptomatic infections. 
The MAH presented also the final data of incidence of SARS-CoV-2 during entire study period. This 
result illustrated the VE over the 2 years of pandemic, where different new SARS-CoV-2 strains 
evolved in a short time window. The complete incidence rate (IR)/1000 person-years (PY) was 104.6 
for active arm, 125.7 for placebo arm and 169.1 for placebo cross-over arm. The Original Comirnaty 
was very effective in the beginning of the pandemic. After the authorisation, the placebo arm was 
offered vaccination and became a cross-over arm. The active arm was offered more doses as the study 
continued with booster doses. The cross-over arm also received boosters, but with at a later time point 
and therefore had received fewer doses than the original active arm every time a new strain appeared. 
Thus, the results are not easily interpretable but are in agreement with waning protection to new 
variants. 
The MAH also submitted immunogenicity results for a lower booster dose (Dose 3) of Original 
Comirnaty (5 or 10 µg).  Lower booster doses of BNT162b2 substantially increased SARS-CoV-2 
neutralising antibody response 1 month after Dose 3. Although there was no contemporaneous 30-µg 
comparator, the data presented showed that a higher booster dose of Original Comirnaty elicits a 
higher NA titre (geometric mean fold ratio - GMFR 30-µg = 17; 10-µg= 12; 5-µg= 11 for > 55 yoa). 
Therefore the usage of 30-µg for booster was considered adequate. 
In conclusion, the current results show that 2 doses of Original Comirnaty provided protection against 
asymptomatic infections, and that also lower doses of Original Comirnaty have boosting effect for 
adults, but the chosen 30-µg is more immunogenic. 
No changes to the section 5.1 in the SmPC were suggested and this was agreed by CHMP. 
Safety 
Phase 1 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/446369/2023  
Page 5/88 
 
 
 
In the Phase 1 study, primary series of BNT162b1 (10, 20, 30, 100 µg) and BNT162b2 (10, 20, 30 µg) 
was administered to subgroups including 24 adult participants in each group (total n=195). Most of 
these participants then received one booster dose of BNT162b2 (30 μg), and an additional booster 
dose was administered to about half of the study population. After both booster doses, most of the 
reported adverse events (AEs) were related to reactogenicity and in line with what has previously been 
observed for the primary series. 
Phase 2/3 
Phase 2/3 study C4591001 included a total of 46,406 participants aged ≥12 years, of which 99.8% 
received the two doses included in the primary series of BNT162b2 30µg. The age ranged from 13-92 
years, with a median age of 51 years. A total number of 23,406 participants in the Phase 2/3 study 
received a first booster dose 6-15 months after Dose 2. The median follow-up time after booster dose 
was 12,3 months.  
From the first booster dose up to one month after the first booster dose of BNT162b2 30 µg, the 
frequency of any AEs was 17% (n=3,818) among the participants ≥16 years of age, many of them 
were considered related to study vaccine (15% [n=3,377]) and most of them were reactogenicity 
events.  
One severe event of angioedema which was considered related to the booster dose was reported. The 
event occurred one day after the booster dose and resolved after two days. Angioedema is already 
listed as an adverse reaction in the SmPC at the frequency uncommon. 
One adolescent participant reported one serious adverse event (SAE) of myocarditis 4 days after he 
received the booster dose. The event resolved within 101 days. Myocarditis is already listed in sections 
4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Booster dose BA.1 
BNT162b2-naïve adult participants (n=330) received a dose of the variant vaccine BNT162b2SA (South 
Africa B.1.351). Among the BNT162b2-naïve participants that received a dose of BNT162b2SA, the 
reported AES was mostly related to reactogenicity.  
Low dose booster dose BNT162b2 at 5 or 10 µg 
According to protocol amendment 14 and 15, adult participants that had already received the primary 
series of BNT162b2 30 µg were randomised to receive one low dose booster of BNT162b2 at 5 µg 
(n=79) or 10 µg (76). None of the participants that received BNT162b2 5 µg reported fever. There was 
a tendency to lower reactogenicity with lower dose and lower reactogenicity in participants aged >55 
years compared to participants aged 18-54 years.   
Additional booster dose, protocol amendment 19 
Among the participants (N=467) that received a second booster dose of either BNT162b2 at 5 µg 
(n=33), 10 µg (n=38), 30 µg (n=182) or BNT162b2SA 30 µg (n=211), a higher frequency of any AEs 
was noted among the participants that received 30 µg (7-9%) compared with those who received low 
dose i.e., 5 or 10 µg (0-3%). The most reported events were typical for reactogenicity.   
Participants 12-15 years of age 
In the Phase 2/3 study that included 825 participants aged 12-15 years, the median age was 14 years. 
The median follow-up time after first booster dose was 9.5 months and from Dose 2, 18.1 months. The 
median time from Dose 2 to booster dose was 11.2 months (range 6.3-20.1 months).   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/446369/2023  
Page 6/88 
 
 
 
After the booster dose up to one month after the vaccination, 18% of the participants reported any 
AEs. Most of these AEs were reactogenicity events (general disorders and administration site 
conditions and headache) and were considered related to vaccination. Two events of lymphadenopathy 
were reported, lymphadenopathy is already listed as an adverse reaction in the SmPC. Two events of 
immediate AEs were reported: fatigue and injection site pain. Three events of severe pyrexia were 
reported. From Dose 3 and up to the cut-off date (3 Nov 2022), SAEs were reported by 6 participants 
(depression/worsening of depression and suicidal ideation/suicidal attempt, pectus excavatum, elbow 
fracture and skull fracture), none of the events were considered related to vaccination. No participants 
were withdrawn due to AEs. 
The results presented for participants aged 12-15 years supported the proposed update of section 4.8 
of the SmPC.  
No new safety concerns were detected among the participants that received one or two booster doses 
of BNT162b2 30µg. 
The benefit-risk balance of COMIRNATY, remains positive.

5.  Introduction 
This report includes final data from the clinical study C4591001, listed as a category 3 study in the 
RMP. Safety interim data to support a proposed update in section 4.8 in the SmPC for adolescents 
aged 12-15 years has also been provided. No changes to the section 5.1 in the SmPC is suggested. 
Study C4591001 is a Phase 1/2/3 multicentre, multinational, randomised, placebo-controlled, 
observer-blind, dose finding, vaccine candidate-selection, and efficacy study in healthy individuals ≥12 
years of age. The study consisted of 2 parts: Phase 1 to identify preferred vaccine candidate(s) and 
dose level(s) in individuals 18 through 55 and 65 through 85 years of age; and Phase 2/3 as an 
expanded cohort and efficacy part in individuals ≥12 years of age. These parts and the progression 
between them, are illustrated in Figure 1 below.

Unblinding Considerations 
The study was unblinded in stages once all ongoing participants either had been individually unblinded 
or had concluded their 6-month post–Dose 2 study visit, in the following sequence: 
• 
• 
• 
Phase 1 (after Visit 8 [6-month post–Dose 2 visit]). 
Phase 2/3, ≥16 years of age (after Visit 4 [6-month post–Dose 2 visit]). 
Phase 3, 12 through 15 years of age (after Visit 4 [6-month post–Dose 2 visit]). 
•  Original Phase 3 participants rerandomised to assess boostability and protection against emerging 
VOCs (after Visit 306).

Data for BNT162b2 at lower dose

Efficacy Against Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection 
VE against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was evaluated in 2 ways: through impact on Nucleic 
Acid Amplification Test (NAAT)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and impact on seroconversion of N-
binding antibody in originally enrolled Phase 2/3 participants not suffering from COVID-19. Data from 
participants who receive more than 2 doses of BNT162b2 were not included after they receive a third 
dose.  
The incidence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in participants per 1000 person-years based on 
N-binding antibody seroconversion and central laboratory-confirmed NAAT was assessed to evaluate 
the asymptomatic efficacy of BNT162b2. In addition, the incidence of confirmed COVID-19 per 1000 
person-years of follow-up through the entire study follow-up period was assessed for participants who 
received BNT162b2 at initial randomisation or subsequently. The assessments included a nasal 
(midturbinate) swab, which was tested at a central laboratory using an RT-PCR test, or other 
equivalent nucleic acid amplification– based test (i.e., NAAT), to detect SARS-CoV-2. In addition, 
clinical information and results from local standard-of-care tests were assessed. The central laboratory 
NAAT result was used for the case definition, unless no result was available from the central 
laboratory, in which case a local NAAT result could be used in the COVID-19 case definition. 
Asymptomatic Efficacy and Incidence of Confirmed COVID-19 
NAAT-Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 Infection 
For participants who consented to participate in an intensive period of surveillance, nasal swabs were 
obtained to assess SARS-CoV-2 infection by NAAT. 
An asymptomatic case of NAAT-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined as a positive NAAT result 
on a nasal swab collected during the surveillance period from participants without COVID-19 
symptoms at the time the nasal swab was taken, or within 14 days after it. The onset date of the 
asymptomatic case is the collection date of the first nasal swab that tested positive. 
Seroconversion of N-Binding Antibody 
Blood samples for assessment of N-binding antibodies were drawn at multiple scheduled visits. An 
asymptomatic case of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on seroconversion of N-binding antibody was 
defined as positive N-binding antibody at a post–Dose 2 visit in participants without serological 
evidence of infection (determined by negative N-binding antibody) at Visit 1 or virological evidence of 
infection (determined by negative NAAT result at Visit 1 and Visit 2, and at the time of a potential 
COVID-19 illness). The requirement for a negative NAAT result at Visit 2 was to focus on assessment 
of protection against asymptomatic infection after 2 doses of vaccine, to the extent possible in an 
analysis based on 
seroconversion of N-binding antibody, recognizing that it was not possible to identify and exclude all 
asymptomatic infections that occur after Dose 1 and prior to Dose 2.   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/446369/2023  
Page 13/88 
 
 
 
 
A secondary definition will be applied without the requirement for a negative NAAT result at Visit 2 to 
allow assessment of protection after 1 dose of vaccine. A positive N-binding antibody at a 
postvaccination visit in participants with negative N-binding antibody at Visit 1 and negative NAAT 
results at Visit 1 and at the time of a potential COVID-19 illness is considered an asymptomatic case.

In total, 4361 participants participated in the asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection surveillance period 
with the proportions of participants included in the efficacy populations similar in both vaccine groups. 
For participants who were excluded from the evaluable efficacy population, the most common reason 
was because participants did not receive all vaccinations as randomised or did not receive Dose 2 
within the predefined window (19 to 42 days after Dose 1). Among the 4258 participants included in 
the evaluable efficacy population, 3921 participants (89.9%) had no evidence of infection prior to the 
start of the asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection surveillance period.

Vaccine Efficacy in Participants Without Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 Infection 
For the secondary efficacy endpoint, VE for BNT162b2 30 µg (2-dose primary series) against 
asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was evaluated in participants without evidence of infection up to 
the start of the asymptomatic surveillance period (January 2021). Note that the median time between 
Dose 2 and the start of the asymptomatic surveillance period was 2.9 months for participants in the 
United States and 5.3 months for participants in Argentina. Cases were counted from the start of the 
asymptomatic surveillance period. 
Among participants included in the evaluable efficacy (asymptomatic surveillance) population, 3921 
participants (2092 in BNT162b2 group and 1829 in placebo group) did not have evidence of infection 
with SARS-CoV-2 prior to the start of the asymptomatic surveillance period. There were 
24 asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in the BNT162b2 (30 µg) group compared to 20 infections 
reported in the placebo group. The estimated VE was 37.2% (2-sided 95% CI: -20.0%, 66.7%). This 
descriptive analysis was limited by the accrual of only 44 cases total, resulting in a wide 2-sided 95% 
CI and limiting the precision of this estimate. 
VE against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was 40.4% (2-sided 95% CI: -10.8%, 67.8%) for 
Dose 2 all-available efficacy population. 
Table 4: Vaccine Efficacy – Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection Based on Central 
Laboratory–Confirmed NAAT Result – Subjects Without Evidence of Infection Prior to the 
Start of the Asymptomatic Surveillance Period – Evaluable Efficacy (Asymptomatic 
Surveillance) Population 
Assessor´s comment: in comparison to the entire study population, the NAAT tested population was 
about 10 times smaller. The time window to detect viral DNA is limited, especially if the infection is 
asymptomatic. Also, the surveillance for asymptomatic infections did not start immediately after the 
vaccination. The median time between Dose 2 and the start of the asymptomatic surveillance period 
was 2.9 months for participants in the United States and 5.3 months for participants in Argentina. 
Cases were counted from the start of the asymptomatic surveillance period. Therefore the current 
testing involves uncertainty. The person might be just a carrier or the infection might be cleared by 
immune system before any symptoms appeared. There were only 44 asymptomatic cases accrued 
from 3921 individuals, showing that asymptomatic cases are rather rare or have been missed. The VE 
result based on such testing gave very wide CI, showing the uncertainty. Therefore we cannot

conclude that vaccination protected from carrying the infection without symptoms from this NAAT 
based analysis.  
Vaccine Efficacy in Participants With Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 Infection 
For the exploratory efficacy endpoint, VE for BNT162b2 30 µg (2-dose primary series) against 
asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was evaluated in participants with evidence of infection up to the 
start of the asymptomatic surveillance period. Cases were counted from the start of the asymptomatic 
surveillance period., 
Among participants included in the evaluable efficacy (asymptomatic surveillance) population, 213 
participants (80 in BNT162b2 group and 133 in placebo group) had evidence of infection with SARS-
CoV-2 prior to the start of the asymptomatic surveillance period. There were 10 asymptomatic SARS-
CoV-2 infections in the BNT162b2 (30 µg) group compared to 35 infections reported in the placebo 
group. The estimated VE was 70.8% (2-sided 95% CI: 39.7%, 87.1%) for BNT162b2. This descriptive 
analysis was limited by the accrual of only 45 infections total, resulting in a wide 2-sided 95% CI and 
limiting the precision of this estimate. 
VE of BNT162b2 for the same efficacy endpoint based on the Dose 2 all-available efficacy population 
was 65.6% (2-sided 95% CI: 32.3%, 83.7%).

Laboratory–Confirmed NAAT Result – Subjects With Evidence of Infection Prior to the Start 
of the Asymptomatic Surveillance Period – Evaluable Efficacy (Asymptomatic Surveillance) 
Population 
Assessor´s comment: A rather high proportion of asymptomatic cases were detected in this small 
population (45/210). This implicates that Sars-Cov-19 experienced subjects are less likely to develop 
symptoms during a subsequent infection compared to the first infection. Anyhow, despite of the low 
numbers, the data shows better protection against asymptomatic infections for subjects who have 
been infected before vaccination compared to the previously infected but not vaccinated subjects. This 
phenomenon is described earlier in observational studies, where previous infection in combination with 
vaccination gave a broader protection against new strains than only infection or only vaccination.

Vaccine Efficacy Against Non-S-Seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 
Asymptomatic Infection Based on N-Binding Antibody Seroconversion 
Efficacy Population 
The proportions of participants included in the efficacy populations were similar in both vaccine groups. 
For participants who were excluded from the evaluable efficacy population, the most common reason 
was because participants did not receive all vaccinations as randomised or did not receive Dose 2 
within the predefined window (19 to 42 days after Dose 1), followed by the reason of not having N-
binding test result at any post–Dose 2 visit. Among the 44,101 participants included in the evaluable 
efficacy population, 41,564 participants (90%) had no evidence of infection prior to the first post–Dose 
2 N-binding test.

VE against non-S-seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 infection Result 
For the secondary efficacy endpoint, VE for BNT162b2 30 µg (2-dose primary series) against non-S-
seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 infection was evaluated in participants without evidence of infection or 
confirmed COVID-19.  Note that the surveillance time in the placebo group was shorter than in the 
BNT162b2 group and accounted for in the VE calculations. This difference is due to the placebo 
crossover resulting in a shorter duration of follow up for participants who originally received placebo. 
Among participants included in the evaluable efficacy (seroconversion) population, 41564 participants 
(20872 in BNT162b2 group and 20692 in placebo group) did not have evidence of infection with SARS-
CoV-2 prior to the first post–dose 2 N-binding test. There were 612 cases of seroconversion of N-
binding antibody, indicative of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in the BNT162b2 (30 µg) group compared to 608 
cases in the placebo group. The estimated VE was 52.9% (2-sided 95% CI: 47.2%, 57.9%) for 
BNT162b2. 
VE of BNT162b2 for the same efficacy endpoint based on the Dose 1 and Dose 2 all-available efficacy 
populations was 49.7% (2-sided 95% CI: 44.0%, 54.9%) and 52.3% (2-sided 95% CI: 46.7%, 
57.3%), respectively. 
Table 8: Vaccine Efficacy – Asymptomatic Infection Based on N-Binding Antibody 
Seroconversion – Subjects Without Evidence of Infection Prior to the First  Post–Dose 2 N-
Binding Test – Evaluable Efficacy (Seroconversion) Population 
In the evaluable efficacy (seroconversion) population without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, VE of 
BNT162b2 was 60.4% and 56.6% from Dose 2 to 1 month after Dose 2 and from >1 month after Dose 
2, respectively. The VE for cases confirmed after Dose 2 was 52.9% (2-sided 95% CI: 47.2%, 57.9%) 
based on 612 and 608 cases in the BNT162b2 (30 µg) and placebo groups, respectively. Note that >1 
month after Dose 2, the surveillance time in the BNT162b2 (30 µg) group (11.961 [1000 person-
years]) was more than twice the surveillance time in the placebo group (4.681 [1000 person-years]),

which is accounted for in the VE calculations; this is due to the placebo crossover resulting in truncated 
follow-up time for participants who originally received placebo. 
Table 9: Vaccine Efficacy by Time Interval – Asymptomatic Infection Based on N-Binding 
Antibody Seroconversion – Subjects Without Evidence of Infection – Evaluable Efficacy 
(Seroconversion) Population 
Assessor´s comment: An impressive number of participants (more than 40,000) have been sampled 
for blood after 1, 6, 12, and 24 months post dose 2 and tested for N- protein specific antibodies, which 
is a marker for natural SARS-CoV-2 infection regardless of the strain. The seroconversion to N-protein 
is a stable biomarker for passed SARS-CoV-2 infection and therefore this analysis gives a reliable 
estimate of infection. The follow-up time for the placebo arm was about half compared to the active 
arm, which might introduce a biased analysis. The results of the N-antibody seroconversion analysis 
indicate that Comirnaty Original 30 provided protection against asymptomatic infections after 2 doses.  
Incidence Rates of First COVID-19 Occurrence After Vaccination 
Analyses were performed for COVID-19 cases accrued for the following groups and periods: 
•  Original BNT162b2 (30 µg) group during a period when multiple SARS-CoV-2 strains were 
circulating (ie, original/wild type strain and Alpha, Beta, Delta, Gamma, Omicron variants), 
pre-dominating at various times during the period from the Dose 1 vaccination date to the 
earliest of confirmed case, death, study withdrawal, study completion date, or the participant’s 
first dose of BNT162b2SA vaccine. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/446369/2023  
Page 22/88 
 
 
 
 
•  Original placebo prior to crossover group for the time between vaccination in the blinded 
period, and the crossover date. The original/wild type was the predominant strain during this 
period. Most of the Phase 2/3 participants were unblinded (April 2021) and transitioned to the 
crossover group when the Delta variant was the predominant strain. Crossover of Phase 2/3 
participants was completed by October 2021.  
• 
Placebo crossover to BNT162b2 (30 µg) group for the period from first BNT162b2 vaccination. 
Analyses were performed for COVID-19 cases accrued for the placebo crossover to BNT162b2 
(30 µg) group when Alpha and Beta variants (01 December 2020 to 10 January 2021), Gamma 
variant (11 January 2021 to 03 April 2021), Delta variant (04 April 2021 to 26 November 
2021), Omicron variant (27 November 2021 to LSLV) were predominant.  
For cases of first COVID-19 occurrence after vaccination, the IRs for participants in the original 
BNT162b2, original placebo prior to crossover, and placebo crossover to BNT162b2 groups were 
104.562, 125.722, and 169.138 per 1000 person-years of follow-up, respectively. 
Table 10: Incidence Rates of First COVID-19 Occurrence After Vaccination – All-Available 
Efficacy Population 
Kaplan-Meier curve shows the case accrual from vaccination up to the end of study date for the 
participants who received BNT162b2 originally (original BNT162b2 group), participants who received 
placebo originally prior to crossover (original placebo group), and participants who received placebo 
originally and then crossed over to receive BNT162b2 (placebo crossover to BNT162b2 group), with 
severe COVID-19 cases denoted with ‘S’ on the curves. During the entire study period, most 
participants were eligible to receive up to 4 vaccine doses (2 dose primary series and 2 booster doses). 
In the postvaccination period, there is clear evidence of better protection by BNT162b2 compared to 
placebo in the immediate months following vaccination before cross over occurred. After placebo 
crossover, case accrual increased for both the original BNT162b2 and placebo crossover groups 
following different variant waves. The curves steepen substantially around 470 and 300 days for the 
original BNT162b2 and placebo crossover groups, respectively, which likely represents when each 
group was exposed to the start of the Omicron waves.

Figure 2: Cumulative Incidence Curves for the First COVID-19 Occurrence After  Vaccination 
– All Available Efficacy Population 
Assessor´s comment: The current results illustrate the VE over the 2 years of pandemic, where 
different new SARS-CoV-2 strains evolved over a short time window and Original Comirnaty became 
less immunogenically cross-reactive with the circulating strains. The Original Comirnaty was very 
effective in the beginning of the pandemic. After the authorisation, the placebo arm were offered 
vaccination and became a cross-over arm. The active arm were offered more doses as the study 
continued with booster doses. The cross over arm also received boosters, but with at a later time point 
and therefore had received fewer doses than the original active arm every time a new strain appeared. 
Thus, the results are not easily interpretable but are in agreement with waning protection to new 
variants.  
The MAH Summary of Efficacy 
A formal secondary efficacy analysis was performed to assess vaccine efficacy against asymptomatic 
SARS-CoV-2 infections and against non-S-seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2. The incidence of confirmed 
first COVID-19 through the entire study follow-up period in participants who received BNT162b2 was 
also described.

In the evaluable efficacy (asymptomatic surveillance) population without evidence of SARS-
CoV-2 infection prior to the start of the asymptomatic surveillance period, the VE for BNT162b2 
30 µg (2-dose primary series) based on NAAT-confirmed infection was 37.2% (2-sided 95% 
CI: -20.0%, 66.7%) based on 24 asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in the BNT162b2 group 
and 20 infections reported in the placebo group.  
In the evaluable efficacy (asymptomatic surveillance) population with evidence of SARS-CoV-2 
infection prior to the start of the asymptomatic surveillance period, the VE for BNT162b2 30 µg 
(2-dose primary series) was 70.8% (2-sided 95% CI: 39.7%, 87.1%) based on 
10 asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in the BNT162b2 group and 35 infections reported in 
the placebo group.  
In the evaluable efficacy (seroconversion) population without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection 
prior to the first post–Dose 2 N-binding test, the VE for BNT162b2 30 µg (2-dose primary 
series) was 52.9% (2-sided 95% CI: 47.2%, 57.9%) for confirmed cases. From Dose 2 to 1 
month after Dose 2 and from >1 month after Dose 2, the VE was 60.4% and 56.6%, 
respectively, and the overall VE was 52.9% (2-sided 95% CI: 47.2%, 57.9%) after Dose 2.  
•  Confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued through the entire study follow-up as multiple SARS-CoV-2 
variants circulated, most notably following the emergence of Omicron. Incidence Rates for 
participants in the original BNT162b2, original placebo prior to crossover, and placebo 
crossover to BNT162b2 groups were 104.562, 125.722, and 169.138 per 1000 person-years of 
follow-up, respectively. This prompted the development and implementation of variant-
adapted vaccines: bivalent vaccines targeting the original/wild type strain and Omicron BA.1 or 
BA.4/BA.5, and most recently monovalent XBB.1.5.

Phase 3 
Summarised below are immunogenicity results for Phase 3 BNT162b2-experienced participants, 18 
through 55 and >55 years of age, who received a lower booster dose (Dose 3) of BNT162b2 (5 or 10 
µg). 
Immunogenicity Populations 
The immunogenicity populations of BNT162b2-experienced participants who were rerandomised to 
receive a booster dose of BNT162b2 (5 or 10 µg) instead of approved dose of 30 µg are presented 
below. One participant each was excluded from the Dose 3 booster evaluable immunogenicity 
population for not having at least 1 valid and determinate immunogenicity result within 28-42 days 
after booster vaccination in the BNT162b2 (5 µg) >55 years of age group and the BNT162b2 (10 µg) 
18 through 55 years and >55 years of age groups. One additional participant in the BNT162b2 (5 µg) 
>55 years of age group was excluded from the Dose 3 booster evaluable immunogenicity population 
due to having an important protocol deviation(s) as determined by the clinician. The demographics of 
the small immunogenicity population is presented also below.

substantially at 1 month (Day 28) after the booster (Dose 3) for both dose and age groups (table 
below). The SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralising GMTs were similar, immediately before and 1 month after 
booster dose across the dose and age groups.   
Similar results were observed for participants in the booster (Dose 3) evaluable immunogenicity 
population regardless of prior infection status and for participants in the Dose 3 booster all-available 
immunogenicity population.

Population 
Assessor´s comment: the majority of this immunology population did not have signs of previous 
infection with SARS-CoV-2. Unfortunately, here was not direct comparison to the approved 30 µg dose 
investigated. Anyhow, the pre 3-dose titre was similar to the earlier reported 30 µg age group. After 
the 3rd dose with 5 or 10 µg, the titres were very similar to each other, around 900- 1000. The earlier 
data for 30 µg dose show titre above 2000, 1 month post-dose 3. We can conclude that lower dose for 
adults is immunogenic, but the 30 µg is more suitable.

GMFRs 
Among participants in the Dose 3 booster evaluable immunogenicity population without evidence of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after the booster (Dose 3), the GMFR of SARS-CoV-2 50% serum 
neutralising titres 1 month after Dose 3 ranged from 9.0 to 12.4 (median time 6.8 to 7.2 months from 
Dose 2 to booster [Dose 3]) in the BNT162b2 (5 or 10 µg) groups. Of note, GMFR of SARS-CoV-2 50% 
serum neutralising titre from before Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3 of BNT162b2 30 µg was 17.7 
(median time 6.8 months from Dose 2 to booster [Dose 3]) (20 May 2022 interim CSR), indicating a 
higher booster effect of the 30-µg dose than the lower doses (5 or 10 µg). 
The GMFRs were similar for participants in the booster (Dose 3) evaluable immunogenicity population 
regardless of prior infection status and for participants in the booster (Dose 3) all-available 
immunogenicity population.

(Lower Dose) – Dose 3 Booster Evaluable Immunogenicity Population 
Assessor´s comment: By 1 month after Dose 3, the GMFR from before Dose 3 was 17.6 (2-sided 
95% CI: 15.3, 20.2), which is higher than after 5 or 10 µg. No correlate of protection has been 
identified, but it is assumed that higher neutralising antibody titres likely correlates with increased 
protection, and therefore it can be concluded that the Original Comirnaty 30 µg is an adequate dose 
for a booster for adults as it resulted in higher titres than in case of lower doses. 
The MAH Summary of Immunogenicity 
Lower booster doses of BNT162b2 (5 or 10 µg) in BNT162b2-experienced participants substantially 
increased SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibody response 1 month after Dose 3 in participants 18 through 
55 and >55 years of age, based on GMTs, GMFRs, and Reverse Cumulative Incidence Curves 
(RCDCs). Although there is no contemporaneous 30-µg comparator for lower booster doses of 
BNT162b2 (5 or 10 µg), the GMFR for 30-µg booster (Phase 3), presented in the 20 May 2022 interim 
CSR, show that, based on GMFR values, a higher booster dose of BNT162b2 elicits a more robust 
immune response.  
6.3.  Discussion 
Study C4591001 is a Phase 1/2/3 multicentre, multinational, randomised, placebo-controlled, 
observer-blind, dose finding, vaccine candidate-selection, and efficacy study in healthy individuals ≥12 
years of age. This report includes the final data from study C4591001. The study including more than 
40,000 individuals. They received 2 doses of Original Comirnaty 30 µg, and were followed up for up to 
2 years post-dose 2. Originally, the study had an active arm and a placebo arm, but after the approval 
of the vaccine, the placebo arm was offered vaccination thus creating a cross-over arm and the study 
became unblinded. The study continued with options to receive booster doses with the Original vaccine 
(3 and 4th dose) in all groups. The surveillance for COVID-19 continued during the entire study period, 
up to 2 years post-dose 2. Also, participants gave 3-5 blood samples to monitor for seroconversion

after possible infection (N-antigen antibody detection). 
In the current final report, the MAH presents data from asymptomatic infection surveillance during the 
entire study period and also an immunogenicity analysis of a third dose of BNT162b2 at a lower dose of 
5 or 10 µg administered to smaller population of Phase 2/3 participants. 
The asymptomatic infection surveillance was performed using two distinct biomarkers: NAAT in a 
subpopulation (N= 4000) and N-protein detection in the entire population (N= 40 000). The time 
window to detect viral RNA was limited. The surveillance for asymptomatic infections did not start 
immediately after the vaccination. The median time between Dose 2 and the start of the asymptomatic 
surveillance period was 2.9 months for participants in the United States and 5.3 months for 
participants in Argentina. Cases were counted from the start of the asymptomatic surveillance period. 
Therefore, the current testing for NAAT involves uncertainties. There were only 44 asymptomatic cases 
accrued from 3921 individuals, showing that asymptomatic cases are rather rare or have been missed. 
The VE result based on a such testing gave a wide CI, VE = 37.2% (95% CI: -20.0%; 66.7%).  
Interestingly, a rather high proportion of asymptomatic cases were detected among the previously 
infected population (45 asymptomatic cases out of 210 subjects). Although the sample size was small, 
it appears that a COVID-19 experienced population are at lower risk to develop symptoms during a 
subsequent infection compared to the first infection. Also, despite low numbers, the data showed 
better protection against asymptomatic infections for subjects who have been infected before 
vaccination compared to the earlier infected but unvaccinated subjects: VE = 70.8% (95% CI: 39.7%; 
87.1%). This phenomenon is described earlier in observational studies, where previous infection in 
combination with vaccination gave a broader protection against new strains compared to only infection 
or only vaccination.  
The N-protein specific antibodies are stable, long-lasting markers for natural SARS-CoV-2 infection 
regardless of the virus strain. The entire study population (N= 40,000) was sampled for blood after 1-, 
6, 12-, and 24-months post-dose 2 and tested for the seroconversion to the N-protein.  
Seroconversion to the N-protein is a stable biomarker for past SARS-CoV-2 infection and therefore this 
analysis gives a reliable estimate of infection. The follow-up time for the placebo arm was about half 
compared to the active arm, which might introduce a biased analysis. The results of the N-antibody 
seroconversion analysis indicated that Comirnaty Original 30 provided protection against asymptomatic 
infections after 2 doses. The N-antibody seroconversion analysis showed that Comirnaty Original 30 µg 
provided protection against asymptomatic infections after 2 doses during the study period: VE = 
52.9% (95% CI: 47.2%; 57.9%).  
The current results illustrate the VE over the 2 years of pandemic, where different new SARS-CoV-2 
strains evolved over a short time window and Original Comirnaty became less immunogenically cross-
reactive with the circulating strains. The Original Comirnaty was very effective in the beginning of the 
pandemic. After the authorisation, the placebo arm were offered vaccination and became a cross-over 
arm. The active arm were offered more doses as the study continued with booster doses. The cross-
over arm also received boosters, but with at a later time point and therefore had received fewer doses 
than the original active arm every time a new strain appeared. Thus, the results are not easily 
interpretable but are in agreement with waning protection to new variants. 
The MAH submitted also immunogenicity results for Phase 3 BNT162b2-experienced participants, 18 
through 55 (N= 25) and >55 years of age (N= 55), who received a lower booster dose (Dose 3) of 
BNT162b2 (5 or 10 µg).  Lower booster doses of BNT162b2 substantially increased SARS-CoV-2 
neutralising antibody response 1 month after Dose 3, based on GMTs, GMFRs, and RCDCs. Although 
there was no contemporaneous 30-µg comparator for lower booster doses the GMFR for 30-µg booster 
(Phase 3), presented earlier showed that a higher booster dose of BNT162b2 elicits a more robust

immune response (GMFR 30-µg = 17; 10 -µg= 12; 5 -µg= 11 for > 55 yoa). Therefore the usage of 
30-µg for booster is accurate. 
In conclusions, the MAH has presented the final report of study C4591001, with new information about 
2 dose Original Comirnaty 30µg VE against asymptomatic infections, incidents rate during the entire 2 
years of follow up and boosting effect of the lower doses for adults. The results show that 2 doses of 
Original Comirnaty provided protection against asymptomatic infections, the Original Active arm was 
better protected than Placebo or Placebo cross-over arm during the evolving pandemic and that also 
lower doses of Original Comirnaty have boosting effect for adults. 
No changes to the section 5.1 in the SmPC are suggested and we agree. 
7.  Clinical Safety aspects 
7.1.  Methods  
Study C4591001 was a Phase 1/2/3, multicentre, multinational, randomised, placebo-controlled, 
observer-blind, dose finding, vaccine candidate‒selection, and efficacy study in healthy individuals ≥12 
years of age. The study consisted of 2 parts: Phase 1 to identify preferred vaccine candidate(s) and 
dose level(s) in individuals 18 through 55 and 65 through 85 years of age; and Phase 2/3 as an 
expanded cohort and efficacy part in individuals ≥12 years of age.  
This report includes final results from study C4591001 and interim data for subjects aged 12-15 years 
who had received one booster dose of BNT162b2 30µg. Based on these data, update of section 4.8 in 
the SmPC has been proposed by the MAH. 
7.1.1.  Phase 1 
Disposition and Exposure 
Disposition of all randomised Phase 1 participants is presented in the table below. All randomised 
participants received 2 doses and completed the 1-month post–Dose 2 visit during the blinded, 
placebo-controlled period. Note that for the BNT162b1 100-μg group, the internal review committee 
(IRC) determined not to administer the second dose of 100 μg to this group of participants due to 
reactogenicity and as per IRC decision, these participants were instead given Dose 2 of BNT162b1 at 
the 10-μg dose level. During the open-label follow-up period, 25.0% to 100.0% of participants 
originally randomised to receive BNT162b1 or BNT162b2, completed the 6-month post–Dose 2 visit. 
Most participant withdrawals were due to either no longer meeting eligibility criteria or protocol 
deviations.

Assessor´s comment: 
In this Phase 1 study, primary series of BNT162b1 (10, 20, 30, 100µg) and BNT162b2 (10, 20, 30 µg) 
was administered to subgroups including 24 adult subjects in each group (total n=195). Most of these 
subjects then received one booster dose of BNT162b2 (30 μg), and an additional booster dose was 
administered to about half of the study population. Median follow-up time since first booster dose was 
12-21 months in the different initial vaccine groups, and the median follow-up time after the additional 
booster dose was 5-6 months. 
A slightly higher frequency of female participants was noted (59% vs 41%), majority were white, and 
the study was executed in USA. The age of the subject ranged between 20-83 years. 
7.1.2.  Phase 2/3 
Disposition of Participants from Dose 1 of BNT162b2 30 μg to Before Booster Dose 
Final disposition of all randomised Phase 2/3 participants 12 through 15 years of age and ≥16 years of 
age is presented below for the blinded placebo-controlled and open-label follow-up periods. 
The following is noted for these participants:

• 
Individuals 12 through 15 years of age and ≥ 16 years of age were unblinded as they became 
locally eligible and wished to know their vaccine assignment to confirm prior vaccination with 
BNT162b2 (if randomised to this group), or to receive BNT162b2 (if randomised to placebo). 
Unblinded recipients originally randomised to BNT162b2 were followed in an open-label 
manner. Unblinded recipients originally randomised to placebo were offered BNT162b2 
vaccination (Doses 3 and 4 [first and second dose of BNT162b2 30 μg, respectively]) and were 
also followed in an open-label manner. 
•  Seventeen participants were inadvertently enrolled at multiple sites, and they were excluded 
from all data summaries.

Participants With Confirmed Stable HIV Disease 
In total 201 HIV-positive subjects were randomised and vaccinated (n=100 BNT162b2; n=101 
Placebo). During the blinded placebo-controlled follow-up period, most HIV-positive participants 
randomised to the BNT162b2 and placebo groups received Doses 1 and 2. There were 4 participants 
(4.0%) in the BNT162b2 group and 4 participants (4.0%) in the placebo group who discontinued from 
the vaccination period (Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2). Most participants completed the 1-month 
post–Dose 2 visit (≥97.0%). Few participants in the BNT162b2 and placebo groups were withdrawn 
from the study (2.0% and 4.0%, respectively). The reasons were withdrawal by the participant, lost to 
follow-up, and death. 
In the BNT162b2 (30 μg) group, during the open-label follow-up period, there were 58 participants 
(58.0%) withdrawn from the study, and most were due to other reasons. In the placebo group, during 
the open-label follow-up period, most participants originally randomised to placebo received Doses 1 
and 2 (89.1% and 88.1%, respectively) of BNT162b2. There were 19 participants (18.8%) in this 
group who were withdrawn from the study. The most common reason was “other”. 
Assessor´s comment: 
The final disposition for all randomised subjects to the Phase 2/3 study C4591001 included a total of 
46406 subjects aged ≥12 years, of which 99.8% received the two doses included in the primary series 
of BNT162b2 30µg. Among the subjects who were originally randomised to placebo 89-92% received 
two doses of BNT162b2 30µg. In total were 1156 subjects withdrawn from the study, most of them 
due to lost to follow-up (n=543) or withdrawn by subject (n=397). 
In total were 201 HIV-positive subjects were randomised and vaccinated (n=100 BNT162b2; n=101 
Placebo). Most of them received the primary series and remained in the study. In the placebo group 
who later received BNT162b2 30µg, it in noted that 19 participants (19%) of the participants 
withdrawn due to “other reason”.

Protocol amendment 19 (21 March 2022) 
Assessor´s comment: 
In this part of the study (described in protocol amendment 14 and 15), subjects that had already 
received the primary series of BNT162b2 30 µg were rerandomised to receive booster doses of 
BNT162b2 at 5, 10, 30 µg or BNT162b2SA (N=780). In addition, 30 subjects were assigned to receive 
booster doses of BNT162b2SA. All subjects received the first booster dose. The second booster dose 
was not received by 41% of the subjects in the BNT162b2 30 µg group. In the other groups 37-58% of 
the subjects did not receive the additional booster vaccination. 
Exposure and Follow-up Time 
Participants who Received Booster Dose of BNT162b2 30 μg as Part of Protocol Amendment 18 
Participants 12 through 15 years of age, the median (min, max) time between Dose 2 and booster 
vaccination was 11.2 (6.3, 20.1) months. Most participants (93.9%) received the booster dose of 
BNT162b2 <15 months after Dose 2. 
Participants 16 years of ag and older, the median (min, max) time between Dose 2 and booster 
vaccination was 10.1 (4.8, 22.7) months. Most participants (85.7%) received the booster dose of

Assessor´s comment 
In the Phase 2/3 study that included 825 subjects aged 12-15 years of age, the median age was 14 
years. All subjects received the booster dose, six of them discontinued the study due to lost to follow-
up. Withdrawal from study was reported among 176 subjects (21%), most common reason was 
“other” (n=124). The study was executed in the USA and the distribution between gender were 
similar. The median follow-up time after first booster dose was 9.5 months and from Dose 2 18.1 
months. The median time from Dose 2 to booster dose was 11.2 months (range 6.3-20.1 months).

Two SAEs were reported by 1 participant in the BNT162b2 20-μg group and 1 participant in the 30-μg 
group. In the BNT162b2 20-μg group, 1 SAE of appendicitis was reported in 1 participant and was 
assessed by the investigator as not related to study intervention. In the BNT162b2 30-μg group, 1 
severe SAE of neuritis was reported by 1 participant and was assessed by the investigator as not 
related to 
study intervention. 
First Booster Dose to 1 Month after the First Booster Dose 
Overview of AEs are illustrated in the table below. 
Table 40: Number (%) of Subjects Reporting at Least 1 Adverse Event From the First 
Booster Dose to 1 Month After the First Booster Dose – Phase 1 – Subjects Who Received 
the First Booster Dose of BNT162b2 (30 μg) – Booster Safety Population 
A limited number of AEs by SOC were reported by Phase 1 participants from the first booster dose to 1 
month after the first booster dose. Generally, most Preferred Terms (PTs) were reported by no more 
than 1 participant per the initial BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 dose groups and included, but not limited 
to, reports of lymphadenopathy, fatigue, axillary pain, chills, myalgia, muscle spasms, dizziness, 
headache, paresthesia, and presyncope. One participant (4.2%) reported an AE of deep vein 
thrombosis toxicity grade 2, 29 days after the booster dose. The subject was in the initial BNT162b1 
20-μg group, and the event was not considered related to vaccination. 
Related AEs 
Related AEs were reported in the initial BNT162b1 10-, 20-, and 30-μg groups and the initial 
BNT162b2 10-μg group only. Related AEs were reported by no more than 3 participants per group. 
From the first booster dose to 1 month after the first booster dose, AEs assessed as related by the 
investigator in the initial BNT162b1 10- and 20-μg groups were reported by no more than 1 participant 
per group. Two participants (8.3%) in the initial 30-μg dose group reported a related AE of 
lymphadenopathy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/446369/2023  
Page 59/88 
 
 
 
 
In the initial BNT162b2 10-μg group, general disorders and administration site conditions (chills, 
injection site haemorrhage) and nervous system disorders (paraesthesia and headache) were reported 
by 2 participants (9.1%) each. 
Immediate AEs 
There were no immediate adverse events reported after the first booster dose in the initial BNT162b1 
groups. In the initial BNT162b2 10-μg group, 1 immediate AE of injection site haemorrhage was 
reported in 1 participant. 
Severe or life-threatening AEs 
From the first booster dose to 1 month after the first booster dose, 2 severe events (axillary pain and 
headache) were reported by 2 participants (8.3%) in the initial BNT162b1 30-μg group. One life-
threatening (Grade 4) event of colitis was reported in the initial BNT162b1 100-μg group, onset 4 days 
after booster vaccination, and was assessed by the investigator as unrelated to study vaccine. 
SAEs and death 
No deaths were reported in the Phase 1 booster safety population in the initial BNT162b1 and 
BNT162b2 groups from the first booster dose to 1 month after the first booster dose. 
From booster dose (Dose 3) to 1 month after booster dose of BNT162b2 30 μg, 1 participant (11.1%) 
in the initial BNT162b1 100-μg group reported 1 SAE of colitis which was assessed by the investigator 
as unrelated to the vaccine. This participant required overnight observation at the emergency room 
due to symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and blood in stool, with the diagnosis confirmed by CT 
scan of the abdomen. Treatment was with oral antibiotics and a follow up sigmoidoscopy was negative 
with full resolution of symptoms 19 days after onset. 
Discontinuation from study due to AEs 
No participants in the Phase 1 BNT162b2 booster safety population in the initial BNT162b1 and 
BNT162b2 groups were withdrawn due to AEs from the first booster dose of BNT162b2 (30 μg) to 1 
month after the first booster dose. 
Pregnancy 
One pregnancy was reported in the Phase 1 BNT162b2 booster safety population in the initial 
BNT162b1 group from the first booster dose of BNT162b2 (30 μg) to 1 month after the first booster 
dose. 
Additional Booster Dose to 1 Month After the Additional Booster Dose 
From Dose 4 to 1 month after Dose 4, the number (%) of participants with any AE was 3 (3.8%); 
these AEs were considered by investigators as related to study intervention. No participants reported a 
severe or life-threatening AE. No event of pregnancy was reported. No SAEs, AEs leading to 
withdrawal, or deaths were reported. 
The study did not use e-diary to collect reactogenicity events after the additional booster dose (Dose 
4). Events related to reactogenicity (i.e., injection site pain, myalgia, pyrexia, and headache) were 
collected as AEs. Of the AEs reported during this period, some were reactogenicity events reported as 
AEs. The number of participants (%) who reported AEs by SOC for these reactogenicity terms are as 
follows: 
• 
general disorders and administration site conditions: 1 (1.3%) 
•  musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: 2 (2.5%) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/446369/2023  
Page 60/88 
 
 
 
From the additional booster dose to 1 month after the additional booster dose, 3 participants (3.8%) 
had AEs assessed by the investigator as related to study intervention. These events, which also 
included reactogenicity events, were reported as AEs. One participant (1.3%) each reported injection 
site pain, myalgia, and pain in extremity. 
MAH Conclusion 
All doses of BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 were safe and well tolerated. BNT162b1 at 100μg was 
discontinued due to the reactogenicity profile (previously reported); no participants in either age group 
received any dose of BNT162b2 at the 100-μg dose level. 
The frequency of participants with any AE after the booster doses (Dose 3 and Dose 4) of BNT162b2 
(30 μg) was low, with most participants reporting mild, reactogenicity-type events. 
The frequency of participants reporting SAEs after the first 2 doses of BNT162b1 and BNT162b2, and 
the booster doses (Dose 3 and Dose 4), was from none to low, and all SAEs reported were assessed by 
the investigator as not related to study intervention. There were no AEs leading to withdrawal or 
deaths reported. 
Assessor´s comment: 
Local and systemic events for these participants was presented in the initial application for 
EMEA/H/C/005735/0000. 
From the first booster to one month after the first booster dose of BNT162b2 30 µg, most of the 
reported AEs were related to reactogenicity. One event of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) not considered 
related to the vaccination was reported in one participant. Two events of related lymphadenopathy 
were reported. One event of immediate haemorrhage was reported in one participant.  
The reported AEs after the administered booster doses in the Phase 1 study are in line with what has 
previously been observed for the primary series.  
7.2.2.  Phase 2/3 
Local Reactions and Systemic Events 
Reactogenicity for subjects receiving primary series of BNT162b2 30µg has been reported previously. 
Local reactions and systemic events for BNT162b2-experienced participants 18 through 55 and >55 
years of age who were rerandomised to receive 1 booster dose of BNT162b2 (lower dose of 5 or 10 
μg) under protocol amendment 15 are presented in this final CSR. 
Local Reactions and Systemic Events for Participants who Received Lower Dose Booster 
Local reactions and systemic events in BNT162b2-experienced participants 18 through 55 and >55 
years of age who received 1 booster dose of BNT162b2 (5 or 10 μg) were mild to moderate at 
intensity, as illustrated below.

Assessor´s comment 
Among the subjects that had received a low dose booster dose (BNT162b2 at 5 or 10 µg), showed a 
similar reactogenicity profile as what has been observed from the primary series. No subjects who 
received BNT162b2 5 µg reported fever. There was a clear trend to lower reactogenicity with lower 
dose and lower reactogenicity in subjects aged >55 years compared to subjects aged 18-54 years.  
Adverse Events from Dose 1 to 6 months after Dose 2 
Final SAE analyses are reported for participants ≥16 years of age from Dose 1 to 6 months after Dose 
2 during the blinded, placebo-controlled and open label follow-periods. 
SAEs dose 1 up to 6 months after dose 2 
From Dose 1 to 6 months after Dose 2 of BNT162b2, 291 participants (1.3%) in the placebo group 
reported SAEs after receiving placebo. All SAEs were assessed by the investigator as not related to 
study intervention. 
From Dose 1 to 6 months after Dose 2 of BNT162b2, participants who reported at least 1 SAE were 
similar in the original BNT162b2 group (428 participants [2.0%]) and original placebo/BNT162b2 group 
(353 participants [1.7%]). 
In the original BNT162b2 (30 μg) group, there were 3 participants with an SAE each assessed by the 
investigator as related to study intervention: 
•  One participant experienced a ventricular arrhythmia that occurred 1 day after Dose 2 of 
BNT162b2 and resolved within 8 days. 
•  One participant experienced a shoulder injury related to vaccine administration that resolved 
153 days after Dose 2 of BNT162b2 administration. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/446369/2023  
Page 63/88 
 
 
 
 
 
•  One participant experienced paresthesia that occurred 47 days after Dose 2 of BNT162b2, 
which lasted 221 days and resolved. 
In the original placebo/BNT162b2 (30 μg) group, 3 participants had an SAE assessed by the 
investigator as related to study intervention: 
•  One participant experienced an SAE of portal vein thrombosis that occurred 61 days after Dose 
2 of BNT162b2, which lasted 8 days and resolved. 
•  One participant experienced a transient ischemic attack that occurred 5 days after Dose 2 of 
BNT162b2, which lasted 1 day and resolved. 
•  One participant experienced myalgia that occurred 59 days after Dose 2 of BNT162b2, which 
lasted for 51 days and resolved. 
There were no clinically meaningful differences in SAEs by age group, race, sex, or ethnicity.  
Assessor´s comment 
From the first dose up to 6 months after the second dose, a similar frequency of SAEs was reported in 
the vaccine group and in the placebo group (2% vs 1.7%). 
No new safety concerns were detected here.

Analysis of Adverse Events 
Participants 12 Through 15 Years of Age and ≥16 Years of Age who Received Booster Dose of 
BNT162b2 (30 μg) 
The most commonly reported AE in both age groups was injection site pain, in 66 participants (8.0%) 
in the 12 through 15 years of age group and 1679 (7.5%) in the ≥16 years of age group. Most AEs 
reported during this period reflect reactogenicity events reported as AEs. AE frequencies by 
reactogenicity SOC for both groups (12 through 15 years of age and ≥16 years of age) were: 
• 
general disorders and administration site conditions (130 [15.8%] and 2923 [13.0%) 
•  nervous system disorders (49 [5.9%] and 632 [2.8%]) 
•  musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (19 [2.3%] and 646 [2.9%]) 
• 
gastrointestinal disorders (12 [1.5%] and 203 [0.9%])

• 
Lymphadenopathy was reported by 8 and 360 participants (1.0% and 1.6%) in the 12 through 
15 years of age and ≥16 years of age groups, respectively. 
There were no clinically important differences regarding the percentage of participants reporting at 
least 1 AE by SOC and PT in the subgroup analyses by age, race, sex, and ethnicity from the 
administration of Dose 3 of BNT162b2 (30 μg) to 1 month after Dose 3. 
Participants With Confirmed Stable HIV Disease who Received Booster Dose of BNT162b2 (30 μg) 
From Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3, AEs were most commonly reported in the SOC of general 
disorders and administration site conditions (7 participants [7.1%]), followed by gastrointestinal 
disorders (2 participants [2.0%]). 
BNT162b2-Naïve Participants Assigned to Receive BNT162b2SA who Received Booster Dose of 
BNT162b2 (30 μg) 
From Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3, AEs were most commonly reported in the SOC of general 
disorders and administration site conditions (23 participants [9.7%]) followed by musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders (6 participants [2.5%]). 
Assessor´s comment 
From the first booster dose up to one month after the first booster dose of BNT162b2 30 µg, the 
frequency of any AEs was 17% (n=3818) among the subjects ≥16 years of age, many of them were 
considered related to study vaccine (15% [n=3377]) and most of them were reactogenicity events. 
There was no difference among the subjects that had a confirmed stable HIV disease who received a 
booster dose. Among the BNT162b2-naïve subjects that received a booster dose, the reported AES was 
mostly related to reactogenicity. 
No new safety concern was detected here.  
Related Adverse Events 
Related AEs Phase 2/3 Participants who Received Booster Dose of BNT162b2 (30 μg) 
From Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3, 3377 participants (15.0%) in the ≥16 years of age group had 
AEs assessed by the investigator as related to study intervention. The most common related event was 
injection site pain, reported in 1678 participants (7.5%) in the ≥16 years of age group. Most of the 
other related AEs were reactogenicity events in the SOC of general disorders and administration site 
conditions, reported by 2910 (13.0%) in the ≥16 years of age group. Headache was reported by 550 
participants (2.4%) in the ≥16 years of age group. 
BNT162b2-Naïve Participants Assigned to Receive BNT162b2SA who Received Booster Dose of 
BNT162b2 (30 μg) 
From Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3, 25 BNT162b2-naïve participants (10.6%) assigned to receive 
BNT162b2SA who received the booster dose of BNT162b2 (30 μg) had AEs assessed by the 
investigators as related to study intervention. The most common related event was injection site pain 
in 11 participants (4.7%). 
Assessor´s comment 
Among the subjects that received a booster dose, pain at injection site was the most commonly 
reported related AE. Most of the related AEs concerned reactogenicity. The same pattern was observed 
among the BNT162b2-naïve subjects. 
No new safety concern was detected here.

Immediate Adverse Events 
Phase 2/3 Participants who Received Booster Dose of BNT162b2 (30 μg) 
The frequencies of immediate AEs reported within 30 minutes after the booster dose were low (≤ 
0.4%) in the 12 through 15 years of age and ≥16 years of age groups. 26 participants reported 
injection site pain and 6 participants reported fatigue in the ≥16 years of age group. In addition, in the 
≥16 years of age group, 31 participants (0.1%) reported immediate AEs in the SOC of injury, 
poisoning and procedural complications with 20 participants (0.1%) reporting exposure during 
pregnancy. 
There were no immediate AEs reported in the BNT162b2-naïve booster safety population (assigned to 
Receive BNT162b2SA) after receiving the booster dose. 
Assessor´s comment 
Few immediate AEs was reported after the booster dose of BNT162b2 30 µg. 
No new safety concern was detected here. 
Severe or Life-Threatening Adverse Events 
Phase 2/3 Participants who Received Booster Dose of BNT162b2 (30 μg) 
From Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3, severe events in participants ≥16 years of age were reported in 
90 participants (0.4%). Life-threatening (or Grade 4) events were reported in 6 participants ≥16 years 
of age from booster dose to 1 month after booster dose. Of the 6 reported life-threatening events, 1 
was considered by the investigator as related to study intervention: Angioedema reported in 1 
participant, occurred 1 day after Dose 3 with a duration of 2 days. The event was reported as an SAE 
and resolved, and the participant continued in the study. 
There were no severe or life-threatening AEs reported in BNT162b2-naïve participants assigned to 
Receive BNT162b2SA who received the booster dose of BNT162b2 (30 μg). 
Assessor´s comment 
One severe event of angioedema which was considered related to the booster dose was reported. The 
event occurred one day after the booster dose and resolved after two days. Angioedema is already 
listed as an adverse reaction in the SmPC at the frequency uncommon. 
Deaths 
One death was reported in the booster dose BNT162b2 (30 μg) ≥16 years of age group. The 
participant died 22 days after Dose 3 with the cause of death provided as adenocarcinoma of the 
pancreas which was considered unrelated to study intervention.

In the ≥16 years age groups, 2 participants had SAEs assessed by the investigator as related to study 
intervention:  
•  One 30 to 40-year-old participant experienced an SAE of spontaneous abortion toxicity grade 1 
that occurred 13 days after Dose 3. 
•  An SAE of myocarditis of Grade 3 severity was reported in one 16-18-year-old male 
participant, 4 days following the booster dose. The SAE lasted for 101 days, and the event 
resolved with sequalae.  
There were no clinically important differences regarding the percentage of participants reporting at 
least 1 SAE in the subgroup analyses by age, race, sex, and ethnicity from the administration of Dose 
3 of BNT162b2 (30 μg) to 1 month after Dose 3. 
Among the BNT162b2-naïve participants assigned to receive BNT162b2SA who received booster 
dose of BNT162b2 (30 μg), there were no SAEs reported after receiving the booster dose.

Assessor´s comment 
The frequency of SAE was <0,5% among the subjects ≥12 years of age that received a booster dose 
of BNT162b2 30 µg. One SAE of myocarditis was reported. Myocarditis is already listed in the SmPC 
both in section 4.4 and 4.8. One event of spontaneous abortion toxicity grade 1 was reported 13 days 
after vaccination, the participant had an additional miscarriage 105 days after vaccination which was 
not considered related to the vaccination. The investigator considered the first spontaneous abortion to 
be possible related with the vaccination, which was not agreed by the MAH. The opinion of the MAH 
can be supported since the presented data does not allow to conclude upon a possible relation to 
vaccination. 
Discontinuation from Study due to AEs 
One participant in the ≥16 years of age group had an AE leading to withdrawal that was considered by 
the investigator as not related to study intervention (adenocarcinoma of the pancreas). 
No participants in the population of BNT162b2-naïve participants assigned to receive BNT162b2SA who 
received booster dose of BNT162b2 (30 μg) were withdrawn due to AEs from Dose 3 to 1 month after 
Dose 3. 
Assessor´s comment 
One participant discontinued the study due to adenocarcinoma of the pancreas which was not 
considered related to vaccination. 
Pregnancy 
One pregnancy was reported in BNT162b2-Naïve participants assigned to received BNT162b2SA who 
received booster dose of BNT162b2 (30 μg). 
First Booster to 1 and 6 Months after Booster Dose (Lower Doses) 
BNT162b2 (5 μg) Groups 
From the BNT162b2 (5 μg) booster dose to 1 month after the booster dose, the number of BNT162b2-
experienced participants with any AE was 3 and 2 participants (11.5% and 3.8%) in the 18 through 55 
years of age and >55 years of age groups, respectively. One participant (1.9%) reported a related AE 
in the >55 years of age group. No participants reported severe AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to withdrawal, 
or deaths in either age group. Through 6 months after the booster dose, AEs were reported by 2 
additional participants >55 years of age, with 1 participant (1.9%) reporting an SAE that was assessed 
by the 
investigator as not related to study intervention. No AEs leading to withdrawal or deaths were reported 
in either of the age groups. 
BNT162b2 (10 μg) Groups 
From the BNT162b2 (10 μg) booster dose to 1 month after the booster dose, 2 (8.0%) participants 18 
through 55 years of age reported an AE. No participants in the >55 years of age group reported any 
AEs. One participant (4.0%) reported a related AE in the 18 through 55 years of age group. No SAEs, 
AEs leading to withdrawal, or deaths were reported in either of the age groups. 
Through 6 months after the booster dose, AEs were reported 6 months after the booster dose by 1 
additional participant each in 18 through 55 years of age and >55 years of age. No SAEs, AEs leading 
to withdrawal, or deaths were reported in either of the age groups.

nutrition disorders (dehydration), and nervous system disorders (dizziness). One participant (4.0%) 
reported a related AE of lymphadenopathy in the BNT162b2 (10 μg) 18 through 55 years of age group. 
Immediate Adverse Events 
There were no immediate AEs reported in the BNT162b2-experienced (lower dose) booster safety 
population after the booster dose. 
Severe or Life-Threatening Adverse Events 
There were no severe or life-threatening AEs reported in BNT162b2-experienced (lower dose) booster 
safety population after the booster dose. 
Deaths 
No deaths were reported in the BNT162b2-experienced (lower dose) safety population from the 
booster dose to 6 months after the booster dose. 
Serious Adverse Events 
From booster dose (BNT162b2 5 or 10 μg) to 6 months after booster dose 1 participant (1.9%) in the 
BNT162b2 (5 μg) >55 years of age group reported 1 SAE of back pain, which was assessed by the 
investigator as unrelated to the vaccine. 
Discontinuations from Study Due to Adverse Events 
No participants in the Phase 3 BNT162b2 (lower dose) booster safety population were withdrawn due 
to AEs from booster dose to 6 months after booster dose. 
Other Significant Adverse Events 
One participant (2.0%) reported a significant AE of unilateral deafness in the BNT162b2 (10 μg) >55 
years of age group that began approximately 2 and a half months after receipt of booster vaccination 
and was assessed by the investigator as not related to study intervention. 
Assessor´s comment 
No new safety concerns were detected among the subjects that received low booster dose (BNT162b2 
at 5 or 10 µg). No SAEs, AEs leading to withdrawal, or deaths were reported. Most of the reported AEs 
were related to reactogenicity.

Serious Adverse Events 
From the additional booster dose to 1 month after the booster dose, 1 participant (0.5%) reported an 
SAE in the BNT162b2SA (30 μg) group that was assessed by the investigator as not related to study 
intervention. 
Discontinuations From Study Due to Adverse Events 
No participants in the BNT162b2 were withdrawn due to AEs after the additional booster dose of 
BNT162b2 (30 μg). 
Assessor´s comment 
Among the subjects (N=467) that received a second booster dose (protocol amendment 14, 15 and 
19) of either BNT162b2 at 5, 10, 30 µg or BNT162b2SA 30 µg, a higher frequency of any AEs was noted 
among the subjects that received 30 µg (7-9%) compared with those who received low dose i.e., 5 or 
10 µg (0-3%). The most commonly reported events were typical for reactogenicity.  
No new safety concern was detected here. 
MAH Conclusion 
Data previously presented from this clinical study showed that the primary 2 dose series of BNT162b2 
30 μg was highly effective against symptomatic COVID-19, including cases that were severe and/or 
resulted in hospitalisation, prior to the emergence of the Omicron variant. 
Additional efficacy data presented in this CSR show that BNT162b2 30 μg likely also provides some 
protection against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in an analysis conducted prior to the 
emergence of Omicron. In addition, the cumulative incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases increased 
as multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants circulated, most notably following the emergence of Omicron. This 
resulted in the development and implementation of variant-adapted vaccines: bivalent vaccines 
targeting the original/wild type strain and Omicron BA.1 or BA.4/BA.5, and most recently monovalent 
XBB.1.5. 
Overall immunogenicity responses were similar for lower booster doses (Dose 3) of BNT162b2 (5 or 10 
μg) in the BNT162b2 5- and 10-μg groups, and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing GMTs substantially increased 
at 1 month after the lower booster dose. In addition, administration of lower booster dose of 
BNT162b2 (5 or 10 μg) was safe and tolerable. 
The primary 2-dose series for BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 at doses of 10, 20, and 30 μg was safe and 
tolerable. Administration of booster dose(s) (Dose 3, 4, or 5) of BNT162b2 30 μg to participants who 
had completed the 2-dose series showed continued safety and tolerability with most AEs consistent 
with reactogenicity-type events, and no new safety concerns.

Local Reactions and Systemic Events 
There are no analyses of local reactions and/or systemic events in this report because solicited 
reactogenicity was not collected using e-diaries after the booster dose (Dose 3), but rather as 
unsolicited AEs on the case report form. 
Adverse Events 
An overview of AEs from administration of Dose 3 one month after Dose 3 is shown below.

1 Month After Booster Dose – Phase 2/3 Subjects 12 Through 15 Years of Age at the Time of 
Receiving the First Booster Dose of BNT162b2 (30 μg) – Booster Safety Population 
From Dose 3 to the data cut-off date (03 November 2022), in addition to the 152 participants who 
reported AEs up to 1 month after Dose 3, 9 additional participants reported an AE, for a cumulative 
number of participants with any AE of 161 (19.5%). As of the cut-off date, events considered by the 
investigator as related to study intervention remained the same as at 1 month after Dose 3, reported 
by 139 participants (16.8%). In addition to the 6 participants with a severe AE that were reported up 
to 1 month after Dose 3, as of the data cut-off date there were 3 additional participants who reported 
a severe AE; which were also considered unrelated by the investigator. 
The most commonly reported AE was injection site pain, in 66 participants (8.0%). Most AEs reported 
during this period reflect reactogenicity events reported by the investigator as AEs. AE frequencies in 
SOCs for such reactogenicity terms were: 
• 
general disorders and administration site conditions: 15.8% 
•  nervous system disorders: 5.9% 
•  musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: 2.3%

Related AEs 
From Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3, 139 participants (16.8%) had AEs assessed by the investigator 
as related to study intervention (table below). The most common related event was injection site pain, 
in 65 participants (7.9%). Most of the other related AEs were reactogenicity events in the SOC of 
general disorders and administration site conditions, reported by 129 participants (15.6%) and 
headache reported by 47 participants (5.7%).

Immediate Adverse Events 
The frequencies of immediate AEs reported within 30 minutes after the booster dose were ≤0.4%, with 
2 participants reporting injection site pain and 1 participant reporting fatigue. 
Assessor´s comment 
Among the 825 subjects aged 12-15 years who received a booster dose of BNT162b2 30 µg, 18% 
reported any AEs. Most of these AEs were reactogenicity events (general disorders and administration 
site conditions and headache) and were considered related to vaccination. Pyrexia was reported in 28 
(3.4%) of the subjects. Two events of lymphadenopathy were reported, lymphadenopathy is already 
listed as an adverse reaction in the SmPC. 
Two events of immediate AEs were reported: fatigue and injection site pain.  
The results are in line with previous results and no new safety concern was detected here.  
Severe or Life-Threatening Adverse Events 
From Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3, 8 severe events (pyrexia [N=3 (0.4%)], depression [N=2] 
(0.2%), and one (0.1%) each of aggression, suicidal ideation, and dysmenorrhea) were reported by 6 
(0.7%) participants. One life-threatening (Grade 4) event of a suicide attempt was assessed by the 
investigator as unrelated to the study vaccine. 
Adverse Events from Dose 3 to the Data Cut-off Date 
From Dose 3 to the data cut-off date (03 November 2022), which represents a median of 9.5 months 
of follow-up after Dose 3, the number of participants with any AE was 161 (19.5%). There were 9 
additional participants that reported any AE beyond the 1-month after Dose 3 visit. The additional 
events were unrelated and included 3 Grade 3 SAEs (pectus excavatum, epiphyseal fracture and 
suicide ideation) and 2 Grade 4 SAEs (depressed fractured skull and subdural hematoma in the same 
participant). 
Deaths 
No deaths were reported in the Phase 3 BNT162b2 booster safety population as of the data cut-off 
date (03 November 2022). 
Serious Adverse Events from Dose 3 to 1 Month After Dose 3 
From Dose 3 to 1 month after Dose 3, 3 SAEs were reported by 2 participants (one participant 
reported depression, one participant reported suicidal ideation and suicide attempt) and were assessed 
by the investigator as unrelated to the vaccine.  
Serious Adverse Events from Dose 3 to the Data Cut-off Date 
From Dose 3 to the data cutoff date (03 November 2022), 8 SAEs were reported by 6 participants, 
including 3 SAEs reported by 2 participants after the 1-month follow-up visit after Dose 3. These 5 
SAEs were assessed by the investigator as unrelated to the study vaccine and are summarized below. 
•  A SAE of pectus excavatum of Grade 3 severity, 97 days following the booster dose. The 
participant underwent repair surgery with nuss bar placement and the SAE was considered 
recovered/resolved 67 days after the date of onset. 
•  A SAE of epiphyseal fracture/growth plate fracture of right elbow of Grade 3 severity, 71 days 
following the booster dose that recovered/resolved 64 days after the date of onset. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/446369/2023  
Page 81/88 
 
 
 
•  A SAE of suicide ideation of Grade 3 severity, 129 days following the booster dose that 
recovered/resolved 33 days after the date of onset. 
•  A participant reported 2 SAEs of traumatic left temporoparietal depressed skull fracture and 
traumatic subdural haematoma of Grade 4 severity, 110 days following the booster dose, 
resulting from an accident to the head that were recovering/resolving at the data cutoff date 
(03 November 2022). 
Safety-Related Participant Withdrawals 
No participants in the Phase 3 BNT162b2 booster safety population were withdrawn due to AEs from 
Dose 3 to the data cut-off date (03 November 2022). 
Pregnancy 
No pregnancies were reported in the Phase 2/3 BNT162b2 booster group from Dose 3 to the data cut-
off date (03 November 2022). 
Assessor´s comment 
Three events of severe pyrexia were reported. From Dose 3 and up to the cut-off date (=3 Nov 2022), 
SAEs were reported by 6 participants (depression/worsening of depression and suicidal 
ideation/suicidal attempt, pectus excavatum, elbow fracture and skull fracture), none of the events 
were considered related to vaccination. No subjects were withdrawn due to AEs. 
No new safety concern was detected here.  
MAH Conclusion 
In this report, safety data are evaluated from 825 participants 12 through 15 years of age with median 
follow-up of 9.5 months after Dose 3. The AE profile among adolescents reflects expected 
reactogenicity events, age-appropriate events consistent with the general population, with low 
incidence of severe events. The incidence of SAEs in adolescents was low. All SAEs, including all SAEs 
in the psychiatric disorders SOCs, were assessed by the investigator as not related to study 
intervention. No participants were withdrawn from the study because of an AE. No deaths occurred in 
the adolescent group. Review of AEs and SAEs suggested no new patterns or new safety signals among 
adolescents which continues to 
support the safety of BNT162b2 administered as a booster dose to individuals 12 through 15 years of 
age. 
7.3.  Discussion 
This report includes final data from the clinical study C4591001, listed as a category 3 study in the 
RMP. Safety interim data to support a proposed update in section 4.8 in the SmPC for adolescents 
aged 12-15 years who had received one booster dose of BNT162b2 30µg has also been provided.  
Study C4591001 is a Phase 1/2/3 multicentre, multinational, randomised, placebo-controlled, 
observer-blind, dose finding, vaccine candidate-selection, and efficacy study in healthy individuals ≥12 
years of age. The study was executed in the USA and consisted of 2 parts: Phase 1 to identify 
preferred vaccine candidate(s) and dose level(s) in individuals 18 through 55 and 65 through 85 years 
of age; and Phase 2/3 as an expanded cohort and efficacy part in individuals ≥12 years of age. 
Phase 1 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/446369/2023  
Page 82/88 
 
 
 
In the Phase 1 study, primary series of BNT162b1 (10, 20, 30, 100µg) and BNT162b2 (10, 20, 30 µg) 
was administered to subgroups including 24 adult subjects in each group (total n=195). Most of these 
subjects then received one booster dose of BNT162b2 (30 μg), and an additional booster dose was 
administered to about half of the study population. Median follow-up time since first booster dose was 
12-21 months in the different initial vaccine groups, and the median follow-up time after the additional 
booster dose was 5-6 months. From the first booster to one month after the first booster dose, most of 
the reported AEs were related to reactogenicity. The reported AEs after the administered booster doses 
in the Phase 1 study are in line with what has previously been observed for the primary series. 
Phase 2/3 
The final disposition for all randomised subjects to the Phase 2/3 study C4591001 included a total of 
46,406 subjects aged ≥12 years, of which 99.8% received the two doses included in the primary series 
of BNT162b2 30µg. Among the subjects who were originally randomised to placebo, 89-92% received 
two doses of BNT162b2 30µg. In total were 1,156 subjects withdrawn from the study, most of them 
due to lost to follow-up (n=543) or withdrawn by subject (n=397). The age ranged from 13-92 years, 
with a median age of 51 years. A total number of 23,406 participants in the Phase 2/3 study received 
a first booster dose, and 89% of them had completed the 6-month post-booster vaccination visit. 
Among the 22,581 subjects ≥16 years of age that received a booster vaccination, most of these 
vaccinations occurred 6-15 months after Dose 2. The median follow-up time after booster dose was 
12.3 months.  
From the first booster dose up to one month after the first booster dose of BNT162b2 30 µg, the 
frequency of any AEs was 17% (n=3,818) among the subjects ≥16 years of age, many of them were 
considered related to study vaccine (15% [n=3,377]) and most of them were reactogenicity events. 
One severe event of angioedema which was considered related to the booster dose was reported. The 
event occurred one day after the booster dose and resolved after two days. Angioedema is already 
listed as an adverse reaction in the SmPC at the frequency uncommon. 
One subject reported one SAE of myocarditis 4 days after he received the booster dose. The event 
resolved within 101 days. Myocarditis is already listed in the SmPC section 4.4 and 4.8. 
Booster dose BA.1 
BNT162b2-naïve adult subjects (n=330) received a dose of the variant vaccine BNT162b2SA (South 
Africa B.1.351). Among the BNT162b2-naïve subjects that received a dose of BNT162b2SA, the 
reported AES was mostly related to reactogenicity.  
Low dose booster dose BNT162b2 at 5 or 10 µg 
According to protocol amendment 14 and 15, adult subjects that had already received the primary 
series of BNT162b2 30 µg were rerandomised to receive one low dose booster of BNT162b2 at 5 µg 
(n=79) or 10 µg (76). None of the subjects that received BNT162b2 5 µg reported fever. There was a 
tendency to lower reactogenicity with lower dose and lower reactogenicity in subjects aged >55 years 
compared to subjects aged 18-54 years.  
Additional booster dose, protocol amendment 19 
Among the subjects (N=467) that received a second booster dose of either BNT162b2 at 5 µg (n=33), 
10 µg (n=38), 30 µg (n=182) or BNT162b2SA 30 µg (n=211), a higher frequency of any AEs was 
noted among the subjects that received 30 µg (7-9%) compared with those who received low dose 
i.e., 5 or 10 µg (0-3%). The most reported events were typical for reactogenicity. 
Subjects 12-15 years of age 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/446369/2023  
Page 83/88 
 
 
 
In the Phase 2/3 study that included 825 subjects aged 12-15 years, the median age was 14 years. All 
subjects received the booster dose, six of them discontinued the study due to lost to follow-up. 
Withdrawal from study was reported among 176 subjects (21%), most common reason was “other” 
(n=124). The study was executed in the USA and the distribution between gender were similar. The 
median follow-up time after first booster dose was 9.5 months and from Dose 2 18.1 months. The 
median time from Dose 2 to booster dose was 11.2 months (range 6.3-20.1 months).  
After the booster dose up to one month after the vaccination, 18% of the subjects reported any AEs. 
Most of these AEs were reactogenicity events (general disorders and administration site conditions and 
headache) and were considered related to vaccination. Two events of lymphadenopathy were reported, 
lymphadenopathy is already listed as an adverse reaction in the SmPC. Two events of immediate AEs 
were reported: fatigue and injection site pain. Three events of severe pyrexia were reported. From 
Dose 3 and up to the cut-off date (=3 Nov 2022), SAEs were reported by 6 participants 
(depression/worsening of depression and suicidal ideation/suicidal attempt, pectus excavatum, elbow 
fracture and skull fracture), none of the events were considered related to vaccination. No subjects 
were withdrawn due to AEs. 
The results presented for participants aged 12-15 years supports the proposed update of the SmPC 
section 4.8.

Additional Pharmacovigilance Activities 
Study BNT162-01 was completed and final CSR was submitted on 07 August 2023 (Procedure 
EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0187). Study BNT162-01 is an interventional EU safety study addressing Use in 
immunocompromised patients. 
Study WI235284 was completed, and final CSR was submitted on 30 June 2023 (Procedure 
NEMEA/H/C/005735/II/0186/G). Study WI235284 is a US low-interventional effectiveness study 
addressing Vaccine effectiveness. 
Study C4591001 was completed, and final CSR is submitted on 09 August 2023 (Procedure 
EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0188/G, i.e., this procedure). Study C4591001 is a global interventional safety 
study addressing Use in frail patients with comorbidities (C4591001 subset) and long term safety data. 
Consequently, these studies have been removed from part III.2 Additional Pharmacovigilance Activities 
and part III.3 Summary Table of Ongoing and Planned Additional Pharmacovigilance Activities (not 
reproduced in this AR). 
PRAC Rapporteur’s Overall conclusions on the PhV Plan  
The proposed post-authorisation PhV development plan is sufficient to identify and characterise the 
risks of the product. 
8.3.  Risk minimisation measures 
This section has been updated based on the changes made in PART III. 
PRAC Rapporteur’s Overall conclusions on risk minimisation measures 
The proposed risk minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the 
proposed indication(s). 
8.4.  Overall conclusion on the RMP 
The MAH took the opportunity before the Opinion to update the version of the RMP to 11.0, and the 
sign off date to October 2023, as per the recommendations in the EMA guidance. 
The changes to the RMP are acceptable. 
9.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this group of variations, section 4.8 of the SmPC are being updated to reflect data on 
booster dose administration into adolescent participants between 12 and 15 years of age. 
Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information.

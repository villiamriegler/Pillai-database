2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Elebrato Ellipta is indicated as maintenance treatment to prevent and relieve symptoms associated with 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
2.1.1.  Epidemiology  
COPD is strongly linked to tobacco smoking, particularly cigarette smoking and is a male predominant 
condition, in COPD clinical trials in developed countries generally about two thirds of included patients are 
male and for both males and females the average age tends to be in the early sixties. In poor countries the 
male predominance is not as marked as women may develop COPD as a result of cooking over open fires. 
The prevalence is quite variable on a local basis with higher prevalence linked to lower affluence and social 
status. Screening would be possible by mass measurement of lung function which is cheap, easy, and 
non-invasive, but is not done in practice. There have been no substantial trials of the value of screening for 
COPD.  Tobacco smoking cessation or non/never smoking is an effective measure and societal efforts have 
been made in that direction rather than into screening programmes.  
2.1.2.  Biologic features 
COPD is characterised by cough, excess sputum production, airways narrowing leading to air trapping and 
hyperinflation of the chest, and loss of lung tissue (emphysema). In its more advanced stages it causes 
strain and eventually failure, of the cardiac right ventricle. 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Clinical presentation tends to be as cough and breathlessness in a heavy cigarette smoker and is unusual 
before approximately the age of forty.  
Exacerbations in COPD are driven by episodes of acute inflammation, usually following a viral or bacterial 
infection. While current maintenance therapies prevent exacerbations in many COPD patients, exacerbation 
events in others remain poorly controlled, resulting in frequent use of oral corticosteroids and antibiotics 
and, in many cases, recurrent hospital admissions. This is particularly exemplified in a sub-population of 
patients termed frequent exacerbators. Despite treatment, some patients do not regain their baseline lung 
function following an exacerbation and repeated events can lead to an accelerated decline in lung function, 
resulting in a worsening overall quality of life for patients and a significant burden on healthcare resources. 
The prognosis in terms of morbidity and mortality is directly linked to the extent of lung damage. 
2.1.4.  Management 
Management is through smoking cessation, pharmacological intervention with bronchodilators and 
anti-inflammatory agents and, when necessary treatment of respiratory infections, physical rehabilitation is 
aimed primarily at muscle strengthening, and in advanced cases long term domiciliary oxygen 
administration is helpful and has a proven benefit on lung function. Some patients are suitable for lung 
volume reduction surgery to reduce non-gas exchanging thoracic space. Once developed the condition is 
only partly reversible so more treatment options are always welcome.

different site. The first step of the manufacturing process may be performed at an alternative site. The 
manufacturing process uses a commercially available well defined starting material with acceptable 
specifications.. The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is 
considered to be comparable to that produced by the proposed commercial process. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, the starting material and reagents have been presented and are satisfactory. The 
characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised. 
Specification

months under long term conditions (25ºC/60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 
ºC/75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  No trends or out of specification results were 
observed for any of the stability-indicating parameters tested: fluticasone furoate content, drug-related 
impurities, water content, particle-size distribution and solid-state form.  
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on six production scale batches. 
Stability data on four commercial scale batches (3 micronised and 1 non-micronised) under stress conditions 
for up to 3 months at 25 ºC /80% RH, 40 ºC /75% RH and 50 ºC /ambient humidity for micronised active 
substance and up to 3 months at 25 ºC /80% RH and 40 ºC /75% RH for non-micronised active substance 
have been provided. The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed 
supplier is sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 60 months when 
stored in the proposed container at a temperature not exceeding 30 °C and protected from light.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Figure 3 Umeclidinium bromide manufacturing process 
A detailed description of the manufacturing process of umeclidinium bromide has been provided. The 
manufacturing process has been developed using a combination of conventional univariate studies and 
elements of Quality by Design (QbD) such as risk assessment, design of experiment (DOE) studies, 
identification of potential critical process parameters (CPPs) that might have an impact on the critical quality 
attributes (CQAs) of the active substance.  
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the clinical 
development program. Pivotal batches of umeclidinium bromide were produced using the proposed 
commercial process. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Specification 
The micronised umeclidinium bromide specification is part of the wider control strategy whereby CQAs are 
appropriately  controlled,  by  first  intent,  at  their  point  of  origin  or  where  this  has  not  been  possible,  by 
appropriate  tests  and  acceptance  criteria  in  the  active  substance  specification.  The  active  substance 
specification includes tests for the following CQAs: description (visual), identity and solid state form (IR), 
umeclidinium  bromide  content  (HPLC),  drug-related  impurities  (HPLC),  particle  size  distribution  (laser 
diffraction), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), residue on ignition (sulphated ash).  
Assessment report  
EMA/25056/2018 
Page 13/106 
  
  
 
 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.  
Batch analyses data on sixteen production scale batches (eight of micronised active substance and eight of 
e  non-micronised  active  substance)  have  been  provided.  The  results  are  within  the  specifications  and 
consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from six  commercial scale batches (three of 50 kg and three of 15 kg) of the micronised active 
substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package for up to 60 months 
under intermediate conditions 40 ºC/75% RH were provided. Accelerated stability data on three commercial 
scale  batches  (50kg  batch  size)  of  micronised  active  substance  from  the  proposed  manufacturer  stored 
under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC/75% RH were also submitted. No significant changes were observed 
for description, content, drug-related impurities, water content, particle size or solid state form by XRPD in 
batches stored for up to 60 months at 30 °C/65% RH or for up to 6 months at 40 °C/75% RH. All results 
complied with the specification.  
Stress testing was performed on one commercial scale batch of micronised and on one commercial scale 
batch of non-micronised umeclidinium bromide under different storage conditions: 50°C/ambient humidity 
for 3 months, freeze/thaw conditions of -20°C and 30°C under 7 day cycles and under 40°C/75% RH for 3 
months. Photostability testing, following the ICH guideline Q1B was also performed  
All stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 60 months from the date of manufacture of 
the non-micronised umeclidinium bromide when stored in the proposed container up to  30°C. 
Vilanterol trifenatate

The chemical structure of vilanterol trifenatate was elucidated by spectroscopic analysis of the primary 
reference standard. The solid state properties of the active substance were measured by proton and carbon 
NMR, MS, IR, elemental analysis and X-ray crystallography. 
Vilanterol trifenatate is size reduced prior to finished product manufacture.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Pivotal batches of vilanterol trifenatate were produced using the proposed commercial process. 
A  detailed  description  of  the  manufacturing  process  has  been  provided.  .  The  specifications  and  control 
methods  for  intermediate  products,  starting  materials  and  reagents  have  been  presented  and  are 
satisfactory.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised.  
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for the following CQAs: description (visual), identity (IR), 
vilanterol  trifenatate  content  (HPLC),  drug-related  impurities  (HPLC),  ,  particle  size  distribution  (laser 
diffraction)  together  with  additional  tests  for  enantiomer  content  (chiral  HPLC),  residual  solvents  (GC), 
water content (KF), and residue on ignition.  
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  non-compendial  methods  have  been 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. 
Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been 
presented. 
Batch  analysis  data  have  been  provided  for  12  production  scale  batches  of  non-micronised  vilanterol 
trifenatate manufactured using the commercial process. From these batches, up to 51 batches of micronised 
vilanterol trifenatate have been produced and analysed. All batches tested were found to comply with the 
pre-defined  specifications.  The  results  demonstrate  that  the  active  ingredient  can  be  manufactured 
reproducibly.  
Stability 
Stability data from 6 commercial scale batches of micronised vilanterol and two commercial scale batches of 
non-micronised vilanterol from the proposed manufacturers stored in a container closure system 
representative of that intended for the market for up to 60 months under long term conditions (25 ºC/60% 
RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC/75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines 
were provided. The following parameters were tested: description, vilanterol trifenatate content, impurities, 
enantiomer content (GSK907117C), water content, particle size distribution of the micronised and 
non-micronised active substance (laser diffraction), SSA of the non-micronised active substance and of the 
micronised vilanterol trifenatate (nitrogen gas adsorption), solid state form (XRPD) and melting 
point/amorphous content (DSC). Overall, no significant changes on stability were observed in any of the 
parameters tested.  
Data  on  one  commercial  scale  batch  of  micronised  and  one  commercial  scale  batch  of  non-micronised 
vilanterol trifenatate under stress conditions (50°C/ambient humidity; freeze/thaw, photostability testing)

have been provided. Furthermore, additional stress testing studies were conducted in the solid state (14 
days at 80 ºC under ambient and 75% relative humidities) and in solution at 60 ºC and under acidic, basic 
and oxidative conditions.   
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable.  The  stability  results  justify  the  proposed  retest  period  of  60  months  for  micronised  vilanterol 
trifenatate when stored up to 25°C protected from light, in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Elebrato Ellipta is a pre-dispensed inhalation powder which is supplied in the Ellipta inhaler. The inhaler contains 
two foil-laminate blister strips: one strip contains pre-dispensed doses of 100 µg fluticasone furoate; the second 
strip contains pre-dispensed doses of 62.5 µg umeclidinium (as bromide) and 25 µg vilanterol (as trifenetate). 
On actuation, the inhaler releases the contents of the two blisters, on each of the blister strips. This provides a 
delivered dose to the patient of 92 µg of fluticasone furoate, 55 µg of umeclidinium (as bromide) and 22 µg of 
vilanterol (as trifenatate) in each inhalation. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and routinely used for this pharmaceutical form; their 
quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product 
formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The qualitative and quantitative composition of Elebrato Ellipta is presented in Table 4 below.

The formulation used during clinical studies is the same as that intended for marketing. 
The pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements and reference to quality risk 
management, as described in ICH Q8, Q9, Q10.  
Extensive  prior  knowledge  gained  from  the  development  of  similar  inhaled  dry  powder  Ellipta  products 
containing the same active substances at the same dose was used to inform the development of the formulation 
and its manufacturing process. Based on the experience gained with the Ellipta products platform, the applicant 
decided to formulate the active substances in two separate powders for inhalation within a single inhaler. One 
strip contains a blend of micronised fluticasone furoate and lactose monohydrate and has the same composition 
as the marketed product, Relvar Ellipta. The second strip contains a blend of micronised umeclidinium bromide, 
micronised vilanterol trifenatate, magnesium stearate and lactose monohydrate. The umeclidinium/vilanterol 
blister strip formulation is based on those established for the individual umeclidinium and vilanterol blister strips 
used within approved Ellipta products.  
A  comprehensive  series  of  product  characterisation  studies  has  been  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  EU 
‘Guideline 
on 
the 
pharmaceutical 
quality 
of 
inhalation 
and 
nasal 
finished 
products’ 
(EMEA/CHMP/QWP/49313/2005 Corr). The Ellipta inhaler consists of a light grey body, beige mouthpiece cover 
and a dose counter, packed into a foil laminate tray containing a desiccant sachet. The tray is sealed with a 
peelable foil lid. The inhaler is a multi-component device composed of polypropylene, high density polyethylene, 
polyoxymethylene,  polybutylene  terephthalate,  acrylonitrile  butadiene  styrene,  polycarbonate  and  stainless 
steel. 
The inhaler contains two aluminium foil laminate blister strips that deliver a total of 14 or 30 doses (14 or 30 day 
supply).  Each  blister  in  one  strip  contains  fluticasone  furoate,  each  blister  in  the  other  strip  contains 
umeclidinium (as bromide) and vilanterol (as trifenatate). 
The secondary pack for Elebrato Ellipta is identical to the secondary pack currently used with the authorised 
products  Relvar  Ellipta  and  Anoro  Ellita.  The  secondary  pack  has been  shown  to  be capable of maintaining 
satisfactory storage conditions for the product; it is sufficiently robust to withstand the stresses likely to be 
encountered during transport of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of four main steps: manufacture of the fluticasone furoate blister strip 
(fluticasone  furoate  blending  and  filling),  manufacture  of  the  umeclidinium/vilanterol  blister  strip 
(umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol trifenatate blending and filling), assembly of the inhaler, and packing.  
As part of the QbD approach used in the development of Elebrato Ellipta, the attributes of intermediates and the 
process  parameters  that  could  potentially  affect  finished  product  CQAs  were  investigated.  CPPs,  in-process 
controls and on-line tests have been identified. The in-process controls are adequate for the manufacturing of a 
pre-dispensed inhalation powder. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  type  of  dosage  form: 
description,  identification  of  fluticasone  furoate,  umeclidinium,  and  vilanterol  (UV);  mean  content  of 
fluticasone  furoate,  umeclidinium,  and  vilanterol  (HPLC);  uniformity  of  delivered  dose  (for  fluticasone 
furoate, umeclidinium, and vilanterol) (HPLC); fine-particle mass of fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium, and 
vilanterol  (NGI);  microbiological  quality  (by  control  of  water  activity  or  by  enumeration/identification  of 
microbial colonies).

Batch analysis results are provided for eight production-scale batches of Elebrato Ellipta, comprising four 
batches of the 30-dose and four batches of the 14-dose pack sizes. All of these batches were manufactured 
using the commercial process at the intended site of manufacture. All eight batches complied fully with the 
proposed release specification, confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to 
manufacture according to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three commercial batches of finished product stored for up to 18 months under long term 
conditions  (25ºC  /  60%  RH)  and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated  conditions  (40  ºC  /  75%  RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The registration stability batches have blister strips that are 
identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. 
The inhaler used in all the stability studies is representative of the commercial product, the only difference 
being the colour of the mouthpiece cover, and this is accepted.  
Instead of the standard intermediate storage condition of 30 °C / 65 % RH, as defined in ICH Q1A (R2), a 
more challenging condition of 30 °C / 75 % RH was used. No significant changes were observed in three 
commercial scale batches in relation to the following tests at the 12-month time point:  
In-use stability studies were conducted on three commercial batches following removal of the secondary 
packaging  (foil  laminate  tray,  lid  and  desiccant)  at  the  initial  time  point  and  following  storage  under 
long-term conditions When the secondary packaging was removed, the unprotected inhalers were stored at 
25 °C/75 % RH for 3 months.  
The applicant has provided additional stability data under stress storage conditions.  On one commercial 
batch stored at 50 °C and ambient relative humidity for three months, One commercial batch was subjected 
to a freeze/thaw cycle consisting of 6 hours storage at -5 °C followed by 6 hours storage at 40 °C for one 
month.  
In conclusion, the physical and chemical changes observed at the different storage conditions were small, 
and not likely to have a significant effect on efficacy and safety of the product when used according to the 
directions in the SmPC. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months and 6 weeks after opening the tray at 
the following condition ‘Do not store above 30 °C’ as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those 
used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of 
ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of 
Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The information provided on Elebrato Ellipta reflects the requirements of the applicable EU directives and 
guidelines.  
All three active substances (fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium bromide and vilanterol trifenatate) have 
previously been approved for use with the Ellipta inhaler and the information submitted on their synthesis, 
specifications and stability in this application is consistent with the information provided in earlier marketing 
authorisation applications for related Ellipta products. This provides good assurance that active substances

of satisfactory quality can be consistently produced. The primary and secondary container closure (including 
the inhaler) are also identical to those used for currently authorised Ellipta products, except that the colour 
of the mouthpiece cover is product-specific.  
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substances and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity 
of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The information provided on the finished product indicates that the formulation, method of manufacture, 
and specifications are adequate to ensure that a product of satisfactory quality will be consistently produced.  
Adequate data has been provided in support of the stability of the product at the proposed shelf life. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give 
reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical package contains literature data.  
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The  present  MAA  is  a  fixed  dose  combination  of  100  µg  fluticasone  furoate  (FF),  62.5  µg  umeclidinium 
bromide (UMEC) and 25 µg of vilanterol (VI) in accordance with Article 10(b) of Directive 2001/83/EC as 
amended. 
Fluticasone  Furoate/Umeclidinium  bromide/Vilanterol,  Inhalation  Powder  (FF/UMEC/VI)  combines  an 
inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (GW685698) with a long acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) (GSK573719) 
and a novel long-acting β2 agonist (LABA) (GW642444).   
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
The application composed of non-clinical data based on bibliographic literature substituting/supporting 
certain tests or studies. 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Fluticasone furoate (GW685698) 
Fluticasone  furoate  (GW685698)  is  a  synthetic  corticosteroid  with  potent  anti-inflammatory  action.    It 
targets the human glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a ligand-activated transcription factor that regulates an 
extensive  network  of  gene  products  which  profoundly  regulate  pro-inflammatory  cytokines  in  airway 
inflammatory cells. 
Glucocorticoid receptor binding 
Assessment report  
EMA/25056/2018 
Page 19/106 
  
  
In vitro, GW685698 bound with high affinity to the human glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and with significantly 
greater affinity than  fluticasone propionate, budesonide and dexamethasone  and dissociates very slowly 
from the receptor. X-ray crystal analysis of the GR ligand binding domain revealed that in the GW685698 
structure,  the  furoate  substituent  fully  occupied  a  17α  pocket  making  a  number  of  hydrophobic  packing 
interactions  with  the  side  chains  lining  the  pocket  which  was  more  significant  than  that  seen  with  the 
fluticasone  propionate  structure  (Report  RR2006/00018/00).  The  difference  in  receptor  affinity  between 
GW685698 versus fluticasone propionate may be due to increased hydrophobic packing interactions in the 
17α pocket. 
Glucocorticoid receptor functional assays 
Activated GR affects a number of downstream pathways via a transrepressive mechanism - inhibiting the 
function of certain transcription factors such as Nuclear Factor κB (NFκB) and Activated Protein-1 (AP-1), or 
through  a  transactivation  mechanism  where  the  GR  binds  directly  to  DNA  to  cause  an  increase  in  the 
transcription of certain gene products [Barnes, 1998]. The influence of GW685698, the primary metabolite 
of GW685698 - GW694301X (M10), and a number of other clinically used steroids on these downstream 
signalling pathways was assessed in a variety of in vitro cellular assays. 
The  transrepressive  effects  of  GW685698,  its  major  metabolite  GW694301X  (M10)  and  a  number  of 
clinically used steroids were investigated in NFκB and AP-1 assays. In the NFκB assay, the ability of the test 
compounds to inhibit tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced NFκB function was assessed in human A549 
(caucasian  lung  carcinoma)  cells  transfected  with  a  vector  containing  the  secreted  alkaline  phosphatase 
(SPAP) gene driven by a fragment of the ELAM promoter containing binding sites for NFκB. In the AP-1 
assay, the ability of the test compound to inhibit epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced AP-1-dependent 
increases in luminescence was assessed in human A549 cells transfected with a vector containing the firefly 
luciferase gene driven by the minimal interleukin (IL)-2 promoter containing AP-1 binding sites. 
GW685698 was found to potently inhibit TNFα-induced NFκB function and an EGF-induced AP-1-dependent 
increase in luminescence, with comparable potency to fluticasone propionate and mometasone furoate. The 
metabolite GW694301X (M10) showed only very weak activity in functional assays (>6000-fold weaker than 
GW685698) and will therefore contribute negligible glucocorticoid activity in vivo. 
In the NFκB inhibition assay, GR694301X was found to be a less potent agonist (pEC50 6.5 ± 0.2; n=10) 
than other steroids tested and between 1000- to 10000-fold weaker than GW685698 depending on assay 
dilution  conditions,  therefore,  the  metabolite  is  unlikely  to  contribute  to  steroidal  activity  at  therapeutic 
doses. 
The effect of GW685698 and a number of clinically used steroids on the pro-inflammatory NFkB transcription 
factor pathway was further examined in the human lung A549 epithelial cell line using an improved steroid 
dilution  methodology  which  avoided  loss  of  test  compound  through  precipitation.  A549  cells  expressing 
SPAP were incubated with test compound and TNFα for 15 hours, and the activation of the NFκB transcription 
pathway was measured spectrophotometrically as previously performed. 
TNFα-induced NFκB function was inhibited by GW685698 with comparable potency to fluticasone propionate 
and mometasone furoate. GW685698 also produced a maximal inhibitory response similar to that seen with 
fluticasone propionate and mometasone furoate. Budesonide, another clinically used glucocorticoid, had a 
substantially weaker potency for the inhibition of TNFα-induced NFκB function than GW685698. GW694301X 
(M10) showed only very weak activity in this assay (>10000-fold weaker than GW685698). 
The  differences  observed  in  the  NFκB  EC50  inhibition  values  between  the  studies  amounts  to  the  new 
methodology  employed  in  the  various  reports  where  precipitation  of  the  compound  is  prevented  thus 
prohibiting a loss of compound and an overestimation of the test compound’s concentration and therefore an 
underestimation of potency.

EMA/25056/2018

Transactivation effects of GW685698, GW694301X (M10) and several clinically used glucocorticoids were 
investigated  in  human  lung  epithelial  cell  lines  using  2  different  glucocorticoid  response  element  (GRE) 
transactivation assays. In addition, a rat liver cell assay was used to examine transactivation activity of the 
test  compounds  in  an  endogenous  GRE  system  using  the  classical  GRE-driven  gene  product  tyrosine 
aminotransferase (TAT) assay. 
Overall, GW685698 potently increased transactivation in the human GRE, MMTV-GRE and endogenous TAT 
assays, with comparable potency to fluticasone propionate and mometasone furoate. GW694301X (M10) 
showed  only  very  weak  activity  in  the  MMTV-GRE  and  endogenous  TAT  tests,  i.e.,  8000-  to  11000-fold 
weaker than GW685698, consistent with the NFκB data. 
GW685698 was found to potently inhibit the TNFα-induced release of IL-8 from the bronchial cells (IC50 = 
3.5  pM)  with  comparable  potency  to  fluticasone  propionate  (IC50  =  7.25  pM)  and  mometasone  furoate 
(IC50  =  5  pM).  Flunisolide  and  budesonide  had  far  higher  IC50  values  of  590  and  48  pM,  respectively, 
demonstrating their weaker GR activity. 
GW685698  has  the  greatest  inhibitory  potency  for  TNF  release  from  LPS-activated  human  primary 
peripheral  mononuclear  cells  in  vitro  compared  to  clinically  used  inhaled  glucocorticoids  fluticasone 
propionate, budesonide, ciclesonide active principle (CAP) and prednisolone. pIC50 values are as follows: 
GW685698, 9.93; fluticasone propionate, 9.63; budesonide, 8.41; CAP, 8.5; prednisolone, 7.23. 
In a series of in vitro functional assays examining the duration and rate of action of GW685698 compared to 
fluticasone propionate, sustained inhibition of cytokine synthesis (IL-6, IL-8 and GM-CSF) was achieved with 
GW658698  and  was  also  accompanied  by  a  longer  duration  of  action  compared  to  other  clinically  used 
steroids. 
In  monolayer  of  human  lung  epithelial  (16HBE14o-)  cells,  GW685698  had  a  greater  tissue  retention 
compared to fluticasone propionate as well as a greater level of binding to a suspension of sliced human lung 
tissue. 
In  examining  the  protective  effects  of  steroids  on  airway  epithelial  barrier,  GW685698  demonstrated  a 
highly efficacious cellular protection from protease induced damage with a potency greater than that seen 
with  fluticasone  propionate,  mometasone  furoate  and  other  clinically  used  steroids.  Furthermore, 
GW685698 was more potent in inducing a decrease in epithelial permeability. 
The selectivity of GW685698 for the GR over a number of other steroid receptor subtypes was examined in 
vitro.  GW685698  was  highly  selective  for  the  human  GR  over  other  human  steroid  hormone  receptor 
subtypes. Selectivity ranged from approximately 32- to >300000-fold, and was similar to that seen with 
fluticasone  propionate  and  substantially  better than  that  seen  with  mometasone  furoate  and  ciclesonide 
active principle. W694301X (M10) had no affinity at the AR, ERα or ERβ receptors and displayed no activity 
in  the  MR  antagonist  assay  up  to  a  concentration  of  1  mcM.  GW694301X  (M10)  displayed  low  but 
measurable affinity for the PR receptor. However, this was at least 100-fold less than GW685698 and was 
therefore considered unlikely to contribute to any significant activity at this receptor. 
In vivo Studies – Anti-inflammatory activity 
The effect of GW685698 in the delayed type hypersensitivity model of ear inflammation was investigated in 
female  BALB/c  mice  and  male  Lewis  rats  (Report  SH2002/00044/00).  GW685698  dose-dependently 
inhibited ear swelling induced by oxazolone sensitisation in mice and rats. When compared to fluticasone 
propionate, GW685698 exhibited comparable or superior anti-inflammatory activity in these models. 
The effect of GW685698 was further evaluated in a Brown Norway lung eosinophilia model which measures 
an allergic inflammation of the lung by systemic sensitisation with 1 mg ovalbumin and inhaled challenge 
with 100 ng/ml ovalbumin aerosol characterised by a profound eosinophilia. GW685698 was associated with 
a  dose-dependent  inhibition  of  lung  eosinophilia  in  this  model  (n=4  rats/group).  Significant  inhibition  of 
Assessment report  
EMA/25056/2018

eosinophilia  was  achieved  after  a  single  dose  of  30  mcg  and  the  response  was  significantly  greater 
(p=0.016) than that seen with an equivalent dose of fluticasone propionate (75% inhibition with GW685698 
vs  50%  inhibition  with  fluticasone  propionate).  A  long  anti-inflammatory  duration  of  action  was  also 
observed  in  this  model,  with  intratracheal  administration  of  100  mcg  of  GW685698  demonstrating  68% 
inhibition of inflammation when given 14 hours prior to ovalbumin challenge. 
Finally,  the  inhibitory  effects  of  GW685698  on  antigen-induced  nasal  symptoms  (sneezing  and  nasal 
rubbing)  was  compared  to  that  of  fluticasone  propionate  following  intranasal  administration  to  actively 
sensitised male Wistar rats. GW685698 showed a significant and dose-related inhibitory effect on antigen 
induced nasal symptoms (sneezing and nasal rubbing) of comparable potency to fluticasone propionate but 
with a longer duration. 
Umeclidinium (GSK573719) 
Umeclidinium  (GSK573719)  is  a  long-acting  muscarinic  antagonist  (LAMA).  Muscarinic  antagonists 
competitively inhibit the binding of acetylcholine with M3 muscarinic cholinergic receptors on airway smooth 
muscle with consequent bronchodilation. M3 receptor antagonism in sub-mucosal glands results in reduction 
in airway obstruction. 
The primary pharmacology studies conducted with Umeclidinium (GSK573719) showed that the product has 
an antagonist activity against all 5 human mAChRs in CHO cells with affinity values in the sub-nM range. In 
addition, saturation, association and dissociation binding studies showed that UMEC display a high affinity 
for receptor subtypes mAChR-3 and mAChR-2. 3H- Umeclidinium associated faster and had a faster t½ with 
the mAChR-2 receptor compared with the mAChR-3 receptor. In studies conducted with mAChR-1, -2 and -3 
it was shown that UMEC is a competitive inhibitor of the three receptor subtypes in vitro. Lastly, a study 
conducted with the human metabolites GSK1761002 (M33) and GSK339067 (M14) showed that M33 is a 
functional inhibitor of mAChR-1 and mAChR-3 in vitro, about ~10-fold less potent than Umeclidinium, while 
GSK339067  has  negligible  pharmacological  activity.  GSK1761002A  (M33)  and  GSK339067A  (M14)  were 
shown to have no direct stimulatory effect at any of the mAChR tested. 
In  vivo,  umeclidinium  blocked  the  MCh-induced  bronchoconstriction  in  a  dose-dependent  and  sustained 
manner with UMEC producing 50% or greater inhibition for up to 72 hours when administered intranasally. 
In  addition,  UMEC  dose-dependently  blocked  the  bronchoconstriction  in  guinea  pigs  after  intratracheal 
instillation, in a sustained and dose-dependent manner. 
Vilanterol (GW642444) 
Vilanterol (GW642444) is a novel long-acting β2 agonist which targets the human beta adrenergic receptor.  
The human beta adrenergic receptor is coupled to Gs proteins which activate adenylate cyclise to form cyclic 
AMP  from  ATP.  This  cAMP  produces  relaxation  of  airway  smooth  muscle  through  modification  of  muscle 
regulatory proteins and changes in intracellular calcium concentration and is independent of the contracting 
agent.  Selective β2-agonists stimulate the β2-adrenoceptors on the airway smooth muscle, resulting in 
bronchodilation. 
In vitro studies 
Radioligand  binding  studies  were  performed  to  investigate  the  binding  kinetics  of  3H-GW642444  (as  the 
triphenylacetate salt, GW642444M) in membranes prepared from either transfected Chinese hamster ovary 
(CHO) cells expressing the human beta2-receptor or from human lung parenchyma. GW642444 binds to the 
human beta2-receptor with  high affinity coupled with fast K (pKD range 9.44  to 10.8) similar to that of 
salmeterol  and  higher  than  R,R-formoterol  and  indacaterol.  Competition  binding  curves  for  a  range  of 
beta2-receptor agonist and antagonists were completed against 3H-GW642444. The pKi values determined 
were in good agreement with literature values generated against antagonist radioligands. 3H-GW642444M

demonstrates a fast koff from the low affinity receptor state and a moderately slow koff from the high affinity 
receptor state at ambient temperature. 
GW642444 (as the acetate salt, GW642444A) was assessed in a variety of in vitro functional assays and its 
potency  compared  with  that  of  salmeterol  and  R,R-formoterol  (beta2-receptor  agonists)  or  isoprenaline 
(non-selective beta-agonist). 
GW642444  caused  a  concentration-dependant  pigment  dispersal  in  melatonin  pre-treated  frog 
melanophores expressing the beta2-receptor. GW642444 was found to be a potent agonist at the human 
beta2-receptor with a slightly greater potency than salmeterol and similar potency to R,R-formoterol and 
isoprenaline (log half-maximal effective concentration (pEC50) 9.3, 8.8, 9.4 and 9.1, respectively). 
In functional adenyl cyclase assays utilising CHO cells stably expressing human beta2-receptors, GW642444 
had a similar potency to salmeterol. In the CHO cells stably expressing the human beta2 adrenoceptors (at 
levels which allow for partial agonists to be discriminated), GW642444 has an intrinsic activity greater than 
salmeterol but lower than R,R-formoterol. The effects of GW642444 were also antagonised by propranolol 
and sotalol in a competitive manner, with the dissociation constant pKbs obtained being similar to those 
against salmeterol (estimated pKb values for propranolol [9.6 and 9.7] and sotalol [7.3 and 7.3] against 
salmeterol  and  GW642444,  respectively).  These  data  indicate  that  GW642444  and  salmeterol  act  as 
orthosteric agonists at the human beta2-receptor. 
GW642444 (as the acetate salt, GW642444A and the triphenylacetate salt, GW642444M) was assessed in 
vitro in a Luciferase reporter gene selectivity assay or a TR-FRET LANCE cAMP assay in CHO cells stably 
expressing  human  beta1-,  beta2-  and  human  beta3-receptors.  Its  potency  compared  with  that  of 
salmeterol,  R,R-formoterol  and  indacaterol  (beta2-receptor  agonists)  or  isoprenaline  (non-selective 
beta-agonist). GW642444 demonstrated similar selectivity to salmeterol for beta2 over human beta1 and 
human beta3-receptors. GW642444 was significantly more selective than R,R-formoterol and indacaterol 
against human beta1 and human beta3-receptors. 
In  assessing  the  potency  and  duration  of  action  of  GW642444,  GW642444  caused  a  concentration 
dependent  increase  in  the  TR-FRET  LANCE  cAMP  assay  carried  out  in  CHO  cells  expressing  recombinant 
beta2-receptors. GW642444, salmeterol and indacaterol showed long persistence of action (duration) at the 
beta2-receptor following washout in contrast to R,R-formoterol which shows a significant washout profile, 
indicating a lack of duration in this assay. 
Potency  and  duration  of  action  of  GW642444  was  also  assessed  using  guinea  pig  trachea  and  human 
bronchus. GW642444 was shown to be a potent and selective beta2-receptor agonist on the guinea pig 
isolated  superfused  (electrically  stimulated)  trachea  (pEC50  =  7.87).  GW642444  was  similar  in  potency 
(pEC50 = 7.68) and duration to salmeterol and around 30-fold weaker than R,R-formoterol. GW642444 has 
a  more  rapid  onset  than  salmeterol  and  similar  to  R,R-formoterol  (half  onset  time  [Ot50]  values  of  6.6 
minutes, 25 minutes and 13 minutes, respectively). The effects of GW642444 on guinea pig trachea were 
antagonised  by  propranolol  and  sotalol  in  a  competitive  manner.  Reassertion  studies  with  sotalol  were 
consistent with CHO cell assays and support a long duration of action. Studies with GW642444 on human 
isolated bronchus tissues stimulated with either prostaglandin F2alpha or methacholine showed a similar 
potency and duration profile to that seen in guinea pig trachea. 
The  beta1-  and  beta2-agonist  activity  of  GW642444  (as  the  triphenylacetate  salt,  GW642444M),  its 
S-enantiomer  (GSK907117),  4  human  metabolites  (GW630200  [M29],  GSK932009  [M33],  GSK1676112 
[M20]  and  GW875428  [M40])  and  a  further  potential  metabolite  GW853734,  was  evaluated  in  TR-FRET 
LANCE  assay  measuring  cAMP  production  in  recombinant  CHO  cells  expressing  human  beta1-  or 
beta2-receptors.  The  GW642444  metabolites  GW630200  (M29)  and  GSK932009  (M33)  were  at  least 
2500-fold less potent than GW642444 on the beta2-receptor, and the metabolites GW875428, GSK1676112 
and GW853734 were poorly active with intrinsic activity ~30%, 70% and 50%, respectively, at beta2. The 
Assessment report

GW642444  S-enantiomer  was  around  60  times  less  potent  at  beta2  than  GW642444.  Pharmacological 
activity against the beta2-receptor was negligible for the other GW642444 metabolites tested. None of the 
metabolites  tested  or  the  S  enantiomer  showed  any  notable  pharmacological  activity  against  the 
beta1-receptor. 
In vivo activity 
The bronchoprotective effects of GW642444 over time were assessed using histamine challenge in conscious 
male  and  female  guinea  pigs  (up  to  8/sex).  Airway  responsiveness  was  measured  using  whole  body 
plethysmography. GW642444 was a potent and long-acting inhibitor of histamine induced bronchospasm in 
the conscious guinea pig when administered by the inhaled route (nebulised aerosol). GW642444 had a 
similar potency to salmeterol and at an equi-effective (EC90) dose the duration of action of GW642444 was 
similar to salmeterol. 
Repeat dosing studies (once daily/4 days at EC90) induced tachyphylaxis, manifest by a parallel rightward 
shift in the dose-response curve which amounted to an approximate 4-fold reduction in potency pretreated 
with GW642444. This tachyphylaxis was considered surmountable and was evidenced near the top of the 
dose-response  curve.  Repeated  exposure  to  GW642444  daily  for  5  days  at  the  EC90  also  caused  a 
statistically significant decrease in the duration of action from 10 hours to <4 hours. 
No  pharmacodynamic  studies  were  performed  on 
the 
fixed  dose  combination 
fluticasone 
furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol  as  there  is  sufficient  data  available  for  each  compound  which  was

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Fluticasone Furoate/Umeclidinium/Vilanterol 
No  secondary  pharmacodynamic  studies  were  performed  on  the  fixed  dose  combination  fluticasone 
furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol  as  there  is  sufficient  data  available  for  each  compound  which  was 
considered acceptable. 
Fluticasone furoate (GW685698) 
The secondary pharmacodynamic effects of GW685698 were investigated in male CD rats intratracheally 
dosed with vehicle, GW685698 (10 and 100 mcg) or fluticasone propionate (10 and 100 mcg) once daily for 
3 days, since thymus involution is a documented index of systemic side effects of glucocorticoids. Thymus 
showed  a  weight  reduction  of  21.6  and  20.4%  with  GW685698  and  fluticasone  propionate  at  10  mcg, 
respectively. At 100 mcg, the reduction was of 67% with GW685698 and of 78% with fluticasone propionate, 
respectively. 
Umeclidinium (GSK573719) 
In vitro secondary pharmacodynamics studies were conducted with a battery of 50 receptors, ion channels, 
enzymes  and  transporters.  UMEC  showed  affinity  for  the  kappa  opioid  receptor,  sigma  receptor,  Ca2+ 
channel,  Na+  channel  and  dopamine  transporter.  In  guinea  pigs,  UMEC  did  not  consistently  affect 
ACh-induced  bradycardia.  Considering  the  high  selectivity  of  UMEC  for  the  mAChRs  and  the  low  plasma 
concentrations (as a consequence of the low concentration of inhaled dose), it is unlikely that UMEC would 
interact  in  vivo  with  these  receptor  proteins.  Furthermore,  the  neurobehavioral  effects  associated  with 
activity at opioid and dopamine receptors have not been observed in preclinical safety studies. 
As UMEC is a pan-active mAChR antagonist there is a potential for UMEC to have activity at extra-pulmonary 
muscarinic receptors (e.g., cardiac mAChR-2). However, based on local delivery to the lungs, the proposed 
low  dose  and  the  poor  oral  bioavailability  of  UMEC,  the  Applicant’s  conclusion  that  activity  will  likely  be 
restricted  to  the  airway  is  plausible.  Available  in  vivo  data  support  this  as  no  effect  on  ACh-induced 
Assessment report

bradycardia was seen following intratracheal dosing of UMEC (0.25 or 2.5 mcg) in guinea pigs suggesting 
that there was little or no systemic exposure to M2 receptors on the myocardium of the heart. Based on 
these data the Applicant calculated that UMEC had a therapeutic window of at least 10 fold between the 
desired  bronchodilatory  effect  (mAChR-3)  and  adverse  cardiovascular  effects  (mAChR-2)  such  as 
bradycardia. 
Vilanterol (GW642444) 
In  in  vitro  studies  the  selectivity  of  GW642444A  (1  mcM)  for  7-transmembrane  (7TM)  receptors,  ion 
channels and transporters was assessed in radioligand binding assays. An in vivo secondary pharmacology 
study  has  been  performed  to  assess  the  effect  of  inhaled  doses  of  GW642444A  and  salmeterol  on 
cardiovascular parameters in conscious guinea pigs. 
Safety pharmacology 
Fluticasone Furoate/Umeclidinium/Vilanterol 
FF, UMEC and VI alone, and UMEC/VI in combination, have undergone evaluation in safety pharmacology 
studies.  When  administered  as  a  single  agent  FF  did  not  affect  any  cardiovascular,  respiratory  or  CNS 
parameters.  Effects  on  the  cardiovascular  system  were  seen  with  the  use  of  UMEC  and  VI  separately, 
however, when used in double combinations there was no exacerbation of effects compared to the individual 
components.  Safety  pharmacology  studies  have  not  been  conducted  with  the  FF/UMEC/VI  triple 
combination. The Applicant argues that the safety pharmacological profile of FF is separate and distinct from 
UMEC/VI  and  that  therefore  no  (adverse)  interaction  between  FF,  UMEC  and  VI  is  anticipated.  This 
argumentation  is,  however,  not  in  line  with  the  available  literature  which  provides  evidence  for 
(potentiating) pharmacodynamic interactions between ICS and LABA. However, since the non-clinical safety 
profile of the FF/UMEC/VI triple combination has been evaluated in a 13-week inhalation repeat dose toxicity 
study in dogs (see Section 3.2.3 of this AR) and taking into account the clinical safety data available for the 
FF/UMEC/VI  triple  combination,  the  lack  of  safety  pharmacology  studies  with  the  triple  combination  is 
acceptable. 
Fluticasone furoate (GW685698) 
Several  safety  pharmacology  studies  were  performed  to  evaluate  the  effects  of  GW685698  on  central 
nervous, cardiovascular and respiratory systems. 
In vivo studies 
Conscious  male  Wistar  Han  rats  were  administered  with  single  dose  of  vehicle  or  GW685698 
subcutaneously.  Effect  on  central  nervous  system  (locomotor  coordination,  skeletal  muscle  tone  and 
reflexes), autononomic nervous system (pupil size, lacrimation, salivation, overt cardiovascular endpoints 
and  urination),  as  well  as  on  respiration  rate  and  gastrointestinal  tract,  were  evaluated  for  the  first  30 
minutes after dosing and at 1, 2, 4, 24 and 48 hours after drug administration.

In vitro studies 
Effect on QT interval. Purkinje fibre assay: 
The effects of up to 2200 pg/mL of GW685698 on cardiac action potential, including action potential duration 
at  60  and  90%  (ADP60  and  ADP90),  resting  membrane  potential,  maximum  rate  of  depolarisation  and 
upstroke amplitude, were studied using isolated dog Purkinje fibres.  
In vivo studies 
Rat:  The  effect  of  a  single  subcutaneous  dose  of  GW685698  on  cardiovascular  function  was  studied  in 
conscious rats implanted with telemetry transmitters, measuring the mean arterial pressure, heart rate, 
body temperature and spontaneous locomotor activity from approximately 2 hours prior to dosing to at least 
14 days post dose.  
Dog:  A  study  was  performed  to evaluate  the  effects  of  the  intravenous  administration  of  GW685698  on 
cardiovascular function in the conscious dogs and to select a suitable dose for the second study. Systolic, 
diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure, pulse pressure, heart rate and Lead II electrocardiogram were 
monitored.  
In the second study, vehicle or GW685698 were administered on separate days using a crossover design to 
2 male and 2 female beagle dogs. Also in this study, systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure, 
pulse pressure, heart rate and Lead II electrocardiogram were monitored.

The effects of GW685698 on respiratory function were assessed in conscious  male Sprague Dawley rats 
subcutaneously dose with vehicle, 1000 mcg/kg carbamylcholine chloride (positive control) and GW685698 
at a dose of 4000 or 10000 mcg/kg. Respiratory rate, peak inspiratory and expiratory flows, inspiration and 
expiration times, minute volume and tidal volume were measured continuously for 4 hours post dose and for 
1 hour periods between 23 and 24 hours and 47 and 48 hours post dose.  
Umeclidinium (GSK573719) 
The in vivo safety pharmacology study on central and peripheral effects in rats showed dilated pupils in few 
animals. A single inhaled dose of UMEC (215 or 2206 μg/kg) produced reversible increases in respiratory 
rate (18 to 45%) and concurrent decreases in tidal volume (3 to 17%) with no apparent effect on minute 
volume during the exposure. The Applicant considers that this finding could be related to the pharmacology 
of  Umeclidinium.  As  it  is  known  that  increasing  bronchoconstriction  generally  causes  a  slower  deeper 
breathing pattern, it would be reasonable to assume that bronchodilation could lead to a more rapid, shallow 
breathing  pattern  to  optimize  mechanical  efficiency.  Direct  lung  function  was  not  measured  during  the 
repeat  dose  inhaled  toxicity  program  on  Umeclidinium  in  both  rats  and  dogs.  However,  given  that  the 
changes  observed  were  minimal  and  reversible,  an  altered  breathing  pattern  was  only  detected  at  high 
doses  in  the  dog  in  dose  ranging  studies  and  is  considered  to  be  procedure-related  and  no  histological 
changes in the lung indicative of altered lung compliance or airway obstruction were observed. The Applicant 
considers that the reversible minimal effect observed is not of concern for humans. As expected, changes in

ventilatory  parameters  with  UMEC  are  observed  in  clinical  trials  in  COPD  patients  and  are  regarded  as 
beneficial. 
Umeclidinium  inhibited  hERG  channel  tail  current  in  vitro  and,  as  expected  from  the  pharmacology  of 
muscarinic antagonists, caused a number of cardiovascular effects (increases in heart rate, prolongation of 
PR together with transient second degree AV block of Mobitz Type I followed by a decrease of RR interval). 
In the general toxicology studies, treatment with Umeclidinium caused tachycardia in dogs.

Rat: Conscious male Sprague Dawley rats were intravenously administered with single dose of vehicle or 
GW642444H.  Animals  were  observed  for  peripheral  and  central  nervous  systems  activities  (e.g.,  motor 
activity, behaviour, co-ordination, somatic sensory/motor reflex responses and automatic responses such as 
piloerection,  pupil  size,  lachrymation,  salivation,  overt  cardiovascular  and  gastrointestinal  effects)  and 
potential effects on body temperature.  
In other study also performed in conscious male Sprague Dawley CD rats, GW642444M was administered as 
a single dose via snout-only inhalation. Animals were subjected to neurobehavioural observations using a 
standard  observation  battery,  quantitative  motor  activity  evaluations  and  the  recording  of  body 
temperature. Body temperature and neurobehavioural endpoints were monitored before dosing (to obtain 
baseline measurements), and subsequently at 1.25, 3 and 9 hours from the start of exposure while motor 
activity was evaluated before the dosing and at 1.25, 9 and 25 hours from the start of the exposure.

In vitro studies 
Effects on QT interval. hERG assay: The potential capacity of GW642444H to inhibit hERG tail current was 
evaluated  by  whole  cell  patch  clamp  method  in  HEK-293  cells  stably  transfected  with  hERG  cDNA.  Peak 
hERG tail current amplitude was measured prior to and following exposure to GW642444H, DMSO, (vehicle) 
or E-4031 (0.1 mcM; an inhibitor of hERG tail current) using 4 to 5 cells/concentration.  
Effect on QT interval. Purkinje fibre assay: In other in vitro study using beagle dog isolated Purkinje fibres, 
the  effects  of  642444H  on  cardiac  action  potential,  including  action  potential  duration  at  60  and  90% 
repolarization  (ADP60  and  ADP90),  resting  membrane  potential  (RMP),  maximum  rate  of  depolarisation 
(MRD) and upstroke amplitude (UA) was examined. All mentioned parameters were measured at 1 and 0.5 
Hz, except MRD that was measured at 3 Hz in the presence of vehicle or GW642444 at 100 mcM.  
In vivo studies 
Dog: GW642444H was administered intravenously to conscious male beagle dogs to evaluate their effects 
on  arterial  pressures,  heart  rate,  and  electrocardiograph  parameters.  Cardiovascular  function  and  ECG 
parameters were monitored via telemetry from 30 minutes prior to dosing, during the 1 minute infusion 
period and for 4 hours after dosing.  
In conscious male beagle dog was also evaluated the effects of GW642444M in the cardiovascular function 
and  ECG  parameters.  Systolic,  diastolic  and  mean  blood  pressure,  pulse  pressure,  heart  rate  and  ECG 
parameters  were  monitored  via  telemetry  from  30  minutes  before  dosing,  during  the  1  minute  infusion 
period and for 4 hours after dosing. ECG waveforms were observed for any abnormal changes in rhythm or 
morphology.

the  respiratory.  The  tidal  volume,  respiratory  rate  and  minute  volume  were  respiratory  parameters 
evaluated and measured prior to dosing, continuously during the 1 hour and for approximately 1 hour at

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Validated  methods  of  analysis  were  employed  to  quantify  FF,  UMEC  and  VI  in  dog  plasma  using 
HPLC-MS/MS. 
A range of nonclinical pharmacokinetic studies has been performed in order to support administration of FF, 
UMEC and VI, separately or in combination, for the treatment of patients with COPD and/or asthma. These 
studies have been  also reviewed as part of the approved marketing authorisation applications (MAAs) for 
RELVAR  (FF/VI),  ANORO  (UMEC/VI)  and/or  INCRUSE  (UMEC)  ELLIPTA  products.    A  summary  of  the 
pharmacokinetics for FF, UMEC and VI was provided.

The applicant has performed a toxicokinetics study as part of the repeat dose toxicity studies in which the 
triple combination (FF/UMEC/VI) was administered to dogs once daily for 13 weeks via oropharyngeal tube 
inhalation and systemic exposures were compared to each of the individual components administered alone. 
Absorption 
Fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol 
The pharmacokinetics of FF, UMEC and  VI in combination were assessed in a repeat dose toxicity study 
(Study 2013N169979) conducted in beagle dogs for 13 weeks. FF, UMEC and VI alone or in combination as 
a powder aerosol formulation at a ratio of 4:5:1, respectively, was administered by inhalation. In general, 
there was no consistent difference in systemic exposure (AUC0-t or Cmax) to any test article on any of the 
sampling occasions across the duration of the study. For FF or VI, when co-administered with the other test 
articles, systemic exposure (AUC0-t and Cmax) increased approximately proportionally with dose. For UMEC 
co-administered with FF and VI, Cmax increased approximately proportionally with dose. The AUC0-t for 
UMEC was variable between the sampling occasions, however, the AUC0-t consistently increased with an 
increase  in  dose.  Generally  across  the  study  there  was  no  consistent  difference  in  systemic  exposure 
between the sexes; however, systemic exposure to UMEC was consistently higher in males than in females. 
The  pharmacological  properties  of  each  single  mono-component  described  in  the  literature  have  been 
described below for convenience.  
Fluticasone furoate (GW685698) 
Absorption  of  GW685698  from  the  lung  following  inhalation  administration  was  moderately  rapid  in  all 
non-clinical species (mouse, rat, rabbit, dog), Tmax being generally up to 1.5 hours after the end of the 
inhalation period or sooner. GW685698 was well absorbed in the rat and dog following oral administration 
with oral absorption estimated as at least 30 and 19% respectively, based on the recovery of drug related 
material (DRM) in bile and urine in bile-duct cannulated (BDC) animals. In the rat, rabbit and dog, however, 
oral systemic exposure to GW685698 was limited by its negligible oral bioavailability - approximately 1% or 
lower when dosed as a suspension. The low oral absolute bioavailability of GW685698 is most likely due to 
extensive first pass metabolism. Oral absorption of GW685698 in human, as in animals, was good with at 
least 30% of the administered dose absorbed following oral administration of 14C-GW685698 in solution 
based  on  a  comparison  of  radioactivity  AUC0-t  values  following  oral  and  intravenous  administrations. 
Corresponding  human  oral  bioavailability,  as  in  animals,  was  low  (approximately  1%),  mediated,  as  in 
animals, by extensive first pass metabolism of orally absorbed drug. 
In single i.v. dose pharmacokinetic (PK) studies, PK profiles were comparable in both genders among all 
species  examined  (rat,  rabbit,  dog  and  human).  High  clearance  and  large  volume  of  distribution  was 
achieved indicating extensive distribution to all tissues. 
Following  a  single  subcutaneous  administration  in  rat  and  dog,  GW685698  had  a  long  apparent  plasma 
half-life (approximately 25 and 160 hours in rat and dog, respectively) suggesting absorption rate limited 
elimination. This is consistent with formation of a depot which provided sustained release of GW685698 into 
the systemic circulation over a long period of time. Animals dosed by subcutaneous administration may have 
prolonged exposure compared to animals or humans dosed by inhalation administration and are thought to 
explain the delayed effects observed in the safety pharmacology study. 
In repeat dose inhalation studies in mouse, rat, rabbit and dog for up to 39 weeks, 58 weeks, 2 weeks and 
39  weeks,  respectively,  Inter-animal  and  inter-study  variability  of  systemic exposure  to  GW685698  was 
high  as  is  typical  following  inhalation  administration.  The  mean  data,  however,  consistently  showed  the 
same trends between studies. 
Systemic exposure to GW685698 following inhalation administration to mice, rats, rabbits, dogs and human 
increased  with  increasing  dose,  in  either  a  proportional  or  less  than  dose-proportional  manner.  Overall, 
Assessment report  
EMA/25056/2018 
Page 33/106 
  
  
there was little evidence of accumulation of GW685698 in animals on repeated administration with less than 
2-fold change in systemic exposure reported following repeated administration on the majority of studies. 
Small  increases  were  occasionally  reported  in  the  rat  and  dog.  Accumulation  of  GW685698  following 
repeated  inhalation  administration  to  human  was  also  less  than  2-fold.  Systemic  exposure  was  typically 
similar in males and females in the mouse, rat, rabbit, dog and human. Tmax usually occurred immediately 
following  the  end  of  the  dosing  period  (nominally  1  hour  in  duration)  in  all  species.  The  addition  of 
magnesium stearate as an excipient in rat and dog vehicle formulations did not influence the toxicokinetics 
of GW685698. 
Umeclidinium (GSK573719) 
Absorption  of  GSK573719  from  the  lung  following  inhalation  administration  was  rapid  in  all  non-clinical 
species. Systemic exposure to UMEC following inhalation administration to mice, rats, rabbits, dogs and 
humans  increased  with  increasing  dose  in  an  approximately  proportional  manner.  Cmax  was  usually 
detected immediately after the administration in all species, indicating rapid absorption across the lung. 
Vilanterol (GW64244) 
Absorption  of  GW642444  from  the  lung  following  inhalation  administration  was  rapid  in  all  nonclinical 
species with Tmax generally at the first sample taken after the end of the inhalation period. Oral absorption 
of 14C-GW642444 was good in both rat and dog with at least 37% and 56% orally absorbed in BDC rats and 
intact  dogs,  respectively.  Oral  bioavailability  of  GW642444,  however,  was  low  in  the  rat  (1.1%)  and 
moderate in the dog (29.7%). Hepatic portal vein plasma concentrations of GW642444 in mice and rats 
suggest that first-pass hepatic clearance limits oral bioavailability in these species. Oral bioavailability in the 
rat is, therefore, limited mainly by first pass hepatic clearance as well as incomplete absorption. The higher 
oral  bioavailability  (and  lower  blood  clearance,  see  table  below)  in  the  dog  suggests  that  a  greater 
proportion  of  the  swallowed  component  escapes  first  pass  hepatic  clearance  and,  as  a  result,  the  oral 
component  in  the  dog  is  likely  to  make  a  larger  contribution  to  systemic  exposure  following  inhalation 
administration. 
Oral absorption of GW642444 in human, as in animals, was good with at least 50% orally absorbed based on 
urinary  recovery  of  DRM  following  administration  of  14C-GW642444  in  solution  (Study  B2C106181). 
Exposure to GW642444 represented a very small percentage (in the region of <0.5%) of DRM in plasma 
indicating that the low human oral bioavailability (< 2%), was mediated by extensive first pass metabolism. 
Differences in blood clearance of GW642444 was observed in rat, dog and human and ranged from moderate 
in the rat (35% of rat liver blood flow of 90 mL/min/kg), lower in the dog (26% of dog liver blood flow of 40 
mL/min/kg  )  and  high  in  human  (>  human  liver  blood  flow).  The  steady state  volume  of  distribution  of 
GW642444  was  high  in  the  rat  and  human  but  moderate  in  the  dog,  exceeding  total  body  water  in  all 
species. 
In repeat dose inhalation studies using dry powder formulations, systemic exposure to GW642444 (AUC0-t 
and  Cmax)  increased  with  increasing  dose  in  a  proportional  or  less  than  dose-proportional  manner; 
subproportionality was generally associated with higher doses. There was little evidence of accumulation of 
GW642444 exposure with time, although increased AUC0-t values were occasionally observed upon repeat 
dosing in some of the rat studies. Overall, there were no marked changes in systemic exposure between 
males and females in the mouse, rat or dog. There were no marked changes in systemic exposure with time 
or  gender,  following  repeated  administration  of  GW642444  in  human.  Tmax  was  generally  at  the  first 
sample time after the end of the inhalation period indicating rapid absorption across the lung. A comparison 
of  the  systemic  exposure  to  GW642444  achieved  in  pivotal  toxicity  studies  and  in  humans  following  its 
administration at the proposed commercial dose is seen in the table below. Exposure to GW642444 in animal 
toxicity studies was considerably greater (in most cases) than following proposed dose of GW642444 to 
human.

Inclusion of magnesium stearate as an excipient in rat and dog vehicle formulations for inhalation studies did 
not result in notable changes to systemic exposure. 
Systemic  exposure  (AUC0-t  and  Cmax)  to  GI179710  (the  triphenylacetate  counter-ion  of  GW642444M 
triphenylacetate salt) following inhalation administration of GW642444M increased proportionally with dose 
in  rats  and  dogs  but  less  than  proportionally  in  the  mouse.  In  the  rat,  there  was  some  evidence  for 
accumulation on repeat dosing but not in the mouse or dog. Overall, in the majority of studies, there were 
no differences in systemic exposure between genders. 
In repeat dose clinical studies where asthma and COPD patients were administered at doses of up to 50 mcg 
GW642444M, concentrations of GI179710 were below the limits of quantification (1 ng/mL) in the majority 
of  subjects.  Cmax  concentrations  of  GI179710  on  repeat  dose  inhalation  toxicity  studies  (mean  of 
males/females over whole study at the highest dose level administered) were > 1000 ng/mL in the mouse 
and rat and > 200 ng/mL in the dog and pregnant rabbit. Large systemic exposure ratios for GI179710, 
relative to human, have, therefore been established in toxicology studies. 
Systemic exposure (AUC0-t and Cmax) to Human  metabolites GW630200 (M29) and GSK932009 (M33) 
generally increased with increasing dose in either a proportional or less than  dose-proportional manner. 
Mouse, rat and dog were all exposed to both metabolites with metabolite:parent ratios (based on AUC0-t) of 
0.002 to 0.01 for GW630200 (M29) and 0.02 to 0.08 for GSK932009 (M33). No consistent difference in 
exposure to metabolites was observed between males and females. 
In repeat dose clinical studies where asthma and COPD patients were administered doses of up to 50 mcg 
GW642444M by the inhalation route, concentrations of GW630200 (M29) and GSK932009 (M33) were below 
the limits of quantification (0.09 and 0.18 ng/mL, respectively) in the majority (99.8%) of subjects. Cmax 
concentrations of GW630200 (M29) and GSK932009 (M33) observed in nonclinical repeat dose inhalation 
toxicity studies (at the highest dose level administered as recommended in ICH M3(R2) were > 0.7 ng/mL 
for GW630200 (M29) and > 3 ng/mL for GSK932009 (M33) in the rat, mouse and dog. Mice, rat and dogs 
have, therefore, been exposed to higher concentrations of these metabolites compared to human. 
Distribution 
Fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol 
The binding of FF, UMEC and VI to human liver microsomal protein was investigated in vitro, approximately 
72%, 47% and 40% respectively was bound to protein following equilibration.  
The substrate potential of FF and VI in vitro was assessed by measuring the time dependent transport of 
[14C]-labelled FF or VI in BCRP, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 expressing vesicles or cells. The substrate potential 
of UMEC in vitro was assessed by measuring the time-dependent transport of [14C]-labelled UMEC in BCRP, 
BSEP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1 and/or OAT3 expressing vesicles or cells. Solute carrier (SLC) transporter 
expressing  cells  (S2  and  HEK293  cells),  as  well  as  ATP  binding  cassette  (ABC)  transporter  expressing 
vesicles or cells (LLC-PK1 cells), were utilized. 
Data from previous submissions where FF was demonstrated to inhibit the OATP1B1 transporter, UMEC was 
demonstrated to be an in vivo substrate for the human organic cation transporters OCT1 and OCT2, but not 
OCT3, OCTN1 or OCTN2. VI was shown not to be an in vitro substrate for the transporters OCT1, OCT3, 
OCTN1 or OCTN2. 
FF  (weak  substrate  only),  UMEC  and  VI  are  in  vitro  substrates  for  the  human  transporter  protein 
P-glycoprotein (P-gp) which is consistent with the limited or lack of distribution of drug-related material into 
the  central  nervous  system  (CNS)  observed  in  the  quantitative  whole  body  autoradiography  (QWBA) 
studies. 
The PK properties relating to each monocomponent are provided below based on literature data.

Fluticasone furoate (GW685698) 
Protein Binding: 
The  plasma  protein  binding  characteristics  of  3H-GW685698  were  determined  using  an  ultrafiltration 
method. The mean binding of 3H-GW685698 was found to be high (>99.5 in dog, rabbit, mouse and human; 
>97% in rat) and showed no concentration-dependence across the range of 0.2 to 5 ng/mL. Plasma protein 
binding at the lowest concentration investigated (0.2 ng/mL) was 96.4, 99.6, 99.6, >99.5 and >99.6% in 
rat, dog, rabbit, mouse and human, respectively. 
In  a  second  study,  plasma  protein  binding  characteristics  of  3H-GW685698  was  determined  using 
ultracentrifugation. In all species tested, the binding of 3H-GW685698 to plasma proteins was moderate (75 
to 93%) and similar across the 3H-GW685698 concentration range used (0.2 to 5 ng/mL). No apparent 
sex-related differences were observed in the plasma protein binding of 3H-GW685698 in humans. 
In a study examining the binding properties of 14C-GW685698 (20 to 250 ng) in selected human plasma 
proteins,  fresh  human  plasma  and  protein  solutions,  binding  was  comparable  to  that  seen  in  the 
ultrafiltration method.  The extent of binding in albumin solution and α1-acid glycoprotein solution was high 
being  96%  and  90%,  respectively.  The  extent  of  binding  to  γ-globulin  was  low  at  33%.  There  was  no 
evidence  of  any  concentration-dependent  binding  of  14C-GW685698  across  the  concentration  range 
employed.  
Whole blood distribution: 
Blood samples collected from male mice, rats, rabbits, dogs and humans were utilised in a study of the 
distribution of 3H-GW685698 in whole blood. The blood to plasma concentration ratios were similar for each 
species and no concentration-dependent blood cell association was observed across the concentration range 
of 0.2 to 5 ng/mL. In all species investigated, 3H-GW685698 had a higher association for plasma than for 
blood cells. Percentage associated with cellular fraction ranged from 6 to 23%. As the concentration in blood 
is lower than the corresponding plasma concentration, the clearance in vivo from the blood will be higher 
than  that  from  plasma.  No  apparent  sex  related  differences  were  observed  in  the  blood  distribution  of 
3H-GW685698 in humans. 
Whole blood distribution of radioactive 14C-GW685698 was also examined in dogs. 14C-GW685698 was 
administered intravenously (infusion over 30 minutes) to male beagle dogs (n=3) at a dose of 100 mcg/kg, 
as  a  0.1  mg/mL  solution  in  PEG  400:  8%  w/v  2-hydroxypropyl  β-cyclodextrin  solution  (aqueous)  (1:3). 
Radioactivity was assessed in the excreta and also in plasma and whole blood taken from each dog at various 
time points up to 96 hours after dosing. Whole blood concentrations of total radioactivity were lower than 
those  observed  in  the  corresponding  plasma  samples  at  all  time  points  investigated.  Mean  whole 
blood:plasma  radioactivity  concentration  ratios  ranged  from  0.64  to  0.74.  These  data  indicated  that 
circulating radioactivity was predominantly associated with the plasma fraction. 
Membrane transporter inhibition studies: 
GW685698 and GW694301X (M10) inhibited human OATP1B1 in a stably transfected CHO-OATP1B with cell 
line  with  calculated  IC50  values  of  0.2  and  2.6  mcM  (0.11  and  1.4  mcg/mL),  respectively.  In  contrast, 
GW685698  and  GW694301X  (M10)  did  not  inhibit  transport  of  digoxin  by  human  P-gp  by  polarized 
Madin-Darby canine kidney MDCKII-MDR1 cells transfected with the human MDR1 gene (produces the P-gp 
protein) at concentrations up to 30 and 100 mcM (16 and 54 mcg/mL), respectively. Finally in an effort to 
determine if GW685698 was a substrate for human P-gp, the potential for P-gp to transport GW685698 was 
investigated using stable transfected MDCKII-MDR1 cells cultured as monolayers plus or minus an inhibitor 
of human P-gp (GF120918). The apparent passive permeability of GW685698 was moderate [P7.4 of 80 ± 
45 nm/s (mean ± SD)], indicating that it should diffuse across most membranes. The basal to apical efflux

ratio for GW685698 in the absence of GF120918 was 3 and this was reduced to 0.5 in the presence of the 
inhibitor, indicating that the compound was a substrate of P-gp. 
In vivo distribution studies: 
The  tissue  distribution  of  3H-GW685698  has  been  assessed  in  the  albino  and  pigmented  rat  using 
quantitative whole body autoradiography (QWBA) following iv and oral administration. 
In the first of three tissue distribution studies performed using the intravenous route of drug administration, 
pigmented  (Random  Hooded)  and  albino  (Wistar  Han)  male  rats  (n=5  and  15,  respectively)  received 
3H-GW685698  as  a  single  bolus  dose  of  133  mcg/kg.    The  vehicle  used  in  this  study  comprised  10% 
Cremaphor in saline. Rats were killed (n=1 and 3 for pigmented and albino, respectively) at 0.5, 1, 4, 24 and 
168 hours after dose administration, and QWBA performed. In general, radioactive drug-related material 
(DRM) was widely distributed throughout the tissues and most tissue radioactivity levels were higher than 
those found in the blood at 0.5 to 24 hours post dose. At 168 hours, tissue levels of radioactivity were only 
detectable (lower limit of quantification of 13 ng equi/g tissue), by QWBA, in the liver (40 ng equi/g of tissue) 
and kidney cortex (21 ng equi/g tissue in the region of proximal tubules). The highest levels of DRM were 
seen 0.5 hours after administration in the small intestine and small intestine wall, indicating extensive biliary 
clearance and secretion across the gastrointestinal tract wall. Levels in the lower large intestine rose later as 
might be expected from passage of gastrointestinal contents. Levels of DRM in the stomach and stomach 
wall were also high at the early time points. This may indicate transfer of a weakly acidic metabolite into the 
stomach. Tissue half-lives of radioactivity in liver, blood and kidney (cortex) as determined over 24 to 168 
hours after intravenous administration ranged from 90 to 170 hours. DRM was not detectable (lower limit of 
quantification of 13 ng equi/g tissue) in the uveal tract of the pigmented rats, indicating no notable binding 
to melanin had occurred for the parent or metabolites. The tissue distribution of radioactivity was similar in 
albino (WH) and pigmented (RH) rats. 
In the second intravenous whole body autoradiography study, 14C-GW685698 was administered as a bolus 
over approximately 30 seconds to 6 male pigmented rats (Lister Hooded) at a dose of 1000 mcg/kg. The 
vehicle used in this study comprised 40% polyethylene glycol 400 and 10% DMSO in saline. Single rats were 
killed at 1 and 4 hours, and 1, 3, 10 and 35 days post dose, and whole body autoradiography performed. 
Non-uniform levels of radioactivity were found in the liver, lung, spleen and bone marrow, particularly at 1 
and 4 hours and 1 and 3 days post dose, consistent with microcrystalline deposits of either undissolved or 
precipitated test material building up in the capillaries of the vascular system within the aforementioned 
tissues. Consequently, no quantification of the autoradiograms was performed in this study. This pattern of 
radioactivity  was  attributed  to  the  dosing  method  and  vehicle  employed  since  it  was  not  observed  in 
subsequent studies that utilised alternative vehicles and infusion dosing (up to 1 hour) and using similar 
doses. 
Qualitative assessment of the autoradiograms revealed that DRM was widely distributed in the tissues at the 
first sampling time (1 hour); that the highest concentrations of radioactivity were found at this time; and 
that  radioactivity  concentrations  declined  such  that  by  the  final  sampling  time  at  35  days,  no  tissues 
contained  visible  levels  of  radioactivity.  Compared  with  other  tissues,  the  brain  and  spinal  cord  only 
contained low levels of radioactivity at 1 and 4 hours post dose. Low levels of radioactivity were noted in the 
uveal tract/retina during the first 3 days post dose but radioactivity was no longer detectable at 10 days, 
suggesting no notable binding to melanin. 
To  overcome  the  precipitation  of  DRM  observed  in  the  previous  study,  the  study  was  repeated  with 
14C-GW685698 given as an infusion over a 30 minute period to 6 male pigmented rats (Lister Hooded) at a 
dose of 1000 mcg/kg. The vehicle used in this study comprised 10% Cremaphor in saline. Single rats were 
killed at 1 and 4 hours, and 1, 3, 10 and 35 days post dose, and QWBA performed. Radioactivity was widely 
distributed at 1 hour after the start of the infusion (first time point). Highest levels of radioactivity at this 
time were measured in the following organs, presented in descending order of radioactivity: mucosa of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/25056/2018 
Page 37/106 
  
  
small intestine, liver, Harderian gland, kidney cortex, preputial gland, adrenal cortex, exorbital lachrymal 
gland,  brown  fat,  intra-orbital  lachrymal  gland,  mucoas  of  the  caecum,  pancreas,  white  fat,  aortic  wall, 
epimysim  and  blood.  The  vast  majority  of  tissues  attained  their  highest  observed  concentrations  at  this 
time. Relatively low levels of radioactivity were associated with the brain, spinal cord and lens of the eye at 
1 and 4 hours post dose. Thereafter, radioactivity was not measurable (lower limit of quantification of 3 to 
5 ng equi/g tissue) in these tissues. By 10 days post dose, tissue concentrations of radioactivity had declined 
such that all values were either close to or below the limits of reliable quantification. At 35 days post dose, 
very low but quantifiable levels of radioactivity could be measured only in the spleen and blood. 
In examining distribution after oral administration, pigmented (Random Hooded) and albino (Wistar Han) 
male rats (n=5 and 15, respectively) received a single oral administration of 3H-GW685698 at a nominal 
dose of 133 mcg/kg. 
Rats were killed (n=1 and 3 for pigmented and albino, respectively) at 1, 4, 8, 24 and 168 hours post dose, 
and QWBA performed. There was limited distribution of radioactive drug-related material (DRM) into the 
tissues. The kidney, liver, spleen and gastrointestinal tract were the only tissues with higher levels than in 
the blood at 1 to 24 hours after dosing. This limited distribution contrasts with the findings after intravenous 
dosing and is probably due to relatively low absorption and rapid biliary clearance of the material that is 
absorbed. At 168 hours, radioactivity was only detectable, by QWBA, in the liver (17 ng equi/g tissue) and 
in the kidney cortex (18 ng equi/g tissue in the region of proximal tubules), as observed after intravenous 
dosing. The half-life of radioactivity in the liver, blood and kidney (cortex) of albino rats, measured over the 
period 24 to 168 hours post dose, ranged from between 70 to 110 hours. The levels of DRM in the blood were 
consistent  with  a  half-life of  <110  hours.  No  DRM  was  detectable  (lower  limit of  quantification  of  13  ng 
equi/g  tissue)  in  the  uveal  tract  of  pigmented  rats,  indicating  that  no  notable  binding  to  melanin  had 
occurred for the parent or metabolites. There was no apparent difference between DRM levels in albino and 
pigmented rats. 
Umeclidinium (GSK573719) 
The in  vitro plasma protein binding of UMEC was moderate in animals and human. Protein binding data 
obtained using plasma from renally or hepatically impaired human subjects was slightly higher to that in 
plasma from healthy subjects. Blood cell association of UMEC was low in nonclinical species and human. 
Protein  binding  and  blood  cell  association  for  UMEC  were  independent  of  concentration  over  the  range 
investigated. In addition, UMEC was shown to be a substrate of human P-gp and of human organic cation 
transporter  OCT1  and  OCT2.  These  transporters  are  predominantly  located  in  the  liver  and  kidney, 
respectively. This data is contraindicative of distribution into tissues, and suggestive of the involvement of 
an  active  transport  mechanism  in  the  distribution  of  UMECStudies  in  rats  showed  that  radioactivity  was 
rapidly and widely distributed following intravenous administration. Tissue concentrations decreased with 
time and were generally below the limit of quantification by 10 days after dosing. Highest concentrations or 
radioactivity  were  observed  in  liver  and  kidneys,  the  organs  associated  with  clearance  of  UMEC.  Some 
accumulation in the uveal tract and retina was detected. In addition, retention of UMEC in the lungs of mice 
was demonstrated for up to 24 hours following a single intranasal administration. 
Vilanterol (GW64244) 
Plasma Binding:  
In vitro plasma protein binding of GW642444 (parent form) was studied in rat, guinea pig, dog and human 
plasma using equilibrium dialysis. Plasma samples were incubated with 0.05 and 0.1 mcg/mL GW642444. 
The  dialysates  and  remaining  plasma  samples  were  analysed  for  GW642444  by  HPLC-MS.  Binding  of 
GW642444  to  plasma  proteins  was  moderately  high  in  rats  (84%),  guinea  pigs  (92%),  dog  (98%)  and 
human plasma (94%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/25056/2018 
Page 38/106 
  
  
In a second study, plasma protein binding of GW642444 (as the α-phenylcinnamate salt, GW642444H) was 
investigated at concentrations of 0.005, 0.025, 0.125 or 0.625 mcg/mL in mouse, rat, guinea pig, female 
rabbit, dog and human plasma by equilibrium dialysis. The concentration of GW642444 in the dialysate and 
dialysed plasma, along with the original (non-dialysed) plasma sample, was determined by HPLC-MS/MS. 
The extent of plasma protein binding was moderately high at levels >90%, and appeared to be consistent 
across  the  concentration  range  within  all  species  investigated.  The  mean  plasma  protein  binding  of 
GW642444 was 94.3, 92.3, 98.9, 93.4, 98.7 and 97.2% in the mouse, rat, guinea pig, female rabbit, dog 
and human, respectively. 
Finally, protein binding of GW642444 (2 ng/mL as the triphenylacetate salt, GW642444M) was investigated 
by ultrafiltration in incubations with human serum albumin (40 mg/mL), α-acid glycoprotein (0.8 mg/mL) 
and  γ-globlin  (7  mg/mL)  dissolved  individually  in  phosphate  buffered  saline  (Report  2011N118910_00).  
GW642444  was  moderately  bound  to  human  serum  albumin  (60.3%)  and  α-acid  glycoprotein  (60.8%), 
whereas the extent of binding to γ-globlin was low (7.9%). 
A study was also performed to examine the in vitro protein binding of 14C-GI179710 (the counter ion of 
GW642444M  triphenylacetate  salt  -  0.05,  0.2  and  0.5  mcg/mL  )  in  mouse,  rat,  rabbit,  dog  and  human 
plasma using equilibrium dialysis. The mean plasma protein binding of 14C-GI179710 was 95.0, 96.5, >99, 
97.1 and 97.7% in the mouse, rat, rabbit, dog and human, respectively. Extent of binding was high and 
appeared to be consistent across the concentration range investigated within each species. 
Whole Blood Distribution 
In an in vitro blood cell distribution study, GW642444 (0.1 mcg/mL) was shown to have a low moderate 
association with the cellular fraction of rat and human blood (58 to 63% in rat; 35 to 36% in human). The 
blood:plasma ratio following 30 minutes incubation was 1.5:1 and 0.85:1 for rat and human, respectively. 
Similarly  in  a  definitive  study  conducted  during  drug  development,  the  blood  cell  association  of 
14C-GW642444 (parent form) was investigated at concentrations of 0.05, 0.2 and 0.5 mcg/mL in mouse, 
rat,  guinea  pig,  female  rabbit,  dog  and  human  plasma.  The  extent  of  blood  cell  association  was  low  to 
moderate and there was no evidence of any concentration-dependence on association. The mean blood to 
plasma ratios of 14C-GW642444 were 1.0, 1.1, 0.73, 1.0, 0.50 and 0.76 in the mouse, rat, guinea pig, 
female rabbit, dog and human, respectively. The corresponding mean blood cell association values were 
41.3, 55.9, 15.6, 41.4, 10.7 and 36.1%, respectively. 
For the counter ion of GW642444M triphenylacetate salt (0.05, 0.2 and 0.5 mcg/mL), mean blood to plasma 
ratios were 0.70, 0.63, 0.66, 0.49 and 0.60 in the mouse, rat, rabbit, dog and human, respectively. The 
corresponding  mean  percentage  blood  cell  association  values  were  16.8,  14.5,  <1,  7.4  and  4.4%, 
respectively.  Blood  cell  association  of  14C-GI179710  was  low  and  there  was  no  evidence  for  any 
concentration-dependence on association. 
P-glycoprotein transport and membrane permeability: 
GW642444  was  screened  in  Madin-Darby  canine  kidney  II  cell  line  transfected  with  human  MDR1  gene 
(MDCKII-MDR1) cells to assess whether it was a substrate for human P-gp. The bidirectional permeability of 
GW642444  (5  and  10  mcM),  from  basolateral  to  apical  (B→A)  and  apical  to  basolateral  (A→B),  was 
measured in the presence and absence of GF120918, a known inhibitor of P-gp. GW642444 was determined 
to be a substrate of human P-gp with B→A/A→B efflux ratios of 33.5 to 53.7 and 1.4 to1.5 in the absence 
and presence of GF120918, respectively. 
In  a  second  definitive  study,  the  potential  for  human  P-gp  to  transport  GW642444  (as  the 
α-phenylcinnamate salt, GW642444H - 0.5 mcM.) was investigated using stable transfected MDCKII-MDR1 
cells in the absence and presence of a potent P-gp inhibitor. GW642444 was a substrate of human P-gp 
(apical efflux ratio of GW642444 determined as ≥25.7 and 0.5 in the absence and presence of GF120918A, 
Assessment report  
EMA/25056/2018 
Page 39/106 
  
  
respectively). The passive membrane permeability of GW642444 (average P7.4) was of 34 ± 13 nm/s. A 
passive permeability of 34 nm/s is currently classified as a moderate permeability, although at the time of 
the  study,  it  was  classified  as  being  low  passive  permeability.  Poor  mass  balance  was  observed  for 
GW642444 and results from the assay should be interpreted with caution. 
P-glycoprotein inhibition: 
A study was performed to assess the ability of GW642444 (as the triphenylacetate salt, GW642444M) to 
inhibit  human  P-gp  mediated  transport  of  3H-digoxin  using  stable  transfected  MDCKII-MDR1  cell.  
GW642444 inhibited the transport of digoxin via human P-gp in vitro by 26% at the highest concentration 
tested (100 mcM). There was no evidence of inhibition at 30 mcM or below. As a result IC50 values could not 
be calculated but would be >100 mcM based on the data from this study. 
In vivo distribution studies: 
P-glycoprotein transport: 
In  a  pharmacokinetic  study  designed  to  provide  information  on  the  role  of  P-gp  in  attenuating  CNS 
penetration and oral absorption of GW642444, a single oral dose of GW642444 (as the triphenylacetate salt, 
GW642444M) at a target dose level of 1000 mcg/kg was administered to 21 male mdr1a/1b (knockout, KO) 
and 21 male FVBn (wildtype, WT) mice.   
GW642444  exposures  (based  upon  AUC0-t  values)  in  hepatic  portal  vein  (HPV)  plasma  were  generally 
similar  between  KO  and  WT  mice.  Systemic  concentrations  of  GW642444  and  GSK932009  (M33)  were 
higher in KO compared to WT mice (AUC0-t increases of 1.8- and 3-fold, respectively). In addition, the liver 
exposure to GW642444 was higher in KO mice versus WT mice (2.5-fold). In brain homogenate there was at 
least a 7.4-fold increase in the AUC0-t value of GW642444 in KO mice compared to WT mice. In conclusion, 
P-gp attenuated the CNS penetration of GW642444, but did not appear to play a major role in limiting its 
absorption.  The  role  of  P-gp  in  the  biliary  elimination  of  GW642444  and/or  its  metabolites  was  thought 
unlikely to be of biological importance. 
Blood, plasma, liver and lung and GI tract concentration 
As  part  of  the  excretion  studies  performed  with  14C-  GW642444  (as  the  α-phenylcinnamate  salt, 
GW642444H- 350 mcg/kg) via i.v or oral route in male Sprague Dawley rats, total radioactivity in blood, 
plasma,  lungs  and  liver  were  determined  for  up  to  96  hours  post  dose.    The  mean  blood:plasma 
concentration ratios of total DRM ranged from 0.8 to 1.1 following intravenous dosing and from 0.4 to 0.7 
following oral administration. These data indicate that radioactivity was predominantly associated with the 
plasma fraction. The mean liver:plasma ratios of DRM ranged from 17 to 21 following intravenous dosing 
and from 3 to 11 following oral administration. Similarly, lung:plasma ratios ranged from 4 to 22 and 0.6 to 
2 following intravenous and oral dosing, respectively. These data demonstrate a greater uptake of systemic 
DRM into the liver compared to lung. 
In  another  excretion  study,  the  concentrations  of  total  radioactivity  in  blood,  plasma  and  liver  were 
determined at a single sample time (48 hours post dose) following administration of a single intravenous or 
oral dose of 14C-GW642444 (1000 mcg/kg, nominal) to male BDC Sprague Dawley rats (n=3/group).  Mean 
blood:plasma concentration ratios of DRM were 0.7 (intravenous) and 0.9 (oral) corresponding to a blood 
cell association of 15% (intravenous) and 42% (oral), respectively. The mean liver:plasma concentration 
ratios of DRM for each dosing route were similar, approximately 12 (intravenous) and 8 (oral). 
Likewise, the concentration of total radioactivity in blood, plasma, lungs and  liver was determined in an 
excretion  study  following  administration  of  a  single  intravenous  or  single  oral  dose  of  14C-GI179710 
(counter ion of GW642444M triphenylacetate salt) at 500 and 1000 mcg/kg, respectively, to groups of male 
Sprague Dawley rats (n=3/group). The mean blood:plasma concentration ratios of DRM ranged from 0.5 to 
0.8 for both routes of administration. These data indicate that DRM was predominantly associated with the 
Assessment report  
EMA/25056/2018 
Page 40/106 
  
  
plasma fraction. Similarly, mean liver:plasma and lung:plasma ratios ranged from 6 to 27 and 0.5 to 0.9, 
respectively. These data demonstrate uptake of systemic DRM into the liver was greater than for the lung. 
Whole body distribution 
Whole  body  distribution  was  examined  in  rats  and  dogs  following  iv  and  oral  administration  of 
14C-GW642444.   
Pigmented  (Lister  Hooded)  male  rats  (n=6/group)  received  a  single  intravenous  (over  30  seconds) 
administration of 14C-GW642444 (as the α-phenylcinnamate salt, GW642444H) at a nominal dose of 350 
mcg/kg. Following intravenous dosing, rats were killed (n=1) at 15 minutes, 6 hours, and 1, 3, 10 and 35 
days post dose, and QWBA performed. DRM was widely distributed into tissues at 15 minutes post dose, with 
the highest observed concentrations for the vast majority of tissues occurring at this time.  The vast majority 
of tissues contained concentrations greater than that observed in blood. Highest concentrations of DRM at 
15  minutes  post  dose  were  observed  in  the  kidney,  adrenals,  choroid  plexus  and  thyroid.  The  highest 
observed concentrations for some tissues, including the Harderian gland, brown and white fat, preputial 
gland, seminal vesicles and pancreas, did not occur until 6 hours after dosing. DRM was also distributed into 
melanin containing tissues such as the eye and pigmented skin. Distribution into the brain or CNS was low 
following intravenous administration. Concentrations of DRM declined from the earlier time points and at 35 
days only the uveal tract/retina and testis contained quantifiable radioactivity.  
After Pigmented (Lister Hooded) male rats (n=6/group) received a single oral (gavage) administration of 
14C-GW642444 (as the α-phenylcinnamate salt, GW642444H) at a nominal dose of 350 mcg/kg, only a 
limited number of tissues contained quantifiable concentrations of radioactivity at any time point. Those that 
did included the kidney (cortex and medulla), liver, adrenal, salivary glands, brown fat, lung, uveal tract and 
the  mucosae  of  the  gastrointestinal  tract.  Other  than  the  gastrointestinal  tract,  no  tissue  contained 
quantifiable levels after 3 days. 
For the 14C-GI179710 counter ion (500 mcg/kg), DRM was widely distributed in Pigmented (Lister Hooded) 
male rats with the highest concentrations observed in the vast majority of tissues at the first sampling time 
(5 minutes) following iv administration. Highest concentrations were observed in the liver, tongue, kidney 
cortex, myocardium, pineal body, lung and bulbo-urethral gland. With the exception of various components 
of the gastrointestinal tract, all tissues attained their highest observed concentrations of DRM at 5 minutes 
after dosing. Tissue concentrations of DRM declined rapidly such that by 3 days post dose, concentrations in 
all  tissues  were  generally  below  or  close  to  the  limit  of  quantification  (0.003  mcg  equivalents  of 
GI179710/g). There was no evidence of association of DRM with melanin containing tissues, with no tissue 
containing a quantifiable concentration of radioactivity at 35 days post dose. 
Following oral dosing (gavage) of the 14C-GI179710 counter ion (500 mcg/kg) DRM was widely distributed, 
with highest concentrations of radioactivity observed in the vast majority of tissues at the first sampling time 
(30 minutes). The tissues containing the highest concentrations of DRM at this time (excluding components 
of  the  gastrointestinal  tract)  were  the  liver,  kidney  cortex,  tooth  pulp,  pancreas  and  tongue.  Tissue 
concentrations of DRM declined rapidly such that by 3 days post dose, concentrations in all tissues were 
generally below or close to the limit of quantification (0.003 mcg equivalents of GI179710/g). There was no 
evidence  of  association  of  DRM  with  melanin  containing  tissues,  with  no  tissue  containing  a  quantifiable 
concentration of radioactivity at 35 days post dose. 
Metabolism 
Fluticasone Furoate/Umeclidinium/Vilanterol 
No metabolism PK studies were performed on the fixed dose combination fluticasone 
furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol which was considered acceptable based on the data provided for the 
individual compounds.

Fluticasone furoate (GW685698) 
In vitro studies: 
In  vitro  studies  were  performed  using  hepatic  microsomes,  hepatocytes  and  heterologiusly  expressed 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes.   The major route of metabolism observed in  vitro, in all species,  was 
hydrolysis of the S-fluoromethyl carbothioate function to form the carboxylic acid, GW694301X (M10). 
There  was  no  evidence  of  metabolism  of  GW685698  by  human  lung  microsome  or  s9  preparations 
(WD2004/00004/00). GW685698 was metabolised in dog nasal s9 preparations but not metabolised in rat 
s9  nasal  preparations  or  human  CYP2A13  (a  CYP450  isoenzyme  known  to  be  present  in  human  nasal 
mucosa). 
In vivo studies: 
In  all  nonclinical  species  (mouse,  rat,  dog,  rabbit  and  human),  the  principal  route  of  metabolism  was 
hydrolysis of the S-fluoromethyl carbothioate to form a range of metabolites including GW694301X (M10).  
Umeclidinium (GSK573719) 
The metabolite profile of UMEC was evaluated in vitro and in vivo in several species, as well as in humans. 
The  main  routes  of  metabolism  were  oxidation  followed  by  conjugation  and  O-dealkylation.  All  the 
metabolites in human were also observed in at least one species used for nonclinical toxicology testing. In 
addition, the production of metabolites in human liver microsomes was shown to be mediated primarily by 
CYP2D6, with CYP3A4 and CYP1A1 playing minor roles. 
Vilanterol (GW64244) 
In vitro studies: 
In  vitro  studies  were  performed  using  hepatic  and  lung  microsomes,  hepatocytes  and  cytochrome  P450 
(CYP) screen. In microsomes from rats, dogs and humans, and lung microsomes from humans the in vitro 
clearance of GW642444 was high in rat (19 to 31 mL/min/g liver) and human liver microsomes (30 to 49 
mL/min/g  liver)  and  moderate  in  dog  liver  microsomes  (8  mL/min/g  liver).  Characterisation  of  human 
microsomal  drug-related  products  by  HPLC-MS  indicated  that  the  most  abundant  human  microsomal 
metabolite was GW630200 (subsequently referred to as M29).  
In human liver microsomes the predominant route of metabolism was O-dealkylation to M29 (GW630200). 
The  in  vitro  metabolism  of  GW642444  was  primarily  mediated  by  CYP3A4  with  minor  contributions  by 
CYP2D6.   
The in vitro turnover of GW642444 in human hepatocytes in 2 hours was 95% (1 mcM) and 81% (12.5 
mcM). At a concentration of 1 mcM the intrinsic clearance of GW642444 was 0.021 mL/min/106 cells (~2.5 
mL/min/g  liver).  The  major  route  of  metabolism  in  each  human  liver  hepatocyte  sample  studied  was 
O-dealkylation to M33 (GSK932009) and M29 (GW630200) which represented means of approximately 12 
and 24% of the total metabolism, respectively. These metabolites were also detected in rat and dog.   
The  major  metabolite  identified  in  rat  liver  hepatocytes  was  M12,  an  O-glucuronide  conjugate,  which 
represented approximately 40% of the metabolites assigned.  
The major metabolite identified in dog liver hepatocytes was M26 (C-dealkylation or oxidative loss of the 
salicyl alcohol) which represented approximately 43% of the metabolites assigned. 
The main route of metabolism of GI179710 in human hepatocytes was acyl glucuronidation, representing 
approximately  95%  of  the  total  metabolism.  Other  metabolites  resulted  from  para-hydroxylation/acyl 
glucuronidation and acyl glucose conjugation which represented 5% or less of the total metabolism. Acyl 
glucuronidation was prevalent in all nonclinical species (mouse, rat, female rabbit and dog) investigated (78 
Assessment report  
EMA/25056/2018

to 94% of the total metabolism). In general, metabolic profiles in nonclinical and human hepatocytes were 
qualitatively similar. The extent of metabolism of 14C-GI179710 was high in all species investigated. 
Finally, in a cytochrome P450 inhibition screen, the mean IC50 values for GW642444 were >100, >23, >70 
and 12 mcM for CYP450 1A2, 2C9, 2C19 and 2D6, respectively.  
In vivo studies: 
Following intravenous administration of 14C-GW642444 (α-phenylcinnamate salt) at 350 mcg/kg in male 
Sprague Dawley rats, the main routes of elimination of DRM were via the faeces (69% of the administered 
dose) and urine (19% of the administered dose).  
Elimination was largely by metabolism with the main routes being dealkylation (13% dose via M7, M26, M1, 
M3/30, M9), oxidation (22% dose via M34, M7, M30, M1, M9) and glucuronide conjugation (5% dose via M1, 
M3). 
 A further 13% of the administered dose was excreted as unchanged GW642444 in the faeces potentially 
resulting from either direct secretion of GW642444 or hydrolysis of the corresponding glucuronide.The main 
metabolites  were  by  glucuronidation  (to  M12  representing  8%  of  the  dose  in  bile)  and  by 
O-dealkylation/oxidation (to M7, M9 and M30 representing 5, 5 and 3% of the dose, respectively, in urine). 
Faecal elimination was a minor route (6% of the dose) and contained mainly unchanged GW642444 (4% of 
the dose), possibly resulting from direct gut secretion.   
Following oral administration of 14C-GW642444 (α-phenylcinnamate salt) at 350 mcg/kg in male Sprague 
Dawley  rats,  elimination  was  was  largely  via  faeces  (86%  of  the  administered  dose)  which  mainly 
constituted unchanged parent (at least 77% of the administered dose).  
Consistent with intravenous administration, the main urinary metabolites resulted from dealkylation (M7, 
M26, M1, M3, M30, M9), oxidation (M7, M26, M30, M9) or glucuronide conjugation (M1, M3).  
Major metabolites were also examined in male beagle dogs dosed with a single intravenous or single oral 
doses of 14C-GW642444 (as the α-phenylcinnamate salt, GW642444H) at 50 and 100 mcg/kg, respectively. 
Unchanged  GW642444  was  the  only  major  component  observed  in  dog  plasma  following  intravenous 
dosing. 
In  humans,  information  on  metabolism  was  obtained  from  human  plasma  on  Day  7  following  repeated 
inhalation dosing of GW642444 at 200 mcg/kg to asthmatic subjects.  
Metabolism  of  GW642444  was  also  studied  in  six  healthy  male  volunteers  following  a  single  oral 
administration of 14C-GW642444 (200 mcg). Elimination of GW642444 was mainly by metabolism followed 
by excretion of metabolites in urine, or to a lesser extent, faeces.  
Excretion 
Fluticasone Furoate/Umeclidinium/Vilanterol 
No excretion PK studies were performed on the fixed dose combination fluticasone 
furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol which was considered acceptable based on the data provided for the 
individual compounds. 
Fluticasone furoate (GW685698) 
Rat: 
Following a single oral of 3H-GW685698, 100 mcg/kg (nominal) in male and female Wistar Han rats, the 
majority of the DRM was excreted in the faeces (90% to 92% of the dose) with the majority being excreted 
within the first 24 hours after dosing (77% to 87% of the dose). Very little of the dose (0.5 to 0.7%) was 
excreted in the urine.  
Assessment report  
EMA/25056/2018 
Page 43/106 
  
  
Following a single intravenous dose of 3H-GW685698 as a bolus at 100 mcg/kg in male and female Wistar 
Han rats, most of DRM was again excreted in the faeces (90% to 97% of the dose), with the majority being 
excreted within the first 24 hours after dosing (79% to 89% of the dose). These data indicated that the 
majority of the DRM was eliminated via the bile into the gastrointestinal tract.  
Dog: 
Following a single oral of 3H-GW685698 (100 mcg/kg (nominal)) to beagle dogs, the majority of DRM was 
excreted mainly in the faeces via biliary excretion, with negligible renal excretion (the maximum urinary 
recovery of DRM was about 2%). The mean total recovery of DRM (including cage washes at less than 1% 
of  dose)  was  91%  over  168  hours.  The  majority  of  DRM  was  excreted  within  48  hours.  No  apparent 
sex-related differences were observed in the excretion of radioactive DRM. 
Following intravenous dosing of 3H-GW685698 (100 mcg/kg) as a slow bolus to beagle dogs, excretion of 
the DRM occurred mainly in the faeces via biliary excretion, with negligible renal excretion (the maximum 
urinary recovery of DRM was about 2%).  
Following intravenous infusion of 14C-GW685698 (100 mcg/mL) over a 30 minute period to beagle dogs, 
the majority of radioactivity was eliminated in the faeces, which accounted for a mean of 81.1% of the dose 
administered,  consistent  with  biliary  secretion  of  GW685698  DRM  followed  by  faecal  excretion.  Urinary 
elimination was minor, accounting for a mean of 3.5% of dose. Elimination was initially rapid with a mean of 
approximately 80% of the dose being recovered by 48 hours post dose. Subcutaneous administration also 
showed  comparable  elimination  routes  in  beagle  dogs  dosed  with  100  mcg/mL  3H-GW685698  when 
compared with oral and iv, although at a slower rate.   
Umeclidinium (GSK573719) 
The elimination of 14C-UMEC was investigated following a single administration to mice, rats and dogs by 
oral  and/or  intravenous  dosing.  Following  oral  administration,  the  excretion  of  radioactivity  was  almost 
entirely  via  the  faeces  in  rat  and  dog,  which  is  consistent  with  humans  and  with  the  very  low  oral 
bioavailability observed in rat and dog. 
On  the  other  hand,  elimination  after  i.v.  administration  to  mice,  rats  and  dogs  was  both  via  the  faeces 
(49-66%) and urine (8-17%). Not all the dose was recovered in the excreta over the collection period, being 
some prolonged retention of radioactivity, with quantifiable amounts in the carcass of mice and rats, and 
radioactivity  being  present  in  excreta  at  the  last  collection  time  point  in  all  species,  including  humans. 
However, the majority of the radioactivity was eliminated moderately rapid with over half the dose excreted 
within 24 hours in the rat and mouse, and 48 hours in the dog. 
Vilanterol (GW64244) 
Rat: 
Following a single oral 14C-GW642444 (as the α-phenylcinnamate salt, GW642444H) (350 mcg/kg) in male 
Sprague Dawley rats, the major route of elimination observed was via the faeces (mean of 86.1% of the 
dose), with urinary elimination accounting for a mean of 4.7% of the dose (see table below). Elimination of 
radioactivity was rapid with a mean of approximately 86% of the dose being eliminated during 0 to 24 hours 
post dose 
Following  a  single intravenous  dosing  in  the  same study  (350  mcg/kg  slow  bolus  over  30  minutes),  the 
major route of elimination of radioactive DRM was via the faeces (mean of 69.2% of the dose), with urinary 
elimination accounting for a mean 18.6% of the dose (see table below). 
Following  a  single  oral  dose  of  14C-GI179710  (triphenylacteic  acid,  the  counter  ion  of  GW642444M 
triphenylacetate salt) (1000 mcg/kg) to male Sprague Dawley rats, the major route of elimination of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/25056/2018 
Page 44/106 
  
  
radioactive  DRM,  the  major  route  of  elimination  of  DRM  was  via  the  faeces  (mean  84.4%  of  the  dose). 
Urinary elimination accounted for a mean 3.6% of the dose.  
Following  a  single intravenous  dosing  in  the  same study  (500  mcg/kg  slow  bolus  over  30  minutes),  the 
major route of elimination of DRM was  via the faeces (mean of 84.8% of the dose). Urinary elimination 
accounted for a mean of 4.2% of the dose.  
To gain information on the extent of biliary excretion and metabolism of GW642444, male BDC Sprague 
Dawley rats were given a single intravenous or oral dose of 14C-GW642444 (parent form) (500mcg/kg). The 
major routes of elimination of DRM following intravenous administration were via the bile and urine (means 
of 45% and 32% of the dose, respectively). Approximately 6% of the dose was recovered in the faeces. The 
major routes of elimination of DRM following oral administration were also via the faeces and bile (means of 
55% and 28% of the dose, respectively), a further 9% was eliminated via the urine.  
Dog: 
Following a single oral 14C-GW642444 (as the α-phenylcinnamate salt, GW642444H) to male beagle dogs, 
the major route of elimination observed via the faeces (a mean of 56% of the dose), with urinary excretion 
accounting for a mean of 22% of the dose (see table below). Following a single intravenous dosing in the 
same study, the major route of elimination observed was again via the faeces (a mean of 47.9% of the 
dose), with urinary excretion accounting for a mean of 38.8% of the dose. 
Following  a  single  oral  dose  of  14C-GI179710  (triphenylacteic  acid,  the  counter  ion  of  GW642444M 
triphenylacetate salt) (1000 mcg/kg), the major route of elimination of radioactivity was via the faeces (a 
mean  of  56%  of  the  dose),  with  urinary  excretion  accounting  for  a  mean  of  22%  of  the  dose.  Initial 
elimination of radioactivity was relatively rapid, with a mean of approximately 70% of the dose eliminated in 
the urine and faeces during the period of 0 to 24 hours post dose.  
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol 
FF and VI are inhibitors and substrates for CYP3A4; and UMEC is a substrate for CYP2D6. Simulations were 
conducted using the SimCYP™ population based simulator, which predicts a 1.25-fold difference in mean 
AUC between PM and EM populations which is comparable to that observed in the clinic, where a 1.3-fold 
difference  in  AUC  was  observed  between  the  populations.  All  three  molecules  are  substrates  but  not 
inhibitors of P-gp.  FF, UMEC and VI are not substrates of BCRP, OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 transporters, and FF 
inhibits OATP1B1. UMEC is also not a substrate for OAT1 and BSEP transporter, but is a weak poor substrate 
of OAT3 where time-dependent uptake of UMEC into cells expressing OAT3 was only 2-fold greater than 
control cells.  
The limited in vitro inhibitory activity of FF, UMEC, and VI do not meet any of the thresholds of concern 
stipulated  in  regulatory  guidance.  These  thresholds  of  concern  are  still  not  met  even  when  taking  into 
account the in vitro binding of FF, UMEC, and VI to human microsomal components. Based on this in vitro 
information, there should be minimal risk regarding an in vivo interaction should a potent inhibitor of one of 
these transporter systems be co-administered with FF, UMEC or FF. Therefore, the inhibition and induction 
potential of FF/UMEC/VI at low inhalation doses appears to be negligible. 
Fluticasone furoate (GW685698) 
Cytochrome P450 induction by GW685698 in animals 
The potential for GW685698 to induce cytochrome P450 enzymes was investigated in rats. Portions of the 
liver were collected from groups of Wistar Han rats (n=6/sex) which had received a daily inhaled dosed of 
GW685698 at a target dose of 64 mcg/kg in a 4 week toxicology study.  
Assessment report  
EMA/25056/2018 
Page 45/106 
  
  
Daily treatment of the rats with GW685698 at this dose for 4 weeks was not found to have any significant 
effects on hepatic microsomal protein or total cytochrome P450 (CYP) concentrations, or on the activities of 
the CYP1A, CYP3A, CYP2B, CYP2E or CYP4A enzymes. 
No other nonclinical studies have been performed to specifically investigate the potential for GW685698 to 
undergo pharmacokinetic drug interactions when administered concomitantly with other drugs or foods.  
Umeclidinium (GSK573719) 
Cytochrome P450 induction by GSK573719 in animals  
The effects of GSK573719 (0, 26.1, 243 and 1829 mcg/kg/day) on the mRNA levels of liver CYP450 genes 
was  investigated  in  Sprague  Dawley  rats  (3/sex/group)  following  nose-only  inhalation  exposure  (60 
minutes/day) for 28 days in a toxicology study (Report WD2005/01627; WD2005/01422). GSK573719 did 
not cause any increase in the levels of mRNA of the following CYPs: CYP1A1 (in male animals only), CYP1A2, 
CYP2B1, CYP2B2, CYP2E1, CYP3A2, CYP3A23 and CYP4A1 (in female animals only). A small increase was 
observed in the levels of CYP1A1 mRNA (to a mean ratio of treated over control of 8) in the female livers at 
2000  mcg/kg/day,  although  this  mean  increase  is  due  to  result  from  one  rat.  Increases  in  the  levels  of 
CYP4A1 mRNA were observed (to a mean ratio of treated over control of 2 and 4) in the male livers at 30 and 
200 mcg/kg/day dose groups. A decrease in the expression of all the CYP mRNA was observed. 
Vilanterol (GW64244) 
Cytochrome P450 induction by GW642444 in animals 
Four studies were performed in rats to investigate the potential for GW642444 to induce the cytochrome 
P450 enzymes following repeat inhalation doses of GW642444 as the α-phenylcinnamate salt, GW642444H 
or  as  a  triphenulate  salt,  significant,  but  weak  induction  of  CYP2B1  mRNA  at  doses  greater  than  890 
mcg/kg/day was seen only in male rats dosed for 7 days. No other notable changes were observed. Minor 
increases in the levels of CYP2B2 gene expression (to approximately 7-, 6- and 6-fold the control values) 
were observed from all dose groups (0, 45.1, 261.1 or 708.7 mcg/kg/day) in the female rats dosed for 4 
weeks.  No other notable changes  
In toxicology studies investigating the combination of GW642444 with the corticosteroid, GW685698, there 
was  little  evidence,  in  any  study,  for  increased  exposure  (AUC0-t  and  Cmax)  to  either  GW685698  or 
GW642444  (>2-  to  3-fold)  when  dosed  in  combination  compared  to  when  dosed  alone,  suggesting  that 
neither molecule interferes with the systemic clearance of the other. Likewise, toxicokinetics of GW642444 
were generally unaffected following co-administration with LAMAs. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Following comparison of the pharmacological and toxicological profiles of FF, UMEC and VI, as well literature 
data, no causes for significant toxicological concern were identified for the triple combination, FF/UMEC/VI. 
However,  since  the  triple  combination  had  not  been  evaluated  previously  in  nonclinical  species,  and  in 
accordance with the ICH M3 (R2) guidance (2009), a 13 week inhaled toxicity study in dogs with the triple 
combination FF/UMEC/VI was conducted. This included toxicokinetic evaluations, and a weight of evidence 
review of the immunotoxicity potential of FF, UMEC and VI. 
Single dose toxicity 
Fluticasone Furoate/Umeclidinium/Vilanterol 
No  single  dose  toxicity  studies  were  performed  on  the  fixed  dose  combination  Fluticasone 
Furoate/Umeclidinium/Vilanterol  which  was  considered  acceptable  based  on  the  data  available  for  each 
compound. The data presented below summarises current knowledge on each mono-component.  
Assessment report  
EMA/25056/2018

Fluticasone furoate (GW685698) 
Single dose toxicity studies have been performed in order to determine the inhalation toxicity of GW685698. 
In addition, single dose toxicities have been performed with GW685698 administered via the oral, SC and IV 
routes.  Dose  levels  in  the  inhalation  studies  represented  the  highest  technically  achievable  aerosol 
concentrations with a particle size distribution suitable for inhalation testing in rodents.  
In one study, CD-1 mice were given vehicle alone (lactose) or GW685698 then killed on Day 3 or Day 15. It 
was  observed  marked  body  weight  loss  in  the  majority  of  males  (mean  4.3%)  and  all  females  (mean 
10.8%).  Treatment-related  microscopic  findings  are  limited  to  atrophy  in  the  thymus  of  all 
GW685698-treated  animals  and  lymphoid  depletion  in  the  spleen  of  4  animals.  Reversibility  of  the 
microscopic findings and body weight was apparent. 
Umeclidinium (GSK573719) 
No specific single dose toxicity studies were conducted with Umeclidinium. Dose escalation in the 7 day dose 
range finding inhalation studies in the rat and the dog identified dose-limiting toxicity in the respiratory 
tract. In the in vivo genotoxicity micronucleus test, rats tolerated two intravenous doses of 10,000 or 20,000 
mcg/kg (dose limited by solubility). Single oral doses up to 1,000,000 mcg/kg were well tolerated in the 
mouse. In the rat, a single dose of 50 mcg/kg and 60 mcg/kg was well tolerated using the intravenous and 
subcutaneous routes respectively. 
Vilanterol (GW642444) 
Single dose acute toxicity studies have not been performed with GW642444, except for one study designed 
to assess the tolerability of GW642444 (as the α-phenyl cinnamate salt) administered as a 5% dry powder 
blend in lactose by inhaled administration in beagle dogs.  
In this study, it was observed that the administration of GW642444 resulted in vasodilation and increases in 
pulse rate. Pulse rates were elevated until 12 hours after dosing in both the male and female but were similar 
to pre-dosing values at 24 hours after completion of dosing. Serum cTnI levels were increased in the male, 
with peak levels being attained 8 hours after dosing. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Fluticasone Furoate/Umeclidinium/Vilanterol 
The objective of the 13 week study was to determine the toxicity and toxicokinetics of FF (GW685698), 
UMEC  (GSK573719)  and  VI  (GW642444)  when  given  in  combination  to  dogs  via  daily  inhalation 
(oropharyngeal tube) administration for 10 minutes/day for 13 consecutive weeks at an anticipated clinical 
ratio of 4:1:5 for GW685698, GW642444 and GSK573719, respectively and to compare findings with each 
of the test articles administered alone.  
The study was carried out by the inhaled route of administration as this is the proposed therapeutic route in 
humans. The beagle dog had been selected as the non-rodent species on the basis of similarities in the 
pharmacokinetic and metabolic handling of FF, UMEC and VI between the selected species and humans, and 
data obtained in previously submitted studies. 
Test  article-related  findings  consistent  with  expected  class  effects  of  corticosteroids,  long  acting  beta2 
adrenergic receptor agonists (LABAs) or long acting muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists (LAMAs) 
were noted. No major exacerbations of these findings were evident for FF/UMEC/VI when administered in 
either high or low dose combinations at a ratio of 4:5:1.  
FF/UMEC/VI  was administered at a ratio of 4:5:1, consistent with the ratio in the combination originally 
investigated  in  the  clinic.  However,  the  product  proposed  for  marketing  in  this  application  contains 
FF/UMEC/VI  in  a  ratio  of  4:2.5:1.  Although  the  ratio  investigated in  dogs  differs  from  that  proposed  for 
Assessment report  
EMA/25056/2018

marketing, since all findings are related to FF and there was no exacerbation with the triple combination 
which  contained  a  higher  ratio  of  UMEC  compared  to  FF  and  VI,  the  study  is  considered  to  support 
FF/UMEC/VI commercial product at the proposed ratio. 
Overall, sufficient safety margins are seen when principle toxicological findings are compared to that seen at 
the proposed human clinical dose.  
Available information for each mono-component is provided below.  
Fluticasone furoate (GW685698) 
The repeated dose inhalation profile toxicity of GW685698 was appropriately assessed in mice, rats and 
dogs at doses up to 76.9, 20.3 and 59.6 mcg/kg/day for durations up to 13, 26 and 39 weeks, respectively. 
The high doses used in these studies were selected on the basis of maximum tolerated repeat dose, which 
were generally limited by decreased body weight gain. In dogs and rats, systemic exposures (AUC) achieved 
at these doses were less than 10-fold those achieved in humans at the proposed commercial dose of 100 
mcg/day. Therefore, exposure multiples are not given for the effects observed. The obtained findings in 
these  studies  were  typically  associated  with  glucocorticoid  excess  and  commonly  reported  for  other 
marketed  inhaled  steroids  including  GW685698,  therefore  a  NOAEL  was  not  identified.  The  GW685698 
related findings observed in these studies are described below.  
Clinical observations included reductions in body weight or lower body weight gain in mice, rats and dogs at 
most dose levels; hair loss and/or skin thinning in mice, rats and dogs in most dose groups, and hair growth 
being predominantly in the telogen phase in rats dosed at ≥8.3 mcg/kg/day for 26 weeks and in dogs given 
GW685698 at ≥20.6 mcg/kg/day with or without GW642444 in the 13 week combination toxicity study. 
Immunosuppression observations included buccal cavity papillomas (canine papilloma virus), exacerbation 
of minor respiratory tract lesions, chronic inflammation of the stomach and demodecosis in the 13 and 39 
week studies in dog. 
Lymphoid  tissues  showed  the  expected  reversible  lymphoid  depletion  in  thymus  (together  with  thymic 
atrophy  and  reduced  thymus  weight),  spleen,  larynx,  tonsils,  lymph  nodes  (mesenteric,  mandibular, 
bronchial, cervical), NALT, GALT and / or laryngeal mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue in mice, rats and 
dogs in most studies.  
Haematology observations included lymphocytopenia, eosinopenia and neutrophilia in mice, rats and dogs 
in  most  studies,  together  with  increase  in  red  blood  cell  parameters  (haematocrit,  haemoglobin 
concentration and/or erythrocyte count) in rats and decrease in dogs. 
In  the  pituitary  gland,  it  was  observed  reduction  in  ACTH-producing  cells  with  the  resulting  increased 
prominence of other cellular types including the acidophilic cells in the 39 week study in dogs. The impact of 
this  effect  included  cortical  atrophy,  a  reduction  in  adrenal  weight  and  lower  or  absent  plasma  levels  of 
cortisol in all dog studies.  
Metabolic effects included changes in clinical chemistry parameters in rats and dogs (plasma triglycerides, 
cholesterol,  total  protein,  glucose,  alkaline  phosphatase  and  alanine  aminotransferase  activities,  urinary 
volume and electrolytes). In addition, reversible hepatocellular vacuolation/increased rarefaction was seen 
in most dog studies. 
In the lungs, it was observed increase of minimal eosinophilic inclusions in a very small proportion of Clara 
cells of the bronchial epithelium at all dose levels in rat studies for ≥ 3 months. This effect did not exceed 
levels of severity seen in background data, did not progress with longer durations of dosing since it was not 
seen in the carcinogenicity study, and is a normal physiological response to the deposition of particulate 
material in the rat.

In the kidney, it was observed slight increase of the naturally occurring hyaline droplets in the renal cortical 
tubules of male rats in some rat studies up to 13 weeks duration with GW685698 alone or in combination 
with GW642444. This effect was of mild severity, and similar to those normally expected in healthy control 
rats so it is considered not to indicate a direct nephrotoxic effect.  
In the mammary glands of female rats given GW685698 alone and in combination with GW642444 in the 4 
and 13 week combination toxicity studies, an increased secretory activity was observed. This effect has been 
reported  with  other  marketed  corticosteroids,  therefore  it  is  considered  to  have  little  relevance  to  the 
therapeutic use.  
In  the  rat  teeth,  it  was  observed  pallor  of  incisor  teeth  associated  with  vacuolation,  degeneration  and 
disorganisation of the ameloblast layer (≥52 mcg/kg/day) and/or disorganisation of the odontoblast layer at 
all doses (≥7.85 mcg/kg/day) in animals exposed to GW685698 alone and in combination with GW642444 
in the 13 week study. These effects were not seen in the dog, mouse or rabbit. This is a known effect of 
corticosteroids  and  it  is  possible  that  paediatric  patients  may  be  susceptible  to  these  effects  of  inhaled 
corticosteroids, however, it is less likely to be of relevance for use in adults or adolescent patients. 
In the stomach, minimal or slight inflammatory changes predominantly in the cardia region, were seen in the 
39  week  dog  study  at  doses  ≥30.1  mcg/kg/day.  These  changes  were  considered  secondary  to  the 
immunosuppressant effects of treatment. This pathology is variable in both species, did not progress with 
longer treatment, and it is considered a class effect.  
In addition, there was an increase of connective tissue hyalinisation in the pyloric mucosa of the stomach at 
all doses in the 2 year carcinogenicity study in the mouse. This alteration was not seen in rats or dogs, and 
it is considered to be a local effect on the mucosa since a high proportion of the inhaled dose is swallowed.  
In the gall bladder, an increase of luminal mucin was seen in dogs which appear to be dog specific. A minor 
increase  in  lipid  vacuolation  in  the  bile  duct  and  gall  bladder  epithelium,  not  associated  with  cellular 
degeneration or inflammatory changes, was also seen in some dog studies. Since this effect is of similar 
severity to that observed in untreated dogs, and is a dog-specific observation, it is considered not of concern 
for human safety. 
In the skeletal muscle, it was observed pallor and/or minimal to slight myofibre atrophy in hindlimbs of dogs 
given  GW685698  at  ≥61.0  mcg/kg/day  (achieving  systemic  exposures  ≥4-fold  those  achieved  at  the 
proposed commercial dose) with or without GW642444 in the 13 week combination toxicology study. This is 
an effect sometimes seen with corticosteroids in the dog following long-term administration. 
Umeclidinium (GSK573719) 
In repeat dose inhalation toxicity studies, the principal toxicities seen with Umeclidinium were irritant effects 
in  the  respiratory  tract  and  pharmacology-related  cardiovascular  effects,  as  well  as  a  reduction  in  body 
weight gain. 
According to the Applicant, the spectrum of microscopic changes observed in the upper respiratory tract of 
mice, rats and dogs are considered to be indicative of a local irritant effect to Umeclidinium, which could 
have been exacerbated by the drying of the mucosa associated with the antimuscarinic pharmacological 
action  of  UMEC.  This  justification  is  considered  acceptable.  In  humans,  local  irritancy  (e.g.  cough, 
nasopharyngitis,  oropharyngeal  pain)  were  commonly  reported  during  clinical  trials  across  all  treatment 
arms which included placebo. However, they were not associated with any sequelae. 
On the other hand, tachycardia is a common effect of LAMAs, as well as alterations in ion channel activities 
in vitro and it is expected from the pharmacology of muscarinic antagonists. 
Granuloma formation in the lung was observed in one dog study and was considered to be secondary to 
excessive antimuscarinic pharmacology. Gall bladder distension and myofibre degeneration detected in one 
Assessment report  
EMA/25056/2018 
Page 49/106 
  
  
14-day  dog  study  was  not  observed  in  pivotal  studies  in  dogs,  and  available  clinical  data  indicate  no 
increased risk for gall bladder distension or clinical symptoms. Therefore, all these findings are considered of 
less importance and without clinical significance which is acceptable. 
Vilanterol (GW642444) 
The toxicity profile of GW642444 has been investigated adequately in repeat dose inhaled toxicity studies of 
up to 13 weeks in mice, 26 weeks in rats and 39 weeks in dogs. Toxicological findings in these studies were 
mostly  associated  with  the  primary  pharmacology  and  seen  with  other  marketed  beta2  agonists.  These 
findings are described below. 
The principal toxicity of GW642444 was in the heart and cardiovascular system. Cardiovascular responses in 
the  dog  were  expected  effects  in  dogs  experiencing  beta2-agonist  peripheral  vasodilatation  and  reflex 
tachycardia.  Such  lesions  could  not  be  relevant  to  the  use  in  humans  at  the  proposed  commercial  dose 
because tachycardia occurred at exposure 44-fold the human exposure at the proposed commercial dose. 
In the upper respiratory tract, GW642444 produced irritancy in mice, rats and dogs. In rats, minimal to 
marked microscopic changes in nasal cavity / sinuses, nasopharynx and larynx at ≥10253 mcg/kg/day were 
observed in the 13 or 26 week toxicity studies. The upper respiratory tract irritancy determined the NOAEL 
in the 13 week study in rat and was the main test article-related finding in the 13 week study in mouse. The 
findings observed in rats and mice are considered not to predict unacceptable irritancy in humans, as the 
larynx is a particularly sensitive area of the respiratory tract in rodents and since GW642444 was given for 
an extended period of time which contrasts sharply with the oral inhalation method in humans. The changes 
in the nasal cavities of dogs are also not of concern as they were only seen at high doses administered by 
oronasal facemask over a 30 or 60 minute period each day. 
In the lung, it was observed greater incidence of focal pulmonary haemorrhage in rats dosed up to 4 weeks 
duration. However, this effect is not considered to be of relevance to humans because it was limited to the 
ratand was seen with similar incidence in control rats. 
Metabolic effects produced by GW642444 included increased weight gain in mice, rats and dogs at most 
dose levels within the majority of studies. These effects are considered not to represent a hazard to human 
health since there have been no consequences with other beta2 agonists in clinical use. In addition, minimal 
increase in serum alkaline phosphatase activity and bilirubin concentration and a decrease in serum alanine 
aminotransferase activity in rats at doses ≥658 mcg/kg/day have been observed in the 13 week toxicity 
study. These changes are considered not to represent a hazard to human since none were noted during the 
rat 26 week study at doses achieving AUC0-t exposures up to 2500-fold greater than those in humans at the 
proposed commercial dose.  
Changes produced by GW642444 in hepatocyte rarefaction were seen in the 13 and/or 39 weeks study in 
dogs  at  doses  ≥9.3  mcg/kg/day  (<21-fold  human  exposure)  and  in  mice  at  doses  ≥6490  mcg/kg/day 
(312-fold human exposure). This effect in only the high dose combination and is considered of no clinical 
relevance  since  at  these  doses,  systemic  exposures  were  77-fold  (GW642444)  and  6-fold  (GW685698) 
greater than those in patients at the proposed commercial doses. 
In the skeletal muscle, minor microscopic changes were seen in male rats in all groups given GW642444 at 
≥6.29  mcg/kg/day  (expected  AUC0-t  is  similar  to  AUC0-t  at  the  human  commercial  dose)  alone  or  in 
combination with GW685698 in the 4 week combination toxicity study. These changes were not seen in the 
other performed studies with GW642444 at doses achieving AUC0-t >2500-fold greater than that at the 
proposed commercial dose. 
Haematology changes in dogs included increase in platelet count at the highest dose tested (2010 to 571 
mcg/kg/day)  in  the  4  week  study,  increase  in  white  blood  cell  count,  primarily  due  to  neutrophils  and 
monocytes,  at  501  mcg/kg  in  the  13  week  study,  slight  reduction  in  haemoglobin  in  female  given  510 
Assessment report  
EMA/25056/2018

mcg/kg/day during the 39 week study. In rats, increase in neutrophil and/or monocyte counts, along with 
very  small  reductions  in  erythrocyte  parameters  were  noted  at  34422  mcg/kg/day  with  an  increase  in 
reticulocyte count apparent at ≥625 mcg/kg/day in the 14 day study, and reversible reductions in platelet 
counts at ≥56.2 mcg/kg/day (13 weeks) or ≥537 mcg/kg/day (26 weeks). At the NOEL for haematological 
changes in the 26 week study in rats (57.7mcg/kg/day) and the 39-week study in dogs (62.5 mcg/kg/day), 
AUC0-t was 20- or 124-fold greater, respectively, than human AUC0-t at the proposed commercial dose, 
thus these findings are considered not relevant for human safety at this dose. 
In the thymus, GW642444 was associated with increase of thymic involution/atrophy in dogs at doses of 
≥137, ≥64.2, ≥9.3 and 510 mcg/kg/day administered for 14 days or 4, 13 or 39 weeks, respectively. In 
dogs, although seen at all doses in the 13 week study in which AUC0-t was ≥26-fold greater than that at the 
proposed  human  commercial  dose,  in  the  39  week  study  at  the  NOEL  (62.5  mcg/kg/day),  AUC0-t  was 
124-fold  greater  than  human.  Furthermore,  involution/atrophy  of  the  thymus  is  a  normal  age-related 
change in dogs which is often further advanced with experimental stress and is considered not relevant for 
humans.  
In the female reproductive tract, GW642444 was associated with dose-related myometrial hypertrophy seen 
at  doses  ≥1020  mcg/kg/day  in  mouse  in  the  13  week  study  and  at  ≥62  mcg/kg/day  in  the  mouse 
carcinogenicity  study.  The  fact  that  no  myometrial  hypertrophy  in  the  13  week  mouse  study  at  58.6 
mcg/kg/day (35-fold human exposure) have been observed suggests the uterine changes have no relevance 
to  human  use  at  the  proposed  commercial  dose.  There  was  also  an  increase  of  cystic  endometrial 
hyperplasia in all treated groups in the mouse carcinogenicity study. 
In rats, reversible decrease of recent corpora lutea, increase of dilated or cystic follicles in the ovary and 
increase of females in a proestrus or estrus state in the 26 weeks study at ≥537 mcg/kg/day have been 
observed. At the same doses in the mammary gland of rats, non-reversible increase of acinar development 
and secretory activity, as well as incidences of lobular hyperplasia with atypia and/or mammary adenoma 
have been observed. The NOAEL for these effects in rats is 57.7 mcg/kg/day (20-fold human exposure), 
which  determined  of  the  rat  26  week  study.  In  addition  in  the  104  week  carcinogenicity  study  in  rats, 
increase of serum estradiol concentrations in females but not males, increase of ovarian cysts at all dose 
levels,  increase  of  mesovarian  ligament  smooth  muscle  hyperplasia/hypertrophy  and  leiomyomata  at 
≥84.4/28.2 mcg/kg/day have been observed. The absence of these changes in male in the 26 week study 
suggests that GW642444 may be acting at a local level in the female reproductive tract in the rat rather than 
through any perturbation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. 
In mice, the incidence of development of ovarian cysts was increased at ≥62.0 mcg/kg/day, but not at 6.40 
mcg/kg/day at which AUC0-t was 30-fold the clinical exposure at the proposed commercial dose. In the rat 
carcinogenicity study the incidence of ovarian cysts was increased at all doses. These ovarian changes are 
considered  to  be  rodent-specific  and  are  of  no  relevance  to  humans  because  a  similar  beta2  related 
mechanism for cyst formation had not been identified over many patient years of clinical use with other 
beta2  agonists.  These  changes  were  not  seen  in  dogs  receiving  GW642444  at  doses  of  up  to  510 
mcg/kg/day for 39 weeks. 
The  benign  neoplastic  changes  in  the  mammary  glands  (mammary  adenoma;  lobular  hyperplasia  with 
atypia) of rats dosed for 26 weeks were restricted to 2/18 animals at 2670 mcg/kg/day where the mean 
exposure was >1000 times higher than in humans at the proposed commercial dose. As GW642444 is not 
genotoxic and the NOAEL for this finding (537 mcg/kg/day) was 135 times greater than that in humans at 
the proposed commercial dose and therefore indicates no clinical concern. There were no GW642444-related 
mammary  findings  in  the  carcinogenicity  study  in  rats  in  which  doses  up  to  657  mcg/kg/day  were 
administered for up to 104 weeks. 
Genotoxicity 
Assessment report  
EMA/25056/2018 
Page 51/106 
  
  
Fluticasone Furoate/Umeclidinium/Vilanterol 
In accordance with ICH guidance ICH M3 (R2), no genotoxicity studies with the FF/UMEC/VI combination 
were carried out. Previous in vitro or in vivo genotoxicity studies with either FF, UMEC or VI indicate that 
none of the components of the combination product represents a genotoxic hazard to humans. 
Fluticasone furoate (GW685698) 
GW685698 was not mutagenic in a battery of in vitro studies (bacterial mutagenicity test or chromosomal 
damage in a mammalian) and in vivo micronucleus tests in rats. Concentrations used in the in vitro tests 
were limited by precipitation or cytotoxicity and intravenous doses up to the maximum tolerated were used 
in vivo, which achieved up to 500000-fold Cmax obtained following inhaled administration at the proposed 
commercial dose of 100 mcg/day. 
Umeclidinium (GSK573719) 
The study’s results indicate that UMEC does not pose a genotoxicity risk to patients. An assessment of the 
route of synthesis for UMEC (as the bromide salt) has been conducted to determine whether any impurities 
might be present which are known or suspected DNA-reactive mutagens, and to assess the likelihood of any 
such impurities being present in final drug product. There were no impurities of mutagenic concern at a level 
that would exceed the threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) as defined by guidelines on the limits for 
genotoxic impurities. 
Vilanterol (GW642444) 
GW642444  (as  the  α-phenyl  cinnamate  salt)  was  not  mutagenic  in  a  bacterial  mutagenicity  assay  at 
concentrations up to ≥1500 mcg/plate, as well as did not induce morphological transformation in the Syrian 
hamster  embryo  cell  transformation  assay  up  to  32.5  mcg/mL  (limited  by  cytotoxicity)  and  was  not 
genotoxic in vivo in either the rat micronucleus assay or the unscheduled DNA synthesis assay using rat 
hepatocytes at maximum tolerated intravenous doses that produced plasma concentrations >20000 times 
(Cmax) higher than those seen in humans. However, although GW642444 (as the α-phenyl cinnamate salt) 
was not genotoxic in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay in the absence of S9-mix at concentrations up to 
30 and 8 mcg/mL, GW642444 (as the α-phenyl cinnamate salt) did induce an equivocal, non-reproducible 
response in the presence of S9-mix at highly cytotoxic concentrations (≤20% Relative Total Growth). The 
weight of evidence from the all data indicates that GW642444 (as the α-phenyl cinnamate salt) does not 
represent a genotoxic hazard to humans.  
Carcinogenicity 
Fluticasone Furoate/Umeclidinium/Vilanterol 
In accordance with ICH guidance ICH M3 (R2), carcinogenicity studies were not performed with FF/UMEC/VI 
combination.  The  carcinogenic  potential  of  FF,  UMEC  and  VI  was  thoroughly  assessed  for  the  single 
mono-components.  There  were  no  treatment-related  increases  in  tumour  incidence  following  lifetime 
administration  of  FF  or  UMEC  by  the  inhalation  route.  In  the  inhaled  carcinogenicity  studies  with  VI, 
proliferative changes were seen in the female reproductive tract of rats and mice, and pituitary gland of rats. 
Non-clinical carcinogenicity findings with VI were similar to other beta-2 agonists. All proliferative effects 
seen  at  high  systemic  exposures  in  rats  and  mice  have  been  observed  following  administration  of  other 
beta-2 agonists, and are considered not to be clinically relevant. 
Fluticasone furoate (GW685698) 
Mouse carcinogenicity study

The carcinogenic potential of GW685698 was assessed in a 2 year inhalation repeat dose study in which 
groups of mice (60/sex/group) were administered estimated achieved doses of 0 (vehicle, 2 groups), 2.2, 
6.1, 18.8 mcg/kg/day in lactose once daily, for 1 hour/day. 
There was no evidence of an effect of treatment on mortality rates.  Unscheduled deaths were comparable 
across all groups at weak 78 and at week 104 the percentage survival was greater than or equal to 30% 
across all groups. 
A  treatment  related  increased  incidence  of  hairloss,  chiefly  on  the  head/nasal  region,  was  recorded  for 
animals at all doses. Microscopically in the skin there was an increased incidence of inflammatory changes 
(epidermal ulceration/hyperplasia, dermal fibrosis and scabs) at all doses. Reduced body weight gain was 
seen at 6.09 and 18.8 mcg/kg/day, and minor changes in haematology (reduced lymphocytes in males (all 
doses) and increased platelets in females (18.8 mcg/kg/day) and clinical chemistry parameters (lower urea 
and  higher  total  protein  levels)  were  observed  in  week  104.    Microscopic  pathological  findings  in  the 
lymphoid tissues and stomach together with inflammatory changes in the respiratory tract were seen at all 
doses. In the lungs there was a reduction in the amount of BALT in males and females in all treated groups. 
The  severity  of  the  change  showed  a  clear  relationship  to  dose.  There  was  also  a  reduced  incidence  of 
epithelial eosinophilic inclusions in the nasal cavity in males and females from all treated groups. In the 
stomach there was dose-related increase in the incidence and severity of connective tissue hyalinisation in 
the  stomach  of  males  and  females  at  all  doses.  These  findings  are  considered  to  be  related  to  the 
pharmacological action of this class of compound. 
Treatment  with  GW685698  did  not  increase  the  incidence  of  any  neoplastic  finding.  There  was  a  slight 
increase in the incidence of bronchioloalveolar epithelial hyperplasia, and of bronchioloalveolar adenoma in 
the lungs of males receiving 6.1 mcg/kg/day, compared with concurrent controls. However the increased 
incidence of bronchioloalveolar adenoma was considered to be fortuitous given that the incidence of the 
adenomas was not dose dependent (i.e. absent on the high dose group), a low incident was seen in females 
at the same dose and a comparable incidence was observed in historical controls for this tumour type. 
Toxicokinetic analysis revealed systemic exposure to GW685698 was demonstrated in each of the dosed 
groups.  
Rat carcinogenicity study 
The carcinogenic potential of GW685698 was assessed in a 2 year inhalation repeat dose study in which 
groups of rats (60/sex/group) were administered estimated achieved doses of 0 (vehicle, 2 groups), 1.0, 
3.2, 8.6 mcg/kg/day in lactose once daily (1 hour/day). 
Survival  in  male  rats  was  unaffected  by  treatment  with  GW685698X.  However,  in  females  there  was  a 
treatment-related reduction in survival at 3.19 and 8.61 mcg/kg/day during the final 13 weeks of the study 
although there were no associated histopathological changes. A treatment related degree of hairloss, chiefly 
located on the head/nasal region, was recorded for intermediate and high dose animals.  Minor changes in 
haematology (significantly reduced total white cells, lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils and monocytes) 
and  clinical  chemistry  parameters  (higher  potassium  levels  in  males  and  biliruibin  levels  in  females) 
occurred at 8.61 mcg/kg/day. 
Treatment with GW685698 did not increase the incidence of any neoplastic finding for any group of animals. 
However, there were decreased incidences of haemangioma and lymphangioma in the mesenteric lymph 
node and of thymoma (lymphoid) in animals receiving 8.6 mcg/kg/day. The incidence of focal endothelial 
hyperplasia in the mesenteric lymph node was also reduced in this group. 
Microscopic pathological findings in the lymphoid tissues together with changes in inflammatory responses 
in the respiratory tract were seen at all doses.  In the nasal turbinates a decreased cellularity of the NALT 
was  accompanied  by  a  decreased  incidence  and/or  degree  of  eosinophilic  inclusions  in  the  olfactory 
Assessment report

epithelium  at  all  doses.  However,  in  the  lungs,  decreased  cellularity  of  the  BALT  was  accompanied  by a 
minimal increase in the incidence of eosinophilic inclusions in the bronchiolar epithelium at all doses. This 
latter finding was consistent with similar observations after 13 and 26 weeks treatment demonstrating a lack 
of  progression  despite  lifetime  administration;  the  content  of  the  inclusions  was  identified  as  Surfactant 
Protein-D. Furthermore, the incidence of inflammatory cells or inflammation was reduced at all doses in the 
lamina  propria  of  the  respiratory  epithelium  of  the  nasal  cavity,  the  nasopharynx,  trachea,  tracheal 
bifurcation at the point of bifurcation and in the adjacent trachea and bronchi at 3.2 and 8.6 mcg/kg/day, 
and  in  the  nasal  turbinates,  lungs  and  lamina  propria  of  the  larynx  at  8.6  mcg/kg/day.  Other  changes 
included an increased incidence of pigmented macrophages in the lamina propria of the larynx at all doses, 
alveolar pigmented macrophages (females only) and perivascular/peribronchiolar pigmented macrophages 
in the lung, and decreased incidence of foamy macrophages in the lung at 3.2 and 8.6 mcg/kg/day. At all 
doses there was an increased incidence of dilated vaginations from the ventral pouch of the larynx and an 
increased  incidence  of  mastocytosis  in  the  mesenteric  lymph  node.  At  8.6  mcg/kg/day  there  was  an 
increased incidence of dilated glands in the trachea (males only). The lung changes were associated with a 
decreased incidence of pale lungs observed macroscopically at the terminal kill. 
GW685698  was  only  quantificable  at  the  highest  dose  level  (8.6  mcg/kg/day).  Systemic  exposure  to 
GW685698  (as  assessed  by  AUC0-t  and  Cmax)  was  similar  in  both  Weeks  45  and  58  and  in  males  and 
females.  At  8.16  mcg/kg/day  overall  AUC0-t  was  0.320  ng.h/mL  and  Cmax  was  0.122  ng/mL  (data 
combined for males and females at Weeks 45 and 58). 
Umeclidinium (GSK573719) 
Administration of UMEC did not increase the incidence of neoplastic findings in mice or rats. An apparent 
increase in the incidence of two rare tumor types in rats was not considered treatment-related because it 
appeared only in one group/sex. 
The non-neoplastic findings associated with administration of UMEC by inhalation for up to 104 weeks to 
mice  and  rats  included  upper  respiratory  tract  irritancy,  accumulations  of  eosinophilic  inclusions, 
accumulation of alveolar macrophages and effects on the eye and Harderian glands. 
Vilanterol (GW642444) 
Mouse carcinogenicity study 
The carcinogenic potential of GW642444 was assessed in a 2 year inhalation repeat dose study in which 
groups  of  mice  (84/sex/group)  were  administered  estimated  achieved  doses  of  0,  6.4,  62,  615,  6150  or 
29500   mcg/kg/day  in  lactose  once  daily  (1  hour/day).    The  original  design  required  60  main  study 
animals/sex/group and 66 toxicokinetic animals/sex/group. Due to the high mortality that occurred across 
all  groups  during  the  first  few  months  of  the  study,  when  compared  with  historical  control  data,  24 
toxicokinetic animals/sex/group were reassigned as main study animals; these animals had not previously 
been subject to any blood sampling. All data related to these animals have been combined with the main 
study animals and is reported together. The total group size was therefore 84 animals/sex/group in the main 
study and 42 animals/sex/group in the toxicokinetic study. 
High  mortality  occurred  across  all  groups  when  compared  with  historical  control  data  due  to  swollen 
abdomen which was believed to be associated with the design of the restraint tube, possibly leading to air 
swallowing.  As a result the tube end caps were changed on several occasions during the study, following 
which  there  was  a  marked  reduction  in  the  incidence  of  swollen  abdomen.    Despite  these  mortalities,  a 
sufficient  number  of  animals  survived  to  the  end  of  the  study  to  assess  the  carcinogenic  potential  of 
GW642444. 
The  most  common  cause  of  death  in  both  sexes  was  gaseous  distension  of  the  GIT  (see  above).  Other 
common  causes  of  death 
included 
lymphoreticular  neoplasms  (both  sexes),  urogenital  tract

infection/obstruction  (primarily  in  males)  and  skin  ulceration/infection,  including  pododermatitis  and  tail 
infection (both sexes). All conditions occurred in control and treated groups, and showed no evidence of a 
dose-response or clear association with GW642444 administration.  
Administration  of  GW642444  was  associated  with  test  article-related  neoplastic  and  non-neoplastic 
proliferative changes in the ovaries and uterus and non-neoplastic changes in the ovaries, uterus and vagina 
of females and in the nasal cavity of both sexes. In the ovary, an increased incidence of sex cord stromal 
hypertrophy/hyperplasia was seen at all doses and an increased incidence of tubulostromal hyperplasia, sex 
cord tumors and ovarian cysts (and ovarian compression due to cysts) at ≥62 mcg/kg/day. An increased 
incidence of tubulostromal adenomas was seen at 29500 mcg/kg/day. In the uterus, an increased incidence 
and severity of cystic endometrial hyperplasia was seen at all doses, accompanied by endometrial glandular 
squamous metaplasia in a few females at 6150 or 29500 mcg/kg/day. Myometrial hypertrophy/hyperplasia 
and an increased incidence of leiomyoma and/or leiomyosarcoma were seen at ≥62 mcg/kg/day. In the 
vagina, a slight increased incidence of anestrus appearance (with/without mucin) was seen in at all doses. 
In the nasal cavity, an increased incidence and/or severity of luminal inflammatory cells/cell debris was seen 
in females at all doses and olfactory degenerative changes were seen in both sexes at ≥62 mcg/kg/day. The 
findings were minimal or slight in severity at doses up to 615 mcg/kg/day, but were more notably increased 
in incidence and severity in both sexes given ≥6150 mcg/kg/day. 
GW642444 systemic exposure (AUC0-t) to male and female mice based on combined values from Weeks 4 
and  26  were  7.93,  34.9,  135,  920  and  3591  ng.h/mL  at  6.4,  62,  615,  6150  or  29500  mcg/kg/day, 
respectively. Following treatment with GW642666 systemic exposure was also demonstrated to GI17910 
(counterion) and GSK932009 and GW630200 (the major human metabolites). 
Rat carcinogenicity study 
GW642444 was given to Sprague Dawley rats (60/sex/group) at estimated achieved doses of 0, 10.5, 84.4, 
223 and 657 mcg/kg/day for 60 minutes once daily for 85 weeks by nose-only inhalation. Due to increased 
mortality dosing was stopped for females given 223 and 657 mcg/kg/day at Week 85 (26 and 23 animals 
surviving in these groups, respectively). These females remained on study without further treatment until 
group survival fell to 15 (Weeks 95 or 96, respectively) at which time they were electively killed. The doses 
of the remaining females were reduced from Week 86 to 3.47 (from 10.5) and 28.2 (from 84.4) mcg/kg/day 
by decreasing the daily exposure duration from 60 to 20 minutes for the remainder of the study. Females at 
84.4/28.2  mcg/kg/day  were  terminated  in  Week  95  due  to  survival  reaching  15.  Control  females  and 
females given 10.5/3.47 mcg/kg/day were killed in Week 104. All males were electively killed in Week 101 
when the number of survivors in the control group fell to less than 20. 
Early  mortality  associated  with  pituitary  neoplasms  was  observed  in  male  rats  given  ≥223  mcg/kg/day 
GW642444 and females given ≥84.4/28.2 mcg/kg/day. In both sexes this finding was proposed to be the 
result  of  pharmacologically-mediated  increased  body  weight  gain  in  the  early  stages  of  the  study  and 
increased food consumption. In females hormonal imbalance resulting from pharmacologically-mediated, 
dose related, increase incidence and severity (size) of ovarian follicular cysts may have contributed to the 
reduced latency of the pituitary findings. 
An  increased  incidence  of  mesovarian  smooth  muscle  hyperplasia/hypertrophy  and  of  mesovarian 
leiomyomata was seen in females given ≥84.4/28.2 mcg/kg/day. The findings were present in decedent 
females and those surviving to terminal kill and are considered a consequence of prolonged β2-adrenergic 
stimulation.   
GW642444 systemic exposure (AUC0-t) to male rats based on combined values from Weeks 4 and 26 were 
0.420,  8.52,  16.9  and  51.8  ng.h/mL  at  10.5,  84.4,  223  and  657  mcg/kg/day,  respectively.  GW642444 
systemic  exposure  (AUC0-t)  to  female  rats  based  on  combined  values  from  Weeks  4  and  26  and 
extrapolating  to  lowered  doses  were  0.215/0.0711,  9.72/3.25,  18.7  and  55.7  ng.h/mL  at  10.5/3.47,

84.4/28.2, 223 and 657 mcg/kg/day, respectively. Following treatment with GW642444, systemic exposure 
was  also  demonstrated  to  GI17910  (counterion)  and  the  major  human  metabolites  (GSK932009  and 
GW630200). 
Reproductive and Developmental toxicity 
Fluticasone Furoate/Umeclidinium/Vilanterol 
No reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were carried out as agreed with CHMP, Scientific Advice 
EMEA/H/SA/2498/2/2013/I,  and  in  accordance  with  ICH  guidance  ICH  M3  (R2).  Previous  findings  in 
reproductive  toxicity  studies  with  FF  were  typical  of  those  seen  following  systemic  exposure  to  potent 
corticosteroids.  In  the  rat  there  was  no  effect  on  male  fertility,  and  only  a  slight  increased  incidence  of 
prolonged oestrus cycles in females. There was also no effect on offspring in the pre- and post-natal study. 
Although  corticosteroids  are  generally  teratogenic  in  animal  species,  FF  was  not  teratogenic.  There  was 
however,  evidence  of  delayed/incomplete  ossification  of  sternebrae  in  rat  fetuses  and  abortion  of  rabbit 
fetuses, though each at doses associated with maternal toxicity. UMEC had no effects on male or female 
mating performance or fertility, nor any effects on embryofetal survival and development in either the rat or 
rabbit. VI did not affect male or female rat fertility nor did it produce any adverse effects on the developing 
rat fetus. However, in the rabbit, inhaled doses of  VI caused  a  number of class-related but inconsistent 
findings  such  as  cleft  palate,  open  eyelids,  sternebral  fusion  and  abnormal  frontal  bone  ossification. 
Co-administration of FF and VI in a rat embryofetal development study did not reveal any new effects. 
Fluticasone furoate (GW685698) 
Male fertility 
GW685698 or vehicle (lactose) was administered by inhalation once a day for 1 hour to groups of 25 male 
Wistar  Han  rats  at  estimated  achieved  doses  of  6.6,  12.9  and  29.4  mcg/kg/day  for  28  days  prior  to 
cohabitation with females, during cohabitation, and through to necropsy on Day 69 to 73. 
A dose-dependent reduction in body weight progression and food intake was observed at all doses.  No other 
clinical signs or macroscopic pathological findings were observed. There were no effects on fertility of the 
males or early embryonic development of the offspring of untreated females with which they were mated. 
The  No  Observed  Adverse  Effect  Level  (NOAEL)  for  reproduction  and  fertility  of  male  rats  of  the  F0 
generation and on the early in utero development of the F1 generation was 29.4 mcg/kg/day. 
Female fertility, early embryonic and embryofetal development 
GW685698 or vehicle (lactose) was administered by inhalation, once a day for 1 hour, to groups of 22 female 
Wistar Han rats at estimated achieved doses of 0, 11, 23 and 91 mcg/kg/day from 2 weeks prior to mating 
until gestation Day 17. 
Animals receiving 91 mcg/kg/day showed overall body weight loss during the first week of dosing followed 
by a period of lower body weight gain persisting into the first half of the gestation period. This was coupled 
with slightly reduced food consumption. 
There  were  no  clinical  signs,  macroscopic  findings,  adverse  effects  upon  mating  performance,  pre-coital 
interval or fertility related to treatment with GW685698. A slightly higher incidence of longer oestrus cycles 
(4 or 5 days) was observed in animals at 91 mcg/kg/day. No major skeletal or visceral abnormalities were 
noted in the foetuses from females at any dose. However, lower fetal weight (5%) and related increased 
incidence of fetuses with incompletely ossified sternebrae were noted in females exposed to 91 mcg/kg/day. 
Owing to these effects, the NOAEL for fertility, early embryonic and embryofoetal development in the rat was 
considered to be 23 mcg/kg/day.

A preliminary study was conducted to evaluate the toxicity of GW685698 when administered by inhalation to 
pregnant New Zealand white rabbits. This provided sufficient information to select doses for a subsequent 
definitive embryofoetal development study in the rabbit.  In the preliminary study, groups of 6 female New 
Zealand  white  rabbits  were  treated,  from  gestation  day  8  to  20,  with  vehicle  (lactose)  or  GW685698. 
Animals were exposed once a day for 1 hour at estimated achieved doses of 9.7, 46.6 and 85.1 mcg/kg/day. 
Dose-related  reductions  in  maternal  body  weight  gain  were  evident  at  all  dose  levels  together  with  a 
reduction in food consumption at 9.7 and 46.6 mcg/kg/day. There were no clinical signs related to treatment 
with GW685698.  All rabbits at 85.1 mcg/kg/day and 2 of 6 females at 46.6 mcg/kg/day were terminated 
between  gestation  day  19  and  23  following  abortion  of  their  fetuses.  Post-implantation  losses  were 
increased and litter weights reduced in all GW685698 treated groups. Mean foetal weights were also lower 
in animals treated at 46.6 mcg/kg/day. Due to the effects on maternal and fetal body weight, a targeted high 
dose of 10 mcg/kg/day was considered suitable for a subsequent definitive study. 
In  the  definitive  study,  GW685698  or  vehicle  (lactose)  was  administered  (1  hour/day)  by  inhalation  to 
groups of 22 female New Zealand white rabbits from gestation Day 8 to 20 at estimated achieved doses of 
1.8, 3.2 and 8.1 mcg/kg/day. 
A transient loss in body weight was noted in all GW685698 treated groups over the first 4 days of treatment, 
thereafter,  weight  gain  was  comparable  to  controls.  There  were  no  treatment  related  effects  on  food 
consumption or clinical signs. 
There were also no treatment related effects on corpora lutea, implantation count, placental or foetal weight. 
An increased incidence of incompletely ossified sternebrae and metacarpals/phalages was seen in foetuses 
from  animals  treated  at  3.2  or  8.1  mcg/kg/day.  However,  since  there  was  a  greater  incidence  at  3.2 
mcg/kg/day  than  8.1  mcg/kg/day  and  there  was  no  associated  effect  on  fetal  weight,  this  finding  is 
considered  to  be  unrelated  to  treatment.    A  NOAEL  of  8.1  mcg/kg/day  was  ascribed  for  embryofoetal 
development in the rabbit. 
Pre- and post-natal development study 
To investigate potential effects on pregnancy, parturition and lactation, and on pre- and post-natal survival, 
growth,  development,  and  reproductive  performance  of  offspring,  GW685698  or  vehicle  (lactose)  was 
administered by inhalation to groups of 22 or 23 female Wistar Han rats from gestation day 6 to 20 and Days 
2 to at least Day 21 post partum. Animals were exposed once daily for 1 hour at estimated achieved doses 
of 0, 5.5, 15.7 and 27.2 mcg/kg/day. The female F0 generation were allowed to deliver naturally. At 84 days 
post partum, the F1 generation males and females were cohabited in a ratio of 1 to 1 for up to 14 days. 
Mated F1 females were allowed to deliver naturally and they and their litters (F2 generation) were evaluated 
on Day 7 post partum. 
In the F0 generation, dose dependent reductions in body weight gain were observed in pregnant dams given 
15.7  or  27.2  mcg/kg/day,  resulting  in  lower  body  weights  compared  to  controls.  At  15.7  and  27.2 
mcg/kg/day, lower food consumption was also evident. The gestation index, length of gestation, numbers of 
live and dead pups, sex ratio, and live birth index were unaffected by treatment with GW685698. 
For the F1 generation pups, viability, survival and lactation indices, clinical condition, pup weights and gross 
pathology  were  unaffected  by  treatment  of  the  F0  Dams.  Development  of  these  pups  to  adulthood  was 
similarly  unaffected  (including  preputial  separation  and  vaginal  opening).  Behavioural  performance 
(assessed by motor activity, auditory startle habituation and water maze) was comparable to controls. 
Following mating of the F1 generation, all measured parameters, including mating index, fertility index and 
conception rate, gestation index and gestation length, sex ratio, and numbers of live, dead and malformed 
pups were comparable to controls. Pup viability and survival indices, clinical condition, pup body weights and 
terminal examinations were also undisturbed in the F2 generation compared to controls.

The NOAEL for developmental (F1/F2) effects was considered to be 27.2 mcg/kg/day. 
Umeclidinium (GSK573719) 
Fertility 
In reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in the rat and rabbit, UMEC had no effects on male or 
female mating performance or fertility at inhaled doses of up to 180 and 294 mcg/kg/day, respectively. The 
male  fertility  study  and  the  pre-and  post-natal  study  in  rats  were  conducted  by  subcutaneous 
administration; however, considering the high exposure observed by this route of administration, this is not 
considered  an  issue.  Systemic  exposure  at  the  NOAEL  in  maternal  rats  was  approximately  80  times  the 
exposure in humans at the proposed commercial dose of 62.4 μg/kg/day. 
Embryo-foetal development 
No effects on embryofetal survival and development were seen in either the rat or rabbit following inhaled 
doses up to 278 and 306 mcg/kg/day, respectively or in the rabbit following subcutaneous doses up to 180 
mcg/kg/day. 
Pre- and post-natal development study 
In a rat pre-and post-natal study, slightly decreased pre-weaning pup body weights in litters was related to 
a decreased maternal body weight gain and food consumption. There were no other effects on pre-natal or 
post-natal development.

Vilanterol (GW642444) 
Male fertility 
GW642444 (as the triphenylacetate salt, GW642444M) was administered as a dry powder formulation to 
male  Sprague  Dawley  rats  (25/group)  at  estimated  achieved  doses  of  0  (vehicle),  62,  824  or  31508 
mcg/kg/day (4 or 40% w/w blend in lactose) once daily for 60 minutes by nose only inhalation for 54 to 57 
days. After 14 days of treatment, treated males were co-habited 1:1 with untreated females. Mated females 
were separated from the males and considered to be on Day 0 post coitum (pc). Mated females and their 
litters were euthanized on Day 20 pc. 
Paternal effects were evidenced at 824 and 31508 mcg/kg/day by increased  body weight gain and post 
dosing  clinical  signs  (salivation,  periorbital  fur  staining  and/or  wetness  of  the  muzzle  and  lower  jaw 
associated  with  salivation).  Mating,  fertility  and  conception  rate  were  unaffected.  Slight  organ  weight 
differences  in  epididymis  ventral  prostate  and  seminal  vesicles  at  824  and  31508  mcg/kg/day  were 
inconsequential  to  mating  or  fertility  and  therefore  not  considered  adverse  effects.  The  NOAEL  for  male 
fertility was considered to be ≥31508 mcg/kg/day. 
Female fertility and early embryonic development 
The effects of GW642444 on mating and fertility and on early embryonic development to implantation were 
assessed in a study in Sprague Dawley rats. GW642444 (as the triphenylacetate salt, GW642444M) was 
administered as a dry powder formulation to mated females (25/group) at estimated achieved doses of 0 
(vehicle), 49.4 or 664 mcg/kg/day (as a 4% blend in lactose) or 37112 mcg/kg/day (as a 40% blend in 
lactose)  via  snout  only  inhalation  (1  hour)  for  15  days  before  co-habitation,  during  co-habitation  with 
untreated males (1 to 12 days) and on Days 0 to 6 pc. Mated females and their litters were euthanized on 
Day 20 pc. 
Evidence of maternal effects was noted at ≥49.4 mcg/kg/day as indicated by increased body weight and 
body  weight  gains.  There  was  no  evidence  of  an  adverse  effect  on  female  fertility  or  early  embryonic 
development.  Based  on  these  results,  the  NOAEL  for  effects  on  female  fertility  and  early  embryonic 
development in this study was considered to be ≥37112 mcg/kg/day. 
Embryo-foetal development 
GW642444 (as the triphenylacetate salt, GW642444M) was administered as a dry powder formulation to 
mated females Sprague Dawley rats (22/group) at estimated achieved doses of 0 (vehicle), 45.4 or 613 
mcg/kg/day (as a 4% blend in lactose) or 33733 mcg/kg/day (as a 40% blend in lactose) via snout only 
inhalation (1 hour) on Days 6 to 17 pc. Mated females and their litters were euthanized on Day 21 pc. 
Maternal  effects  at  ≥613  mcg/kg/day  was  evidenced  by  substantially  increased  body  weight  gains  and 
increased  or  decreased  food  consumption.  There  was  no  evidence  of  an  adverse  effect  on  pregnancy 
(numbers of corpora lutea, implantation sites, live fetuses and dead fetuses, resorptions, sex ratio, and the 
pre  and  post  implantation  losses)  or  on  embryofetal  development  (no  major  malformations  nor  minor 
external, visceral or skeletal anomalies). Based on these results, the developmental NOAEL on this study 
was considered to be >33733 mcg/kg/day. 
A study was performed to establish tolerated doses in the non-pregnant rabbit, to assess the effects on 
progress  and  outcome  of  pregnancy  in  rabbits,  and  to  establish  suitable  doses  for  a  main  embryo-fetal 
development  study.  GW642444  (as  the  triphenylacetate  salt,  GW642444M)  was  administered  as  a  dry 
powder  formulation  (40%  (w/w)  blend  in  lactose)  to  groups  of  non-pregnant  (4/group)  and  pregnant 
(5/group)  New  Zealand  white  rabbits,  at  estimated  achieved  doses  of  447,  1350,  5120,  19600 
(non-pregnant) and 0, 5330 and 18800 mcg/kg/day (pregnant), via snout only inhalation (1 hour) for up to 
13 days which in the pregnant animals was from Days 7 to 19 pc. 
Assessment report  
EMA/25056/2018 
Page 59/106 
  
  
Treatment with GW642444 at doses up to 19600 mcg/kg/day was well tolerated by unmated female rabbits 
following snout-only inhalation administration for 1 hour per day for up to 13 days. Treatment of pregnant 
female rabbits from Days 7 to 19 pc at 5330 or 18800 mcg/kg/day was associated with lower group mean 
food consumption during the first 2 days of treatment (Days 7 to 8 pc). Unacceptable levels of intrauterine 
deaths  were  noted  at  18800  mcg/kg/day.  Open  eyelid  was  evident  in  fetuses  at  5330  and  18800 
mcg/kg/day, limb, snout and palate malformations were also noted at 18800 mcg/kg/day. 
Toxicokinetic evaluation on Day 5 of treatment (Day 11 post coitum) at 5330 mcg/kg/day revealed study 
exposure normalised AUC0-t of 244 ng.h/mL and Cmax of 110 ng/mL  
In the main pivotal study, GW642444 (as the triphenylacetate salt, GW642444M) was administered as a dry 
powder  formulation  (7%  (w/w)  blend  in  lactose)  to  mated  New  Zealand  white  rabbits  (22/group)  at 
estimated achieved doses of 0 (vehicle), 62.7, 591 and 5740 mcg/kg/day via snout only inhalation (1 hour) 
from Days 7 to 19 pc. Pregnant rabbits and their litters were killed on Day 29 pc. 
Mean fetal weight was low at 5740 mcg/kg/day. GW642444 at 5740 mcg/kg/day caused open/partially open 
eyelids/punctate  opening,  cleft  palate  and  forelimb  flexure/malrotation.  Also,  at  62.7  mcg/kg/day  there 
were  open/partially  open  eyelids/punctuate  opening  and  cleft  palate.  A  dose  relationship  was  not 
established  (these  abnormalities  were  not  found  at  591  mcg/kg/day),  suggesting  the  aetiology  of  the 
findings at the low dose may be multifactoral (test article and other factors). In addition, there were higher 
incidences  of  fetuses/litters  with  bridges  of  ossification/partially  fused/fused  sternebral  centres,  small 
misshapen  interparietals,  enlarged  anterior/posterior  fontanelle,  incomplete  ossification  of  the  5th 
sternebrae,  epiphyses  and  metacarpals/phalanges  and  an  associated  costal  cartilage  abnormality  in  the 
5740  mcg/kg/day  group  compared  with  controls,  which  may  reflect  the  lower  mean  fetal  weight  in  this 
group.    A  clear  developmental  no  observable  adverse  effect  level  (NOAEL)  for  GW642444M  was  not 
identified in this study. The exposure (normalised AUC and Cmax) at the lowest dose of 62.7 mcg/kg/day 
were 3.76 ng.h/mL and 2.07 ng/mL, respectively. 
Subcutaneous  studies  were  conducted  in  the  rabbit  in  order  to  determine  whether  the  low  incidence  of 
developmental effects observed following inhalation administration of GW642444 could be reproduced.  In 
a dose range finding study,  GW642444 (as the triphenylacetate salt, GW642444M) was administered at 
doses  of  20,  200  and  2000  mcg/kg/day,  via  subcutaneous  injection  (formulated  as  a  solution  in  20/80 
PEG400/8% 2HPBC), to pregnant New Zealand white rabbits (4/group) from Day 7 to 11 pc. Mated females 
and their litters were euthanized on Day 12 pc. GW642444 produced no effects on clinical signs, body weight 
or food consumption and all animals were pregnant at scheduled euthanasia. At the highest tolerated dose 
of  2000  mcg/kg/day  AUC0-t  and  Cmax  values  were  2160  mcg.h/mL  and  408  mcg/mL,  respectively,  for 
GW642444. 
In  the  main  pivotal  study,  GW642444  (as  the  triphenylacetate  salt,  GW642444M)  was  administered  to 
pregnant New Zealand white rabbits (22/group) at doses of 0 (vehicle alone), 3, 7, 30 or 300 mcg/kg/day, 
via subcutaneous injection (formulated as a solution in 20/80 PEG400/8% 2HPBC), from Days 7 to 19 pc. 
Mated females and their litters were euthanized on Day 29 pc. 
Maternal body weights were increased at 30 and 300 mcg/kg/day, while food consumption was decreased at 
300  mcg/kg/day  at  the  end  of  the  drug  treatment  period.  Fetal  body  weights  were  reduced  at  300 
mcg/kg/day and fetal skeletal variations (less than the expected number of ossified forepaw metacarpals, 
talus bone not ossified, and cervical vertebral centrum not ossified) indicative of developmental delay were 
also observed at this dose level. Open eye, a malformation, observed in one fetus at 300 mcg/kg/day was 
considered treatment-related since it was observed at a similar plasma exposure in another study when 
GW642444 was administered by inhalation, and it is a common finding in rabbit fetuses when β2-agonists 
are administered to does by inhalation administration. The NOAEL for embryofetal development in rabbits 
was therefore 30 mcg/kg/day based upon the decreased fetal weights, fetal skeletal variations indicative of 
developmental  delay  and  the  observation  of  open  eye  at  300  mcg/kg/day.  The  AUC0-t  values  at  30 
Assessment report

mcg/kg/day for GW642444 and its counterion GI179710 (triphenylacetate) were 22.4 and 18.4 ng.h/mL, 
respectively, and the Cmax values for these 2 analytes were 6.26 and 12.4 ng/mL, respectively. 
Pre- and post-natal development study 
GW642444  (as  the  triphenylacetate  salt,  GW642444M)  was  given  to  groups  of  mated  female  Sprague 
Dawley  rats  (24/group)  by  oral  gavage  administration  at  doses  of  0  (vehicle),  300,  3000  and  10000 
mcg/kg/day beginning on Day 6 pc and continuing to Day 20 post partum (pp) as a suspension in 1.0% w/v 
aqueous methylcellulose. F0 females were allowed to deliver naturally. Mated (F0) females were euthanized 
on Day 21 pp. On Postnatal Day (PND) 21, 46 to 48 F1 males and 46 to 48 F1 females were assigned to each 
dose  group  and  assigned  to  one  of  two  subsets.  Subset  1  was  selected  for  PND  77  auditory  startle 
habituation evaluation and reproductive performance. Mated F1 females assigned to Subset 1 were allowed 
to deliver naturally and the dams and F2 litters were evaluated until Day 7 pp. Subset 2 was selected for 
motor  activity,  PND  45  auditory  startle  habituation,  and  Morris  water  maze  evaluations.  F1  offspring 
assigned to Subset 2 were euthanized after behaviour testing was completed. F1 males assigned to Subset 
1 were euthanized following completion of the cohabitation period, and F1 females assigned to Subset 1 
were allowed to deliver naturally, and were then euthanized with their litters (F2 offspring) on Day 7 pp. 
Increases in the mean maternal F0 body weight and body weight gains throughout the post coitum and post 
partum periods at all dose levels with a related increase in food consumption during the post coitum period 
at 10 mg/kg/day and an increase in the average delivery time per pup at 10 mg/kg/day were considered to 
be  related  to  the  pharmacology.  There  were  no  other  adverse  effects  on  maternal  (F0)  pregnancy, 
parturition, lactation or offspring (F1) survival.   
Pre- and post-weaning body weights were decreased in the 3 and 10 mg/kg/day dose groups without any 
adverse  consequences  to  other  measures  of  growth  and  development.  There  were  no  effects  on  F1 
neurobehavioral or reproductive function (F1 pregnancy, parturition and lactation) or F2 survival. 
The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for maternal (F0) reproductive function as well as effects on 
pre- and post-natal development of the offspring in rats is 10 mg/kg/day; the highest group tested. 
Immunotoxicity 
Fluticasone Furoate/Umeclidinium/Vilanterol 
A weight of evidence review for potential immunotoxicity was carried out. Overall immune-related findings 
attributed to FF in preclinical toxicity studies were typical of those previously reported for systemic exposure 
to glucocorticoids, immunosuppression and worsening of existing infections, and were largely reversible on 
withdrawal of treatment. Further, despite the immunosuppressive effects common to drugs of this class, 
tumour  immunosurveillance  did  not  appear  to  be  affected.  There  were  no  findings  in general  toxicology 
studies that indicated a direct effect of UMEC on the immune system. Immune-related findings in general 
toxicology  studies  included  hyperplasia,  metaplasia  and  inflammatory  cell  infiltration  in  the  upper 
respiratory tract of mice, rats and dogs, and interstitial, bronchoalveolar and granulomatous inflammation in 
lung of dogs, and were considered secondary to irritancy or foreign body reactions, respectively. It is likely 
that these changes are a secondary reaction to inhaled exogenous material in animals where the mucus 
defence  mechanism  has  been  compromised  by  administration  of  supra-pharmacological  doses  of 
anti-muscarinics and are not directly related to test article. VI alone produced findings generally consistent 
with  the  expected  class  effects  of  inhaled  beta2-agonists,  respiratory  tract  irritancy,  and  there  was  no 
consistent evidence of unintended immunomodulation in general toxicology studies. In combination toxicity 
studies test article related finding consistent with the expected class effects of administration of either a 
corticosteroid or long-acting muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist were noted. There were no new 
toxicities in animals exposed to two or all three test compounds in combination relative to either test article 
alone that indicated immunotoxicity.

Fluticasone furoate (GW685698) 
The tolerability of an aerosol formulation of GW685698 during daily 1 hour inhalation exposures for 5 days, 
and the sensitisation potential of GW685698 when inhaled for 1 hour for 5 consecutive days, followed by a 
17 day off-drug period and a single 1 hour inhalation challenge exposure, was investigated in the guinea pig.  
In the tolerability arm of this study, groups of 5 male guinea pigs were given 0 (air only) and an estimated 
achieved dose of 70.6 mcg/kg/day) GW685698 once daily for 5 days by nose only inhalation. The daily doses 
of GW685698 were well tolerated.  
To assess the sensitisation potential of GW685698, groups of 10 male guinea pigs were given GW685698X 
(0,  67.1,  71.2  mcg/kg/day)  via  inhalation  for  60  minutes  for  5  consecutive  days,  followed  by  a  17  day 
off-drug period and a single 60 minute inhalation challenge exposure (ovalbumin or saline). 
There was no evidence of respiratory hypersensitivity reactions in guinea pigs exposed to 5 daily doses of 
GW685698  followed  by  a  single  inhalation  challenge  exposure  17  days  later.    The  positive  control 
(ovalbumin) did elicit an acute anaphylactic reaction. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The provided ERA demonstrated that fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium bromide and vilanterol trifenatate 
PEC surfacewater values are below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and are not PBT substances as log Kow does 
not exceed 4.5.  Results from chronic aquatic toxicity tests revealed that both umeclidinium bromide and 
vilanterol  trifenatate  are  very  toxic  to  alga.    Umeclidinium  bromide  was  also toxic  to  daphnia  in  chronic 
studies but toxicity was not exhibited in the chronic fish study.  Likewise, vilanterol trifenatate was harmful 
to daphnia in chronic  aquatic studies and toxicity was exhibited in the chronic fish study. However, test 
concentrations associated with these effects are orders of magnitude in excess of the PEC in surface water 
and therefore umeclidinium bromide and vilanterol trifenatate are unlikely to represent a risk at the aquatic 
environment. Because fluticasone furoate is a glucocorticoid and as such could be considered as a potential 
endocrine  disruptor,  the  applicant  investigated  the  potential  endocrine  activity  of  this  compound. 
Accordingly,  a  fish  early  life-stage  test  was  conducted,  as  a  range-finder  to  set  concentrations  for  an 
extended early life-stage test. The study concluded that no statistically significant effects were observed 
between the controls and any of the test concentrations in terms of hatching success, post-hatch survival, 
growth  or  spawning  ability.  Consequently,  fluticasone  furoate,  umeclidinium  bromide  and  vilanterol 
trifenatate are not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The  applicant  has  performed  a13-week  repeat  dose  toxicity  with  the  triple  fixed  dose  combination  of 
FF/UMEC/VI study in Beagle dogs with appropriate toxicokinetics sampling. This study used a 4:5:1 fixed 
combination of FF:UMEC:VI which differs from the proposed clinical combination of 4:2.5:1, however, since 
this  difference  involves  a  reduced  level  of  UMEC  the  combination  used  for  the  non-clinical  studies  is 
considered acceptable.  
In this bridging study observed toxic effects are primarily considered to be known corticosteroid, muscarinic 
antagonist or beta2 agonist class effects associated with their primary pharmacology and indicative of local 
irritant effects of the compounds.   
A weight of evidence review for potential immunotoxicity was carried out. Overall immune-related findings 
attributed to FF in preclinical toxicity studies were typical of those previously reported for systemic exposure 
to glucocorticoids. There were no findings in general toxicology studies that indicated a direct effect of UMEC 
on the immune system. VI alone produced findings generally consistent with the expected class effects of 
inhaled beta2-agonists.

EMA/25056/2018 
Page 62/106 
  
  
Based on the studies presented and the proposed clinical dose, the FDC (fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium 
bromide and vilanterol trifenatate Inhalation Powder -– Trelegy Ellipta and Elebrato Ellipta) would not be 
considered to represent a potential for toxicity than those already known for each monocomponent of the 
pharmacological classes. The findings do not raise any new significant safety concerns for the clinical use of 
Trelegy  Ellipta  and  Elebrato  Ellipta  as  an  inhalation  powder  at  the  proposed  human  therapeutic  dose  of 
100/62.5/25 mcg/day (fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium bromide and vilanterol trifenatate). 
The  pharmacodynamic,  pharmacokinetic  and  toxicological  effects  of  fluticasone  furoate,  umeclidinium 
bromide and vilanterol trifenatate alone and in combination are considered to have been well characterised 
in non-clinical studies considering also the available data related to each monocomponent.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the non-clinical data are appropriate to support the use of Trelegy Ellipta and Elebrato Ellipta  in the 
clinical setting. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects

Clinical Programme in Support of FF/UMEC/VI 
Figure 5 
During Scientific Advice (EMEA/H/SA/2498/1/FU/1/2013/II), the CHMP agreed that a single Phase III study 
of FF/UMEC/VI versus an approved ICS/LABA (CTT116853) and two supporting studies with UMEC + FF/VI 
(200109 and 200110) could form the basis of an initial MAA thus the focus of this Clinical Overview is on the 
results of these studies. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Two randomised, single-dose, 4-period crossover clinical pharmacology studies have been performed with 
FF/UMEC/VI in healthy adult subjects (CTT116415 and 200587). They investigated the systemic exposure 
and systemic PD (CTT116415 only) of the triple combination product FF/UMEC/VI, compared with the dual 
therapies FF/VI and UMEC/VI. Total systemic exposure was similar for FF, UMEC, and VI when administered 
as a triple therapy compared with FF/VI and UMEC/VI.  
Study 200587 was a Phase 1, open-label, randomised, single-dose (4 inhalations), 4-period, 4-sequence 
crossover study in healthy subjects.   
The study was conducted at a single investigative centre, Parexel International, Harbor Hospital Centre, 7th 
floor, 3001 S. Hanover Street, Baltimore, Maryland, United States 21225, from July to September 2013.

The aim of the study was to compare the systemic PK of the components of FF/UMEC/VI triple combination 
at two dose strengths of UMEC (62.5 and 125 mcg).  The high dose strength of UMEC (125 mcg) was 
investigated as the study was conducted prior to the decision of utilising only the lower dose of UMEC (62.5 
mcg) in clinical development. 
In addition, the FF/VI (100/25 mcg) and UMEC/VI (62.5/25 mcg) dual combination arm was included to 
compare the individual components in the triple versus dual combination.  In order to adequately 
characterise the systemic PK profile for each component, subjects received a supra-therapeutic (4-fold 
multiple) dose of the fixed-dose combination (FF/UMEC/VI 100/62.5/25 and 100/125/25 mcg, and FF/VI 
100/25 mcg and UMEC/VI 62.5/25 mcg).  Study drug was administered as four inhalations by dry powder 
inhaler (DPI) at each dosing session.  
Study CTT116415 was a Phase I, randomised, double-blind, single-centre, single-dose (4 inhalations), 
4-period, 4-sequence crossover study in healthy subjects.  The aim of the study was to assess the PK and PD 
of FF, UMEC, and VI and to compare the systemic PK of the components of FF/UMEC/VI triple combination 
at the high dose strength of UMEC (125 mcg) versus each dual combination FF/VI (100/25 mcg) and 
FF/UMEC (100/125 mcg).  The high dose strength of UMEC (125 mcg) was investigated in CTT116415 
because the study was conducted prior to the decision of utilising only the lower dose of UMEC (62.5 mcg) 
through clinical development.  In order to adequately characterise the systemic PK profile for each 
component, the healthy volunteer subjects received a supra-therapeutic (4-fold multiple) dose of the triple 
fixed-dose combination (FF /UMEC/VI (100/62.5/25 mcg), FF/VI (100/25 mcg), and FF/UMEC 
(100/125mcg). Study drug was therefore administered as four inhalations via a DPI at each dosing session. 
In addition to plasma, urine was collected to provide complementary PK data for UMEC.  It is important to 
note that although FF/UMEC was used as a treatment arm in CTT116415, no data from FF/UMEC has been 
used to support comparability of PK or PD properties in the current submission.   
Table 13 provides an overview of the PK results for individual parameters for FF, UMEC, and VI from the two 
studies.

2.4.3.  Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
The  PK  profile  of  the  components  of  FF/UMEC/VI  in  subjects  with  COPD  has  been  characterised  using 
population PK in the pivotal Study CTT116853. 
A subset of 152 randomised subjects from selected countries; 74 subjects on FF/UMEC/VI combination and 
78 subjects on BUD/FOR provided blood samples at Weeks 12 and 24 for PK assessment. A population PK 
approach was employed in this study with samples collected from two subsets of COPD subjects (i.e., 
different subjects providing sparse and serial samples): 
• 
• 
PK  Subset  A  (sparse  PK  samples):  Approximately  130  subjects  (to  achieve  approximately  64 
subjects treated with FF/UMEC/VI) had two blood samples at each of two visits collected as follows: 
o  Visit 5 (Week 12): Pre-dose and in the window 5 to 15 minutes post-dose 
o  Visit 6 (Week 24): In the windows 5 to 15 minutes and 45 to 90 minutes post-dose 
PK Subset B (serial PK samples): A subset of subjects provided 24-hour serial spirometry at Visit 6 
(Week 24/Day 168). Approximately 20 subjects (to achieve approximately 10 subjects treated with 
FF/UMEC/VI) had 7 blood samples collected as follows: 
o  Visit 6 (Week 24): Pre-dose and in the windows 5 to 15 minutes, 45 to 90 minutes, 2.5 to 4 
hours, 6 to 8 hours, 10 to 12 hours, and 23 to 24 hours post-morning dose. 
Analysis Methods: 
FF,  UMEC,  and  VI  plasma  data  were  used  for  population  PK  analyses  using  non-linear  mixed  effects 
modelling with NONMEM programme version 7.1.2. 
Due to the availability of extensive clinical pharmacology data (including population PK) for FF, UMEC, and 
VI from the mono and dual programmes, along with the limited sample size in the study, there was no plan 
to undertake covariate analysis for assessing the influence of subject demographics and baseline 
characteristics on the PK of FF, UMEC, and VI. Two methodologies were used in analysing the sparse data in 
CTT116853. Monte Carlo simulations of previously reported population PK models for FF, UMEC, and VI in 
COPD subjects were undertaken. The time course of sparse observed PK data from study CTT116853 was 
overlaid on the 90% prediction intervals from the simulations. In addition, a model-based estimation 
approach was applied whereby the plasma data for FF, UMEC, and VI from CTT116853 were combined with 
the respective historical data used to develop population PK models for FF, UMEC, and VI. Model parameter 
estimates were compared following analysis of the combined dataset (historical data set and CTT116853) 
versus the original historical data (without CTT116853). The below the limit of quantification (BLQ) data 
were treated as censored data and analysed with the full likelihood approach. 
Two population PK models in subjects with COPD for VI were available to support the UMEC/VI and FF/VI 
combination therapies. The systemic exposure of VI estimated from the VI population PK model in UMEC/VI 
programme was, on average, higher for Cmax and AUC at steady state compared with that obtained from 
the VI population PK model from the FF/VI programme. Thus, a decision was made to utilise the VI 
population PK model from the UMEC/VI programme to analyse the VI data in CTT116853 from a safety 
perspective. The adequacies of the population PK model were assessed through diagnostic plots and visual

predictive checks. The post-hoc individual parameter estimates from each model for FF, UMEC, and VI were 
utilised to estimate population exposure values. The geometric mean and the associated 95% CIs of AUC 
and Cmax at steady state are summarised for FF, UMEC, and VI from CTT116853 and compared with results 
from historical data from the previous models. 
Results: 
Post-hoc estimates of model parameters from CTT116853 were within the range observed from historical 
data with FF, UMEC, and VI. This was further confirmed using the model-based estimation approach where 
there were no marked changes in the PK parameter estimates of FF, UMEC,  and VI using the combined 
dataset (CTT116853 and historical data) versus the historical data (without data from CTT116853). 
Based  on  the  post-hoc  PK  parameter  estimates  for  FF,  UMEC,  and  VI  following  the  triple  fixed-dose 
combination (FF/UMEC/VI), steady state systemic exposures were computed and are summarised in Table 
14.

Table 11 Summary of Cmax and AUC Results for FF, UMEC, and VI from CTT116853 and 
Historical Data 
Historical Data 
The steady state AUC over the dosing interval for FF, UMEC, and VI estimated from the population analysis 
in CTT116853 (with FF/UMEC/VI) is within the range of the historical data in subjects with COPD given mono 
or dual combination therapies. Although Cmax at steady state for FF following FF/UMEC/VI was also in the 
range of historical data, corresponding Cmax values for UMEC and VI were generally lower with FF/UMEC/VI 
compared with historical data with dual combinations. The lower Cmax values for UMEC and VI are not 
expected to be clinically relevant with respect to safety or efficacy following triple FF/UMEC/VI combination. 
2.4.4.  Pharmacodynamics 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The supra-therapeutic dose of all components and particularly umeclidinium are not fully informative for the 
purpose of this application. However, given that all three active components are been authorised at the 
proposed doses, this could be acceptable. A PK/PD study, or studies performed with doses to be used in 
clinical practice would have been more informative.

The three components of Elebrato have been approved and have been widely used singly and in fixed double

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose-response studies and main clinical studies 
Study CTT116853 was a Phase III, 24 week, randomised, double blind, double dummy, parallel group 
comparison of the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the fixed dose triple combination FF/UMEC/VI 
(100/62.5/25 mcg) administered once daily in the morning via a dry powder inhaler with 
budesonide/formoterol 400mcg/12mcg administered twice-daily subjects with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease. There was an extension to 52 weeks in a subset of subjects.  
The study was conducted at 162 investigative centres in fifteen countries in Europe and Asia, from January 
2015 to April 2016.   
Objectives 
The primary aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of FF/UMEC/VI on lung function and health related 
quality of life (HRQoL) compared with BUD/FOR after 24 weeks of treatment. 
Secondary objectives were to evaluate the effect of FF/UMEC/VI compared with BUD/FOR on the annual rate 
of exacerbations and to evaluate the safety profile of FF/UMEC/VI compared with BUD/FOR over 24 weeks 
and 52 weeks of treatment.  
The overall scheme for the 24 week part of the study is shown diagrammatically below.  
Methods 
Subjects who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria at screening entered a two week run-in period. During 
which they remained on their existing COPD medications and were provided with short-acting salbutamol to 
be used on an as-needed basis (rescue medication). Following the run-in period, eligible subjects were 
randomised (1:1) to one of the following double-blind treatment groups: 
FF/UMEC/VI 100/62.5/25 mcg via the ELLIPTA OD in the morning and placebo via the Turbuhaler BID 
BUD/FOR 400/12 mcg via the [Symbicort] Turbuhaler BID and placebo via the ELLIPTA OD in the morning 
The randomisation was stratified based on smoking status. 
Subjects discontinued all existing COPD medications at the start of the randomised treatment period but 
could continue their study-supplied rescue salbutamol as needed. 
On-treatment clinic visits occurred after 2, 4, 12, and 24 weeks of treatment. The subset of subjects 
remaining on study treatment for up to 52 weeks had additional clinic visits at 36 weeks and 52 weeks. 
Subjects completed a daily eDiary that captured symptoms of COPD, (EXACT-RS and other symptoms 
suggestive of potential exacerbation) activity limitation, and salbutamol use. Subjects with increasing 
respiratory symptoms were automatically notified through the eDiary to contact the investigator for further 
evaluation of their increasing symptoms. The eDiary device was also used at visits to collect responses to 
other questionnaires: SGRQ-C, BDI/TDI, COPD Assessment Test (CAT), Subject Global Rating of Activity

Limitation and Global Rating of Change in Activity Level, Subject Global Impression of COPD Severity and 
Global Rating of Change in Severity, EuroQol Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L), and Inhaler Preference. 
In addition, subjects at selected centres were asked to participate in one or more additional procedures at 
the time of study entry: 
24-hour serial spirometry at screening and Week 24 (approximately 400 subjects) 
24-hour Holter monitoring at screening and Week 24 (approximately 400 subjects) 
Physical activity monitor (accelerometer) worn for 7 days from screening, for 7 days from randomisation, 
and for 7 days prior to Week 24 (up to approximately 350 subjects) 
PK blood draws (approximately 150 subjects) 
Study design 
The CHMP Scientific Advice Working Party (SAWP) agreed with a proposal to compare 
FF/UMEC/VI with an established ICS/LABA in a single study examining lung function and symptoms (St. 
George's Respiratory Questionnaire [SGRQ]) as co-primary endpoints in a study of 6 months duration (with 
an extension to 12 months in a subset of patients). 
The SAWP agreed that the proposed comparator study (CTT116853) of FF/UMEC/VI versus BUD/FOR, 
together with the supporting UMEC + FF/VI studies (200109 and 200110) could form the basis of an initial 
MAA. The CHMP noted that since the initial clinical advice, there had been two important developments 
(CHMP positive Opinions for FF/VI and for UMEC/VI) which need to be taken into consideration when 
choosing the active comparator. The CHMP recommended that use of FF/VI as an active comparator would 
be more appropriate.  
However, the CHMP acknowledged that an authorisation may be possible with superiority demonstrated only 
against one authorised fixed dose combination (ICS/LABA or LAMA/LABA), but for this the demonstrated 
superiority in efficacy must be compelling. 
The SAWP also noted that it was not necessary to repeat studies in special populations or perform drug 
interaction studies. 
The CHMP also agreed that the design of the 52-week exacerbation study (CTT116855) with regard to 
comparators, patient population, run-in, and co-primary endpoints is appropriate and acceptable and that a 
single large exacerbation study could be expected longer-term to provide sufficient evidence to support a 
claim for exacerbation benefit in the FF/UMEC/VI SmPC (EMEA/H/SA/2498/1FU/1/2013/II. 
Main Inclusion Criteria 
Male and non-pregnant female subjects at least 40 years of age who were current or former cigarette 
smokers (with at least 10 pack-years at screening) diagnosed with COPD as defined by the American 
Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) [Celli, 2004] were eligible. Subjects had to 
demonstrate at screening: 
A score of ≥10 on the COPD Assessment Test (CAT – range of possible scores 0 to 40 with higher scores 
indicating more severe disease). 
A post-bronchodilator FEV1 <50% predicted normal OR 
A post-bronchodilator FEV1 <80% predicted normal and a documented history of≥2 moderate 
exacerbations or one severe (hospitalised) exacerbation in the previous 12 months

Page 71/106 
  
  
A post-salbutamol FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio of <0.70. Percent predicted values were calculated 
using the ERS Global Lung Function Initiative reference equations. Subjects must also have been receiving 
daily maintenance treatment for their COPD for at least three months prior to screening.  
Main Exclusion Criteria 
Subjects who had a current diagnosis or asthma, COPD caused by α1-antitrypsin deficiency, other 
respiratory disorders, lung resection within 12 months of screening, or other clinically significant diseases in 
the opinion of the investigator, were not eligible.

days of screening, a respiratory tract infection that had not resolved within 7 days of screening, an abnormal 
chest X-ray, or used prohibited medications within specific time intervals prior to screening. 
The study was designed to be as inclusive as possible with regards to the inclusion of subjects with 
significant cardiovascular disease in order to allow an assessment of safety that was more representative of 
the targeted population ('real world') than often seen in clinical trials (e.g. subjects with a past history of 
previous myocardial infarction [>6 months prior to screening] and New York Heart Association Class 1–3 
heart failure were eligible and QTc exclusion criteria were broadened).

Outcomes/endpoints 
Co-Primary Endpoints 
The co-primary endpoints were; change from baseline in trough FEV1 at week 24 and change from baseline 
in SGRQ total score at week 24.   
Secondary endpoints 
Secondary endpoints were; annual rate of on-treatment moderate/severe COPD exacerbations, assessment 
of respiratory symptoms using the EXACT-RS score and sub-scale scores (breathlessness, cough and 
sputum, and chest symptoms). Transitional Dyspnoea Index (TDI) focal score at Week 24,  Daily Activity 
Question - percentage of days with a score of 2. 
Statistical methods 
For the co-primary endpoints, the null hypothesis is no difference between treatment groups (H0: μT – μS 
= 0), with the alternative hypothesis that there is a difference between treatment groups (H1: μT – μS ≠ 0), 
where μT is the mean change from baseline for FF/UMEC/VI and μS is the mean change from baseline for 
BUD/FOR. 
The treatment comparisons of primary interest were FF/UMEC/VI once daily versus BUD/FOR twice daily for 
the co-primary endpoints. The primary analyses was performed using a mixed model repeated measures 
(MMRM) analysis based on a two-sided hypothesis testing approach, and used data for the ITT population 
collected while subjects were on study medication. 
To account for multiplicity of the co-primary comparisons, the Hochberg method was used to control overall 
Type I error at α=0.05. Both comparisons were to be declared statistically significant if the unadjusted 
p-value for both was significant at the 0.05 level. Should the largest unadjusted p-value for the two 
comparisons be above 0.05, the other comparison was to be declared statistically significant if the smaller 
unadjusted p-value was below 0.025; equivalent to declaring statistical significance if the adjusted p-value 
is below 0.05. 
Assessment report  
EMA/25056/2018 
Page 73/106 
  
  
FF/UMEC/VI once daily and BUD/FOR twice daily was compared for secondary efficacy and other endpoints 
using the ITT population. If at least one of the co-primary endpoints was statistically significant, inferences 
were to be drawn from unadjusted p-values for the treatment comparisons on secondary and other 
endpoints and were declared statistically significant if below p = 0.05. If neither of the co-primary endpoints 
was statistically significant, testing on the secondary and other endpoints was to be performed and 
presented for descriptive purposes only. Secondary endpoints and other efficacy endpoints were not 
adjusted for multiplicity. Many centres enrolled a very small number of subjects and so rather than adjusting 
for centre in the statistical analyses, a geographical region was used, based on country and the number of 
randomised subjects 
MMRM model. 
There is an underlying assumption that the data are missing at random. All available scheduled 
post-baseline assessment were utilised and, via modelling of the within-subject correlation structure, the 
derived treatment differences were adjusted to take into account missing data. 
Terms in the model: 
Dependent variable: trough FEV1, trough FVC or SGRQ total score at each visit 
Categorical: treatment group, smoking status (screening), geographical region, Visit 
Continuous: baseline FEV1, baseline FVC or baseline SGRQ total score 
Interaction: baseline*Visit, treatment*Visit 
Repeated: Visit 
Two models were fitted; one with a response variable of change from baseline and one with the response 
variable as the raw value. A separate analysis using the same model and including only the subjects in the 
EXT population was provided. The analysis of FEV1 (and FVC) data for this population included FEV1 (FVC) 
data at Weeks 2, 4, 12, 24, 36 and 52. The analysis of SGRQ total score included SGRQ total scores at Weeks 
4, 24, and 52. Analysis of exacerbation data assumed a negative binomial distribution.  
Sample Size  
Sample size was based on the co-primary efficacy endpoints and prior internal data for the drug classes. It 
was expected that the mean treatment difference between an ICS/LABA/LAMA combination when compared 
with an ICS/LABA would be approximately 2 to 3 units. Based on these data 688 evaluable subjects per 
treatment arm would be required to provide 90% power to detect a difference of 2.5 units between 
FF/UMEC/VI and BUD/FOR for SGRQ total score, assuming a standard deviation of 12 units. The study had 
>90% power to detect a difference of 80 mL between FF/UMEC/VI and BUD/FOR for trough FEV1 at 24 
weeks, using a SD of 240 mL, based on results from prior trials.  As this was a single study to support the 
efficacy evidence, the powering provided was for a two sided significance level of 0.01. It was estimated that 
approximately 30% of subjects would discontinue study treatment without Week 24 data, data for subjects 
who discontinued study treatment prematurely were not explicitly imputed. Thus, to account for an 
approximately 30% withdrawal rate, 900 subjects were required for each treatment arm. 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population comprised all randomised subjects, excluding those who were 
randomised in error. A subject who was recorded as a screen or run-in failure and also randomised was 
considered to be randomised in error. Any other subject who received a randomisation number was 
considered to have been randomised. Data for the ITT Population are presented t0 Week 24. 
The Extension (EXT) Population: comprised all subjects in the ITT Population who were enrolled into the 
subset of subjects (approximately 400) with extension to 52 weeks. 
Assessment report  
EMA/25056/2018 
Page 74/106 
  
  
Subjects in the extension subset were enrolled first thus all data from the subset were available at the 
conclusion of the study. Data from extension subjects up to Week 24 are also included in safety and efficacy 
data displays for the ITT Population. The EXT Population displays include efficacy and safety data from all 
visits, including the Week 36 and Week 52 visits. The primary summaries and analyses used the ITT 
Population and many were repeated for the EXT Population. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 2121 subjects from 15 countries gave informed consent. Of the consenting subjects 59 (3%) failed 
pre-screening and 252 (12%) failed screening. Most of the screen failures were due to failure to meet the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria (219 subjects [11%]). The most frequently reported reasons for inclusion criteria 
screen failure were severity of disease (140 subjects [56%]) and a score of <10 on the CAT at Screening (17 
subjects [7%]). The most frequently reported reasons for exclusion criteria screen failure were pneumonia 
and/or COPD exacerbation (17 subjects [7%]) and abnormal chest X-ray (15 subjects [6%]).  
The majority of subjects completed the study (89.6%). Of the subjects that prematurely discontinued from 
the study, the most common reasons were decision by subject or proxy, AEs, and lack of efficacy (Table 16).

Outcomes and estimation 
Results efficacy 
The majority of subjects in the ITT population provided data on the co-primary efficacy endpoints up to Week 
24. A total of 895 out of 911 (98.2%) in the FF/UMEC/VI group and 874 out of 899 (97.2%) in the BUD/FOR 
group were included in the co-primary analysis of trough FEV1 up to Week 24 of whom 836 and 781, 
respectively, had analysable data at week 24. A total of 887 out of 911 subjects in the FF/UMEC/VI group 
and 866 out of 899 subjects in the BUD/FOR group were included in the co-primary analysis of SGRQ Total 
Score to Week 24.  
Both co-primary endpoints met the criteria for declaring statistical significance (Table 18). At Week 24, a 
clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in trough FEV1 was observed with 
FF/UMEC/VI, compared with BUD/FOR (treatment difference 171 mL, p<0.001). Additionally, clinically 
meaningful improvements from baseline in SGRQ Total Score were observed in both treatment groups, and 
FF/UMEC/VI demonstrated statistically significant improvement compared with BUD/FOR of -2.2 units 
(p<0.001). 
COPD exacerbation rates  
ITT Population: The incidence of investigator-defined COPD exacerbations over the 24-week treatment 
period was 11% in the FF/UMEC/VI group and 16% in the BUD/FOR group (Table 18). Of the subjects who 
experienced exacerbations, most had only one that was moderate or severe; few subjects had mild 
exacerbations (1% in the FF/UMEC/VI group and 2% in the BUD/FOR group). The mean duration of the 
exacerbation was similar between the treatment groups. Thirteen subjects in the FF/UMEC/VI group and 25 
subjects in the BUD/FOR group were hospitalised for a COPD Exacerbation. None of the exacerbations were 
fatal and all but two in the FF/UMEC/VI group resolved. 
EXT Population: In general, a similar exacerbation profile to the ITT Population was observed, although the 
difference in the incidence of investigator-defined exacerbations between the treatment groups was larger 
over the 52-week treatment period. Fewer subjects in the FF/UMEC/VI group experienced exacerbations 
compared with the BUD/FOR group (18% vs. 30%). The incidence of mild exacerbations remained low (1% 
in the FF/UMEC/VI group and 3% in the BUD/FOR group). Eight subjects treated with FF/UMEC/VI and 24 
subjects treated with BUD/FOR were hospitalised for a COPD Exacerbation. None of the exacerbations were 
fatal and all but one in the BUD/FOR group resolved. 
Change from Baseline in EXACT-respiratory symptom (RS) Score 
Reductions in EXACT-RS scores indicate improvement in symptoms with a clinically meaningful 
improvement score defined as a decrease in the 4-weekly mean score of ≥ 2 units from baseline.  
ITT Population: At each 4-week interval over the 24-week treatment period, FF/UMEC/VI produced 
greater reductions from baseline in EXACT-RS scores (ranged from -1.45 to -2.43) compared with BUD/FOR 
(ranged from -0.50 to -1.09). Treatment differences between FF/UMEC/VI and BUD/FOR (ranged from -0. 
95 to -1.41) were statistically significant at each 4-week interval (p<0.001). 
Assessment report  
EMA/25056/2018 
Page 76/106 
  
  
EXT Population: At each 4-week interval over the 52-week treatment period, FF/UMEC/VI produced 
greater reductions from baseline in EXACT-RS scores (ranged from -1.24 to -2.64) compared with BUD/FOR 
(ranged from -0.61 to -1.53). Treatment differences between FF/UMEC/VI and BUD/FOR (ranged from -0.52 
to -1.53) were statistically significant at almost all 4-week intervals (p<0.05) except Week 1-4. 
TDI Focal Score 
Lower TDI focal scores indicate more deterioration in severity of dyspnoea, a clinically meaningful 
improvement in dyspnoea was defined as an increase of at least 1 point in TDI focal score. 
ITT Population: At Week 24, clinically meaningful TDI focal scores were observed in both treatment 
groups, and FF/UMEC/VI demonstrated a statistically significant improvement compared with BUD/FOR of 
0.57 units (p<0.001).  
EXT Population: At Weeks 24 and 52, clinically meaningful TDI focal scores were observed in both 
treatment groups but the treatment differences were not statistically significant.  
Daily activity question Percentage of Days with a Score of 2 
ITT Population: Over Weeks 1-24, the percentage of days with a score of 2 remained similar to baseline in 
both the FF/UMEC/VI (5.1%) and BUD/FOR (5.0%) groups; the treatment difference was not statistically 
significant.  
EXT Population: Over Weeks 1-52, the percentage of days reporting a score of 2 remained similar to 
baseline in both the FF/UMEC/VI (4.6%) and BUD/FOR (4.9%) groups; the treatment difference was not 
statistically significant. 
Serial FEV1 
Mean baseline FEV1 in the serial spirometry (SS) Population was similar between the treatment groups: 
1.381 L in FF/UMEC/VI group (n = 203) and 1.362 L in the BUD/FOR group (n = 203). On Day 1, FF/UMEC/VI 
produced larger mean increases from baseline in FEV1 (rang from 90 to 222 mL) compared with BUD/FOR 
(rang from 32 to 155 mL). Treatment differences in change from baseline FEV1 between FF/UMEC/VI and 
BUD/FOR were statistically significant (p<0.05) at most time points except at 15 and 30 minutes, and at 15 
hours. 
At Week 24 mean increases from baseline with FF/UMEC/VI ranged from 160 to 339 mL changes with 
BUD/FOR ranged from -32 to 140 mL. Treatment differences in change from baseline FEV1 between 
FF/UMEC/VI and BUD/FOR ranged from 156 to 231 mL and were statistically significant at every time point 
(p<0.001).

Study 200109 was a comparison of the addition of umeclidinium bromide (UMEC) to fluticasone furoate 
(FF)/vilanterol (VI), with placebo plus FF/VI in subjects with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease 
(COPD). 
This was a multicentre study with 55 investigators conducted at 13 centres in the United States of America 
(USA), 12 centres in Canada, 12 centres in Chile, 8 centres in Argentina and 10 centres in Romania it was 
carried out from October 2013 to April 2014.  
Objectives 
The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the addition of UMEC 125 mcg to FF/VI 
100/25 mcg once-daily and the addition of UMEC 62.5 mcg to FF/VI 100/25 mcg once-daily, compared with 
placebo plus FF/VI 100/25 mcg once-daily over 12 weeks in subjects with COPD. 
The secondary objective was to evaluate the addition of UMEC 125 mcg to FF/VI 100/25 mcg once-daily and 
the addition of UMEC 62.5 mcg to FF/VI 100/25 mcg once-daily, compared with placebo plus FF/VI 100/25 
mcg once-daily on COPD-related health status assessments over 12 weeks in subjects with COPD. 
Methods 
Study design and treatments 
The study was a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, multi-centre evaluation of the efficacy and safety 
of two doses of UMEC (62.5 mcg and 125 mcg once daily) added to FF/VI once-daily as a triple therapy 
compared to placebo plus FF/VI. Subjects who met the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria at 
Visit 1 (Screening) entered a 4-week open Run-In period with FF/VI 100/25 mcg administered once daily via 
the ELLIPTA dry powder inhaler. Subjects were provided with salbutamol to be used as needed for 
symptomatic relief during both the Run-In and treatment periods.  
At the end of the Run-In period subjects who met the randomisation criteria were assigned to receive one of 
the following three treatments (1:1:1) while continuing treatment with open-label FF/VI 100/25 mcg once 
daily in the AM during a 12-week treatment period: 
•  UMEC (62.5 mcg) administered once daily via a DPI 
•  UMEC (125 mcg) administered once daily via a DPI 
•  Matching placebo administered once daily via a DPI 
Inclusion Criteria 
Male and female subjects (females of non-reproductive potential or using study specified contraceptive 
methods), treated as outpatients, 40 years of age and older with a history of COPD, as defined by the 
American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society [Celli, 2004], with a smoking history (current or 
former) of at least 10 pack-years were eligible. Subjects also had a pre and post-albuterol/salbutamol 
FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio of <0.70 and a pre- and post-albuterol/salbutamol FEV1 of no more 
than 70% of predicted normal values calculated using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(NHANES) III reference equations and a dyspnoea score of ≥2 on the modified Medical Research Council 
(mMRC) Dyspnoea Scale at Visit 1 (Screening). Subjects were required to have met the following corrected 
QT interval (QTc) Criteria: corrected QT interval using Fridericia’s formula (QTc(F) <450 msec or QTc(F) 
<480 msec for patients with QRS duration ≥ 120 msec.

Exclusion Criteria 
Subjects could not have a current diagnosis of asthma, have been hospitalised for COPD or pneumonia 
within 12 weeks prior to Visit 1, have had lung volume reduction surgery within the 12 months prior to Visit 
1, have had a lower respiratory tract infection requiring antibiotic use within 6 weeks of Visit 1, use 
long-term oxygen therapy (prescribed for greater than 12 h a day), or have participated in the acute phase 
of a pulmonary rehabilitation program within 4 weeks prior to Visit 1. 
Subjects could not have evidence of concurrent respiratory disease, or other clinically significant medical 
conditions including an abnormal and clinically significant ECG finding from the 12-lead ECG conducted at 
Visit 1, have severe milk protein allergy or drug allergies.  
Prior and Concomitant Medications and Non-Drug Therapies 
All COPD medications used within 30 days prior to Visit 0 (Pre-screening visit) and onwards were to be 
recorded in the eCRF including any changes. Beginning at Visit 1 and throughout the rest of the study, all 
non-COPD medications were to be recorded in the eCRF including any changes. Study provided 
albuterol/salbutamol, open-label FF/VI and double-blind study drug were not to be recorded in the eCRF. 
Medications initiated after completion of Visit 7 or the Early Withdrawal Visit were not to be recorded in the 
eCRF, with the exception of those used to treat a COPD exacerbation or SAE that occurred between Visit 7 
(or the Early Withdrawal Visit) and the follow-up contact. 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was trough FEV1 on Day 85 defined as the mean of the FEV1 values obtained 
23 and 24 h after dosing. Baseline trough FEV1 was the mean of the 2 assessments made at -30 and -5 
minutes pre-dose on Treatment Day 1. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint 
The secondary efficacy endpoint was weighted mean (WM) 0-6 h FEV1 obtained post-dose on Day 84. The 
WM was calculated from the pre-dose FEV1 and post-dose FEV1 measurements at 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 
1 h, 3 h and 6 h. 
Other Efficacy Endpoints 
• 
• 
• 
Proportion of subjects achieving an increase of at least 100 mL above baseline in trough FEV1 
Trough FEV1 and WM FEV1 over 0-6 h post-dose at other time points 
Proportion of subjects achieving an increase in FEV1 of ≥ 12% and ≥ 200 mL above baseline at any 
time during 0-6 h post-dose on Day 1 
•  Serial FEV1 over 0 to 6 h (at each time point)  
• 
• 
Peak FEV1 
Time to onset (defined as an increase of 100 mL above baseline in FEV1) during 0-6h post-dose on 
Treatment Day 1 (Visit 2) (This is an additional endpoint not specified in the protocol, which has 
been included to further characterise the lung function response to treatment.) 
•  Serial and trough forced vital capacity (FVC) 
Health-Related Quality of Life/Health Outcomes 
The health-related quality of life and health outcome endpoints were: COPD Assessment Test (CAT), St. 
George’s Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD Patients (SGRQ-C).

Statistical methods  
Summary statistics for raw and change from baseline in trough FEV1 at each clinic visit and for each 
treatment are based on the ITT population. The primary endpoint of trough FEV1 on Day 85 was analysed 
using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis, including covariates of baseline FEV1, smoking 
status, Day, treatment, Day by baseline interaction and Day by treatment interaction, where Day is nominal. 
The model used all available trough FEV1 values recorded on Days 2, 28, 56, 84 and 85. Missing data are not 
directly imputed in the analysis. The 0-6 h weighted mean FEV1 on Day 84 will be analysed for the ITT 
Population using MMRM analysis as for the primary variable. 
Sample Size Assumptions 
Sample size calculations were based on the primary endpoint of trough FEV1 at Day 85 and assume 90% 
power, a two-sided 5% significance level, an estimate of residual standard deviation of 220 mL based on 
analyses of previous studies in COPD and a treatment difference of 80 mL. Under these assumptions, 160 
evaluable subjects on each treatment (480 in total) were required. The variability for the secondary endpoint 
of 0-6h WM FEV1 at Day 84 was expected to be the same as that for trough FEV1. The treatment difference 
for this endpoint was expected to be greater than that for trough, and therefore the sample size required for 
the primary trough endpoint provided sufficient power for comparisons on the secondary WM endpoint. It 
was estimated that approximately 20% of subjects would withdraw during the treatment period, data for 
subjects who withdrew prematurely were not explicitly imputed. Hence, to account for a 20% withdrawal 
rate, approximately 600 subjects (200 subjects per treatment) were randomised. To account for multiplicity 
across treatment comparisons and endpoints, a step-down closed testing procedure was applied whereby 
inference for a test in the predefined hierarchy was dependent upon statistical significance having been 
achieved for previous tests in the hierarchy.

 PATIENT DEMOGRAPHY AND DISPOSITION 
A total of 727 subjects were enrolled in the study of whom 705 attended the screening visit; 70 were screen 
failures. The most common reasons for screen failure were failure to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria (63 
subjects) and withdrawal of consent (7 subjects). 
A total of 619 subjects were randomised across 13 centres in the United States (26% of subjects), 12 
centres in Chile (21% of subjects), 12 centres in Canada (20% of subjects), 10 centres in Romania (17% of 
subjects) and 8 centres in Argentina (16% of subjects). All randomised subjects were included in the ITT 
population. Overall, 575 subjects (93%) in the ITT Population completed the study; 93% of the placebo 
group, 95% of the UMEC 62.5 group and 91% in the UMEC 125 group.

Outcomes /results 
The outcome for the primary efficacy endpoint trough FEV1 at Day 85 is shown in Table 21 and was 
statistically significantly superior to placebo for both doses of UMEC. Trough FEV1 at Day 2, Day 28, Day 56 
and Day 84 were  “Other” efficacy endpoints and were significantly superior to placebo p < 0.001 at all time 
points. 
Statistically significant improvements in LS mean change from baseline in the secondary endpoint 0-6 h WM 
FEV1 were demonstrated for both the UMEC 62.5 + FF/VI and the UMEC 125 + FF/VI treatment groups 
compared with the placebo + FF/VI treatment group at Day 84. Significant improvements in the LS mean 
change from baseline in 0-6 h WM FEV1 were also demonstrated for both the UMEC 62.5 + FF/VI and the 
UMEC 125 + FF/VI treatment groups compared with the placebo + FF/VI group for the “Other” efficacy 
endpoints at Days 1 and 28. 
Greater proportions of subjects in the UMEC 62.5 + FF/VI and the UMEC 125 + FF/VI treatment groups 
achieved an FEV1 increase from baseline of at least 12% and 200 mL compared with the placebo + FF/VI 
group during 0-6 h post-dose on Day 1. The odds of achieving this increase versus not achieving it were 
statistically significantly greater for the UMEC groups compared with the placebo (p<0.001 for both groups). 
Subjects in the UMEC 62.5 + FF/VI and the UMEC 125 + FF/VI treatment groups had a statistically 
significantly higher odds of achieving an FEV1 increase from baseline of at least 100 mL versus not achieving 
that increase compared with the placebo + FF/VI treatment group at Days 2, 28, 56, 84 and Day 85. 
Median time to onset of additional bronchodilation was shorter in both UMEC + FF/VI (30 minutes for each) 
treatment groups compared with the placebo + FF/VI treatment group (180 minutes); the hazard ratios for 
both treatment comparisons (based on analysis of time to onset of additional bronchodilation) were 
statistically significant (p<0.001) 
At baseline, the mean daily use of rescue salbutamol ranged from 2.1 to 2.4 puffs/day across the treatment 
groups. Over Weeks 1-12, a statistically significant reduction from baseline in rescue salbutamol use was 
demonstrated in the UMEC 62.5+ FF/VI (-0.4 puffs/day) treatment group and in the UMEC 125+ FF/VI (-0.2 
puffs/day) treatment group compared with the placebo + FF/VI treatment group. 
Mean total SGRQ scores at baseline were similar across the treatment groups (range: 44.48 to 45.48). Least 
squares mean improvements from baseline were observed in all treatment groups at Day 28 and Day 84, 
with a greater improvement from placebo seen only in the UMEC 62.5 + FF/VI treatment group. None of the 
improvements reached the minimal clinically important difference (MICD) of 4 units. The differences 
between the two UMEC + FF/VI treatment groups versus the placebo + FF/VI treatment group were not 
statistically significant and did not reach the MCID of -4 units.

2.Study 200110 
Study 200110 was a comparison of the addition of umeclidinium bromide (UMEC) to fluticasone furoate 
(FF)/vilanterol (VI), with placebo plus FF/VI in subjects with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease 
(COPD). 
This was a multi-centre study with 59 investigators in 4 countries. Study centre(s): 30 centres in Germany, 
15 centres in the United States of America, 8 centres in the Republic of Korea and 6 centres in the Czech 
Republic it was carried out from October 2013 to April 2014.Study design/methods 
A total of 730 subjects were enrolled in the study of whom 715 attended the screening visit; 85 were screen 
failures. The most common reasons for screen failure were failure to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria (10% 
of subjects) and withdrawal of consent and adverse events (<1% for each).

A total of 620 subjects were randomised and 619 were included in the ITT population across 30 centres in 
Germany (46% of subjects), 15 centres in the United States (29%), 8 centres in the Republic of Korea 
(11%) and 6 centres in the Czech Republic (14%). Overall, 575 subjects (93%) in the ITT Population 
completed the study. At least 93% of subjects attended each clinic visit including Follow-Up. Attendance was 
slightly higher at Days 56, 84 and 85 in the UMEC+FF/VI groups than the placebo +FF/VI group which can 
be attributed to the higher withdrawal rate from the placebo +FF/VI group this was mainly due to 
withdrawals due to lack of efficacy in the placebo group (5%) compared to the UMEC groups 2% and 1%. 
Also, 5% of subjects withdrew due to exacerbations in the placebo group compared to 1% in both UMEC 
groups.

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The Applicant presents three completed clinical safety and efficacy trials in support of the marketing 
authorisation. 
CTT116853 was a 24-week evaluation, with an extension up to 52-weeks for a subset of subjects, of the 
efficacy and safety of FF/UMEC/VI compared with BUD/FOR. It was conducted to a randomised, 
double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, multi-centre design comparing the candidate treatment, 
once-daily FF/UMEC/VI (100/62.5/25 – Trelegy Ellipta and Elebrato Ellipta) against twice-daily BUD/FOR 
(400/12 Symbicort Turbuhaler) in subjects with advanced COPD at risk of exacerbation.  
The co-primary endpoints were change from baseline in trough FEV1 and change from baseline in SGRQ 
Total Score at Week 24. Secondary efficacy endpoints were the annual rate of on-treatment moderate or 
severe COPD exacerbations, assessment of respiratory symptoms using the Exacerbations of COPD Tool 
(EXACT) – Respiratory Symptoms (EXACT-RS) - Score and subscale (breathlessness, cough/sputum 
production, and chest symptoms) scores, Transitional Dyspnea Index (TDI) focal score at Week 24 and Daily 
Activity Question. 
The CHMP SAWP initially agreed that the proposed comparator study (CTT116853) of FF/UMEC/VI versus 
BUD/FOR, together with the supporting UMEC + FF/VI studies (200109 and 200110) could form the basis of 
an initial MAA. However, the CHMP recommended that use of FF/VI as an active comparator would be more 
appropriate taking into account current knowledge. However, the CHMP acknowledged that an authorisation 
may be possible with superiority demonstrated only against one authorised fixed dose combination 
(ICS/LABA or LAMA/LABA), provided that demonstrated superiority in efficacy is compelling and that data 
from other supportive studies allow demonstration of efficacy against LAMA/LABA and/or ICS/LABA. 
Studies 200109 and 200110 were of similar design, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, 12-week 
evaluations of the efficacy and safety of two strengths of UMEC (62.5 and 125 mcg) in addition to FF/VI 
compared to placebo added to the same combination of FF/VI in patients with moderate to very severe 
COPD. The primary endpoint of the supporting studies was trough FEV1 on Day 85; the secondary endpoint 
was weighted mean FEV1 over 0-6 hour post-dose on Day 84. The FF/UMEC/VI dose (100/62.5/25) was 
selected based on the doses that have been licenced for COPD for the FF/VI (100/25) and UMEC/VI 
(62.5/25) dual combinations through extensive studies in the mono and dual therapy programmes. Because 
it is no longer intended to commercialise a dose of UMEC 125 µg the two studies could be interpreted as a 
comparison of the UMEC 62.5 + FF/VI 100/25 µg (similar to Elebrato but not a fixed combination) compared 
with FF/VI alone at the same doses and/or a comparison of UMEC 62.5 µg with placebo. In both studies the 
triple combination shows superiority for most endpoints which is what would be expected. 
During the assessment, the applicant informed about an issue involving the statistical analysis of the clinical 
reversibility results for the supportive clinical trial 200109, the results of which have been relied upon in part 
to support the efficacy of the product. The root-cause of the issue relates to a programming error for the 
conversion of numerical data from Base 10 to binary, which was not initially picked up by the internal QC 
controls of the applicant.  
The results of Study CTT116853 show that the triple fixed dose combination of FF/UMEC/VI has statistically 
significant and clinically relevant improvements in trough FEV1 on week 24 over the approved comparator 
BUD/FOR. The difference between the two treatments of 171 ml is very marked. Therefore, we can raise the 
question of whether the BUD/FOR treatment arm was sufficient to match the needs of the population 
recruited i.e. whether participants in that arm were under treated. However, considering the results from 
both supporting studies 200109 and 200110 showing also a statistically significant and clinically relevant 
improvement in trough FEV1 on Day 85 over FF/VI (treatment differences of 122 mL and 124 mL), the 
evidence of a positive effect of the triple combination in lung function in COPD patients already receiving 
ICS/LABA combination is not questioned. No further analyses are necessary."While this error does not seem 
Assessment report  
EMA/25056/2018 
Page 87/106 
  
  
to have had any significant effect on the outcome of the trials nor have led to any patient safety issues, the 
applicant has been advised to review their procedures to minimise the possibility of recurrence, which they 
have committed to doing. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The results of Study CTT116853 show that the triple fixed dose combination of FF/UMEC/VI has statistically 
significant and clinically relevant benefits over the approved comparator BUD/FOR. The study is in line with 
advice given by EMA/CHMP on the clinical development programme. Considering the PK data and the 
additional data from studies 200109 and 200110 is therefore considered acceptable.  No further analyses 
are necessary. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
Study  CTT116853  convincingly  demonstrates  the  advantage  of  a  triple  fixed  dose  combination  of 
LABA/LAMA/ICS  over  an  approved  double  (LABA/ICS)  combination  and  is  in  line  with  scientific  advice 
provided  by  CHMP.  The  design  of  study  CTT116853  included,  however,  direct  comparisons  with  an 
authorised ICS/LABA combination only, which in itself would not have been sufficient to grant the indication 
sought by the applicant.  
That being said, the company provided additional scientific data from two small supportive studies (200109 
and 200110) showing that the triple combination showed superiority over a dual combination of FF/VI -.  
While these additional studies further clarify the clinical efficacy of the combination product, there remains 
a lack of evidence to claim a step-up indication from LAMA+LABA due to the absence of LAMA+LABA as a 
comparator  in  the    pivotal  Phase  III  study.  The  applicant  was  therefore  advised  that  the  therapeutic 
indication should reflect the clinical trial and be more accurately tailored to the COPD population studied in 
the clinical programme.  
While the clinical efficacy results did show a beneficial effect on the rate of exacerbations, the clinical studies 
were not powered to allow this aspect to be reflected in the indication. It was agreed, however, that this 
information would be of benefit to clinicians, and so should be included in the product information. These 
data have therefore been included in section 5.1 as supportive information. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The clinical development programme to support the MAA for FF/UMEC/VI in patients with COPD comprises 
five completed studies: a single (principal) 24 week Phase III study (CTT116853) with a subset extension to 
52 weeks, two 12 week supporting Phase III studies (200109 and 200110), and two Phase I clinical 
pharmacology studies (CTT116415 and 200587).  
Data from supportive studies 200109 and 200110 were integrated since they were replicate studies.  The 
results for comparator treatment arms UMEC (62.5 mcg) + FF/VI (100/25 mcg) and [placebo] FF/VI 
(100/25 mcg) [only] are presented as they represent the proposed dose for each of the components in the 
FF/UMEC/VI triple combination (100/62.5/25 mcg). 
Safety data from the principal study CTT116853 and the supporting studies 200109and 200110 were not 
integrated as it was considered inappropriate to calculate annualised event rates from studies of short 
duration, and because of the different sample sizes between the studies (i.e., considerably larger volume of 
information obtained from CTT116853 relative to 200109/200110). 
The number of patient by study and treatment arm is shown in Table 23. A total of 911 subjects were 
randomised to the FF/UMEC/VI group in the CTT116853 ITT population and 412 subjects were randomised 
Assessment report  
EMA/25056/2018

and treated with UMEC 62.5 + FF/VI in the 200109 and 200110 ITT populations (206 subjects in each 
study).  A total of 430 subjects (24%) were included in the CTT116853 extension (52 week) 210 (23%) in 
the FF/UMEC/VI group and 220 (24%) in the BUD/FOR group.

In 200109/200110, the overall incidence of AEs was 34% in the UMEC + FF/VI group and 37% in the FF/VI 
group. The incidence of SAEs by category (fatal, non-fatal, fatal drug-related, and non-fatal drug-related) 
was similar between the treatment groups. The incidence of AEs considered related to study drug by the 
investigator or that led to permanent discontinuation of study treatment or withdrawal from the study was 
similar between the treatment groups (5% and 2%, respectively, in the UMEC + FF/VI group and 5% and 
3%, respectively, in the FF/VI group).

Common Adverse Events 
Frequently-Reported On-Treatment Adverse Events 
CTT116853 
ITT Population:  The most frequently reported AEs were nasopharyngitis, which was reported for 7% of 
subjects in the FF/UMEC/VI group and 5% in the BUD/FOR group, and headache, which was reported for 44 
subjects (5%) in the FF/UMEC/VI group and 53 subjects (6%) in the BUD/FOR group.  The remaining most 
frequent AEs were reported for no more than 3% of subjects in either treatment group and with a generally 
similar incidence in both treatment groups.  Although the incidence of blood pressure increased was less 
than 1% in both treatment groups, there as a lower event rate per 1000 subject-years) in the FF/UMEC/VI 
group (9.8 [4 events]) compared with the BUD/FOR group (56.5 [22 events]). 
There was a higher incidence of pneumonia in the FF/UMEC/VI group (19 subjects [2%]) compared with the 
BUD/FOR group (7 subjects [<1%]).  There was a numerical imbalance for COPD, which was reported for 15 
subjects (2%) in the FF/UMEC/VI group compared with 23 subjects (3%) in the BUD/FOR group. 
There was an increased risk (i.e., 95% confidence interval [CI] of hazard ratio does not include 1) of 
pneumonia for the FF/UMEC/VI group and of rhinorrhoea for the BUD/FOR group (Figure 9).  The 95% CIs 
for all other frequent on-treatment AEs in the ITT Population included 1 i.e. was not statistically significant.

EXT Population:  The most frequently reported AE was nasopharyngitis, which was reported for 23 
subjects (11%) in the FF/UMEC/VI group and 22 (10%) in the BUD/FOR group.  The second most frequent 
AE was headache, which was reported for 17 subjects (8%) in the FF/UMEC/VI group and 22 (10%) in the 
BUD/FOR group.  The next most frequent AE was COPD, which was reported less in the FF/UMEC/VI group 
(5 subjects [2%]) compared with the BUD/FOR group (22 subjects [10%]).  The remaining most frequent 
AEs were reported for no more than 5% of subjects in either treatment group and with a generally similar 
incidence in both treatment groups. Pneumonia was reported for 4 subjects (2%) in the FF/UMEC/VI group

have been immediately life-threatening or resulted in death or hospitalisation but may have jeopardised the 
subject or may have required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes defined 
as SAEs; or any event of possible drug-induced liver injury with hyperbilirubinaemia, defined as alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) ≥3x upper limit of normal (ULN) and bilirubin ≥2xULN (>35% direct) (or ALT 
≥3xULN and international normalised ratio (INR) >1.5, if INR measured) termed ‘Hy’s Law’ events (INR 
measurement was not required and the threshold value stated did not apply to patients receiving 
anticoagulants). 
Deaths 
In CTT116853, all SAE reports (fatal and non-fatal) were adjudicated by the clinical events committee, in 
studies 200109 and 200110, SAEs were not adjudicated. 
A total of 18 on-treatment deaths occurred during the clinical development is programme; 12 deaths in 
CTT116853 and 6 deaths in 200109/200110.  
In StudyCTT116853 ITT population up to Week 24 fatal SAEs were reported for 4 subjects (0.4%) in the 
FF/UMEC/VI group and 6 subjects (0.7%) in the BUD/FOR group, none of which were considered related to 
study treatment. 
In Study CTT116853 EXT population up to Week 52 fatal SAEs were reported for 2 subjects (1.0%) in the 
FF/UMEC/VI group and 1 subject (0.5%) in the BUD/FOR group, none of which were considered related to 
study treatment. One subject with a fatal SAE was included in both the ITT and EXT counts. 
In studies 200109 and 200110 fatal SAEs were reported for 1 subject (<1%) in the UMEC + FF/VI group and 
5 subjects (1%) in the FF/VI group, none of which were considered related to study drug by the investigator.  
Serious adverse events [including fatal SAE] 
CTT116853 
ITT Population: On-treatment SAEs (fatal and non-fatal) were reported for 49 subjects (5.4%) in the 
FF/UMEC/VI group and by 51 subjects (5.7%) in the BUD/FOR group.  The most common on-treatment SAEs 
were COPD and pneumonia.  There was a numerical imbalance for the incidence of COPD in the FF/UMEC/VI 
group (12 subjects [1.3%]) compared with the BUD/FOR group (21 subjects [2.3%]).  There was a higher 
incidence of pneumonia in the FF/UMEC/VI group (9 subjects [1.0%]) compared with the BUD/FOR group (3 
subjects [0.3%]).  There was also a numerical imbalance for the incidence of any events in the cardiac 
disorders system organ class in the FF/UMEC/VI group (3 subjects [0.3%]) compared with the BUD/FOR 
group (9 subjects [1.0%]). 
Post-treatment SAEs were reported for 3 subjects (0.3%) in the FF/UMEC/VI group and by 8 subjects 
(0.9%) in the BUD/FOR group. 
EXT Population: On-treatment SAEs were reported for 21 subjects (10.0%) in the FF/UMEC/VI group and 
by 28 subjects (12.7%) in the BUD/FOR group. The most common on-treatment SAEs were COPD and 
pneumonia. The incidence of COPD was lower in the FF/UMEC/VI group (5 subjects [2.4%]) compared with 
the BUD/FOR group (20 subjects [9.1%]).  There were 4 subjects (1.9%) in the FF/UMEC/VI group and 4 
subjects (1.8%) in the BUD/FOR group who experienced pneumonia. 
Drug-related SAEs were reported for two subjects (0.2%) in the FF/UMEC/VI group and one subject 
(0.1%) in the BUD/FOR group. Cardiac failure, lung infection, and pneumonia were the only reported 
on-treatment drug-related non-fatal SAEs reported in the FF/UMEC/VI group and atrial flutter was the only

In 200109/200110, the incidence of non-fatal SAEs was similar between the treatment groups in the ITT 
Subpopulation: UMEC + FF/VI (9 subjects [2%]) and FF/VI (12 subjects [3%]).  The most common non-fatal 
SAEs were COPD, which was reported for 3 subjects (<1%) in the UMEC + FF/VI group and 4 subjects 
(<1%) in the FF/VI group, and pneumonia (2 subjects [<1%] in each group).  Other non-fatal SAEs were 
reported with an incidence of <1% in either group.

Laboratory findings 
In CTT116853, routine non-fasting clinical laboratory tests (haematology and clinical chemistry) were 
performed at Screening, Week 12, Week 24 and Week 52 for subjects participating in the study extension or 
at the Study Treatment Discontinuation Visit, if applicable. Glucose and potassium were evaluated as part of 
the routine laboratory assessments during the study. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis effects, 
including adrenal suppression and decreased serum cortisol, are recognised class effects of ICS.  While no 
specific laboratory evaluation of cortisol was conducted during the programme, AESIs related to adrenal 
suppression were evaluated. A minor error in the derivation of ‘worst case post-baseline’ flags relative to the 
normal range was identified for subjects with changes in the laboratory reference values occurring during 
the clinical trial, but these errors were not considered to have significantly affect the safety results of the 
trials. 
In 200109 and 200110, clinical chemistry and haematology assessments were only conducted at Screening 
for the purpose of assisting investigators with determination of subject eligibility.  At the discretion of the 
investigator, AEs could have been followed up with clinical chemistry or haematology assessments  
CTT116853 
No clinically relevant trends or unexpected abnormalities in clinical chemistry (including glucose and 
potassium) or haematology parameters were observed. One subject in the BUD/FOR group had elevated 
liver function tests (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) that met the 
protocol defined stopping criteria while on treatment; the elevations subsequently resolved. A second 
subject (FF/UMEC/VI group) who was hepatitis C positive at screening had elevations in ALT and AST which 
were reported during a concurrent AE of worsening chronic virus hepatitis C.  
ECG data 
In study CTT116853, a single 12-lead ECG was recorded after measurement of vital signs and spirometry at 
Screening and approximately 15-45 minutes after dosing at Week 4 and Week 24 (and Week 52 for subjects 
participating in the study extension) or Study Treatment Discontinuation Visit as applicable. At selected 
study sites, a subset of subjects provided 24-hour Holter monitoring data at Screening and 24 hours prior to 
the Week 24 Visit. No emerging safety signals from ECGs, or Holter monitoring data at any time points were 
observed in study CTT116853. 
In studies 200109 and 200110, a 12-lead ECG was performed at Screening (Visit 1) only. Holter monitoring 
was not conducted during the 200109 and 200110 studies."

Adverse Events by Gender 
ITT Population  Compared with the Overall ITT Population, a higher incidence of on-treatment AEs was 
reported for females in both treatment groups.  There were no remarkable differences based on gender for 
the incidence of on-treatment drug-related AEs, SAEs, adjudicated non-fatal serious adverse reports, or AEs 
leading to discontinuation of study treatment or withdrawal from the study for either treatment group 
compared with the Overall ITT Population. 
EXT Population Compared with the Overall EXT Population, a higher incidence of on-treatment AEs was 
reported for females in the FF/UMEC/VI group and lower incidences of on-treatment drug-related AEs, SAEs, 
and adjudicated non-fatal serious adverse reports were reported for females in the BUD/FOR treatment 
group. There were no remarkable differences based on gender for the incidence of on-treatment AEs leading 
to discontinuation of study treatment or withdrawal from the study for either treatment group compared 
with the Overall EXT Population.

Investigator’s judgement of causality. 
Adverse Events by Age 
ITT Population:  Compared with the Overall ITT Population, higher incidences of on-treatment AEs, SAEs, 
adjudicated non-fatal serious adverse reports, and AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment or 
withdrawal from the study were reported for subjects 75 to 84 years of age in the FF/UMEC/VI group but not 
in the BUD/FOR group.  However, the conditions customarily more common in elderly (e.g., nervous system 
disorders, psychiatric disorders, cardiac disorders, vascular disorders, postural hypotension/falls/black 
outs/syncope/dizziness/ataxia/fractures) were seen with similar incidence in the FF/UMEC/VI and BUD/FOR 
groups. There were no remarkable differences based on age for the incidence of on-treatment drug-related 
AEs for either treatment group compared with the Overall ITT Population (Table 3.64).  The number of 
subjects at least 85 years of age was small (n=9 total), and therefore, it is difficult to make conclusions on 
these data. 
EXT Population:  Compared with the Overall EXT Population, lower incidences of on-treatment SAEs and 
adjudicated non-fatal serious adverse reports were reported for subjects 65 to 74 years of age in the 
FF/UMEC/VI group.  There were no remarkable differences based on age for the incidence of on-treatment 
AEs, drug-related AEs, or AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment or withdrawal from the study for 
either treatment group compared with the Overall EXT Population.  The number of subjects 75 to 84 years 
Assessment report  
EMA/25056/2018

of age was small (n=39 total) and therefore it is difficult to make conclusions on these data; there were no 
subjects at least 85 years of age.  
Immunological events 
The only relevant events are classified as hypersensitivity reactions and the clinical details available are 
insufficient to make any meaningful evaluation.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
As agreed with CHMP as part of Scientific Advice, no drug-drug interaction studies were conducted for 
FF/UMEC/VI, based on information from the previous development programmes for FF/VI, UMEC/VI, and 
UMEC monotherapy. The known drug interactions of FF/VI, UMEC/VI, and UMEC monotherapy are provided 
in the prescribing information for each product. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
CTT116853 
ITT Population  AEs that led to permanent discontinuation of study treatment or withdrawal from the study 
was twenty-eight subjects (3%) in the FF/UMEC/VI group and 25 (3%) in the BUD/FOR group.  
EXT Population AEs leding to permanent discontinuation of study treatment or withdrawal from the study 
were reported for ten subjects (5%) in the FF/UMEC/VI group and nine (4%) in the BUD/FOR group.

200109/200110 
AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug or withdrawal from study were reported for UMEC + 
FF/VI (10 subjects [2%]) and FF/VI (14 subjects [3%]).  The most frequently reported AEs leading to 
withdrawal (incidence all <1%) were COPD (2 subjects in UMEC + FF/VI group and 4 subjects in FF/VI 
group), MI (1 subject in UMEC + FF/VI group and 4 subjects in FF/VI group), and pneumonia (2 subjects in 
UMEC + FF/VI group and 3 subjects in FF/VI group) 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety population supporting the FF/UMEC/VI clinical development comprised a total of 911 subjects 
treated with the closed triple combination FF/UMEC/VI 100/62.5/25 for up to 24 weeks in Study CTT116853 
and 412 subjects treated with the open triple combination UMEC 62.5 + FF/VI 100/25 for up to 12 weeks in 
Studies 200109 and 200110.  A subset of subjects in CTT116853 were treated with FF/UMEC/VI (N=210) for 
up to 52 weeks and provided long-term safety data. 
In Study CTT116853 the mean age was 64 years, 26% were females, 44% were current smokers with about 
a 39 pack-year history, about two-thirds of subjects had at least one cardiovascular risk factor at baseline. 
Approximately two-thirds had at least one moderate/severe exacerbation in the previous year, and about 
10% of subjects had a history of pneumonia prior to study entry which is representative of the target COPD 
population.  
In CTT116853, the most frequently reported AEs were nasopharyngitis and headache in both treatment 
groups, and a similar profile was observed in the 200109/200110 studies. The most frequently reported AEs 
reported during the FF/UMEC/VI programme were consistent with those observed in the previous 
development programmes for FF/VI, UMEC/VI, and UMEC monotherapy. 
In CTT116853, the most common on-treatment SAEs (fatal and non-fatal) were COPD exacerbations and 
pneumonia in both treatment groups.  There was a numerical imbalance for the incidence of COPD in the 
BUD/FOR group compared with the FF/UMEC/VI group. COPD has been shown to be a risk factor for the 
development of pneumonia.  Pneumonia is also a recognised risk associated with the use of ICS treatments 
in COPD. Review of SAE and AE data in the ITT Population up to 24 weeks (n=1810) in CTT116853 
demonstrated a higher incidence of pneumonia AESI compared to BUD/FOR (2.2% vs 0.8%) which was not 
observed in the EXT Population up to 52 weeks (n=430), where a similar incidence of pneumonia AESI was 
observed in both treatment groups (1.9% vs 1.8%).  In CTT116853, chest imaging confirmed pneumonias 
and SAE reports adjudicated as pneumonia (based on independent blinded adjudication) were in line with 
investigator-reported data.  Based on data collected using the pneumonia eCRF, in the ITT Population up to 
24 weeks, in the FF/UMEC/VI group, there were 10 subjects (1%) with pneumonia supported by X-ray/CT 
scan and 11 hospitalisations, and in the BUD/FOR group, there were 3 subjects (<1%) with pneumonia 
supported by X-ray/CT scan and 3 hospitalisations.  In the EXT Population up to 52 weeks, in both the

FF/UMEC/VI and BUD/FOR groups, there were 4 subjects (2%) with pneumonia and 4 hospitalisations.  
There was one fatal pneumonia in CTT116853; this subject was in the FF/UMEC/VI group. 
The incidence of pneumonia with FF/UMEC/VI in CTT116853 was in line with the incidence of pneumonia 
reported in 24-week studies with FF/VI (<1 to 2% with FF/VI 100/25) and less than that observed in 
52-week exacerbation studies with FF/VI (6% with FF/VI 100/25).  
Cardiovascular safety was monitored in CTT116853 via AE reporting with categorisation and analysis of 
adverse events of special interest including cardiac arrhythmia, cardiac failure, ischaemic heart disease, 
hypertension, and central nervous system haemorrhages and cerebrovascular conditions. There was a high 
prevalence of concurrent CV disease approximately two-thirds of subjects reported CV risk factors at 
baseline.  Events in the hypertension subgroup were reported with a numerically higher incidence in 
BUD/FOR compared with FF/UMEC/VI in the ITT Population up to 24 weeks and with a similar incidence in 
the EXT Population up to 52 weeks.  Small numerical differences in the incidence of MACE events were 
observed between treatments in the study with higher incidence in the BUD/FOR group in the ITT Population 
up to 24 weeks and higher incidence in FF/UMEC/VI group in the EXT Population up to 52 weeks. There were 
no emerging safety signals from vital signs, ECGs, or Holter data in the study.  In addition, the independently 
adjudicated data were in line with the investigator-reported data. 
A change in the classification of some adverse events which occurred during the clinical trials was reported 
by the applicant at the late stage of assessment. This related to a change in the reference intervals for some 
biochemical and laboratory normal values, which subsequently resulted in some patients initially classified 
as “High” later being reclassified as “Normal” and vice versa.  This raised an uncertainty around the 
incidence of such adverse event reports from the affected clinical trials, but the ultimate clinical significance 
of this is minimal. Additional analyses were requested by CHMP and clarification was provided by the 
applicant. Both were considered acceptable. The applicant is however reminded that accurate document 
version control is an imperative in ensuring the integrity of data collected in clinical trials. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of FF/UMEC/VI in the supporting clinical studies was in line with the pharmacologic class of 
each component and with the dual combinations FF/VI and UMEC/VI, and no new safety signals emerged in 
the populations studied.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
COPD is strongly linked to tobacco smoking, particularly cigarette smoking and is a male predominant 
condition, in COPD clinical trials in developed countries generally about two thirds of included patients are 
male and for both males and females the average age tends to be in the early sixties. In poor countries the 
male predominance is not as marked as women may develop COPD as a result of cooking over open fires. 
The prevalence is quite variable on a local basis with higher prevalence linked to lower affluence and social 
status. Screening would be possible by mass measurement of lung function which is cheap, easy, and 
non-invasive, but is not done in practice. There have been no substantial trials of the value of screening for 
COPD.  Tobacco smoking cessation or non/never smoking is an effective measure and societal efforts have 
been made in that direction rather than into screening programmes.  
COPD is characterised by cough, excess sputum production, airways narrowing leading to air trapping and 
hyperinflation of the chest, and loss of lung tissue (emphysema). In its more advanced stages it causes 
strain and eventually failure, of the cardiac right ventricle. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Management of the condition relies on smoking cessation, pharmacological intervention with 
bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory agents and, when necessary treatment of respiratory infections, 
physical rehabilitation is aimed primarily at muscle strengthening, and in advanced cases long term 
domiciliary oxygen administration is helpful and has a proven benefit on lung function. Some patients are 
suitable for lung volume reduction surgery to reduce non-gas exchanging thoracic space. Once developed 
the condition is only partly reversible so more treatment options are always welcome.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main phase 3 clinical studies supporting this application are one pivotal study (CTT116853) and two 
supportive studies (200109 and 200100) 
CTT116853 was a 24-week evaluation, with an extension up to 52-weeks for a subset of subjects, of the 
efficacy and safety of FF/UMEC/VI compared with BUD/FOR. It was conducted to a randomised, 
double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, multi-centre design comparing the candidate treatment, 
once-daily FF/UMEC/VI (100/62.5/25 – Trelegy Ellipta and Elebrato Ellipta) against twice-daily BUD/FOR 
(400/12 Symbicort Turbuhaler) in subjects with advanced COPD at risk of exacerbation.  
Trough FEV1 endpoints and were significantly superior to placebo p < 0.001 at alltime points. Clinically 
meaningful improvements from baseline in SGRQ Total Score were observed in both treatment groups, and 
FF/UMEC/VI demonstrated statistically significant improvement compared with BUD/FOR. 
In studies 200109 and 200110, the outcome for the primary efficacy endpoint change from baseline at 
trough FEV1 at Day 85 was statistically significantly superior to placebo for both doses of UMEC in patients  
who are not adequately treated. Statistically significant improvements in LS mean change from baseline in 
the secondary endpoint 0-6 h WM FEV1 were demonstrated for both the UMEC 62.5 + FF/VI and the UMEC 
125 + FF/VI treatment groups compared with the placebo + FF/VI treatment group at Day 84. Significant 
improvements in the LS mean change from baseline in 0-6 h WM FEV1 were also demonstrated for both the 
UMEC 62.5 + FF/VI and the UMEC 125 + FF/VI treatment groups compared with the placebo + FF/VI group 
.

Median time to onset of additional bronchodilation was shorter in both UMEC + FF/VI (30 minutes for each) 
treatment groups compared with the placebo + FF/VI treatment group (182 minutes); the hazard ratios for 
both treatment comparisons (based on analysis of time to onset of additional bronchodilation) were 
statistically significant (p<0.001). 
Studies 200109 and 200110 were of similar design, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, 12-week 
evaluations of the efficacy and safety of two strengths of UMEC (62.5 and 125 mcg) in addition to FF/VI 
compared to placebo added to the same combination of FF/VI in patients with moderate to very severe 
COPD. The primary endpoint of the supporting studies was trough FEV1 on Day 85; the secondary endpoint 
was weighted mean FEV1 over 0-6 hour post-dose on Day 84. The FF/UMEC/VI dose (100/62.5/25) was 
selected based on the doses that have been licenced for COPD for the FF/VI (100/25) and UMEC/VI 
(62.5/25) dual combinations through extensive studies in the mono and dual therapy programmes. The 
dose of UMEC 125 µg used in the clinical programme will not be marketed. Therefore , the two studies could 
be interpreted as a comparison of the UMEC 62.5 + FF/VI 100/25 µg (similar to Elebrato but not a fixed 
combination) compared with FF/VI alone at the same doses and/or a comparison of UMEC 62.5 µg with 
placebo. In both studies the triple combination shows superiority for most endpoints. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Elebrato contains three active components the bronchodilators vilanterol and umeclidinium which work by 
complementary mechanisms of action on airways autonomic nerve and muscle and the anti-inflammatory 
inhaled corticosteroid fluticasone furoate. All three are considered to have beneficial effects on the airways 
inflammation and narrowing which is a key pathology in COPD and as their actions are complementary then 
their combination is logical. There is evidence that the treatments used in combination of two or three 
reduce the frequency of moderate to severe COPD exacerbations thus avoiding patient distress and 
inconvenience and reducing the burden that COPD places on health care resources. For individual patients 
the progression of COPD often appears to be punctuated by exacerbations – the patient never fully regains 
his/her pre-exacerbation state. However, at a population level it is generally agreed that pharmacological 
intervention dose not modify the rate of deterioration of lung function. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The present application is in effect supported by a single clinical trial CTT116853 which compared the likely 
commercial product Elebrato to an authorised and widely used fixed dose combination of 
budesonide/formoterol over 24 weeks and in a smaller sub-population over 52 weeks. Not unexpectedly the 
triple combination showed advantages over the double with respect to change from baseline in lung 
function. An advantage was also shown in the patients symptom and quality of life score SGRQ again this is 
not surprising but the magnitude of the benefit is as it is unusual for inhaled (or other) therapies to reach or 
exceed the boundary of a reduction of four points which is taken to indicate clinical relevance of the benefit. 
Much the greater proportion of patients were studied for 24 weeks (n = 1810) and the smaller proportion for 
52 weeks (n = 430). Because COPD exacerbations are highly seasonal (more frequent in winter) anything 
less than a 12 month study is considered sub-optimal to measure exacerbation rates and this should be 
taken into consideration is evaluating the results of Study CTT116853. 
The two supportive studies 200109 and 200110 were only of twelve weeks duration which in the context of 
COPD is too short to give a reliable readout on anything other than spirometric variables (e.g. FEV1). In 
addition the treatment arms involving an ‘excess’ dose 125 µg of umeclidinium are not fully relevant due to 
the current lower strength applied for by the applicant.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The unfavourable effects are those associated with the class of active substances. For the LABA tremor, 
tachycardia, agitation, increase of blood pressure, hypokalaemia, hyperglycaemia, for the LAMA  dry mouth, 
blurring of vision, urinary retention, and for the ICS oropharyngeal candidiasis, vocal cord atrophy, 
hyperglycaemia, and most important pneumonia. They can be expected individually and in combination. It 
is important to note a signal in respect of pneumonia which occurred more frequently in the Elebrato 
treatment arm of the main study than in the comparator arm. The significance of this, if any, is uncertain as 
both arms contained an inhaled corticosteroid and it is unknown if there are differences within the class for 
ICS propensity to cause pneumonia.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
For this application the uncertainties about unfavourable effects are limited as the active components of this 
FDC are well known when administered on an individual basis or in some fixed combinations. It is highly 
unlikely that bringing them together in a single administration device will cause a change in their safety 
profiles.  
However, a change in the classification of some adverse events which occurred during the clinical trials was 
reported by the applicant at the late stage of assessment. This raised an uncertainty around the incidence of 
such adverse event reports from the affected clinical trials. The ultimate clinical significance was however 
considered minimal by CHMP. The applicant is however reminded that accurate document version control is 
an imperative in ensuring the integrity of data collected in clinical trials.

3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In the pivotal clinical study the applicant demonstrates advantages for fixed triple inhalational therapy over 
dual therapy. The variables concerned are; lung function, frequency of exacerbations, and patient quality of 
life all may be considered valuable to patients and health care providers and to be quite long lasting – 
months rather than weeks or days. Overall, the results represent current opinion/knowledge about the 
management of COPD. Compelling results were demonstrated compared to the comparator arm dual 
therapy. A caveat is that the results for the candidate treatment might be unduly flattering since the 
comparator arm (dual treatment) were undertreated for their degree of severity of COPD (mostly GOLD D) 
and might have benefited from additional treatment.  
In contrast to the benefits, the risks are infrequent or less frequent may be reversible with cessation or 
moderation of treatment and are well understood for each component on an individual basis.  
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Overall, the benefit-risk balance is considered to be positive in the population with moderate to  severe 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In addition, there is lack of evidence to claim a step-up 
indication from LAMA+LABA due to the absence of LAMA+LABA as a comparator in the Phase III study. 
Elebrato should be used as maintenance treatment in adult patients with moderate to severe COPD and who 
are not adequately treated by a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting β2-agonist. 
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Elebrato is positive for maintenance treatment in adult patients with moderate to severe 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who are not adequately treated by a combination of an 
inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting β2-agonist. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome

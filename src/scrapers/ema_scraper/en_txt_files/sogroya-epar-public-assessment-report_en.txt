2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Growth hormone (GH) deficiency is a rare disorder which affects both children and adults. It is characterised 
by inadequate systemic availability of GH due to inadequate secretion from the anterior pituitary gland or 
destruction of the gland.  
The diagnosis of adult growth hormone deficiency (AGHD) is defined according to the consensus guidelines 
for the diagnosis and treatment of AGHD.1 
Clinical studies using biosynthetic GH have confirmed that GH continues to play a vital role in optimising 
health even after attainment of final adult height and has demonstrated that adults with long-standing GH 
deficiency derive substantial benefit from GH replacement.

Endocrinology,  Lawson  Wilkins  Society,  European  Society  of  Endocrinology,  Japan  Endocrine  Society,  and  Endocrine 
Society of Australia. Eur J Endocrinol. 2007;157(6):695-700.

Somapacitan growth hormone product Sogroya is proposed for the replacement of endogenous GH in AGHD. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
An estimated 6,000 adults are diagnosed with AGHD every year in the United States. AGHD Has been 
estimated to affect 1 in 100,000 people annually, whereas its incidence is approximately 2 cases per 100,000 
population when childhood-onset GH deficiency (GHD) patients are considered. About 15%-20% of the cases 
represent the transition of childhood GHD into adulthood GHD. 
The age of presentation of acquired GHD in adults often coincides with the discovery of pituitary tumours, 
usually between the fourth and fifth decade of life. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The aetiology of GH deficiency (GHD) can be congenital (resulting from genetic mutations, or from structural 
defects in the hypothalamic-pituitary areas of the brain), acquired (e.g. as result of traumatic brain injury, 
infection, radiation therapy, or tumour growth within the hypothalamic-pituitary areas of the brain) or 
idiopathic. GHD May occur as an isolated hormonal deficiency or in combination with multiple pituitary 
hormone deficiencies (hypopituitarism). The most common causes of AGHD are damage to the pituitary gland 
or hypothalamus caused by a tumour (e.g., pituitary adenoma or craniopharyngioma), or due to surgery or 
radiotherapy.2  
As a general rule, the secretion of GH and gonadotropins is more likely to be affected by organic pituitary 
disease than that of corticotropin (ACTH) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). The likelihood of GH 
deficiency in such patients has been estimated to range from approximately 45 percent in patients with no 
other pituitary hormone deficits to virtually 100 percent in patients with multiple deficits. 
When GHD occurs in childhood due to any of the organic causes above, the deficiency will almost always 
persist into adulthood. In contrast, idiopathic GHD in childhood may not persist. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
The symptomology can be divided into neuropsychiatric-cognitive, cardiac, metabolic, muscular, and bone 
symptoms, such as: 
Lack of well-being 
•  Changes in memory, processing speed and attention 
• 
•  Depression 
•  Anxiety 
•  Social isolation 
• 
Fatigue 
• 
Lack of strength 
• 
Fibromyalgia syndrome 
•  Neuromuscular dysfunction 
•  Central adiposity 
•  Decreased muscle mass 
•  Decreased bone density 
• 
Impaired cardiac function

•  Decreased insulin sensitivity 
•  Accelerated atherogenesis with increased carotid intima–media thickness 
• 
• 
Increased low-density lipoprotein 
Pro-thrombotic state 
•  Decreased sweating and thermoregulation. 
Neuropsychiatric-cognitive abnormalities 
Patients with GHD frequently complain of low energy levels, emotional lability, and mental fatigue, resulting 
in a low perceived quality of life.  
Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality 
Although a matter of much debate, several authors have demonstrated increased cardiovascular mortality. 
GH deficiency and insufficiency are associated with higher levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-I levels 
(prothrombotic), carotid intima-media thickness, and loss of circulating CD34+ cells, suggesting endothelial 
dysfunction. The degree of GHD is directly related to increased total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-C 
(LDL), truncal fat, waist–hip ratio, and risk of hypertension, all responsible for the proposed increased 
cardiovascular mortality.  
Body composition and metabolic abnormalities 
AGHD Patients have reduced lean body mass and increased abdominal adiposity. In a study of 15 healthy 
adult women, the authors showed that GH secretion was much reduced in patients with high truncal fat 
compared to those with low truncal fat. Truncal obesity is associated with metabolic syndrome and insulin 
resistance.  
Muscular abnormalities 
AGHD Has been associated with reduced lean muscle mass and impaired neuromuscular function.  
Bone abnormalities 
Although GH may act directly on skeletal cells, most of its effects are mediated by IGF-I, which is present in 
the systemic circulation and is synthesised by peripheral tissues. AGHD Causes low bone turnover 
osteoporosis with an increase in vertebral and non-vertebral fractures, and low bone mass. 
Diagnosis 
According to the current guidelines severe GHD should be defined biochemically within an appropriate clinical 
context. 
In patients with hypothalamic-pituitary disease, the syndrome of AGHD characteristically presents with 
alterations in body composition, including reduced lean body mass and bone mineral density and increased 
fat mass with a preponderance of abdominal adiposity (increased waist circumference). The skin is thin and 
dry, and sweating is reduced. Muscle strength and exercise performance are reduced. An impaired sense of 
well-being and other psychological complaints are common.  
An evaluation for AGHD should be considered only in patients with evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary 
disease, subjects who have received cranial irradiation, or patients with childhood onset of GH deficiency.  
In patients with organic hypothalamic-pituitary disease, the likelihood of AGHD increases with the increasing 
number of pituitary hormone deficits from approximately 45% if no other deficits are present to nearly 100% 
if three or four pituitary hormone deficiencies are present.  
Assessment report  
EMA/95144/2021 
Page 11/129 
 
 
 
The diagnosis of AGHD is established by provocative testing of GH secretion. Patients should be receiving 
stable and adequate hormone replacement for other hormonal deficits before testing.  
At present, the insulin tolerance test is the diagnostic test of choice. The test is contra-indicated in patients 
with electrocardiographic evidence or history of ischemic heart disease or in patients with seizure disorders. 
Severe AGHD is defined by a peak GH response to hypoglycaemia of less than 3 μg/L.  
In patients with contra-indications to the insulin tolerance test, alternative provocative tests of GH secretion 
must be used with appropriate cut-offs (e.g. combined administration of arginine and GHRH).  
Adult patients with hypothalamic-pituitary disease and one or two additional pituitary hormone deficits 
require only one provocative test of GH secretion for the diagnosis of AGHD. In adult patients with 
deficiencies in three or more pituitary axes growth hormone deficiency might be assumed, and in this context 
provocative testing is optional.  
Childhood-onset GH deficiency requires reconfirmation in adulthood. To establish the diagnosis of isolated 
AGHD, it is recommended that, in addition, a second biochemical test of GH status be abnormal.  
2.1.5.  Management 
Once the diagnosis of AGHD is established, an ideal replacement regimen with growth hormone should be 
instituted and titrated to a clinical response and serum IGF-I level. Several growth hormone medicinal 
products have been registered within the European Union such as Norditropin Flexpro (e.g. DK/H/0001/015), 
Norditropin SimpleXx (e.g. DK/H/0001/005), Nutropin Aq (e.g. EU/1/00/164), Omnitrope (e.g. 
EU/1/06/332), and Genotropin (e.g. DK/H/0012/023). Many of these medicinal products contain somatropin 
growth hormone as active substance. Growth hormone is to be administered daily for many of these 
products. 
Dosing regimens  
Growth hormone has to be dosed according to individual requirements of AGHD patients. In general, women 
require higher doses of GH to achieve the same IGFI response. GH secretion normally decreases with age. In 
line with this, GH dose requirements are lower in older patients. For patients aged 30–60 years, a starting 
dose of 300 μg/day is reasonable and is usually not associated with any side effects. Daily dosing should be 
increased by 100–200 μg every 1–2 months titrated to the IGF-IIGF-I SDS target range of 0 up to +2, which 
should generally be kept in the upper half of the reference range, although no published studies offer specific 
guidance in this regard. Clinical benefits may not become apparent for 6 or more months of treatment. Older 
(>60 years) patients should be started on lower doses (100–200 μg/day) and increased more slowly. 
Younger (<30 years) patients may benefit from higher initial doses (400–500 μg/day); for patients 
transitioning from paediatric treatment, even higher doses may be appropriate. For women on oestrogen 
treatment both starting dose and maintenance dose appear to be higher. Current growth hormone-containing 
products provide separate starting regimens for patients with childhood-onset and those with adulthood-
onset AGHD. 
Adverse events 
Most adverse effects include fluid retention (5–18%), hypertension, paresthesias, joint stiffness, peripheral 
oedema, arthralgia, and myalgias, carpal tunnel syndrome (2%). Adult patients who are older, heavier, or 
female are more prone to develop these complications. Most of these adverse reactions improve with dose

reduction. Insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes can occur or worsen in patients with pre-existing diabetes. 
Retinopathy, benign intracranial hypertension, and gynecomastia are rare. 
Although there might have been some concern with respect to the risk of cancer with the use of GH therapy, 
an increase in the recurrence rates of either intracranial or extracranial tumours has not been demonstrated 
in AGHD. 
Interactions 
GH treatment can affect the metabolism of other hormones. GH Affects 11BHSD-1 (11-
betahydroxydehydrogenase-1); hence the initiation of GH may lead to partial cortisol deficiency. GH may also 
interact with the TSH axis. Patients on thyroxine replacement frequently require an increase in their dose 
probably because of enhanced peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 mediated via GH. It may also have a central 
inhibitory effect on TSH. Women require a higher GH dose than men to achieve a similar increment in IGF-I. 
GH Sensitivity is blunted in females on oral oestrogen. Therefore, a thorough assessment of the pituitary 
gland in its entirety is required before considering isolated GH therapy. 
Unmet medical need according to the applicant 
Current GH treatment for AGHD is administered as daily subcutaneous injections in the vast majority of 
patients and often necessitates many years or life-long treatment. Although the development of liquid GH 
formulations and convenient pen devices have simplified the administration process, the daily injections 
remain a burden for the patients and may affect treatment adherence and thereby treatment effectiveness.  
Within GH treatment, studies of AGHD patients have shown poor adherence. For example, a survey of 158 
AGHD patients who were receiving or had received GH therapy rated only 34% as ‘highly’ compliant3, and a 
retrospective single-centre cohort study classified compliance as <20% in approximately 9% of 179 AGHD 
patients.4 In addition, frequent pain from injection, bruising and stinging can contribute to the burden 
associated with daily GH treatment.5   
A long-acting GH like somapacitan which is suitable for once-weekly administration addresses an important 
problem with treatment adherence in chronic disease by reducing the number of required injections (from 
365 to 52 per year). This reduces the distress associated with daily injections and is likely to improve the 
patients’ treatment adherence. In other chronic diseases, research indicates that reduced treatment 
frequency directly increases treatment adherence.6,7,8,9 
In line with the above description of disease characteristics, the clinical part of this overview will focus on 
changes in body composition, (health-related) quality of life and treatment convenience.

About the product 
Somapacitan is a long-acting recombinant human GH derivative with a single substitution in the peptide 
backbone (leucine [L] at position 101 substituted with cysteine [C]) to which an albumin binding moiety has 
been attached. The albumin binding moiety (side-chain) consists of a C16 fatty acid moiety and a hydrophilic 
spacer attached to position 101 of the protein by chemical conjugation. The non-covalent, reversible binding 
to endogenous albumin delays the elimination of somapacitan and thereby prolongs the in vivo half-life (t½ 
and duration of action). Similar techniques have previously been used to prolong the half-life of insulin and 
GLP-1 molecules, such as Levemir, Victoza and Ozempic.

Somapacitan bound to albumin 
The pharmacological effects of somapacitan are like those of human GH. These include stimulation of somatic 
growth, especially skeletal and muscle growth and maintenance. In addition, human GH has many other 
effects on the body including increasing lipolysis, protein synthesis, muscle mass, and gluconeogenesis in the 
liver, and reducing glucose uptake in the liver. As for human GH, the mechanism of action of somapacitan is 
either direct via the GH receptor or indirect via stimulation of IGF-I expression and release. 
The applicant applies for the indication: “Sogroya is indicated for the replacement of endogenous GH in adults 
with growth hormone deficiency (AGHD)”.  
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The somapacitan clinical development programme was designed and conducted in accordance with the 
consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with GHD treatment guidelines10,11 and in 
alignment with scientific advice provided by EMA, FDA and BfArM. FDA guidance with respect to the 
development of somapacitan for AGHD was not submitted by the applicant.  
A detailed evaluation of QTc intervals was performed in trial 4054 (confirmatory phase 3 trial) as advised by 
FDA, a dedicated QT/QTc trial was not considered needed. Furthermore, no dedicated drug-drug interaction 
study was performed as agreed with FDA.

rubber and a stopper made of bromobutyl/isoprene rubber sealed with an aluminium cap.  
The cartridge is contained in a multidose disposable pen made of polypropylene, polyacetal, polycarbonate 
and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene and in addition two metal springs. The cartridge is permanently sealed in 
a pen-injector. 
The finished product is available in pack sizes of 1 pre-filled pen and multipack of 5 (5 packs of 1) pre-filled 
pens. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
Somapacitan (INN) is a recombinant human growth hormone (hGH) derivative produced in E. Coli. The 
leucine at position 101 of the amino acid backbone is replaced with a cysteine to which an albumin binding 
moiety consisting of an albumin binder  and a hydrophilic spacer is attached (see Figure 1). The protein 
backbone displays the four–helical bundle structure with an up-up down-down topology as seen for hGH. The 
structure contains two disulphide bridges, Cys53-Cys165 and Cys182-Cys189, respectively. The albumin 
binding moiety consists of an albumin binder (16-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl) hexadecanoic acid including a 4-
carboxypropyl sulfonamide) and a hydrophilic spacer consisting of six groups. The hydrophilic spacer consists 
of an acetyl group connected to the ε-amino group of lysine by an amide bond, two 8-amino-3,6-
dioxaoctanoic acid (ADO) groups and two γ-glutamic acid (Glu) residues. Terminally, the sulfonamide group 
together with the 16-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl) hexadecanoic acid provides the albumin binding function. The 
molecular mass is 23290.56 Da, of which the albumin binding moiety accounts for 1190.6 Da.

Figure 2: Schematic presentation of the primary structure of somapacitan (not to scale) 
Somapacitan binds selectively to and activates hGH receptor, the target for native hGH. When somapacitan is 
injected, the albumin binding moiety binds non-covalently to endogenous albumin resulting in decreased 
renal clearance and protection from metabolic degradation.  
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
The active substance is manufactured at Novo Nordisk US Bio Production Inc. (NNUSBPI) in New Hampshire, 
USA. Three sites of Novo Nordisk A/S in Denmark are involved in the quality control of the active substance.  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Active substance 
The  manufacturing  process  is  divided  into  three  stages:  propagation/fermentation,  recovery,  and 
modification/purification (see Figure 2).  
The active substance manufacturing process starts with the thawing of one working cell bank (WCB) vial. 
In  the  propagation  and  fermentation  stage,  the  cells  are  propagated  from  the  WCB  in  shake  flasks  and 
transferred into a bioreactor for further propagation.  
At the end of the production phase, the recovery process starts, consisting of cell harvest, homogenisation, 
solubilisation, clarification, and a chromatography step.  
The purification of the somapacitan precursor includes chromatographic steps and is followed by digestion of 
somapacitan precursor and alkylation of reduced digested somapacitan precursor with side-chain reagent. At 
the end of the manufacturing process, the active substance is pre-formulated. It is then filtered through the 
0.2 μm filter into bottles, stored and shipped to the finished product manufacturing sites. 
The different buffers used at different levels of the upstream and downstream process are well defined. The 
manufacturing steps are generally well described with the process parameters and the ranges.  
No reprocessing is performed.

Pooling  of  capture  batches  is  supported  by  the  process  verification  study  (also  referred  to  as  process 
performance qualification (PPQ)).  
Side chain  
The synthesis of the albumin binding side chain has been described in sufficient detail. The reaction mechanism 
has been provided, the reagents indicated, and information on reaction conditions (temperatures, durations, 
and amounts of materials) are provided, for critical and non-critical parameters. A justification of the defined 
starting materials and a discussion on the carry-over of impurities and incorporation into the active substance 
have been provided. 
A major objection was raised as one of the initially proposed side chain starting materials was not considered 
suitable in view of its structure, the origin and fate of several impurities and the remainder of the synthesis. 
The issue was resolved as the applicant agreed to redefine the starting material as requested and to update 
the dossier accordingly. The redefined starting material is considered suitable in view of its structure, the origin 
& fate of several impurities and the remainder of the synthesis. The control of the (starting) materials used for 
manufacturing of the side chain is considered sufficient. Information on the synthesis routes and the names 
and addresses of the suppliers have been provided. No materials of human or animal origin are used in the 
synthesis of the side chain. 
In response to a major objection raised, a discussion on potential formation of specified impurities has been 
provided.  The  applicant  provided  a  quantitative  risk  assessment  using  purge  factors  to  evaluate  the  risk  of 
carry over. However, none of these predicted factors were supported by measured purge factors (experimental 
data or spiking studies) and the applicant was asked to provide further data. In response, the applicant provided 
the requested analytical data, demonstrating acceptable levels of the impurities. These results support the risk 
analysis presented. The justification for the impurity limit at the level of the side chain is considered acceptable 
based on the limit in the active substance, the yield of the synthesis step and the contribution of the side chain 
to  the  total  active  substance.  The  analytical  method  used  has  been  shown  to  be  adequately  validated.  The 
major objection is thereby considered fully resolved. 
Control of materials 
Overviews of the raw materials used for propagation and fermentation, recovery, modification and purification 
are provided. With few exceptions, quality control of all raw materials consists of identity testing in accordance 
with Ph. Eur. methods. The specifications applied to non-compendial raw materials are sufficient. The nature 
of the filters and membranes has been described. Sufficient information is provided on the chromatography 
resins. No raw materials of animal origin are used in the somapacitan active substance manufacturing process. 
The source, history, and generation of the cell substrate is sufficiently described.  
The  clone  that  was  used  for  the  generation  of  the master  cell  bank  (MCB)  is  derived  from  an  E.  coli  strain 
transformed with the expression plasmid   
The coding sequence was derived from the hGH coding sequence used at Novo Nordisk A/S for production of 
somatropin  product  Norditropin.  The  L101C  mutation  was  introduced  by  a  PCR  approach.  The  applicant 
analysed the expression construct by sequencing and protein expression. 
A brief description of the manufacture of the MCB and WCB cell banks is provided, including a summary of the 
characterisation  results.  The  testing  is  in  line  with  expectations.  Stability  of  the  cell  banks  is  assessed  by 
viability testing. In addition, the applicant will perform trending of the expression in active substance production 
batches to confirm stability of the WCB with regard to its ability to produce the protein of interest.

The provided protocol for establishment of future WCBs is acceptable.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Active substance 
The applicant provided an overview of process parameters, in-process hold-times, and in-process tests for all 
steps in the active substance manufacturing process.  
The in-process tests are divided in ‘critical in process tests’, ‘in process tests with limits’ and ‘in process tests 
without  limits’.  The  applicant  explained  that  the  latter  tests  are  intended  to  gain  knowledge  and  for  trend 
analysis. This is acceptable. For critical in-process tests, out of specification (OOS) results will result in batch 
rejection. 
Controls are in place for OD600 (end of propagation and end of fermentation), content, purity, product-related 
impurities, and process-related impurities. An overview of the analytical procedures used for critical in-process 
tests is provided, including method descriptions and method validation or verification as appropriate. 
In process holding times are defined for the different process steps. Supportive data has been provided.  
One intermediate is defined in the active substance manufacturing process. A defined shelf life is proposed for 
this intermediate, which is acceptable based on stability data.  
Side chain  
The in-process testing program for the side-chain reagent, including the specification and method descriptions 
are provided. Test parameters include identity, assay and impurities. The method descriptions are acceptable.  
The specification for the side chain has been appropriately justified. The limits for assay, total impurities and 
specified impurities are acceptable and supported by batch analysis data. 
A protocol for a stability study for side chain is provided. Data have been provided, which support the proposed 
re-test period.  
Process validation and/or evaluation 
The process validation of the active substance manufacturing process has three key elements: 
- 
- 
Process design, including process evaluation studies and assessment of impurity reduction. 
PPQ  studies  comprising  of  fermentation  batches  with  subsequent  modification  and  purification  as 
defined by the protocols. 
-  Ongoing  process  verification,  including  monitoring  and  assessment  of  process  performance  by  yield 
and selected impurities. 
Process evaluation studies 
All process parameters have been evaluated using a risk-based approach with regard to their potential effect 
on  the  critical  quality  attributes  (CQAs)  and  process  performance.  Based  on  this,  process  parameters  were 
selected  for  further  investigation  in  laboratory  scale  and/or  production  scale  process  characterisation 
experiments  in  order  to  justify  limits  for  the  process  parameters.  The  risk  assessment  is  provided.  The 
summaries of the characterisation studies and additional data that was provided upon request sufficiently justify 
the  operational  ranges  of  the  process  parameters,  also  taking  into  account  that  appropriate  controls  are  in 
place. The representativeness of the small-scale studies is sufficiently demonstrated.  
Assessment report  
EMA/95144/2021

Removal of the process related impurities is sufficiently demonstrated.  
PPQ studies 
Fermentation and recovery: An appropriate number of batches were included. All acceptance criteria were met 
and results support consistent performance of these process steps. 
Modification and purification: The PPQ batches for fermentation and recovery were manufactured into substance 
batches. Additional testing was performed to address impurity removal. All acceptance criteria were met, with 
the  exception  of  an  OOS  results  which  was  attributed  to  a  technical  error  and  not  process  related.  Taken 
together, the results support consistent performance of these process steps. 
Column lifetime and sanitisation procedures are supported by validation data. In addition, an extractable study 
was performed for each resin. None of the extractable levels were found above their corresponding analytical 
evaluation threshold.  
Sufficient  information  is  provided  as  regards  the  extractables  and  leachables from  the  materials  that  are  in 
contact with the active substance.  
A summary of the shipping and transportation validation of intermediates is provided and gives no reason for 
concern. 
Ongoing process verification 
Data from the in-process controls and additional testing will be reviewed after manufacture of a defined number 
of fermentation runs following PPQ. Test results will be evaluated in an internal ongoing process verification 
report  which  will  use  applied  statistics  to  conclude  on  further  monitoring.  The  approach  is  considered 
acceptable. 
Manufacturing process development 
Development of the active substance manufacturing process is sufficiently described. The applicant identifies 4 
manufacturing processes: the initial non-clinical process, the Phase 1 process, the Phase 3 initial process and 
the Phase 3 process. Changes implemented between the processes have been described and include changes 
to process steps, source of materials, manufacturing scale, active substance concentration, container closure 
and manufacturing facilities. 
For  each  of  the  manufacturing  processes/process  stages  at  least  1  batch  was  included  in  the  comparability 
exercise. In addition, batch release results were compared. The characterisation studies performed to assess 
comparability are considered appropriate. The results of the comparability study did not reveal any differences 
between  batches  manufactured  according  to  the  different  manufacturing  process,  apart  from  a  tendency  of 
reduced levels of impurities at later stages of process development.  
Characterisation 
Structural characteristics and physico-chemical properties 
To  study  its  structural  characteristics,  the  applicant  analysed  somapacitan  using  a  number  of  analytical 
methods. The results confirmed the theoretical mass, amino acid sequence, location of disulphide bridges and 
the albumin binder, and integrity of the N- and C-termini. In addition, the applicant appropriately analysed the 
physical-chemical properties of somapacitan, including higher order structure, solubility, isoelectric point, UV 
absorbance spectra, and pH stability.

Biological activity 
The  applicant  has  evaluated  the  binding  capacity  of  somapacitan  to  growth  hormone  binding  protein,  and 
human serum albumin, and its biological activity. The biological activity is determined using a bioassay in which 
cell  proliferation  of  a  growth-hormone  dependent  cell  line  in  response  to  increasing  concentrations  of 
somapacitan is measured. Results are calculated using an in-house reference standard and expressed as U/mg 
monomeric protein.  
Product-related impurities 
Product-related  impurities/substances  are  appropriately  described  and  characterised.  Depending  on  their 
biological activity, they are either classified as ‘substance’ (full bioactivity) or ‘impurity’ (bioactivity differs from 
somapacitan).  The  control  strategy  for  product-related  substances/impurities  is  in  general  acceptable.  In-
process controls with limits are in place for impurities. The active substance specification includes acceptance 
criteria for certain product-related impurities. 
Process-related impurities 
Removal of process related impurities is sufficiently demonstrated. Active substance release specifications are 
in place for endotoxin. 
Specification, analytical procedures, reference standards, batch analysis, and 
container closure 
The  release  specifications  for  somapacitan  active  substance  are  in  general  acceptable  and  include  general 
parameters, identity, specific bioactivity, content, product-related impurities, process-related impurities, and 
microbial controls  
The applicant briefly described the approach for setting quantitative acceptance criteria, and for each parameter 
provided an overview of the release method and the data used to set acceptance criteria. Upon request, the 
proposed  acceptance  criteria  were  tightened  and  further  justified  to  reflect  actual  current  manufacturing 
experience.  
Analytical methods 
The description of the test methods is acceptable. All methods have been validated in line with ICH guidelines 
or, in case of compendial methods, verified in accordance with Ph. Eur.  
The  Bioassay  (U/mL)  consists  in  an  in  vitro  cell  proliferation  assay  cells  dependent  on  growth  hormone  for 
proliferation.  The  growth  of  the  cell  line  is  induced  in  a  dose-dependent  manner  by  adding  increasing 
concentrations of somapacitan or recombinant hGH. The bioactivity is calculated by comparison of the dose-
response curve of an analytical sample to the dose-response curve for the somapacitan reference material. The 
Specific  bioactivity  is  defined  as  1.00  U/mg  for  the  somapacitan  primary  reference  material,  as  no  external 
standard exists.  
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data were presented for all the active substance batches produced during development for non-
clinical  studies,  clinical  trials,  reference  material,  setting  of  specifications,  stability  studies,  comparability 
studies, technical use and PPQ. The specifications have been updated throughout development. All data comply 
Assessment report  
EMA/95144/2021 
Page 20/129 
 
 
 
with the active substance acceptance criteria. For PPQ batches, all results met commercial acceptance criteria 
and demonstrate consistency in the active substance manufacturing process. 
Reference standards 
The  production  and  testing  of  the  current  primary  and  secondary  material  (PRM  and  SRM)  are  in  general 
sufficiently  described.  Both  standards  are  derived  from  the  same  active  substance  batch  and  tested  in 
accordance with the active substance release specifications. 
The PRM and SRM have both been assigned a specific activity of 1 U/mg by default. This is acceptable, as they 
are  derived  from  the  same  active  substance  batch,  no  international  standard  is  available,  and  data 
demonstrating a correlation between content and activity is provided. 
New  standards  will  be  prepared  and  qualified  as  described  for  the  current  standards.  The  issue  of  potency 
shifts, which might result from the approach to assign a default specific activity of 1 U/mg to new reference 
standards, was sufficiently addressed. 
The long-term stability is followed by yearly monitoring. Upon request, a stability protocol for the PRM and SRM 
was provided.  
Container closure system 
The active substance is stored in suitable containers. The information provided on the container closure system 
includes its raw materials, dimensional drawings, manufacturers, compliance with compendial requirements, 
release  specifications  and  a  discussion  on  extractables  and  leachables.  The  information  provided  for  the 
container closure system is considered acceptable. 
Stability 
The active substance stability studies are performed in accordance with ICH/CHMP guidelines. A representative 
version of the proposed container closure system was used in the stability studies. Primary stability studies 
were performed with batches from the commercial process. Batches were also used for accelerated stability 
testing.  
Results  from  all  batches  were  comparable  and  complied  with  the  specifications  under  long-term  storage 
conditions. No trends were observed.  
With regard to the PPQ batches, long term stability and accelerated data are available.  Results are in line with 
the results from the primary stability studies. 
Based on the data presented, the proposed shelf life is considered acceptable.  
The provided stability commitment is acceptable. For the future stability studies, it is accepted that the test for 
specific bioactivity is omitted, as biological activity is considered to be controlled by content.

All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. 
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation.  
There is no overage or overfill. 
The applicant provided an outline of the formulation development. The use of a liquid formulation compatible 
with a dose-adjustable multidose cartridge/pen is sufficiently substantiated.  
The chosen formulation is a compromise between several elements. Especially the trade-off between HMWPs 
and deamidation is noted. The preservative efficacy is justified as being an acceptable compromise providing 
sufficient microbial reduction for a weekly dosed product as well as adequate chemical stability and acceptable 
local  tolerance.  In  conclusion,  the  chosen  formulation  is  considered  sufficiently  substantiated  with  data, 
including the choice of the preservation system. 
The primary packaging is a 1.5 ml cartridge made of colourless hydrolytic glass (type 1 glass, Ph. Eur., USP 
and JP). The closure at one end of the cartridge is a cap that consists of a rubber disc and a seal of aluminium. 
The rubber disk, in contact with the finished product, is made of laminated bromobutyl rubber (type 1 rubber, 
Ph. Eur. and USP). The closure at the other end of the cartridge is a plunger made of chlorobutyl rubber (type 
1 rubber, Ph. Eur. and USP). The laminated rubber and rubber plunger are not made with natural rubber latex.  
Both  rubber  components used,  the  laminate  rubber  components  in  the  cap  and  the  rubber  plunger,  comply 
with Ph. Eur. 3.2.9 Rubber Closured for Containers for Aqueous Parenteral Preparations, for Powders and for 
Freeze-dried Powders (Type I rubber). 
The glass barrel complies with Ph. Eur. 3.2.1 Glass containers for Pharmaceutical Use (Type I). 
The 1.5 mL cartridge is assembled in a PDS290 pen-injector, which is a multi-dose device, intended for once-
weekly subcutaneous injection of somapacitan (see Figure 3). It is an integral device which should be discarded 
when  empty  or  at  the  end  of  the  in-use  shelf  life  (6  weeks).  The  device  was  also  used  during  the  Phase  3 
clinical studies. 
The  PDS290  pen-injector  was  designed  and  developed  by  Novo  Nordisk  A/S  to  comply  with  the  relevant 
requirements  of  Annex  I  ‘Essential  Requirements’  of  Directive  93/42  EEC.  An  EU  Declaration  of  Conformity 
issued by the device manufacturer Novo Nordisk A/S (Novo Allé, DK-2880 Bagsvaerd Hovedstaden, Denmark) 
Assessment report

and a Certificate of Conformity issued by a Notified Body (LRQA) for the Novo Nordisk A/S (Novo Allé, DK-2880 
Bagsvaerd Hovedstaden, Denmark) have been provided. 
Figure 3 
Somapacitan cartridge assembled in a PDS290 pen-injector 
The finished product is enclosed within the cartridge and not in contact with the device. The device is intended 
to  connect  to  a  standard  needle  thread  or  a  needle  with  a  bayonet  coupling  prior  to  finished  product 
administration. Needles are not included. The pen has been tested with 31 Gx6 mm and 32 Gx5 mm disposable 
needles.  
The description of the device and its mechanistic aspects have been provided in sufficient detail. The design is 
in line with requirements of ISO 11608-1:2015. The device is based on currently registered devices such as 
the  somatropin  product  Norditropin  FlexPro.  Biocompatibility  is  stated  as  per  ISO  10993-1:2018.  Design 
verification results have been provided in order to show dose accuracy at various dose settings and at various 
environmental conditions as per ISO 11608-1. The usability study (human factors validation study) is based 
on  the  PDS290  pen-injector  family  studies  performed  on  other  pen-injectors  /  products  of  the  applicant. 
Similarity of the device regarding dose, intended use and user population of somatropin (0.05 mg somatropin 
per  increment  with  maximum  of  80  increments,  subcutaneous  injection,  adults  and  paediatric  population  in 
home  or  hospital  setting)  is  acceptable.  No  adverse  events  related  to  the  device  were  reported  during  the 
clinical trials. This is considered sufficient justification for not performing a new usability study specifically for 
somapacitan. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured at Novo Nordisk A/S (Gentofte, Denmark). 
The  finished  product  manufacturing  process  consists  of  successive  mixing  of  two  solutions,  including 
formulation steps. Following the mixing steps, the finished product is sterile filtered through two filters in series, 
filled aseptically in the cartridges, visually inspected then stored protected from light at 2°C-8°C.  
Overall the description is clear with identification of the process parameters and their limits.  
Critical steps and controls were identified.  
A  major  objection  was  raised  in  relation  to  lack  of  adequate  information  around  the  assembly  process  and 
control strategy for the pen-injectors. In response, the applicant provided the requested information in relation 
to  the  in-process  controls,  validation  of  the  assembly  process  and  provided  further  justification  of  the 
parameters to be included in the finished product specifications. The responses were considered satisfactory 
and therefore the major objection was resolved. 
An appropriate validation campaign was executed for the formulation and cartridge filling steps, which 
comprised PPQ batches of the to-be-marketed 10 mg/1.5 mL product and a supportive batch.  
The critical features of the assembly process of the pen-injector have been validated.

Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis 
The  release  specifications  for  somapacitan  finished  product  include  general  parameters  (pH,  appearance), 
identity,  content,  product-related  impurities,  particulate  matter,  osmolality,  identity  of  phenol,  phenol 
poloxamer 188, dose accuracy, extractable volume, and microbial controls (sterility, endotoxin).  
In general, the finished product specifications and control strategy are reasonably well described and justified.  
During the procedure, a major objection was raised as the proposed specification acceptance criteria (for both 
active substance and finished product, release and shelf life) were not considered acceptable.  
The Applicant was asked to substantiate (with, e.g. biological, immunological and toxicological data) that the 
proposed levels would not pose a clinical safety concern in cases where the shelf-life criteria were wider than 
clinical experience. It was also requested that acceptance criteria should be substantiated where they did not 
reflect actual current manufacturing experience.  
In response, the applicant provided an extensive re-evaluation of the data set and improved the justification 
of specifications. From the presented justification, it can be concluded that the proposed acceptance criteria 
are in line with manufacturing experience/capability. Upon further request, the applicant also provided a more 
robust  justification  based  on  the  available  clinical/non-clinical/toxicological  data,  including  considerations 
relating  to  immunogenicity.  As  the  responses  were  found  satisfactory,  the  major  objection  was  considered 
resolved. 
Potential sources and levels of elemental impurities and residual solvents in somapacitan finished product have 
been evaluated. In alignment with ICH Q3D a risk assessment based on the principles of risk management as 
described in ICH Q9 has been performed to determine the probability of inclusion of elemental impurities in 
somapacitan  finished  product,  and  to  establish  appropriate  controls  to  ensure  the  quality  of  the  finished 
product. The levels of elemental impurities are well below the threshold of 30% of the permitted daily exposure 
(PDE) limits stated in ICH Q3D. The levels of residual solvents are well below the PDE limits stated in ICH Q3C. 
Elemental impurities and residual solvents are therefore not included in the finished product specifications. 
A risk evaluation in relation to the potential risk of nitrosamine impurities has been provided covering both 
the active substance and finished product. A detailed discussion is included in the active substance section. 
The risk assessment at the level of finished product, concluding that there is no risk for nitrosamine 
formation relating to the excipients or the rubber closures, is endorsed.  
Analytical methods 
The  following  tests  are  performed  in  accordance  with  Ph.  Eur.:  appearance,  osmolality,  pH,  particulates, 
sterility, bacterial endotoxins and extractable volume. The non-compendial methods used to determine content 
and  purity/impurity  profile  are  identical  to  the  analytical  methods  used  for  the  active  substance  and  their 
suitability  has  been  confirmed  in  the  active  substance  section.  In  addition,  phenol  identity  and  content  are 
determined and poloxamer 188 content. These tests have been suitably validated.  
The absence of determination of the specific bioactivity at the finished product level was justified in the active 
substance section by the establishment of a correlation between the content and the specific bioactivity.

Batch analysis 
An  overview  of  somapacitan  10  mg/1.5  mL  batches  produced  during  development  is  provided  as  well  as 
supportive  data  for  other  somapacitan  presentations  (not  covered  by  the  current  application).  The  batch 
analyses  data  demonstrates  acceptable  batch-to-batch  consistency  and  reproducibility  of  the  manufacturing 
process proposed for the finished product. 
Reference standards 
The reference materials used for testing and release of the finished product are the same as the ones used for 
the active substance. Therefore, reference is made to the active substance section. 
Stability of the product 
The proposed storage and shelf life for the finished product is 24 months at 2-8 °C including an in-use period 
of 6 weeks at 2-8 ºC and a total of 72 hours (3 days) at room temperature (at or below 30 ºC). 
The composition, finished product manufacturing process, batch size and container closure system used in 
the presented studies are identical to the ones intended for the market.  
A finalised long-term stability study (24 months at 5 °C ± 3 °C) and a finalised accelerated stability study (6 
months at 25 °C ± 2 °C) were performed on the primary stability batches. 
For the PPQ batches long-term stability study, 24 months at 5 °C ± 3 °C, has been initiated (12 months data 
currently available), and an accelerated stability study (6 months at 25 °C ± 2 °C) has been finalised.  
The proposed testing program, which mainly comprises the specification/release tests, is exhaustive and can 
be considered acceptable. 
The primary and PPQ batches have similar degradation patterns and rates. It is noted that after 24 months 
values for several product-related substances/impurities are well below the proposed shelf-life specification. 
The results of the accelerated stability studies are consistent with the results obtained in the real-time stability 
studies.  
An in-use stability study (5 °C ± 3 °C for 6 weeks including 72 hours (3 days) at 30 °C ± 2 °C) has been 
performed on the primary stability batches at beginning, middle and end of the proposed shelf life. The 
results of the in-use studies support the proposed in-use period of 6 weeks at 2-8 °C, including the possibility 
of storage at or below 30 °C for a maximum of 72 hours (3 days) at or below 30 °C, allowing for patient 
portability. 
A photostability study in line with ICH Q1B was also performed. The finished product in the primary container 
was shown to be susceptible to chemical degradation when exposed to light. The PDS290 pen-injector provides 
adequate protection of the somapacitan finished product in the primary container. 
In conclusion, the data provided support the proposed shelf life for the finished product of 24 months at 2-8 
°C including an in-use period of 6 weeks at 2-8 ºC and 72 hours (3 days) at room temperature (at or below 
30 ºC). 
An appropriate commitment to finalise the ongoing studies has been provided.

Adventitious agents 
As no raw materials of human or animal origin are used for the manufacture of somapacitan, the finished 
product is evaluated to be safe with regards to TSE agents. 
The producing host strain is E. coli, and since it is not the natural host for mammalian viruses, no testing for 
endogenous or adventitious viruses has been performed. 
A recombinant enzyme is a raw material used during the manufacturing process of somapacitan active 
substance. This enzyme is expressed in a CHO cell line and produced using a serum-free cell cultivation 
process. The raw material master cell bank has been tested for endogenous and adventitious viruses 
according to ICH Q5A. Furthermore, only non-animal derived raw materials are used during the production of 
the raw material. The risk of TSE is therefore negligible, and the risk of a contamination with adventitious 
agents is also minimized. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and  uniformity  of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have 
a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
During the procedure four major objections were raised in relation to quality aspects. 
A major objection was raised in relation to the choice of starting material for the albumin binding side chain. 
The proposed starting material was not considered suitable in view of its structure, the origin and fate of several 
impurities and the remainder of the synthesis. The issue was resolved as the applicant agreed to redefine the 
starting material as requested and to update the dossier accordingly. 
A second major objection was raised as the proposed specification acceptance criteria (for both active substance 
and  finished  product,  release  and  shelf  life)  were  not  considered  acceptable.  The  Applicant  was  asked  to 
substantiate  that  the  proposed  levels  would  not  pose  a  clinical  safety  concern  in  cases  where  the  shelf-life 
criteria  were  wider  than  clinical  experience.  It  was  also  requested  that  acceptance  criteria  should  be 
substantiated where they did not reflect actual current manufacturing experience. In response, the Applicant 
provided an extensive re-evaluation of the data set and improved the justification of specifications. This was 
considered acceptable.  
A third major objection related to a lack of information around the assembly process and control strategy for 
the pen-injectors. In response, the applicant provided the requested information and the major objection was 
resolved. 
Additionally, a major objection was raised in relation to the risk of specified impurities and the absence of a 
risk  assessment  and/or  control  strategy  to  address  this  risk.  In  response,  a  risk  assessment  based  on 
predicted/theoretical purge factors was provided to estimate residual impurity levels in the starting material 
and  somapacitan  active  substance.  Upon  request,  analytical  data  was  also  provided  to  support  the  risk 
assessment. Further to some additional clarifications and provision of validation data for the applied method, 
the major objection was considered resolved.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Somapacitan is a long-acting human recombinant growth hormone (GH) analogue with a single substitution 
in the amino acid backbone (L101C), to which an albumin binding moiety has been attached via a hydrophilic 
spacer. The hydrophilic spacer ensures sufficient distance between the albumin binding portion and the GHR 
binding portion of somapacitan so the molecule can activate the GHR while bound to HSA. The albumin 
binding is non-covalently and serves to prolong the half-life of the compound.  
Somapacitan is intended to be used for the treatment of adults with growth hormone deficiency and is 
suitable for once-weekly administration in humans.  
Somapacitan is produced using recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli (protein backbone) and using 
chemical conjugation (spacer). Somapacitan has a molecular weight of 23,305.1 g/mol and is soluble in an 
aqueous solution. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Somapacitan is a growth hormone receptor (GHR) agonist. Like human growth hormone (hGH), somapacitan 
exerts its biological action via binding to and subsequent activation of the GHR. As for growth hormone (GH), 
the mechanism of action of somapacitan is either directly or indirectly via insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) 
secretion.  
The GHR is expressed as a monomer which forms a ligand-receptor complex consisting of one 
somapacitan/hGH molecule and two GHR molecules. This results in receptor dimerization and receptor 
conformational changes in the cell membrane that leads to signal transduction by activation of the JAK/STAT 
system and a subsequent increase in the production of IGF-I, mainly in the liver, or activation of the 
MAPK/ERK system leading to stimulation of division and multiplication of chondrocytes. IGF-I has growth-
stimulating effects on a number of tissues, including bone tissue thus increased height during childhood and 
adolescents is the most widely known effect of hGH. In addition to increasing height in children, growth 
hormone has many other effects on the body, including increasing lipolysis, protein synthesis, muscle mass 
and gluconeogenesis in the liver and reducing liver uptake of glucose. The effect of somapacitan has been 
evaluated in several in vitro and in vivo pharmacology studies.  
Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis was used to evaluate the binding kinetics of somapacitan to the 
growth hormone binding protein (GHBP). The GHBP was used as a surrogate for the GH receptor (GHR), 
Assessment report  
EMA/95144/2021

since affinities are similar due to receptor ectodomain shedding. The binding kinetics to GHBP (KD) was found 
to be 2.3 and 3.0 nM, for hGH and somapacitan, respectively.  
The natural growth hormone (GH) is evolutionarily homologous to prolactin (PRL). Therefore, also, the 
potency for the PRL receptor was assessed.  
The potency of somapacitan and hGH has been compared on the human GHR and human prolactin receptor 
(PRLR), using bone marrow-derived murine pro-B lymphoid cells (BA/F3) stably overexpressing the human 
GHR or human PRLR, with cell proliferation as a read-out. The potency (EC50) for the GHR was found to be 13 
pM for wild-type hGH and 44 pM for somapacitan (range 33 – 54 pM), indicating that the potency of 
somapacitan was about 0.3-fold hGH. With respect to the hPRLR the potency (EC50) of somapacitan was 4.1 
nM, which is ~8-fold and ~25-fold lower than the potencies of hGH or hPRL, which were 0.52 nM and 
0.16 nM, respectively. Somapacitan has a 93-fold higher potency for the hGHR and hGH 38-fold. Using these 
assays, no clear differences were found in eight different batches, which were used in different phases of 
development and also included fresh and an end-of-shelf-life batch.  
Primary rat hepatocytes and a human hepatoma cell line HuH-7 were used to determine the GHR activation 
and immediate down-stream intracellular signalling (JAK2/STAT5) of somapacitan and hGH. Similar time and 
concentration-dependent GH receptor activation and desensitisation responses are observed in the rat 
hepatocytes and human HuH-7 cell line for somapacitan and hGH. Using 8 nM, phosphorylation of STAT5 (P-
STAT5) was induced, which as maximal after 7.5 – 15 minutes, and declined after 30-60 min. It should be 
noted, however, that compared to hGH a submaximal somapacitan concentration was used and that no 
albumin was present in these assays, making the comparison less physiologically relevant. 
SPR was also used to assess binding kinetic to HSA (qualitative only). It was found that hGH did not bind to 
HSA, while somapacitan did bind. In addition, using protein crystallography, size exclusion chromatography 
and isothermal titration calorimetry, it was found that somapacitan binds to a high-affinity site (KD~0.1-
1.0 µM) and two low-affinity sites (KD~1-10 µM) but that at physiological temperature (37°C) only binding to 
the high-affinity site (hydrophobic interactions) is observed. The binding of somapacitan to plasma proteins in 
human plasma was further investigated using reconstituted human plasma and immobilised somapacitan. 
Binding to HSA was most prominent and at least 100 times more abundant than to other plasma proteins. 
The pharmacological mechanism of GH agonists is well described in the literature. The in vivo 
pharmacodynamics of somapacitan has been investigated in the hypophysectomised Sprague Dawley (SD) 
rat, a rodent model of growth hormone deficiency, using single and multiple doses. Upon single dosing (0.2 – 
35 mg/kg, sc), a dose-dependent increase was seen in body weight gain and in plasma IGF-I levels, that 
increased up to 1000 ng/ml after 3 days. Maximal effect was found with ~3.5 mg/kg. 
The hypophysectomised SD rat model was also used to evaluate in the pharmacodynamic effect of a “Fresh” 
(new batch stored at 5°C) as compared to an “end-of-shelf-life ” (stored at 30°C for 3 months) somapacitan 
batches. No significant differences were observed in the pharmacodynamic properties of Fresh or end-of-
shelf-life batches.  
In a four-week multiple-dose study using hypophysectomised male SD rats, the pharmacodynamic effect of 
daily hGH (sc, 0.44 mg/kg, 2 nmol/kg) and once weekly somapacitan (sc, 3.26 mg/kg, 14 nmol/kg) 
administration was compared. Using daily hGH administration, body weight almost linearly increased for two 
weeks and plateaued thereafter, while the same weekly dose of somapacitan induced a step-wise increase in 
body weight, which continued to increase for up to four weeks. Differences were also seen on IGF-I levels, 
which gradually increased using daily hGH and remained constant thereafter. Using once weekly somapacitan 
dosing, plasma IGF-I rapidly and more prominently increased. The levels declined after four days giving a

weekly fluctuating IGF-I concentration within each dosing interval. The different (stronger) effect on body 
weight gain seems to be in line with the difference in IGF-I response with somapacitan. Somapacitan also 
gave a significantly greater increase in nose-tail length, tibia weight and BMC and a similar effect on cortical 
thickness, muscle mass and body weight normalised lean body mass and fat mass. Blood glucose and insulin 
levels were evaluated in order to access the risk of developing hyperinsulinemia and reduced insulin 
sensitivity, but no difference was observed between the current treatment and vehicle control. The insulin 
concentrations varied independently of treatment in the range of 50-160 pM, while the blood glucose 
concentrations were stable within the normoglycaemic levels of 4.5-6.5 nM. In summary, the same 
cumulative weekly somapacitan dose gave a more prominent (~2-fold) increase in IGF-I exposure and in 
body weight gain than daily hGH, although somapacitan has a 3-fold lower in vitro potency than hGH.  
In male cynomolgus monkeys, a single dose of somapacitan (21.5 nmol/kg, 0.5 mg/kg; i.v. or s.c.) was 
found to increase IGF-I plasma levels 1.5-fold. IGF-I levels started to increase one day after dosing and 
maximum levels were reached after 5 – 7 days, while ten days after treatment plasma  
IGF-I levels were returned to pre-treatment levels. Somapacitan exposure was about 30% lower using the 
s.c. route but this did not influence the extent of the IGF-I response. 
In male Göttingen minipigs, a single dose of somapacitan (10 nmol/kg, 0.23 mg/kg; i.v. or s.c.) was found to 
increase IGF-I plasma levels 3-fold. IGF-I levels started to increase one day after dosing, and maximum 
levels were reached after 3 – 4 days and declined thereafter to IGF-I levels slightly above pre-treatment 
levels at days 7 – 14 post-treatment. A similar increase in IGF-I levels was found using s.c. or i.v. 
administration, although somapacitan exposure was about 3-fold higher using the i.v. route. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
A broad profiling screening panel using 68 biochemical receptors, ion-channels and neurotransmitter 
transporters did not show a clinically relevant competitive interaction with somapacitan (3 μM, 70 µg/mL), 
which is 1000-fold higher than the Cmax exposure of 62.3 ng/mL (~2.7 nM) at a human dose of 8 mg/week. 
No secondary pharmacology effects are expected from somapacitan apart from the known GH effects and 
lower PRL activity. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
The safety pharmacology studies were designed to investigate the effect of somapacitan on major organ 
function (central nervous system, respiratory system and cardiovascular system) and have been conducted in 
vitro and as a part of the GLP repeat-dose toxicity studies in monkeys. A maximal plasma concentration 
(Cmax) of 62.7 ng/ml has been taken as the mean Cmax in humans at the maximum recommended human 
dose (MRHD) of 8 mg/week for exposure comparison. 
In vitro studies on the potential for inhibition of the cardiac potassium channel (human ether-a-go-go-related 
gene, hERG) were used for assessment of the potential for QT prolongation. Treatment with somapacitan (3 
μM) produced no inhibition of hERG channel tail current recorded in HEK293 cells stably transfected with 
hERG cDNA. This indicates that a 1000-fold higher concentration than the mean maximal plasma 
concentration at the MRHD produced no inhibition of hERG tail current. 
The potential effect of somapacitan for QT prolongation was also studied using action potential recordings in 
isolated female rabbit Purkinje fibres. No effects of somapacitan were detected on action potential 
Assessment report

Page 29/129 
 
 
 
parameters of 0.03 μM up to 3 μM, which corresponds to 1000-fold above the maximal mean plasma 
concentration at the MRHD. 
The effect of somapacitan on cardiovascular function was studied in male and female cynomolgus monkeys 
dosed for 2, 13 or 26 weeks with 0.4, 2 or 9 mg/kg (sc, biweekly) somapacitan or vehicle. No effects related 
to somapacitan were observed on blood pressure, heart rate or ECG variables examined (P, PR, QRS, ST, QT, 
QTc, QTcM). In conclusion, it was found that there were no clinically relevant findings in cynomolgus 
monkeys in repeated doses up to 9 mg/kg biweekly, corresponding to >2000-fold the mean Cmax at the 
MRHD of 8 mg/week.  
The effect of somapacitan on neurobehavioural function after 3 days of treatment was studied in male and 
female cynomolgus monkeys dosed for 2 weeks with 0.4, 2 or 9 mg/kg (sc, biweekly) somapacitan or 
vehicle. No effects related to somapacitan were observed on a.o. locomotor activity, balance, alertness, 
vocalisation, grooming, tremors, convulsion, unusual behaviour, aggressiveness, piloerection, several reflexes 
and motor control.  
In the same cynomolgus monkeys study the effect of somapacitan on respiratory function was studied. No 
effects related to somapacitan were observed on respiratory rate or respiratory depth. The NOAEL was 
considered to be 9 mg/kg, biweekly, corresponding to >2000-fold the mean Cmax at the MRHD of 8 
mg/week.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Nonclinical pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have not been conducted with somapacitan. Current 
marketed GH products have been reported to pharmacodynamically interact with eg glucocorticoids, thyroids, 
oestrogens and other reproductive hormones. These effects are also expected for somapacitan.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Somapacitan pharmacokinetic profile was characterized following single intravenous (iv) administration in rat, 
minipig and monkey and subcutaneous (sc) administration to rats, rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys as well 
as in mouse and minipig. Toxicokinetic profiles following repeated dosing were characterized in rat and 
monkey following sc dosing for a total duration of up to 26 weeks. In addition, exposure was characterized as 
part of the Embryo-Foetal Development Studies in rats and rabbits as well as the PPND studies in rats. 
Methods of analysis 
A luminescent oxygen channelling immunoassay (LOCI [AlphaLISA]) was used to determine the plasma 
concentration of somapacitan. The provided validation reports demonstrate that the assays were suitable to 
assess somapacitan concentrations in monkey, rabbit, mouse and rat plasma. The detection range was 60-
12000 ng/ml. Incurred sample reanalysis (ISR) was performed in rat, monkey and rabbit and was acceptable. 
Distribution of radioactivity in rats was analyzed quantitatively via whole-body autoradiography. 
To detect antibodies against somapacitan (ADA), bridging ELISA methods were developed for rat and monkey 
serum. The assays were selective, and the sensitivity was found to be 160 ng/mL for the assay in rat serum 
and 625 ng/ml for the assay in monkey serum (it is noted that the values reported in the summary differ 
from the values in the report). The ADA method has been appropriately validated in accordance with current 
guidelines. The assay cut point has been specified according to pre-treatment samples allowing a 1% false

positive rate. Drug tolerance was 5000 ng/mL of somapacitan in rat serum and 1250 ng/ml in monkey 
serum. It should be noted, however, that the levels of somapacitan in monkey serum may be well above the 
drug tolerance levels and may therefore interfere with the assay sensitivity for ADA detection. No assay was 
available for measuring the neutralising effect of the ADAs, but the impact of ADA’s was analysed by 
comparing pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data.  
Absorption 
Single-dose pharmacokinetic studies following IV administration of somapacitan were performed in rats, 
Cynomolgus monkeys and minipigs. SC single-dose studies were, in addition to these species, also performed 
in mice and rabbits. 
Somapacitan showed non-linear pharmacokinetics, indicated by a decrease in clearance with increasing dose 
levels in rats and a plasma decline in several phases in monkeys. Tmax ranged from 8h in rat to 24h in the 
monkey. The steady-state volume of distribution is low (20-39 ml/kg in all species) and limited to plasma 
volume. Terminal elimination half-life (T1/2) was between 4 and 17 hours via the SC route and did not differ 
from values observed in the IV studies.  
The SC bioavailability of somapacitan was 69, 39 and 36% in monkey, rat and minipig, respectively. Overall, 
a supraproportional increase in exposure was observed with increasing doses, although this was most 
pronounced at the lower doses. Multiple-dose toxicokinetic studies were performed in rats, pregnant rabbits 
and cynomolgus monkeys. In the rat, exposure was reduced after repeated administration. This was less 
pronounced when the frequency of dosing was reduced from daily to bi-weekly. Also in pregnant rabbits, 
exposure was reduced after repeated administration of low doses. At higher dose levels, however, some 
accumulation was observed. Also, in monkeys and humans, slight accumulation was observed (<2-fold). T1/2 
in monkeys after repeated exposure was longer than following single doses (53-64h compared to 17h). The 
non-linear pharmacokinetics of somapacitan are consistent with the pharmacokinetics of human growth 
hormone, which is eliminated by a non-saturable renal route and a saturable hepatic route. 
Anti-drug antibodies against somapacitan were detected in 33-46% of the rats at the end of the 13 and 26 
week study and in only 1 or 2 of the monkeys. Since the levels of somapacitan in monkey serum are well 
above the drug tolerance levels, this may, therefore, interfere with the assay sensitivity for ADA detection. In 
both species, no clear impact on exposure levels was observed. 
There were no apparent gender differences in exposure. 
Distribution 
The extent of plasma protein binding of somapacitan was evaluated in plasma from mouse, rat, rabbit, 
monkey, pig and human using surface plasmon resonance biosensor technology. Somapacitan was highly 
protein-bound (>99%) with free concentrations of 0.01 in New Zealand rabbits, 0.1-0.5 in Wistar rats and 
0.02 in Cynomolgus monkey, which is in the same low range as with human plasma (0.04%).  
Tissue distribution of somapacitan was investigated in albino and pigmented rats using quantitative whole-
body autoradiography (QWBA) following a single s.c. administration of 9 mg/kg [3H]-somapacitan (two 3H 
atoms positioned in the lysine moiety in the linker). Somapacitan was relatively slowly absorbed from the 
injection site, and widely distributed. Plasma to blood ratio was 1.3-1.6. Somapacitan-related material was 
detected in the majority of analysed tissues. Highest concentrations were observed between 12 and 36 hours 
post-dose in bile ducts, kidney cortex, tooth pulp, liver, cerebrospinal fluid, pigmented skin and the urinary 
bladder wall (tissue-blood (T/B) AUC ratios up to 8). In all other tissues, T/B AUC ratios were <1. Low levels 
of radioactivity (<2% of that in blood) were observed in the central nervous system. Melanin binding in the

pigmented uveal tract and skin was observed, but this was reversible (no quantifiable radioactivity at 336h 
post-dosing).  
The effects of somapacitan on placental transfer was assessed by QWBA in pregnant rats following a single 
s.c. dose of 9 mg/kg [3H]-somapacitan on gestational day 17. Higher tissue to blood AUC ratios, up to 17.6 
were observed in pregnant rats. Somapacitan-related material was found in the majority of analysed foetal 
tissues. Foetal tissue to maternal blood AUC ratio was 0.542 for the kidney and <0.2 for all other tissues. 
Following a single s.c. dose of 8 mg/kg somapacitan to lactating rats on approximately day 10 postpartum, 
somapacitan-related material was shown to be secreted into milk. The milk/plasma ratios were in the range 
of 0.175 - 0.496. 
Metabolism 
No metabolic turnover of somapacitan was observed in mouse, rat, monkey and human hepatocytes 
incubated for 48 hours. 
The in vivo metabolism of somapacitan was investigated in rats, monkeys and humans. Somapacitan was the 
main component in plasma. Two major metabolites were identified in plasma: M1 and M1B (products from 
proteolysis of the peptide backbone in somapacitan with intact side chain of Cys101; sum of M1 and M1B 15-
28% in rat, 12% in human) and the unidentified metabolite P1 (eluted early in the chromatogram and likely 
to be tritiated water or another volatile component) (2-4% in rat plasma, 21% in human plasma). Two other 
metabolites with an exposure <5% of total AUC were identified in human plasma. All human metabolites 
were also found in rat and monkey plasma. The rat−human exposure ratios of P1 after multiple dosing of the 
MRHD were 9.1 and 5.2 (Cmax and AUC0-168h). The obtained Cmax exposure of M1 and M1B and rat–
human exposure ratios was >70.  
Excretion 
Excretion of [3H]-somapacitan was investigated in faeces and urine of rats (both sexes) and male monkeys as 
well as in rat bile, up to 120 hours post-dose. Elimination was slow. Urine (cage wash included) was the 
primary route of excretion (83-86% in rat and 54% in monkey). Faecal excretion accounted for 13-15% of 
the dose in rats and 1.7% in monkeys. A study in bile duct cannulated rats showed that biliary excretion 
accounted for 3.3-4.0% of the administered dose. [3H]-somapacitan was excreted only as metabolites; no 
detectable levels of intact somapacitan were observed in urine and faeces. In the monkey, at 120 hours post-
dose, 38% of the label was still retained in the carcass and total recovery was 94%. No obvious gender 
related differences were observed in the rat. Also in humans, urine was the main excretion route (81%), and 
13% was excreted via faeces. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
The results of the studies on the pharmacokinetic drug interaction potential will be evaluated in the clinical 
assessment report.

Repeat dose toxicity 
Rat 
Somapacitan was tested in rat repeat-dose toxicity studies, by daily dosing in a 2-week and 3-month study 
and by twice-weekly dosing in a half-year study. 
Body weight gain, food consumption and IGF-I levels were all increased dose-dependently across all studies. 
In addition, increased relative organ size was observed for most of the organs at higher doses tested, which 
was accompanied by hypertrophy, hyperplasia, increased collagen and other histopathological findings 
related to excessive growth of organs. These effects were part of the expected pharmacological of 
somapacitan in rats and were partially recovered at the end of the recovery period.  
Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) formation of approximately 30-60% was observed in all rat studies. However, this 
did not seem to have an effect on exposure and pharmacology related outcome (e.g. increased body weight 
gain). Positive ADAs were observed in 70% of the control animals in the 3-month study. The cause was not 
identified since there were no quantifiable levels of somapacitan in the control formulations or in the blood 
plasma at the toxicokinetic investigations, and there were extensive measures in place to avoid cross-
contamination. 
In both males and females, lactation and mammary changes and feminisation in males only were observed in 
all studies, often at the lowest dose tested. 
Across studies, haematology parameters affected by somapacitan included decreased haematocrit, 
haemoglobin and erythrocyte count, low mean cell haemoglobin concentration increased reticulocyte counts 
and high mean cell haemoglobin and mean cell volume. 
Clinical chemistry included increased plasma levels of bilirubin, increased platelet count and decreased APT. 
Total protein was increased, which is related to increased protein synthesis induced by growth hormone. Also, 
increased cholesterol and triglyceride levels were observed. Calcium values were increased and plasma 
sodium and chloride was often decreased in males only, which was accompanied by an increased urinary 
output and low urine pH in males. 
In the 3-month study and to a lesser extent the half-year study, signs of diabetes were observed, mainly in 
males, consisting of excessive water intake, increased urine production, high glucose in urine, body weight 
loss, dose-related increase of insulin levels, islet cell hypertrophy/hyperplasia in the pancreas, findings in 
male reproductive organs and bilateral cataract in all animals displaying clinical symptoms of diabetes. 
Most of the above-described somapacitan induced findings in rat were also observed in a previous repeat-
dose toxicity study in the rat with human growth hormone (Jorgenson, 1988). Findings in the previous study 
included effects on body weight, food consumption, haematology parameters (haemoglobin and RBC 
decreases, WBC increases), clinical chemistry parameters (decreases serum cholesterol, beta globulin, 
phosphate, ALAT, APT, blood glucose levels and albumin), development of anti-drug-antibodies, increased 
amounts of calcium and phosphate in urine, enlarged mammary glands with lactation in both males and 
females, hyperplasia of the mammary glands, increased organ weights for all organs except prostate, testes 
and pituitary, yellow spots and inflammation in the prostate, mucification of the vaginal epithelium, 
haematopoietic activity in the red pulp of the spleen and fibrosis at the injection sites.  
Most findings could be explained by the pharmacological action of human growth hormone in rats. However, 
administration of hGH and somapacitan to rodents results in an un-physiological receptor activation of both 
the growth hormone receptor (GHR) and the prolactin receptor (PRLR). In humans and monkeys, endogenous 
Assessment report  
EMA/95144/2021 
Page 33/129 
 
 
 
GH has a high affinity for both the GHR and PRLR. Likewise, in rodents, human GH has a high affinity for both 
the endogenous GHR and the PRLR, whereas rodent GH only binds to the rodent GH receptor. Due to this 
known un-physiological binding of somapacitan and hGH to the PRLR receptor, it is difficult to discern which 
effects observed are relevant for the clinical situation. Based on this, the rat is not considered an appropriate 
model for testing toxicity of somapacitan. 
Although it is recognized that many of the observed effects can be explained by the pharmacological action of 
somapacitan in rats, these observed effects are still considered to be adverse and have been taken into 
account to establish the NOAEL. In all studies, adverse effects were observed at the lowest dose tested, 
including effects on mammary tissue and lactation in both males and females. Therefore, it is considered that 
a NOAEL was not reached in any of the rat repeat-dose toxicity studies. The exposure (AUC) at the lowest 
dose tested with daily dosing in the 2-week and 3-month study (0.4 mg/kg/day) was unfortunately not 
reported for males. In females, this was reported, and an exposure margin was 4.8-22.8 fold MRHD was 
calculated. The exposure margin at the lowest dose tested for twice-weekly dosing in the half-year study was 
3.5 and 3.3 fold MRHD exposure for males and females, respectively.  
Additionally, in the 3-month study, some specific adverse findings were observed, including CPN in kidney 
and diabetes-like symptoms, including cataract formation. The exposure margin at the NOAEL for findings of 
CPN in the kidneys was 11 fold MRHD exposure, the exposure margin for the NOAEL for cataract formation 
and diabetes-like symptoms observed in males was approximately 38 fold the MRHD exposure. 
Cynomolgus monkey 
In repeat-dose toxicity studies cynomolgus monkeys were treated with somapacitan for up to 6 months. 
Somapacitan increased IGF-I plasma concentrations at all doses tested. Mammary swelling and lactation 
were observed in males and females, together with histopathological changes including acinar dilation and 
epithelial papillary hyperplasia. These adverse effects were more prominent in females and partially 
reversible at up to 6 weeks recovery. Haematology findings included decreased haematocrit and 
haemoglobulin count in females and decreased plasma glucose in males. No glucose was detected in urine. In 
literature, similar effects by human growth hormone on mammary tissue, including lactation, and increased 
glucose levels were earlier described in a cynomolgus monkey repeat dose study (Jorgensen, 1988). Red 
areas were observed at the injection site, with scabs and ulcers and necrosis/collagen degeneration with or 
without oedema and perivascular inflammation was observed around the injection site. Although most effects 
are considered to be related to the pharmacology of somapacitan, they are considered to be adverse. 
Therefore, a NOAEL was not reached in these studies. The exposure margin at the lowest doses tested in 
cynomolgus monkeys compared to exposure at MRHD lies between 67 and 95 fold. 
Genotoxicity 
Somapacitan was not found to be genotoxic in the reverse mutation test, chromosome aberration test and 
the in vivo micronucleus test. Somapacitan has no genotoxic potential. 
Carcinogenicity 
In a CHMP scientific advice procedure it was agreed that a carcinogenicity assessment of somapacitan based 
on a weight of evidence approach in accordance with the ICH S6 guideline was likely to be sufficient. CHMP 
also endorsed that the rodent is an unsuitable model for human risk assessment related to the carcinogenic 
potential of somapacitan, due to differences in receptor activation pattern between human growth hormone 
Assessment report  
EMA/95144/2021 
Page 34/129 
 
 
 
in rodent and human. The CHMP concluded that long-term carcinogenicity studies in the rat are considered 
not likely to contribute to human risk assessment. 
The Applicant provided a weight of evidence approach on the potential for the carcinogenicity of somapacitan 
using non-clinical data of somapacitan and a literature review of human growth hormone and carcinogenicity. 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies showed that the proliferative effects of supra-physiological doses of somapacitan 
and hGHin the ratincluded an increase in body weight gain and organ weights as well as hyperplasia in bone 
and mammary gland and hypertrophy in a large number of organs. In cynomolgus monkey, proliferative 
effects were only observed in the mammary gland. Difference between rat and monkey can be explained by 
the activation by hGH of the prolactin receptor (PRLR), which is seen specifically in rats. Genotoxicity studies 
for somapacitan did not show genotoxic potential. Therefore, the proliferative changes in the repeat-dose 
toxicity studies are considered to be due to the exaggerated pharmacology of somapacitan. In addition, in 
vivo proliferative effect on hepatocytes in monkeys was not observed. Also, in vitro proliferation data of 
somapacitan investigated in a functional Ba/F3 cell proliferation assay showed the potency of somapacitan 
was approximately 3-4-fold lower and 8-fold lower than the potency of wild-type hGH in activating the human 
GHR and human prolactin receptor, respectively. These data show that the risk of mitogenic action of 
somapacitan is similar to wild type hGH related to binding to human GHR and PRLR. 
Incidentally, one tumour was observed in each of the three pivotal rat studies. All three tumours were of a 
different type and observed at different doses without any dose-response relationship. 
In literature, it was shown that recombinant rat and mouse GH was not carcinogenic in rat and mouse, 
respectively. However, transgenic mice for hGH were found to develop mammary gland carcinomas, probably 
due to un-physiological stimulation of PRLR. In addition, it was shown in bovine growth hormone transgenic 
mice that 20 fold elevated levels of growth hormone with increased IGF-I levels did not induce tumour 
growth, whereas stimulation of PRLR without stimulation of GH or IGF-I did induce mammary tumours in 
these transgenic mice. This data indicate that in the rodent, proliferative and hypertrophic effects are caused 
through the PRLR.  
The provided weight of evidence approach shows the rodent is not a sufficient model to study carcinogenicity 
of human growth hormone in rodents. 
The Applicant shortly described literature on possible carcinogenic effects of hGH in human. In short, in 
human, it remains inconclusive if there is an association between growth hormone replacement therapy and 
increased long-term risk of developing a malignancy. 
As with human growth hormone products, somapacitan is to be contraindicated for treatment in the presence 
of active malignancy and any pre-existing malignancy should be inactive and its treatment complete prior to 
instituting therapy with somapacitan. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Fertility 
Male and female fertility was assessed in rats.  
In males, relative organ weight (as percentage of terminal body weight) of epididymis, prostate, seminal 
vesicles and testes were decreased. This effect can be explained by the somapacitan induced increased body 
weight of the rats compared to control. In addition, pale areas of the prostate were observed, which was also 
Assessment report  
EMA/95144/2021 
Page 35/129 
 
 
 
described in literature in a repeat-dose toxicity study in rats with hGH (Jorgenson, 1988). However, no 
effects were observed on pre-coital interval, mating performance and fertility and mean numbers of 
implantations, resorptions and live embryos. Somapacitan did not have an adverse effect on male fertility at 
an exposure margin of 13 fold exposure at MRHD. 
In females, somapacitan induced irregular oestrous cycles at all doses tested. In addition, number of 
copulation plugs and sperm count estimates from vaginal smears at mating were lower at all doses. However, 
these changes did not have any effect on mating performance, fertility, litter size mean numbers of 
implantations, resorptions and live embryos. Therefore, earlier described effects are not considered adverse 
in rats. However, the clinical relevance of somapacitan induced disruption of the oestrus cycle is unknown. 
Female fertility was not adversely affected up to an exposure margin of 15 fold exposure at MRHD. 
Embryo-foetal development 
Effects of somapacitan on embryo-foetal development were assessed in rat and rabbit.  
In rat repeat-dose toxicity studies, clearance of somapacitan after daily dosing significantly increased around 
Days 4-6 of treatment. Therefore, to ensure adequate exposure throughout organogenesis, a split-dose 
design was employed with exposure from GD6-9, GD10-13 and GD14-17. Maternal animals showed body 
weight gains at all doses tested for all treatment periods, with a concurrent increase of IGF-I. Mean foetal 
weights were slightly increased during treatment at GD10-13. In addition, at GD10-13 at the high dose only, 
an increased incidence of short-, bent-, and/or thickened long bones was observed. In literature, it has been 
described that these findings are common in rat and resolve within a few weeks after birth. Furthermore, it 
has recently been suggested by multiple research groups that these effects are to be recognized as 
variations. Although the severity of these findings can be questioned, the applicant considered these effects 
as adverse and used these effects to set the NOAEL. The exposure margin for embryo-foetal development at 
this NOAEL is 18 fold exposure at MRHD. 
In the rabbit, somapacitan was given every other day from GD6 through GD18. Maternal body weight gain 
was increased at the mid and high dose and IGF-I was also increased in a dose-responsive manner. Placental 
weight was reduced at a high dose. Foetal weight was reduced at all doses, with 9% at low dose and 11% at 
mid and high doses. Reduced foetal weight was found concurrent with unossified and incomplete ossification 
of the metacarpals and phalanges at all dose levels. These growth-related effects may be secondary due to 
the reduced placental weight at high dose and maternal mediated effects, although no major maternal 
toxicity was observed at any dose. No malformations or embryo-foetal lethality were observed. Based on the 
significantly reduced foetal body weight of up to 11%, a NOAEL for embryo-foetal development cannot be 
determined. Exposure at the lowest dose tested was 9 fold exposure at MRHD. 
Pre-and postnatal toxicity 
In a pre-and postnatal study in rats, somapacitan postnatal pup weight gain was increased. In addition, a 
dilated renal pelvis was observed in offspring. However, this effect was reversible in animals grown to 
maturity. These effects were not considered adverse. The exposure margin was 310 fold exposure at MRHD. 
Juvenile toxicity 
No juvenile toxicity studies were performed. The PDCO adopted a refusal of the PIP for somapacitan and 
agreement of a full waiver in all paediatric subsets on the grounds of lack of significant therapeutic benefit 
and likely lack of safety.

Toxicokinetic data 
Overall, plasma concentrations increased in a supra-proportional manner, although this was most pronounced 
at the lower doses.  
Adequate exposure was maintained to evaluate safety in the toxicological studies. Exposure multiples (based 
on AUC) at lowest doses tested were 2.4-11 in rats and 67-95 in monkeys. Also in reproductive toxicology 
studies exposure ratios were sufficient (≥13 in rats but < 9 in rabbits). 
Anti-somapacitan antibodies were detected in 33-46% of the rats at the end of the 13 and 26-week study 
and in only 1 or 2 of the monkeys (probably an underestimation due to the fact that the levels of 
somapacitan in monkey serum were above the drug tolerance levels). However, in both species, no clear 
impact on exposure levels was observed. 
Interspecies comparison 
The pharmacokinetics of somapacitan were studied primarily in rats and monkeys. The absorption of 
somapacitan following SC administration was relatively fast, with a Tmax of 4-24 h in rats, monkeys and 
humans. Somapacitan displays non-linear pharmacokinetics, but at low doses (as in the clinically relevant 
dose range), pharmacokinetics are approximately linear. When dose levels increase further, plasma clearance 
decreases. At low doses, exposure was reduced after repeated administration in rats and rabbits, but at 
higher doses some accumulation is observed. In all species as well as humans, somapacitan is extensively 
bound (>99%) to plasma proteins (mainly albumin). The steady-state volume of distribution is low (20-39 
ml/kg) in all species. The estimated volume of distribution (V/F) in humans was 14.6 L. In animals and 
humans, somapacitan is metabolised by proteolytic degradation, and cleavage of the linker sequence 
between the peptide and albumin binder. Urine is the primary route of excretion. Elimination half-life in 
animals ranges from 4-17 hours and is similar after s.c. and iv administration. In AGHD patients, a plasma 
terminal half-life of 2-3 days was estimated. The subcutaneous bioavailability of somapacitan in humans has 
not been investigated but was 36-69% in rat, monkey and minipig. No obvious gender differences were 
observed in the pharmacokinetics of somapacitan in animals. In humans, females (especially females on oral 
oestrogen) have lower exposure than males. 
Local Tolerance  
Somapacitan produced limited inflammatory effects at the local injection site in rats (inflammatory cell 
infiltrate), monkeys (limited inflammatory tissue reaction) and rabbits (mild inflammatory changes). 
Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity 
Anti-drug antibodies for somapacitan were formed in the rat (30-60%) and were sporadically observed in the 
monkey. However, adequate exposure was obtained in toxicity studies, and expected pharmacodynamic 
effects were registered. 
Metabolites 
Assessment report  
EMA/95144/2021 
Page 37/129 
 
 
 
All human metabolites of somapacitan were also found in rat and monkey plasma. The rat−human exposure 
ratios of P1 after multiple dosing of the MRHD were 9.1 and 5.2 (Cmax and AUC0-168h). The obtained Cmax 
exposure of M1 and M1B and rat–human exposure ratios were >70. 
Impurities 
Three different batches of somapacitan were tested in a one-month rat repeat-dose toxicity study. Batches 
tested were the batch used in pivotal non-clinical repeat-dose studies in rat, a batch with additional 
impurities (fatty acid loss) and an end of shelf life batch group consisting of two batches tested during the 
experiment. First end of shelf life batch was stored (to induce deamidation) and used for dosing in weeks 1, 
and 2 of this study, and second end of shelf life batch was stored (to induce high molecular weight proteins) 
and used for dosing in weeks 3 and 4. It is unknown why the Applicant tested two different batches in one 
treatment group. In addition, each of the end of life batches was only tested in serial for 2 weeks, whereas 
the comparator batch (the one used in pivotal studies) was tested for four weeks. The end of shelf-life 
batches was taken into account to compare pharmacodynamic endpoints (body weight gain, IGF-I and insulin 
plasma levels) with the comparator batch. Although body weight gain was assessed throughout the study, 
IGF-I and insulin levels were only assessed at the start and the end of the study. Adverse effects observed 
were generally similar between the three batches; however, the end of shelf life batches group showed a 
marginally lower exposure profile with less severe effects on body weight increase at the end of the study. 
Impurities present in one batch were sufficiently qualified. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The active substance is a peptide, the use of which will not alter the concentration or distribution of the 
substance in the environment. Therefore, somapacitan is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
From a non-clinical point of view, the pharmacology, safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology 
programs are considered sufficient.  
The animal to human exposure ratios have been determined using experimental AUC values of clinical study 
3947 at steady state (0.12 mg/kg dose). Although the Exposure Multiple (EM) at the NOAEL is very low for 
the repeated dose toxicity studies in rat, it is sufficient in the repeated dose toxicity studies in monkey and in 
the reproduction toxicity studies.  
Repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats have been conducted with a daily sc administration in the 2 and 13-week 
studies. Given the development of diabetes in the 13-week study, the dosing regimen has been changed to 
twice-weekly administrations for the 26-week study. In rats, most toxicological findings observed could be 
explained by the pharmacological action of somapacitan via IGF-I. Moreover, the toxicokinetic profile in rats 
is special with a shorter half-life compared to humans and a decline in exposure after multiple daily 
administrations. The exposure to somapacitan in rats is also dependent on time, dose and dosing frequency. 
The toxicokinetic profiles of somapacitan when administered once, twice or three times weekly have been 
compared in the context of an investigative three-week PK study in rats (study 2122272). An increase of the 
dosing frequency from twice weekly to three times weekly generally resulted in a reduced exposure. For 
once-weekly dosing, AUC0-24hr was similar to Day 1, for twice-weekly and three times weekly it had 
decreased to approximately 60% and 40% of Day 1 levels, respectively. Dose-normalised exposure in terms 
of AUC0-24hr and approximate Cmax (6 hours concentration) generally decreased with increasing dose and 
Assessment report

with decreasing dosing interval. The time course of IGF-I concentrations was not investigated in this study. 
However, data from studies performed in in hypophysectomised rats with once weekly administration have 
shown that peak IGF-I concentrations were observed 2-4 days after dosing. Therefore, taking into account 
both PD and PK aspects, the dose frequency of twice/week was the most appropriate choice to investigate 
the toxicity of somapacitan in the 26-week study in rats.               
The Applicant provided a weight of evidence approach on the potential for the carcinogenicity of somapacitan 
using non-clinical data of somapacitan and a literature review of human growth hormone and carcinogenicity. 
In literature, it was shown that recombinant rat and mouse GH was not carcinogenic in rat and mouse, 
respectively. However, transgenic mice for hGH were found to develop mammary gland carcinomas, probably 
due to un-physiological stimulation of PRLR as is the case in the rat. In addition, it was shown in bovine 
growth hormone transgenic mice that 20-fold elevated levels of growth hormone with increased IGF-I levels 
did not induce tumour growth, whereas stimulation of PRLR without stimulation of GH or IGF-I did induce 
mammary tumours in these transgenic mice. These data indicate that in the rodent, proliferative and 
hypertrophic effects are caused through the PRLR.  
Regarding the carcinogenic potential of IGF-I, the applicant points out that although the concentration profile 
of IGF-I is different due the weekly dosing scheme of their product compared to daily hGH dosing,  the 
physiological IGF-I levels (Cmax, Cmin and AUC) of IGF-I remains within normal levels. Furthermore, from 
animal studies with IGF-I, it is clear that a tumour promoting effect is only evident at doses that result in 
higher than physiological IGF-I levels. Clinically, similar average levels of IGF-I are obtained in the pivotal 
phase 3 trial for somapacitan compared to daily GH treatment. In addition, the deviation between IGF-I 
response seems similar between the two treatments in this study. Furthermore, the difference in IGF-I 
response over time within a dosing interval does not seem to appear, and therefore upregulation of the IGF-I 
receptor seems unlikely. It is, therefore, agreed that the risk of tumour promotion by high peak levels of IGF-
I is rather low. 
In a female rat fertility study, somapacitan induced irregular oestrous cycles at all doses tested. In addition, 
number of copulation plugs and sperm count estimates from vaginal smears at mating were lower at all 
doses. However, these changes did not have any effect on mating performance, fertility, litter size mean 
numbers of implantations, resorptions and live embryos. Therefore, earlier described effects are not 
considered adverse in rats. These effects are likely PRL receptor-mediated. However, the clinical relevance of 
somapacitan induced disruption of the oestrus cycle is low. 
Regarding the rat EFD toxicity study, the Applicant could have performed more explorative research and 
provided a more broad discussion on the rationale of determining an optimal dosing schedule, taking into 
account the enhanced clearance of somapacitan after 4 days daily exposure in rat and information gathered 
from the long-term repeat-dose toxicity studies. However, based on the twice-weekly dosing in the 26-week 
repeat-dose toxicity study in rats, exposure was greatly decreased after 24 hours exposure. Taking into 
account this information, the four-day-window treatment schedule seems to be the most optimal for the EFD 
in rats. Although there is no continuous exposure to the embryos from implantation to closure of hard palate, 
possible somapacitan induced malformations, which are related to exposure at a certain stage of 
development, should be picked up with this approach. Growth related effects and maybe to a lesser extent 
embryo foetal death may be more difficult to pick up with this approach. However, exposure at the highest 
dose tested (18 mg/kg/day) was stable at first and fourth day of exposure for each treatment-window group. 
In addition, at the highest dose tested the exposure ratio was 130 fold MRHD exposure (which is above the 
25-fold exposure level as threshold of concern for EFD toxicity, as described in ICH S5R3).  
Assessment report  
EMA/95144/2021 
Page 39/129 
 
 
 
The treatment-related increase in postimplantation loss reported in the rabbit EFD toxicity study cannot be 
excluded. However, the exposure margin at the high dose in the rabbit EFD study is approximately 1400 fold 
exposure at MRHD and therefore, this finding is of limited concern for the human situation. 
Three different batches of somapacitan were tested in a one-month rat repeat-dose toxicity study to test for 
impurities and pharmacodynamic consistency. Batches tested were the batch used in pivotal non-clinical 
repeat-dose studies in rat, a batch with additional impurities (fatty acid loss) and an end of shelf life batch 
group consisting of two batches tested during the experiment. First end of shelf life batch was stored (to 
induce deamidation) and used for dosing in weeks 1, and 2 of this study and batch was stored (to induce 
high molecular weight proteins) and used for dosing in weeks 3 and 4. It is unknown why the Applicant 
tested two different batches in one treatment group. In addition, each of the end of life batches was only 
tested in serial for 2 weeks, whereas the comparator batch (the one used in pivotal studies) was tested for 
four weeks. The end of shelf life batches were taken into account to compare pharmacodynamic endpoints 
(body weight gain, IGF-I and insulin plasma levels) with the comparator batch. Although body weight gain 
was assessed throughout the study, IGF-I and insulin levels were only assessed at the start and end of the 
study. This testing paradigm was chosen due to limitations of product availability. Based on the toxicological 
profile of the different batches, there are no increased concerns from a toxicological point of view. However, 
repeat dose toxicity study 213245 was not adequately designed to make a statement on the efficacy of the 
EoSL batches. In addition, no conclusions can be drawn on the efficacy of the batch which was tested in the 
first two weeks of the study only, deamination), since IGF-I and insulin levels were not measured in this part 
of the study. Further, only limited conclusions on efficacy can be drawn from the second EoSL batch (high 
molecular weight proteins). It should be noted that although the data are not robust enough to be able to 
draw conclusions on efficacy, there was a slight difference in body weight gain of the animals between the 
different batches.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
From a non-clinical point of view, there are no points that need to be addressed at this stage. Therefore, 
currently, somapacitan is considered approvable from a non-clinical point of view.

GCP inspection  
GCP inspections (reference number GCP/2019/041) concerning study NN8640-4054 were conducted at an 
outpatient centre in Hyderabad (India; site 1), a clinical research unit in Melbourne (Australia; site 2), and at 
the Sponsor site in Bangalore (India; site 3). The inspections at the three sites mentioned above were routine 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) inspections. The purpose of the inspections was to verify whether study 4054 
was conducted in compliance with GCP and applicable regulations, in particular where it has an impact on the 
validity of the data or the ethical conduct of the study.  
Inspection findings 
The most important findings are described below. 
The inspectors stated that the regional and local offices of the sponsor had a high level of autonomy or 
independence (e.g. with respect to documents and forms to be provided, but also on monitoring and direct-
line interactions with sites/principal investigators concerning questions and issues). According to the 
inspectors, the actual structural organisation of the sponsor resulted in a non-uniform conduct of the study at 
different sites. The management of the study by the sponsor in practice, including monitoring, did not result 
in adequate sponsor oversight and control over global study issues and collected data. As a consequence, 
many of the reported inspection findings are relevant for the full study. 
According to the inspectors, the source data (e.g. DXA scans) were not or not adequately archived for a 
substantial number of the investigator sites. For at least two sites in India, most of these source data were 
permanently lost due to a computer issue. In view of the inspectors, these source data are likely retrievable 
for most sites. Therefore, according to the inspectors these serious issues are not considered to have a 
significant impact on the final reliability of the reported data. 
The critical finding reported in relation to the ethical conduct (study specific constraints for (potential) 
trial participants before having signed the informed consent form), which, again, is a very serious issue in 
need of adequate remedy, is also not considered to have a significant impact on final reliability of the 
reported data. 
Conclusion inspectors 
According to the inspectors, the reported critical and major findings do reflect serious shortcomings to, non-
compliances with and violations of ICH GCP requirements. As such, they did affect or could have affected the 
rights, well-being and safety of the participants as well as the quality and integrity of the data.  
Interpretability of study data of study 4054 
According to the inspectors, obtained study data may be used despite the lack of sponsor oversight and 
adequate quality assessment and quality control. This is because of the set-up of the study (primary efficacy 
parameter and several secondary efficacy parameters calculated by a third party, based on the DXA scans 
provided), the fact that only a very limited number of serious adverse events occurred, and a number of 
crucial processes went well. The inspectors could still support a decision by the assessors to use the clinical 
trial data reported in the evaluation process of this centralised procedure.  
Discussion on GCP inspection findings 
Taking into account the inspection findings, study 4054 does not meet current GCP requirements. However, 
the inspectors did not report data manipulation. Instead, the inspectors indicated that the clinical study data 
may still be interpreted.

Because of this, the results of the study 4054 will be summarised and interpreted below with 
acknowledgement of the GCP inspection findings.  
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The completed somapacitan clinical development programme in AGHD is comprised of 8 clinical trials 
consisting of 5 clinical pharmacology trials, 1 confirmatory phase 3 trial, and 2 supportive phase 3 trials. In 
addition, pharmacokinetic data were included in a population pharmacokinetic analyses.  
Analytical methods: 
For the analysis of somapacitan in human serum, a specific LOCI assay was applied. The method proved to 
be sensitive and robust for analysis of somapacitan. Validation results showed acceptable performance within 
the normal standard criteria. In addition, somapacitan is stable in plasma during a sufficiently long period. 
Incurred sample reanalysis data were presented for study 3915 (healthy subjects), study 3947 and 4244 
(AGHD patients), study 4297 (patients with various degrees of renal impairment) and study 4298 (patients 
with hepatic impairment), showing that the method was reproducible. 
For the analysis of somatropin in human serum 2 validated analytical methods were applied, i.e., an ELISA 
and a CLIA. The methods proved to be sensitive and robust for analysis of somatropin. Validation results 
showed acceptable performance within the normal standard criteria. In addition, somatropin is stable in 
plasma during a sufficiently long period. It was indicated that for the CLIA selectivity was not validated. 
Different validated methods were carried out at Novo Nordisk and an additional site, and cross-validation 
showed that both methods gave comparable results. Incurred sample reanalysis data were presented for the 
ELISA in study 4054 (AGHD patients), and CLIA in study 3947 (AGHD patients), showing that the method 
was reproducible.  
For the analysis of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 commercial available kits have been applied. The kits have been 
validated, showing acceptable accuracy, precision, dilution linearity, and parallelism. Moreover, the 
reproducibility of the method was shown by incurred sample reanalysis. 
The anti somapacitan antibody bridging ELISA screening assay was validated for human serum samples. 
(from healthy subjects and growth hormone deficient patients) The validation data shows that the assay is fit 
for purpose of measuring anti somapacitan antibodies in human subjects after treatment with somapacitan. 
Based on the validation results, the cell-based in vitro neutralising assay is considered appropriate. This was 
further supported by the very low assay variability (≤10% CV). 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis: 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis was carried out to describe the release characteristics of somapacitan 
after s.c. administration. A one-compartment model with dual first and zero-order absorption through a 
transit compartment, and with saturable elimination was used to describe the somapacitan PK. Goodness-of-
fit plots of the final model for somapacitan against the population model prediction and individual model 
prediction showing a normal random scatter around the identity line and indicated the absence of significant 
bias. The pcVPC demonstrates that the final model adequately described the time course of somapacitan 
plasma concentrations and its associated variability after s.c. dosing. Between categories of sex, race and 
age groups, body weight appeared to be correlated to all three covariate categories. Overall, the popPK 
model performed well.  
PK/PD analysis: 
Assessment report  
EMA/95144/2021 
Page 45/129 
 
 
 
For the PK/PD model of the effect of somapacitan on IGF-I, PK/PD was described using an indirect response 
model. The model used an error model consisting of an additional and proportional error. Goodness-of-fit 
plots of the final model showed a normal random scatter around the identity line and indicated the absence of 
significant bias. Furthermore, the pcVPC demonstrates that the final model adequately described the time 
course of somapacitan effect on IGF-I plasma concentrations and its associated variability after s.c. dosing.  
Absorption  
A freeze-dried formulation (6.7 mg/vial) and a liquid formulation (10 mg/1.5 ml) were used in the clinical 
development of somapacitan. The performed exposure comparison between the freeze-dried formulation and 
liquid formulation indicates that steady-state exposure (AUC0-168h and to some degree Cmax) is higher in the 
trials using the freeze-dried formulation (trials 3915, 3947) compared to the trials using the liquid 
formulation (trials 4297, 4298). These differences may be attributed to the proportion of females in the trial 
populations. 
Both somapacitan pen-injectors, used in clinical trials and to-be-marketed, are identical in all functional 
parts. They also are functionally identical to Norditropin-FlexPro pen-injector whereas device constituent of 
Norditropin NordiFlex is an earlier device design. 
After s.c. administration tmax values are observed after about 8 - 20h. Injections sites were abdomen and 
thigh, and the influence of the injection site was not specifically evaluated. In the Phase III studies, both 
injection sites were used. For growth hormone, it was reported that absorption is not influenced due to a 
different injection site. Additional, in the popPK analysis, the injection site was not identified as a significant 
covariate. 
A more than dose proportional increase in AUC and Cmax is observed over the dose range of 0.01 – 0.32 
mg/kg (about 0.7 – 25 mg/week). This may suggest saturable elimination mechanisms, e.g. receptor 
mediated clearance. At doses in the more clinically relevant range, i.e. below 0.08 mg/kg (about 6 – 7 
mg/week) linear pharmacokinetics are observed for AUC; however, Cmax increased still more than dose-
proportional (factor 3.5 after doubling the dose at multiple dosing).  
To be noted, after the first dose, the somapacitan dose is titrated based upon the clinical response, so 
possible non-linear pharmacokinetics are considered less relevant. Dosing in mg/week without taking body 
weight into consideration, followed by individual dose adjustment/titration based on IGF-I SDS and clinical 
response is considered appropriate.  
No unexpected accumulation is observed after applying the SmPC recommended dose scheme. Steady-state 
was estimated to be reached after 1 – 2 doses, with a low accumulation ratio (<2). Within the dose ranges 
evaluated, there is no evidence of a dose- and time-dependent PK of somapacitan. 
A high intersubject variability is observed in AGHD patients at steady state, ranging from about 62 - 102% 
for AUC0-168h and from 113 – 201% in Cmax. PopPK simulations confirmed the moderate to high inter-subject 
variability (estimated 64%). Exclusion of the co-variates decreased inter-subject variability to about 44%. 
The covariates body weight, sex and oral oestrogen use, race and age, which were included in the popPK 
modelling, explained 78% of the observed inter-subject variability. This high variability is thus less relevant 
after dosing, when the specific subject is dosed and titrated, including the different covariates between the 
subjects. 
Assessment report  
EMA/95144/2021 
Page 46/129 
 
 
 
Pharmacokinetics were in general comparable between healthy subjects and AGHD patients (reference 0.08 
mg/kg dose level). PopPK modelling indicated that in the fixed-dose periods after titration, the mean 
somapacin dose was 2.4 mg/week, the estimated geometric mean Cavg was 2.7 ng/ml, the geometric mean 
Cmax was 7.4 ng/ml, the tmax was 5.8 h, the approximate half-life 69.2 h and the accumulation ratio (Racc) 
was 1.23. The estimated AUC0-168h was 448 ng.h/ml. 
Delayed and missed doses: 
Delaying a dose or missing a dose will result in decreased somapacitan plasma levels. IGF-I levels showed 
the same pattern. Delaying a dose by 3 days and the next dose is administered as scheduled, resulting in 
further lower somapacitan plasma levels during the 3 days of delay, slightly decreased peak concentration 
after next normal scheduled dose and higher trough concentrations after this dose, compared to normal 
dosing. Two weeks after the delayed dose, the concentrations will be completely restored. 
After missing a dose, the concentration of somapacitan will decrease till the next scheduled dose but is 
expected to be completely restored 2 weeks after the missed dose.  
IGF-I levels following the same pattern (see further Pharmacodynamics for dose recommendation). 
Bioavailability/bioequivalence: 
A freeze-dried powder and a liquid formulation were used in the clinical studies. Considering the formulation 
is a solution for subcutaneously (s.c.) injection and taking into account the comparability in excipients and 
that the albumin binding moiety is controlling the release, a difference in bioavailability between the different 
formulations used is not expected. This is also shown by an inter-study comparison of pharmacokinetics 
obtained with the freeze-dried powder formulation and the liquid formulation, showing comparable 
pharmacokinetics. 
Distribution 
Somapacitan is highly bound to albumin (>99%) and slowly release from albumin. The popPK model 
(incorporating rate-limiting absorption) estimated a volume of distribution of 14.6 l, which would be in line 
with the volume of distribution of albumin (13.6 l). 
Elimination 
Metabolism:  
After injection, somapacitan is considered metabolised by proteolytic cleavages of the peptide backbone and 
sequential degradation of the linker sequence. This resulted in 3 main plasma metabolites (named P1, M1 
and M1B) and two main urine metabolites (named M4 and M5). Intact somapacitan accounted for 59% of the 
total exposure of somapacitan-related material in plasma, and P1 accounted for 21% and M1 and M1B 
accounted for 12%. The remaining plasma metabolites accounted for <10% of the total AUC exposure. 
After administration of [3H]-somapacitan, 94% of the administered dose was recovered 28 days after dosing, 
of which 80.9% was excreted in urine (wet samples), 12.9% was excreted in faeces (wet samples) and 
0.19% was excreted in expired air. No intact somapacitan was recovered in urine and faces. 
Assessment report  
EMA/95144/2021 
Page 47/129 
 
 
 
 
 
Elimination:  
At steady state, the elimination half-life of somapacitan in AGHD patients ranged from 49 – 76h. Based on 
modelling analyses, the terminal half-life was estimated to be 69.2h. More than 80% of somapacitan in the 
circulation was eliminated within 7 days after dosing at steady-state. The CL/F at steady state ranged from 
0.021 to 0.039 l/h/kg with high variability (CV of 62.0 to 99.9%). 
With the SPC recommended dosing scheme, somapacitan steady-state exposure is reached after 1 – 2 
injections, with limited further accumulation. 
The applicant indicated that a subset of patients might not have reached the optimal dose and effect. Using 
data from study 4054, and applying population PK/PD modelling, based upon exposure-response data it was 
predicted that a total of 90% of the population reached, or would likely be able to reach, an IGF-I SDS above 
0 within the proposed dose range (up to 8 mg) and based on continued titration towards and IGF-I SDS level 
of 0 to +2. 
Furthermore, a post-hoc exposure-response analysis was conducted in order to test the hypothesis that all 
available exposure-response data in study 4054 were consistent with a similar maximum effect of 
somapacitan and somatropin, and in order to identify the EC50 for somapacitan and somatropin, i.e. the 
steepest part of the direct exposure-response relationship to truncal fat percentage. A combined model was 
fitted to all available exposure-response data in trial 4054. The model described the change in truncal fat 
percentage with a linear relationship to IGF-I average SDS (indirect effect) and Emax relationships to 
exposure of somapacitan/somatropin (direct effects). The analysis indicated that the estimated EC50 for 
somatropin was 0.30 ng/ml, equivalent to the mean exposure observed in the main treatment phase of study 
4054 (Figure 4). The estimated EC50 for somapacitan was 7.76 ng/ml equivalent to the exposures in the 
upper end of the observed range in the main treatment phase of study 4054. This may indicate that a higher 
response may be expected by increasing the somapacitan dose, however, this could not be supported by 
clinical data (see further sections Clinical efficacy, Dose-response studies and main clinical studies).

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Special populations 
Exposures in special patient groups were based upon pharmacokinetic data and popPK analysis.  
Based upon the existing model, body weight had an impact on exposure with exposure being higher in a 
subject with a low body weight of 45 kg (3.12-fold) and lower in a heavy subject weighing 115 kg (-39%) as 
compared to the reference subject weighing 85 kg. As exposure was inversely related to body weight, a 
dose-normalized to body weight posology would be more adequate. However, it appeared that dosing steps 
in mg resulted in similar IGF-I levels after titration in all body weight groups, indicating that normalisation to 
body weight is not required to reach IGF-I target level. Indeed, the correlation between exposure and body 
weight is not a directly proportional function, and there is substantial variability not related to body weight. 
Apart from the relationship between somapacitan dose and exposure, the relationship between somapacitan 
dose and the IGF-I response is also considered: while exposure is inversely related to body weight, the 
opposite relationship exists between body weight and IGF-I. To evaluate if dosing steps in mg is appropriate 
for titration to IGF-I target levels, IGF-I levels after titration were compared across body weights. Overall 
similar IGF-I levels were obtained after titration in all body weight groups, suggesting that normalisation to 
body weight is not required to reach IGF-I target level. It is thus considered that dosing in mg/week without 
taking body weight into consideration, followed by individual dose adjustment/titration based on IGF-I SDS 
and clinical response is appropriate.

No significant or relevant changes in parameters related to weight, gender and race were found between the 
original PK/PD model and the updated PK/PD model. Neither patients with childhood or adulthood GHD onset, 
transition age patients (18-25 years), patients by BMI range (<25 kg/m², 25-35 kg/m², 35-40 kg/m² and > 
40 kg/m²) or patients with diabetes were significant covariates at p<0.01 in the population PK and PK/PD 
models, meaning that no significant impact on dose-response relationships was found when accounting for 
correlation to factors that were significant in the models (i.e. gender, age, race and body weight). 
Age below 25 years was tested as a covariate in the PK and PK/PD models but was not identified as 
significant in either model. Data indicated no increased risk of bone or cardiac disorders in this subpopulation 
based on 48 patients in transition age (from 18 to 25 years old), including 41 patients treated by 
somapacitan.  
AGHD Patients in the transition age received higher doses but obtained lower IGF-I levels after titration than 
older AGHD patients. This could indicate that AGHD patients in the transition age may need higher doses 
than AGHD patients outside the transition age and is in accordance with the fact that endogenous growth 
hormone secretion and IGF-I levels are much higher in healthy subjects in this age group as compared to 
older subjects. 
Female subject using no oestrogens has a 30% lower exposure compared to male subjects, while females 
subjects on oestrogens had a 53% lower exposure. The IGF-I response was lower in females compared to 
males and lowest in females on oral oestrogen for similar doses of somapacitan (see Pharmacodynamics). 
Females and especially females on oral oestrogen may thus require higher doses of somapacitan to reach a 
similar IGF-I target range as compared to males. 
Subjects aged ≥65 years had a 35% higher somapacitan exposure compared to subjects aged 18 – 64 years. 
The IGF-I response was slightly higher in the older subjects (see section Pharmacodynamics) and slightly 
lower doses may be needed to reach the IGF-I target in elderly compared to younger patients. 
Somapacitan exposure was 18% higher in Japanese and 33% lower in Asian non-Japanese compared to 
White subjects. However, the IGF-I response was comparable across the race groups (see section 
Pharmacodynamics) and similar doses are needed to reach the IGF-I. 
A mild, moderate, severe renal impairment and patients requiring haemodialysis increased exposure by 25, 
27, 75 and 63%, respectively. In line with the increase in somapacitan exposure, IGF-I levels were also 
increased. This is in line with published data indicating decreased clearance of GH due to renal impairment. 
In line with the increase in somapacitan exposure, IGF-I levels were also increased (up to 40%). However, as 
the dose of somapacitan is individually titrated based on safety and efficacy and IGF-I levels, specific 
recommendations for dosing are not considered necessary (see below clinical assessment). 
Somapacitan AUC0-168h was not influenced by a mild hepatic impairment (+9%), while a moderate hepatic 
impairment increased the AUC0-168h by 3.69-fold. Lower levels of IGF-I were observed in subjects with mild 
and moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function (see section 2.2.4). The 
cause of this is most likely the known GH-resistance for subjects with hepatic disease. Although higher 
somapacitan doses are needed to obtain an adequate treatment response as compared to subjects with 
normal hepatic function, as the dose of somapacitan is individually titrated based on safety and and efficacy 
and IGF-I levels, specific recommendations for dosing are not considered necessary (see below clinical 
assessment). However, as no data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment and a more 
pronounced effect may be expected, caution should be exercised when treating patients with severe hepatic 
impairment, as recommended in the SmPC (section 4.2).

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Considering the similarity of somapacitan with GH, the drug-drug interaction potential is expected to be 
similar to other marketed GH products and it is considered acceptable that drug-drug interaction section of 
the proposed label is brought in line with the clinically important drug interactions of somatropin (see further 
Pharmacodynamics). 
Overall the pharmacokinetics have been sufficiently evaluated. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Somapacitan is a recombinant human GH derivative through the binding on the endogenous albumin this GH 
gets long-acting properties. As for human somatropin, the mechanism of action of somapacitan is either 
directly via binding to the GH receptor or indirectly via insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). The IGF-I standard 
deviation score (SDS) is defined based on a healthy reference population, who will per definition have around 
2.5% of IGF-I measurements above +2 SDS.12  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Under physiological conditions, GH is secreted episodically in a pulsatile fashion during a 24-hour period, with 
the main GH peaks occurring during sleep. The timing and magnitude of GH secretion are impacted by 
gender, activity, nutritional status, age and visceral adiposity.13  
Current daily replacement therapies mimic neither the pulsatility nor the circadian pattern of endogenous 
GH. The GH profile of standard daily GH replacement therapy (somatropin) varies over 24 hours after dosing 
(Figure 5A). Once-weekly somapacitan dosing provides an initial peak exposure on day 1 that gradually 
decreases over the 7 days post-administration. The higher magnitude of exposure for somapacitan should be 
viewed in the context of the lower receptor binding affinity (3 to 4 times), pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamics properties of weekly somapacitan as compared to daily somatropin, allowing once-weekly 
dosing.  
Furthermore, somapacitan and somatropin produce different IGF-I profiles (Figure 5B). Once-weekly 
somapacitan has an IGF-I maximum (Cmax) occurring 32−72 hours after dosing with IGF-I values within the 
normal range, whereas for daily GH replacement therapy IGF-I levels remain relatively constant at steady 
state.

Individual dose titration based on IGF-I SDS levels is important to assure that IGF-I levels are maintained 
within the upper normal range (0 to +2 SDS), following current clinical practice in AGHD.14,15 Multiple dosing 
of somapacitan in patients with AGHD resulted in IGF-I SDS responses above baseline at all investigated dose 
levels of somapacitan (0.02, 0.04, 0.08, 0.12 mg/kg) (Figure 6). Furthermore, the IGF-I response increased 
with increasing doses of somapacitan at steady state, with mean AUC0-168h of 25842, 28839, 39097 and 
77808 ng·h/l, respectively.

Figure 6 IGF-I SDS levels after different dose levels of somatropin (0.004 mg/kg) and 
somapacitan (0.02, 0.04, 0.08, 0.12 mg/kg)(study 3947) 
The somapacitan-induced IGF-I SDS levels were sustained during the weekly dosing interval.  
In patients with AGHD, the mean maximum IGF-I SDS response appeared within 2−4 days (tmax) after 
somapacitan dosing which was delayed compared to the median time of maximal somapacitan exposure of 
approximately 24 hours (1 day) after dose administration.  
There was no statistically significant difference on AUC0-168h and Cmax between daily somatropin 
(0.004 mg/kg/day ≈ 0.03 mg/kg/week) and once-weekly somapacitan (0.02 and 0.04 mg/kg/week).  
Weekly dosing resulted in an undulating steady-state IGF-I response. Steady-state was reached after 1−2 
once-weekly doses of somapacitan.  
As expected IGFBP3 followed the IGF-I pattern observed after the exposition of somapacitan although the 
response was somewhat muted. 
Association between dosing, IGF-I SDS, and clinical effects 
Somapacitan like somatropin is dosed to achieve IGF-I SDS levels within the IGF-I SDS target range. In 
pivotal study 4054, similar IGF-I levels were obtained with somapacitan and somatropin, as supported by the 
superimposable distribution of IGF-I SDS levels at week 34 (Figure 7). Similar IGF-I SDS ranges will induce 
similar IGF-I mediated indirect clinical effects of growth hormone via the liver apart from the direct clinical 
effects of growth hormone replacement treatment on fat masses.

Based on the IGF-I SDS distribution data, it is reasonable to predict that IGF-I mediated effects (‘indirect’ 
effects of growth hormone) would be comparable for somapacitan and somatropin.  
Somapacitan and somatropin exert direct effects on fat cells. In pivotal study 4054 observed direct effects 
tended to be lower for somapacitan as compared somatropin treatment. Several factors may explain these 
differences, such as differences in the AGHD study population which reflects differences in sensitivity to the 
effects of growth hormone between AGHD patients, insufficient exposure of somapacitan, and a lower affinity 
to adipose tissue for somapacitan as compared to somatropin due to the albumin binding moiety in 
somapacitan16. In addition, differential effects of somapacitan on different adipose tissues may partly be 
explained by different expression of the IGF-I receptor and growth hormone receptor in different adipose 
tissues.  
Some observations which indicate differences in the pharmacodynamic effects of somapacitan and 
somatropin, and differences in the pharmacodynamic effects of somapacitan in particular AGHD subgroups 
are stated below. 
In the same AGHD subgroup, dosing of weekly somapacitan should be about 1.14 times higher than the total 
dose of somatropin per week to achieve similar IGF-I SDS levels. 
Defined IGF-I SDS target ranges were not achieved in 22% of somapacitan-treated study patients in pivotal 
clinical study 4054, and in 20% of Japanese AGHD study patients in study 4244 who had been treated with 
growth hormone prior to participation in the respective study (Table 3). In both studies these proportions 
tended to be higher in particular subgroups, such as women on oral oestrogen treatment, and study patients 
with childhood-onset growth hormone deficiency (respectively 42% and 34% of the study patients in these 
subgroups in main phase study 4054).

Table 3 Proportion of somapacitan-treated patients not reaching IGF-I SDS targets (studies 4054 
and 4244) 
It is well-known that particular subgroups of AGHD patients are less sensitive to growth hormone treatment 
such as women and women on oral oestrogen therapy compared to men and childhood-onset AGHD patients 
(e.g. see Figure 8).17,18,19  As indicated with respect to the post-hoc exposure-response analysis in the 
pharmacokinetics section, increased somapacitan dosing is likely to induce a higher clinical response. 
Considering this exposure-response relationship and differences in growth hormone sensitivity between 
AGHD subgroups, somapacitan dosing should be adapted for particular subgroups. 
Observed clinical effects of somapacitan and other study treatments in different subsets of study patients are 
discussed in the clinical efficacy and clinical safety sections below.

Potential safety risks of weekly somapacitan dosing 
Although it is reassuring that no difference in AUC between somapacitan and somatropin can be observed, 
concerns related to the undulating IGF-I pattern with apparent higher Cmax and lower Cthrough remain. Such 
weekly IGF-I pattern is not known from physiological nor pharmaceutical conditions, therefore, the 
consequences for safety and efficacy are not well understood. In the somapacitan clinical development 
program, the safety profile of somapacitan was consistent with currently approved daily growth hormone 
replacement therapies. There was no indication that AGHD patients treated with somapacitan compared to 
those treated with somatropin were at increased risk of cardiovascular events, hyperglycaemia, or neoplasia.  
Long-term safety risks of somapacitan beyond a treatment period of 1.5 years are yet unclear. These will be 
evaluated in a proposed post-authorization safety study (PASS). 
Missed doses 
Systemic  somapacitan  concentrations  rise  soon  after  subcutaneous  administration.  Subsequently,  these 
concentrations decrease progressively to zero in about 2-3 weeks (Figure 9).  
After one week after administration of a somapacitan dose, the next somapacitan dose is to be administered. 
However, AGHD patients may miss one or more somapacitan doses for different reasons in clinical practice.  
Simulated somapacitan concentrations and IGF-I SDSs in case of no, one, two, and three missed doses are 
presented in Figure 9.  
If one somapacitan dose is missed, this dose may be administered up to three days after the planned dosing 
day. A subsequent somapacitan dose may then be administered on the planned dosing day. 
If a longer time has passed from the planned dosing day of one missed somapacitan dose, or if two or more 
somapacitan doses have been missed, somapacitan dosing should be resumed as before the doses were missed.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
There was no statistically significant difference on AUC0-168h and Cmax between daily somatropin 
(0.004 mg/kg/day ≈ 0.03 mg/kg/week) and once-weekly somapacitan (0.02 and 0.04 mg/kg/week).  
Somapacitan and somatropin exert direct effects on adipose tissue and indirect effects on other tissues via 
stimulation of IGF-I expression and release from the liver.20  
A steady-state IGF-I response was reached after 1−2 once-weekly doses of somapacitan. This weekly 
undulating pattern is non-physiologic. In normal physiology and after daily somatropin injections, a stable 
IGF-I level is observed.  
The somapacitan induced IGF-I levels displayed a greater peak to trough variation over the one-week dosing 
interval compared to daily somatropin. Dosing of weekly somapacitan should be about 1.14 times higher than 
the total dose of somatropin per week to achieve similar IGF-I SDS levels in the same subgroup of AGHD 
patients.  
Similar IGF-I SDS levels may induce similar clinical effects in similar AGHD subgroups. It is, however, well 
known that several AGHD subgroups such as women on oral oestrogen treatment, and study patients with 
childhood-onset growth hormone deficiency are less sensitive to growth hormone treatment. Exposure-
response data indicate that larger pharmacodynamic effects of somapacitan may be observed if higher 
somapacitan doses would be provided to AGHD patients. Similar effects of somapacitan and somatropin could 
be obtained at a higher exposure of somapacitan as compared to somatropin. Hence, somapacitan dosing 
regimen should be adapted for particular AGHD subgroups. 
Clinical safety within the somapacitan clinical development program was comparable for weekly somapacitan 
and daily somatropin. However, long-term safety risks of somapacitan beyond a treatment period of 1.5 
years are yet unclear and remain of concern. These risks will be evaluated in a post-authorization safety 
study (PASS).

If one somapacitan dose is missed, this dose may be administered up to three days after the planned dosing 
day. A subsequent somapacitan dose may then be administered on the planned dosing day. 
If a longer time has passed from the planned dosing day of one missed somapacitan dose, or if two or more 
somapacitan doses have been missed, somapacitan dosing should be resumed as before the doses were missed.  
Secondary pharmacodynamics were not reported in the pharmacodynamic studies. However, these 
parameters (mainly glucose homeostasis) are elaborately discussed in the safety section of this report (see 
below). 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The peak to trough variation of IGF-I in a once weekly dosing interval of somapacitan is of concern since 
long-term safety risks are unknown. These risks will be evaluated in a PASS.  
Dosing of weekly somapacitan should be about 1.14 times higher than the total dose of somatropin per week 
to achieve similar IGF-I SDS levels in the same subgroup of AGHD patients.  
Similar IGF-I SDS levels may induce similar clinical effects in similar AGHD subgroups. Exposure-response 
data indicate that larger pharmacodynamic effects may be observed, if higher somapacitan doses would be 
provided to AGHD patients. As some subsets of AGHD patients such as women, women on oral oestrogen 
therapy, and childhood-onset AGHD patients are less sensitive to growth hormone treatment, the 
somapacitan dosing regimen should be adjusted for these AGHD subgroups. For AGHD patients in the 
transition age, higher doses are also needed. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Conducted dose-response studies are discussed above.  
According to proposed SmPC, somapacitan is dosed and titrated individually for each patient in order to 
achieve IGF-I levels between -0.5 and +2 standard deviation scores of normal. 
2.5.2.  Main study(ies) 
Study 4054 
Methods 
The main study of this application is study 4054. This study was a multicentre, multinational, randomized, 
parallel-group, placebo-controlled (double-blind) and active-controlled (open-label) study. The study was 
primarily designed to compare in a double-blind study setting the efficacy and safety of once-weekly dosing 
of somapacitan with once-weekly dosing of placebo in AGHD patients who were growth hormone treatment-
naïve or with no exposure to growth hormone or growth hormone secretagogues for at least 180 days prior 
to randomization. In a third, open-label study arm, the clinical effects of open-label daily treatment with 
somatropin product Norditropin were evaluated.

The study design is presented in Figure 10. The study consisted of the following periods: 
• 
• 
2-week screening period 
35-week randomized, double-blind main period consisting of: 
-  8-week titration period,  
-  26-week fixed-dose treatment period,  
-  1-week washout period 
• 
53-week open-label extension period consisting of:  
-  8-week titration period, 
-  44 week fixed-dose treatment period, 
-  1-week washout period. 
Hence, the patients were treated for 34 weeks in the main period and 52 weeks in the extension period, thus 
for a total of 86 weeks. 
The washout periods were set to 1 week to confirm antibody response. Last efficacy measurements of the 
main treatment period were obtained at the end of the 34-week treatment period. The half-life of daily 
somatropin is 2.6 hours. In the extension treatment period, study patients were re-randomized to active 
study treatment with the same or longer interval between subsequent doses as in the main treatment period. 
Clinical evaluations in the extension treatment period were conducted after an 8-week titration period. It is 
not expected that a one-week washout period will influence the clinical results of the extension treatment 
period.

b Exceptions to this criterion include patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus provided that all of the 
following criteria are met: diabetes mellitus ≥ 6 months prior to screening; stable oral anti-diabetic 
treatment; no history of use of injectable anti-diabetic agents; HbA1c < 7.0% at screening; no diabetes-
related co-morbidities at screening; no proliferative retinopathy or severe non-proliferative diabetic 
retinopathy. Patients with diabetes mellitus enrolled at Japanese sites were not allowed to participate in the 
studies as diabetes mellitus is a contraindication for GH treatment in Japan.  
Main exclusion criteria 
•  active malignant disease or history of malignancy 
Exceptions to this exclusion criterion included:  
-  Resected in  situ  carcinoma  of  the  cervix  and  squamous  cell  or basal  cell  carcinoma of  the  skin  with

- 
Patients with growth hormone deficiency attributed to the treatment of intracranial malignant tumours 
of leukaemia provided that a recurrence-free survival period of at least 5 years is documented in the 
patient’s medical records.  
It is noted that study patients were diagnosed in line with diagnostic criteria for AGHD in international 
consensus guidelines21. It is also noted that the selection criteria for study participation were different in 
Japan compared to the rest of the world. The applicant analyzed the primary endpoint separately for Japan 
and the rest of the world (see below). As this procedure concerns an EU marketing authorization application 
the results obtained in the Japanese population are not discussed in depth in this report.  
Since AGHD patients up to 79 years were included, clinical effects in AGHD patients aged 80 years and above 
have not been evaluated in study 4054. 
Treatments 
Main treatment phase 
Somapacitan and placebo were administered subcutaneously once weekly.  
Somatropin product Norditropin FlexPro was administered subcutaneously once daily. 
Starting doses 
The starting doses for both active substances are summarized in Table 4. Starting doses expressed in mg per 
week of somapacitan and somatropin were similar. Chosen starting doses of somatropin (0.7 -2.1 mg/week) 
fall within the dose ranges which have been accepted in treatment guidelines22 and are also in line with the 
SmPC of the somatropin product Norditropin (0.7- 3.5 mg/week).  
The starting doses of somapacitan were tested to be safe in the completed clinical study NN8640-3947 
(multiple-dose in AGHD patients, phase 1).

Dose adjustments in the titration period 
Dose adjustments were allowed during the first 8 weeks titration period (at week 2, 4, 6 and 8). Dose 
adjustments were based on IGF-I SDS. After last dose adjustment (if any) in the main study at week 8, the 
individual dose level was fixed.  
Blood samples for IGF-I, IGFBP-3 and PK were taken 10-11 days after the previous dose adjustment visit. 
Hence, dose adjustments were performed about 4 days after the IGF-I titration samples were collected. 
Besides the IGF-I based dose adjustment during the titration period, dose reduction could be considered 
during the entire study period at the investigator’s discretion for safety concerns. If adverse events with a 
probable relationship to study treatment were persistent but continuation in the study was acceptable, as 
judged by the investigator and patient, dose reduction in steps of 25% could be considered. 
Dose adjustments were handled according to the below dose-titration algorithms for somapacitan and 
somatropin (Table 5). It was aimed to achieve IGF-I SDS levels in the physiological range of -0.5 up to +1.75 
standard deviation scores (SDS). The size of the dose adjustments during the titration period was derived 
based on PK/PD analysis of data from previous clinical studies with somapacitan.

For somapacitan, the minimum and maximum weekly doses were set to 0.1 mg and 8 mg, respectively. For 
daily somatropin, the minimum and the maximum daily doses were set to 0.05 mg and 1.1 mg.  
Titration of placebo subjects mirrored the titration of somapacitan subjects to avoid unblinding. The subjects 
in the placebo group also received instructions on dose adjustment to mimic a pattern of dose adjustment in 
the subjects receiving somapacitan. 
The dose titration schedule in the protocol was to be followed in order to allow titration to an optimal 
therapeutic dose for all subjects. If a subject had not completed at least 3 dose adjustment evaluations, this 
was considered a protocol deviation, as fewer than 3 completed dose adjustment evaluations were not 
expected to be sufficient to achieve therapeutic doses in a majority of subjects. 
When the main period ended, the dose titration was repeated for all patients who continued into the 
extension period following the same dose titration scheme. This ensured that patients on once-weekly 
somapacitan in the extension period were kept blinded to whether they received placebo or active treatment 
in the main period. 
Method of administration 
Somapacitan and placebo patients injected themselves once-weekly s.c. with a pre-filled pen in the morning.  
Somatropin patients injected themselves daily s.c. in the evening with a pre-filled pen (standard treatment 
practice), except during observed study treatment administration (where injections were done in the morning 
(at least 12 hours after injection the evening before). The evening before blood sampling for anti-hGH 
antibodies the injections should occur at least 12 hours prior to sampling. 
Injections were done in the thighs and/or abdomen alternating within these body areas for every injection. 
Extension treatment phase 
All patients who completed the 35-week main study period continued the treatment in the 53-week extension 
period as below: 
•  Somapacitan treated patients continued their once-weekly treatment. 
•  Somatropin treated patients were re-randomized 1:1 to somapacitan or somatropin within the same 
strata as used for the first randomization. 
•  Placebo patients were switched to somapacitan treatment. 
Dose titration was repeated for all patients during the first 8 weeks of the extension period as described 
above for the main study period. 
For the extension period, the last dose was administered by the patient at home during week 86. 
Objectives 
Primary objective 
Assessment report

To demonstrate the efficacy of once-weekly dosing of somapacitan compared to placebo after 34 weeks of 
treatment in AGHD patients. 
Secondary objective related to efficacy 
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of somapacitan for up to 86 weeks of treatment in AGHD patients (i.e. 
during the main and extension periods of the study). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
An overview of pharmacodynamic and efficacy endpoints of study 4054 is presented in Table 6. These 
endpoints concern well-known evaluations of general disease characteristics and treatment effects in AGHD 
patients.23,24,25,26,27 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in truncal fat percentage at the end of the main treatment 
period (week 34) compared to baseline.  
The secondary efficacy endpoints included body composition measurements (e.g. fat, lean body mass and 
bone mineral content).

Treatment compliance was assessed by recording of doses (date and time of each dose as well as any missed 
doses), comparing the prescribed and actual doses, adherence and drug accountability. Treatment 
compliance was further evaluated based on time stamps from ecaps throughout the extension period of the 
study. 
Sample size 
The  sample  size  calculation  was  based  on  the  assumptions  of  a  true  mean  difference  of  2.5%  between 
somapacitan and placebo and a SD of 4.5% for the primary endpoint, and a 2-sided, 2-sample t-test with a 
significance  level  of  5%  and  a  2:1  randomisation  ratio  between  somapacitan  and  placebo.  A  total  of  104 
subjects in the somapacitan group and 52 subjects in the placebo group completing the main trial should ensure 
90% power for detecting a difference between somapacitan and placebo. 
As a secondary comparison, the treatment difference at week 34 between somapacitan and Norditropin was 
estimated  and  the  corresponding  95%  CI  was  calculated.  This  secondary  comparison  of  somapacitan  with 
Norditropin  was  used  to  assist  the  clinical  judgment  of  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  estimated  treatment 
difference  (ETD)  between  somapacitan  and  placebo.  In  this  secondary  comparison  of  the  primary  endpoint, 
including 104 subjects in the Norditropin group it was expected with probability 0.87 that half the length of the 
95%  confidence  interval  constructed  for  the  difference  between  somapacitan and  Norditropin  to  be  at most 
1.3%, resulting in a total of 260 subjects to be included in the trial (without adjustment for withdrawals). 
Randomisation 
Eligible study patients were randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to receive either once-weekly somapacitan, a daily 
somatropin or once-weekly placebo.  
A study-specific, web-based randomization system interactive voice/web response system was used for 
randomization and stratification.  
The randomization was stratified according to 2 region levels (Japan and all other countries), sex (male and 
female) and diabetic status (diagnosed with diabetes mellitus vs. not diagnosed with diabetes mellitus). All 
study patients completing the main study period continued on active treatment in an open-label design for an 
additional 53-week extension period.

EMA/95144/2021 
Page 65/129 
 
 
 
Blinding (masking) 
The main study was double-blind with respect to somapacitan and placebo; the active control arm was open-
label. The extension period was open-label. 
To avoid unblinding, placebo doses were adjusted to mimic the dose titration for the somapacitan treatment. 
The DXA scans were provided to the imaging laboratory for reading in a blinded manner. 
The investigators and study sites remained blinded throughout the study and were informed about the 
patient's treatment allocation and results after the database lock of the extension period. 
The central laboratory responsible for measurements of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 (PD) and the special laboratories 
analysing PK and antibody samples had access to or received a report listing the assigned treatment for each 
patient. 
The extension period was open-labelled but the blinding between somapacitan and placebo was maintained 
throughout the study. 
Statistical methods 
All statistical tests conducted were 2-sided on the 5% level. The region was defined as a factor with 2 levels: 
Japan and all other countries.  
Two analysis sets were defined in the protocol, prior to unblinding/release of the treatment randomization, 
and in accordance with ICH E9: 
Full analysis set (FAS) – used for evaluation of efficacy endpoints, includes all randomized subjects that 
received at least one dose of randomized treatment. Only in exceptional cases could subjects be excluded 
from the FAS. Subjects were analysed as randomized. 
Safety analysis set – used for evaluations of safety endpoints and included all randomized subjects that 
received at least one dose of randomized treatment. Subjects were analysed as treated. 
If an endpoint could not be calculated for a patient, this patient was excluded from the analyses of that 
endpoint. 
Analysis of primary endpoint Change from baseline to end of the main treatment period (week 34) in truncal 
fat percentage 
Body composition was measured by DXA and truncal fat percentage was defined as 100 times truncal fat 
mass (kg) divided by the sum of truncal fat mass (kg) and truncal lean body mass (kg). Truncal fat 
percentage as a function of time since baseline was expected to be stable if the study patient stayed on the 
randomized treatment in the main study period.  
For each of the complete data sets, the change from baseline to week 34 was analysed using an ANCOVA 
model with treatment, GHD onset type, sex, region, diabetes mellitus and sex by region by diabetes mellitus 
interaction as factors and the baseline truncal fat value as a covariate.  
The superiority of somapacitan over placebo was considered confirmed if the upper boundary of the 2-sided 
95% CI of the treatment difference (somapacitan – placebo) was below 0 (i.e. greater reduction from 
baseline in truncal fat percentage in the somapacitan treated group than in the placebo-treated group). 
Assessment report  
EMA/95144/2021 
Page 66/129 
 
 
 
The secondary comparison, comparison of somapacitan with somatropin, was used to assist the clinical 
judgment of the clinical relevance of the estimated treatment difference between somapacitan and placebo. 
Other exploratory analysis of the primary endpoint 
Using the same model as were used for the primary analysis of the primary endpoint, an additional 
exploratory analysis was done by including treatment by sex, treatment by region and treatment by GHD 
onset type interaction terms, one at a time, to the model. For region, subgroup analysis was also done based 
on the primary analysis model. 
Analysis of supportive secondary endpoints 
Changes from baseline to end of the main treatment period (week 34) were analysed using an ANCOVA, or 
mixed models repeated measurements (MMRM) model with treatment, GHD onset type, sex, region, diabetes 
mellitus and sex by region by diabetes mellitus interaction as factors and baseline value as a covariate. 
From the statistical model, the treatment differences (for lipids and cardiovascular endpoints, the treatment 
differences were reported as ratios) at week 34 between somapacitan and placebo and between somapacitan 
and somatropin were estimated and the corresponding 95% CIs and p-values were calculated for each 
endpoint. Subjects without post-randomization data for the analysed endpoint were not included in the 
analysis. 
Changes in body composition endpoints and lipids were analysed using the ANCOVA. Data on lipids were log-
transformed before analysis. 
Changes in IGF-I SDS and IGFBP-3 SDS from baseline were analysed using the MMRM described above. An 
unstructured covariance matrix was used to describe the variability of the repeated measurements for a 
subject. 
Changes in scores of TRIM-AGHD (total and individual domain scores) and SF-36v2 (physical and health 
component summary scores and individual domain scores) from baseline were analysed using the MMRM 
described above. The TSQM-9 scores (effectiveness, convenience and global satisfaction scores) were also 
analysed using the MMRM, except baseline as a covariate.  
The changes in cardiovascular parameters (hsCRP and IL-6) from baseline were analysed using the MMRM. 
The data for changes in cardiovascular parameters was log-transformed before analysis, both baseline value 
and values assessed at post-randomization visits. 
Changes in body weight from baseline were analysed using the MMRM described above. An unstructured 
covariance matrix was used to describe the variability of the repeated measurements for a subject. 
All other results are presented by descriptive statistics. 
Conducted statistical analyses took into account relevant factors that may affect clinical efficacy results of 
study results. Such an approach is common for the evaluation of clinical effects which are influenced by 
multiple factors.

Results 
Participant flow 
Main treatment period 
The study participant flow in the main treatment period is presented in Figure 11. 457 AGHD Patients were 
screened. 156 Patients were excluded, mainly because of not meeting the eligibility criteria (150/156 
patients). The main reasons for screening failure were IGF-I SDS levels <-0.5 (48.7%), the inability to 
confirm the diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency (18.6%), testosterone levels out of the normal range 
(18.6%), and free T4 levels outside the normal range (9.6%). Six AGHD patients were excluded for other 
reasons (5: deviation from time window, 1: personal reasons).

A total of 301 AGHD patients were randomized and 300 patients were exposed. One patient was randomized 
but did not receive any study drug and was therefore not included in any analyses (no reason was provided). 
23 Of 300 (7.7%) exposed study patients did not complete study treatment. The reasons why randomized 
study patients did not complete the main treatment phase are reported in Table 7.

Notes: Patients not completing treatment in the main treatment phase are categorised as “Discontinued trial product” or 
“Withdrawn”. For each of these categories, subcategories specify the reason for premature trial product discontinuation or 
withdrawal from trial. Patients withdrawn from the trial following premature trial product discontinuation are not included in 
the Withdrawn category but summarised separately as ‘discontinued trial product and withdrawn from trial’. 
A total of 277 (92%) patients completed treatment (34 weeks of treatment). Five (5) patients discontinued 
study product due to adverse events in the placebo (1 patient) and somatropin (4 patients) groups. These 
cases are further discussed in the clinical safety section below.  
Five of the 277 study patients who completed the main treatment phase were not exposed to study 
treatment in the extension treatment period. Most of these patients (4/5) had been randomized to 
somatropin; one patient had been randomized to somapacitan (1/5). From the reported reasons for non-
inclusion in the extension treatment phase, none are clearly related to the use of particular study medication 
in the main study treatment phase.

Extension treatment period 
272 Study patients were exposed in the extension treatment period (Figure 12). Of these, 257 study patients 
completed the study. After the provision of study medication, 9 study patients discontinued study treatment, 
and 11 study patients withdrew prematurely. In most of these cases (10/20), study patients decided to 
withdraw study medication because of personal reasons (not specified) (Table 8).

Treatment adherence 
The majority of patients adhered to the planned treatment. The mean adherence tended to be higher with 
somapacitan (95.5%) than with somatropin (90.6%) in the main treatment phase (diary data). Adherence in 
the main treatment phase of study 4054 was ≥97.5 up to 100% in 78.3% of study patients treated with 
sompacitan and 73.9% of study patients treated with somatropin.

Recruitment 
Study 4054 was initiated on 31 October 2014. The last visit of the last patient of the main treatment phase 
was on 1 May 2017. 
Conduct of the study 
There were 6 amendments to the protocol. 
Baseline data 
Baseline characteristics of study patients are summarized in Table 9.  
Of the 300 AGHD patients (48.3% male and 51.7% female) investigated, 91 (30.3%) patients had suffered 
from GHD since childhood (organic: 36 (12.0%) patients; idiopathic: 55 (18.3%) patients), while 209 
(69.7%) patients were first diagnosed as adults. 
The mean (SD) age was 45.1 (15.0) years, with the majority of patients in the age group from 23 to 64 
years. The mean BMI of 27.4 (6.3) kg/m2 indicated a somewhat overweight population.  
The patients were enrolled at 92 sites in 16 countries. Most patients were enrolled in the US (26.3%), Japan 
(15.3%), Australia (10.0%), India and Romania (both 9.3%).  
Most patients were white (66.7%) or Asian (28.7%). 
One patient (age 28 years/BMI 19.7 kg/m2, GHD childhood onset) had an extremely low height of 1.07 m at 
baseline and a body weight of 22.5 kg. The AGHD diagnosis was reconfirmed in this patient. 
The mean body weight, BMI, and waist circumference of placebo-treated study patients at baseline tended to 
be lower than those of somapacitan- and somatropin-treated patients. Upon inclusion of BMI as a covariate in 
the primary analysis model, the results of the primary analysis remained similar. Hence, any difference in 
BMI between study arms at baseline did not affect the results of the primary analysis.

A total of 16 (5.3%) patients (somapacitan: 7 (5.8%) patients; somatropin: 6 (5.0%) patients; placebo: 3 
(4.9%) patients) were reported as diabetic at baseline. Mean (SD) fasting glucose (somapacitan: 4.94 (0.67) 
mmol/l; somatropin: 5.03 (0.70) mmol/l; placebo: 4.91 (0.59) mmol/l) and mean (SD) fasting insulin 
(somapacitan: 79.9 (76.6) pmol/l; somatropin: 73.6 (52.0) pmol/l; placebo: 62.1 (43.0) pmol/l) were within 
normal ranges at baseline, though with greater baseline insulin levels in the somapacitan and placebo 
groups. Mean HbA1c was 5.4% across treatment groups.

Mean values for thyroid parameters (free T4, T4 and TSH) were all within normal range at baseline. No 
clinically relevant findings or differences between treatment groups were observed in vital signs at baseline 
or in ECG at baseline. 
Medical history and concomitant illnesses 
According to the applicant, the medical history and concomitant diseases reflected the study population of 
AGHD patients. 
The most frequent system organ classes reported in medical history were surgical and medical procedures 
(90 patients, 30.0%) and benign, malignant and unspecified neoplasms (80 patients, 26.7%). The following 4 
preferred terms were reported in ≥5% of the patients in medical history: craniopharyngioma (22 patients, 
7%); pituitary tumour (16 patients, 5%); pituitary tumour benign (25 patients, 8%); pituitary tumour 
removal (18 patients, 6%). 
The majority of patients reported concomitant illnesses within endocrine disorders (e.g. hypopituitarism, 
hypothyroidism, hypogonadism) (283 patients, 94%). The concomitant illnesses reported in at least 10% of 
the patients are listed below (Table 10). 
Hypopituitarism and related diseases, and hypertension and dyslipidaemia were frequently reported in this 
group of AGHD patients. For some patients, GHD was also reported within concomitant illnesses.

Treatment exposure 
The treatment exposure and doses in each treatment arms in the main and extension study are summarised 
in Table 11. It is noted that the study treatment doses of somapacitan (2.33-2.61 mg/week) tended to be 
higher compared to those treated with somatropin (1.89 mg/week). Since the affinity of somapacitan for the 
growth hormone receptor is 3-4 times less than that of somatropin due to the attached serum albumin, a 
higher weekly concentration of somapacitan than somatropin is needed to achieve similar effects in terms of 
IGF-I production.

Numbers analysed 
In total, 300 AGHD patients were randomized and exposed to study treatment (once-weekly somapacitan: 
120 patients; daily somatropin: 119 patients; placebo: 61 patients). All 300 AGHD patients were included in 
the full analysis set and the safety analysis set, which were identical in the current study. 
One patient was randomized to receive somapacitan treatment but did not receive this study treatment and 
was therefore not included in any analysis sets. The reason for this is unknown.

Outcomes and estimation 
Main treatment period 
Primary endpoint – change in truncal fat percentage from baseline to week 34 
The estimated mean change from baseline to the end of the main treatment period (week 34) in truncal fat 
percentage was greater for somapacitan than for placebo (Table 12). The difference between somapacitan 
and placebo in the change in truncal fat percentage was statistically significant. The results obtained after 
daily somatropin and weekly somapacitan are in favour of the daily treatment regimen.  
Secondary statistical analyses, excluding patients without week 34 data for the endpoint (***) and patients 
with less than 3 dose adjustments (****) and sensitivity analyses were similar to the results from the 
primary analyses.

The estimated mean differences in body composition endpoints from baseline to week 34 and the secondary 
endpoint analysis of body composition outcomes are presented in Table 13. 
In general, fat masses in different parts of the body tended to decrease upon treatment with somapacitan 
and somatropin, whereas these fat masses tended to increase upon placebo treatment. In addition, increases 
in truncal lean body mass, appendicular skeletal muscle mass, and total lean body mass tended to be larger 
for study patients treated with somapacitan and somatropin as compared to placebo treatment.  
Comparing somapacitan with daily somatropin treatment reveals overall inferior results for the weekly 
somapacitan dosing regimen. As this is considered a secondary endpoint in an open-label arm, these 
observations should be interpreted with caution, especially in the context of the findings of the GCP 
inspection.  
However, in the present study, the body composition (including the truncal fat measures) were acquired with 
dual energy x-ray absorptiometry which seems to be a relatively objective instrument of measure.

interaction as factors and baseline as a covariate. 
IGF-I SDS and IGFBP-3 SDS 
IGF-I and IGFBP-3 standard deviation scores (SDS) increased upon treatment with somapacitan or 
somatropin (Table 14). These scores hardly changed upon placebo study treatment. 
The mean IGF-I SDS increased from a baseline value below -2 to a value within the mean of the reference 
range after 34 weeks of active treatment (somapacitan: -2.54 to -0.17; somatropin: -2.53 to -0.23), 
whereas IGF-I levels remained similar in placebo-treated study patients (-2.64 to -2.62). A similar pattern 
was observed in mean IGFBP-3 SDS, though observed increases tended to be smaller than observed for IGF-I 
SDS. 
Observed changes in IGF-I SDS and IGFBP-3 SDS were larger upon somapacitan treatment compared to 
placebo treatment (difference 2.40 (95% CI 2.09 – 2.72) vs. 1.51 (95% CI 1.22 – 1.81)). Changes in IGF-I 
and IGFBP-3 SDS were similar for somapacitan and somatropin study treatment.

** Changes from baseline to the 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 16, 25, 33 and 35 week’s measurements was analysed using a mixed-
effect  model  for  repeated  measurements  including  treatment,  growth  hormone  deficiency  onset  type,  sex,  region, 
diabetes  mellitus  and  sex  by region by diabetes mellitus  interaction  as  factors  and  baseline  as  a  covariate,  all  nested

PRO questionnaires 
SF-36 Overall, SF-36 scores tended to be higher (i.e. indicating improvement) at week 34 compared to 
baseline. Differences in observed overall scores at week 34 compared to baseline tended to be higher for 
somapacitan treatment (overall physical score: +2.40 (baseline 44.82), overall mental score: +2.70 
(baseline 44.79)) as compared to placebo treatment (overall physical score: +2.01 (baseline 45.40), overall 
mental score: +1.28 (baseline 41.80)). Respective differences in applied mixed-model for repeated 
measurements were, however, not statistically significant (overall physical score: 0.53 (95% CI -1.31; 2.37) 
Assessment report  
EMA/95144/2021 
Page 79/129 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
p= 0.57; overall mental score: 2.68 (95% CI -0.07; 5.43), p= 0.06). Only observed difference for sub-scales 
mental health and social functioning were statistically significant.   
Observed differences in overall scores at week 34 compared to baseline tended to be lower (i.e. less 
improvement) for somapacitan treatment as compared to somatropin treatment (overall physical score: 
+2.87 (baseline 45.58), overall mental score: +4.09 (baseline 44.32)). Similar trends were observed for the 
subscale scores, except for the sub-scale physical functioning (somapacitan +3.18 (baseline 45.10) vs 
somatropin +2.46 (baseline 45.94))). Respective differences in applied mixed-model for repeated 
measurements were however not statistically significant (overall physical score: -1.00 (95% CI -2.5; 0.51) 
p= 0.20; overall mental score: -1.70 (95% CI -3.93; 0.53), p= 0.13).  
In summary, the improvement in SF-36 overall scores for somapacitan tended to be larger compared to 
those for placebo treatment, but lower compared to those for somatropin treatment. None of these trends 
were statistically significant. 
TRIM-AGHD 
In all study treatment arms TRIM-AGHD scores tended to decrease, which is indicative of health 
improvement. Observed decreases in total scores at week 34 tended to be larger for somapacitan (-5.71 
(baseline 46.62)) as compared to placebo treatment (-3.65 (baseline 48.42)). Respective difference between 
somapacitan and placebo in applied mixed-model for repeated measurements was, however, not statistically 
significant (-2.83 (95% CI -6.72; 1.05), p= 0.15). Similar trends were observed for comparisons between 
the TRIM-AGHD sub-scores of these treatments. 
Observed decreases in total scores at week 34 were lower (i.e. indicating less health improvement) for 
somapacitan (-5.71 (baseline 46.62)) as compared to somatropin treatment (-9.99 (baseline 46.00)) 
(difference in mixed-model for repeated measurements 4.99 (95% CI 1.84; 8.14), p= 0.002). The 
differences between the TRIM-AGHD subscale scores for somapacitan and somatropin were also statistically 
significant, except for the cognitive score.  
Observed differences in changes in total scores between somapacitan and placebo (-5.71 vs. -3.65) and 
somapacitan and somatropin (-5.71 vs. -9.99) did not meet the minimal important difference of 10 points. 
Similar results were observed in the sensitivity analysis, where the analysis of TRIM-AGHD endpoints was 
repeated in patients who answered the new version of the TRIM-AGHD questionnaire. 
TSQM-9 
The TSQM-9 scores (effectiveness, convenience, and global satisfaction scores) after 34 weeks of treatment 
were used to support the primary objective of evaluating the efficacy of once-weekly dosing of somapacitan 
(after 34 weeks of treatment) in AGHD patients. 
At 34 weeks of treatment, the overall mean satisfaction score was higher for somapacitan (63.1%) than for 
placebo (54.0%) (estimated treatment difference 8.45; 95% CI 0.66 – 16.24; p= 0.03). No statistically 
significant differences were observed for the mean effectiveness (somapacitan 56.1%, placebo 49.6%; 
estimated treatment difference 6.60 (95% CI -0.47; 13.67), p= 0.07) and mean convenience scores 
(somapacitan 77.7%, placebo 74.3%; estimated treatment difference 2.86 (95% CI -2.54; 8.27), p= 0.30) 
for these treatments at week 34.  
At week 34, the mean effectiveness score was lower for somapacitan (56.1%) than for somatropin (67.1%) 
(estimated treatment difference -10.74; 95% CI -16.49 up to -4.98; p= 0.0003). However, no statistically

significant differences were observed for the mean convenience (somapacitan 77.7%, somatropin 73.9%; 
estimated treatment difference 4.00 (95% CI -0.40; 8.39), p= 0.07) and mean global satisfaction scores 
(somapacitan 63.1%, somatropin 69.0%; estimated treatment difference -5.45 (95% CI -11.80; 0.89), p= 
0.09) between these treatments at week 34. 
Lipid profile – cholesterol and triglycerides 
Mean total cholesterol levels were in the upper part of the reference range both at baseline and at week 34 
for all treatment groups. There were no clinically relevant or statistically significant changes in the lipid profile 
(total cholesterol, HDL- cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides) from baseline to the end of the main 
treatment period (week 34) in any of the treatment groups. 
Cardiovascular parameters 
There were no clinically relevant changes in cardiovascular parameters (hsCRP and IL-6) from baseline to end 
of main treatment period (week 34) in any of the treatment groups. 
Extension treatment period 
Change in body composition from baseline to week 87 
The estimated mean differences in all body composition endpoints from baseline to week 87 are presented in 
Table 15.  
The reduction in estimated mean truncal fat percentage at week 87 from baseline was -1.52 % in 
somapacitan/somapacitan arm and -2.67% in the somatropin/somatropin arm. The estimated treatment 
difference between the somapacitan/somapacitan and somatropin/ somatropin in change in truncal fat mass 
percentage was 1.15% ((95% CI: -0.10; 2.40), p=0.07). 
The gain in estimated total lean body mass at week 87 from baseline was 1739.05 g for the 
somapacitan/somapacitan treatment regimen and 1305.73 g for the somatropin/ somatropin treatment 
regimen. The estimated treatment difference between the somapacitan/somapacitan and somatropin/ 
somatropin in the change in truncal lean mass was 433.32 g ((95% CI -404 up to 1271), p=0.31). 
Comparable effects were seen for most of the other body composition endpoints.  
There were no statistically significant treatment differences in any of the body composition endpoints 
between the somapacitan/somapacitan and somatropin/ somatropin treatment regimen. Overall, decreases in 
fat masses tended to be less for the somapacitan/somapacitan treatment regimen compared to the 
somatropin/ somatropin treatment regimen. By contrast, increases in lean body masses and bone mineral 
content tended to be higher for study patients in the somapacitan/ somapacitan treatment regimen compared 
to those in the somatropin/ somatropin treatment regimen.  
In study patients treated with somatropin in the main treatment phase who were re-randomized to receive 
somapacitan in the extension treatment phase, decreases in truncal fat percentage compared to baseline 
tended to be larger during somatropin treatment (-2.28%) as compared to somapacitan treatment in the 
extension treatment period (-0.96%). Similar trends were observed with respect to other endpoints 
pertaining to fat masses.

IGF-I SDS and IGFBP-3 SDS 
A marked increase in mean IGF-I SDS was observed from baseline to week 87 for all treatment regimens. 
Study patients who received placebo treatment in the main treatment period and somapacitan in the 
extension treatment period also demonstrated an increase in the level of IGF-I SDS, with the mean levels 
similar to other treatment regimens at the end of the treatment. 
Similar trends were observed for IGFBP-3, though observed increases were smaller than observed for IGF-I 
SDS. 
No statistically significant differences in change from baseline to week 87 in IGF-I SDS and IGFBP-3 SDS 
were observed between the somapacitan/somapacitan and somatropin/ somatropin treatment regimens. 
PRO questionnaires 
SF-36  
For all SF-36 sub-scores and overall scores, the estimated change from baseline to the end of treatment 
period (week 87) tended to be smaller -indicating less improvement- for the somapacitan/somapacitan 
treatment regimen compared to the somatropin/ somatropin treatment regimen. Regarding the overall 
scores, the difference in estimated changes from baseline to week 87 were statistically significant for the 
overall mental score (somapacitan/somapacitan 4.09, somatropin/somatropin 6.87; estimated treatment 
difference -2.77 (95% CI -5.4; -0.1), p=0.04), but not for the overall physical score 
(somapacitan/somapacitan 2.79, somatropin/somatropin 3.81; estimated treatment difference -1.02 (95% CI 
-3.1; 1.0), p=0.33).  
TRIM-AGHD 
For the TRIM-AGHD the estimated decreases from baseline to week 87 in all five scores (cognitive score, 
energy score, physical score, psychological score, total score) were smaller for the somapacitan/somapacitan 
treatment regimen compared to the somatropin/somatropin treatment regimen. These data indicate that less 
improvement was observed for the somapacitan/somapacitan treatment regimen as compared to the 
somatropin/somatropin treatment regimen. The estimated change for the total scores between these 
treatment regimens was statistically significant in favour of the somatropin/somatropin treatment regimen 
(somapacitan/somapacitan -8.01, somatropin/somatropin -15.32; estimated treatment difference 7.32 (95% 
CI 3.3; 11.3), p= 0.0003).However, the estimated treatment difference in the total score between these 
treatment regimens did not meet the minimal important difference of 10 points. 
TSQM-9 
At week 87, the convenience subscore of the TSQM-9 questionnaire was higher for the 
somapacitan/somapacitan treatment regimen (80.0%) compared to the somatropin/somatropin treatment 
regimen (72.6%). The difference in the TSQM-9 convenience sub score between these treatment regimens 
was statistically significant in favour of somapacitan (estimated treatment difference: 7.09 (95% CI: 1.7 – 
12.4), p=0.01).By contrast, observed differences in the effectiveness (65.7 vs. 69.6%) and global 
satisfaction subscores (68.1 vs. 71.7%) of the TSQM-9 questionnaire at week 87 tended to be smaller for the 
somapacitan/somapacitan treatment regimen as compared to the somatropin/ somatropin treatment 
regimen. Estimated treatment differences at week 87 in effectiveness score (-4.62 (95% CI -11.8; 2.6), p= 
0.21) and global satisfaction score (-4.19 (95% CI -11.8; 3.4), p= 0.28) were however not statistically 
significant between the somapacitan/somapacitan and somatropin/somatropin treatment regimen. 
Lipid profile – cholesterol and triglycerides 
Assessment report  
EMA/95144/2021 
Page 83/129 
 
 
 
There were no statistically significant differences in in lipid parameters (i.e., total cholesterol, HDL-
cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides) between the somapacitan/somapacitan and the somatropin/ 
somatropin treatment regimen. 
Cardiovascular parameters 
There were no statistically significant treatment differences in cardiovascular parameters between the 
somapacitan/somapacitan and somatropin/somatropin treatment regimens. 
Ancillary analyses 
Clinical efficacy according to age, time of GHD onset, and gender 
With respect to study 4054, the efficacy of somapacitan compared to placebo concerning the primary 
endpoint (change in truncal fat percentage at week 34 compared to baseline) in the main treatment period 
was evaluated for different intrinsic subgroups including demographic factors (age and gender) and disease 
factors (GHD onset). Extrinsic factors were not evaluated. 
Age 
Reduction in the estimated change from baseline in truncal fat percentage tended to be larger for patients ≥ 
65 years of age (n= 13) than patients ≤ 64 years of age (n= 107) after 34 weeks of treatment with 
somapacitan (i.e. -2.16 vs -0.98% for patients aged ≥ 65 years and ≤ 64 years respectively). For both age 
groups, a reduction in truncal fat percentage was observed with somapacitan compared to placebo 
(estimated treatment difference: ≥ 65 years of age: -1.52%; ≤ 64 years of age: -1.71%). In study patients 
≤ 64 years, this difference was statistically significant (95% CI -2.99; -0.43).  
In study patients under 65 years, the changes in truncal fat percentage at week 34 compared to baseline, 
were smaller for sompacitan (n= 107; -0.98) compared to somatropin (n= 101; -2.16) (estimated treatment 
difference 1.19 (95% CI 0.14; 2.23)). A similar trend was observed for this endpoint in study patients aged 
65 years and above (somapacitan (n= 13): -2.16, versus somatropin (n= 18): -2.48), but this trend was not 
statistically significant (estimated treatment difference 0.32 (95% CI -2.07; 2.70)). 
Due to a low number of patients ≥ 75 years of age (5 patients in study 4054) no subgroup analysis was 
conducted in this age category. 
GHD onset (childhood or adult-onset) 
In both growth hormone deficiency of childhood (-1.07 vs +0.90%; estimated treatment difference-1.97%) 
and adult-onset (-1.09 vs +0.32%; estimated treatment difference: -1.41%), decreases in truncal fat 
percentage tended to be higher in study patients treated with somapacitan compared to those treated with 
placebo. Observed differences were only statistically significant in study patients with adult-onset growth 
hormone deficiency (95% CI -2.72; -0.10).  
In the SmPC of somatropin product Norditropin FlexPro different starting doses are recommended for 
childhood-onset (0.2 - 0.5 mg/day) and adulthood-onset (0.1 - 0.3 mg/day). However, no significant effects 
of weekly somapacitan were found on PK or PK/PD parameters in study 4054 and other Phase 3 studies. 
Since somapacitan doses are individually titrated based on individual needs, clinical response, and IGF-I 
level, the applicant did not propose particular dose recommendations for patients with childhood-onset and 
adult-onset AGHD. 
Assessment report  
EMA/95144/2021 
Page 84/129 
 
 
 
Gender 
A reduction in truncal fat percentage was observed with somapacitan compared to placebo for both male (-
1.69 vs. +0.80%; estimated treatment difference: -2.49%) and female (-0.57 vs. +0.35%; estimated 
treatment difference: -0.92%) AGHD study patients. Estimated treatment difference versus placebo was 
statistically significant in male AGHD study patients (95% CI -4.19; -0.79), but not in female AGHD study 
patients (95% CI -2.50; +0.66).  
From medical literature, it is known that male patients are more responsive to growth hormone as compared 
to female patients (Burman et al. 1997; Johannsson et al. 1996). In line with this, in both the SmPCs of 
somatropin products (e.g. Norditropin Flexpro) and in proposed SmPC concerning somapacitan, (starting) 
doses for growth hormone are higher for female as compared to male AGHD patients. 
Post-hoc simulation study 
In study 4054, there was one 8-week dose titration period in the main treatment phase, and another one in 
the extension treatment phase. Dose adjustments were allowed every two weeks. This means that a 
maximum of four dose titration steps was allowed. 47% Of AGHD study patients did not obtain IGF-I levels 
above 0 at the end of the dose titration period. 
A simulation study was conducted to investigate the doses and exposures that would likely be needed to 
achieve average IGF-I levels > 0 SDS for each AGHD study patient who did not reach IGF-I levels above 0 at 
the end of the dose titration period in the main treatment phase of study 4054 (i.e. at visit 11).  
Methods 
The PK/PD dataset of the somapacitan study population in the main treatment phase of study 4054 was used 
for the analysis. Study patients were grouped according to whether they reached IGF-I SDS levels above 0, 
based on a single IGF-I measurement after dose titration. Study patients who did not complete dose titration 
were excluded from this analysis and the dataset. The dataset consisted of 116 titration completers. 
Individual prediction of exposure and IGF-I average SDS following dose increase in the range 0.1 up to a 
maximum of 8 mg per week were based on the pre-defined analysis of individual dose-exposure-IGF-I 
response curves by population PK/PD modelling. 
In AGHD study patients who already reached IGF-I SDS levels above 0, no new dose-exposure-response 
prediction was performed. In study patients who did not reach an IGF-I SDS level above 0, somapacitan 
doses were consecutively increased according to recommended posology until it was predicted that the IGF-I 
average SDS level reached 0. The predicted dose-exposure-response pair was reported for the lowest 
somapacitan dose that provided an IGF-I SDS level above 0. In study patients who did not reach an IGF-I 
average SDS level above 0 and where it was predicted that IGF-I average SDS above 0 could likely not be 
reached within the dose range of 0.1-8 mg/week, the predicted dose-exposure-response pair at 8 mg/week 
were reported. 
Results 
A graphical representation of the predicted increases in doses and IGF-I average SDS is presented in Figure 
13.

study patients. Blue points and lines denote data from the subset of “patients not reaching IGF-I SDS above 0” based on 
the single IGF-I measurement after titration. Circles denote the dose and IGF-Iavg SDS pairs obtained after titration. Note 
that some patients reached IGF-Iavg SDS above 0 based on all available samples, although the IGF-I measurement taken 
after titration was below 0 SDS, and vice versa. Crosses indicate predicted dose levels required to reach IGF-Iavg SDS 
above 0 or predicted IGF-Iavg SDS at 8 mg for those predicted not to reach IGF-Iavg SDS above 0. 
Figure  13  Predicted  individual  dose-IGF-I  response  curves  for  patients  not  reaching  IGF-I  SDS 
above 0 (trial 4054 main) 
According to individual predictions, an IGF-Iavg SDS>0 can be reached upon continued dose titration in many 
AGHD  study  patients  in  whom  an  IGF-Iavg  SDS  level  >0  was  not  achieved  in  the  main  treatment  phase  of 
study 4054 (47%). A total of 90% of the population reached, or would likely be able to reach, an IGF-I SDS 
above 0 within the proposed dose range (up to 8 mg) and based on continued titration towards and IGF-I SDS 
level of 0 to +2. 
The simulation study in patients not reaching IGF-I SDS>0 in trial 4054 main was also performed in important 
AGHD subgroup (Table 16). Since some of the AGHD subgroups are small, caution is needed with respect to 
the interpretation of obtained results.

Clinical studies in special populations 
Age 
According to the selection criteria for study participation in these studies, AGHD patients up to 79 years of 
age were eligible for study participation. An overview of the subjects aged 65 years and above who have 
been included in controlled (studies 3947, 4054, 4244, 4043) and non-controlled (studies 3915 and 4237) 
studies is presented in Table 18. Studies 3915 and 4237 did not include subjects above the age of 64 years 
(study 3915 subjects aged 20-45 years, study 4237 subjects 45-64 years). 
In total, 96 patients/subjects aged 65 years and above were included across the studies. In the controlled 
studies, the majority of elderly patients/subjects were aged between 65-74 years (77/89= 86.5%) with only 
a few patients/subjects aged 75 years or above (12/89= 13.5%). In the non-controlled studies, no subjects 
aged 75 years of age were included.

As stated in the ancillary analysis section above, similar trends with respect to the primary endpoint changes 
in truncal fat percentage at week 34 compared to baseline were observed in somapacitan- and placebo-
treated study patients in study 4054 aged up to 64 years of age (n= 158) and those aged 65 years and 
above (i.e. up to 79 years) (n= 23). Based on this, the applicant expects similar effects of replacement 
therapy between AGHD patients aged 65-79 years and AGHD patients aged 79 years and above, as no 
substantial phenotypic differences between these patients are anticipated.  
The applicant has not evaluated the clinical effects of somapacitan in paediatric patients. Marketing 
authorization of somapacitan is currently applied for adults with growth hormone deficiency. 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
The applicant has not evaluated the clinical effects of AGHD study patients with renal and/or hepatic 
impairment. This is not of concern, since somapacitan dosing is titrated individually in each AGHD patient 
based on IGF-I standard deviation scores.

Supportive study(ies) 
Two supportive studies (study 4244 and 4043) were conducted. The methodology and main results of these 
studies are summarized below. 
Study 4244 (Japan) 
Design and methods 
Study 4244 was a national, multicentre, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, active-controlled study. The 
study was designed to compare the safety of once-weekly somapacitan with daily somatropin in previously 
treated Japanese AGHD patients for 52 weeks (20 weeks dose titration, 32 weeks fixed-dose treatment). 
Study patients were randomized 3:1 to somapacitan or somatropin. Study patients were stratified according 
to gender. 
Adult AGHD patients up to 79 years of age diagnosed and treated with human growth hormone for at least 6 
months with an IGF-I levels between -2 and +2 standard deviation scores were eligible for inclusion. Patients 
with diabetes mellitus were not allowed to participate as diabetes mellitus is a contraindication for GH 
treatment in Japan. 
Starting doses of respectively somapacitan and somatropin were 1.5 and 1.4 mg/week in patients aged 18-
60 years, 2.0 and 2.1 mg/week in female patients on oral oestrogen irrespective of age, and 1.0 and 0.7 
mg/week in patients over 60 years of age. Study treatment doses could be adjusted every 4th week based 
on IGF-I standard deviation scores during the first 20 weeks. Sampling for IGF-I to support the dose titration 
was performed 3 days after the previous dose adjustment visit.  
The primary endpoint was the incidence of adverse events, including injection site reactions, from the first 
administration of study product to the end of the study period (53 weeks, including 1-week follow-up). The 
secondary efficacy endpoints were change from baseline (randomization) to end of the treatment period 
(week 52) in adipose tissue compartments and TSQM-9 scores. Other assessments including IGF-I and 
IGFBP-3 were also evaluated. 
Results 
A total of 62 Japanese patients were exposed in the study (53.2% male and 46.8% female patients). The age 
range was 20−75 years. Mean IGF-I standard deviation scores at baseline were 0.64 and 0.88 for study 
patients randomized to respectively somapacitan and somatropin treatment. Overall, no clinically relevant 
differences between the treatment groups were evident at baseline.  
Based on the estimated changes from baseline, the expected growth-induced effect on the abdominal adipose 
tissues compartments visceral adipose tissue (VAT) (somapacitan: -2.25; somatropin: -0.51), subcutaneous 
adipose tissue (SAT) (somapacitan: -4.96; somatropin: 6.57), and total adipose tissue (TAT) (somapacitan: -
6.67; somatropin: 6.17) obtained prior to the study was maintained for up to 52 weeks of treatment for both 
somapacitan and somatropin. No statistically significant treatment difference in change from baseline 
between somapacitan and somatropin were found for any of the abdominal adipose tissue endpoints 
(estimated treatment differences VAT: -1.74 (95% -18.13; 14.66), SAT -11.53 (95% -35.54; 12.48), TAT -
12.85 (-47.31; 21.62)). However, in contrast with study 4054, observed trends in effects with respect to 
aforementioned endpoints were in favour of weekly somapacitan as compared to daily somatropin treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/95144/2021 
Page 91/129 
 
 
 
 
After 52 weeks of study treatment, the mean IGF-I standard deviation scores were similar for somapacitan 
and somatropin (somapacitan: 0.61; somatropin: 0.52). 
Improvement from baseline to week 52 appeared across all three TSQM-9 domains (convenience 
(somapacitan: 14.01; somatropin: 7.22), effectiveness (somapacitan: 7.99; somatropin: 3.12), global 
satisfaction (somapacitan: 10.07; somatropin: 3.18)) for both somapacitan and somatropin. For all three 
domains, unlike in study 4054, larger improvements tended to be observed with somapacitan as compared to 
somatropin. These differences were not statistically significant (estimated treatment differences convenience: 
6.79 (95% CI -1.04; 14.61), effectiveness 4.87 (95% CI -3.46; 13.20), global satisfaction 6.88 (95% CI -
1.08; 14.85)). 
Study 4043 
Design and methods 
Study 4043 was a multicentre, multinational, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, active-controlled study. 
The study was designed to compare the safety of once-weekly somapacitan with daily somatropin in 
previously treated AGHD patients for 26 weeks. The secondary objective was to evaluate the degree of 
treatment satisfaction of once-weekly dosing of somapacitan during 26 weeks of treatment in AGHD patients 
previously treated with daily growth hormone. 
The study consisted of an 8-week dose titration period, an 18-week fixed-dose treatment period, and a 1-
week washout period. Study patients were randomized 2:1 to somapacitan or somatropin. 
Adult AGHD patients up to 79 years of age diagnosed and treated with hormone replacement therapy for at 
least six months were eligible for inclusion. The key exclusion criteria in study 4043 included active malignant 
disease or a history of malignancy. Patients with diabetes mellitus enrolled at Japanese sites were not 
allowed to participate in the studies as diabetes mellitus is a contraindication for growth hormone treatment 
in Japan. 
Starting doses of respectively somapacitan and somatropin were 1.5 and 1.4 mg/week in patients aged 18-
60 years, 2.0 and 2.1 mg/week in female patients on oral oestrogen irrespective of age, and 1.0 and 0.7 
mg/week in patients over 60 years of age. Study treatment doses could be adjusted based on IGF-I SDS. 
During the first 8 weeks, study treatment doses could be adjusted every 2nd week which allowed for four 
opportunities for dose adjustment. Sampling for IGF-I to support the dose titration was performed 3 days 
after the previous dose adjustment visit. Consistent with the confirmatory study 4054, the weekly dose range 
of somapacitan was 0.1 mg to 8 mg, and the daily dose range for somatropin was 0.05 mg to 1.1 mg in 
study 4043. In alignment with the Japanese prescribing information, the maximum daily dose of somatropin 
was 1.0 mg for the Japanese patients included study 4043. The treatment duration was 26 weeks (8 weeks 
dose titration and 18 weeks fixed-dose period).    
The primary endpoint was incidence of adverse events, including injection site reactions from baseline to the 
end of the treatment period (26 weeks). The secondary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline 
(randomization) to end of treatment period (week 26) in TSQM-9 scores. Other assessments including IGF-I 
and IGFBP-3 were also evaluated. 
Results  
A total of 92 patients were exposed in the study (54.3% male and 45.7% female patients). A total of 58.7% 
of the patients were White and 19.6% were Asian. The age range was 19−77 years. Overall, no clinically 
Assessment report

relevant differences between the treatment groups were evident at baseline. Though the mean IGF-I SDS at 
screening was within reference range, some patients in the somapacitan group had IGF-I SDS below -2 
indicating that their pre-study GH may not have been optimal (pre-study mean GH dose: 0.5 mg/day). The 
study included patients from 6 countries (Denmark, Sweden, Germany, France, UK and Japan) with 58.7% of 
the patients being White and 19.6% being Asian. Race and ethnicity were not reported for 20 patients in 
France due to local regulations.  
The IGF-I profile was maintained throughout the study in both treatment groups. At baseline, the mean IGF-I 
standard deviation score of somapacitan was 0.28 and that of somatropin was 0.91. The mean IGF-I SDS 
after 26 weeks treatment was similar for somapacitan and somatropin (somapacitan: 0.22; somatropin: 
0.35).  
Improvement from baseline to week 26 appeared across all three TSQM-9 domains (convenience 
(somapacitan: 15.3; somatropin: 3.0), effectiveness (somapacitan: 9.7; somatropin: 3.8), global satisfaction 
(somapacitan: 5.4; somatropin: -1.2)) for both somapacitan and somatropin. For all three domains, greater 
improvement tended to be observed with somapacitan as compared to somatropin. Except for a higher 
convenience for somapacitan (estimated treatment differences: convenience: 8.22 (95% CI 1.51; 14.93)) 
these differences were not statistically significant (estimated treatment differences effectiveness 3.30 (95% 
CI -4.14; 10.75), global satisfaction 3.07 (95% CI-4.70; 10.83)). In line with this, in study 4054, only the 
convenience subscore tended to be higher for somapacitan as compared to somatropin treatment (see 
above).  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Clinical efficacy of somapacitan was evaluated in three clinical studies. These studies concerned a 
confirmatory efficacy and safety study in growth hormone treatment naïve AGHD patients (study 4054), and 
two supportive studies in AGHD patients who were previously treated with growth hormone (studies 4244 
and 4043). 
Study design. Study 4054 consisted of a main treatment phase of 35 weeks, followed by an extension 
treatment phase of 53 weeks. In the main treatment phase of pivotal study 4054, study patients were 
randomized to receive double-blind somapacitan or placebo treatment, or open-label somatropin treatment. 
Somatropin (e.g. EU/1/06/332, EU/1/00/164) is currently indicated for growth hormone supplementation in 
AGHD patients and is, therefore, an acceptable active comparator for somapacitan treatment. The chosen 
design is appropriate to compare the clinical effects of somapacitan and placebo treatment. There is, 
however, an increased risk of bias of study results (e.g. information bias) with respect to open-label 
somatropin treatment as compared to double-blind somapacitan and placebo treatment. Due to this 
increased risk of bias, treatment comparisons between somapacitan and somatropin treatment should be 
interpreted with caution. However, in the present study, the body composition (including the truncal fat 
measures) were acquired with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry which seems to be a relatively objective 
instrument of measure.  
It is acknowledged that objective evaluations enhance the interpretability of study results in study 4054. 
Though there was no evidence of intentional data manipulation, study results of study 4054 should still be 
interpreted with caution since the findings of the GCP inspection may have affected the quality and integrity 
Assessment report  
EMA/95144/2021 
Page 93/129 
 
 
 
of the study data as detailed above (under GCP inspection). However, no data manipulation was reported and 
findings were not considered to have a significant impact on final reliability of the reported data and clinical 
study data may still be interpreted.  
The total study treatment period in study 4054 was 87 weeks (main treatment phase plus extension 
treatment phase). Such a total study treatment period is limited considering that AGHD patients need life-
long growth hormone supplementation. Hence, long-term effectiveness and safety of somapacitan treatment 
– i.e. over multiple years – is yet unknown. This information will be further collected post-approval. 
Study patients who received somapacitan treatment in the extension period of study 4054 had been treated 
with somapacitan, placebo, or somatropin in the earlier main treatment period. The switch from main to 
extension phase of the study was performed with a week interval without treatment. No washout effects of 
previous study treatment are expected in the extension period across different study treatments as study 
treatment will be titrated up to the optimal dose during the first 8 weeks of the extension period. Any 
remaining washout effects of the main treatment period will have disappeared after this treatment period. 
Hence, a washout period of one week at the end of the main treatment period is acceptable. 
Supportive studies 4244 and 4043 were randomized, open-label active-controlled studies in which the clinical 
effects of somapacitan and somatropin were compared in AGHD patients who had received prior growth 
hormone supplementation. Due to the open-label design of these studies, the results of these studies should 
be interpreted with caution because of an increased risk of bias. Apart from this, due to the lack of a placebo 
arm in both studies, there may be a lack of assay sensitivity in both clinical studies. 
Study treatment was administered subcutaneously in studies 4054, 4244, and 4043. Somapacitan and 
placebo were administered once per week, whereas somatropin was administered daily. It is appropriate that 
the starting doses of study treatment in clinical studies 4054, 4244, and 4043 took into account age, gender, 
and oestrogen status, since it is known that the need of growth hormone supplementation varies for these 
factors (Johannsson et al. 1997, Hoffman et al. 2004).  
It is noted that starting doses of somapacitan/placebo and somatropin expressed in doses per week were 
comparable if aforementioned factors are taken into account (i.e. adults up to 60 years of age: 1.5 vs. 1.4 
mg/week, patients > 60 years of age: 1.0 vs. 0.7 mg/week, women on oral oestrogen: 2.0 vs. 2.1 
mg/week). However, upon subsequent dose titration within a particular AGHD subgroup (e.g. men), dosing of 
weekly somapacitan should be about 1.14 times higher than the total dose of somatropin per week to achieve 
similar IGF-I SDS levels. This is due to the lower receptor binding affinity and the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics properties of somapacitan as compared to somatropin.  
The starting doses and dose titration steps in conducted clinical studies appear to be in line with international 
recommendations for growth hormone replacement therapy in AGHD patients (Cook et al. 2009). 
Study population. It is appropriate to conduct a pivotal study in treatment-naïve AGHD patients. Overall, 
applied diagnostic tests for diagnosing AGHD in study 4054 based on insulin tolerance test (Biller et al. 
2002), growth hormone-releasing hormone and arginine test according to BMI (Aimaratti et al. 1998, Ho and 
Participants 2007, Uean et al. 2009), and three or more pituitary hormone deficiencies and IGF-I SDS 
(Hartman et al. 2002) are appropriate for diagnosing AGHD (Reed et al. 2013). Included AGHD study patients 
in pivotal study 4054 appear to be representative for AGHD patients in clinical practice considering applied 
eligibility criteria.  
It is noted that the inclusion criteria in study 4054 for non-Japanese and Japanese AGHD patients are 
different. In Japan, inclusion criteria in study 4054 were different compared to the rest of the world. 
Assessment report  
EMA/95144/2021 
Page 94/129 
 
 
 
Differences include that in- and exclusion criteria in Japan unlike the rest of the world were dependent on the 
type of onset of AGHD (childhood or adulthood), and the presence/absence of diabetes mellitus. Apart from 
this, the diagnostic criteria for insulin tolerance tests, glucagon tests, and pituitary hormone deficiency were 
different for Japanese and non-Japanese AGHD study patients in study 4054.  
Also, in study 4043, selection criteria for study participation were slightly different for Japanese and non-
Japanese study patients, since patients with diabetes mellitus were excluded in Japan. 
In study 4244, which was only conducted in Japan, there were uniform selection criteria for study 
participation (although these did not match the inclusion of study 4054).  
Endpoints. The primary endpoint of study 4054 was the change at week 34 compared to baseline with 
respect to the truncal fat percentage. This primary endpoint was agreed by the CHMP in a previous scientific 
advice. Fat-related endpoints were also accepted for two other growth hormone depot preparations (e.g. 
Nutropin depot and somatropin Biopartners). 
Secondary endpoints included endpoints with respect to body composition determined by DXA scanning such 
as changes compared to baseline in visceral adipose tissue, other fat masses, truncal lean body mass, 
appendicular skeletal muscle mass, lean body mass, total bone mineral content, and total bone mineral 
density. Adipose tissue compartments were also evaluated in study 4244, but not in study 4043. 
IGF-I SDS, IGFBP-3 SDS, and TSQM-9 were evaluated in all studies. 
Body weight, waist circumference, blood lipids, IL-6, hsCRP, TRIM-AGHD, and SF-36 were only evaluated in 
study 4054. 
The aforementioned endpoints are considered appropriate for the evaluation of the clinical effects of growth 
hormone in AGHD patients.  
Statistical analysis   
It is well-known that the clinical effects of growth hormone treatment may be different in different 
geographical regions, gender, and diabetic status (Reed et al. 2013). Because of this, it is supported that 
randomization was stratified according to these factors and that these factors were also taken into account as 
factors in an analysis of covariance. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The patient disposition in the main and extension treatment phases of study 4054 was clarified by the 
applicant. Included study patients appear to be representative of AGHD patients in clinical practice. 
Premature treatment of study discontinuation of AGHD study patients treated with somapacitan did not tend 
to occur more frequently than among AGHD study patients treated with somatropin or placebo.  
AGHD patients up to 79 years of age were included in clinical studies. No clinical studies have been conducted 
in AGHD patients aged 79 years and above. Observed trends with respect to the primary endpoint change in 
truncal fat percentage at week 34 compared to baseline for somapacitan and placebo treatment were similar 
for AGHD patients aged 65 years and above as compared to those up to 64 years. Similar effects of 
somapacitan are expected in AGHD patients aged 65-79 years and AGHD patients aged 79 years and above, 
as no substantial phenotypic differences between these patients are anticipated.  
Assessment report  
EMA/95144/2021 
Page 95/129 
 
 
 
Overall, the baseline characteristics of the included study patients were comparable. The body weight at 
baseline of placebo-treated study patients tended to be lower compared to study patients treated with 
somapacitan and somatropin (mean 69.8 vs 76.0-76.2 kg; median 69 vs 72.9-74.1). In line with this, the 
BMI (26.1 vs. 27.7-27.9 kg/m2) and mean waist circumference (88.5 vs 93.9-94.0 cm) also tended to be 
lower for placebo-treated study patients as compared to somapacitan- and somatropin-treated study patients 
(93.9-94.0 cm). Later, it was shown that observed differences with respect to the primary endpoint would 
remain similar if BMI was used as a covariate in an explorative post-hoc analysis. 
Most study patients were included in the United States (26.3%), Japan (15.3%), and Australia (10%). Over 
20% of included study patients were included in different countries within the European Union (e.g. 
Germany, Romania, Poland, United Kingdom). This supports external generalization of the study results of 
study 4054 to AGHD patients within the European Union.   
Treatment exposure in patients treated with somapacitan in the main treatment period tended to be 
somewhat higher compared to patients treated with placebo of somatropin (mean treatment dose 2.52 vs. 
2.17-2.31 mg per week). These differences are small. However, in the extension treatment period, mean 
study treatment doses of somatropin-treated patients tended to be somewhat lower (1.89 mg/week) 
compared to somapacitan-treated patients in this treatment period (2.33-2.61 mg/week). The affinity of 
somapacitan for the growth hormone receptor is 3-4 times less than that of somatropin due to the attached 
serum albumin. This implies that a higher weekly concentration of somapacitan than somatropin is needed to 
achieve a similar effect in terms of IGF-I production.  
The mean adherence in the extension treatment phase tended to be higher for study patients treated with 
somapacitan in the extension treatment phase compared to those treated with somatropin in respective 
study phase (somapacitan/somapacitan (i.e. treated with somapacitan in both the main and extension 
treatment period): 84.6 %; somatropin/somatropin (i.e. treated with somatropin in both the main and 
extension treatment period): 77.6%) (ecap data). 
Primary endpoint – Change from baseline in truncal fat percentage  
Observed decrease in truncal fat percentage at week 34 compared to baseline was higher for somapacitan (-
1.17) compared to placebo treatment (+0.49) (estimated difference -1.53 (95% CI -2.68; -0.38), p= 0.009). 
These differences appear to be limited. Moreover, changes in truncal fat percentage at week 34 compared to 
baseline were smaller for somapacitan (-1.17) as compared to somatropin treatment (-2.39) (estimated 
difference 1.17 (95% CI 0.23; 2.11), p< 0.05). Similar results were obtained in sensitivity analyses in which 
study patients without week 34 for the primary endpoint were excluded, and upon exclusion of these study 
patients and study patients with fewer than 3 dose adjustments. Similar trends were observed all over the 
world. At D120, the clinical relevance of aforementioned clinical effects of somapacitan compared to those of 
placebo and somatropin respectively was considered unclear. Therefore, a major objection was formulated 
about this issue. 
The applicant identified several factors that could contribute to underestimating the clinical effects of 
somapacitan on body composition relative to placebo and/or daily growth hormone replacement 
(somatropin). These include too low IGF-I SDS levels, i.e. under -0.5 SDS in this study. Somapacitan was 
underdosed in 22% of study patients in the main treatment phase of study 4054. This proportion tended to 
be higher in particular subgroups in which the study patients are less sensitive to the effects of growth 
hormone (e.g. women on oral oestrogen treatment (42%), patients with childhood-onset AGHD (34%) (main 
treatment phase)). The applicant explained that study patients in these subgroups may have been unequally

randomized among the different treatment groups. It is agreed that the aforementioned factors might explain 
the limited efficacy of somapacitan in study 4054. 
Secondary endpoint – change in body composition assessments 
Changes in total body fat mass (g) at week 34 compared to baseline for somapacitan, somatropin, and 
placebo treatment were -85.47, -855.71, and +305.47. Hence, in line with the primary endpoint, observed 
differences compared to baseline were smaller for somapacitan as compared to somatropin. Similar results 
were obtained with respect to most other body composition endpoints. 
As an exception, changes in total lean body mass (g) at week 34 compared to baseline were similar for 
somapacitan (+1395.88), and somatropin (+1359.33) (estimated treatment difference 49 (95% CI -513; 
610), p= 0.87), though differences tended to be larger for somapacitan as compared to placebo and placebo 
(+334.43) (estimated treatment difference 1144 (95% CI 459; 1829), p= 0.001)).  
Secondary endpoint – quality of life assessments  
The quality of life assessments (SF-36, TRIM-AGHD, and TSQM-9) did not show any clinically relevant 
difference between treatment arms (placebo, somapacitan and daily somatropin). 
In the extension treatment period body composition endpoints were compared between a 
somapacitan/somapacitan arm (n= 120) and a smaller somatropin/ somatropin arm (n= 52). Observed 
treatment effects with respect to endpoints related to fat mass in the main treatment period were maintained 
throughout the extension treatment period. Reductions in truncal fat percentage (-2.63 vs. -1.63%), body fat 
mass (-923.01 vs. -118.07 g), and truncal body fat mass (-685.56 vs. -196.18 g) tended to be larger for 
patients treated with somatropin in both parts of study 4054. For the quality of life assessments (SF-36, 
TRIM-AGHD, and TSQM-9) no consistent trends were observed between the somapacitan/somapacitan and 
somatropin/somatropin treatment regimens.  
Due to the small somatropin/somatropin group (n= 52), the results should be interpreted with caution.  
Though this is acknowledged, changes with respect to lean body mass and bone mineral content endpoints 
tended to be larger for study patients treated with somapacitan/somapacitan (n= 120) as compared to those 
treated with somatropin/somatropin (n= 52) during both the main and extension treatment period.  
In study patients treated with somatropin in the main treatment phase who were re-randomized to receive 
somapacitan in the extension treatment phase (N=51), decreases in truncal fat percentage compared to 
baseline tended to be larger during somatropin treatment (-2.28%) as compared to somapacitan treatment 
in the extension treatment period (-0.96%). 
Changes with respect to visceral adipose tissue correlated with IGF-I changes from baseline. This was 
observed both for somapacitan and somatropin. However, the clinical effects with respect to other adipose 
tissue parameters in the main phase of study 4054 for somapacitan were less pronounced than those of 
somatropin, although the mean IGF-I SDS levels were similar for somapacitan and somatropin. Therefore, 
there is a loss of chance to achieve significant clinical outcomes for patients treated with somapacitan 
compared to patients treated with somatropin.  
Further, a discrepancy was observed in trends in the overall study population with respect to endpoints 
pertaining to adipose tissue masses and endpoints pertaining to lean body masses for somapacitan and 
somatropin treatment. Overall, the clinical effects of somapacitan with respect to adipose tissue masses 
tended to be smaller compared to those of somatropin, and this was considered a major concern at D150, 
whereas the clinical effects of both active substances were comparable with respect to lean body masses. An 
Assessment report

explanation and additional analyses were requested because of this finding. The applicant provided several 
explanations for the limited effects of somapacitan on adipose tissue masses observed in study 4054.  
First, some AGHD subgroups (e.g. women, women on oral oestrogen, childhood-onset AGHD) are less 
sensitive to the effects of somapacitan. For patients in the transition age, higher doses are also needed. 
Second, a considerable proportion of study patients (22%) in the somapacitan group did not reach the 
predefined IGF-I SDS target in the main study phase. Another factor that might explain the less pronounced 
clinical effects of somapacitan with respect to fat parameters compared to somatropin, is a lower affinity of 
somapacitan to adipose tissue. This affinity may be lower for somapacitan as compared to somatropin due to 
the albumin binding moiety in somapacitan28. Differential effects of somapacitan on different adipose tissues 
could also partly be explained by different expression of the IGF-I receptor and growth hormone receptor. 
This might explain the differential effects of growth hormone in various tissues.  
A potential explanation for the difference of clinical effects of the somapacitan and somatropin on adipose 
tissue parameters is that various adipose tissue depots may manifest differing exposure-response and 
absolute exposures of somapacitan or somatropin such that the relative efficacy of the two products differs. 
Hence, the growth hormone exposure-response in adipose tissues is depot-specific with a lower growth 
hormone exposure needed to produce clinical effects in visceral adipose tissue as compared to other adipose 
tissue depots. Moreover, different absolute exposure of somapacitan versus somatropin may be present in 
different tissues, including adipose tissues. This might also explain that some subsets of patients who need 
higher doses of somapacitan such as women on oral oestrogen therapy and childhood-onset AGHD patients 
have a lower response on adipose tissue parameters.  
Post-hoc analyses in which the clinical effects of weekly somapacitan were compared with those of daily 
somatropin treatment in different AGHD subgroups indicated that the effects on both lean body masses and 
adipose masses were comparable for those patients who achieved an IGF-I SDS level between 0 and +2. The 
results of the post-hoc analyses should be interpreted with caution due to inherent statistical/methodological 
limitations of the nature of a post-hoc analysis. Despite this, the dissociation between the effects of 
somapacitan and somatropin on lean body and adipose masses as observed in study 4054 appears to be 
driven by AGHD study patients with a less optimal titration (i.e. patients with IGF-I SDS levels below 0) 
within a fixed 8-week dose titration period. This observation is in line with the assumption that the exposure-
response relationship differs for various adipose tissue depots and lean body mass compartments. 
Further, the post-hoc analyses and also exposure-response evaluations show that IGF-I SDS levels within the 
IGF-I target range between 0 and +2 can be achieved in the vast majority of AGHD patients upon 
appropriate somapacitan dose titration. According to conducted post-hoc analyses, the duration of the 
somapacitan dose titration period that is needed to achieve IGF-I levels within the IGF-I target range varies 
between AGHD patients. This period may be longer than 8 weeks in some patients. Considering the 
adherence to somapacitan is in general appropriate, but also that the target IGF-I SDS range was not 
achieved in about 20% of study patients treated with somapacitan, there is more room for improvement of 
the clinical efficacy by optimization of the dosing regimen of somapacitan than by improvement of its 
treatment adherence.  
Hence, clinical efficacy of somapacitan is expected to increase upon application of a more flexible, optimized 
somapacitan dosing regimen in individual AGHD patients, which allows somapacitan dose titration beyond 8 
weeks until the target IGF-I SDS range of 0 up to +2 or maximal recommended somapacitan dosing (8

mg/week) is achieved. This as well as the appropriateness of recommended posology of somapacitan will be 
evaluated further in different subgroups of AGHD patients in a post-approval safety study (PASS). 
Additional expert consultation 
Considering major uncertainties with respect to the favourable effects and safety, an ad hoc expert group 
(AHEG) was consulted on 29th of October 2020. Efficacy questions and answers are listed below, while safety 
question is below under Discussion on clinical safety.  
Efficacy 
1.  Please discuss if the efficacy has been sufficiently demonstrated by the currently available 
data and if new data are needed to substantiate an optimized dosing regimen. Please discuss 
if it would be sufficient to measure (change in) IGF-1 in patients receiving this optimized 
dosing regimen - as a surrogate marker for the expected clinical benefit? If so, what would be 
the clinically relevant target levels of IGF-1? 
There was clear evidence of efficacy in AGHD patients with regard to reduction of percentage of truncal fat; 
however, body fat mass in grams did not change significantly at week 34 comparing weekly vs placebo. Truncal 
body fat mass in grams, showed a trend to decrease, not reaching significance (p=0.08); additionally there 
were highly significant reductions of visceral adipose tissue (p=0.002), android fat mass (p=0.03), and increase 
in  truncal  lean  body  mass  (LBM)  (p=0.04),  appendicular  skeletal  muscle  mass  (p=0.0001),  and  total  LBM 
(p=0.001). At week 87 (extension phase), no significant differences were observed between daily and weekly 
GH on estimated LBM and truncal fat %, although there was a trend for more improvement after daily GH. 
The AHEG experts are of the opinion that dosing regimen in terms of titration duration and administered dose 
was not optimized for all AGHD patients’ subgroups (e.g. women on oral oestrogens). The experts commented 
that in these subgroups who require higher doses and longer titration time to define the optimal dose, additional 
data  are  generated  in  the  post-authorization  settings  to  confirm  expectation  of  greater  effects  with  higher 
dosing, currently supported by presented modelling and simulation data, and with longer titration period.  
Measuring only change in IGF-I concentration, as a pharmacodynamic marker, in AGHD patients receiving this 
optimized  somapacitan  once  weekly  dosing  regimen  is  not  considered  to  be  sufficient  evidence  of  expected 
clinical  benefit.  In  line  with  the  existing  AGHD  treatment  guidelines29,30,  this  should  be  accompanied  with 
collecting data on changes in body composition and also metabolic improvements, with clinically relevant target 
levels of IGF-I defined as 0 to +2 SDS, as well as some measure of patients preference using adequate PROM.  
2.  How  does  the  AHEG  judge  the  clinical relevance  of  the  observed  effects  with somapacitan in 
terms of change in body composition? Could greater effects be expected with higher doses as 
argued by the Applicant and, if yes, to what extent, based on the simulated treatment regimen; 
using continued titration towards an IGF-1 target of 0 to +2 SDS with a maximum dose of 8 mg, 
as provided by the Applicant? 
The AHEG experts consider that observed effects with once weekly somapacitan in terms of change in body 
composition vs. placebo are clinically relevant and convincing, and in the same direction as with daily dosed

somatropin in terms of improvements in lean body mass parameters, although some parameters seemed to 
improve more with daily than with weekly GH. It was observed that some patients were not treated optimally 
and would need longer uptitration period to reach optimal and higher dose, with maximum acceptable dose of 
8 mg, and in those AGHD patients greater effects could be expected upon treatment optimization towards an 
IGF-I  target  of  0  to  +2  SDS.  Initial  treatment  dose  and  titration  duration  should  be  carefully  individualized 
considering age, gender, previous GH replacement therapy, childhood or adult AGHD onset and other AGHD 
patient  characteristics.  Women  using  oral  oestrogen  medications  are  recommended  to  start  treatment  with 
higher  doses  and  would  likely  need longer  period  to  define optimal dose in  clinical  practice.  Alternatively,  a 
change from oral to transderrmal or vaginal estrogens would increase IGF-I values to the expected levels, as 
stated in the AGHD guidelines. 
3.  What  is  the  AHEGs’  view  on  the  value  for  patients of  having  a  weekly  injectable  somatropin 
available, also taking the strength and the relevance of the reported health-related quality of 
life outcomes into account?  
Perceived convenience and the QoL impact on a patient might be different for individual patients. Some may 
find daily dosing better e.g. fixed daily timings for drug administration easier to remember. While other patients 
might prefer a  weekly dosing medication e.g. less frequent self-injecting administration experienced as less 
burdensome,  for  convenience  reasons  (e.g.  with  regards  to  travelling,  being  less  reminded  of  their  illness). 
Therefore  availability  of  once  weekly  injectable  somatropin  is  considered  to  be  of  value  for  the  majority  of 
AGHD patients.  
The generic SF-36 questionnaire showed a trend to improve at week 34 vs. baseline for somapacitan vs placebo, 
with some significant improvement in 2 subscales in favor of somapacitan. The disease specific questionnaire 
TRIM-AGHD showed no difference between daily and weekly GH. However, the change from baseline to week 
34  was  greater  with  daily  than  with  weekly  GH,  but  the  changes  observed  were  small,  below  what  was 
considered the minimal important difference of 10 points. 
Overall  satisfaction  at  week  34  was  greater  for  somapacitan than  placebo  (p=0.03),  without  differences  for 
effectiveness and convenience scores. Comparing both drugs, effectiveness was lower for weekly than for daily 
GH, without differences for convenience or global satisfaction. 
However,  by  company’s  presented  data  it  is  not  evidenced  that  once  weekly  injected  somapacitan  showed 
significant value for AGHD patients with regard to improvement of adherence to treatment or convenience vs 
once daily somatropin, although there was a trend in favor of weekly vs daily GH. At week 87 (extension phase) 
daily GH showed a minimally greater effect on PROM which did not reach the minimal important difference of 
10 points. As far as the convenience subscore of TSQM-9 at week 87 it was significantly better for weekly GH 
(p=0.01), without differences for effectiveness or global satisfaction. 
It is suggested by the AHEG that, in order to confirm a compliance claim, treatment compliance of once weekly 
injected somapacitan versus once daily injected somatropin is clarified in post-marketing settings in the context 
of AGHD patient characteristics such as age and other, including collected data on quality of life.  
4.  Some AGHD patients will not respond to growth hormone treatment. With respect to this, the 
CHMP has the following questions:  
a.  At what time after treatment initiation can it be concluded that AGHD patients do not 
respond to (weekly) growth hormone treatment? 
Assessment report  
EMA/95144/2021 
Page 100/129 
 
 
 
In the view of AHEG, once AGHD patients are adequately titrated to reach the optimal dose, response can be 
observed in the following subsequent 6 months of replacement treatment with growth hormone administered 
either as daily somatropin or as once weekly somapacitan. If clinical response is not observed within this period, 
only very rare individual AGHD patients would respond with measurable improvement of clinical parameters to 
a longer period of once weekly somapacitan treatment, in total up to 1 year after treatment start.  
b.  Which  clinical  parameters  should  be  taken  into  account  to  decide  that  an  AGHD 
patient’s response to growth hormone treatment is insufficient? 
According to the AHEG experts, sufficiency of clinical response to growth hormone and somapacitan treatment 
in AGHD patients should be decided based on measurements of IGF-I concentrations as a pharmacodynamic 
marker of somapacitan effects in AGHD, as  well as improvement in clinical parameters of body composition 
(e.g.  decreased  body  fat  mass,  increased  lean  body  mass,  abdominal  circumference  measurements)  and 
improvement of other metabolic parameters (such as fasting blood glucose, blood pressure, lipids). 
Certain AGHD patients treated with growth hormone could present in clinical practice with reporting only benefit 
in  parameters  such  as  self-perception  of  body  shape  or  improvement  in  quality  of  life  symptoms,  therefore 
these should be considered in addition. 
Safety 
5.   What is the view of the AHEG on the overall safety of somapacitan, including the long-term 
safety, in  the  target  population  for  which somapacitan is  intended  to  be  used,  taking  into 
consideration peak and trough IGF-1 levels and the unphysiological IGF-1 profiles obtained upon 
weekly administration of somapacitan compared with standard daily administration of somatropin. 
If  additional  safety  monitoring,  besides  standard  routine  pharmacovigilance  is  considered 
necessary, which  would  be  the  key  design  characteristics  of  a  post  authorization safety  study to 
further investigate the long-term safety of the product? 
The AHEG experts shared the opinion that both somapacitan administered once weekly and daily administered 
somatropin  obtain  unphysiological  GH  concentration  profiles,  considering  their  pharmacokinetic  differences 
compared to peak and trough physiological concentration of endogenously released growth hormone. Although 
the experts do not expect additional safety concerns including long-term safety with once weekly somapacitan 
than with daily somatropin. they are of the view that somapacitan should not be initiated or continued in AGHD 
patients with any tumors to avoid possibility of any growth of tumor cells, or in patients with any other severe, 
uncontrolled underlying disease, as stated in the guidelines.   
The AHEG experts do find it important that physicians who initiate and monitor growth hormone treatment of 
AGHD patients need to be trained on PK differences between daily somatropin and once weekly somapacitan 
treatment,  including  the  appropriate  time  to  collect  blood  samples  following  once  weekly  somapacitan 
subcutaneous  injection  (Day  3  or  Day  4  depending  on  the  evidence  of  pharmacodynamics)  to  assure 
appropriate  measurement  of  its  pharmacodynamic  effects  on  the  IGF-I  concentration.  The  company  must 
provide clear information on this and ensure training of potential prescribers. 
As far as additional safety monitoring for somapacitan, it is recommended that the key design characteristics 
of  such  post-authorization  study  should  follow  AGHD  treatment  guidelines  regarding  clinical  parameters  to 
evaluate GH treatment effects such as normalization of circulating IGF-I concentration (target of 0 to +2 SDS) 
and other body composition improvements, as well as metabolic changes. The AHEG experts commented that 
in these subgroups who require higher doses and longer titration time to define the optimal dose, additional 
Assessment report

data are generated in the post-authorization study (see above Question 1) and also, in order to confirm a claim 
regarding improved treatment adherence, this should be followed and evaluated with validated questionnaire 
in AGHD patients (see above Question 3). 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
No studies in children were submitted. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Somapacitan exerts clinical effects on body composition parameters like human growth hormone. However, 
in conducted pivotal clinical study, the clinical efficacy of weekly somapacitan was less pronounced compared 
to daily somatropin treatment in the secondary comparison, especially concerning adipose tissue-related 
body composition parameters. Certain lower effects of somapacitan may be explained - at least in part - by 
the fact that the IGF-I SDS target range was not achieved in a considerable proportion of AGHD study 
patients. This applies especially to particular AGHD subgroups who are less sensitive to growth hormone such 
as female AGHD patients on oral oestrogen. This was acknowledged by the AHEG who considered additional 
clinical data are required in this subgroup of patients. 
Moreover, in the secondary comparison a dissociation between the clinical effects of somapacitan and 
somatropin on adipose tissue parameters (less pronounced for somapacitan) and lean body mass parameters 
(comparable for both treatments) was observed. However, post-hoc analyses in which the clinical effects of 
weekly somapacitan were compared with those of daily somatropin treatment in different AGHD subgroups 
indicated that the clinical effects of these treatments on both lean body masses and adipose masses were 
comparable for those patients who achieved a IGF-I SDS level between 0 and +2 within or beyond 8 weeks 
of dose titration. Hence, clinical efficacy of somapacitan is expected to increase upon application of a more 
flexible, optimized somapacitan dosing regimen in individual AGHD patients, which allows somapacitan dose 
titration beyond 8 weeks until the target IGF-I SDS range of 0 up to +2 or maximal recommended 
somapacitan dosing (8 mg/week) is achieved. It is at present unclear whether these results can also be 
achieved and maintained at an acceptable safety level upon application of such a somapacitan dosing 
regimen in (different subgroups of) AGHD patients in clinical practice. For this reason, short- and long-term 
clinical effects of recommended somapacitan dosing regimen in actual AGHD patients, also in those who are 
less sensitive to the clinical effects of growth hormone such as female AGHD patients on oral oestrogen, will 
be evaluated further in a PASS. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The phase 3 studies (4054, 4043 and 4244) included 333 AGHD patients exposed to once-weekly 
somapacitan (mean dose: 2.38 mg/week), 166 patients to daily somatropin (mean dose: 0.29 mg/day) and 
61 patients to placebo. Total exposure was 363.7 person-years of exposure (PYE) for somapacitan, 152.6 PYE 
for somatropin, and 38.2 PYE for placebo.

Of the 333 AGHD patients exposed to somapacitan, 319 (95.8%) patients were exposed for more than 6 
months, 253 (76.0%) patients for more than 12 months, and 109 (32.7%) patients for more than 18 
months. In addition, 143 healthy subjects, 29 subjects with renal impairment, 18 subjects with hepatic 
impairment, and 34 AGHD patients were exposed to somapacitan in the clinical pharmacology studies. After 
IGF-I SDS dose titration the mean somapacitan dose was 2.38 mg/week (0.036 mg/kg/week).  
A total of 166 AGHD patients were exposed to daily somatropin treatment as an active comparator in the 
completed clinical studies in AGHD (up to 86 weeks of exposure). The mean somatropin dose was 0.29 
mg/day (0.005 mg/kg/day). 
A total of 61 AGHD patients were exposed to placebo.

Seventeen percent of patients exposed to somapacitan (58/333) received the maximum dose range (between 
4 and 8 mg per week). By contrast, only 7% of patients exposed (12/166) to somatropin received the 
maximum patients for the last dose range) (between 4.2 and 7.7 mg per week).  
Adverse events 
A total of 382 (84.1%) patients reported 2344 adverse events (AEs). A similar percentage of patients 
reported AEs across treatment groups (somapacitan: 82.6%; somatropin: 78.3%; placebo: 75.4%). The 
majority of the AEs (96.6 %) were non-serious.  
The most commonly reported AEs (not necessarily treatment-related AE) in the somapacitan group were 
nasopharyngitis (25.2%), headache (12.9%) and arthralgia (6.9%). Further, upper respiratory tract 
infection, fatigue and arthralgia were frequently reported in the various studies.  
The most commonly reported treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were headache (3.0%), arthralgia (2.7%), 
fatigue (2.7%), and peripheral oedema (2.1%).  
During the main treatment phase of study 4054 “back pain” tended to be reported more frequently during 
somapacitan treatment (9.2%) than during placebo treatment (3.3%) (rate difference 8.7 (95% CI -2.0 up to 
19.5%)). “Back pain” is an adverse drug reaction for some somatropin medicinal products (e.g. NutropinAq 
(EMEA/H/C/000315)). It is unknown whether this also applies to somapacitan, but these reactions are more 
likely related to arthralgia.  
Possibly or probably study treatment-related AEs reported in the whole safety analysis set (all studies) are 
presented in Table 20. No apparent treatment-related trend in frequency, severity, type, or time of onset of 
AEs was observed. The safety profile of once-weekly somapacitan was similar to that of daily somatropin 
treatment.

Upon a later review of the safety data on potential adverse drug reactions of somapacitan, the applicant 
proposed to add several new adverse drug reactions for somapacitan with respect to several system organ 
classes: 
- Endocrine disorders: hypothyroidism (1.8%, common) 
- Musculo-skeletal and connective tissue disorders: myalgia (2.1%, common), muscle stiffness (1.2%, 
common) and joint stiffness (0.6%, uncommon) 
- Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: rash (1.8%, common), urticaria (1.5%, common) and pruritus 
(0.9%, uncommon). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
Five (5, 1.3%) patients died during study 4054. All 5 deaths were assessed by the investigator as unlikely to 
be related to study products (somapacitan: 2 patients; somatropin: 2 patients; placebo: 1 patient). Details 
on the 5 deaths are provided in Table 21. According to the investigator and applicant, these deaths were 
unlikely related to GH.  
There was no pattern in the types of AEs in the patients who died or time to event.  
No deaths were reported in studies 4043 and 4244. No deaths were reported in the clinical pharmacology 
studies (studies 3915, 3947, 4237, 4297 and 4298).

Serious adverse events (SAEs) 
A total of 47 (10.4%) patients experienced 79 SAEs in the phase 3 clinical studies in AGHD, with 77 of 79 
SAEs evaluated by the investigator to be unlikely related to study treatment. Overall, the percentage of 
patients reporting SAEs was similar for somapacitan (8.7% patients), somatropin (9.6% patients), and 
placebo (8.2% patients).  
The SAEs were observed most frequently within the first year of treatment in the somapacitan group (within 
the first 3-6 months in the somatropin group). 
The majority of the SAEs were recorded as single events in 1 or 2 patients and across different system organ 
classes (SOCs). During somapacitan treatment, gastroenteritis was reported in 3 patients (0.9%). Vomiting, 
inguinal hernia, acute adrenocortical insufficiency and fatigue are reported in 2 patients (0.6%) During 
somatropin treatment nephrolithiasis was reported in 2 patients (1.2%).  
Two (2) SAEs in study 4054 were evaluated by the investigator to be possibly or probably related to study 
product. One patient with high grade papillary urothelial carcinoma diagnosed after about 2.5 years of GH 
treatment. The other patient reported high haematocrit, haemoglobin and red blood cell count and was also 
treated with testosterone containing medicinal products. The diagnoses of a malignancy in this limited

population after 2.5 years of treatment adds to the concerns considering the long-term safety. The 
development of benign and malignant neoplasms will be evaluated in a post-approval safety study (PASS) 
with respect to somapacitan. 
IGF-I and standardised IGF-I (IGF-I SDS) 
As the mean dose administered in the Phase 3 studies was 0.036 ± 0.027 mg/kg/week (mean ± SD) it is not 
to be expected that the mean IGF-I SDS will be above 2. This is also confirmed in the model for IGF-I. 
However, given the variation a considerable proportion of patients might experience higher levels of IGF-I 
(>2 SDS). IGF-I levels above the physiological range for a longer duration of time may be a potential safety 
concern and IGF-I concentrations should therefore be monitored as standard practice. A titration scheme is 
included in the SmPC (section 4.2) mitigating the risk of sustained IGF-I concentrations above the 2 SDS. 
It is not to be expected that a temporary increase of IGF-I will result in any acute safety issue (possible a 
temporally induction of type 2 diabetes mellitus). Of more concern is the chronic overdosing of growth 
hormone with the resulting IGF-I levels above 2 SDS. There were no patients with sustained IGF-I SDS above 
+2. However, the submitted data suggest that under somapacitan treatment more patients have temporarily 
IGF-I levels above 2 SDS. This is of concern as IGF-I repeatably above 2 SDS is thought to increase the long-
term safety risks of GH treatment. 
Among AGHD study patients exposed to somapacitan in study 4054, 3% (4 of 120) and 5% (11 of 220) 
patients had an IGF-I SDS above +2 at more than one visit during the titration period of the main and 
extension study phase, respectively. A slightly lower proportion of patients had an IGF-I SDS above +2 in the 
fixed dose period of the main phase (4%) versus the extension phase (6%) of study 4054.  
During the titration periods in study 4054, an IGF-I value below the reference range of -2 SDS at one or 
more titration visits was reported for 42% of somapacitan-treated AGHD study patients in the main 
treatment phase and 37% of somapacitan-treated AGHD study patients in the extension treatment phase. 
There was a reduction in the number of patients with IGF-I SDS values below -2 from the first to last titration 
visit for both the main (visit 4: 37.5%, visit 10: 15.8%) and extension study phase (visit 17: 30.0%, visit 23: 
15.9%). 
If one dose is missed, the concentration of somapacitan will decrease, but is expected to be completely 
restored 2 weeks (i.e. week 3) after the missed dose. The IGF-I levels are also expected to decrease, but 
regular steady-state profiles are expected to be almost completely restored 2 weeks after the missed dose. 
In case of a missed dose the IGF-I SDS approaches the -2 SDS diminishing the effect of growth hormone for 
a considerable time.  
Laboratory findings 
Apart from some clinical relevant changes reported for one patient only no clinical relevant changes in 
standard haematology or biochemistry parameters were reported in more than one patient.  
No clinically relevant changes from baseline in vital signs (mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure and 
pulse) were observed following multiple-dose exposure of somapacitan in AGHD patients in any of the phase 
3 studies (studies 4054, 4043 and 4244). Similar mean values were observed for somapacitan and 
somatropin.

ECG 
The potential effect of somapacitan on cardiac repolarisation was accessed based on ECGs collected in the 
Phase 3 study 4054. The ECGs were collected at baseline and close to the expected time of Cmax for 
somapacitan  
Across treatment groups, the majority (>96%) of the patients had ECG readings with QTcF intervals 
≤450 msec, and no subjects had QTcF intervals >500 msec.  
One subject (in the placebo group) had an ECG reading with a QTcF interval of 481−500 msec. The subject 
had experienced an increase in the QTcF interval of 26 msec compared to baseline. Concomitant medication 
(amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic agent known to cause prolongation of action potential duration) might have 
contributed to the prolonged QTcF interval >480 msec. 
Across treatment groups, the majority (≥96%) of the patients had QTcF interval changes ≤30 msec and no 
subjects had a QTcF increase of >60 msec. 
Overall, there were no clinically relevant changes in ECG during study 4054 and no clinically relevant 
differences in ECG results between somapacitan, somatropin, and placebo. 
Safety in special populations 
Gender 
Similar trends were observed by gender as in the pooled Phase 3 data. There were no specific safety 
concerns observed in the AE profile by gender based on the pooled global Phase 3 data. The percentage of 
women with AEs (88.8%) appeared to be greater than observed in men (76.2%). In line with this, the 
number of AEs per 100 person years was 464.9 for women versus 280.6 for men. This gender difference was 
also observed with daily somatropin treatment. Although somapacitan doses were lower in women without 
oral oestrogen therapy compared to women on oral oestrogen therapy, there was a higher rate of AEs in 
women not on oral oestrogen therapy compared to those on oral oestrogen therapy. 
Age 
In AGHD patients aged ≥65 years, there was a higher event rate of AEs across all treatment groups than in 
patients aged <65 years, especially for somatropin. However, a similar percentage of patients experienced 
possibly related AEs in the two age groups. This was not the case in the somatropin group, where probably 
related AEs were more frequent in the patients aged ≥65 years than observed in the patients aged <65 years. 
Childhood-onset versus adulthood-onset AGHD 
Overall, patients with adulthood-onset of GH reported more AE as compared to patients with childhood-onset 
of GHD (for both somapacitan as for somatropin). Such a pattern has been observed with respect to other 
growth hormone medicinal products. There were no specific safety concerns observed in the AE profile by 
GHD onset based on the pooled global Phase 3 data.  
BMI 
As requested, the applicant also provided safety data per body mass index (BMI) on the following ranges: 
normal (<25 kg/m²), overweight (25- <30), obese (30 - <40), and very obese (≥40 kg/m²). Overall, these 
results do not show any new safety concern for these subgroups no matter how the data were pooled (pooled 
global data and by trial, by category of AEs and by SOC, per dose range). It should be noted that overweight 
Assessment report  
EMA/95144/2021 
Page 108/129 
 
 
 
and obese patients were approximately equally represented (respectively 91 and 91 patients of 333 patients 
exposed to somapacitan) and that AEs (and SAEs) were generally more observed in overweight patients for a 
dose between 2 and 4 mg. Regarding very obese patients, the low number of patients (13/333 patients) does 
not allow to conclude that the safety profile is quite similar regardless of the weight category.  
Immunological events 
No anti-somapacitan antibodies were detected after treatment with somapacitan in healthy adults or AGHD 
patients in the 7 completed clinical studies (not assessed in study 4237).  
No anti-GH antibodies were detected after treatment with somatropin in AGHD patients in the 4 completed 
clinical studies, except one patient with a single (transient) positive anti-GH test at week 4 (titration period) 
and then none thereafter in study 4054 (main phase). 
The  applicant  acknowledged  that  although  antibodies  were  not  observed  in  the  clinical  studies,  they  could 
reasonably be expected, especially if a lack of efficacy is suspected. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The known drug interactions for growth hormone are reported; decreased conversion of cortisone to cortisol 
increased extrathyroidal conversion of T4 to T3, growth hormone insensitivity in women on oestrogen 
treatment, and decreased insulin sensitivity. In addition, an interaction between testosterone and 
somapacitan cannot be ruled out on the basis of reported cases. Proper warnings are included in the SmPC to 
mitigate the risks related to these pharmacodynamic interactions. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the studies 4054 and 4043, the withdrawal rate for AGHD patients exposed to somapacitan was 4.5–5.8% 
whereas in the same studies withdrawal rate of 9.7 to 13.5% for somatropin. In total, 7 out of 333 patients 
exposed to somapacitan discontinued treatment due to AEs, where 6 out of 166 patients on somatropin 
treatment discontinued treatment due to AEs. Adverse events leading to discontinuation during somapacitan 
treatment were gastro-enteritis, mild weight increase and oedema, abnormal ECG, nasopharyngitis, common 
cold with fever, pituitary tumour, thyroid disorder, plasma cell myeloma, fatigue, asthenia and disturbance in 
attention. Discontinuations due to adverse events during somatropin treatment were diabetes (n=2); 
gastroenteritis; haemo-concentration (i.e. increased haematocrit, red cell count and haemoglobin 
concentration); dermatitis atopic, asthenia, somnolence, disturbance in attention, headache, and difficult 
phlebotomy. 
No apparent difference in discontinuation due to AEs (not necessarily TEAES) between somapacitan and 
somatropin was observed.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Three hundred thirty-three (333) patients were exposed to somapacitan in the Phase 3 studies. Additionally, 
143 healthy volunteers, 29 subjects with renal insufficiency and 18 patients with hepatic impairment were 
exposed to somapacitan. Of the patients exposed to somapacitan, 253 (76.0%) patients were treated for 
more than 12 months. Considering the necessary lifelong treatment with GH, the number of patients that has 
been treated for more than 12 months is very limited. However, the (short-term) safety of somapacitan 
might be mirrored to the general safety information of growth hormone. The short-term safety obtained with 
somapacitan seems comparable to that of other growth hormone-containing products. With respect to the 
long-term safety (i.e. after 10 or more years of treatment) no conclusions could be drawn based on the 
limited duration of exposure in conducted studies. The non-physiologic exposure with GH replacement 
therapy to both growth hormone and IGF-I gave rise to uncertainties considering the long-term safety.  
Seventeen percent of patients exposed to somapacitan (58/333) received the maximum dose range (between 
4 and 8 mg per week). By contrast, only 7% of patients exposed (12/166) to somatropin received the 
maximum dose range (between 4.2 and 7.7 mg per week). Although these results should not be directly 
compared due to high level of inter-individual variability and different arm sizes (166 patients with 
somatropin, 333 patients with somapacitan), it could question the efficacy of somapacitan at low doses and 
could consolidate the hypothesis that somapacitan in higher doses results in lower efficacy than somatropin 
in lower doses.   
After IGF-I SDS dose titration the mean somapacitan dose was 2.38 mg/week (0.036 mg/kg/week). The 
mean daily somatropin dose was 2.03 mg/week (0.035 mg/kg/week, in accordance to the SmPC). On a 
weight basis comparable amounts of active substance were administered.  
The most commonly reported AEs in the somapacitan group were nasopharyngitis (25.2%), headache 
(12.9%) and arthralgia (6.9%). The AE profile of once-weekly somapacitan was overall similar to that of 
existing GH products for daily administration (e.g., somatropin) and included the class effects for GH in AGHD 
(e.g., headache, arthralgia, fatigue, and oedema peripheral). The majority of AEs were reported in less than 
5% of the patients, were non-serious, of mild/moderate severity and reported as unlikely to be related to the 
study treatment.  
Five (5, 1.3%) patients died during study 4054. All 5 deaths were assessed by the investigator as unlikely to 
be related to study treatment: 2 patients (one case treated with placebo/somapacitan died due to ventricular 
fibrillation, cardiogenic shock and pneumonia aspiration the other case treated with daily 
somatropin/somapacitan died due to an unknown cause); daily somatropin: 2 patients (one case treated with 
daily somatropin died influenza the other case treated with daily somatropin/daily somatropin died due to 
pneumonia); placebo: one patient died due to acute adrenocortical insufficiency). There was no pattern in the 
types of AEs in the patients who died or time to event.  
A total of 47 (10.4%) patients experienced 79 SAEs in the phase 3 clinical studies in AGHD, with 77 of 79 
SAEs evaluated by the investigator to be unlikely related to study product. The percentage of patients 
reporting SAEs was similar for somapacitan (8.7% patients), daily somatropin (9.6% patients) and placebo 
(8.2% patients). During somapacitan treatment, gastroenteritis was reported in 3 patients (0.9%). Vomiting, 
inguinal hernia, acute adrenocortical insufficiency and fatigue are reported in 2 patients (0.6%) none of the 
remaining SAE’s were reported in more than one patient. No SAEs were reported following somapacitan 
single- and/or multiple-dose administrations in healthy subjects or subjects with renal impairment (study 
3915; study 4237; study 4298). During daily somatropin treatment nephrolithiasis was reported in 2 patients 
(1.2%).

Modelling of the IGF-I response indicates that after the initial titration the 95% CI is well within the 2 SDS 
level for IGF-I. However, given the variation a considerable proportion of patients might experience higher or 
lower levels of IGF-I (above or below 2 SDS). IGF-I levels above the physiological range for a longer duration 
of time may be a potential safety concern and IGF-I concentrations should therefore be monitored as 
standard practice. A titration scheme is included in the SmPC (section 4.2) mitigating the risk of sustained 
IGF-I concentrations above the 2 SDS. 
It is not to be expected that a temporary increase of IGF-I will result in any acute safety issue. Of more 
concern is the chronic overdosing of growth hormone with the resulting IGF-I levels above +2 SDS. IGF-I 
SDS levels above +2 were observed in about 5% of AGHD patients at the applied somapacitan dosing 
regimen in study 4054. Respective proportion could increase upon application of a prolonged somapacitan 
dose titration period in which higher somapacitan dosing may be recommended to AGHD patients. In the 
SmPC instructions have been included to minimalize the risk of chronic overtreatment with growth hormone.  
If one dose is missed, the concentration of somapacitan will decrease, but is expected to be completely 
restored 2 weeks (i.e. week 3) after the missed dose upon subsequent continued dosing. The IGF-I levels are 
also expected to decrease, but regular steady-state profiles are expected to be almost completely restored 2 
weeks after the missed dose. In case of a missed dose the IGF-I SDS approaches the -2 SDS diminishing the 
effect of growth hormone for a considerable time. The weekly IGF-I pattern (especially the Cmax, Cthrough and 
the un-physiologic weekly fluctuations) were not compared with normal physiology and after administration 
of daily somatropin. Further the consequences for the (long-term) safety (and efficacy) are not discussed 
(preferably including physiological conditions with comparable IGF-I patterns). Considering these 
uncertainties, long-term safety risks of weekly growth hormone supplementation should be evaluated in a 
PASS.  
The mean fasting blood glucose ranged from 4.9 to 5.2 mmol/l across treatment groups at baseline and after 
86 weeks of exposure. The mean HbA1c ranged from 5.4 to 5.5 % across treatment groups at baseline and 
after 86 weeks of exposure. Two (2) daily somatropin treated patients were diagnosed with diabetes during 
study 4054. No patient was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 2 during somapacitan treatment. 
There were no apparent clinically relevant changes in the clinical laboratory haematology or biochemistry 
parameters, vital signs or ECG assessed in AGHD patients or healthy subjects in any of the treatment 
groups/studies. 
Overall, the short-term safety of somapacitan was considered quite consistent across gender groups and age 
groups (over and under 65 years of age). Similar trends were observed by age as in the pooled Phase 3 data. 
There were no specific safety concerns observed in the AE profile by gender or age based on the pooled 
global Phase 3 data. The percentage of women with AEs appeared to be greater than observed in men. 
Patients with adulthood-onset GHD reported more AEs compared to patients with childhood-onset GHD across 
all treatment groups. However, the percentages of patients with SAEs and probably related events in the 
somapacitan group were similar for patients with adulthood-onset and childhood-onset GHD. 
Somapacitan was well tolerated in subjects with renal and/or hepatic impairment (mild, moderate, severe 
renal/hepatic impairment and subjects requiring haemodialysis treatment) as well as in subjects with normal 
renal/hepatic function after 3 once-weekly s.c. somapacitan administrations. 
There was no indication of increased risk of anti-somapacitan/anti-GH antibody development for somapacitan 
compared to daily somatropin in AGHD patients.

The known drug interactions for growth hormone are reported; decreased conversion of cortisone to cortisol, 
increased extra-thyroidal conversion of T4 to T3, growth hormone insensitivity in woman on oestrogen 
treatment and decrease insulin sensitivity. Likewise, testosterone levels may be modified. Warnings are 
included in the SmPC to mitigate the risks related to these pharmacodynamic interactions. 
In the studies 4054 and 4043 the withdrawal rate for AGHD patients exposed to somapacitan was 4.5–5.8% 
whereas in the same studies withdrawal rate of 9.7 to 13.5% for daily somatropin. In total, 7 out of 333 
patients exposed to somapacitan discontinued treatment due to AEs, whereas 6 out of 166 patients on daily 
somatropin treatment discontinued treatment due to AEs.  
No post-marketing safety data are available. 
Notwithstanding the limited information a comparable acute safety profile as compared to the currently 
available GH containing products can be assumed. The very limited information on long-term safety in this 
less physiological situation i.e. a more stable and less varying GH level and a more undulating IGF-I level on 
a daily base, was a reason for concern. The concerns focus but are not limited to the (possible) oncogenic 
potential of growth hormone, the development of diabetes mellitus type 2, and an increase of cardiovascular 
complications of over exposure. The applicant should acquire a more elaborate safety database post 
registration in order to obtain information on potential long-term safety risks such as the development of 
malignancies, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Long-term clinical effects of an optimized somapacitan dosing 
regimen resulting in higher somapacitan doses for (particular subgroups of) AGHD patients will therefore be 
evaluated in a category 3 PASS after marketing authorization (see clinical efficacy section).

An AHEG was consulted on 29th of October 2020 with efficacy and safety questions and answers listed above 
under Discussion on clinical efficacy.

No information on children is submitted. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Somapacitan dosed according to the titration scheme as defined in the pivotal study shows the well-known 
short-term safety profile from growth hormone. No unexpected safety issues are reported. Based on the 
limited data available, the short-term safety profile reported in the clinical studies of somapacitan is 
comparable with the safety profile reported for daily somatropin.  
The limited information on long-term safety in this unphysiological exposure (both growth hormone and IGF-I 
levels), as opposed to the daily variations seen in healthy volunteers, remains a concern. Therefore, the 
applicant should acquire a more elaborate safety database post-registration (PASS) in order to obtain 
information on the long-term safety in terms of malignancies, and the development of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (commitment). Further, as suggested by the experts and supported by the CHMP, the PASS 
(category 3) should also include measurements considering compliance and medication errors. The 
assessment of the medication errors is of interest because it might indicate the need for further educational 
material for health care professionals and patients. The applicant committed in the RMP to observe each

patient in the prospective somapacitan cohort as long as possible, i.e. until study end at 10 years, to achieve 
similar mean follow-up periods as in the NordiNet IOS and regarding the initiation of the PASS after approval 
of the detailed study protocol by EMA. The applicant included a commitment into the RMP that the PASS will 
not be initiated before approval of the detailed study protocol by EMA. With the ‘extended titration regimen’ 
as proposed by the applicant resulting in the use of higher doses of somapacitan and a longer titration 
duration, increased short-term safety issues (frequency and severity) cannot be anticipated especially in 
women on oral oestrogen therapy. Therefore, both short-term and long-term safety risks of an optimized 
somapacitan dosing regimen should be evaluated in women on oral oestrogen treatment in a PASS. This 
position is supported by the experts of the AHEG who require additional clinical data in this subgroup of 
patients.

2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that somapacitan has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in the 
European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers somapacitan to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Sogroya (somapacitan) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained 
in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
Somapacitan is a long-acting recombinant human GH derivative and indicated for the replacement of 
endogenous GH in adults with growth hormone deficiency (AGHD). 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Growth hormone (GH) deficiency is a rare disorder which affects both children and adults. It is characterized 
by inadequate systemic availability of GH due to inadequate secretion from the anterior pituitary gland or 
destruction of the gland. The incidence of GH deficiency in adults (AGHD) is about 1.90 for males and 1.42 
for females, per 100.000. AGHD may have either childhood or adulthood onset. 
As for human somatropin, the mechanism of action of somapacitan is either directly via binding to the GH 
receptor or indirectly via insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I).   
Assessment report  
EMA/95144/2021 
Page 118/129 
 
 
 
 
GH deficiency is associated with a broad range of signs and symptoms, including central adiposity, decreased 
muscle mass, decreased bone density, impaired cardiac function, decreased insulin sensitivity, changes in 
memory, processing speed and attention, lack of well-being, depression, anxiety, social isolation, fatigue, 
lack of strength, fibromyalgia syndrome, neuromuscular dysfunction, accelerated atherogenesis with 
increased carotid intima–media thickness, increased low-density lipoprotein, pro-thrombotic state, and 
decreased sweating and thermoregulation. 
The aetiology of GH deficiency can be congenital (resulting from genetic mutations, or from structural defects 
in the hypothalamic-pituitary areas of the brain), acquired (e.g. as result of traumatic brain injury, infection, 
radiation therapy, or tumour growth within the hypothalamic-pituitary areas of the brain) or idiopathic. GH 
deficiency may occur as an isolated hormonal deficiency or in combination with multiple pituitary hormone 
deficiencies (hypopituitarism).  
The most common causes of AGHD are damage to the pituitary gland or hypothalamus caused by a tumour 
(e.g., pituitary adenoma or craniopharyngioma), surgery or radiotherapy.  
The diagnosis of AGHD is established by provocative testing of GH secretion (e.g. insulin tolerance test, 
combined administration of arginine and GHRH).  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Once the diagnosis of AGHD is established, a replacement regimen with growth hormone should be instituted 
and titrated taking into account the clinical response and serum IGF-I levels. Several growth hormone 
products for the treatment of AGHD have been registered within the European Union (e.g. somatropin 
products Genotropin, Norditropin Flexpro and Norditropin Simplexx). These products typically require daily 
subcutaneous administration. Dosing of growth hormone products is targeted to achieve normal IGF-I levels 
(i.e. 0 or at least < 2 standard deviation scores (SDS)).  
Clinical studies using biosynthetic GH have confirmed that GH continues to play a role in optimizing health 
and well-being even after attainment of final adult height and has demonstrated that adults with long-
standing GH deficiency derive benefit from GH replacement. In general, women require higher doses of GH to 
achieve the same IGF-I response. GH secretion normally decreases with age. In addition, GH dose 
requirements are lower in older patients.  
Adverse events 
Common adverse effects of GH treatment include fluid retention (5–18%), hypertension, paresthesias, joint 
stiffness, peripheral oedema, arthralgia, myalgias, and carpal tunnel syndrome (2%). Adult patients who are 
older, heavier, or female are more prone to develop these complications. Most of these adverse reactions 
improve with dose reduction. Insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes can occur or worsen in patients with pre-
existing diabetes. Retinopathy, benign intracranial hypertension, and gynecomastia are rare.  Although there 
might have been some concern with respect to the risk of cancer with the use of GH therapy, an increase in 
the recurrence rates of either intracranial or extracranial tumours has not been demonstrated in AGHD. 
Unmet medical need  
Current GH therapy for AGHD is administered as daily s.c. injections and often necessitates many years or 
life-long treatment. The daily injections are a burden to the patients and may affect treatment adherence and 
thereby, treatment effectiveness.  
Assessment report  
EMA/95144/2021 
Page 119/129 
 
 
 
Within GH therapy, studies of AGHD patients have shown poor adherence. For example, a survey of 158 
AGHD patients who were receiving or had received GH therapy rated only 34% as ‘highly’ compliant31, and a 
retrospective single-centre cohort study classified compliance as <20% in approximately 9% of 179 AGHD 
patients.32 In addition, frequent pain from the injection, bruising and stinging can contribute to the burden 
associated with daily GH treatment.33   
A long-acting GH like somapacitan, which is suitable for once-weekly administration could possibly address an 
important problem with treatment adherence in chronic disease by reducing the number of required 
injections. In other chronic diseases, research indicates that reduced treatment frequency directly increases 
treatment adherence.34,35,36,37 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence of efficacy submitted is a single Phase III multicentre, randomized, parallel-group study 
(study 4054). The study (n= 300) was primarily designed to compare in a 34-week double-blind setting the 
efficacy and safety of once-weekly dosing of somapacitan with once-weekly dosing of placebo in AGHD 
patients who were growth hormone treatment-naïve or with no exposure to growth hormone or growth 
hormone secretagogues for at least 180 days prior to randomization. In a third study arm, the clinical effects 
of open-label daily treatment with somatropin product Norditropin were evaluated. After completion of this 
main treatment phase, study patients could enrol into a 53-week open-label extension period in which they 
were re-randomized to receive somapacitan or somatropin.  
The primary endpoint of the study was the change in truncal fat percentage from baseline to week 34 as 
determined by DXA. Secondary endpoints involved changes from baseline to week 34 with respect to other 
DXA endpoints, quality of life, and treatment satisfaction. In total, 300 patients were randomized to 
somapacitan (n= 120), somatropin (n= 119), or placebo (n=61) in the main treatment phase. In the 
extension treatment phase, 184 study patients were treated with either somapacitan (n= 132) or somatropin 
(n=52).  
In addition, two open-label supportive studies were conducted in AGHD patients who have been treated 
previously with growth hormone (studies 4244 (n= 62) and 4043 (n= 92)). Participants were randomized to 
receive weekly somapacitan or daily somatropin. Study 4244 (52 weeks) and study 4043 (26 weeks) 
consisted of a titration period (study 4244: 20 weeks, study 4043: 8 weeks), followed by a fixed-dose 
treatment period (study 4244: 32 weeks, study 4043: 18 weeks). Both studies were primarily developed for 
safety evaluations; secondary efficacy endpoints included changes at the end of compared to baseline 
concerning adipose tissue compartments (only study 4244) and TSQM-9 scores (both studies).

3.2.  Favourable effects 
A significant difference for the primary endpoint change at week 34 compared to baseline in truncal fat 
percentage’ was observed for somapacitan compared to placebo treatment. In line with this, changes 
compared to baseline with respect to body composition parameters, and treatment satisfaction, tended to be 
larger for somapacitan compared to placebo (see below).  
However, the body composition related endpoints are mostly in favour of the daily somatropin treatment 
compared to weekly somapacitan treatment.  
Change in body composition 
The change in truncal fat percentage at week 34 as compared to baseline was larger for somapacitan (-1.17) 
as compared to placebo treatment (+0.49) (estimated treatment difference -1.53 (95% CI -2.68; -0.38), p= 
0.009). The change in truncal fat percentage at week 34 as compared to baseline was lower for somapacitan 
(-1.17%) as compared to somatropin treatment -2.39%) (estimated treatment difference 1.17 (95% CI -
0.23; 2.11), p< 0.05). Similar results were obtained in several sensitivity analyses. 
Similar trends with respect to the primary endpoint were observed concerning age (≤ 64 years vs. 65 years 
and above), GHD onset (childhood- vs. adult-onset), and gender. 
Changes in total lean body mass (g) at week 34 compared to baseline were larger for somapacitan 
(+1395.88) compared to placebo (+334.43) (estimated treatment difference 1144 (95% CI 459; 1829), p= 
0.001). Observed changes with respect to this endpoint for somapacitan (+1395.88) and somatropin 
(+1359.33) were comparable (estimated treatment difference 49 (95% CI -513; 610), p= 0.87). Other 
changes in body composition were larger for somapacitan as compared to placebo treatment, except for 
changes in (truncal and gynoid) body fat mass (g).  
In the extension treatment period, the decrease in truncal fat percentage at week 87 as compared to baseline 
tended to be smaller in study patients treated with somapacitan (-1.63%) than those treated with somatropin 
(-2.63%) in the whole study period (estimated treatment difference 1.15% (95% CI -0.10; 2.40), p= 0.07). 
Similar trends were observed with respect to several particular fat masses (e.g. body fat mass, truncal body 
fat mass, android and gynoid body fat mass). In patients treated with somatropin in the main treatment 
phase who were re-randomized to receive somapacitan in the extension treatment phase (n =51), decreases 
in truncal fat percentage compared to baseline tended to be larger during somatropin treatment (-2.28%) as 
compared to somapacitan treatment in the extension treatment period (-0.96%).  
Changes concerning lean body mass and bone mineral content endpoints tended to be larger for study 
patients treated with somapacitan as compared to those treated with somatropin during both the main and 
extension treatment period.  
Changes in health-related quality of life 
Changes at week 34 compared to baseline for the total score of the TRIM-AGHD questionnaire tended to be 
smaller for somapacitan (-5.71) as compared to somatropin (-9.99) (estimated treatment difference 4.99 
(95% CI 1.84; 8.14), p= 0.002), though changes compared to baseline for the TRIM-AGHD questionnaire 
tended to be larger for somapacitan (-5.71) as compared to placebo (-3.65) (estimated treatment difference 
-2.83 (95% CI -6.72; 1.05), p= 0.15).  
Assessment report  
EMA/95144/2021 
Page 121/129 
 
 
 
Similar results concerning the TRIM-AGHD questionnaire were obtained in the extension treatment period for 
patients treated with somapacitan and somatropin during both the main and extension treatment period 
(estimated treatment difference total score week 87: 7.32 (95% CI 3.3; 11.3), p= 0.0003). 
Treatment adherence 
The majority of patients adhered to the planned treatment. The mean adherence tended to be higher with 
somapacitan (95.5%) than with somatropin (90.6%) in the main treatment phase (diary data). Adherence in 
the main treatment phase of study 4054 was ≥97.5 up to 100% in 78.3% of study patients treated with 
somapacitan and 73.9% of study patients treated with somatropin. The proportion of study patients who 
reported that the study treatment they received was convenient at week 34 tended to be higher among 
77.7% of somapacitan-treated and 73.9% of somatropin-treated study patients (estimated treatment 
difference 4.00 (95% CI -0.44; 8.39), p= 0.07).  
At week 87 of the extension treatment period, somapacitan-treated study patients (80.0%) reported a higher 
convenience of study treatment than somatropin-treated study patients (72.6%) (estimated treatment 
difference 7.09% (95% CI 1.7; 12.4), p= 0.01). 
Other endpoints 
For other endpoints such as SF-36 summary scores, lipid profile, cardiovascular parameters, body weight and 
waist circumference differences between somapacitan and placebo overall tended to be larger for 
somapacitan. However, observed changes overall tended to be smaller for somapacitan compared to 
somatropin treatment. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In the main treatment phase of study 4054, clinical effects of double-blind somapacitan and placebo 
treatment and open-label somatropin treatment were evaluated. Serious shortcomings in the ethical conduct 
of the study were identified at a GCP inspection however data reliability remain sufficient for interpretation in 
the context of this procedure.  
The  differences  in  clinical  effects  for  the  primary  and  secondary  endpoints  overall  tended  to  be  larger  for 
somapacitan compared to placebo in pivotal study 4054. Observed differences from baseline are however small 
(e.g. <2% for decreases in truncal fat percentage, <100 g in body fat mass compared to baseline). The lower 
efficacy of somapacitan in secondary comparison to somatropin on some fat parameters may be explained by 
the fact that the IGF-I SDS target range of -0.5 up to +1.75 was not achieved in 22% of study patients in the 
main treatment phase of study 4054. This proportion was even higher in subgroups of AGHD patients who are 
less sensitive to growth hormone treatment, such as women on oral oestrogen treatment (42%), and patients 
with  childhood-onset  AGHD  (34%).  AGHD  Study  patients  who  are  less  sensitive  to  the  effects  of  growth 
hormone treatment may have been unequally divided among the treatment arms.  
Comparisons between somapacitan and somatropin concerned secondary analyses. Although observed clinical 
effects  for  somapacitan  are  smaller  than  for  somatropin  respective  active  treatment  comparisons  should  be 
interpreted with caution since no definitive conclusions can be made based on these secondary analyses.   
The clinical effects of somapacitan with respect to adipose tissue masses overall tended to be smaller 
compared to those of somatropin, whereas the clinical effects of both active substances on lean body mass 
parameters were comparable. No consistent improvements were observed upon somapacitan treatment with 
Assessment report  
EMA/95144/2021 
Page 122/129 
 
 
 
 
respect to the quality of life and well-being as evaluated with SF-36, TRIM-AGHD, and TSQM-9 
questionnaires. The observed effects of somapacitan with respect to quality of life and well-being parameters 
were not consistently more pronounced compared to placebo, and not comparable with those of somatropin 
using the dosing regimen used in the pivotal clinical study.  
The applicant acknowledges that the somapacitan dosing regimen in conducted clinical studies was not 
appropriate. Post-hoc analyses in which the clinical effects of weekly somapacitan were compared with those 
of daily somatropin treatment in different AGHD subgroups indicated that the effects on both lean body 
masses and adipose masses were comparable for those patients who achieved an IGF-I SDS level between 0 
and +2. According to respective post-hoc simulation analyses the proportions of AGHD patients with IGF-I 
SDS levels above 0 will increase from about 80 to 90%, if somapacitan dose titration beyond 8 weeks would 
be allowed. Thus, appropriate individual somapacitan dose titration is essential.  
Hence, clinical efficacy of somapacitan is expected to increase upon application of a more flexible, optimized 
somapacitan dosing regimen in individual AGHD patients, which allows somapacitan dose titration beyond 8 
weeks until the target IGF-I SDS range of 0 up to +2 or maximal recommended somapacitan dosing (8 
mg/week) is achieved. It is at present however unclear whether these results can also be achieved and 
maintained at an acceptable safety level upon application of such a somapacitan dosing regimen in (different 
subgroups of) AGHD patients in clinical practice. For this reason, short- and long-term clinical effects of 
somapacitan and also the appropriateness of recommended somapacitan dosing regimen in actual AGHD 
patients will be evaluated further in a PASS. In respective PASS, AGHD patients who are less sensitive to the 
clinical effects of growth hormone such as female AGHD patients on oral oestrogen and patients with 
childhood onset GHD will be included. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Three hundred thirty-three (333) patients were exposed to somapacitan in the phase 3 studies besides these 
143 healthy volunteers, 29 subjects with renal insufficiency and 18 patients with hepatic impairment were 
exposed to somapacitan.  
The most commonly reported AEs in the somapacitan group were nasopharyngitis (25.2%), headache 
(12.9%) and arthralgia (6.9%). The most commonly reported TEAE were headache (3.0%), arthralgia 
(2.7%), fatigue (2.7%) and peripheral oedema (2.1%). The AE profile of once-weekly somapacitan was 
overall similar to that of existing GH products for daily administration (e.g., somatropin) and included the 
class effects for GH in AGHD (e.g., headache, arthralgia, fatigue and oedema peripheral). The majority of AEs 
were reported in less than 5% of the patients, were non-serious, of mild/moderate severity and reported as 
unlikely to be related to study products. 
Five (5, 1.3%) patients died during study 4054. All 5 deaths were assessed by the investigator as unlikely to 
be related to study products. Two (2) patients were treated with somapacitan, 2 with somatropin, and 1 with 
placebo. 
A total of 47 (10.4%) patients experienced 79 SAEs in phase 3 clinical studies in AGHD, with 77 of 79 SAEs 
evaluated by the investigator to be unlikely related to study product. The percentage of patients reporting 
SAEs was similar for somapacitan (8.7% patients), somatropin (9.6% patients) and placebo (8.2% patients).  
There were no apparent clinically relevant changes in the clinical laboratory haematology or biochemistry 
parameters, vital signs or ECG assessed in AGHD patients or healthy subjects in any of the treatment 
groups/studies.

There was no indication of increased risk of anti-somapacitan/anti-GH antibody development for somapacitan 
compared to somatropin in AGHD patients. 
The known drug interactions for growth hormone are reported; decreased conversion of cortisone to cortisol, 
increased extra-thyroidal conversion of T4 to T3, growth hormone insensitivity in women on oestrogen 
treatment and decrease insulin sensitivity. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety database, with 333 patients treated for about 1.5 year with about 76% of patients treated longer 
than 12 months is limited and does not allow for an assessment of a safety profile on its own assuming that 
somapacitan is a variant of the known daily growth hormone containing products registered, the safety 
information from these medicinal products is, to some extent, also helpful for the evaluation of safety risks in 
somapacitan-treated patients.  
The very limited information on the long-term safety of somapacitan in this less physiological situation, i.e. a 
more stable and less varying GH level and a more undulating IGF-I level is a reason for concern. It is unclear 
to what extent differences in plasma levels and administration frequency between once-weekly administered 
somapacitan and daily somatropin affect long-term safety of somapacitan. 
Modelling of the IGF-I response indicates that after the initial titration, the 95% CI is well within the 2 SDS 
level for IGF-I. However, IGF-I SDS levels above 2 were observed in about 5% of AGHD patients at the 
applied somapacitan dosing regimen in study 4054. On the other hand, nearly 16% of AGHD study patients 
had an IGF-I SDS < -2 at Ctrough at the end of the titration period in the main and extension treatment phases 
in study 4054. Thus, using the titration algorithm as used in study 4054 the IGF-I levels are within a range of 
-2 SDS and +2 SDS for about 80% of the patients. 
The safety profile of the proposed extension of the titration regimen of somapacitan in these AGHD patients is 
unknown. This optimized somapacitan dosing titration regimen which allows dose titration beyond 8 weeks 
and therefore higher somapacitan doses (up to a maximal dose of 8 mg/week) was only supported by 
modelling and simulation data. Therefore, the short- and long-term (benefits and) risks of an optimized 
somapacitan dose titration algorithm which allows dose titration beyond 8 weeks with a maximal dose of 8 
mg/week in AGHD patients should be evaluated further. A category 3 PASS will be conducted for this 
purpose.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The clinical features associated with AGHD are – among others - abdominal obesity, decreased lean body 
mass, reduced muscle strength and exercise capacity and impaired psychological well-being. The increased 
cardiovascular mortality observed in adult patients with hypopituitarism has been attributed to these 
metabolic abnormalities. Thus, one of the goals of treatment of AGHD (besides improvement of the quality of 
life) is to reverse the abnormalities in body composition (increased body fat, decreased lean body mass and 
bone mass), improve lipid status (decrease in serum cholesterol, increase in HDL-cholesterol), exercise 
capacity and quality of life.  
The main evidence of efficacy submitted is a single phase III multicentre, randomized, parallel-group study 
evaluating the clinical effects of double-blind somapacitan and placebo treatment and open-label somatropin 
treatment. Comparisons between somapacitan and somatropin concerned secondary analyses. Respective 
treatment comparisons should be interpreted with some reservation since study 4054 was primarily 
developed to compare the clinical effects of somapacitan and placebo treatment.  
The observed effect size of somapacitan for the primary endpoint change in truncal fat percentage at week 
34 as compared to baseline was larger than that of placebo treatment. Similar trends were observed in 
several sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint and for multiple secondary endpoints such as changes in 
fat masses, lean body mass, quality of life, and treatment satisfaction. The totality of the observed effects 
compared to placebo is considered clinically relevant. 
When compared with daily somatotropin clinical effects of somapacitan with respect to adipose tissue masses 
(including the primary endpoint change in truncal fat percentage at week 34) tended to be smaller compared 
to those of somatropin, whereas the clinical effects of both active substances were comparable with respect 
to lean body masses.   
No consistent effects of somapacitan in comparison with those of placebo and somatropin were observed with 
respect to the quality of life and well-being. The high variability known from the quality of life parameters 
decrease the sensitivity of such assessment and might explain why a clear and evident beneficial effect is not 
seen in both the somatropin and the somapacitan groups as compared to placebo.   
The IGF-I concentration is currently considered a predictor for the increase in lean body mass where 
(according to the experts) the growth hormone concentration is predictive for the decrease in adipose 
tissues. The limited efficacy of somapacitan compared to daily somatropin may be explained by the fact that 
the IGF-I SDS target range of -0.5 up to +1.75 was not achieved in 22% of study patients in the main 
treatment phase of study 4054. This proportion was even higher in subgroups of AGHD patients who are less 
sensitive to growth hormone treatment, such as women on oral oestrogen treatment (42%), and patients 
with childhood-onset AGHD (34%) (main treatment phase).  
Therefore, the observed discrepancy between the effects of somapacitan and somatropin on lean body 
masses and adipose tissue masses might partly be explained by a suboptimal somapacitan titration in a 
considerable proportion of AGHD patients resulting in too low IGF-I SDS levels, especially in women on oral 
oestrogen treatment.  
A post-hoc exposure-response study and a post-hoc simulation study indicate that clinical efficacy (expressed 
in IGF-I SDS scores) of somapacitan may increase upon application of an extended somapacitan dose 
Assessment report  
EMA/95144/2021 
Page 126/129 
 
 
 
titration in individual AGHD patients in which somapacitan dose titration beyond 8 weeks is allowed to 
achieve IGF-I SDS levels between 0 and +2 at a somapacitan dosage not exceeding 8 mg per week. These 
post-hoc analyses indicated that a larger proportion of the patients might reach an IGF-I SDS between 0 and 
+2. The safety results seen after daily somatropin in the pivotal study are in line with reported effects in 
previous studies with daily growth hormone treatment. Overall, from the limited population evaluated a 
short-term safety profile emerged which appears not different from the known growth hormone-containing 
medicinal products (e.g. somatropin product Norditropin).  
Although for the long-term safety, no serious safety issues are expected the lack of a long-term follow-up of 
the unphysiologic growth hormone and IGF-I exposition of somapacitan hampers an adequate assessment. It 
is unknown to what extent somapacitan affects long-term safety risks such as the development of diabetes 
mellitus type 2 and malignancies. Therefore this will be further investigated post-authorisation. 
Currently available study data and additional evidence from post-hoc analyses support the short-term clinical 
efficacy at an acceptable safety level of a flexible, somapacitan dose titration regimen in AGHD patients. 
However, it is yet unclear whether similar results can be obtained upon application of such a somapacitan 
dosing regimen in actual AGHD patients, in particular in AGHD patients who are less sensitive to growth 
hormone (e.g. women on oral oestrogen, patients with childhood GHD onset). The titration schemes in this 
subgroup will be further characterised in the planned PASS. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Based on the biological effects, somapacitan can be considered a long-acting growth hormone. When 
compared with placebo somapacitan was shown to decrease truncal fat percentage and improves other body 
composition endpoints in comparison with placebo. In addition, somapacitan tended to increase treatment 
satisfaction to a larger extent than placebo treatment. The observed effects of somapacitan are considered 
clinically relevant as they appear comparable with those of the open-label daily somatropin group. Comparing 
both drugs, no differences for convenience or global satisfaction was reported. 
Study data indicate that somapacitan dosing was too low in a considerable proportion of AGHD patients 
resulting in too low IGF-I SDS levels, especially in subgroups of AGHD patients who are less sensitive to 
growth hormone treatment (e.g. women on oral oestrogen treatment, childhood-onset AGHD patients).  
Post-hoc analyses indicated that an extended somapacitan dose titration regimen with potential dose titration 
beyond 8 weeks to achieve IGF-I SDS levels in the range between 0 and +2 might increase the short-term 
and long-term clinical efficacy of somapacitan in AGHD patients. It is unclear whether this can also be 
observed in actual AGHD patients as this optimized regimen was not prospectively tested in a clinical study. 
Further information on the effectiveness (i.e. effects on IGF-I, fat mass and lean body mass) of the modelled 
titration algorithm in different AGHD subgroups in clinical practice is, therefore, considered needed.  
Information regarding clinical effects of an adjusted somapacitan dosing regimen should be further collected 
and evaluated post-authorization in a PASS. Special attention should be given to those who are less sensitive 
to the clinical effects of somapacitan treatment, such as female AGHD patients on oral oestrogen therapy and 
patients with childhood-onset GHD. 
The short-term safety profile of somapacitan in current dosing regimen appeared to be in line with the known 
growth hormone-containing medicinal products, though limited safety data are available. Although no serious 
safety issues are to be expected, the long-term safety risks of unphysiological fluctuations of growth hormone 
and IGF-I upon weekly somapacitan administrations and potentially increased exposition using an optimized 
Assessment report

titration algorithm are unknown and should be further evaluated post-authorization in a PASS. The applicant 
agreed to perform a PASS evaluating the long-term risks for malignancies and diabetes mellitus type 2. In 
addition, the effects of the adherence to the weekly somapacitan treatment should be assessed in the PASS. 
Finally, as patients and physicians are not used to weekly growth hormone treatment, the number of 
medication errors should be measured in the PASS. This will allow the development of appropriate risk 
minimisation measures if needed. 
At present, the short-term and long-term benefits of somapacitan outweigh its risks for proposed AGHD 
indication.  
Hence, the benefit/risk balance of somapacitan growth hormone replacement treatment for AGHD is positive.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Previously the CHMP reviewed another long-acting GH i.e Somatropin Biopartners (EMEA/H/C/2196) which 
received a marketing authorisation in 2013. The applicant agreed on a PASS study to elucidate the long-term 
risks of the observed exposure with GH and IGF-I. Somatropin Biopartners was never marketed within the EU 
and was withdrawn in 2017 (“sunset clause”). There is no current data that somapacitan is associated with a 
higher incidence of injection site reactions. A PASS study is also requested for somapacitan to collect long-
term safety data.  
The AHEG considered somapacitan as a long-acting growth hormone which exerts clinical effects on both 
adipose tissue masses as well as lean body masses. According to the AHEG, such effects were observed in 
conducted clinical studies. The AHEG concluded that observed pharmacological effects of weekly somapacitan 
were overall comparable to those of daily somatropin. The experts considered that observed effects with 
once-weekly somapacitan in terms of change in body composition parameters versus placebo are clinically 
relevant and convincing. The AHEG further discussed the proposed titration algorithm. It was noticed that the 
somapacitan titration was to be based on the peak level of the somapacitan (3 or 4 days after injection). It 
was considered important to collect additional information on the long-term safety of the somapacitan.  
Clinical data are necessary to further define the algorithm of somapacitan titration and to collect information 
about the benefits and of the proposed dose titration (in all subgroups of AGHD patients). In this discussion 
also the effects on the trough levels of somapacitan should be considered.

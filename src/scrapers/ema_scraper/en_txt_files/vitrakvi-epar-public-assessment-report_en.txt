1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Bayer AG submitted on 24 August 2018 an application for marketing authorisation to the 
European Medicines Agency (EMA) for VITRAKVI, through the centralised procedure falling within the 
Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised 
procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 14 September 2017. 
VITRAKVI was designated as an orphan medicinal product: 
EU/3/15/1606 (EMA/OD/184/15) on 11 January 2016 in the following condition: Treatment of soft tissue 
sarcoma. 
EU/3/18/1995 (EMA/OD/213/17) on 21 March 2018 in the following condition: Treatment of salivary 
gland cancer. 
EU/3/18/2097 (EMA/OD/116/18) on 19 November 2018 in the following condition: Treatment of glioma. 
EU/3/18/2098 (EMA/OD/117/18) on 19 November 2018 in the following condition: Treatment of papillary 
thyroid cancer. 
All the orphan designations granted for larotrectinib were withdrawn on 11 July 2019. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: “Vitrakvi is indicated for the treatment of adult and 
paediatric patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours (excluding primary central nervous 
system (CNS) tumours) with a Neurotrophic Tyrosine Receptor Kinase (NTRK) gene fusion after prior 
standard therapy or as initial therapy when there is no adequate treatment option.” 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical 
and clinical data based on applicants’ tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0182/2018 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0182/2018 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The indication is for “the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with solid tumours that display a 
Neurotrophic Tyrosine Receptor Kinase (NTRK) gene fusion”, therefore it refers to solid tumours 
independent of tumour type/histology.  
This concerns an overall last line indication although early-line treatment is also included in tumour types 
where there is no available standard therapy, or, even if therapies are recommended, they do not provide 
a documented and relevantly sized clinical benefit. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
NTRK gene fusions lead to overexpression and constitutive activation of the tropomyosin receptor kinases 
TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC, which leads to TRK fusion cancer. The first report of an NTRK gene fusion was 
described in colorectal cancer in 1986 (Martin-Zanca et al. 1989).  More recently, with increasing adoption 
of comprehensive genomic profiling, NTRK gene fusions have been identified in a wide range of commonly 
occurring tumours, such as lung cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, thyroid cancer, sarcoma and 
others, though at low frequencies.  In very rare tumours, such as infantile fibrosarcoma (IFS), 
secretory/juvenile breast cancer, and mammary analogue secretory cancer of the salivary glands, NTRK 
gene fusions are the defining genetic feature of these tumour types occurring in 93% to 100% of tumours 
(Vaishnavi et al, 2015).  The prevalence of NTRK gene fusions in different tumour types are summarized 
in Table 1 and shows that TRK fusions are rare. 
Patients with advanced cancers have a life-threatening condition and represent an area of unmet medical 
need.

2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Tropomyosin receptor kinase receptors (TRKs) are a family of tyrosine kinases that bind neurotrophins, a 
family of growth factors important for the formation and function of the nervous system. TRKA, TRKB and 
TRKC receptors are encoded by the neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3 
genes,  which  are  located  on  human  chromosomes  1q23.1,  9q21.33,  and  15q25.3,  respectively.  The 
overall structure of the  TRK proteins is conserved, and the three TRK proteins show 40% amino acid 
identity overall. In normal signalling process, the binding of neurotrophins to TRK receptors leads to the 
activation of various downstream signalling pathways, such as those involving  RAS, PI3K and PLC 1–
4123 4. 
In cancer, the NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3 genes are subject to gene rearrangements that lead to kinase 
domain expression and constitutive downstream pathway activation. In these somatic rearrangements, 
the 5’ portion of a gene which is expressed by the tumour cell progenitor is fused to the 3’ portion of one 
of the three NTRK genes. This fusion gene is then transcribed into an mRNA fusion transcript which codes 
for a fusion protein containing the N-terminus of the fusion partner (usually containing a dimerization 
domain) and the C-terminus of one of the TRK proteins, including the kinase domain (Figure 1).

portion of the NTRK gene which encodes the tyrosine kinase domain of a TRK protein is fused to the 5’ part of a fusion 
partner. 
Figure 1:  Schematic representation of a NTRK gene fusion  
NTRK gene fusions could occur in 0.3 to 1% of all solid tumours 567 , and involve mainly the NTRK1 and 
NTRK3  genes,  and  multiple  5’  fusion  partners  (over  60  different  partner  genes  to  date) 8 .  These 
rearrangements are present at a low frequency in common tumour types, but at very high frequency in 
rare paediatric and adult tumours, such as infantile fibrosarcoma (with mainly ETV6-NTRK3 fusions, but 
other NTRK3 fusions as well NTRK1 fusions have also been identified), congenital mesoblastic nephroma 
(mainly NTRK3 fusions described to date), mammary analogue secretory carcinoma of the salivary gland 
and secretory carcinoma of the breast (in both tumour types, ETV6-NTRK3 is the most frequent fusion). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
The sought indication concerns a disease setting of locally advanced or metastatic malignant solid 
tumours after standard therapy or when there is no appropriate available therapy. In this setting 
symptoms of disease will be present or imminent and the disease is incurable, likely leading to death. 
Several molecular tools are currently available for the detection of NTRK fusions in tumour specimens:  
-  Fluorescence  in  situ  hybridization  (FISH)  allows  the  detection  of  NTRK1,  2,  or  3  gene 
rearrangements  on  the  DNA  using  break-apart  probes  specific  for  the  NTRK1,  2,  or  3  genes  (a 
different FISH analysis must be performed for each of the 3 NTRK genes) (Figure 2). This technique 
allows the detection of an NTRK rearrangement but does not give any indication on the nature of the

fusion  partner  and  might  give  some  false-positive  results  as  some  NTRK  gene  rearrangements 
detected on DNA might not produce a fusion transcript9. 
-  Next  generation  sequencing  (NGS)  assays  on  tissue  DNA  (for  example  MSK-IMPACT, 
FoundationOne)  or  RNA  (Archer  FusionPlex,  OmniSeq  comprehensive,  Thermo  Fisher  Oncomine 
Focus), could allow the full characterization of the genes involved in the fusion (rearranged gene and 
partner gene). However, the DNA panels currently used may not be designed to detect all possible 
NTRK  fusions.  Indeed,  the  FoundationOne  panel,  does  not  include  NTRK3  fusions,  and  has  only 
partial  intron  coverage  for  NTRK1  and  NTRK2  10.  Concerning  the  MSK-IMPACT  assay,  a  recent 
publication reports a partial coverage for NTRK1 and NTRK2 and that probes for ETV6 are used for 
the detection of ETV6-NTRK3 rearrangements. Similarly, the MSK-IMPACT NGS test does not allow 
the detection of NTRK3 rearrangements but uses probes to detect ETV6 rearrangements and also has 
partial coverage for NTRK1 and NTRK2. Capture-based NGS methods thus have some drawbacks for 
the  detection  of  NTRK  rearrangements,  which  contain  large  introns.  And,  the  same  as  with  the 
detection  with  FISH,  might  also  give  rise  to  false-positive  results  as  some  NTRK  gene 
rearrangements  detected  on  DNA  appear  not  to  produce  a  fusion  transcript  11.  The  use  of  an 
RNA-based  NGS  method  for  the  detection  of  NTRK  gene  rearrangements  could  seems  more 
adequate. Indeed, these techniques allow the detection of NTRK fusions without the need to cover 
the  intronic  regions  (which  are  spliced  out),  and  detect  fusions  which  will  result  in  an  expressed 
fusion protein (Figure 2: Schematic representation of the detection by NGS of a NTRK fusion).

Figure 2: Schematic representation of the detection by NGS of a NTRK fusion 
-  Reverse-transcription  PCR  (RT-PCR) also allows the detection of NTRK fusion transcripts, but 
requires the use of a high number of primer pairs to be able to detect all potential fusions possible 
(high  risk  of  false-negatives  considering  the  diversity  of  NTRK  fusions  possible).  A  possible 
adaptation  of  this  technique  could  be  to  use  primers  to  detect  amplicons  located  the  5’  and  3’

amplicons produced.  
- 
Immunohistochemistry  (IHC)  can  also  be  used  to  detect  TRK  fusion  proteins.  A  pan-TRK 
antibody (clone EPR17341) has been used to detect a homologous region of TRK -A, TRK -B and TRK 
-C. This antibody was compared to molecular analyses by NGS and showed a sensitivity of 95.2% 
(detection of 95.2% of positive cases) and a specificity of 100% (no false-positives) compared to 
RNA-sequencing (Archer FusionPlex)10. Another study used the same antibody to detect TRK fusions 
in  paediatric  mesenchymal  tumours,  and  yielded  a  sensitivity  and  specificity  of  97  and  98%, 
respectively, by comparison with DNA-based NGS. This IHC assay could be a useful cost-effective 
and easily implemented screening tool for the detection of very rare cases of TRK-positive tumours, 
and the NTRK rearrangement could then be confirmed by RNA-sequencing. However, this tool must 
be validated against a sufficient cohort of NTRK-positive and –negative cases. 
2.1.5.  Management 
The sought indication encompasses all malignant solid tumours types that have an NTRK gene fusion, 
with the exception of primary CNS tumours, and concerns a disease setting after standard therapy or 
when there is no appropriate available therapy. The intention of therapy in this setting is palliative.  
There are currently no approved specific targeted therapies for patients with TRK fusion cancer, nor are 
there any national consensus guidelines or literature references with recommendations for the clinical 
management of patients with TRK fusion cancer.  Patients with advanced TRK fusion cancer are clinically 
managed based on care standards for the tumour site of origin. 
Initial treatments at primary diagnosis include surgery and radiotherapy; and for thyroid cancers, 
radioactive iodine.  Systemic therapy options (including chemotherapy and treatment with biologics) are 
subsequently considered. 
The therapeutic modalities for different types of locally advanced and metastatic malignant solid tumours 
(the present disease setting) may include: 
•  Surgery (palliative) 
•  Systemic therapy: cytotoxic/cytostatic chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, 
hormonal therapy 
•  Radiation therapy 
It should be noted that for several rare tumour types, such as salivary gland cancer and IFS, randomized 
trials establishing best practices have not been conducted. For other tumour types, such as soft tissue 
sarcoma, care standards are generally associated with low response rates of modest duration.   
Different systemic treatment options by tumour type are summarized in Table 3: Summary of Current 
Systemic Treatment Options for Advanced/Metastatic Disease in Selected Tumour Types (includes 
patients with and without NTRK fusion) (Table 3) although these therapies may not be approved for use 
in all countries. None of these treatments have been developed for, or specifically studied in subgroups of 
patients with NTRK gene fusions so available data reflect the efficacy in the general disease population. 
Overall, for patients with advanced NTRK fusion-positive cancer, there are only few treatment options 
available if standard treatment has failed. For some patients no treatment options are available. For many 
patients, ongoing salvage treatment with existing alternatives is not considered beneficial due to known

About the product 
Mode of action, Pharmacological classification 
Larotrectinib is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP) competitive and selective tropomyosin receptor kinase 
(TRK) inhibitor that was rationally designed to avoid activity with off target kinases. The target for 
larotrectinib is the TRK family of proteins inclusive of TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC that are encoded by NTRK1, 
NTRK2 and NTRK3 genes, respectively. In a broad panel of purified enzyme assays, larotrectinib inhibited 
TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC with IC50 values between 5 and 11 nM. The only other kinase activity occurred at 
100 fold higher concentrations. In in vitro and in vivo tumour models, larotrectinib demonstrated 
anti-tumour activity in cells with constitutive activation of TRK proteins resulting from gene fusions, 
deletion of a protein regulatory domain, or in cells with TRK protein overexpression. 
In frame gene fusion events resulting from chromosomal rearrangements of the human genes NTRK1, 
NTRK2, and NTRK3 lead to the formation of oncogenic TRK fusion proteins. These resultant novel chimeric 
oncogenic proteins are aberrantly expressed, driving constitutive kinase activity subsequently activating 
downstream cell signalling pathways involved in cell proliferation and survival leading to TRK fusion 
positive cancer.  
Pharmaceutical presentations 
•  Hard capsules 25 mg and 100 mg 
•  Oral solution 20 mg/ml 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
“Vitrakvi is indicated for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with locally advanced or metastatic 
solid tumours (excluding primary central nervous system (CNS) tumours) with a Neurotrophic Tyrosine 
Receptor Kinase (NTRK) gene fusion after prior standard therapy or as initial therapy when there is no 
adequate treatment option.” 
The recommended indication is: 
“VITRAKVI as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with solid 
tumours that display a Neurotrophic Tyrosine Receptor Kinase (NTRK) gene fusion, 
-  who have a disease that is locally advanced, metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to 
result in severe morbidity, and 
-  who have no satisfactory treatment options (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).” 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469135/2019 
Page 17/196 
  
  
Treatment with VITRAKVI should be initiated by physicians experienced in the administration of 
anticancer therapies. 
The presence of an NTRK gene fusion in a tumour specimen should be confirmed by a validated test prior 
to initiation of treatment with VITRAKVI. 
VITRAKVI is for oral use and is available as a capsule or oral solution with equivalent oral bioavailability, 
and may be used interchangeably 
The recommended dose in adults is 100 mg larotrectinib twice daily, until disease progression or until 
unacceptable toxicity occurs. 
Dosing in paediatric patients is based on body surface area (BSA). The recommended dose in paediatric 
patients is 100 mg/m2 larotrectinib twice daily with a maximum of 100 mg per dose until disease 
progression or until unacceptable toxicity occurs. 
If a dose is missed, the patient should not take two doses at the same time to make up for a missed dose. 
Patients should take the next dose at the next scheduled time. If the patient vomits after taking a dose, 
the patient should not take an additional dose to make up for vomiting. 
For all Grade 2 adverse reactions, continued dosing may be appropriate, though close monitoring to 
ensure no worsening of the toxicity is advised. Patients with Grade 2 ALT and/or AST increases, should be 
followed with serial laboratory evaluations every one to two weeks after the observation of Grade 2 
toxicity until resolved to establish whether a dose interruption or reduction is required. 
For Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions: 
- 
- 
VITRAKVI should be withheld until the adverse reaction resolves or improves to baseline or 
Grade 1. Resume at the next dose modification if resolution occurs within 4 weeks. 
VITRAKVI should be permanently discontinued if an adverse reaction does not resolve within 
4 weeks. 
The recommended dose modifications for VITRAKVI for adverse reactions are provided in Table 1.

Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was considered 
to be of major public health interest. This was based on:  
NTRK fusion events appear to be important oncogenic drivers in tumours bearing them, in the sense that 
inhibition with Larotrectinib causes significant tumour shrinkage in a large proportion of patients. It is 
unlikely that other approved drugs or combinations of drugs could parallel this activity in at least part of 
the presently aimed for target population. Pending final wording of the indication, alternatives are 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469135/2019 
Page 18/196 
  
  
expected to be exhausted in the “progressed following prior treatment or no acceptable alternative 
treatments” population. 
The application is further considered innovative, as the complication of NTRK fusion rarity has been 
approached with a tissue-independent development program. 
However, the CHMP concluded that it was no longer appropriate to pursue accelerated assessment, as the 
uncertainties raised during the assessment required a thorough review of the quality, clinical 
pharmacology and clinical efficacy aspects.  
During the assessment, the applicant requested consideration of its application for a Conditional 
Marketing Authorisation in accordance with Article 14-a of the above mentioned Regulation, based on the 
following criteria: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. The applicant proposed to 
submit the study report from ongoing studies (LOXO-TRK-14001, LOXO-TRK-15002, and 
LOXO-TRK-15003) and a single arm, multi-cohort, prospective non-interventional study (PASS) 
conducted to verify and describe the clinical benefit of larotrectinib. 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as the proposed indication for larotrectinib places the 
product in a setting where no satisfactory treatment options remain since patients will have failed to 
respond to standard of care, did not tolerate it or do not have any standard of care for treatment.  
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that 
additional data are still required. The applicant claims that NTRK gene fusion events are important 
oncogenic drivers and the activity of larotrectinib has demonstrated significant tumour shrinkage in 
a large proportion of patients. Based on the proposed indication, patients eligible for larotrectinib will 
have exhausted all satisfactory treatment options. In addition, the known risks are considered 
acceptable given the life-threatening nature of metastatic solid tumours with limited or no available 
therapy, given the observed magnitude of effect on ORR.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of larotrectinib sulfate is 
(3S)-N-{5-[(2R)-2-(2,5-difluorophenyl)-1-pyrrolidinyl]pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-3-yl}-3-hydroxy-1-pyr
rolidinecarboxamide sulfate corresponding to the molecular formula C21H24F2N6O6S. It has a relative 
molecular mass of 526.51 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 3: active substance structure 
The chemical structure of larotrectinib was elucidated by a combination of mass spectrometry, 1H and 13C 
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometry, 
specific optical rotation and element analysis. 
The solid state properties of the active substance were measured by single crystal X-ray diffraction 
analysis. 
The active substance is off-white to yellow to pinkish yellow, non-hygroscopic powder. The solubility of 
larotrectinib sulfate is low in most organic solvents with the exception of the alcohols, specifically 
methanol and ethanol. The aqueous solubility of larotrectinib sulfate is pH dependent. In vitro studies 
show that in liquid volumes relevant to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract larotrectinib is fully soluble over 
entire pH range of the GI tract. Therefore, larotrectinib sulfate can be classified as highly soluble 
according to the Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS) criteria. Although a formal assessment of 
biopharmaceutical class has not been performed, larotrectinib sulfate has the attributes of a BCS Class 1 
compound, characterized by high solubility and high permeability. 
Larotrectinib exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of two chiral centres. Stereoisomerism 
originates from the starting materials and enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely by chiral High 
Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) in the active substance specification with limits for the 
enantiomer and two diastereomers. 
Polymorphism has been observed for larotrectinib sulfate. Extensive polymorph screening and evaluation 
studies have been conducted on the active substance. The results from these screening studies showed 
only one crystalline form or amorphous material from. To date, only a single form of larotrectinib sulfate 
has been consistently produced in the manufacturing of the active substance and has been physically 
stable in all active substance stability programs, including those under stress conditions.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the dossier and 
it was considered satisfactory. The active substance is obtained from a single manufacturer. 
Larotrectinib sulfate is synthesized in four main steps and the salt formation step using three well defined 
starting materials with acceptable specifications. Three intermediates are isolated. 
The first synthetic step consists of coupling of two starting materials. It is followed by a reduction step and 
acylation. The synthesis continues with reaction with the third starting material and treatment with 
sulfuric acid to provide larotrectinib as the sulfate salt. The reactions are performed in inert atmosphere, 
in appropriate vessels, with agitation and at the specified temperatures. No materials used in the process 
are recovered or recycled. 
Three starting materials were initially proposed. All three proposed starting materials have defined 
chemical structures and together provide the key structural features of the finished active substance. 
Compounds 1 and 2 are made by custom synthesis. No fundamental objections were made to the 
designation of 1 and 2 as starting materials and their specifications are acceptable. 
However, compound 3 could not be accepted due to insufficient control of its stereochemistry and 
impurities. Also, the claim that Compound 3 is commercially available could not be sufficiently 
substantiated. These concerns constituted a Major Objection and a redefinition of Compound 3 to an 
intermediate and assignment of an earlier precursor as starting material was therefore requested by 
CHMP. As all necessary activities related to the redefinition could not reasonably be expected to be 
resolved within the time frame of the procedure, a Post-Approval Change Management Protocol (PACMP) 
was proposed. The submitted PACMP contains details and justifications on the activities and timelines for 
the redefinition of the starting material and it is considered acceptable. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
A different manufacturer has been used for production of early clinical and toxicology batches; however 
the same synthetic route has been applied throughout the process development. The bridging is 
supported by the provided batch analyses and stability studies. 
The active substance is packaged in bags which comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 
as amended. The bags are closed and placed in a drum. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance, identity (FTIR, HPLC), assay H2SO4 salt 
(HPLC), freebase potency (HPLC), HPLC purity (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), chiral purity (chiral HPLC), 
sulfate content (HPLC), elemental impurities (ICP-MS), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), water content (KF), 
residual solvents (GC), particle size (laser diffraction). 
A single impurity present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A was qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference 
standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented.

Batch analysis data on 6 commercial scale batches of the active substance are provided. Additionally, 
batch analysis from 4 supporting batches manufactured using earlier processes. The results are within the 
specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from four commercial scale and one approximately two thirds of commercial scale batches 
of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package for up to 
36 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Data on four additional 
supportive batches was provided. 
The stability studies on the registration batches were performed using the same analytical methods up 
through the 3-month time point. From the 6-month time point improved versions of the methods for 
chiral and achiral impurities as well as water content were implemented. Batches are tested for 
appearance, assay, purity, chiral purity, water content, and physical form at every time point. Microbial 
testing is performed annually as an additional test item for informative purposes. 
All tested parameters were within the specifications with no trends observed. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. Data shows that 
larotrectinib sulfate is not photosensitive. 
Results on stress conditions were also provided on one batch. Forced-degradation studies were conducted 
under thermal, photolytic, acidic, basic and oxidation conditions. The results of the forced-degradation 
study show that larotrectinib sulfate is very stable under stress conditions. Only limited amounts of 
degradation were observed under all conditions other than oxidation where significant degradation takes 
place. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the retest period when stored below 30 °C in the proposed 
container.

capsule printed with ‘Bayer’ cross and the strength (100 mg) in blue ink. The composition of capsules is 
provided in the following tables. 
Based on the results of Phase I clinical trials in a specific, yet limited patient population, minimal 
development work was done with respect to the capsule finished product. While simple blends were 
considered as a formulation approach, given the clinical response, and in order to expedite drug to 
patients, active substance in a capsule was chosen as the preferred finished product. 
As discussed earlier in the report, extensive pre-formulation studies, including a comprehensive 
physicochemical and biopharmaceutical characterization of the larotrectinib sulfate active substance, 
polymorph screening, and stability profiling were performed. It was determined that larotrectinib sulfate 
Assessment report

Page 22/196 
  
  
is highly soluble, chemically and physically stable, and non-hygroscopic. Only a single polymorph of the 
active substance has been identified under active substance and finished product processing and storage 
conditions, and this form has been consistently produced and used during development. 
The active substance manufacturing process produces the active substance of consistent particle size. 
Due to aqueous solubility of larotrectinib sulfate, particle size is not considered a critical quality attribute 
to ensure consistent dissolution rate.  
The simple active substance in capsule formulation was chosen as it eliminates the potential for 
interaction with excipients. The stability of the product over time demonstrates that there is no potential 
for interaction between the active substance and the capsule shell. All excipients are well known 
pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel 
excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the 
SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
As the formulation is the active substance in a capsule, release is limited only by the disintegration of the 
gelatin capsule since, as noted previously, larotrectinib sulfate active substance is very soluble in aqueous 
media. 
Throughout the development of Larotrectinib sulfate capsules, the used capsule has remained 
unchanged. Based on the pH solubility profile of larotrectinib sulfate, disintegration testing (of the gelatin 
capsule) has served as an adequate control on the performance of the finished product and has been 
included in the finished product specification as replacement of dissolution testing in accordance with ICH 
Q6A Guideline “Specifications: Tests procedures and Acceptance Criteria for New Drug Substances and 
New Drug Products: Chemical Substances”. However, a dissolution method has been developed and 
validated. Based on the results of dissolution development studies, a method was developed. The 
discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated. 
The formulation used during clinical studies is the same as that intended for marketing. 
The primary packaging is HDPE bottles. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The 
choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been  validated  by  stability  data  and  is  adequate  for  the 
intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacture of VITRAKVI capsules consists of three main steps: filling larotrectinib sulfate active 
substance into hard gelatin capsules by weight, placing the finished capsules into high-density 
polyethylene bottles and induction sealing. The capsule filling technology uses a gravimetric filling 
method to fill unit doses of active substance directly into capsules. The system uses a metering 
technology controlled via software to accurately fill capsules. Each capsule is opened, filled, closed, and 
weighed during the process and any that are outside of the acceptable weight range are rejected. After 
evaluation of all relevant manufacturing steps in order to identify the risk areas to be targeted during 
process validation, no steps were identified as having a high risk to quality with the proposed process. 
The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process.  
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies.  It  has  been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality  in  a  reproducible  manner.  No  critical  steps  have  been  identified.  The  in-process  controls  are 
adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form.

Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
appearance, identity (HPLC, UV), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), chiral purity (chiral HPLC), 
water  content  (KF),  dose  uniformity  by  weight  variation  (Ph.  Eur.),  dissolution  after  45  minutes  (Ph. 
Eur.), microbial enumeration testing (Ph. Eur). 
Residual solvents are controlled in the active substance. No solvents are used during finished product 
manufacture and the capsule shells do not contain residual solvents. Therefore, the absence of a residual 
solvent specification for VITRAKVI capsules is justified. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk assessment it can 
be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls. The information on the 
control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and 
impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 13 batches of different scales (6 of those commercial) for 25 mg 
capsules and 12 batches of different scales (7 of those commercial) for 100 mg capsules, confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from eight 25 mg capsule batches manufactured up to the commercial scale and from nine 
100 mg capsule batches manufactured up to the commercial scale and stored for up to 12 months under 
long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH), up to 12 months under intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 65% RH) 
and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines 
were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were 
packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. 
Samples were tested for the same parameters as for release with the exception of identification and dose 
uniformity.  The  analytical  procedures  used  are  stability  indicating.  No  significant  changes  have  been 
observed and all results remained within the acceptance criteria. 
In accordance with EU GMP guidelines2, any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative 
trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA. 
In addition, one batch of each of the capsule strength was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline 
on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products and on twice the amount as defined in the 
Guideline. There were no significant changes to chromatographic purity at 1x or 2x ICH light exposure. All 
larotrectinib sulfate peaks are considered spectrally pure. Light exposure, at 1x and 2x ICH light exposure 
recommended levels, does not adversely affect the larotrectinib sulfate product quality demonstrating its 
photostability. 
Additionally,  a  study  has  been  designed  to  confirm  in-use  stability  of  the  capsules  in  their  proposed 
commercial container closure systems, without desiccant. The study is performed with one batch of each 
of the capsule strengths. No significant changes over time are seen and the data indicates acceptable 
in-use stability. No shelf life after first opening of the container needs to be stated in the SmPC.

Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months with no special storage conditions 
as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable.

B. Oral Solution 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
VITRAKVI 20 mg/mL oral solution consists of 100 mL of clear yellow to orange oral solution formulation 
filled into a 100 mL amber Type III glass bottle with a child-resistant PP cap and a PE tamper-evident seal 
liner. 
The composition of the finished product is presented in the following table. 
Based on the results of larotrectinib in Phase I clinical trials in a rare, orphan patient population, a liquid 
formulation was developed for a pediatric population with tumors harboring NTRK gene fusions. This 
development effort initially focused on achieving a balance between solubility and pH – as larotrectinib 
sulfate is extremely soluble at low pH. However, low pH would pose palatability issues for the patient. 
Various solubility enhancers were considered, focusing on those that would be acceptable in a pediatric 
population in terms of taste, while keeping the pH at the level of most fruit juices. Once this had been 
accomplished using a hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) and sodium citrate, the focus turned to 
masking the extremely bitter taste of larotrectinib sulfate. This was accomplished by utilizing 
commercially available excipient mixture intended as a vehicle for drug administration, as well as multiple 
masking agents and flavorings. 
During the assessment, a Major Objection was raised concerning the lack of information about the 
quantitative composition of the excipient mixture used. In response to the questions, the applicant has 
included additional information about the excipient composition in the composition table and detailed 
analytical results have been added to the excipients section of the dossier. Major Objections were also 
raised since no study to determine the minimum effective concentration of preservatives according to Ph. 
Eur. was submitted, and regarding the lack of confirmation of compliance with the Ph. Eur. for some 
excipients. However, the quality of the product is sufficiently demonstrated to support approval taking 
into consideration the clinical benefits of the finished product and that the oral solution is proposed as an 
interim product. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients. There are no novel excipients 
used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and 
in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
During the pharmaceutical development it was found that the order of addition of the components was 
critical in order to achieve complete dissolution and it was noted that the colour of the solution changed 
on storage at 25°C/60% RH and 40°C/75% RH. It was decided to recommend storage at refrigerated 
conditions and that the oral solution was to be filled in glass containers.  
Initially, production of clinical batches was performed at a development site and transfer was then made 
to the commercial manufacturing site. Similar manufacturing equipment was used at both sites and the 
change in scale was considered to be low risk.  
The primary packaging is one hundred milliliters of a 20 mg/mL larotrectinib solution formulation filled 
into a 100 mL amber Type III glass bottle, PP neck and capped with a child resistant and tamper evident 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469135/2019 
Page 25/196 
  
  
closure with a PE liner. An extractable study was provided for the container closure system and it was 
found acceptable. 
The oral solution was developed as a pediatric formulation, and the SmPC (section 4.2) states that the 
product can be administered by feeding tube. This is supported by a recovery study for administration of 
VITRAKVI solution 20 mg/mL for oral use via nasogastric feeding tubes to demonstrate the suitability of 
the proposed flushing volume with respect to dose recovery. 
The choice of glass bottles with polypropylene caps and polyethylene liners as container/closure system 
is considered acceptably justified. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process of the oral solution consists of three main steps: mixing of the components, 
filtration and filling into bottles. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Process validation of three consecutive commercial-scale batches of the VITRAKVI oral solution has been 
carried out. The traditional process validation approach including enhanced sampling and testing at the 
mixing and filling stages was applied. No separate validation report has been submitted but a summary is 
given in the dossier and was found acceptable. 
It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of 
intended quality in a reproducible manner. The mixing steps including the respective process parameters 
and the order of addition of components into the mixture are defined as critical steps. The in-process 
controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
appearance, identity (HPLC, UV), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), chiral purity (chiral HPLC), 
deliverable volume (USP), pH (Ph. Eur.), elemental impurities (ICP-MS), microbial enumeration testing 
(Ph. Eur.), and antimicrobial preservative effectiveness (USP). 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. The risk assessment includes 
adequate information regarding the intentionally added catalysts in the active substance and it is 
repeated that they are controlled at an acceptable level in the active substance specification. 
However, as the risk assessment does not exclude the risk of intentionally added elements in excipients, 
testing of all elements listed in the ICH Q3D guideline is performed. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and 
impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three stability batches of 1/5 of the commercial scale, three 
process validation batches as well as for clinical batches of larger batch size manufactured under similar 
conditions, confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the 
intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing.

Stability of the product 
Stability data from three batches of finished product manufactured at 1/5 of the commercial scale stored 
for  up  to  12  months  under  long  term  conditions  (2-8  ºC),  for  up  to  12  months  under  accelerated 
conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those 
proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
The specifications for release and for shelf life are identical except for identity, deliverable volume and 
elemental  impurities  testing  that  are  performed  at  release  only.  The  analytical  procedures  used  are 
stability indicating. 
Supportive stability batches from the two clinical batches have also been studied to provide additional 
data  to  support  the  long-term  stability  of  the  product.  Results  from  storage  of  the  first  batch  for  24 
months at long-term conditions and 25ºC/60% RH and for 6 months at 40ºC/75% RH are provided, while 
for the second batch 12 months data at long-term conditions and 25ºC/60% RH and for 6 months at 
40ºC/75%  RH  are  provided.  There  have  been  no  changes  on  stability  at  the  recommended  storage 
conditions of 2 – 8 °C for the supportive clinical batches after 24 months and 12 months respectively. At 
25 °C/60 % RH, the solution starts to darken at 3 months in both batches, but there is no change in 
impurity profile or pH. At 6 months, the color has gone from yellow to orange and there is a trend toward 
a slight increase in measured impurities (from ~0.1 % to ~0.2 %), but the pH remains unchanged. Assay 
results do not show a trend after 12 months at 25 °C/60 % RH, and are well within specification. At 40 
°C/75 % RH, both lots show darkening of appearance at 1 month and significant changes in color and 
impurities at 3 months.  
The  results  obtained  for  the  three  registration  (primary  stability)  batches  show  no  changes  at  the 
recommended storage conditions of 2 – 8 °C for 12 months. Also at storage at 25 °C/60 % RH, all results 
are clearly within the acceptance criteria with an unchanged assay and only minor increase of degradation 
products. For storage at 40 °C/75 % RH, the batches show discoloration of the solution after 1 month and 
significant decrease of assay as well as corresponding increase of impurities over time. 
In-use stability testing was performed on one clinical batch and demonstrated no change in profile after 
30 days at the recommended storage conditions of 2 – 8 °C. Therefore an in-use period of 30 days when 
stored at 2 – 8 °C is justified SmPC (section 6.3). 
For performance of the in-use testing, the smaller bottle presentation of 60 mL has been chosen instead 
of the commercial 100 mL bottle, because this represents a worst case scenario as demonstrated by the 
provided investigations regarding the headspace volume. 
In accordance with EU GMP guidelines11, any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative 
trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA. 
In addition, 1 batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New 
Drug  Substances  and  Products.  Little  degradation  occurred  under  UV  light.  Although  degradation  has 
occurred,  it  is  not  significant  enough  for  a  requirement  to  protect  the  product  from  light,  as  solution 
stability was assessed for both samples and standards over 198 hours and 201 hours respectively, and 
determined to be stable when unprotected from light. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months and storage conditions (“Store in 
a refrigerator at 2 – 8 °C”, “Do not freeze” as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3 and 6.4) are acceptable. 
After first opening the product should be used within 30 days and it should not be frozen.

2.2.4.  Discussion and conclusions on chemical, pharmaceutical and 
biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
During the procedure, the Applicant was asked to redefine one of the starting materials, however, since 
all aspects of the starting material redefinition cannot be resolved within the time frame of the procedure, 
a Post Approval Change Management Protocol (PACMP) has been submitted, detailing the activities and 
timelines for the actions associated with the redefinition process. This protocol and approach was 
considered acceptable. 
Two pharmaceutical formulations are applied for, an oral solution developed for paediatric use and hard 
capsules. 
The pharmaceutical developments of the products and the manufacturing processes have been 
acceptably described. 
Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented 
to give reassurance on TSE safety.

Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Larotrectinib was tested in pharmacodynamics, PK, and toxicology programs that were designed to 
characterize the nonclinical activity, disposition, and safety of larotrectinib to support its marketing 
authorisation in the sought indication. 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies focused on testing the binding affinity of Larotrectinib to TRKA, TRKB, 
and TRKC in vitro, inhibition of functional activity of each kinase, as well as inhibition of cell growth in 
TRK-fusion cell lines. Additionally, anti-tumour activity of Larotrectinib was assessed in vivo. In secondary 
pharmacodynamics studies, larotrectinib was tested in vitro for off-target activity in panels of non-TRK 
kinases and various receptors, enzymes and nuclear targets and in vivo in several pain-related studies. 
Cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous system (CNS) safety pharmacology endpoints were 
incorporated into study designs for the pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies in rat and monkey. The 
pharmacokinetics and metabolism of larotrectinib have been examined through a series of in vitro and in 
vivo studies that included toxicokinetic studies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469135/2019 
Page 28/196 
  
  
Based on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of orally administered larotrectinib in the rat, rabbit, and 
monkey, BID (rat and rabbit) and QD (monkey) dosing regimens were used in the repeat-dose studies. 
For the toxicology program on larotrectinib, 25 toxicity studies were completed. The following studies 
were also conducted: Dose range finding (DRF) embryo-foetal development (EFD) studies in SD rats and 
New Zealand (NZ) rabbits followed by GLP EFD studies in rats and rabbits; DRF studies in juvenile SD rats 
from postnatal day (PND) 7 to PND 28 (two studies) with a subsequent GLP repeat dose oral toxicity study 
in juvenile male and female SD rats from PND 7 through PND 70; in vitro Ames and mouse lymphoma 
assays, an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, and an in vitro phototoxicity study in BALB/c 3T3 mouse 
fibroblasts.

 Larotrectinib reduces TRKA phosphorylation in clinically-relevant NTRK1 gene fusion proteins and in cell 
lines derived from patients with potency in the range of 2 to 8 nM. Larotrectinib inhibits the enzymatic 
activity of TRKB and TRKC with potencies approximately equal to those for TRKA. 
Potency of Larotrectinib on Inhibition of Cell Proliferation in Cell Lines with and without 
TRK-Fusion Drivers of Proliferation  
Larotrectinib was incubated with 87 cancer cell lines and its IC50 for inhibition of proliferation was 
determined (LOXO-101-PHARM-033). Larotrectinib only showed potent inhibition in cell lines in which 
proliferation is driven by a TRK fusions. Its IC50 in cell lines without TRK fusion drivers was >10,000 nM.

Larotrectinib at a concentration of 10 µmol/L had no significant interaction with 58 potential mammalian 
off-targets (including G protein-coupled and nuclear receptors, ion channels, and transporters) in 
radioligand binding assays (LOXO-101-PHARM-019).  
In another set of receptor binding, functional cellular, and enzyme assays, larotrectinib at concentrations 
of 10-30 μM did not displace specific ligands of mostly human receptors (D2S, D2L, D3, H3, MT2, M1, M2, M3, 
NK1, σ1, σ2), and the human dopamine transporter. At a concentration of 30 μM, larotrectinib had no 
agonistic or antagonistic effect at A1 or MT1 receptors in cellular functional assays, and at a concentration 
of 10 μM, it did not inhibit the activity of human PDE4 A1A (LOXO-101-PHARM-020). 
Larotrectinib, at concentrations up to 100 μM (the highest concentrations tested), had no agonistic or 
antagonistic effect at the human nuclear receptors PPARα, PPARβ, PPARγ, RXRα, RXRβ, RXRγ, PXR, and 
CAR or murine PPARα, rat PPARα, or murine/rat PPARγ (LOXO-101-PHARM-021). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
The safety pharmacology of larotrectinib was evaluated in stand-alone in vitro and in vivo studies that 
assessed effects on the CNS, CV (including ECG), respiratory, and GI systems in various species (mouse, 
rat, dog, cynomolgus monkey). In addition, cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous system 
(CNS) safety pharmacology endpoints were incorporated into study designs for the GLP repeat-dose 
toxicity studies in adult and juvenile rat and monkey. 
Larotrectinib had no major adverse effects on CNS function up to 100 mg/kg in adult rats following both 
single and repeated (4 and 13 weeks) dosing (single dose: up to ~8-fold higher Cmax than at human 
therapeutic dose). Larotrectinib had no neurobehavioural findings in adult animals (rats, mice, 
cynomolgus monkeys) at exposure (Cmax) at least 7 fold higher than the human exposure. In juvenile 
rats, findings indicating CNS involvement were observed, as presented below in the Toxicology section. 
No adverse CV effects were noted in a conscious rat non-GLP study (up to 300 mg/kg) and a monkey GLP 
study in which telemetry-instrumented animals were dosed up to 100 mg/kg (~6-fold higher Cmax than at 
human therapeutic dose). Larotrectinib inhibited the hERG K+ current at an IC50 value of 147 µM which is 
approximately 230-fold higher than the maximum unbound concentration (Cmax.u = 0.68 µM) at the 
human dose regimen of 100 mg BID. 
Larotrectinib had no effect on respiratory function in rats; at exposures (Cmax) at least 8 times the 
human therapeutic exposure. In rats, larotrectinib accelerated intestinal transit and increased gastric 
secretion and acidity (see section 5.3 of the SmPC). 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies have been submitted. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Larotrectinib concentrations in plasma were determined with validated LC-MS methods in GLP toxicity 
studies in rat, rabbit and monkey. 
Absorption 
Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated oral bioavailability of approximately 30% to 150% in mice, rats, 
dogs, and monkeys. The pharmacokinetics following multiple doses of larotrectinib in mice, rats, rabbits, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469135/2019 
Page 32/196 
  
  
 
and monkeys were generally consistent with single-dose pharmacokinetics. In general, except for rats, no 
significant pharmacokinetics (PK) differences with regard to sex were observed in animal species.  
Distribution 
The volume of distribution of larotrectinib is approximately 0.7-2 L/kg in the mouse, rat, dog, and 
monkey, suggesting that larotrectinib distributes into tissues. In mice, the brain/plasma ratio of 
larotrectinib was approximately 0.03 to 0.23 and was 3-4 fold higher in Mdr1a-deficient mice, which lack 
one of the human orthologs of MDR1 (P-gp), and in Mdr1a/Mdr1b/Bcrp-knockout mice, which lack both 
murine orthologs of human MDR1 and the murine ortholog of human breast cancer resistance protein 
(BCRP). These data demonstrate low penetration of larotrectinib into the central nervous system (CNS) of 
mice and that transporters such as Mdr1a, Mdr1b, and Bcrp contribute to the low CNS penetration of 
larotrectinib in mice. The brain/plasma ratio of larotrectinib in male rats was approximately 0.01 to 0.02. 
Overall, these data suggest limited penetration of larotrectinib into the CNS in mice and rats. 
Tissue distribution of radioactivity was evaluated by quantitative whole-body autoradiography (QWBA) in 
male Long Evans pigmented rats given an oral dose of [14C]-larotrectinib. Abdominal adipose, bone, eye 
lens, and the non-circumventricular central nervous system tissues were devoid of radioactivity 
throughout the time course of this study. Tissue concentrations generally declined over time. By the last 
sampling time of 672 hours after dosing, tissues radioactivity concentrations declined to undetectable 
levels (< 45 ng equivalents/g) for most tissues except for the liver and thyroid. 
Plasma protein binding of larotrectinib was 56%, 64%, 55%, 61%, 66%, and 68% in plasma from mice, 
rats, rabbits, dogs, monkeys, and humans, respectively. 
Metabolism 
The one major human plasma metabolite, termed M14 (an O-glucuronide formed following loss of the 
hydroxypyrrolidine-urea moiety) is present in the plasma of rats and monkeys, the species used for the 
nonclinical safety testing of larotrectinib. The AUC of M14 in male rats (150 mg/kg BID), female rats (150 
mg/kg BID), and monkeys (200 mg/kg QD) was 2-fold, 1-fold, and 20-fold higher, respectively, than the 
human AUC for this metabolite in cancer patients treated with 100 mg BID larotrectinib. 
Excretion 
Larotrectinib and its metabolites are eliminated by the renal and biliary routes. Rats eliminated 6% of an 
IV dose of larotrectinib in the bile as unchanged parent. Dogs excreted 71% of an intravenous dose into 
the urine as unchanged parent drug. Monkeys given an oral dose of radiolabeled larotrectinib excreted 
27% of total drug-related material into the urine, mostly as unchanged parent drug, and 47% of the dose 
in the bile, mostly as metabolites. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
In vitro, larotrectinib is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 with little or no metabolism by other CYP450 
enzymes. Larotrectinib showed no significant direct inhibition, time-dependent inhibition, nor 
metabolism-dependent inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 (half 
maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50] of 180 µM for CYP2C8 and IC50 >300 µM for CYP1A2, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6). However, larotrectinib showed time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4 in 
vitro. Additionally, in vitro, larotrectinib showed weak induction of CYP2B6 and CYP3A4. 
Larotrectinib is not a substrate of organic anion transporter (OAT)1, OAT3, organic cation transporter 
(OCT)1, OCT2, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, but is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicological program was conducted in line with ICH S9 recommendations and did therefore not 
include carcinogenicity studies and only a reduced DART program. As there is a proposed paediatric 
indication, a juvenile toxicity study has been conducted.  
Single dose toxicity 
A single dose toxicity study (LOXO-101-TOX-001, GLP) was performed in rats.

Due to the progression of serious skin lesions in the mid and high dose groups, doses were lowered. 
Specifically, the dose level for high-dose males and females was lowered to 50 mg/kg/dose BID (twice 
daily) on Days 29 and 27, respectively, after females completed a dosing holiday from Day 23 (PM) 
through Day 26. Then on Day 42, the mid and high-dose levels for females were lowered to 10 and 
20 mg/kg/dose BID, respectively. In the low dose females, scabs were noted but were not regarded as 
adverse at that time; however, to maintain adequate multiples of dose exposures and optimal exposures 
for a dose response, on Day 42 the dose was lowered in this group as well. On Day 53, dose levels for mid- 
and high-dose males were lowered (a second time for the high dose group) to 17.5 and 37.5 mg/kg/dose 
BID, respectively. Due to the serious nature of the lesions, several mid- and high-dose animals were

examined and treated with anti-inflammatory analgesics and/or antibiotics by a veterinarian on a case by 
case basis. 
Mortality: Nine test article-related deaths in mid- and high-dose groups. Euthanasia of six out of seven 
moribund animals consequence of skin lesions, the seventh was sacrificed after veterinary findings 
including pale eyes, cold to touch and blood clots around the teeth. Two high-dose males found death, one 
previously under veterinary treatment for skin lesions. 
Clinical signs: skin lesions, sometimes progressing to open sores 
Body weight: increased body weight and food consumption (M all doses, F mid and high dose), food 
consumption was restricted due to hyperphagia noted in previously conducted rat studies resulting in that 
the body weight increase was non-adverse. 
Hematology: lower red blood cell parameters, increase in neutrophil, lymphocyte and/or monocyte count, 
correlating with presence of inflammatory lesions in the skin 
Clinical chemistry: higher serum glucose in mid and high dose groups, lower albumin and higher globulin 
in mid and high dose groups 
Urinalysis: urine protein and blood in high dose females 
Organ weights: increased thymus weight (M high dose), increased spleen weight (mid and high dose), 
increased liver weight (mid and high dose). A decrease in body weight adjusted prostate weight could be 
detected from the mid dose. 
Pathology, macroscopic: skin lesions in all groups, incomplete recovery in males 
Histopathology: skin lesions, with changes secondary to the skin lesions: extramedullary hematopoiesis 
in spleen and/or liver, lymphocyte hyperplasia of lymph nodes, and bone marrow hypercellularity. 
Periportal microvesicular hepatocytes, brown adipose tissue macrovesiculation, islet fibrosis, pigment 
and hemorrhage in the pancreas, and mammary gland hyperplasia. 
Recovery: Full recovery for clinical pathology changes, organ weights. Incomplete recovery of skin lesions 
in males, mammary gland hyperplasia

Reproduction Toxicity 
Fertility and early embryonic development 
Effects on reproductive organs in adult animals were assessed in the repeat dose toxicity studies. In the 
4w SD rat study, there was a reversible 15-21% reduction in uterine weight in females from the lowest 
dose (10mg/kg BID) to the highest (100mg/kg BID), with some of the high dose females demonstrating 
uterine atrophy. In the 13w rat study, male rats demonstrated a reduction in prostate weight compared 
to body weight at 25 and 75mg/kg BID but otherwise no effects on any male reproductive endpoints 
(sperm count, density, motility, morphology). There were no uterine weight effects in 13w female rats 
making the interpretation of the 4w effects uncertain.   
Effects on reproductive performance and early embryofoetal development were assessed within a GLP 
repeat-dose study conducted in juvenile rats with oral BID administration of larotrectinib from PND7 to 70 
(see below). Mating was initiated in a subset of animals after 28-days of recovery on PND 99. 
Laparohysterectomy was performed on GD 15. Doses were 0.2, 2, and 7.5 mg/kg/dose BID during PND 
7 to 27 and 0.6, 6, and 22.5 mg/kg/dose BID during PND 28 to 70. Lower fertility, male copulation and 
female conception indices as well as lower number of litters per group were observed at mid and high 
doses. This was not considered related to treatment by the applicant.

Maternal mortality: Two max dose (75mg/kg BID) animals were euthanized in extremis on GD11 and 
GD22. One was euthanized due to findings that included: impaired use of a hindlimb and fractured tibia 
(no signs of teratogenesis in implantations). The other was euthanized due to ataxia, prostration, body 
weight loss, and decrease in food consumption. 
Maternal clinical signs: In the max dose (75 mg/kg BID) there was impaired use of the right hindlimb, 
ataxia, prostrate body, decreased defecation, and tremors upon handling. With 30 mg/kg BID, there was 
tremors upon handling, ataxia, and impaired use of the right hindlimb, were noted approximately 2 hours 
following dose administration; however, the applicant did not consider those adverse because they did 
not persist to the daily examinations the following day. 
Maternal body weight: At all doses in the pregnant animals (≥15mg/kg BID): increased body weight gain 
and food consumption from GD14 until GD24. The most extensive increase in weight gain was between 
GD7 and GD21. 
Foetal findings: Intrauterine growth, survival and foetal morphology (external, visceral, and skeletal) 
were unaffected by treatment with larotrectinib. 
Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function 
No pre-natal and postnatal development, including maternal function studies have been submitted. 
Studies in which the offspring (juvenile animals) are dosed and/or further evaluated 
In order to support the twice daily oral administration of larotrectinib as a monotherapy for paediatric 
patients ranging in age from 1 month to 12 years, with advanced cancer, two dose DRF studies and a GLP 
repeat-dose oral toxicity study in juvenile rats were conducted. In the pivotal study, larotrectinib was 
administered via oral gavage from PND 7 to PND 70 followed by a 28-day recovery period. A subset of 
animals was assigned for the assessment of the reproductive potential with mating initiated 28 days after 
end of dosing on PND 99. In the females, laparohysterectomies were performed on GD 15. Doses 
investigated were 0, 0.4, 4 or 15 mg/kg/day from PND 7 to PND 27. From PND 28 to PND 70 the doses 
were increased to 1.2, 12 or 45 mg/kg/day to adjust for lower exposures on PND 28.

Toxicokinetic data 
See section on repeat dose toxicity. 
Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance of the larotrectinib formulations has not been performed since the clinical route of 
administration is oral. 
Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity 
No studies were performed as larotrectinib is a small molecule. No signs for antigenicity were seen in 
repeat-dose toxicity studies in rat and monkey 
Immunotoxicity 
Effects on the immune system were assessed within repeat-dose toxicity studies in rat and monkey. No 
separate studies conducted according to ICH-S9. 
Dependence 
No relevant off-target effects on a range of targets and receptors were seen. Dependence to larotrectinib 
is therefore not likely and no studies were conducted. 
Metabolites 
The O-glucuronide metabolite M14 identified as a major human metabolite does not raise any specific 
concerns. It is regarded as qualified since it is present in plasma of monkey and rat. No other unique or 
relevant disproportionate human metabolites were identified. No dedicated toxicology studies on 
metabolites were therefore conducted. 
Studies on impurities 
Drug substance used in non-clinical safety studies was produced by a process representative of 
production of clinical batches with a similar impurity profile, and specified impurities are therefore 
regarded as toxicologically qualified. No dedicated toxicology studies on impurities were conducted. 
Phototoxicity 
The phototoxic potential of larotrectinib was assess in vitro in BALB/c 3T3 mouse fibroblasts 
(LOXO-101-TOX-017). Larotrectinib did not demonstrate a phototoxic potential in this assay. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Larotrectinib (CAS #1223405-08-0) has the chemical formula C21H24F2N6O6S and a molecular weight of 
526.52g/mol. Larotrectinib is slightly water soluble at 3.6mg/mL at pH3.7 and ~2mg/mL at pH≥7.8. 
From a 100 mg single oral dose in the clinical trials, ~13% and ~7% of larotrectinib was recovered as 
unchanged compound in urine and faeces respectively. Detected metabolites were mostly in the form of 
glucuronide conjugates. The n-octanol/water partition coefficient (log KOW) submitted for larotrectinib 
was inadequate. A surface water predicted environmental concentration (PECSW) was calculated based on 
a, by the applicant stated number of patients in the EU with the propose indication (i.e. NTRK positive 
tumours; n=40,363) giving a PECSW of 0.0079ug/L.

In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points to be addressed: 
The applicant is recommended to conduct a new study on octanol/water partitioning according to OECD 
technical guidelines (e.g. OECD TG107). The study report and the updated ERA will be available by 20 
December 2019. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
This application represents a novel approach for cancer treatment in that the proposed indication is only 
based on a tumour biomarker, the presence of a TRK gene fusion irrespective of the histological origin of 
the tumour. TRK gene fusions tumours are relatively rare, so in the clinical program supporting this 
application some tumour forms are very poorly represented. NTRK fusion tumours are rare and only a 
very limited number of cell lines harbouring NTRK fusions are described in the literature.  
While the pharmacokinetic program provides evidence that the animal models are relevant with regard to 
metabolism, there exists a deficiency in the documentation on the activity of larotrectinib on TRKA, TRKB 
and TRKC in the animal species used for safety evaluation. The applicant has not provided data on the 
activity of larotrectinib on TRK from toxicology species. However, sequence alignment shows a high 
degree of homology between kinase domain from rat, mouse rabbit monkey and human. Key residues for 
binding to larotrectinib, identified from the co-crystal structure of the kinase domain of TRKA in complex 
with larotrectinib, showed 100 % homology between species. A pharmacological relevance of the 
non-clinical animal studies is further supported by the finding of weight gain seen consistently across 
species as well as transient, CNS findings described primarily in juvenile rats. Taken together, it is agreed 
that the species chosen are regarded as appropriate to assess not only off-target but also target-related, 
primary pharmacodynamics effects of larotrectinib. 
Although the nonclinical data package is limited to a small number of TRK fusion cell lines, the data are 
considered to be fully compatible with a tissue-independent activity, involving TRKA, TRKB and TRKC. The 
extrapolation to all tumours with TRK fusions must be based on clinical data. It is still considered of 
importance to acquire further understanding on the tumour biology of the TRK fusion tumours and the 
activity of larotrectinib, particularly in relation to primary and secondary resistance. Such exploratory 
analysis should be part of the clinical study(ies) performed as post-approval measures for a conditional 
marketing approval (see Clinical part of the AR). 
Pharmacokinetics 
The nonclinical pharmacokinetics of larotrectinib is adequately evaluated. It can be noted that there was 
a lack of larotrectinib distribution to some rat tissues that are considered relevant for NTRK positive 
tumours (e.g. liposarcoma, osteosarcoma, ocular cancer or cerebral tumours) but this may be due to 
insufficient sensitivity of the methodology (i.e. <LLOQ in the QBWA study). Of importance for the safety 
evaluation are the observations that the distribution studies show a limited distribution to the brain. 
These studies also show that transporters such as Mdr1a, Mdr1b and Bcrp contribute to the low CNS 
penetration. Since the TRKs are of importance for CNS function, the low distribution to the brain may 
contribute to the safety by limiting pharmacological activity in the adult rodent CNS. The limited 
distribution to the brain is also of importance for the clinical efficacy evaluation for treatment of CNS 
tumours (see discussion on clinical efficacy). What is less clear, and of relevance considering the results 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469135/2019 
Page 43/196 
  
  
 
 
from the juvenile toxicity study, is the extent of the distribution to the postnatal and juvenile CNS (see 
Toxicology section below).  
Toxicology 
With regard to the toxicological aspects, there were several animal deaths in the 28 and 91-day 
repeat-dose toxicity studies. For the 91-day repeat-dose study, deaths are mostly attributed to multiple 
severe skin lesions and inflammation. No clear causes of mortality/moribund conditions were determined 
for the 28d animals. Rats in general demonstrated an unusual skin lesion effect (also seen in the rat 
juvenile toxicity study). No similar skin findings were seen in monkeys nor have there been indications on 
a similar human effect from the clinical trial data. This would indicate them to be rat species specific 
effects. Overall, there were no findings in the repeat-dose toxicity studies that are considered of 
importance for the benefit-risk assessment in the proposed indication or requiring further risk mitigation 
in the clinic. 
Clinical signs of gastrointestinal toxicity were dose limiting in monkeys. In rats, severe toxicity (STD10) 
was observed at doses corresponding to 1 to 2 times the human AUC at the recommended clinical dose. 
No relevant systemic toxicity was observed in monkeys at doses which correspond to > 10 times the 
human AUC at the recommended clinical dose (see section 5.3 of the SmPC). 
Pre-weaning animals (in particular PND9-16) were found to be more sensitive than post-weaning animals 
(i.e. post PND28). There is no clear explanation for this effect and no clear indication on the subject is 
provided by the clinical safety data. A clinical effect on body weight in infants cannot therefore be 
excluded and patients will therefore be monitored accordingly. Body weight gain was decreased in pre 
weaning male and female pups, with a post weaning increase in females at the end of exposure whereas 
reduced body weight gain was seen in males also post weaning without recovery. Based on the 
mechanism of action, foetal harm cannot be excluded when administering larotrectinib to a pregnant 
woman. Women of childbearing potential should have a pregnancy test prior to starting treatment with 
larotrectinib. Women of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraception while taking 
larotrectinib and for at least one month after stopping treatment (see sections 4.5 and 4.6). 
Males of reproductive potential with a non-pregnant woman partner of child bearing potential should be 
advised to use highly effective contraception during treatment with larotrectinib and for at least one 
month after the final dose (see section 4.4 and 4.6 of the SmPC).  
Larotrectinib was not teratogenic and embryotoxic when dosed daily during the period of organogenesis 
to pregnant rats and rabbits at maternotoxic doses, i.e. corresponding to 32-times (rats) and 16-times 
(rabbits) the human AUC at the recommended clinical dose. Larotrectinib crosses the placenta in both 
species (see section 5.3 of the SmPC). 
Overall, preclinical literature data indicate that intact TRK signalling is relevant for both prenatal and 
postnatal brain development and has an important role in synaptic plasticity. 
In the juvenile toxicity studies, there was a 2-2.5d delay in sexual maturation landmarks for both sexes 
(balanopreputial separation in males, vaginal patency in females). These effects may or may not be linked 
to the early growth retardation recorded in both sexes (i.e. pre-PND28). A developmental growth 
retardation connection to sexual maturity seems reasonable for males but as females experienced a boost 
in weight gain after PND28, the delay in vaginal patency may be either a consequence of the earlier 
growth retardation and/or due to a sex-specific post PND28 response. The same issue can be noted for 
the reduction in tibia length recorded in both males and females between PND14 and 52 at the high dose. 
Pre weaning mortality (before PND 21) was observed at the high dose level corresponding to 2.5  to 4 
times the AUC at the recommended dose. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469135/2019 
Page 44/196 
  
  
Nervous system effects (i.e. altered hindlimb functionality and, likely, increases in eyelid closure) 
demonstrated partial recovery. Regarding the observed juvenile eye lid effects that remained during the 
recovery period, the underlying reasons remain unclear. The toxicokinetic data indicates a somewhat 
negative dose accumulation until PND70 so there is likely less of a systemic exposure on PND86. Overall, 
it seems likely that the eye lid effects have a neural basis. Together with the observed increase in total 
activity and impairment of hindlimb motoric function (an effect that may relate to the hindlimb effects 
seen at high dose in pregnant rabbits) which also remained during recovery, there is reason to believe 
that larotrectinib induces neural (possibly long lasting) effects in juvenile animals. It can be noted that the 
non-clinical pharmacokinetics studies did only find limited distribution of larotrectinib to the adult rodent 
central nervous system but it remains unclear how the distribution profile is in juvenile rats. Overall, the 
juvenile toxicity study in rats demonstrated that postnatal larotrectinib exposed pups are especially 
sensitive to exposure and also identified several endpoints concerning both developmental growth and 
behaviour starting from 2/6mg/kg BID. No satisfactory explanation has been provided for the 
observations of hindlimb effects and eyelid effects still remaining in the recovery period and while it can 
be argued that the early ‘brain exposure’ is likely greater in rodents than in humans due to the early 
exposure initiation of PND7, this does not negate the uncertainty that also later (i.e. post PND14 or 
PND21) exposure periods may generate neurodevelopmental effects at lower ‘brain exposure’ (especially 
considering the absence of any systemic exposure margin).  
Fertility studies with larotrectinib have not been conducted. No effects on female reproductive organs 
were seen in the 3 months toxicity studies in rats and monkeys at doses corresponding to approximately 
3 times (female rats) and 17 times (female monkeys) the human AUC at the recommended clinical dose. 
A decrease in pregnancy rate was also reported despite normal mating at the high dose level. In 3 months 
toxicity studies, larotrectinib had no histological effect on the male reproductive organs in rats and 
monkeys at the highest tested doses corresponding to approximately 7 times (male rats) and 10 times 
(male monkeys) the human AUC at the recommended clinical dose. In addition, larotrectinib had no effect 
on spermatogenesis in rats (see section 5.3 of the SmPC). No effects on F1 offspring development were 
seen.  
Growth and nervous system effects were seen at 0.5 to 4 times the AUC at the recommended dose.   
Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with larotrectinib. Larotrectinib was not mutagenic in 
bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assays and in in vitro mammalian mutagenesis assays. Larotrectinib 
was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test at the maximum tolerated dose of 500 mg/kg (see 
section 5.3 of the SmPC). 
Environmental risk assessment 
The Phase I assessment of the ERA for Vitrakvi/larotrectinib by the applicant was based on a proposed 
maximum daily dose of 200mg/kg and, after calculating a refined prevalence Fpen using all eligible 
tumour forms as stated in the Risk Management Plan (RMP), a market penetration factor (Fpen) of 
0.0079%. This gives a Phase I PECSW of 0.0079ug/L which is below the action threshold for Phase II 
assessment (0.01ug/L). The prevalence estimate was based on population frequency estimates for NTRK 
positive tumours for different tumour forms described in different academic articles - giving a 5 year 
prevalence estimate of 40363 patients (data not shown). The presently included log Kow study (giving a 
Log KOW value between 0.67 and 1.85) is of insufficient quality. As a consequence, the available data does 
not allow concluding definitively on the potential risk of larotrectinib to the environment. The applicant is 
recommended to conduct a new study on octanol/water partitioning according to OECD technical 
guidelines (e.g. OECD TG107). The study report and the updated ERA will be available by 20 December 
2019.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The clinical pharmacology studies of larotrectinib in healthy volunteers included a multiple ascending dose 
study, a food and formulation effect study, a mass balance study, a PK study in subjects with renal 
impairment, a PK study in subjects with hepatic impairment and two drug-drug interactions studies (Table 
20 and Table 21). In these studies, larotrectinib was administered as single 100 mg dose or as repeated 
100 mg twice daily for 10 days, except in study LOXO-TRK-16009 where single doses up to 900 mg were 
administered. 
A population-PK analysis, an exposure-response as well as QTc modelling is also provided. In addition, a 
full in vitro package characterising in vitro metabolism, transporters, protein binding as well as potential 
to inhibit or induce enzymes or transporters is provided. 
The proposed indication includes children in all ages, and the paediatric dose has been chosen aiming to 
give a similar larotrectinib exposure as in the adult population.  
Methods 
•  Bioanalysis 
Plasma and urine concentrations of larotrectinib were determined with LC-MS/MS methods. 
•  Non-compartment data analysis 
Standard non-compartment analysis was performed in all studies where rich sampling was applied. 
• 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis 
Plasma concentration from the clinical trials LOXO-TRK-16007 and LOXO-TRK-16012 (healthy subjects, 
full PK profiles ) and LOXO-TRK-14001 (dose escalating phase I in solid tumours, 50 mg QD to 200 mg 
BID, full PK profiles on day 1), LOXO-TRK-15002 (phase II basket trial, 100 mgx2, sparse sampling ), and 
LOXO-TRK15003 (dose escalation + expansion, paediatric patients, full profiles cycle 1 and one additional 
cycle) were included in the popPK analysis. 
All samples below the BQL were set to zero. The dataset consisted of 3287 valid larotrectinib 
concentration measurements from 240 subjects (34 healthy subjects and 206 patients whereof 58 
patients were from the study LOXO-TRK-15003).

A two-compartment model with first order absorption and first order elimination was developed to 
describe the larotrectinib pharmacokinetics. A proportional error model was used to describe residual 
variability.  
The covariates of interest included weight (kg), BSA (m2), age, age category (1-3 months, 3-6 months, 
6-12 months, 1-2 years, 2-6 years, 6-12 years, and >12 years) sex, race, ethnicity, patient status 
(healthy volunteer or patient), baseline renal and hepatic functions (CRCL, SCR, ALB, BILI, AST, ALT, 
ALP). An initial screening of covariates was made graphically. Only BSA and weight appeared to correlate 
to Cl/F and V2/F. Weight was chosen as the preferred covariate. Fixed allometric scaling was used to 
describe the covariate relationship, using an exponent of 0.75 for clearance parameters and an exponent 
of 1 for volume parameters. 
A plot of the eta CL/F values versus age and age category showed a large deviation for the youngest age 
group (Figure 7). To describe the age difference either (1) a maturation function based on post-natal age 
or (2) combinations of the categorical age groups specified in the analysis plan. The model that 
successfully minimized with the lowest objective function value included an age category effect on CL/F 
with 3 distinct age groups (<3 months, ≥3 months to <6 years, and ≥6 years) rather than a maturation 
function.

Absorption  
The absolute bioavailability was estimated to be 34% (range: 32% to 37%) in the mass balance study 
following an oral dose of 100 mg larotrectinib capsule formulation in the fasted state and intravenous 
administration of 7.6 µg (1 µCi) 14C-larotrectinib. 
In cancer patients given larotrectinib capsules (LOXO-TRK-14001), peak plasma levels (Cmax) of 
larotrectinib were achieved at approximately 1 hour after dosing. Half-life (t½) is approximately 3 hours 
and steady state is reached within 8 days with a systemic accumulation of 1.6 fold. At the recommended 
dose of 100 mg taken twice daily, steady state arithmetic mean (± standard deviation) Cmax and daily AUC 
in adults were 914 ± 445 ng/mL and 5410 ± 3813 ng*h/mL, respectively (section 5.2 of the SmPC). 
•  Bioequivalence 
No bioequivalence studies were performed as the final formulation of the capsule was used in all clinical 
studies and there only was a minor modification of the oral solution. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469135/2019  
Page 55/196 
 
 
 
 
•  Relative bioavailability capsule formulation vs oral solution 
The plasma AUC was similar following dosing with solution and capsule formulations, but the Cmax was 
36% higher with the solution and the time taken to reach the maximum concentration (Tmax) was 
approximately 20 minutes earlier for the solution compared to the capsule, see Figure 10 and Table 20. 
Both formulations have been used in efficacy studies in patients with cancer. 
• 
Food interaction 
Administration of a high-fat and high-calorie meal delayed the absorption of larotrectinib relative to 
administration under overnight fasting conditions. The total plasma exposure (AUC0-t and AUC0-∞) was 
comparable following fasted and fed conditions. The median tmax was delayed with approximately 2 hours 
and the Cmax was 35% lower under fed conditions compared to fasting conditions, see Figure 10 and Table 
20. The lower Cmax under fed conditions is not considered clinically relevant and larotrectinib may be given 
without regard to food intake. The excretion of unchanged larotrectinib in urine following administration 
of a single 100 mg capsule was similar under fed and fasting conditions.

Administration of 100 to 900 mg Larotrectinib in LOXO-TRK- 16009 
Distribution 
The mean volume of distribution of larotrectinib in healthy adult subjects was 48 L following intravenous 
administration of an IV microtracer in conjunction with a 100 mg oral dose. The volume of distribution 
during the terminal phase following IV dosing (Vz) in plasma was 66 L. 
Larotrectinib was moderately bound in human plasma over the concentration range 0.1-10 µM with an 
overall mean fraction unbound of 30%. The plasma protein binding was not concentration-dependent. 
The fraction unbound was approximately 30% also in the clinical studies LOXO-TRK-16013 (hepatic 
impairment) and LOXO-TRK-17014 (renal impairment) and not affected by decreased organ function. The 
blood to plasma concentration ratio was approximately 0.9. 
Metabolism 
Larotrectinib was metabolised predominantly by CYP3A4/5 in vitro. Larotrectinib was extensively 
metabolised following an oral dose of 14C-larotrectinib with 19 identified metabolites and 12 additional 
quantified metabolites in plasma, urine and faeces samples from the mass balance study. Larotrectinib 
and M14 were the major radiolabeled components in plasma from all subjects, when analysed 
individually. Mean plasma exposures (AUC0-∞) for LOXO-101 and M14, a glucuronide conjugate, were 
1100 ng*eq·h/g (18.6% of total plasma radioactivity exposure) and 1510 ng*eq·h/g (25.7% of total 
plasma radioactivity exposure) across all subjects. All remaining plasma metabolites were present at 
trace to minor levels. M14 was not believed to contribute to the efficacy or safety of larotrectinib. No other 
plasma metabolite accounted for more than 4% of total plasma radioactivity. M14 was the most abundant 
urinary metabolite and accounted for a mean of 9.4% of dose in urine but was not detected in faeces. The 
radioactivity in faeces consisted of many metabolites in smaller amounts.

Elimination 
The half-life of larotrectinib in plasma of cancer patients given 100 mg twice daily of larotrectinib was 
approximately 3 hours. The main elimination route was hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4 enzyme and 
excretion of metabolites in both urine and faeces.  
•  Mass balance 
The mass balance study LOXO-TRK-16011 was a two-part study including both oral and IV administration 
of [14C]-larotrectinib with a higher oral radiolabelled dose (100 mg /100 µCi) and a microtracer design of 
the IV dose (7.58 µg /1 µCi). The results of the mass balance study is summarised in Table 26 and Figure 
14. Mean clearance (CL) of larotrectinib was approximately 34 L/h following intravenous administration of 
an IV microtracer in conjunction with a 100 mg oral dose of larotrectinib.

Figure 15: Mean % of dose identified in urine and faeces following oral administration of 14C-larotrectinib. 
When an IV microtracer dose was given in conjunction with a 100 mg oral dose of larotrectinib, 35% of the 
administered radioactivity was recovered in faeces and 53% was recovered in urine. Following the IV 
dose, 29% of [14C]-larotrectinib was excreted as unchanged drug in urine. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
A statistical assessment of dose linearity was performed on single-dose data from study 
LOXO-TRK-16009, see Figure 11 and Table 20. A slightly more than dose proportional increase in AUC 
with dose was observed, with a slope estimate of 1.3 and a 95% CI not including 1 when all data in the 
dose range 100-900 mg was used. When only PK data from dose levels 100 to 400 mg were considered, 
dose proportionality was shown. Dose proportionality has not been investigated for doses lower than 100 
mg. No formal dose-linearity assessment was performed on the PK data from multiple dosing.  
In study LOXO-TRK-14001, BID dosing of larotrectinib was tested in ascending dose levels. PK sampling 
was performed on day 1 and day 8. For the clinical dose level 100 mg x 2, where most data were available, 
a somewhat lower average CL/F and longer half-life of larotrectinib was observed on day 8. This is in line 
with data from study LOXO-TRK-1602, where steady state data indicate slightly lower Cl/F and longer 
half-life at steady state. The estimated mean accumulation ratio was 1.23 and 1.6 in the two studies.  
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Average (SD) steady state AUC0-24 was 5410 (3813) ngxh/ml and average Cmax was 914 (445) ng/ml at 
the clinical dose 100 mg BID. 
Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, the inter-patient variability in CL/F was 73%. 
Intra-patient (inter-occasion) variability was not assessed. 
Special populations 
•  Renal impairment 
A dedicated pharmacokinetic study with reduced design, in subjects with end stage renal disease and 
matched-control adult subjects with normal renal function was included in the application. Geometric 
least squares mean plasma larotrectinib AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, and Cmax were approximately 1.40-fold, 
1.46-fold, and 1.25-fold greater, respectively, in subjects with end stage renal disease compared to 
healthy matched subjects (Table 27).

and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment, and in healthy adult control subjects with normal hepatic 
function matched for age, body mass index and sex. All subjects received a single 100 mg dose of 
larotrectinib. An increase in larotrectinib AUC0-inf was observed in subjects with mild, moderate and severe 
hepatic impairment of 1.3, 2 and 3.2-fold respectively versus those with normal hepatic function. Cmax 
was observed to increase slightly by 1.1, 1.1 and 1.5-fold respectively. (Figure 15).

Interim results (cut-off date July 30th, 2018) from the ongoing phase 1/2 Study of larotrectinib in 
Paediatric Patients with Advanced Solid or Primary Central Nervous System Tumours have been 
presented. Pharmacokinetic data were available from 58 paediatric patients. Initially paediatric subjects 
received doses ranging from 9.6 mg/m2 BID to 120 mg/m2 BID. The dose of 100 mg/m2 BID (up to a 
maximum dose of 100 mg BID) in children was chosen to match the adult exposures when administered 
100 mg BID.

•  Healthy subjects 
Mean half-life in healthy subjects ranged from 1.876 to 6.347 hours. In patients, with a QD 
administration, mean half-life ranged from 2.99 to 4.7 h whereas in patients with a BID administration 
mean half-life ranged from 1.56 to 2.99h. In the population pharmacokinetic analysis 34 subjects out of 
240 were healthy subjects. The CL/F was estimated to be 30% higher for healthy subjects.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
• 
Larotrectinib as victim for drug-drug interactions 
Larotrectinib was shown to be a substrate of CYP3A4, P-gp and BCRP in vitro. Clinical data in healthy adult 
subjects (study LOXO-TRK-16010) indicated that co-administration of a single 100 mg larotrectinib dose 
with itraconazole (a strong CYP3A inhibitor and P gp and BCRP inhibitor) 200 mg once daily for 7 days 
increased larotrectinib Cmax and AUC by 2.8 fold and 4.3 fold, respectively. In addition, co-administration 
of a single 100 mg larotrectinib dose with a single dose of 600 mg rifampin (a P-gp and BCRP inhibitor) 
resulted in an increase of larotrectinib Cmax and AUC by 1.8 fold and 1.7 fold, respectively. 
A study in healthy adult subjects indicated that co-administration of a single 100 mg larotrectinib dose 
with rifampin (a strong CYP3A and P-gp inducer) 600 mg twice daily for 11 days decreased larotrectinib 
Cmax and AUC by 71% and 81%, respectively. 
A PBPK model has been submitted in the second round of assessment aiming at predicting the effect of a 
moderate inducer, efavirenz. The model is however not sufficiently qualified to be used for quantitative 
predictions.  
An in vitro study investigating the substrate properties of larotrectinib towards the uptake transporters 
OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 has been requested during assessment and the submitted results show that 
larotrectinib is no substrate of OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. The effect of the single dose rifampicin on 
larotrectinib exposure is therefore believed to be due to inhibition of P-gp and BCRP with no involvement 
of OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. 
No DDI study with drugs affecting gastric pH has been performed. Larotrectinib has pH dependent 
solubility. In vitro studies show that in liquid volumes relevant to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract 
larotrectinib is fully soluble over entire pH range of the GI tract. 
• 
Larotrectinib as perpetrator for drug-drug interactions 
For both CYP3A4 and CYP2B6, significant induction was seen for larotrectinib in vitro with observed 
concentration-dependent increases in CYP3A4 mRNA and CYP2B6 mRNA levels. No induction of CYP1A2 
was seen. In vitro induction data for CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 showed no or minor induction but the 
results was not considered conclusive due to a very low response to the positive control rifampicin. Based 
on the strong induction signal observed for CYP3A4, larotrectinib is still considered a potential PXR inducer 
in vivo. New in vitro data for larotrectinib as an inducer of CYP2C enzymes will be submitted. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469135/2019  
Page 67/196 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In vitro larotrectinib caused time dependent inhibition of CYP3A4. In vitro studies indicate that 
larotrectinib does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 at clinically 
relevant concentrations and is unlikely to affect clearance of substrates of these CYPs. No inhibition of 
OAT1, OCT1, OATP1B3, BCRP, OCT2 and BSEP was observed at 30 uM larotrectinib. For OAT3, MATE1 and 
MATE2-K some inhibition was observed but at concentrations similar or higher than the cut-off for clinical 
relevance. Inhibition of OATP1B1 was observed with an IC50 of 48 uM. In vitro results of P-gp inhibition 
have shown that larotrectinib is not a P-gp inhibitor. 
In a clinical study (LOXO-TRK-16012) with midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate), 10 days of dosing 
larotrectinib 100 mg twice daily to healthy volunteers led to a 1.7–fold increase in midazolam Cmax and 
AUCinf, indicating that the net effect (inhibition + possible induction) of larotrectinib on CYP3A4 is 
inhibition, and that larotrectinib at the 100 mg twice daily dosing is a weak CYP3A4 inhibitor (see section 
4.5 of the SmPC).  
•  Systemic hormonal contraceptives 
There are no data available on the potential effect of larotrectinib on systemic hormonal contraceptives. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
No dedicated mechanism of action studies were submitted by the applicant. 
Vitrakvi (larotrectinib) is an orally bioavailable targeted agent directed against TRK-fusion proteins.  
Tropomyosin receptor kinases (TRKs) are a family of tyrosine kinases that bind neurotrophins, a family of 
growth factors important to the formation and function of the nervous system. In cancer, the 
neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor (NTRK), NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3 genes, which encode for the 
TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC proteins, respectively, are subject to gene re-arrangements that lead to aberrant 
TRK protein expression with ligand-independent constitutive kinase activity and subsequent constitutive 
downstream pathway activation, including pathways involved in cell proliferation and survival. NTRK gene 
fusions appear to be widely distributed across histologically diverse adult and paediatric cancers.  
In normal physiology, TRK receptors are involved in the regulation of pain (TRKA), memory and weight 
regulation (TRKB) and proprioception (TRKC).  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Relationship between plasma concentration and response 
Interim data from three ongoing clinical studies (LOXO-TRK-14001 (adult patients, n=56), 
LOXO-TRK-15002 (patients age >12 years, n=40) and LOXO-TRK-15003 (paediatric patients, n=23)) 
were included in the exposure-response analysis (Table 22). The overall best response (complete or 
partial response) was analysed using a generalized linear model. The log-odds ratio (i.e. the logit of the 
probability) described the probability of a response on the predictors of interest. Several predictors were 
evaluated, and among these, exposure measures were included (calculated using non-compartmental 
methods). The first analysis included all patients, regardless of fusion protein status, and the predictors 
found were NTRK fusion (strongest predictor), absolute neutrophil count, and prior radiation treatment 
(yes/no). None of the larotrectinib exposure measures tested (e.g., AUC, Cavg, or Cmax) had a 
statistically significant effect on the probability of a response. A subgroup analysis was also conducted in 
in the positive NTRK fusion patients. The predictor found in the model was absolute neutrophil count.

EMA/CHMP/469135/2019  
Page 68/196 
 
 
 
Relationship between larotrectinib exposure and QTcF prolongation  
In a placebo controlled, single ascending dose study, 36 healthy adult subjects were administered single 
doses ranging from 100 mg to 900 mg larotrectinib, holter monitors were used to collect continuous 
12-lead ECG data from pre-dose until 24 hours post-dose. The relationship between larotrectinib 
concentrations and dQTc was explored using a linear mixed-effect model. The model diagnostics indicate 
a delay between Cmax and the highest observed change that has not been accounted for. The slope of the 
regressions of ddQTcF on larotrectinib was negative, -0.0005 (90% CI: -0.0008, -0.0003) and was 
statistically significant with p-value of 0.0004. Larotrectinib did not prolong the QT interval to any 
clinically relevant extent.  
The 200 mg dose corresponds to a peak exposure (Cmax) similar to that observed with larotrectinib 100 
mg BID at steady state. A shortening of QTcF was observed with larotrectinib dosing, with a maximum 
mean effect observed between 3 and 24 hours after Cmax, with a geometric mean decrease in QTcF from 
baseline of 13.2 msec (range 10 to 15.6 msec). 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Methods 
The bioanalysis methods used are acceptable. 
The Applicant has developed a population PK model to describe the PK data from the clinical studies.  The 
model includes allometric scaling with fixed exponents of 0.75 for clearance parameters and an exponent 
of 1 for volume parameters. The difference in CL/F values for different age categories were described with 
an age category effect on CL/F with 3 distinct age groups (<3 months, ≥3 months to <6 years, and ≥6 
years). Overall, the model appears to capture the median of the observed data reasonably well. It should 
however be noted that the amount of data in the youngest age groups are limited, and the estimation of 
the age category effects may be refined when more data emerge. 
ADME 
The results of in vitro permeability data are not considered conclusive and the absolute bioavailability is 
estimated to 34%. Based on the high solubility and that absorption data do not indicate high absorption, 
larotrectinib is probably a BCS class III compound. 
The food interaction study showed similar AUC and somewhat lower Cmax (34%) when larotrectinib was 
given with a high fat food compared with fasting conditions. The lower Cmax is not expected to have clinical 
relevance, and the data supports the clinical recommendation that larotrectinib can be taken irrespective 
of meals (see section 4.2 of the SmPC). The formulations to be marketed have been used in the clinical 
studies. The solution and the capsule have the same bioavailability, and the higher Cmax seen with the 
solution (36%) is considered of no clinical relevance. The mean volume of distribution indicates moderate 
distribution into tissues from the plasma. 
The elimination pathways of larotrectinib are considered sufficiently elucidated. Around 29% of the dose 
is excreted unchanged in urine indicating that direct renal excretion accounted for 29% of total clearance.  
The majority of the remaining drug is excreted in urine and faeces as metabolites, mainly produced by 
CYP3A4. This is supported by the relatively large effect seen in the interaction study with the strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole.  
In the mass-balance study, metabolite profiling was performed following an oral dose and more than 90% 
of the recovered radioactivity in urine was identified. However, in faeces quantified components 
accounted for a mean of 31.5% of dose compared to the total radioactivity recovered in faeces, which was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469135/2019  
Page 69/196 
 
 
 
55% of dose. The applicant suggests the presence of numerous trace-level metabolites that were below 
the limit of quantification as an explanation of the difference. This explanation is considered acceptable. 
In plasma, approximately 58% of the total radioactivity was identified. This is considered acceptable since 
the major metabolite (M14), contributing to approximately 30% of the AUC of drug related material, is 
structurally characterised. No other plasma metabolite accounted for more than 4% of total plasma 
radioactivity. 
Metabolite M14 is a secondary glucuronide and not expected to contribute to the efficacy and safety of 
larotrectinib. Therefore, further characterisation if its pharmacokinetics is not considered necessary.  
Larotrectinib is chiral and has two chiral centres. No specific studies were performed to investigate 
interconversion in vivo. The optical purity in the starting material however was high and no 
interconversion has been observed in vitro. This indicates that the probability of interconversion is low 
also in vivo. 
Children 
The Applicant is seeking approval of larotrectinib in children of all ages, with a body-size adjusted dose 
(100 mg/m2) for the smallest children up to a BSA of 1 m2, followed by the adult dose from 1 m2. The 
Applicant has aimed at a dose producing similar exposure in children as in adults receiving 100 mg BID. 
As there is limited efficacy and safety data available in children, pharmacokinetic data is needed to bridge 
to the clinical experience in adults. In particular, given the preclinical toxicity findings in juvenile animals 
and the tendency to higher rate of adverse events in smaller children, it appears important not to expose 
children to higher larotrectinib concentrations than necessary for efficacy.  
Exposure data was presented, derived using non-compartmental analysis of drug exposure, between age 
or BSA and AUC. The plot indicated a risk for overexposure of the smallest children. The population PK 
model describes the exposure in the paediatric population adequately. At the recommended dose, the 
Cmax in paediatric patients (≥3 months to <12 years of age) was higher than in adults, but the AUC was 
similar to that in adults. For paediatric patients older than 12 years of age, the recommended dose is 
likely to give similar Cmax and AUC as observed in adults. 
The simulated plots show that children aged <3 months (n= 4 subjects) at the recommended dose of 100 
mg/m2 with a maximum of 100 mg BID are expected to have a GMR AUC,ss and Cmax >3-fold higher than 
adults ≥18 years of age given the dose of 100 mg BID. A different dose is not proposed for the smallest 
children. As there is uncertainty in the predicted exposure in the smallest children (< 6 years of age), due 
to few subjects included in each age group, there is at present not a sufficient amount of data available to 
be able to propose an alternative dosing in children. In particular, additional data in smaller children 
would be needed to be able to potentially propose a lower dose/m2 in the smallest children, and to define 
an age cut-off at which a lower dose would be needed.  
Given the convincing efficacy results and manageable short-term side effects of larotrectinib in children of 
all age groups dosed with the proposed dose 100 mg/m2, the benefit/risk of larotrectinib in children using 
this dose can be considered positive. In order to avoid unnecessary overexposure, and potential risks for 
long-term side effects, however, the Applicant has committed to collect more PK data in children, and to 
re-evaluate the dose in different age groups when more data is collected.  
Other special populations 
The applicant performed a reduced study design in subjects with renal impairment. The ESRD patients 
included were all on haemodialysis; therefore, the potential effect on the hepatic elimination of the drug 
may be underestimated. It cannot be excluded that the effect in ESRD patients without haemodialysis 
may be somewhat larger due to a potential effect on hepatic elimination. The possible increase is however 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469135/2019  
Page 70/196 
 
 
 
not deemed to be of a clinically relevant extent and the conclusion that no dose adjustment is necessary 
for patients with renal impairment is supported. 
The Applicant has performed a full hepatic impairment study, and the overall design appears relevant. 
The Applicant has submitted individual Child Pugh data to verify that the subjects in the severe hepatic 
impairment group had abnormal levels of biomarkers indicative of metabolic impairment (albumin, 
bilirubin, prothrombin time). The study can thus be considered acceptable and the Child Pugh C group 
representative for subjects with severe hepatic impairment. 
The starting dose of VITRAKVI should be reduced by 50% in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) to 
severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment. No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild 
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A). Despite the wide therapeutic window, a decrease in dose is 
reasonable to bring this population closer in drug exposure to the average study population. Given the 
3.2-fold increase in exposure observed in the study, the exposure should still be somewhat higher than 
the average population, which is acceptable. 
Based on graphical analysis, the covariates gender and race were considered to not be significant in the 
PopPK model. As majority of the included patients were Caucasian, a conclusion on the potential effect of 
race on larotrectinib PK cannot be made. Weight was included in the model with estimated exponents. 
There was not sufficient PK data available in elderly (only for 2 patients over 65 years) for a conclusion to 
be drawn and a dose adjustment in this patient population is not recommended. Healthy subjects were 
found to have a 30% higher CL/F compared to patients. 
Interactions 
Larotrectinib was shown to be a substrate of CYP3A4, P-gp and BCRP in vitro. This was confirmed in the 
in vivo study with itraconazole and rifampicin.  
There is a clinical drug-drug interaction study available with a strong CYP3A4/Pgp inducer rifampicin, 
showing a substantial decrease in larotrectinib exposure (81% lower AUC). No clinical data is available on 
the effect of a moderate inducer, but a decrease in larotrectinib exposure is expected. PBPK modelling of 
the effect of a moderate inducer, efavirenz, has been submitted, suggesting a 64% decrease in 
larotrectinib AUC. The model is not sufficiently qualified or reported to be used for regulatory decision 
making, but the predicted effect size is of an expected magnitude. Co-administration of strong or 
moderate CYP3A4/P-gp inducers (e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampicin, or 
St. John’s Wort) should be avoided with larotrectinib due to a risk of decreased exposure (see section 4.4 
of the SmPC). No clinical data is available on the effect of a moderate inducer, but a decrease in 
larotrectinib exposure is expected. 
Co administration of larotrectinib with strong CYP3A inhibitors, P gp and BCRP inhibitors (e.g. atazanavir, 
clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, 
telithromycin, troleandomycin, voriconazole or grapefruit) may increase larotrectinib plasma 
concentrations. If co administration with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is necessary, the larotrectinib dose 
should be reduced by 50%. After the inhibitor has been discontinued for 3 to 5 elimination half-lives, 
larotrectinib should be resumed at the dose taken prior to initiating the CYP3A4 inhibitor (see sections 4.2 
and 4.5 of the SmPC). 
Theoretically, the use of Pgp inhibitors may increase the concentrations of larotrectinib in the brain with 
a potentially increased risk of CNS-related adverse reactions. The Applicant however argues based on 
literature data that the clinical risk for an increased CNS activity of drugs when combined with Pgp 
inhibitors in general appears to be low. This is agreed. There is no clinical data to judge whether Pgp 
inhibitor may increase CNS exposure to larotrectinib. Of note, larotrectinib should be dose adjusted if 
used together with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, which also includes most strong Pgp inhibitors, and this 
would decrease the risk for a clinically relevant interaction at the blood-brain barrier.

An in vitro study investigating the substrate properties of larotrectinib towards the uptake transporters 
OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 has been submitted and the results show that larotrectinib is no substrate of 
OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. The effect of the single dose rifampicin on larotrectinib exposure (1.7-fold increase 
in AUC of larotrectinib) is hence believed to be due to inhibition of P-gp and BCRP with no involvement of 
OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. 
An in vivo study with midazolam was submitted and Cmax and AUC0-inf were approximately 1.7-fold higher 
when midazolam was administered in combination with larotrectinib than when administered alone. This 
indicates that larotrectinib is a weak CYP3A4 inhibitor. Caution should be exercised with concomitant use 
of CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic range (e.g. alfentanil, ciclosporin, dihydroergotamine, 
ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, or tacrolimus) in patients taking larotrectinib. If 
concomitant use of these CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic range is required in patients taking 
larotrectinib, dose reductions of the CYP3A substrates may be required due to adverse reactions (see 
section 4.5 of the SmPC). 
Larotrectinib is an inducer of both CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 in vitro. No induction was seen in the midazolam 
study but the results cannot at the moment be extrapolated to other PXR regulated enzymes as 
larotrectinib is also an in vitro inhibitor of CYP3A4. The Applicant has provided in vitro induction data for 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. No or very minor induction was observed in response to increasing 
concentrations of larotrectinib. The response to the positive control rifampicin was however very low, 
questioning the ability of the experimental setup to detect clinical CYP2C inhibitors. Based on the strong 
induction signal observed for CYP3A4, larotrecinib is still considered a potential PXR inducer in vivo, and 
induction of CYP2C enzymes (as well as other PXR regulated enzymes and transporters) in vivo cannot be 
excluded based on the current in vitro data due to the low sensitivity of the experimental system. The 
applicant is recommended to submit new in vitro induction data for CYP2C. If the risk for CYP2C induction 
cannot be excluded based on the new in vitro data, an in vivo study with a sensitive CYP2C substrate may 
be needed to shed light on the risk for clinical PXR induction. Awaiting these data, a warning is included 
in the section 4.5 of the SmPC. Co administration of larotrectinib with CYP2C8, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 
substrates (e.g. repaglinide, warfarin, tolbutamide or omeprazole) may decrease their exposure.  
No in vivo study with a CYP2B6 substrate has been performed. An in vivo study is not considered an 
absolute requirement because there are few clinically relevant substrates of CYP2B6. The in vitro finding 
is however described in the SmPC. Co administration of larotrectinib with CYP2B6 substrates (e.g. 
bupropion, efavirenz) may decrease their exposure. 
There is no clinical data addressing the effect of larotrectinib on systemic contraceptive steroids. The risk 
for loss of efficacy of hormonal contraceptives due to induction appears low, given the net inhibitory effect 
of larotrectinib on CYP3A4. However, given the in vitro inducing effects on CYP3A4 as a model for PXR 
induction and on CYP2B6 as a model for CAR induction, the risk for an inducing effect on e g UGT 
metabolism cannot be excluded. In addition, the Guideline on the Investigation of Drug Interaction 
recommends an in vivo DDI study with hormonal contraceptives for all human teratogens, to account also 
for potential mechanisms of induction that are presently unknown.  The lack of knowledge is 
communicated in the SmPC together with a recommendation to women using systemic contraceptive 
steroids to add a barrier method. 
In vitro studies evaluating the interaction potential of larotrectinib on transporters showed a signal on 
OATP1B1 inhibition. No clinical studies have been performed to investigate interactions with OATP1B1 
substrates. Therefore, it cannot be excluded whether co administration of larotrectinib with OATP1B1 
substrates (e.g. valsartan, statins) may increase their exposure (see section 4.5 of the SmPC). 
Larotrectinib has pH dependent solubility however it is unlikely to be affected by pH modifying agents.

Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship 
The applicant developed an exposure-response model with the objective to identify primary predictors of 
response. Drug exposure parameters were calculated using non-compartmental methods which are not 
optimal due to sparse sampling. In addition, possible issues with the model development procedure exist, 
but will not be pursued further due the weak clinical relevance. During analysis of the full data set 
(including patients with and without NTRK fusion), the strongest predictor of response was found to be 
the presence of NTRK fusion. None of the larotrectinib exposure measures tested (e.g., AUC, Cavg, or 
Cmax) were found to have a statistically significant effect on the probability of a response. Because the 
dose range investigated was narrow, a definitive conclusion on the relationship between exposure and 
efficacy cannot be made. During model based analysis of the subgroup of patients with NTRK fusion, it 
was found that the patients with a lower average absolute neutrophil count had a higher response rate. A 
discussion on the clinical relevance of this finding in the target population was not provided. An interim 
exposure-safety analysis was performed using exposure metrics from the non-compartmental analysis, 
which is a weakness. A relationship was found between larotrectinib exposure and the risk for anaemia. 
In a single ascending dose study (100-900 mg) the cardiac effect and pharmacokinetics of larotrectinib in 
healthy adult subjects were evaluated. A QTcF shortening was observed and the clinical relevance of this 
finding has not been established.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Due to the uncertainty in exposure estimates for the youngest children, the applicant has agreed to 
provide and updated model including available data up to cut-off date June 2019. In addition, the 
Applicant has committed to continue collecting more paediatric PK data. If deemed warranted, the 
paediatric dose may be refined when enough PK-data is available to support a new (lower) dose.  
Furthermore, due to the limited efficacy data base, comprehensive data is required post-authorisation 
with regard to histology-independent efficacy. Among the anatomy-based tumour types studied in a 
clinical trial setting there are tumour types with single patients that did not achieve objective response 
and it is not known if tissue-specific bypass mechanisms such as was seen for BRAF inhibitors could exist 
also for NTRK fusions. A conditional marketing authorisation is therefore considered. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology in 
the context of a conditional MA: 
- In order to further confirm the appropriate dose recommended in paediatric patients, the MAH should 
submit an updated pop PK model based on additional PK sampling in patients aged 1 month to 6 years 
from study LOXO-TRK-15003 (SCOUT). 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Of the three studies included in the primary efficacy assessment (Table 23), two included a 
dose-escalation phase; these trials are described here, although these are also considered main studies.

Study LOXO-TRK-14001  
A Phase 1 Study of the oral TRK inhibitor LOXO-101 in adult patients with solid tumours 
Methods 
Study LOXO-TRK-14001 is an ongoing, multicentre, uncontrolled, open-label Phase 1 dose escalation 
study in adult patients with advanced solid tumours.  There are 2 study periods: 
Dose escalation phase (complete, n = 61): patients received larotrectinib dose levels that ranged from 
50 mg once daily (QD) to 200 mg twice daily (BID). 
Expansion phase (ongoing, n = 9): for patients with documented NTRK gene fusion and for patients whom 
the Investigator believed might benefit from a highly selective TRK inhibitor.  All patients received 
larotrectinib 100 mg BID. 
The study recruitment was initiated in May 2014. The clinical protocol has been amended several times 
with substantial changes to the study design, including changes in inclusion and exclusion criteria, 
number of patients, dose regimen, schedule of events, concurrent medication, etc. 
Rationale for Study Design and Starting Dose 
The rat, as the most sensitive species, was used for the calculation of the maximum recommended 
starting dose. The no-observable-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) was determined to be 20 mg/kg/day. The 
severely toxic dose in 10% of animals (STD10) was not established in the 28-day repeat-dose study, as 
no severe toxicities were induced in the rat. Therefore, the high dose of 200 mg/kg/day was used to 
calculate the maximum recommended starting dose for Phase 1 of 210 mg/day. The actual starting dose 
of 50 mg QD represented approximately 25% of this calculated maximum starting dose. Based on 
preclinical pharmacology experiments with human cancer cells in vitro and in murine xenograft models, 
the projected range of doses expected to provide inhibition of TRK in tumours was 50 to 400 mg QD or 
BID. 
Dose escalation 
The Dose Escalation Phase of the study employed a classical “3+3” design, with 3 to 6 patients to be 
enrolled in each cohort. Enrolment in the next dose escalation cohort could begin, with SRC approval, 
provided that > 1 DLT in ≤ 6 patients was not observed.  
Patients not receiving 75% of the planned total dose in Cycle 1 (C1) (i.e., who discontinued treatment for 
reasons unrelated to study drug toxicity or who missed doses due to noncompliance) were considered to 
have inadequate study drug exposure and were to be replaced. The dose escalation was to stop when ≥ 
2 patients within a dose escalation cohort had experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Dose escalation 
decisions were based on C1 safety data. However, the SRC periodically reviewed safety from all treatment 
cycles. The SRC also periodically reviewed serious adverse events (SAEs) and other safety-related data 
throughout the conduct of the study. 
DLT was pre-defined as any of the following treatment-emergent events occurring in the first 28 days 
(i.e., in C1): 
• Grade 3 or 4 non-haematological toxicity, with the exception of fatigue, asthenia, nausea, or other 
manageable constitutional symptom. 
• Grade 3 or 4 vomiting or diarrhoea that persists for more than 24 hours despite anti-emetics or anti- 
diarrhoeals. 
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding. 
• Grade 4 anaemia lasting more than 7 days and not explained by underlying condition. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469135/2019  
Page 74/196 
 
 
 
• Grade 4 neutropenia lasting more than 7 days. 
• Any toxicity resulting in discontinuation or dose reduction of treatment (with the exception of symptoms 
related to progressive disease). 
Expansion Cohorts 
In a protocol amendment (2.1), two expansion cohorts, 1 cohort for patients with NTRK fusions and 1 
cohort for all other patients, were included. In the expansion cohorts, patients were to be treated at the 
MTD or at a lower dose level selected by the Sponsor as likely to provide clinically meaningful target 
inhibition. The study drug schedule and treatment assessments for patients enrolled in these 2 expansion 
cohorts were to be the same as in the Dose-Escalation Phase. 
Participants 
The main criteria for inclusion in this study were: 
•  Adult patients with a locally advanced or metastatic solid tumour that has progressed or was 
nonresponsive to available therapies, are unfit for standard chemotherapy or for which no 
standard or available curative therapy exists. 
• 
For patients being enrolled into a specific expansion cohort, evidence of an NTRK fusion or 
tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) molecular characteristics as specified for that cohort, such as 
an amplification, mutation or other alteration that may interfere with TRK signalling as previously 
determined with prior testing from a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments 
(CLIA)-certified or equivalent certified laboratory.  Additionally, patients who, in the opinion and 
clinical judgement of the local Investigator, may derive benefit from a targeted TRK inhibitor like 
larotrectinib, may also enrol.  
•  At least 18 years of age. 
• 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2 and life expectancy 
of at least 3 months. 
•  Adequate hematologic status (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 × 109/L and platelet count 
≥ 100.0 × 109/L without growth factors or transfusions), hepatic function (alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) < 2.5 × the upper limit of normal 
(ULN) or < 5 × ULN with documented liver involvement and total bilirubin < 1.5 × ULN), and renal 
function (glomerular filtration rate ≥ 30 mL/minute). 
•  No current or recent (6 months) clinically significant active cardiovascular (CV) disease, including 
myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, or prolonged corrected QT (QTc) interval > 480 
milliseconds. 
•  No current treatment with a strong cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitor or inducer, and no 
malabsorption syndrome or other condition affecting PO absorption. 
Treatments 
Larotrectinib was administered orally (PO), once (QD) or twice daily (BID).  Patients received the assigned 
larotrectinib dose on Day -3 or Day 1, depending on the protocol version (either QD or BID in accordance 
with the cohort assignment).  Cycles were 28 days.  Dose escalation was to proceed through the planned 
dose escalation cohort levels (50 mg QD, 100 mg QD, 100 mg BID, 200 mg QD, 150 mg BID, 200 mg 
BID) or until the MTD was reached, or until the Sponsor determined, based on available data (safety, 
clinical activity, and PK exposure), that a suitable dose had been achieved. Dose advancement was 
overseen by a Safety Review Committee.

Objectives 
The study objectives were to determine the safety of oral larotrectinib, including dose-limiting toxicity 
(DLT), in adult patients with an advanced solid tumour, characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties, 
to describe antitumor activity, and to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the appropriate 
dose of larotrectinib for further clinical investigation. 
Endpoints 
The primary endpoint of the study was safety, MTD, and recommended dose for further clinical 
investigation.  Secondary endpoints included overall response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR) 
and other measures of antitumor efficacy as determined by Investigator (INV) assessment, and PK 
variables. 
Standard safety tests for investigational oncologic agents were employed, including physical 
examinations (including vital signs, body weight, and performance status), haematology, serum 
chemistries, urinalysis, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and adverse events (AEs). 
Sample size 
According to the SAP, 3 to 6 patients were planned to be enrolled in each dose cohort in the escalation 
phase, which was deemed to be a safe and conventional approach in dose escalation of a novel oncologic 
agent. Approximately 20 patients are targeted for each of the 2 expansion cohorts defined: patients 
bearing the NTRK fusion, and other patients not otherwise specified. Approximately 20 patients per cohort 
would provide for a preliminary assessment of the antitumor activity. For example, if the observed ORR is 
high, i.e. greater than 50%, within a cohort, then the corresponding lower limit of a 1-sided exact 90% CI 
would exclude true response rates that are considered marginal (i.e. less than 30%). 
Statistical Methods  
Summary statistics were used to present safety data.   
The estimate of the ORR was calculated based on crude proportion of patients with best overall response 
of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) that were confirmed, using RECIST v1.1, or RANO, as 
appropriate to tumour type, using Investigator assessment.  The estimate of the ORR was to be 
accompanied by a 1- and 2-sided CIs with various coverage probabilities (e.g., 80%, 95%).  
DOR was calculated for patients who achieved CR or PR as their best overall response.  
All analyses are made on observed data only, with no imputations for missing values.

Analysis sets for this interim analysis are Safety Analysis Set and Full Analysis Set, which are identical and 
include all enrolled patients who receive 1 or more doses of larotrectinib.   
In the original version of the protocol, PFS at 6 and 12 months was planned to be evaluated, however, 
omitted in the SAP. The applicant performed this analysis on the request by the Agency. 
Results 
The first patient was enrolled 12 May 2014. 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
Study LOXO-TRK-14001 is an ongoing, multicentre, uncontrolled, open-label Phase 1 dose escalation 
study in adult patients with advanced solid tumours.  The clinical protocol has been amended multiple 
times with substantial changes to the study design, including selection and number of patients, dose 
regimen, schedule of events, concomitant medication, etc. In Version 2.1 of the protocol, the primary 
objective and selection of the study population were adjusted to focus on an enriched biologically complex 
population and additional tumour types; the number of patients expanded; dosing instructions and some 
measurements were adjusted. By Version 3.1, the study that previously was described as a Phase 1a 
(dose-escalation) / 1b (expansion) study is now identified as a Phase 1, the design of the dose-escalation 
phase was changed to a “standard 3+3 design” and the number of subjects planned decreased, QD dose 
regimens were added, dose escalation procedure and the schedule of events was updated, as well as the 
planned efficacy analyses. Version 4.0 of the protocol was implemented after initiation of the 
LOXO-TRK-15002 and the LOXO-TRK-15003 study, and included, among others, modifications of the 
dose levels planned, selection of the dose of 100 mg BID in the dose escalation phase of the study (which 
is the dose chosen for the Phase 2 study), inclusion of liquid formulation and tumour assessment by 
RANO, updates of the sample size for the expansion cohorts and the planned efficacy analyses, as well as 
updates of prohibited concomitant medications, schedule of assessments, and further adjustments of 
inclusion and exclusion criteria. The latest version of the protocol (Version 5.0) is dated September 2017. 
The major changes in this version are that the patients to be enrolled into the expansion part of the study 
will have a proven NTRK fusion, and that the sample size for the expansion cohorts is updated.  
Considering the explorative nature of the Study LOXO-TRK-14001, the multiple changes of the study 
design and the type of these changes, the gathered data would normally not be regarded as sufficiently 
robust for use as pivotal evidence. 
Protocol deviations 
Significant protocol deviations are defined as deviations to inclusion or exclusion criteria, conduct of the 
trial, patient management or patient assessment. According to the Interim Clinical Study Report, 23 out 
of a total of 392 protocol deviations identified were found to be significant and were related to the 
investigational product (8 patients), informed consent (5), eligibility criteria (4), study procedures (4), 
and prohibited concomitant medications (2).

Dose selection 
An MTD was not identified. Discontinuation due to AEs was low at all doses (0% in doses 200 mg QD and 
150-200 mg BID). The time on treatment cannot be compared across dose cohorts since they consist of 
different proportions of patients with NTRK fusions (likely to respond).  
The Safety review committee (SRC), in consultation with the Sponsor, elected to expand enrolment at 
100 mg BID, given the clinical responses already observed at that dose, and in light of pharmacology 
models suggesting that larotrectinib exposures at this dose were providing sustained target coverage. 
The rationale for the selection of the 100 mg BID dose for expansion, and consequently for further 
development, was affected by a transient safety issue regarding a patient at the 150 dose level. The dose 
level 150 mg BID was subsequently cleared, and also the 200 mg BID cohort did not fulfil MTD criteria 
with only 1/6 patients experiencing a DLT.  The dose selection of 100 mg BID was considered supported 
by PK data suggesting that the achieved unbound concentration of larotrectinib at Cmin (12 nM) during 
steady-state at the dose 100 mg BID (n=5) appeared to be greater than the in vitro IC50 (range 1 - 10 
nM) for inhibition of TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC, and at Cmax “much greater” than the IC90 for inhibition of all 
three TRK kinases. 
Efficacy 
The efficacy results are presented in the section Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses AND 
meta-analysis). 
Study LOXO-TRK-15003 (“SCOUT”) 
A Phase 1/2 Study of the Oral TRK Inhibitor LOXO 101 in Paediatric Patients with Advanced 
Solid or Primary Central Nervous System Tumours 
Methods 
Study LOXO-TRK-15003 is an ongoing, multicentre, multinational, open-label Phase 1/ 2 study in 
paediatric patients aged 1 month to 21 years with advanced solid or primary CNS tumours.  The study is 
divided into: 
• 
• 
• 
Phase 1 dose escalation portion (complete, n = 24). Larotrectinib was administered twice daily, 
treating between 3 and 9 patients at 1 of 5 planned dose levels or until the MTD was reached.  
When the optimal dose was thus identified, a Phase 1 expansion cohort of up to 18 patients was 
planned to further define its safety profile. 
Phase 1 dose expansion portion (ongoing, n = 5) to further define the safety profile. 
Phase 2 (ongoing, n = 14).  Enrolment is restricted to patients with NTRK gene fusion cancer and 
included 3 selected cohorts of paediatric patients: infantile fibrosarcoma, other extracranial solid 
tumours, and primary CNS tumours. 
The study started in December 2015 and by the data cut-off of 19 February 2018, a total of 43 patients 
were enrolled, of whom 34 had TRK fusion cancer. The clinical protocol has been amended repeatedly on 
the global and country level with substantial changes made in the study design, including selection of 
patient population, eligibility criteria, sample size, dose modification, study duration, retreatment, etc. 
The latest protocol version is 9.2, dated October 2017. The SAP was written in August 2017 for the 
purpose of the first interim analysis.

Main inclusion criteria 
- Phase 1:  
Between 1 and 21 years of age with a locally advanced or metastatic solid tumour or primary CNS

Treatments 
Larotrectinib (LOXO-101, investigational product) was given orally either as a capsule or as a solution 
twice daily (BID) as continuous dosing.  Initially a physiologically-based PK approach (SimCyp) was used 
to determine an individual dose (in mg/m2) that factored in age and body surface area (BSA) with the 
intent of matching the exposure (AUC) of previously tested adult doses that had been deemed safe. For 
Cohorts 1 (infantile fibrosarcoma) and 2 (other extracranial solid tumours), these adult-equivalent doses 
were 100 mg BID and 150 mg BID, respectively. The dosing scheme was subsequently changed to a 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469135/2019  
Page 80/196 
 
 
 
simple BSA-based approach as further outlined in the protocol. Treatment for an individual patient was to 
continue until the occurrence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other reason for 
discontinuation. 
Table 32: Dosing scheme in study LOXO-TRK-15003 
Review of PK data from Cohorts 1 and 2 indicated that the SimCyp algorithm resulted in lower exposures 
in paediatric patients than anticipated. Some patients in these cohorts required several dose increases to 
achieve the desired exposure. It was concluded that the SimCyp model was not useful and that a simple 
BSA-based dose would provide more consistent exposures. The overall dosing strategy for this study was 
to match the exposure in adults, for whom the recommended dose was 100 mg BID. Based on PK 
analyses, the dose for Cohort 3 (primary CNS tumours) was set at 100 mg/m2 BID (with a maximum of 
100 mg BID). 
Due to the above-mentioned titrations, Cohorts 1 and 2 contained a heterogeneity of actual doses as 
expressed in mg/m2. Hence, this report uses the nomenclature “Cohort 1, Cohort 2, and Cohort 3” to 
describe the cohorts. 
Larotrectinib was provided in various forms for oral dosing as follows: 
• Larotrectinib solution was a clear, yellow-to-reddish solution at a concentration of 20 mg/mL, provided 
to the patient in single-patient amber oval bottles containing 60 mL of solution. 
• Larotrectinib capsules of 25 mg (size 2) or 100 mg (size 0) were used for doses of 25 mg or greater. 
Both capsules were of hard gelatin, white in colour, and distinguishable by size; these were provided in 
bottles of 72 capsules/bottle. 
• Prior to availability of the formulated solution, larotrectinib as a reddish-orange powder was provided 
for the pharmacist to compound into a 20 mg/mL solution for oral administration. (Three patients enrolled 
early in the study received this dosage form before being transferred over to the oral solution.) 
Objectives and endpoints 
Phase 1 
The primary objective was to determine the safety and dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of oral larotrectinib 
in paediatric patients with advanced solid or primary central nervous system (CNS) tumours.  Secondary 
objectives included pharmacokinetic characterization, identification of maximum tolerated dose (MTD) 
and/or the appropriate dose of larotrectinib, to describe antitumor activity, and to study pain and 
health-related quality of life aspects in this patient population.   
Phase 2 
The primary objective was to determine the overall response rate (ORR) in paediatric patients with an 
advanced cancer harbouring an NTRK fusion who received larotrectinib.  Secondary objectives included 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469135/2019  
Page 81/196 
 
 
 
 
the study of other efficacy parameters including duration of response (DOR), and to further assess the 
safety and tolerability of larotrectinib. 
Sample size 
Phase 1 Dose escalation: Up to 6 patients evaluable for safety were to be enrolled in each dose cohort 
based on a Phase 1 rolling 6 design (Skolnik 2008) with the exception of Cohorts 3, 4, and 5, which could 
enrol up to 9 patients each in order to fulfil the requirement for at least 3 patients that meet minimum BSA 
criteria. It was anticipated that up to 36 patients would be required in order to define the MTD or optimal 
Phase 2 dose of larotrectinib.  
Phase 1 Expansion: Following dose escalation, approximately 12-18 patients with specific abnormalities 
in the NTRK genes or proteins could be enrolled, based on clinical considerations for Phase 1 studies. 
Phase 2: Approximately 10 patients were to be enrolled in each of the designated cohorts. The number of 
patients planned for each Phase 2 cohort was determined largely by feasibility considerations owing to the 
extreme rarity of paediatric NTRK fusion cancers. Although the planned sample size was limited, it was 
anticipated that the ORR would be high (≥50%) for each cohort evaluated. If such response rates were 
observed, than the lower limit of the CI could be used to identify true response rates. For example, if 
among the 10 patients enrolled within a cohort, there are 5 (50%), 6 (60%), 7 (70%), or 8 (80%) 
patients with CR or PR, then the 80% CI about this response rate would be (27, 73), (35, 81), (45, 88), 
or (55, 95), respectively.  
Statistical methods 
Summary statistics were used to present safety data.  The methods of statistical analysis of ORR and DOR 
were similar to the corresponding analysis in the LOXO-TRK-14001 study.  CBR (clinical benefit rate) 
defined as the sum of patients with either a CR, PR or with stable disease, was analysed similarly.   
All analyses were made on observed data only, with no imputations for missing values. 
Analysis sets for this interim analysis are Safety Analysis Set and Full Analysis Set, which are identical and 
include all enrolled patients who receive 1 or more doses of larotrectinib.   
No interim analyses were pre-planned and accounted for in the analyses, but the study results are already 
reported twice.  
Results 
The first patient was enrolled 16 December 2015. 
Forty-three (43) patients were represented in the interim report of the data cut-off of 19 February 2018.  
All enrolled patients were treated with larotrectinib.  Both the Safety and Full Analysis Sets consist of all 
43 patients, of whom 28 (65%) were still on treatment at the time of the cut-off date.  Among the 15 
patients who had discontinued treatment, the most common reason across dose groups was disease 
progression (7 patients).

Fusion-Positive Tumours 
Methods 
Study LOXO-TRK-15002 (“study 15002) is an ongoing multicentre, multinational, open label Phase 2 
“basket” study in patients aged 12 years and older with recurrent advanced solid tumours with an NTRK1, 
NTRK2, or NTRK3 gene fusion, as documented by a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 
1988 (CLIA) or equivalently certified laboratory. 
The study included a screening period, a treatment period, a safety follow-up visit, and long-term 
follow-up (LTFU) assessments. Safety, survival, and subsequent anticancer therapies are tracked in the 
LTFU period.

Study Participants  
The following were the diagnosis and main inclusion criteria: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469135/2019  
Page 84/196 
 
 
 
 
1. Locally-advanced or metastatic malignancy with an NTRK1, NTRK2 or NTRK3 gene fusion, identified 
through molecular assays as routinely performed at CLIA or other similarly-certified laboratories. 
2. Patients must have received prior standard therapy appropriate for their tumour type and stage of 
disease, or in the opinion of the Investigator, would be unlikely to tolerate or derive clinically meaningful 
benefit from appropriate standard of care therapy. 
3. Patients must have had at least one measurable lesion as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumours, version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). Patients without RECIST v1.1 measurable disease (e.g., 
evaluable disease only) were eligible for enrolment to Cohort 8, regardless of tumour type. 
4. Patients in Cohort 7 (primary central nervous system [CNS] tumours) should have met the following 
criteria: 
a. Had received prior treatment including radiation and/or chemotherapy, with radiation completed > 12 
weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) of therapy, as recommended or appropriate for that CNS tumour 
type 
b. Had ≥ 1 site of bi-dimensionally measurable disease (confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] 
and evaluable by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Criteria [RANO] criteria), with the size of at 
least one of the measurable lesions ≥ 1 cm in each dimension and noted on more than one imaging slice 
c. Imaging study performed within 28 days before enrolment while on stable dose steroid medication for 
at least 5 days immediately before and during the imaging study. 
5. At least 12 years of age. 
6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of ≤ 3. For those entered into Cohort 7, Karnofsky 
Performance Status (KPS) of 50. 
Treatments 
Larotrectinib was administered to patients at 100 mg twice daily (BID) and cycles were in 28-day 
increments. 
Larotrectinib was provided as a hard gelatin capsule in 2 strengths: 25 mg and 100 mg. Both capsule 
strengths provided were opaque white in colour and were distinguishable by size (capsule sizes 2 and 0, 
respectively). 
Larotrectinib could also be provided as a solution for patients who could not swallow capsules. The 
solution was provided as a clear, yellow to reddish coloured solution in a concentration of 20 mg/mL. 
Objectives and endpoints 
The primary objective of the study was to determine the overall response rate (ORR) by independent 
radiology review (IRC). 
Secondary objectives included other efficacy parameters including progression-free survival (PFS), 
overall survival (OS) and clinical benefit rate (CBR), and to further assess the safety and tolerability of 
larotrectinib. 
Sample size 
Up to 18 patients per tumour-specific cohort and up to 100 patients in the Other Tumour NOS cohort were 
to be included, with an expected total sample size of approximately 226 patients. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469135/2019  
Page 85/196 
 
 
 
For the cancer-specific cohorts (cohorts 1-7), Simon’s two-stage design was used to determine whether 
larotrectinib had sufficient anticancer activity to warrant further development for that tumour type. 
Enrolment within a cohort was to be terminated early in the event larotrectinib was not sufficiently 
effective. The decision to terminate or continue enrolment within a cohort was made independently of the 
other cohorts.  
For each cohort, a true ORR of 10% or less was considered insufficient to warrant further study (null 
hypothesis), whereas a true ORR of 30% or more was considered sufficiently effective (alternative 
hypothesis). The number of patients evaluated in each stage and the minimum number of responders 
needed to continue to the next stage were determined based on the optimum version of the 
aforementioned design, with 80% power and 1-sided significance level of 10%. Based on the above 
design considerations, up to 7 patients were to be enrolled in each cohort (Stage 1). If no patients were 
determined to achieve a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) (confirmed or unconfirmed) 
within a cohort, then enrolment within that cohort was terminated. Otherwise, 11 additional patients were 
to be enrolled within the cohort (second stage). 
According to the original protocol, the study 15002 was not planned to be pooled with any other study and 
each cohort was going to be analysed separately. The sample size was planned according to Simon’s 
two-stage design which controls the type I error rate within a cohort, but no multiplicity adjustment for 
the 7 different cohorts is proposed. Furthermore, there is no type I error control when selected cohorts 
are pooled.  
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
This was a single arm open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis set 
The Full Analysis Set included all enrolled patients who received at least 1 dose of larotrectinib. The Full 
Analysis Set was used primarily for the analysis of tumour response and other efficacy-related analyses. 
Efficacy Analyses 
As originally designed, the primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) by independent radiology 
review. However, in the interim report in this application ORR by Investigator assessment is presented. 
No formal statistical tests were performed at the interim analysis of this study. All efficacy analyses were 
descriptive only and were performed based on the Full Analysis Set. 
The point estimates of the ORR were calculated based on the maximum likelihood estimator (i.e., crude 
proportion of patients with BOR of confirmed CR or PR) based on the Full Analysis Set. The point estimate 
of ORR was to be accompanied by a 1-sided 90% exact binomial confidence interval (CI) using the 
Clopper-Pearson method. Additionally, 1-sided 97.5% exact binomial CIs for the ORR have also been 
presented. 
Missing values were not imputed and only observed values were used in data analyses and presentations. 
The efficacy results have not been presented based on the Full analysis set as described above. Instead 
efficacy results have been presented for an “evaluable set”.

Recruitment 
The first patient was enrolled 13 October 2015. There were study sites in Denmark, France, Ireland, 
Portugal, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, United Kingdom (UK), and United States (US). 
Conduct of the study 
Changes to the study and planned analyses that affect the statistical planning and type I error control 
Several changes were made to the original protocol dated 23 June 2015. 
In the first amendment to the protocol, dated 13 August 2015, the size of cohort 8 was reduced from 100 
to 25. In version 5 of the protocol (dated 17 June 2016) the following was added: “Subjects who do not 
have any radiological disease assessments after the initiation of LOXO-101, irrespective of reason 
including death, will be replaced”. This was deleted again in version 7 of the protocol (dated 24 July 
2017), where also a 9th cohort was added for patients where lab certification were not confirmed. 
After interaction with national agencies in April 2016, the applicant decided to pool all cohorts except for 
the CNS tumours cohort for analysis in the MAA. This was not explicitly stated in a protocol amendment 
for the study. In 2017 the Applicant further changed the strategy for MAA to pooling of data across studies 
LOXO-TRK-14001, LOXO-TRK-15002 and LOXO-TRK-15003 to serve as the primary efficacy dataset for 
the MAA. No patients were replaced between version 5 and version 7 of the protocol.  
Other protocol changes 
In addition to the changes in overall study design described above, many changes to the study protocol 
were made during the ongoing study as new data emerged, including with regard to patient eligibility 
criteria, such as age (from adult to 12 years in version 5; to 8 years in version 6.3) and requirements with 
regard to organ function; addition of study objectives, e.g. quality of life (version 3, and 6.2, paediatric); 
additional criteria for prior anticancer treatment (version 5); the addition of a cohort 9 for patients where 
an established assay has detected an NTRK fusion, but laboratory CLIA-equivalent certification has not 
been confirmed at the time of patient consent (version 7.0), clarifying rules for the reporting of adverse 
events (version 7.0), change in allowed glucocorticoid doses (version 7.2), addition of optional tumour 
biopsies at progression (version 7.2), etc.

12 Patients from this study contributed to the pre-specified primary efficacy 
evaluation based on primary analysis set (PAS) population of the integrated efficacy 
data pool. An additional 9 patients contributed to the extended primary analysis set 
(ePAS) population of the integrated efficacy data pool. Compared to ePAS, the 
ePAS2 dataset includes an additional 6 patients from this study.  The study also 
contributes 5 patients to the SAS3 dataset. 
Data are given as reported in the interim clinical study report based on investigator 
assessment, as opposed to the pooled data reported in the clinical summary 
documents submitted, which are based on central assessment. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Three larotrectinib clinical studies represent the primary efficacy basis for larotrectinib. The first patients 
were enrolled 12 May 2014 (Study 14001), 13 October 2015 (Study 15002) and 16 December 2015 
(Study 15003). 
The studies are ongoing and this application is based on interim data that have been pooled from the 
three studies. The contribution from each study is shown in Table 39 and is further addressed under 
Numbers analysed below (p. 107). 
Results from three different data cut-off dates for the pooled analyses have been presented based on 
consequently different numbers of patients as shown in Table 38.  
Results for an additional patient population, which is encompassed by the indication, are also presented. 
The pooled primary analysis populations excluded patients from the pivotal studies who had primary CNS 
tumours. These patients, pooled from Studies 15002 and 15003, comprise the Supplemental analysis set 
3 (SAS3).

Objectives 
Multicentre, Phase 1, 
open-label, dose escalation 
(5 planned dose cohorts 
with 3 to 6 patients per 
cohort) and dose expansion 
study (2 planned cohorts) in 
adult patients with advanced 
solid tumours. Objectives 
are to characterize safety 
and dose-limiting toxicity, 
MTD / or appropriate dose of 
larotrectinib for further 
study, and to characterize its 
PK properties and 
antitumour activity (overall 
response rate and other 
efficacy parameters).  
Multicentre, Phase 2, 
open-label “basket” study in 
patients 12 years of age or 
older with an advanced 
cancer bearing an NTRK 
gene fusion.  The study 
includes 8 cohorts of 
patients with tumours 
bearing somatic NTRK gene 
fusions, including NSCLC, 
thyroid cancer, sarcoma, 
colorectal cancer, salivary 
gland cancer, biliary cancer, 
primary CNS tumours, and a 
cohort that enrols patients of 
all other histologic types or 
patients without measurable 
disease.  The primary 
objective is to determine the 
overall response rate and 
secondary objectives are to 
determine other efficacy 
parameters and to further 
assess the safety and 
tolerability of larotrectinib.  
Exploratory objectives 
include determination of the 
relationship between PK 
and drug effects, including 
efficacy and safety.

Methods 
Study Participants 
See eligibility criteria for inclusion for the individual studies in sections above.  
Studies 14001 and 15003 included patients with or without documented NTRK gene fusions while 
eligibility criteria for the Phase 2 study 15002 required all patients to have an NTRK gene fusion. Study 
14001 was performed in adults, Study 15003 in paediatric patients, and Study 15002 in adults and 
adolescents.  
Patients included in all studies were required to have a locally advanced or metastatic solid tumour (i.e. 
carcinoma or sarcoma). Primary CNS malignancy was specifically mentioned and allowed Studies 15002 
and 15003.  Patients must have received prior standard therapy or would be unlikely to tolerate or derive 
clinically meaningful benefit from appropriate standard of care therapy (Study 15002); or must have 
progressed on prior therapy or was nonresponsive to available therapies and for which no standard or 
available systemic curative therapy existed (Studies 14001 and 15003); or, for infantile fibrosarcoma, 
would require disfiguring surgery or limb amputation to achieve a complete surgical resection (Study 
15003). 
Thus, Study 15002 appears to have somewhat less restrictive inclusion criteria in terms of prior therapy 
compared to the phase 1/2-studies, since progression on prior therapy was not required. This could 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469135/2019  
Page 95/196 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
encompass 1st line treatment. Also the wording in the inclusion criteria for studies 14001 and 15003 “for 
which no standard or available systemic curative therapy exists” appears open for any line of treatment 
in patients with metastatic tumours, since these are generally not considered curative by any treatment 
modality. With regard to locally advanced tumours, it is often at least theoretically possible that the 
tumour might become resectable after effective systemic therapy and thus curable.  
Treatments 
Larotrectinib has been administered in two different forms: capsule or oral solution. 
The target dose for this application is Vitrakvi (larotrectinib) 100 mg BID (adults) or 100mg/m2 BID 
(paediatric patients, not to exceed adult dose), continuously in 28-day cycles, until disease progression or 
intolerable toxicity. However, as patients from dose-finding studies are included in the pooled efficacy 
analysis populations, not all patients received this dose, see Table 64. 
It is noted that in at least two of the studies (14001 and 15002) patients with progressive disease were 
allowed to continue larotrectinib if, in the opinion of the Investigator, the patient was deriving clinical 
benefit from continuing study drug and continuation of treatment was approved by the Sponsor.

Across the 3 studies, disease assessment was performed by computed tomography (CT), positron 
emission tomography (PET), and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed at screening, every 
other cycle on or around day 1 of odd-numbered cycles, and at the end-of-treatment.   
In all 3 studies, tumour response criteria were based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) version 1.1 for non-CNS solid tumours and Response Assessment in Neuro Oncology Criteria 
(RANO) for CNS tumours.   
In Study LOXO-TRK-15002, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of 
Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), European Quality of Life 5-Dimensions 5-Levels Health 
Questionnaire (EQ5D5L) or Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) were used as appropriate for the 
patient’s age, and in Study LOXO-TRK-15003, the PedsQL Infant Scale was used for infants 1–24 months 
of age and the PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scale for patients 25 months of age and greater.  Quality of life 
data were not included in the interim analysis with a data cut-off date of 19 FEB 2018. 
It was agreed with the regulatory agencies that interim CSRs for the individual studies would utilize 
Investigator response assessments until preparation of the final CSRs, but for the SCE an integrated 
analysis pooling data from all 3 studies would be based on Independent Review Committee (IRC) 
assessments, although the Investigator assessed endpoints would also be presented.

Pooled analyses 
• 
The primary endpoint for the pooled efficacy analyses was ORR by IRC assessment, defined as the 
proportion of patients with best overall response of confirmed complete response (CR) or 
confirmed partial response (PR). 
Best overall response was defined as the best response designation as of the data cut-off date for each 
patient recorded between the date of the first dose of larotrectinib and the date of documented disease 
progression per RECIST v1.1, the date of subsequent therapy or cancer related surgery, or the data 
cut-off date, whichever occurred first. Patients who underwent surgical resection on therapy with no 
viable tumour cells and negative margins on postsurgical pathology report were considered a CR by 
surgery/pathology. 
The primary analysis was based on the time point responses and the best overall responses in the PAS 
recorded by the IRC. In addition, best overall responses were evaluated in the SAS1-IRC and ePAS. 
Change in tumour burden was calculated for each patient in ePAS as the percentage change from baseline 
in the sum of diameters of target tumour lesions at each time point. The best tumour burden change was 
summarized descriptively by calculating the median and interquartile range across patients. A waterfall 
plot was used to graphically depict tumour burden changes.   
Secondary endpoints the pooled analyses: 
•  ORR based on Investigator assessment for patients with non-CNS primary tumours using RECIST 
v1.1 criteria (confirmation of response was required) 
• 
Time to response and time to best response  
•  Duration of response  
•

• 
Progression-free survival (PFS) and PFS rate at 6 and 12 months after initiation of larotrectinib 
•  Overall survival (OS) and survival rate at 12 months after initiation of larotrectinib. 
The IRC assessments served as the principal data source for time to response, time to best response, 
duration of response, disease control rate, and PFS for the PAS, SAS1-IRC, and ePAS. 
Following CHMP request, data from an extended follow-up and a consequently larger pooled analysis 
population, ePAS2, has been submitted.  
Sample size 
Under the primary efficacy analysis described in the SAP, a ORR of ≥50% was hypothesized when 
larotrectinib was administered to patients with TRK fusion cancer.  A sample size of 55 patients was 
estimated to provide 80% power to achieve a lower boundary of the 2-sided 95% exact binomial 
confidence interval (CI) about the estimated ORR exceeding 30%. 
Ruling out a lower limit of 30% for ORR was considered clinically meaningful and consistent with the 
estimated response rates seen with approved targeted therapies in genetically-defined patient 
populations who have progressed on prior therapies.  Under the primary analysis, the lower limit of the 
95% CI would exceed 30% when the estimated ORR was 46% or greater (Clopper-Pearson method). 
The SAP for the pooled analysis was dated 15 August 2017. The applicant was asked to clarify how many 
patients were already included in the studies at that time and for how many of those patients response 
status had already been evaluated. The Applicant responded that as of 15 AUG 2017, 81 patients had 
been enrolled into the studies of which 52 patients had response assessed by investigators.

Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
All trials in the pooled analysis were open-label and non-randomised. 
Statistical methods 
Primary Analysis Set 
The Primary Analysis Set (PAS) includes the first 55 patients (paediatrics and adults) enrolled across 
clinical studies LOXO-TRK-14001, -15002, and -15003 who meet the following criteria: 
1.  Documented NTRK fusion as determined by local testing 
2.  Non-CNS primary tumour with 1 or more measurable lesions at baseline as assessed by 
RECIST 1.1 
3.  Received 1 or more doses of larotrectinib 
All patients meeting the criteria listed above were ordered chronologically (from earliest to latest) based 
on the date larotrectinib was first administered. The first 55 patients from this list are included in the PAS. 
Missing Data 
For data summarized over time by visit, no imputations were performed on missing data. All analyses will 
be based on observed data only. The effective sample sizes at each assessment visit will be based on the 
total number of patients with non-missing data for the parameter of interest at that visit. 
Primary Analysis 
The data cut-off for the primary analysis was 17 July 2017, approximately 6 months after enrolment of 
the 55th patient in the PAS. This data cut-off was determined so that the majority of patients in the PAS 
would have at least 6 months of follow-up after the initiation of larotrectinib. The data cut-off was applied 
uniformly across studies and all analyses. 
The point estimate of the ORR was calculated based on the maximum likelihood estimator (i.e., crude 
proportion of patients in the PAS with best overall response of confirmed CR or confirmed PR). The point 
estimate was accompanied by a 2-sided 95% exact binomial CI using the Clopper-Pearson method. The 
effectiveness of larotrectinib was demonstrated if the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI exceeded 30%. 
Secondary calculations were provided for ORR based on the subset of patients in the PAS with 
IRC-confirmed measurable disease. Heterogeneity of the estimated ORR by study was evaluated based 
on the quantity I2, which describes the percentage of total variation across studies that is due to 
heterogeneity rather than chance (Higgins 2003). Values of I2 lie between 0% and 100%. A value of 0% 
indicates no observed heterogeneity; larger values of I2 show increasing heterogeneity.  
Notably, the exclusion of CNS-tumours introduces a bias in the estimate. The restriction to the first 55 
patients is arbitrarily chosen. Analysing observed data only is not in accordance with the ITT principle. An 
analysis of ORR using the Full Analysis Set in the denominator were presented as response to questions, 
and showed somewhat lower estimates of ORR. The result of the heterogeneity evaluation between 
studies has been provided in the responses showing substantial heterogeneity across studies. Also, 
considering that the primary endpoint is a crude proportion of responses, a sensitivity analysis utilizing 
tumour type as a random factor were performed on the pooled data and were provided with the response 
to questions. This analysis gives slightly lower estimates than the crude rates presented previously. 
The analysis presented by the applicant was based on a post hoc pooling of cohorts and of studies and 
exclusion of one cohort. It is noted that the initial decision to transition to the pivotal pooled design, 10 
patients had been sufficiently studied for efficacy. Thus, 45 patients had been recruited prospectively as 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469135/2019  
Page 98/196 
 
 
 
part of the initial primary analysis population, PAS (n= 55). The three studies include 5, 8 and 7 cohorts 
(cancer types) respectively and this gives a large number of possible selections of subsets of one or more 
cohorts to pool, whereof only one was presented in primary analysis (i.e. the pooled analysis without 
CNS). In order to illustrate the uncertainties and bias introduced by the applicant’s approach, the 
applicant was asked to present the distribution of ORR estimates resulting from all possible selections of 
subsets of one or more cohorts. The resulting analysis is presented below (Figure 22, Table 41). 
The requested analyses on possible selections of subsets has been performed using the 30 JUL 2018 
cut-off database. The analyses used the data from 102 patients: in the ePAS2 (N=93) and the SAS3 
(N=9). The analysis uses IRC assessed response data for the patients in the ePAS2 and investigator 
assessed response data for patients in SAS3. Overall, 19 cohorts were considered in the analysis. Of 
these, 5 cohorts were included from Study LOXO-TRK-14001, 8 from Study LOXO-TRK-15002, and 6 from 
Study LOXO-TRK-15003. The Overall Response Rate (ORR) was calculated for all possible selections of 
subsets of one or more cohorts (number of possible selections: 2^19 - 1 = 524 287). 
Figure 23: Histogram for all combinations of the 19 cohorts for ORR (ePAS2 + SAS3) 
Table 41: Descriptive statistics of all combinations of the 19 cohorts for ORR (ePAS2 + SAS3) 
All possible selections of cohorts from the three studies have been analysed. The estimated ORR in the 
ePAS population is in the upper end (the 90th percentile) of the distribution of possible estimates 
indicating a possible selection bias. On the other hand, a large majority of all possible ORR estimates are 
above 50% indicating a true effect of a relevant magnitude.

According to the inclusion criteria, Study 15002 required age of 12 or above; however, country-specific 
protocol amendments were sometimes made to allow inclusion of younger patients. Amendments have 
thus been made to include specific, selected patients. This represents an additional source of selection 
bias that introduces uncertainty to the overall efficacy estimates.

In the ePAS2, patients with 14 tumour histologies were included. Median time from diagnosis was 2.1 
years for the ePAS2 and most patients had metastatic disease at enrolment (83%). Most patients had 
NTRK3 fusions or NTRK1 fusions (53% and 44%, respectively) and a baseline ECOG score of 0 or 1 (45 
and 44%, respectively). In the primary brain tumour population, NTRK2 fusions were dominating (78%) 
and performance status was higher.  
NTRK fusion detection method 
Molecular pathology reports were provided for 105 enrolled on larotrectinib studies 14001, 15002 and 
15003 who fulfilled the criteria for pooling into the ePAS2 (see below). The 105 molecular pathology 
reports documented the results of 33 unique tests performed at 31 different labs. 
Most of the tests performed were NGS-based (N = 98), while the minority were FISH-based (N = 6) and

Table 47: Prior Cancer Therapy in the ePAS2 and primary brain tumours (SAS3) 
Visit ut-off 30-JUL-2018 
In the ePAS2, 97% of patients had received prior surgery for their cancer, 48% had received prior 
radiotherapy, and 77% had received prior systemic therapy. The corresponding proportions for the 
primary brain tumour population were 100%, 56% and 100%.  Larotrectinib was the initial systemic 
therapy for 23% of patients where no standard of care systemic treatment existed in the ePAS2. The 
median number of prior systemic regimens was 1.0, ranging from 0 to 10.  
Numbers analysed 
Analysis Sets for Pooled Analyses 
Primary Analysis Set (PAS) 
The PAS was pre-defined and based on NTRK gene fusion status, chronology of enrolment, and primary 
tumour histology. It included the first 55 patients – both paediatric and adult – enrolled in Study 14001, 
15002, or 15003, who met the following criteria:  
•  Documented NTRK gene fusion as determined by local testing (see exception below) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469135/2019  
Page 107/196 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Non-CNS primary tumour (see rationale below) 
•  1 or more measurable lesions at baseline as assessed by RECIST v1.1  
•  Received 1 or more doses of larotrectinib 
The PAS was initially evaluated at the 17 JUL 2017 cut-off date.  After this date, no patient could qualify 
for the PAS itself. Results from two subsequent data cut-offs with extended primary analysis sets have 
been presented during the evaluation, 19 February 2018 and 30 July 2018. The assessment in this report 
is focused on the latter.  
Supplemental analysis sets (SASs) 
In addition to the initial 55 patients that comprised the PAS, additional patients have been treated and 
evaluated with larotrectinib and are summarized in the following supplemental analysis sets (SASs): 
•  SAS1 included paediatric and adult patients who met all PAS eligibility criteria but were enrolled 
after the 55th PAS-evaluable patient but before the subsequent data cut-offs. SAS1 utilized 
disease assessments performed by the Investigator as opposed to central assessment. 
o  For a subset of patients in SAS1 who were enrolled before the subsequent data cut-offs, 
sufficient follow-up was available to permit IRC assessment of tumour responses (chance 
of at least 6 months of follow-up prior to the data cut-off) and these data have also been 
presented, this subset is referred to as SAS1-IRC.  
o  The remaining patients in SAS1 did not have sufficient duration of follow-up for IRC 
assessment (SAS1-no IRC). 
•  SAS2 included paediatric and adult patients who otherwise met PAS eligibility criteria with the 
exception of having a measurable lesion and were enrolled before the subsequent data cut-offs. 
SAS2 utilized disease assessments performed by the Investigator as opposed to central 
assessment. As of 30 JUL 2018, the SAS3 dataset included 7 patients with non-measurable 
tumours. 
•  SAS3 included paediatric and adult patients with primary CNS tumours but who otherwise met 
PAS eligibility criteria and were enrolled before the data cut-off. SAS3 utilized disease 
assessments performed by the Investigator as opposed to central assessment. As of 30 JUL 2018, 
the SAS3 dataset included 9 patients with primary CNS tumours. 
Extended Primary Analysis Sets (ePAS and ePAS2) 
The  ePAS  (n=73)  included  all  patients  who  met  all PAS  eligibility  criteria  as  of  19  FEB  2018  and  had 
central  review  of  tumour  response  by  the  IRC.    This  included  an  additional  18  patients  (SAS1-IRC) 
compared to the PAS (n=55).  
The  Extended  primary  analysis  set  2  (ePAS2,  n=93)  included  all  patients  who  met  all  PAS  eligibility 
criteria and had either discontinued the study or had at least 6 months follow-up by 30 JUL 2018 (thereby 
ensuring  at  least  one  central  review  of  tumour  response  by  the  IRC).    This  included  an  additional  38 
patients (SAS1-IRC) compared to the PAS (n=55). See Figure 23 below. 
One patient was inadvertently excluded from the ePAS2 analysis set: one patient in study 15003 was a 
surgical complete responder.  This patient discontinued the trial after his surgery on 18 JUL 2018.  This 
patient therefore had a response assessment before 30 JUL 2018 but was excluded from ePAS2.  This 
patient will be included in the ePAS3 analysis set.

NTRK testing 
Eligibility criteria for Phase 2 Study LOXO-TRK-15002 required all patients to have an NTRK gene fusion. 
Enrolment in Studies LOXO-TRK-14001 and LOXO-TRK-15003 was not restricted to patients with 
documented NTRK gene fusion. Infantile fibrosarcoma (IFS) patients (Study LOXO-TRK-15003) were 
considered NTRK gene fusion-positive irrespective of available NTRK gene testing based on the known 
incidence of the alteration in this patient population (Rubin et al. 1998; Bourgeois et al. 2000), though 
most had been tested prior to study enrolment with NGS, RT-PCR or ETV6 FISH analysis.  
At prolonged follow-up, all patients in the primary efficacy population ePAS2 and primary brain tumour 
population (SAS3) did have NTRK fusion detected. In 4 IFS patients the positive NTRK fusion status was 
inferred from the detection of the fusion partner ETV6, however.  
Exclusion of CNS tumours from pooled data sets 
CNS tumours were excluded from the PAS because prior studies of larotrectinib in rats have indicated low 
penetration into CNS tissues as shown by a microdialysis study in which the unbound levels in the stratum 
were approximately 4% of the unbound plasma levels (LOXO-101-DMPK-035). However, CNS 
penetration in cancer patients taking larotrectinib may be more substantial as evidenced by 2 patients 
with cerebrospinal fluid samples obtained from an Ommaya reservoir and a lumbar puncture having 28% 
and 123% of time-matched peripheral (plasma) concentrations, respectively (LOXO-TRK-15003). The 
absolute concentration of larotrectinib in these two samples was 34.2 and 76.2 ng/mL (80 and 178 nM), 
respectively, which are approaching and exceeding the inhibitory concentration for 90% tumour inhibition 
(IC90) threshold for inhibition of TRK by larotrectinib. Therefore, CNS tumours constituted a standalone 
cohort in the Phase 2 basket study, and early stopping rules limited enrolment. This separate cohort with 
primary CNS tumours (cohort 7) was considered to have a lowered likelihood of response compared to the 
other cohorts and as such was a pre-specified exclusion from the original 55 patients to constitute the 
PAS.

In view of the post-hoc pooling of results, it is considered of outmost importance to ensure that patients 
selected for pooling were not “picked” based on results. The Applicant was therefore requested to present 
a summary of all individual patients that were excluded due to lack of IRC data (i.e., SAS1C population 
above). Among the 28 patients in SAS1C, 27 had treatment ongoing, range for duration of therapy was 
0-4.7 months. One patient had discontinued treatment due to surgery after 4.3 months of larotrectinib 
treatment. This is a reassuring overall pattern as it does not indicate that patients with poorer outcomes 
were selectively excluded from the pooled analyses.

PFS at 6 and 12 months in the ePAS2 (n=93) at the current data cut-off (30 Jul 2018) was 77% and 64%, 
respectively. This is consistent with that observed in the ePAS (n=73) at the previous data cut-off (19 Feb 
2018), 77% and 63%, respectively. 
PFS and OS are important for contextualisation of the ORR and DoR results and in relation to approved 
anticancer products normally approved based on PFS and/or OS. However, due to the pooling of many 
different types of primary malignancies with inherently different prognosis, the data should be interpreted 
with caution.

OS is defined as the number of months elapsed between the date of the first dose of larotrectinib and the date of death 
(whatever the cause). Patients who were alive or lost to follow-up as of the data cut-off date were right-censored. The 
censoring date was determined from the date the patient was last known to be alive. Vertical tick marks represent the 
OS times for 63 patients who were alive as of the last contact.

The OS data in the ePAS2 are immature at an overall event rate of 15% (14/93 dead). Beyond 
approximately 28 months, less than 10 patients remain in the K-M plot. At this point, OS survival portion 
appears to be around 80%.  
In the CNS group, all 9 patients are still alive.  
Quality of life (exploratory) 
In the 3rd round of assessment, the Applicant submitted patient-reported outcome (PRO) data on 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL), dated 22 April 2019. These are pooled data from studies 15002 
(Phase 2 basket) and 15003 (Paediatric Phase 1/2). HRQoL was an exploratory objective in 15002, added 
during the study in a protocol amendment. In Study 15003, HRQoL was a secondary objective in the 
Phase 1 part (n=24). The pooled data were presented as exploratory. 
In the ePAS2 population studies 15002 and 15003 contribute with 58 and 27 patients, respectively. From 
15002, 48 of these 58 patients had a baseline PRO measurement and 40 had both baseline and at least 
one post-baseline measurement. From study 15003, 26 of the 27 ePAS2 patients had a baseline 
measurement and 26 had both baseline and a post-baseline measurement.

The interpretation of PROs from single-arm open-label studies is generally difficult, due to the 
non-blinded study design’s effect on the patients’ experience and the lack of comparator. In the present 
case, also lack of formal hypothesis testing and the missing data preclude the acceptance of any HRQoL 
claims in the SmPC. (It is noted that the Applicant considers that most of the patients without 
measurements in Study 15002 were missing due to administrative reasons.) 
The instruments used were EORTC QLQ-C30, EQ-5D-5L, PedsQL (in several age-appropriate versions), 
and Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale (FACES). 
For EORTC QLQ-C30, Global health status minimally important difference (MID) was defined as: a change 
in score of 10 points or more (Cocks et al., 2012; Osoba et al., 1998). 
For EQ-5D-5L, only visual analogue scale (VAS) results were presented. VAS MID was defined as: a 
change in score of 10 points or more (Pickard et al., 2007) 
For PedsQL, total score MID was defined as: a change in score of 4.5 points or more (Varni et al., 2007).

On average, postbaseline numerical increases in the Global health scores was observed for cycles 3 
through 13, but it was not greater than the MID at any cycle. Postbaseline average improvement occurred 
in Role for cycles 3 through 13, Social for cycles 3 through 16, and Emotional for cycles 3 through 11; but

these are variables likely to be positively affected by the open-label study design. It is notable that 
Physical functioning shows considerably smaller average improvements. (Figure 31)

It was noted in Figure 3 (not shown) in the submitted HRQoL report that only 3 patients with progressive 
disease were included in the analyses of best change from baseline, possibly representing an imbalance 
of included patients in relation to outcome, since in the ePAS2, 8 patients had PD. (At least per 19 Feb 
2018 cut-off for which individual study data have been presented, there were no PDs in study 14001, i.e. 
the study not included in the HRQoL analyses.) 
Among the 3 patients with PD, one had no change, one had a decrease and one had >MID decrease.  
It is noted that the 4 patients with lower baseline performance status (ECOG 2) all had improvements in 
QLQ-C3 Global health scores over the minimal important difference (MID) threshold of 10 points 
difference.  
The EQ-5D-5L patterns of best absolute change from baseline closely mimicked those of QLQ-C3 Global 
health scores shown in Figure 32. (HRQoL report, Figure 11, not shown) 
Paediatric 
Different instruments were used in different age groups. The 12 patients in the age group < 2 years were 
not interpretable due to missing data. The were 17 patients ≥2 years, 2 from 15003 and 15 from 15003.

Based on the data presented, at the recommended starting doses for marketing authorization, the 
response rate was 74% for the paediatric population (100 mg/m2 BID) and 68% for the adult population 
(100 mg BID). The exposures were similar in responders and non-responders, in adults and in patients 
<18 years of age (data not shown in this AR.)

Observed molecular changes in relation to response 
Out of 93 patients in ePAS2, 85 had additional molecular characterisation, based on Next generation 
sequencing. In the following table, the identified genetic alterations observed in these 85 patients are 
summarised and categorised in relation to OncoKb Levels of Evidence (Table 69).  
It should be noted that only the genetic changes of the highest OncoKb level of evidence for each tumour 
are presented in the table. Most tumours with an additional oncogenic alteration had multiple other 
changes of lower levels, in addition to those presented in the table.  
OncoKb Levels of Evidence:  
1) FDA-recognised biomarker predictive of response to an FDA-approved drug in this indication. 
2) Standard care biomarker predictive of response to an FDA-approved drug in: A) this indication B) 
another indication, but not standard in this indication.  
3) Compelling clinical evidence supports the biomarker as being predictive of response to a drug A) in 
this indication B) another indication, A+B) but neither biomarker or drug are standard of care. 
4) Compelling biological evidence supports the biomarker as being predictive of response to a drug, 
but neither biomarker or drug are standard of care.  
R1) Standard care biomarker predictive of resistance to an FDA-approved drug in this indication.  
R2) Compelling clinical evidence supports the biomarker as being predictive of resistance to a drug, 
but neither biomarker or drug are standard of care.  
R3) Compelling biological evidence supports the biomarker as being predictive of resistance to a drug, 
but neither biomarker or drug are standard of care.

Among the 85 patients with wider molecular characterisation 48 (56%) had additional oncogenic 
alterations, while 37 (44%) had no other oncogenic alteration detected. Three (3.5%) were not evaluable 
for tumour response. In relation to response outcomes, it is noted in Table 69 that among 59 patients with 
objective response (CR or PR), 31 (53%) had no additional oncogenic alteration, while 28 (47%) did have 
an additional oncogenic alteration, i.e. similar to the overall proportion. The proportions of patients with 
additional oncogenic alterations were higher, however, in 14 patients with SD (10 patients, 71%) and 9 
patients PD (8 patients, 89%) as best response.  
Correspondingly, a difference is noted in the overall response rate between patients with oncogenic 
alterations (28 CR/PR out of 48 patients: ORR= 58%) and patients without (31 CR/PR out of 37 patients: 
ORR= 84%). However, the response rate is considered high for both groups of patients. No association 
could be identified with either a specific oncogenic driver or tumour type and the clinical response seen in 
patients. Specifically, among the 9 patients with PD as best response, no trend of a particular other 
oncogenic driver could be seen. 
No patient had a concomitant genetic alteration for which another targeted drug is approved for the 
concerned tumour type in the EU (MSI high noted in the table is approved in the US, but not EU). MSI high 
was found in one patient with PR and one with SD, respectively. There was one patient with papillary 
thyroid cancer with a BRAFV600E mutation that was treated with larotrectinib. While BRAF-targeted 
therapies exist, there is currently no BRAF inhibitor approved for the treatment of papillary thyroid 
cancer. 
It is furthermore noted in source tables (not shown) that among, for example, 20 patients who had 
additional molecular characterisation and achieved either CR (PFS range 11 to >33 months) or PR with 
PFS >24 months, known oncogenic alterations were present in 11 patients, involving FGFR1, PIK3CA and 
FLT3 (OncoKb level 3), CDKN2A/B (OncoKb level 4), and MAP2K4, MAP3K6, TP53, TERT, KDM5C, and 
NF1. Such alterations do thus not seem to preclude relevant clinical benefit from larotrectinib treatment.   
Acquired resistance 
Secondary (acquired) resistance mechanisms to larotrectinib treatment were investigated.  
Acquired resistance mutations after progression on TRK inhibitors have been observed. Larotrectinib had 
minimal activity in cell lines with point mutations in the TRKA kinase domain, including the clinically 
identified acquired resistance mutation, G595R. Point mutations in the TRKC kinase domain with clinically 
identified acquired resistance to larotrectinib include G623R, G696A, and F617L. 
Out of 55 patients in the PAS population, 17 had PD after an initial response; from 10 of these the Sponsor 
obtained post-progression biopsies. In 8/10 patients NTRK resistance mutations were detected and in the 
remaining 2 patients, BRAFV600E mutations were identified. However, based on additional information, 
one of these patients also had a NTRK resistance mutation, and the other had very low levels of the 
BRAFV600E mutation (<1% allelic fraction) in circulating tumour DNA, hampering the interpretation of 
the role of the BRAF mutation.  
Clinical trials are ongoing with second-generation TRK inhibitors (such as LOXO-195) that have been 
shown to be able to overcome the acquired NTRK mutations.  
Secondary NTRK mutations altering the kinase domain of TRK appear to be a major acquired resistance 
mechanism to larotrectinib. Information on the NTRK mutations causing resistance is presented in the 
SmPC. Such mutations are detected by commonly used NGS techniques. Furthermore, the Applicant has 
committed to continue the investigation of resistance mechanisms in post-progression biopsies as part of 
the required post-authorisation studies.

Response rate by detection method  
Out of 105 patients fulfilling the pooling criteria, 98 had their positive NTRK fusion status identified by 
Next generation sequencing (NGS), considered by the Applicant to be the detection method of choice. 
One patient had a PCR-based NTRK fusion status (IFS). This patient had an objective response. 
Six patients had their positive NTRK fusion status identified by FISH. 
In 2 patients, a dual gene FISH assay was used that detected ETV6 and NTRK3, while the detection of an 
in frame NTRK fusion is only indirect. These 2 patients, with MASC and salivary gland carcinoma, 
respectively, both achieved complete remission.  
In 4 patients a break-apart FISH assay was used in which the probes detected a gene disruption of ETV6 
and the presence of an NTRK fusion was thus indirectly inferred. These patients were diagnosed with 
infantile fibrosarcoma (IFS), an indication which is defined by a high prevalence of ETV6-NTRK3 fusions

(Sheng et al. 2001). The ORR for these patients was 100% (3 PR, 1 surgical CR), which confirms that the 
gene fusion very likely was expressed in these cases. 
It should be noted that ETV6 has been shown to fuse with non-NRTK genes in malignant cells (Ito Y et al., 
Am J Surg Pathol, 2015). Furthermore, recent data show an increased spectrum of gene fusions 
associated with infantile fibrosarcoma and congenital mesoblastic nephroma that do not involve ETV6 
(Church AJ et al., Mol Pathol, 2018).

Two of the three trials forming the basis for this application included paediatric patients. Study 15003 
performed in the paediatric population, and included patients in ages 0.1-19.9 years (range for both the 
NTRK fusion-positive subgroup and the total study population). Furthermore, Study 15002 included 
patients aged 12 and older, although one patient aged 6 years appears to have been included (Table 42).

Supportive study(ies) 
Supportive data of relevance to the histology-independent indication is summarised below. 
29 patients had been treated in single patient protocols in the US or under compassionate use outside the 
US. Formal data collection was not mandated. Examples of partial responses in patients with breast 
cancer (including one triple-negative) and recurrent glioblastoma multiforme, as well as complete 
responses in patients with IFS (surgical CRs) and STS were reported, however.  
Addressing the histology-independent indication, the Applicant has reported preliminary, 
investigator-assessed, outcomes of two patients, with non-secretory breast cancer and on the first 
patient with prostate cancer, who entered the pooled study population after the data cut-off for the 
ePAS2. Both have larotrectinib treatment ongoing.  
The patient with non-secretory breast cancer had metastatic disease in liver, adrenal gland, lymph nodes 
and brain. The investigator reported a partial response after cycle 2 with a tumour reduction of 48%; PR 
was confirmed at the subsequent cycle 4 assessment, followed by an unconfirmed complete response on 
cycle 8.  
The patient with prostate cancer had metastatic disease in bone and lymph nodes. The investigator 
reported stable disease at the first tumour assessment after cycle 2, and an unconfirmed partial response 
at cycle 4 with tumour reduction of 34%. 
Updated investigator-based data on intracranial activity of larotrectinib, reported at ASCO 2019, was also 
submitted.  
Based on the 30 July 2018 ePAS2 data cut-off, 6 patients were identified with non-primary CNS tumours 
with brain metastases. They had thyroid cancer (1 papillary, 1 follicular) and NSCLC, and a median age of 
65 years (range 25-76). 5/6 had prior systemic therapy and 2 patients had prior radiotherapy to the brain 
> 1 year before larotrectinib, and 1 of these also had CNS surgery > 1 year prior. One patient had not yet 
had a tumour assessment. Among 5 evaluable patients 3 had PR (2 thyroid, 1 lung) and 2 had SD (lung); 
overall ORR was 60% (95% CI: 15-95). Partial responses occurred at cycle 2 (1 lung), and cycle 4 (2 
thyroid).  
Based on a new data cut-off, 19 February 2019, 18 patients with primary CNS tumours were identified in 
the 3 pivotal studies (n=109). Histologies included 6 glioblastoma, 4 glioma, 3 glioneuronal, 3 not 
otherwise specified, and 2 astrocytoma. Median age was 10 years (range 1-79); 14 patients were 
paediatric and 4 adults. 15 (83%) had prior systemic therapy, 13 (72%) had prior local surgery or 
radiotherapy. Among 14 evaluable patients, 2 CR, 3 PR, and 9 SD were noted per 
investigator-assessment. ORR was 36% (95% CI: 13-65). 4 of the responses occurred before/at cycle 2, 
the remaining 1 PR at the cycle 4 assessment. All responses were seen in paediatric patients (11 
evaluable). 
2.5.2.1.  Comparison with available therapies  
Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 provides that Conditional marketing authorisations (CMA) 
are granted to meet ‘unmet medical needs’ of patients. ‘Unmet medical needs’ means a condition for 
which there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment authorised in the Union 
or, even if such a method exists, in relation to which the medicinal product concerned will be of major 
therapeutic advantage to those affected. 
To justify that a major therapeutic advantage of Vitrakvi (larotrectinib) over available treatment options, 
the following comparison with available literature data was provided. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469135/2019  
Page 139/196 
 
 
 
 
Note that the higher ORRs compared with conventional chemotherapies that are generally observed for 
targeted agents such as ALK, EGFR and BRAF inhibitors (for which patients are selected based on the 
presence of the target molecule in the tumour) are not relevant for a larotrectinib comparison unless 
patients would have both drivers, which apparently is very unlikely/rare. Therefore, comparison should 
only be made against the molecularly unselected therapies. In comparison with these, and considering 
that larotrectinib is given in a later line where lower efficacy is generally expected, the larotrectinib ORR 
and PFS range seem overall favourable or at least comparable, although the data are far from 
comprehensive.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The efficacy assessment is based on the pooled interim data from three currently ongoing trials; a 
dose-finding phase 1/2 study in adults with or without NTRK gene fusions (LOXO-TRK-14001), a phase 2 
basket trial in adolescent and adult patients with NTRK fusions (LOXO-TRK-15002), and a dose-finding 
phase 1/2 study in paediatric patients with NTRK fusions (LOXO-TRK-15003). All studies are open-label 
without parallel comparator. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study LOXO-TRK-14001 was initiated in 2014. By the time Study LOXO-TRK-15002 and 
LOXO-TRK-15003 started in the 3rd quarter of 2015, there were several substantial changes made to the 
design of Study LOXO-TRK-14001, including changes in inclusion and exclusion criteria, number of 
patients, dose regimen, schedule of events, concurrent medication, etc.  
Study LOXO-TRK-15002 was originally planned as a phase II open label basket study of the oral TRK 
inhibitor LOXO-101 in subjects with NTRK fusion-positive tumours. The study included 8 cohorts of 
patients with tumours bearing NTRK fusions, including non-small cell lung cancer, thyroid cancer, 
sarcoma, colorectal cancer, salivary gland cancer, biliary cancer, and primary CNS tumour, as well as a 
cohort that enrolled patients not included in the histologies listed above. The sample size for each cohort 
was planned using Simon’s two-stage design (with 7 patients in the first stage and 11 patients in the 
second stage). Each cohort was to be continued or discontinued independently of the others. No pooling 
within or between studies were planned in the original protocol. Several changes were subsequently made 
to this plan.  
After interaction with national agencies in April 2016, the applicant decided to pool all cohorts except for 
the CNS tumours cohort for analysis in the MAA. This was not explicitly stated in a protocol amendment 
for the study. In 2017 the Applicant further changed the strategy for MAA to pooling of data across studies 
LOXO-TRK-14001, LOXO-TRK-15002 and LOXO-TRK-15003 to serve as the primary efficacy dataset for 
the MAA. This issue has partly been addressed on request by analysing all possible selections of cohorts 
from the three studies. The estimated ORR in the ePAS population is in the upper end (the 90th percentile) 
of the distribution of possible estimates indicating a possible selection bias. On the other hand, as the 
applicant points out, a large majority of all possible ORR estimates are above 50% indicating an effect of 
substantial magnitude. 
The small sample sizes in the LOXO-TRK-14001 and LOXO-TRK-15003 studies were in line with the 
exploratory nature of the studies, and rarity of the paediatric NTRK fusion cancers (LOXO-TRK-15003). 
The sample size of the pooled analysis is also small; the largest cohorts include 17, 13 and 10 subjects, 
respectively, and in several cohorts the sample size is smaller than the first stage of the Simon’s 2-stage 
design in LOXO-TRK-15002.  However this was justified on the basis of the pooled analysis. With the 
resulting small samples in most of the cohorts it is difficult to draw conclusions on homogeneity of possible 
effects between tumour types.  
The major efficacy outcome measures were overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR), 
as determined by a blinded independent review committee (BIRC). Tumour responses were assessed by 
the investigator using RANO or RECIST v1.1 criteria. The point estimates of the ORR were calculated 
based on the maximum likelihood estimator (i.e., crude proportion of patients with best overall response 
of confirmed CR or PR) based on the Full Analysis Set. The presentation of the efficacy results is in many 
cases misleading as the table titles and headings say Full Analysis Set, while the rates are calculated 
based on non-missing or “evaluable” data. An alternative presentation of ORR was presented on the 
Agency’s request, with the denominator for the response rates based on the analysis sets deemed to be 
as close to the ITT as possible, resulting in ORR estimates that are above 50%. Also, additional 
Assessment report

information was requested overall and by cohort for individual studies and pooled analysis for the ePAS 
population not excluding the CNS cohort, and for all available up-to-date data. This provided an explicit 
numerator and denominator for the number of responders (CR+PR) and the denominator as number with 
TRK. Although there were in total 137 patients with documented TRK fusions (as determined by local 
testing, including patients with primary CNS tumours, who received at least 1 dose of larotrectinib, and 
were recruited until 30 July 2018), there were 28 patients who have had insufficient follow-up time at the 
date of cut-off and were not included in this analysis. The ORR estimates by cohort were generally in line 
with the corresponding results in the ePAS analysis, showing no or limited evidence of efficacy of the 
VITRAKVI treatment in several tumour types. 
The Applicant was requested to present a summary of all individual patients that were excluded due to 
lack of IRC data. Among the 28 patients excluded for this reason, 27 had treatment ongoing; range for 
duration of therapy was 0-4.7 months. One patient had discontinued treatment due to surgery after 4.3 
months of larotrectinib treatment. This is a reassuring overall pattern as it does not indicate that patients 
with poorer outcomes were selectively excluded from the pooled analyses.  
Patients included in all studies were required to have a locally advanced or metastatic solid tumour (i.e. 
carcinoma or sarcoma). Primary CNS malignancy was specifically mentioned and allowed in Studies 
15002 and 15003.  Patients must have received prior standard therapy or would be unlikely to tolerate or 
derive clinically meaningful benefit from appropriate standard of care therapy (Study 15002); or must 
have progressed on prior therapy or was nonresponsive to available therapies and for which no standard 
or available systemic curative therapy existed (Studies 14001 and 15003); or, for infantile fibrosarcoma, 
would require disfiguring surgery or limb amputation to achieve a complete surgical resection (Study 
15003). 
Study 15002 appears to have somewhat less restrictive inclusion criteria in terms of prior therapy 
compared to the phase 1/2-studies, since progression on prior therapy was not required. This could thus 
encompass 1st line treatment. Also the wording in the inclusion criteria for studies 14001 and 15003 “for 
which no standard or available systemic curative therapy exists” appear to allow any line of treatment in 
patients with metastatic tumours, since these are generally not considered curative by any treatment 
modality. With regard to locally advanced tumours, it is often at least theoretically possible that the 
tumour might become resectable after effective systemic therapy and thus curable. Patients with and 
without documented NTRK gene fusion were allowed to participate in Study 14001 and Study 15003. 
Patients enrolled to Study 15002 were required to have TRK fusion positive cancer. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The two dose-finding studies (14001 and 15003) which included patients without NTRK gene fusions as 
well as patients with tumours harbouring the drug target (the resultant TRK fusion protein) provide 
important contributions to the evidence base for larotrectinib’s mechanism of action and clinical rationale. 
In Study 14001, only 1 (2%) PR (seen in a patient with a total tumour burden of 11 mm) and no CR were 
observed in patients with TRK fusion-negative tumours (n=62), in contrast with the high ORR (by INV) of 
88% (7/8) among TRK fusion–positive patients. In study 15003, the ORR (by INV) among 26 fully 
evaluable patients at the time of data-cut off (excluding 2 patients with unconfirmed responses from the 
analysis) was 81% (21/26), while no objective responses were observed in the patients with TRK 
fusion-negative tumours. IRC was apparently not performed for the TRK-fusion negative patients. 
Nevertheless, these comparative data showing high response rates in NTRK fusion-positive groups and 
essentially no responses in NTRK fusion-negative patients, provide clinical support of the proposed 
mechanism of action and the selectivity of the effect to patients harbouring the drug target. The rationale 
for restricting the indication to patients with demonstrated NTRK gene fusions is considered justified 
based on these data.

The choice of target dose for approval was not based on a maximum tolerated dose, or a thorough 
investigation of maximum efficacy. It was based on sufficiently high efficacy in combination with an 
acceptable safety profile, supported by PK data. Subsequent to the selection in Study 14001 of the dose 
100 mg BID in adults for further development, the dose step 150 mg BID was cleared, and also the 200 
mg BID cohort did not fulfil MTD criteria with only 1/6 patients experiencing a DLT.  
With regard to the paediatric dose, from an efficacy point of view, the presently available data (ePAS2) 
indicate a high degree of activity, with ORR at 82% in the overall paediatric population (<18 years), and 
in the lower age groups 1-month to < 2 years the ORR was 100% (12/12); in the 2 to<6 years it was 86% 
(6/7).  
The main efficacy analysis set is the pooled “extended primary analysis set 2”, ePAS2, which consists of 
93 patients from the studies 14001, 15002 and 15003, who had: a NTRK gene fusion, measurable 
disease, and received at least 1 dose of larotrectinib. Patients with primary CNS tumours were excluded 
from the ePAS2. These patients were required to have received prior standard therapy appropriate for 
their tumour type and stage of disease or who, in the opinion of the investigator, would have had to 
undergo radical surgery (such as limb amputation, facial resection, or paralysis causing procedure), or 
were unlikely to tolerate, or derive clinically meaningful benefit from available standard of care therapies 
in the advanced disease setting. 
At the time of data cut-off 57% have treatment ongoing and 31% have experienced disease progression. 
The median time on treatment is 12.1 months and 52% of patients in the ePAS had time on treatment for 
12 months’ or more. Only 14 patients (15%) have died, and 34 patients (37%) have had a PFS-event 
(death or disease progression).  
The ORR by IRC was 72% (n=67/93, 95% CI: 62, 81%), and ORR by investigator assessment (INV) was 
80%. The single-arm, open-label setting allowing for potential investigator bias is noted. The agreement 
rate between IRC and INV assessments was 90%. These overall ORR results are considered outstanding.  
In view of the post-hoc pooling of patients across studies with different original purposes, it is noted that 
the INV ORR was 61% in the Phase-2 basket trial, compared with 81% and 88% in the phase-1/2 studies 
with dose-finding and proof-of principle aims (at previous data cut-off). It is also noted that in the 
previously submitted data from the ePAS (n=73) at a shorter follow-up (19 Feb 2018), 88% of responding 
patients had a response that lasted 6 months or more, and 72% 12 months or more. The corresponding 
results were reduced in the latest update (30 Jul 2018). Thus, in the ePAS2, 72% of responding patients 
had a response duration of 6 months or more, and 42% 12 months or more. This illustrates how limited 
early data can overestimate the true treatment effects. Similarly, the ORR in the paediatric subset (<18 
years) was reduced from 90% in the ePAS to 82% in the ePAS2. 
The median time to response (TTR) was short and very consistent at 1.8 months by IRC and INV, 
respectively, in the ePAS2 as well as in previous versions of the pooled analysis sets (PAS, and ePAS). The 
ePAS2 IRC 25th, 75th percentiles were 1.71 and 1.94 months, respectively. A vast majority of responding 
patients responded at the first tumour evaluation. 
The median duration of response (DoR) was not estimable in any of the individual studies (at previous 
data cut-off) or in the main analysis population, ePAS2, which is consistent with the high proportion of 
patients still in response, 73-86% in the individual studies (INV); 70% in the pooled ePAS2 population 
(IRC and INV).  
Thus, of the 67 responding patients according to IRC, 47 (70%) were still in response at the time of 
analysis. The median time on treatment was 12.1 months, however; thus, among the presently included 
patients the median DoR is likely around 12 months. This would generally be considered a long duration 
of response regardless of line of treatment in any/most metastatic solid tumours. (It should be noted that 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469135/2019  
Page 145/196 
 
 
 
 
a small number of patients continued larotrectinib post-progression, and contributes to the time on 
treatment.) 
The progression-free survival (PFS) median event-rate was low at 37% (IRC) and 38% (INV) in the 
ePAS2, and the median was 27.4 months (95% CI: 13.8, NE) by IRC and 28.3 months (95% CI: 15.2, NE) 
by investigator assessments. The PFS rate at 6 months was 77%, and the PFS rate at 12 months was 64% 
(95% CI: 51, 76%) by IRC.  
The overall survival (OS) median was not reached in the ePAS2 as a result of the present very low 
event-rate of 15% (14/93 dead). The OS median follow-up time was 16.7 months (25th, 75th 
percentiles: 9.3, 23.0 months). The OS rate at 12 months was 88% (95% CI: 81, 95%). Beyond 
approximately 28 months, less than 10 patients remain in the K-M plot. At this point, OS survival portion 
appears to be around 80%. The OS and PFS data are immature at 15% and 37% event rate, respectively, 
in the ePAS2 population. In the CNS group, all 9 patients are still alive. These patients had received prior 
cancer treatment (surgery, radiotherapy and/or previous systemic therapy). 
PFS and OS are important for contextualisation of the ORR and DoR results and in relation to approved 
anticancer products normally approved based on PFS and/or OS. However, due to the pooling of many 
different types of primary malignancies with inherently different prognosis, the data should be interpreted 
with caution.  
Subgroup analyses 
The objective response rate was highly variable across the studied tumour types, from 0% ORR in single 
patients with breast cancer, cholangiocarcinoma and pancreatic cancer to 100% in the 4 patients with 
GIST. Tumour types where NTRK gene fusions are characteristic (or even considered pathognomonic) of 
the disease, such as Infantile fibrosarcoma (IFS, n=13), Salivary gland/MASC (n=10), and congenital 
mesoblastic nephroma (n=1), tended to have higher ORR (92%, 80%, and 100%, respectively). 
However, these estimates are not robust due to the small sample sizes of individual subgroups. 
Patients with primary CNS tumours were excluded from the pooled primary analysis populations, based 
partly on preclinical findings. Among 9 patients with primary CNS tumours who were excluded from the 
ePAS2 based on tumour type, but fulfilled the other criteria, 1 had an objective response (PR); the 
remaining 7 had SD as best response, 3 had numerical tumour size decrease, 3 has had disease 
progression and 6 are ongoing without progression.  The initial application did not include patients with 
primary CNS tumours in the indication for Vitrakvi, however since there is no scientific rationale to 
exclude this previously treated patient population with no satisfactory treatment options available, the 
CHMP considered that the indication should also cover patients with primary CNS tumours. Further data 
are expected post authorisation (see SOBs). 
The ORR (IRC) was 68% (95% CI: 55, 79%) for patients with age ≥ 18 years (n=65); and 82% (95% CI: 
63, 94%) for patients with age < 18 years (n= 28). Patients aged ≥ 65 years (n=15) had a response rate 
of 56% (95% CI: 31, 78%). It should be noted that age groups co-vary with tumour type.  
In view of the uncertainties concerning the paediatric dosing based on body surface area, it is noted the 
in the age group 1-month to < 2 years the ORR was 100% (12/12); and in the age group 2 to <6 years 
it was 86% (6/7). In the next age group, 6 to <12 years, 2/6 patients (33%) had an objective response.  
The exposures were similar in responders and non-responders, in adults and in patients <18 years of age.  
The ORRs per NTRK fusion type was 63% (95% CI: 47, 78%) for NTRK1 (n=41), 33% (95% CI: 1, 91%) 
for NTRK2 (n=3), and 82% (95% CI: 68, 91%) for NTRK3 (n=49).  
Out of 55 patients in the PAS population, 17 had PD after an initial response; from 10 of these the sponsor 
obtained post-progression biopsies. In 8/10 patients NTRK resistance mutations were detected and in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469135/2019  
Page 146/196 
 
 
 
 
remaining 2 patients, BRAF V600E mutations were identified. However, based on additional information, 
one of these patients also had a NTRK resistance mutation, and the other had very low levels of the 
BRAFV600E mutation (<1% allelic fraction) in circulating tumour DNA, hampering the interpretation of 
the role of the BRAF mutation. These NTRK resistance mutations affect the kinase solvent front and the 
xDFG motif. Structural modelling suggests that each mutation directly interferes with binding by both 
larotrectinib and all other first-generation TKIs with TRK activity. Functional studies have subsequently 
confirmed that cancer cells harbouring these mutations are cross-resistant to all TKIs with anti-TRK 
activity. Clinical trials are ongoing with second-generation TRK inhibitors (such as LOXO-195) that have 
been shown to be able to overcome the acquired NTRK mutations. Secondary NTRK mutations altering the 
kinase domain of TRK thus appear to be a/the major acquired resistance mechanism to larotrectinib. 
Information has been included in the SmPC. Furthermore, the Applicant has agreed to amend the 
NAVIGATE study to investigate resistance mechanisms in post-progression biopsies.  
NTRK fusion detection 
Larotrectinib is a targeted therapy and its activity is shown to be highly selective to tumours harbouring 
an NTRK fusion. Correct detection of this fusion is therefore paramount. Molecular pathology reports were 
provided for 105 enrolled on larotrectinib studies 14001, 15002 and 15003 who fulfilled the criteria for 
data pooling. The 105 molecular pathology reports documented the results of 33 unique tests performed 
at 31 different labs. Most of the tests performed were NGS-based (N = 98), while the minority were 
FISH-based (N = 6) and RT-PCR-based (N=1). 
The SmPC states that “the presence of an NTRK gene fusion in a tumour specimen should be confirmed by 
a validated test prior to initiation of treatment with VITRAKVI”.  
Clinical data supporting a histology-independent indication 
As the NTRK fusion is rare in more common tumour types, there is still limited information on the level of 
efficacy in some otherwise common tumour types, such as non-secretory breast cancer, melanoma and 
colorectal cancer. A lower ORR was observed in these histologies as well as a shorter duration of response 
(DoR) compared to other responding tumour types but the numbers are too small to draw any 
conclusions.  
Regarding potential differential resistance mechanisms across tumour histologies, the BRAF example of 
differential additional pathways in different tumour types (melanoma and colorectal cancers) causing 
responses in one but not the other is well-known. Among the 14 patients in the ePAS2 who had PD or SD 
less than 4 months as their best response (i.e. signs of little or no activity), 2 had an additional oncogenic 
driver in their tumour. (The single patient with breast cancer had an AKT E17K mutation, and one patient 
with mixed histology thyroid cancer had a BRAF V600E mutation concomitantly with the NTRK fusion. 
Both had PD.) However, such potential drivers (of other types) were also seen in patients with CR and PR 
(e.g. Flt3-IDT, FGFR1 and PIK3CA, Table 69). In addition, a large variation of molecular alterations, 
involving e.g.TP53, PTEN, and CDKN2A/B were frequently seen in the ePAS2 in responding and 
non-responding patients alike. No conclusions can be drawn based on the single occurrences of known 
oncogenic drivers across patients with and without tumour response, respectively. The BRAFV600E 
mutations might be an exception, since it was also observed in 2/10 patients with PD after initial response 
(i.e. acquired resistance) for whom post-progression biopsies were available, while the remaining 8 
patients had NTRK mutations causing resistance.

who have a disease that is locally advanced, metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to 
result in severe morbidity, and 
- 
who have no satisfactory treatment options (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
The benefit of VITRAKVI has been established in single arm trials encompassing a relatively small sample 
of patients whose tumours exhibit NTRK gene fusions. Favourable effects of VITRAKVI have been shown 
on the basis of overall response rate and response duration in a limited number of tumour types. The 
effect may be quantitatively different depending on tumour type, as well as on concomitant genetic 
alterations. For these reasons, VITRAKVI should only be used if there are no treatment options for which 
clinical benefit has been established, or where such treatment options have been exhausted (i.e., no 
satisfactory treatment options). 
The wording “have no satisfactory treatment options” was chosen in order to allow treatment decisions to 
select the optimal treatment for a patient with an NTRK gene fusion based on a benefit/risk evaluation, 
and allow taking into account that some established therapies could have a low likelihood of benefiting a 
given patient based on poor tolerability or limited efficacy. For tumour types where clearly effective 
options for a given patient are available, larotrectinib would be used after all acceptable treatment options 
have been exhausted. The word satisfactory thus allows the bypassing of therapies of limited efficacy that 
are currently nevertheless recommended in therapy guidelines (in the absence of more effective 
treatments). This is considered appropriate, given the high likelihood of (early and durable) response 
from larotrectinib in most of the studied tumour types and the favourable safety profile.  
This possibility to bypass established therapy options could be a risk, however, if therapies that are known 
to confer an overall survival benefit are disregarded, considering that at this time, based on 
non-comparative larotrectinib trials, no OS advantage over available therapies has been established. In 
other words, there could be a risk of an indication “drift” towards earlier lines of therapy for which a 
positive B/R was not established. The CHMP nevertheless considers that the magnitude of effect in terms 
of ORR and DoR and the early timing of responses reduce this risk. The Applicant will submit a global 
non-interventional study where drug utilisation patterns can be studied (see RMP). 
The surgical morbidity criterion “or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity” is 
derived from paediatric study LOXO-TRK-15003 (Study 15003) that included patients with locally 
advanced infantile fibrosarcoma “that would otherwise require disfiguring surgery or limb amputation to 
achieve a complete surgical resection”. A total of 8 patients met this criterion.  These eight patients had 
resectable disease which, had the resection occurred, would have led to limb amputation (in 2-3 cases) or 
anticipated permanent motor or sensory deficits. In one case, the reason for larotrectinib was noted as 
inability to obtain clear margins [if surgery was to be performed]. Out of 8 patients, 2 achieved CR 
(radiological), 2 had surgical CR – both taken off larotrectinib, 3 had PR (radiological), and 1 was resected 
without achieving complete resection. All who achieved radiological PR and CR continued on larotrectinib 
therapy. It is acknowledged that some patients presenting with a disease in which cure through surgery 
is the therapeutic goal, could have a better outcome with cytoreduction of the tumour with larotrectinib 
followed by surgical resection, thus avoiding disfiguring amputation and permitting limb salvage.

CHMP questions with SAG answers12 
1. 
Do available data support the assumption that NTRK gene mutations are driver 
mutations, that the mechanism of action is independent of tumour type/histology, and that 
hereby larotrectinib is likely to exhibit clinically relevant activity in tumours expressing NTRK 
fusion proteins regardless of the tissue of tumour origin? 
The SAG agreed by consensus that available data do not support the hypothesis that NTRK gene fusions 
are universally oncogenic “drivers”, independently of tumour type/histology and other disease 
characteristics; that the relevance of the mechanism of action may differ according to these and other 
characteristics; and that the non-clinical and clinical data are insufficient to establish activity regardless of 
tumour type and other characteristics. In some paediatric malignancies preclinical and clinical data 
support NTRK as an oncogenic driver. Specifically fusion genes affecting NTRK1/2/3 are highly recurrent 
in certain rare malignancies. The best known form of NTRK fusion gene is the ETV6-NTRK3, which is 
present in >95% of secretory carcinomas of the breast [1], mammary analogue secretory carcinoma 
(MASC) of the salivary glands [2], congenital fibrosarcoma [3] and cellular mesoblastic nephromas [4]. 
During the initial discussion, one expert raised the possibility to have a tissue independent approval for 
cancers with proven NTRK fusions as oncogenic “drivers”, provided that next generation sequencing 
(NGS) could exclude other alterations being significant drivers for tumour progression. However, data are 
lacking to establish the efficacy of such possible strategy (see also answer to question No. 3). Another 
expert expressed concern for the very low percentage of breast cancers having proven NTRK fusions as 
“oncogenic driver”. 
Concerning the biological rationale, there are only few tumour types (listed above) for which NTRK fusions 
have been established as oncogenic “drivers” regardless of other characteristics. Larotrectinib has also 
shown important activity in GIST with NTRK after resistance/relapse with imatinib (ORR=5/5) and this 
likely reflects a similar role for NTRK fusions. For these conditions, given the strong rationale and the 
available clinical data (for some of these conditions, salivary gland ORR=15/17; infantile fibrosarcoma 
ORR=12/13; congenital mesoblastic nephroma ORR=1/1) and based on reasonable extrapolations, it 
possible to conclude that efficacy has been established in the absence of available treatments of proven 
efficacy in terms of convincing clinical efficacy endpoints.  
However, confirmatory evidence on tumour biology (as close as possible to treatment initiation) and 
clinical outcomes should be provided.  
For other conditions, the role of NTRK fusions as oncogenic “drivers” is not properly studied and 
well-established. There are insufficient data to establish the activity of larotrectinib due to lack of 
comprehensive sequencing of tumour tissue prior to treatment, the small sample size in different tumour 
types, the significant heterogeneity observed in terms of ORR coupled with the notably very low ORR 
observed in different tumour types (ORR=0%-33%), especially in those common tumour types where 
occurrence of NTRK gene fusion is rare (lung, colon, breast).

For which, if any, histologies is the prognostic impact of NRTK fusion proteins 
presently understood? Does the prognostic impact differ depending on the gene fusion 
partner? 
The association between the NTRK-fusions or the fused NTRK genes and prognosis in terms of long-term 
clinical outcomes is not generally well-understood due to very limited data except for the rare tumour 
types listed above where the fusion proteins are considered indicative of the disease (pathognomonic).   
3. 
Does the proposed indication statement adequately cover those patients for whom 
treatment with larotrectinib would be clinically reasonable, and exclude those for whom it 
would not? 
The proposed indication encompassing all solid tumours independently of tumour type does not reflect 
the conditions where efficacy has been established based on available data or reasonable extrapolations. 
In addition, however, one can note that larotrectinib has demonstrated an acceptable safety profile, albeit 
the number of exposed patients is low. In conclusion, evidence-based clinical decisions to use 
larotrectinib are only justified for the rare conditions listed above and in situations where established 
alternatives are lacking or, as in the case of major surgical procedures, where available alternatives are 
associated with high morbidity and mortality.  
From a clinical decision perspective, use of larotrectinib may be an attractive therapeutic option when 
established effective treatments are lacking and when based on relevant tumour tissue sequencing one 
could confirm the presence of NTRK-fusions and exclude other known oncogenic “drivers”. However, such 
decisions cannot be considered evidence-based due to the lack of clinical evidence and the lack of 
predictive ability of clinical decision algorithms purely based on sequencing data. Nevertheless, such 
approaches warrant further investigation.    
4. 
What additional (non-)clinical studies might be relevant to further confirm the 
assumption of tissue-independent activity of larotrectinib? 
A main drawback of the studies presented was the lack of comprehensive sequencing (NGS) of relevant 
tumour tissue reflecting the tumour characteristics at the time of treatment with larotrectinib. Such 
studies are necessary to understand the role of NTRK fusions in the context of other disease 
characteristics to allow patient selection and further evidence-based development in other indications or 
across groups of tumour types. Although the burden associated with biopsies is well-recognised most 
patients understand its importance and are willing to undergo the procedure. Liquid biopsies should be 
further investigated to address this challenge; these should be performed in projects with a joint tumour 
biopsy up-front and ideally at cancer progression. For the rare indications listed above, such studies 
should be conducted to refine the understanding on patient selection.  
Retrospective analyses on the prognostic implications based on relevant tumour samples collected at the 
time of last progression prior to larotrectinib treatment, should also be conducted, if possible. 
Retrospective data should also be obtained on the prognostic implications for different NTRK fusions 
derived from large institutions/ large population based registries, as once demonstrated for c-ERBB2 
(Her-2). The therapy predictive value for larotrectinib should then be firmly established, including 
multivariate analyses including other relevant prognostic factors/predictors. 
Furthermore, there is a need to confirm the activity for many of the listed conditions, following all patients 
for long-term outcomes. Such studies should be conducted as interventional studies adhering to rigorous 
response adjudication (RECIST); “real-life” non-interventional studies may not be sufficient to draw valid 
conclusions. 
To further develop the product across other tumour types, or to establish independence from tumour 
type, it is important to collect convincing biological and clinical evidence to understand the resistance

mechanisms involved, especially primary resistance, the role of concomitant biological and other 
characteristics that may explain the observed heterogeneity or lack of activity, and to confirm any 
reasonable extrapolations using reasonably powered studies to detect sufficient activity in different 
tumour types, in particular the more common cancers.  
Studies should also continue with the purpose to analyse activity, as determined by e.g. tyrosine 
phosphorylation assays, of other NTRK-fusion-gene products than those already analysed. Also, data 
should be collected regarding the ability of larotrectinib to block kinase activity of other NTRK-fusion-gene 
products than those already analysed. 
Further non-clinical studies should also be conducted to better understand fusion protein regulation and 
activity in the presence of other activated relevant genes/suppression of tumour suppressors which may 
modify the effect by larotrectinib. 
A wide array of different techniques can be employed in the detection of NTRK1/2/3 rearrangements. In 
the available and ongoing clinical studies gene rearrangements have been assayed by fluorescence in situ 
hybridization (FISH) and reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR, and FISH assays for the detection of the 
ETV6-NTRK3 fusion gene are commercially available. However, given the multitude of 5’ partners 
involved in NTRK1/2/3 fusion genes, assays that allow for the detection of multiple variants in a single 
test, including NGS-based RNA and DNA approaches, have been widely used in large academic centres. 
The adoption of these NGS-based methods seems to be the better option despite testing can also be 
performed with immunohistochemistry followed by confirmatory NGS. Data on sensitivity and specificity 
on all available essays should be made available. 
Further to the SAG responses, the CHMP considered the limitations of data and uncertainties in respect to 
efficacy in different tumour type subgroups are agreed and have been previously identified during the 
procedure. However, recognising certain degree of heterogeneity in response is unavoidable in the same 
way as there will be important effect modifiers within the scope of any indication, including those based 
on histology and other patient, disease or treatment characteristics. Thus, the critical issues are whether 
the studies are representative of the treated population once the product is authorised and what 
uncertainties are acceptable given available data and the intended use – in this case as a last line 
treatment in patients without satisfactory treatment options. 
The CHMP also sought advice from the CHMP Biostatistics working party (BSWP). 
The request to the BSWP concerned the statistical principles to be applied in the analysis of data to 
determine that a certain tissue of origin is a genuine outlier with respect to objective responses. 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
Due to the limited size of the efficacy database, including uncertainties due to the single arm nature of the 
studies, the presently available efficacy data for larotrectinib are not considered comprehensive.  
The main areas of non-comprehensive data with regard to efficacy are:  
- The benefit in subgroups of patients based on histology. This may be studied in terms of ORR and 
DoR in prospective single-arm studies encompassing a broad variety of tumour types. 
- The requirement for unbiased estimate of ORR and DoR. This may be studied in a prospective 
cohort study. 
- The size of treatment benefit on time-dependent outcome measures (OS, PFS); 
- Resistance mechanisms and the role of concomitant oncogenic drivers to further characterise 
efficacy in different subgroups.

In order to fulfil a comprehensive data package, the Applicant as part of study LOXO-TRK-15002 
(NAVIGATE) will submit a prospective cohort of 75 patients, for which at least 1 year of follow-up is 
available, and will perform an overall pooled analysis where the target population includes the 
ePAS2/SAS3 cohort (with the updated data) along with the prospective cohort, which would give 
increased precision of the estimates for the ORR and DoR.  
In addition, the applicant will enrol at least 9 and up to 20 patients in total in each of the identified 
common tumour type subgroups (lung, melanoma, colorectal cancer, non-secretory breast), and 
pre-specifies rules for conclusions of adequate/inadequate clinical activity. A Bayesian approach, using 
non-informative prior distribution for ORR is proposed. The posterior probability for ORR is calculated to 
be ≥ 10%. If all of the first 9 patients fail to respond then posterior probability of adequate clinical activity 
is <0.2. 
The applicant will continue enrolment in the prospective cohort for 36 months post approval. The plan is 
to enrol 200 patients (75 already enrolled) including 80 in the common tumour types and 120 in the other 
tumour types and would discuss with the Agency whether enrolment should continue.  
Furthermore, the applicant will review the relevance of clinical efficacy in a given histology in case of no 
responses in 9 patients. If that occurs in the prospective cohort, the applicant should alert the Agency. In 
order to decide whether “inadequate response” has been identified in certain tumour types, the applicant 
will follow a Bayesian approach as a methodological rule and conventional approach. The applicant will 
inform the Agency if the criteria of “inadequate response” according to the Bayesian approach is fulfilled 
for any particular histology. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, notwithstanding the considerable methodological caveats outlined above, the efficacy estimates 
available today may be considered outstanding in this generally late stage disease setting. The main issue 
efficacy-wise is the robustness and generalisability of these estimates. While it is likely that the estimates 
may change, possibly in a negative direction, the present outstanding estimates provide some 
reassurance as to the presence of a large treatment benefit. Important quantitative interactions between 
treatment and tumour type will be further explored. 
Available data are thus considered non-comprehensive and a conditional approval is therefore considered 
appropriate. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the context 
of a CMA: 
- In order to further confirm the histology-independent efficacy of larotrectinib and to investigate the 
primary and secondary resistance mechanisms, the MAH should submit a pooled analysis for the 
increased sample size including the final report of study LOXO-TRK-15002 (NAVIGATE). 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The initial submission with data cut-off date of 19 February 2018 included an integrated, pooled safety set 
named the “Overall Safety Analysis Set” (N=176) comprising data from all adult and paediatric patients 
who had a malignancy with or without a documented NTRK gene fusion and who received at least one 
dose of larotrectinib  in studies LOXO-TRK-14001 (≥18 years of age, N = 70), LOXO-TRK-15002 
(acronym NAVIGATE, ≥ 12 years of age, N = 63), and LOXO-TRK-15003 (acronym SCOUT, paediatric 
population, N = 43). Notably, the pooled safety set did not distinguish data between adults and paediatric 
patients nor according to the recommended larotrectinib dose. A safety update with a new cut-off date of 
30 July 2018, has provided an additional 5.5 months of follow-up and with an increase in number to a total 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469135/2019

of 56 paediatric and 152 adult patients. This update also includes data presented separately for the adult 
and paediatric population treated with the recommended dose and data according to the respective 
paediatric age-cohorts.  
The safety assessment is based on data with the data cut-off date of 30 July 2018 unless otherwise 
specified. 
Patient exposure 
Table 77: Patient Disposition by Analysis Set as of the Data Cut-off 30 Jul 2018 
At the new data cut-off date, 94 (45%) of the patients in the Overall Safety set (N=208) and 93 (68 %) of the patients 
in the Overall NTRK Fusion Cancers set (N=137) were still on study treatment. The most common reasons for 
discontinuation was disease progression (87 patients [42 %]). Overall the low number of patients that discontinued 
study drug due to AEs is recognised (overall ≤ 4 %).

for 15 % of the patients in the Overall Safety Analysis Set however dose reductions due to AEs were 
infrequent with a low proportion of 9 %. Reasons for dose increases were mainly due to increase in BMI/ 
weight gain.

Adverse events 
Table 80: Overall Adverse Event Information (Larotrectinib Analysis Sets) by Analysis Set as of the Data 
Cut-off 30 Jul 2018 
Almost all patients in the Overall Safety Analysis set experienced at least one TEAE (98 %) with the vast 
majority of TEAEs considered related to study drug (80 %). Half of the study population experienced 
Grade 3 or 4 events with 13 % considered related to treatment. Reports of serious TEAEs were similar 
between the analysis sets, accounting for about 1/3 of the respective study populations. TEAE leading to 
treatment discontinuation were reported in 11 % in the Overall safety analysis set which should be 
compared with about 5 % in the NTRK Gene Fusion Cancer analysis sets.  
By System Organ Class (SOC) in the Overall safety set, TEAEs were most commonly reported in the SOCs 
of Gastrointestinal disorders (70 % [Nausea 28 %]), General disorders and administration site conditions 
(63 % [Fatigue 36 %]), Nervous system disorders (62 % [Dizziness 29 %]), Musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders (51 % [Myalgia 16 %]), Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal disorders (51 
% [Cough 26 %]), Metabolism and Nutrition disorders (50 % Decreased [appetite 13 %]), Investigations 
(48 % [AST and ALT increase 26 % each]), Infection and infestation (43 %), and Blood and lymphatic 
system disorders (41 % [Anaemia 26 %]).   
Similar proportions were observed in the Overall NTRK Fusion Cancers set.

cases without any distinguishable pattern.  The same is observed in terms of Grade 4 events. The 
corresponding proportions for the Efficacy-eval NTRK Fusion cancer set (N=93) is similar. A total of 40 
reports (43 %) of Grade 3 and 8 cases (9 %) of Grade 4 with the most common Grade 3 event being also 
anaemia (10 %). In the Overall NTRK Fusion Cancers Safety (N=137), Grade 3 events were reported in 
36 % and Grade 4 in 7 %.

Adult population 
Table 83. Treatment-emergent Adverse Events by Recommended Dose for Adults (Subgroup Overall

In the subgroup of adults treated with the recommended dose in the Overall Safety Set (N=152), 98 % 
had any TEAEs with Fatigue (38 %), Dizziness (37 %), Nausea (30 %) and Anaemia (26 %) the most 
commonly events reported. AST and ALT elevations were reported in 23 % and 22 % respectively. 
The corresponding proportion for the subgroup of adults treated with the recommended dose in the 
Overall NTRK Fusion Cancers Safety Set (N=90) shows a similar pattern with Dizziness (41 %) followed 
by Fatigue (38 %), Nausea (30 %) and Anaemia (24 %). AST and ALT elevations were reported in 26 % 
and 27 % respectively (Table not shown).

Continued,  
In terms of the paediatric population, the pattern of reported events differs from that of the adult 
population. In the subgroup of paediatric patients treated with the recommended dose in the Overall 
Safety Set (N=56), 98 % had any TEAEs with ALT and AST elevations most commonly reported (38 % and 
36 % respectively, followed by Vomiting (36 %), Neutrophil decreased (31 %), Constipation (29 %) and 
Diarrhoea (29 %). 
The corresponding proportions for the subgroup of paediatric patients treated with the recommended 
dose in the Overall NTRK Fusion Cancers Safety Set (N=47), is very similar to that of the Overall safety 
Set with ALT and AST elevations most commonly reported (41 % and 35 % respectively, followed by 
Vomiting (35 %), Diarrhoea (32 %), Neutrophil decreased (30 %), and Constipation (30 %) (Table not

Continued, 
In the youngest age-group (Infants and Toddlers, N=18), 94 % had any TEAEs with ALT elevations, 
Vomiting and Diarrhoea (61 % each) most commonly reported followed by Pyrexia and Constipation (56 
% each), Neutrophil count decreased (50 %), AST elevations, Cough and Anaemia (44 % each) and 
Fatigue (39 %). 
For the Children age group (N=23), the corresponding proportions are 96 % with any TEAE and most 
commonly reported are AST and ALT elevations (39 %) each, Vomiting (35 %), Cough, Diarrhoea and 
headache (30 % each). 
In terms of Adolescents (N=15), all patients reported any TEAE with Pain in extremity most commonly 
reported (40 %), followed by AST elevation, Neutrophil count decreased, Nausea and Headache most 
commonly reported (33 %) ALT elevation, Vomiting and Dizziness (27 % each).

The limited number of patients in each paediatric age cohort is recognised thus hampering any firm 
conclusions. Nevertheless, in the youngest age cohort there were more TEAEs reported in terms of e.g. 
neutropenia, anaemia, pyrexia, GI disorders (diarrhoea, vomiting, constipation and nausea) and weight 
increase as compared to the older age cohorts. 
In terms of the Overall NTRK Fusion Cancers Safety Set (N=47), with a total of 18 patients enrolled in the 
age group of Infants and Toddlers, 20 patients in the Children age group and 9 patients in the Adolescents 
group, the pattern and proportions of reported PTs are similar to that of the Paediatric Subgroup Overall 
Safety Set above (Table not shown).  
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) 
Since all the safety data for the ADR assessments were from open-label Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies (with 
no comparator arm), the determination of ADRs was primarily based on investigators’ causality 
assessments of reported events: 
- AEs were assessed as ADRs if half or more (≥ 50%) of these were regarded as at least possibly drug 
related by investigators (based on company internal guideline for generating ADRs). 
- Plausible pharmacological effect based on larotrectinib mode of action, clinical relevance, frequency and 
severity were taken into consideration in the determination of ADRs. 
Frequency of ADRs identified was determined on the basis of the total number of patients treated with 
larotrectinib (n=208). This was used as a denominator for frequency determination of these ADRs. As of 
the data cut-off date 30 July 2018, there were three on-going studies (Studies 1, 2 (“NAVIGATE”), and 3 
(“SCOUT”)), and no available postmarketing data. 
- For all ADRs identified, frequency was determined irrespective of investigator’s causality assessment. 
- The threshold of ≥ 5% was applied for selection of the ADRs from the Common Related AEs.

Source: TEAEs in overall NTRK fusion positive cancers (data cut-off 30 JUL 2018) and TEAEs by age group (cut-off 
30 JUL 2018). 
Of 125 patients treated with larotrectinib in the overall NTRK fusion safety population at the 
recommended dose, 37 (30%) patients were from 28 days to 18 years of age. Of these 37 patients, 38% 
were 28 days to < 2 years (n=14), 41% were 2 years to < 12 years (n=15), and 22% were 12 years to 
< 18 years (n=8).  
The majority of adverse reactions were Grade 1 or 2 in severity and were resolved without larotrectinib 
dose modification or discontinuation. The adverse reactions of vomiting (35% versus 14% in adults), 
leucocyte count decrease (22% versus 9% in adults), neutrophil count decrease (30% versus 7% in 
adults), blood alkaline phosphatase increased (14% versus 2% in adults) and transaminase elevations 
(ALT 41% versus 27% in adults and AST 35% versus 26% in adults) were more frequent in paediatric 
patients compared to adults.

Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) 
Note: The assessment of AESIs below is based on data with the data cut-off date of 19 February 2018 
Based on predictions from the TRK-related neurobiology literature, the preclinical toxicology program, 
and clinical experience with larotrectinib, the following three AESIs were pre- identified: 
Transaminase (ALT or AST) increases  
Increases in ALT and/or AST were predicted off-target effects from the preclinical toxicology program.  
In the overall NTRK fusion safety database (n=125), the maximum grade transaminase elevation 
observed was Grade 4 ALT increase in 1 patient (<1%). Grade 3 ALT and AST increases in 3 (2%) and 2

(2%) patients, respectively. Majority of Grade 3 elevations were transient appearing in first or second 
month of treatment and resolving to Grade 1 by months 3-4. Grade 2 ALT and AST increases were 
observed in 9 (7%) and 6 (5%) of patients, respectively, and Grade 1 ALT and AST increases were 
observed in 26 (21%) and 28 (22%) of patients, respectively. ALT and AST increases leading to dose 
modifications occurred in 7 (6%) patients and 6 (5%) patients, respectively. No patient permanently 
discontinued the treatment due to Grade 3 4 ALT and AST increases (see sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the 
SmPC). 
No cases of Hy’s Law of drug induced liver injury have been confirmed.  
The incidence of ALT increased and AST increased was higher in paediatric patients compared with adult 
patients. The incidence of ALT increased was 58% in infants and toddlers compared with 42% in children 
and 31% in adolescents, and the incidence of AST increased was 42% in infants and toddlers compared 
with 37% in children and 38% in adolescents. 
There are no indications of any cumulative hepatic toxicity in terms of ALT/ AST increases by larotrectinib. 
The Applicant proposes to include “Severe drug-induced liver injury” as an Important Potential Risk in the 
safety specification which is supported. 
Neutropenia  
Neutropenia was not seen in preclinical studies but was observed in clinical trials, mainly in paediatric 
patients and most commonly in the youngest paediatric age cohorts. At the data cut-off 30 July 2018, 
neutropenia has been reported in 25 patients (12%). 72% of neutropenia occurred in paediatric 
population (Grade 1 in 3 patients, Grade 2 in 7 patients, Grade 3 in 7 patients and Grade 4 in 1 patient).  
A total of 11 cases of neutropenia reported in paediatric population were considered to be related to 
larotrectinib (2 Grade 1, 6 Grade 2, 2 Grade 3 and 1 Grade 4). No treatment discontinuation was required 
due to neutropenia. One febrile neutropenia has been reported in a 16-months old patient but considered 
as not treatment related. 
Investigators reported neutropenia as a TEAE (PT neutrophil count decreased) in 17 (10%) patients and 
this was considered by the investigator to be related to treatment in 9 (5%) patients. In addition, an SAE 
of febrile neutropenia was reported for 1 patient (considered unrelated to study drug). Fifteen of the 18 
observations were observed in paediatric patients. Worst severity was Grade 1 in 4 patients, Grade 2 in 
5 patients, Grade 3 in 8 patients (including the case of febrile neutropenia), and Grade 4 in 1 patient. 
Neutropenia leading to dose modification occurred in 4 patients and to dose reduction in two patients. 
None led to treatment discontinuation. 
Changes in neutrophil counts using laboratory reports for all patients included in the Overall safety 
analysis set were analysed. As is observed with the investigator reported TEAEs for neutropenia, most 
were Grade 1 or 2, and 33 of 39 (85%) reports occurred within the first 3 cycles (one cycle is defined as 
28 days) of larotrectinib treatment. 
The Applicant is committed to continue to monitor neutropenia both in adult and paediatric patients. 
Infections secondary to neutropenia has been added as important potential risk in the RMP. 
Neurologic effects  
There is potential for on-target central effects of larotrectinib in humans (neurologic reactions) due to the 
mechanism of action (neurotrophin signaling). In the postnatal period, TRK receptors are expressed in the 
brain and nervous system and are thought to regulate mood, memory, cognition, and proprioception.  
In the overall NTRK fusion safety database (n=125), the maximum grade neurologic reaction observed 
was Grade 3 which was observed in three (2%) patients and included dizziness (one patient, <1%) and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469135/2019

paraesthesia (two patients, 1.6%). The overall incidence was 30% for dizziness, 10% for paraesthesia 
and 3% for gait disturbance. Neurologic reactions leading to dose modification included dizziness (2%). 
None of these adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation. In all cases, patients with evidence of 
anti-tumour activity who required a dose reduction were able to continue dosing at a reduced dose and/or 
schedule 
The incidence of the five most commonly reported neurologic events regardless of severity (dizziness, 
gait disturbance, paraesthesia, anxiety, and peripheral sensory neuropathy) was lower in paediatric 
patients compared with adult patients with the exception of gait disturbance. 
The time to onset of the first episode was generally within the first month of starting treatment. For most 
patients no action with study drug was required. The majority of episodes resolved without sequelae and 
16 of these TEAEs were ongoing as of the data cut-off. 
There were 15 patients with primary or metastatic brain tumours included in the clinical studies. 
Neurologic TEAEs were reported by 10 of these patients: the TEAEs reported were dizziness (2 patients), 
vertigo, (2 patients), dysarthria (2 patients), hypoaesthesia (2 patients), balance disorder, paraesthesia, 
sensory disturbance, agitation, gait disturbance, extrapyramidal disorder, neuralgia, peripheral sensory 
neuropathy, cognitive disorder, memory impairment, mental status changes, delirium, dyskinesia (each 
1 patient). Two were considered by the investigators to be related to study treatment.

Serious Adverse Events 
Table 88: Serious TEAEs (Larotrectinib Analysis Sets) as of Data Cut-off 30 Jul 2018, abbreviated 
A total of 34 % in the Overall Safety Analysis set experienced at least one SAE during treatment with 
similar results for the NTRK gene fusion analysis set (28 %) and the Efficacy-evaluable NTRK gene fusion 
analysis set (33 %). Most commonly reported in the Overall Safety Analysis set (aside from disease 
progression which is not regarded as an AE) was pyrexia (3 %), diarrhoea and sepsis (each reported in 2 
%).

however the corresponding raw laboratory data reported at that time equated to a Grade 3 ALT elevation. 
The correct corresponding laboratory value equating to a Grade 4 ALT has since been updated and will be 
reflected in future reports.  
At any time during the study (regardless of baseline value), the maximum grade reported for AST 
elevations was Grade 1 for 79 (45%) patients, Grade 2 for 12 (7%) patients, and Grade 3 for 6 (3%) 
patients. 
Grade 3 of bilirubin increase was reported in 3 % (6 patients). In terms of albumin decrease there were 
6 reports of Grade 3 events (3 %, no Grade 4) and 4 reports of Grade 3 phosphorus decrease (2 %) with 
1 report of Grade 4 in the Overall safety Analysis set. 
Body Weight 
Body weight changes are presented using a cut-off date of 17 July 2017. The majority of adult patients 
(62 %) showed no change in either the upward or downward direction. 
Body weight changes in paediatric patients were assessed by summary statistics on the change in 
percentile from standard growth charts. Median percentile increased from a baseline of 30.4 % to a last 
value of 71.7 %. The median maximum decrease was 0.2 % and the median maximum increase was 8.5 
%. In general, these changes represented both normal growth and development and normalization of low 
baseline body weights. However, 7 patients in LOXO TRK 15003 were reported with body weight increase 
as a TEAE. Weight increased was reported in 10 (23%) pediatric patients compared with 16 (12%) adult 
patients. 
Electrocardiograms (ECG) 
A clinical pharmacology study, LOXO-TRK-16009 (Phase 1 single ascending dose, randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled study), was conducted in 36 subjects to evaluate doses of 100 to 900 mg 
for their impact on ECG parameters (please refer to the PK section). 
In cancer patients treated with 100 mg BID larotrectinib, twice the “worst case” Cmax was considered to 
be approximately 5100 ng/mL and at this concentration, the modelled value for ddQTcF was ˗3.318 msec 
with 90% upper CI ˗2.127 msec. There were no QTcF values >450 msec observed at baseline or post 
treatment or change from baseline values greater than 30 msec on this study. No other ECG parameters 
reached the pre-specified out-of-normal range categories for PR, QRS, and heart rate. 
Safety in special populations 
Note: the assessment below is based on data with the data cut-off date of 19 February 2018 
Gender 
The percentage of patients with 1 or more AEs was very similar for males and females (99 % and 98 % 
respectively). Males had higher incidences (10% or greater relative to females) of dizziness (38% vs 
18%), ALT increased (31% vs 20%), headache (19% vs 9%), and weight decreased (12% vs 0). 
Race 
The vast majority of patients included in the Overall Safety Analysis set were white (72 %).

Age 
Table 90: Common AEs by Age Group (Occurring in≥ 20% of any Age Group) (Overall Safety Analysis Set) 
The following TEAEs were reported ≥10% in patients <18 years than in patients ≥18 years: cough (36% 
vs 23%), AST increased (39% vs 21%), ALT increased (43% vs 20%), diarrhoea (30% vs 20%), vomiting 
(48%  vs  18%),  pyrexia  (27%  vs  14%),  weight  increased  (23%  vs  12%),  headache  (23%  vs  11%), 
hypertension (20% vs 8%), nasal congestion (20% vs 7%), leukocyte count decreased (23% vs 3%) and 
neutrophil count decreased (32% vs 3%).  
In the updated Overall Safety Dataset (data cut-off 30 July 2018), hypertension has been reported in 21 
(10%) patients, 16% in paediatrics vs 8% in adults.  
In  paediatric  patients,  hypertension  Grade  1  and  Grade  2  were  reported  in  5  patients  and  4  patients 
respectively.  No  Grade  3-4  has  been  reported.  Hypertension  has  been  considered  as  related  to 
laroctectinib in three cases. 
The following TEAEs were reported ≥10% in patients ≥18 years than in patients <18 years: fatigue (42% 
vs 23%), dizziness (34% vs 11%), dyspnoea (21% vs 7%) and oedema peripheral (20% vs 2%). 
The following TEAEs were reported ≥10% in patients ≥65 years than in patients ≥18 years: fatigue (53% 
vs 42%), anaemia (39% vs 27%), constipation (32% v 22%) and fall (21% vs 9%). Only 9 patients ≥ 75 
years old are included in the overall safety analysis set. Safety data are limited in this category of patient.  
AEs adjudicated as related AEs was generally consistent across age group: 
The most commonly reported related AE in the paediatric population were: ALT increased (36%), AST 
increased  (32%),  leukocytes  count  decreased  (20%),  neutrophil  count  decreased  (20%),  anaemia 
(16%), nausea (14%), fatigue (13%), constipation (13%) and vomiting 11%). 
In the adult population they were: dizziness (28%), fatigue (20%), ALT increased (16%), nausea (16%), 
AST increased (15%), constipation (23%), myalgia (11%) and dysgueusia (10%).

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The initial submission with data cut-off date of 19 February 2018 included an integrated, pooled safety set 
named the “Overall Safety Analysis Set” (N=176) comprising data from all adult and paediatric patients 
who had a malignancy with or without a documented NTRK gene fusion and who received at least one 
dose of larotrectinib  in studies LOXO-TRK-14001 (≥18 years of age, N = 70), LOXO-TRK-15002 
(acronym NAVIGATE, ≥ 12 years of age, N = 63), and LOXO-TRK-15003 (acronym SCOUT, paediatric 
population, N = 43). In study LOXO-TRK-14001, 8 (11 %) patients had TRK fusion cancers whilst the 
majority were patients with non-TRK fusion cancers (62 [89 %]). In the paediatric study 
LOXO-TRK-15003, 9 (21 %) patients with non-TRK fusion cancers and 34 (79 %) patients with TRK fusion 
cancers were enrolled. In terms of the paediatric population, the number of patients enrolled according to 
the following age cohorts was: < 1 year → 9 (5 %), 1 - < 6 years → 14 (8 %), 6 - <12 years → 8 (5 %), 
12 - < 18 years →13 (7 %).  
None of the studies included a comparator which hampers the evaluation of the safety data. A deficiency 
in the presentation of the integrated safety set was that it did not distinguish data between adults and 
paediatric patients or malignancies with or without a documented NTRK gene fusion. Neither were there 
any safety data presented in the patient populations treated at recommended larotrectinib dose. 
Following the assessment of the safety update (new cut-off date of 30 July 2018) with an additional 5.5 
months follow-up and an increase in number to a total of 56 paediatric and 152 adult patients comprising 
the overall safety analysis set, it may be agreed that overall no clinically relevant change to the toxicity 
profile of larorectinib has been identified when compared to the one characterised based on the data from 
the 19 February 2018 data cut-off date. In terms of patients treated at the recommended dose, no 
clinically relevant differences were observed as compared to those treated with a non-recommended 
dose.  The safety profiles between the Overall safety set and the NTRK cancer fusion analysis sets are also 
similar. In terms of safety profiles between adults and the paediatric population, some differences in 
safety profiles are noted. Likewise, some differences in safety profiles are observed between the 
paediatric age-cohorts (see below). 
At the new data cut-off date, 45% of the patients in the Overall Safety set (N=208) and 68 % of the 
patients in the Overall NTRK Fusion Cancers set (N=137) were still on study treatment. The most common 
reasons for discontinuation was disease progression (87 patients [42 %]). Overall the low number of 
patients that discontinued study drug due to AEs is recognised (≤ 4 %).  
Median time on treatment was longer for the Efficacy-evaluable NTRK fusion cancers (N=93) and the 
Overall NTRK fusion cancers analysis sets (N=137) than that for the Overall Safety Analysis Set (N=208) 
with 12.1 months [range 0.66 to 40.7], 7.5 months [range 0.03 to 40.7] and 4.1 months [range 0.03 to 
40.7] respectively. The shorter median time on treatment for the latter group is not unexpected as the 
Overall Safety set includes also patients without the NRTK gene fusions whom are not expected to 
respond to the study drug.  
Overall the vast majority of patients needed dose modifications (≥ 80 %). Dose reductions were needed 
for 15 % of the patients in the Overall Safety Analysis Set however dose reductions due to AEs were 
infrequent with a low proportion of 9 %. Reasons for dose increases were mainly due to increase in BMI/ 
weight gain.  
Assessment report

Almost all patients in the Overall Safety Analysis set experienced at least one TEAE (98 %) with the vast 
majority of TEAEs considered related to study drug (80 %). By System Organ Class (SOC) in the Overall 
safety set, TEAEs were most commonly reported in the SOCs of Gastrointestinal disorders (70 % [Nausea 
28 %]), General disorders and administration site conditions (63 % [Fatigue 36 %]), Nervous system 
disorders (62 % [Dizziness 29 %]), Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (51 % [Myalgia 16 
%]), Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal disorders (51 % [Cough 26 %]), Metabolism and Nutrition 
disorders (50 % Decreased [appetite 13 %]), Investigations (48 % [AST and ALT increase 26 % each]), 
Infection and infestation (43 %), and Blood and lymphatic system disorders (41 % [Anaemia 26 %]). 
Similar proportions were observed in the Overall NTRK Fusion Cancers set. 
In terms of TEAEs by Preferred Term (PT), most commonly reported were Fatigue (36 %), Dizziness (29 
%), Nausea (28 %), Constipation (27 %), ALT increase, Anaemia, AST increase and Cough (26 % each), 
Vomiting (24 %9, Diarrhoea (23 %) and Pyrexia (18 %). Similar proportions and patterns were observed 
in the Overall NTRK Fusion Cancers set. 
In regard to TEAEs by severity, Grade 3 were reported in 82 patients (39 %) and grade 4 in 13 patients 
(6%) in the Overall safety set. The most common reported Grade 3 event was anaemia (10 %) and the 
remaining reports were isolated cases without any distinguishable pattern.  The same is observed in 
terms of Grade 4 events. The corresponding proportions for the Efficacy-eval NTRK Fusion cancer set is 
similar. A total of 40 reports (43 %) of Grade 3 and 8 cases (9 %) of Grade 4 with the most common Grade 
3 event being also anaemia (10 %). In the Overall NTRK Fusion Cancers Safety, Grade 3 events were 
reported in 36 % and Grade 4 in 7 %. 
The most common adverse drug reactions (≥ 20%) of VITRAKVI in order of decreasing frequency were 
fatigue (32%), increased ALT (31%), dizziness (30%), increased AST (29%), constipation (29%), nausea 
(26%), anaemia (24%), and vomiting (20%). 
A total of 34% of patients in the Overall Safety Analysis set experienced at least one SAE during treatment 
with similar results for the NTRK gene fusion analysis set (28%) and the Efficacy-evaluable NTRK gene 
fusion analysis set (33%). Most commonly reported in the Overall Safety Analysis set (aside from disease 
progression which is not regarded as an AE) was pyrexia (3 %), diarrhoea and sepsis (each reported in 2 
%). 
Neurologic reactions including dizziness, gait disturbance and paraesthesia were reported in patients 
receiving larotrectinib. For the majority of neurologic reactions, onset occurred within the first three 
months of treatment. Withholding, reducing, or discontinuing larotrectinib dosing should be considered, 
depending on the severity and persistence of these symptoms (see sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC). 
The majority of ALT and AST increases occurred in the first 3 months of treatment. Liver function 
including ALT and AST assessments should be monitored before the first dose and monthly for the first 
3 months of treatment, then periodically during treatment, with more frequent testing in patients who 
develop transaminase elevations. Withhold or permanently discontinue larotrectinib based on the 
severity. If withheld, modify the larotrectinib dose when resumed (see section 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Ninety eight (98) % of the adult population treated with the recommended dose of larotrectinib in the 
Overall Safety Set (N=152), had any TEAEs with Fatigue (38 %), Dizziness (37 %), Nausea (30 %) and 
Anaemia (26 %) being the most commonly reported events. AST and ALT elevations were reported in 23 
% and 22 % respectively. Adult patients treated with the recommended dose in the Overall NTRK Fusion 
Cancers Safety Set (N=90) shows a similar pattern with Dizziness (41 %) followed by Fatigue (38 %), 
Nausea (30 %) and Anaemia (24 %). AST and ALT elevations were reported in 26 % and 27 % 
respectively. 
The safety profile in the paediatric population (< 18 years) was consistent in types of reported adverse 
reactions to those observed in the adult population.

Of the paediatric patients treated with the recommended dose in the Overall Safety Set (N=56), 98 % had 
any TEAEs with ALT and AST elevations most commonly reported (38 % and 36 % respectively, followed 
by Vomiting (36 %), Neutrophil decreased (31 %), Constipation (29 %) and Diarrhoea (29 %). For the 
paediatric patients treated with the recommended dose in the Overall NTRK Fusion Cancers Safety Set 
(N=47), similarity is also noted to that of the paediatric Overall safety Set with ALT and AST elevations 
most commonly reported (41 % and 35 % respectively, followed by Vomiting (35 %), Diarrhoea (32 %), 
Neutrophil decreased (30 %), and Constipation (30 %). 
Regarding the paediatric subgroups (the limited number of patients in each age cohort is recognised), in 
the youngest age-group (Infants and Toddlers, N=18), 94 % had any TEAEs with ALT elevations, 
Vomiting and Diarrhoea (61 % each) most commonly reported followed by Pyrexia and Constipation (56 
% each), Neutrophil count decreased (50 %), AST elevations, Cough and Anaemia (44 % each) and 
Fatigue (39 %). For the Children age group (N=23), the corresponding proportions are 96 % with any 
TEAE and most commonly reported are AST and ALT elevations (39 %) each, Vomiting (35 %), Cough, 
Diarrhoea and headache (30 % each). In terms of Adolescents (N=15), all patients reported any TEAE 
with Pain in extremity most commonly reported (40 %), followed by AST elevation, Neutrophil count 
decreased, Nausea and Headache most commonly reported (33 %) ALT elevation, Vomiting and Dizziness 
(27 % each). It is concluded that there are some differences in the safety profile between the paediatric 
age cohorts with more TEAEs reported in the youngest age cohort for e.g. neutropenia, anaemia, pyrexia, 
GI disorders (diarrhoea, vomiting, constipation and nausea) and weight increase as compared to the older 
age cohorts. In terms of the Overall NTRK Fusion Cancers Safety Set (N=47), with a total of 18 patients 
enrolled in the age group of Infants and Toddlers, 20 patients in the Children age group and 9 patients in 
the Adolescents group, the pattern and proportions of reported PTs are similar to that of the Paediatric 
Subgroup Overall Safety Set above.  
In terms of fatal events and based on the initial data cut-off date of 19 February 2018, 30 deaths were 
reported at any time. A total of 11 patients (6%) experienced TEAEs with a fatal outcome within 30 days 
of receiving larotrectinib in the Overall Safety Analysis set (5 patients in study LOXO-TRK-14001, 4 in 
LOXO-TRK-15002 and 2 in LOXO-TRK-15003). All were attributed to either disease progression (7 
patients) or to a complication of the primary malignancy. None of the cases were considered related to the 
investigational drug. The reasons for deaths that occurred > 30 days after the last dose of study drug 
were disease progression (14 patients) and unknown cause (4 patients).  
Permanent discontinuation of larotrectinib for treatment emergent adverse reactions, regardless of 
attribution occurred in 3% of patients (one case each of ALT increase, AST increase, intestinal perforation, 
jaundice, small intestinal obstruction). The majority of adverse reactions leading to dose reduction 
occurred in the first three months of treatment. 
Most common causes were disease progression and AT/ALT elevations (1 % each). Notably, 5 % 
permanently discontinued in the NTRK Fusion Cancers analysis sets. The reasons leading up to treatment 
discontinuations are more or less all isolated cases with no discernible pattern in terms of reasons for 
discontinuation. Many of them may also be considered as disease related. Moreover, very few patients 
treated at recommended dose discontinued treatment due to adverse events in the Overall Safety set 
(adult and paediatric patients 5 % and 2 % respectively). The majority of adverse reactions leading to 
dose reduction occurred in the first three months of treatment. 
In the concentration-QTc modelling, a shortening of QTcF during treatment with larotrectinib was 
observed, however the clinical relevance of this finding cannot be established. This information is included 
in section 5.1 of the SmPC (see also Clinical Pharmacology discussion).  
The comparison of safety profile between age group is very difficult due to the wide heterogeneity of the 
population in term of tumour histology and prior treatments. The nature of the reported AE seems to be 
consistent between age groups with difference in incidence. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469135/2019  
Page 178/196 
 
 
 
 
The safety profile in elderly patients (≥ 65 years) seems to be consistent with that seen in younger 
patients (< 65 years). An increase in terms of reported serious AEs and hospitalisation with increasing 
age is observed.  Nervous system disorders were more commonly reported in the elderly as compared to 
patients < 65 vs. 65-74. Also fatigue and anaemia were more frequently reported in the older cohort. The 
adverse reactions gait disturbance, and blood alkaline phosphatase increased were more frequent in 
patients of 65 years or older. 
There are no data from the use of larotrectinib in pregnant women. The use of larotrectinib should be 
avoided during pregnancy. Women of reproductive potential should be advised to use highly effective 
contraception during treatment with larotrectinib and for at least one month after the final dose (see 2.3 
Non-clinical aspects and section 4.6 of the SmPC). 
It is unknown whether larotrectinib/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the 
newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with 
larotrectinib and for 3 days following the final dose. 
Larotrectinib may have a moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness and 
fatigue have been reported in patients receiving larotrectinib, mostly Grade 1 and 2 during the first 3 
months of treatment. This may influence the ability to drive and use machines during this time period. 
Patients should be advised not to drive and use machines, until they are reasonably certain larotrectinib 
therapy does not affect them adversely (see section 4.7 of the SmPC). 
There is limited experience of overdose with larotrectinib. Symptoms of overdose are not established. In 
the event of overdose, physicians should follow general supportive measures and treat symptomatically. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics 
Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA 
There are concerns regarding the potential long-term toxicity and developmental effects of larotrectinib in 
paediatric patients. The MAH should submit the final report of study LOXO-TRK-15003 (SCOUT) with 
particular focus on neurodevelopment including cognitive function. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
From an overall safety perspective (adult patients and paediatric patients), larotrectinib appears 
reasonably tolerable and the toxicity is considered to be manageable with appropriate risk minimization 
measures as evidenced by the low treatment discontinuation rate. The long-term safety profile of 
larotrectinib will be further characterized in the post-marketing setting through registry and a 
non-intervention post authorisation safety study (see RMP). 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the context 
of a CMA: 
- In order to further investigate the long-term toxicity and developmental effects of larotrectinib in 
paediatric patients, with particular focus on neurodevelopment including cognitive function, the MAH 
should submit the final report of study LOXO-TRK-15003 (SCOUT) including 5 year follow up data.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.9.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle 
with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 26 November 2018. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.10.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that larotrectinib has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in the 
European Union.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers larotrectinib to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.11.  Product information 
2.11.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.11.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, VITRAKVI (larotrectinib) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as: 
- It contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal 
product authorised in the EU; 
- It is approved under a conditional marketing authorisation [REG Art 14-a]. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The indication is independent of tumour type/histology - as follows:  
“VITRAKVI as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with solid 
tumours that display a Neurotrophic Tyrosine Receptor Kinase (NTRK) gene fusion, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469135/2019  
Page 185/196 
 
 
 
 
-  who have a disease that is locally advanced, metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to 
result in severe morbidity, and 
-  who have no satisfactory treatment options (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).” 
NTRK gene fusions have been identified at low frequencies in a wide range of commonly occurring 
tumours, such as lung cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, thyroid cancer, sarcoma and others. In 
very rare tumours, such as infantile fibrosarcoma (IFS), secretory/juvenile breast cancer, and mammary 
analogue secretory cancer of the salivary glands (MASC), however, NTRK gene fusions are the defining 
genetic feature occurring in most or all cases. 
The purpose of treatment in this disease setting is to reduce symptoms of disease, and to prolong 
survival. It is not excluded that patients with locally advanced disease might become operable and 
potentially cured, however. 
The additional indication “or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity” concern 
patients who have a life-threatening malignant disease although presently in a potentially curable stage. 
They are presently surgically curable but at the cost of mutilating surgery affecting function of body parts. 
The prognostic significance of NTRK fusion and its influence on a tumour’s sensitivity to classical 
treatments is not known for the time being.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Currently there are no EU approved specific targeted therapies for patients with NTRK fusion-positive 
cancer and there are no European national consensus guidelines or literature references with 
recommendations for the clinical management of such patients, who are clinically managed based on care 
standards for the tumour site of origin. However, following the approval of larotrectinib in the US, 
larotrectinib has been included in the American National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) clinical 
practice guidelines for common cancer types such as colon cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and 
melanoma. 
In the EU, initial treatments generally include surgery and radiotherapy; and radioactive iodine for thyroid 
cancers. Systemic therapy options (including chemotherapy and treatment with biologics) are then 
considered. Some of the conditions encompassed by the indication are rare and generally associated with 
NTRK fusions, and without any satisfactory therapeutic options (e.g., salivary gland cancer of the MASC 
type). In other cases, the NTRK fusion-positive cancers constitute a small subgroup of a more common 
condition (e.g., colorectal cancer), for which several lines of treatment exist that have a documented 
clinical benefit in the overall disease population.  
This application concerns a disease setting where there is no available therapy that is likely to have a 
positive B/R balance for the patient, or patients who only have a chance at cure at the cost of mutilating 
surgery. This is a population with a high unmet medical need. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The efficacy of larotrectinib is based on preliminary data from three currently ongoing trials:  
•  Study 14001 (LOXO-TRK-14001) is a dose-finding Phase 1/2 trial in adults with advanced solid 
tumours with or without NTRK gene fusions  
•  Study 15003 (LOXO-TRK-15003) is a dose-finding Phase 1/2 trial in paediatric patients with 
advanced solid tumours or primary CNS malignancies with or without NTRK gene fusions  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469135/2019  
Page 186/196 
 
 
 
 
•  Study 15002 (LOXO-TRK-15002) is a Phase 2 basket trial in adolescent and adult patients with 
NTRK fusions  
Interim data from these three studies were pooled together into a main efficacy analysis set denoted “the 
extended primary analysis set 2” (ePAS2). This is based on a third interim analysis with data cut-off date 
30 July 2018, whereas the initial pooled analysis set (used for initial FDA New Drug Application) was 
named the PAS (data cut-off 17 July 2017).  
The ePAS2 consists of patients from the 3 studies who met the criteria:  
•  Documented NTRK gene fusion (with exception for Infantile fibrosarcoma where NTRK fusion is a 
known feature of the disease; all patients had NTRK fusion, at least inferred, however) 
•  Non-CNS primary tumour 
•  At least 1 measurable lesion at baseline as assessed by RECIST v1.1  
•  Received at least 1 dose of larotrectinib 
The primary endpoint for the pooled data analysis was objective response rate (ORR) by independent 
review committee (IRC). The pooled populations therefore also required sufficient follow-up for IRC, 
defined as at least 6 month’s follow-up or discontinuation. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Results in the ePAS2 
The main efficacy analysis set is the pooled ePAS2, which consists of 93 patients. At the time of data 
cut-off 57% have treatment ongoing and 31% have experienced disease progression. The median time 
on treatment is 12.1 months, 14 patients (15%) have died, and 34 patients (37%) have had a PFS-event 
(death or disease progression).  
The ORR by IRC was 72% (n=67/93, 95% CI: 62, 81%), and ORR by investigator assessment (INV) was 
80%. The agreement rate between IRC and INV assessments was 90%. 
The median change in target tumour lesions sizes was a decrease of 66%. 
The time to response (TTR) median was 1.8 months by IRC and INV (IRC 25th, 75th percentiles: 1.71, 
1.94 months). A vast majority of responding patients did so at the first tumour evaluation.  
The duration of response (DoR) median was not reached by IRC or INV; of the 67 responding patients 47 
(70%) were still in response at the time of analysis (IRC). 72% of responding patients had a tumour 
response that lasted 6 months or more, and 44% 12 months or more.  
The progression-free survival (PFS) event-rate was 37% (IRC) and 38% (INV) in the ePAS2, and the 
median was 27.4 months (95% CI: 13.8, NE) by IRC and 28.3 months (95% CI: 15.2, NE) by investigator 
assessments. The PFS rate at 6 months was 77%, and the PFS rate at 12 months was 64% (95% CI: 51, 
76%) by IRC.  
The overall survival (OS) event-rate was 15% and the median was consequently not reached. The OS 
median follow-up time was 16.7 months (25th, 75th percentiles: 9.3, 23.0 months). The OS rate at 12 
months was 88% (95% CI: 81, 95%).  
Subgroup analyses 
The ORR (IRC) was 68% (95% CI: 55, 79%) for patients with age ≥ 18 years (n=65); and 82% (95% CI: 
63, 94%) for patients with age < 18 years (n= 28). Patients aged ≥ 65 years (n=15) had a response rate 
of 56% (95% CI: 31, 78%). It should be noted that age groups co-vary with tumour type.  
Assessment report

The ORRs per NTRK fusion type was 63% (95% CI: 47, 78%) for NTRK1 (n=41), 33% (95% CI: 1, 91%) 
for NTRK2 (n=3), and 82% (95% CI: 68, 91%) for NTRK3 (n=49). Note the wide confidence intervals.  
The observed objective responses rates were highly variable across the studied tumour types, from 0% 
ORR in single patients with breast cancer, cholangiocarcinoma and pancreatic cancer to 100% in the 4 
patients with GIST tumours. 
Among 9 patients with primary CNS tumours who were excluded from the ePAS2 based on tumour type, 
but fulfilled the other criteria, 1 had an objective response (PR by INV). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Clinical aspects 
Due to the limited efficacy data base, the extent to which tissue of tumour origin or concomitant genetic 
alterations impact efficacy is in need of further clarification.  
Mechanisms for primary and secondary resistance mechanisms to larotrectinib have been addressed in 
the SmPC, and will be further investigated in the post-authorisation setting as part of the CMA conditions. 
The application is considered lacking in prospectively studied cohorts that could provide an unbiased 
estimate of ORR. The uncertainty about the magnitude of the effect estimate due to these circumstances 
is of importance with respect to SmPC claims, and further strengthens the case for the 
non-comprehensiveness of available data. A prospective cohort is required to produce an unbiased 
estimate of efficacy.  
The non-randomised design further hampers the assessment of particularly the time-dependent 
outcomes. The small efficacy data base raises issues with regard to the representativeness in relation to 
the indication sought, encompassing any solid tumour type. This aspect will be to some extent addressed 
during the post-marketing study and external controls. This uncertainty is stated in the SmPC (see 
section 4.4) 
Due to the small sample size, the confidence intervals are generally wide, making efficacy estimates 
generally imprecise and hampering the possibility to draw conclusions regarding efficacy in subgroups, 
e.g. with regard to age groups and gene fusion type. This aspect will be addressed by the post-marketing 
study (see Annex II and RMP). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
By System Organ Class (SOC) in the Overall safety set (N=208), TEAEs were most commonly reported in 
the SOCs of Gastrointestinal disorders (70 % [Nausea 28 %]), General disorders and administration site 
conditions (63 % [Fatigue 36 %]), Nervous system disorders (62 % [Dizziness 29 %]), Musculoskeletal 
and connective tissue disorders (51 % [Myalgia 16 %]), Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal disorders 
(51 % [Cough 26 %]), Metabolism and Nutrition disorders (50 % Decreased [appetite 13 %]), 
Investigations (48 % [AST and ALT increase 26 % each]), Infection and infestation (43 %), and Blood and 
lymphatic system disorders (41 % [Anaemia 26 %]). Similar proportions were observed in the Overall 
NTRK Fusion Cancers set. 
By Preferred Term (PT), most commonly reported were Fatigue (36 %), Dizziness (29 %), Nausea (28 
%), Constipation (27 %), ALT increase, Anaemia, AST increase and Cough (26 % each), Vomiting (24 
%9, Diarrhoea (23 %) and Pyrexia (18 %). No relevant change was observed in the Overall NTRK Fusion 
Cancers set. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469135/2019  
Page 188/196 
 
 
 
 
Grade 3 were reported in 82 patients (39 %) and grade 4 in 13 patients (6%) in the Overall safety set. The 
corresponding proportions for the Efficacy-eval NTRK Fusion cancer set and the Overall NTRK Fusion 
Cancers Safety set are similar.  
A total of 34 % in the Overall Safety Analysis set experienced at least one SAE during treatment with 
similar results for the NTRK gene fusion analysis set (28 %) and the Efficacy-evaluable NTRK gene fusion 
analysis set (33 %). Most commonly reported in the Overall Safety Analysis set (aside from disease 
progression which is not regarded as an AE) was pyrexia (3 %), diarrhoea and sepsis (each reported in 2 
%). 
Neurologic reactions including dizziness, gait disturbance and paraesthesia were reported in patients 
receiving larotrectinib. For the majority of neurologic reactions, onset occurred within the first three 
months of treatment. Withholding, reducing, or discontinuing larotrectinib dosing should be considered, 
depending on the severity and persistence of these symptoms (see section 4.4 of the SmPC). 
The majority of ALT and AST increases occurred in the first 3 months of treatment (see section 4.2 and 4.4 
of the SmPC). 
In terms of safety profiles between adults and the paediatric population, a difference is observed. Whilst 
the adult population treated with the recommended dose in the Overall Safety Set were most commonly 
reported for Fatigue (38 %), Dizziness (37 %), Nausea (30 %) and Anaemia (26 %), the paediatric 
patients treated with the recommended dose had ALT and AST elevations most commonly reported (38 % 
and 36 % respectively, followed by Vomiting (36 %), Neutrophil decreased (31 %), Constipation (29 %) 
and Diarrhoea (29 %).   
There are also some differences in safety profiles between the paediatric age-groups (the limited number 
of patients in each age cohort is recognised). There are more TEAEs reported in the youngest age cohort 
for e.g. neutropenia, anaemia, pyrexia, GI disorders (diarrhoea, vomiting, constipation and nausea) and 
weight increase as compared to the older age cohorts. In the youngest age-group (Infants and Toddlers, 
N=18), 94 % had any TEAEs with ALT elevations, Vomiting and Diarrhoea (61 % each) most commonly 
reported followed by Pyrexia and Constipation (56 % each), Neutrophil count decreased (50 %), AST 
elevations, Cough and Anaemia (44 % each) and Fatigue (39 %). For the Children age group (N=23), the 
corresponding proportions are 96 % with any TEAE and most commonly reported are AST and ALT 
elevations (39 %) each, Vomiting (35 %), Cough, Diarrhoea and headache (30 % each). In terms of 
Adolescents (N=15), all patients reported any TEAE with Pain in extremity most commonly reported (40 
%), followed by AST elevation, Neutrophil count decreased, Nausea and Headache most commonly 
reported (33 %) ALT elevation, Vomiting and Dizziness (27 % each).  
Overall the vast majority of patients needed dose modifications (≥ 80 %). Dose reductions were needed 
for 15 % of the patients in the Overall Safety Analysis Set however dose reductions due to AEs were 
infrequent with a low proportion of 9 %.  
TEAE leading to treatment discontinuation were reported in 11 % in the Overall Safety Analysis set which 
is deemed within in an acceptable range for an oncology study and raises no concern. Most common 
causes were disease progression and AT/ALT elevations (1 % each). Notably, 5 % permanently 
discontinued in the NTRK Fusion Cancers analysis sets.  
None of the cases of 30 fatal events were considered related to the investigational drug. The reasons for 
deaths that occurred > 30 days after the last dose of study drug were disease progression (14 patients) 
and unknown cause (4 patients).

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Overall the level of pharmacodynamic activity seen is impressive. Activity may be lower in certain tumour 
types, albeit still highly clinically relevant in the treatment setting defined by the indication. Furthermore, 
concomitant genetic alterations may theoretically impact the level of activity.  Notwithstanding this, the 
explorative and adaptive nature of the study program, the immaturity of DoR data, the single arm nature 
of the studies, as well as the limitations of the data with respect to understanding the extent that tissue 
origin might act as an effect modifier, available data are considered non-comprehensive. Therefore, a 
Conditional Marketing Authorisation rather than a full MA is relevant. 
Furthermore, the paediatric indication is acceptable in the setting of a CMA, given that the applicant 
commits to provide further data on paediatric exposure post approval.  
The overall toxicity of larotrectinib appears manageable with appropriate risk minimisation measures as 
recommended in the SmPC. The safety profile is thus not considered to negatively impact the B/R balance 
of larotrectinib. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
This is the first contemporary example of a sought indication that is tumour type independent; therefore, 
the regulatory evaluation will set a precedent with regards to the evaluation of such applications. 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available, a conditional marketing authorisation was 
proposed by the CHMP during the assessment, after having consulted the applicant. 
Conditional marketing authorisation and the key specific obligation 
Due to the small sample size of the presented data, comprehensive data on the product are not available; 
uncertainties remain on the precise estimates of efficacy based on a larger sample size in terms of 
objective response rate and response duration, and long term endpoints (OS, PFS); therefore, a 
conditional marketing authorisation is considered appropriate.  
The product falls within the scope of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 concerning conditional 
marketing authorisations, as it aims at the treatment of a seriously debilitating, life-threatening disease 
where there is an unmet medical need.  
Furthermore, the CHMP considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
authorisation: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive, as discussed. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. 
The main areas of non-comprehensive data are: 
Efficacy:  
- The benefit in subgroups of patients based on histology. This may be studied in terms of ORR and 
DoR in prospective single-arm studies encompassing a broad variety of tumour types. 
- The requirement for unbiased estimate of ORR and DoR. This may be studied in a prospective 
cohort study. 
- The size of treatment benefit on time-dependent outcome measures (OS, PFS); 
- Resistance mechanisms and the role of concomitant oncogenic drivers to further characterise 
efficacy in different subgroups.

Safety: The size of the safety data base is limited, particularly given that this is a first-in-class 
pharmacological agent. Furthermore, the long-term safety follow-up is limited. Neurodevelopment in 
paediatric patients is a concern based on preclinical data. Finally, more pharmacokinetic data should be 
generated in small children, where drug exposure at the recommended doses may be higher than in the 
adults, to allow a reappraisal of the appropriate dose. 
In order to fulfil a comprehensive data package, the Applicant as part of study LOXO-TRK-15002 
(NAVIGATE) will submit a prospective cohort of 75 patients, for which at least 1 year of follow-up is 
available, and will perform an overall pooled analysis where the target population includes the 
ePAS2/SAS3 cohort (with the updated data) along with the prospective cohort, which would give 
increased precision of the estimates for the ORR and DoR.  
This interventional single arm cohort has several overlapping aims. First, there is a need for a traditional 
corroboration of ORR in the target population in the light of a pivotal dataset emerging from several 
exploratory studies based on data-driven decisions, which may have led to an inflated ORR estimate. 
Furthermore, there is a need to provide a more precise estimate of efficacy in common cancers where 
NTRK fusions are rare, based on lower available efficacy estimates in such patients compared to those 
seen in rare cancers where NTRK-fusions are common or pathognomonic.  
On this basis, specific sub-cohorts of patients with lung cancer, colorectal cancer, melanoma and 
non-secretory breast cancer have been agreed. Concomitant with such goals, there are also aspects 
related to uncertainties in the overall assumption that the presence of NTRK-fusions in a given histology 
is a predictor that larotrectinib will have activity. The underlying concern here is that the relationship 
between biomarker and response may be abolished by tissue-specific bypass mechanisms. From this 
perspective, the goal of the study would be to identify any “outlying” histologies that may exist.  
For this purpose, the applicant has committed to enrol 200 additional patients(75 already enrolled) in 
NAVIGATE (LOXO-TRK-15002) and as part of the SCOUT study (LOXO-TRK-15003) within a 36 month 
period post approval. Eighty patients will be recruited in the common tumour types and 120 in the other 
tumour types. The applicant will discuss with the Agency whether enrolment should continue. The 
applicant will submit a pooled analysis together with the results of the prospective data in isolation. 
The applicant will enrol at least 9 and up to 20 patients in total in each of the identified common tumour 
type subgroups (lung, melanoma, colorectal cancer, non-secretory breast), and pre-specifies rules for 
conclusions of adequate/inadequate clinical activity. 
Furthermore, the applicant is proposing that the relevance of clinical efficacy in a given histology would be 
subject to review in case of no responses in 9 patients. If that occurs in the prospective cohort, the 
applicant should alert the Agency. In order to decide whether “inadequate response” has been identified 
in certain tumour types, the applicant will follow a Bayesian approach as a methodological rule and 
conventional approach. The applicant will inform the Agency if the criteria of “inadequate response” 
according to the Bayesian approach is fulfilled for any particular histology. 
The data submitted as part of this specific obligation will refine the understanding of the B/R in certain 
subpopulations. 
The SCOUT study (15003) will be amended to allow investigation of the long-term toxicity and 
developmental effects of larotrectinib in paediatric patients, with particular focus on neurodevelopment 
including cognitive function, using established instruments. In addition, monitoring and investigator 
support in the ongoing non-investigational study (NIS) will be increased to ensure high quality data on 
efficacy and safety.

Finally in order to further confirm the appropriate dose recommended in paediatric patients, the MAH has 
committed to submit an updated pop PK model based on additional PK sampling in patients aged 1 month 
to 6 years from study LOXO-TRK-15003 (SCOUT).

• 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as given the qualification of the indication to patients that 
have no remaining satisfactory treatment options, it is ascertained that a major therapeutic 
advantage over available therapies has been shown.  
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that 
additional data are still required. The intended indication will provide patients with no satisfactory 
treatment options available, an alternative which has shown outstanding ORR along with clinically 
meaningful DoR sufficient to demonstrate clinical benefit. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Vitrakvi in the indication: 
“VITRAKVI as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with solid 
tumours that display a Neurotrophic Tyrosine Receptor Kinase (NTRK) gene fusion, 
- 
who have a disease that is locally advanced, metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to 
result in severe morbidity, and 
- 
who have no satisfactory treatment options (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). “ 
 is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that larotrectinib is not similar to Onivyde, Rubraca, Nexavar, 
Yondelis, Cometriq, Bavencio, Lutathera, Zejula, Qarziba, Lartruvo and Mepact within the meaning of 
Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of VITRAKVI is favourable in the following indication: 
VITRAKVI as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with solid 
tumours that display a Neurotrophic Tyrosine Receptor Kinase (NTRK) gene fusion, 
- 
who have a disease that is locally advanced, metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to 
result in severe morbidity, and 
- 
who have no satisfactory treatment options (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).

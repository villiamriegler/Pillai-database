1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The  applicant  CTI  Life  Sciences  Ltd.  submitted  on  28  October  2010  an  application  for  Marketing 
Authorisation  to  the  European  Medicines  Agency  (EMA)  for  Pixuvri,  through the  centralised  procedure 
falling  within  the  Article  3(1)  and  point  3  of  Annex  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004.  The  eligibility  to 
the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 27 July 2009. 
The applicant applied for the indication in the treatment of adult patients with multiply relapsed or 
refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/242/2010 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP) including a waiver and a deferral. 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP 000713-PIP02-10 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
The application contained a critical report pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and 
Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000, addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products. 
Derogation(s) of market exclusivity 
Not applicable. 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
In accordance with Article 3 (1) of Regulation EC No 507/2006, the applicant requested the application 
to be considered for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation based on the following claim(s): 
 
The risk-benefit balance of the medicinal product, as defined in Article 1(28a) of Directive 
2001/83/EC, is positive. 
Based  on  the  randomized  controlled  study  presented  in  patients  with  multiply  relapsed  or  refractory 
aggressive  NHL  (study  PIX  301),  the  superiority  of  pixuvri  was  demonstrated  compared  to  single 
chemotherapy  agent  with  an  increase  in  the  Cr/CRu  (20%  versus  5.7%;  p=0.02),  an  increase  in 
median PFS (HR=0.60, 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.86, p=0.005) and a superior overall survival (median 10.2 
Pixuvri 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev10.11 
Page 7/85
 
 
 
 
months versus 7.6 months; HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.53, 1.18, p=0.25) The benefit risk balance of pixuvri in 
patients with multiply relapsed or refractory aggressive NHL is therefore considered to be positive. 
From  a  quantitative  point,  of  view,  the  benefit  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  previously  treated  with 
rituximab  might  be  less  as  compared  with  what  was  observed  in  patients  that  had  not  received  prior 
rituximab  treatment.  However,  the  efficacy  of  Pixuvri  in  patients  that  had  received  prior  rituximab 
therapy and up to 3 prior regimens was still superior to the comparator. In Europe most patients that 
had  multiple  relapse  or  are  refractory  to  treatments  are  expected  to  have  received  prior  rituximab. 
Therefore there is a need to further confirm the efficacy of Pixuvri in patients previously treated with 
rituximab.  
 
It is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide comprehensive clinical data. 
The applicant claimed that it is likely to be in a position to provide the comprehensive clinical data from 
Phase III study PIX 306 where pixantrone in combination with rituximab is compared with gemcitabine 
in combination with rituximab. The study patient population includes patients with the NHL type of 
Diffuse Large B cell Lymphoma or Follicular grade III lymphoma who had previously been treated with 
at least one rituximab containing multiagent regimen. This study will support the efficacy of pixuvri in 
patients that had received prior rituximab of the phase III Study PIX 301. The results from study PIX 
306 are expected to be available by 30 June 2015. 
  Unmet medical needs to be fulfilled. 
The applicant claims that there is a lack of approved and standard of care pharmacological treatment 
for patients with multiply relapsed or refractory aggressive NHL and that there is a need in this patient 
population that could be fulfilled with the proposed medicinal product. 
 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product 
concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. 
The applicant claimed that the potential risks inherent in marketing pixuvri for the specific indication, 
while additional, more comprehensive data will be available in the future, would be offset by the 
potential benefit to the patients. The RMP for pixuvri in the approved indication is considered as 
adequate to address any identified and unknown risks.  
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance pixantrone dimaleate contained in the above medicinal 
product to be considered as a new active substance in itself. 
Scientific Advice 
The applicant received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on 18 October 2002. The Scientific Advice 
pertained to clinical aspects of the dossier.  
Licensing status 
A new application was filed in the following countries: United States of America. 
The product was not licensed in any country at the time of submission of the application.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
In 2008, 73,667 men and women in the European Union were diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma 
(NHL), and more than 31,000 died of the disease. It occurs mainly in white populations in parts of 
Western Europe, North America and Australia. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most 
common aggressive NHL, constituting approximately ≥30% of all NHL. The crude incidence in the EU is 
5-6/100,000/year, increasing with age from 0.3/100,000/year in 35-39 year-olds to 
26.6/100,000/year in the 80 to 84 age group. Overall, > 30% of DLBCL patients will ultimately 
relapse. The incidence of relapsed NHL in the EU is therefore estimated to be around 1/100,000/year.  
Aggressive NHLs are potentially curable malignant disorders. Anthracyclines are one of the most active 
drug classes in Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas (NHL), but the likelihood of cardiotoxicity rises as the 
cumulative dose increases.  
Pixuvri 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev10.11

The established first-line chemotherapy regimens typically include cyclophosphamide, anthracycline 
(doxorubicin), vincristine and corticosteroids (CHOP). The addition of rituximab has further improved 
response rates and survival in certain lymphoma entities (Coiffier et al.2002, N Eng J Med 346; 
Pfreundschuh et al. 2006, Lancet Oncology 7). Nevertheless, about 20 to 50% of patients either fail to 
respond (primary refractory disease) to front-line treatment or have relapsing disease.  
In DLCBL suitable patients with adequate performance status (no major organ dysfunction, age < 65 
to 70 years) a salvage regimen followed in responsive patients by high-dose treatment with stem-cell 
support is recommended. Patients not suitable for high-dose therapy may be treated with similar or 
other salvage regimens which may be combined with involved-field radiotherapy, but no salvage 
chemotherapy for aggressive lymphoma is considered standard. Rituximab alone induced responses in 
30-35% of patients with relapsed or primary refractory DLBCL; but the CR rate was only 9%. The 
majority of regimens utilized beyond the front-line treatment setting do not incorporate an 
anthracycline or anthracenedione because of the risk for cardiac toxicity associated with an increasing 
cumulative lifetime anthracycline dose: by the time of first relapse, most patients have received 300 to 
400 mg/m2 of doxorubicin-equivalent cumulative dose, and thus are already near the recommended 
lifetime limit of 450-550 mg/m2.  The European Society of Medical Oncology makes no 
recommendations for therapy in patients who relapse after, or fail to respond to, second line therapy. 
The currently used conventional-dose programs for relapsed NHL are associated with a very low rate of 
response in patients with primary refractory disease, and there is no standard therapy for these 
patients. 
In conclusion, there is no consensus regarding the best regimen for aggressive NHL beyond first 
relapse in patients not eligible for stem cell transplant or in disease refractory to second-line therapy, 
and no single agent or regimen is approved or considered standard of care in this setting. 
About the product 
Pixantrone is an aza-anthracenedione compound related to anthracyclines and anthracenediones such 
as doxorubicin and mitoxantrone, classes of drugs whose antineoplastic activity is linked to inhibition of 
topoisomerase II and DNA intercalation.  
The proposed indication of Pixuvri is the treatment as monotherapy of adult patients with multiply 
relapsed or refractory aggressive NHL.  
The approved indication of Pixuvri is the treatment in monotherapy of adult patients with multiply 
relapsed or refractory aggressive Non Hodgkin B cell Lymphomas (NHL). The benefit of pixantrone 
treatment has not been established in patients when used as fifth line or greater chemotherapy in 
patients who are refractory to last therapy. 
Pixuvri is supplied in vials containing 29 mg pixantrone (as dimaleate) powder for concentrate for 
solution for infusion. It is reconstituted with 5 ml of sodium chloride and further diluted in 250ml-500 
ml sodium chloride. It is administered at 50 mg/m2 by slow intravenous (IV) infusion over a minimum 
of 1 hour on Days 1, 8, and 15 of 28-day cycles for up to 6 cycles. 
The development programme/Compliance with CHMP Guidance/Scientific 
Advice 
The Applicant received EMA Scientific Advice (EMEA/CPMP/5115/02) in October 2002. 
Pixuvri 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev10.11 
Page 10/85
 
 
 
 
 
The CHMP scientific advice included the design of the AZA III-01 protocol, at that time planned as a 
phase III protocol proposed to support the Aggressive NHL indication. It was proposed as an open-
label, randomized, Phase III comparative trial in which pixantrone substituted etoposide in the 
Etoposide, Methylprednisolone, Cytarabine and Cisplatin (ESHAP) chemotherapy regimen. Response 
rate was not well received as an endpoint and not considered a validated surrogate for the proposed 
design at the time. Alternate designs were suggested by the CHMP such as using a very clearly defined 
autologous stem cell setting, in particular similar high dose chemotherapy regimen (e.g. ‘BEAM’ 
procedure) and patient management for all patients following transplantation, and define time to 
progression as (co-)primary endpoint. Another suggestion was to perform a comparative study in 
parallel in another population of patients not eligible for ABMT/PBSCT, where duration of remission and 
time to progression could be observed and be related to safety issues. The CHMP emphasized the 
importance of follow-up data including overall survival and the occurrence of second malignancies, 
such as AML.  
Based on the recommendations received, the Applicant modified the design of its Phase III clinical trial 
(PIX301 study). The latter was a randomized, active-control, multicenter, open-label study comparing 
single-agent treatment with pixantrone to other pre-specified single-agents (based on the physician’s 
choice) in patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive NHL who had received two or more lines of 
therapy.  
The main modifications were with regard to: 
 
 
The choice of the primary endpoints (CR/CRu) 
Trial performed in a non transplant setting 
  Stratification (addressing national scientific advice concern) 
The completed clinical development includes seven single-agent and five multiagent combination 
studies which have treated a total of 348 patients with pixantrone; 80% of these patients had NHL. 
This application is supported by a single pivotal trial (PIX-301). 
The applicant also initiated a supportive phase II study (PIX-203) in patients with DLCBL comparing 
the response of CHOP-R (Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, Prednisone plus Rituximab) 
versus CPOP-R (Cyclophosphamide, Pixantrone, Vincristine, Prednisone plus Rituximab). Enrolment 
was terminated in 2008 and the study report was submitted as part of the day 120 responses.  
A paediatric investigation plan has been agreed for pixantrone in combination therapy for the 
treatment of NHL in paediatric patients aged 6 months to <18 years. A waiver has been granted for 
infants < 6 months. Deferral of initiation of the paediatric clinical studies until a positive risk-benefit 
balance in adults is confirmed by the CHMP was also granted.  
Pixantrone has not been approved in any country.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Pixuvri is presented as a dark blue sterile powder for concentrate for solution for infusion containing 29 
mg  of  the  active  substance  pixantrone  (as  dimaleate)  in  a  20  ml  glass  vial.  Other  ingredients  are 
defined  in  section  6.1  of  the  SmPC.  Reconstitution  with  5  ml  9  mg/ml  sodium  chloride  solution  for 
Pixuvri 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev10.11

injection  yields  an  opaque  dark  blue  solution  containing  5.8  mg/ml  pixantrone.  The  formulation 
contains no preservatives and is intended for single use. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Pixuvri  contains  as  active  substance  50  mg  pixantrone  dimaleate  equivalent  to  29mg  pixantrone  free 
base. The International Nonproprietary Name (INN) is pixantrone. The chemical name is 6, 9-bis [(2-
aminoethyl)  amino]  benzo[g]isoquinoline-5,  10-dione  dimaleate  salt.  The  structural  formula  of  the 
dimaleate is: 
The molecular formula is C17H 19N5O2.2C 4H 4O4. The relative Mol.Wt. is 557.5. Pixantrone appears as a 
dark  blue  powder  and  is  slightly  soluble  in  water  and  propylene  glycol.  It  is  very  slightly  soluble  in 
ethanol,  but  soluble in  0.9%  NaCl  and  acetate  buffer  pH  5.2.  Pixantrone  dimaleate  is  achiral  and  not 
hygroscopic. Polymorphism has not been observed for pixantrone dimaleate. 
Manufacture 
At  the  time  of  the  CHMP  opinion,  the  active  substance  used  for  Pixuvri  is  supplied  by  one  active 
substance  manufacturer.  Because  no  Ph.Eur.  certificate  of  suitability  has  been  issued  for  the  active 
substance  manufactured  by  the  proposed  supplier,  detailed  information  about  the  manufacturing 
process, control of starting materials, reagents and solvents, control of critical steps and intermediates, 
process  development  and  process  validation  of  the  active  substance  has  been  supplied  by  the 
applicant.  The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  three  steps.  All  manufacturing  steps  are  adequately 
described. Adequate in process controls are in place and appropriate specifications have been adopted 
for  the  starting  materials,  solvents  and  reagents.  All  relevant  impurities,  degradation  products  and 
residual  solvents  have  been  appropriately  characterized.  The  applicant  confirmed  the  structure  of 
pixantrone  dimaleate  by UV  and  IR  spectroscopy, NMR,  ESI-MS  and  elemental  analysis.  The  physico-
chemical properties where characterised by solubility studies, DSC analysis, TGA analysis and dynamic 
vapour sorption (DVS) analysis. The absence of polymorphs was confirmed with XRPD spectra. 
Specification 
Pixantrone dimaleate is not described in the European Pharmacopoeia. The active substance is tested 
as per in-house specifications and include tests as: appearance, identification (IR), assay and related 
substances (HPLC), maleic acid content and identification, residual 1,4-difluorobenzene, residual 
fluoride content, residue on ignition (Ph.Eur.), heavy metals (Ph.Eur.), residual solvents, water content 
(Ph.Eur.), pH of a 0.4% w/v solution (Ph.Eur.) and bacterial endotoxins (Ph.Eur.).The specifications 
and tests proposed by the applicant comply with the relevant ICH guidelines and general requirements 
Pixuvri 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev10.11

of Ph.Eur. The specifications are adequate to control the quality of the active substance. The impurity 
limits are acceptable and there is no concern from the point of view of safety.  
Batch analysis data have been provided on four batches. All batches were in compliance with the 
predefined active substance specifications and confirm consistency and uniformity of the active 
substance manufacture. 
Stability 
Pixantrone powder is stored in amber glass bottles with low density polyethylene (LDPE) stoppers with 
a polypropylene screw cap. The packaging complies with the Ph.Eur. requirements and the stoppers 
are compliant with EU directive (2002/72/EC) requirements for plastic materials in contact with food 
products and medicinal packaging. Specifications, testing methods, a technical drawing and certificates 
of analysis have been provided for the packaging. 
Stability studies on the active substance have been performed at long term (25±2°C/60±5% RH) and 
accelerated (40±2°C/75±5% RH) conditions on four batches as per ICH Guidelines. Up to 18 months 
of long term stability data, and up to 6 months of accelerated stability data has been provided, 
confirming the stability of the active substance. The specifications tested were appearance, assay, 
related substances, maleic acid content, water content and bacterial endotoxins. The analytical 
methods used are the same as those used for the specifications. The HPLC method used for assay and 
related substances demonstrated to be stability indicating. The packaging used in stability trials is 
identical to that proposed for storage and distribution.  
In conclusion, the stability data provided, support the proposed retest period at the proposed 
packaging and storage conditions.  
2.2.3.   Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
Development  studies  demonstrated  that  an  aqueous  solution  of  pixantrone  did  not  exhibit  adequate 
stability. Hence, a lyophilized formulation was developed, which needs to be reconstituted and diluted 
in an infusion bag prior to administration to the patient.  
Screening  studies  identified  the  excipients  of  choice,  and  the  excipient  concentrations  have  been 
carefully optimized in view of their function. Compatibility studies showed that pixantrone dimaleate is 
compatible  with  all  excipients  used  in  the  final  formulation.  The  selected  formulation  results  in  a 
lyophilized cake with acceptable appearance and reconstitution behaviour. 
Pixuvri should be reconstituted with 5 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection and 
subsequently  diluted  in  an  infusion  bag  containing  0.9%l  NaCl  solution  for  injection.  Upon 
reconstitution with normal saline, an opaque dark blue solution is obtained. Adequate data have been 
provided  to  demonstrate  that  the  lyophilised  powder  is  completely  dissolved  in  60  seconds  with 
agitation. 
Furthermore,  data  have  been  provided  to  demonstrate  24  hour  compatibility  at  uncontrolled  room 
temperature  of  Pixuvri  diluted  at  a  concentration  of  0.3  mg/ml  in  normal  saline  (0.9%  NaCl  for 
injection)  in  commercially  available  infusion  bags  made  of  polyethylene  or  polyvinylchloride.  The 
Pixuvri

diluted medicinal product was also demonstrated to be compatible with commercially available infusion 
set in-line filters made of polyethersulfone, cellulose acetate, and acrylic. 
Pixuvri powder for concentrate for solution for infusion is filled into glass vials with rubber stoppers and 
aluminium  crimp  seals.  The  glass  vial  and  butyl  rubber  stopper  are  specifically  designed  for 
lyophilization  purposes  and  comply  with  the  Ph.Eur.  Adequate  specifications  and  drawings  have  been 
provided  for  the  container  closure  system.  The  vials  and  stoppers  showed  to  be  compatible  with  the 
drug  product  in  both  dry  powder  and  the  reconstituted  state.  A  container  closure  integrity  study 
demonstrated that the closure system is suitable for protection against microbial contamination as well 
as moisture transfer.  
Adventitious agents 
The excipients used in Pixuvri are not of animal origin with the exception of lactose monohydrate, 
which is derived from milk sourced from healthy cows under the same conditions as milk collected for 
human consumption. Hence, lactose monohydrate is compliant with the Note for Guidance on 
Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and 
Veterinary Medicinal Products (EMEA/410/01 Rev. 3). No excipients derived from human origin have 
been used.  
Manufacture of the product 
A detailed description of the manufacturing process and a flow scheme have been provided. Adequate 
in-process controls are performed and the acceptance criteria and the test methods are adequately 
chosen to ensure that the drug product will comply with the specification limits. The applicant has 
presented process validation data on three consecutive full scale validation batches. The validation 
results demonstrated that the manufacturing process for Pixuvri should be capable of consistently 
producing a finished product that meets the predefined finished product release specifications. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include tests for appearance, appearance of 
container/closure system, reconstituted solution (appearance, completeness of reconstitution, visible 
particulates), identification (UV, HPLC), assay and related substances (HPLC), water content (Ph.Eur), 
uniformity of dosage units (Ph.Eur), pH (Ph.Eur.), sterility (Ph.Eur.), bacterial endotoxins (Ph.Eur.), 
particulate matter (Ph.Eur). The finished product specifications are standard for this type of 
presentation. The proposed test procedures and acceptance criteria comply with the requirements of 
the Ph.Eur. and ICH guidelines. All tests included in the specification have been satisfactorily described 
and validated. Appropriate data have been presented to justify the release specifications for each 
quality characteristic that is controlled. Impurities and degradation products have been evaluated and 
found to be acceptable from the point of view of safety. Batch analysis data are provided for three 
batches produced with active substance from the proposed supplier. The batches were manufactured 
at the proposed site, according to the proposed manufacturing process and scale. Batch analysis 
results comply with the predefined specifications and confirm consistency & uniformity of manufacture

Stability of the product 
Stability studies have been carried out under long term (5±3°C) and accelerated (25±2°C/60±5%RH) 
conditions on three batches according to the ICH requirements. The batches were manufactured at 
commercial scale using the proposed active substance and packaged in the container closure system 
proposed for marketing. Up to 24 months long term and up to 6 months accelerated stability data have 
been provided. Long term stability data (up to 42 months at 5°C) and accelerated stability data (6 
months at 25 °C/60%RH) have been presented for three supporting stability batches. 
The parameters tested and analytical methods used are identical to those used for the release 
specifications, except from identification and uniformity of dosage units which were not retested at end 
of shelf-life. The methods used for assay and related substances were proven to be stability indicating. 
The stability results demonstrated that under long term and accelerated conditions no significant 
change on storage was observed for any batch. 
The applicant has also performed a confirmatory photostability study according to ICH Q1B. Sampled 
were exposed to visible and ultraviolet light in primary packing and primary packaging plus secondary 
packaging, placed in an inverted position to maximize light exposure. The results of the study 
demonstrated that the current packaging is sufficient to protect the active substance from light 
exposure. 
Furthermore, the applicant has performed in-use stability studies (up to 24 hours data) on the 
reconstituted and diluted drug product, and a drug product freeze thaw study. The results of the in-use 
stability study indicated that Pixuvri should be used immediately after reconstitution. 
As part of the stability commitment, the applicant committed that at least one batch per year for each 
year the finished product is produced will be placed on a long-term stability program.  
In conclusion, the stability results presented were satisfactory and support the proposed shelf life for 
the commercially packaged product under the conditions specified in the SmPC.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
The marketing authorisation application for Pixuvri, powder for concentrate for solution for infusion, 
contains adequate data to demonstrate the quality of the active substance and finished product. The 
quality of the active substance is adequately controlled and all excipients comply with the Ph.Eur. The 
finished product manufacturing process shows to be capable of consistently producing a finished 
product that meets the finished product specifications, and appropriate packaging is used to ensure the 
product remains stable within the agreed shelf-life.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects  
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and medicinal product 
has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory 
Pixuvri

consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 
The quality of this medicinal product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the 
conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on TSE safety.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were no unresolved quality issues which could have an impact 
on the benefit/risk ratio of the medicinal product.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The  nonclinical  testing  programme  has  evaluated  the  pharmacological  properties  of  BBR  2778 
(pixantrone) in both in vitro and in vivo models; the pharmacokinetics (PK) and/or toxicokinetics (TK) 
of  BBR  2778  in  mice,  rats  and  dogs;  the  tissue  distribution  and  protein  binding  of  BBR  2778;  the 
metabolic  profile,  cytochrome  P450  (CYP450)  inhibition,  CYP450  induction,  and  P-glycoprotein  (P-gp) 
inhibition of BBR 2778; excretion and mass balance of BBR 2778; as well as the toxicological profile of 
BBR  2778  in  mice,  rats  and  dogs;  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  genotoxicity  studies;  teratology  studies  in  rats 
and rabbits; and other toxicity studies (e.g. myelotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, impurities, sudden deaths).  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Brief summary 
The  applicant  conducted  in  vitro  mechanism  of  action  studies,  along  with  in  vitro/in  vivo  cytotoxic 
activity  assays  (including  several  experimental  tumour  models).  The  animal  models  used  for  the 
primary pharmacodynamic endpoint, cytotoxic activity, were considered by the applicant to be relevant 
and  predictive  of  the  antitumour  efficacy  seen  with  BBR  2778  in  human  clinical  trials  for  aggressive 
NHL.  Secondary  pharmacodynamics  were  conducted  based  on  the  immunosuppressor  properties  of 
BBR  2778,  and  stand-alone  safety  pharmacology  studies  were  completed.  Formal  stand-alone 
pharmacodynamic  drug  interaction  studies  were  not  conducted,  but  this  is  not  considered  to  be  a 
major deficiency since several primary pharmacodynamic studies were conducted in combination with 
other anticancer agents.

Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The mechanism of action of BBR 2278 was investigated in cell-free and cell-based studies. The in vitro 
cytotoxicity of BBR 2278 was compared in vitro with other anti-cancer drugs. There were also in vivo 
efficacy studies in tumour models of haematopoietic origin in comparison with other anti-cancer agents 
and in vitro and in vivo efficacy studies in combination with other cytotoxic agents. 
The mechanistic studies show that, similar to mitoxantrone, BBR 2778 binds to DNA in vitro. However, 
the  potency  of  BBR  2778  in  comparison  with  mitoxantrone  is  variable  and  dependent  upon 
experimental conditions (e.g. different ionic strengths, pH conditions).  
The  interaction  of  BBR  2778  with  DNA  and  topoisomerase  II  was  qualitatively  similar  to  that  of 
mitoxantrone, but quantitatively different as shown by the lower amount of DNA single-strand breaks, 
double-strand  breaks,  and  DNA-protein  cross-links  in  L1210  leukemia  cells  in  vitro.  The  in  vitro  cell-
killing  effects  of  BBR  2778  did  not  seem  to  be  solely  related  to  stimulation  of  topoisomerase  II 
mediated DNA cleavage or to formation of DNA breaks, since these were more numerous in S180 than 
in  L1210  leukemia  cells  treated  with  BBR  2778,  yet  the  former  were  less  sensitive  to  BBR  2778  as 
measured  by  cytotoxicity.  The  lack  of  correlation  between  DNA  breaks  and  cytotoxicity  suggests  that 
other  mechanisms  contribute  to  the  cytotoxicity  of  BBR  2778.  Gene  regulation  studies  in  HS-Sultan 
human Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas showed that although the final effects of BBR 2778 and mitoxantrone 
on cell proliferation were qualitatively similar, the immediate effects of BBR 2778 were different.  
The  cytotoxic  activity  of  BBR  2778  in  vitro  was  compared  with  other  anticancer  agents  against  a 
variety of tumour cells. BBR 2778 showed greater cytotoxicity in vitro against tumour cell lines derived 
from haematological tumours than those derived from solid tumours. BBR 2778 was less cytotoxic than 
mitoxantrone and was approximately as cytotoxic as doxorubicin in haematological tumour cells, while 
it had a higher IC50 against solid tumour cells. 
BBR  2778  showed  complete  cross-resistance  with  mitoxantrone  and  doxorubicin  in  one  MDR  over-
expressing cell line (LoVo/DX), and was also cross-resistant with doxorubicin in the MCF7/ADR breast 
cancer cell line. However, it showed only partial cross-resistance with mitoxantrone in the HT29/Mitox, 
a cell line having a specific mechanism of resistance to mitoxantrone not attributable to P-glycoprotein 
or to the MDR gene. 
In  a  tumour  colony  forming  units  (TCFUs)  assay  partial  cross-resistance  with  mitoxantrone  was  also 
observed in 58 human tumours derived from primary tissue culture belonging to 10 tumour types.  No 
resistance for BBR 2778 was observed in in vitro studies in resistant cell lines after a year of BBR 2778 
exposure.  
Although BBR 2778 was not very potent in the in vitro cytotoxicity assays, it demonstrated antitumour 
activity in vivo against multiple tumour models of hematopoietic and solid tumour origin. Overall, the 
data suggest greatest efficacy of BBR 2778 against haematological malignancies, where BBR 2778 was 
superior to mitoxantrone and doxorubicin.  
BBR  2778  had  a  wide  range  of  active  doses  in  haematological  murine  tumour  models.  Mitoxantrone 
and  doxorubicin,  in  the  same  experimental  conditions,  showed  their  best  activity  only  at  their 
Pixuvri 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev10.11 
Page 17/85
 
 
 
 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD), whereas BBR 2778 showed a high level of efficacy at doses as low as 
approximately one third of its MTD.  
In  solid  tumour  models,  the  antitumour  activity  of  BBR  2778  was  comparable  with  that  of  standard 
agents used as comparators. Full dose-response studies were carried out for each test compound. 
In summary, BBR 2778 has a broad spectrum of antitumour activity against haematological and solid 
tumour  models.  The  activity  in  the  haematological  tumours  was  superior  to  that  of  standard  agents 
and  was  present  at  a  wide  range  of  well  tolerated  doses.  The  combination  studies  demonstrated  the 
potential of BBR 2778 as a therapeutic agent against a broad range of malignancies. The broad range 
of active nontoxic doses allows combination with other anticancer drugs.   
BBR  2778  is  primarily  metabolized  by  the  formation  of  mono-  and  di-acetyl  derivatives,  all  of  which 
were much less potent than the parent drug.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In  an  experimental  autoimmune  encephalomyelitis  (EAE)  rat  model  of  multiple  sclerosis  repeated  IV 
administration  of  mitoxantrone  and  BBR  2778,  BBR  2778  caused  more  profound  and  long-lasting 
lymphopenia that was still evident at the end of the 60-day observation period. Histopathology showed 
the lower cardiotoxicity of BBR 2778.  
In  a  study  in  MG  Lewis  rats  and  rat-derived  T-cell  lines,  BBR  2778  showed  strong  antiproliferative 
activity in vitro in the nanomolar range and BBR 2778 administration reduced the severity of disease 
compared with both vehicle and mitoxantrone-treated animals. 
When  administered  to  mice  according  to  doses  and  schedules  that  demonstrated  similar  antitumour 
efficacy,  BBR  2778  was  less  immunosuppressive  than  mitoxantrone.  However,  after  repeated 
treatments, lymphocytes were reduced more markedly by BBR 2778 than by mitoxantrone. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Effects  on  cardiovascular,  respiratory  and  central  nervous  systems  (CNS)  were  evaluated  in  GLP-
compliant studies (see table 1).  
Target organs other than the cardiac and CNS, e.g. bone marrow and kidneys, were investigated both 
via  their  functionality  markers  (i.e.  haematology  and  blood  enzymes)  and  via  histopathological 
assessment during the repeated dose toxicity studies in rodents and non rodents.

Cardiovascular and Respiratory Systems 
Cardiovascular  (including  QT  assessment)  and  respiratory  effects  of  BBR  2778  administered  by  slow 
i.v. infusion were tested at doses from 2.5 to 10 mg/kg in male anaesthetised dogs at up to 240mg/kg 
in two separate experiments. There were no treatment related changes in any of the parameters under 
examination. This result differed from that observed during a single dose study in dogs, in which BBR 
2778  at  the  IV  bolus  dose  of  10  mg/kg  resulted  in  transient  tachycardia  during  and  after 
administration.  A  non-GLP  toxicokinetic  study  (Study  Report  10670)  showed  a  relationship  between 
dose level and systemic exposure: mean plasma concentrations of BBR 2778 were proportional to the 
administered doses.  
Further  GLP  and  ICH-compliant  studies  were  conducted  in  vitro  to  investigate  possible  effects  of  BBR 
2778  on  hERG  (human-ether-a-go-go  related  gene)  potassium  channels  stably  expressed  in  HEK293 
cells. BBR 2778, at a concentration of 100 µM induced a very slight reduction (about 10% vs controls) 
of the tail current, whereas positive controls had a 96% reduction at 100 nM. In patients, the Cmax of 
BBR  2778  after  a  dose  of  84  mg/m2  corresponded  to  about  3100  nM.  It  can  therefore  be  concluded 
that at clinical doses, potassium channel inhibition is unlikely to occur. 
Central Nervous System (CNS) 
In  a  modified  Irwin  test  (Study  Report  RR/03/2008/TG)  performed  in  CD1  mice  at  12.5,  25  and  50 
mg/kg  after  single  IV  bolus  administration,  the  NOAEL  for  behavioural,  neurological  and  autonomic 
responses,  and  body  temperature  was  25  mg/kg.  At  the  highest  dose  (50  mg/kg),  males  showed 
reduced  body  tone  and  passivity  in  handling  and  elicited  response  tests.  A  temporary  decrease  (not 
statistically significant) in body temperature (-7% vs controls) was observed 2 hours after treatment, 
and this decrease recovered 5 hours after treatment. These findings agreed with symptoms observed 
during  the  single-dose  toxicity  studies  in  the  same  animal  species  at  similar  dose  levels  of  49  or  65 
mg/kg. Pharmacokinetics studies showed that the compound is not extensively distributed to the CNS 
(Study  Reports  950232  and  940738)  and  limited  penetration  occurs  after  fast  bolus  intravenous 
injection.  Based  on  these  findings  and  the  slow  injection  rate  in  patients  (1-hour  infusion),  the 
applicant considered that a low potential for CNS toxicity is expected in humans.

Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Pharmacodynamic  drug  interaction  studies  were  not  performed;  however,  drug  combination  studies 
have  been  conducted  to  evaluate  the  antitumour  efficacy  of  BBR  2778  in  combination  with  cytotoxic 
drugs. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  BBR  2778  was  evaluated  in  mice,  rats,  and  dogs  after  single  and  repeated 
administration of different doses. The compound was investigated in mice at dose levels of 40 mg/kg 
after single administration and 16 mg/kg after repeated administration, in rats at dose levels of 63 and 
96 mg/kg after single administration and 25 mg/kg after repeated administration, and in dogs at dose 
levels  from  2.5  to  10  mg/kg  after  single  administration  and  from  0.8  to  1.6  mg/kg  after  repeated 
administration.  
Some  pharmacokinetics  and  ADME  studies  were  conducted  with  [14C]  BBR 2278.  The  radiolabel  was 
located on the two carbon atoms of each diamino chain of the molecule as depicted in Figure 2.

In  order  to  characterize  the  pharmacokinetics  of the  drug,  the  concentrations  of BBR  2778  in  plasma 
and urine were determined by HPLC/UV bioanalytical methods. Several methods were developed.. 
The extraction methods applied during non-GLP studies were based either on solid phase extraction or 
liquid/liquid  extraction  from  plasma.  Urine  was  analyzed  after  dilution  with  buffer.  The  limits  of 
quantitation  (LOQ)  of  the  HPLC/UV  methods  were  0.05  and  0.3 g/mL  in  mouse  and  rat  plasma, 
respectively, and 0.15 g/mL for both mouse and rat urine. The LOQ in dog plasma was 0.010 µg/mL. 
In the toxicological GLP studies, validated HPLC/UV analytical methods based on liquid/liquid extraction 
were developed with a limit of quantification of 0.005 µg/mL for plasma from rats and dogs. Linearity, 
accuracy and precision of the methods were within the standard acceptance criteria for a bioanalytical 
method (RSD <15%).  
Absorption  
As BBR 2278 is intended for i.v. administration, no absorption studies have been conducted and this is 
considered acceptable. 
Following  i.v.  administration,  the  volume  of  distribution  exceeded  total  body  water  in  all  species 
suggesting extensive distribution into tissues. In the mouse, systemic exposure increased after weekly 
repeated  administration  for  4  weeks  and  was  2-fold  higher  than  that  after  a  single  dose.  In  the  rat, 
drug accumulation occurred after 6 months of repeated administration. The applicant claimed that this 
accumulation was consistent with the generally compromised physiological condition of the animals. In 
the dog, there was no significant overall time dependency in Cmax and AUC as expected on the basis 
Pixuvri 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev10.11 
Page 20/85
 
 
 
 
 
of  the  estimated  t1/2  of  1.9  to  9.0  hours.  There  were  some  gender  related  differences  in  PK 
parameters in rodents but not in the dog. 
Distribution 
Tissue distribution studies were conducted in the mouse after single and repeated administration and 
the  rat  after  single  administration.  The  route  of  administration  was  i.v.  In  both  species,  drug  related 
radioactivity  distributed  very  rapidly  in  almost  all  organs  and  tissues  and  it  was  persistent. 
Radioactivity  was  present  8  days  post-treatment  in  most  organs  and  mainly  in  the  spleen,  lungs, 
kidney  (both  species)  and  thymus  (rat).  There  were  no  major  gender  or  species  related  difference  in 
tissue distribution. The distribution to the brain depended on the rate of administration. After a bolus 
injection  radioactivity  was  distributed  all  over  the  brain  tissue  and  spinal  cord  whereas  after  slow 
infusion it was present only in the subarachnoid space and ventricles. After repeated administration in 
the  mouse,  there  was  evidence  of  accumulation  of  drug  related  radioactivity.  This  indicates  slow 
elimination from the tissues and systemic circulation after repeated dosing. There was limited binding 
to serum proteins. Placental transfer and milk excretion studies were not conducted. This is acceptable 
in view of the intended patient population. 
Metabolism 
The metabolism of BBR 2278 was investigated in vitro and in vivo. No in vivo studies were conducted 
in  the  dog,  the  non-rodent  species  used  in  single and  repeated  dose  toxicity  studies.  Acetylation  was 
the main metabolic pathway in rodents whilst it was stated that dogs are not capable of acetylation of 
this  class  of  compound.  The  dog  was  considered  to  be  a  suitable  non-rodent  species  because  the 
cytotoxicity of BBR 2278 was associated with the parent compound, not the metabolites. 
After microsomal incubation in all species BBR 2278 underwent oxidative biotransformation in the side 
chain  resulting  in  ring  closure.  In  vitro,  there  were  no  important  differences  between  species.  No 
additional metabolites were present in humans which were not observed in animals. 
In  vivo,  the  metabolic  profile  confirmed  the  in  vitro  findings:  the  compound  was  mainly  metabolised 
with the formation of mono- and di-acetyl derivatives in the primary amino groups of the diaminoethyl 
side chain. Unchanged drug accounted for the majority of circulating and excreted radioactivity and the 
metabolism produced a variety of metabolites, none of which accounted for more than the parent drug. 
Excretion 
Excretion  and  mass  balance  were  investigated  following  single  (mice  and  rats)  or  repeated  (male 
mouse)  i.v.  administration  of  14C  BBR  2278.  In  both  rodent  species,  drug  related  radioactivity  was 
eliminated in urine and faeces/bile with the majority being non-renal elimination. In the rat and mouse 
the renal clearance was about 400 and 4 times lower than total plasma clearance respectively. At the 
end  of  the  collection  period  16-47%  (mouse/rat)  of  the  administered  dose  was  still  found  in  the 
carcass,  in  agreement  with  the  persistent  distribution  of  drug  related  radioactivity.  After  repeated 
administration to the mouse once a week for 4 weeks, elimination of radioactivity in urine and faeces 
was  comparable  with  the  excretion  after  a  single  dose.  Following  i.v.  administration,  the  volume  of 
distribution exceeded total body water in all species suggesting extensive distribution into tissues.  
In the mouse, systemic exposure increased after weekly repeated administration for 4 weeks and was 
2-fold  higher  than  that  after  a  single  dose.  In  the  rat,  drug  accumulation  occurred  after  6  months  of 
repeated administration. In the dog there was no significant overall time dependency in Cmax or AUC 
as expected on the basis of the estimated t1/2 of 1.9-9.0 hours. There were some gender differences 
in PK parameters in rodents but not in the dog.

The  compound  showed  a  moderate  inhibition  capacity  towards  CYP1A2  activity.  The  Ki  for  BBR  2778 
against  CYP1A2  was  determined  as  5  -  10  μM  and  the  type  of  inhibition  was  at  least  partly  of  a 
competitive nature. BBR 2778 was a substrate for active efflux transporters such as P-gp.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Studies  were  conducted  in  the  mouse,  rat  and  dog.  Administration  was  by  i.v.injection,  except  for  a 
study in the mouse. The studies incorporated a recovery period ranging from 8 days to 8 weeks (see 
table 2). 
Preliminary  studies  showed  that  BBR  2778,  administered  intravenously  as  a  bolus  injection  to  CD-1 
mice,  induced  death  of  the  animals  during  or  immediately  after  the  administration  of  the  test 
compound,  starting  at  the  dose  level  of  50  mg/kg.  In  the  subsequent  experiments,  BBR  2778  was 
administered by slow infusion in order to avoid this toxic effect.  
In the pivotal IV toxicity study in mice, BBR 2778 was administered intravenously by slow infusion at 
dose  levels  of  65  mg/kg  and  49  mg/kg  and  acute  lethal  toxicity  was  observed  in  some  animals, 
probably due to peak plasma levels reached during administration. These doses are much higher than 
those  used  in  anti-tumour  activity  studies.  Histopathology  revealed  precipitates  in  the  lung  vessels, 
which may have contributed to the observed mortality. The main target organs of toxicity in surviving 
animals  were  the  hematopoietic  system,  kidneys  and  testes  which  could  be  anticipated  for  an  anti-
proliferative agent. Effects on bone marrow and kidneys were reversible by Day 29, while the effects 
on testes lasted longer. BBR 2778 was more toxic in male than in female mice. 
Intravenous toxicity studies in rats indicated that BBR 2778 induced a dose-dependent mortality in the 
range  of  80  to  140  mg/kg  (injection  rates  of  0.4  mL/min);  death  occurred,  in  many  cases  during  or 
immediately after  dosing.  The  main  overt  signs  of  toxicity  observed  in  dead  and  surviving  animals  of 
both sexes at all doses of BBR 2778 were: dyspnea, piloerection, reduced motility, swollen snout and 
bluish  discolouration  of  the  skin.  These  signs  lasted  no  longer  than  four  days,  with  the  exclusion  of 
bluish discolouration which lasted the whole period (15 days) of the study. Acute toxicity was similar in 
male  and  female  rats.  Target  organs  for  toxicity  in  rats  were  testes,  spleen,  bone  marrow, 
gastrointestinal mucosa, kidney and heart. 
A single administration of 3.25 mg/kg of BBR 2778 in the rat induced slight myelotoxic effects that had 
complete recovery about 15 days after the treatment. 
In the definitive study in the dog, BBR 2778 at 10 mg/kg (injection rate of 2 mL/min) administered as 
a single dose by the intravenous route , resulted in the death of animals at one week after treatment, 
due  to  pulmonary  edema,  which  followed  severe  immunodepression  (test  compound-related)  with 
consequent  bacteraemia.  The  dose  of  1  mg/kg  IV  in  dogs  was  considered  generally  to  be  well 
tolerated. After an 8-week recovery period, slight testicular alterations were observed in the male dog, 
whereas  alterations  of  lymphatic  tissues  related  to  immunosuppression  were  no  longer  present.  In 
dogs,  tachycardia  and  ECG  changes  also  occurred  immediately  after  treatment  only  in  non-
anaesthetised  animals  given  the  compound  at  a  2  mL/min  injection  rate.  In  safety  pharmacology 
studies  when  the  BBR2778  solution  was  injected  at  about  0.7  mL/min,  these  findings  were  not 
confirmed, indicating that cardiotoxicity is dependent on the rate of injection.

Repeat dose toxicity 
The toxicological programme consisted of a series of repeat dose studies carried out in mice, rats, and 
dogs given IV weekly treatment for 4 weeks followed by a 4-week recovery period. An additional dog 
study was performed with daily IV treatment for 5 consecutive days. Most of these preliminary studies 
were  conducted  using  male  animals,  as  it  was  shown  to  be  the  most  sensitive  gender  in  single  dose 
studies. Pivotal studies were carried out on both genders (see table 3). 
The two pivotal studies were: 
  An  18-week  intravenous  toxicity  study  in  rats  (18  males  and  18  females),  consisting  of  six 
treatment cycles of 2 doses with a 7-day interval followed by a 14-day observation period and 
including an 8-week recovery period after the 6th cycle (RR/08/2003/TG).  
  An 24-week intravenous toxicity study in dogs (4 groups of 6 males and 6 females), consisting 
of  six  treatment  cycles  of  3  doses  with  a  7-day  interval  followed  by  a  14-day  observation 
period and including an 8-week recovery period after the 6th cycle (RTC 26890).

The pivotal, GLP 6-cycle toxicity studies conducted for BBR 2778 in rats and dogs by intravenous bolus 
dosing have identified the lympho-hematopoietic organs and male reproductive tract as primary target 
organs of toxicity in both species, with the heart and kidney also being target organs in the rat.  
Lympho-Haematopoietic  Organs:  In  the  6-cycle  rat  toxicity  study,  a  dose-dependent  decrease  in 
haematocrit,  haemoglobin,  RBC  and  WBC  count  (mainly  lymphocytes)  was  recorded  during  the 
treatment period, even at the lowest dose tested (13.5 mg/kg). This was also observed in the 24-week 
pivotal dog study, again at the lowest dose tested (0.8 mg/kg, 15.8 mg/m2).  
Male  Reproductive  Tract:  BBR  2778-related  effects  on  the  testes  were  observed  in  the  6-cycle  rat 
toxicity  study.  A  dose-dependent  decrease  in  testes  size  and  weight  was  observed,  with  only  partial 
reversibility at the end of the recovery period. Tubular atrophy of the testes was observed in a dose-
dependent manner and persisted at the completion of the recovery period. Similar effects on the male 
reproductive tract were observed in other rodent (mouse and rat) toxicity studies of shorter duration. 
In dogs, significant decreases in testes weight vs. control were seen in males at all doses after 6 cycles 
of treatment. Decreased testes weight was still present at the end of recovery for all animals. Marked 
testicular  atrophy  and  absence  of  sperm  in  the  epididymides  were  seen  in  all  treated  males  after  6 
cycles and this finding persisted for all animals at the end of recovery. Consistent with the findings in 
the pivotal study, tubular epithelium degeneration of the testes was observed in dogs at doses as low 
as 0.2 mg/kg/day for 5 consecutive days. 
Heart:  Histopathological  changes  were  observed  in  a  dose-dependent  manner  for  the  myocardium 
(degenerative/vacuolar  changes,  interstitial fibrosis  and  inflammation)  of  male  and  female  rats in  the 
6-cycle toxicity study. Cardiac toxicity was observed only at doses ≥ 13.5 and 19 mg/kg in male and 
female  rats,  respectively,  i.e.  at  doses  shown  to  induce  mortality  and  severe  multi-organ  lesions. 
Cardiotoxicity was not observed in dogs.

Kidneys:  In  the  6-cycle  rat  toxicity  study,  urine  volume  was  generally increased  in  all  treated  groups 
as  compared  to  control  animals  at  the  end  of  treatment  period  (except  for  low  dose  females)  and  at 
the  end  of  recovery.  Analysis  of  the  urine  revealed  increased  levels  of  leukocytes,  proteins,  and 
erythrocytes in treated animals. The severe renal effects observed following repeated administration of 
BBR  2778  to  rats  were  always  associated  with  lesions  observed  in  the  myocardial  tissue.  In  general, 
dose-dependent  increases  in  progressive  tubular  and  glomerular  nephropathy  were  observed  with  a 
greater severity in males, but this finding was still prevalent in males and females. This finding was not 
fully reversible at the end of the recovery period. In dogs, there were minimal adverse findings for BBR 
2778  in  the  kidney.  Following  5  consecutive  days  of  dosing  at  2  mg/kg/day,  protein  and  blood  were 
observed in the urine that was graded as slight to severe. 
NOAELs were not identified in the pivotal rat and dog toxicity studies.   
Genotoxicity 
All  the  Ames  tests  were  conducted  using  Salmonella  typhimurium  strains  TA1535,  TA1537,  TA98, 
TA100  and  TA102.  The  methods  included  both  plate  incorporation  and  pre-incubation.  BBR  2778  was 
positive  in  stain  TA98  in  study  R09010  in  which  in  both  experiments  there  was  a  slight  statistically 
significant  increase  in  the  number  of  revertant  colonies  at  the  highest  non-toxic  dose  tested 
(50µg/plate)  for  strain  TA98  either  with  or  without  metabolic  activation.  In study  9648-001EXT  there 
was  a  concentration  related  increase  in  revertant  numbers  with  strain  TA1537  in  the  presence  of  S9 
metabolic activation using the pre-incubation method. These strains are considered to detect changes 
at guanine-cytosine sites within target histidine genes. BBR 2778 was clastogenic both in vitro and in 
vivo.  
Overall, the evidence indicates that BBR 2778 should be considered genotoxic. 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity study has been submitted. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Fertility and early embryonic development 
Cytotoxic  anticancer  compounds  such  as  BBR  2778  are  assumed  to  cause  embryotoxicity  and  foetal 
toxicity  as  indicated  in  the  CPMP  Note  for  Guidance  for  the  pre-clinical  evaluation  of  anticancer 
medicinal products (CPMP/SWP/997/96). Neither fertility study nor early embryonic development study 
has been submitted with pixantrone dimaleate. 
Embryo-fœtal development 
Segment  II  studies  in  rats  and  rabbits  were  carried  out  to  elucidate  the  potential  for  reproductive 
toxicity in the case of inadvertent administration to a pregnant woman. BBR 2778 was administered for 
3 consecutive days during the major period of organogenesis (Days 9 to 11). 
In  rats,  doses  from  3.25  to  13.0  mg/kg/day  (gestation  days:  9-11)  induced  maternal  and  foetal 
toxicity consisting of significant reduction of dams’ body weight, increase in post-implantation loss and 
reduction  in  number  of  viable  pups  and  mean  fetal  weight.  The  highest  dose  of  24.0  mg/kg/day 
provoked  total  resorptions.  As  malformed  fetuses  were  found  at  the  lowest dose,  no  NOAEL  could  be 
established . 
Pixuvri 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev10.11 
Page 25/85
 
 
 
In rabbits, doses of 3 to 6mg/kg also at gestational age 9-11 days induced maternal toxicity and fetal 
growth retardation, including delayed ossification. 
Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function 
No pre-post natal development study has been submitted with pixantrone dimaleate in line with the 
CPMP Note for Guidance for the pre-clinical evaluation of anticancer medicinal products 
(CPMP/SWP/997/96). 
Studies in which the offspring (juvenile animals) are dosed and/or further 
evaluated  
No study in juvenile animals was conducted with pixantrone, as it is intended for the treatment of adult 
patients with multiple relapsed or refractory aggressive NHL as monotherapy. 
Toxicokinetic data  
Studies  were  conducted  in  the  mouse,  rat,  and  dog.    The  route  of  administration  was  i.v.  except  for 
3/5  studies  in  the  mouse,  where  the  route  was  i.p.  All  the  studies  incorporated  a  recovery  period  to 
check  for  reversibility  of  treatment  related  effects.  Most  of  the  preliminary  studies  were  conducted  in 
male animals only, as it was shown that this was the most sensitive gender in single dose studies (see 
table 4).  
The dog was the non-rodent species used in single and repeated dose toxicity studies.  Acetylation was 
the main metabolic pathway in rodents whilst it was stated that dogs are not capable of acetylation of 
this class of compound. Nevertheless, the applicant considered that the dog was a suitable non-rodent 
species  because  the  cytotoxicity  of  BBR  2278  was  associated  with  the  parent  compound,  not  the 
metabolites.  The  applicant  also  stated  that  dogs  are  recognized  as  the  best  in  vivo  model  for  the 
assessment of cardiovascular toxicity, which is one of the major side effects produced by anthracycline 
-like and anthracenedione-like cytotoxic agents. 
The main findings were myelotoxicity, nephrotoxicity and testes damage, haematological toxicity that 
tended to recover, and kidney damage in rats and testicular histopathological changes in rats and dogs 
that were non-reversible.

Local Tolerance  
Local  tolerance  was  evaluated  as  part  of  the  intravenous  toxicity  studies  in  rats  and  dogs.  These 
studies were stated to have been conducted using the same formulation (BBR 2778 in 0.9% saline) as 
intended to be marketed. The dosing frequency in the rat and dog toxicity studies was equivalent to or 
higher than the frequency applied in the intended clinical use. In addition, stand-alone local tolerance 
studies  were  conducted  in  mice  with  bulking  agents  intended  to  be  used  in  the  clinical  formulation 
(mannitol,  polyvinylpyrrolidone).  Further  development  in  formulation  led  to  selection  of  lactose,  and 
further  studies  were  not  carried  out  as  it  is  not  expected  to  worsen  local  tolerability,  in  view  of  the 
well-documented  safety  of  lactose  in  pharmaceutical  preparations  for  intravenous  injections.    As  the 
final formulation chosen did not include lactose, no further studies of use of lactose as a bulking agent 
were carried out. 
Since the findings in the rat were not observed in dogs, it is likely that they were mainly due to needle 
trauma to the small vessels of rodents. 
Other toxicity studies 
Immunotoxicity 
BBR 2778 and mitoxantrone were studied  (Study Report RE/10/2008/PH) for their ability to interfere 
with  T-cell  mediated  immune  reactivities,  such  as  blastogenic  response  to  Concanavalin  A  (ConA), 
delayed  type  hypersensitivity  (DTH)  reaction  and  generation  of  cytotoxic  lymphocytes  in  CD2F1  mice 
(Vecchi 1993). Drugs were employed at doses and treatment regimen (mitoxantrone at 3 mg/kg and 
BBR  2778  at  18  mg/kg  given  intravenously  on  Days  1,  4  and  7),  which  displayed  comparable 
antitumor activity when applied in murine tumour models.  
One day after treatment, BBR 2778 and mitoxantrone decreased the blastogenic response to ConA to 
the  same  level,  while  8  days  after  treatment  BBR  2778  was  less  suppressive  than  mitoxantrone. 
Generation of cytotoxic lymphocytes was significantly reduced by both compounds at the same level at 
both times tested (1 and 8 days after treatment). DTH reactivity was not significantly modified by BBR 
2778,  while  mitoxantrone  completely  inhibited  this  parameter.  Overall,  BBR  2778  was  less 
immunosuppressive than mitoxantrone. 
Studies on impurities 
Mouse acute toxicity of two different batches of BBR 2778 was assessed in order to see if the impurity 
RT  0.61  found  in  batch  number  8083  could  induce  toxicity.  The  two  batches  exerted  a  similar  acute 
toxicity.  A  second  mouse  toxicity  study  was  conducted  to  determine  whether  a  degradation  product 
(NPH006759)  in  batch  210282-1  could  induce  toxicity  as  compared  to  a  batch  (02E607)  that  did  not 
contain the degradant. The two batches were equitoxic. BBR 3558, an impurity of BBR 2778, induced 
reverse mutations in the Ames test (see table 5).

Doxorubicin  and  mixantrone  are  anthracycline-based  compounds  that  are  known  to  cause 
cardiotoxicity.  As  BBR  2778  is  a  novel  anthracenedione  on  the  basis  of  its  biochemical  and  biological 
properties,  the  potential  cardiotoxicity  of  BBR  2778  was  investigated  in  comparison  with  doxorubicin 
and  mitoxantrone.  Potential  exacerbation  of  cardiotoxicity  by  BBR  2778  was  investigated  in 
doxorubicin-induced  animal  models  of  cardiac  toxicity,  and  comparative  studies  were  performed  with 
the individual compounds in healthy animals. 
Occasional  cardiovascular  findings  in  the  toxicology  studies  in  rats  and  dogs  prompted  further 
investigation.  Cardiac  alterations  were  recorded  at  the  high  dose  in  one  study  in  mice  and  rats, 
possibly  related,  at  least  in  rats,  to  the  chronic  renal  disease  status.  Although  in  the  single  dose 
toxicity study in dogs some changes in cardiac function were observed after an IV bolus injection, in a 
safety  pharmacology  study  in  dogs,  no  respiratory  or  cardiac  parameters  were  altered,  including  QT 
interval, after a slower administration (i.e. IV infusion) of BBR 2778 at up to 10 mg/kg (200 mg/m2).  
BBR 2778 was compared to equiactive doses of doxorubicin and mitoxantrone in treatment-naïve and 
in doxorubicin-pretreated mice using a schedule of treatment reported in the literature as optimal for 
the evaluation of cardiotoxicity of these agents. BBR 2778, administered twice a week for 4 weeks at 
up to 27 mg/kg, did not induce any cardiotoxic effects, whereas mitoxantrone was cardiotoxic at all the 
doses  tested  (1.1,  1.8  and  2.5  mg/kg).  In  addition,  doxorubicin-induced  cardiotoxicity  was  enhanced 
to  a  lesser  extent  by  BBR  2778  than  by  mitoxantrone  or  doxorubicin  alone.  Thus,  the  cardiotoxic 
potential of BBR 2778 was lower than that of the reference compounds doxorubicin and mitoxantrone. 
Sudden death 
In  the  BBR  2778  toxicity  studies,  mortality  was  observed  during  or  immediately  after  treatment.  A 
series of studies have been conducted to investigate the possible contributions of dose rate and length 
of infusion and precipitation, as well as the thrombogenic and arrhythmogenic potential of BBR 2778. 
Higher  injection  rates  resulted  in  unexpected,  early  mortality  and  several  studies  were  performed  to 
investigate  the  sudden  death  phenomenon.  BBR  2778  thrombogenic  activity  was  evaluated  in  male 
mice pretreated with antithrombotic agents (acetylsalicylic acid or hydrocortisone sodium succinate) at 
doses  which  inhibited  the  sudden  death  due  to  pulmonary  thrombosis  and  pulmonary  artery 
constriction  induced  by  sodium  arachidonate.  Pretreatment  with  both  antithrombotic  agents  failed  to 
prevent the sudden death phenomenon induced by BBR 2778. Heparin pretreatment markedly reduced 
the incidence of sudden deaths in both mice and rats, but this result was ambiguously associated with 
a  reduction  in  the  delayed  mortality  and  in  the  intensity  of  the  blue  colouring  induced  by  BBR  2778. 
Moreover, the addition to plasma or serum samples of heparin and BBR 2778 caused the formation of 
a blue precipitate. 
The  evaluation  of  the  main  hemocoagulative  parameters  as  PTT  (partial  thromboplastin  time),  PT

administration  showed  a  reduction  in  fibrinogen  concentration  and  an  increase  in  T-C.  No  changes  in 
D-D, PT and PTT values were observed. 
The onset of arrhythmias, related or not related with a cardiac electrolytic imbalance, could explain the 
rapidity with which the sudden death phenomenon developed. 
Two  studies  performed  in  the  mouse  and  the  rat  at  severely  toxic  doses  (LD60-80)  showed  marked 
alterations of electrocardiographic tracings characterized by atrium-ventricular blocks and anomalies of 
the QRS complex. Since these arrhythmic phenomena appeared towards the end of the infusion, at the 
moment of onset of animal agony, it cannot be determined whether these alterations were caused by a 
direct  arrhythmogenic  activity  of  BBR  2778  or  by  a  preagonic  ischemic  condition.  For  this  reason,  a 
third  study  was  performed  to  evaluate  the  possible  arrhythmogenic  activity  of  BBR  2778  at  sublethal 
doses.  In  this  study,  the  reading  of  electrocardiographic  tracings  identified  the  presence  of  slight 
morphological  alterations  of  some  electrocardiographic  waves.  These  changes  could  indicate  minimal 
alterations  in  the  conduction  of  cardiac  stimulus  (depolarization/repolarisation)  caused  by  an 
electrolytic imbalance. 
Studies to investigate a possible systemic electrolytic imbalance caused by BBR 2778 were performed 
both in mice and rats at lethal and sublethal doses. In one of the studies, animals were placed under 
forced  respiration  conditions  to  eliminate  possible  interference  of  respiratory  acidosis  on  the  hematic 
concentration  of  the  electrolytes  measured.  In  all  the  studies,  a  marked  dose-dependent  increase  in 
potassium values was observed, which was toxicologically relevant. 
Myelotoxicity 
Myelotoxic effects were expected for BBR 2778 and were evident from toxicity studies. Specific studies 
were carried out to compare the myelotoxicity of BBR 2778 to that of other marketed anticancer drugs.  
The pivotal study used a method (Colony Forming Units – Spleen) originally set up for the evaluation of 
the myelotoxic effect exerted by ionizing radiation (Till 1961). It was shown that myelotoxicity of BBR 
2778 is similar to that of mitoxantrone at equitoxic doses in the male mouse (BBR 2778 at 65 mg/kg 
and mitoxantrone at 10.4 mg/kg corresponding to the LD10). This study was not performed according 
to GLP; nevertheless, the reporting is of adequate standard and it was conducted at the highest quality 
standards in force at the time of the experiments. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant has presented an experimentally determined logKow which is below the threshold value 
of 4.5. Thus, pixantrone is not considered a PBT drug. By refining Fpen for the prevalence of No
n 
Hodgkin’s lymphoma the PECsurface water is set to 0.00636 g.l-1, which is below the trigger value of 
0.01g.l-1.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
A  general  effect  of  BBR  2778  that  was  observed  in  all  in  vivo  experiments  was  bluish  discolouration 
diffusely  observed  in  all  organs.  The  greatest  occurrence  was  in  animals  that  died  immediately  after 
dosing which was attributed to rapid distribution of administered dark-bluish solutions of the drug.  
In rodents, the sudden death of animals during or immediately after i.v. bolus administration appeared 
to be primarily attributable to the injection rate and dose volume. The clinical relevance of this finding 
is that it indicates the importance of administration of pixantrone as a slow infusion. 
The pivotal, GLP 6-cycle toxicity studies conducted for BBR 2778 in rats and dogs by intravenous bolus 
dosing have identified the lympho-hematopoietic organs and male reproductive tract as primary target 
organs of toxicity in both species, with the heart and kidney also target organs in the rat. NOAELs were 
not identified in the pivotal rat and dog toxicity studies. 
The hematotoxicity and myelotoxicity of BBR 2778 were directly compared to mitoxantrone. Studies in 
mice  demonstrated  that  these  compounds  from  the  same  therapeutic  class  displayed  a  similar 
myelotoxicity at equitoxic doses. 
Because  of  the  chemical  similarity  of  BBR  2778  with  other  cardiotoxic  drugs,  cardiotoxicity  studies 
were of particular relevance.    
The  use  of  anthracyclines  and  anthracenediones  is  associated  with  irreversible  and  cumulative 
cardiotoxicity.  Histopathological  changes  were  observed  in  a  dose-dependent  manner  for  the 
myocardium (degenerative/vacuolar changes, interstitial fibrosis and inflammation) of male and female 
rats  in  the  6-cycle  toxicity  study.  Cardiotoxicity  was  not  observed  in  a  safety  pharmacology  study  in 
dogs,  no  respiratory  or  cardiac  parameters  were  altered,  including  QT  interval,  after  i.v.  infusion  of 
BBR 2778 at up to 10 mg/kg (200 mg/m2).  
In  vitro,  a  slight  alteration  of  potassium  channel  function  was  seen  only  at  the  high  concentration  of 
100  µM,  which  is  much  higher  than  3100  nM,  the  maximum  Cmax  of  BBR  2778  in  patients  given  84 
mg/m2 as a single agent.  
The  cardiotoxic  potential  of  BBR  2778  appears  to  be  lower  than  that  of  the  reference  compounds 
doxorubicin and mitoxantrone determined using equiactive dose levels in terms of efficacy in the same 
experimental conditions/models in mice. 
As  anticipated  based  on  the  cytotoxic  mechanisms  of  action  of  the  compound,  experimental  data 
indicated that BBR 2778 is genotoxic. 
Due  to  the  proposed  clinical indication,  the  carcinogenic  potential  of  BBR  2778  has  not  been  studied. 
According to current guidelines, when the life-expectancy in the indicated population is short, no long-
term  carcinogenicity  studies  are  required.  In  pregnant  rats,  BBR  2778  was  embryotoxic,  visceral 
malformations  were  observed  (e.g.  absence  of  thymus,  hydronephrosis,  enlarged  ureters,  increased 
incidence of ectopic or pelvic kidney), and incomplete ossification of the skeleton (primarily attributed 
to  lower  fetal  weights).  BBR  2778  was  not  embryotoxic  in  rabbits,  with  smaller  fetuses  observed  for 
treated animals but no corresponding toxicological differences upon comparisons of fixed fetus heads. 
Minor changes in ossification were attributed to maternal toxicity or low fetal weight.

BBR  2778-related  effects  on  the  testes  were  observed  in  the  6-cycle  rat  toxicity  study.    In  dogs, 
significant  decreases  in  testes  weight  vs.  control  were  seen  in  males  at  all  doses  after  6  cycles  of 
treatment.  
Assessment of paediatric data on non-clinical aspects 
The  Applicant  submitted  a  Paediatric  Investigational  Plan  (EMEA-000713-PIP02-10)  to  the  Paediatric 
Committee (PDCO) for which assessment began on 12 August 2010. The preclinical program consists 
of  a  juvenile  mouse  cardiotoxicity  study  (Study  No.  1);  a  study  of  toxicokinetics  of  sudden  death  in 
mice  (Study  2);  and,  a  study  to  evaluate  pixantrone  efficacy  using  in  vivo  xenograft  models  of 
paediatric solid tumours (study 3).  These studies are described below.    
Study  1,  in  10-day  old  mice,  will  evaluate  the  toxicokinetics,  clinical  signs  and  symptoms  (including 
markers  of  nephro-  and  cardiotoxicity)  in  several  tissues  including  kidneys,  heart,  hematopoietic 
tissue.    Mice  will  be  administered  (intravenously  or  intraperitoneally)  27  mg/kg  of  pixantrone  twice 
weekly up to 35 days.  The study will also include a reversal period.  This study will be completed prior 
to any child under the age of 12 may receive pixantrone.  
Study  2  will  evaluate  the  toxicokinetics  of  various  doses  of  pixantrone  and  the  potential  to  cause 
sudden  death.    This  study  will  be  completed  prior  to  any  child  under  the  age  of  12  may  receive 
pixantrone.  
Study 3 will evaluate pixantrone in mouse xenograft models against a broad range of paediatric solid 
tumors  to  support  general  paediatric  development  using  similar  methodology  as  the  Paediatric 
Preclinical  Testing  Program  at  NCI  (adult  mice  for  kidney/rhabdoid  tumors,  Ewing  sarcoma, 
osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, and non-glioblastoma brain tumors.  Results from 
Study  3  are  needed  to  support  potential  enrolling  paediatric  patients  with  solid  tumors  in  to  the 
proposed clinical trials.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the non clinical issues:  
Further investigation of the phototoxic potential of pixantrone is considered necessary (see section 2.4 
clinical aspects). A non-clinical in vivo phototoxicity study should be conducted, and has been included 
in the RMP. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
At  the  time  of  submission,  the  completed  clinical  development  (see  Figure  3)  includes  seven  single-
agent  and  five  multiagent  combination  studies  which  have  treated  a  total  of  348  patients  with 
pixantrone; 80% of these patients had NHL and extensive prior anthracycline exposure.

Figure 3: Clinical development of pixantrone 
An  additional  study  PIX  203  was  submitted  during  the  procedure  in  which  61  patients  received 
pixantrone as part of a combination regimen (see Table 7). 
The indication applied for initially was the following: 
Pixuvri  is  indicated  as  monotherapy  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  multiply  relapsed  or 
refractory aggressive Non Hodgkin Lymphomas (NHL). 
The final proposed indication is as follows: 
Pixuvri is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with multiply relapsed or 
refractory aggressive Non Hodgkin B cell Lymphomas (NHL). The benefit of pixantrone treatment has 
not been established in patients when used as fifth line or greater chemotherapy in patients who are 
refractory to last therapy. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
After reconstitution, Pixuvri is an aqueous solution intended for administration via intravenous infusion. 
Following intravenous administration, plasma concentrations of pixantrone base reached the maximal 
concentration at the end of infusion and then declined poly-exponentially. The pharmacokinetics of 
Pixuvri was dose-independent in the 3 mg/m2 to105 mg/m2 dose range and no substantial differences 
were observed when the medicinal product was given as a single agent or in combination studies. 
Average exposures as single agent accounted for:

From an analysis of population PK data, for a target recorded dose of 50 mg/m2 of pixantrone base the 
median 28-day cycle exposure was 6320 ng.hr/ml (90% CI, 5990-6800 ng.hr/ml), for  
3 doses / 4 week cycle. 
Distribution 
After 1-hr intravenous infusion, maximum plasma concentrations of pixantrone were reached at end of 
infusion. Thereafter, plasma concentrations declined poly-exponentially. There was no apparent dose 
dependency. Pharmacokinetic data after repeated doses is basically non-existent, but this is accepted 
given the intermittent dosing schedule. Distribution was extensive, with volume of distribution (Vss) 
estimations from single-agent studies varying between 94 to 972 L/m2 in different studies and at 
different doses. Also the terminal half-life of pixantrone varied considerably between doses and studies 
and ranged between 6 to 36 hr. CL values ranged between 20-59 L/hr/m2. 
The protein binding in human plasma was weak, 57%, and independent of pixantrone concentration. A 
similar degree of binding was observed in plasma from different animal species.  
Elimination 
There is no human mass-balance study but it is considered that in view of the very long term collection 
period needed it would be very difficult to conduct such study in cancer patients. In a non-clinical 
mass-balance study in the rat, a relatively large part of the radioactivity (47%) persisted in the carcass 
after 192 hours (8 days), in agreement with a large body of distribution and a slow tissue release. In 
pharmacokinetic studies in humans, plasma sampling was only performed for 24 or 48 hours. Thus, it 
cannot be completely excluded that a long terminal elimination phase has been missed.  However, 
there is no trend in the clinical safety data indicating that pixantrone concentrations accumulate 
markedly over time at 3 weekly administrations per 28-day period.  
In animal studies, drug-related material was predominantly excreted in faeces, and urinary excretion 
data from humans may indicate a low renal excretion of pixantrone and its metabolites. However, as 
urinary sampling was only made for 24 hours, final conclusions on the importance of renal clearance 
cannot be drawn. Nevertheless, elimination in humans is likely to be primarily via hepatic routes. The 
degree of metabolism in human material in vitro was low, and the primary metabolic pathway was 
conjugation (acetylation) via N-acetyltranferase (NAT). Metabolites were only present in small 
quantities in urine and were found to be inactive. An in vitro study has confirmed there is no reversible 
metabolism to active pixantrone. It is not known which NAT isoform is involved in the metabolism of 
pixantrone but there is very limited transformation of pixantrone into acetylated metabolites and 
therefore a significant consequence of genetic polymorphism is not expected. 
Pixantrone has a moderate to high total plasma clearance of 72.7 l/hr and a low renal excretion 
accounting for less than 10% of the administered dose in 0-24 hours. The terminal half-life ranged 
from 14.5 to 44.8 hr with a mean of 23.3  8.0 (n=14, CV=34%) and a median of 21.2 hr. Due to the 
limited contribution of renal clearance, plasma clearance is mainly non-renal. Pixuvri may be 
metabolised in the liver and/or excreted in the bile. As metabolism appears to be limited, biliary 
excretion of unchanged pixantrone may be the major elimination pathway. Hepatic clearance 
approximates the hepatic plasma flow, suggesting a high hepatic extraction ratio and, therefore, 
efficient parent active substance elimination. Hepatic uptake of pixantrone is possibly mediated by 
OCT1 active transporters and biliary excretion by P-gp and BCRP. 
Pixuvri

Rev10.11

Pixantrone had only a weak or no capability to inhibit P-gp, BCRP, and BSEP transport mechanism in 
vitro.  
Pixantrone did inhibit OCT1-mediated metformin transport in vitro, but is not expected to inhibit OTC1 
in vivo at clinically relevant concentrations. Pixantrone was a poor inhibitor of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 
uptake transporters in vitro. 
Considering the in vitro metabolism, human urinary excretion and animal data together, the most 
important route of elimination for pixantrone in humans appears to be biliary excretion of unchanged 
compound.   
Polymorphism in NATs or hepatic transport proteins may increase pharmacokinetic variability, but at 
present this cannot be handled in clinical practice in other ways than by individual dose adjustments 
based on haematological response. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
  Dose proportionality 
After the administration of pixantrone as a single agent or in combination with other drugs, systemic 
exposure (AUC0-24h) increased with dose, without a marked deviation from dose-linearity from 5 to 
180 mg/m2 as shown in Figure 4 below. 
In the single agent studies AUC0-24h accounted for more than 80% of the AUC.

  Time dependency 
Time dependence was assessed in study PIX301. Although no definitive conclusions could be drawn 
due to the limited number of subjects, the PK appears time independent. The systemic exposures 
calculated after single and repeated administrations are comparable, as expected given its terminal 
half-life and the dosage interval. This is consistent with the lack of cumulative neutropaenia observed 
in the study.

Special populations 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
In the phase I studies, inter-individual variability (CV%) was generally around 25-50%. The different 
dose groups were, however, small. As there is basically no data on repeated administration, intra-
individual variability has not been determined.  
Renal and hepatic impairment 
There are no specific studies in renal or hepatic impairment.  
Because the renal excretion appears not to be an important route of elimination caution should be 
exercised when administering pixuvri in patients with renal impairment (see section 4.2 of the SmPC).  
Pixantrone is likely mainly eliminated via hepatic routes, and hepatic impairment may therefore be 
expected to increase pixantrone exposure. As biliary excretion may be the major route of elimination, 
pixantrone treatment should not be administered to patients with severe liver impairment (see section 
4.3 of the SmPC). A reduced starting dose is not considered appropriate, as the effect of hepatic 
impairment is unknown and underexposure should be strictly avoided. Subsequent doses will be 
individualised based on e.g. haematological toxicity.  
Acknowledging the difficulties in performing a specific pharmacokinetic study in patients with NHL and 
hepatic impairment, the CHMP accepted the absence of such study. The limited data on NHL patients 
with mild degree of liver impairment is reassuring with no significant worsening of liver function and 
with a safety profile similar to the rest of the safety population. The SmPC wording is considered 
appropriate to compensate for the lack of data in patients with hepatic impairment. Caution should be 
exercised in patients with mild or moderate liver impairment (see section 4.2 of the SmPC). 
Gender 
The gender effect on the pharmacokinetics of pixantrone was investigated within the retrospective 
pop-PK analysis performed with data from Phase I single-agent studies. No significant effect of gender 
was observed. 
Elderly 
The retrospective pop-PK analysis performed with data from Phase I single-agent trials did not 
highlight any influence of age on systemic clearance and volume of distribution. In the population 
analysis, there were only a few subjects above 65 years and no subjects above 70 years. The age 
range was somewhat wider among the patients included in the statistical analysis. 
Race 
There was no apparent difference in pharmacokinetic between Caucasian and Hispanics. Although most 
PK population were Caucasian the elimination of pixantrone is mainly hepatic with a limited degree of 
metabolism via acetylation by NAT. Therefore, no significant PK differences are expected in patients of 
Asian or African background. 
Weight and Body surface area (BSA) 
Clearance appears to be, to some extent, dependent on body size measures and dosing based on BSA 
is acceptable. However, data in obese patients is limited and it is advised to exercise caution when 
administering pixuvri in obese patients (see SmPC section 4.2). 
Children 
Pixantrone is at present not indicated for children, and no paediatric data are yet available.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The risk for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions with pixantrone has mainly been evaluated in 
vitro.   
Pixantrone metabolism appears to be mediated via N-acetyltransferases (NATs). The overall 
importance of metabolism for pixantrone elimination cannot be fully determined but may be small. In 
addition, interactions involving inhibition of NATs are not recognised as a problem to the same extent 
as interactions involving CYPs. Thus, the risk for clinically relevant interactions on the metabolic level 
affecting pixantrone concentrations is expected to be low. Based on in vitro studies, pixantrone was 
found to be a substrate for the membrane transport proteins P-gp/BRCP and OCT1 and agents which 
inhibit these transporters have the potential to decrease hepatic uptake and excretion efficiency of 
pixantrone. Blood counts should be closely monitored when co-administered with agents that inhibit 
such transporters such as cyclosporine A or tacrolimus, commonly used to control chronic graft-versus-
host disease, and the anti-HIV agents: ritonavir, saquinavir or nelfinavir. 
In addition, caution should be taken when pixantrone is continuously co-administered with efflux 
transport inducers such as rifampicin, carbamazepin and glucocorticoids, as pixantrone excretion might 
be increased with a consequent decrease of systemic exposure. 
In vitro, pixantrone inhibited CYP1A2 at clinically relevant concentrations. The interaction has not been 
confirmed in vivo, however warnings in the SmPC for CYP1A2 substrates with narrow therapeutic index 
such as theophylline have been included (see SmPC section 4.5). The potential for pixantrone to 
reversibly inhibit CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 at clinically relevant concentration is low. Definite conclusions on 
the risk for inhibition of CYP2C8 activity cannot be drawn from the data submitted. Although the in 
vitro signal is relatively weak, given that an inhibitory potential cannot be completely excluded based 
on in vitro data, a warning against some relevant CYP2C8 substrates such as repaglinide, rosiglitazone, 
or paclitaxel has been included in section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
No clinical pharmacodynamics studies were conducted.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
In humans haematological toxicity, mainly neutropaenia and leucopaenia is the most common adverse 
event and determined the dose limiting toxicity (DLT). There is a direct relationship between exposure 
and neutropenia. During the pivotal study after an initial decline from baseline to cycle 2, mean 
neutrophil nadirs remain stable through subsequent cycles.  
Data pooled from four single agent studies (AZA-I-01, 02, 03 and PIX 301) using different doses of 
pixantrone and in different cancer populations have shown a relationship between plasma exposure 
(AUC) and pharmacodynamic effect (PFS and neutropaenia).  
No specific studies on pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances and 
genetic differences in PD response were submitted but none are required. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Dosing based on BSA as proposed for pixantrone is acceptable   
Pixuvri 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev10.11 
Page 39/85
 
 
 
The proposed contraindication in patients with severe liver impairment and the caution recommended 
when administering pixuvri in patients with renal impairment and in patients with mild or moderate 
liver impairment is acceptable.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, based on the data submitted, the clinical pharmacology of pixantrone has been adequately 
investigated  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy  
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Three phase 1 dose-escalation single agent studies explored two different treatment regimens: 
pixantrone every 3 weeks and pixantrone weekly for 3 consecutive weeks with 1 week rest. The MTD 
and recommended dose was assessed in each study and the dose-limiting toxicity was reversible grade 
4 neutropenia of more than 4 days’ duration (see table 8).

AZA I-03 enrolled 26 patients with relapsed heavily pretreated NHL or CLL. There were 5 responses, 3 
CRs and 2 PRs. All CRs occurred in the 84 mg/m2 dose cohort and included a patient with relapsed 
DLBCL, a patient with primary refractory follicular NHL with bone marrow involvement and pleural 
effusions, and a patient with relapsed advanced aggressive B-NHL.  
Based on this data the dose of 85 mg/m2 on days 1,8,15 of a 28 day cycle was chosen for further 
phase II development (AZA II-01). 
2.5.2.  Main study 
PIX301: international, multicentre, randomised, active controlled, open-label Phase III study designed 
to compare the efficacy and safety of pixantrone to that of physician’s choice of protocol-specified 
single-agent therapies in patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive NHL who had received at least

Treatments 
Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio by IVRS to one of two treatment groups: pixantrone or 
comparator.  
Experimental arm 
Pixantrone 85 mg/m by IV infusion on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 4-week cycle for up to 6 cycles 
2 
Comparator arm 
Physician’s choice of 1 out of 6 specified single agents that are approved for cancer indications other 
than aggressive NHL but with demonstrated activity in aggressive NHL. Vinorelbine, oxaliplatin, 
ifosfamide, etoposide, mitoxantrone, gemcitabine (US) for up to 6 cycles or rituximab (US) were 
administered using the protocol-specified doses and schedules. 
After completion of treatments (up to 6 cycles) there was an 18 month follow up. 
The study scheme is shown below. 
Objectives 
Primary objective 
To compare the efficacy of BBR 2778 (pixantrone) to a selection of single agents in terms of the 
complete response (CR) and unconfirmed complete response (CRu) rate.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
CR  or  CRu  rate  (ITT)  assessed  by  the  Independent  Assessment  Panel  (IAP)  based  on  the 
Report of the International Workshop to Standardize Response Criteria. These criteria are also known 
as the International Working Group (IWG) criteria (Cheson 1999). 
Secondary endpoint 
 
Progression-free survival (PFS) 
  Response rate lasting at least 4 months 
  Overall survival (OS) 
Other pre-specified endpoints: 
  Overall response rate (ORR): The total proportion of patients with a CR/CRu/PR as 
assessed by the IAP.   
Time to response 
Time to CR(CR or CRu) 
 
 
  Duration of response  
Efficacy was assessed on Days 50, 106, and at any time a patient discontinued study treatment (End 
Of Treatment or EOT), then every 8 weeks ± 1 week during the follow-up period.  
An independent assessment was conducted centrally by an Independent Radiology Committee (IRC) 
comprised of a radiologist and by an Independent Assessment Panel (IAP) comprised of a radiologist, 
oncologist, and pathologist. An independent central pathology assessment was also planned. 
The IRC and IAP assessments were organized by an independent CRO and included physicians not 
affiliated with the Sponsor and blinded to treatment assignment.  
The IRC based its assessment on the radiologic response. The IAP subsequently provided the final 
assessment of response. The investigator response was also collected and used as a sensitivity 
analysis to assess concordance of investigator and IAP responses.  
The IRC and IAP remained blinded during the follow-up period and response assessments in follow-up 
were included in the End of Study (EOS) analysis.   
Sample size 
The planned enrolment was 320 patients based on the CR seen on AZA-II-01 study of 15%. There 
were limited literature data on outcomes in the third-line setting and it was believed that the CR/CRu 
rate with comparators was ≤ 5%. In order to detect a 10% difference on CR/CRu rate between the 
arms a total of 320 patients (160 per arm) was required to achieve 80% power.  
An interim efficacy analysis that was to occur after 50% of the planned 320 patients had been accrued 
was cancelled. At the time enrolment was discontinued, the IAP remained blinded to patient treatment 
assignment, and a majority of the patients had not yet had independent assessment of response. With 
the enrolment of 140 patients, the study was considered sufficiently powered (about 80%) to detect a 
15% difference in the CR/CRu rate, assuming a ≥ 18% CR/CRu rate in the pixantrone arm.   
Randomisation 
Randomisation was 1:1 ratio. 
Stratification was by 3 factors: 
Pixuvri 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev10.11 
Page 43/85
 
 
 
 
 
 
- Region (North America [NA] vs. Western Europe [WE] vs. Rest of World [ROW])  
- International Prognostic Index (IPI) Score- internationally accepted prognostic index for 
patients with aggressive NHL. 
- Prior SCT  
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. Treatment assignment was known to patients, investigators, clinical 
research associates (CRAs) and pharmacovigilance but the IRC and IAP were blinded to treatment 
assignments and to investigator assessments of response. 
Statistical methods 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP): 
 
The first and primary analysis, the End of Treatment (EOT), used a database cutoff after the 
last patient completed the end-of-treatment visit.  
  An End of Study (EOS) analysis was performed on data from the treatment and follow-up 
periods.  
There were 2 predefined study populations  
 
ITT (primary analysis) 
  HITT (secondary analysis). This was a histologically-confirmed aggressive NHL population by 
retrospective independent central pathology assessment 
Patients who had neither progressed nor died were censored for PFS at the date last assessed and 
found to be progression-free. Patients receiving a new treatment for aggressive NHL in the absence of 
progression were considered as progressing at the time of retreatment. Since the study was designed 
to follow patients through 18 months after 6 cycles of treatment, patients alive after 24 months were 
censored at 24 months. 
Results 
After 4 years the study was closed to enrolment (140 patients randomized) due to extremely slow 
accrual. 
Baseline disease and demographics were similar between the two groups with no significant 
differences. DLBCL followed by transformed indolent lymphoma were the most common NHL types. 
Very few patients had T cell NHL. All patients had received at least two prior chemotherapy treatments 
and above 50% had received at least three regimens. Previous median anthracycline dose received 
was approx.300 mg/m2. The majority of patients were refractory to their last therapy (57% refractory 
both groups) and a mean time from last chemotherapy to randomisation was longer than 13 months. 
Of note no black patients were recruited.  
Region was one of the stratification factors and notably only 38/140 patients were recruited in 
“Western Europe”.

Recruitment 
Study period: First patient randomized 12 October 2004; last patient last treatment visit 28 August 
2008; database cut-off for End-of-Treatment (EOT) analysis 30 September 2008; last patient last

Conduct of the study 
Study 301 was conducted in 66 sites in 17 countries: Argentina, Bulgaria, Colombia, Ecuador, France, 
Germany, Hungary, India, Italy, Peru, Poland, Romania, Russia, Ukraine, United Kingdom, the United 
States and Uruguay. 
Enrolment was not distributed evenly among the geographically defined strata. Eight patients were 
enrolled from North America (all from the US), 38 patients from Western Europe, and 94 patients from 
the Rest of World. 
Changes in the Conduct of the Study or Planned Analyses  
A country-specific protocol for Spain was generated with the amendment to the original protocol that 
showed only etoposide and mitoxantrone as options in the comparator group.  
Major amendments are listed below: 
Amendment 1 (14 October 2004): 
 ▪ Inclusion criteria modified to state patients must be sensitive to their last 
anthracycline/anthracendione regimen.  
Amendment 2 (01 March 2005): 
Pixuvri 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev10.11 
Page 45/85
 
 
 
 
A country-specific protocol for the US was generated with the amendment to the protocol (non-
Spain) that added gemcitabine and rituximab to the existing list of permitted drugs for the 
comparator group.  
▪ Gemcitabine and rituximab (CD 20+ patients only) were added as options for comparator group 
drugs and dosage specifications for oxaliplatin were removed.  
▪ Follicular lymphoma grade III was removed from eligible disease types.  
Amendment 3 (08 February 2006): 
▪ “With evidence of disease progression” added to inclusion criteria requiring relapse after 2 or 
more prior regimens and “(confirmed or unconfirmed PR or CR)” added to inclusion criteria 
requiring prior response to anthracycline/anthracenedione.  
▪ Expected accrual time changed from 12 to 36 months to reflect slower than originally 
expected enrollment.  
▪ Geographic region for stratification previously defined as “Eastern Europe” changed to “Rest 
of World,” and text added to state that stratification variables will be investigated as covariates for 
the primary and secondary analyses.  
Amendment 4 (07 December 2006): 
▪ The secondary endpoint time to progression (TTP) was changed to progression-free survival 
(PFS).  
Amendment 4 (20 June 2007): 
▪ Follicular lymphoma (grade III) was added to inclusion criterion #1.

For the primary endpoint at EOT by IAP, there were 8 (11.4%) CRs in the Pixantrone arm vs 0 CR in 
the comparator arm and 6 (8.6%) CRu in the Pixantrone arm vs 4 (5.7%) CRu in the comparator arm. 
The results also favoured pixantrone for duration of all responses, duration of CR/CRu and time to CR 
although no statistical significant differences were observed. Time to response was the same for both 
arms (median 1.9 months). 
Ancillary analyses 
1. 
Investigator Assessment 
Three cases of CR were recorded in the comparator arm (4.3%) that were not seen in the IAP 
assessment and led to a non statistical difference in CR/Cru rate at the EOT. Twelve (12) of 70 patients 
(17.1%; 95% CI 9.2%, 28.0%) in the pixantrone treatment group had achieved a CR/CRu at the time 
of the EOT analysis, compared with 4 of 70 patients (5.7%; 95% CI 1.6%, 14.0%) in the comparator

group (P=0.060). PFS showed statistical significant difference in favour of pixantrone (4.2 months vs. 
2.6 months, HR=0.64 (0.45, 0.92), P=0.015). 
2.  HITT analysis 
The HITT population consisted of 104 patients (54 pixantrone vs 50 comparator). 36 patients of the 
ITT population were not in the HITT (25 patients had confirmed aggressive NHL, 3 had low-grade NHL, 
6 had insufficient information and 2 patients had no pathology reports). 
In this analysis all the endpoints favoured pixantrone but only PFS (5.0 months vs. 2.6 months, 
HR=0.54 (0.36, 0.82), p = 0.003) and ORR at EOT (CR/Cru/PR 33.3% vs. 16.0%, p = 0.04) showed a 
statistically significant difference.  
Subgroup analyses

i. 
The Effect of Rituximab on Efficacy of Pixantrone 
Thirty eight (54.3%) patients randomized to the pixantrone arm and 39 (55.7%) patients randomized 
to the comparator arm, received rituximab therapy prior to study entry.  
Table 16 presents the overall response rates (ORRs) for pixantrone and comparator patients who did or 
did not receive prior rituximab.  
Table 16: Overall response rate by prior rituximab experience and prior line of therapy 
The effect of prior rituximab therapy on progression-free survival (PFS) was also evaluated by the 
number of prior regimens. The median time to progression and the hazard ratio are presented in Table 
17.

ii. 
Efficacy of Pixantrone in Patients with Prior Stem Cell Transplantation 
Twenty-one patients with prior autologous stem cell transplants were enrolled in PIX301. Patients with 
prior stem cell transplants had a median of 3.0 and a mean of 4.1 prior regimens including 
conditioning regimens for stem cell transplantation. All stem cell transplant patients, with the exception 
of 1 in the comparator arm, received prior rituximab therapy.  
Of the 11 pixantrone patients with prior stem cell transplants, 2 were responders (18%), 1 CR and 1 
partial response (PR). In the control group there were 3 responders (33%), 2 CRu and 1 PR. Given the 
small number of patients and the high number of prior regimens, it is not possible to draw firm 
conclusions regarding the efficacy of pixantrone in patients following stem cell transplant.  
iii. 
Efficacy in European Patients 
Table 18, provides a comparison of the demographic and baseline disease characteristics 
between patients recruited from WE versus ROW. 
There were a total of 38 WE patients enrolled in PIX301, 19 per study arm.  Of the 19 patients enrolled 
in Europe, there were 3 responders (16%); 2 with PR and 1 with CRu.  
Most patients from Europe were heavily pre-treated with multiple combinations regimens including 
rituximab (Table 8), had a short interval from their last regimen, and nearly half of the patients had 
rapidly advancing disease. Compared to other patients enrolled in the study, patients entered in 
Europe were later stage patients with highly aggressive disease.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
No analyses performed across trials were submitted. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
Because patients with clinically significant impaired hepatic and renal function were excluded in general 
from AZA II-01 and PIX301 studies, drug exposure and efficacy in these populations has not been 
formally evaluated. Further, the efficacy of pixantrone has not been formally evaluated in this 
indication in patients resistant to anthracyclines, as patients in AZA II-01 and PIX301 were to have 
been sensitive to prior anthracyclines. However, it has been reported that in DLBCL the vast majority 
of patients are sensitive to first line anthracycline therapy (Coiffier 2002). Because in the pivotal study 
the majority of patients (around 75%) had been diagnosed with DLBCL the study population is 
representative of the majority of the target population. The data have been reflected in the SmPC 
(section 5.1). 
Supportive study 
Study AZA-II-01: 
This was an uncontrolled open-label Phase II study evaluating pixantrone 85 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, and 
15 in 28-day cycles as treatment for adult patients with relapsed aggressive NHL.  
Efficacy endpoints 
 
Primary: ORR (CR and PR) in ITT population according to investigator assessment  
  Secondary: PFS and OS 
Tumour assessment was performed at the end of the second cycle and every two cycles thereafter. 
Patients could receive up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression.  
Patient population 
Eligible patients with aggressive NHL could have received 0 to 3 prior regimens of chemotherapy 
containing an anthracycline/anthracenedione and must have been potentially sensitive to them, i.e., 
either previously responsive to but relapsed after a disease progression-free interval ≥ 6 months or 
never received an anthracycline/anthracenedione. 
The median age of patients was 65 years and 54% were male. The majority of patients had DLBCL 
(73%), low-high IPI, advanced stages of the disease and had received at least two prior chemotherapy 
regimens with a median anthracycline cumulative dose of 300 mg/m2. Of note 21% of patients had 
mantle cell lymphoma.  
Results 
33 patients were enrolled and treated with at least one dose of pixantrone. Only 6 patients completed 
the study (6 cycles) and 23 discontinued because of disease progression (n=19) or toxicity (n=4). The 
results are summarized below:

Study PIX-203 
This was an open label, randomised, multicenter, comparative Phase II study. The primary objective 
was to compare the response rate of CPOP-R (cyclophosphamide, pixantrone, vincristine and 
prednisone + rituximab) regimen against the standard CHOP-R (cyclophosphamide, doxorrubicin, 
vincristine and prednisone + rituximab) and to show the response rate for CPOP-R was not inferior to 
CHOP-R in patients with Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). 
Patient population 
Patients aged  18 years with untreated and histologically confirmed CD20 positive DLBCL according to 
the REAL/WHO classification and of stage II, III or IV . Adequate organ function and ECOG 
performance status  2 were inclusion criteria required. 
124 patients were randomised (1:1): 61 in CPOP-R arm and 63 in CHOP-R arm 
The total planned sample had originally been 280 patients but the study was terminated earlier for 
business reasons. 
Treatments 
All patients were due to be administered 4 cycles of CPOP-R or CHOP-R (21 day cycle) followed by 4 
additional cycles if following cycle 4 a partial response was recorded or 2 further cycles if a complete 
response had been recorded. 
o  CPOP-R arm 
Day 1: Cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 IV, pixantrone 150 mg/m2 IV, vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 IV  and

Tumours were assessed with CT, spiral CT or MRI scans at baseline, after cycle 4, at the end of 
treatment (EOT), every 3 months for 1 year after EOT, every 6 months for 24 months thereafter and 
at any time disease progression was suspected. The disease response was determined by an 
independent assessment panel (IAP). 
Patients who discontinued treatment were followed up for 36 months after EOT.  
Endpoints 
Primary:  
CR/Cru rate by IAP  
Secondary: 
OS, PFS, ORR, duration of response and TTF (time to treatment failure) 
As only 124 patients were enrolled in the study instead of the planned 280, this study was not powered 
to detect statistical significance. The primary analysis was based on ITT population. 
Results 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced across both treatment arms.  
o  CR/CRu 
The CR/CRu rate for the CPOP-R arm was 72% (24 patients [39%] with CR and 20 [33%] with CRu) 
compared to 79% for the CHOP-R arm (28 patients [44%] with CR and 22 [35%] with CRu).  
o  ORR 
In the CPOP-R arm the ORR was 82% (24 patients [39%] with CR, 20 [33%] with CRu, and 6 [10%] 
with PR) compared to 87% for the CHOP-R arm (28 patients [44%] with CR, 22 [35%] with CRu, and 5 
[8%] with PR).  
o  PFS 
PFS results were HR 1.03 (95% CI 0.55, 1.91) and p value 0.93. 
o  OS was better for patients in CHOP-R arm compared to CPOP-R arm with a HR of 2.34 (95% CI 
1.05, 5.22; p= 0.032.) 
o  Duration of response was not reached for either arm 
o  TTF was not reached for CPOP-R arm and was 15.1 months for CHOP-R arm. 
The study was terminated early, so did not have power to detect noninferiority using the original 
assumptions of the primary endpoint analysis failed its primary objective. From the efficacy point of 
view no further conclusions can be drawn for the purpose of this application as pixantrone was 
administered with a different dose and time schedule, in a different target population of untreated 
patients and in combination with other medicinal products against the first line standard treatment of 
CHOP-R regimen

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The pivotal study was designed to compare pixantrone as single agent for six cycles versus physician’s 
choice of protocol specified single agent therapies in aggressive NHL with at least two prior therapies. 
The enrolled patients are representative of the target population and overall both groups were 
balanced.  
The choice of single arm comparator from a pre-specified list was considered acceptable.  
The choice of CR as primary endpoint is not considered acceptable for a single phase III trial and PFS 
or overall survival would have been more appropriate. Looking at the positive results of pixantrone in 
the heavily pretreated population on study, this point is not of major concern. The primary analysis 
was met for the primary endpoint at the end of treatment phase and also at the end of the follow up 
but not in other analysis by investigator assessment or histological confirmed population. However, 
PFS showed consistent statistical significance favouring pixantrone across all analysis and other 
variables that did not reach statistical significance also favoured pixantrone except for time to response 
which was equal in both groups. 
The study was stopped to enrolment by the sponsor in March 2008 due to slow recruitment, nearly 9 
months prior to the analysis being conducted in November 2008. Database cut-off for the primary 
analyses occurred on 30 September 2008, after the last patient completed the end of treatment (EOT) 
visit. During that time, there were no plans to continue the study. All activities were focused on 
completion of data collection, data cleaning, and preparing for final analysis. Based upon the above 
information, the efficacy analysis conducted met the definition of a final analysis and not an interim 
analysis. 
It has been confirmed that the sponsor remained blinded when these decisions were being taken and it 
is appropriate to accept the analyses provided as final with no need to adjust for the type I error.   
Modern treatment strategies of aggressive lymphoma generally include rituximab upfront and the 
consideration of high dose chemotherapy followed by a stem cell transplant in eligible patients. This 
means that almost all patients suffering from a second or later relapse in Europe have been exposed to 
rituximab, and eligible patients also to a stem cell transplant. In the PIX301 study, only approximately 
55% of patients were previously treated with rituximab and 15% had undergone transplantation, with 
a marked geographically skewed distribution as the corresponding fractions in the Western Europe/US 
and Rest of world regions are 91% vs 37% and 28% vs 8%, respectively.  
Response rates to pixantrone were superior to comparator irrespective of prior rituximab use (32% vs. 
18%, 50% vs. 10% pixantrone vs. comparator, with and without prior rituximab respectively).  
An evaluation of these data by the number of regimens patients had received prior to study entry 
showed small impact of prior rituximab therapy on the treatment effect in patients who received 2 
prior lines of therapy (50% vs. 0%, 50% vs. 13.3%, pixantrone vs. comparator with and without prior 
rituximab use). Similar results were observed with patients who received 3 prior lines of therapy (40% 
vs. 18.8%, 44.4% vs. 6.3%, pixantrone vs. comparator, with or without prior rituximab use).  
With increasing numbers of prior regimens there was a decrease in the response rate to pixantrone. 
This is most apparent in patients who received 4 or more prior regimens (i.e. use of pixantrone as 5th 
line therapy). Nearly all patients (27/28) who received 4 or more prior regimens had also received 
prior rituximab. As all but one pixantrone patient with 4 or more prior regimens had received prior 
rituximab, it is not possible to evaluate the effect of prior treatment with rituximab versus the 
expected diminished response rates seen in patients treated after 4 or more prior regimens. An 
imbalance in the prior rituximab population with 4 or more prior lines of therapy received was seen in 
Pixuvri 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev10.11 
Page 60/85
 
 
 
favour of the comparator (11/13 pixantrone patients were refractory versus 9/14 refractory patients in 
the comparator).  
Although the outcome was not as favourable as in the patients without prior rituximab the PFS was still 
more favourable in the pixantrone arm versus the comparator arm regardless of prior rituximab use, 
particularly in patients with only two prior regimens. These data support the efficacy of pixantrone in 
patients that have received prior rituximab and up to 3 prior treatment regimens. 
The subgroup analysis data show that the advantage of pixantrone over comparator detected in the 
ITT population is lower in the group of patients pre-treated with rituximab and diminishes further with 
increasing number of prior regimens. The results seen for Western European patients are explained 
partly by more heavily pre-treated patients and, importantly, by a higher prevalence of prior rituximab 
therapy. Still, in the group of pre-treated patients with rituximab, pixantrone shows a numerically 
better effect than the comparator in patients pre-treated with up to 3 regimens. This benefit needs to 
be further confirmed by a phase III study. The indication has been reworded with the statement 
“benefit of pixantrone treatment has not been established in patients when used as fifth line or greater 
chemotherapy in patients who are refractory to last therapy”. This proposed indication reflects the 
available data and is considered acceptable. 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA 
Response rates to pixantrone were superior to comparator irrespective of prior rituximab use, however 
the benefit of pixuvri in patients that had received prior treatment with rituximab was not as 
favourable as in the patients without prior rituximab. Therefore additional efficacy data is needed in 
the context of a conditional MA to further confirm the benefit of pixuvri in the subgroup of pre-treated 
patients with rituximab. 
The applicant shall provide the comprehensive clinical data from the Phase III study PIX 306 where 
pixantrone in combination with rituximab is compared with gemcitabine in combination with rituximab. 
The study patient population includes patients with the NHL type of Diffuse Large B cell Lymphoma or 
Follicular grade III Lymphoma who had previously been treated with at least one rituximab containing 
multiagent regimen. This study will support the efficacy of pixuvri in patients that had already received 
prior rituximab. The results from study PIX 306 are expected to be available in Q.2 2015. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy of Pixuvri has been shown in the approved indication of treatment in monotherapy of adult 
patients with multiply relapsed or refractory aggressive Non Hodgkin B cell Lymphomas (NHL). The 
benefit of pixantrone treatment has not been established in patients when used as fifth line or greater 
chemotherapy in patients who are refractory to last therapy. 
In view of the smaller benefit in patients previously treated with rituximab, the CHMP considers the 
following measure necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the context of a conditional MA: 
o  The results of study PIX 306 should be submitted to further confirm the benefit of Pixuvri in 
patients that had received prior treatment with rituximab.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Twelve clinical studies were completed and safety was evaluated in all of them providing a safety 
population of 407 cancer patients, including 345 patients with NHL. 
In total 348 patients received pixantrone: 129 in uncontrolled single agent studies, 68 in the controlled 
single study (PIX301) and 151 in combination therapy studies. 
In the pixantrone arm of the pivotal study, the mean and median number of cycles received was 
higher (≥ 3 cycles) than in the uncontrolled single-agent studies and the dose showed less variability 
than in any other studies (mean 82.4 mg/m2). Dose reductions were infrequent in both treatment 
groups (18% pixantrone vs 15% comparator). More patients in the pixantrone group required a dose 
delay (40% vs 22%), but the majority of delays affected one dose only. Only one patient missed a 
dose (pixantrone arm). 
Additional safety data come from study PIX 203 with 124 patients with NHL of whom 61 received 
pixantrone as part of a combination chemotherapy (CPOP-Rituximab) at a dose of 150 mg/m2 IV on 
day 1 of a 21 day cycle. 
Adverse events 
AE by System Organ Class 
Practically all patients that received pixantrone experienced AE. The most frequent AE were seen in the 
blood (mainly neutropaenia), gastrointestinal and respiratory systems as well as general disorders (see 
table 21).

The incidence of AE grade 3 or 4 was lower in the comparator arm of the pivotal study compared to 
pixantrone. Again, in line with the overall profile neutropaenia and leucopaenia were the most common 
grade 3/4 AE reported (41 % and 23% respectively in the pixantrone arm). 
The main differences in common AE between pixantrone and comparator were: 
Neutropaenia (50% vs 23%) 
 
Leucopaenia (25% vs 10.4%) 
  Asthaenia (23.5% vs 13.4%) 
 
Infections (42.6% vs 28.4%) 
  Ejection fraction decreased (19.1% vs 10.4%) 
  Anorexia (11.8% vs 6%) 
  Neoplasm progression (1.5% vs 13.4%) 
  Cough (22.1% vs 4.5%) 
  Skin discolouration (10.3% vs 0%) 
Skin discolouration disappears over few days to weeks as the drug is cleared. 
The higher incidence of respiratory AEs, mostly grade 1-2 cough and dyspnoea, may have been 
associated with pixantrone itself or administration of the drug in 500 mL of saline over 1 hour. It is 
recommended the total volume of saline in the pixantrone infusion should be 250 mL administered IV 
over 1 hour. 
Treatment related AE 
Consistent with the overall AE profile, the most common treatment-related AEs across single agent 
studies were neutropenia, leucopoenia and anaemia.  
Treatment-related AEs were reported by a greater proportion of patients in the pixantrone arm (81%) 
than the comparator arm (57%) of PIX301. It is important to note that blood counts were performed 
on days 1, 8, and 15 per protocol in the pixantrone patients, but only on day 1 in 52% of patients 
treated in the comparator arm, possibly resulting in under-reporting of haematopoietic AEs in 
comparator patients.  
The main differences between pixantrone and comparator in the pivotal study were in line with the 
overall AE reported: 
  Neutropaenia (48.5% vs 22.4%) 
 
Leucopaenia (25% vs 10.4%) 
  Ejection fraction decreased (19.1% vs 4.5%) 
  Skin discolouration (10.3% vs 0%)

Cardiac AE (pivotal study PIX 301) 
Cardiac toxicity was closely monitored in the pivotal study. 
Cardiac assessments of LVEF (MUGA scan), echocardiography and serum troponin T at baseline, on 
cycles 2 and 4, and end of treatment were conducted together with regular ECG. LVEF and serum 
troponin were also measured during follow up. 
All patients had received previous anthracyclines/anthrazediones at equivalent doses. The only 
difference was that patients in pixantrone arm had higher incidence of prior congestive heart failure 
and cardiomyopathy whilst those in the comparator had a higher incidence of arrythmias. 
At baseline 55% patients had LVEF grade 1 abnormalities, 3% had grade 2 and none were grade 3.

The mean cumulative prior anthracycline doses for patients in the pixantrone arm were 285 mg/m2 
and the mean normalized pixantrone doses administered during the trial were 822 mg/m2 (242 mg/m2 
doxorubicin equivalent). 
A summary of cardiac AE is shown below. Most events were of grade toxicity 1 or 2.

* All toxicity grade 1/ 2 except 2 patients in pixantrone group of grade 3 
Looking at treatment- related cardiac events there were 9 cardiac events related to pixantrone (13%) 
and all were asymptomatic decreases in ejection fraction. Including all events considered likely or 
possibly related to pixantrone therapy, there were 14 cardiac events reported by 13/68 patients 
(19%), including 2 possible cases of congestive heart failure (CHF) associated with pixantrone therapy. 
Only one patient in the comparator arm (1.5%) had a treatment related cardiac event (LVEF 
decrease).   
There was no demonstrable relationship between cumulative pixantrone dose to symptomatic declines 
in LVEF or CHF, nor was a relationship seen with prior doxorubicin equivalent cumulative exposure. 
According to the independent review, data from the literature show that cardiac events in patients 
treated with doxorubicin at a similar cumulative total dose included a clear higher incidence of CHF. 
At baseline troponin levels were higher in pixantrone arm than comparator and during study more 
pixantrone patients developed asymptomatic increases. However, these abnormalities were not 
predictive of clinically manifest cardiac events. All troponin abnormalities resolved by the 6 month 
follow-up except in one patient in the pixantrone arm. 
Additional safety data from Study PIX 203 showed the overall safety profile between both treatment 
arms was similar. However, it was shown that  when pixantrone is substituted for doxorubicin as part 
of a CHOP-Rituximab like regimen, it is associated with fewer cases of CHF, LVEF decreases of at least 
20% and troponin T elevations. 
No other relevant events were seen in all other safety studies.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
SAEs 
Approximately half of patients receiving single agent pixantrone experienced SAEs. In the PIX301 
study, SAEs more common in the pixantrone arm included infections and infestations (21% vs 17%), 
septic shock (3% vs 0%), and cardiac disorders (9% vs 4.5%). Acute respiratory distress syndrome 
(n=1) and pneumonitis (n=2) were reported in the pixantrone group only and the applicant will be 
requested to comment on the possible relation to the study drug. SAEs more common in the 
comparator group included malignant neoplasm progression (2% vs 13%), thrombocytopenia (1.5% vs 
9%), and gastrointestinal disorders (6% vs 10%). SAEs due to neutropenia were reported slightly 
more in the pixantrone arm (13% vs 9%) as was febrile neutropenia (6% vs 3%). Two patients with 
neutropenic fever were reported in the uncontrolled studies. As could be expected, a substantially 
higher fraction of patients in the combination therapy studies had SAEs due to neutropenia and 
neutropenic fever (34% and 13%, respectively).

By system organ class, more patients in the pixantrone arm were reported with cardiac, vascular, and 
respiratory/thoracic disorders leading to death, and more patients in the comparator arm with 
neoplasms and renal disorders leading to death. In the uncontrolled single agent studies, 4/59 (7%) 
and 11/70 (16%) patients were reported to experience treatment-emergent AEs resulting in death in 
the NHL and other malignancies studies, respectively.

The majority of deaths within 30 days of last study treatment were stated to be related to the patient’s 
underlying NHL. One death in the pixantrone group was considered related to treatment (a 29 years 
old female, who died of septic shock on study day 8). None of the deaths within 30 days of last study 
treatment in the comparator group were considered related to treatment. 
Three deaths that occurred more than 30 days after the last study treatment were considered related 
to treatment; one patient died from acute congestive heart failure and one from MDS in the pixantrone 
arm, and one patient died from renal failure in the comparator arm. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology  
Reversible neutropaenia and leukopaenia are the predominant manifestations of pixantrone 
hematologic toxicity. Thrombocytopenia and anaemia were also observed but at lower frequency and 
severity. 
In PIX 301 complete blood counts were conducted during treatment with pixantrone every week whilst 
in more than half of the comparator it was only done every 3 weeks. Mean duration of treatment was 
one month longer for the pixantrone arm.  The most relevant haematological events were as follows 
(pixantrone vs comparator): 
  Neutropaenia (50% vs 23.9%) [grade 3-4: 41.2% vs 19.4%] 
Pixuvri 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev10.11 
Page 70/85
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Anaemia (30.9% vs 32.8%) [grade 3-4: 5.9% vs 13.4%] 
 
 
Thrombocytopaenia (20.6% vs 19.4%) [grade 3-4: 11.8% vs 10.4%] 
Febrile neutropaenia (8.8% vs 3%) [grade 3-4: 7.4% vs 3%] 
More patients in the pixantrone group received growth factor support (51.5% vs 26.9%) and no 
relevant differences were seen in blood or platelet transfusions. Growth factor support was not 
routinely given as it was left up to investigator’s judgement. 
Neutropaenia reaches nadir on days 15-20 of each cycle and recovery normally occurs by day 28. 
Most grade 4 neutropaenias were observed after cycles 1 and 2 (10% and 15%) respectively and 
frequency declined with subsequent cycles (9% after cycle 3, 8% after cycle 4). Observation after the 
last two cycles and EOT or beyond revealed less than a 5% frequency. Complications of severe 
neutropenia including febrile neutropaenia were uncommon in both study arms.  
Infections were common across all study groups although the incidence of systemic sepsis and 
opportunistic systemic infections was low. In the pivotal study the pixantrone arm reported more 
infections than the comparator (42.6% vs 28.4% - grade 3/ 4 =18% vs 13%) and most of them were 
respiratory tract infections.  
In all pixantrone studies, urinary tract infection, oral candidiasis, upper respiratory tract infections 
including nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, pharyngitis and pneumonia were the most frequently observed 
AEs. 
Chemistry 
Abnormalities were in general similar across studies and between the two arms of the pivotal trial and 
grade 3 or 4 abnormalities were rare. 
The most common abnormalities in the pixantrone arm of the pivotal study were: 
- Hyperglycaemia (55.2%) 
- Hypomagnesaemia (40.8%) 
- Albumin changes (45.8%) 
Safety in special populations 
Paediatric population: 
Patients < age 18 were excluded from clinical trials. The safety and efficacy of Pixuvri in children aged 
< 18 years has therefore not been established and a statement has been included in section 4.2 of the 
SmPC. 
Hepatic insufficiency: 
Patients with significant hepatic impairment as evidenced by a baseline bilirubin ≥1.5 X ULN were 
excluded from clinical trials and severe abnormal hepatic function is a contraindication to the use of 
pixantrone.  
Renal insufficiency: 
Patients with significant renal impairment (creatinine ≥1.5 X ULN) were also excluded from clinical 
trials. Thus, pixantrone should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. 
Elderly patients: 
Pixuvri 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev10.11 
Page 71/85
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Febrile neutropenia, psychiatric disorders, vascular disorders and asthenia were more common in 
pixantrone-treated patients 65 years or older, as was the incidence of cardiac treatment-emergent AEs 
(but not of grade 3-4 or ejection fraction decline). Old patients suffered less from nausea. No specific 
dose adjustment is required in elderly patients (aged ≥ 65 years). 
Gender 
Compared to men, women treated with pixantrone had higher incidences of thrombocytopenia, 
neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and treatment-emergent grade 3-4 disorders of metabolism.  
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation: 
There are no data from the use of pixantrone in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity.  
Women of childbearing potential and their partners should be advised to avoid pregnancies. 
Women and men must therefore use effective contraception during and up to 24 weeks after 
treatment. Pixuvri is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not 
using contraception as indication in section 4.6 of the SmPC. 
It is unknown whether Pixuvri/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborn/infants 
cannot therefore be excluded and breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Pixuvri. 
After repeated administrations of Pixuvri at doses as low as 0.1 mg/kg/day, a dose-dependent 
testicular atrophy was detected in the dogs. This effect has not been evaluated in humans. As with 
other agents in the general class of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damaging agents, Pixuvri may be 
associated with fertility impairment. Whilst the effect on fertility has not been ascertained a precaution 
will be to advise male patients to use contraceptive methods (preferably barrier) during treatment and 
for a period of 6 months post-treatment to allow new sperm to mature. To avoid the risk of long term 
infertility sperm banking should be considered. 
Patients with poor performance status 
There is currently no information on the safety and efficacy of patients with poor performance status 
(ECOG > 2). Caution should be exercised when treating such patients. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No drug-drug interaction studies have been submitted and no drug interactions have been reported in 
human subjects.

Slightly more patients were withdrawn due to AEs in the pixantrone arm (43% vs 37%). Most common 
AEs leading to withdrawal in the pixantrone arm were neutropenia (10%), cardiac disorders and 
asthenia (both 7%); two patients were withdrawn due to hepatobiliary disorders, none for renal failure. 
In the comparator arm, 9% of patients were withdrawn because of malignant neoplasm progression, 2 
patients for renal failure, and none for hepatobiliary disorders; withdrawal due to cardiac disorder or 
neutropenia was uncommon (one patient in each category). 
Post marketing experience 
N/A 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety data from 12 clinical studies are available and a total of 348 patients received pixantrone, 
including 68 patients in the controlled pivotal study and 129 patients in uncontrolled single agent trials. 
The majority of patients in the pivotal trial received at least 4 cycles of treatment with the 
recommended dose.  
Practically all patients that received pixantrone experienced AEs. The type and incidence of AE 
correlated in general across all single agent studies and the most common AEs seen in the pivotal 
study were neutropaenia (50%), leucopaenia (25%), anaemia (31%), thrombocytopaenia (21%), 
asthenia (23%), pyrexia (23%), cough (22%), decreased ejection fraction (19%) and nausea (18%). 
Characteristic of pixantrone is a reversible skin discoloration.  
Analysis of treatment related AEs still showed neutropaenia as the most common AE (49%) and it was 
the main AE leading to discontinuation from the pivotal study (10%). Haematological side effects were 
also the most common associated with grade 3 or 4 toxicity. With the recommended dose and 
schedule, neutropenia is usually transient, reaching its nadir on days 15-22 following administration on 
days 1, 8, and 15 with recovery usually occurring by day 28.  
No cases of overdose have been reported with Pixuvri. Single doses of pixantrone base up to 
158 mg/m2 have been given in dose-escalation clinical trials without evidence of dose-related toxicity. 
Thrombocytopenia and anaemia were of lower frequency and severity than neutropaenia and there 
were no differences in blood or platelet transfusions between treatment groups. Most grade 4 
Pixuvri 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev10.11 
Page 73/85
 
 
 
 
neutropenias were observed after cycles 1 and 2 and frequency declined with subsequent cycles. Of 
note complications of severe neutropenia including febrile neutropenia were uncommon and growth 
factor support was left at the discretion of the investigator. 
Careful monitoring of blood counts is required, including leukocyte, red blood cells, platelet and 
absolute neutrophil counts. Recombinant hematopoietic growth factors may be used according to 
institutional or European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines and dose modifications 
should be considered. The use of Pixantrone dimaleate is contraindicated in the case of profound bone 
marrow suppression. 
Cardiac toxicity was closely monitored in the pivotal study and a higher incidence of cardiac events was 
seen in the pixantrone group (35% vs 21%).Only 9 cases of cardiac events were considered related to 
pixantrone (13%) and all were asymptomatic decreases of ejection fraction. Overall events observed 
were relatively mild and asymptomatic and there were no clear cases of pixantrone-associated CHF as 
typically described in the literature for other anthracyclines.  There was no demonstrable relationship 
between cumulative pixantrone dose to symptomatic declines in LVEF or CHF, nor was a relationship 
seen with prior doxorubicin equivalent cumulative exposure. 
Changes in cardiac function including decreased LVEF or fatal congestive heart failure (CHF) may occur 
during or after treatment with Pixuvri.  
Additional data from study PIX-203 has shown that when pixantrone is substituted for doxorubicin as 
part of a CHOP-Rituximab like regimen, it is associated with fewer cases of CHF, LVEF decreases of at 
least 20% and troponin T elevations.  
Active or dormant cardiovascular disease, prior therapy with anthracyclines or anthracenediones, prior 
or concurrent radiotherapy to the mediastinal area or concurrent use of other cardiotoxic medicinal 
products may increase the risk of cardiac toxicity. Cardiac toxicity with Pixuvri may occur whether or 
not cardiac risk factors are present. 
Patients with cardiac disease or risk factors such as a baseline LVEF value of < 45% by multigated 
radionuclide (MUGA) scan, clinically significant cardiovascular abnormalities (equal to New York Heart 
Association (NYHA) grade III or IV), myocardial infarction within the last 6 months, severe arrhythmia, 
uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled angina, or prior cumulative doses of doxorubicin or equivalent 
exceeding 450 mg/m2 should receive careful risk versus benefit consideration before receiving 
treatment with Pixuvri. 
Cardiac function should be monitored before initiation of treatment with Pixuvri and periodically 
thereafter. If cardiac toxicity is demonstrated during treatment, the risk versus benefit of continued 
therapy with Pixuvri must be evaluated. 
The occurrence of secondary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a 
well described complication of chemotherapy regimens containing anthracyclines and other 
topoisomerase II inhibitors.  
Infections, including pneumonia, cellulitis, bronchitis and sepsis have been reported during clinical 
trials. Infections have been associated with hospitalisation, septic shock and death. Patients with 
neutropenia are more susceptible to infections, although in the clinical studies there was no increased 
incidence of atypical, difficult to treat infections, such as systemic mycotic infections or infections with 
opportunistic organisms such as Pneumocystis jiroveci. 
Pixuvri should not be administered to patients with an active, severe infection or in patients with a 
history of recurring or chronic infections or with underlying conditions which may further predispose 
them to serious infection.  
Pixuvri 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev10.11 
Page 74/85
 
 
 
Pixantrone may induce hyperuricaemia as a consequence of the extensive purine catabolism that 
accompanies drug-induced rapid lysis of neoplastic cells (tumour-lysis syndrome) and can lead to 
electrolyte imbalances which can result in kidney damage. Blood uric acid levels, potassium, calcium 
phosphate and creatinine should be evaluated after treatment in patients at high risk for tumour lysis 
(elevated LDH, high tumour volume, high baseline uric acid or serum phosphate levels). Hydration, 
urine alkalinisation, and prophylaxis with allopurinol or other agents to prevent hyperuricaemia may 
minimise potential complications of tumour lysis syndrome. 
Immunisation may be ineffective when given during Pixuvri therapy. Immunisation with live virus 
vaccines is contraindicated due to the immunosuppression associated with Pixuvri therapy. 
If extravasation occurs the administration should be stopped immediately and restarted in another 
vein. The non-vesicant properties of Pixuvri minimise the risk of local reaction following extravasation.  
Photosensitivity is a theoretical risk based on in vitro data and no confirmed cases have been reported 
in the clinical trial program. As a precaution, patients should be advised to follow sun protection 
strategies, including wearing sun protective clothing and using sunscreen. Since most medicinal 
product-induced photosensitivity reactions are caused by wavelengths within the UV-A range, 
sunscreen that strongly absorbs UV-A is recommended. 
The applicant has confirmed that an in vivo phototoxicity study will be conducted to clarify this point. 
It is not known whether pixantrone has an effect on the ability to drive a car or use machines. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA 
None required 
Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The clinical safety profile of pixuvri in the proposed indication is acceptable. 
The CHMP considers the following measure necessary to address issues related to safety: 
o  The applicant should conduct a non clinical in vivo phototoxicity study to address the 
theoretical risk of photosensitivity. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the 
legislative requirements and provides adequate evidence that the applicant has the services of a 
qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance and has the necessary means for the notification of 
any adverse reaction suspected of occurring either in the Community or in a third country. 
The applicant must ensure that the system of pharmacovigilance is in place and functioning before the 
product is placed on the market.

2.8.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
There is currently no approved treatment or standard of care for patients with aggressive NHL that had 
relapsed two or more times after other therapies. Cure is normally not expected in this patient 
population and the probability of responding to therapy with a durable effect is very small. Pixantrone 
has been developed to address this medical need. 
The pivotal study was designed to compare pixantrone as single agent for six cycles versus physician’s 
choice of protocol specified single agent therapies in aggressive NHL with at least two prior therapies. 
The enrolled patients are representative of the target population.   
The primary analysis was met for the primary endpoint at the end of treatment and also at the end of 
the follow up. PFS (secondary endpoint) showed consistent statistical significance favouring pixantrone 
across all analysis. Overall survival (secondary endpoint) was prolonged with pixantrone treatment 
although no statistical significant difference was observed. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
The advantage of pixantrone over comparator detected in the ITT population is lower in the group of 
patients pre-treated with rituximab and diminishes further with increasing number of prior regimens. 
Pixantrone showed to be more active than the comparator in the group of patients pretreated with up 
to 3 regimens, including rituximab. However, the benefit in this subset needs to be further confirmed 
in view of the low number of patients. 
There is a lack of data on black patients but from the PK/PD point of view no relevant clinical difference 
is expected. The lack of data in this group of patients has been addressed in the RMP. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Overall the data are  considered sufficient for the assessment of the safety profile of Pixuvri in the 
proposed indication. 
Bone marrow suppression is the most frequent and severe toxicity associated with pixantrone 
treatment. Neutropaenia is the predominant manifestation whilst thrombocytopenia and anaemia 
occurred at less frequency and severity. More patients in pixantrone arm received growth factor 
support compared to comparator but blood or platelet transfusions were similar to comparator. 
Neutropaenia reaches nadir on days 15-20 of each cycle and recovery normally occurs by day 28. Most 
Pixuvri 
CHMP assessment report  
Rev10.11 
Page 79/85
 
 
 
 
 
grade 4 neutropaenias were observed after cycles 1 and 2 and frequency declined with subsequent 
cycles. Complications of severe neutropenia including febrile neutropaenia seem uncommon. 
Neutropaenia is the main cause for discontinuation of treatment.  
Infections were common but the incidence of systemic sepsis and opportunistic systemic infections was 
low. 
Cardiac toxicity was closely monitored in the pivotal study and a higher incidence of cardiac events was 
seen in the pixantrone group. However, only 9 cases of cardiac events were considered related to 
pixantrone (13%) and all were asymptomatic decreases of ejection fraction. Overall events observed 
were relatively mild and asymptomatic and there were no clear cases of pixantrone-associated CHF as 
typically described in the literature for other anthracyclines.  
There was no demonstrable relationship between cumulative pixantrone dose to symptomatic declines 
in LVEF or CHF, nor was a relationship seen with prior doxorubicin equivalent cumulative exposure. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Patients with significant hepatic or renal impairment were excluded from the clinical trials. This lack of 
data is reflected by appropriate wording in the SmPC and the proposed RMP. 
The clinical implication of a positive non-clinical phototoxicity assay is undetermined. Although no clear 
clinically significant photosensitisation was observed in the safety database, phototoxicity may be a 
rare condition and it is concluded that a non-clinical in vivo study should be performed post approval. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Given the lack of standard of care and the poor prognosis for patients with multiple relapses/refractory 
aggressive NHL the improvement seen in CR/CRu, supported by the results of secondary endpoints of 
PFS and OS in the pivotal study is considered meaningful and of clinical relevance.  
Although haematological toxicity was the main manifestation of pixantrone it is reversible. Cardiac 
toxicity is seen at lower frequency and with an apparent less severity than that reported with other 
anthracyclines.  
Benefit-risk balance 
The favourable effect seen in terms of CR/CRu, supported by the results of secondary endpoints of PFS 
and OS in the full study population outweighs the risks associated with pixantrone therapy.  
Additional efficacy data are needed to confirm the benefit of pixuvri in patients that had received prior 
treatment with rituximab. The applicant shall  provide the comprehensive clinical data from the Phase 
III study PIX 306 where pixantrone in combination with rituximab is compared with gemcitabine in 
combination with rituximab.  
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Benefit/risk is considered favourable but there is limited data in the group of patients pretreated with 
rituximab. The available data has shown a better efficacy outcome of pixantrone over comparator in 
patients pretreated with rituximab and who have received up to 3 prior treatments. However, it is 
Pixuvri 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 80/85

acknowledged that data in this subgroup of patients is limited. Therefore, a conditional approval is 
recommended pending the results from Study PIX 306 to support the efficacy of Pixuvri in patients that 
had received prior rituximab therapy. 
Following consultation with the applicant, the CHMP considered the granting of a conditional marketing 
authorisation  pixantrone.    Pixantrone  aims  at  the  treatment  of  seriously  debilitating  diseases  or  life-
threatening diseases and falls within the scope of Commission Regulation 507/2006 on the conditional 
marketing  authorisation.  The  Committee  found  that  although  comprehensive  clinical  data  referring  to 
the  efficacy  of  the  medicinal  product  had  not  been  supplied,  all  of  the  following  requirements  were 
met: 
 
The risk-benefit balance of the medicinal product, as defined in Article 1(28a) of Directive 
2001/83/EC, is positive. 
Based on the randomized controlled study presented in patients with multiply relapsed or refractory 
aggressive NHL (study PIX 301), the favourable effect seen in terms of CR/CRu, supported by the 
results of secondary endpoints of PFS and OS in the full study population outweighs the risks 
associated with pixantrone therapy.  
 
It is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide comprehensive clinical data. 
From  a  quantitative  point,  of  view,  the  benefit  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  previously  treated  with 
rituximab  might  be  less  as  compared  with  what  was  observed  in  patients  that  had  not  received  prior 
rituximab  treatment.  However,  the  efficacy  of  Pixuvri  in  patients  that  had  received  prior  rituximab 
therapy and up to 3 prior regimens was still superior to the comparator. In Europe most patients that 
had  multiple  relapse  or  are  refractory  to  treatments  are  expected  to  have  received  prior  rituximab. 
Therefore there is a need to further confirm the efficacy of Pixuvri in patients previously treated with 
rituximab.  
Comprehensive clinical data will be provided through a Phase III study PIX 306 where pixantrone in 
combination with rituximab is compared with gemcitabine in combination with rituximab. The study 
patient population includes patients with the NHL type of Diffuse Large B cell Lymphoma or Follicular 
grade III lymphoma who had previously been treated with at least one rituximab containing multiagent 
regimen. This study will support the efficacy of pixuvri in patients that had received prior rituximab of 
the phase III Study PIX 301. The results from study PIX 306 are likely to be available in Q2 2015. 
  Unmet medical needs to be fulfilled. 
There is a lack of approved and standard of care pharmacological treatment for patients with multiply 
relapsed or refractory aggressive NHL and there is a need in this patient population that could be 
fulfilled with the proposed medicinal product. The CHMP concluded that the product fulfils an unmet 
medical need due to the lack of available alternative treatments in this population. 
 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product 
concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. 
The CHMP considered that the potential risks inherent in marketing pixuvri for the specific indication, 
while additional, more comprehensive data will be available in the future, would be offset by the 
potential benefit to the patients. The CHMP agreed that the RMP for pixuvri in the approved indication 
was adequate to address any identified and unknown risks.

The CHMP concluded that all the requirements for the granting of a conditional marketing authorisation 
had been met.  
4. Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus decision is of the opinion that Pixuvri is not similar to Torisel within the 
meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.  
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by majority 
decision that the risk-benefit balance of Pixuvri in “the treatment of adult patients with multiply 
relapsed or refractory aggressive Non-Hodgkin B-cell Lymphomas (NHL). The benefit of pixantrone 
treatment has not been established in patients when used as fifth line or greater chemotherapy in 
patients who are refractory to last therapy.”

To conduct a randomised controlled Phase 3 study (PIX306) of pixantrone-
rituximab vs gemcitabine-rituximab in patients with aggressive B-cell NHL, who 
failed front line CHOP-R who are not eligible for autologous stem cell transplant 
(ASCT) (2nd line) or failed ASCT (3rd or 4th line). A clinical study report should be 
submitted. 
Due date 
30 June 2015 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
to be implemented by the Member States. 
Not applicable. 
Divergent position(s) to the majority recommendation are appended to this report. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of data on the quality, non-clinical and clinical properties of the active 
substance, the CHMP considers that pixantrone (as dimaleate) is to be qualified as a new active 
substance.

DIVERGENT POSITION EXPRESSED BY CHMP MEMBERS 
The benefit in terms of CR and PFS is driven by patients treated in “rest of the world”. 
No benefit has been demonstrated for target population relevant for the clinical practice in Western 
Europe: No clear benefit for pixantrone over comparator is demonstrated for patients with previous 
treatment with anti-CD20 or stem cell transplant and most importantly, patients in treated in North 
America or Western Europe.  
The study results observed in patients treated in “rest of the world” cannot be extrapolated to the 
Western European population because the population differed clearly in baseline characteristics, e.g. 
age, performance status, histology, relevant prior treatments, including rituximab use and stem cell 
transplantation, and refractoriness to prior treatments.  
The safety profile – based on the very limited data base is unfavourable compared to the reference 
treatment options.  
In terms of efficacy no benefit for pixantrone over comparator is demonstrated for patients <65 years, 
male gender, previous treatment with anti-CD20 or stem cell transplant or ≥3 chemo regimens, and 
most importantly, patients in “North America” or “Western Europe”. Therefore, based on the limited 
data presented, the benefit-risk ratio is deemed to be negative. 
Considerations on conditional approval 
Albeit it is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data and it is not theoretically 
excluded that pixantrone may have the potential to fulfil an unmet medical need in patients with 
multiply relapsed or refractory aggressive NHL, two prerequisites of article 2 as of CD 507/2006 are 
not met:  
1.  The risk-benefit balance of the product is not positive but negative (see above). 
2.  The benefits to public health of the immediate availability do not outweigh the risks inherent in 
the fact that additional data are still required. Rather, immediate availability of the medicinal 
product on the European market will hamper the clarification of relevant scientific questions 
such as the benefit in a (Western) European population. 
Overall conclusion 
Based on the data submitted the benefit-risk ratio of Pixivuri in “the treatment of adult patients with 
multiply relapsed or refractory aggressive Non-Hodgkin B-cell Lymphomas (NHL). The benefit of 
pixantrone treatment has not been established in patients when used as fifth line or greater 
chemotherapy in patients who are refractory to last therapy.” is negative. Neither a full nor a 
conditional approval is an option. The MAA has to be rejected.

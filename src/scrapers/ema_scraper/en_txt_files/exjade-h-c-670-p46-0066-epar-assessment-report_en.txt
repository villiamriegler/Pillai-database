1.  Introduction 
On 30 September 2015, the MAH submitted one completed paediatric study for Exjade (observational), 
in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that this study is a stand alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
This  was  a  phase  IV,  non-interventional,  observational  study.  Patients  were  treated  with  an  oral  iron 
chelator  according  to  the  investigator's  judgment  and  in  accordance  with  the  local  prescribing 
information.  Treatment  included  commercially  available  Exjade,  which  is  brand  name  for  deferasirox 
and is presented as dispersible tablets in 3 doses strengths: 125, 250 and 500mg.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The  orally  active,  tridentate  iron  chelator  deferasirox  (company  research  code:  ICL670)  is  the  active 
ingredient  in  Exjade®  dispersible  tablets.  Exjade  is  currently  approved  in  over  100  countries.  In  the 
European  Union,  it  was  approved  on  28-Aug-2006  for  the  treatment  of  chronic  iron  overload  due  to 
frequent  blood  transfusions  (≥7  ml/kg/month  of  packed  red  blood  cells)  in  patients  with  beta 
thalassaemia major aged 6 years and older. 
EXJADE  is  also  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  chronic  iron  overload  due  to  blood  transfusions  when 
deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in the following patient groups: 
- in paediatric patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload due to frequent blood 
transfusions (≥7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) aged 2 to 5 years, 
-  in  adult  and  paediatric  patients  with  beta  thalassaemia  major  with  iron  overload  due  to 
infrequent  blood  transfusions  (<7  ml/kg/month  of  packed  red  blood  cells)  aged  2  years  and 
older, 
- in adult and paediatric patients with other anaemias aged 2 years and older. 
Since  20  December  2012,  Exjade  has  been  also  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  chronic  iron  overload 
requiring chelation therapy when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in patients 10 
years and older with nontransfusion- dependent thalassaemia syndromes. 
The MAH submitted the final report for this clinical study (observational) and a clinical overview of this 
study.

2.3.2.  Clinical study 
CICL670AUS38 : A 3 year, prospective, non-interventional multicentre 
registry in sickle cell disease patient  
Description 
This is a 3 year, prospective, multicentre, observational study (registry) which included adults and 
children (2-<18 years at enrolment) with SCD. The study was conducted in US to enhance the 
understanding of the disease patterns, current transfusion practices, treatment and document clinical 
outcomes in patients with SCD under current treatment practices. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
Primary objective 
 The primary objective for the study was to document clinical outcomes (number of crises, number of 
hospitalizations, and end organ damage) in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) under current 
treatment practices. 
Secondary objectives 
The secondary objectives included the following: 
 To document the current therapies used, transfusion practices, and use of chelation therapies for 
the treatment of SCD 
 To evaluate the difference in treatments between pediatric and adult patients 
 To assess the Quality of Life (QoL) by PedsQLTM Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory for patients aged 
2 to < 18 years, and by SF-36® Health Survey for patients aged ≥ 18 years 
 To evaluate the impact of disease in school and work absentee rates 
 To evaluate the correlation between 
o Pre-transfusion hemoglobin and patient outcomes; 
o Transfusion practices and patient outcome; 
o Chelation practices and patient outcome. 
Study design 
The recruitment target was 500 patients with HbSS, HbS/beta-thalassemia or HbSC and divided into 2 
cohorts :  
Cohort 1 (paediatric) : aged 2- <18 years-old 
Cohort 2 (adults) : aged >18 years-old 
The patients were followed for a maximum of 3 years. The study was initiated on January 13,2010 
(FPFV) and ended on September 30,2014 (LPLV). The study was conducted in 54 sites in US.

CHMP comment 
This is an observational study which is not designed to assess the efficacy of chelation therapy (in 
particular deferasirox). 
Study population /Sample size 
A total of 500 patients were planned to enroll into 2 cohorts. 
A total of 498 patients (317 patients aged 2 to less than 18 years and 181 patients aged 18 years 
and older) were enrolled in this study, all were analyzed. 
Inclusion criteria 
 Male or female patients with HbSS, HbS/beta-thalassemia, or HbSC 
 Patients must be aged ≥ 2 years 
 Patients or legal guardians must provide a written informed consent, and pediatric assent where 
indicated 
Exclusion criteria 
 Patients with Sickle Cell trait (HbAS) 
 Patient or legal guardians unable or unwilling to give consent or pediatric assent where indicated 
Treatments 
There were no particular treatment or drug given to patients and there were no predefined treatment 
groups. No clinical or laboratory assessments were performed other than those required for disease 
management according to local best practice. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Statistical Methods 
Sample size 
The sample size of this study was not based on any statistical considerations. It was based on the 
feasibility to achieve a broad representation of SCD patients within a reasonable enrollment period. 
Data analysis 
The data were analyzed by Novartis and/or the designated CRO and summarized with respect to 
demographic and baseline characteristics, concomitant medications, primary and secondary endpoints, 
and safety observations. Data were summarized descriptively and presented by follow-up visits (every 
6 months). 
Analysis sets 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) was the primary set for all analyses, which included all patients who 
enrolled in the registry.

Analysis of primary endpoints 
The data collected for primary endpoints included frequency of crises and end organ damage (as 
specified above), frequency of hospitalizations, and overall survival. The data were analyzed 
descriptively (counts and percentages) and presented overall and by age cohort. 
The associations between transfusions, chelation, ferritin, and clinical outcomes were also explored. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 498 patients were enrolled in the study (317 pediatric patients and 181 adult patients). 
Baseline data 
A total of 124 patients (24.9%) had exposure to chelation therapies at baseline. A higher percentage 
of adult patients received prior chelation therapies compared with paediatric patients (33.7% vs 
19.9%). The most commonly used prior chelation therapies were deferasirox and deferoxamine 
A  total  of  152  patients  (30.5%)  received  chelation  therapy  sometime  during  their  lifetime,  with  a 
significantly  higher  percentage of  adult  patients  compared  with  paediatric  patients  (P  =  0.0014).  The 
cumulative  median  exposure  to  chelation  therapies  used  was  higher  in  adult  patients  71  (39.2%) 
compared  with  paediatric  patients  81  (25.6%).  The  most  commonly  used  chelation  therapies  were 
deferasirox  and  deferoxamine.  During  the  study,  64  (20.2%)  of  317  paediatric  patients  and  51 
(28.2%)  of  181  adult  patients  received  deferasirox  while  deferoxamine  was  used  in  7  (2.2  %)  of 
paediatric and 6 (3.3%) of adult patients. One (0.6%) adult patient was treated with deferiprone. 
CHMP comment 
Among  patients  receiving  iron  chelators,  96.8%  (61/63)  paediatric  patients  were  already  on 
deferasirox  therapy.  Also,  30%  (19/63)  pediatric  patients  were  already  on  deferoxamine.  As  the 
median  duration  of  chelation  therapy  is  around  4  years  (1546.5  days),  we  can  extrapolate  that  the 
paediatric patients enrolled in this registry well tolerated Exjade already. 
Efficacy results 
The mean serum ferritin (SF) concentration at baseline was 2355.77 μg/L in pediatric patients (n = 59) 
and 3527.72 μg/L in adult patients (baseline, n = 33) and at the study end, the mean SF levels were 
2584.38 μg/L (n=44) and 3913.46 μg/L (n=28), respectively . 
CHMP comment 
This is an observational study which is not designed to assess the efficacy of chelation therapy (in 
particular deferasirox). 
Although this study was not designed to assess efficacy (no efficacy in primary and secondary 
objectives) the apparent increase in serum ferritin between baseline and end of the study should be 
more discussed (mean serum ferritin (SF) concentration from 2355.77 μg/L at baseline (n=44) and 
2584.38 μg/L (n = 59) at the end of the study in pediatric patients).

Safety results 
4.2 DFX treated patients 
4.2.1 Adverse events: 
Overall,  the  incidence  of  adverse  events  in  patients  treated  with  DFX  was  comparable  between 
paediatric and adult patients (38; 59.4% and 32; 62.7%), respectively. The most commonly affected 
primary SOC class in both groups was General disorders and administration site conditions 15 (23.4%) 
and 28 (54.9%). 
Among  the  pediatric  population,  the  most  frequently  AEs  reported  by  ≥5%  of  patients  by  preferred 
term  were  pain  7  (10.7%),  abdominal  pain,  headache,  pyrexia  ,  pain  in  extremity  (6;  9.4%  each), 
acute chest syndrome 5 (7.8%) and back pain 4 (6.3%), Similarly, the most commonly reported AEs 
for adults were pain 22 (43.1%), pyrexia 9 (17.6%), pneumonia 7 (13.7%), anaemia 6 (11.8%), skin 
ulcer,  diarrhoea  (5;  9.8%  each),  abdominal  pain,  wheezing,  nausea  ,  sickle  cell  anaemia  with  crisis, 
urinary tract infection, bronchitis (4; 7.8% each), fatigue, abdominal pain upper, back pain , headache, 
oropharyngeal pain , pulmonary hypertension (3; 5.9% each). 
The  incidence  of  adverse  events  suspected  to  be  related  to  deferasirox  was  numerically  lower  in 
paediatric  patients  vs  adult  patients  (3;  4.7%)  and  (7;  13.7%),  respectively.  The  suspected  adverse 
events  in  paediatric  patients  were  aspartate  aminotransferase  increased,  blood  bilirubin 
increased, abdominal  pain , abdominal  pain upper , hypoaesthesia ,  paraesthesia , rash (1; 
1.6% each). In adult patients, those were diarrhoea 3 (5.9%), sickle cell anaemia with crisis and pain 
(2; 3.9% each), nausea , abdominal pain upper , acute renal failure (1; 2% each). 
The adult patient who experienced acute renal failure had a complete recovery from the event after the 
study drug interruption. Ii is unknown if deferasirox was reintroduced after the recovery. Of note, the 
investigator  stated  that  the  cause  of  the  patient’s  renal  insufficiency  (injury)  was  multifactorial, 
hemosiderosis being a contributing factor. Furthermore, the patient was also receiving levofloxacin for 
UTI  and  investigator  reported  that  the  event  acute  kidney  injury  could  be  possibly  related  to  the 
treatment medication. 
CHMP comment 
A total of 7 AEs (all non serious and mild/moderate) were considered suspected to be related to Exjade 
in  paediatric  population  (instead  of  3  mentioned  by  the  MAH).  The  suspected  adverse  events  in 
paediatric  patients  were  AST  increased,  blood  bilirubin  increased,  abdominal  pain,  abdominal  pain 
upper, hypoaesthesia , paraesthesia , rash (1; 1.6% each).  
The overall safety profile was consistent with the known safety profile of Exjade and complications of 
underlying condition 
4.2.2 Serious Adverse Events 
The incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) in DFX patients, regardless of causality, at the study 
end was numerically slightly lower in paediatrics compared with adults 29 (45.3%) and 29 (56.9 %), 
respectively. The majority of SAEs were classified as severe: paediatric 23 (35.9%) and adults 26 
(51%). In the paediatric patients, the most commonly SAEs were reported in the following System 
Organ Class (SOC): General disorders and administration site conditions 12 (18.8%), Musculoskeletal 
and connective tissue disorders 8 (12.5%), Gastrointestinal disorders 7 (10.9%). Most common SAEs, 
reported by ≥ 5% of patients by preferred term, were pain (7; 10.9%), pyrexia, pain in extremity

and acute chest syndrome (ACS) (5; 7.8% each), abdominal pain and back pain (4; 6.3% 
each). 
In the adult patients, the following most commonly SOCs were reported: General disorders and 
administration site conditions 25 (49.0%), Infections and infestations 10 (19.6%) Musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders 4 (7.8%). Most common SAEs, reported by ≥ 5% of patients by preferred 
term, were pain (21; 41.2%), pneumonia (7; 13.7%), anaemia (5; 9.8%), sickle cell anaemia with 
crisis, abdominal pain, pyrexia and skin ulcer (4; 7.8% each), back pain (3; 5.9%). 
CHMP comment 
Most common SAEs, reported by ≥ 5% of paediatric patients were pain (7; 10.9%), pyrexia, pain in 
extremity and acute chest syndrome (ACS) (5; 7.8% each), abdominal pain and back pain (4; 6.3% 
each). These SAEs were considered as not related by the MAH: SCD complications included events 
such as pain, acute chest syndrome; SCD crisis.  
The overall safety profile was consistent with the known safety profile of Exjade and complications of 
underlying condition 
4.2.3 Death: 
Among the 2 patients who received DFX during the study, one SCD pediatric patient (0046-00006), 17 
year-old  male,  experienced  severe  multi-organ  failure  leading  to  hospitalization  and  subsequently 
died due to Acute  Chest  Syndrome (ACS). The patient was treated with poly medications for sickle 
cell anaemia complications and was receiving deferasirox prior to experiencing death. The Investigator 
did not suspect a relationship between the multiple organ failure and the study medication.  
The  other  SCD  patient,  33  year-old  male,  presented  with  severe  gastrointestinal  hemorrhage  and 
concomitant  disease  progression  leading  to  hospitalization.  The  patient  died  due  to  liver  failure 
secondary to hepatitis C. During the event, the patient was treated with multiple medications and was 
receiving  DFX.  The  Investigator  did  not  suspect  a  relationship  between  the  events  gastrointestinal 
hemorrhage, concomitant disease progression, and hepatic failure and the study medication. 
CHMP comment 
In  the  paediatric  population,  one  fatal  case  was  reported  in  a  patient  treated  with  deferasirox.  The 
causal  relationship  between  Exjade  and  the  occurrence  of  fatal  acute  chest  syndrome  is  doubtful 
considering his medical history (SCD complications: lung disorders, respiratory distress and wheezing) 
and his polymedication for SCD complications.  
4.2.4 Renal and hepatic assessments 
The  mean  SGPT  (ALT)  at  the  baseline  was  29.6  U/L  for  paediatric  patients  (n=63)  and  38.3  U/L  for 
adult  patients  (n=46)  and  they  remained  within  normal  range  consistently  throughout  the  study.  At 
the study end the mean ALT was 31.9 (n=49) and 42.7 U/L (n=35), respectively. 
The mean baseline SGOT (AST) was slightly elevated in both cohorts: 52.7 U/L in pediatric (n=63) and 
55.8 U/L in adults (n=46). These levels remained consistent within the study and EOS mean was 52.7 
U/L (n=49) and 57.5 U/L (n=35), respectively.

The  mean  serum  creatinine  (SCr)  concentration  at  baseline  was  numerically  higher  in  adult  patients 
(62.2 μmol/L, n = 47) versus pediatric patients (34.5 μmol/L, n = 64); both within normal range. In 
pediatric  patients,  the  mean  SCr  remained  consistent  at  all  study  visits  but  visit  4  (84.3  μmol/L, 
n=51). At the study end, the mean SCr in paediatric patients returned to near baseline level and was 
38.8 μmol/L (n=48). Adult patients showed slight increase in mean  SCr concentrations from baseline 
to the end of study (70.7 μmol/L, n = 35). 
CHMP comment 
These data are mainly average of full set analysis. However, based on the data provided, it cannot be 
assessed  if  there  is  an  impact  of  duration  of  therapy  with  Exjade  in  real  life  to  hepatic/renal 
parameters  in  a  specific  category  of  patients.  Therefore,  the  MAH  should  provide  a  table  with  the 
frequency  of  relative  change  from  baseline  to  EOS  for  each  hepatic  (AST,  ALT)  and  renal  parameters 
(ClCr if available) by treatment duration in the paediatric population.  
4.2.5 Pain Crisis 
In a comparison to the 11 (21.6%) DFX adult patients, a higher proportion of paediatric DFX patients 
(35; 54.7%) did not experience pain crisis in the 5 years prior to the baseline visit. During the study, 
the  proportion  of  DFX  paediatric  patients  experiencing  pain  crisis  (44;  68.8%)  was  numerically  less 
when  compared  to  adults  (45;  88.2%).  The  mean  number  of  pain  crises  was  4.5  (SD,  4.67)  for 
children  and  7.2  (SD,  8.20)  for  adults.  In  terms  of  severity  of  pain  crises,  majority  were  severe  and 
required hospitalization. The majority of the pain crisis episodes in paediatric patients persisted for 1 to 
3 days as opposed to adults <1 day. 
CHMP comment 
Pain crisis is one of the known SCD complications. During the study, the proportion of DFX paediatric 
patients  experiencing  pain  crisis  (44;  68.8%)  was  numerically  less  when  compared  to  adults  (45; 
88.2%). But the majority are still severe. 
4.2.6 Acute Chest Syndrome 
In the 5 years prior to the baseline visit, 70.3% of paediatric patients and 88.2% of adult patients 
receiving DFX were free from ACS. Within the study, a higher occurrence of ACS was observed in 
paediatric patients as opposed to adults: 28 (43.8%) and 12 (23.5%) respectively. The mean number 
of ACS episodes was 2.6 (SD, 1.84) for children and 1.6 (SD, 1.16) for adults. The majority of ACS 
episodes persisted for <10 days.  
CHMP comment 
Acute Chest syndrome is one of the known SCD complications.  
Within the study, a higher occurrence of ACS was observed in paediatric patients treated with Exjade 
as opposed to adults: 28 (43.8%) and 12 (23.5%) respectively. This tendency was already observed at 
baseline. Similarly for the overall paediatric population of the study, this tendency was also observed. 
However,  no  significant  difference  was  noted  between  ACS  incidence  in  overall  paediatric  population 
(135 / 317; 42.6%) and in paediatric population treated with Exjade within the study (23/64; 43.8%).

4.2.7 Infection 
In the 5 years preceding the baseline visit, comparable proportions of deferasirox paediatric 70.3% 
and adult 64.7% patients had no infections. No difference for incidence of infections was observed 
between paediatric and adult patients treated with deferasirox during the study: 42.2% (27 patients) 
and 47.1% (24 patients) respectively. The mean number of infections was 2.3 (SD, 1.39) for children 
and 2.7 (SD, 3.16) for adults. The majority of infections continued for <10 days. 
CHMP comment 
Infection is one of the known SCD complications. No difference for incidence of infections was observed 
between paediatric and adult patients treated with deferasirox during the study 
4.2.8 Stroke 
Prior to the 5 years preceding the baseline visit, 81.3% of paediatric and 76.5% of adult patients 
treated with deferasirox did not experience stroke. Of those who experienced stroke there were 6 
paediatrics and 12 adults and most of the events occurred in the first year. Of note, data on 6 
paediatric patients was missing. Within the study, there were 15 (23.4%) paediatric and 3 (5.9%) 
adult patients who presented with stroke while receiving DFX. Among these few patients, the mean 
number of strokes was 1.2 (SD, 0.56) for children and 1.0 (SD, 0.00) for adults. 
CHMP comment 
Stroke is one of the known SCD complications.  
At baseline, in Exjade treated patients, there were 6 (9.4%) children and 12 (21.6%) adults who had 
presented with stroke prior to last 5 years. Within the study, there were 15 (23.4%) paediatric and 
3 (5.9%) adult patients who presented with stroke while receiving DFX. 
Also, in the full set analysis (overall population), at baseline, there were 9 (2.8%) children and 17 
(9.4%) adults who had presented with stroke prior to last 5 years. Within the study, there were 16 
(5%) paediatric and 7 (3.9%) adult patients who presented with stroke while receiving DFX. 
Therefore, the majority of stroke in paediatric patients in this observational study seems to appear in 
paediatric patients treated with Exjade  (15 of the 16 cases). Even if this is based on few patients, this 
issue is important to consider. The MAH should review all paediatric cases of stroke under Exjade 
therapy.  
4.2.9 Priapism 
Prior to the 5 years preceding the baseline visit, 94.3% paediatric and 72.7% adult patients treated 
with deferasirox were free of priapism. Of those who experienced priapism prior to the baseline visit, 
there was one (2.9%) pediatric and 5 (22.6%) adult patients. Data for one patient in each group was 
missing. During the study, there were no patients with priapism in <18 years of age group and there 
were 6 (27.3%) adult patients who had episodes of priapism.

CHMP comment 
Priapism is one of the known SCD complications. During the study, there were no patients with 
priapism in <18 years of age group and there were 6 (27.3%) adult patients who had episodes of 
priapism. 
MAH’s conclusions 
Iron  overload  (IOL)  is  an  inevitable  consequence  of  frequent  blood  transfusion  which  in  turn  is 
associated with debilitating clinical complications. 
The limitation of this study is related to its design as single arm observational which did not mandate 
any specific treatment and/or diagnostic procedures. 
During the study, a slight increase in serum ferritin levels was observed in both patient groups. 
This  suggests  that  patients  were  inadequately  controlled  for  iron  overload.  Since  serum  ferritin  is  an 
acute-phase  reactant,  interpretation  in  SCD  is  confounded  by  the  presence  of  a  strong  inflammatory 
component in these patients.  
Furthermore,  the  study  was  not  designed  to  assess  efficacy  of  chelation  therapy  and  the  compliance 
was  not  monitored  either.  Thus,  one  cannot  conclude  on  the  effect  of  DFX  on  iron  removal  in  the 
observed population. 
Overall,  there  were  no  unexpected  safety  findings  observed  regarding  AEs  or  SAEs  in  both  pediatric 
and adults patients. No death was suspected to be related to DFX as assessed by the investigator. An 
adult  patient  who  died  due  to  liver  failure  experienced  gastrointestinal  bleeding  both  events  not 
suspected  to  be  related  to  the  study  drug.  Of  note,  gastrointestinal  haemorrhage  and  hepatic  failure 
have been reported in patients receiving EXJADE. These events were added to the SPC and are present 
in the approved labeling. 
Within  the  study,  there  was  no  clinically  significant  change  in  liver  or  kidney  function  in  patients 
receiving  DFX.  There  was  one  adult  patient  who  presented  with  acute  renal  failure  which  was 
suspected  to  be  related  to  DFX.  After  the  drug  interruption,  the  patient  had  a  complete  recovery  for 
the  event.  Of  note,  cases  of  acute  renal  failure  have  been  reported  following  post-marketing  use  of 
DFX and the SPC was subsequently updated with the relevant information. 
Some differences between incidences of complications in pediatric and adult patients were seen within 
the  study,  reflecting  the  course  of  the  disease  and  its  clinical  presentation.  For  instance,  more 
paediatric  patients  experienced  stroke.  This  is  not  unexpected  as  the  highest  incidence  of  first 
infarction is seen in children with the incidence decreasing between the ages of 20 and 29 years. 
CHMP comment 
As a general comment, this is an observational registry which is not designed to assess the efficacy of 
chelation therapy (in particular deferasirox). However, an apparent increase in serum ferritin between 
baseline and end of the study was observed (mean serum ferritin (SF) concentration from 2355.77 
μg/L at baseline (n=44) and 2584.38 μg/L (n = 59) at the end of the study in pediatric patients). The 
MAH suggests that patients were inadequately controlled for iron overload. The MAH should more 
discuss the value of maintaining deferasirox in this population. 
The safety assessment of Exjade in paediatric population was not the primary objective of this study 
AUS38. Only descriptive data were recorded.

One fatal case was reported in a young patient treated with deferasirox (multiorgan failure and acute 
chest syndrome) but the relationship with Exjade is doubtful (patient polymedicated due to SCD 
complications prevention and medical history of lung disorders).  
The suspected adverse events in paediatric patients were aspartate aminotransferase increased, blood 
bilirubin increased, abdominal pain , abdominal pain upper , hypoaesthesia , paraesthesia , rash (1; 
1.6% each). 
Pain crisis, acute chest syndrome, infections, stoke and priaspism are known SCD complications.  
The overall safety profile was consistent with the known safety profile of Exjade and complications of 
underlying condition. However, based on the data provided, it cannot be assessed if there is an impact 
of duration of therapy with Exjade in real life to hepatic/renal parameters in a specific category of 
patients. Therefore, the MAH should provide a table with the frequency of relative change from 
baseline to EOS for each hepatic (AST, ALT) and renal parameters (ClCr if available) by treatment 
duration in the paediatric population. 
Stroke is one of the known SCD complications. The majority of stroke in paediatric patients in this 
observational study seems to appear in paediatric patients treated with Exjade (15 of the 16 cases). 
Even if this is based on few patients, this issue is important to consider. The MAH should review all 
paediatric cases of stroke under Exjade therapy.  
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Efficacy 
As a general comment, efficacy conclusions are difficult to drawn since efficacy of deferasirox is not a 
primary objective of these both observational studies. Only descriptive data are available.  
In the study AUS38, an apparent increase in serum ferritin between baseline and end of the study was 
observed in pediatric patients with SCD. The MAH suggests that patients were inadequately controlled

Safety 
As a general comment, safety conclusions are difficult to drawn since safety of deferasirox in paediatric 
population is not a primary objective of these both observational studies. Only descriptive data are 
available.  
In  the  study  AUS38,  64  (20.2%)  of  317  paediatric  patients  and  51  (28.2%)  of  181  adult  patients 
received deferasirox. As the median duration of chelation therapy is around 4 years (1546.5 days), we 
can extrapolate that the paediatric patients enrolled in this registry well tolerated Exjade already. 
In  this  study,  one  fatal  case  in  a  young  patient  (17  years-old)  was  reported  (multi  organ  failure 
followed  by  acute  chest  syndrome)  but  it  is  doubtful  (considering  his  medical  history  /  SCD 
complications  /  polymedications).  The  incidence  of  adverse  events  suspected  to  be  related  to 
deferasirox  was  numerically  lower  in  paediatric  patients  vs  adult  patients  (3; 4.7%)  and  (7;  13.7%), 
respectively.  The  suspected  adverse  events  in  paediatric  patients  were  AST  increased,  blood  bilirubin 
increased,  abdominal  pain,  abdominal  pain  upper,  hypoesthesia,  paraesthesia,  rash  (1;  1.6%  each). 
No new safety concerns emerge from the data provided.

The overall safety profile was consistent with the known safety profile of Exjade and complications of

4.  Additional clarification requested 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this 
procedure: 
Study AUS38 
1-  Study AUS38 is an observational study which is not designed to assess the efficacy of chelation 
therapy (in particular deferasirox). Although this study was not designed to assess efficacy (no 
efficacy in primary and secondary objectives) the apparent increase in serum ferritin between 
baseline and end of the study should be discussed (mean serum ferritin (SF) concentration 
from 2355.77 μg/L at baseline (n=44) and 2584.38 μg/L (n = 59) at the end of the study in 
pediatric patients). The MAH should comment. 
2-  Based on the data provided, it cannot be assessed if there is an impact of duration of therapy 
with Exjade in real life to hepatic/renal parameters in a specific category of patients. Therefore, 
the MAH should provide a table with the frequency of relative change from baseline to EOS for 
each hepatic (AST, ALT) and renal parameters (ClCr if available) by treatment duration in the 
paediatric population.  
3-  The MAH should review all paediatric cases of stroke under Exjade therapy.

MAH responses to Request for supplementary information 
Question 1 
Study  AUS38  is  an  observational  study  which  is  not  designed  to  assess  the  efficacy  of 
chelation  therapy  (in  particular  deferasirox).  Although  this  study  was  not  designed  to 
assess  efficacy  (no  efficacy  in  primary  and  secondary  objectives)  the  apparent  increase  in 
serum  ferritin  between  baseline  and  end  of  the  study  should  be  discussed  (mean  serum 
ferritin  (SF)  concentration  from  2355.77  μg/L  at  baseline  (n=44)  and  2584.38  μg/L  (n  = 
59) at the end of the study in pediatric patients). The MAH should comment. 
MAH’s response  
At  baseline,  the  mean  serum  ferritin  (SF)  concentration  was  2355.77  μg/L  and  the  median  SF  value 
was 1830.00 μg/L (min: 140.0; max: 10054.0) in paediatric patients (n = 59); at the study end, it was 
2584.38 μg/L and 1899.50 μg/L (min: 159.1; max: 8699.0)., respectively (n=44) ([Table 14.3-2.3a] 
of  the  Appendix  1:  Statistical  output  for  study  CICL670AUS38  in  eCTD  sequence  0114,  module 
5.3.5.3). 
The efficacy results in this study are not consistent with historical results reported from multiple other 
studies, including randomized well-controlled studies. In the extension phase of the registration study 
ICL670A109E1,  when  evaluating  sickle  cell  disease  patients  with  transfusional  hemosiderosis  who 
completed at least 4 years of deferasirox therapy, the median decrease in serum ferritin from baseline 
to the end of study was -590.7 μg/L [95% CI: -1571.2;-245.2] and the median relative change was -
27.8% [95% CI:-44.7,-5.1]. 
The  reason(s)  for  the  inconsistent  efficacy  results  are  not  known,  however  there  are  a  number  of 
possible  explanations.  One  important  limitation  of  this  study  was  related  to  its  design  as  an 
observational study which did not impose a particular treatment or drug, predefined treatment groups 
or  clinical  or  laboratory  assessments  other  than  those  required  for  disease  management.  Moreover, 
some of the serum ferritin values were missing, making the interpretation of the findings challenging. 
Additionally, monitoring of compliance was not mandated in this observational study. Noncompliance 
to therapy has been a well-documented reason for serum ferritin increases (Alvarez, 2009). 
In  addition,  several  factors  specific  to  sickle  cell  anaemia  may  increase  serum  ferritin  concentration, 
most  notably  sickle  cell  pain  crisis,  including  acute  chest  syndrome,  inflammation  and  infection. 
Notably, in this observational study, pain crisis, acute chest syndrome and infections were observed in 
44 (68.8%), 28 (43.8%) and 27 (42.2%) paediatric patients respectively. In this observational study, 
it is not possible to determine whether serum ferritin values recorded were influenced by factors other 
than iron status. 
In  summary,  considering  the  inflammatory  nature  of  the  disease  and  limitations  of  observational 
studies, it is not possible to determine specifically why the serum ferritin changes over time were not 
consistent with results from most other studies.

Assessment of the MAH’s response  
Although  this  study  was  not  designed  to  assess  efficacy,  it  was  requested  to  the  MAH  to  discuss  the 
apparent increase in serum ferritin between baseline and end of the study in pediatric patients.  
In this AUS38 study, the severity of iron overload of this population at the baseline and at the end of 
the  study  is  not  documented.  In  addition,  several  limitations  relative  to  observational  studies  (SF 
values missing, monitoring of compliance no mandatory, difference of clinical practice) were identified 
by  the  MAH.  As  a  result,  no  conclusion  about  the  efficacy  of  deferasirox  could  be  drawn  in  pediatric 
population. Although some questions were raised about the efficacy in some pediatric patients treated 
for  sickle  cell  disease,  this  unexpected  result  seems  to  be  related  to  a  specific  population  with 
inflammatory conditions who cannot, at this stage, be identified. 
Question 2 
Based  on  the  data  provided,  it  cannot  be  assessed  if  there  is  an  impact  of  duration  of 
therapy  with  Exjade  in  real  life  to  hepatic/renal  parameters  in  a  specific  category  of 
patients.  Therefore,  the  MAH  should  provide  a  table  with  the  frequency  of  relative  change 
from baseline to EOS for each hepatic (AST, ALT) and renal parameters (ClCr if available) by 
treatment duration in the paediatric population. 
MAH’s response 
Additional  analyses  were  performed  for  the  hepatic  and  renal  parameters  and  can  be  found  in 
[Appendix  1].  In  this  observational  study,  data  were  collected  every  6  months.  The  changes  in  ALT, 
AST  and  serum  creatinine  observed  during  the  study  were  single  measurements  and  were  not 
confirmed  consecutively  and  therefore  cannot  be  directly  compared  to  other  studies  where  notable 
values were defined as confirmed laboratory changes (2 consecutive values, at least 7 days apart). 
Within  the  study  population  being  analyzed,  27  (42.2  %)  paediatric  patients  had  ALT  values  ≤ULN 
(Upper Limit Of Normal) and 35 (54.7%) patients had single ALT value greater than the ULN and less 
than  5  times  the  ULN  during  the  3-year  observation  period  (see  Table  2-1).  Notably,  of  those  35 
patients with post baseline value ALT value greater than the ULN and less than 5 times the ULN, there 
were 10 (28.6%) patients who entered the study with ALT levels above the ULN. One (1.6%) patient 
had a single post-baseline increase in ALT above 10 times the upper limit of normal and greater than 2 
times  above  the  baseline.  Notably,  this  patient  had  a  medical  history  of  chronic  pancreatitis,  two 
episodes  of  acute  pancreatitis  as  well  as  endoscopic  retrograde  cholangiopancreatography  with  stent 
placement.

During  the  study,  there  were  63  (98.4%)  paediatric  patients  who  experienced  a  single  increase  in 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) value greater than the ULN and less than 5 times the ULN (see Table 
2-2). Notably, the majority of these patients, 54 (84.5%) had AST levels above the ULN at the baseline 
and only few, 8 (12.7%) had their AST ≤ ULN. 
Data on creatinine clearance have not been collected in study CICL670AUS38. Within this registry, 39 
(60.9%)  patients  had  a  serum  creatinine  value  ≤ULN  and  20  (31.3%)  patients  experienced  a  single 
value increase above the ULN (see Table 2-3). Of those, 19 (95%) had serum creatinine ≤ULN and one 
had >ULN at the baseline. Only 4 (6.3%) patients had a single serum creatinine increase of 33% and 
above ULN.

Approximately  one  third  of  paediatric  patients  (22;  34.4%)  receiving  deferasirox,  were  treated  with 
hydroxyurea  concomitantly  [Table  14.2-1.1.1  of  Appendix  1].  Of  note,  hydroxyurea  may  cause 
temporary  impairment  of  renal  tubular  function  accompanied  by  elevations  in  serum  uric  acid,  blood 
urea  nitrogen,  and  creatinine  levels.  Elevation  of  hepatic  enzymes  has  also  been  reported  in  patients 
receiving  hydroxyurea.  Furthermore,  some  paediatric  patients  were  also  receiving  acetaminophen  (as 
Panadeine – combination of paracetamol and codeine (13; 20.3%), or paracetamol alone (11; 17.2%) 
and ibuprofen (16, 25%) which are known to cause abnormal liver enzymes levels. 
It  is  also  important  to  highlight  that  several  paediatric  patients  receiving  deferasirox  were 
concomitantly  treated  with  amoxicillin  (6;  9.4%),  penicillin  (9;  14.1%)  and  phenoxymethylpenicillin 
(19; 29.7%) all of which may negatively affects the renal function too. 
Lastly, the renal abnormalities are commonly seen in patients with sickle cell disease due to crises of 
vascular  obstruction  resulting  from  sickled  red  blood  cells.  Considering  the  aforementioned 
confounding factors, the assessment of the effect of deferasirox on liver enzymes and serum creatinine 
is rather challenging and may not be conclusive. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response  
The MAH did not provide a table with the frequency of relative change from baseline to EOS for hepatic 
parameters  (AST,  ALT)  by  treatment duration.  Moreover,  only  serum  creatinine  was  provided instead 
of creatinine clearance. Also, the MAH did not provide them by treatment duration as requested by the 
CHMP.  Of  note,  approximately  one  third  of  patient<  18  years-old  with  serum  creatinine  value  ≤  ULN 
(19 of 64 patients) experienced increased of serum creatinine >33% from baseline. 
Therefore, based on the data provided by the MAH, it still cannot be assessed if there is an impact of 
duration of therapy with Exjade on real life to hepatic/renal parameters in pediatric population.  
We  can  agree  that  this  study  is  not  designed  specifically  to  assess  the  safety  (due  to  the  descriptive 
nature  of  data).  Nevertheless,  uncertainties  on  safety  in  youngest  patients  treated  with  Exjade 
(specifically  for  renal  and  hepatic  parameters)  remain  due  to  this  incomplete  analysis  of  registry’s 
results. 
Therefore, we consider with great importance the MAH’s response to the safety questions raised in the 
variation  II48  regarding  the  long  term  safety  in  paediatric  patient  aged  from  2  to  6  years-old  (still 
ongoing)  as  the  same  questions  regarding  renal  and  hepatic  disorders  and  long  term  events  are 
requested to be clarified. 
We  strongly  recommend  the  MAH  to  provide  a  comprehensive  safety  analysis  of  A2411  study  results 
(with specific analysis of renal/hepatic parameters to name a few) in the context of variation II48.

Question 3 
The MAH should review all paediatric cases of stroke under Exjade therapy. 
MAH’s response 
During  the  observation  period,  no  adult  patients  treated  with  deferasirox  experienced  a  stroke.  The 
only stroke cases on adults were on subjects that were not treated with deferasirox. 
However,  ten  stroke  events  occurred  in  paediatric  patients  treated  with  deferasirox  during  the 
observation period. 
A total of 4 pediatric patients experienced 6 stroke events while receiving deferasirox at the time of the 
event (subject IDs highlighted in dark grey in the table below). One patient had a transient ischemic 
attack (TIA) and one patient experienced a possible cerebrovascular event (not specified) (highlighted 
in light grey in the table below). All these were documented in the clinical database of the study and 
reported  as  serious  adverse  events  (SAE)  in  the  Novartis  safety  database  (ARGUS).  None  of  these 
cases were assessed by the investigators as suspected to be related to the study drug. The summary 
narratives of the stroke cases are outlined below. The full details are provided in [Appendix 2]. 
A detailed review of all stroke cases, which occurred during the observation period (‘Follow up visit 1, 
2, 3, 4, 5 and 10’), is presented in the table below.

There were two paediatric patients under observation who experienced one stroke event each. Details 
of these cases were not collected, as these events ‘stroke’ occurred prior to the initiation of deferasirox 
treatment. 
The  15  stroke  cases  previously  quoted in  the  clinical  overview  occurred  during  the  medical  history  of 
the pediatric patients (‘No. of patients with stroke in the last 5 years’) and not during the observation 
period (‘Follow-up visit 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 10’). These 15 cases were documented at the baseline study 
visits  of  the  patients.  No  details  of  the  cases  are  available  as  the  collection  of  such  data  was  not 
mandated by the non-interventional study protocol.

Narratives 
Reports:  
A  female  child  of  9  years,  with  a  medical  history  of  sickle  cell  anemia,  moyamoya  disease,  seizure 
disorder, chronic transfusions and left parietal stroke (first stroke in year 2005 prior to treatment start 
on  18-Jan-2011),  experienced  3  events  of  ischemic  stroke  on  day  223,  day  632,  and  day  774  after 
start  treatment  with  deferasirox.  All  3  events  of  the  stroke  were  confirmed  by  magnetic  resonance 
imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) or MRI only, involving various regions of the 
brain. The outcome of one event was not reported. The second event was reported as improving and 
third one was reported as complete recovery. During the third event, the patients underwent a planned 
left hemisphere revascularization procedure to treat moyamoya disease. 
The causality for all 3 events of stroke was assessed by the investigator as not suspected to be related 
to deferasirox. 
Report  
A 16-year-old female adolescent, with a medical history of sickle cell anemia, silent myocardial infarct 
and  stroke,  on  day  635  after  start  treatment  with  deferasirox  developed  acute  pyelonephritis  and 
transient ischemic attack (TIA) requiring hospitalization. On a brain computed tomography (CT) scan, 
evidence  of  remote  infarct  was  observed.  The  patient  underwent  an  elective  right  sided 
revascularization  procedure  with  indirect  anastomosis  and  dural  inversion.  Treatment  with  study 
medication  was  continued  unchanged.  The  investigator  assessed  the  event  of  TIA  and  acute 
pyelonephritis as not suspected to be related to study medication. The outcome of the event TIA was 
reported as recovered with sequelae. The event acute pyelonephritis was completely resolved. 
Report  
A male child of 8 years, with a medical history of sickle cell anemia, allergy, cerebrovascular accident 
(unknown  date  of  first  stroke)  and  moyamoya  disease,  on  day  577  after  start  treatment  with 
deferasirox patient developed left-sided weakness and aphasia and was hospitalized. On MRI, evidence 
of  an  acute  ischemic  infarctions  to  the  right  perirolandic  region  and  right  anterior  frontal  lobe  were 
observed. The outcome of the event was not reported. The investigator assessed the event of stroke 
as not suspected to be related to study medication. 
Report  
A  13-year-old  female  adolescent  with  no  medical  history  and  no  concomitant  medications  received 
deferasirox on an  unknown date. During the study,  the patient was hospitalized for observation for a 
possible  cerebrovascular  event  (not  specified).  On  the  same  day,  the  outcome  of  the  event  was 
reported  as  recovered.  The  investigator  assessed  the  event  as  nonserious  and  the  causality  for  the 
event was assessed as not suspected to deferasirox by the investigator. 
Report  
A  female  child  of  6  years,  with  a  medical  history  of  sickle  cell  anemia,  moyamoya  disease  and  iron 
overload,  experienced  a  left  frontal  and  parietal  ischemic  stroke  (unknown  date).  No  concomitant 
medications were reported with the exception of ibuprofen. 
On day 647 after start treatment with deferasirox for iron overload, the patient developed right-sided 
facial  weakness  and  asymmetry,  and  right  hemiparesis  (no  movement  right  arm/leg).  On  MRI  and 
MRA,  evidence  of  ischemia  and  acute  infarction  involving  the  left  parietal  region  (territory  of  the 
posterior division middle cerebral artery) were observed. The investigator assessed the event of stroke 
as not suspected to be related to study medication. 
The outcome of stroke was reported as condition improving. 
Report  
A patient, receiving deferasirox, with a medical history of sickle cell anemia was enrolled in the study 
when he was 17  years old. Prior to the enrollment, the patient had a history  of stroke; the date and 
details of the first stroke are unknown. On day 1,893 after start treatment with deferasirox the patient 
was  hospitalized  with  cholelithiasis,  acute  chest  syndrome  and  septic  shock.  At  the  time  of 
hospitalization the patient was 19 years of age. Bi-frontal cerebral hypodensity and bi-frontal cerebral 
infarcts (ischemic stroke) with significant edema were observed on CT scan of the head and the patient 
underwent  two  decompressive  craniotomies.  Subsequently  the  patient  died  due  to  acute  chest 
syndrome,  multiple  organ  failure,  acute  respiratory  distress,  septic  shock,  encephalopathy  and  acute 
renal failure. The investigator assessed the events as not suspected to be related to study medication.

MAH’s conclusions 
In  this  observational  study,  all  6  stroke  events  experienced  by  the  4  pediatric  patients  while  on 
deferasirox  treatment  were  ischemic  in  nature.  These  findings  are  not  unexpected  as  the  highest 
incidence  of  first  infarction  is  observed  in  children,  with  the  incidence  thereafter  decreasing  between 
the  ages  of  20  and  29  years.  The  sickled  red  cells  can  aggregate  into  large  masses  which  obstruct 
blood vessels and result in damage to tissues and organs. These so called ‘sickle cell crises’ can affect 
a variety of organs including cerebrovascular injury, stroke and seizures. Risk factors associated with 
ischemic  strokes  include  prior  TIA,  low  steady-state  hemoglobin  concentration,  rate  of,  and  recent 
episode of acute chest syndrome and elevated systolic blood pressure (Ohene-Frempong K, 1998). 
Notably, out of the patients who experienced stroke while on deferasirox treatment, 3 patients had a 
history of previous stroke, one patient had a history of stroke and moyamoya disease and one patient 
who  experienced  TIA  also  had  a  history  of  stoke.  It  is  important  to  highlight  that  the  children  with 
stroke are at increased risk of recurrent stroke (28%) whereas children with stroke and moyamoya are 
at  increased  risk  of  recurrent  TIA  and  stroke  (58%),  despite  treatment  with  chronic  transfusion 
(Strouse  JJ,  2011).  In  this  observational  study,  one  of  the  patients  who  had  previous  stroke  and 
moyamoya disease experienced 3 events of stroke. 
Neurologic  complications  are  a  major  cause  of  morbidity  and  mortality  in  sickle  cell  disease.  Children 
and  adults  with  sickle  cell  anemia  have  a  high  prevalence  (4.01%)  and  incidence  (0.61  per  100 
patient-years)  of  cerebrovascular  accidents.  Multiple  clinical  and  genetic  associations  have  been 
identified with increased risk of stroke in this complex disease. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response  
Ten  stroke  events  occurred  in  8  pediatric  patients  treated  with  deferasirox  during  the  observation 
period. Two were excluded from the analysis due to the occurrence prior to the initiation of Exjade. Of 
the 6 remaining paediatric patients, 4 experienced 6 stroke events while receiving Exjade, one patient 
had a transient ischemic attack and one patient experienced a possible cerebrovascular event. None of 
these cases were assessed by the investigators as suspected to be related to the study drug.  
Based on the data provided, the role of Exjade is doubtful due to the time to onset [223-1893 days], 
medical history of stroke (5 of 6 patients) and the underlying disease (SCD).  
No action is required based on these data.

5.  CHMP overall updated conclusion and recommendation 
Efficacy 
The  AUS38  study  was  not  designed  to  assess  efficacy.  Several  limitations  relative  to  observational 
studies  (SF  values  missing,  monitoring  of  compliance  no  mandatory,  difference  of  clinical  practice) 
were identified by the MAH. As a result, no conclusion about the efficacy of deferasirox could be drawn 
in  pediatric  population.  Although  some  questions  were  raised  about  the  efficacy  in  some  pediatric 
patients  treated  for  sickle  cell  disease,  this  unexpected  result  seems  to  be  related  to  a  specific 
population with inflammatory conditions who cannot, at this stage, be identified. Therefore, no action 
is required based on these data. 
Safety 
In the study AUS38 (SCD population), no unexpected events were observed from the data provided. 
After reviewing the data on stroke events in paediatric population, the role of Exjade is doubtful due to 
the  time  to  onset  [223-1893  days],  medical  history  of  stroke  (5  of  6  patients)  and  the  underlying 
disease (SCD). Therefore, no action is required based on these data.  
However, based on the data provided by the MAH, it still cannot be assessed  if there is an impact of 
duration of therapy with Exjade on real life to hepatic/renal parameters in pediatric population.  
We  can  agree  that  this  study  is  not  designed  specifically  to  assess  the  safety  (due  to  the  descriptive 
nature  of  data).  Nevertheless,  uncertainties  on  safety  in  youngest  patients  treated  with  Exjade 
(specifically  for  renal  and  hepatic  parameters)  remain  due  to  this  incomplete  analysis  of  registry’s 
results. 
Therefore, we consider with great importance the MAH’s response to the safety questions raised in the 
variation  II48  regarding  the  long  term  safety  in  paediatric  patient  aged  from  2  to  6  years-old  (still 
ongoing)  as  the  same  questions  regarding  renal  and  hepatic  disorders  and  long  term  events  are 
requested to be clarify. 
We  strongly  recommend  the  MAH  to  provide  a  comprehensive  safety  analysis  of  A2411  study  results 
(with specific analysis of renal/hepatic parameters to name a few) in the context of variation II48. 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

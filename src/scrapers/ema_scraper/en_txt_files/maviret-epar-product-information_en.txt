CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Maviret is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in adults and 
children aged 3 years and older (see sections 4.2, 4.4. and 5.1).
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Maviret treatment should be initiated and monitored by a physician experienced in the management of 
patients with HCV infection.
Posology
Adults, adolescents aged 12 years and older, or children weighing at least 45 kg
The recommended dose of Maviret is 300 mg/120 mg (three 100 mg/40 mg tablets), taken orally, once 
daily at the same time with food (see section 5.2).
The recommended Maviret treatment durations for HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 infected patients 
with compensated liver disease (with or without cirrhosis) are provided in Table 1 and Table 2.

For patients who failed prior therapy with an NS3/4A- and/or an NS5A inhibitor, see section 4.4.
Missed dose
In case a dose of Maviret is missed, the prescribed dose can be taken within 18 hours after the time it 
was supposed to be taken. If more than 18 hours have passed since Maviret is usually taken, the 
missed dose should not be taken and the patient should take the next dose per the usual dosing 
schedule. Patients should be instructed not to take a double dose.
If vomiting occurs within 3 hours of dosing, an additional dose of Maviret should be taken. If 
vomiting occurs more than 3 hours after dosing, an additional dose of Maviret is not needed.
Elderly
No dose adjustment of Maviret is required in elderly patients (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).
Renal impairment
No dose adjustment of Maviret is required in patients with any degree of renal impairment including 
patients on dialysis (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).
Hepatic impairment
No dose adjustment of Maviret is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A). 
Maviret is not recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) and is 
contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) (see sections 4.3, 4.4, and 
5.2).
Liver or kidney transplant patients
A 12-week treatment duration has been evaluated and is recommended in liver or kidney transplant 
recipients with or without cirrhosis (see section 5.1). A 16-week treatment duration should be 
considered in genotype 3-infected patients who are treatment-experienced with peg-IFN + ribavirin +/-
sofosbuvir, or sofosbuvir + ribavirin.
Patients with HIV-1 co-infection
Follow the dosing recommendations in Tables 1 and 2. For dosing recommendations with HIV 
antiviral agents, refer to section 4.5.
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of Maviret in children aged less than 3 years or under 12 kg have not been 
established and no data are available.
Maviret coated granules formulation is intended for children aged 3 to less than 12 years weighing 
12 kg to less than 45 kg. Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for Maviret coated granules 
in sachet for dosing instructions based on body weight. Because the formulations have different 
pharmacokinetic profiles, the tablets and the coated granules are not interchangeable. A full course of 
treatment with the same formulation is therefore required (see section 5.2).
3
Method of administration
For oral use.
Patients should be instructed to swallow tablets whole with food and not to chew, crush or break the 
tablets as it may alter the bioavailability of the agents (see section 5.2).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 5.2).
Concomitant use with atazanavir containing products, atorvastatin, simvastatin, dabigatran etexilate, 
ethinyl oestradiol-containing products, strong P-gp and CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampicin, 
carbamazepine, St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum), phenobarbital, phenytoin, and primidone)
(see section 4.5).
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Hepatitis B virus reactivation
Cases of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, some of them fatal, have been reported during or after 
treatment with direct acting antiviral agents. HBV screening should be performed in all patients before 
initiation of treatment. HBV/HCV co-infected patients are at risk of HBV reactivation, and should,
therefore, be monitored and managed according to current clinical guidelines.
Hepatic impairment
Maviret is not recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) and is 
contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) (see sections 4.2, 4.3, and 
5.2).
Patients who failed a prior regimen containing an NS5A- and/or an NS3/4A-inhibitor
Genotype 1-infected (and a very limited number of genotype 4-infected) patients with prior failure on 
regimens that may confer resistance to glecaprevir/pibrentasvir were studied in studies 
MAGELLAN-1 and B16-439 (section 5.1). The risk of failure was, as expected, highest for those
exposed to both classes. A resistance algorithm predictive of the risk for failure by baseline resistance 
has not been established. Accumulating double class resistance was a general finding for patients who 
failed re-treatment with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir in MAGELLAN-1. No re-treatment data is available 
for patients infected with genotypes 2, 3, 5 or 6. Maviret is not recommended for the re-treatment of 
patients with prior exposure to NS3/4A- and/or NS5A inhibitors.
Drug-drug interactions
Co-administration is not recommended with several medicinal products as detailed in section 4.5.
Use in diabetic patients
Diabetics may experience improved glucose control, potentially resulting in symptomatic 
hypoglycaemia, after initiating HCV direct acting antiviral treatment. Glucose levels of diabetic 
patients initiating direct acting antiviral therapy should be closely monitored, particularly within the 
first 3 months, and their diabetic medicines modified when necessary. The physician in charge of the 
diabetic care of the patient should be informed when direct acting antiviral therapy is initiated.
4
Lactose
Maviret contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase 
deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.
Sodium
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Potential for Maviret to affect other medicinal products
Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir are inhibitors of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein 
(BCRP), and organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1/3. Co-administration with Maviret
may increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products that are substrates of P-gp (e.g. dabigatran 
etexilate, digoxin), BCRP (e.g. rosuvastatin), or OATP1B1/3 (e.g. atorvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, 
rosuvastatin, simvastatin). See Table 3 for specific recommendations on interactions with sensitive 
substrates of P-gp, BCRP, and OATP1B1/3. For other P-gp, BCRP, or OATP1B1/3 substrates, dose 
adjustment may be needed.
Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir are weak inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A and uridine 
glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 in vivo. Clinically significant increases in exposure were not 
observed for sensitive substrates of CYP3A (midazolam, felodipine) or UGT1A1 (raltegravir) when 
administered with Maviret.
Both glecaprevir and pibrentasvir inhibit the bile salt export pump (BSEP) in vitro.
Significant inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, UGT1A4, 
UGT2B7, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, MATE1 or MATE2K are not expected.
Patients treated with vitamin K antagonists
As liver function may change during treatment with Maviret, a close monitoring of International 
Normalised Ratio (INR) values is recommended.
Potential for other medicinal products to affect Maviret
Use with strong P-gp/CYP3A inducers
Medicinal products that are strong P-gp and CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampicin, carbamazepine, St. 
John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum), phenobarbital, phenytoin, and primidone) could significantly 
decrease glecaprevir or pibrentasvir plasma concentrations and may lead to reduced therapeutic effect 
of Maviret or loss of virologic response. Co-administration of such medicinal products with Maviret is 
contraindicated (see section 4.3).
Co-administration of Maviret with medicinal products that are moderate inducers P-gp/CYP3A may 
decrease glecaprevir and pibrentasvir plasma concentrations (e.g. oxcarbazepine, eslicarbazepine, 
lumacaftor, crizotinib). Co-administration of moderate inducers is not recommended (see section 4.4).
Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir are substrates of the efflux transporters P-gp and/or BCRP. Glecaprevir is 
also a substrate of the hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1/3. Co-administration of Maviret with 
medicinal products that inhibit P-gp and BCRP (e.g. ciclosporin, cobicistat, dronedarone, itraconazole, 
ketoconazole, ritonavir) may slow elimination of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir and thereby increase 
plasma exposure of the antivirals. Medicinal products that inhibit OATP1B1/3 (e.g. elvitegravir, 
ciclosporin, darunavir, lopinavir) increase systemic concentrations of glecaprevir.
5
Established and other potential medicinal product interactions
Table 3 provides the least-squares mean Ratio (90% Confidence Interval) effect on concentration of
Maviret and some common concomitant medicinal products. The direction of the arrow indicates the 
direction of the change in exposures (Cmax, AUC, and Cmin) in glecaprevir, pibrentasvir, and the 
co-administered medicinal product (↑ = increase (more than 25%), ↓ = decrease (more than 20%), ↔ 
= no change (equal to or less than 20% decrease or 25% increase)). This is not an exclusive list. All 
interaction studies were performed in adults.

Co-administration 
is not 
recommended. If 
used, lovastatin 
should not exceed 
a dose of 20 
mg/day and 
patients should be 
monitored.  
Caution is 
recommended. 
Pravastatin dose 
should not exceed 
20 mg per day 
and rosuvastatin 
dose should not 
exceed 5 mg per 
day.
Interactions with 
fluvastatin and

caffeine, dextromethorphan, dolutegravir, emtricitabine, felodipine, lamivudine, lamotrigine, 
methadone, midazolam, naloxone, norethindrone or other progestin-only contraceptives, rilpivirine, 
tenofovir alafenamide and tolbutamide.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of glecaprevir
or pibrentasvir in pregnant women.
Studies in rats/mice with glecaprevir or pibrentasvir do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects 
with respect to reproductive toxicity. Maternal toxicity associated with embryo-foetal loss has been 
observed in the rabbit with glecaprevir which precluded evaluation of glecaprevir at clinical exposures
in this species (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, Maviret use is not recommended in 
pregnancy.
10
Breast-feeding
It is unknown whether glecaprevir or pibrentasvir are excreted in human milk. Available 
pharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir in milk (for 
details see section 5.3). A risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. A decision must be made 
whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Maviret therapy taking into 
account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.
Fertility
No human data on the effect of glecaprevir and/or pibrentasvir on fertility are available. Animal 
studies do not indicate harmful effects of glecaprevir or pibrentasvir on fertility at exposures higher 
than the exposures in humans at the recommended dose (see section 5.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Maviret has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
In pooled Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies of adult subjects receiving Maviret with genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 
or 6 HCV infection the most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 10%) were headache 
and fatigue. Less than 0.1% of subjects treated with Maviret had serious adverse reactions (transient 
ischaemic attack). The proportion of subjects treated with Maviret who permanently discontinued 
treatment due to adverse reactions was 0.1%.
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
The following adverse reactions were identified in registrational Phase 2 and 3 studies in HCV-
infected adults with or without cirrhosis treated with Maviret for 8, 12 or 16 weeks, or during post-
marketing experience. The adverse reactions are listed below by body system organ class and 
frequency. Frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), 
uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000), very rare (< 1/10 000) or not known 
(cannot be estimated from the available data).

Description of selected adverse reactions
Adverse reactions in subjects with severe renal impairment including subjects on dialysis
The safety of Maviret in subjects with chronic kidney disease (including subjects on dialysis) and 
genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 chronic HCV infection with compensated liver disease (with or without 
cirrhosis) was assessed in adults in EXPEDITION-4 (n=104) and EXPEDITION-5 (n=101). The most 
common adverse reactions in subjects with severe renal impairment were pruritus (17%) and fatigue 
(12%) in EXPEDITION-4 and pruritus (14.9%) in EXPEDITION-5.
Adverse reactions in subjects with liver or kidney transplant
The safety of Maviret was assessed in 100 post-liver or -kidney transplant adult recipients with 
genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 chronic HCV infection without cirrhosis (MAGELLAN-2). The overall 
safety profile in transplant recipients was comparable to that observed in subjects in the Phase 2 and 3 
studies. Adverse reactions observed in greater than or equal to 5% of subjects receiving Maviret for 12 
weeks were headache (17%), fatigue (16%), nausea (8%) and pruritus (7%).
Safety in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected subjects
The overall safety profile in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected adult subjects (ENDURANCE-1 and 
EXPEDITION-2) was comparable to that observed in HCV mono-infected adult subjects.
Paediatric population
The safety of Maviret in HCV GT1-6 infected adolescents is based on data from a Phase 2/3 
open-label study in 47 subjects aged 12 years to < 18 years treated with Maviret for 8 to 16 weeks 
(DORA Part 1). The adverse reactions observed were comparable with those observed in clinical 
studies of Maviret in adults.
Serum bilirubin elevations
Elevations in total bilirubin of at least 2x upper limit normal (ULN) were observed in 1.3% of subjects 
related to glecaprevir-mediated inhibition of bilirubin transporters and metabolism. Bilirubin 
elevations were asymptomatic, transient, and typically occurred early during treatment. Bilirubin 
elevations were predominantly indirect and not associated with ALT elevations. Direct 
hyperbilirubinemia was reported in 0.3% of subjects.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
The highest documented doses administered to healthy volunteers is 1 200 mg once daily for 7 days 
for glecaprevir and 600 mg once daily for 10 days for pibrentasvir. Asymptomatic serum ALT 
elevations (> 5x ULN) were observed in 1 out of 70 healthy subjects following multiple doses of 
glecaprevir (700 mg or 800 mg) once daily for ≥ 7 days. In case of overdose, the patient should be 
monitored for any signs and symptoms of toxicities (see section 4.8). Appropriate symptomatic 
treatment should be instituted immediately. Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir are not significantly removed 
by haemodialysis.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, direct acting antivirals, ATC code: J05AP57
12
Mechanism of action
Maviret is a fixed-dose combination of two pan-genotypic, direct acting antiviral agents, glecaprevir 
(NS3/4A protease inhibitor) and pibrentasvir (NS5A inhibitor), targeting multiple steps in the HCV 
viral lifecycle.
Glecaprevir
Glecaprevir is a pan-genotypic inhibitor of the HCV NS3/4A protease, which is necessary for the 
proteolytic cleavage of the HCV encoded polyprotein (into mature forms of the NS3, NS4A, NS4B, 
NS5A, and NS5B proteins) and is essential for viral replication.
Pibrentasvir
Pibrentasvir is a pan-genotypic inhibitor of HCV NS5A, which is essential for viral RNA replication 
and virion assembly. The mechanism of action of pibrentasvir has been characterised based on cell 
culture antiviral activity and drug resistance mapping studies.
Antiviral activity
The EC50 values of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir against full-length or chimeric replicons encoding 
NS3 or NS5A from laboratory strains are presented in Table 5.

Resistance
In cell culture
Amino acid substitutions in NS3 or NS5A selected in cell culture or important for the inhibitor class 
were phenotypically characterised in replicons.
Substitutions important for the HCV protease inhibitor class at positions 36, 43, 54, 55, 56, 155, 166, 
or 170 in NS3 had no impact on glecaprevir activity. Substitutions at amino acid position 168 in NS3 
had no impact in genotype 2, while some substitutions at position 168 reduced glecaprevir 
susceptibility by up to 55-fold (genotypes 1, 3, 4), or reduced susceptibility by > 100-fold (genotype 
6). Some substitutions at position 156 reduced susceptibility to glecaprevir (genotypes 1 to 4) by 
> 100-fold. Substitutions at amino acid position 80 did not reduce susceptibility to glecaprevir except 
for Q80R in genotype 3a, which reduced susceptibility to glecaprevir by 21-fold.
Single substitutions important for the NS5A inhibitor class at positions 24, 28, 30, 31, 58, 92, or 93 in 
NS5A in genotypes 1 to 6 had no impact on the activity of pibrentasvir. Specifically in genotype 3a, 
A30K or Y93H had no impact on pibrentasvir activity. Some combinations of substitutions in 
genotypes 1a and 3a (including A30K+Y93H in genotype 3a) showed reductions in susceptibility to 
pibrentasvir. In genotype 3b replicon, the presence of naturally occurring polymorphisms K30 and 
M31 in NS5A reduced susceptibility to pibrentasvir by 24-fold relative to the activity of pibrentasvir 
in genotype 3a replicon.

In clinical studies
Studies in treatment-naïve and peginterferon (pegIFN), ribavirin (RBV) and/or sofosbuvir treatment-
experienced adult subjects with or without cirrhosis
Twenty-two of the approximately 2 300 subjects treated with Maviret for 8, 12, or 16 weeks in 
registrational Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies experienced virologic failure (2 with genotype 1, 2 with 
genotype 2, 18 with genotype 3 infection).
Among the 2 genotype 1-infected subjects who experienced virologic failure, one had treatment-
emergent substitutions A156V in NS3 and Q30R/L31M/H58D in NS5A, and one had Q30R/H58D 
(while Y93N was present at baseline and post-treatment) in NS5A.
Among the 2 genotype 2-infected subjects, no treatment-emergent substitutions were observed in NS3 
or NS5A (the M31 polymorphism in NS5A was present at baseline and post-treatment in both 
subjects).
Among the 18 genotype 3-infected subjects treated with Maviret for 8, 12, or 16 weeks who 
experienced virologic failure, treatment-emergent NS3 substitutions Y56H/N, Q80K/R, A156G, or 
Q168L/R were observed in 11 subjects. A166S or Q168R were present at baseline and post-treatment 
in 5 subjects. Treatment-emergent NS5A substitutions M28G, A30G/K, L31F, P58T, or Y93H were 
observed in 16 subjects, and 13 subjects had A30K (n=9) or Y93H (n=5) at baseline and 
post-treatment.
Studies in adult subjects with or without compensated cirrhosis who were treatment-experienced to 
NS3/4A protease and/or NS5A inhibitors
Ten of 113 subjects treated with Maviret in the MAGELLAN-1 study for 12 or 16 weeks experienced 
virologic failure. Among the 10 genotype 1-infected subjects with virologic failure, treatment-
emergent NS3 substitutions V36A/M, R155K/T, A156G/T/V, or D168A/T were observed in 7 
subjects. Five of the 10 had combinations of V36M, Y56H, R155K/T, or D168A/E in NS3 at baseline 
and post-treatment. All of the genotype 1-infected virologic failure subjects had one or more NS5A 
substitutions L/M28M/T/V, Q30E/G/H/K/L/R, L31M, P32 deletion, H58C/D, or Y93H at baseline, 
with additional treatment-emergent NS5A substitutions M28A/G, P29Q/R, Q30K, H58D, or Y93H 
observed in 7 of the subjects at the time of failure.
Thirteen of the 177 subjects with chronic HCV GT1 infection (all virologic failures had GT1a 
infection) who were treatment-experienced with NS5A inhibitor + SOF treated with Maviret in study 
B16-439 for 12 weeks (9 out of 13) or 16 weeks (4 out of 13) experienced virologic failure. Among 
the 13 virologic failures, treatment-emergent NS3 substitutions were observed in 4 subjects at the time 
of failure: A156V (n = 2) or R155W + A156G (n = 2); 3 of these 4 subjects also had Q80K at baseline 
and at the time of failure. Twelve of 13 virologic failures had one or more NS5A polymorphisms 
detected at signature amino acid positions (M28V/T, Q30E/H/N/R, L31M/V, H58D, E62D/Q, or 
Y93H/N) at baseline, and 10 of 13 developed additional NS5A substitutions (M28A/S/T (n = 3), 
Q30N (n = 1), L31M/V (n = 2), P32del (n = 1), H58D (n = 4), E62D (n = 1)) at time of treatment 
failure.
Effect of baseline HCV amino acid polymorphisms on treatment response
A pooled analysis of treatment-naïve and pegylated interferon, ribavirin and/or sofosbuvir treatment-
experienced adult subjects receiving Maviret in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies was conducted 
to explore the association between baseline polymorphisms and treatment outcome and to describe 
substitutions seen upon virologic failure. Baseline polymorphisms relative to a subtype-specific 
reference sequence at amino acid positions 155, 156, and 168 in NS3, and 24, 28, 30, 31, 58, 92, and 
93 in NS5A were evaluated at a 15% detection threshold by next-generation sequencing. Baseline 
polymorphisms in NS3 were detected in 1.1% (9/845), 0.8% (3/398), 1.6% (10/613), 1.2% (2/164), 
41.9% (13/31), and 2.9% (1/34) of subjects with HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 infection, 
15
respectively. Baseline polymorphisms in NS5A were detected in 26.8% (225/841), 79.8% (331/415), 
22.1% (136/615), 49.7% (80/161), 12.9% (4/31), and 54.1% (20/37) of subjects with HCV genotype 1, 
2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 infection, respectively.
Genotype 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6: Baseline polymorphisms in genotypes 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 had no impact on 
treatment outcome.
Genotype 3: For subjects who received the recommended regimen (n=313), baseline polymorphisms 
in NS5A (Y93H included) or NS3 did not have a relevant impact on treatment outcomes. All subjects
(15/15) with Y93H and 77% (17/22) with A30K in NS5A at baseline achieved SVR12. The overall 
prevalence of A30K and Y93H at baseline was 7.0% and 4.8%, respectively. The ability to assess the 
impact of baseline polymorphisms in NS5A was limited among treatment-naïve subjects with cirrhosis 
and treatment-experienced subjects due to low prevalence of A30K (3.0%, 4/132) or Y93H (3.8%, 
5/132).
Cross-resistance
In vitro data indicate that the majority of the resistance-associated substitutions in NS5A at amino acid 
positions 24, 28, 30, 31, 58, 92, or 93 that confer resistance to ombitasvir, daclatasvir, ledipasvir, 
elbasvir, or velpatasvir remained susceptible to pibrentasvir. Some combinations of NS5A 
substitutions at these positions showed reductions in susceptibility to pibrentasvir. Glecaprevir was 
fully active against resistance-associated substitutions in NS5A, while pibrentasvir was fully active 
against resistance-associated substitutions in NS3. Both glecaprevir and pibrentasvir were fully active 
against substitutions associated with resistance to NS5B nucleotide and non-nucleotide inhibitors.

15 IU/mL (except for SURVEYOR-1 and SURVEYOR-2 which used the Roche COBAS TaqMan 
real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) assay v. 2.0 with an LLOQ of 25 IU/mL). Sustained 
virologic response (SVR12), defined as HCV RNA less than LLOQ at 12 weeks after the cessation of 
treatment, was the primary endpoint in all the studies to determine the HCV cure rate.
Clinical studies in treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced subjects with or without cirrhosis
Of the 2 409 adult subjects with compensated liver disease (with or without cirrhosis) treated who 
were treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced to combinations of peginterferon, ribavirin and/or 
sofosbuvir, the median age was 53 years (range: 19 to 88); 73.3% were treatment-naïve, 26.7% were 
treatment-experienced to a combination containing either sofosbuvir, ribavirin and/or peginterferon; 
40.3% were HCV genotype 1; 19.8% were HCV genotype 2; 27.8% were HCV genotype 3; 8.1% 
were HCV genotype 4; 3.4% were HCV genotype 5-6; 13.1% were ≥ 65 years; 56.6% were male; 
6.2% were Black; 12.3% had cirrhosis; 4.3% had severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease; 
20.0% had a body mass index of at least 30 kg per m2; 7.7% had HIV-1 coinfection and the median

VF=virologic failure
a. Percent of subjects with prior treatment-experience to PRS is 26%, 14%, 24%, 0%, and 13% for 
genotypes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6, respectively. None of the GT5 subjects were TE-PRS, and 3 GT6 subjects 
were TE-PRS.
b. Includes a total of 154 subjects coinfected with HIV-1 in ENDURANCE-1 and EXPEDITION-2
who received the recommended duration. 
c. Relapse is defined as HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ after end-of-treatment response among those who 
completed treatment.
d. Includes subjects who discontinued due to adverse event, lost to follow-up, or subject withdrawal.
Of the genotype 1-, 2-, 4-, 5-, or 6 infected subjects with end stage renal disease enrolled in 
EXPEDITION-4, 97.8% (91/93) achieved SVR12 with no virologic failures.
Clinical study in subjects with genotype 5 or 6 infection
ENDURANCE-5,6 was an open-label study in 84 HCV GT5 (N=23) or 6 infected (N=61) TN or 
TE-PRS adult subjects. Subjects without cirrhosis received Maviret for 8 weeks, and subjects with 
compensated cirrhosis received Maviret for 12 weeks. Of the 84 subjects treated, the median age was 
59 years (range 24-79); 27% had HCV genotype 5, 73% had HCV genotype 6; 54% were female, 30% 
were White, 68% were Asian; 90% were HCV TN; 11% had compensated cirrhosis.
The overall SVR12 rate was 97.6% (82/84). The SVR12 rate was 95.7% (22/23) for GT5-infected 
subjects and 98.4% (60/61) for GT6-infected subjects. One TN GT5-infected subject without cirrhosis 
experienced relapse, and one TN GT6-infected subject with compensated cirrhosis experienced on-
treatment virologic failure.
18
Subjects with genotype 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 infection with cirrhosis who received 8 weeks of Maviret
The safety and efficacy of Maviret given for 8 weeks in GT 1, 2, 4, 5 or 6 treatment-naïve adult
subjects with compensated cirrhosis was evaluated in a single-arm, open-label study 
(EXPEDITION-8).
Of the 280 subjects treated, the median age was 60 years (range: 34 to 88); 81.8% had HCV genotype 
1, 10% had HCV genotype 2, 4.6% had HCV genotype 4, 0.4% had HCV genotype 5; 3.2% had HCV 
genotype 6; 60% were male; 9.6% were Black.
The overall SVR12 rate was 98.2% (275/280). There were no virologic failures.
Subjects with genotype 3 infection
The efficacy of Maviret in subjects who were treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced to 
combinations of peginterferon, ribavirin and/or sofosbuvir with genotype 3 chronic hepatitis C 
infection was demonstrated in the ENDURANCE-3 (treatment-naïve adults without cirrhosis), 
EXPEDITION-8 (treatment-naïve adults with cirrhosis), and SURVEYOR-2 Part 3 (adults with and 
without cirrhosis and/or treatment-experienced) clinical studies.
ENDURANCE-3 was a partially-randomised, open-label, active-controlled study in treatment-naïve 
genotype 3-infected subjects. Subjects were randomised (2:1) to either Maviret for 12 weeks or the 
combination of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir for 12 weeks; subsequently the study included a third arm 
(which was non-randomised) with Maviret for 8 weeks. EXPEDITION-8 was a single-arm, open-label 
study in treatment-naïve subjects with compensated cirrhosis and genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 infection 
who received Maviret for 8 weeks. SURVEYOR-2 Part 3 was an open-label study that evaluated the 
efficacy of Maviret in treatment-experienced genotype 3-infected subjects without cirrhosis and with 
compensated cirrhosis for 16-weeks. Among treatment-experienced subjects, 46% (42/91) failed a 
previous regimen containing sofosbuvir.

Subjects with genotype 3b infection
GT3b is a subtype reported in a relatively small number of HCV infected patients in China and a few 
countries in South and Southeast Asia, but rarely outside of this region. Studies VOYAGE-1 and 
VOYAGE-2 were conducted in China, Singapore, and South Korea in HCV genotype 1-6 adult 
subjects without cirrhosis (VOYAGE-1) or with compensated cirrhosis (VOYAGE-2) that were 
treatment-naïve (TN) or treatment-experienced to combinations of interferon, peg interferon, ribavirin 
and/or sofosbuvir (TE-PRS). All subjects without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis received 8 
or 12 weeks of Maviret, respectively, except GT3 TE-PRS subjects who received 16 weeks of 
Maviret. The overall SVR12 rates were 97.2% (352/362) and 99.4% (159/160) in VOYAGE-1 and 
VOYAGE-2, respectively.
Among GT3b subjects without cirrhosis, a numerically lower SVR12 rate of 58.3% (7/12) [62.5% 
(5/8) for TN subjects and 50% (2/4) for TE-PRS subjects] was observed compared to GT3a subjects 
without cirrhosis (92.9% (13/14)). Three GT3b TN subjects experienced relapse and two GT3b 
TE-PRS subjects experienced on-treatment virologic failure. Among subjects with compensated 
cirrhosis, the overall SVR12 rate for GT3b infected subjects was 87.5% (7/8) [85.7% (6/7) for TN 
subjects and 100% (1/1) for TE-PRS subjects] and 100% (6/6) for GT3a infected subjects. One GT3b 
TN subject experienced relapse.
Overall SVR12 rate from the clinical studies in treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced adult
subjects with or without cirrhosis
In subjects who are treatment-naïve (TN) or treatment-experienced to combinations of interferon, 
peginterferon, ribavirin and/or sofosbuvir (TE-PRS) who received the recommended duration, 97.5% 
(1 395/1 431) achieved SVR12 overall, while 0.2% (3/1 431) experienced on-treatment virologic 
failure and 0.9% (12/1 407) experienced post-treatment relapse.
In TN or TE-PRS subjects with compensated cirrhosis who received the recommended duration, 
97.1% (431/444) achieved SVR12 (among which 97.7% [335/343] of TN subjects achieved SVR12), 
while 0.2% (1/444) experienced on-treatment virologic failure and 0.9% (4/434) experienced post-
treatment relapse.
20
In TN subjects without cirrhosis who received the recommended duration of 8 weeks, 97.5% 
(749/768) achieved SVR12, while 0.1% (1/768) experienced on-treatment virologic failure and 0.7% 
(5/755) experienced post-treatment relapse.
In TE-PRS subjects without cirrhosis who received the recommended duration, 98.2% (215/219) 
achieved SVR12, while 0.5% (1/219) experienced on-treatment virologic failure and 1.4% (3/218) 
experienced post-treatment relapse.
The presence of HIV-1 coinfection did not impact efficacy. The SVR12 rate in TN or TE-PRS 
HCV/HIV-1 co-infected subjects treated for 8 or 12 weeks (without cirrhosis and with compensated 
cirrhosis, respectively) was 98.2% (165/168) from ENDURANCE-1 and EXPEDITION-2. One 
subject experienced on-treatment virologic failure (0.6%, 1/168) and no subjects relapsed (0%, 0/166).
Clinical study in liver or kidney transplant recipients
MAGELLAN-2 was a single-arm, open-label study in 100 post-liver or -kidney transplant HCV 
GT1-6 infected adult subjects without cirrhosis who received Maviret for 12 weeks. The study 
included subjects who were HCV treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced to combinations of (peg) 
interferon, ribavirin, and/or sofosbuvir, with the exception of GT3-infected subjects who were all 
treatment-naïve.
Of the 100 subjects treated, the median age was 60 years (range: 39 to 78); 57% had HCV genotype 1, 
13% had HCV genotype 2, 24% had HCV genotype 3, 4% had HCV genotype 4, 2% had HCV 
genotype 6; 75% were male; 8% were Black; 66% were HCV treatment-naïve; none had cirrhosis and 
80% had a baseline fibrosis state of F0 or F1; 80% of subjects were post-liver transplant and 20% were 
post-kidney transplant. Immunosuppressants allowed for co-administration were ciclosporin 
≤ 100 mg/day, tacrolimus, sirolimus, everolimus, azathioprine, mycophenolic acid, prednisone, and 
prednisolone.
The overall SVR12 rate in post-transplant subjects was 98.0% (98/100). There was one relapse and no 
on-treatment virologic failure.
Clinical study in renally impaired subjects
EXPEDITION-5 was an open-label study in 101 HCV GT1-6 infected adult subjects without cirrhosis 
or with compensated cirrhosis and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3b, 4, or 5. Subjects were 
either treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced to combinations of (peg) interferon, ribavirin, and/or 
sofosbuvir and received Maviret for 8, 12, or 16 weeks per approved treatment durations.
Of the 101 subjects treated, the median age was 58 years (range 32-87); 53% had HCV genotype 1; 
27% had HCV genotype 2; 15% had HCV genotype 3; 4% had HCV genotype 4;  59% were male; 
73% were White; 80% were HCV treatment-naïve; 13% had cirrhosis and 65% had a baseline fibrosis 
state of F0 or F1; 7% were CKD stage 3b; 17% were CKD Stage 4, and 76% were CKD Stage 5 (all 
receiving dialysis); 84 subjects received 8 weeks of treatment, 13 subjects received 12 weeks of
treatment, and 4 subjects received 16 weeks of treatment.
The overall SVR12 rate was 97% (98/101). There were no virologic failures.
Durability of sustained virologic response
In a long-term follow-up study (M13-576), 99.5% (374/376) of adult subjects who had achieved 
SVR12 in prior clinical studies of Maviret maintained SVR up to their last follow-up visit (median 
duration of follow-up: 35.5 months): 100%, 99.6%, and 95.8% of subjects who had received 8, 12, and 
16 weeks of Maviret therapy, respectively. Among the 2 subjects who did not maintain SVR, 1 
experienced a late relapse 390 days after Maviret therapy, and the other subject experienced re-
infection with a different HCV genotype.
21
Elderly
Clinical studies of Maviret included 328 patients aged 65 and over (13.8% of the total number of 
subjects). The response rates observed for patients ≥ 65 years of age were similar to that of patients 
< 65 years of age, across treatment groups.
Paediatric population
DORA (Part 1) was an open-label study to evaluate safety and efficacy in adolescents aged 12 years to 
less than 18 years who received Maviret 300 mg/120 mg (three 100 mg/40 mg film-coated tablets) for 
8 or 16 weeks. 47 subjects were enrolled in DORA (Part 1). The median age was 14 years (range: 12 
to 17); 79% had HCV genotype 1, 6% had HCV genotype 2, 9% had HCV genotype 3, 6% had HCV 
genotype 4; 55% were female; 11% were Black; 77% were HCV treatment-naïve; 23% were 
treatment-experienced to interferon; 4% had HIV-coinfection; none had cirrhosis; the mean weight 
was 59 kg (range: 32 to 109).
The overall SVR12 rate was 100% (47/47). No subject experienced virologic failure.
Refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for Maviret granules for clinical study data from 
DORA Part 2 which evaluated the safety and efficacy of weight-based dosing of Maviret granules for 
8, 12 or 16 weeks in 80 children aged 3 years to less than 12 years.

b. Mean systemic exposure with moderate to high fat meals.
c. Single dose administration of [14C]glecaprevir or [14C]pibrentasvir in mass balance studies. 
d. Oxidative metabolites or their byproducts accounted for 26% of radioactive dose. No glecaprevir 
metabolites were observed in plasma.
In patients with chronic hepatitis C infection without cirrhosis, following 3 days of monotherapy with 
either glecaprevir 300 mg per day (N=6) or pibrentasvir 120 mg per day (N=8) alone, geometric mean 
AUC24 values were 13 600 ng•h/mL for glecaprevir and 459 ng•h/mL for pibrentasvir. Estimation of 
the pharmacokinetic parameters using population pharmacokinetic models has inherent uncertainty 
22
due to dose non-linearity and cross interaction between glecaprevir and pibrentasvir. Based on 
population pharmacokinetic models for Maviret in chronic hepatitis C patients, steady-state AUC24
values for glecaprevir and pibrentasvir were 4 800 and 1 430 ng•h/mL in subjects without cirrhosis 
(N=1 804), and 10 500 and 1 530 ng•h/mL in subjects with cirrhosis (N=280), respectively. Relative to 
healthy subjects (N=230), population estimates of AUC24, ss were similar (10% difference) for 
glecaprevir and 34% lower for pibrentasvir in HCV-infected patients without cirrhosis.
Linearity/non-linearity
Glecaprevir AUC increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner (1 200 mg QD had 516-fold 
higher exposure than 200 mg QD) which may be related to saturation of uptake and efflux 
transporters.
Pibrentasvir AUC increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner at doses up to 120 mg, (over 
10-fold exposure increase at 120 mg QD compared to 30 mg QD), but exhibited linear 
pharmacokinetics at doses ≥ 120 mg. The non-linear exposure increase < 120 mg may be related to 
saturation of efflux transporters.
Pibrentasvir bioavailability when coadministered with glecaprevir is 3-fold of pibrentasvir alone. 
Glecaprevir is affected to a lower extent by co-administration with pibrentasvir.
Pharmacokinetics in special populations
Race/ethnicity
No dose adjustment of Maviret is required based on race or ethnicity.
Gender/weight
No dose adjustment of Maviret is required based on gender or body weight ≥ 45 kg.
Elderly
No dose adjustment of Maviret is required in elderly patients. Population pharmacokinetic analysis in 
HCV-infected subjects showed that within the age range (12 to 88 years) analysed, age did not have a 
clinically relevant effect on the exposure to glecaprevir or pibrentasvir.
Paediatric population
No dose adjustment of Maviret is required in children 12 years and older or weighing at least 45 kg. 
Exposures of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir in adolescents aged 12 to < 18 years were comparable to 
those in adults from Phase 2/3 studies.
Maviret is available as a granule formulation for children 3 years to less than 12 years of age and 
weighing 12 kg to less than 45 kg and is dosed based on body weight. Children weighing 45 kg or 
more should use the tablet formulation. Because the formulations have different pharmacokinetic 
profiles, the tablets and the coated granules are not interchangeable.
The pharmacokinetics of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir have not been established in children < 3 years 
of age or weighing under 12 kg.
Renal impairment
Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir AUC were increased ≤ 56% in non-HCV infected subjects with mild, 
moderate, severe, or end stage renal impairment not on dialysis compared to subjects with normal 
renal function. Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir AUC were similar with and without dialysis (≤ 18% 
difference) in dialysis-dependent non-HCV infected subjects. In population pharmacokinetic analysis 
of HCV-infected subjects, 86% higher glecaprevir and 54% higher pibrentasvir AUC were observed 
for subjects with end stage renal disease, with or without dialysis, compared to subjects with normal 
renal function. Larger increases may be expected when unbound concentration is considered.
23
Overall, the changes in exposures of Maviret in HCV-infected subjects with renal impairment with or 
without dialysis were not clinically significant.
Hepatic impairment
At the clinical dose, compared to non-HCV infected subjects with normal hepatic function, glecaprevir 
AUC was 33% higher in Child-Pugh A subjects, 100% higher in Child-Pugh B subjects, and increased 
to 11-fold in Child-Pugh C subjects. Pibrentasvir AUC was similar in Child-Pugh A subjects, 26% 
higher in Child-Pugh B subjects, and 114% higher in Child-Pugh C subjects. Larger increases may be 
expected when unbound concentration is considered.
Population pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that following administration of Maviret in HCV-
infected subjects with compensated cirrhosis, exposure of glecaprevir was approximately 2-fold and 
pibrentasvir exposure was similar to non-cirrhotic HCV-infected subjects. The mechanism for the 
differences between glecaprevir exposure in chronic Hepatitis C patients with or without cirrhosis is 
unknown.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir were not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo assays, including 
bacterial mutagenicity, chromosome aberration using human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in vivo
rodent micronucleus assays. Carcinogenicity studies with glecaprevir and pibrentasvir have not been 
conducted.
No effects on mating, female or male fertility, or early embryonic development were observed in 
rodents at up to the highest dose tested. Systemic exposures (AUC) to glecaprevir and pibrentasvir 
were approximately 63 and 102 times higher, respectively, than the exposure in humans at the 
recommended dose.
In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed when the components 
of Maviret were administered separately during organogenesis at exposures up to 53 times (rats; 
glecaprevir) or 51 and 1.5 times (mice and rabbits, respectively; pibrentasvir) the human exposures at 
the recommended dose of Maviret. Maternal toxicity (anorexia, lower body weight, and lower body 
weight gain) with some embryofoetal toxicity (increase in post-implantation loss and number of 
resorptions and a decrease in mean foetal body weight), precluded the ability to evaluate glecaprevir in 
the rabbit at clinical exposures. There were no developmental effects with either compound in rodent 
peri/postnatal developmental studies in which maternal systemic exposures (AUC) to glecaprevir and 
pibrentasvir were approximately 47 and 74 times, respectively, the exposure in humans at the 
recommended dose. Unchanged glecaprevir was the main component observed in the milk of lactating 
rats without effect on nursing pups. Pibrentasvir was the only component observed in the milk of 
lactating rats without effect on nursing pups.

The adult dose of Maviret tablets should be used in children weighing 45 kg or greater. Refer to the 
Summary of Product Characteristics for Maviret film-coated tablets for dosing instructions.
Missed dose
In case a dose of Maviret is missed, the prescribed dose can be taken within 18 hours after the time it 
was supposed to be taken. If more than 18 hours have passed since Maviret is usually taken, the 
missed dose should not be taken and the patient should take the next dose per the usual dosing 
schedule. Patients should be instructed not to take a double dose.
If vomiting occurs within 3 hours of dosing, an additional dose of Maviret should be taken. If 
vomiting occurs more than 3 hours after dosing, an additional dose of Maviret is not needed.
Renal impairment
No dose adjustment of Maviret is required in patients with any degree of renal impairment including 
patients on dialysis (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).
Hepatic impairment
No dose adjustment of Maviret is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A). 
Maviret is not recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) and is 
contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) (see sections 4.3, 4.4, and 
5.2).
Liver or kidney transplant patients
A 12-week treatment duration has been evaluated and is recommended in liver or kidney transplant 
recipients with or without cirrhosis (see section 5.1). A 16-week treatment duration should be 
considered in genotype 3-infected patients who are treatment-experienced with peg-IFN + ribavirin +/-
sofosbuvir, or sofosbuvir + ribavirin.
Patients with HIV-1 co-infection
Follow the dosing recommendations in Tables 1 and 2. For dosing recommendations with HIV 
antiviral agents, refer to section 4.5.
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of Maviret in children aged less than 3 years or weighing under 12 kg have not 
been established. No data are available. Children weighing 45 kg or more should use the tablet 
formulation. Because the formulations have different pharmacokinetic profiles, the tablets and the 
27
coated granules are not interchangeable. A full course of treatment with the same formulation is 
therefore required (see section 5.2).
Method of administration
Oral use





Patients should be instructed to take the recommended dose of Maviret with food once daily.
The granules for the total daily dose (the whole content of the required number of sachets, pink 
and yellow granules) should be sprinkled on a small amount of soft food with a low water 
content that will stick to a spoon and can be swallowed without chewing (e.g., peanut butter, 
chocolate hazelnut spread, soft/cream cheese, thick jam, or Greek yogurt).
Liquids or foods that would drip or slide off the spoon should not be used as the medicine may 
dissolve quickly and become less effective.
The mixture of food and granules should be swallowed immediately; the granules should not be 
crushed or chewed.
Maviret granules should not be administered via enteral feeding tubes.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 5.2).
Concomitant use with atazanavir containing products, atorvastatin, simvastatin, dabigatran etexilate, 
ethinyl oestradiol-containing products, strong P-gp and CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampicin, 
carbamazepine, St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum), phenobarbital, phenytoin, and primidone) 
(see section 4.5).
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Hepatitis B virus reactivation
Cases of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, some of them fatal, have been reported during or after 
treatment with direct acting antiviral agents. HBV screening should be performed in all patients before 
initiation of treatment. HBV/HCV co-infected patients are at risk of HBV reactivation, and should, 
therefore, be monitored and managed according to current clinical guidelines.
Hepatic impairment
Maviret is not recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B) and is 
contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) (see sections 4.2, 4.3, and 
5.2).
Patients who failed a prior regimen containing an NS5A- and/or an NS3/4A-inhibitor
Genotype 1-infected (and a very limited number of genotype 4-infected) patients with prior failure on 
regimens that may confer resistance to glecaprevir/pibrentasvir were studied in studies
MAGELLAN-1 and B16-439 (section 5.1). The risk of failure was, as expected, highest for those 
exposed to both classes. A resistance algorithm predictive of the risk for failure by baseline resistance 
has not been established. Accumulating double class resistance was a general finding for patients who 
failed re-treatment with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir in MAGELLAN-1. No re-treatment data is available 
for patients infected with genotypes 2, 3, 5 or 6. Maviret is not recommended for the re-treatment of 
patients with prior exposure to NS3/4A- and/or NS5A inhibitors.
28
Drug-drug interactions
Co-administration is not recommended with several medicinal products as detailed in section 4.5.
Use in diabetic patients
Diabetics may experience improved glucose control, potentially resulting in symptomatic 
hypoglycaemia, after initiating HCV direct acting antiviral treatment. Glucose levels of diabetic 
patients initiating direct acting antiviral therapy should be closely monitored, particularly within the 
first 3 months, and their diabetic medicine modified when necessary. The physician in charge of the 
diabetic care of the patient should be informed when direct acting antiviral therapy is initiated.
Lactose
Maviret granules contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total 
lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.
Propylene glycol
This medicinal product contains 4 mg propylene glycol in each sachet.
Sodium
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per sachet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Potential for Maviret to affect other medicinal products
Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir are inhibitors of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein 
(BCRP), and organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1/3. Co-administration with Maviret 
may increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products that are substrates of P-gp (e.g. dabigatran 
etexilate, digoxin), BCRP (e.g. rosuvastatin), or OATP1B1/3 (e.g. atorvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, 
rosuvastatin, simvastatin). See Table 4 for specific recommendations on interactions with sensitive 
substrates of P-gp, BCRP, and OATP1B1/3. For other P-gp, BCRP, or OATP1B1/3 substrates, dose 
adjustment may be needed.
Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir are weak inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A and uridine 
glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 in vivo. Clinically significant increases in exposure were not 
observed for sensitive substrates of CYP3A (midazolam, felodipine) or UGT1A1 (raltegravir) when 
administered with Maviret.
Both glecaprevir and pibrentasvir inhibit the bile salt export pump (BSEP) in vitro.
Significant inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, UGT1A4, 
UGT2B7, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, MATE1 or MATE2K are not expected.
Patients treated with vitamin K antagonists
As liver function may change during treatment with Maviret, a close monitoring of International 
Normalised Ratio (INR) values is recommended.
29
Potential for other medicinal products to affect Maviret
Use with strong P-gp/CYP3A inducers
Medicinal products that are strong P-gp and CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampicin, carbamazepine, St. 
John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum), phenobarbital, phenytoin, and primidone) could significantly 
decrease glecaprevir or pibrentasvir plasma concentrations and may lead to reduced therapeutic effect 
of Maviret or loss of virologic response. Co-administration of such medicinal products with Maviret is 
contraindicated (see section 4.3).
Co-administration of Maviret with medicinal products that are moderate inducers P-gp/CYP3A may 
decrease glecaprevir and pibrentasvir plasma concentrations (e.g. oxcarbazepine, eslicarbazepine, 
lumacaftor, crizotinib). Co-administration of moderate inducers is not recommended (see section 4.4).
Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir are substrates of the efflux transporters P-gp and/or BCRP. Glecaprevir is 
also a substrate of the hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1/3. Co-administration of Maviret with 
medicinal products that inhibit P-gp and BCRP (e.g. ciclosporin, cobicistat, dronedarone, itraconazole, 
ketoconazole, ritonavir) may slow elimination of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir and thereby increase 
plasma exposure of the antivirals. Medicinal products that inhibit OATP1B1/3 (e.g. elvitegravir, 
ciclosporin, darunavir, lopinavir) increase systemic concentrations of glecaprevir.
Established and other potential medicinal product interactions
Table 4 provides the least-squares mean Ratio (90% Confidence Interval) effect on concentration of 
Maviret and some common concomitant medicinal products. The direction of the arrow indicates the 
direction of the change in exposures (Cmax, AUC, and Cmin) in glecaprevir, pibrentasvir, and the 
co-administered medicinal product (↑ = increase (more than 25%), ↓ = decrease (more than 20%)), 
↔ = no change (equal to or less than 20% decrease or 25% increase). This is not an exclusive list. All 
interaction studies were performed in adults.

4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of glecaprevir 
or pibrentasvir in pregnant women.
Studies in rats/mice with glecaprevir or pibrentasvir do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects 
with respect to reproductive toxicity. Maternal toxicity associated with embryo-foetal loss has been 
observed in the rabbit with glecaprevir which precluded evaluation of glecaprevir at clinical exposures 
in this species (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, Maviret use is not recommended in 
pregnancy.
Breast-feeding
It is unknown whether glecaprevir or pibrentasvir are excreted in human milk. Available 
pharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir in milk (for 
details see section 5.3). A risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. A decision must be made 
whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Maviret therapy taking into 
account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.
Fertility
No human data on the effect of glecaprevir and/or pibrentasvir on fertility are available. Animal 
studies do not indicate harmful effects of glecaprevir or pibrentasvir on fertility at exposures higher 
than the exposures in humans at the recommended dose (see section 5.3).

Maviret has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
In pooled Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies of adult subjects receiving Maviret with genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 
or 6 HCV infection the most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 10%) were headache 
and fatigue. Less than 0.1% of subjects treated with Maviret had serious adverse reactions (transient 
ischaemic attack). The proportion of subjects treated with Maviret who permanently discontinued 
treatment due to adverse reactions was 0.1%.
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
The following adverse reactions were identified in registrational Phase 2 and 3 studies in HCV-
infected adults with or without cirrhosis treated with Maviret for 8, 12 or 16 weeks, or during post-
marketing experience. The adverse reactions are listed below by body system organ class and 
frequency. Frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), 
uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000), very rare (< 1/10 000) or not known 
(cannot be estimated from the available data).

Adverse reactions in subjects with severe renal impairment including subjects on dialysis
The safety of Maviret in subjects with chronic kidney disease (including subjects on dialysis) and 
genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 chronic HCV infection with compensated liver disease (with or without 
cirrhosis) was assessed in adults in EXPEDITION-4 (n=104) and EXPEDITION-5 (n=101). The most 
common adverse reactions in subjects with severe renal impairment were pruritus (17%) and fatigue 
(12%) in EXPEDITION-4 and pruritus (14.9%) in EXPEDITION-5.
Adverse reactions in subjects with liver or kidney transplant
The safety of Maviret was assessed in 100 post-liver or -kidney transplant adult recipients with 
genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 chronic HCV infection without cirrhosis (MAGELLAN-2). The overall 
safety profile in transplant recipients was comparable to that observed in subjects in the Phase 2 and 3 
studies. Adverse reactions observed in greater than or equal to 5% of subjects receiving Maviret for 12 
weeks were headache (17%), fatigue (16%), nausea (8%) and pruritus (7%).
Safety in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected subjects
The overall safety profile in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected adult subjects (ENDURANCE-1 and 
EXPEDITION-2) was comparable to that observed in HCV mono-infected adult subjects.
Paediatric population
The safety of Maviret in HCV GT1-6 infected adolescents is based on data from a Phase 2/3 open-
label study in 47 subjects aged 12 years to < 18 years treated with Maviret tablets for 8 to 16 weeks
(DORA Part 1). The adverse reactions observed were comparable with those observed in clinical 
studies of Maviret in adults.
The safety of Maviret in HCV GT1-6 infected children aged 3 to less than 12 years is based on data 
from a Phase 2/3 open-label study in 80 subjects aged 3 to < 12 years treated with weight-based 
Maviret coated granules for 8, 12, or 16 weeks (DORA Part 2). The pattern of adverse reactions 
observed was comparable with that observed in clinical studies of Maviret film-coated tablets in 
adolescents and adults. Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting occurred at a slightly higher frequency in 
paediatric subjects compared to adolescents (adverse reactions: 3.8% vs. 0%, 3.8% vs. 0%, and 7.5% 
vs. 2.1% respectively).
Serum bilirubin elevations
Elevations in total bilirubin of at least 2x upper limit normal (ULN) were observed in 1.3% of subjects 
related to glecaprevir-mediated inhibition of bilirubin transporters and metabolism. Bilirubin 
elevations were asymptomatic, transient, and typically occurred early during treatment. Bilirubin 
36
elevations were predominantly indirect and not associated with ALT elevations. Direct 
hyperbilirubinemia was reported in 0.3% of subjects.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
The highest documented doses administered to healthy volunteers is 1 200 mg once daily for 7 days 
for glecaprevir and 600 mg once daily for 10 days for pibrentasvir. Asymptomatic serum ALT 
elevations (> 5x ULN) were observed in 1 out of 70 healthy subjects following multiple doses of 
glecaprevir (700 mg or 800 mg) once daily for ≥ 7 days. In case of overdose, the patient should be 
monitored for any signs and symptoms of toxicities (see section 4.8). Appropriate symptomatic 
treatment should be instituted immediately. Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir are not significantly removed 
by haemodialysis.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, direct acting antivirals, ATC code: J05AP57
Mechanism of action
Maviret is a fixed-dose combination of two pan-genotypic, direct acting antiviral agents, glecaprevir 
(NS3/4A protease inhibitor) and pibrentasvir (NS5A inhibitor), targeting multiple steps in the HCV 
viral lifecycle.
Glecaprevir
Glecaprevir is a pan-genotypic inhibitor of the HCV NS3/4A protease, which is necessary for the 
proteolytic cleavage of the HCV encoded polyprotein (into mature forms of the NS3, NS4A, NS4B, 
NS5A, and NS5B proteins) and is essential for viral replication.
Pibrentasvir
Pibrentasvir is a pan-genotypic inhibitor of HCV NS5A, which is essential for viral RNA replication 
and virion assembly. The mechanism of action of pibrentasvir has been characterised based on cell 
culture antiviral activity and drug resistance mapping studies.
Antiviral activity
The EC50 values of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir against full-length or chimeric replicons encoding 
NS3 or NS5A from laboratory strains are presented in Table 6.

Resistance
In cell culture
Amino acid substitutions in NS3 or NS5A selected in cell culture or important for the inhibitor class 
were phenotypically characterised in replicons.
38
Substitutions important for the HCV protease inhibitor class at positions 36, 43, 54, 55, 56, 155, 166, 
or 170 in NS3 had no impact on glecaprevir activity. Substitutions at amino acid position 168 in NS3 
had no impact in genotype 2, while some substitutions at position 168 reduced glecaprevir 
susceptibility by up to 55-fold (genotypes 1, 3, 4), or reduced susceptibility by > 100-fold (genotype 
6). Some substitutions at position 156 reduced susceptibility to glecaprevir (genotypes 1 to 4) by 
> 100-fold. Substitutions at amino acid position 80 did not reduce susceptibility to glecaprevir except 
for Q80R in genotype 3a, which reduced susceptibility to glecaprevir by 21-fold.
Single substitutions important for the NS5A inhibitor class at positions 24, 28, 30, 31, 58, 92, or 93 in 
NS5A in genotypes 1 to 6 had no impact on the activity of pibrentasvir. Specifically in genotype 3a, 
A30K or Y93H had no impact on pibrentasvir activity. Some combinations of substitutions in 
genotypes 1a and 3a (including A30K+Y93H in genotype 3a) showed reductions in susceptibility to 
pibrentasvir. In genotype 3b replicon, the presence of naturally occurring polymorphisms K30 and 
M31 in NS5A reduced susceptibility to pibrentasvir by 24-fold relative to the activity of pibrentasvir 
in genotype 3a replicon.
In clinical studies
Studies in treatment-naïve and peginterferon (pegIFN), ribavirin (RBV) and/or sofosbuvir treatment-
experienced adult subjects with or without cirrhosis
Twenty-two of the approximately 2 300 adult subjects treated with Maviret for 8, 12, or 16 weeks in 
registrational Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies experienced virologic failure (2 with genotype 1, 2 with 
genotype 2, 18 with genotype 3 infection).
Among the 2 genotype 1-infected subjects who experienced virologic failure, one had treatment-
emergent substitutions A156V in NS3 and Q30R/L31M/H58D in NS5A, and one had Q30R/H58D 
(while Y93N was present at baseline and post-treatment) in NS5A.
Among the 2 genotype 2-infected subjects, no treatment-emergent substitutions were observed in NS3 
or NS5A (the M31 polymorphism in NS5A was present at baseline and post-treatment in both 
subjects).
Among the 18 genotype 3-infected subjects treated with Maviret for 8, 12, or 16 weeks who 
experienced virologic failure, treatment-emergent NS3 substitutions Y56H/N, Q80K/R, A156G, or 
Q168L/R were observed in 11 subjects. A166S or Q168R were present at baseline and post-treatment 
in 5 subjects. Treatment-emergent NS5A substitutions M28G, A30G/K, L31F, P58T, or Y93H were 
observed in 16 subjects, and 13 subjects had A30K (n=9) or Y93H (n=5) at baseline and post-
treatment.
Studies in adult subjects with or without compensated cirrhosis who were treatment-experienced to 
NS3/4A protease and/or NS5A inhibitors
Ten of 113 subjects treated with Maviret in the MAGELLAN-1 study for 12 or 16 weeks experienced 
virologic failure. Among the 10 genotype 1-infected subjects with virologic failure, treatment-
emergent NS3 substitutions V36A/M, R155K/T, A156G/T/V, or D168A/T were observed in 7 
subjects. Five of the 10 had combinations of V36M, Y56H, R155K/T, or D168A/E in NS3 at baseline 
and post-treatment. All of the genotype 1-infected virologic failure subjects had one or more NS5A 
substitutions L/M28M/T/V, Q30E/G/H/K/L/R, L31M, P32 deletion, H58C/D, or Y93H at baseline, 
with additional treatment-emergent NS5A substitutions M28A/G, P29Q/R, Q30K, H58D, or Y93H 
observed in 7 of the subjects at the time of failure.
Thirteen of the 177 subjects with chronic HCV GT1 infection (all virologic failures had GT1a 
infection) who were treatment-experienced with NS5A inhibitor + SOF treated with Maviret in study 
B16-439 for 12 weeks (9 out of 13) or 16 weeks (4 out of 13) experienced virologic failure. Among 
the 13 virologic failures, treatment-emergent NS3 substitutions were observed in 4 subjects at the time 
of failure: A156V (n = 2) or R155W + A156G (n = 2); 3 of these 4 subjects also had Q80K at baseline 
39
and at the time of failure. Twelve of 13 virologic failures had one or more NS5A polymorphisms 
detected at signature amino acid positions (M28V/T, Q30E/H/N/R, L31M/V, H58D, E62D/Q, or 
Y93H/N) at baseline, and 10 of 13 developed additional NS5A substitutions (M28A/S/T (n = 3), 
Q30N (n = 1), L31M/V (n = 2), P32del (n = 1), H58D (n = 4), E62D (n = 1)) at time of treatment 
failure.
Effect of baseline HCV amino acid polymorphisms on treatment response
A pooled analysis of treatment-naïve and pegylated interferon, ribavirin and/or sofosbuvir treatment-
experienced adult subjects receiving Maviret in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies was conducted 
to explore the association between baseline polymorphisms and treatment outcome and to describe 
substitutions seen upon virologic failure. Baseline polymorphisms relative to a subtype-specific 
reference sequence at amino acid positions 155, 156, and 168 in NS3, and 24, 28, 30, 31, 58, 92, and 
93 in NS5A were evaluated at a 15% detection threshold by next-generation sequencing. Baseline 
polymorphisms in NS3 were detected in 1.1% (9/845), 0.8% (3/398), 1.6% (10/613), 1.2% (2/164), 
41.9% (13/31), and 2.9% (1/34) of subjects with HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 infection, 
respectively. Baseline polymorphisms in NS5A were detected in 26.8% (225/841), 79.8% (331/415), 
22.1% (136/615), 49.7% (80/161), 12.9% (4/31), and 54.1% (20/37) of subjects with HCV genotype 1, 
2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 infection, respectively.
Genotype 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6: Baseline polymorphisms in genotypes 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 had no impact on 
treatment outcome.
Genotype 3: For subjects who received the recommended regimen (n=313), baseline polymorphisms 
in NS5A (Y93H included) or NS3 did not have a relevant impact on treatment outcomes. All subjects 
(15/15) with Y93H and 77% (17/22) with A30K in NS5A at baseline achieved SVR12. The overall 
prevalence of A30K and Y93H at baseline was 7.0% and 4.8%, respectively. The ability to assess the 
impact of baseline polymorphisms in NS5A was limited among treatment-naïve subjects with cirrhosis 
and treatment-experienced subjects due to low prevalence of A30K (3.0%, 4/132) or Y93H (3.8%, 
5/132).
Cross-resistance
In vitro data indicate that the majority of the resistance-associated substitutions in NS5A at amino acid 
positions 24, 28, 30, 31, 58, 92, or 93 that confer resistance to ombitasvir, daclatasvir, ledipasvir, 
elbasvir, or velpatasvir remained susceptible to pibrentasvir. Some combinations of NS5A 
substitutions at these positions showed reductions in susceptibility to pibrentasvir. Glecaprevir was 
fully active against resistance-associated substitutions in NS5A, while pibrentasvir was fully active 
against resistance-associated substitutions in NS3. Both glecaprevir and pibrentasvir were fully active 
against substitutions associated with resistance to NS5B nucleotide and non-nucleotide inhibitors.

Serum HCV RNA values were measured during the clinical studies using the Roche COBAS 
AmpliPrep/COBAS Taqman HCV test (version 2.0) with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 
15 IU/mL (except for SURVEYOR-1 and SURVEYOR-2 which used the Roche COBAS TaqMan 
real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) assay v. 2.0 with an LLOQ of 25 IU/mL). Sustained 
virologic response (SVR12), defined as HCV RNA less than LLOQ at 12 weeks after the cessation of 
treatment, was the primary endpoint in all the studies to determine the HCV cure rate.
Clinical studies in treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced subjects with or without cirrhosis
Of the 2 409 adult subjects with compensated liver disease (with or without cirrhosis) treated who 
were treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced to combinations of peginterferon, ribavirin and/or 
sofosbuvir, the median age was 53 years (range: 19 to 88); 73.3% were treatment-naïve, 26.7% were 
treatment-experienced to a combination containing either sofosbuvir, ribavirin and/or peginterferon; 
40.3% were HCV genotype 1; 19.8% were HCV genotype 2; 27.8% were HCV genotype 3; 8.1% 
were HCV genotype 4; 3.4% were HCV genotype 5-6; 13.1% were ≥ 65 years; 56.6% were male; 
6.2% were Black; 12.3% had cirrhosis; 4.3% had severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease; 
20.0% had a body mass index of at least 30 kg per m2; 7.7% had HIV-1 coinfection and the median 
baseline HCV RNA level was 6.2 log10 IU/mL.

b. Includes a total of 154 subjects coinfected with HIV-1 in ENDURANCE-1 and EXPEDITION-2 
who received the recommended duration.
c. Relapse is defined as HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ after end-of-treatment response among those who 
completed treatment.
d. Includes subjects who discontinued due to adverse event, lost to follow-up, or subject withdrawal.
Of the genotype 1-, 2-, 4-, 5-, or 6 infected subjects with end stage renal disease enrolled in 
EXPEDITION-4, 97.8% (91/93) achieved SVR12 with no virologic failures.
Clinical study in subjects with genotype 5 or 6 infection
ENDURANCE-5,6 was an open-label study in 84 HCV GT5 (N=23) or 6 infected (N=61) TN or 
TE-PRS adult subjects. Subjects without cirrhosis received Maviret for 8 weeks, and subjects with 
compensated cirrhosis received Maviret for 12 weeks. Of the 84 subjects treated, the median age was 
59 years (range 24-79); 27% had HCV genotype 5, 73% had HCV genotype 6; 54% were female, 30% 
were White, 68% were Asian; 90% were HCV TN; 11% had compensated cirrhosis.
The overall SVR12 rate was 97.6% (82/84). The SVR12 rate was 95.7% (22/23) for GT5-infected 
subjects and 98.4% (60/61) for GT6-infected subjects. One TN GT5-infected subject without cirrhosis 
experienced relapse, and one TN GT6-infected subject with compensated cirrhosis experienced on-
treatment virologic failure.
Subjects with genotype 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 infection with cirrhosis who received 8 weeks of Maviret
The safety and efficacy of Maviret given for 8 weeks in GT 1, 2, 4, 5 or 6 treatment-naïve adult 
subjects with compensated cirrhosis was evaluated in a single-arm, open-label study 
(EXPEDITION-8).
Of the 280 subjects treated, the median age was 60 years (range: 34 to 88); 81.8% had HCV genotype 
1, 10% had HCV genotype 2, 4.6% had HCV genotype 4, 0.4% had HCV genotype 5; 3.2% had HCV 
genotype 6; 60% were male; 9.6% were Black.
The overall SVR12 rate was 98.2% (275/280). There were no virologic failures.
Subjects with genotype 3 infection
The efficacy of Maviret in subjects who were treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced to 
combinations of peginterferon, ribavirin and/or sofosbuvir with genotype 3 chronic hepatitis C 
infection was demonstrated in the ENDURANCE-3 (treatment-naïve adults without cirrhosis),
EXPEDITION-8 (treatment-naïve adults with cirrhosis), and SURVEYOR-2 Part 3 (adults with and 
without cirrhosis and/or treatment-experienced) clinical studies.
ENDURANCE-3 was a partially-randomised, open-label, active-controlled study in treatment-naïve 
genotype 3-infected subjects. Subjects were randomised (2:1) to either Maviret for 12 weeks or the 
combination of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir for 12 weeks; subsequently the study included a third arm 
(which was non-randomised) with Maviret for 8 weeks. EXPEDITION-8 was a single-arm, open-label 
study in treatment-naïve subjects with compensated cirrhosis and genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 infection 
who received Maviret for 8 weeks. SURVEYOR-2 Part 3 was an open-label study that evaluated the 
efficacy of Maviret in treatment-experienced genotype 3-infected subjects without cirrhosis and with 
compensated cirrhosis for 16-weeks. Among treatment-experienced subjects, 46% (42/91) failed a 
previous regimen containing sofosbuvir.

(11/11) achieved SVR12.
Subjects with genotype 3b infection
GT3b is a subtype reported in a relatively small number of HCV infected patients in China and a few 
countries in South and Southeast Asia, but rarely outside of this region. Studies VOYAGE-1 and 
VOYAGE-2 were conducted in China, Singapore, and South Korea in HCV genotype 1-6 adult 
subjects without cirrhosis (VOYAGE-1) or with compensated cirrhosis (VOYAGE-2) that were 
treatment-naïve (TN) or treatment-experienced to combinations of interferon, peg interferon, ribavirin 
and/or sofosbuvir (TE-PRS). All subjects without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis received 8 
or 12 weeks of Maviret, respectively, except GT3 TE-PRS subjects who received 16 weeks of 
44
Maviret. The overall SVR12 rates were 97.2% (352/362) and 99.4% (159/160) in VOYAGE-1 and 
VOYAGE-2, respectively.
Among GT3b subjects without cirrhosis, a numerically lower SVR12 rate of 58.3% (7/12) [62.5% 
(5/8) for TN subjects and 50% (2/4) for TE-PRS subjects] was observed compared to GT3a subjects 
without cirrhosis (92.9% (13/14)). Three GT3b TN subjects experienced relapse and two GT3b 
TE-PRS subjects experienced on-treatment virologic failure. Among subjects with compensated 
cirrhosis, the overall SVR12 rate for GT3b infected subjects was 87.5% (7/8) [85.7% (6/7) for TN 
subjects and 100% (1/1) for TE-PRS subjects] and 100% (6/6) for GT3a infected subjects. One GT3b 
TN subject experienced relapse.
Overall SVR12 rate from the clinical studies in treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced adult 
subjects with or without cirrhosis
In subjects who are treatment-naïve (TN) or treatment-experienced to combinations of interferon, 
peginterferon, ribavirin and/or sofosbuvir (TE-PRS) who received the recommended duration, 97.5% 
(1 395/1 431) achieved SVR12 overall, while 0.2% (3/1 431) experienced on-treatment virologic 
failure and 0.9% (12/1 407) experienced post-treatment relapse.
In TN or TE-PRS subjects with compensated cirrhosis who received the recommended duration, 
97.1% (431/444) achieved SVR12 (among which 97.7% [335/343] of TN subjects achieved SVR12), 
while 0.2% (1/444) experienced on-treatment virologic failure and 0.9% (4/434) experienced post-
treatment relapse.
In TN subjects without cirrhosis who received the recommended duration of 8 weeks, 97.5% 
(749/768) achieved SVR12, while 0.1% (1/768) experienced on-treatment virologic failure and 0.7% 
(5/755) experienced post-treatment relapse.
In TE-PRS subjects without cirrhosis who received the recommended duration, 98.2% (215/219) 
achieved SVR12, while 0.5% (1/219) experienced on-treatment virologic failure and 1.4% (3/218) 
experienced post-treatment relapse.
The presence of HIV-1 coinfection did not impact efficacy. The SVR12 rate in TN or TE-PRS 
HCV/HIV-1 co-infected subjects treated for 8 or 12 weeks (without cirrhosis and with compensated 
cirrhosis, respectively) was 98.2% (165/168) from ENDURANCE-1 and EXPEDITION-2. One 
subject experienced on-treatment virologic failure (0.6%, 1/168) and no subjects relapsed (0%, 0/166).
Clinical study in liver or kidney transplant recipients
MAGELLAN-2 was a single-arm, open-label study in 100 post-liver or -kidney transplant HCV 
GT1-6 infected adult subjects without cirrhosis who received Maviret for 12 weeks. The study 
included subjects who were HCV treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced to combinations of (peg) 
interferon, ribavirin, and/or sofosbuvir, with the exception of GT3-infected subjects who were all 
treatment-naïve.
Of the 100 subjects treated, the median age was 60 years (range: 39 to 78); 57% had HCV genotype 1, 
13% had HCV genotype 2, 24% had HCV genotype 3, 4% had HCV genotype 4, 2% had HCV 
genotype 6; 75% were male; 8% were Black; 66% were HCV treatment-naïve; none had cirrhosis and 
80% had a baseline fibrosis state of F0 or F1; 80% of subjects were post-liver transplant and 20% were 
post-kidney transplant. Immunosuppressants allowed for co-administration were ciclosporin 
≤ 100 mg/day, tacrolimus, sirolimus, everolimus, azathioprine, mycophenolic acid, prednisone, and 
prednisolone.
The overall SVR12 rate in post-transplant subjects was 98.0% (98/100). There was one relapse and no 
on-treatment virologic failure.
45
Clinical study in renally impaired subjects
EXPEDITION-5 was an open-label study in 101 HCV GT1-6 infected adult subjects without cirrhosis 
or with compensated cirrhosis and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3b, 4, or 5. Subjects were 
either treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced to combinations of (peg) interferon, ribavirin, and/or 
sofosbuvir and received Maviret for 8, 12, or 16 weeks per approved treatment durations.
Of the 101 subjects treated, the median age was 58 years (range 32-87); 53% had HCV genotype 1; 
27% had HCV genotype 2; 15% had HCV genotype 3; 4% had HCV genotype 4; 59% were male; 
73% were White; 80% were HCV treatment-naïve; 13% had cirrhosis and 65% had a baseline fibrosis 
state of F0 or F1; 7% were CKD stage 3b; 17% were CKD Stage 4, and 76% were CKD Stage 5 (all 
receiving dialysis); 84 subjects received 8 weeks of treatment, 13 subjects received 12 weeks of 
treatment, and 4 subjects received 16 weeks of treatment.
The overall SVR12 rate was 97% (98/101). There were no virologic failures.
Durability of sustained virologic response
In a long-term follow-up study (M13-576), 99.5% (374/376) of adult subjects who had achieved 
SVR12 in prior clinical studies of Maviret maintained SVR up to their last follow-up visit (median 
duration of follow-up: 35.5 months): 100%, 99.6%, and 95.8% of subjects who had received 8, 12, and 
16 weeks of Maviret therapy, respectively. Among the 2 subjects who did not maintain SVR, 1 
experienced a late relapse 390 days after Maviret therapy, and the other subject experienced re-
infection with a different HCV genotype.
Elderly
Clinical studies of Maviret included 328 patients aged 65 and over (13.8% of the total number of 
subjects). The response rates observed for patients ≥ 65 years of age were similar to that of patients 
< 65 years of age, across treatment groups.
Paediatric population
The efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of Maviret in children 3 years to less than 18 years old was 
demonstrated in an open-label study which was comprised of two parts, DORA Part 1 and Part 2.
DORA Part 1 evaluated the safety and efficacy of Maviret 300 mg/120 mg (three 100 mg/40 mg 
film-coated tablets) for 8 or 16 weeks in 47 adolescents aged 12 years to less than 18 years. The 
median age was 14 years (range: 12 to 17); 79% had HCV genotype 1, 6% had HCV genotype 2, 9% 
had HCV genotype 3, 6% had HCV genotype 4; 55% were female; 11% were Black; 77% were HCV 
treatment-naïve; 23% were treatment-experienced to interferon; 4% had HIV-coinfection; none had 
cirrhosis; the mean weight was 59 kg (range: 32 to 109).
In DORA Part 1, the overall SVR12 rate was 100% (47/47). No subject experienced virologic failure.
DORA Part 2 evaluated the safety and efficacy of weight-based dosing of Maviret granules for 8, 12 
or 16 weeks in 80 children aged 3 years to less than 12 years. 18 subjects received the initial lower 
dose, and 62 subjects received the final recommended dose. The median age was 7 years (range: 3 to 
11); 73% had HCV genotype 1, 3% had genotype 2, 23% had HCV genotype 3, 3% had HCV 
genotype 4; 55% were female; 6% were Black; 97.5% were HCV TN; 2.5% were treatment-
experienced to interferon; 1% had HIV-coinfection; none had cirrhosis; the mean weight was 26 kg 
(range: 13 to 44).
In DORA Part 2, the overall SVR12 rate for the subjects who received the final recommended dose 
was 98.4% (61/62). No subject taking the final recommended dose experienced virologic failure. One 
9 year old child with HCV GT3b infection, who had received the initial lower dose, experienced 
virologic failure. The child had K30R and V31M at baseline and treatment-emergent Y93H at relapse 
in NS5A; baseline or treatment-emergent substitutions were not detected in NS3.

b. Mean systemic exposure with moderate to high fat meals.
c. Single dose administration of [14C]glecaprevir or [14C]pibrentasvir in mass balance studies.
d. Oxidative metabolites or their byproducts accounted for 26% of radioactive dose. No glecaprevir 
metabolites were observed in plasma.
In patients with chronic hepatitis C infection without cirrhosis, following 3 days of monotherapy with 
either glecaprevir 300 mg per day (N=6) or pibrentasvir 120 mg per day (N=8) alone, geometric mean 
AUC24 values were 13 600 ng•h/mL for glecaprevir and 459 ng•h/mL for pibrentasvir. Estimation of 
the pharmacokinetic parameters using population pharmacokinetic models has inherent uncertainty 
due to dose non-linearity and cross interaction between glecaprevir and pibrentasvir. Based on 
population pharmacokinetic models for Maviret in chronic hepatitis C patients, steady-state AUC24
values for glecaprevir and pibrentasvir were 4 800 and 1 430 ng•h/mL in subjects without cirrhosis 
(N=1 804), and 10 500 and 1 530 ng•h/mL in subjects with cirrhosis (N=280), respectively. Relative to 
healthy subjects (N=230), population estimates of AUC24, ss were similar (10% difference) for 
glecaprevir and 34% lower for pibrentasvir in HCV-infected patients without cirrhosis.
Linearity/non-linearity
Glecaprevir AUC increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner (1 200 mg QD had 516-fold 
higher exposure than 200 mg QD) which may be related to saturation of uptake and efflux 
transporters.
Pibrentasvir AUC increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner at doses up to 120 mg, (over 
10-fold exposure increase at 120 mg QD compared to 30 mg QD), but exhibited linear 
pharmacokinetics at doses ≥ 120 mg. The non-linear exposure increase < 120 mg may be related to 
saturation of efflux transporters.
47
Pibrentasvir bioavailability when co-administered with glecaprevir is 3-fold of pibrentasvir alone. 
Glecaprevir is affected to a lower extent by co-administration with pibrentasvir.
Pharmacokinetics in special populations
Race/ethnicity
No dose adjustment of Maviret is required based on race or ethnicity.
Gender
No dose adjustment of Maviret is required based on gender.
Elderly
No dose adjustment of Maviret is required in elderly patients. Population pharmacokinetic analysis in 
HCV-infected subjects showed that within the age range (12 to 88 years) analysed, age did not have a 
clinically relevant effect on the exposure to glecaprevir or pibrentasvir.
Paediatric population
At the recommended doses according to the patient’s body weight, exposures of glecaprevir and 
pibrentasvir in children aged 3 to < 12 years fell within the efficacious exposure range in adults from 
Phase 2/3 studies. Maviret is available as a tablet for children 12 years to less than 18 years or 
weighing more than 45 kg. The granules were not studied in children greater than 12 years old. Tablets
and the granules are not interchangeable. The pharmacokinetics of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir have 
not been established in children < 3 years of age or under 12 kg in weight.
Renal impairment
Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir AUC were increased ≤ 56% in non-HCV infected subjects with mild, 
moderate, severe, or end stage renal impairment not on dialysis compared to subjects with normal 
renal function. Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir AUC were similar with and without dialysis (≤ 18% 
difference) in dialysis-dependent non-HCV infected subjects. In population pharmacokinetic analysis 
of HCV-infected subjects, 86% higher glecaprevir and 54% higher pibrentasvir AUC were observed 
for subjects with end stage renal disease, with or without dialysis, compared to subjects with normal 
renal function. Larger increases may be expected when unbound concentration is considered.
Overall, the changes in exposures of Maviret in HCV-infected subjects with renal impairment with or 
without dialysis were not clinically significant.
Hepatic impairment
At the clinical dose, compared to non-HCV infected subjects with normal hepatic function, glecaprevir 
AUC was 33% higher in Child-Pugh A subjects, 100% higher in Child-Pugh B subjects, and increased 
to 11-fold in Child-Pugh C subjects. Pibrentasvir AUC was similar in Child-Pugh A subjects, 26% 
higher in Child-Pugh B subjects, and 114% higher in Child-Pugh C subjects. Larger increases may be 
expected when unbound concentration is considered.
Population pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that following administration of Maviret in HCV-
infected subjects with compensated cirrhosis, exposure of glecaprevir was approximately 2-fold and 
pibrentasvir exposure was similar to non-cirrhotic HCV-infected subjects. The mechanism for the 
differences between glecaprevir exposure in chronic Hepatitis C patients with or without cirrhosis is 
unknown.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir were not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo assays, including 
bacterial mutagenicity, chromosome aberration using human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in vivo
rodent micronucleus assays. Carcinogenicity studies with glecaprevir and pibrentasvir have not been 
conducted.
48
No effects on mating, female or male fertility, or early embryonic development were observed in 
rodents at up to the highest dose tested. Systemic exposures (AUC) to glecaprevir and pibrentasvir 
were approximately 63 and 102 times higher, respectively, than the exposure in humans at the 
recommended dose.
In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed when the components 
of Maviret were administered separately during organogenesis at exposures up to 53 times (rats; 
glecaprevir) or 51 and 1.5 times (mice and rabbits, respectively; pibrentasvir) the human exposures at 
the recommended dose of Maviret. Maternal toxicity (anorexia, lower body weight, and lower body 
weight gain) with some embryofoetal toxicity (increase in post-implantation loss and number of 
resorptions and a decrease in mean foetal body weight), precluded the ability to evaluate glecaprevir in 
the rabbit at clinical exposures. There were no developmental effects with either compound in rodent 
peri/postnatal developmental studies in which maternal systemic exposures (AUC) to glecaprevir and 
pibrentasvir were approximately 47 and 74 times, respectively, the exposure in humans at the 
recommended dose. Unchanged glecaprevir was the main component observed in the milk of lactating 
rats without effect on nursing pups. Pibrentasvir was the only component observed in the milk of 
lactating rats without effect on nursing pups.

7. Instructions for use
Please read all of section 7 before using Maviret granules in sachets.
Step 1. Get the number of sachets as advised by your child’s doctor
Weight of child (kg)
From 12 to less than 20 kg
From 20 to less than 30 kg
From 30 to less than 45 kg
Number of sachets once daily 
3 sachets 
4 sachets 
5 sachets 
Food Amount (approximate)
About 1-2 teaspoons (5-10 mL) 
of recommended food listed in 
step 2
For children weighing 45 kg or more, talk to your child’s doctor about giving Maviret tablets.
Do not give more than 5 sachets.
Step 2. Choose suitable food to mix with Maviret granules
Suitable food should stick to the spoon. It must be soft, low in water content 
and can be swallowed without chewing.
Example of recommended foods:
 Greek yogurt
 Cream/soft cheese
 Peanut butter
 Chocolate hazelnut spread
 Thick jam
 Other food that sticks to the spoon
Note: in addition to the food used to mix the granules, Maviret should also be 
taken at the same time or straight after a meal or snack. The food used to mix 
the granules does not replace the meal or snack to take with Maviret.
76
Do not use food if it drips off a spoon as the medicine may dissolve quickly, 
taste bitter, and become less effective. Do not use food that your child is 
allergic to.
Example of foods not to use:
✘ Liquids or watery food
✘ Apple sauce
✘ Food or liquid that is heated or frozen
✘ Bread or other food that requires chewing
✘ Non-Greek yogurt
✘ Baby food
✘ Food that drips off the spoon
For more information about suitable foods, contact your child’s doctor or 
pharmacist.
Step 3. Gather materials
Place the following on a clean surface:
Soft food
 Box with sachets in it

 Bowl to use for mixing
 Teaspoon

Scissors
Step 4. Measure food
 Place a small amount (1-2 teaspoons or 5-10 mL) of soft food into a bowl.
 The granules inside the sachets are very small, so placing food in the bowl 
first will help contain them.
Step 5. Prepare sachet
 Look for the dotted line on the sachet to find the top end.
 Hold the sachet upright and tap the top of the sachet. Keep tapping until all 
the granules inside fall to the bottom.
 Feel top area of sachet thoroughly to make sure all granules are at the 
bottom.
Step 6. Cut top of sachet
 Pinch the sachet in the centre, above the granules inside.
 Use scissors to cut the top of the sachet completely off.
Be Careful: Granules are very small and can fall out easily.
77
Step 7. Pour sachet
 Make sure the sachet is fully open.
 Carefully pour all granules (pink and yellow) out of the sachet into the bowl 
of food.
 Tap sachet to get all the granules out.
 Repeat for each sachet for your child’s daily dose.
Step 8. Check sachet
Look inside each sachet to make sure there are no granules left inside.
Do not leave any granules behind as the medicine will not work as well if the 
full dose is not taken.
Step 9. Mix
 Use the teaspoon to gently stir the granules into the food.
 Do not crush the granules. If the granules are crushed, they will taste bitter.
 Do not store the mixture, give it to your child immediately.
If not given within 5 minutes, the mixture may taste bitter.
If not given within 15 minutes, the medicine may be less effective. Throw away 
and start again.
Step 10. Give the medicine
 Scoop a small amount of mixture onto the teaspoon.
 Make sure your child swallows the mixture without chewing.
 Repeat until your child has taken all the mixture.
 If any granules are left, add more food and mix. Then finish the dose.
 Make sure your child takes the full dose of the medicine.
⚠ If your child misses a dose, see Section 3 “How to take Maviret” for further 
information.
Step 11. Confirm dose for tomorrow
Check to make sure there are enough sachets for your child’s next dose of 
Maviret.
For replacement sachets or to refill your prescription contact your child’s doctor 
or pharmacist.

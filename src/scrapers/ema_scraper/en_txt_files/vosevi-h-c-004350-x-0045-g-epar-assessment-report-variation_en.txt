2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
The natural history of chronic HCV infection in children is relatively benign. Most children are 
asymptomatic or have mild nonspecific symptoms; however, cirrhosis has been reported in 
approximately 1% to 2% of adolescents, and advanced liver disease and decompensated cirrhosis 
have been reported in children as young as 3 years of age. Disease progression also may occur many 
years after the initial infection. 
Other direct-acting antivirals (DAA) options in children: Sovaldi (SOF) and Harvoni (ledipasvir 
[LDV]/SOF) have been approved for the treatment of DAA-naive paediatric patients 3 to < 18 years old 
in the European Union (EU). Epclusa (an FDC of SOF and VEL; SOF/VEL) has also been approved for 
the treatment of DAA-naive paediatric patients 6 to < 18 years old in EU.  
It is anticipated that as more paediatric patients are treated for HCV with DAA-based therapies, the 
number of patients who fail those treatments will increase. However, retreatment options are limited 
for patients who fail DAA treatment, particularly regimens that include an NS5A inhibitor and/or NS5B 
inhibitor. 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Treatment of chronic HCV infection in patients aged 12 years and older. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Around 71 million individuals worldwide are chronically infected with HCV. The global prevalence in 
2018 of HCV infection in children aged 0 to 18 years has been estimated to be 0.13%, or 3.26 million 
children; over half (1.83 million) were aged 12 to 18 years old. Prevalence also varies by geographic 
location, with prevalence rates estimated to be 0.04% in Western Europe and 0.06% in the United 
States (US) compared with rates of 0.40% in Eastern Europe and up to 1.74% in Mongolia. 
Approximately 50% of the children with HCV infection were estimated to be living in Pakistan, China, 
India, and Nigeria. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The HCV has significant genetic (RNA sequence) variability; 8 major genotypes have been identified: 
genotypes 1 and 3 are the most prevalent globally (46% and 30%, respectively) while genotypes 2, 4, 
and 6 represent approximately 23% of cases, genotypes 5 and 7 plus recently 8 comprise < 1%. There 
is a regional predominance of certain genotypes. 
Hepatitis C is a blood-borne virus. Most infections occur as a result of sharing needles or other 
equipment to inject illicit drugs. HCV may or may not cause a short-term illness with features of acute 
hepatitis at the time of acquisition. About 70%–85% of infected persons do not clear the virus and 
therefore HCV becomes a long-term chronic infection. Chronic HCV infection is a serious disease that, 
left untreated, can be fatal due to decompensated liver cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC). Globally, 27% of all cirrhosis and 25% of all HCC are attributable to HCV infection. In addition, 
persons with chronic HCV infection may develop extra-hepatic manifestations, such as 
cryoglobulinaemia, renal disease and porphyria cutanea tarda.

Page 9/58 
 
 
 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation and diagnosis 
The natural history of chronic HCV infection in children is generally similar to that in adults, although 
HCV infection in children is typically relatively mild (Squires 2017). Most children chronically infected 
with HCV are asymptomatic or have mild, nonspecific symptoms. Clinical symptoms are present in 
approximately 20% of children in the first 4 years of life, with hepatomegaly being the most frequent 
sign (10%). Many, but not all, perinatally-infected children will have intermittently or persistently 
abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase levels, particularly in the first 
2 years of life. In children with vertical HCV infection who have undergone liver biopsy, the histological 
spectrum is usually mild, although severe liver disease is encountered {Mohan 2010}. Despite the 
overall more favourable prognosis compared with adults, approximately 4% to 6% of children with 
chronic HCV infection have evidence of advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis and some children eventually 
require liver transplantation as a consequence of HCV infection (Hu 2010), (Wirth 2012). In addition, 
HCV infection has been reported to negatively affect both the health-related quality of life and 
cognitive functioning of paediatric patients (Nydegger 2008), (Rodrigue 2009), (Abu Faddan 2015), 
(Annunziato 2017). 
2.1.5.  Management 
Curing chronic HCV infection is associated with more than 70% reduction in the risk of HCC and 90% 
reduction in the risk of liver related mortality and liver transplantation. 
HCV treatment has been transformed by the development and approval of DAAs that target viral 
proteins and cellular processes essential to HCV replication and which have activity against multiple 
HCV genotypes. Several of these agents with different viral targets are now available in fixed-dose 
combinations (FDC) form for once daily dosing for 12 weeks and have been associated with >90% cure 
rates. 
For patients who fail DAA only treatment with regimens that include an NS5A inhibitor the retreatment 
options are limited. However, SOF/VEL/VOX is recommended for such patients according to the current 
HCV treatment guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases 
(AASLD)/Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and European Association for the Study of the 
Liver (EASL).  
The high success rates with DAA regimens in adults with chronic HCV infection are increasingly being 
replicated in the paediatric population. Interferon and ribavirin exert general and paediatric-specific 
toxicities (e.g., temporary growth impairment) that do not occur with DAA regimens.  
About the product 
Vosevi (Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir/Voxilaprevir) is a fixed-dose combination product currently indicated for 
the treatment of patients with chronic HCV infection. Sofosbuvir is a nucleotide analogue non-structural 
protein NS5B polymerase inhibitor approved in EU for use in combination with other medicinal products 
for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection in adults and paediatric patients aged 3 years 
and above. Velpatasvir is an HCV NS5A inhibitor approved in EU for use in combination with SOF for 
the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection in patients aged 6 years and older. Voxilaprevir is a 
novel pangenotypic HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor (PI) with pangenotypic antiviral activity.

Type of Application and aspects on development 
There was no scientific advice given from Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
regarding the development of the new low dose tablet 200/50/50 mg and therapeutic indication for 
Vosevi in adolescents from 12 years of age and older.  
Overall, the design of the paediatric study GS-US-367-1175 was in line with the outline in the CHMP 
guidance. Efficacy and safety is extrapolated from adults to adolescents based on the principle of 
comparable systemic exposure (PK bridge) in line with the 2016 EMA draft “Guidelines on the clinical 
evaluation of direct acting antivirals for the treatment of chronic hepatitis”. 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0006/2020 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  The PIP included a waiver for 
children less than 12 years old on the grounds that the specific medicinal product does not represent a 
significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments in younger children. At the time of submission 
of the application, the PIP P/0006/2020 was completed. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets containing 200 mg sofosbuvir, 50 mg

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The medicinal product is an immediate release film-coated tablet which contains a fixed dose 
combination of three active substances. The 200 mg sofosbuvir/ 50 mg velpatasvir/ 50 mg voxilaprevir 
tablet is presented as a beige, oval-shaped tablet debossed with “GSI” on one side and “SVV” on the 
other side. 
Other ingredients are: 
• 
• 
Tablet core: colloidal anhydrous silica, copovidone, croscarmellose sodium (E468), lactose 
monohydrate, magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose (E460).  
Film-coating: iron oxide black (E172), iron oxide red (E172), iron oxide yellow (E172), macrogol 
(E1521), polyvinyl alcohol (E1203), talc (E553b), titanium dioxide (E171). 
The purpose of formulation development was to develop a reduced-strength tablet suitable for use in 
the paediatric population unable to swallow the approved 400 mg/ 100 mg/ 100 mg strength tablet. 
The qualitative composition of the lower strengths 200 mg/ 50 mg/ 50 mg tablets is identical to the 
approved 400 mg/ 100 mg/ 100 mg tablets. The two tablet strengths are differentiated by tablet size, 
shape, and debossing. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards, except for the film coating material, Opadry II beige, which is tested according to an in-
house standard and the colourant, iron oxide, contained in Opadry II beige, which complies with EU 
regulations. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. No new information 
related to excipients was presented with this line extension. The list of excipients is included in section 
6.1 of the SmPC.  
The formulation used during clinical studies is the same as that intended for marketing.  
The 200 mg/ 50 mg/ 50 mg and 400 mg/ 100 mg/ 100 mg strength tablets are manufactured from a 
common blend and the manufacturing process used is the same as for the approved higher-strength 
tablets. 
For the new 200mg/ 50mg/ 50mg lower-strength tablet, no in vivo data were presented, and the 
applicant sought a biowaiver of strength based on in vitro dissolution data. The justification for the 
request for biowaiver of strength as presented in the application was initially judged to be not sufficient 
and a Major Objection was raised during the procedure. Additional dissolution data were requested at 
three different pH without the use of surfactant. In response, the applicant presented dissolution 
profiles generated for sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir (SOF/VEL/VOX) tablets, 400/100/100 mg and 
200/50/50 mg (three batches of each strength). The dissolution profiles were obtained at the same 
dose of 400 mg of SOF, 100 mg of VEL, and 100 mg of VOX by comparing one SOF/VEL/VOX 
400/100/100 mg tablet per vessel with two SOF/VEL/VOX 200/50/50 mg tablets per vessel. 
Dissolution profiles were also presented using the conditions of the approved dissolution method.   
In summary, the CHMP concluded that the waiver for the additional strength is considered acceptable 
because of the similarity in dissolution at various pHs and of the QC method. Based on the available 
data and additional expert consultation, the CHMP concluded that the data presented was sufficient to 
resolve the Major Objection and to justify the biowaiver of strength for the new lower strength tablet.

The primary packaging is similar for the 200 mg/ 50 mg/ 50 mg tablets and for the approved 400 mg/ 
100 mg/ 100 mg tablets and differs only in the bottle size (60 ml rather than 100 ml bottle size). The 
primary packaging is a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle with a polypropylene child-resistant 
closure with polyester coil and a silica gel desiccant. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC 
requirements 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process for the new Vosevi film-coated tablets 200 mg/ 50 mg/ 50 mg is similar to 
the one used for the approved 400 mg/ 100 mg/ 100 mg tablets, except for the differences introduced 
by tablet size and shape, and scale of the processing equipment. The manufacturing process of the 
finished product consists of three stages: manufacture of the finished product intermediates 
velpatasvir spray-dried dispersion (VEL SDD) and voxilaprevir spray-dried dispersion (VOX SDD), and 
manufacture of the film-coated tablets. 
VEL SDD and VOX SDD are finished product intermediates with separate specifications and shelf life. 
The manufacturing and control of these intermediates was approved with the initial application and 
subsequent variations and no changes were introduced as part of this line extension. 
The manufacturing process of the film-coated tablets consists of the following main steps: powder 
processing (dispensing, blending, and dry granulation) of sofosbuvir, VEL SDD, VOX SDD, and 
excipients to yield the final powder blend for compression; tablet compression to yield tablet cores; 
film coating of tablet cores to yield film coated tablets, and primary packaging of film-coated tablets.  
The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
The overall control strategy, process parameters and in-process controls are adequate in view of the 
available development data and in view of the standard nature of the manufacturing process. 
The robustness of the process has been demonstrated during development by the manufacture of 
representative batches. Process validation will be performed prior to commercial distribution of the 
product. An acceptable process validation scheme has been presented. 
Product specification  
The finished product specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form including 
appearance (visual), identification (HPLC, UV), water content (Ph. Eur.), strength (assay, UPLC), 
degradation products (UPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (Ph. Eur., UPLC) and 
microbiological examination (Ph. Eur.). 
The specification for the new 200 mg/ 50 mg/ 50 mg tablets utilises the same tests and acceptance 
limits as approved for the 400 mg/ 100 mg/ 100 mg tablets. 
The analytical procedures developed for the 400 mg/ 100 mg/ 100 mg strength tablets are used for 
testing of the 200 mg/ 50 mg/ 50 mg strength tablets. Except for the method for dissolution, sample 
preparation was proportionally scaled for the 200mg/ 50mg/ 50mg strength tablets. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk 
assessment and the presented batch data it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an 
extension of indication variation  
EMA/480638/2021  
Page 13/58 
 
 
 
elemental impurity controls in the finished product specification. The information on the control of 
elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been 
performed considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for 
marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) 
No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and 
the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine 
impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the information provided it is 
accepted that no risk was identified on the possible presence of nitrosamine impurities in the active 
substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no additional control measures are deemed 
necessary. 
Batch analysis results are provided for four production-scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
No new information on reference standards has been presented with this line extension application. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three production scale batches of finished product stored for up to 12 months under 
long term conditions (30 ºC / 75% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 
75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are 
representative of those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed 
for marketing. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. No significant changes have been 
observed. 
Manufacture of the new 200 mg/ 50 mg/ 50 mg tablets is from a powder blend common with the 
approved 400 mg/ 100 mg/ 100 mg tablets, for which a shelf life of 48 months is approved. The 400 
mg/ 100 mg/ 100 mg tablets showed little or no change in all quality attributes after storage for up to 
48 months at 30 ºC / 75% RH. It was observed that the stability data at accelerated storage conditions 
are comparable for the 200 mg/ 50 mg/ 50 mg tablets and the 400 mg/ 100 mg/ 100 mg tablets. 
The date of tablet manufacture is defined as the date when VEL SDD, VOX SDD and sofosbuvir are 
combined with the excipients in tablet manufacture. Separate shelf-lives and definitions for the date of 
manufacture have been approved for VEL SDD and VOX SDD as part of the approval of the 400 mg/ 
100 mg/ 100 mg strength tablet marketing authorisation.  
Considering the supporting data from the approved 400 mg/ 100 mg/ 100 mg tablets, extrapolating 
the results from 12 months of stability data at long-term storage conditions and 6 months stability 
data at the accelerated storage conditions to support the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions of 
Vosevi 200 mg/ 50 mg/ 50 mg film-coated tablets, can be accepted.  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 48 months and with no special storage 
conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. The tablets should be stored in the 
original package (bottle) in order to protect from moisture and this is indicated in section 6.4 of the 
SmPC.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner.  
During the procedure, a Major Objection was raised in relation to the justification for the request for 
biowaiver of strength and comparative dissolution profiles generated without the use of surfactant 
were requested. The additional data provided by the applicant was considered sufficient to resolve the 
Major Objection and justify the biowaiver of strength.  
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical studies have been submitted for this procedure. 
2.3.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The EMA guideline on the ERA states that “the evaluation of the environmental impact should be made 
if there is an increase in the environmental exposure, e.g. a new indication may result in a significant 
increase in the extent of the use”. The prior ERAs for both SOF and VEL predicted environmental 
concentrations were estimated based on forecasted sales figures provided by the applicant. These 
forecasts covered the period of 2015 – 2024 for SOF and 2018 – 2024 for VEL and included a reserve/ 
margin of error that is higher than the small increase in sales that may occur due to the proposed line 
extension. For VOX, 100% prevalence based on the highest HCV prevalence observed in the European 
Union (EU) was applied to determine the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) (Italy – 5.2%). 
Therefore, it can be considered that the sales forecasts and use of prevalence data employed in the 
previous ERA accounted for the potential sales increase due to the proposed line extension. Hence the 
estimated PECs are still conservative and no update to the assessment is necessary. As detailed in the 
ERAs for SOF, VEL and VOX, Risk Quotient (RQ) values for SOF (as GS-331007), VEL, and VOX are less 
than 1 (highest RQ for SOF = 1.26x10-4, VEL= 1.08x10-3, and VOX = 6.26x10-3) for compartments 
such as sewage treatment plant, surface water, groundwater, and sediment. An increase in Vosevi 
sales of greater than 160 times would be required to produce an unacceptable risk. This line extension

grouped with an extension of indication is not expected to significantly increase sales continuing the 
low RQs.   
2.3.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical studies, including juvenile toxicity, have been submitted in support of the current 
application for use of Vosevi in adolescents 12 - <18 years. This was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP as the non-clinical data safety data submitted in support of the original Vosevi marketing 
authorization application did not reveal any hazards specific for adolescents and agrees with the Vosevi 
paediatric investigation plan (PIP) as stated in the Paediatric Committee (PDCO) decision document, 
EMEA-001822-PIP01-15. In addition, adverse reactions by Vosevi in patients 12 years and older was 
studied for 8 weeks in a Phase-2 open-label clinical trial. The observed adverse reactions in this study 
comprising adolescents were consistent with those observed in clinical studies with Vosevi in adults. 
No update of the ERA was submitted in support of the current extension of indication application. This 
is accepted as the existing ERAs for SOF, VEL, and VOX are considered applicable to this application. 
2.3.3.  Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
There are no issues with the dossier from a non-clinical perspective.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Relative bioavailability study 
No relative bioavailability study was performed in order to investigate interchangeability of two tablets 
of the 200/50/50 mg strength and one tablet of the 400/100/100 mg strength. Based on the available 
data and the input from the QWP and PKWP, the CHMP concluded that a biowaiver for the lower-
strength was justified, as detailed in section 2.2.3 of the CHMP AR. 
PopPK analysis 
The objective of the popPk analysis was to: 
•  update a joint model evaluating the PK of SOF, its primary circulating metabolite (GS-331007), 
and metabolite GS-566500 in HCV-infected pediatric subjects  
• 
• 
• 
To update a VEL population PK model with additional pediatric data in HCV-infected pediatric 
subjects administered 
To develop a population PK model for evaluating the PK of VOX in HCV-infected pediatric 
subjects 
To estimate individual exposures of SOF, GS-331007, GS-566500, VEL, and VOX in the 
pediatric population 
SOF Joint PopPK Model 
A total of 85 Subjects in Study GS-US-334-1112, 198 subjects in Study GS-US-337-1116, 179 
subjects in Study GS-US-342-1143, and 15 subjects in Study GS-US-367-1175 had at least 1 
concentration value for GS-331007 included in the PopPK analysis. Plasma concentrations of SOF, GS-
566500, and GS-331007 were best described by a joint 1-compartment (SOF and GS-566500) and a 
2-compartment (GS-331007) model, including first-order absorption with zero-order input for SOF and 
an absorption lag time (ALAG) for both SOF and GS-331007, followed by first-order elimination. The 
model included the effect of WT (allometric exponents fixed to 0.75 and 1 for clearances and volumes, 
respectively) on apparent oral clearance of SOF (CLSOF), apparent volume of SOF (VSOF),  apparent

oral clearance of GS-566500 (CL500),  apparent volume of GS-566500 (V500), apparent oral clearance 
of GS-331007 (CL007), and apparent volume of GS-331007 (Vc007). Additionally, the model included 
the separate effect of coadministration of LDV and VEL on relative fraction absorbed for SOF (F1) and 
co-administration of RBV(ribavirin) on apparent oral clearance ofGS-566500 (CL500) and apparent oral 
clearance of GS-331007 (CL007).The model also included the effect of age on CL500 and CL007 and 
sex on CL007.

The PopPK data included 209 subjects from Study GS-US-342-1143 and 21 subjects from Study GS-
US-367-1175. After all exclusions, a total of 179 subjects in Study GS-US-342-1143 and 15 subjects 
from Study GS-US-367-1175 had at least 1 measurable concentration value for VEL. The final pediatric 
VEL model was described by a 2-compartment model with sequential zero-/first-order absorption and 
first-order elimination, with interindividual variability (IIV) on CL/F, Vc/F, and ka. The effect of WT on 
CL/F and Vc/F was included using fixed allometric exponents of 0.75 and 1, respectively. VOX was 
found to affect VEL CL/F (24.4% reduction). No additional covariates were found to significantly affect 
VEL exposure.

Population PK models derived exposures of SOF, GS-331007, VEL, and VOX using intensive and sparse 
PK samples from paediatric subjects 12 to < 18 years old in Study GS-US-367-1175 were compared 
with historical data collected in the adult Phase 2/3 SOF/VEL/VOX clinical studies as presented in Table  
below.

A qualitative comparison of observed VOX concentration against time after last dose (TALD) in non-
cirrhotic adults with adolescents y is shown in Figure 4 below. The observed concentrations of the 
adolescents are fully contained within the adult range and display a similar trend. This is further 
corroborated by the corresponding descriptive statistics summarized by TALD windows in Table  below, 
indicating similar distribution of concentrations between the 2 populations within each TALD window.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Since there is not enough efficacy and safety data in adolescent, the CHMP agreed that efficacy and 
safety will be extrapolated from adults to adolescents based on the principle of comparable systemic 
exposure (PK bridge). 
The simulated exposure for SOF, the main metabolite of SOF (GS-331007) and VEL show higher 
exposure in adolescents compared to adults. The proposed posology is the same as what has 
previously been deemed adequate in paediatric patients for combination including SOF and VEL 
(Epclusa). The higher exposure in adolescents compared to adults is not considered a concern with 
regards to safety. Thus, the proposed posology in adolescents regarding SOF and VEL is accepted.  
For VOX popPK model, the stratified VPCs show that Cmax is not well captured, underpredicting Cmax 
for lower body weight patients and overpredicting Cmax for higher body weight patients. Cmin median 
appears to be fairly well described however the variability is overpredicted, this may be the reason for 
the 33% lower Cmin in adolescents based on the popPk analysis. 
Overall, the VOX popPK model is not optimal and could be further developed/improved. No conclusions 
here are based on the popPk analysis for VOX. If the VOX model is to be used in the future, 
improvement of the model is warranted. The CHMP was of the view that this issue does not need to be 
pursued further in the context of this procedure. 
The observed PK data for VOX is deemed rich enough to draw conclusions in adolescents and the 
exposure is overlapping with adult exposure. The MAH´s conclusion that the VOX exposures in 
adolescents are similar to those in non-cirrhotic adults for which safety and efficacy have been 
established was endorsed by the CHMP. 
No relative bioavailability study was performed in order to investigate interchangeability of two tablets 
of the 200/50/50 mg strength and one tablet of the 400/100/100-mg strength. Based on the available 
data and the input from the QWP and PKWP, the CHMP concluded that a biowaiver for the lower-
strength was justified, as detailed in section 2.2.3 of the CHMP AR. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the PK analyses were considered supportive of the dosing recommendations in the target 
patient population. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies and main clinical studies

Approximately 60 subjects were planned to be enrolled into 3 sequential age-based cohorts as follows: 
•  Cohort 1: at least 20 subjects 12 to < 18 years old 
•  Cohort 2: at least 20 subjects 6 to < 12 years old 
•  Cohort 3: at least 20 subjects 3 to < 6 years old 
A modification to the original PIP has been agreed with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) 
Paediatric Committee (PDCO) decision received on 06 January 2020 (EMEA-001822-PIP01-15-M01), 
waiving the inclusion of subjects 3 to < 12 years old. Thus, there will be no enrolment into Cohort 2 
and Cohort 3. 
Description of Study Procedures 
All subjects were to complete the following visits: screening, Day 1, Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8 or 12 
(depending on treatment assignment) during the treatment phase, followed by posttreatment visits at 
4, 12, and 24 weeks after discontinuation of study drug. 
At least 10 subjects in each age cohort were to be enrolled in an intensive PK substudy conducted at 
Week 2 or Week 4 after providing separate consent. Sparse PK samples were also collected at Weeks 
1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 depending on treatment duration and intensive PK substudy participation. 
Pharmacokinetic and safety data from at least 20 evaluable subjects in each cohort were to be 
reviewed to confirm the appropriateness of the SOF/VEL/VOX dose used. 
Subjects who provided separate and specific consent were eligible for participation in the 
pharmacogenomics substudy. A blood sample was drawn for this substudy at the Day 1 visit or at any 
time during the study. 
After completing all required study visits, all subjects (those who attained SVR24 and those who did 
not attain SVR24 and did not initiate other experimental or approved anti-HCV therapy) were eligible 
to enrol into a registry study (GS-US-334-1113) to be followed every 6 months for the first 2 years, 
then every 12 months for a total of up to 5 years, for assessments of growth, quality of life, and long-
term viral suppression (if applicable). 
This study was conducted at a total of 10 study centres in Italy, Poland, and United Kingdom. 
Treatments 
The marketed dose of SOF/VEL/VOX for the treatment of HCV infection in adults is 400/100/100 mg. 
The adult clinical dose was evaluated in adolescent subjects (12 to <18 years old) in this study. 
Subjects completed a swallowability assessment at screening up to Day 1 using a placebo-to-match 
(PTM) SOF/VEL/VOX FDC (400/100/100 mg) tablet to determine which formulation each subject could 
take. Subjects unable to swallow the PTM were to be assigned to wait until a smaller, lower-dose tablet 
or non-tablet formulation was available. 
Following screening and confirmation of eligibility by the investigator, all subjects received the 
SOF/VEL/VOX FDC (400/100/100 mg) tablet orally once daily with food. Subjects without cirrhosis who 
were DAA-naive were to receive SOF/VEL/VOX for 8 weeks. Subjects with cirrhosis who were DAA-
naive and all DAA-experienced subjects (with or without cirrhosis) were to receive SOF/VEL/VOX for 12 
weeks. 
All patients were DAA-naïve and without cirrhosis and thus received 8 weeks of treatment.

All subjects were able to swallow the SOF/VEL/VOX FDC (400/100/100 mg) tablet; therefore, 
information regarding the low-dose tablet is not presented by the Applicant. 
Objectives 
According to the 2016 EMA draft “Guidelines on the clinical evaluation of direct acting antivirals for the 
treatment of chronic hepatitis”, similar to the case with HIV, it is considered that efficacy data may be 
bridged from adults to children, provided that similar drug exposure is reached in plasma at the 
recommended doses. Paediatric studies could primarily focus on the determination of PK, but would 
also collect, albeit in a rather limited fashion, data on safety and efficacy.  
The recommended primary efficacy endpoint for studies aiming at defining cure rate is SVR, defined as 
HCV-RNA < LLOQ 12 weeks after the planned completion of therapy (SVR12). Both efficacy and safety 
endpoints are well-established in the field of hepatitis C clinical trials and the objectives are in line with 
the overall approach to bridge both efficacy and safety from the adult to the paediatric population. 
The primary objective of this study was as follows: 
• 
To evaluate the steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK) and confirm the age-appropriate dose of 
sofosbuvir (SOF)/velpatasvir (VEL)/voxilaprevir (VOX) fixed-dose combination (FDC) in 
paediatric subjects with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection 
The secondary objectives of this study were as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SOF/VEL/VOX FDC in paediatric subjects with chronic 
HCV infection 
To evaluate the antiviral efficacy of SOF/VEL/VOX FDC treatment in paediatric subjects with 
chronic HCV infection, as assessed by the proportion of paediatric subjects with sustained 
virologic response (SVR) 12 weeks after cessation of treatment (SVR12) 
To evaluate the antiviral efficacy of SOF/VEL/VOX FDC treatment in paediatric subjects with 
chronic HCV infection, as assessed by the proportion of paediatric subjects with SVR 4 and 24 
weeks after cessation of treatment (SVR4 and SVR24) 
To evaluate the proportion of paediatric subjects with virologic failure, including on-treatment 
virologic failure and relapse 
To evaluate the kinetics of circulating HCV RNA during treatment and after cessation of 
treatment 
To evaluate the emergence of viral resistance to SOF, VEL, and VOX during treatment and after 
cessation of treatment 
To evaluate the effect of SOF/VEL/VOX FDC on growth and development of paediatric subjects 
during and after treatment 
To evaluate acceptability, including palatability, and swallowability of formulations (as 
applicable) used in the study 
To assess the effect of treatment with SOF/VEL/VOX FDC on quality of life as measured by the 
Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory™ v4.0 Short Form 15 (PedsQL™ 4.0 SF15)

The exploratory objective of this study was as follows: 
• 
To identify or validate genetic markers that may be predictive of the natural history of disease, 
response to therapy, and/or tolerability of medical therapies through genetic discovery 
research (eg, pharmacogenomics) in subjects who provided their separate and specific consent 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Safety Assessment 
Safety assessments included monitoring of adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medications, clinical 
laboratory analyses, Tanner pubertal stage assessments, height and weight measurements, vital signs 
measurements, and physical examinations. Additional safety data related to growth were assessed 
based on radiographic bone age (end of treatment) and bone age biomarkers (posttreatment Week 
24). Neuropsychiatric assessment was done using the PedsQL 4.0 SF15. 
All enrolled subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug were included in the Safety Analysis 
Set. Safety data included all data collected on or after the first dose of any study drug up to the date of 
the last dose of study drug plus 30 days. Adverse events were coded using the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), Version 22.1. 
Efficacy Assessment 
The key efficacy endpoint was SVR12, defined as HCV RNA < LLOQ (ie, < 15 IU/mL) 12 weeks after 
discontinuation of the study drug, in the Full Analysis Set. The point estimates of the SVR12 rate and 
2-sided 95% exact CIs based on the Clopper-Pearson method were provided by HCV genotype 1 
(further broken down to 1a and 1b), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or other, as appropriate, and total. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included the proportion of subjects with SVR4 and SVR24, proportion of 
subjects with HCV RNA < LLOQ by study visit, HCV RNA absolute values and changes from baseline 
through end of treatment, proportion of subjects with virologic failure, proportion of subjects with 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normalization, and characterization of baseline, on-treatment, and 
posttreatment HCV drug resistance substitutions. 
All continuous endpoints were summarized using descriptive statistics (sample size, mean, SD, 
median, first quartile [Q1], third quartile [Q3], minimum, and maximum). All categorical endpoints 
were summarized by the number and percentage of subjects who met the endpoint definition. 
Sample size 
As the efficacy will be bridged through PK, the studies are not powered to allow a precise estimation of 
neither efficacy nor safety. According to the 2016 EMA draft “Guidelines on the clinical evaluation of 
direct acting antivirals for the treatment of chronic hepatitis” it is recognised that the number of 
children and adolescents with chronic hepatitis C eligible for clinical trials is limited. If there are no 
specific safety concerns relevant to the paediatric population, pre-authorisation studies could be limited 
in size. 
Number of Subjects (Planned and Analysed): 
Planned: Approximately 20 subjects 12 to < 18 years old 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an 
extension of indication variation  
EMA/480638/2021  
Page 30/58 
 
 
 
 
 
Analysed: 
• 
Full Analysis Set: 21 subjects 
•  Safety Analysis Set: 21 subjects 
• 
PK Analysis Set: 21 subjects 
• 
Intensive PK Analysis Set: 14 subjects 
At least 10 subjects in each age cohort were to be enrolled in an intensive PK substudy conducted at 
Week 2 or Week 4 after providing separate consent. Sparse PK samples were also collected from all 
subjects at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and at end of treatment or early termination, depending on treatment 
duration and intensive PK substudy participation. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Study GS-US-367-1175 was an open-label, single-arm study, hence no randomisation. 
Statistical methods 
The statistical methods applied are standard for this type of study and they are considered acceptable. 
The statistical methods were detailed in the SAP, the SAP was however finalised close to the database 
lock date. Given the open label nature of the study an earlier finalization of the SAP would have been 
preferred but since the efficacy endpoints are objective in nature this is of less concern.  
Sample Size and Power 
Assuming similar variability for SOF, GS-331007, VEL, and VOX AUCtau in the paediatric population 
compared with adults, a sample size of 20 paediatric subjects per cohort provided at least 80% power 
to target a 90% CI of the geometric mean ratio (GMR) within the bounds of 50% to 200%. 
Analysis Sets 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) included all enrolled subjects who took at least 1 dose of study drug 
(SOF/VEL/VOX FDC). This was the primary analysis set for efficacy analyses. 
The Safety Analysis Set included all subjects who were enrolled into the study and took at least 1 dose 
of study drug (SOF/VEL/VOX FDC). This was the primary analysis set for safety analyses. 
Missing data handling 
For the analyses of categorical HCV RNA data, missing posttreatment HCV RNA data will have the 
missing data imputed. Missing on-treatment HCV RNA will have the missing data imputed up to the 
time of the last dose. If a data point is missing and is preceded and followed in time by values that are 
“< LLOQ target not detected (TND),” then the missing data point will be set to “< LLOQ TND.” If a data 
point is missing and preceded and followed by values that are “< LLOQ detected,” or preceded by “< 
LLOQ detected” and followed by “< LLOQ TND,” or preceded by “< LLOQ TND” and followed by “< 
LLOQ detected,” then the missing value will be set to “< LLOQ detected.” In these situations, the data 
point will be termed a bracketed success; otherwise, the data point will be termed a bracketed failure 
(i.e., ≥ LLOQ detected). If a data point is missing and is not bracketed, the missing data point will also 
be termed a failure (i.e., ≥ LLOQ detected) except for SVR24, which will be imputed according to the 
SVR12 status. Success for SVR12 who have no further HCV RNA measurements collected will be 
counted as a success for SVR24 due to the high correlation between these 2 endpoints.

The proportion of subjects with sustained virological response (SVR) 12 weeks after cessation of 
treatment (SVR12) was summarized. The point estimates of SVR12 rate and 2- sided 95% exact CI 
based on Clopper-Pearson method was provided by HCV genotype (1 [further broken down to 1a and 
1b], 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or other, as appropriate, and total). 
No adjustments for multiple comparisons were performed. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Table 6: Disposition of Subjects (Screened Subjects) 
Protocol Deviation 
A total of 2 important protocol deviations occurred in 2 subjects during the study. One subject was 
enrolled without completing alcohol or drug abuse screening during the screening visit, so confirmation 
of this exclusion criterion was not performed prior to enrolment. The other deviation was due to a site 
failing to electronically transmit an SAE eCRF to the relevant safety group within 24 hours of being 
informed of the event, as required. Neither of these important protocol deviations affected the overall 
quality or interpretation of the study data.

Proportion of Subjects with HCV RNA < LLOQ While on Treatment by Visit  
The table below presents the proportion of subjects with HCV RNA < LLOQ while on treatment by 
analysis visit. The total number of subjects with HCV < LLOQ was the sum of the number of subjects 
with HCV RNA “< LLOQ detected” plus the number of subjects with HCV RNA “< LLOQ target not 
detected (TND).” Potent and rapid suppression of HCV RNA while on treatment was observed. At Week 
4, 90.5% of subjects (19 of 21) had HCV RNA < LLOQ, and 100.0% of subjects (21 of 21) had HCV 
RNA < LLOQ at Week 8.

Prevalence of Pre-treatment NS3 and NS5A RAVs and Impact on Treatment Outcome 
Pre-treatment full-length NS3 and NS5A deep sequencing data were obtained for all 21 subjects and 
NS3 and NS5A resistance-associated variants (RAVs) were reported at a 15% assay cut-off. Overall, 1 
of 21 subjects (4.8%) had pre-treatment NS3 RAVs without NS5A RAVs. A total of 10 of 21 subjects 
(47.6%) had pre-treatment NS5A RAVs alone. None of the subjects had both NS3 and NS5A RAVs at 
baseline. All 11 subjects (52.4%) with baseline NS3 or NS5A RAVs achieved SVR12 and SVR24. 
Overall, 21 of 21 subjects (100%) achieved SVR12 and SVR24. 
Prevalence of Pre-treatment NS5B NI RAVs and Impact on Treatment Outcome  
For the purposes of this report, NS5B NI RAVs were defined as follows: S96T, N142T, L159F, E237G, 
S282ANY, C289I/L, L320F/I/V, and V321A/I, and were reported at a 15% assay cut off. Pre-treatment 
full-length NS5B sequencing data were obtained for 21 of 21 subjects. Three of 21 subjects (14.3%) 
had pre-treatment NS5B NI RAVs detected at baseline at a 15% assay cut off. All 3 subjects with 
baseline NS5B NI RAVs achieved SVR12 and SVR24. 
Overall, fourteen of 21 patients had baseline RAVs which did not impact treatment outcome and all the 
21 patients reached SVR12 and SVR24. 
Acceptability 
A total of 21 subjects completed the acceptability questionnaire at Day 1, and 20 subjects and 21 
parents or guardians completed the questionnaire at end of treatment (Week 8). Overall, the majority 
of responses were favourable or neutral with respect to acceptability of the SOF/VEL/VOX FDC 
(400/100/100 mg) tablet. 
Quality of Life Survey 
Based on subject and parent/guardian responses to the PedsQL 4.0 SF15 quality of life survey at 
baseline, end of treatment (Week 8), and posttreatment Weeks 12 and 24, there were no notable 
changes in overall quality of life or neuropsychiatric status during the study. Based on the subject 
reports, there was a statistically significant (p = 0.032) increase (improvement) at end of treatment 
compared with baseline in the psychosocial health summary score, followed by non-statistically 
significant decreases (worsening) during the posttreatment period. The mean psychosocial health 
summary scores per the subject reports at posttreatment Weeks 12 and 24 were slightly higher than 
baseline. No other statistically significant changes were observed. 
Ancillary analyses 
With the 100.0% SVR12 rate observed and no cases of virologic failure, no meaningful interpretation 
of subgroup analyses can be made.

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The GS-US-367-1175 study was not powered for a precise estimate of efficacy and no control arm is 
available for comparison which is fully acceptable since the main objective of the study is to provide PK 
data. Furthermore, it was conducted in a population where the contribution of voxilaprevir to the 
favourable outcomes cannot be ascertained. However, in line with EMA guidance, efficacy can be 
extrapolated through a PK-bridge as exposure is similar in adolescents and adults.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The key efficacy endpoint was SVR12 (HCV RNA < LLOQ 12 weeks after discontinuation of study drug). 
Overall, 21 of 21 patients 12 <18 years of age achieved SVR12. No subject had virologic failure, there 
was no on-treatment breakthrough or relapse observed in subjects through posttreatment Week 12 or 
posttreatment Week 24.  
At Week 4, 90.5% of subjects (19 of 21) had HCV RNA < LLOQ, and 100.0% of subjects (21 of 21) 
had HCV RNA < LLOQ at Week 8. 
Normalization of ALT was observed in all subjects at Week 4 through the posttreatment Week 4 visit 
(final observation), coincident with suppression of viral replication. 
Pre-treatment NS3 and NS5A RAVs were observed in 4.8% and 47.6% of subjects with a virologic 
outcome that were included in the Resistance Analysis Population, respectively. Pre-treatment NS5B NI 
RAVs were observed in 14.3% of the subjects. The presence of pre-treatment NS3, NS5A, and/or NS5B 
RAVs did not impact treatment outcome as all subjects with pre-treatment RAVs achieved SVR12 and 
SVR24.  
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The CHMP concluded that Vosevi is effective in the treatment of chronic HCV in adolescent patients 12 
< 18 years of age and weighing at least 30 kg.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The mean (SD) duration of exposure was 8.0 (0.08) weeks. All subjects completed their assigned 8-
week treatment duration. No subjects were assigned to the 12-week treatment duration.

Table 6: Duration of Exposure to Study Regimen (Safety Analysis Set) 
Adverse events 
The majority of subjects (71.4%, 15 of 21) experienced at least 1 AE, and 42.9% of subjects (9 of 21) 
had a treatment-related AE, as presented in Table  below. All AEs were Grade 1 (mild) or Grade 2 
(moderate) in severity. One of 21 subjects (4.8%) experienced an SAE, which was assessed as related 
to study drug. No subject had an AE that led to premature discontinuation or interruption of study 
drug. No deaths occurred during the study.

Overall, the frequency of AEs in Study GS-US-367-1175 are in line with observed AEs in the adult 
Phase 3 clinical trials. Abdominal pain is more frequently reported in the adolescent population 
(23.8%) compared to the adult population (3.4% abdominal pain in the Phase 3 program). However, 
all AEs were Grade 1 (mild) or Grade 2 (moderate) in severity. 
Adverse Events by Severity 
All AEs reported in this study were Grade 1 (mild) or Grade 2 (moderate) in severity. No Grade 3 
(severe) or Grade 4 (life threatening) AEs were reported. 
Adverse Events by Relationship to Study Drug 
The Table  below presents a summary of treatment-related AEs reported for ≥ 5% of subjects by PT. 
The most common treatment-related AEs reported were headache (14.3%, 3 subjects), nausea 
(14.3%, 3 subjects), and abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and fatigue (9.5%, 2 subjects each).

Analysis of Adverse Events by Organ System or Syndrome 
Adverse events of interest were defined as treatment-emergent AEs that have historically been 
associated with administration of some nucleoside/nucleotide inhibitors or other DAAs including cardiac 
events, dermatologic events, pancytopenia, psychiatric events relevant to suicide ideation or attempt, 
pancreatitis events, rhabdomyolysis/myopathy events, renal failure events and hepatic events. 
Cardiac Safety 
Cardiac safety assessments included analysis of cardiac failure events, cardiac arrhythmia/bradycardia 
events, events during the first 2 weeks of study treatment in subjects taking or not taking beta 
blockers and calcium channel blockers, and any safety events in subjects with amiodarone use during 
treatment. 
Cardiac Failure Events: Given historical potential toxicities associated with some antiviral 
nucleoside/nucleotide inhibitors, an analysis of cardiac failure/cardiomyopathy events was performed. 
No cardiac failure/cardiomyopathy AEs were reported. 
Cardiac Arrhythmias/Bradycardia: A subject experienced a Grade 1 AE of bradycardia on Day 8, which 
resolved on posttreatment Day 168. The event was assessed as related to study drug and study drug 
was not interrupted. The subject was hospitalized for 1 day on Day 10 for an SAE of Grade 2 
hypotension. 
Adverse Events During the First 2 Weeks of Treatment for Subjects Using a Beta Blocker, a Calcium 
Channel Blocker, or Neither: No subject had on-treatment beta blocker or calcium channel blocker use. 
One subject without on-treatment beta blocker or calcium channel blocker use had a Grade 1 AE of 
dizziness during the first 2 weeks of treatment, and 1 subject had a Grade 1 AE of bradycardia. 
Amiodarone Use: No subject received amiodarone during treatment with SOF/VEL/VOX.  
Other Adverse Events of Interest 
There were no reports of other adverse events of interest defined as follows: dermatologic events 
(defined as events within the skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders SOC that were serious, Grade 3 
or above, or resulted in discontinuation of SOF/VEL/VOX), pancytopenia (including aplastic anemia) 
events, psychiatric events relevant to suicide ideation or attempt, pancreatitis events, 
rhabdomyolysis/myopathy events, renal failure events, and hepatic events (serious hepatic failure 
events, hepatic AEs leading to discontinuation of SOF/VEL/VOX, or subjects requiring liver 
transplantation). 
Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety 
The effects of study treatment on development and growth were assessed by changes from baseline in 
Tanner pubertal stage, bone age assessments, height, weight, and BMI. No notable effects of Vosevi 
on development, growth or vital signs as assessed by changes from baseline through posttreatment 
Week 24, were observed. 
Tanner Pubertal Staging 
Male 
At baseline, the majority of male subjects were at Tanner stage 4 or 5 for pubic hair and genitalia 
development (75.0%, 6 of 8 subjects). At end of treatment and at posttreatment Weeks 12 and 24, no 
male subjects (8 subjects) had a decrease from baseline in their Tanner stage for pubic hair and 
genitalia development. 
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an 
extension of indication variation  
EMA/480638/2021  
Page 45/58 
 
 
 
Female 
At baseline, the majority of female subjects were at Tanner stage 4 or 5 for pubic hair and breast 
development (69.2%, 9 of 13 subjects). At end of treatment and at posttreatment Weeks 12 and 24, 
no female subjects (13 subjects) had a decrease from baseline in their Tanner stage for pubic hair and 
breast development. 
Height, Weight, and Body Mass Index 
Height 
The median (Q1, Q3) body height at baseline was 162.0 (158.0, 166.0) cm. At posttreatment Week 
24, the median (Q1, Q3) change from baseline in body height was 1.8 (0.8, 3.0) cm. The median (Q1, 
Q3) body height percentile at baseline was 47.9 (32.4, 63.2). At posttreatment Week 24, the median 
(Q1, Q3) change in body height percentile was −0.2 (−3.1, 4.3). This minor negative change in body 
height percentile was not considered clinically relevant and could reflect variability in how height was 
assessed. 
Weight 
The median (Q1, Q3) body weight at baseline was 54.2 (46.1, 57.8) kg. At posttreatment Week 24, 
the median (Q1, Q3) change from baseline in body weight was 2.7 (1.0, 3.5) kg. The median (Q1, Q3) 
body weight percentile at baseline was 54.0 (30.9, 75.9). At posttreatment Week 24, the median (Q1, 
Q3) change in body weight percentile was −1.6 (−5.2, 4.3). 
Body Mass Index 
The median (Q1, Q3) BMI at baseline was 19.8 (18.5, 22.0) kg/m2. At posttreatment Week 24, the 
median (Q1, Q3) change from baseline in BMI was 0.2 (−0.2, 0.8) kg/m2. The median (Q1, Q3) BMI 
percentile at baseline was 57.4 (30.2, 73.6). At posttreatment Week 12, the median (Q1, Q3) change 
in BMI percentile was −2.8 (−7.1, 2.5).

The median (Q1, Q3) radiographic bone age at baseline was 14.5 (13.7, 16.0) years. At end of 
treatment (Week 8), the median (Q1, Q3) change from baseline was 0.0 (0.0, 0.5) years. 
Bone Age Biomarkers 
The median (Q1, Q3) CTX at baseline was 1.35 (1.05, 2.35) ng/mL. At posttreatment Week 24, the 
median (Q1, Q3) change from baseline was −0.22 (−0.55, −0.04) ng/mL, and was not considered 
clinically relevant. 
The median (Q1, Q3) P1NP at baseline was 383.25 (175.00, 944.20) ng/mL. At posttreatment Week 
24, the median (Q1, Q3) change from baseline was –101.50 (−359.00, −24.98) ng/mL, and was not 
considered clinically relevant. 
Vital Signs 
No notable changes from baseline in vital signs (temperature, pulse, respiration, systolic blood 
pressure, or diastolic blood pressure) were observed during the study.

Pregnancies 
No pregnancies were reported during this study. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious Adverse Events 
One subject had a Grade 2 SAE of hypotension on Day 10, which was assessed as related to study 
drug and resolved the same day. Study drug was not interrupted. No relevant medical history or 
concomitant medication use was reported. This subject experienced multiple AEs of mostly Grade 1 
nausea, drowsiness, diarrhea, and dyspnea with a duration of 1 day beginning on Day 1 through Day 
46. The subject experienced a Grade 2 AE of abdominal pain with unknown start and end dates during 
the first month of treatment as well as a Grade 1 AE of dizziness after Day 46 with unknown start and 
end dates. No medications were administered for any of these events. Most of the AEs were assessed 
as related to study drug, and study drug dosing was not changed. This subject also experienced an AE 
of Grade 1 bradycardia that started on Day 8 and resolved Day 224. 
Deaths 
No deaths were reported during this study. 
Laboratory findings 
Overall, 28.6% of subjects (6 of 21) had a Grade 1 laboratory abnormality, no subjects had Grade 2 or 
3 laboratory abnormalities, and 4.8% of subjects (1 of 21) had a Grade 4 laboratory abnormality. 
Laboratory findings do not indicate a different safety profile compared to adults. Overall, ALT and AST 
decreased with the duration of treatment and no change from baseline in bilirubin was observed. 
Haematology 
No Grade 3 or 4 haematologic laboratory abnormalities were reported during the study. No subject 
experienced a postbaseline haemoglobin value < 10 g/dL or < 8.5 g/dL. No clinically meaningful 
changes from baseline in neutrophils, lymphocytes, haemoglobin or platelets were observed. 
Chemistry 
An isolated Grade 4 increase in potassium (hyperkalemia) was reported for 1 subject (4.8%) at Week 
1. The subject had no relevant medical history and was asymptomatic, and the value was within 
normal limits on repeat testing. 
On-Treatment Liver-Related Abnormalities 
No subject met any of the criteria for on-treatment liver-related laboratory abnormalities. The 3 liver-
related laboratory criteria assessed were as follows: 
•  AST or ALT > 3 x ULN and total bilirubin > 2 x ULN 
•  ALT > 5 x ULN 
• 
Total bilirubin > 2 x ULN

Total Bilirubin 
No Grade 3 or 4 elevations in total bilirubin were reported and no notable changes from baseline in 
total bilirubin were observed. 
Alanine Aminotransferase 
No graded ALT laboratory abnormalities were reported during this study. Coincident with suppression 
of viral replication, all subjects had ALT normalization by Week 4. During treatment, median changes 
from baseline ranged from −10 to −14 U/L. 
Aspartate Aminotransferase 
No Grade 3 or 4 AST elevations were reported during this study. Laboratory results for AST were 
similar to those for ALT. Coincident with suppression of viral replication, median AST decreased from 
baseline for the duration of the treatment period and at the posttreatment Week 4 visit. 
Safety in special populations 
Not applicable. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
As the drug interaction profile of SOF/VEL/VOX in subjects 12 to < 18 years old is not expected to 
differ from that in adult subjects, no additional drug interaction studies of SOF/VEL/VOX were 
conducted for subjects 12 to < 18 years old. No new findings relevant to the coadministration of 
SOF/VEL/VOX with other drugs are submitted with this update to the marketing application. From a 
clinical perspective, this application raised no new safety issues regarding interactions. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No subject had an AE that led to premature discontinuation or interruption of study drug. 
Post marketing experience 
No post marketing data were submitted with this application. Any off-label use of SOF/VEL/VOX in 
patients 12 to < 18 years old and any associated trends are routinely monitored by the MAH and 
documented in the PSURs. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The Vosevi paediatric study was not powered to generate a comprehensive safety database in children 
and no control arm was available for comparison. This is considered acceptable since the main 
objective of the study is to provide PK data. 
As exposure is comparable, safety can be extrapolated from the adult safety database through a PK-
bridge, in line with the EMA guidance. The CHMP also considered that eligible patients will enrol in a 
registry study GS-US-334-1113 for a total of up to 5 years for assessments of growth, quality of life, 
and long-term viral suppression (if applicable), as these issues are particular causes of concern in the 
paediatric population.  
CHMP assessment report on group of an extension of marketing authorisation and an 
extension of indication variation  
EMA/480638/2021  
Page 48/58 
 
 
 
From the limited safety dataset, there were no findings indicating a different safety profile compared to 
adults, which was considered reassuring by the CHMP.  
Further to the request from the CHMP, the MAH amended the indication statement to “patients aged 12 
years and older and weighing at least 30 kg” to avoid patients below 30 kg being dosed with Vosevi 
(400 mg /100 mg /100 mg) and risk overexposure. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The CHMP concluded that Vosevi is safe in the treatment of chronic HCV in adolescent patients 12 < 18 
years of age and weighing at least 30 kg.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable. 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Vosevi 400/100/100mg film-coated tablets. The bridging 
report submitted by the MAH has been found acceptable. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Vosevi (sofosbuvir / velpatasvir / 
voxilaprevir) is included in the additional monitoring list as it had a PASS imposed at the time of

authorisation.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
HCV infection has an estimated global prevalence of 1%, i.e. a total of 71 million individuals chronically 
infected with HCV. Although data on the global prevalence of HCV in children are limited, 
approximately 3.3 million children worldwide, aged 0 to 18 years, were estimated to be with viraemic 
HCV infection in 2018. 
The natural history of chronic HCV infection in children is relatively benign. Most children are 
asymptomatic or have mild nonspecific symptoms; cirrhosis development within childhood/adolescence 
is rare but has been reported. 
The HCV has significant genetic (RNA sequence) variability; 8 major genotypes have been identified: 
genotypes 1 and 3 are the most prevalent globally (46% and 30%, respectively) while genotypes 2, 4, 
and 6 represent approximately 23% of cases. Genotypes 5 and 7 comprise < 1%, and genotype 8 has 
only recently been identified. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
HCV treatment for adults has been transformed by the development and approval of DAA agents, 
including sofosbuvir-based compounds. Despite the high sustained virologic response rates with DAAs 
in clinical studies, as well as real-world studies, there are patients who fail multi-DAA–based therapies. 
Some of the DAAs have recently been approved for the treatment of adolescents and children. 
Although DAA failures in the paediatric population currently represent a small unmet medical need, this 
is anticipated to increase over time as DAA treatment in this population increases and retreatment 
options become limited for patients who fail DAA treatment. Vosevi would offer a treatment regimen 
for adolescents, regardless of genotype, prior treatment failure, or presence of compensated cirrhosis. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study GS-US-367-1175 was an open-label study evaluating the PK, safety and antiviral activity of 
SOF/VEL/VOX in adolescent subjects with chronic HCV infection. A total of 21 subjects were enrolled 
and received SOF/VEL/VOX for 8 weeks (all subjects were DAA-naive without compensated cirrhosis). 
All 21 subjects completed study drug and were included in both the FAS and the Safety Analysis Set.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
The favourable effects of Vosevi are well-known from the adult pivotal trials. In this paediatric 
application, the efficacy is established through a PK-bridge.   
The proposed posology in adolescents regarding SOF and VEL has previously been approved (i.e. 
Epclusa). The popPK analysis supports the posology. 
With regards to clinical outcomes, 21 of 21 patients 12 <18 years of age achieved SVR12. No subject 
had virologic failure, there was no on-treatment breakthrough or relapse observed in subjects through 
posttreatment Week 12 or posttreatment Week 24. However, it is not evident that this outcome could 
not have been reached without voxilaprevir.  
Vosevi is expected to be effective in the treatment of HCV in adolescents from 12 years of age and 
weighing at least 30 kg. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The VOX popPK model was not deemed optimal. However, based on observed PK data for VOX, the 
exposure, including Cmin, was overlapping with the adult exposure. The MAH´s conclusion that the 
VOX exposures in adolescents are similar to those in non-cirrhotic adults, for which safety and efficacy 
have been established, was agreed by the CHMP. 
Given that the pharmacologic targets of SOF/VEL/VOX are viral and not host-related, the PK-PD 
relation is expected to be unchanged without additional uncertainty being introduced in adolescents 
other than potential age-related differences in treatment adherence.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of Vosevi is well-established in adults and it is not expected to be substantially 
different in a paediatric setting. The limited paediatric safety dataset did not raise any age-specific 
issues. The treatment was well-tolerated and all reported AEs were mild to moderate (Grade 1 or 
Grade 2). One of 21 subjects experienced a Grade 2 SAE of hypotension assessed as related to study 
drug, which resolved the same day.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
This product contains three active substances: SOF, VEL and VOX. The simulated exposure for SOF and 
VEL showed slightly higher exposure in adolescents compared to adults. The proposed posology is the 
same as what has been previously deemed satisfactory in paediatric patients for combinations 
including SOF and VEL (Epclusa). The CHMP considered that the higher exposure of SOF and VEL does 
not raise concerns with regards to safety in paediatric patients weighing above 30 kg.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The favourable effects of Vosevi in terms of sustained virologic response are well-known from the adult 
pivotal trials and can be extrapolated to adolescents. 
Extrapolating from the safety profile in adults, the risks associated with Vosevi use are expected to be 
relatively mild also in adolescents. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Given the natural course of chronic HCV infection, the high cure rate and the safety profile of Vosevi, 
the favourable effects are considered to outweigh the unfavourable effects.

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Vosevi is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality and safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
consensus that the benefit-risk balance of Vosevi 200/50/50 mg film-coated tablets is favourable in the 
following indication: 
•  Vosevi is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in patients aged 12 
years and older and weighing at least 30 kg. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the marketing authorisation for Vosevi subject to 
the following conditions:

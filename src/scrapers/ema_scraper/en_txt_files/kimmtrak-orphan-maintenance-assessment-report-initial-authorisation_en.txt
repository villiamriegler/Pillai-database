2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
Orphan medicinal product designation 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2021 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
“The sponsor Pharma Gateway AB submitted on 19 May 2020 an application for designation as an 
orphan medicinal product to the European Medicines Agency for a medicinal product containing 
tebentafusp for treatment of uveal melanoma (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”). The 
application was submitted on the basis of Article 3(1)(a), first subparagraph, of Regulation (EC) No 
141/2000 on orphan medicinal products. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the condition is a distinct medical entity that would be acceptable for the purpose of orphan 
designation on the basis of distinct aetiology, histopathological, pathophysiological, genetic and 
clinical characteristics; 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing tebentafusp was 
considered justified based on objective responses in patients with relapsed/refractory uveal 
melanoma; 
the condition is life-threatening with a reduced survival in relapsed/refractory metastatic disease 
and chronically debilitating due to vision impairment (enucleation of the affected eye) and pain; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 0.88 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made.  
In addition, although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition exist in the European Union, 
the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal product 
containing tebentafusp will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. The sponsor has 
provided data that show objective responses in patients with relapsed/refractory disease. The 
Committee considered that this constitutes a clinically relevant advantage. 
Thus, the requirement under Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products is fulfilled. 
The COMP concludes that the requirements laid down in Article (3)(1)(a) and (b) of Regulation (EC) No 
141/2000 on orphan medicinal products are fulfilled. The COMP therefore recommends the designation 
of this medicinal product, containing tebentafusp, as an orphan medicinal product for the orphan 
condition: “treatment of uveal melanoma”. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made

Condition 
Uveal melanoma (UM) is a cancer that develops exclusively from melanocytes of the uvea (reviewed by 
Jager et al., 2020). The uveal tract is the middle layer of the eye and consists of the choroid, ciliary 
body and iris (Milam and Daniels, 2018; Shain et al., 2019). UM accounts for 85% of all primary 
intraocular neoplasms (Patel et al., 2011; Maio et al., 2013). Primary UM arise predominantly in the 
choroid (85–90% of cases), the layer that lies between the retina and the white sclera, and, rarely in 
the ciliary body (5-8% of cases) and iris (3–5% of cases) (Nathan et al., 2015; Krantz et al., 2017). 
The aetiology of UM is unclear. Unlike cutaneous melanomas (CMs), exposure to ultraviolet radiation 
(UVR), specifically UV-B (Ferguson et al., 2015), is not a risk factor in UM. Most primary UM arise de 
novo but a small proportion can develop from a naevus or mole. The clinical signs and symptoms of 
UM vary considerably between UM patients and are dependent on the site of the tumour within the 
uvea; however, most patients present with a mixture of symptoms including ‘flashing lights’, an 
increasing ‘blind spot’ within their visual field, blurred visual acuity, ‘floaters’, pain, and/or a visible 
tumour mass (if anteriorly located, e.g., in the iris) (Damato, 2012). Many patients actually have no 
symptoms, and a ‘black lump’ is seen at the back of the eye on vision testing, as an incidental finding.   
Examination of the eye (fundoscopy) typically reveals a mass, which can be pigmented or 
non-pigmented, and an associated retinal detachment. Fluorescein angiography, which highlights the 
blood vessels, shows a double circulation within choroidal melanomas. Angiogenesis is a prominent 
feature in choroidal melanomas and is likely to be associated with the relationship described between 
the melanocytes and the vasculature. It is also likely to explain the dissemination route of UM, with 
this process occurring even quite early in tumour growth. Finally, ultrasound echography demonstrates 
a mottled appearance with low to medium attenuation and vascular pulsations can also be seen when 
using A-scan ultrasound (Singh et al., 2019). 
Up to 50% of UM patients will develop metastatic disease usually between 2-10 years after diagnosis 
(Jager et al., 2020). UM spreads exclusively via the blood from the eye to the liver and then spreads 
systemically to other organs, principally the lung and bones (Lorigan et al., 1991). UM exceptionally 
rarely spreads to lymph nodes or to the brain (Lorigan et al., 1991), unlike other melanomas 
(Keung and Gershenwald, 2018). 
The approved therapeutic indication “KIMMTRAK is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of 
human leukocyte antigen (HLA-A)*02:01-positive adult patients with unresectable or metastatic uveal 
melanoma” falls within the scope of the designated orphan condition “treatment of uveal melanoma”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP, see 
EPAR. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
Metastatic disease develops in approximately 50% of patients after treatment of the primary tumour 
and 90% of those with metastases elsewhere (bowel, bone, lung and lymph nodes) also having liver 
metastases. Metastasis is exclusively haematogenous, and the liver is the predominant first site of 
metastatic disease (Nathan et al., 2015).   
The median survival of metastatic uveal melanoma is typically less than 12 months (Rantala et al., 
2019). Despite extensive investigation of metastatic UM in the clinic, no systemic treatment has 
demonstrated improved survival. In Europe, the 5-year relative survival is 68.8% (Virgili et al., 2008; 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000068646 
Page 5/9 
 
 
 
 
 
Mallone et al., 2012). Analysis by Rao and colleagues of outcomes from the Collaborative Ocular 
Melanoma Study (COMS), which has established modern treatment recommendations for UM, 
demonstrated an improvement in 5-year survival for eye-preserving treatments versus enucleation 
(81.4% versus 59.2%, p<0.01) (Rao et al., 2017). 
The COMP concluded that the condition is life-threatening with a reduced survival 
in relapsed/refractory disease and chronically debilitating especially due to enucleation and in 
metastatic disease due to pain, organ failure, and treatment burden. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
Based on NORDCAN, IARC and other national databases reporting the ICD-10 code statistics, the 
sponsor estimated the EU number of malignant neoplasms of the eye and adnexa (ICD-10 C69). This 
includes both UM and other aetiologies of primary eye cancer. Incidence rates for ICD-10 code C69 
was presented per 10,000 inhabitants per year.  
Country-specific histological data for UM reported by the International Agency for Research on Cancer 
(IARC) (IARC XI histology, 2017) were used to determine the proportion of UM patients from the 
above reported cases for eye cancer. These proportions were applied to country-specific, age- and 
gender-specific eye cancer incidence data to obtain UM incidence for each country. 
Depending on the country, the proportion of UM patients varied from 41.5% to 90%. Extrapolated UM 
incidence rates based on histological data gave a range from 0.01 per 10,000 (Cyprus) to 0.12 per 
10,000 (Netherlands), indicating a geographical variation. On average, UM incidence rate of 0.06 per 
10,000 inhabitants is estimated for Europe. The sponsor discussed the variability of patient survival 
depending on the stage upon diagnosis. In the population-based study based on SEER data 
(Mahendraraj et al., 2016), a median OS of 14.6±0.2 years was reported, and the sponsor adopted this 
value to derive prevalence of UM in the EU.  
Based on this data, a current point prevalence of 0.88 per 10,000 EEA inhabitants was estimated. This 
estimate is acceptable.  
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
According to the sponsor, treatment of primary UM is well-established and effective (Afshar and 
Damato, 2015).  
There are no therapies approved specifically for metastatic UM. Treatments introduced for cutaneous 
melanoma (CM) over the last 10 years have not significantly benefited patients with UM.  
Kinase inhibitors approved for BRAF mutation positive CM are ineffective with metastatic UM because 
of the absence of BRAF mutations in UM. Immunotherapies such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, have 
not produced significant improvements in overall survival (OS) with metastatic UM and response rates 
are very low (typically 5%).   
Guidelines for the treatment of UM are available from France. Guidelines in Germany are limited to 
treatment of cutaneous melanoma and state that they are not applicable to UM. The guidance “Prise en 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000068646 
Page 6/9 
 
 
 
 
 
charge des mélanomes oculaires, le minimum pour les oncologues” (Mathis et al., 2018) includes 
management of primary UM, prognostic factors and monitoring. The guidance states that management 
of patients with metastatic disease is often complex and that systemic therapies, such as 
chemotherapy, targeted therapies, and immunotherapy yield limited response rates. No specific drug 
therapies are recommended.  
The sponsor listed all products with a broad label encompassing all melanoma: encorafenib, 
cobimetinib, dacarbazine, talimogene laherparepvec, interferon alfa-2b, pembrolizumab, trametinib, 
binimetinib, fotemustine, nivolumab, dabrafenib, ipilimumab and vemurafenib. These products will be 
discussed as satisfactory methods of treatment of uveal melanoma. 
Significant benefit 
There are no products authorised for UM. However, all products with a broad label encompassing all 
melanoma are discussed as satisfactory methods of treatment of uveal melanoma. 
The sponsor claimed significant benefit based on improved efficacy. The significant benefit of 
tebentafusp as compared to investigator's choice was based on results of the pivotal phase 3 study 
202, an ongoing phase 3, open-label, multicentre randomised study evaluating the efficacy and safety 
of tebentafusp versus investigator’s choice (dacarbazine, ipilimumab, and pembrolizumab) in adult 
HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with metastatic UM, who have not received prior systemic therapy in 
the metastatic setting. In this study, objective response rate (ORR) was 9.1% and a statistically 
significant improvement in OS was observed, reducing the relative risk of death by 49% compared 
with investigator’s choice of either pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, or dacarbazine. The estimated 1-year 
OS rate was 73.2% for tebentafusp and 58.5% for investigator’s choice.  
The sponsor also provided indirect comparison of tebentafusp to available treatment options for UM. 
Treatment with single agent systemic chemotherapy (e.g., dacarbazine, DHA-paclitaxel, fotemustine) 
resulted in less than 10% ORR with median progression free survival (PFS) of 1.8 to 3.9 months and 
median OS of 6.7 to 13.8 months (Bedikian et al., 2003; Homsi et al., 2010; Marshall et al., 2013; 
Carvajal et al., 2014; Leyvraz et al., 2014; Carvajal et al., 2018). The longest median OS was reported 
for fotemustine, which provided a 2-year survival of 20.2% (Leyvraz et al., 2014); 1-year survival was 
not reported. 
Safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab was investigated in a Phase 1 study in melanoma patients 
(KEYNOTE-001). Twenty patients with ocular melanoma treated in this study did not benefit from 
treatment with pembrolizumab, highlighting the difference in clinical response between UM/ocular 
melanoma and other melanomas. No patient with ocular melanoma achieved an objective response; 
stable disease was reported in 6 patients as compared with an ORR of 9.1% with tebentafusp in the 
randomised controlled study IMCgp100-202. 
Nivolumab monotherapy was investigated in a Phase 2 single-arm, open label study in patients with 
stage III (unresectable) or stage IV metastatic melanoma after prior treatment containing an anti-
CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody (study CA209172). 10% (103) of patients treated had ocular/uveal 
melanoma. Four of the 61 evaluable patients (6.6%) achieved an objective response as compared to 
an ORR of 9.1% with tebentafusp. 
The efficacy of ipilimumab or PD-1 inhibition tested in UM is limited and similar to the efficacy observed 
with single agent chemotherapy. Ipilimumab and PD1 inhibition combination therapy demonstrated low 
response rates of 0–8% with poor durability with metastatic UM (Luke et al., 2013; Maio et al., 2013; 
Pereira et al., 2013; Nathan et al., 2015; Zimmer et al., 2015). Treatment with PD1 inhibitors have

shown very limited efficacy with metastatic UM (Kottschade et al., 2016; Piperno-Neumann et al., 
2016; Tsai et al., 2016). 
A systematic review of immune checkpoint inhibitors (Heppt et al., 2017) identified 12 studies 
published up to 14 August 2017. The highest median OS and 1-year survival were for nivolumab 
monotherapy at 11 months and 47%, respectively (Schadendorf et al., 2017). The authors concluded 
that the evidence does not support the use of ipilimumab monotherapy or in combination with PD-1 
inhibition for the treatment of metastatic UM. A meta-analysis based on individual patient data from 
29 studies published between 1988 and 2015 comprising 965 patients with metastatic UM and most 
recent study published in 2015 (Zimmer et al., 2015) demonstrated that the median PFS was 
3.3 months, median OS was 10.2 months, and 1-year survival was 43% (Khoja et al., 2019). Liver-
directed therapy provided longest median OS, 14.6 months, and the highest 1-year survival, 57.2%. 
Immunotherapy (monotherapy) provided the shortest median OS, 8.9 months. A meta-analysis of 
survival results from 78 articles across all treatments suggest no clinically significant difference in OS 
by treatment modality or decade of publication. Most of the difference in reported OS likely is 
attributable to surveillance, selection, and publication bias rather than treatment-related prolongation 
(Rantala et al., 2019). 
The sponsor also argued that there are no effective treatments for metastatic UM that extend survival, 
and that no standard of care exists. Available treatments for metastatic UM are mainly adapted from 
CM protocols, although they are distinct disease entities in terms of biology, genetics, and clinical 
course. Therapeutic advances that have translated to improved survival in CM have not yielded equal 
survival benefits in metastatic UM, with 1-year OS rates in metastatic UM of only 43% in the more 
than 2 lines setting (Khoja et al., 2019) and 52% in the 1st line setting (Rantala et al., 2019).  
The COMP agreed on the significant benefit of tebentafusp as compared to investigator's choice based 
on the results of the pivotal study. In addition, in comparison with pembrolizumab and nivolumab 
which are authorized for the treatment of melanoma and based on data available for a subset of 
patients with UM, the ORR observed with tebentafusp is higher. Finally, based on a systematic review 
of immune checkpoint inhibitors, OS for tebentafusp compares favourably with respect to 
immunotherapy.  
Based on the above, the COMP concluded that the significant benefit of tebentafusp in HLA-A*02:01-
positive adult patients with unresectable or metastatic uveal melanoma is acceptable.

5.  COMP position adopted on 25 February 2022 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product. 
the prevalence of uveal melanoma (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to 
remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be 0.9 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, 
at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life-threatening with a reduced survival in relapsed/refractory disease and 
chronically debilitating especially due to enucleation and in metastatic disease due to pain, organ 
failure, and treatment burden; 
although satisfactory methods for the treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union, the assumption that Kimmtrak may be of potential significant benefit to those 
affected by the orphan condition still holds. The sponsor provided data from the pivotal clinical trial 
demonstrating that Kimmtrak improved overall survival in comparison to standard of care 
treatment in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma, who have not received prior systemic 
therapy in the metastatic setting.  
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Kimmtrak, tebentafusp for 
treatment of uveal melanoma (EU/3/21/2397) is not removed from the Community Register of Orphan 
Medicinal Products.

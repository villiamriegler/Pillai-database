Introduction 
On 17th October 2016, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Mircera, in accordance 
with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Information on the development program 
MIRCERA was first approved in the European Economic Area in 2007 for the treatment of anemia 
associated with CKD including adult patients on dialysis and those not on dialysis. Since then, the drug 
has been approved in 112 countries worldwide, and anextensive body of post-marketing experience in 
adults is available. 
In January 2009 the PDCO and the marketing authorization holder (MAH) agreed to a pediatric 
investigation plan (PIP) which consisted of the following two studies: 
Phase II study NH19707 with primary objectives:  
• 
• 
To determine the starting dose of MIRCERA in pediatric patients with CKD on hemodialysis when 
switching from stable maintenance treatment with epoetin alfa, epoetin beta or darbepoetin alfa, 
To demonstrate changes in hemoglobin (Hb) over time in response to different intravenous (iv) 
doses of MIRCERA. 
Phase III study NH19708 with primary objective: 
• 
To confirm the optimal dose of MIRCERA selected in the previous exploratory dose-finding study, 
in a larger group of pediatric patients with CKD on dialysis and not yet on dialysis. 
In July 2012, the MAH submitted a PIP modification to increase the number of patients in the phase II 
study in the group having a stable Hb response and to extend the completion timelines for both studies. 
Patient numbers were increased due to concerns that the variability in Hb was considerably higher than 
assumed in the original protocol sample size calculations.  The decision was also made to replace all 
patients who withdrew early from the study (mainly due to the high transplantation rate in paediatric 
patients), leading to even higher requirements in patient numbers. Timelines were extended due to the 
difficulty of recruiting paediatric patients with CKD on hemodialysis despite international recruitment. 
As such, it took 7 years with 28 sites to complete the phase II study of 64 patients; safety extension 
phase was also shortened because the last two patients were transplanted. Thus, the fulfilment of this 
PIP, as it was originally agreed in January 2009 has been difficult. In support of the current PIP 
modification, a systematic literature review to identify data for estimating the size of patient population 
eligible for participation in the planned phase III trial has been prepared. Data has been sought from 
different countries and age groups on the administration of erythropoiesis stimulating agents. The 
calculations show that the number of CKD paediatric patients on peritoneal dialysis is limited, 
(approximately 1400 patients aged 5-19 years are estimated to be on peritoneal dialysis at a given 
time in Europe and the US).  
The new proposed Phase II study NH19708 would be conducted in order to confirm the extrapolation of 
results for the subcutaneous administration of MIRCERA in pediatric patients on peritoneal dialysis and 
pre-dialysis. 
The above suggested study would shorten study time lines and supports the submission of a solid data 
set to CHMP, to support a paediatric indication for MIRCERA in the near future.

The two phase II studies, along with PK/PD modelling and simulation will be used to support a 
paediatric indication. 
Given that study NH19707 has already generated data in paediatric patients on haemodialysis, such 
patients will not be included in the proposed phase II study, which will therefore enrol patients on 
peritoneal dialysis and patients not yet on dialysis.

STUDY NH19707 
Title: An Open-Label, Multi-Centre, Multiple Dose Study to Determine the Optimum Starting Dose of 
Intravenous MIRCERA for Maintenance Treatment of Anaemia in Paediatric Patients with Chronic 
Kidney Disease on Haemodialysis. 
Description 
This phase II, dose-finding study was an open-label, multicentre, multiple dose study of MIRCERA 
administered once every 4 weeks iv for 20 weeks in paediatric CKD patients aged 5-17 years old 
receiving haemodialysis who switched from other ESAs (epoetinalfa/beta or darbepoetin alfa). In the 
core study period, after the first administration of MIRCERA, dose adjustments were permitted to 
maintain target Hb levels, which were measured once per week. 
To find the optimum MIRCERA starting dose, the study tested two groups with different conversion 
factors related to their previous ESA dose. 
The first 16 patients (intermediate-conversion-factor group, described as Group 1 in the protocol and 
clinical study report [CSR]) were enrolled and treated with MIRCERA at a starting dose based on their 
previous ESA dose (4 x previous weekly epoetin dose [IU] / 250 or 4 x previous weekly 
darbepoetinalfa dose [μg] / 1.1). After 16 patients had completed at least 16 weeks of treatment, a 
preliminary assessment of the safety and efficacy of MIRCERA was made.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

For the preliminary efficacy assessment, the uncorrected 90% confidence interval (CI)for the average 
Hb change from baseline to weeks 14-16 was calculated. If Hb levels had been adequately controlled 
with balanced dose increases and decreases, no other dose group would have been started, and 
additional patients would have been recruited to receive the same MIRCERA dose (Figure 1). However, 
a high-conversion-factor group was required (described as Group 2 in the protocol). 
Patients in Group 2 received MIRCERA based on a conversion factor from their previous ESA dose, 
double that of Group 1 (4 x previous weekly epoetin dose [IU] / 125 or4 x previous weekly darbepoetin 
alfa dose [μg] / 0.55). Similarly, after 16 patients had completed the first 16 weeks of treatment, a 
preliminary assessment of this group was also made. Based on the same criterion for decision making 
(Hb change from baseline within ±1g/dL, balanced dose changes and safety considerations), the 
decision was taken to recruit 20 additional patients into this high conversion factor group (Group 2). 
* The total number of patients was to be at least 36 in the group with optimum dose conversion 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The primary objectives of the study NH19707 were 
• To determine the starting dose of MIRCERA in paediatric patients with CKD on haemodialysis when 
switching from stable maintenance treatment with epoetin alfa, epoetin beta or darbepoetin alfa 
• To demonstrate changes in Hb over time in response to different iv doses of MIRCERA 
The secondary objectives of the study NH19707 were: 
• To study the pharmacokinetics (PK) of MIRCERA in paediatric patients 
• To explore MIRCERA exposure-response relationship 
• To assess the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of MIRCERA in paediatric patients 
• To document long-term safety and efficacy of MIRCERA administration in paediatric patients with 
anaemia associated with CKD

Study design 
This phase II, dose-finding study was an open-label, multicentre, multiple dose study of MIRCERA 
administered once every 4 weeks iv for 20 weeks in paediatric patients 5-17years old with CKD 
receiving haemodialysis who switched from other ESAs (epoetinalfa/beta or darbepoetin alfa). In this 
core study period, after the first administration of MIRCERA, dose adjustments were permitted to 
maintain target Hb levels, which were measured once a week. 
If the lower limit of the CI was ≥-1 g/dL, the upper limit ≤1 g/dL and the number of dose increases 
and decreases was approximately balanced across the patients, no other dose group would have been 
started, and additional patients would have been recruited to receive the same MIRCERA dose. 
This condition was not met; the upper limit of the CI for average Hb change was below -1 g/dL. Based 
on this finding and consideration of dose changes and safety information, the Data and Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB) approved the initiation of a high conversion-factor group as per the study 
design (denominated Group 2 in the protocol). If the lower limit of the CI had been above 1 g/dL, a 
lower-dose group could have been initiated (figure 1). 
Patients in Group 2 received MIRCERA based on a conversion factor from their previous ESA dose, 
double that of Group 1 (4 × previous weekly epoetin dose [IU] / 125 or4 × previous weekly 
darbepoetin alfa dose [μg] / 0.55). Similarly, after 16 patients had completed the first 16 weeks of 
treatment, a preliminary assessment of this group was also made. Based on the same criterion for 
decision making (Hb change from baseline within ±1g/dL, balanced dose changes and safety 
considerations), the decision was taken, with the support of the DSMB, to recruit further patients into 
this high conversion factor group (Group 2).  
Although the protocol provided for the possibility of a third dose group, this was not considered 
necessary. The preliminary assessment also suggested higher than expected variability in Hb; to 
account for this, the protocol was amended to increase the minimum size of Group 2 from 25 to 
36patients. At the same time, the decision was made to replace all patients who did not complete at 
least 18 weeks of treatment. 
Patients completing the 20 weeks of treatment with Hb within ± 1 g/dL of their baseline Hb and within 
the target range of 10-12 g/dL were eligible to enter an optional 52-weeksafety extension period. 
During this period, the patients continued to receive MIRCERAonce every 4 weeks and Hb 
concentration measurements occurred less frequently (every 4 weeks).

anaemia on haemodialysis treatment and who were receiving maintenance treatment with an 
erythropoietic agent. 
At least one third of the patients in each dose group were to be in the age group of ≥ 5years to < 12

Treatments 
MIRCERA (available in pre-filled syringes) was administered by iv injection, using the venous injection 
port of the hemodialysis lines. 
The low or the high conversion-factor doses were to be considered only if the intermediate conversion-
factor dose (Group 1) did not result in an adequate Hb response. After review of the data from the 
intermediate-conversion factor group, the DSMB recommended initiation of Group 2

The dose of MIRCERA was adjusted to maintain the individual patient’s Hb within a target range of ± 1 
g/dL of their baseline Hb and between 10.0 to 12.0 g/dL. Baseline Hb was calculated as the mean of 
Hb values between week -2 and week -1. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint in this study was the change in Hb concentration (g/dL) between the baseline 
and evaluation periods. This was calculated on a per-patient basis, using an area under the curve 
(AUC) approach to calculate an individual’s average for both the baseline and evaluation periods and 
taking the difference. 
The baseline period was defined as all assessments between the day of first study dose and the 
previous 20 days. The Hb value on the day of the first dose was included in the baseline calculation as 
this assessment was performed before the first dose was given. 
The average Hb value for each individual during the evaluation period was based on all values recorded 
on study days 111 to 138. 
The following were assessed as secondary endpoints: 
1. The number of patients with an average Hb concentration during the evaluation period within ±1 
g/dL of their baseline Hb 
2. The number of patients with an average Hb concentration during the evaluation period above, within 
or below the range of 10-12 g/dL 
3. The incidence of RBC transfusions 
4. Change in reticulocyte count (x10000 /μL) between the baseline and evaluation periods 
The following exploratory efficacy endpoints were assessed: 
1. Change in dose over time 
2. Change in dose between study start and evaluation period 
3. The rate of rise in Hb concentration during the titration period 
MIRCERA PK parameters were derived from serum concentration versus time data obtained from blood 
sampling from seven time points following the third iv administration of MIRCERA at week 9. PK 
parameters were read directly from the serum concentration versus time profiles or were estimated 
from the serum concentrations by non-compartmental methods.

Statistical Methods 
Due to the nature of the study, no formal testing was planned and all tests and p-values were 
descriptive. 
This was an exploratory study without a powered statistical group comparison. Therefore no formal 
sample size estimation was performed. However, to determine the optimum starting dose of iv 
MIRCERA, the following sample-size calculations were made as an indication. 
Providing the optimum dose maintains the Hb at the baseline level and the true change from baseline 
was equal to zero, the number of patients sufficient to provide80% power that the 90% CI for Hb 
change from baseline was between -1 and +1 g/dL is: 
• 16 evaluable patients - provided that the standard deviation was <1.3 g/dL 
• 36 evaluable patients - provided that the standard deviation was <2.0 g/dL 
Additional patients were enrolled to replace patients who did not complete at least 18 weeks of 
treatment, to ensure a sufficient number of evaluable patients. 
At least one third of the patients in each dose group were to be in the age group of ≥5 to<12 years. 
Analysis Populations 
The following analysis populations were defined in the SAP. 
Intention-to-treat Population 
The intention-to-treat (ITT) population included all patients enrolled in the study. 
Safety Population 
All patients who received at least one dose of the trial medication and had a safety follow-up were 
included in the safety population. 
Completers Population 
All patients in the safety population who completed at least 18 weeks of treatment (and returned for 
an assessment in week 19), signifying that they had at least 3 Hb assessments during the evaluation 
period, were included in the completers population. 
Per Protocol Population 
The Per-Protocol (PP) population includes all patients included in the safety population and who had no 
major protocol violations as defined below. 
1. Patients with less than 3 Hb values during the evaluation period 
2. Patients who missed any administration of study medication at week 13 or week 17 
3. Patients who did not fulfill the inclusion criteria for 
– Hb

– iron levels 
4. Patients who fulfilled any of the following exclusion criteria: 
– Hemoglobinopathies 
– Haemolysis 
– Overt gastrointestinal bleeding within 8 weeks before screening or during the screening 
period 
– RBC transfusion within 8 weeks before screening or during the screening period 
 Extension Patients Population 
The Extension Patients Population is defined as all patients having signed the informed consent for the 
optional safety extension period. 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
For patients with no recorded Hb during the evaluation period, the primary endpoint was missing. For 
all outputs concerning Hb, no imputation was made for missing values and analysis performed on 
observed cases only; if an RBC transfusion occurred, Hb values measured in the following 3 weeks 
were excluded (to correct for any Hb increase caused by the transfusion); any Hb values recorded after 
a renal transplantation were censored. 
Descriptive statistics of the primary endpoint were calculated. In addition, baseline covariate adjusted 
estimates of Hb change from baseline, by dose group, and the corresponding 95% CI were calculated 
from an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model. The model contains the patient’s baseline Hb as 
covariate and dependent effects for dose group, age group and previous ESA group. 
The primary analysis of the study was based on the ITT population, defined as all patients enrolled. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Between July 2008 and June 2015, a total of 112 patients were screened at 28 sites in Belgium (2), 
France (6), Germany (5), Hungary (1), Italy (1), Poland (5), Romania (1), Spain (3), Thailand (2) and 
Ukraine (2). 
Of the 112 screened patients, 64 were enrolled (16 initially in Group 1 and then 48 in Group 2, 
following a preliminary analysis of Group 1. 
The reasons for 48 screening failures were as follows (information derived from IxRS and not validated 
in the study database): 30 patients with pre-dialysis Hb levels outside10-12 g/dL, 4 patients with 
poorly controlled hypertension, 4 patients with unstable epoetin or darbepoetin alfa doses prior to 
screening, 3 patients with no signed ICF, 2 patients with inadequate haemodialysis, 2 patients with 
severe hyperparathyroidism, 1 patient with inadequate iron status, 1 patient with gastrointestinal 
bleeding during screening, and 1 patient with a high likelihood of withdrawal (kidney transplantation 
planned).

Replacement of patients not completing at least 18 weeks of treatment lead to a total of48 patients in 
Group 2, 12 more than the protocol specified minimum of 36.12 patients in Group 1 and 35 in Group 2 
completed the evaluation period. 
Thirty-seven of these completers went on to participate in the optional 1-year safety extension, and 
this optional safety extension was completed by 17 patients.

Table. Summary of withdrawals (core period): ITT population 
During the extension period, 20 patients withdrew (16 due to renal transplant, two withdrew consent 
and a further two, at the same centre, due to ‘repair of the dialysis station’). 
ITT and Safety Populations 
As all enrolled patients received at least one dose of study drug and had a safety follow-up visit, the 
ITT population and safety population were the same. These populations comprised 16 patients in 
Group 1 and 48 in Group 2 (64 patients overall).

Completers Population 
The (core study period) completers population (patients completing at least 18 weeks of treatment 
with at least three Hb assessments during the evaluation period) comprised 12patients in Group 1 and 
36 in Group 2. Note that one patient dropped out at week 19 and so is included in the completers 
population but did not complete the evaluation period. 
The PP population comprised the patients in the completers population with the exclusion of 2 
additional patients in Group 2 who were protocol violators of the inclusion criterion regarding iron 
levels. The PP population thus comprised 12 patients in Group 1 and 34 in Group 2. 
Baseline data 
Patient Demographics 
Overall, there were 34 male patients (53%), with a higher representation in Group 1 compared with 
Group 2 (Table 11). 
The majority of patients were Caucasian, and the mean ± SD age was 11 ± 3.2 years in Group 1 and 
13 ± 3.1 years in Group 2. Younger patients (aged 5-11 years) were more strongly represented in 
Group 1 (56%) compared with Group 2 (33%)The mean baseline body surface area (according to the 
Mosteller formula) was 1.14 and 1.24 in Group 1 and Group 2, respectively.

Other Treatments 
Apart from surgical and medical procedures (all patients were on haemodialysis), anticoagulants and 
antianemic agents the most frequently used concomitant treatments were vitamins and minerals (15 
[94%] in Group 1 and 44 [92%] in Group 2), of which vitamin D supplements were the top 3 
treatments; calcium compounds and regulators (9 [56%] in Group 1 and 37 [77%] in Group 2) and 
supplements (11 [69%] in Group 1 and 30 [63%]in Group 2), of which the most frequently used were 
sodium bicarbonate and carnitine.

PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT 
In the ANCOVA model of this data, with adjustment for dose group (Group 1/Group 2),age (5-11/12-
18 years), previous ESA treatment (darbepoetin alfa/epoetin alfa or beta)and baseline Hb AUC, the 
adjusted mean change in Hb AUC from baseline to evaluation period was -0.74 (95% CI: -1.32 to -

0.16) for Group 1 and -0.09 (95% CI: -0.45 to 0.26)for Group 2 (Table 18). Terms from the model 
show no indication of a strong effect on change in Hb due to previous ESA treatment or age. 
In Group 2, 19 patients had Hb 1 g/dL or more above their baseline value at week 3, 17at week 4, and 
11 at week 5. The corresponding tabulations to the graphs indicate that based on the third quartile, 
75% of patients were under 12.5 g/dL at week 4, and less than 1.75 g/dL from their baseline value. 
The maximum Hb value seen at this time was 14.7 g/dL.

SECONDARY EFFICACY ENDPOINTS 
• 
Patients With Haemoglobin 10-12 g/dL during Evaluation and With Change from Baseline ± 1 g/dL 
During the evaluation period, in Group 2, 75% of patients maintained Hb values within ± 1 g/dL of 
baseline and 81% maintained Hb values within 10-12 g/dL (in Group 1,these figures were 58% and 
75%, respectively) (Table 20). The proportions of patients with Hb values within ± 1 g/dL and 
within 10-12 g/dL were 69% in Group 2 and 58% in Group 1.

Period: Safety Population 
In Group 2, the within-patient change in the 4-weekly MIRCERA dose during the evaluation period 
compared to their first dose was in general small, as indicated by a median ratio of 1.0 and a mean 
ratio of 1.1. In the case of Group 1, this ratio was larger (median ratio, 1.6; mean ratio, 1.9). 
Conversion Factors for Previous Weekly ESA Dose during the Evaluation Period 
The conversion factors for previously weekly ESA dose to equivalent weekly MIRCERA dose during the 
evaluation period are shown in Table 25. In Group 2, the median [IQR] conversion factors were 1.8 
[1.4, 2.8] for darbepoetin alfa and 0.008 [0.005, 0.01] for epoetin alfa/beta. These are both very close 
to the conversion factors used to calculate the first dose (1/0.55=1.8 and 1/125=0.008 for 
darbepoetin and epoetins respectively).

Dose Adjustments during the Core Study Period 
During the core study period, dose changes occurred frequently in both conversion factor groups (77% 
of patients in Group 2 and 81% in Group 1 required a dose change)(Table 26). A lower proportion of 
patients in Group 2 compared to Group 1 required a dose increase only during the core study period 
(29% compared to 56%). A greater proportion of patients in Group 2 required no dose change (23%) 
compared with Group1 (19%). A greater proportion of patients in Group 2 had both dose decreases 
and increases (38%) compared with Group 1 (13%). 
In terms of absolute numbers of dose changes, the mean number of dose increases and decreases was 
1.69 and 0.25, respectively, in Group 1 and 1.19 and 0.73, respectively, in Group 2

Sensitivity Analysis 
The changes in average Hb between baseline and evaluation period in the population were similar to 
those reported in the ITT population. 
As no imputation was made for missing values in the primary analysis, in effect, this population 
includes data for two less patients. 
In the analysis imputing missing Hb values using the LOCF method, as originally specified in the 
protocol, results were also very similar to the ITT change from baseline values without imputation. 
Thus, in Group 1, the mean change from baseline (per patient)was -0.86 g/dL and in Group 2 -0.22 
g/dL compared to -0.78 g/dL and -0.15g/dL, respectively, without imputation. 
EFFICACY EVALUATIONS DURING THE SAFETY EXTENSIONPERIOD 
In Group 2, during the safety extension period, all mean Hb values remained within the10-12 g/dL 
range (Figure 12). In Group 1, although mean values were below this range at some time points 
during the core study period, in the safety extension period, mean values in this group also remained 
within the 10-12 g/dL.

Safety results 
The majority of patients (77%) reported at least one AE in the core study period. 
• During the core-study period, serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 16patients overall 
(25%). Two of these SAEs were considered related to MIRCERA. A further two were considered life-
threatening (intracranial hematoma leading to death and procedural hemorrhage). 
• One patient died during the study from an intracranial hematoma, considered by the investigator as 
unrelated to the study drug. This patient was the only patient who discontinued MIRCERA dosing for 
safety reasons.

• During the safety extension period, in which patients were exposed to MIRCERA for up to a further 
52 weeks, the overall pattern of reported AEs was consistent with that observed in the core study 
period. SAEs were reported in 24% of patients (none were reported as related to the study drug by the 
investigator). No patients discontinued treatment due to an AE.

Safety Population 
Discussion on clinical aspects 
This study represents the primary source of data for MIRCERA use in children. The first and last 
patients were enrolled in July 2008 and June 2015. The fact that the study took7 years to enroll 64 
patients at 28 sites in 10 countries points to the logistic challenge of recruiting pediatric patients on 
hemodialysis receiving stable ESA treatment. An additional challenge was the high drop-out rate due to 
renal transplantation (20% of patients during the core study period and 43% of patients during the 
safety extension period), even though patients with a high likelihood of withdrawal due to renal 
transplantation were to be excluded from the study. 
EXTENT OF EXPOSURE TO STUDY TREATMENT 
Table 41 shows the actual number of injected MIRCERA administrations; 11 patients in Group 1 and 24 
patients in Group 2 received at least 5 administrations. For patients who did not receive all doses, 
either they withdrew from the study or dosing was temporarily suspended because Hb continued to 
increase (Hb> 12 g/dL) despite a first dose reduction, and not for safety reasons.

During the core study period, the median cumulative total dose of MIRCERA was 466 μgin the Group 2 
and 207 μg in the Group 1. The highest single, individually injected dose was 560 μg received by 
patient 3504, equivalent to 11.4 μg/kg with a total cumulative dose of 1950 μg. The highest 
cumulative dose was 2000 μg, from patient 6603, who regularly received 450 μg or 9 μg/kg. 
Throughout the entire study (including the safety extension period), the median number of 
administrations was 5.5 in Group 1 and 7.5 in Group 2. Four patients in Group 1 (25%) and 7 patients 
in Group 2 (15%) received at least 18administrations and one in Group 2 received 19. 
COMMON ADVERSE EVENTS 
Overall, 49/64 patients (77%) reported at least one AE during the core study period(12/16 [75%] in 
Group 1 and 37/48 [77%] in Group 2) , for a full summary of all AEs during the core study period, see. 
The most commonly affected SOCs (with > 15% of patients overall with AEs) were Infections and 
infestations (30/64patients overall [47%]), General disorders and administration site conditions 
(12/64patients [19%]), Gastrointestinal disorders (12/64 patients overall [19%]) and Nervous system 
disorders (12/64 patients [19%]). 
The individual AEs reported in more than 5% of patients overall were nasopharyngitis(9/64 patients 
overall [14%]), headache (9/64 [14%]), vomiting (6/64 patients [9%]),hypertension (8/64 patients 
overall [13%]), abdominal pain (4/64 patients overall [6%]),and bronchitis (4/64 patients overall 
[6%]). 
Seven AEs in 5/64 patients (8%) overall (1 AE in 1 patient in Group 1 and 6 AEs in 4patients in Group 
2) were considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug. 
Safety Extension Period

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/67470/2017 
Page 32/39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During the safety extension period, 27 patients (73%) experienced at least one AE (4[44%] in Group 1 
and 23 [82%] in Group 2). 
The most frequently reported events were Infections and infestations (17 patients overall [46%] had 
an AE in this SOC) and Gastrointestinal disorders (8 patients [22%]). 
The most frequently reported individual AEs overall were headache (6 [16%]), hypertension (5 [14%]) 
and nasopharyngitis (7 [19%]). 
Two patients (both in Group 2) had 2 AEs considered by the investigator to be related to the study 
drug: anemia and urinary tract infection. 
ADVERSE EVENTS BY INTENSITY 
Overall, there were 2 life-threatening AEs and 10 severe AEs in 7/64 patients (11%), 4 of which were 
not classified as SAEs during the core study period. Of the remaining AEs, there were 42 moderate AEs 
in 26/64 patients (41%) and 81 mild AEs in 35/64 patients(55%). 
The two life-threatening AEs, both occurring in patients in Group 2 and reported by the investigator as 
unrelated to the study medication, were intracranial hematoma and procedural hemorrhage during 
dialysis caused by a poorly adapted dialysate filter and leading to worsening of anemia. 
The only severe AE to be reported more than once was arteriovenous fistula thrombosis(2 patients, 1 
in each group). One of these cases was classified as an SAE, and both were considered related to the 
study drug by the investigator. The only other severe AE considered related to the study drug by the 
investigator were hyperphosphatemia and hyperkalemia. 
Safety Extension Period 
Overall, there were no life-threatening AEs and 5 severe AEs reported during the safety extension 
period (all in patients in Group 2). These events were hypotension, hypertension, arteriovenous fistula 
thrombosis, arterial injury, and sleep disorder. None of these events were considered by the 
investigator to be related to the study drug. 
DEATHS 
One patient died during the study (in the core study period). The cause of death was reported as 
intracranial hematoma. The patient had experienced head trauma as a result of a domestic accident in 
which he stumbled over a carpet, hitting his head on a chair, apparently without any immediate 
symptoms or signs. Two days later he received heparin and underwent dialysis, and subsequently 
experienced vomiting and seizures. ACT scan revealed intracranial hematoma. A craniotomy was 
performed and hematoma was evacuated. Although the patient was reported as feeling well the next 
day, his condition deteriorated and he died 24 days after intracranial hematoma was reported(and 26 
days after head trauma). The event was considered by the investigator to be unrelated to the study 
drug 
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 
Overall, 16/64 patients (25%) reported a total of 25 SAEs during the core study period(4/16 [25%] in 
Group 1 and 12/48 [25%] in Group 2).

The most commonly affected SOCs (with > 5% of patients overall with SAEs) were Infections and 
infestations(8 patients overall [13%]), General disorders and administration site conditions (4patients 
overall [6%]), and Injury, poisoning and procedural complications (4 patients overall [6%]). 
SAEs  reported  in  more  than  1  patient  overall  included  device-related  infection  (3patients),  bronchitis 
(2),  thrombosis  in  device  (2),  arteriovenous  fistula  thrombosis  (2),  procedural  hemorrhage  (2),  fluid 
overload (2), and hypertension (2). 
Of  the  AEs  classified  as  serious,  two  were  considered  related  to  study  medication:  arteriovenous 
thrombosis and thrombosis in device.

ADVERSE EVENTS THAT LED TO WITHDRAWAL OF STUDYTREATMENT 
One patient died and did not complete study treatment during the core study period. No patients were 
withdrawn  from  study  treatment  due  toa  non-fatal  AE  in  either  study  period.  No  AEs  led  to  dose 
modification at any time during the study. 
SELECTED ADVERSE EVENTS 
Hypertension 
Core Study Period 
Overall, at baseline, 32 patients (50%) had hypertension reported by the investigator as a risk factor 
and 37 (58%) were already receiving or had received antihypertensive and/or diuretic agents. During 
the core study period, 8patients (13%) had an increase in antihypertensive treatment. 
Of the 8 patients with arterial hypertension reported as an AE during the core study period, 7 had pre-
existing hypertension at enrollment or within 12 weeks prior to enrollment, and 1 had previously 
received antihypertensive therapy although this patient was not reported to have hypertension at 
enrollment or within 12 weeks of enrollment. In 1 patient, the hypertension was reported as severe in 
intensity and as an SAE. The event resolved with treatment (doxazosin and carvedilol). One case of 
moderate hypertension was also reported as an SAE. 
Pre- and post-dialysis blood pressure measurements were performed in all patients during the study. 
Values remained close to baseline level, and no clear trend or difference between groups was apparent 
during the study. 
Safety Extension Period 
During the safety extension period, 9 patients (24%) had an increase in antihypertensive treatment 
There were 5 adverse events of hypertension reported during this period. One patient with 
hypertension in the safety extension period had already reported a hypertension event during the core 
period. In that patient, both events were considered serious and severe; an increase in 
antihypertensive treatment was reported after the second event. 
During the extension period, two patients reported hypertension as an SAE. In both cases, the event 
was associated with a change in antihypertensive medication. 
Vascular Access Thrombosis 
Core Study Period 
4 patients (3 in Group 2 and 1 in Group 1) reported 5events of vascular access thrombosis. 
These events were coded as ‘arteriovenous fistula thrombosis’ in 2 patients and ‘thrombosis in device’ 
in 2 patients (1 patient experienced 2 such events). 
For the patients with ‘thrombosis in device’ the verbatim investigator text was “central venous 
thrombosis in dialysis catheter” and “thrombosis in extracorporeal system for hemodialysis”.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/67470/2017 
Page 36/39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All cases were classified as SAEs. For 3 of the patients, the events were considered severe, and 2 
cases (one case of ‘arteriovenous fistula thrombosis’ and one case of‘ thrombosis in device’) were 
considered related to study medication. In all cases, the events resolved without sequelae. 
Safety Extension Period 
3 patients reported 5 events of vascular access thrombosis (different patients from those with such 
events during the core period). These were coded as ‘arteriovenous fistula thrombosis’ in 2 cases and 
‘thrombosis in device’ in 3 cases. 
Three of these events (two reports of `thrombosis in device’ in 1 patient and 1 report of 
`arteriovenous fistula thrombosis’ in another patient) were classified as SAEs. One of these events 
(`arteriovenous fistula thrombosis’) was also a severe AE. None of these events were considered 
related to study medication and all resolved without sequelae. 
Anti-Erythropoietin Antibody-Induced Pure Red Cell Aplasia 
No patients developed anti-drug antibodies or anti-erythropoietin antibodies during the study. 
LABORATORY PARAMETERS 
Hematology 
During the core study period, median Hct remained within 15% of baseline for both groups. Median 
RBC count remained within 13% and 8% of baseline for Group 1 and Group 2, respectively. Median 
platelet count remained within 16% and20% of baseline for Group 1 and Group 2, respectively. 
Median platelet count at baseline was 221.5 x 109/L (range 182-398) and 208.0 x 109/L(range 80-
518) in Group 1 and Group 2, respectively, and decreased slightly during the core study period in both 
groups. There was substantial within and between-patient variability of platelets in both groups. Shift 
tables for platelets during the core study period are shown in. In Group 1, 1/16 patients had one or 
more post-baseline values below the site-specific normal range (typically 150- 400 × 109/L). None had 
values above normal range. In Group 2, 19/47 patients had one or more post-baseline values below 
normal range, of whom 6/19 already had low value sat baseline, and 4/47 patients had one or more 
post-baseline values above normal range, of whom 1/4 already had a high value at baseline. During 
the extension period, platelet values below the site-specific normal range were reported in 2 patients 
(29%) in Group 1 and 15 patients (60%) in Group 2. No events of bleeding were reported in any 
patients in association with low platelet counts. Thrombocytopenia was reported as an AE in two 
patients; in both cases, the event was classified as mild. 
Hematocrit values during the safety extension period were similar to those in the core study period 
RBC counts were not determined during the safety extension period.  
2.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The study NH19707 was designed to provide evidence on the optimal dose of Mircera in the paediatric 
population with anaemia of CKD, following iv administration of MIRCERA to paediatric patients on 
haemodialysis. The study is part of the agreed PIP but while the PIP opinion states that children aged 2 
to less than 18 years should have been enrolled, this study enrolled only children aged 5 to less than 
18 years old. Therefore, the Applicant at the time of the type II variation should address how dosing 
for these children could be generated.  Furthermore, at the time of writing this assessment report, 
PDCO is discussing modification 02 of the PIP in which changes in the initially planned confirmatory 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/67470/2017 
Page 37/39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
study (see below) are being dealt with. The MAH does not longer intend to perform such a study but 
this is something that should be discussed with the PDCO as mentioned above.  
Study NH19707 is also a Post-Marketing Requirement agreed in 2007 with the FDA as per the 
Paediatric Research Equity Act. 
The NH19707 Study consists of a phase II, open-label, multicentre, dose finding study to determine 
the optimum starting dose of Mircera in children  aged 5-17 years old receiving haemodialysis who 
switched from other ESAs (epoetin alfa/beta or darbepoetin alfa). The duration of study were 20 
weeks, after 2 weeks of screening period, patients were given Mircera for 16 weeks of dose titration 
and continued 4 weeks more during the evaluation period. 
Two doses have been studied based on two different conversion factors. A total of 16 patients were 
given MirceraIV with a starting dose based on 4x previous weekly epoetin dose (IU) /250 or 4x 
previous weekly darbepoetin (μg) /1.1.  In the second group a total of 16 patients received a starting 
Mircera dose double that of group 1, it means  4x previous weekly epoetin dose (IU)/125 or 4x 
previous weekly darbepoetin alfa μg/0.55.  
Of the 112 screened patients, 64 were enrolled (16 initially in Group 1 and then 48 in Group 2, 
following a preliminary analysis of Group 1). 
Considering that the adjusted mean change in Hb from baseline to the evaluation period was  smaller 
in group 2 (-0.09 g/dl (95%IC: -0.45 to 0.26) than in the group 1 (-0.74 g/dl(95% IC -1.32 to -0.16), 
that the secondary variables also support a more stable  Hb level  in group 2 than in the group 1 and 
finally that less dose adjusted were needed in group 2, it is proposed this Group 2 conversion factor to 
be used as the recommended starting dose of Mircera for the maintenance treatment in children. 
However a detailed assessment of the study results is anticipated at the time of the variation 
application to expand the indication to the paediatric population on haemodialysis. A number of aspects 
would require clarification before supporting the proposed posology, particularly in the youngest group 
of patients (5-11 years old), given the limited data available. Furthermore, long-term data with the 
Group 2 starting dose are limited to 21 patients. There are some methodological issues that should be 
explained in order to uncertain the potential impact on the validity of study results, i.e. the substitution 
of patients who withdrew from the study. Finally the high variability in the dose of Mircera 
administrated throughout the core study period in order to achieve and keep the target of Hb level 
does not speak in favour of the selected starting dose and further discussion is foreseen on this 
matter. 
Given that a phase III confirmatory study initially planned is not considered feasible any longer in 
these paediatric populations, it is to be agreed at PDCO whether a different trial is still needed. 
Whatever the outcome is, the lack of confirmatory data makes it needed a more in depth discussion 
than the crude data presentation in order to support any changes in the SmPC.  
To this aim, the complete assessment of the population PK analysis can be key supportive evidence of 
the proposed conversion factor and may also help to clarify some of the identified uncertainties.  
Overall, the safety profile of Mircera in the paediatric population does not reveal any new signal. The 
vast majority of adverse events are already described in the SmPC of Mircera. However the frequencies 
of some adverse events appear to differ in children, which may well be due to the limitations of the 
safety database. Nevertheless, the need to include any particular information for this population in the 
SmPC will be decided following a careful review of the totality of the evidence available, without any 
restrictions based on arbitrary cut-off points (i.e. only AEs >2% or 5% of incidence).

CONCLUSION 
The Applicant has submitted the results of Study NH19707, an open-label, multidose study to 
determine the optimum starting dose of intravenous Mircera for the maintenance treatment of anaemia 
in paediatric patients with chronic kidney disease on haemodialysis and a population pharmacokinetic 
analysis of Mircera in the paediatric population. 
This submission has been done 6 months after the last patients achieved the last visit in accordance 
with Article 46 of the Regulation 1901/2006. 
The study results do not change the benefit risk balance for Mircera in the currently authorised 
conditions for use, which is limited to the adult population. Nevertheless, both the phase II study and 
the population PK analysis are considered of interest to conduct a formal benefit/risk evaluation for the 
use of Mircerain the paediatric population on haemodialysis. However, some aspects will require a deep 
evaluation and clarification from the MAH before a conclusion can be drawn.  
It is noted that modification M02 of the PIP is currently ongoing at PDCO with regards to the design of 
the remaining paediatric study in the agreed PIP opinion which is a randomized controlled, open-label, 
multi-centre, parallel group study to confirm the optimal starting dose of Mircera administered once a 
month iv or sc for the maintenance treatment of anaemia in paediatric patients with chronic kidney 
disease not on dialysis or paediatric patients on dialysis (PD and HD) who had been receiving a stable 
treatment with an approved erythropoiesis stimulating agent (NH19708). The MAH no longer intends 
to perform such a study. An alternative study design is being discussed with the PDCO for pre-dialysis 
and peritoneal dialysis patients. The conclusions of this article 46 assessment report have no impact in 
this and perhaps PDCO can take some advantage of the limitations seen in study NH19707 for their 
discussion.  
Mircera is available in pre-filled syringe with several concentration 167 µg/ml, 250µg/ml, 333µg/ml, 
500µg/ml, 667µg/ml, 833µg/ml, 100µg/ml, 133µg/ml, 200 µg/ml, 400µg/ml and 600 µg/ml. It is very 
likely that these formulations are also valid for children, as proposed by the MAH. However, the final 
acceptability will depend on the final decision on the recommended starting/maintenance dose for the 
paediatric population at the time of the variation application assessment. The risk for dosing errors 
with the current pre-filled syringes in children will need to be discussed.

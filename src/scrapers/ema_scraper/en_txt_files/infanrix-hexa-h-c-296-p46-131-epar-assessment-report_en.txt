2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-048 PRI: ‘ A phase IV, open-label, non-randomised, multicentre 
study to assess the immunogenicity and safety of Infanrix hexa administered as primary 
vaccination in healthy infants born to mothers given Boostrix during pregnancy or post-
delivery in 116945 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-047]. 
Description 
The study was a Phase IV, open-label, non-randomised, uncontrolled, multi-centre, multi-country 
study with 2 parallel groups to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of Infanrix hexa given in a 
primary schedule to all infants born to pregnant women who participated in study 116945 [DTPA 
(BOOSTRIX)-047], in which the mothers received a single dose of Boostrix either during pregnancy or 
immediately post-delivery. 
The study was initiated on January 22th 2016 and completed on March 7th 2018. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
1. Primary: 
• 
To assess the immunological response to Infanrix hexa in terms of seroprotection status for 
diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, poliovirus and Hib antigens, and in terms of vaccine response to 
the pertussis antigens, 1 month after the last dose of the primary vaccination in infants born to 
mothers vaccinated with Boostrix during pregnancy or immediately post-delivery. 
A seroprotected subject was a subject whose antibody concentration/titre was greater than or equal to 
the level defining clinical protection.  
A seropositive subject was a subject whose antibody concentration/titre was greater than or equal to 
the assay cut-off defined in the study. 
Vaccine response to the PT, FHA and PRN antigens, was defined as: 
- 
 Appearance of antibodies in subjects who were initially seronegative (i.e., with concentrations 
<cut-off value). 
-  At least maintenance of pre-vaccination antibody concentrations in subjects who were initially 
seropositive (i.e., with concentrations ≥cut-off value). 
2. Secondary:  
• 
To assess persistence of antibodies against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis antigens, before the 
first dose of Infanrix hexa in infants born to mothers vaccinated with Boostrix during pregnancy or 
immediately post-delivery. 
• 
To assess the immunological response to Infanrix hexa and Prevenar 13 in terms of antibody 
concentrations or titres against all antigens, 1 month* after the last dose of the primary 
vaccination in infants born to mothers vaccinated with Boostrix during pregnancy or immediately 
post-delivery. 
• 
To assess the immunological response to Infanrix hexa in terms of seropositivity rates against 
pertussis antigens, 1 month after the last dose of the primary vaccination in infants born to 
mothers vaccinated with Boostrix during pregnancy or immediately post-delivery. 
• 
To assess the safety and reactogenicity of Infanrix hexa and Prevenar 13 in terms of solicited and 
unsolicited adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs).

*In some countries/regions with an Infanrix hexa 3-dose vaccination schedule, Prevenar 13 could have 
been administered as 2-dose or 3-dose primary vaccination schedule (according to the routine national 
immunisation schedule). In such an instance, the evaluation was to be performed 1 month after the 
last Infanrix hexa dose regardless of Prevenar 13 vaccination. In the countries/regions with an Infanrix 
hexa 2-dose schedule, Prevenar 13 was co-administered at the same time as Infanrix hexa. 
Study design 
Phase IV, open-label, non-randomised, multi-centric, multi-country study conducted in Australia, 
Canada, Czechia, Finland, Italy and Spain, with 2 parallel groups. 
Subjects were to receive either 3 doses of Infanrix hexa co-administered with Prevenar 13 at 2, 4 and 
6 months or 2, 3 and 4 months (Figure 1), either 2 doses of Infanrix hexa co-administered with 
Prevenar 13 at 3 and 5 months or 2 and 4 months (Figure 2), depending on the immunisation schedule 
of the country. 
The intended duration of the study was approximately 3 months, per subject, for subjects vaccinated 
according to the 2 and 4, the 3 and 5 or the 2, 3 and 4 months schedule and approximately 5 months, 
per subject, for those vaccinated according to 2, 4 and 6 months schedule. 
Blood samples were to be drawn from all subjects at the indicated timepoints (Figure 1, Figure 2). 
An independent data monitoring committee was established to oversee the safety of subjects enrolled 
in the clinical study 116945 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-047] (pregnant women), 201330 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX-
048 PRI (infants) and 201334 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-049 BST 048].

Study population /Sample size 
Healthy infants as established by medical history and clinical examination, born to mothers who 
participated in study 116945 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-047] and who were at 6-14 weeks of age (including 6 
weeks and up to and including 14 weeks and 6 days of age) at the time of the first vaccination. Infants 
were divided in 2 groups in the study as follows: 
1. dTpa Group: This group consisted of infants born to mothers belonging to the dTpa group in study 
116945 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-047], who received a single dose of Boostrix during pregnancy and a dose 
of placebo immediately post-delivery. All subjects in this group received Infanrix hexa co-administered 
with Prevenar 13 according to the routine national immunisation schedule. 
2. Control Group: This group consisted of infants born to mothers belonging to the control group in 
study 116945 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-047], who received a single dose of placebo during pregnancy and a 
dose of Boostrix immediately post-delivery. All subjects in this group received Infanrix hexa co-
administered with Prevenar 13 according to the routine national immunisation schedule. 
The target was to enrol a maximum of 680 eligible subjects aged 6-14 weeks (approximately 340 
subjects in each group).

- Appearance of antibodies in subjects who were initially seronegative (i.e., with concentrations 
< assay cut-off value). 
- At least maintenance of pre-vaccination antibody concentrations in subjects who were initially 
seropositive (i.e., with concentrations ≥ assay cut-off value). 
The assay cut-off value was 2.693 IU/mL for anti-PT, 2.046 IU/mL for anti-FHA, and 2.187 
IU/mL for anti-PRN. 
2. Secondary endpoints: 
• 
Persistence of antibodies before the first dose of Infanrix hexa:  
Anti-D and anti-T seroprotection status, anti-PT, anti-FHA, anti-PRN seropositivity status and 
antibody concentrations. 
• 
Immunogenicity with respect to components of Infanrix hexa and Prevenar 13: 
Anti-D, anti-T, anti-poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3, anti-HBs, anti-PRP, anti-PT, anti-FHA, anti-PRN and 
anti-pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 23F) antibody 
concentrations or titres, 1 month after the last dose of primary vaccination. 
A concentration of immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide antibodies 
of ≥ 0.35 μg/mL measured by ELISA at 1 month after primary immunisation was recommended as 
the protective threshold and as the basis for licensing Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine. 
•

Anti-PT, anti-FHA, anti-PRN antibody seropositivity status, 1 month after the last dose of primary 
vaccination. 
•  Solicited local and general AEs: 
Occurrence of solicited local/general AEs during the 4-day (Days 0-3) follow-up period aftereach 
vaccination. 
•  Unsolicited AEs: 
Occurrence of unsolicited AEs during the 31-day (Days 0-30) follow-up period after each 
vaccination. 
•  All SAEs: 
Occurrence of SAEs from first vaccination dose to study end. 
Statistical Methods 
The primary analyses of immunogenicity were based on the according to protocol (ATP) cohort while 
the primary analyses of safety were based on the total vaccinated cohort (TVC). All analyses in this 
study were descriptive. 
Analysis of immunogenicity: 
For each group, antigens and at each timepoint, a blood sample result was available: 
•  Seropositivity rates and seroprotection rates were calculated with exact 95% CI. 
• 
• 
The geometric mean concentration/titre (GMC/GMT) with 95% CI was tabulated for antibodies 
against each antigen. 
The vaccine response rates to PT, FHA and PRN (with exact 95% CI) were calculated. 
Analysis of safety: 
• 
The percentage of doses and of subjects with at least 1 local AE (solicited or unsolicited), with at 
least 1 general AE (solicited or unsolicited) and with any AE (solicited or unsolicited) during the 4- 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the

day (Days 0-3) solicited follow-up period was tabulated with exact 95% CI after each vaccine dose 
and overall. The same calculations were done for AEs (solicited or unsolicited) rated as grade 3 in 
intensity, for symptoms (solicited or unsolicited) leading to medical advice and for symptoms 
(solicited or unsolicited) assessed as causally related to vaccination. 
• 
The percentage of doses and of subjects reporting each individual solicited local and general AE 
during the 4-day (Days 0-3) solicited follow-up period was tabulated after each vaccine dose and 
overall, with exact 95% CI. The same calculations were done for each individual solicited AE rated 
as grade 3 in intensity and for each individual solicited symptom assessed as causally related to 
vaccination. 
•  All computations mentioned above were done for grade ≥2 (solicited AEs only) and grade 3 AEs, 
for AEs considered related to vaccination (general AEs only), for grade 3 AEs considered related to 
vaccination (general AEs only) and for AEs that resulted in a medically attended visit. 
•  Occurrence of fever and related fever were reported per 0.5°C cumulative temperature increments 
as well as the occurrence of grade 3 fever (>39.0°C axillary temperature) with causal relationship 
to vaccination. 
• 
The verbatim reports of unsolicited AEs were reviewed by a physician and the signs and symptoms 
were coded according to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Every verbatim 
term was matched with the appropriate Preferred Term. The percentage of subjects with 
unsolicited AEs occurring within 31-day (Days 0-30) follow-up period after any dose with its exact 
95% CI was tabulated by group, and by Preferred Term. Similar tabulation was done for unsolicited 
AEs rated as grade 3, for unsolicited AEs with causal relationship to vaccination and AEs/SAEs 
leading to withdrawal from the study. 
• 
The percentage of subjects who received concomitant medication and antipyretic medication during 
the 4-day (Days 0-3) follow-up period and the 31-day (Days 0-30) follow-up were tabulated (with 
exact 95% CI) after each vaccine dose and overall. 
•  All SAEs reported from first vaccination dose up to study end were described in detail. 
Assessor’s comment 
Methods are overall acceptable. 
Primary and secondary objectives and endpoints are relevant. The seroprotection thresholds proposed 
as associated with clinical protection against diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis,  
Haemophilus influenzae type b and Streptococcus pneumoniae infections are appropriate. The 
definition of vaccine response to pertussis antigens is acknowledged and further discussed in the 
results’ section. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 601 subjects fulfilled the criteria to participate in this follow-up study of DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-
047. These subjects were vaccinated with the study vaccines and comprised the TVC. Of the 601 
subjects, 9 subjects were withdrawn from the study mainly because of migration/moving from study 
area (n=4) and consent withdrawal (n=3). Hence, 592 subjects comprised the ATP cohort for safety.

Further, a total of 50 subjects were withdrawn from the ATP cohort for safety, leaving 542 subjects 
evaluable for the ATP cohort for immunogenicity (Table 3). 
Table 3. Number of subjects enrolled into the study as well as excluded from ATP 
analysis with reasons for exclusion (All enrolled subjects) 
Assessor’s comment 
Similar proportion of subjects were withdrawn from the ATP cohort for safety and for immunogenicity 
in both groups. ATP cohort for safety consists of 98.3 and 98.7% of the total vaccinated cohort for 
dTpa and control groups, respectively. ATP cohort for immunogenicity consists of 90.5 and 89.8% of 
the total vaccinated cohort for dTpa and control groups, respectively. This is acceptable. 
Baseline data 
The demographic characteristics for the TVC is presented in Table 4. 
Overall for both the groups, the average age of subjects was 8.8 months (±1.7). Of the 601 subjects, 
47.4% were females, 92% belonged to the white Caucasian/European heritage. A total of 12.1% of 
subjects were given a 2-dose schedule, while majority of the subjects (87.9%) received the study

vaccines as a 3-dose schedule. More than 50% of the subjects’ mothers received Boostrix during 27-32 
gestational weeks of the foetus.  
The demographic characteristics of the ATP cohort for immunogenicity were similar to the TVC.

Efficacy results 
1.  Immune responses to Diphtheria and Tetanus toxoids (Table 5, Table 6):  
•  At 1 month after the subjects received last dose of Infanrix hexa, the percentage of subjects 
seroprotected against diphtheria and tetanus (anti-D and anti-T antibody concentrations ≥0.1 
IU/mL) was 100% in both groups (Primary objective). 
•  Before the first dose of Infanrix hexa primary vaccination, the maternal antibodies against 
diphtheria and tetanus were found to be persistent in the subjects and it was observed that 
subjects in dTpa group had higher antibody concentrations when compared to the subjects in 
control group. 
•  At 1 month after the subjects received the last dose of Infanrix hexa, all subjects in the dTpa 
group presented lower anti-D GMCs when compared to the control group. Consequently,  the 
percentage of subjects that was ≥ 1.0 IU/ml was lower in the dTpa group when compared to 
the control group. 
There was no significant difference observed in the GMC values for anti-T in both study groups. 
•  At 1 month after the subjects received the last dose of Infanrix hexa, the percentage of 
subjects that had anti-D ≥ 1.0 IU/ml was lower for infants that received the study vaccines as 
a 2-dose schedule when compared to the infants that received the study vaccines as a 3-dose 
schedule. This difference was more important in the dTpa group. Nevertheless, the percentage 
of subjects seroprotected against diphtheria was 100%, whatever the vaccine regimen. 
The percentage of subjects that had anti-T ≥ 1.0 IU/ml was lower for infants that received the 
study vaccines as a 2-dose schedule when compared to the infants that received the study 
vaccines as a 3-dose schedule, but to a less extend than for the anti-D Ab. No difference was 
observed between dTpa and control groups. The percentage of subjects seroprotected against 
tetanus was 100%, whatever the vaccine regimen. 
•  Maternal age and gestational week of foetus at dose 1 in maternal study did not interfere with 
the diphtheria and tetanus responses.

Assessor’s comment 
All subjects were seroprotected (cut-off ≥ 0.1 IU/ml) against diphtheria and tetanus 1 month after 
primary vaccination with Infanrix hexa, independently of the time of vaccination of the mother, 
maternal age and dose schedule of infant’s vaccination.  
As expected, higher percentages of infants born from mothers vaccinated during pregnancy were 
seroprotected before the primary vaccination (dTpa group) when compared to the infants born from 
mothers vaccinated post-delivery (control group). These higher percentages were also observed when 
considering the threshold associated with long term protection (≥ 1.0 IU/ml, for both anti-D and anti-T 
Ab). This is reflected by the difference in GMT between both groups.   
Percentages of infants achieving the cut-off of ≥ 1.0 IU/ml anti-T Ab and anti-T GMT post-primary 
vaccination were similar between groups. This was not the case for the immune response to diphtheria 
toxoid. A trend for lower percentage of infants achieving the cut-off of ≥ 1.0 IU/ml anti-D Ab and lower 
anti-D GMT were observed in the dTpa group when compared to the control group. This trend was 
more marked for infants receiving the primary vaccination in a 2-dose schedule when compared to 
those receiving a 3-dose schedule. Whether this can be due to the infant’s pre-vaccination status and 
therefore a blunting of the infant’s immune response due to mothers’ vaccination during pregnancy is 
not known. 
Overall, lower percentages of infants achieving the cut-off of ≥ 1.0 IU/ml anti-D and anti-T Ab were 
observed after a 2-dose schedule compared to a 3-dose schedule. However, 100% of the infants were 
seroprotected against diphtheria and tetanus, whatever the dose regimen. In addition, as discussed 
during the scientific advice conducted in June 2019, the small sample size for the 2-dose schedule does 
not allow to draw meaningful conclusions from the comparison between the two schedules, as the 
analysis is not powered to generate statistically significant results.  
2.  Immune response to HBs antigen (Table 7):  
•  At 1 month after the subjects received the last dose of Infanrix hexa, the percentage of 
subjects seroprotected against hepatitis B (anti-HBs antibody concentration ≥10 mIU/mL) was 
>98% of subjects in both groups (Primary objective).  
•  At 1 month after the subjects received the last dose of Infanrix hexa, there was no significant 
difference observed in the GMC values for anti-HBs in both groups. The percentages of subjects 
achieving anti-HBs Ab titers ≥100 mIU/mL were similar between groups. 
•  Maternal age and gestational week of foetus at dose 1 in maternal study did not interfere with 
anti-HBs Ab level 1 month post-primary vaccination. 
•  Vaccine regimen (2 vs 3 doses) did not interfere with anti-HBs Ab level observed 1 month 
post-primary vaccination.

of the primary vaccination (ATP cohort for immunogenicity) 
Assessor’s comment 
Percentages of infants that were seroprotected (cut-off ≥ 10 mIU/ml) against Hepatitis B 1 month after 
primary vaccination with Infanrix hexa were high, independent of the time of vaccination of the 
mother, the mother’s maternal age and the dose schedule of infant’s vaccination. Percentages of 
subjects mounting an Ab response ≥ 100 mIU/ml and GMT were similar between groups suggesting 
that maternal immunization does not interfere with the infant’s vaccine induced-protection against 
Hepatitis B. 
3.  Immune responses to poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 (Table 8 and Table 9): 
•  At 1 month after the subjects received the last dose of Infanrix hexa, the percentage of 
subjects seroprotected against poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 (anti-poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 
antibody titres ≥8 ED50) was >95% of subjects in both groups (primary objective). 
•  At 1 month after the subjects received the last dose of Infanrix hexa, there was no significant 
difference observed in the GMT values for anti-poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 in both groups. 
•  Maternal age and gestational week of foetus at dose 1 in maternal study did not interfere with 
for anti-poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 Ab level observed 1 month post-primary vaccination. 
•  At 1 month post-primary vaccination,  a trend for lower anti-poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 GMT 
was observed in 2-dose schedule vaccine recipients compared to the infants that received the 
study vaccines according to a 3-dose schedule. Consequently, slightly lower percentages of 
infants seroprotected against poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 were observed (with larger 95% CI).

Assessor’s comment 
Percentages of infants that were seroprotected (cut-off ≥ 8 ED50) against poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3  
1 month after primary vaccination with Infanrix hexa were high, independent of the time of vaccination 
of the mother and the mother’s maternal age (at least for 25-34y and 35-45y sb-groups, no 
interpretation possible for 18-24y sub-group since n= 6). 
No meaningful conclusions can be drawn on the difference of GMT and percentage of seroprotected 
infants between 2- and 3-dose vaccines regimen.

• 
The percentage of subjects seroprotected against Hib (anti-PRP antibody concentration ≥0.15 
μg/mL) was >94% of subjects in both groups (primary objective). 
•  At 1 month after the subjects received the last dose of Infanrix hexa, there was no significant 
difference observed in the GMC values for anti-PRP in both groups. 
•  Maternal age and gestational week of foetus at dose 1 in maternal study did not interfere with 
for anti-Hib Ab level observed 1 month post-primary vaccination. 
•  At 1 month after the subjects received the last dose of Infanrix hexa, a trend for lower anti-Hib 
GMT was observed in the 2-dose schedule vaccine recipients compared to the infants that 
received the study vaccines according to a 3-dose schedule. Consequently, slightly lower 
percentages of infants seroprotected against Haemophilus influenzae type b were observed.

Assessor’s comment 
Percentages of infants that were seroprotected (cut-off ≥ 0.15 µg/ml) against Haemophilus influenzae 
type b 1 month after primary vaccination with Infanrix hexa were high, independent of the time of 
vaccination of the mother and the mother’s maternal age (at least for 25-34y and 35-45y sub-groups, 
no interpretation possible for 18-24y sub-group since n= 5-7). 
No meaningful conclusions can be drawn on the difference of GMT and percentage of seroprotected 
infants between 2- and 3-dose vaccines regimen (small sample size). 
5.  Immune responses to Bordetella pertussis antigens (PT, FHA, PRN) (Table 13 and Table 13): 
• 
The vaccine response rate observed in dTpa group was 77.1% for anti-PT, 39.6% for anti-FHA 
and 37.5% for anti-PRN. The vaccine response rate observed in control group was 99.2% for 
anti-PT, 94.8% for anti-FHA and 90% for anti-PRN (primary objective). 
•  Before the first dose of Infanrix hexa primary vaccination, the maternal antibodies against 
pertussis antigens were found to be persistent in the subjects and it was observed that 
subjects in dTpa group had higher antibody concentrations when compared to the subjects in 
control group. In the dTpa group, >90% of subjects had anti-pertussis antibodies greater than 
or equal to the assay cut-off whereas ≤83% of subjects had anti-pertussis antibodies greater 
than or equal to the assay cut-off in the control group. Pre-vaccination GMC were always 
higher in the dTpa group. 
•  Overall, at 1 month after the subjects received the last dose of Infanrix hexa, all subjects in 
dTpa group developed anti-pertussis Ab above or equal to the assay cut-off but presented 
lower GMC values when compared to control group. 
•  Vaccine schedule (2 versus 3 doses) did not interfere with the percentages of subjects that 
mount Ab titers above or equal to the assay cut-off. However, GMC were always lower for 
subjects vaccinated with a 2-dose regimen when compared to those vaccinated with a 3-dose 
regimen. 
•  At 1 month post-primary vaccination, maternal age did not interfere with anti -PT, -FHA and -
PRN Ab level. A trend for lower anti-PRN GMC in the 25-34y sub-group compared to 35-45y 
sub-group in the dTap group was however observed.  
•  At 1 month post-primary vaccination, gestational week of foetus at dose 1 in maternal study 
did not interfere with anti -PT, -FHA and -PRN Ab level. A trend for lower anti-FHA GMC in the 
27-32W sub-group compared to 33-36W sub-group in the dTap group was however observed.

Assessor’s comment 
Results and interpretation of immune responses to pertussis antigens were recently shared and 
discussed with the Belgian and the German Regulatory Authorities during a Scientific-Technical Advice 
meeting that took place on 3 June 2019.  
It was agreed with the Company that the vaccine seroresponse rate could be underestimated for 
infants born from dTpa vaccinated mothers compared to the group of infants born from unvaccinated 
mothers. Post-hoc analysis were presented during the scientific advice to support the hypothesis that 
the pertussis vaccine response elicited by primary vaccination is masked by the persistence of 
antibodies acquired through maternal immunisation (also presented in the cover statement document).  
A more appropriate way (than seroresponse rate) to study a potential effect of maternal immunization 
(MI) on infant’s vaccination is to compare the GMC induced by the primary vaccination in the dTpa and 
in the control groups. As such, lower GMC were observed for anti-PT, anti-FHA and anti-PRN antibodies 
in the dTPa group. 95% CI were not overlapping for all three antigens. These findings clearly 
demonstrate a blunting effect of the MI on infant vaccine-induced antibody responses. 
Findings of the study BOOSTRIX-048 are in line with those of other studies that have assessed the 
persistence of the blunting of pertussis response after the primary and the booster vaccination 
administered around 12 months of age (Hardy-Fairbanks 2013, Munoz 2014, Maertens 2016, Halperin 
2018, Barug 2019). Overall, all these publications show a trend for lower GMC of pertussis antigens-
specific Ab in infants born from dTap vaccinated mothers during the pregnancy compare to 
unvaccinated or post-partum vaccinated mothers. This is true for post-primary vaccination and post-
boost vaccination. The blunting of the majority of the antigen-specific Ab responses observed post-
primary vaccination was still observed post-boost. None of these studies have assessed the vaccine 
efficacy of MI in protecting infants from pertussis disease in parallel.

Several studies assess the vaccine efficacy/effectiveness (VE) of MI in preventing pertussis in young 
infants. Overall, MI does protect infants from pertussis disease before primary vaccination 
(Amirthalingam, Baxter, Becker-Dreps, Bellido-Belasco, Marshall - communication in the 12th 
international symposium on Bordetella). Although the duration of the (additional) protection of MI 
varies across studies, no deleterious effect of MI was evidenced during and/or shortly after the primary 
vaccination (up to 5-6 months of age). 
Nevertheless, in the absence of correlate of protection (CoP), the observed blunting of the pertussis 
response is difficult to interpret in term of clinical relevance. 
As for the immune response to other vaccine antigens, the small sample size for the 2-dose schedule 
does not allow to draw meaningful conclusions from the comparison between the two schedules, as the 
analysis is not powered to generate statistically significant results. Influence of maternal age and 
gestational week of foetus at dose 1 in maternal study on the infant’s vaccine-induced response should 
be confirmed in larger studies before to drawn any conclusion. 
6.  Immune responses to Prevenar 13 (Table 14): 
•  Overall, at 1 month after the subjects received the last dose of Prevenar 13, all subjects in 
both groups developed anti-pneumococcal (anti-PnPS) antibodies for serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 
6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F. In both groups, >92% of subjects presented 
antibodies above or equal to the assay cut-off and >74% of subjects presented antibodies 
≥0.35 µg/mL. However a trend for lower SPR is observed for 5 out of 13 serotypes (4, 5, 6B, 
9V and 23F). GMTs induced in dTap group are generally slightly lower than those induced in 
the control group. 
•  Overall, maternal age and gestational week of foetus at dose 1 in maternal study did not 
interfere with anti-PnPS Ab level. The sample size was small for the maternal age 18-24y sub-
group 
•  Vaccine regimen (2 vs 3 doses) did not interfere with anti-PnPS Ab level. Sample size was 
small for the 2-dose schedule sub-group.

Assessor’s comment 
A trend for higher GMC of Ab specific to most of the serotypes was observed for the control group 
compared to the dTpa group. However, percentages of subjects achieving the cut-off of 0.35 µg/ml, 
considered as the protective threshold, were generally high but were slightly lower for 5 out of 13 
serotypes. Percentage of subjects achieving anti-PnPS3 Ab ≥0.35 µg/ml were the lowest (74.6 and 
76.4%) and were lower than the one presented in the SmPC of Prevenar 13 (98.2%). Whether this is 
due to the study population or the infanrix hexa co-administration should be clarified. 
Safety results 
1.  During the 4-day (Days 0-3) period following each Infanrix hexa primary vaccination co-
administered with Prevenar 13 (overall/subject): 
•  Any AE: The overall incidence of at least 1 AE (solicited/unsolicited) reported for subjects was 98% 
and 95.4% in dTpa group and control group, respectively. 
•  Solicited local AE: 
o  The most frequently reported local AE solicited for Infanrix hexa primary vaccination was 
redness and was reported in 62.9% and 61.1% of subjects dTpa group and control group, 
respectively. 
o  The most frequently reported local AE solicited for Prevenar 13 was redness and was 
reported in 55.6% and 56.1% of subjects in dTpa group and control group, respectively.

•  Grade 3 solicited local AE: 
o  The most commonly reported grade 3 local AEs solicited for Infanrix hexa primary 
vaccination in dTpa group was redness, reported in 3.4% of subjects and in control group 
was redness and pain reported in 4.6% of subjects, respectively. 
o  The most commonly reported grade 3 local AEs solicited for Prevenar 13 in dTpa group was 
pain, reported in 3.1% of subjects and in control group was swelling, reported in 3.6% of 
subjects, respectively. 
•  Solicited general AE: The most frequently reported solicited general AE was irritability/fussiness 
and was reported for 86.7% and 84.8% of subjects in dTpa group and control group, respectively. 
•  Grade 3 solicited general AE: Irritability/fussiness was also the most frequently reported grade 3 
solicited general AE and was reported for 12.2% of subjects in both groups. 
2.  During the 31-day (Days 0-30) period following each Infanrix hexa primary vaccination co-
administered with Prevenar 13 (overall/subject): 
•  Unsolicited AEs: Overall, at least 1 unsolicited AE was reported for 54.4% and 56.7% of 
subjects in dTpa group and control group, respectively. Of which, most commonly reported AE 
was upper respiratory tract infection reported in 12.2% and 10.8% of subjects in dTpa group 
and control group, respectively. 
•  Grade 3 unsolicited AEs: At least 1 grade 3 unsolicited AE was reported for 5.1% and 5.9% of 
subjects in dTpa group and control group, respectively. Of which, most common AEs that were 
reported per group were teething in dTpa group (1.4%) and pyrexia in control group (1.0%). 
•  Causally related unsolicited AEs: At least 1 causally related unsolicited AE was reported for 
3.7% and 4.3% of subjects in dTpa group and control group, respectively. Of which, most 
common AEs that were reported per group were vomiting and mass at the injection site in 
dTpa group (1%); bruise at the injection site and increase in body temperature in control 
group (0.7%). 
•  Grade 3 causally related unsolicited AEs: There were no grade 3 causally related unsolicited 
AEs reported during the study period. 
3.  Throughout the study period: 
•  SAEs: There were no fatal cases reported in this study. At least 1 SAE was reported for 2.4% 
of subjects in the dTpa group and for 5.6% of subjects in the control group, respectively. There 
were no SAEs reported with causal association to vaccination. 
•  Withdrawals due to AEs/SAEs: A single subject in the dTpa group was withdrawn from the 
study after Visit 1 due to the SAEs – intestinal hemorrhage and cow’s milk allergy. The 
investigator however, considered that there was no reasonable possibility that intestinal 
hemorrhage and cow's milk allergy may have been caused by the vaccination. 
Assessor’s comment 
Infanrix hexa and Prevenar 13 were well tolerated. Overall, Infanrix hexa induces a slightly higher 
number of solicited local AE.  
The safety profile of the Infanrix hexa and Prevenar 13 co-administration is acceptable and similar 
between groups.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The study was a Phase IV, open-label, non-randomised, uncontrolled, multi-centre, multi-country 
study to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of Infanrix hexa given in a primary schedule to all 
infants born to pregnant women who participated in study BOOSTRIX-047, in which the mothers 
received a single dose of Boostrix either during pregnancy (dTpa group) or immediately post-delivery 
(control group). Infanrix hexa was administered with Prevenar 13 in a 2- or 3- dose schedule according 
to the country of enrolment. 
The study is part of a clinical data generation plan consisting of 3 studies that document the maternal 
vaccination during the third trimester of pregnancy with Boostrix (BOOSTRIX-047), and the impact 
thereof on the response to the infant primary vaccination (BOOSTRIX-048) and toddler booster 
vaccination (BOOSTRIX-049). Clinical data of BOOSTRIX-049 study will be available in January 2020. 
Clinical protection against diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis, Haemophilus influenzae type b 
and Streptococcus pneumoniae infections were defined by their serological correlates of protection. 
The seroprotection thresholds were ≥0.1 IU/mL for anti-D and anti-T antibody concentrations, ≥10 
mIU/mL for anti-HBs antibody concentrations, ≥8 ED50 for anti-poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 antibody 
titres, ≥0.15 μg/mL for anti-PRP antibody concentrations and ≥ 0.35 µg/mL for anti-PnPS Ab 
concentrations. 
At 1 month after the last dose of Infanrix hexa, 100% of the subjects of both groups were 
seroprotected against diphtheria and tetanus, >98% against Hepatitis B, >95% against poliovirus type 
1, 2 and 3, and >94% against Haemophilus influenzae type b infections. The percentages of subjects 
achieving the protective threshold of 0.35 µg/ml against Streptococcus pneumoniae infection were 
generally high (ranging from 74.6% to 99.6%). 
A trend for a lower percentage of infants achieving the cut-off associated with long term protection 
against diphteria (≥ 1.0 IU/ml anti-D Ab) and lower anti-D GMT were however observed in the dTpa 
group when compared to the control group. This suggests that MI might affect the induction of the 
immune memory. However, data from study BOOSTRIX-049 that were further presented suggest that 
the generation of immune memory in both groups is adequate. The decreased GMC would not imply an 
impact on clinical protection since all the subjects achieved the cut-off associated with short term 
protection (≥ 1.0 IU/ml) and >99% of the toddlers achieved the cut-off associated with long term 
protection (≥ 1.0 IU/ml). Additionally, regular booster vaccinations are generally recommended. 
Similarly, a trend for lower GMC of Ab specific to most of the serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae 
was observed for the dTpa group compared to the control group, both at post-primary and post-
booster vaccination timepoints. The lower percentages of subjects achieving the cut-off of 0.35 µg/ml 
observed in the dTap group for 5 out 13 serotypes when compared to the control group post-primary 
vaccination was not observed anymore post-boost. Indeed, study BOOSTRIX-049 results demonstrate 
that comparable percentage of subjects had Ab titers ≥ 0.35 µg/ml 1 month post-boost in both groups, 
suggesting that the subjects of both groups are comparatively able to mount an anamnestic response. 
Thus, the observed (slight) interference of MI on infant’s Ab concentration post-primary and post-
booster vaccination is not likely to be clinically relevant.  
Maternal age and gestational week of foetus at dose 1 in maternal study generally did not interfere 
with vaccines-induced seroprotection. Conversely, the 2-dose regimen generally induced lower 
GMT/GMC with the exception of anti-Hbs Ab concentration that were comparable between both 
regimens. However, the small sample size for the 2-dose schedule does not allow to draw meaningful 
conclusions from the comparison between the two schedules, as the analysis is not powered to 
generate statistically significant results.

Results and interpretation of immune responses to pertussis antigens are more difficult to interpret 
since there is currently no correlate of vaccine protection. Results were already shared and discussed 
with the Belgian and the German Regulatory Authorities during a Scientific-Technical Advice meeting 
(June 2019). Criteria defining seroresponse were not ideal, particularly for infants with high level of 
specific Ab pre-vaccination. Comparison of GMC induced by the primary vaccination between both the 
dTpa and the control groups is more relevant. Lower GMC were observed for anti-PT, anti-FHA and 
anti-PRN antibodies in the dTPa group. 95% CI were not overlapping for all three antigens. Even if MI 
doesn’t prevent the infants from developing a response to the primary vaccination, these findings 
clearly demonstrate a blunting effect of the MI on infant vaccine-induced antibody responses. One 
month post-booster vaccination, lower GMC were still observed for anti-PT and anti-FHA antibodies in 
the dTPa group (BOOSTRIX-049 study) when compared to the control group. The data also suggest 
that infants of both groups developed an immune memory against B. pertussis. Longer-term memory 
responses still need to be investigated. The results observed in both studies are in line with those 
found in the literature.  
Of note, the entire results of the BOOSTRIX-049 study will be submitted in January 2020 and assessed 
at that time. 
Several observational studies indicate effectiveness of the MI strategy in protecting neonates of <2-3 
months of age against pertussis disease. Both effectiveness studies and UK epidemiological data 
suggest that there is no deleterious effect of MI during and/or shortly after the infant’s vaccination. 
However, in the absence of CoP, it is difficult to estimate the clinical relevance of the blunting of 
pertussis responses and the ‘real’ (long-term) impact of MI for the infants. At present, the Infanrix 
hexa SmPC does not contain any information about the blunting effect observed when a child born to a 
vaccinated mother receives a primo-vaccination with Infanrix hexa. The VWP considered that it could 
be appropriate to add a subsection in section 5.1 of the SmPC for Infanrix hexa under a heading of 
Infant immune responses following maternal immunisation (or similar). The section could shortly 
describe the observed effect on infant GMCs for pertussis antigens. However, the VWP recommended 
to postpone such SmPC revision until the final data from the booster study BOOSTRIX-049 are 
submitted for assessment, at which time the overall dataset will be available. 
Influence of maternal age, gestational week of foetus at dose 1 in maternal study and dose schedule 
on the infant’s pertussis-induced response should be confirmed in larger studies before to draw any 
conclusion.  
Finally, both vaccines were generally well tolerated. The safety profile was similar whatever the time of 
mother’s vaccination (during or post-pregnancy). An update of the section 4.8 would be proposed by 
the Company as part of a variation in March 2020. 
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
In the present study, infants born from mother either vaccinated during pregnancy (dTpa group) or 
post-delivery (control group) were vaccinated with Infanrix hexa and Prevenar 13 (according to a 2- or 
3-dose schedule).  
Immunogenicity results demonstrated that maternal immunization (MI) does not interfere with the 
vaccine-induced (short term) seroprotection against diphtheria, tetanus, Hepatitis B, poliovirus type 1, 
2 and 3, Haemophilus influenzae type b and, in some extent, Streptococcus pneumoniae. 
A slight blunting effect was however observed for diphtheria and Streptococcus pneumoniae induced-
immune responses post-primary and post-booster vaccination (in terms of GMT). However, 1 month 
after the booster dose, >99% of the subjects of dTpa group achieved the anti-D Ab threshold

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

associated with long-term protection and comparable percentage of subjects had anti-PnPs Ab titers ≥ 
0.35 µg/ml in both groups. It is thus unlikely that the observed interference is clinically relevant. 
In line with the literature, a blunting effect of the MI on infant vaccine-induced pertussis antibody 
responses was also observed (at both post-primary and post-booster vaccination timepoints). 
Currently, limited surveillance data of UK (2017 and 2018) does not suggest an increase in pertussis 
incidence due to MI in young children. In the absence of CoP, it is however difficult to estimate the 
clinical relevance of this blunting of pertussis responses and the ‘real’ (long-term) impact of MI for the 
infants.  
At present, the Infanrix hexa SmPC does not contain any information about the blunting effect 
observed when a child born to a vaccinated mother receives primo-vaccination with Infanrix hexa. For 
the sake of transparency, it could be appropriate to add a subsection in section 5.1 of the SmPC for 
Infanrix hexa. The section could shortly describe the observed effect on infant GMCs for pertussis 
antigens. Such SmPC revision should be postponed until the final data from the booster study 
BOOSTRIX-049 are submitted for assessment, at which time the overall dataset will be available. 
Both vaccines were generally well tolerated. The safety profile was similar whatever the time of 
mother’s vaccination (during or post-pregnancy).  
The longer-term data will be submitted the 10th of January 2020 (BOOSTRIX-049 study). The Company 
committed to submit a variation in March 2020 in which the outcome of the three maternal vaccination 
studies dTpa-047, -048 and -049 will be discussed. A draft label update will be proposed as part of this 
variation. 
  Fulfilled: 
The MAH provided the requested clarifications. The VWP recommendations were included in the report. 
4.  Additional clarification requested to the MAH 
1.  The MAH is invited to clarify whether the lower percentage of subjects achieving anti-PnPS3 Ab 
≥0.35 µg/ml (74.6 and 76.4%) in study BOOSTRIX-048 when compared to the percentage 
presented in the SmPC of Prevenar 13 (98.2%) is due to the study population or the Infanrix 
hexa co-administration. 
2.  In principle the risk of blunting of infants’ pertussis, diphtheria and Streptococcus pneumoniae 
responses should be added in the SmPC of Infanrix-hexa in the section 4.4. The MAH should 
discuss a proposal. 
3.  Further data would be useful in the context of a variation before any conclusion on product 
information amendments is made. Immunogenicity data of the studies BOOSTRIX-048 and 
BOOSTRIX-049 should be added in section 5.1 of the SmPC, upon assessment. An update of 
the section 4.8 with the safety data of both studies is also required. It is understood from 
previous scientific advices that the MAH commits to submit the data from studies 047, 048 and 
049 as variations to the MA in 2020. The MAH should discuss their plans to submit any data in 
the near future.

MS comments 
Comments were received from MS1 and MS2.  
MS1 agrees with the Rapporteur’s assessment and conclusions of the Rapporteur are endorsed. It is 
agreed with the Rapporteur that the observed data, including the blunting effect of the MI on infant 
vaccine-induced pertussis antibody responses should be presented in the SmPC. 
MS2 does not endorse the CHMP Rapp AR and recommends the critical issue of adding a comment to 
the SPC on maternal immunisation blunting antibody responses in infants is referred to the Vaccine 
Working Group. 
In the comparative assessment of rates of seroprotective antibody (Ab) or vaccine responses the lower 
limit (LL) of the 95% confidence interval (CI) is preferred.  
High rates of seroprotection or vaccine response are achieved for each component of Infanrix hexa 
after primary vaccination with evidence of higher rates with 3 vs 2 dose schedule of primary 
vaccination for example for Diphtheria, Tetanus, Polio & Hib.  
Maternal immunisation with Boostrix is associated with blunting of the Ab response in infants to 
specific homologous Pertussis (vaccine responses & GMCs) & Diphtheria antigens (GMCs), and 
heterologous Polio (lower GMTs for 2 of 3 polio viruses) & Pneumococcal (seroprotection rates [5 of 13 
serotypes show >/= 4% point lower rates of Ab >/=0.35 μg/mL] & lower GMCs for 13/13 serotypes) 
vaccine antigens. 
The association of maternal immunisation with Boostrix or TdaP in pregnancy with blunting of Ab 
responses in infants is reported for specific matching vaccine antigens, and potential mechanisms are 
being explored although the clinical relevance of this phenomenon is unclear (Vono et al 2019 
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2019.07.047).  
More controversially, blunting of Ab responses to heterologous vaccine antigens (polio and 
pneumococcal) as well as specific homologous (diphtheria and pertussis) vaccine responses is also 
reported in a recent small study by Zimmermann 2019,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2019.06.010). 
Neither the potential mechanism nor clinical relevance of this observation is clear.   
The MS2 does not support the Rapp’s proposal to include a comment like the statement in Boostrix / 
Boostrix-IPV, shown for reference in brackets below: 
(SmPC Section 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Limited data indicate that maternal antibodies may reduce the magnitude of the immune response to 
some vaccines in infants born from mothers vaccinated with Boostrix [-IPV] during pregnancy. The 
clinical relevance of this observation is unknown.) 
The MS2 suggests that the Rapp’s proposal has wide implications for the vaccination of infants and 
their mothers with potential relevance to many vaccines. Therefore, this issue should be referred to the 
Vaccine Working Group for discussion before a precedent is established. 
Rapporteur’s position 
The position of MS2 is acknowledged. The issue on the blunting effect of various antigen immune 
responses following maternal immunization has indeed wide implication. The issue will therefore be 
referred to the VWP. The AR was updated according to the comment received.

Proposed Questions to the VWP:  
Maternal immunization (MI) with Boostrix is associated with blunting of immune responses to 
homologous antigens (pertussis antigens and diphteria toxoid) and to some extent, to heterologous 
antigens (pneumococcal antigens). The clinical relevance of this observation is unknown. 
Does the VWP agree with this association between MI with Boostrix and blunting of (i) homologous and 
(ii) heterologous antigens-induced immune responses in infants? 
Does the VWP consider that the blunting of specific immune responses is linked to a specific vaccine or 
to a class product effect? 
Does the VWP consider that this blunting effect should be reflected in the Infanrix SmPC? Could a 
wording be proposed? 
Does the VWP consider that the unknown clinical relevance of the blunted immune responses in infants 
needs to be further studied by the MAH and how? 
Does the VWP has any other comments with regards to the data assessed in this procedure?

MAH responses to Request for supplementary information 
1.  The MAH is invited to clarify whether the lower percentage of subjects achieving anti-
PnPS3 Ab ≥0.35 µg/ml (74.6 and 76.4%) in study BOOSTRIX-048 when compared to the 
percentage presented in the SmPC of Prevenar 13 (98.2%) is due to the study 
population or the Infanrix hexa co-administration. 
The Company presented the results of the response to pneumococcal serotype 3 observed in the 
toddlers included in the BOOSTRIX-049 study. Similarly to those observed in the BOOSTRIX-048 study, 
these results indicate that no difference was observed between both groups of vaccinees (dTpa and 
control groups). Thus, results of both studies indicate that the maternal immunisation (MI) did not 
impact the proportion of the infants achieving the seroprotection threshold for this pneumococcal 
serotype. 
Whether or not the co-administration of DTPa combination vaccines in general or Infanrix hexa in 
particular with Prevenar 13 led to low immune response to pneumococcal serotype 3 is difficult to 
ascertain. Indeed, at the time of the authorisation of Prevenar 13, vaccination of infants with DTPa-
combination vaccines was the standard of care in most EU countries and in the US. To the knowledge 
of the Company, no clinical trials in infants were performed in which Prevenar 13 was given without co-
administration of a DTPa (or DTPw)-combination vaccine. In the European and US pivotal non-
inferiority trials conducted to support the registration of Prevenar 13, DTPa-combination vaccines were 
always co-administered.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/496745/2020  
Page 33/47 
 
 
 
 
  
A table (Table 15) listing the different co-administration studies (GSK and non-GSK) that were 
conducted with Prevenar 13 and different DTPa combination vaccines was presented. Results of the 
studies were briefly presented. 
Table 15. Listing of clinical studies from different MA holders, for which results 
were discussed 
Overall, for all studies taken together, the percentage of subjects with anti-PnPS3 ≥0.35 µg/ml (or 0.2 
µg/ml depending of the assay cut-off) ranged between 63.5% and 99.6% one month post primary 
vaccination. 
This is appropriately reflected in the Prevenar 13 SmPC that includes results of both Prevenar 13 004 
and 006 studies: “For serotype 3, the percentages of Prevenar 13 recipients with serum IgG ≥ 0.35 
µg/ml were 98.2% (study 006) and 63.5% (study 004). “ 
In conclusion, the Company considers that it is unlikely that the lower anti-PnPS3 response observed in 
BOOSTRIX-048 is specific to the co-administration with Infanrix hexa or to the study population. 
Rather, the lower percentage of subjects equal to or above the 0.35 μg/ml threshold for anti-PnPS3 in 
study BOOSTRIX-048, is likely due to an inherent variability in the response to PnPS3 that has been 
observed by GSK as well as by other manufacturers when Prevenar 13 is co-administered with DTPa-
combination vaccines and other vaccines. 
Assessor’s comment 
The Company appropriately clarified that the results of the serological response to pneumococcal 
serotype 3 observed in the study BOOSTRIX-048 are acceptable. The results of the various studies 
discussed by the Company indicate that there is a variability in the response to PnPS3 when Prevenar 
13 is co-administered with DTPa-combination vaccines and other vaccines, ranging from 63.5% to 
99.6%.  
Point resolved 
2.  In principle the risk of blunting of infants’ pertussis, diphtheria and Streptococcus 
pneumoniae responses should be added in the SmPC of Infanrix-hexa in the section 4.4. 
The MAH should discuss a proposal. 
The Company does not consider it appropriate to describe blunting of infants’ pertussis, diphtheria and 
Streptococcus pneumoniae responses as a risk related to maternal immunization with dTpa in the 
Special warnings and precautions for use section of the Infanrix hexa SmPC. On the contrary, the 
Company considers that any description of blunting in the section 4.4 could be interpreted by health 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/496745/2020  
Page 34/47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
care professionals as a precaution for use of dTpa vaccination during pregnancy and such an 
interpretation would be counterproductive to the efforts done in multiple countries in different 
geographical regions to implement MI against pertussis in order to protect young infants against 
pertussis disease between birth and the start of the primary vaccination. 
The EMA guideline on the SmPC (revision 2, 2009), section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for 
use, describes the following: “Information on a specific risk should be given in section 4.4 only when 
the risk leads to a precaution for use or when healthcare professionals have to be warned of this risk.” 
The Company does not consider that there is any evidence of clinical relevance of the observed 
immune interference of MI with the response to the primary and booster vaccinations in infants and 
toddlers. On the contrary, the Company considers that all the information currently available supports 
the position that blunting does not lead to an increased risk of pertussis disease in infants and 
toddlers. The Company provided several supportive information that are summarized below. 
Immunogenicity data from studies dTpa-048 and dTpa-049 
Since the submission of the Clinical Study Report for study dTpa-048 under Article 46 of the Regulation 
(EC) 1901/2006, as amended, the statistical analysis of study dTpa-049 has become available. Key 
data related to infants’ pertussis, diphtheria and Streptococcus pneumoniae responses from studies 
dTpa-048 and -049 were provided and discussed. 
Immune responses to Diphtheria toxoid (Table 16) 
Post-primary vaccination with Infanrix hexa, lower diphtheria antibody concentrations were observed 
for infants and toddlers born to mothers vaccinated with dTpa as compared to controls. 
At the post-booster timepoint, all subjects in both study groups had seroprotective antibody titres ≥0.1 
IU/ml. Additionally, 99.1% and 100% of the toddlers in the dTpa and control groups respectively had 
antibody titres ≥1.0 IU/ml.  
A comparable fold-increase in GMCs from the pre- to the post-booster timepoints was observed in both 
groups (30-fold for the dTpa group and 26-fold for the control group), showing that an adequate and 
comparable immune memory for diphtheria was generated in both groups.  
At 1 month after the booster dose, a lower GMCs value for anti-D antibodies was still observed in the 
dTpa group when compared to the control group. Based on modelling data, even much bigger 
differences in the GMCs are not expected to change the seroprotection rates in the long term 
(Cheuvart, 2004).

Table 16. Overall percentage of subjects with anti-D Ab concentration ≥ 0.1 IU/ml 
and ≥1.0 IU/ml and GMC, before and after the booster dose (ATP cohort for 
immunogenicity) 
Assessor’s comment 
Results of the study BOOSTRIX-049 indicate that 100% of the subjects of both groups were sero-
protected 1 month after the booster dose. Almost 100% of the subjects of both groups had Ab titers 
above the threshold associated with long term protection (≥ 1.0 IU/ml). The results also suggest the 
generation of a comparable immune memory in both groups. Therefore, the lower anti-D GMT 
observed in the dTpa group when compared to the control group 1 month post-primary (and post-
boost) would not imply an impact on clinical protection. 
The clinical study report of BOOSTRIX-049 study will be submitted in January 2020 and the overall 
results will be assessed at that time. 
Immune responses to Streptococcus pneumoniae (Table 17) 
As assessed in the initial report, a trend for higher GMCs of Ab specific to most of the serotypes was 
observed for the control group compared to the dTpa group. However, percentages of subjects 
achieving the cut-off of 0.35 µg/ml, considered as the protective threshold, were generally high but 
were slightly lower for 5 out of 13 serotypes. The Company considered that this trend was only seen 
for serotypes 4 and 19F and that the percentage of subjects with antibody concentrations above the 
seroprotective threshold of 0.35 µg/ml was similar in both groups. 
Post-booster vaccination, comparable percentages of subjects with antibody concentrations above the 
seroprotective threshold were observed between the two study groups, for all serotypes. 
Post-booster vaccination, GMTs induced in dTap group were generally slightly lower than those induced 
in the control group.

Assessor’s comment 
Comparable percentage of subjects had Ab titers ≥ 0.35 µg/ml 1 month post-boost. The threshold of ≥ 
0.35 µg/mL is considered as a protective threshold. The results suggest that the subjects of both 
groups are comparatively able to mount an anamnestic response. Thus, the observed (slight) 
interference of MI on infant’s Ab concentration post-primary and post-booster vaccination is not likely 
to be clinically relevant. 
As stated above, results should be confirmed when the entire results of BOOSTRIX-049 study will be 
assessed in January 2020.

Immune responses to Bordetella pertussis antigens (PT, FHA, PRN) (Table 18) 
In study dTpa-048, lower antibody concentrations against pertussis antigens were observed post-
primary vaccination in infants born to mothers vaccinated with Boostrix during pregnancy. 
At 1 month after the booster dose of Infanrix hexa in study dTpa-049, lower GMCs were observed in 
the dTpa group for anti-PT and anti-FHA when compared to the control group, but not for PRN.  
A significant GMC-fold increase in antibodies against pertussis was observed from the pre- to the post-
booster timepoint in the dTpa group (anti-PT: 11.9-fold, anti-FHA: 13.6-fold, anti-PRN: 48.4-fold), and 
similar ranges were observed in the control group (anti-PT: 12.7-fold, anti-FHA: 11.3-fold, anti-PRN: 
27.3-fold). These data are aligned to those published by independent investigators.

Assessor’s comment 
Results of the study BOOSTRIX-049 suggest that infants of both groups developed an immune memory 
against B. pertussis. However, 1 month post-boost, lower anti-PT, -FHA and –PRN Ab GMCs were 
observed in the dTpa group when compared to the control group. The clinical relevance of this 
observation is unknown. 
Even if data suggest that an immune memory was induced by the vaccination, it is not known for 
which duration and if the quality of the recall responses would be unaffected.  
As stated above, the results of BOOSTRIX-049 study should be confirmed by the assessment of the 
entire results in January next year.  
Epidemiological data on pertussis disease following the implementation of maternal immunization 
against pertussis 
If the interference of maternal vaccination against pertussis with the response to paediatric vaccination 
against pertussis would be clinically relevant, one would expect to see over time an increased risk of 
pertussis disease in older infants and/or toddlers following the implementation of maternal 
immunization. 
Epidemiological effectiveness studies have assessed the risk of pertussis disease following the 
completion of the primary immunization series. 
Amirthalingam 2016: The study was conducted by Public Health England (PHE) assessed the 
effectiveness of maternal dTpa-IPV vaccination to protect newborns and infants against pertussis 
disease in England. In infants below 3 months of age, maternal vaccination with dTpa-IPV was shown 
to be >90% effective to protect against pertussis. Further analysis suggested that high levels of 
protection are conferred to infants who have received their first dose of the primary series. After the 
third infant dose, the number of pertussis cases were too small to generate meaningful results and 
there was no longer evidence of protection from maternal immunization. However, importantly, the 
estimates remained above 0%, which according to the investigator indicates that there is no evidence

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

of greater risk of pertussis disease after the primary immunization, in those infants whose mothers 
received the dTpa vaccine during pregnancy.  
Becker-Dreps 2018: The study was conducted in the United States and concluded that between 6 and 
18 months of life, there were no differences in pertussis rates by receipt of prenatal dTpa vaccine, after 
adjustments in the analysis for the infant’s DTPa receipt. 
Baxter 2017: The study was conducted in the United States of infants born at Kaiser Permanente 
Northern California from 2010 to 2015. In this retrospective cohort study, the investigators estimated 
the effectiveness of maternal pertussis vaccination for protecting newborns against pertussis in the 
first 2 months of life and in the first year of life by accounting for each infant DTaP dose. The estimated 
maternal vaccination effectiveness was still at 65.9% (95% CI, 4.5 to 87.8) after the infants had 3 
DTPa doses. 
In England, maternal immunization with Tdap-IPV was implemented in 2012. With >70% MI vaccine 
coverage in 2017 and 2018, the number of pertussis disease cases in infants < 3 months of age in 
2018 was the lowest since 1994. The number of cases in infants < 1 year of age was the lowest since 
2010. In older infants (6-11 months of age), cases remained low since the 2012 epidemic peak and MI 
implementation. In children ≥ 1 year of age, the number of pertussis cases in 2018 was below the 
number of cases in 2017, with the exception of infants 1 to 4 years of age (15% increase, with 86 
cases in 2018 versus 75 cases in 2017). According to Public Health England, the extension of the age 
range for oral fluid testing for pertussis diagnosis from 5 to <17 years to 2 to <17 years as of May 1, 
2018 is likely to have contributed to this increase. Public Health England concluded that the low 
number of confirmed pertussis cases in older infants was consistent with protection from primary 
vaccination offered at 2, 3 and 4 months of age. As raised levels of pertussis persist in all age groups 
other than infants, the 2018 PHE surveillance report concludes that women should, therefore, continue 
to be encouraged to be immunised against pertussis at the optimal time during pregnancy in order to 
protect their babies from birth. 
Although not confirmatory, these data further support the position that the interference of maternal 
immunization with the infant immune response to paediatric pertussis vaccination as apparent by GMC 
levels should not have a clinical impact. 
In June 2019, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization (JCVI) concluded that the 
maternal programme has been highly successful, and that there has been a substantial impact on 
pertussis disease in England. The Committee noted also that it was reassured that blunting of the 
infant immune responses was not having any clinical impact and advised that the MI programme 
should continue as a routine programme. 
Assessor’s comment 
As already indicated in the initial report, it is acknowledged that MI does protect infants from pertussis 
disease before primary vaccination and that no deleterious effect of MI was evidenced during and/or 
shortly after the primary vaccination. This is supported by both effectiveness studies and UK 
epidemiological data (from 2017 and 2018). 
The increased number of cases in infants from 1 to 4 years in 2018 compared to 2017 is likely due to a 
modification of the cases detection. It is unlikely that is due to interference of MI but this cannot be 
proven with the data presented (since the PHE report presented the data from infants of 1 to 4 yoa 
and not from infants of 1 to 2 yoa only, i.e. born in 2017-2018) (PHE, annual report for 2018).

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/496745/2020  
Page 42/47 
 
 
 
 
 
Nevertheless, the JCVI committee was reassuring regarding the absence of any clinical impact of the 
blunting of infants immune responses.  
Upcoming PHE data in the following years and additional epidemiological data from countries where the 
vaccine coverage of pregnant women is high would help to further insight the potential impact on the 
protection against pertussis disease. 
Overall Company conclusion on the need to describe a warning in section 4.4 
Overall, the currently available evidence from clinical and epidemiological studies do not suggest the 
blunting to be of any clinical relevance. Any mention of this phenomenon in the section 4.4 Warnings 
and Precautions for use is therefore considered inappropriate by the Company. The Company shares 
the opinion of the member state reviewer (MS2 in the assessment report) that an update of this 
section may have wide implications for the vaccination of infants and their mothers with potential 
relevance to many vaccines. It may further lead to vaccination hesitance, leading to suboptimal 
protection of vaccine-preventable diseases. 
Assessor’s comment 
It is agreed that the issue on the blunting effect of various antigen immune responses following 
maternal immunization has indeed wide implication. Overall, and in the absence of a CoP, it remains 
difficult to ascertain whether there is a (long-term) clinical impact of the observed blunting of the 
infant’s immune responses.  
The VWP considered that a warning in section 4.4 of the Infanrix hexa SmPC is not appropriate since 
Infanrix hexa is not given to pregnant women. However, the VWP considered that it could be 
appropriate to add a subsection in section 5.1 of the SmPC for Infanrix hexa under a heading of Infant 
immune responses following maternal immunisation (or similar). The section could shortly describe the 
observed effect on infant GMCs for pertussis antigens. Such SmPC revision should be considered by the 
MAH when the overall dataset will be available. 
Blunting as a class effect and need for class labelling if update of section 4.4 imposed by authorities 
If the authorities would disagree with the Company position that update of the Special warnings and 
precautions for use section 4.4 of Infanrix hexa is inappropriate and impose an update of the SmPC, 
the Company strongly insists that blunting is a class effect to be reflected using a class labelling 
wording across registered DTPa combination vaccines in Europe. Indeed, all available data on blunting 
resulting from MI indicate that the effect is independent of the combination of vaccines used for 
maternal and childhood immunisation (Maertens, 2016a; Maertens, 2016b; Munoz, 2014; Ladhani, 
2015; Hoang, 2016; Maertens, 2016c; Halperin, 2018; Kent, 2016; Villareal Pérez, 2017; Hardy- 
Fairbanks, 2013; Rice, 2019, Barug, 2019). Importantly, there is no evidence suggesting that the 
interference is vaccine-product specific since blunting has been observed following primary and/or 
booster infant vaccinations, regardless of the vaccine brands used for MI and primary/booster series 
and importantly also without maternal vaccination as a natural phenomenon. 
A full Company Position Paper detailing all currently available evidence with different products and 
concluding on blunting as a class effect is annexed to the current response document. Two 
independent experts reviewed this document and endorsed the Company’s conclusion that blunting of 
the response to paediatric vaccination should not be considered as a product-specific phenomenon. 
Consequently, if the Authorities consider blunting to be of a real clinical concern to be highlighted to 
the Health Care Practitioners (HCP) through the SmPC, the only appropriate way to do so is to update 
the SmPCs of all the different DTPa combination vaccines that are registered across the EU, with

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

identical wording. The Company would insist that in such a case, this label update is to be 
implemented in a synchronized manner for all relevant products. 
The Company further wants to highlight that to date GSK is the only manufacturer that has taken 
responsibility to generate robust data on the safety and immunogenicity of maternal dTpa vaccination, 
as well as on the potential impact on the response to paediatric vaccines, through manufacturer-
sponsored clinical trials. Therefore, GSK is the only company that is obliged through the Article 46 of 
the paediatric regulation to have these data assessed by the EMA, with the potential request for a 
product-specific label update as a consequence. As blunting is observed across DTPa combination 
products following maternal immunization, GSK considers that such procedural reason would be an 
insufficient justification to limit the description of a warning to Infanrix hexa label only. 
Assessor’s comment 
The position of the MAH is acknowledged. The VWP considers that it can reasonably be expected that 
the above-mentioned effect is not limited to maternal vaccination with Boostrix and that a similar 
effect can be expected for other vaccines containing pertussis antigens that would be suitable for 
pregnant women. However, the magnitude of the effect on infant immune responses could differ 
depending on the vaccine administered during pregnancy and the infant vaccine.  
The assessors agree with the VWP. 
3.  Further data would be useful in the context of a variation before any conclusion on 
product information amendments is made. Immunogenicity data of the studies 
BOOSTRIX-048 and BOOSTRIX-049 should be added in section 5.1 of the SmPC, upon 
assessment. An update of the section 4.8 with the safety data of both studies is also 
required. It is understood from previous scientific advices that the MAH commits to 
submit the data from studies 047, 048 and 049 as variations to the MA in 2020. The MAH 
should discuss their plans to submit any data in the near future. 
Study dTpa-049 will be submitted according to the Article 46 requirements of the Regulation (EC) 
1901/2006, as amended, by the 10th of January 2020. 
The Company further confirms that a variation for Infanrix hexa is being prepared for submission in 
March 2020. This variation will discuss the outcome of the three maternal vaccination studies dTpa-
047, -048 and -049. A draft label update will be proposed as part of this variation. Also in March next 
year, a variation to update the Boostrix and Boostrix Polio SmPCs with the results of the same three 
studies will be submitted. Beyond these variations, no further submissions related to maternal 
vaccination are currently anticipated. 
The Company also raised the limitations for the Company to generate further data concerning the 
clinical impact of blunting. This was already discussed and agreed during a consultation with the PEI 
(i.e. the Regulatory Authority of the Reference Member State (RMS) for Boostrix and Boostrix Polio in 
the MRP in Europe) in April 2018. Indeed, despite the occurrence of outbreaks, pertussis remains a 
relatively rare disease in countries with high pertussis vaccination rates. Hence drawing statistically 
powered conclusions concerning the effect of maternal pertussis vaccination on the epidemiology of 
pertussis disease in infants and children does not only require very large datasets at the population 
level, it also necessitates access to robust pertussis disease surveillance data and reported pertussis 
cases which are being collected on an ongoing basis by national and supranational health organisations 
such as Public Health England (PHE) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control 
(ECDC). Therefore, the Company proposal was to monitor the independently generated scientific 
evidence by national and supranational health organisations who have access to large populations in 
order to get further insights on the effect of maternal vaccination with Boostrix/Boostrix Polio on the 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

pertussis disease epidemiology, i.e. by monitoring reports on pertussis vaccine effectiveness in the 
offspring and children from women vaccinated with dTpa during pregnancy and also the overall impact 
of pertussis MI within the well-established infancy immunization programs. This monitoring will be 
performed on publications from peer-reviewed journals and reports publicly available on public health 
organizations’ websites. This monitoring plan is currently described in the Boostrix and Boostrix Polio 
RMPs in the section “Other forms of routine pharmacovigilance activities for blunting”. 
Assessor’s comment 
The MAH presented their plans of submission as required. 
The MAH clarified that, due to pertussis epidemiology, no further data concerning the clinical impact of 
blunting will be generated. The MAH will rather monitor the scientific evidences generated by 
independent health organisations to gain further insights into the impact of MI, if any, on the 
protection of infants against pertussis. This proposal was agreed by the MS3 and is described in the 
RMPs of Boostrix and Boostrix Polio. This clarification is acknowledged and endorsed.  
MS comments and VWP responses 
Comment was received from MS3. The dossier was discussed at VWP. 
MS3 comment 
MS3 agrees with the Rapporteur’s assessment. 
We would like to stress the importance of the discussion TC on Monday and our view at the moment is 
to mention the results in the SmPC under 5.1 as no clinically relevant blunting is seen and thus a 
warning statement is not in order. Also, we are of the opinion that this is a class issue of the booster 
vaccines used in maternal immunization. 
VWP responses 
1.  Does the VWP agree with this association between MI with Boostrix and blunting of 
(i) homologous and (ii) heterologous antigens-induced immune responses in infants? 
The data suggest that maternal immunisation with dTpa during pregnancy result in some blunting of 
the GMCs against pertussis antigens following vaccination of infants with Infanrix hexa. This was 
observed after primary and booster doses. However, the VWP noted that the post-booster GMCs were 
higher than the post-primary GMCs in infants in the dTpa and control groups, suggesting that infants in 
both groups had to some extent been primed during the primary series.  The VWP considered that it is 
unlikely that the effect observed on GMCs is clinically relevant.   
The VWP also agreed that there is no indication that infant immune responses to the other antigens in 
Infanrix hexa are affected to any clinically important extent. 
2.  Does the VWP consider that the blunting of specific immune responses is linked to a 
specific vaccine or to a class product effect? 
It can reasonably be expected that the above-mentioned effect is not limited to maternal vaccination 
with Boostrix and that a similar effect can be expected for other vaccines containing pertussis antigens 
that would be suitable for pregnant women. However, the magnitude of the effect on infant immune 
responses could differ depending on the vaccine administered during pregnancy and the infant vaccine.

3.  Does the VWP consider that this blunting effect should be reflected in the Infanrix 
SmPC? Could a wording be proposed? 
The VWP did not agree with the Rapporteur’s proposal that a warning should be placed in section 4.4 
of the Infanrix hexa SmPC. Infanrix hexa is not given to pregnant women (its antigen content is 
unsuitable for adults) and therefore the warning statement introduced into the various dTpa vaccines 
would be inappropriate for the Infanrix hexa SmPC. 
The VWP considered that it could be appropriate to add a subsection in section 5.1 of the SmPC for 
Infanrix hexa under a heading of Infant immune responses following maternal immunisation (or 
similar). The section could shortly describe the observed effect on infant GMCs for pertussis antigens. 
However, the VWP recommended to postpone such SmPC revision until the final data from the booster 
study 049 are submitted for assessment, at which time the overall dataset will be available.  
4.  Does the VWP consider that the unknown clinical relevance of the blunted immune 
responses in infants needs to be further studied by the MAH and how? 
The VWP did not consider that there is anything that the MAH could be requested to do to further 
investigate this effect.  
It is agreed that important information on any possible impact of the blunting effect would come from 
ongoing routine surveillance for pertussis in countries that have introduced maternal immunisation 
against pertussis. These data cannot be generated by the MAH but published results should be 
reported in PSURs. 
5.  Does the VWP has any other comments with regards to the data assessed in this 
procedure? 
The VWP is of the opinion that the current SmPC statements on blunting of immune responses in 
infants following maternal immunisation should be revised for Boostrix/Boostrix IPV and 
Covaxis/Repevax. The warning in section 4.4 for the latter vaccines, which appears in section 4.6 for 
the former vaccines, is so vague as to be totally unhelpful, and it misrepresents the evidence. 
Furthermore, inserting such a statement in 4.6 is not in line with the expected content of section 4.6 
(safety of pregnancy) and the SmPC Guideline. These vaccines are not approved through the 
centralised route and it will be for the reference Member State (RMS) to initiate revisions, which could 
follow on from the MAH’s planned variation to the Infanrix hexa SmPC in early 2020.

are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

According to population pharmacokinetic analyses, Asians 
had a lower clearance resulting in increased exposure. 
Therefore, these patients should be closely monitored for 
adverse reactions especially in case of dose escalation. 
No formal studies have been performed to assess the 
effects of Age, gender and race demographic factors. 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses in patients with Ph+ 
leukaemia or malignant solid tumour and in healthy 
subjects indicate that there are no clinically relevant effects 
of age, gender or body weight. Population pharmacokinetic 
analyses revealed that Asians had a 18% lower clearance 
corresponding to an approximately 25% increase in 
bosutinib exposure (AUC).

125 mg aprepitant (a moderate CYP3A inhibitor) was co 
administered with a single dose of 500 mg bosutinib under 
fed conditions, aprepitant increased bosutinib Cmax by 1.5-
fold, and bosutinib AUC in plasma by 2.0-fold, as compared 
with administration of bosutinib alone. 
In a study of 27 healthy subjects, in whom a single dose of 
500 mg bosutinib was co-administered with a single dose of 
150 mg dabigatran etexilate mesylate (a P-glycoprotein (P-

and a daily dose of 300 mg in patients with severe renal 
impairment are predicted to result in a similar AUC to that 
seen in patients with normal renal function receiving 500 
mg daily. 
Consequently, in patients with moderate renal impairment 
(CrCL 30 to 50 mL/min, calculated by the Cockroft-Gault 
formula), the recommended dose of bosutinib is 400 mg 
daily (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). In patients with severe 
renal impairment (CrCL <30 mL/min, calculated by the 
Cockroft-Gault formula), the recommended dose of 
bosutinib is 300 mg daily (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Dose escalation to 500 mg once daily for patients with 
moderate renal impairment or to 400 mg once daily in 
patients with severe renal impairment may be considered 
in those who did not experience severe or persistent 
moderate adverse reactions, under any of the following 
circumstances. 
Long-term treatment with bosutinib may result in a 
clinically significant decline in renal function in CML 
patients. It is important that renal function is assessed 
prior to treatment initiation and closely monitored during 
therapy with bosutinib, with particular attention to those 
patients exhibiting risk factors for renal dysfunction, 
including concomitant use of medicinal products with 
potential for nephrotoxicity, such as diuretics, ACE 
inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

tablets, 100 mg and powder for oral solution, 100 mg and 500 mg. Application has been submitted by 
the applicant Dipharma B.V., Netherlands. 
The reference medicinal product is Kuvan available in the form of 100 mg soluble tablets and 100 mg 
and 500 mg powder for oral solution (MAA No: EU/1/08/481, BioMarin International Limited, Ireland) 
authorised on 02 December 2008 in the EU. It was originally designated as an orphan medicinal 
product on 8 June 2004 (EU/3/04/199). Kuvan was withdrawn from the Community register of orphan 
medicinal products in December 2020 at the end of the 12-year period of market exclusivity. 
Sapropterin Dipharma has the same quantity of the active substance, same pharmaceutical forms, 
strengths and route of administration as the chosen reference medicinal products. 
In addition, the proposed indications and posology are in line with the chosen reference medicinal 
products. 
One bioequivalence (BE) study has been performed using the reference medicinal product, Kuvan. The 
test product (Sapropterin 100 mg soluble tablets, Batch number: P05G19-238) and the reference 
product (Kuvan® 100 mg, soluble tablets, Batch number: L141448, sourced from Ireland) were 
compared in healthy adult subjects in fed condition (Study No. DPH01- 2019-001-BE). 
The applicant is requesting a biowaiver for 100 and 500 mg powder for oral solution.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction  
The finished product is presented in two dosage forms, as a powder for oral solution and as soluble 
tablets. The powder for oral solution contains 100 mg or 500 mg of sapropterin dihydrochloride as 
active substance; the soluble tablets contain 100 mg of sapropterin dihydrochloride as active 
substance. 
Other ingredients are:  
Powder for oral solution: mannitol (E421), potassium citrate (E332), sucralose (E955), ascorbic 
acid (E300) 
Soluble tablet: mannitol (E421), crospovidone type A, copovidone K28, ascorbic acid (E300), 
sodium stearyl fumarate, riboflavin (E101) and anhydrous colloidal silica (E551).  
The powder for oral solution is available in polyethylene terephthalate, aluminium, polyethylene 
laminate sachet, heat sealed on four sides. An internal tear notch is located in the corner of the sachet 
to facilitate opening of the sachet, as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
The soluble tablets are available in high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle with child-resistant closure 
with screw cap containing desiccant (silica), as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.3.  Active substance 
General information 
The documentation on the active substance is presented using an Active Substance Master File (ASMF) 
procedure. 
Assessment report  
EMA/2232/2022  
Page 11/35 
 
 
 
The chemical name of sapropterin dihydrochloride is (6R)-2-amino-6-[(1R,2S)-1,2-dihydroxypropyl]-
5,6,7,8-tetrahydropteridin-4-one dihydrochloride corresponding to the molecular formula C9H15N5O3 · 
2HCl. It has a molecular mass of 314.17 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
The chemical structure of sapropterin dihydrochloride was elucidated by a combination of number of 
methods, i.e. IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR spectroscopy, HPLC, DSC, mass spectrometry and elementary 
analysis. The solid state properties of the active substance were measured by XRPD. 
The sapropterin dihydrochloride is a white crystalline odourless deliquescent powder. It is soluble in 
solvents (mixture alcohol-water, DMSO, DMF, lightly soluble in ethanol) and water (pH independent 
solubility > 600 mg/mL). 
Sapropterin dihydrochloride exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of three chiral centres. In 
response to a major objection (MO), it has been demonstrated that the manufacturer consistently 
synthesises the 6R, 1’R, 2’S form, which is the same form as used in the reference product. 
Enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely by chiral XRPD profile, at release, and optical rotation, both 
at release and during stability. Tautomerism cannot occur for the protonated (dihydrochloride salt) 
active substance. Stability data support that only one stereoisomer is present in the active substance 
through its retest time. 
Polymorphism has been observed for sapropterin dihydrochloride. A total fifteen forms have been 
identified, including polymorphic forms (A, B, F, J, K), hydrates (C, D, E, H, O) and solvates (G, I, L, M, 
N), as reported in literature. Form B is a thermodynamically stable crystalline anhydrate and it can be 
specifically identified by X-ray powder diffraction. Sapropterin dihydrochloride form B is consistently 
manufactured by the proposed manufacturing process as demonstrated by data. Additionally, given 
that the finished products are formulated as soluble pharmaceutical forms, that will be dissolved prior 
to administration, and in view of the high aqueous solubility of the active substance, the existence of 
polymorphism is not a source of concern. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is manufactured by one active substance manufacturer. 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Sapropterin dihydrochloride is synthesized using commercially available well-defined starting materials 
with acceptable specifications.  
Assessment report  
EMA/2232/2022  
Page 12/35 
 
 
 
 
 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
Four potential genotoxic impurities arise from the synthesis of sapropterin dihydrochloride are 
identified. The manufacturing process of sapropterin dihydrochloride ensures effective purging of all 
potentially genotoxic impurities discussed. The absence of benzene in the final active substance has 
been confirmed by analysis of four industrial batches. The characterisation of the active substance and 
its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new active substances. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance started before the clinical development 
program. The active substance used in the clinical program is unchanged. 
The active substance is packaged in double PE bags (with silica gel in between), outer aluminium bag 
and HDPE drums. PE bags comply with EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification, includes tests for: appearance, specific optical rotation, pH, identity 
(HPLC, XRPD, chloride test), loss on drying (USP/Ph. Eur.), residue on ignition (USP), chloride content 
(titration), assay (titration, HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), platinum content (ICP-
MS) and particle size distribution (laser diffraction). 
The active substance specification as used by the finished product manufacturer, are the same as the 
specification applied by the active substance manufacturer, with the exception that a three-tier limit 
for the particle size distribution (PSD) has been implemented during the procedure, as PSD may 
adversely impact product segregation within the blend; the limit for residual platinum has been 
removed as Pt is controlled by the active substance manufacturer only.  
Limits for impurities have been set in line with ICH Q3A. During the procedure, a specification limit for 
residual solvents used in the manufacturing process of sapropterin dihydrochloride active substance 
has been implemented into specification. Absence for a test on microbiological quality in the active 
substance specification has been justified as the manufacturing process assures that microbial growth 
is avoided, since low pH is maintained through the manufacturing method and the solvent isopropyl 
alcohol, which has antimicrobial properties, is used in the last manufacturing process steps of the 
active substance, prior to drying. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on three full scale commercial batches of the active substance are provided. The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from three full scale commercial batches of active substance from the proposed 
manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package for up to 24 months under long term 
conditions (25°C / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40°C / 75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The following parameters were tested: appearance, 
identification (HPLC, XRPD), loss on drying, assay (titration), assay (HPLC) and related substance. The 
analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
Assessment report  
EMA/2232/2022  
Page 13/35 
 
 
 
All tested parameters were within the specifications. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. Results on stress 
conditions (basic conditions: 1 M NaOH; acidic conditions: 1 M HCl; oxidative conditions: 3% H2O2; 
warm conditions: 105°C for 12 h + 12 h; light exposure for 24 h, UV 254 nm, 24 h) were also provided 
on one batch. The provided results from photostability study demonstrated that sapropterin 
dihydrochloride is sensitive to exposure to light with respect to the appearance of the powder; no 
significant modification of the purity of the product occurs due to exposure to light. The container 
closure system is adequate to prevent changes in the appearance of the powder. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months when stored in 
the proposed container. The active substance should be stored in tight, light resistant container with 
no special temperature storage conditions requirements.

White to off-white, approximately 10 mm x 3.65 mm, round tablet debossed with “11” on one side and 
score line on the other side. The score line is not intended for breaking the tablet. 
No overages are included in finished product. 
The finished product has been developed to be a generic equivalent to the reference medicinal product 
Kuvan 100 mg soluble tablets.  
The majority of the excipients are the same in both test and reference product. The main differences 
between the test and reference product were the replacement of the binder calcium hydrogen 
phosphate with copovidone and the addition of a very small amount of the glidant silica colloidal 
anhydrous. No safety relevance and influence on bioavailability are expected in view of the difference 
in binder and glidant type between the test and reference product. All excipients are well known 
pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel 
excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of 
the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. The choice of the excipients, including the antioxidant 
ascorbic acid, is supported by pre-formulation studies and stability data demonstrating the 
compatibility and suitability of the excipient with the active substance sapropterin dihydrochloride. A 
satisfactory description of the formulation optimisation, to address issues of adhesion of the blend to 
the punches of the tableting equipment, ensuring that the correct disintegration time has been 
maintained.  
The pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements. The objective was to 
prepare a soluble tablet being essentially similar to the reference medicinal product; the quality target 
product profile (QTPP) was defined based on the properties of the active substance, characterisation of 
the reference product (PK, physicochemical characterisation and in vitro dissolution) and consideration 
of the reference product label and intended patient population. The critical quality attributes identified 
were assay, dosage uniformity, disintegration and dissolution, loss on drying and degradation 
products. A risk assessment of the active substance attributes (solid state form, particle size 
distribution, hygroscopicity, solubility, residual solvents, process impurities, chemical stability and flow

properties) was performed to evaluate the impact that each attribute could have on the finished 
product CQAs.  
As sapropterin dihydrochloride is considered a highly soluble BCS Class III compound (high solubility 
and low permeability), particle size is indicated as not critical material attribute for the soluble tablets; 
however, a specification limit has been set. 
The active substance polymorphic form (form B) stability in the finished product and during storage 
has been demonstrated by experimental data. 
In response to a MO raised on the stereoisomer of the active substance and finished product, the 
stability of the desired 6R, 1’R, 2’S stereoisomer has been demonstrated for the finished product 
through its shelf life.  
Due to the hygroscopicity of the active substance, direct tableting was chosen as the manufacturing 
process for the proposed finished product, which includes sifting, blending, lubrication, compression 
and packaging. The manufacturing development has been evaluated through the use of risk 
assessment to identify critical process parameters. The critical process parameters have been 
adequately identified. 
The conditions of the selected dissolution method used for QC check are: 900 ml of 0.1 N HCl as 
dissolution medium, paddle apparatus (II), 50 rpm at 37°C. The active substance is highly soluble in 
water and over the physiological pH range (pH 1.2 to 6.8), its solubility is pH independent, as 
demonstrated by solubility tests. The stability of active substance in solution decreases significantly 
with increasing the pH of the medium (above pH 3.1), thus the choice of 0.1 N HCl is appropriate. Due 
to high solubility, the deliberate alteration of formulation changes in critical excipients (binder, 
disintegrant and lubricant) and/or challenging process parameters (lubrication time, compression 
speed and compression force) did not lead to a dramatic change in dissolution profile of sapropterin 
soluble tablet. Thus, the discriminatory power of the dissolution method cannot be demonstrated. 
However, a disintegration test is included in the sapropterin soluble tablet specification, whose 
compliance with set limit confirms the complete disintegration of soluble tablet into water. The 
suitability of the dissolution method has been demonstrated in response to a MO raised during the 
procedure. 
Bioequivalence between the reference product Kuvan 100 mg soluble tablets approved and marketed 
in EU (batch no. L141448, expiry date 11/2021), and one full production scale batch of Sapropterin 
Dipharma 100 mg soluble tablets manufactured by the proposed finished product manufacturer with 
the proposed formulation and manufacturing process was demonstrated in one clinical study under fed 
conditions. This is further discussed in the clinical part of the report.  
An in vitro comparative dissolution test was performed for the test (biobatch) and the reference 
products used in in vivo bioequivalence study, in accordance to the Guideline on Investigation of 
Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98, Rev. 1), was performed using the chosen dissolution 
conditions (900 ml dissolution medium, paddle apparatus (II), 50 rpm at 37°C) at three different pHs 
(pH 1.2; pH 4.5 in acetate buffer with 0.1% ascorbic acid to improve the stability of the product; pH 
6.8 in phosphate buffer with 0.1% ascorbic acid to improve the stability of the product). In addition, 
comparative dissolution data were also obtained on first three full production scale batches; when 
tested at three different pHs (pH 1.2; pH 4.5 in acetate buffer with 0.1% ascorbic acid to improve the 
stability of the product; pH 6.8 in phosphate buffer with 0.1% ascorbic acid to improve the stability of 
the product ) at the chosen dissolution conditions (900 ml, 50 rpm, paddle apparatus II, 37°C). The in 
vitro dissolution studies show comparable profiles as more than 85% of the active substance is 
dissolved within 15 minutes. During the procedure, it was confirmed that the biobatch contained the 
desired stereoisomer of the reference product.

The organoleptic properties of the formulation have been satisfactorily discussed. In view of the 
physical chemical characteristics of the active substance in solution and taking into account guidance 
documents published after the approval date of the reference product (e.g. Guideline on 
pharmaceutical development of medicines for paediatric use EMA/CHMP/QWP/805880/2012 Rev. 2 and 
Administration of oral immediate release medicinal products through enteral feeding tubes December 
2018), some details are missing from the SmPC of both pharmaceutical forms that should be included 
and, where necessary, should be supported by compatibility studies for both finished products (powder 
for oral solution and soluble tablets); for future development, the applicant is recommended to 
investigate the effect of mixing the finished products with common food or drinks, as the absence of 
recommendations on mixing with food or drinks in the SmPC will not assure that caregivers will not 
employ this method in order to administer a medicinal product. The applicant is also recommended to 
investigate the feasibility of administering the product through enteral feeding tubes. 
The primary packaging of soluble tablets is high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle with child-resistant 
closure with screw cap containing desiccant (silica). Each bottle contains 30 or 120 soluble tablets. The 
material complies with EC requirements. The child-resistant cap is compliant with ISO 8317:2015. The 
choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the 
intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls (soluble tablets) 
The manufacturing process of soluble tablets consists of four main stages: dispensing (step 1); sifting, 
blending and lubrication (steps 2-6); tableting (step 7); primary and secondary packaging (step 8). 
The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Process validation of Sapropterin Dipharma 100 mg soluble tablets was performed on three full scale 
consecutive batches of bulk product corresponding to six batches of packaged finished product. It has 
been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of 
intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of 
manufacturing process.  
Product specification (soluble tablets) 
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of 
dosage form: appearance (visual), average weight (Ph. Eur.), disintegration time, average weight (Ph. 
Eur.), disintegration time (Ph. Eur.), hardness (in-house), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), identification of 
sapropterin dihydrochloride (UV and HPLC), identification of colourant for riboflavin (UV - VIS), 
identification of ascorbic acid (UV and HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (mass variation, Ph. Eur.), 
dissolution (HPLC, In-house/Ph. Eur. 2.9.3), related substances (HPLC), assay of sapropterin 
dihydrochloride (HPLC), content of ascorbic acid (HPLC), and microbiological tests (Ph. Eur.). 
The proposed specification for the finished product is in line with ICH Q6A, where relevant. 
During the procedure, the limit for dissolution test in the finished product release and shelf life 
specification has been tightened in line with batch data, and the limit for content of ascorbic acid has 
been tightened in release and shelf-life specification. The release limit and the shelf life limit for loss on 
drying has also been tightened.  
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data on 
three batches using a validated ICP-MS method were provided, demonstrating that each relevant 
elemental impurity was not detected above 30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment 
Assessment report  
EMA/2232/2022  
Page 16/35 
 
 
 
and the presented batch data, it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental 
impurity controls in the finished product specification. The information on the control of elemental 
impurities is satisfactory. 
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product 
has been performed (as requested) considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the 
“Questions and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the 
Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal 
products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation 
EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based 
on the information provided, it is accepted that there is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active 
substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no specific control measures are deemed 
necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three industrial scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product (soluble tablets) 
Stability data from six industrial scale batches of finished product stored for up to eighteen months 
under long term conditions (25°C / 60% RH) and for up to six months under accelerated conditions 
(40°C / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of Sapropterin Dipharma 
100 mg soluble tablets are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary 
packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for appearance, disintegration time, hardness, loss on drying, dissolution, related 
substances, sapropterin dihydrochloride assay, content of ascorbic acid and microbial tests. The 
analytical procedures used are stability indicating.  
All tested parameters are within the specification with storage in proposed container closure system.  
In addition, one batch of the 30 tablets pack size, considered as worst case, was exposed to light as 
defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. An 
increased in degradation products, within the acceptance criteria, was observed for the exposed 
samples, demonstrating the suitability of the intended packaging material against light penetration. 
An in-use stability study has been performed on two finished product batches of 120 tablet pack size 
representing the worst case. The batches complied with the specification confirming the suitability of 
the intended 60 days of in-use stability. However, no in-use shelf life after first opening of the bottle is 
stated in the drug product information which is in compliance with the Quality of medicines Q&A Part 2 
since no significant changes were observed across the stability studies. 
To support the method of administration as described in the SmPC, an in-use study was conducted which 
demonstrates physic-chemical stability of the product for 20 minutes after dissolution. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months as stated in the SmPC (section 
6.3) is acceptable. No special storage conditions are required.

Adventitious agents (soluble tablets) 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.5.  Finished medicinal product: 100 mg and 500 mg powder for oral 
solution 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development (powder for oral solution) 
The finished product Sapropterin Dipharma 100 mg and 500 mg powder for oral solution is a white to 
yellowish powder for oral solution; it has been developed to be a generic equivalent to the reference 
medicinal product Kuvan 100 mg powder for oral solution and Kuvan 500 mg powder for oral solution. 
No overages are included in the finished product. 
The qualitative composition is the same for the test and reference product. All excipients are well 
known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no 
novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 
6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. The choice of the excipients, including the 
antioxidant ascorbic acid, is supported by pre-formulation studies and stability data demonstrating the 
compatibility and suitability of the excipient with the active substance sapropterin dihydrochloride. 
The pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements. The objective was to 
prepare a powder for oral solution being essentially similar to the reference medicinal product; the 
quality target product profile (QTPP) was defined based on the properties of the active substance, 
physicochemical characterisation of the reference product and consideration of the reference product 
label and intended patient population. The formulation and manufacturing development have been 
evaluated through the use of risk assessment to identify the critical product quality attributes and 
critical process parameters. The critical quality attributes identified were identification, assay, 
uniformity of dosage units (UOD), impurities, moisture content and microbial limits. A risk assessment 
of the active substance attributes (solid state form, particle size distribution, solubility, moisture 
content and flow properties) was performed to evaluate the impact that each attribute could have on 
the finished product CQAs.  
The active substance polymorphic form (form B) stability in the finished product and during storage 
has been demonstrated by experimental data.  
In response to a MO raised on the stereoisomer of the active substance and finished product, the 
stability of the desired 6R, 1’R, 2’S stereoisomer has been demonstrated for the finished product 
through its shelf life.  
Particle size distribution may impact product segregation within the blend, hence on uniformity of 
dosage units and assay. Hence, a specification limit has been set for the active substance PSD (for 
D10, D50, D90) in line with batch data. 
The chosen manufacturing method consists of direct blending of the dispensed finished product 
components and packaging. 
An in vitro comparative dissolution test was performed for three process validation batches per 
strength of the test product versus one batch per strength of the reference product, in accordance to 
the Guideline on Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98, Rev. 1). The profiles were 
generated at three different pHs (pH 1.2; pH 4.5 in acetate buffer and with 0.1% ascorbic acid to

improve the stability of the product; pH 6.8. in phosphate buffer with 0.1% ascorbic acid to improve 
the stability of the product) using the chosen dissolution conditions (900 ml dissolution medium, 
paddle apparatus (II),50 rpm at 37°C). The in vitro dissolution studies show comparable profiles as 
more than 85% of the active substance is dissolved within 15 minutes. Biowaiver of 100 mg and 500 
mg powder for oral solution has been applied. Since the product meets the general requirements 
according to Guideline on Investigation on Bioequivalence, the biowaiver for 100 mg and 500 mg 
powder for oral solution can be accepted.  
In view of the physical chemical characteristics of the active substance in solution and taking into 
account guidance documents published after the approval date of the reference product (e.g. Guideline 
on pharmaceutical development of medicines for paediatric use EMA/CHMP/QWP/805880/2012 Rev. 2 
and Administration of oral immediate release medicinal products through enteral feeding tubes 
December 2018), some details are missing from the SmPC of both pharmaceutical forms that should 
be included and, where necessary, should be supported by compatibility studies for both finished 
products (powder for oral solution and soluble tablets); for future development, the applicant is 
recommended to investigate the effect of mixing the finished products with common food or drinks, as 
the absence of recommendations on mixing with food or drinks in the SmPC will not assure that 
caregivers will not employ this method in order to administer a medicinal product. The applicant is also 
recommended to investigate the feasibility of administering the product through enteral feeding tubes. 
The primary packaging of powder for oral solution is polyethylene terephthalate, aluminium, 
polyethylene laminate sachet, heat sealed on four sides. Each carton contains 30 sachets. An internal 
tear notch is located in the corner of the sachet to facilitate opening of the sachet. The materials 
comply with EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by 
stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls (powder for oral solution) 
The manufacturing process of powder for oral solution consists of four main steps: dispensing (step 1); 
first co-sieving and blending (step 2); second sieving and blending (step 3); primary and secondary 
packaging (step 4). The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Process validation of Sapropterin Dipharma 100 mg and 500 mg powder for oral solution was 
performed on three full scale consecutive batches per strength of the finished product. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing 
process. 
Product specification (powder for oral solution) 
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of 
dosage form: appearance of the powder (visual testing), appearance of sachet (visual testing, average 
weight   (Ph.Eur.), loss on drying (Ph. Eur. 2.2.32), pH of the solution (in-house), identification of 
Sapropterin dihydrochloride (UV and HPLC), identification of ascorbic acid (UV and HPLC), uniformity of 
dosage units (content uniformity, Ph. Eur.), assay of sapropterin dihydrochloride (HPLC), content of 
ascorbic acid (HPLC), reconstitution time (in-house), seal test (in-house), and microbiological tests 
(Ph. Eur.). 
The proposed specification for the finished product is in line with ICH Q6A, where relevant. 
During the procedure, the limit for dissolution test in the finished product release and shelf life 
specification has been tightened in line with batch data. The limit for content of ascorbic acid has been

EMA/2232/2022  
Page 19/35 
 
 
 
tightened in the shelf-life specification. The limit for total impurities in the finished product specification 
has been tightened at release and during shelf life. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data on 
three batches using a validated ICP-MS method were provided, demonstrating that each relevant 
elemental impurity was not detected above 30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment 
and the presented batch data, it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental 
impurity controls in the finished product specification. The information on the control of elemental 
impurities is satisfactory. 
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been 
performed (as requested) considering all potential root causes in line with the “Questions and answers 
for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation 
(EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “European Medicines Regulatory Network approach for the 
implementation of the CHMP Opinion pursuant to Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) N° 726/2004 for 
nitrosamine impurities in human medicines (EMA/425645/2020). Based on the information provided it 
is accepted that no risk was identified on the possible presence of nitrosamine impurities in the active 
substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no additional control measures are deemed 
necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three industrial scale batches of both strengths confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification. 
Stability of the product (powder for oral solution) 
Stability data from three industrial scale batches of both strengths of finished product stored for up to 
eighteen months under long term conditions (25°C / 60% RH) and for up to six months under 
accelerated conditions (40°C / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of 
Sapropterin Dipharma 100 mg and 500 mg powder for oral solution are identical to those proposed for 
marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for appearance, appearance of sachets, loss on drying, related substances, 
sapropterin dihydrochloride assay, content of ascorbic acid, seal test and microbial tests. The analytical 
procedures used are stability indicating. 
All tested parameters are within the specification with storage in proposed container closure system. 
No trend is visible during whole testing period for any of the tested parameters. 
In addition, one batch of the 100 mg strength was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on 
Photostability  Testing  of  New  Drug  Substances  and  Products.  No  significant  differences  between  the 
exposed and dark samples were noted demonstrating the suitability of the intended packaging material 
against light penetration. 
An in-use study was conducted which demonstrated physico-chemical stability of the products for 30 
minutes after dissolution. Samples of three batches of each strength were dissolved in 120 ml and in 
240 ml. The dissolution time was measured. Appearance of the solution, assay and related substances 
Assessment report

were evaluated after dissolution and 30 minutes after dissolution. All acceptance criteria were fulfilled. 
No deterioration can be observed. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months as stated in the SmPC (section 
6.3) is acceptable. No special storage conditions are required. 
Adventitious agents (powder for oral solution) 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.6.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. Adequate justification has been given for the choice of the 
QC dissolution method. Additionally, during the procedure the applicant has demonstrated that the 
same isomer of the reference product is consistently manufactured by the proposed active substance 
manufacturer used and it is stable through the retest period of the active substance and shelf life of 
the finished product. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important 
product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were two 
minor unresolved quality issues having no impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product, which 
pertain the investigation of the effect of mixing the finished products with common food or drinks and 
the feasibility of administering the products through enteral feeding tubes. These points are put 
forward and agreed as recommendations for future quality development. 
2.7.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.8.  Recommendations for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation for both pharmaceutical forms: 
1.  The applicant is recommended to investigate the effect of mixing the finished products with 
common food or drinks for both finished products (powder for oral solution and soluble 
tablets). The absence of recommendations on mixing with food or drinks in the PI will not 
assure that caregivers will not employ this method in order to administer a medicinal product. 
The PI should be updated accordingly. 
2.  The applicant is recommended to investigate the feasibility of administering the products 
(powder for oral solution and soluble tablets) through enteral feeding tubes. The PI should be 
updated accordingly.

2.9.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.9.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, 
which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no 
need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The 
non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity 
profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.9.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment studies were submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Sapropterin Dipharma manufactured by Dipharma B.V. is considered unlikely to result 
in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all sapropterin containing products and 
the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar. 
2.9.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP considers the justifications for absence of new non-clinical and ERA data as acceptable 
considering the type of application (natural occurring substance). 
2.10.  Clinical aspects 
2.10.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for soluble tablets and an oral solution containing sapropterin dihydrochloride 100 
mg and an oral solution containing sapropterin dihydrochloride 500 mg. To support the marketing 
authorisation application the applicant provided the following data: 
- The applicant conducted one bioequivalence study (No. DPH01- 2019-001-BE; AZ/BE/07/19/10) with 
cross-over design under fed conditions. This study was the pivotal study for the sapropterin 100 mg 
soluble tablets. 
Furthermore, the applicant submitted an exemption from the requirement to perform a bioequivalence 
(BE) study for the oral solutions containing sapropterin dihydrochloride 100 mg and 500 mg, 
respectively. 
No formal scientific advice by the CHMP was given for this medicinal product. For the clinical 
assessment Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1) in its 
current version is of particular relevance. 
According to the proposed SmPC (section 4.1) Sapropterin Dipharma is indicated: 
Sapropterin Dipharma is indicated for the treatment of hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA) in adults and 
paediatric patients of all ages with phenylketonuria (PKU) who have been shown to be responsive to 
such treatment (see section 4.2). 
Assessment report  
EMA/2232/2022  
Page 22/35 
 
 
 
 
Sapropterin Dipharma is also indicated for the treatment of hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA) in adults 
and paediatric patients of all ages with tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency who have been shown to 
be responsive to such treatment (see section 4.2). 
According to the proposed SmPC (section 4.2) the posology and method of administration of 
Sapropterin Dipharma follows the reference medicinal product: 
The recommended dose is in the range of 5 to 20 mg/kg/day. In elderly and patients with renal or 
hepatic impairment, caution must be exercised. 
The tablets should be placed in a pre-specified amount of water, stirred until dissolved and the solution 
should be swallowed. The solution should be drunk within 15 to 20 minutes. It is recommended to 
administer it together with a meal to increase the absorption. 
GCP aspect 
The Clinical trial was performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Exemption 
A BCS-based biowaiver is requested for both strengths (100 and 500 mg) of powder for oral solution. 
The following requirements are claimed to be fulfilled:

During the procedure, the applicant additionally submitted details of an analytical comparison with the 
EU reference product which showed that the compositions are not only qualitatively but also 
quantitatively similar. 
Based on the above information, the CHMP concluded that the relevant criteria were met to support 
the requested BSC- biowaiver. Specifically, the additional comparative data with the EU reference 
product showed that the compositions of Sapropterin Dipharma and Kuvan powder for oral solution are 
not only qualitatively but also quantitatively similar.

2.10.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Study DPH01-2019-001-BE (EudraCT number : AZ/BE/07/19/10) : An open label, balanced, 
randomized, two treatments, two sequences, two periods, single dose, cross over, 
bioequivalence study of Sapropterin 100 mg Soluble Tablets of Dipharma SA Switzerland 
and Kuvan 100 mg Soluble Tablets of BioMarin International Limited in healthy, adult, 
human subjects under fed condition  
Methods 
•  Study design  
This study is designed as comparative, randomized, balanced, two-treatment, two-period, two-
sequence, two-way crossover open label bioequivalence study on healthy volunteers with a single dose 
administration under fed conditions. In each study period, subjects received a single oral dose of 10 
mg/kg BW rounded to the next 100 mg of a sapropterin tablet (test) or a reference with 240 ml of 
water after an overnight fast (8 hrs). 30 minutes before dosing, the subjects received a high fat high 
calorie breakfast (986 kcal, 17.6% protein, 53.8% fat and 28.6% carbohydrates). Wash-out period 
was 2 days.  
Blood samples were collected at -01.00, -00.50, 00.00 (Pre-dose) 00.50, 01.00, 01.50, 02.00, 02.50, 
03.00, 03.33, 03.67, 04.00, 04.33, 04.67, 05.00, 05.50, 06.00, 08.00, 12.00, 16.00 and 24.00 hrs 
post-dose. Sapropterin in human plasma was analysed by LC/MS/MS. 
•  Test and reference products  
Sapropterin Dipharma 100 mg, soluble tablets manufactured by Alpex Pharma SA, Switzerland (batch 
No: P05G19-238, manufacturing date: 07/2019,  expiry date: 07/2021) has been compared to Kuvan 
100mg, soluble tablets manufactured by Biomarin International Limited, Ireland (Batch No:L141448, 
expiry date: 11/2021). 
•  Population(s) studied 
The main inclusion criteria were: healthy subjects, aged 18-45 years, BMI within 18.5-30 kg/m2, healthy 
by normal physical examination and medical history, normal 12-lead ECG, blood pressure and heart rate, 
no  known  allergy  to  the  investigated  product,  capable  of  giving  written  informed  consent  prior  to 
receiving any study medication. 
The  total of  30  Asian  subjects  were  dosed  and  29  completed  the  study.  Data from  these  29  subjects 
were used for pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis.  
One subject discontinued the study. One subject was withdrawn from the study during period I due to 
adverse event (rash). Hence, the subject was excluded from the efficacy analysis. The handling of the 
drop-out is considered acceptable. 
A number of protocol deviations with no significant impact on data was reported: 
-  There  were  15  sampling  time  deviations  ranging  from  2  to  12  minutes.  All  were  considered  as  not 
relevant as actual times were considered for the analysis; 
Assessment report  
EMA/2232/2022  
Page 27/35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- In one subject, the volume of withdrawn blood was 3 ml instead of 5 ml due to cannula block. This was 
not considered as having an impact as the volume was sufficient for bioanalysis; 
- In period 2, the indwelling cannula was removed after 16 hrs sampling time point. The PK data were 
however still collected at 24 hrs. 
-The amount of stabiliser which was added to each vial before the storage and bioanalysis was changed 
contrary to the protocol based on the results obtained in the method development experiments. 
Concomitant  medication:  the  only  concomitant  medication  was  administered  to  the  subject  who  was 
excluded from the analysis.  
•  Analytical methods 
Determination of sapropterin in human plasma (K3EDTA) used a validated LC/MS/MS method.  
During the bioequivalence study, blood samples were collected into tubes containing K3EDTA as an 
anticoagulant, then centrifuged at 3500 rpm for about 10 minutes at 4°C. The plasma was separated 
into 02 aliquots in pre-labelled polypropylene tubes; 01 mL was transferred into first aliquot and 
remaining into aliquot 02. Polypropylene tubes were pre-labelled with subject number, study number, 
study period, time point and aliquot number. These samples were stored at -70+/-15°C. The longest 
period of sample storage was 61 days, what is covered by the long-term stability data in biological 
matrix for 94 days.  
Total number of collected samples was 1,236. The total number of analysed analytical runs is 18, 16 
out of 1,236 samples were re-assayed due to the following reasons: poor chromatography (14), above 
limit of quantification (1), processing error (1). 
Internal standard was sapropterin-D3. A set of 8 non-zero standards with calibration range (4.283 to 
1011.560 ng/mL) and 5 quality controls (4.323 to 806.064 ng/mL) were prepared on 19/07/20 and 
stored at a nominal temperature of -70+/-15°C. 
The quality control sample data for sapropterin were assessed with between-run precision of 1.86 – 
11.91% CV and accuracy of 94.38 – 107.25%.  
A total number of 114 incurred samples were re-analysed, corresponding to 9% of 1,236 study 
samples and 99.12% of them met the acceptance criteria specified in the Guideline on bioanalytical 
method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009). 
There were no measured sample concentrations above the calibrated upper limit of quantification. 
Analysis was performed in the blinded manner. Evaluation of metabolite back-conversion is not 
regarded as necessary. Handling of samples was adequate. There were no protocol and SOP deviations 
during the subject sample analysis. 
The applicant however did not perform the standard addition method. See further details in the 
discussion on clinical aspects 
In  terms  of  polymorphism,  the  reference  medicinal  product  (Sapropterin  dihydrochloride)  exhibits 
polymorphism  and  many  crystalline  forms  were  identified  during  the  course  of  crystallisation  studies. 
Form B is a thermodynamically stable crystalline anhydrate and it can be specifically identified by X-ray 
powder diffraction. Given that the finished product is formulated as soluble tablets that will be dissolved 
prior to administration and in view of the high aqueous solubility of the active substance, the existence 
of polymorphism is not a source of concern.

•  Pharmacokinetic variables 
The pharmacokinetic calculations were performed with Phoenix® WinNonlin® Version 8.1 (Certara L.P.).  
Following  pharmacokinetic  parameters  were  calculated  for  sapropterin  using  standard  non-
compartmental methods: 
Primary:  
Cmax: maximum measured plasma concentration over the time span specified 
AUC0-t: the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve, from time (0) to the last measurable 
concentration (t), as calculated by the linear trapezoidal method. 
Secondary: 
AUC0-∞: the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time (0) to infinity. 
Tmax: time of the maximum measured plasma concentration. 
t1/2: the elimination or terminal half-life. 
Kel: elimination constant 
AUC%Extrap_obs: residual area in percentage. 
•  Statistical methods 
Statistical analysis was performed using PROC GLM of SAS® Version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., USA). 
The statistical evaluation of bioequivalence included following: analysis of variance (ANOVA) in all 
derived pharmacokinetic parameters, calculation of formulations ratios (point estimates) and 
parametric 90% confidence interval for ln-transformed AUC0-t and Cmax parameters. 
ANOVA: 5 % significance level for logarithmically transformed (with the 90% confidence intervals) and 
untransformed data of Cmax and AUC0-t. The influence of sequence, subject (sequence), formulation and 
period effect was tested. 
Descriptive statistics:  all pharmacokinetic parameters: arithmetic mean, SD, CV%, median, min and 
max. 
90% Confidence intervals: logarithmically transformed Test/Reference ratios had to be within 80.00-
125.00% for Cmax and AUC0-t. 
Handling of missing values was appropriate. There were no outliers reported. 
Bioequivalence  of  the  test  product  with  that  of  the  reference  product  under  fasting  condition  was 
concluded if the 90% confidence intervals of geometric least square mean ratio of the test to reference 
product falls within the acceptance range of 80.00 % – 125.00% for Cmax and AUC0-t for sapropterin.

•  Safety data 
There was one non-serious adverse event (rash) reported by one subject following administration of test 
product. The subject was withdrawn from the study, the event resolved. No adverse events were reported 
following administration of reference product.  
No serious adverse events were reported during the conduct of this study. 
Individual laboratory measurements (biochemistry, haematology, immunology and urine analysis) were, 
in some cases, outside their reference intervals but not to an extent to be considered clinically significant 
by the study physician. 
2.10.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this 
application.

2.10.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
To  support  this  generic  application,  the  applicant  submitted  an  exemption  from  the  requirement  to 
perform a bioequivalence (BE) study for the oral solutions containing sapropterin dihydrochloride 100 
mg  and  500  mg,  respectively.  The  CHMP  was  initially  concerned  that  bioequivalence  with  the  EU 
reference medicinal product had not been demonstrated. In line with the EMA’s PKWP Q&A 6.3 the waiver 
should follow the BCS Class 3 criteria, i.e. the compositions between the Test and EU reference products 
should be qualitatively the same and quantitatively similar. Based on an additional analytical comparison 
that  was  submitted  during  the  procedure,  the  CHMP  considered  this  issue  adequately  addressed  and 
concluded  that  the  composition  of  Sapropterin  Dipharma  and  EU  reference  product  were  not  only 
qualitatively but also quantitatively similar. 
In addition, a bioequivalence study was conducted to support the application for Sapropterin 100 mg, 
soluble tablets. 
The use of a relative dose 10 mg/kg rounded to the next 100 mg was based on the drafted US FDA 
Product Specific Guidance for Generic Drug Development of Sapropterin. This single dose was 
considered as safe for healthy volunteers and enough to achieve sufficient plasma concentration. The 
CHMP noted this was also in line with the dosing range of the reference medicinal product (5 to 20 
mg/kg). The use of several tablets in a single dose could in principle introduce additional source of 
variability. On the other side, the CHMP agreed that such a relative dosing approach will mimic the 
clinical practice and that formulation effects can be still isolated as each patient will serve as its own 
control. 
Wash-out period seemed to be long enough regarding the mean terminal half-life of 6.69 hours (range 
3.91 to 16.6 hours). As the amount of sapropterin was found to be below 5% of Cmax in the average of 
the pre-dose samples for each subject, it can be concluded that wash-out period was sufficient. The 
sampling period was sufficient to characterize the plasma concentration-time profile considering that 
Cmax was achieved within the first 4 to 5 hours after administration with a meal. As no Cmax was 
measured in any of the samples at the first time point, the sampling scheme has been chosen 
correctly. 
The applicant did a baseline correction as sapropterin is an endogenous substance. First three samples 
(-01.00, -00.50 and 00.00) were collected for baseline correction and then averaged. Any negative 
values were considered as zero. This approach was in line with the EU BE guidance and thus accepted 
by the CHMP. 
Instead of using standard addition method, the Applicant / CRO has used the Peak Area Ratio (analyte 
/IS) of the blank plasma to correct by subtraction the peak area ratio of the calibrators, QCs and study 
subject’s samples. With that, the Applicant was using an instrument response below the LLOQ (even 
closer to LOD ~3 times S/N). Hence, the CHMP was concerned about the variability of the detection of 
the response using this method, that could be very unstable and inaccurate. The CHMP was of the view 
that the Standard Addition method completely avoids this problem because the concentration in the 
blank is extrapolated from concentrations that are above the LLOQ (i.e. the concentrations of the 
calibrators that define the calibration range). The Standard Addition method avoids having a very 
unstable signal too close to noise by “adding” standards (blank matrix spiked with different amounts of 
analyte to create a calibration curve) to move the instrument response into a less variable region. 
During the validation of the bioanalytical methods, the Basal Response Ratio was determined. With 
these results, the applicant tried to show that their response in the blank was not so variable and the 
CV% of 6 replicates were acceptable. However, detection of a signal below the LLOQ was still present. 
Furthermore, the accuracy of that estimation was unknown. Nevertheless, additional considerations 
were made by the CHMP. In particular, concentrations of endogenous sapropterin were very low 
Assessment report  
EMA/2232/2022  
Page 31/35 
 
 
 
compared to Cmax after the administration of tablets (up to around 15 ng/ml versus 350-750 ng/ml). 
Considering that the confidence intervals for Cmax and AUC were not marginal and that variability of 
endogenous sapropterin between arms was minimised by cross-over design, the CHMP did not expect 
this to change the conclusions of the bioequivalence study. Overall, the CHMP concluded that 
bioequivalence between the two formulations of sapropterin has been demonstrated. 90% CIs fall into 
the predefined limit 80-125%, for both AUC0-t and Cmax. 
No statistically significant treatment or sequence effects were observed for the ln-transformed Cmax and 
AUC0-t data. The significant period effect and subjects nested within sequence effect were appropriately 
justified by the applicant.  
Considering that the isomer form of sapropterin is the same in the test and the reference product, it is 
expected that they behave comparably after administration to human. Therefore, the bioanalytical 
results not specifying an exact isomer are acceptable. 
2.10.4.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
Based on the presented bioequivalence study, Sapropterin Dipharma 100 mg, soluble tablets is 
considered bioequivalent with Kuvan 100 mg, soluble tablets.

3.  Benefit-risk balance  
This application concerns a generic version of sapropterin soluble tablets (100 mg) and powder for oral 
solution  (100  mg,  500  mg).  The  reference  product  Kuvan  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of 
hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA) in adults and paediatric patients of all ages with phenylketonuria (PKU) 
and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency, respectively, who have been shown to be responsive to such 
treatment. 
No non-clinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available 
nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical 
perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics 
as  well  as  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  the  active  substance;  the  applicant’s  clinical  overview  on  these 
clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered sufficient. 
An exemption from the requirement to perform a bioequivalence (BE) study was accepted by the CHMP 
for the oral solutions containing sapropterin dihydrochloride 100 mg and 500 mg, respectively.

The bioequivalence study forms the pivotal basis for Sapropterin Dipharma 100 mg soluble tablets with 
a single dose crossover comparative design and was conducted in healthy adults under fed state. The 
study design was considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and was in line 
with the respective European requirements. Choice of dose, sampling points, overall sampling time as 
well  as  wash-out  period  were  adequate.  The  analytical  method  was  validated.  Pharmacokinetic  and 
statistical methods applied were adequate. The test formulation of Sapropterin Dipharma 100 mg soluble 
tablets  met  the  protocol-defined  criteria  for  bioequivalence  when  compared  with  the  Kuvan  100  mg 
soluble tablets. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters AUC0-t and 
Cmax  were  all  contained  within  the  protocol-defined  acceptance  range  of  80.00  to  125.00%. 
Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference 
medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond 
those included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Sapropterin Dipharma is not similar to Palyzinq within 
the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000. See appendix  
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Sapropterin Dipharma is favourable in the following indications: 
Sapropterin Dipharma is indicated for the treatment of hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA) in adults and 
paediatric patients of all ages with phenylketonuria (PKU) who have been shown to be responsive to 
such treatment (see section 4.2). 
Sapropterin Dipharma is also indicated for the treatment of hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA) in adults 
and paediatric patients of all ages with tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency who have been shown to 
be responsive to such treatment (see section 4.2). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions:

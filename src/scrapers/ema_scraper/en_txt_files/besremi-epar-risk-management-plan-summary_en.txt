Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan 
Summary of risk management plan for Besremi 
(Pegylated-Proline-Interferon α-2b) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Besremi. The RMP details important risks of 
Besremi, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about 
Besremi's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Besremi's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential information 
to healthcare professionals and patients on how Besremi should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Besremi should be read in the context of all this information including the 
assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part of the European 
Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Besremi's RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Besremi is authorised for treatment of Polycythaemia Vera without symptomatic splenomegaly (see 
SmPC for the full indication). It contains Pegylated-Proline-Interferon α-2b as the active substance and 
it is given subcutaneously by pre-filled pen with 250 µg or 500 µg ropeginterferon alfa-2b. 
Further information about the evaluation of Besremi’s benefits can be found in Besremi’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s webpage 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/besremi.  
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to 
minimise or further characterise the risks  
Important risks of Besremi, together with measures to minimise such risks for learning more about 
Besremi's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
• 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
 
 
 
 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Besremi is not yet available, it is listed under 
‘missing information’ below.  
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Besremi are risks that need special risk management activities to further investigate 
or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important risks can be 
regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a 
link with the use of Besremi. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this 
medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and 
needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal 
product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the 
medicine);

Important potential risks 
II.B Summary of important risks 
Important identified risk: Hepatotoxicity  
Evidence for linking the risk to 
Hepatotoxicity has been identified as a risk associated with 
the medicine 
IFNα use. Hepatotoxicity such as increase in gamma-
glutamyltransferase, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate 
 
 
aminotransferase or hepatic failure was reported with IFNα 
treatment. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Determination of drug induced liver injury includes an 
individual susceptibility. This susceptibility is governed by 
genetic, pre-existing and environmental factors. Predisposing 
factors consist of ethnicity, CYP polymorphisms, concomitant 
liver diseases, age, nutritional status and diet, gender and 
pregnancy (Tarantino et al., 2009). 
Risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk communication: 
SmPC section 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.8, 5.2  
PL section 2, 4 
Legal status: Prescription only medicine (POM) 
Important identified risk: Thyroid dysfunction 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
Thyroid dysfunction has been identified as a risk associated 
the medicine 
with IFNα use. Thyroid disorders such as hypothyroidism, 
hyperthyroidism, thyroiditis or increase in thyroid stimulating 
hormone (TSH) were reported with IFNα treatment.   
Risk factors and risk groups 
The presence of thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies, has 
been shown to be a statistically significant risk factor for 
developing thyroid disease in patients treated with IFN 
(Tomer et al., 2007). The incidence of thyroid dysfunction is 
higher in IFN-treated patients with pre-existing thyroid 
autoimmunity irrespective of the disease being treated 
(Tovey et al., 2010).

Legal status: POM 
Important identified risk: Neuropsychiatric adverse effects 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Neuropsychiatric adverse effects have been identified as a 
risk associated with IFNα use. Severe neuropsychiatric 
adverse effects such as depression, cognitive disturbances, 
suicidal ideation and psychosis were reported with IFNα 
treatment. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
One major risk factor is presence of psychiatric disorders, 
especially depression in the medical history possibly because 
of shared biological mechanisms. Genetic variants that have 
been implicated in depression, like serotonin, or 
inflammatory pathway related genetic variants increase the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
risk of developing psychological side effects during IFNα 
treatment. Several genetic variants throughout the IFNα/β 
signaling pathway, and genetic variants in the IL-6, IL-1b or 
nitric oxide synthase-1 (NOS1) genes increase depressive 
and anxiety symptomatology (Kovacs et al., 2016).

Important identified risk: Ocular disorders, including decreased visual acuity, loss of 
vision, blindness, and retinal detachment  
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Ocular adverse effects have been identified as a risk 
associated with IFNα use. Ocular adverse effects such as 
decreased visual acuity, loss of vision, and retinal 
detachment were reported with IFNα treatment.  
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients with diabetes and hypertension are at increased risk 
for developing ocular toxicity (PegIntron SmPC)

Legal status: POM 
Important identified risk: Cardiac events including cardiomyopathy, myocardial 
infarction, myocardial ischaemia  
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Cardiac adverse effects have been identified as a risk 
associated with IFNα use, especially in patients with previous 
or existing cardiac complications. Severe cardiac adverse 
effects such as myocardial infarction, congestive heart 
failure, cardiomyopathy, myocardial ischemia and atrial 
fibrillation were reported with IFNα treatment. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients with severe pre-existing cardiovascular disease, i.e. 
uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure (≥ NYHA 
class 2), serious cardiac arrhythmia, significant coronary 
artery stenosis, unstable angina or recent stroke or 
myocardial infarction are at risk.

Important identified risk: Pulmonary disorders including pulmonary fibrosis, lung 
infiltration, pneumonitis and pneumonia 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Pulmonary adverse effects have been identified as a risk 
associated with IFNα use. Severe pulmonary adverse effects 
such as pulmonary fibrosis were reported with IFNα 
treatment. Failure to recognize IFN-associated pulmonary 
toxicity may result in persistence of pulmonary damage. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients with lung (respiratory) problems, such as chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at increased risk.

Important identified risk: Diabetes mellitus 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Diabetes mellitus has been identified as a risk associated 
with IFNα use. IFN therapy triggered type 1 diabetes in 
hepatitis C infected Caucasian and Japanese patients.  
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients with genetic predisposition or with other 
autoimmune diseases are at increased risk.  
Risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk communication: 
SmPC section 4.4, 4.8 
PL section 2, 4 
Legal status: POM 
Important potential risk: Pulmonary arterial hypertension 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is potential risk 
the medicine 
associated with IFNα use. PAH is a very rare side effect of 
IFN treatment but can be life-threatening. Cases of PAH were 
reported with IFNα treatment notably in patients with risk 
factors for PAH (such as portal hypertension, HIV infection, 
cirrhosis). 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients with portal hypertension, HIV infection or cirrhosis 
are at increased risk.

Legal status: POM 
Important potential risk: Thrombotic microangiopathy 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a potential risk 
the medicine 
associated with IFNα use. Case reports have linked TMA to 
IFNα treatment. Type I IFN therapies caused direct dose-
dependent TMA and the IFN protein itself could directly 
damage small blood vessels. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients with deficiency of ADAMTS13 are at risk of 
developing TMA. Secondary TMAs develop in the setting of 
various clinical conditions, such as infection, medication, 
malignancy (especially adenocarcinomas) and various 
underlying diseases. For instance, acquired TMAs are often 
associated with connective tissue diseases, and also 
treatment using several specific drugs. A significant number 
of drugs have been associated with TMAs, including anti-
platelet thienopyridine derivative drugs, antineoplastic drugs 
such as mitomycin C, and quinine (Fujimura et al., 2010).  
Risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk communication: 
SmPC section 4.8 
PL section 4 
Legal status: POM 
Important potential risk: Neoplasms, benign and malignant 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
Neoplasms, benign and malignant, is a potential risk 
the medicine 
associated with IFNα use. Cases of neoplasms such as 
glioblastoma and basal cell carcinoma were reported with 
IFNα treatment. However, a causal relationship could not be 
determined between these events and the IFNα treatment. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Cancer in the family history, genetic predisposition, chronic 
inflammation, radiation, sunlight, tobacco use, exposure to 
cancer-causing substances, immunosuppression are risk 
factors.

Important potential risk: Reproductive toxicity/ spontaneous abortions 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
Reproductive toxicity/ spontaneous abortions is a potential 
medicine 
risk associated with IFNα use. An abortion-inducing effect 
was reported in primates receiving IFNα.   
Risk factors and risk groups 
Women of childbearing potential not using effective 
contraception during IFN treatment are at increased risk.

Important potential risk: Demyelating disorders 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
Demyelinating disorders is a potential risk associated with 
medicine 
IFNα use. Cases of demyelinating disorders in patients with 
hepatitis C or hepatitis B infection and chronic myelogenous 
leukemia were reported during INFα treatment. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Infection and (auto) immune mechanisms are likely to 
contribute to the pathogenesis of demyelinating disorders 
(Reeves et al., 2008).

1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

androgen deprivation therapy, based on final results 
from Study 17777 (ARASENS); this is a randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study 
designed to demonstrate the superiority of 
darolutamide in combination with docetaxel over 
placebo in combination with docetaxel in OS in 
patients with mHSPC. As a consequence, sections 
4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the SmPC 
have been updated. The Package Leaflet is updated 
in accordance. Version 4.1 of the RMP has also been 
submitted.

Oral administration of darolutamide to male rasH2 
report of carcinogenicity study T104877-7 listed as a 
category 3 study in the RMP. This is a non-clinical 
study to assess the carcinogenic potential in mice. 
The study evaluates the effects of daily oral 
administration of darolutamide for a period of 6 
months in tg-rasH2 transgenic mouse model. The 
updated RMP version 3.2 is approved. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
transgenic mice for 6 months did not show carcinogenic 
potential at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day, which is 0.9 1.3 
times for darolutamide and 2.1 2.3 times for keto 
darolutamide the clinical exposure (AUC) at the 
recommended clinical daily dose of 1200 mg/day. Based on 
this study carcinogenic risk of darolutamide cannot be 
completely excluded.

unblinded, patients receiving placebo were offered 
study 17772 (ARAMIS) listed as a PAES in the Annex 
II; this is a multinational, randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, phase III efficacy and safety 
study of darolutamide in men with high-risk non-
metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer; the 
Annex II is updated accordingly. The RMP version 1.1 
is accepted.

treatment with open label darolutamide (cross over option). 
Among the 554 patients randomised to placebo, 170 (31%) 
crossed over to receive darolutamide treatment. The OS 
analysis was not adjusted for confounding effects of cross 
over. At the time of the final analysis, treatment with 
darolutamide resulted in a statistically significant 
improvement in overall survival compared to placebo 
(median was not reached in either arm, HR of 0.685 (95% 
CI: [0.533; 0.881]; p=0.003048)).

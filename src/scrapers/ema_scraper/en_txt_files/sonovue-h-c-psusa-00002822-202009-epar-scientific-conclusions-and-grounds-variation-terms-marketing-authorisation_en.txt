Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for sulfur hexafluoride, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP  are as follows:  
In view of available data on PEG allergy from the literature, spontaneous reports including in some cases 
a close temporal relationship and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers that the 
warning  section  should  be  amended  to  highlight  the  role of  PEG  in  the  occurrence of  rare  but  serious 
hypersensitivity reactions and to  strengthen the existing wording about hypersensitivity reactions. 
The  PRAC concluded  that  the  product  information  of  products  containing  sulfur  hexafluoride should  be 
amended accordingly. 
Grounds for the variation  to the  terms of the marketing  authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the  scientific conclusions for sulfur hexafluoride the CHMP is of the opinion that  the 
benefit-risk balance of the  medicinal product(s) containing  sulfur hexafluoride is unchanged subject to 
the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that  the terms of the  marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

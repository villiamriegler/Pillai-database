Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Segluromet 
ertugliflozin / metformin 
On 25 January 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Segluromet, 
intended for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The applicant for this medicinal product is Merck Sharp & 
Dohme Limited. 
Segluromet is a fixed dose combination of ertugliflozin and metformin, two oral blood glucose lowering 
medicines (ATC code: A10BD23). It will be available as film-coated tablets (containing 2.5 mg 
ertugliflozin/1000 mg metformin; 2.5 mg/850 mg; 7.5 mg/1000 mg; and 7.5 mg/850 mg). Ertugliflozin 
works by blocking a protein in the kidney called the human sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2). 
This reduces glucose re-absorption in the kidney leading to glucose excretion in the urine. Metformin 
works by suppressing glucose production by the liver, by decreasing intestinal absorption of glucose, and 
by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilisation. 
The benefit with Segluromet is its ability to lower blood glucose. The most common side effects are 
vulvovaginal mycotic infection and other female genital mycotic infections as well as gastrointestinal 
symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and loss of appetite). Serious diabetic 
ketoacidosis occurs rarely. 
The full indication is: 
“Segluromet is indicated in adults aged 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to 
diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control: 
 
 
in patients not adequately controlled on their maximally tolerated dose of metformin alone; 
in patients on their maximally tolerated doses of metformin in addition to other medicinal products for 
the treatment of diabetes; 
 
in patients already being treated with the combination of ertugliflozin and metformin as separate 
tablets.

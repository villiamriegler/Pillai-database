CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Allergic asthma 
Xolair is indicated in adults, adolescents and children (6 to <12 years of age). 
Xolair treatment should only be considered for patients with convincing IgE (immunoglobulin E) 
mediated asthma (see section 4.2). 
Adults and adolescents (12 years of age and older) 
Xolair is indicated as add-on therapy to improve asthma control in patients with severe persistent 
allergic asthma who have a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen and who 
have reduced lung function (FEV1 <80%) as well as frequent daytime symptoms or night-time 
awakenings and who have had multiple documented severe asthma exacerbations despite daily high-
dose inhaled corticosteroids, plus a long-acting inhaled beta2-agonist. 
Children (6 to <12 years of age) 
Xolair is indicated as add-on therapy to improve asthma control in patients with severe persistent 
allergic asthma who have a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen and 
frequent daytime symptoms or night-time awakenings and who have had multiple documented severe 
asthma exacerbations despite daily high-dose inhaled corticosteroids, plus a long-acting inhaled beta2-
agonist.

Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 
Xolair is indicated as an add-on therapy with intranasal corticosteroids (INC) for the treatment of 
adults (18 years and above) with severe CRSwNP for whom therapy with INC does not provide 
adequate disease control. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of severe 
persistent asthma or chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). 
Posology 
Dosing for allergic asthma and CRSwNP follows the same dosing principles. The appropriate dose 
and frequency of omalizumab for these conditions is determined by baseline IgE (IU/ml), measured 
before the start of treatment, and body weight (kg). Prior to administration of the initial dose, patients 
should have their IgE level determined by any commercial serum total IgE assay for their dose 
assignment. Based on these measurements, 75 to 600 mg of omalizumab in 1 to 4 injections may be 
needed for each administration. 
Allergic asthma patients with baseline IgE lower than 76 IU/ml were less likely to experience benefit 
(see section 5.1). Prescribing physicians should ensure that adult and adolescent patients with IgE 
below 76 IU/ml and children (6 to <12 years of age) with IgE below 200 IU/ml have unequivocal in 
vitro reactivity (RAST) to a perennial allergen before starting therapy. 
See Table 1 for a conversion chart and Tables 2 and 3 for the dose determination charts. 
Patients whose baseline IgE levels or body weight in kilograms are outside the limits of the dose table 
should not be given omalizumab. 
The maximum recommended dose is 600 mg omalizumab every two weeks.

Treatment duration, monitoring and dose adjustments 
Allergic asthma 
Xolair is intended for long-term treatment. Clinical trials have demonstrated that it takes at least 
12-16 weeks for the treatment to show effectiveness. At 16 weeks after commencing Xolair therapy 
patients should be assessed by their physician for treatment effectiveness before further injections are 
administered. The decision to continue treatment following the 16-week timepoint, or on subsequent 
occasions, should be based on whether a marked improvement in overall asthma control is seen (see 
section 5.1, Physician’s overall assessment of treatment effectiveness). 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 
In clinical trials for CRSwNP, changes in nasal polyps score (NPS) and nasal congestion score (NCS) 
were observed at 4 weeks. The need for continued therapy should be periodically reassessed based 
upon the patient’s disease severity and level of symptom control. 
Allergic asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 
Discontinuation of treatment generally results in a return to elevated free IgE levels and associated 
symptoms. Total IgE levels are elevated during treatment and remain elevated for up to one year after 
the discontinuation of treatment. Therefore, re-testing of IgE levels during treatment cannot be used as 
a guide for dose determination. Dose determination after treatment interruptions lasting less than one 
year should be based on serum IgE levels obtained at the initial dose determination. Total serum IgE 
levels may be re-tested for dose determination if treatment has been interrupted for one year or more. 
Doses should be adjusted for significant changes in body weight (see Tables 2 and 3). 
Special populations 
Elderly (65 years of age and older) 
There are limited data available on the use of omalizumab in patients older than 65 years but there is 
no evidence that elderly patients require a different dose from younger adult patients. 
Renal or hepatic impairment 
There have been no studies on the effect of impaired renal or hepatic function on the pharmacokinetics 
of omalizumab. Because omalizumab clearance at clinical doses is dominated by the reticular 
endothelial system (RES) it is unlikely to be altered by renal or hepatic impairment. While no 
particular dose adjustment is recommended for these patients, omalizumab should be administered 
with caution (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
In allergic asthma, the safety and efficacy of omalizumab in patients below the age of 6 years have not 
been established. No data are available. 
In CRSwNP, the safety and efficacy of omalizumab in patients below the age of 18 years have not 
been established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
For subcutaneous administration only. Omalizumab must not be administered by the intravenous or 
intramuscular route. 
Xolair 300 mg pre-filled syringe and all dose strengths of Xolair pre-filled pen are not intended for use 
in children <12 years of age. Xolair 75 mg pre-filled syringe and Xolair 150 mg pre-filled syringe may 
be used in children 6 to 11 years of age with allergic asthma. 
If more than one injection is needed to achieve the required dose, injections should be divided across 
two or more injection sites (Table 1). 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients with no known history of anaphylaxis may self-inject Xolair or be injected by a caregiver 
from the 4th dose onwards if a physician determines that this is appropriate (see section 4.4). The 
patient or the caregiver must have been trained in the correct injection technique and the recognition of 
the early signs and symptoms of serious allergic reactions. 
Patients or caregivers should be instructed to inject the full amount of Xolair according to the 
instructions for use provided in the package leaflet. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
General 
Omalizumab is not indicated for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations, acute bronchospasm or 
status asthmaticus. 
Omalizumab has not been studied in patients with hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome or allergic 
bronchopulmonary aspergillosis or for the prevention of anaphylactic reactions, including those 
provoked by food allergy, atopic dermatitis, or allergic rhinitis. Omalizumab is not indicated for the 
treatment of these conditions. 
Omalizumab therapy has not been studied in patients with autoimmune diseases, immune complex-
mediated conditions, or pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). Caution should be 
exercised when administering omalizumab in these patient populations. 
Abrupt discontinuation of systemic or inhaled corticosteroids after initiation of omalizumab therapy in 
allergic asthma or CRSwNP is not recommended. Decreases in corticosteroids should be performed 
under the direct supervision of a physician and may need to be performed gradually. 
Immune system disorders 
Allergic reactions type I 
Type I local or systemic allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock, may occur 
when taking omalizumab, even after a long duration of treatment. However, most of these reactions 
occurred within 2 hours after the first and subsequent injections of omalizumab but some started 
beyond 2 hours and even beyond 24 hours after the injection. The majority of anaphylactic reactions 
occurred within the first 3 doses of omalizumab. Therefore, the first 3 doses must be administered 
either by or under the supervision of a healthcare professional. A history of anaphylaxis unrelated to 
omalizumab may be a risk factor for anaphylaxis following omalizumab administration. Therefore for 
patients with a known history of anaphylaxis, omalizumab must be administered by a health care 
professional, who should always have medicinal products for the treatment of anaphylactic reactions 
available for immediate use following administration of omalizumab. If an anaphylactic or other 
serious allergic reaction occurs, administration of omalizumab must be discontinued immediately, and 
appropriate therapy initiated. Patients should be informed that such reactions are possible, and prompt 
medical attention should be sought if allergic reactions occur. 
Antibodies to omalizumab have been detected in a low number of patients in clinical trials (see 
section 4.8). The clinical relevance of anti-omalizumab antibodies is not well understood. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Serum sickness 
Serum sickness and serum sickness-like reactions, which are delayed allergic type III reactions, have 
been seen in patients treated with humanised monoclonal antibodies including omalizumab. The 
suggested pathophysiologic mechanism includes immune-complex formation and deposition due to 
development of antibodies against omalizumab. The onset has typically been 1-5 days after 
administration of the first or subsequent injections, also after long duration of treatment. Symptoms 
suggestive of serum sickness include arthritis/arthralgias, rash (urticaria or other forms), fever and 
lymphadenopathy. Antihistamines and corticosteroids may be useful for preventing or treating this 
disorder, and patients should be advised to report any suspected symptoms. 
Churg-Strauss syndrome and hypereosinophilic syndrome 
Patients with severe asthma may rarely present systemic hypereosinophilic syndrome or allergic 
eosinophilic granulomatous vasculitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome), both of which are usually treated 
with systemic corticosteroids. 
In rare cases, patients on therapy with anti-asthma medicinal products, including omalizumab, may 
present or develop systemic eosinophilia and vasculitis. These events are commonly associated with 
the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. 
In these patients, physicians should be alert to the development of marked eosinophilia, vasculitic 
rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, paranasal sinus abnormalities, cardiac complications, and/or 
neuropathy. 
Discontinuation of omalizumab should be considered in all severe cases with the above mentioned 
immune system disorders. 
Parasitic (helminth) infections 
IgE may be involved in the immunological response to some helminth infections. In patients at chronic 
high risk of helminth infection, a placebo-controlled trial showed a slight increase in infection rate 
with omalizumab, although the course, severity, and response to treatment of infection were unaltered. 
The helminth infection rate in the overall clinical programme, which was not designed to detect such 
infections, was less than 1 in 1 000 patients. However, caution may be warranted in patients at high 
risk of helminth infection, in particular when travelling to areas where helminthic infections are 
endemic. If patients do not respond to recommended anti-helminth treatment, discontinuation of 
omalizumab should be considered. 
Latex-sensitive individuals (pre-filled syringe) 
The removable needle cap of the pre-filled syringe contains a derivative of natural rubber latex. No 
natural rubber latex has to date been detected in the removable needle cap. Nevertheless, the use of 
Xolair solution for injection in pre-filled syringe in latex-sensitive individuals has not been studied and 
thus there is a potential risk for hypersensitivity reactions which cannot be completely ruled out. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Since IgE may be involved in the immunological response to some helminth infections, omalizumab 
may indirectly reduce the efficacy of medicinal products for the treatment of helminthic or other 
parasitic infections (see section 4.4). 
Cytochrome P450 enzymes, efflux pumps and protein-binding mechanisms are not involved in the 
clearance of omalizumab; thus, there is little potential for interactions. Medicinal product or vaccine 
interaction studies have not been performed with omalizumab. There is no pharmacological reason to 
expect that commonly prescribed medicinal products used in the treatment of asthma or CRSwNP will 
interact with omalizumab. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Allergic asthma 
In clinical studies omalizumab was commonly used in conjunction with inhaled and oral 
corticosteroids, inhaled short-acting and long-acting beta agonists, leukotriene modifiers, 
theophyllines and oral antihistamines. There was no indication that the safety of omalizumab was 
altered with these other commonly used anti-asthma medicinal products. Limited data are available on 
the use of omalizumab in combination with specific immunotherapy (hypo-sensitisation therapy). In a 
clinical trial where omalizumab was co-administered with immunotherapy, the safety and efficacy of 
omalizumab in combination with specific immunotherapy were found to be no different to that of 
omalizumab alone. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 
In clinical studies omalizumab was used in conjunction with intranasal mometasone spray as per 
protocol. Other commonly used concomitant medicinal products included other intranasal 
corticosteroids, bronchodilators, antihistamines, leukotriene receptor antagonists, 
adrenergics/sympathomimetics and local nasal anaesthetics. There was no indication that the safety of 
omalizumab was altered by the concomitant use of these other commonly used medicinal products. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
A moderate amount of data on pregnant women (between 300-1 000 pregnancy outcomes) based on 
pregnancy registry and post-marketing spontaneous reports, indicates no malformative or 
foeto/neonatal toxicity. A prospective pregnancy registry study (EXPECT) in 250 pregnant women 
with asthma exposed to omalizumab showed the prevalence of major congenital anomalies was similar 
(8.1% vs. 8.9%) between EXPECT and disease-matched (moderate and severe asthma) patients. The 
interpretation of data may be impacted due to methodological limitations of the study, including small 
sample size and non-randomised design. 
Omalizumab crosses the placental barrier. However, animal studies do not indicate either direct or 
indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Omalizumab has been associated with age-dependent decreases in blood platelets in non-human 
primates, with a greater relative sensitivity in juvenile animals (see section 5.3). 
If clinically needed, the use of omalizumab may be considered during pregnancy. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Breast-feeding 
Immunoglobulins G (IgGs) are present in human milk and therefore it is expected that omalizumab 
will be present in human milk. Available data in non-human primates have shown excretion of 
omalizumab into milk (see section 5.3). 
The EXPECT study, with 154 infants who had been exposed to omalizumab during pregnancy and 
through breast-feeding did not indicate adverse effects on the breast-fed infant. The interpretation of 
data may be impacted due to methodological limitations of the study, including small sample size and 
non-randomised design. 
Given orally, immunoglobulin G proteins undergo intestinal proteolysis and have poor bioavailability. 
No effects on the breast-fed newborns/infants are anticipated. Consequently, if clinically needed, the 
use of omalizumab may be considered during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
There are no human fertility data for omalizumab. In specifically-designed non-clinical fertility 
studies, in non-human primates including mating studies, no impairment of male or female fertility 
was observed following repeated dosing with omalizumab at dose levels up to 75 mg/kg. Furthermore, 
no genotoxic effects were observed in a separate non-clinical genotoxicity study. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Omalizumab has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Allergic asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 
Summary of the safety profile 
During allergic asthma clinical trials in adult and adolescent patients 12 years of age and older, the 
most commonly reported adverse reactions were headaches and injection site reactions, including 
injection site pain, swelling, erythema and pruritus. In clinical trials in children 6 to <12 years of age, 
the most commonly reported adverse reactions were headache, pyrexia and upper abdominal pain. 
Most of the reactions were mild or moderate in severity. In clinical trials in patients ≥18 years of age 
in CRSwNP, the most commonly reported adverse reactions were headache, dizziness, arthralgia, 
abdominal pain upper and injection site reactions. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Table 4 lists the adverse reactions recorded in clinical studies in the total allergic asthma and CRSwNP 
safety population treated with Xolair by MedDRA system organ class and frequency. Within each 
frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Frequency 
categories are defined as: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1 000 to 
<1/100), rare (≥1/10 000 to <1/1 000) and very rare (<1/10 000). Reactions reported in the post-
marketing setting are listed with frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Immune system disorders 
For further information, see section 4.4. 
Anaphylaxis 
Anaphylactic reactions were rare in clinical trials. However, post-marketing data following a 
cumulative search in the safety database retrieved a total of 898 anaphylaxis cases. Based on an 
estimated exposure of 566 923 patient treatment years, this results in a reporting rate of approximately 
0.20%. 
Arterial thromboembolic events (ATE) 
In controlled clinical trials and during interim analyses of an observational study, a numerical 
imbalance of ATE was observed. The definition of the composite endpoint ATE included stroke, 
transient ischaemic attack, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and cardiovascular death (including 
death from unknown cause). In the final analysis of the observational study, the rate of ATE per 1 000 
patient years was 7.52 (115/15 286 patient years) for Xolair-treated patients and 5.12 (51/9 963 patient 
years) for control patients. In a multivariate analysis controlling for available baseline cardiovascular 
risk factors, the hazard ratio was 1.32 (95% confidence interval 0.91-1.91). In a separate analysis of 
pooled clinical trials, which included all randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials 
lasting 8 or more weeks, the rate of ATE per 1 000 patient years was 2.69 (5/1 856 patient years) for 
Xolair-treated patients and 2.38 (4/1 680 patient years) for placebo patients (rate ratio 1.13, 95% 
confidence interval 0.24-5.71).

In clinical trials few patients had platelet counts below the lower limit of the normal laboratory range. 
Isolated cases of idiopathic thrombocytopenia, including severe cases, have been reported in the post-
marketing setting. 
Parasitic infections 
In patients at chronic high risk of helminth infection, a placebo-controlled trial showed a slight 
numerical increase in infection rate with omalizumab that was not statistically significant. The course, 
severity, and response to treatment of infections were unaltered (see section 4.4). 
Systemic lupus erythematosus 
Clinical trial and post-marketing cases of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in 
patients with moderate to severe asthma and CSU. The pathogenesis of SLE is not well understood. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Maximum tolerated dose of Xolair has not been determined. Single intravenous doses up to 4 000 mg 
have been administered to patients without evidence of dose-limiting toxicities. The highest 
cumulative dose administered to patients was 44 000 mg over a 20-week period and this dose did not 
result in any untoward acute effects. 
If an overdose is suspected, the patient should be monitored for any abnormal signs or symptoms. 
Medical treatment should be sought and instituted appropriately.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airway diseases, other systemic drugs for 
obstructive airway diseases, ATC code: R03DX05 
Mechanism of action 
Omalizumab is a recombinant DNA-derived humanised monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to 
human immunoglobulin E (IgE) and prevents binding of IgE to FcRI (high-affinity IgE receptor) on 
basophils and mast cells, thereby reducing the amount of free IgE that is available to trigger the 
allergic cascade. The antibody is an IgG1 kappa that contains human framework regions with the 
complementary-determining regions of a murine parent antibody that binds to IgE. 
Treatment of atopic subjects with omalizumab resulted in a marked down-regulation of FcRI 
receptors on basophils. Omalizumab inhibits IgE-mediated inflammation, as evidenced by reduced 
blood and tissue eosinophils and reduced inflammatory mediators, including IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 by 
innate, adaptive and non-immune cells. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Allergic asthma 
The in vitro histamine release from basophils isolated from omalizumab-treated subjects was reduced 
by approximately 90% following stimulation with an allergen compared to pre-treatment values. 
In clinical studies in allergic asthma patients, serum free IgE levels were reduced in a dose-dependent 
manner within one hour following the first dose and maintained between doses. One year after 
discontinuation of omalizumab dosing, the IgE levels had returned to pre-treatment levels with no 
observed rebound in IgE levels after washout of the medicinal product. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 
In clinical studies in patients with CRSwNP, omalizumab treatment led to a reduction in serum free 
IgE (approx. 95%) and an increase in serum total IgE levels, to a similar extent as observed in patients 
with allergic asthma. Total IgE levels in serum increased due to the formation of omalizumab-IgE 
complexes that have a slower elimination rate compared with free IgE. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Allergic asthma 
Adults and adolescents ≥12 years of age 
The efficacy and safety of omalizumab were demonstrated in a 28-week double-blind placebo-
controlled study (study 1) involving 419 severe allergic asthmatics, ages 12-79 years, who had reduced 
lung function (FEV1 40-80% predicted) and poor asthma symptom control despite receiving high dose 
inhaled corticosteroids and a long-acting beta2-agonist. Eligible patients had experienced multiple 
asthma exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroid treatment or had been hospitalised or attended 
an emergency room due to a severe asthma exacerbation in the past year despite continuous treatment 
with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and a long-acting beta2-agonist. Subcutaneous omalizumab or 
placebo were administered as add-on therapy to >1 000 micrograms beclomethasone dipropionate (or 
equivalent) plus a long-acting beta2-agonist. Oral corticosteroid, theophylline and leukotriene-
modifier maintenance therapies were allowed (22%, 27%, and 35% of patients, respectively). 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The rate of asthma exacerbations requiring treatment with bursts of systemic corticosteroids was the 
primary endpoint. Omalizumab reduced the rate of asthma exacerbations by 19% (p = 0.153). Further 
evaluations which did show statistical significance (p<0.05) in favour of omalizumab included 
reductions in severe exacerbations (where patient’s lung function was reduced to below 60% of 
personal best and requiring systemic corticosteroids) and asthma-related emergency visits (comprised 
of hospitalisations, emergency room, and unscheduled doctor visits), and improvements in Physician’s 
overall assessment of treatment effectiveness, Asthma-related Quality of Life (AQL), asthma 
symptoms and lung function. 
In a subgroup analysis, patients with pre-treatment total IgE ≥76 IU/ml were more likely to experience 
clinically meaningful benefit to omalizumab. In these patients in study 1 omalizumab reduced the rate 
of asthma exacerbations by 40% (p = 0.002). In addition more patients had clinically meaningful 
responses in the total IgE ≥76 IU/ml population across the omalizumab severe asthma programme.

Study 2 assessed the efficacy and safety of omalizumab in a population of 312 severe allergic 
asthmatics which matched the population in study 1. Treatment with omalizumab in this open label 
study led to a 61% reduction in clinically significant asthma exacerbation rate compared to current 
asthma therapy alone. 
Four additional large placebo-controlled supportive studies of 28 to 52 weeks duration in 1 722 adults 
and adolescents (studies 3, 4, 5, 6) assessed the efficacy and safety of omalizumab in patients with 
severe persistent asthma. Most patients were inadequately controlled but were receiving less 
concomitant asthma therapy than patients in studies 1 or 2. Studies 3-5 used exacerbation as primary 
endpoint, whereas study 6 primarily evaluated inhaled corticosteroid sparing. 
In studies 3, 4 and 5 patients treated with omalizumab had respective reductions in asthma 
exacerbation rates of 37.5% (p = 0.027), 40.3% (p<0.001) and 57.6% (p<0.001) compared to placebo. 
In study 6, significantly more severe allergic asthma patients on omalizumab were able to reduce their 
fluticasone dose to 500 micrograms/day without deterioration of asthma control (60.3%) compared to 
the placebo group (45.8%, p<0.05).

Quality of life scores were measured using the Juniper Asthma-related Quality of Life Questionnaire. 
For all six studies there was a statistically significant improvement from baseline in quality of life 
scores for omalizumab patients versus the placebo or control group. 
Physician’s overall assessment of treatment effectiveness: 
Physician’s overall assessment was performed in five of the above studies as a broad measure of 
asthma control performed by the treating physician. The physician was able to take into account PEF 
(peak expiratory flow), day and night time symptoms, rescue medicinal product use, spirometry and 
exacerbations. In all five studies a significantly greater proportion of omalizumab-treated patients 
were judged to have achieved either a marked improvement or complete control of their asthma 
compared to placebo patients. 
Children 6 to <12 years of age 
The primary support for safety and efficacy of omalizumab in the group aged 6 to <12 years comes 
from one randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre trial (study 7). 
Study 7 was a placebo-controlled trial which included a specific subgroup (n=235) of patients as 
defined in the present indication, who were treated with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids 
(≥500 µg/day fluticasone equivalent) plus long-acting beta agonist. 
A clinically significant exacerbation was defined as a worsening of asthma symptoms as judged 
clinically by the investigator, requiring doubling of the baseline inhaled corticosteroid dose for at least 
3 days and/or treatment with rescue systemic (oral or intravenous) corticosteroids for at least 3 days. 
In the specific subgroup of patients on high dose inhaled corticosteroids, the omalizumab group had a 
statistically significantly lower rate of clinically significant asthma exacerbations than the placebo 
group. At 24 weeks, the difference in rates between treatment groups represented a 34% (rate ratio 
0.662, p = 0.047) decrease relative to placebo for omalizumab patients. In the second double-blind 28-
week treatment period the difference in rates between treatment groups represented a 63% (rate ratio 
0.37, p<0.001) decrease relative to placebo for omalizumab patients. 
During the 52-week double-blind treatment period (including the 24-week fixed-dose steroid phase 
and the 28-week steroid adjustment phase) the difference in rates between treatment groups 
represented a 50% (rate ratio 0.504, p<0.001) relative decrease in exacerbations for omalizumab 
patients. 
The omalizumab group showed greater decreases in beta-agonist rescue medicinal product use than 
the placebo group at the end of the 52-week treatment period, although the difference between 
treatment groups was not statistically significant. For the global evaluation of treatment effectiveness 
at the end of the 52-week double-blind treatment period in the subgroup of severe patients on high-
dose inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting beta agonists, the proportion of patients rated as having 
‘excellent’ treatment effectiveness was higher, and the proportions having ‘moderate’ or ‘poor’ 
treatment effectiveness lower in the omalizumab group compared to the placebo group; the difference 
between groups was statistically significant (p<0.001), while there were no differences between the 
omalizumab and placebo groups for patients’ subjective Quality of Life ratings.

Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 
The safety and efficacy of omalizumab were evaluated in two randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled trials in patients with CRSwNP (Table 7). Patients received omalizumab or placebo 
subcutaneously every 2 or 4 weeks (see section 4.2). All patients received background intranasal 
mometasone therapy throughout the study. Prior sino-nasal surgery or prior systemic corticosteroid 
usage were not required for inclusion in the studies. Patients received omalizumab or placebo for 
24 weeks followed by a 4-week follow-up period. Demographics and baseline characteristics, 
including allergic comorbidities, are described in Table 6.

In a pre-specified pooled analysis of rescue treatment (systemic corticosteroids for 3 consecutive 
days or nasal polypectomy) during the 24-week treatment period, the proportion of patients requiring 
rescue treatment was lower in omalizumab compared to placebo (2.3% versus 6.2%, respectively). 
The odds-ratio of having taken rescue treatment in omalizumab compared to placebo was 0.38 (95% 
CI: 0.10, 1.49). There were no sino-nasal surgeries reported in either study. 
The long-term efficacy and safety of omalizumab in patients with CRSwNP who had participated in 
nasal polyp studies 1 and 2 was assessed in an open-label extension study. Efficacy data from this 
study suggest that clinical benefit provided at Week 24 was sustained through to Week 52. Safety data 
were overall consistent with the known safety profile of omalizumab. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics of omalizumab have been studied in adult and adolescent patients with allergic 
asthma as well as in adult patients with CRSwNP. The general pharmacokinetic characteristics of 
omalizumab are similar in these patient populations. 
Absorption 
After subcutaneous administration, omalizumab is absorbed with an average absolute bioavailability 
of 62%. Following a single subcutaneous dose in adult and adolescent patients with asthma, 
omalizumab was absorbed slowly, reaching peak serum concentrations after an average of 7-8 days. 
The pharmacokinetics of omalizumab are linear at doses greater than 0.5 mg/kg. Following multiple 
doses of omalizumab, areas under the serum concentration-time curve from Day 0 to Day 14 at steady 
state were up to 6-fold of those after the first dose. 
Administration of Xolair manufactured as a lyophilised or liquid formulation resulted in similar serum 
concentration-time profiles of omalizumab. 
Distribution 
In vitro, omalizumab forms complexes of limited size with IgE. Precipitating complexes and 
complexes larger than one million Daltons in molecular weight are not observed in vitro or in vivo. 
The apparent volume of distribution in patients following subcutaneous administration was 
78 ± 32 ml/kg. 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elimination 
Clearance of omalizumab involves IgG clearance processes as well as clearance via specific binding 
and complex formation with its target ligand, IgE. Liver elimination of IgG includes degradation in the 
reticuloendothelial system and endothelial cells. Intact IgG is also excreted in bile. In asthma patients 
the omalizumab serum elimination half-life averaged 26 days, with apparent clearance averaging 
2.4  1.1 ml/kg/day. In addition, doubling of body weight approximately doubled apparent clearance. 
Characteristics in patient populations 
Age, Race/Ethnicity, Gender, Body Mass Index 
The population pharmacokinetics of omalizumab were analysed to evaluate the effects of demographic 
characteristics. Analyses of these limited data suggest that no dose adjustments are necessary for age 
(6-76 years for patients with allergic asthma; 18 to 75 years for patients with CRSwNP), 
race/ethnicity, gender or Body Mass Index (see section 4.2). 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
There are no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic data in patients with renal or hepatic impairment 
(see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
The safety of omalizumab has been studied in the cynomolgus monkey, since omalizumab binds to 
cynomolgus and human IgE with similar affinity. Antibodies to omalizumab were detected in some 
monkeys following repeated subcutaneous or intravenous administration. However, no apparent 
toxicity, such as immune complex-mediated disease or complement-dependent cytotoxicity, was seen. 
There was no evidence of an anaphylactic response due to mast-cell degranulation in cynomolgus 
monkeys. 
Chronic administration of omalizumab at dose levels of up to 250 mg/kg (at least 14 times the highest 
recommended clinical dose in mg/kg according to the recommended dosing table) was well tolerated 
in non-human primates (both adult and juvenile animals), with the exception of a dose-related and age-
dependent decrease in blood platelets, with a greater sensitivity in juvenile animals. The serum 
concentration required to attain a 50% drop in platelets from baseline in adult cynomolgus monkeys 
was roughly 4- to 20-fold higher than anticipated maximum clinical serum concentrations. In addition, 
acute haemorrhage and inflammation were observed at injection sites in cynomolgus monkeys. 
Formal carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with omalizumab. 
In reproduction studies in cynomolgus monkeys, subcutaneous doses up to 75 mg/kg per week (at least 
8 times the highest recommended clinical dose in mg/kg over a 4-week period) did not elicit maternal 
toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity when administered throughout organogenesis and did not 
elicit adverse effects on foetal or neonatal growth when administered throughout late gestation, 
delivery and nursing. 
Omalizumab is excreted in breast milk in cynomolgus monkeys. Milk levels of omalizumab were 
0.15% of the maternal serum concentration.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Allergic asthma 
Xolair is indicated in adults, adolescents and children (6 to <12 years of age). 
Xolair treatment should only be considered for patients with convincing IgE (immunoglobulin E) 
mediated asthma (see section 4.2). 
Adults and adolescents (12 years of age and older) 
Xolair is indicated as add-on therapy to improve asthma control in patients with severe persistent 
allergic asthma who have a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen and who 
have reduced lung function (FEV1 <80%) as well as frequent daytime symptoms or night-time 
awakenings and who have had multiple documented severe asthma exacerbations despite daily high-
dose inhaled corticosteroids, plus a long-acting inhaled beta2-agonist.

Children (6 to <12 years of age) 
Xolair is indicated as add-on therapy to improve asthma control in patients with severe persistent 
allergic asthma who have a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen and 
frequent daytime symptoms or night-time awakenings and who have had multiple documented severe 
asthma exacerbations despite daily high-dose inhaled corticosteroids, plus a long-acting inhaled beta2-
agonist. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 
Xolair is indicated as an add-on therapy with intranasal corticosteroids (INC) for the treatment of 
adults (18 years and above) with severe CRSwNP for whom therapy with INC does not provide 
adequate disease control. 
Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) 
Xolair is indicated as add-on therapy for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria in adult and 
adolescent (12 years and above) patients with inadequate response to H1 antihistamine treatment. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of severe 
persistent asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) or chronic spontaneous 
urticaria. 
Posology 
Allergic asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 
Dosing for allergic asthma and CRSwNP follows the same dosing principles. The appropriate dose 
and frequency of omalizumab for these conditions is determined by baseline IgE (IU/ml), measured 
before the start of treatment, and body weight (kg). Prior to administration of the initial dose, patients 
should have their IgE level determined by any commercial serum total IgE assay for their dose 
assignment. Based on these measurements, 75 to 600 mg of omalizumab in 1 to 4 injections may be 
needed for each administration. 
Allergic asthma patients with baseline IgE lower than 76 IU/ml were less likely to experience benefit 
(see section 5.1). Prescribing physicians should ensure that adult and adolescent patients with IgE 
below 76 IU/ml and children (6 to <12 years of age) with IgE below 200 IU/ml have unequivocal in 
vitro reactivity (RAST) to a perennial allergen before starting therapy. 
See Table 1 for a conversion chart and Tables 2 and 3 for the dose determination charts. 
Patients whose baseline IgE levels or body weight in kilograms are outside the limits of the dose table 
should not be given omalizumab. 
The maximum recommended dose is 600 mg omalizumab every two weeks.

Insufficient data to recommend a dose 
Treatment duration, monitoring and dose adjustments 
Allergic asthma 
Xolair is intended for long-term treatment. Clinical trials have demonstrated that it takes at least 
12-16 weeks for the treatment to show effectiveness. At 16 weeks after commencing Xolair therapy 
patients should be assessed by their physician for treatment effectiveness before further injections are 
administered. The decision to continue treatment following the 16-week timepoint, or on subsequent 
occasions, should be based on whether a marked improvement in overall asthma control is seen (see 
section 5.1, Physician’s overall assessment of treatment effectiveness). 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 
In clinical trials for CRSwNP, changes in nasal polyps score (NPS) and nasal congestion score (NCS) 
were observed at 4 weeks. The need for continued therapy should be periodically reassessed based 
upon the patient’s disease severity and level of symptom control.

Allergic asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 
Discontinuation of treatment generally results in a return to elevated free IgE levels and associated 
symptoms. Total IgE levels are elevated during treatment and remain elevated for up to one year after 
the discontinuation of treatment. Therefore, re-testing of IgE levels during treatment cannot be used as 
a guide for dose determination. Dose determination after treatment interruptions lasting less than one 
year should be based on serum IgE levels obtained at the initial dose determination. Total serum IgE 
levels may be re-tested for dose determination if treatment has been interrupted for one year or more. 
Doses should be adjusted for significant changes in body weight (see Tables 2 and 3). 
Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) 
The recommended dose is 300 mg by subcutaneous injection every four weeks. Each 300 mg dose is 
given as one subcutaneous injection of 300 mg or as two subcutaneous injections of 150 mg. 
Prescribers are advised to periodically reassess the need for continued therapy. 
Clinical trial experience of long-term treatment in this indication is described in section 5.1. 
Special populations 
Elderly (65 years of age and older) 
There are limited data available on the use of omalizumab in patients older than 65 years but there is 
no evidence that elderly patients require a different dose from younger adult patients. 
Renal or hepatic impairment 
There have been no studies on the effect of impaired renal or hepatic function on the pharmacokinetics 
of omalizumab. Because omalizumab clearance at clinical doses is dominated by the reticular 
endothelial system (RES) it is unlikely to be altered by renal or hepatic impairment. While no 
particular dose adjustment is recommended for these patients, omalizumab should be administered 
with caution (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
In allergic asthma, the safety and efficacy of omalizumab in patients below the age of 6 years have not 
been established. No data are available. 
In CRSwNP, the safety and efficacy of omalizumab in patients below the age of 18 years have not 
been established. No data are available. 
In CSU, the safety and efficacy of omalizumab in patients below the age of 12 years have not been 
established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
For subcutaneous administration only. Omalizumab must not be administered by the intravenous or 
intramuscular route. 
Xolair 300 mg pre-filled syringe and all dose strengths of Xolair pre-filled pen are not intended for use 
in children <12 years of age. Xolair 75 mg pre-filled syringe and Xolair 150 mg pre-filled syringe may 
be used in children 6 to 11 years of age with allergic asthma. 
If more than one injection is needed to achieve the required dose, injections should be divided across 
two or more injection sites (Table 1). 
Patients with no known history of anaphylaxis may self-inject Xolair or be injected by a caregiver 
from the 4th dose onwards if a physician determines that this is appropriate (see section 4.4). The 
patient or the caregiver must have been trained in the correct injection technique and the recognition of 
the early signs and symptoms of serious allergic reactions. 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients or caregivers should be instructed to inject the full amount of Xolair according to the 
instructions for use provided in the package leaflet. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
General 
Omalizumab is not indicated for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations, acute bronchospasm or 
status asthmaticus. 
Omalizumab has not been studied in patients with hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome or allergic 
bronchopulmonary aspergillosis or for the prevention of anaphylactic reactions, including those 
provoked by food allergy, atopic dermatitis, or allergic rhinitis. Omalizumab is not indicated for the 
treatment of these conditions. 
Omalizumab therapy has not been studied in patients with autoimmune diseases, immune complex-
mediated conditions, or pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). Caution should be 
exercised when administering omalizumab in these patient populations. 
Abrupt discontinuation of systemic or inhaled corticosteroids after initiation of omalizumab therapy in 
allergic asthma or CRSwNP is not recommended. Decreases in corticosteroids should be performed 
under the direct supervision of a physician and may need to be performed gradually. 
Immune system disorders 
Allergic reactions type I 
Type I local or systemic allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock, may occur 
when taking omalizumab, even after a long duration of treatment. However, most of these reactions 
occurred within 2 hours after the first and subsequent injections of omalizumab but some started 
beyond 2 hours and even beyond 24 hours after the injection. The majority of anaphylactic reactions 
occurred within the first 3 doses of omalizumab. Therefore, the first 3 doses must be administered 
either by or under the supervision of a healthcare professional. A history of anaphylaxis unrelated to 
omalizumab may be a risk factor for anaphylaxis following omalizumab administration. Therefore for 
patients with a known history of anaphylaxis, omalizumab must be administered by a health care 
professional, who should always have medicinal products for the treatment of anaphylactic reactions 
available for immediate use following administration of omalizumab. If an anaphylactic or other 
serious allergic reaction occurs, administration of omalizumab must be discontinued immediately, and 
appropriate therapy initiated. Patients should be informed that such reactions are possible, and prompt 
medical attention should be sought if allergic reactions occur. 
Antibodies to omalizumab have been detected in a low number of patients in clinical trials (see 
section 4.8). The clinical relevance of anti-omalizumab antibodies is not well understood. 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Serum sickness 
Serum sickness and serum sickness-like reactions, which are delayed allergic type III reactions, have 
been seen in patients treated with humanised monoclonal antibodies including omalizumab. The 
suggested pathophysiologic mechanism includes immune-complex formation and deposition due to 
development of antibodies against omalizumab. The onset has typically been 1-5 days after 
administration of the first or subsequent injections, also after long duration of treatment. Symptoms 
suggestive of serum sickness include arthritis/arthralgias, rash (urticaria or other forms), fever and 
lymphadenopathy. Antihistamines and corticosteroids may be useful for preventing or treating this 
disorder, and patients should be advised to report any suspected symptoms. 
Churg-Strauss syndrome and hypereosinophilic syndrome 
Patients with severe asthma may rarely present systemic hypereosinophilic syndrome or allergic 
eosinophilic granulomatous vasculitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome), both of which are usually treated 
with systemic corticosteroids. 
In rare cases, patients on therapy with anti-asthma medicinal products, including omalizumab, may 
present or develop systemic eosinophilia and vasculitis. These events are commonly associated with 
the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. 
In these patients, physicians should be alert to the development of marked eosinophilia, vasculitic 
rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, paranasal sinus abnormalities, cardiac complications, and/or 
neuropathy. 
Discontinuation of omalizumab should be considered in all severe cases with the above mentioned 
immune system disorders. 
Parasitic (helminth) infections 
IgE may be involved in the immunological response to some helminth infections. In patients at chronic 
high risk of helminth infection, a placebo-controlled trial in allergic patients showed a slight increase 
in infection rate with omalizumab, although the course, severity, and response to treatment of infection 
were unaltered. The helminth infection rate in the overall clinical programme, which was not designed 
to detect such infections, was less than 1 in 1 000 patients. However, caution may be warranted in 
patients at high risk of helminth infection, in particular when travelling to areas where helminthic 
infections are endemic. If patients do not respond to recommended anti-helminth treatment, 
discontinuation of omalizumab should be considered. 
Latex-sensitive individuals (pre-filled syringe) 
The removable needle cap of this pre-filled syringe contains a derivative of natural rubber latex. No 
natural rubber latex has to date been detected in the removable needle cap. Nevertheless, the use of 
Xolair solution for injection in pre-filled syringe in latex-sensitive individuals has not been studied and 
thus there is a potential risk for hypersensitivity reactions which cannot be completely ruled out. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Since IgE may be involved in the immunological response to some helminth infections, omalizumab 
may indirectly reduce the efficacy of medicinal products for the treatment of helminthic or other 
parasitic infections (see section 4.4). 
Cytochrome P450 enzymes, efflux pumps and protein-binding mechanisms are not involved in the 
clearance of omalizumab; thus, there is little potential for interactions. Medicinal product or vaccine 
interaction studies have not been performed with omalizumab. There is no pharmacological reason to 
expect that commonly prescribed medicinal products used in the treatment of asthma, CRSwNP or 
CSU will interact with omalizumab. 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Allergic asthma 
In clinical studies omalizumab was commonly used in conjunction with inhaled and oral 
corticosteroids, inhaled short-acting and long-acting beta agonists, leukotriene modifiers, 
theophyllines and oral antihistamines. There was no indication that the safety of omalizumab was 
altered with these other commonly used anti-asthma medicinal products. Limited data are available on 
the use of omalizumab in combination with specific immunotherapy (hypo-sensitisation therapy). In a 
clinical trial where omalizumab was co-administered with immunotherapy, the safety and efficacy of 
omalizumab in combination with specific immunotherapy were found to be no different to that of 
omalizumab alone. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 
In clinical studies omalizumab was used in conjunction with intranasal mometasone spray as per 
protocol. Other commonly used concomitant medicinal products included other intranasal 
corticosteroids, bronchodilators antihistamines, leukotriene receptor antagonists, 
adrenergics/sympathomimetics and local nasal anesthetics. There was no indication that the safety of 
omalizumab was altered by the concomitant use of these other commonly used medicinal products. 
Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) 
In clinical studies in CSU, omalizumab was used in conjunction with antihistamines (anti-H1, anti-H2) 
and leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs). There was no evidence that the safety of omalizumab 
was altered when used with these medicinal products relative to its known safety profile in allergic 
asthma. In addition, a population pharmacokinetic analysis showed no relevant effect of H2 
antihistamines and LTRAs on omalizumab pharmacokinetics (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
Clinical studies in CSU included some patients aged 12 to 17 years taking omalizumab in conjunction 
with antihistamines (anti-H1, anti-H2) and LTRAs. No studies have been performed in children under 
12 years. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
A moderate amount of data on pregnant women (between 300-1 000 pregnancy outcomes) based on 
pregnancy registry and post-marketing spontaneous reports, indicates no malformative or 
foeto/neonatal toxicity. A prospective pregnancy registry study (EXPECT) in 250 pregnant women 
with asthma exposed to omalizumab showed the prevalence of major congenital anomalies was similar 
(8.1% vs. 8.9%) between EXPECT and disease-matched (moderate and severe asthma) patients. The 
interpretation of data may be impacted due to methodological limitations of the study, including small 
sample size and non-randomised design. 
Omalizumab crosses the placental barrier. However, animal studies do not indicate either direct or 
indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Omalizumab has been associated with age-dependent decreases in blood platelets in non-human 
primates, with a greater relative sensitivity in juvenile animals (see section 5.3). 
If clinically needed, the use of omalizumab may be considered during pregnancy. 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Breast-feeding 
Immunoglobulins G (IgGs) are present in human milk and therefore it is expected that omalizumab 
will be present in human milk. Available data in non-human primates have shown excretion of 
omalizumab into milk (see section 5.3). 
The EXPECT study, with 154 infants who had been exposed to omalizumab during pregnancy and 
through breast-feeding did not indicate adverse effects on the breast-fed infant. The interpretation of 
data may be impacted due to methodological limitations of the study, including small sample size and 
non-randomised design. 
Given orally, immunoglobulin G proteins undergo intestinal proteolysis and have poor bioavailability. 
No effects on the breast-fed newborns/infants are anticipated. Consequently, if clinically needed, the 
use of omalizumab may be considered during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
There are no human fertility data for omalizumab. In specifically-designed non-clinical fertility 
studies, in non-human primates including mating studies, no impairment of male or female fertility 
was observed following repeated dosing with omalizumab at dose levels up to 75 mg/kg. Furthermore, 
no genotoxic effects were observed in a separate non-clinical genotoxicity study. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Omalizumab has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Allergic asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 
Summary of the safety profile 
During allergic asthma clinical trials in adult and adolescent patients 12 years of age and older, the 
most commonly reported adverse reactions were headaches and injection site reactions, including 
injection site pain, swelling, erythema and pruritus. In clinical trials in children 6 to <12 years of age, 
the most commonly reported adverse reactions were headache, pyrexia and upper abdominal pain. 
Most of the reactions were mild or moderate in severity. In clinical trials in patients ≥18 years of age 
in CRSwNP, the most commonly reported adverse reactions were headache, dizziness, arthralgia, 
abdominal pain upper and injection site reactions.

Summary of the safety profile 
The safety and tolerability of omalizumab were investigated with doses of 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg 
every four weeks in 975 CSU patients, 242 of whom received placebo. Overall, 733 patients were 
treated with omalizumab for up to 12 weeks and 490 patients for up to 24 weeks. Of those, 
412 patients were treated for up to 12 weeks and 333 patients were treated for up to 24 weeks at the 
300 mg dose. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
A separate table (Table 5) shows the adverse reactions for the CSU indication resulting from 
differences in dose and treatment populations (with significantly different risk factors, comorbidities, 
concomitant medicinal products and ages [e.g. asthma trials included children from 6-12 years of 
age]). 
Table 5 lists the adverse reactions (events occurring in ≥1% of patients in any treatment group and 
≥2% more frequently in any omalizumab treatment group than with placebo (after medical review)) 
reported with 300 mg in the three pooled phase III studies. The adverse reactions presented are divided 
into two groups: those identified in the 12-week and the 24-week treatment periods. 
The adverse reactions are listed by MedDRA system organ class. Within each system organ class, the 
adverse reactions are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions listed first. The 
corresponding frequency category for each adverse reaction is based on the following convention: 
very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1 000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10 000 
to <1/1 000); very rare (<1/10 000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

For further information, see section 4.4. 
Anaphylaxis 
Anaphylactic reactions were rare in clinical trials. However, post-marketing data following a 
cumulative search in the safety database retrieved a total of 898 anaphylaxis cases. Based on an 
estimated exposure of 566 923 patient treatment years, this results in a reporting rate of approximately 
0.20%. 
Arterial thromboembolic events (ATE) 
In controlled clinical trials and during interim analyses of an observational study, a numerical 
imbalance of ATE was observed. The definition of the composite endpoint ATE included stroke, 
transient ischaemic attack, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and cardiovascular death (including 
death from unknown cause). In the final analysis of the observational study, the rate of ATE per 1 000 
patient years was 7.52 (115/15 286 patient years) for Xolair-treated patients and 5.12 (51/9 963 patient 
years) for control patients. In a multivariate analysis controlling for available baseline cardiovascular 
risk factors, the hazard ratio was 1.32 (95% confidence interval 0.91-1.91). In a separate analysis of 
pooled clinical trials, which included all randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials 
lasting 8 or more weeks, the rate of ATE per 1 000 patient years was 2.69 (5/1 856 patient years) for 
Xolair-treated patients and 2.38 (4/1 680 patient years) for placebo patients (rate ratio 1.13, 95% 
confidence interval 0.24-5.71). 
Platelets 
In clinical trials few patients had platelet counts below the lower limit of the normal laboratory range. 
Isolated cases of idiopathic thrombocytopenia, including severe cases, have been reported in the post-
marketing setting. 
Parasitic infections 
In allergic patients at chronic high risk of helminth infection, a placebo-controlled trial showed a slight 
numerical increase in infection rate with omalizumab that was not statistically significant. The course, 
severity, and response to treatment of infections were unaltered (see section 4.4). 
Systemic lupus erythematosus 
Clinical trial and post-marketing cases of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in 
patients with moderate to severe asthma and CSU. The pathogenesis of SLE is not well understood. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Maximum tolerated dose of Xolair has not been determined. Single intravenous doses up to 4 000 mg 
have been administered to patients without evidence of dose-limiting toxicities. The highest 
cumulative dose administered to patients was 44 000 mg over a 20-week period and this dose did not 
result in any untoward acute effects. 
If an overdose is suspected, the patient should be monitored for any abnormal signs or symptoms. 
Medical treatment should be sought and instituted appropriately.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airway diseases, other systemic drugs for 
obstructive airway diseases, ATC code: R03DX05 
Allergic asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 
Mechanism of action 
Omalizumab is a recombinant DNA-derived humanised monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to 
human immunoglobulin E (IgE) and prevents binding of IgE to FceRI (high-affinity IgE receptor) on 
basophils and mast cells, thereby reducing the amount of free IgE that is available to trigger the 
allergic cascade. The antibody is an IgG1 kappa that contains human framework regions with the 
complementary-determining regions of a murine parent antibody that binds to IgE. 
Treatment of atopic subjects with omalizumab resulted in a marked down-regulation of FcRI 
receptors on basophils. Omalizumab inhibits IgE-mediated inflammation, as evidenced by reduced 
blood and tissue eosinophils and reduced inflammatory mediators, including IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 by 
innate, adaptive and non-immune cells. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Allergic asthma 
The in vitro histamine release from basophils isolated from omalizumab-treated subjects was reduced 
by approximately 90% following stimulation with an allergen compared to pre-treatment values. 
In clinical studies in allergic asthma patients, serum free IgE levels were reduced in a dose-dependent 
manner within one hour following the first dose and maintained between doses. One year after 
discontinuation of omalizumab dosing, the IgE levels had returned to pre-treatment levels with no 
observed rebound in IgE levels after washout of the medicinal product. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 
In clinical studies in patients with CRSwNP, omalizumab treatment led to a reduction in serum free 
IgE (approx. 95%) and an increase in serum total IgE levels, to a similar extent as observed in patients 
with allergic asthma. Total IgE levels in serum increased due to the formation of omalizumab-IgE 
complexes that have a slower elimination rate compared with free IgE. 
Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) 
Mechanism of action 
Omalizumab is a recombinant DNA-derived humanised monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to 
human immunoglobulin E (IgE) and lowers free IgE levels. The antibody is an IgG1 kappa that 
contains human framework regions with the complementary-determining regions of a murine parent 
antibody that binds to IgE. Subsequently, IgE receptors (FcεRI) on cells down-regulate. It is not 
entirely understood how this results in an improvement of CSU symptoms. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
In clinical studies in CSU patients, maximum suppression of free IgE was observed 3 days after the 
first subcutaneous dose. After repeated dosing once every 4 weeks, pre-dose serum free IgE levels 
remained stable between 12 and 24 weeks of treatment. After discontinuation of omalizumab, free IgE 
levels increased towards pre-treatment levels over a 16-week treatment-free follow-up period.

Clinical efficacy and safety 
Allergic asthma 
Adults and adolescents ≥12 years of age 
The efficacy and safety of omalizumab were demonstrated in a 28-week double-blind placebo-
controlled study (study 1) involving 419 severe allergic asthmatics, ages 12-79 years, who had reduced 
lung function (FEV1 40-80% predicted) and poor asthma symptom control despite receiving high dose 
inhaled corticosteroids and a long-acting beta2-agonist. Eligible patients had experienced multiple 
asthma exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroid treatment or had been hospitalised or attended 
an emergency room due to a severe asthma exacerbation in the past year despite continuous treatment 
with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and a long-acting beta2-agonist. Subcutaneous omalizumab or 
placebo were administered as add-on therapy to >1 000 micrograms beclomethasone dipropionate (or 
equivalent) plus a long-acting beta2-agonist. Oral corticosteroid, theophylline and leukotriene-
modifier maintenance therapies were allowed (22%, 27%, and 35% of patients, respectively). 
The rate of asthma exacerbations requiring treatment with bursts of systemic corticosteroids was the 
primary endpoint. Omalizumab reduced the rate of asthma exacerbations by 19% (p = 0.153). Further 
evaluations which did show statistical significance (p<0.05) in favour of omalizumab included 
reductions in severe exacerbations (where patient’s lung function was reduced to below 60% of 
personal best and requiring systemic corticosteroids) and asthma-related emergency visits (comprised 
of hospitalisations, emergency room, and unscheduled doctor visits), and improvements in Physician’s 
overall assessment of treatment effectiveness, Asthma-related Quality of Life (AQL), asthma 
symptoms and lung function. 
In a subgroup analysis, patients with pre-treatment total IgE ≥76 IU/ml were more likely to experience 
clinically meaningful benefit to omalizumab. In these patients in study 1 omalizumab reduced the rate 
of asthma exacerbations by 40% (p = 0.002). In addition more patients had clinically meaningful 
responses in the total IgE ≥76 IU/ml population across the omalizumab severe asthma programme.

Study 2 assessed the efficacy and safety of omalizumab in a population of 312 severe allergic 
asthmatics which matched the population in study 1. Treatment with omalizumab in this open label 
study led to a 61% reduction in clinically significant asthma exacerbation rate compared to current 
asthma therapy alone.

Four additional large placebo-controlled supportive studies of 28 to 52 weeks duration in 1 722 adults 
and adolescents (studies 3, 4, 5, 6) assessed the efficacy and safety of omalizumab in patients with 
severe persistent asthma. Most patients were inadequately controlled but were receiving less 
concomitant asthma therapy than patients in studies 1 or 2. Studies 3-5 used exacerbation as primary 
endpoint, whereas study 6 primarily evaluated inhaled corticosteroid sparing. 
In studies 3, 4 and 5 patients treated with omalizumab had respective reductions in asthma 
exacerbation rates of 37.5% (p = 0.027), 40.3% (p<0.001) and 57.6% (p<0.001) compared to placebo. 
In study 6, significantly more severe allergic asthma patients on omalizumab were able to reduce their 
fluticasone dose to 500 micrograms/day without deterioration of asthma control (60.3%) compared to 
the placebo group (45.8%, p<0.05). 
Quality of life scores were measured using the Juniper Asthma-related Quality of Life Questionnaire. 
For all six studies there was a statistically significant improvement from baseline in quality of life 
scores for omalizumab patients versus the placebo or control group. 
Physician’s overall assessment of treatment effectiveness: 
Physician’s overall assessment was performed in five of the above studies as a broad measure of 
asthma control performed by the treating physician. The physician was able to take into account PEF 
(peak expiratory flow), day and night time symptoms, rescue medicinal product use, spirometry and 
exacerbations. In all five studies a significantly greater proportion of omalizumab-treated patients 
were judged to have achieved either a marked improvement or complete control of their asthma 
compared to placebo patients. 
Children 6 to <12 years of age 
The primary support for safety and efficacy of omalizumab in the group aged 6 to <12 years comes 
from one randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre trial (study 7). 
Study 7 was a placebo-controlled trial which included a specific subgroup (n=235) of patients as 
defined in the present indication, who were treated with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids 
(≥500 µg/day fluticasone equivalent) plus long-acting beta agonist. 
A clinically significant exacerbation was defined as a worsening of asthma symptoms as judged 
clinically by the investigator, requiring doubling of the baseline inhaled corticosteroid dose for at least 
3 days and/or treatment with rescue systemic (oral or intravenous) corticosteroids for at least 3 days. 
In the specific subgroup of patients on high dose inhaled corticosteroids, the omalizumab group had a 
statistically significantly lower rate of clinically significant asthma exacerbations than the placebo 
group. At 24 weeks, the difference in rates between treatment groups represented a 34% (rate ratio 
0.662, p = 0.047) decrease relative to placebo for omalizumab patients. In the second double-blind 28-
week treatment period the difference in rates between treatment groups represented a 63% (rate ratio 
0.37, p<0.001) decrease relative to placebo for omalizumab patients. 
During the 52-week double-blind treatment period (including the 24-week fixed-dose steroid phase 
and the 28-week steroid adjustment phase) the difference in rates between treatment groups 
represented a 50% (rate ratio 0.504, p<0.001) relative decrease in exacerbations for omalizumab 
patients. 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The omalizumab group showed greater decreases in beta-agonist rescue medicinal product use than 
the placebo group at the end of the 52-week treatment period, although the difference between 
treatment groups was not statistically significant. For the global evaluation of treatment effectiveness 
at the end of the 52-week double-blind treatment period in the subgroup of severe patients on high-
dose inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting beta agonists, the proportion of patients rated as having 
‘excellent’ treatment effectiveness was higher, and the proportions having ‘moderate’ or ‘poor’ 
treatment effectiveness lower in the omalizumab group compared to the placebo group; the difference 
between groups was statistically significant (p<0.001), while there were no differences between the 
omalizumab and placebo groups for patients’ subjective Quality of Life ratings. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 
The safety and efficacy of omalizumab were evaluated in two randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled trials in patients with CRSwNP (Table 8). Patients received omalizumab or placebo 
subcutaneously every 2 or 4 weeks (see section 4.2). All patients received background intranasal 
mometasone therapy throughout the study. Prior sino-nasal surgery or prior systemic corticosteroid 
usage were not required for inclusion in the studies. Patients received omalizumab or placebo for 
24 weeks followed by a 4-week follow-up period. Demographics and baseline characteristics, 
including allergic comorbidities, are described in Table 7.

In a pre-specified pooled analysis of rescue treatment (systemic corticosteroids for 3 consecutive 
days or nasal polypectomy) during the 24-week treatment period, the proportion of patients requiring 
rescue treatment was lower in omalizumab compared to placebo (2.3% versus 6.2%, respectively). 
The odds-ratio of having taken rescue treatment in omalizumab compared to placebo was 0.38 (95% 
CI: 0.10, 1.49). There were no sino-nasal surgeries reported in either study. 
The long-term efficacy and safety of omalizumab in patients with CRSwNP who had participated in 
nasal polyp studies 1 and 2 was assessed in an open-label extension study. Efficacy data from this 
study suggest that clinical benefit provided at Week 24 was sustained through to Week 52. Safety data 
were overall consistent with the known safety profile of omalizumab. 
Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) 
The efficacy and safety of omalizumab were demonstrated in two randomised, placebo-controlled 
phase III studies (study 1 and 2) in patients with CSU who remained symptomatic despite H1 
antihistamine therapy at the approved dose. A third study (study 3) primarily evaluated the safety of 
omalizumab in patients with CSU who remained symptomatic despite treatment with H1 
antihistamines at up to four times the approved dose and H2 antihistamine and/or LTRA treatment. 
The three studies enrolled 975 patients aged between 12 and 75 years (mean age 42.3 years; 
39 patients 12-17 years, 54 patients ≥65 years; 259 males and 716 females). All patients were required 
to have inadequate symptom control, as assessed by a weekly urticaria activity score (UAS7, range 
0-42) of ≥16, and a weekly itch severity score (which is a component of the UAS7; range 0-21) of ≥8 
for the 7 days prior to randomisation, despite having used an antihistamine for at least 2 weeks 
beforehand. 
In studies 1 and 2, patients had a mean weekly itch severity score of between 13.7 and 14.5 at baseline 
and a mean UAS7 score of 29.5 and 31.7 respectively. Patients in safety study 3 had a mean weekly 
itch severity score of 13.8 and a mean UAS7 score of 31.2 at baseline. Across all three studies, 
patients reported receiving on average 4 to 6 medicinal products (including H1 antihistamines) for 
CSU symptoms prior to study enrollment. Patients received omalizumab at 75 mg, 150 mg or 300 mg 
or placebo by subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks for 24 and 12 weeks in studies 1 and 2, 
respectively, and 300 mg or placebo by subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks for 24 weeks in study 3. 
All studies had a 16-week treatment-free follow-up period.

The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to week 12 in weekly itch severity score. 
Omalizumab at 300 mg reduced the weekly itch severity score by 8.55 to 9.77 (p <0.0001) compared 
to a reduction of 3.63 to 5.14 for placebo (see Table 9). Statistically significant results were further 
observed in the responder rates for UAS7≤6 (at week 12) which were higher for the 300 mg treatment 
groups, ranging from 52-66% (p<0.0001) compared to 11-19% for the placebo groups, and complete 
response (UAS7=0) was achieved by 34-44% (p<0.0001) of patients treated with 300 mg compared to 
5-9% of patients in the placebo groups. Patients in the 300 mg treatment groups achieved the highest 
mean proportion of angioedema-free days from week 4 to week 12, (91.0-96.1%; p<0.001) compared 
to the placebo groups (88.1-89.2%). Mean change from baseline to week 12 in the overall DLQI for 
the 300 mg treatment groups was greater (p<0.001) than for placebo showing an improvement ranging 
from 9.7-10.3 points compared to 5.1-6.1 points for the corresponding placebo groups.

*Modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population: included all patients who were randomised and received 
at least one dose of study medicinal product. 
BOCF (Baseline Observation Carried Forward) was used to impute missing data. 
1 The LS mean was estimated using an ANCOVA model. The strata were baseline weekly itch severity 
score (<13 vs. ≥13) and baseline weight (<80 kg vs. ≥80 kg). 
2 p-value is derived from ANCOVA t-test. 
Figure 2 shows the mean weekly itch severity score over time in study 1. The mean weekly itch 
severity scores significantly decreased with a maximum effect around week 12 that was sustained over 
the 24-week treatment period. The results were similar in study 3. 
In all three studies the mean weekly itch severity score increased gradually during the 16-week 
treatment-free follow-up period, consistent with symptom re-occurrence. Mean values at the end of the 
follow-up period were similar to the placebo group, but lower than respective mean baseline values.

Omalizumab or placebo administered 
BOCF=baseline observation carried forward; mITT=modified intention-to-treat population 
The magnitude of the efficacy outcomes observed at week 24 of treatment was comparable to that 
observed at week 12: 
For 300 mg, in studies 1 and 3, the mean decrease from baseline in weekly itch severity score was 9.8 
and 8.6, the proportion of patients with UAS7≤6 was 61.7% and 55.6%, and the proportion of patients 
with complete response (UAS7=0) was 48.1% and 42.5%, respectively, (all p<0.0001, when compared 
to placebo). 
Clinical trial data on adolescents (12 to 17 years) included a total of 39 patients, of whom 11 received 
the 300 mg dose. Results for the 300 mg are available for 9 patients at week 12 and 6 patients at 
week 24, and show a similar magnitude of response to omalizumab treatment compared to the adult 
population. Mean change from baseline in weekly itch severity score showed a reduction of 8.25 at 
week 12 and of 8.95 at week 24. The responder rates were: 33% at week 12 and 67% at week 24 for 
UAS7=0, and 56% at week 12 and 67% at week 24 for UAS7≤6. 
In a 48-week study, 206 patients aged between 12 and 75 years were enrolled into a 24-week 
open-label treatment period of omalizumab 300 mg every 4 weeks. Patients who responded to 
treatment in this open-label period were then randomised to receive omalizumab 300 mg (81 patients) 
or placebo (53 patients) every 4 weeks for an additional 24 weeks. 
Of the patients who remained on omalizumab treatment for 48 weeks, 21% experienced clinical 
worsening (UAS7 score 12 for at least 2 consecutive weeks post-randomisation between weeks 24 
and 48), versus 60.4% of those treated with placebo at week 48 (difference ˗39.4%, p<0.0001, 95% 
CI: −54.5%, −22.5%). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics of omalizumab have been studied in adult and adolescent patients with allergic 
asthma as well as in adult patients with CRSwNP, and adult and adolescent patients with CSU. The 
general pharmacokinetic characteristics of omalizumab are similar in these patient populations. 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Absorption 
After subcutaneous administration, omalizumab is absorbed with an average absolute bioavailability 
of 62%. Following a single subcutaneous dose in adult and adolescent patients with asthma or CSU, 
omalizumab was absorbed slowly, reaching peak serum concentrations after an average of 6-8 days. In 
patients with asthma, following multiple doses of omalizumab, areas under the serum concentration-
time curve from Day 0 to Day 14 at steady state were up to 6-fold of those after the first dose. 
The pharmacokinetics of omalizumab are linear at doses greater than 0.5 mg/kg. Following doses of 
75 mg, 150 mg or 300 mg every 4 weeks in patients with CSU, trough serum concentrations of 
omalizumab increased proportionally with the dose level. 
Administration of Xolair manufactured as a lyophilised or liquid formulation resulted in similar serum 
concentration-time profiles of omalizumab. 
Distribution 
In vitro, omalizumab forms complexes of limited size with IgE. Precipitating complexes and 
complexes larger than one million Daltons in molecular weight are not observed in vitro or in vivo. 
Based on population pharmacokinetics, distribution of omalizumab was similar in patients with 
allergic asthma and patients with CSU. The apparent volume of distribution in patients with asthma 
following subcutaneous administration was 78 ± 32 ml/kg. 
Elimination 
Clearance of omalizumab involves IgG clearance processes as well as clearance via specific binding 
and complex formation with its target ligand, IgE. Liver elimination of IgG includes degradation in the 
reticuloendothelial system and endothelial cells. Intact IgG is also excreted in bile. In asthma patients 
the omalizumab serum elimination half-life averaged 26 days, with apparent clearance averaging 
2.4  1.1 ml/kg/day. Doubling of body weight approximately doubled apparent clearance. In CSU 
patients, based on population pharmacokinetic simulations, omalizumab serum elimination half-life at 
steady state averaged 24 days and apparent clearance at steady state for a patient of 80 kg weight was 
3.0 ml/kg/day. 
Characteristics in patient populations 
Age, Race/ethnicity, Gender, Body Mass Index 
Patients with allergic asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 
The population pharmacokinetics of omalizumab were analysed to evaluate the effects of demographic 
characteristics. Analyses of these limited data suggest that no dose adjustments are necessary for age 
(6-76 years for patients with allergic asthma; 18 to 75 for patients with CRSwNP), race/ethnicity, 
gender or body mass index (see section 4.2). 
Patients with CSU 
The effects of demographic characteristics and other factors on omalizumab exposure were evaluated 
based on population pharmacokinetics. In addition, covariate effects were evaluated by analysing the 
relationship between omalizumab concentrations and clinical responses. These analyses suggest that 
no dose adjustments are necessary in patients with CSU for age (12-75 years), race/ethnicity, gender, 
body weight, body mass index, baseline IgE, anti-FcRI autoantibodies or concomitant use of H2 
antihistamines or LTRAs. 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
There are no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic data in allergic asthma or CSU patients with renal 
or hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
The safety of omalizumab has been studied in the cynomolgus monkey, since omalizumab binds to 
cynomolgus and human IgE with similar affinity. Antibodies to omalizumab were detected in some 
monkeys following repeated subcutaneous or intravenous administration. However, no apparent 
toxicity, such as immune complex-mediated disease or complement-dependent cytotoxicity, was seen. 
There was no evidence of an anaphylactic response due to mast-cell degranulation in cynomolgus 
monkeys. 
Chronic administration of omalizumab at dose levels of up to 250 mg/kg (at least 14 times the highest 
recommended clinical dose in mg/kg according to the recommended dosing table) was well tolerated 
in non-human primates (both adult and juvenile animals), with the exception of a dose-related and age-
dependent decrease in blood platelets, with a greater sensitivity in juvenile animals. The serum 
concentration required to attain a 50% drop in platelets from baseline in adult cynomolgus monkeys 
was roughly 4- to 20-fold higher than anticipated maximum clinical serum concentrations. In addition, 
acute haemorrhage and inflammation were observed at injection sites in cynomolgus monkeys. 
Formal carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with omalizumab. 
In reproduction studies in cynomolgus monkeys, subcutaneous doses up to 75 mg/kg per week (at least 
8 times the highest recommended clinical dose in mg/kg over a 4-week period) did not elicit maternal 
toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity when administered throughout organogenesis and did not 
elicit adverse effects on foetal or neonatal growth when administered throughout late gestation, 
delivery and nursing. 
Omalizumab is excreted in breast milk in cynomolgus monkeys. Milk levels of omalizumab were 
0.15% of the maternal serum concentration.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Allergic asthma 
Xolair is indicated in adults, adolescents and children (6 to <12 years of age). 
Xolair treatment should only be considered for patients with convincing IgE (immunoglobulin E) 
mediated asthma (see section 4.2). 
Adults and adolescents (12 years of age and older) 
Xolair is indicated as add-on therapy to improve asthma control in patients with severe persistent 
allergic asthma who have a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen and who 
have reduced lung function (FEV1 <80%) as well as frequent daytime symptoms or night-time 
awakenings and who have had multiple documented severe asthma exacerbations despite daily high-
dose inhaled corticosteroids, plus a long-acting inhaled beta2-agonist. 
Children (6 to <12 years of age) 
Xolair is indicated as add-on therapy to improve asthma control in patients with severe persistent 
allergic asthma who have a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen and 
frequent daytime symptoms or night-time awakenings and who have had multiple documented severe 
asthma exacerbations despite daily high-dose inhaled corticosteroids, plus a long-acting inhaled beta2-
agonist. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 
Xolair is indicated as an add-on therapy with intranasal corticosteroids (INC) for the treatment of 
adults (18 years and above) with severe CRSwNP for whom therapy with INC does not provide 
adequate disease control.

4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of severe 
persistent asthma or chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). 
Posology 
Dosing for allergic asthma and CRSwNP follows the same dosing principles. The appropriate dose 
and frequency of omalizumab for these conditions is determined by baseline IgE (IU/ml), measured 
before the start of treatment, and body weight (kg). Prior to administration of the initial dose, patients 
should have their IgE level determined by any commercial serum total IgE assay for their dose 
assignment. Based on these measurements, 75 to 600 mg of omalizumab in 1 to 4 injections may be 
needed for each administration. 
Allergic asthma patients with baseline IgE lower than 76 IU/ml were less likely to experience benefit 
(see section 5.1). Prescribing physicians should ensure that adult and adolescent patients with IgE 
below 76 IU/ml and children (6 to < 12 years of age) with IgE below 200 IU/ml have unequivocal in 
vitro reactivity (RAST) to a perennial allergen before starting therapy. 
See Table 1 for a conversion chart and Tables 2 and 3 for the dose determination charts. 
Patients whose baseline IgE levels or body weight in kilograms are outside the limits of the dose table 
should not be given omalizumab. 
The maximum recommended dose is 600 mg omalizumab every two weeks.

Treatment duration, monitoring and dose adjustments 
Allergic asthma 
Xolair is intended for long-term treatment. Clinical trials have demonstrated that it takes at least 
12-16 weeks for the treatment to show effectiveness. At 16 weeks after commencing Xolair therapy 
patients should be assessed by their physician for treatment effectiveness before further injections are 
administered. The decision to continue treatment following the 16-week timepoint, or on subsequent 
occasions, should be based on whether a marked improvement in overall asthma control is seen (see 
section 5.1, Physician’s overall assessment of treatment effectiveness). 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 
In clinical trials for CRSwNP, changes in nasal polyps score (NPS) and nasal congestion score (NCS) 
were observed at 4 weeks. The need for continued therapy should be periodically reassessed based 
upon the patient’s disease severity and level of symptom control. 
Allergic asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 
Discontinuation of treatment generally results in a return to elevated free IgE levels and associated 
symptoms. Total IgE levels are elevated during treatment and remain elevated for up to one year after 
the discontinuation of treatment. Therefore, re-testing of IgE levels during treatment cannot be used as 
a guide for dose determination. Dose determination after treatment interruptions lasting less than one 
year should be based on serum IgE levels obtained at the initial dose determination. Total serum IgE 
levels may be re-tested for dose determination if treatment has been interrupted for one year or more. 
Doses should be adjusted for significant changes in body weight (see Tables 2 and 3). 
Special populations 
Elderly (65 years of age and older) 
There are limited data available on the use of omalizumab in patients older than 65 years but there is 
no evidence that elderly patients require a different dose from younger adult patients. 
Renal or hepatic impairment 
There have been no studies on the effect of impaired renal or hepatic function on the pharmacokinetics 
of omalizumab. Because omalizumab clearance at clinical doses is dominated by the reticular 
endothelial system (RES) it is unlikely to be altered by renal or hepatic impairment. While no 
particular dose adjustment is recommended for these patients, omalizumab should be administered 
with caution (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
In allergic asthma, the safety and efficacy of omalizumab in patients below the age of 6 years have not 
been established. No data are available. 
In CRSwNP, the safety and efficacy of omalizumab in patients below the age of 18 years have not 
been established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
For subcutaneous administration only. Omalizumab must not be administered by the intravenous or 
intramuscular route. 
Doses of more than 150 mg (Table 1) should be divided across two or more injection sites. 
Xolair powder and solvent for solution for injection is intended to be administered by a healthcare 
provider only. 
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6 and 
also information for the healthcare professional section of the package leaflet.

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
General 
Omalizumab is not indicated for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations, acute bronchospasm or 
status asthmaticus. 
Omalizumab has not been studied in patients with hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome or allergic 
bronchopulmonary aspergillosis or for the prevention of anaphylactic reactions, including those 
provoked by food allergy, atopic dermatitis, or allergic rhinitis. Omalizumab is not indicated for the 
treatment of these conditions. 
Omalizumab therapy has not been studied in patients with autoimmune diseases, immune complex-
mediated conditions, or pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). Caution should be 
exercised when administering omalizumab in these patient populations. 
Abrupt discontinuation of systemic or inhaled corticosteroids after initiation of omalizumab therapy in 
allergic asthma or CRSwNP is not recommended. Decreases in corticosteroids should be performed 
under the direct supervision of a physician and may need to be performed gradually. 
Immune system disorders 
Allergic reactions type I 
Type I local or systemic allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock, may occur 
when taking omalizumab, even after a long duration of treatment. However, most of these reactions 
occurred within 2 hours after the first and subsequent injections of omalizumab but some started 
beyond 2 hours and even beyond 24 hours after the injection. The majority of anaphylactic reactions 
occurred within the first 3 doses of omalizumab. A history of anaphylaxis unrelated to omalizumab 
may be a risk factor for anaphylaxis following omalizumab administration. Therefore medicinal 
products for the treatment of anaphylactic reactions should always be available for immediate use 
following administration of omalizumab. If an anaphylactic or other serious allergic reaction occurs, 
administration of omalizumab must be discontinued immediately, and appropriate therapy initiated. 
Patients should be informed that such reactions are possible, and prompt medical attention should be 
sought if allergic reactions occur. 
Antibodies to omalizumab have been detected in a low number of patients in clinical trials (see 
section 4.8). The clinical relevance of anti-omalizumab antibodies is not well understood. 
Serum sickness 
Serum sickness and serum sickness-like reactions, which are delayed allergic type III reactions, have 
been seen in patients treated with humanised monoclonal antibodies including omalizumab. The 
suggested pathophysiologic mechanism includes immune-complex formation and deposition due to 
development of antibodies against omalizumab. The onset has typically been 1-5 days after 
administration of the first or subsequent injections, also after long duration of treatment. Symptoms 
suggestive of serum sickness include arthritis/arthralgias, rash (urticaria or other forms), fever and 
lymphadenopathy. Antihistamines and corticosteroids may be useful for preventing or treating this 
disorder, and patients should be advised to report any suspected symptoms. 
53 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Churg-Strauss syndrome and hypereosinophilic syndrome 
Patients with severe asthma may rarely present systemic hypereosinophilic syndrome or allergic 
eosinophilic granulomatous vasculitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome), both of which are usually treated 
with systemic corticosteroids. 
In rare cases, patients on therapy with anti-asthma medicinal products, including omalizumab, may 
present or develop systemic eosinophilia and vasculitis. These events are commonly associated with 
the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. 
In these patients, physicians should be alert to the development of marked eosinophilia, vasculitic 
rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, paranasal sinus abnormalities, cardiac complications, and/or 
neuropathy. 
Discontinuation of omalizumab should be considered in all severe cases with the above mentioned 
immune system disorders. 
Parasitic (helminth) infections 
IgE may be involved in the immunological response to some helminth infections. In patients at chronic 
high risk of helminth infection, a placebo-controlled trial showed a slight increase in infection rate 
with omalizumab, although the course, severity, and response to treatment of infection were unaltered. 
The helminth infection rate in the overall clinical programme, which was not designed to detect such 
infections, was less than 1 in 1 000 patients. However, caution may be warranted in patients at high 
risk of helminth infection, in particular when travelling to areas where helminthic infections are 
endemic. If patients do not respond to recommended anti-helminth treatment, discontinuation of 
omalizumab should be considered. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Since IgE may be involved in the immunological response to some helminth infections, omalizumab 
may indirectly reduce the efficacy of medicinal products for the treatment of helminthic or other 
parasitic infections (see section 4.4). 
Cytochrome P450 enzymes, efflux pumps and protein-binding mechanisms are not involved in the 
clearance of omalizumab; thus, there is little potential for interactions. Medicinal product or vaccine 
interaction studies have not been performed with omalizumab. There is no pharmacological reason to 
expect that commonly prescribed medicinal products used in the treatment of asthma or CRSwNP will 
interact with omalizumab. 
Allergic asthma 
In clinical studies omalizumab was commonly used in conjunction with inhaled and oral 
corticosteroids, inhaled short-acting and long-acting beta agonists, leukotriene modifiers, 
theophyllines and oral antihistamines. There was no indication that the safety of omalizumab was 
altered with these other commonly used anti-asthma medicinal products. Limited data are available on 
the use of omalizumab in combination with specific immunotherapy (hypo-sensitisation therapy). In a 
clinical trial where omalizumab was co-administered with immunotherapy, the safety and efficacy of 
omalizumab in combination with specific immunotherapy were found to be no different to that of 
omalizumab alone. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 
In clinical studies omalizumab was used in conjunction with intranasal mometasone spray as per 
protocol. Other commonly used concomitant medicinal products included other intranasal 
corticosteroids, bronchodilators, antihistamines, leukotriene receptor antagonists, 
adrenergics/sympathomimetics and local nasal anaesthetics. There was no indication that the safety of 
omalizumab was altered by the concomitant use of these other commonly used medicinal products.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
A moderate amount of data on pregnant women (between 300-1 000 pregnancy outcomes) based on 
pregnancy registry and post-marketing spontaneous reports, indicates no malformative or 
foeto/neonatal toxicity. A prospective pregnancy registry study (EXPECT) in 250 pregnant women 
with asthma exposed to omalizumab showed the prevalence of major congenital anomalies was similar 
(8.1% vs. 8.9%) between EXPECT and disease-matched (moderate and severe asthma) patients. The 
interpretation of data may be impacted due to methodological limitations of the study, including small 
sample size and non-randomised design. 
Omalizumab crosses the placental barrier. However, animal studies do not indicate either direct or 
indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Omalizumab has been associated with age-dependent decreases in blood platelets in non-human 
primates, with a greater relative sensitivity in juvenile animals (see section 5.3). 
If clinically needed, the use of omalizumab may be considered during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
Immunoglobulins G (IgGs) are present in human milk and therefore it is expected that omalizumab 
will be present in human milk. Available data in non-human primates have shown excretion of 
omalizumab into milk (see section 5.3). 
The EXPECT study, with 154 infants who had been exposed to omalizumab during pregnancy and 
through breast-feeding did not indicate adverse effects on the breast-fed infant. The interpretation of 
data may be impacted due to methodological limitations of the study, including small sample size and 
non-randomised design. 
Given orally, immunoglobulin G proteins undergo intestinal proteolysis and have poor bioavailability. 
No effects on the breast-fed newborns/infants are anticipated. Consequently, if clinically needed, the 
use of omalizumab may be considered during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
There are no human fertility data for omalizumab. In specifically-designed non-clinical fertility studies 
in non-human primates, including mating studies, no impairment of male or female fertility was 
observed following repeated dosing with omalizumab at dose levels up to 75 mg/kg. Furthermore, no 
genotoxic effects were observed in a separate non-clinical genotoxicity study. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Omalizumab has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Allergic asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 
Summary of the safety profile 
During allergic asthma clinical trials in adult and adolescent patients 12 years of age and older, the 
most commonly reported adverse reactions were headaches and injection site reactions, including 
injection site pain, swelling, erythema and pruritus. In clinical trials in children 6 to <12 years of age, 
the most commonly reported adverse reactions were headache, pyrexia and upper abdominal pain. 
Most of the reactions were mild or moderate in severity. In clinical trials in patients ≥18 years of age 
55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in CRSwNP, the most commonly reported adverse reactions were headache, dizziness, arthralgia, 
abdominal pain upper and injection site reactions. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Table 4 lists the adverse reactions recorded in clinical studies in the total allergic asthma and CRSwNP 
safety population treated with Xolair by MedDRA system organ class and frequency. Within each 
frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Frequency 
categories are defined as: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1 000 to

Immune system disorders 
For further information, see section 4.4. 
Anaphylaxis 
Anaphylactic reactions were rare in clinical trials. However, post-marketing data following a 
cumulative search in the safety database retrieved a total of 898 anaphylaxis cases. Based on an 
estimated exposure of 566 923 patient treatment years, this results in a reporting rate of approximately 
0.20%. 
Arterial thromboembolic events (ATE) 
In controlled clinical trials and during interim analyses of an observational study, a numerical 
imbalance of ATE was observed. The definition of the composite endpoint ATE included stroke, 
transient ischaemic attack, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and cardiovascular death (including 
death from unknown cause). In the final analysis of the observational study, the rate of ATE per 1 000 
patient years was 7.52 (115/15 286 patient years) for Xolair-treated patients and 5.12 (51/9 963 patient 
years) for control patients. In a multivariate analysis controlling for available baseline cardiovascular 
risk factors, the hazard ratio was 1.32 (95% confidence interval 0.91-1.91). In a separate analysis of 
pooled clinical trials, which included all randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials 
lasting 8 or more weeks, the rate of ATE per 1 000 patient years was 2.69 (5/1 856 patient years) for 
Xolair-treated patients and 2.38 (4/1 680 patient years) for placebo patients (rate ratio 1.13, 95% 
confidence interval 0.24-5.71). 
Platelets 
In clinical trials few patients had platelet counts below the lower limit of the normal laboratory range. 
Isolated cases of idiopathic thrombocytopenia, including severe cases, have been reported in the post-
marketing setting. 
Parasitic infections 
In patients at chronic high risk of helminth infection, a placebo-controlled trial showed a slight 
numerical increase in infection rate with omalizumab that was not statistically significant. The course, 
severity, and response to treatment of infections were unaltered (see section 4.4). 
Systemic lupus erythematosus 
Clinical trial and post-marketing cases of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in 
patients with moderate to severe asthma and CSU. The pathogenesis of SLE is not well understood. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Maximum tolerated dose of Xolair has not been determined. Single intravenous doses up to 4 000 mg 
have been administered to patients without evidence of dose-limiting toxicities. The highest 
cumulative dose administered to patients was 44 000 mg over a 20-week period and this dose did not 
result in any untoward acute effects. 
If an overdose is suspected, the patient should be monitored for any abnormal signs or symptoms. 
Medical treatment should be sought and instituted appropriately.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airway diseases, other systemic drugs for 
obstructive airway diseases, ATC code: R03DX05 
Mechanism of action 
Omalizumab is a recombinant DNA-derived humanised monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to 
human immunoglobulin E (IgE) and prevents binding of IgE to FcRI (high-affinity IgE receptor) on 
basophils and mast cells, thereby reducing the amount of free IgE that is available to trigger the 
allergic cascade. The antibody is an IgG1 kappa that contains human framework regions with the 
complementary-determining regions of a murine parent antibody that binds to IgE. 
Treatment of atopic subjects with omalizumab resulted in a marked down-regulation of FcRI 
receptors on basophils. Omalizumab inhibits IgE-mediated inflammation, as evidenced by reduced 
blood and tissue eosinophils and reduced inflammatory mediators, including IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 by 
innate, adaptive and non-immune cells. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Allergic asthma 
The in vitro histamine release from basophils isolated from omalizumab-treated subjects was reduced 
by approximately 90% following stimulation with an allergen compared to pre-treatment values. 
In clinical studies in allergic asthma patients, serum free IgE levels were reduced in a dose-dependent 
manner within one hour following the first dose and maintained between doses. One year after 
discontinuation of omalizumab dosing, the IgE levels had returned to pre-treatment levels with no 
observed rebound in IgE levels after washout of the medicinal product. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 
In clinical studies in patients with CRSwNP, omalizumab treatment led to a reduction in serum free 
IgE (approx. 95%) and an increase in serum total IgE levels, to a similar extent as observed in patients 
with allergic asthma. Total IgE levels in serum increased due to the formation of omalizumab-IgE 
complexes that have a slower elimination rate compared with free IgE. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Allergic asthma 
Adults and adolescents ≥12 years of age 
The efficacy and safety of omalizumab were demonstrated in a 28-week double-blind placebo-
controlled study (study 1) involving 419 severe allergic asthmatics, ages 12-79 years, who had reduced 
lung function (FEV1 40-80% predicted) and poor asthma symptom control despite receiving high dose 
inhaled corticosteroids and a long-acting beta2-agonist. Eligible patients had experienced multiple 
asthma exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroid treatment or had been hospitalised or attended 
an emergency room due to a severe asthma exacerbation in the past year despite continuous treatment 
with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and a long-acting beta2-agonist. Subcutaneous omalizumab or 
placebo were administered as add-on therapy to >1 000 micrograms beclomethasone dipropionate (or 
equivalent) plus a long-acting beta2-agonist. Oral corticosteroid, theophylline and leukotriene-
modifier maintenance therapies were allowed (22%, 27%, and 35% of patients, respectively). 
58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The rate of asthma exacerbations requiring treatment with bursts of systemic corticosteroids was the 
primary endpoint. Omalizumab reduced the rate of asthma exacerbations by 19% (p = 0.153). Further 
evaluations which did show statistical significance (p<0.05) in favour of omalizumab included 
reductions in severe exacerbations (where patient’s lung function was reduced to below 60% of 
personal best and requiring systemic corticosteroids) and asthma-related emergency visits (comprised 
of hospitalisations, emergency room, and unscheduled doctor visits), and improvements in Physician’s 
overall assessment of treatment effectiveness, Asthma-related Quality of Life (AQL), asthma 
symptoms and lung function. 
In a subgroup analysis, patients with pre-treatment total IgE ≥76 IU/ml were more likely to experience 
clinically meaningful benefit to omalizumab. In these patients in study 1 omalizumab reduced the rate 
of asthma exacerbations by 40% (p = 0.002). In addition more patients had clinically meaningful 
responses in the total IgE ≥76 IU/ml population across the omalizumab severe asthma programme.

Study 2 assessed the efficacy and safety of omalizumab in a population of 312 severe allergic 
asthmatics which matched the population in study 1. Treatment with omalizumab in this open label 
study led to a 61% reduction in clinically significant asthma exacerbation rate compared to current 
asthma therapy alone. 
Four additional large placebo-controlled supportive studies of 28 to 52 weeks duration in 1,722 adults 
and adolescents (studies 3, 4, 5, 6) assessed the efficacy and safety of omalizumab in patients with 
severe persistent asthma. Most patients were inadequately controlled but were receiving less 
concomitant asthma therapy than patients in studies 1 or 2. Studies 3-5 used exacerbation as primary 
endpoint, whereas study 6 primarily evaluated inhaled corticosteroid sparing. 
In studies 3, 4 and 5 patients treated with omalizumab had respective reductions in asthma 
exacerbation rates of 37.5% (p = 0.027), 40.3% (p<0.001) and 57.6% (p<0.001) compared to placebo. 
In study 6, significantly more severe allergic asthma patients on omalizumab were able to reduce their 
fluticasone dose to 500 micrograms/day without deterioration of asthma control (60.3%) compared to 
the placebo group (45.8%, p<0.05). 
59 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Quality of life scores were measured using the Juniper Asthma-related Quality of Life Questionnaire. 
For all six studies there was a statistically significant improvement from baseline in quality of life 
scores for omalizumab patients versus the placebo or control group. 
Physician’s overall assessment of treatment effectiveness: 
Physician’s overall assessment was performed in five of the above studies as a broad measure of 
asthma control performed by the treating physician. The physician was able to take into account PEF 
(peak expiratory flow), day and night time symptoms, rescue medicinal product use, spirometry and 
exacerbations. In all five studies a significantly greater proportion of omalizumab-treated patients 
were judged to have achieved either a marked improvement or complete control of their asthma 
compared to placebo patients. 
Children 6 to <12 years of age 
The primary support for safety and efficacy of omalizumab in the group aged 6 to <12 years comes 
from one randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre trial (study 7). 
Study 7 was a placebo-controlled trial which included a specific subgroup (n=235) of patients as 
defined in the present indication, who were treated with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids 
(≥500 µg/day fluticasone equivalent) plus long-acting beta agonist. 
A clinically significant exacerbation was defined as a worsening of asthma symptoms as judged 
clinically by the investigator, requiring doubling of the baseline inhaled corticosteroid dose for at least 
3 days and/or treatment with rescue systemic (oral or intravenous) corticosteroids for at least 3 days. 
In the specific subgroup of patients on high dose inhaled corticosteroids, the omalizumab group had a 
statistically significantly lower rate of clinically significant asthma exacerbations than the placebo 
group. At 24 weeks, the difference in rates between treatment groups represented a 34% (rate ratio 
0.662, p = 0.047) decrease relative to placebo for omalizumab patients. In the second double-blind 28-
week treatment period the difference in rates between treatment groups represented a 63% (rate ratio 
0.37, p<0.001) decrease relative to placebo for omalizumab patients. 
During the 52-week double-blind treatment period (including the 24-week fixed-dose steroid phase 
and the 28-week steroid adjustment phase) the difference in rates between treatment groups 
represented a 50% (rate ratio 0.504, p<0.001) relative decrease in exacerbations for omalizumab 
patients. 
The omalizumab group showed greater decreases in beta-agonist rescue medicinal product use than 
the placebo group at the end of the 52-week treatment period, although the difference between 
treatment groups was not statistically significant. For the global evaluation of treatment effectiveness 
at the end of the 52-week double-blind treatment period in the subgroup of severe patients on high-
dose inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting beta agonists, the proportion of patients rated as having 
‘excellent’ treatment effectiveness was higher, and the proportions having ‘moderate’ or ‘poor’ 
treatment effectiveness lower in the omalizumab group compared to the placebo group; the difference 
between groups was statistically significant (p<0.001), while there were no differences between the 
omalizumab and placebo groups for patients’ subjective Quality of Life ratings.

Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 
The safety and efficacy of omalizumab were evaluated in two randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled trials in patients with CRSwNP (Table 7). Patients received omalizumab or placebo 
subcutaneously every 2 or 4 weeks (see section 4.2). All patients received background intranasal 
mometasone therapy throughout the study. Prior sino-nasal surgery or prior systemic corticosteroid 
usage were not required for inclusion in the studies. Patients received omalizumab or placebo for 
24 weeks followed by a 4-week follow-up period. Demographics and baseline characteristics, 
including allergic comorbidities, are described in Table 6.

In a pre-specified pooled analysis of rescue treatment (systemic corticosteroids for 3 consecutive 
days or nasal polypectomy) during the 24-week treatment period, the proportion of patients requiring 
rescue treatment was lower in omalizumab compared to placebo (2.3% versus 6.2%, respectively). 
The odds-ratio of having taken rescue treatment in omalizumab compared to placebo was 0.38 (95% 
CI: 0.10, 1.49). There were no sino-nasal surgeries reported in either study. 
The long-term efficacy and safety of omalizumab in patients with CRSwNP who had participated in 
nasal polyp studies 1 and 2 was assessed in an open-label extension study. Efficacy data from this 
study suggest that clinical benefit provided at Week 24 was sustained through to Week 52. Safety data 
were overall consistent with the known safety profile of omalizumab. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics of omalizumab have been studied in adult and adolescent patients with allergic 
asthma as well as in adult patients with CRSwNP. The general pharmacokinetic characteristics of 
omalizumab are similar in these patient populations. 
Absorption 
After subcutaneous administration, omalizumab is absorbed with an average absolute bioavailability 
of 62%. Following a single subcutaneous dose in adult and adolescent patients with asthma, 
omalizumab was absorbed slowly, reaching peak serum concentrations after an average of 7-8 days. 
The pharmacokinetics of omalizumab are linear at doses greater than 0.5 mg/kg. Following multiple 
doses of omalizumab, areas under the serum concentration-time curve from Day 0 to Day 14 at steady 
state were up to 6-fold of those after the first dose. 
Administration of Xolair manufactured as a lyophilised or liquid formulation resulted in similar serum 
concentration-time profiles of omalizumab. 
Distribution 
In vitro, omalizumab forms complexes of limited size with IgE. Precipitating complexes and 
complexes larger than one million Daltons in molecular weight are not observed in vitro or in vivo. 
The apparent volume of distribution in patients following subcutaneous administration was 
78 ± 32 ml/kg.

Elimination 
Clearance of omalizumab involves IgG clearance processes as well as clearance via specific binding 
and complex formation with its target ligand, IgE. Liver elimination of IgG includes degradation in the 
reticuloendothelial system and endothelial cells. Intact IgG is also excreted in bile. In asthma patients 
the omalizumab serum elimination half-life averaged 26 days, with apparent clearance averaging 
2.4  1.1 ml/kg/day. In addition, doubling of body weight approximately doubled apparent clearance. 
Characteristics in patient populations 
Age, Race/Ethnicity, Gender, Body Mass Index 
The population pharmacokinetics of omalizumab were analysed to evaluate the effects of demographic 
characteristics. Analyses of these limited data suggest that no dose adjustments are necessary for age 
(6-76 years for patients with allergic asthma; 18 to 75 years for patients with CRSwNP), 
race/ethnicity, gender or Body Mass Index (see section 4.2). 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
There are no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic data in patients with renal or hepatic impairment 
(see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
The safety of omalizumab has been studied in the cynomolgus monkey, since omalizumab binds to 
cynomolgus and human IgE with similar affinity. Antibodies to omalizumab were detected in some 
monkeys following repeated subcutaneous or intravenous administration. However, no apparent 
toxicity, such as immune complex-mediated disease or complement-dependent cytotoxicity, was seen. 
There was no evidence of an anaphylactic response due to mast-cell degranulation in cynomolgus 
monkeys. 
Chronic administration of omalizumab at dose levels of up to 250 mg/kg (at least 14 times the highest 
recommended clinical dose in mg/kg according to the recommended dosing table) was well tolerated 
in non-human primates (both adult and juvenile animals), with the exception of a dose-related and age-
dependent decrease in blood platelets, with a greater sensitivity in juvenile animals. The serum 
concentration required to attain a 50% drop in platelets from baseline in adult cynomolgus monkeys 
was roughly 4- to 20-fold higher than anticipated maximum clinical serum concentrations. In addition, 
acute haemorrhage and inflammation were observed at injection sites in cynomolgus monkeys. 
Formal carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with omalizumab. 
In reproduction studies in cynomolgus monkeys, subcutaneous doses up to 75 mg/kg per week (at least 
8 times the highest recommended clinical dose in mg/kg over a 4-week period) did not elicit maternal 
toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity when administered throughout organogenesis and did not 
elicit adverse effects on foetal or neonatal growth when administered throughout late gestation, 
delivery and nursing. 
Omalizumab is excreted in breast milk in cynomolgus monkeys. Milk levels of omalizumab were 
0.15% of the maternal serum concentration.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Allergic asthma 
Xolair is indicated in adults, adolescents and children (6 to <12 years of age). 
Xolair treatment should only be considered for patients with convincing IgE (immunoglobulin E) 
mediated asthma (see section 4.2). 
Adults and adolescents (12 years of age and older) 
Xolair is indicated as add-on therapy to improve asthma control in patients with severe persistent 
allergic asthma who have a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen and who 
have reduced lung function (FEV1 <80%) as well as frequent daytime symptoms or night-time 
awakenings and who have had multiple documented severe asthma exacerbations despite daily high-
dose inhaled corticosteroids, plus a long-acting inhaled beta2-agonist. 
Children (6 to <12 years of age) 
Xolair is indicated as add-on therapy to improve asthma control in patients with severe persistent 
allergic asthma who have a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen and 
frequent daytime symptoms or night-time awakenings and who have had multiple documented severe 
asthma exacerbations despite daily high-dose inhaled corticosteroids, plus a long-acting inhaled beta2-
agonist.

Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 
Xolair is indicated as an add-on therapy with intranasal corticosteroids (INC) for the treatment of 
adults (18 years and above) with severe CRSwNP for whom therapy with INC does not provide 
adequate disease control. 
Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) 
Xolair is indicated as add-on therapy for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria in adult and 
adolescent (12 years and above) patients with inadequate response to H1 antihistamine treatment. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of severe 
persistent asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) or chronic spontaneous 
urticaria. 
Posology 
Allergic asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 
Dosing for allergic asthma and CRSwNP follows the same dosing principles. The appropriate dose 
and frequency of omalizumab for these conditions is determined by baseline IgE (IU/ml), measured 
before the start of treatment, and body weight (kg). Prior to administration of the initial dose, patients 
should have their IgE level determined by any commercial serum total IgE assay for their dose 
assignment. Based on these measurements, 75 to 600 mg of omalizumab in 1 to 4 injections may be 
needed for each administration. 
Allergic asthma patients with baseline IgE lower than 76 IU/ml were less likely to experience benefit 
(see section 5.1). Prescribing physicians should ensure that adult and adolescent patients with IgE 
below 76 IU/ml and children (6 to < 12 years of age) with IgE below 200 IU/ml have unequivocal in 
vitro reactivity (RAST) to a perennial allergen before starting therapy. 
See Table 1 for a conversion chart and Tables 2 and 3 for the dose determination charts. 
Patients whose baseline IgE levels or body weight in kilograms are outside the limits of the dose table 
should not be given omalizumab. 
The maximum recommended dose is 600 mg omalizumab every two weeks.

Insufficient data to recommend a dose 
Treatment duration, monitoring and dose adjustments 
Allergic asthma 
Xolair is intended for long-term treatment. Clinical trials have demonstrated that it takes at least 
12-16 weeks for the treatment to show effectiveness. At 16 weeks after commencing Xolair therapy 
patients should be assessed by their physician for treatment effectiveness before further injections are 
administered. The decision to continue treatment following the 16-week timepoint, or on subsequent 
occasions, should be based on whether a marked improvement in overall asthma control is seen (see 
section 5.1, Physician’s overall assessment of treatment effectiveness). 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 
In clinical trials for CRSwNP, changes in nasal polyps score (NPS) and nasal congestion score (NCS) 
were observed at 4 weeks. The need for continued therapy should be periodically reassessed based 
upon the patient’s disease severity and level of symptom control.

Allergic asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 
Discontinuation of treatment generally results in a return to elevated free IgE levels and associated 
symptoms. Total IgE levels are elevated during treatment and remain elevated for up to one year after 
the discontinuation of treatment. Therefore, re-testing of IgE levels during treatment cannot be used as 
a guide for dose determination. Dose determination after treatment interruptions lasting less than one 
year should be based on serum IgE levels obtained at the initial dose determination. Total serum IgE 
levels may be re-tested for dose determination if treatment has been interrupted for one year or more. 
Doses should be adjusted for significant changes in body weight (see Tables 2 and 3). 
Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) 
The recommended dose is 300 mg by subcutaneous injection every four weeks. 
Prescribers are advised to periodically reassess the need for continued therapy. 
Clinical trial experience of long-term treatment in this indication is described in section 5.1. 
Special populations 
Elderly (65 years of age and older) 
There are limited data available on the use of omalizumab in patients older than 65 years but there is 
no evidence that elderly patients require a different dose from younger adult patients. 
Renal or hepatic impairment 
There have been no studies on the effect of impaired renal or hepatic function on the pharmacokinetics 
of omalizumab. Because omalizumab clearance at clinical doses is dominated by the reticular 
endothelial system (RES) it is unlikely to be altered by renal or hepatic impairment. While no 
particular dose adjustment is recommended for these patients, omalizumab should be administered 
with caution (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
In allergic asthma, the safety and efficacy of omalizumab in patients below the age of 6 years have not 
been established. No data are available. 
In CRSwNP, the safety and efficacy of omalizumab in patients below the age of 18 years have not 
been established. No data are available. 
In CSU, the safety and efficacy of omalizumab in patients below the age of 12 years have not been 
established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
For subcutaneous administration only. Omalizumab must not be administered by the intravenous or 
intramuscular route. 
Doses of more than 150 mg (Table 1) should be divided across two or more injection sites. 
Xolair powder and solvent for solution for injection is intended to be administered by a healthcare 
provider only. 
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6 and 
also information for the healthcare professional section of the package leaflet.

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
General 
Omalizumab is not indicated for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations, acute bronchospasm or 
status asthmaticus. 
Omalizumab has not been studied in patients with hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome or allergic 
bronchopulmonary aspergillosis or for the prevention of anaphylactic reactions, including those 
provoked by food allergy, atopic dermatitis, or allergic rhinitis. Omalizumab is not indicated for the 
treatment of these conditions. 
Omalizumab therapy has not been studied in patients with autoimmune diseases, immune complex-
mediated conditions, or pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). Caution should be 
exercised when administering omalizumab in these patient populations. 
Abrupt discontinuation of systemic or inhaled corticosteroids after initiation of omalizumab therapy in 
allergic asthma or CRSwNP is not recommended. Decreases in corticosteroids should be performed 
under the direct supervision of a physician and may need to be performed gradually. 
Immune system disorders 
Allergic reactions type I 
Type I local or systemic allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock, may occur 
when taking omalizumab, even after a long duration of treatment. However, most of these reactions 
occurred within 2 hours after the first and subsequent injections of omalizumab but some started 
beyond 2 hours and even beyond 24 hours after the injection. The majority of anaphylactic reactions 
occurred within the first 3 doses of omalizumab. A history of anaphylaxis unrelated to omalizumab 
may be a risk factor for anaphylaxis following omalizumab administration. Therefore medicinal 
products for the treatment of anaphylactic reactions should always be available for immediate use 
following administration of omalizumab. If an anaphylactic or other serious allergic reaction occurs, 
administration of omalizumab must be discontinued immediately, and appropriate therapy initiated. 
Patients should be informed that such reactions are possible, and prompt medical attention should be 
sought if allergic reactions occur. 
Antibodies to omalizumab have been detected in a low number of patients in clinical trials (see 
section 4.8). The clinical relevance of anti-omalizumab antibodies is not well understood. 
Serum sickness 
Serum sickness and serum sickness-like reactions, which are delayed allergic type III reactions, have 
been seen in patients treated with humanised monoclonal antibodies including omalizumab. The 
suggested pathophysiologic mechanism includes immune-complex formation and deposition due to 
development of antibodies against omalizumab. The onset has typically been 1-5 days after 
administration of the first or subsequent injections, also after long duration of treatment. Symptoms 
suggestive of serum sickness include arthritis/arthralgias, rash (urticaria or other forms), fever and 
lymphadenopathy. Antihistamines and corticosteroids may be useful for preventing or treating this 
disorder, and patients should be advised to report any suspected symptoms. 
72 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Churg-Strauss syndrome and hypereosinophilic syndrome 
Patients with severe asthma may rarely present systemic hypereosinophilic syndrome or allergic 
eosinophilic granulomatous vasculitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome), both of which are usually treated 
with systemic corticosteroids. 
In rare cases, patients on therapy with anti-asthma medicinal products, including omalizumab, may 
present or develop systemic eosinophilia and vasculitis. These events are commonly associated with 
the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. 
In these patients, physicians should be alert to the development of marked eosinophilia, vasculitic 
rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, paranasal sinus abnormalities, cardiac complications, and/or 
neuropathy. 
Discontinuation of omalizumab should be considered in all severe cases with the above mentioned 
immune system disorders. 
Parasitic (helminth) infections 
IgE may be involved in the immunological response to some helminth infections. In patients at chronic 
high risk of helminth infection, a placebo-controlled trial in allergic patients showed a slight increase 
in infection rate with omalizumab, although the course, severity, and response to treatment of infection 
were unaltered. The helminth infection rate in the overall clinical programme, which was not designed 
to detect such infections, was less than 1 in 1 000 patients. However, caution may be warranted in 
patients at high risk of helminth infection, in particular when travelling to areas where helminthic 
infections are endemic. If patients do not respond to recommended anti-helminth treatment, 
discontinuation of omalizumab should be considered. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Since IgE may be involved in the immunological response to some helmith infections, omalizumab 
may indirectly reduce the efficacy of medicinal products for the treatment of helminthic or other 
parasitic infections (see section 4.4). 
Cytochrome P450 enzymes, efflux pumps and protein-binding mechanisms are not involved in the 
clearance of omalizumab; thus, there is little potential for interactions. Medicinal product or vaccine 
interaction studies have not been performed with omalizumab. There is no pharmacological reason to 
expect that commonly prescribed medicinal products used in the treatment of asthma, CRSwNP or 
CSU will interact with omalizumab. 
Allergic asthma 
In clinical studies omalizumab was commonly used in conjunction with inhaled and oral 
corticosteroids, inhaled short-acting and long-acting beta agonists, leukotriene modifiers, 
theophyllines and oral antihistamines. There was no indication that the safety of omalizumab was 
altered with these other commonly used anti-asthma medicinal products. Limited data are available on 
the use of omalizumab in combination with specific immunotherapy (hypo-sensitisation therapy). In a 
clinical trial where omalizumab was co-administered with immunotherapy, the safety and efficacy of 
omalizumab in combination with specific immunotherapy were found to be no different to that of 
omalizumab alone. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 
In clinical studies omalizumab was used in conjunction with intranasal mometasone spray as per 
protocol. Other commonly used concomitant medicinal products included other intranasal 
corticosteroids, bronchodilators, antihistamines, leukotriene receptor antagonists, 
adrenergics/sympathomimetics and local nasal anaesthetics. There was no indication that the safety of 
omalizumab was altered by the concomitant use of these other commonly used medicinal products. 
73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) 
In clinical studies in CSU, omalizumab was used in conjunction with antihistamines (anti-H1, anti-H2) 
and leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs). There was no evidence that the safety of omalizumab 
was altered when used with these medicinal products relative to its known safety profile in allergic 
asthma. In addition, a population pharmacokinetic analysis showed no relevant effect of H2 
antihistamines and LTRAs on omalizumab pharmacokinetics (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
Clinical studies in CSU included some patients aged 12 to 17 years taking omalizumab in conjunction 
with antihistamines (anti-H1, anti-H2) and LTRAs. No studies have been performed in children under 
12 years. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
A moderate amount of data on pregnant women (between 300-1 000 pregnancy outcomes) based on 
pregnancy registry and post-marketing spontaneous reports, indicates no malformative or 
foeto/neonatal toxicity. A prospective pregnancy registry study (EXPECT) in 250 pregnant women 
with asthma exposed to omalizumab showed the prevalence of major congenital anomalies was similar 
(8.1% vs. 8.9%) between EXPECT and disease-matched (moderate and severe asthma) patients. The 
interpretation of data may be impacted due to methodological limitations of the study, including small 
sample size and non-randomised design. 
Omalizumab crosses the placental barrier. However, animal studies do not indicate either direct or 
indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Omalizumab has been associated with age-dependent decreases in blood platelets in non-human 
primates, with a greater relative sensitivity in juvenile animals (see section 5.3). 
If clinically needed, the use of omalizumab may be considered during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
Immunoglobulins G (IgGs) are present in human milk and therefore it is expected that omalizumab 
will be present in human milk. Available data in non-human primates have shown excretion of 
omalizumab into milk (see section 5.3). 
The EXPECT study, with 154 infants who had been exposed to omalizumab during pregnancy and 
through breast-feeding did not indicate adverse effects on the breast-fed infant. The interpretation of 
data may be impacted due to methodological limitations of the study, including small sample size and 
non-randomised design. 
Given orally, immunoglobulin G proteins undergo intestinal proteolysis and have poor bioavailability. 
No effects on the breast-fed newborns/infants are anticipated. Consequently, if clinically needed, the 
use of omalizumab may be considered during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
There are no human fertility data for omalizumab. In specifically-designed non-clinical fertility 
studies, in non-human primates including mating studies, no impairment of male or female fertility 
was observed following repeated dosing with omalizumab at dose levels up to 75 mg/kg. Furthermore, 
no genotoxic effects were observed in a separate non-clinical genotoxicity study.

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Omalizumab has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Allergic asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 
Summary of safety profile 
During allergic asthma clinical trials in adult and adolescent patients 12 years of age and older, the 
most commonly reported adverse reactions were headaches and injection site reactions, including 
injection site pain, swelling, erythema and pruritus. In clinical trials in children 6 to <12 years of age, 
the most commonly reported adverse reactions were headache, pyrexia and upper abdominal pain. 
Most of the reactions were mild or moderate in severity. In clinical trials in patients ≥18 years of age 
in CRSwNP, the most commonly reported adverse reactions were headache, dizziness, arthralgia, 
abdominal pain upper and injection site reactions. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Table 4 lists the adverse reactions recorded in clinical studies in the total allergic asthma and CRSwNP 
safety population treated with Xolair by MedDRA system organ class and frequency. Within each 
frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Frequency 
categories are defined as: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1 000 to 
<1/100), rare (≥1/10 000 to <1/1 000) and very rare (<1/10 000). Reactions reported in the post-
marketing setting are listed with frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Summary of safety profile 
The safety and tolerability of omalizumab were investigated with doses of 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg 
every four weeks in 975 CSU patients, 242 of whom received placebo. Overall, 733 patients were 
treated with omalizumab for up to 12 weeks and 490 patients for up to 24 weeks. Of those, 
412 patients were treated for up to 12 weeks and 333 patients were treated for up to 24 weeks at the 
300 mg dose. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
A separate table (Table 5) shows the adverse reactions for the CSU indication resulting from 
differences in dose and treatment populations (with significantly different risk factors, comorbidities, 
concomitant medicinal products and ages [e.g. asthma trials included children from 6-12 years of 
age]). 
Table 5 lists the adverse reactions (events occurring in ≥1% of patients in any treatment group and 
≥2% more frequently in any omalizumab treatment group than with placebo (after medical review)) 
reported with 300 mg in the three pooled phase III studies. The adverse reactions presented are divided 
into two groups: those identified in the 12-week and the 24-week treatment periods. 
The adverse reactions are listed by MedDRA system organ class. Within each system organ class, the 
adverse reactions are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions listed first. The 
corresponding frequency category for each adverse reaction is based on the following convention: 
very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1 000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10 000 
to <1/1 000); very rare (<1/10 000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Immune system disorders 
For further information, see section 4.4. 
Anaphylaxis 
Anaphylactic reactions were rare in clinical trials. However, post-marketing data following a 
cumulative search in the safety database retrieved a total of 898 anaphylaxis cases. Based on an 
estimated exposure of 566 923 patient treatment years, this results in a reporting rate of approximately 
0.20%. 
Arterial thromboembolic events (ATE) 
In controlled clinical trials and during interim analyses of an observational study, a numerical 
imbalance of ATE was observed. The definition of the composite endpoint ATE included stroke, 
transient ischaemic attack, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and cardiovascular death (including 
death from unknown cause). In the final analysis of the observational study, the rate of ATE per 1 000 
patient years was 7.52 (115/15 286 patient years) for Xolair-treated patients and 5.12 (51/9 963 patient 
years) for control patients. In a multivariate analysis controlling for available baseline cardiovascular 
risk factors, the hazard ratio was 1.32 (95% confidence interval 0.91-1.91). In a separate analysis of 
pooled clinical trials, which included all randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials 
lasting 8 or more weeks, the rate of ATE per 1 000 patient years was 2.69 (5/1 856 patient years) for 
Xolair-treated patients and 2.38 (4/1 680 patient years) for placebo patients (rate ratio 1.13, 95% 
confidence interval 0.24-5.71). 
Platelets 
In clinical trials few patients had platelet counts below the lower limit of the normal laboratory range. 
Isolated cases of idiopathic thrombocytopenia, including severe cases, have been reported in the post-
marketing setting. 
Parasitic infections 
In allergic patients at chronic high risk of helminth infection, a placebo-controlled trial showed a slight 
numerical increase in infection rate with omalizumab that was not statistically significant. The course, 
severity, and response to treatment of infections were unaltered (see section 4.4). 
Systemic lupus erythematosus 
Clinical trial and post-marketing cases of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in 
patients with moderate to severe asthma and CSU. The pathogenesis of SLE is not well understood. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Maximum tolerated dose of Xolair has not been determined. Single intravenous doses up to 4 000 mg 
have been administered to patients without evidence of dose-limiting toxicities. The highest 
cumulative dose administered to patients was 44 000 mg over a 20-week period and this dose did not 
result in any untoward acute effects. 
If an overdose is suspected, the patient should be monitored for any abnormal signs or symptoms. 
Medical treatment should be sought and instituted appropriately.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airway diseases, other systemic drugs for 
obstructive airway diseases, ATC code: R03DX05 
Allergic asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 
Mechanism of action 
Omalizumab is a recombinant DNA-derived humanised monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to 
human immunoglobulin E (IgE) and prevents binding of IgE to FceRI (high-affinity IgE receptor) on 
basophils and mast cells, thereby reducing the amount of free IgE that is available to trigger the 
allergic cascade. The antibody is an IgG1 kappa that contains human framework regions with the 
complementary-determining regions of a murine parent antibody that binds to IgE. 
Treatment of atopic subjects with omalizumab resulted in a marked down-regulation of FcRI 
receptors on basophils. Omalizumab inhibits IgE-mediated inflammation, as evidenced by reduced 
blood and tissue eosinophils and reduced inflammatory mediators, including IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 by 
innate, adaptive and non-immune cells. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Allergic asthma 
The in vitro histamine release from basophils isolated from omalizumab-treated subjects was reduced 
by approximately 90% following stimulation with an allergen compared to pre-treatment values. 
In clinical studies in allergic asthma patients, serum free IgE levels were reduced in a dose-dependent 
manner within one hour following the first dose and maintained between doses. One year after 
discontinuation of omalizumab dosing, the IgE levels had returned to pre-treatment levels with no 
observed rebound in IgE levels after washout of the medicinal product. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 
In clinical studies in patients with CRSwNP, omalizumab treatment led to a reduction in serum free 
IgE (approx. 95%) and an increase in serum total IgE levels, to a similar extent as observed in patients 
with allergic asthma. Total IgE levels in serum increased due to the formation of omalizumab-IgE 
complexes that have a slower elimination rate compared with free IgE. 
Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) 
Mechanism of action 
Omalizumab is a recombinant DNA-derived humanised monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to 
human immunoglobulin E (IgE) and lowers free IgE levels. The antibody is an IgG1 kappa that 
contains human framework regions with the complementary-determining regions of a murine parent 
antibody that binds to IgE. Subsequently, IgE receptors (FcεRI) on cells down-regulate. It is not 
entirely understood how this results in an improvement of CSU symptoms. 
Pharmacodynamic effect 
In clinical studies in CSU patients, maximum suppression of free IgE was observed 3 days after the 
first subcutaneous dose. After repeated dosing once every 4 weeks, pre-dose serum free IgE levels 
remained stable between 12 and 24 weeks of treatment. After discontinuation of omalizumab, free IgE 
levels increased towards pre-treatment levels over a 16-week treatment-free follow-up period.

Clinical efficacy and safety 
Allergic asthma 
Adults and adolescents ≥12 years of age 
The efficacy and safety of omalizumab were demonstrated in a 28-week double-blind placebo-
controlled study (study 1) involving 419 severe allergic asthmatics, ages 12-79 years, who had reduced 
lung function (FEV1 40-80% predicted) and poor asthma symptom control despite receiving high dose 
inhaled corticosteroids and a long-acting beta2-agonist. Eligible patients had experienced multiple 
asthma exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroid treatment or had been hospitalised or attended 
an emergency room due to a severe asthma exacerbation in the past year despite continuous treatment 
with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and a long-acting beta2-agonist. Subcutaneous omalizumab or 
placebo were administered as add-on therapy to >1 000 micrograms beclomethasone dipropionate (or 
equivalent) plus a long-acting beta2-agonist. Oral corticosteroid, theophylline and leukotriene-
modifier maintenance therapies were allowed (22%, 27%, and 35% of patients, respectively). 
The rate of asthma exacerbations requiring treatment with bursts of systemic corticosteroids was the 
primary endpoint. Omalizumab reduced the rate of asthma exacerbations by 19% (p = 0.153). Further 
evaluations which did show statistical significance (p<0.05) in favour of omalizumab included 
reductions in severe exacerbations (where patient’s lung function was reduced to below 60% of 
personal best and requiring systemic corticosteroids) and asthma-related emergency visits (comprised 
of hospitalisations, emergency room, and unscheduled doctor visits), and improvements in Physician’s 
overall assessment of treatment effectiveness, Asthma-related Quality of Life (AQL), asthma 
symptoms and lung function. 
In a subgroup analysis, patients with pre-treatment total IgE ≥76 IU/ml were more likely to experience 
clinically meaningful benefit to omalizumab. In these patients in study 1 omalizumab reduced the rate 
of asthma exacerbations by 40% (p = 0.002). In addition more patients had clinically meaningful 
responses in the total IgE ≥76 IU/ml population across the omalizumab severe asthma programme.

Study 2 assessed the efficacy and safety of omalizumab in a population of 312 severe allergic 
asthmatics which matched the population in study 1. Treatment with omalizumab in this open label 
study led to a 61% reduction in clinically significant asthma exacerbation rate compared to current 
asthma therapy alone.

Four additional large placebo-controlled supportive studies of 28 to 52 weeks duration in 1,722 adults 
and adolescents (studies 3, 4, 5, 6) assessed the efficacy and safety of omalizumab in patients with 
severe persistent asthma. Most patients were inadequately controlled but were receiving less 
concomitant asthma therapy than patients in studies 1 or 2. Studies 3-5 used exacerbation as primary 
endpoint, whereas study 6 primarily evaluated inhaled corticosteroid sparing. 
In studies 3, 4 and 5 patients treated with omalizumab had respective reductions in asthma 
exacerbation rates of 37.5% (p = 0.027), 40.3% (p<0.001) and 57.6% (p<0.001) compared to placebo. 
In study 6, significantly more severe allergic asthma patients on omalizumab were able to reduce their 
fluticasone dose to 500 micrograms/day without deterioration of asthma control (60.3%) compared to 
the placebo group (45.8%, p<0.05). 
Quality of life scores were measured using the Juniper Asthma-related Quality of Life Questionnaire. 
For all six studies there was a statistically significant improvement from baseline in quality of life 
scores for omalizumab patients versus the placebo or control group. 
Physician’s overall assessment of treatment effectiveness: 
Physician’s overall assessment was performed in five of the above studies as a broad measure of 
asthma control performed by the treating physician. The physician was able to take into account PEF 
(peak expiratory flow), day and night time symptoms, rescue medicinal product use, spirometry and 
exacerbations. In all five studies a significantly greater proportion of omalizumab-treated patients 
were judged to have achieved either a marked improvement or complete control of their asthma 
compared to placebo patients. 
Children 6 to <12 years of age 
The primary support for safety and efficacy of omalizumab in the group aged 6 to <12 years comes 
from one randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre trial (study 7). 
Study 7 was a placebo-controlled trial which included a specific subgroup (n=235) of patients as 
defined in the present indication, who were treated with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids 
(≥500 µg/day fluticasone equivalent) plus long-acting beta agonist. 
A clinically significant exacerbation was defined as a worsening of asthma symptoms as judged 
clinically by the investigator, requiring doubling of the baseline inhaled corticosteroid dose for at least 
3 days and/or treatment with rescue systemic (oral or intravenous) corticosteroids for at least 3 days. 
In the specific subgroup of patients on high dose inhaled corticosteroids, the omalizumab group had a 
statistically significantly lower rate of clinically significant asthma exacerbations than the placebo 
group. At 24 weeks, the difference in rates between treatment groups represented a 34% (rate ratio 
0.662, p = 0.047) decrease relative to placebo for omalizumab patients. In the second double-blind 28-
week treatment period the difference in rates between treatment groups represented a 63% (rate ratio 
0.37, p<0.001) decrease relative to placebo for omalizumab patients. 
During the 52-week double-blind treatment period (including the 24-week fixed-dose steroid phase 
and the 28-week steroid adjustment phase) the difference in rates between treatment groups 
represented a 50% (rate ratio 0.504, p<0.001) relative decrease in exacerbations for omalizumab 
patients. 
81 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The omalizumab group showed greater decreases in beta-agonist rescue medicinal product use than 
the placebo group at the end of the 52-week treatment period, although the difference between 
treatment groups was not statistically significant. For the global evaluation of treatment effectiveness 
at the end of the 52-week double-blind treatment period in the subgroup of severe patients on high-
dose inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting beta agonists, the proportion of patients rated as having 
‘excellent’ treatment effectiveness was higher, and the proportions having ‘moderate’ or ‘poor’ 
treatment effectiveness lower in the omalizumab group compared to the placebo group; the difference 
between groups was statistically significant (p<0.001), while there were no differences between the 
omalizumab and placebo groups for patients’ subjective Quality of Life ratings. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 
The safety and efficacy of omalizumab were evaluated in two randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled trials in patients with CRSwNP (Table 8). Patients received omalizumab or placebo 
subcutaneously every 2 or 4 weeks (see section 4.2). All patients received background intranasal 
mometasone therapy throughout the study. Prior sino-nasal surgery or prior systemic corticosteroid 
usage were not required for inclusion in the studies. Patients received omalizumab or placebo for 
24 weeks followed by a 4-week follow-up period. Demographics and baseline characteristics, 
including allergic comorbidities, are described in Table 7.

statistically significant greater improvements from baseline at Week 24 in NPS and weekly average 
NCS than patients who received placebo. Results from nasal polyp studies 1 and 2 are shown in

In a pre-specified pooled analysis of rescue treatment (systemic corticosteroids for 3 consecutive 
days or nasal polypectomy) during the 24-week treatment period, the proportion of patients requiring 
rescue treatment was lower in omalizumab compared to placebo (2.3% versus 6.2%, respectively). 
The odds-ratio of having taken rescue treatment in omalizumab compared to placebo was 0.38 (95% 
CI: 0.10, 1.49). There were no sino-nasal surgeries reported in either study. 
The long-term efficacy and safety of omalizumab in patients with CRSwNP who had participated in 
nasal polyp studies 1 and 2 was assessed in an open-label extension study. Efficacy data from this 
study suggest that clinical benefit provided at Week 24 was sustained through to Week 52. Safety data 
were overall consistent with the known safety profile of omalizumab. 
Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) 
The efficacy and safety of omalizumab were demonstrated in two randomised, placebo-controlled 
phase III studies (study 1 and 2) in patients with CSU who remained symptomatic despite H1 
antihistamine therapy at the approved dose. A third study (study 3) primarily evaluated the safety of 
omalizumab in patients with CSU who remained symptomatic despite treatment with H1 
antihistamines at up to four times the approved dose and H2 antihistamine and/or LTRA treatment. 
The three studies enrolled 975 patients aged between 12 and 75 years (mean age 42.3 years; 
39 patients 12-17 years, 54 patients ≥65 years; 259 males and 716 females). All patients were required 
to have inadequate symptom control, as assessed by a weekly urticaria activity score (UAS7, range 
0-42) of ≥16, and a weekly itch severity score (which is a component of the UAS7; range 0-21) of ≥8 
for the 7 days prior to randomisation, despite having used an antihistamine for at least 2 weeks 
beforehand. 
In studies 1 and 2, patients had a mean weekly itch severity score of between 13.7 and 14.5 at baseline 
and a mean UAS7 score of 29.5 and 31.7 respectively. Patients in safety study 3 had a mean weekly 
itch severity score of 13.8 and a mean UAS7 score of 31.2 at baseline. Across all three studies, 
patients reported receiving on average 4 to 6 medicinal products (including H1 antihistamines) for 
CSU symptoms prior to study enrollment. Patients received omalizumab at 75 mg, 150 mg or 300 mg 
or placebo by subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks for 24 and 12 weeks in studies 1 and 2, 
respectively, and 300 mg or placebo by subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks for 24 weeks in study 3. 
All studies had a 16-week treatment-free follow-up period.

The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to week 12 in weekly itch severity score. 
Omalizumab at 300 mg reduced the weekly itch severity score by 8.55 to 9.77 (p <0.0001) compared 
to a reduction of 3.63 to 5.14 for placebo (see Table 9). Statistically significant results were further 
observed in the responder rates for UAS7≤6 (at week 12) which were higher for the 300 mg treatment 
groups, ranging from 52-66% (p<0.0001) compared to 11-19% for the placebo groups, and complete 
response (UAS7=0) was achieved by 34-44% (p<0.0001) of patients treated with 300 mg compared to 
5-9% of patients in the placebo groups. Patients in the 300 mg treatment groups achieved the highest 
mean proportion of angioedema-free days from week 4 to week 12, (91.0-96.1%; p<0.001) compared 
to the placebo groups (88.1-89.2%). Mean change from baseline to week 12 in the overall DLQI for 
the 300 mg treatment groups was greater (p<0.001) than for placebo showing an improvement ranging 
from 9.7-10.3 points compared to 5.1-6.1 points for the corresponding placebo groups.

Figure 2 shows the mean weekly itch severity score over time in study 1. The mean weekly itch 
severity scores significantly decreased with a maximum effect around week 12 that was sustained over 
the 24-week treatment period. The results were similar in study 3. 
In all three studies the mean weekly itch severity score increased gradually during the 16-week 
treatment-free follow-up period, consistent with symptom re-occurrence. Mean values at the end of the 
follow-up period were similar to the placebo group, but lower than respective mean baseline values.

The magnitude of the efficacy outcomes observed at week 24 of treatment was comparable to that 
observed at week 12: 
For 300 mg, in studies 1 and 3, the mean decrease from baseline in weekly itch severity score was 9.8 
and 8.6, the proportion of patients with UAS7≤6 was 61.7% and 55.6%, and the proportion of patients 
with complete response (UAS7=0) was 48.1% and 42.5%, respectively, (all p<0.0001, when compared 
to placebo). 
Clinical trial data on adolescents (12 to 17 years) included a total of 39 patients, of whom 11 received 
the 300 mg dose. Results for the 300 mg are available for 9 patients at week 12 and 6 patients at 
week 24, and show a similar magnitude of response to omalizumab treatment compared to the adult 
population. Mean change from baseline in weekly itch severity score showed a reduction of 8.25 at 
week 12 and of 8.95 at week 24. The responder rates were: 33% at week 12 and 67% at week 24 for 
UAS7=0, and 56% at week 12 and 67% at week 24 for UAS7≤6. 
In a 48-week study, 206 patients aged between 12 and 75 years were enrolled into a 24-week 
open-label treatment period of omalizumab 300 mg every 4 weeks. Patients who responded to 
treatment in this open-label period were then randomised to receive omalizumab 300 mg (81 patients) 
or placebo (53 patients) every 4 weeks for an additional 24 weeks. 
Of the patients who remained on omalizumab treatment for 48 weeks, 21% experienced clinical 
worsening (UAS7 score 12 for at least 2 consecutive weeks post-randomisation between weeks 24 
and 48), versus 60.4% of those treated with placebo at week 48 (difference ˗39.4%, p<0.0001, 95% 
CI: −54.5%, −22.5%). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics of omalizumab have been studied in adult and adolescent patients with allergic 
asthma as well as in adult patients with CRSwNP, and adult and adolescent patients with CSU. The 
general pharmacokinetic characteristics of omalizumab are similar in these patient populations.

Absorption 
After subcutaneous administration, omalizumab is absorbed with an average absolute bioavailability 
of 62%. Following a single subcutaneous dose in adult and adolescent patients with asthma or CSU, 
omalizumab was absorbed slowly, reaching peak serum concentrations after an average of 6-8 days. In 
patients with asthma, following multiple doses of omalizumab, areas under the serum concentration-
time curve from Day 0 to Day 14 at steady state were up to 6-fold of those after the first dose. 
The pharmacokinetics of omalizumab are linear at doses greater than 0.5 mg/kg. Following doses of 
75 mg, 150 mg or 300 mg every 4 weeks in patients with CSU, trough serum concentrations of 
omalizumab increased proportionally with the dose level. 
Administration of Xolair manufactured as a lyophilised or liquid formulation resulted in similar serum 
concentration-time profiles of omalizumab. 
Distribution 
In vitro, omalizumab forms complexes of limited size with IgE. Precipitating complexes and 
complexes larger than one million Daltons in molecular weight are not observed in vitro or in vivo. 
Based on population pharmacokinetics, distribution of omalizumab was similar in patients with 
allergic asthma and patients with CSU. The apparent volume of distribution in patients with asthma 
following subcutaneous administration was 78 ± 32 ml/kg. 
Elimination 
Clearance of omalizumab involves IgG clearance processes as well as clearance via specific binding 
and complex formation with its target ligand, IgE. Liver elimination of IgG includes degradation in the 
reticuloendothelial system and endothelial cells. Intact IgG is also excreted in bile. In asthma patients 
the omalizumab serum elimination half-life averaged 26 days, with apparent clearance averaging 
2.4  1.1 ml/kg/day. Doubling of body weight approximately doubled apparent clearance. In CSU 
patients, based on population pharmacokinetic simulations, omalizumab serum elimination half-life at 
steady state averaged 24 days and apparent clearance at steady state for a patient of 80 kg weight was 
3.0 ml/kg/day. 
Characteristics in patient populations 
Age, Race/Ethnicity, Gender, Body Mass Index 
Patients with allergic asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) 
The population pharmacokinetics of omalizumab were analysed to evaluate the effects of demographic 
characteristics. Analyses of these limited data suggest that no dose adjustments are necessary for age 
(6-76 years for patients with allergic asthma; 18 to 75 years for patients with CRSwNP), 
race/ethnicity, gender or body mass index (see section 4.2). 
Patients with CSU 
The effects of demographic characteristics and other factors on omalizumab exposure were evaluated 
based on population pharmacokinetics. In addition, covariate effects were evaluated by analysing the 
relationship between omalizumab concentrations and clinical responses. These analyses suggest that 
no dose adjustments are necessary in patients with CSU for age (12-75 years), race/ethnicity, gender, 
body weight, body mass index, baseline IgE, anti-FcRI autoantibodies or concomitant use of H2 
antihistamines or LTRAs. 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
There are no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic data in allergic asthma or CSU patients with renal 
or hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
87 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
The safety of omalizumab has been studied in the cynomolgus monkey, since omalizumab binds to 
cynomolgus and human IgE with similar affinity. Antibodies to omalizumab were detected in some 
monkeys following repeated subcutaneous or intravenous administration. However, no apparent 
toxicity, such as immune complex-mediated disease or complement-dependent cytotoxicity, was seen. 
There was no evidence of an anaphylactic response due to mast-cell degranulation in cynomolgus 
monkeys. 
Chronic administration of omalizumab at dose levels of up to 250 mg/kg (at least 14 times the highest 
recommended clinical dose in mg/kg according to the recommended dosing table) was well tolerated 
in non-human primates (both adult and juvenile animals), with the exception of a dose-related and age-
dependent decrease in blood platelets, with a greater sensitivity in juvenile animals. The serum 
concentration required to attain a 50% drop in platelets from baseline in adult cynomolgus monkeys 
was roughly 4- to 20-fold higher than anticipated maximum clinical serum concentrations. In addition, 
acute haemorrhage and inflammation were observed at injection sites in cynomolgus monkeys. 
Formal carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with omalizumab. 
In reproduction studies in cynomolgus monkeys, subcutaneous doses up to 75 mg/kg per week (at least 
8 times the highest recommended clinical dose in mg/kg over a 4-week period) did not elicit maternal 
toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity when administered throughout organogenesis and did not 
elicit adverse effects on foetal or neonatal growth when administered throughout late gestation, 
delivery and nursing. 
Omalizumab is excreted in breast milk in cynomolgus monkeys. Milk levels of omalizumab were 
0.15% of the maternal serum concentration.

6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
Xolair 150 mg powder for solution for injection is supplied in a single-use vial. 
From a microbiological point of view, the medicinal product should be used immediately after 
reconstitution (see section 6.3). 
The lyophilised medicinal product takes 15-20 minutes to dissolve, although in some cases it may take 
longer. The fully reconstituted medicinal product will appear clear to slightly opalescent, colourless to 
pale brownish-yellow and may have a few small bubbles or foam around the edge of the vial. Because 
of the viscosity of the reconstituted medicinal product care must be taken to withdraw all of the 
medicinal product from the vial before expelling any air or excess solution from the syringe in order to 
obtain the 1.2 ml. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Xolair is and what it is used for 
Xolair contains the active substance omalizumab. Omalizumab is a man-made protein that is similar to 
natural proteins produced by the body. It belongs to a class of medicines called monoclonal antibodies. 
Xolair is used for the treatment of: 
- 
- 
allergic asthma 
chronic rhinosinusitis (inflammation of the nose and sinuses) with nasal polyps 
Allergic asthma 
This medicine is used to prevent asthma from getting worse by controlling symptoms of severe 
allergic asthma in adults, adolescents and children (6 years of age and older) who are already receiving 
asthma medicine, but whose asthma symptoms are not well controlled by medicines such as high-dose 
steroid inhalers and beta-agonist inhalers. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps 
This medicine is used to treat chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps in adults (18 years of age and 
older) who are already receiving intranasal corticosteroids (corticosteroid nasal spray), but whose 
symptoms are not well controlled by these medicines. Nasal polyps are small growths on the lining of 
the nose. Xolair helps to reduce the size of the polyps and improves symptoms including nasal 
congestion, loss of sense of smell, mucus in the back of the throat and runny nose. 
Xolair works by blocking a substance called immunoglobulin E (IgE), which is produced by the body. 
IgE contributes to a type of inflammation that plays a key role in causing allergic asthma and chronic

2.  What you need to know before you use Xolair 
Do not use Xolair: 
- 
if you are allergic to omalizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you think you may be allergic to any of the ingredients, tell your doctor as you should not use 
Xolair. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using Xolair: 
- 
- 
if you have kidney or liver problems. 
if you have a disorder where your own immune system attacks parts of your own body 
(autoimmune disease). 
if you are travelling to region where infections caused by parasites are common - Xolair may 
weaken your resistance to such infections. 
if you have had a previous severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), for example resulting from a 
medicine, an insect bite or food. 
if you have ever had an allergic reaction to latex. The needle cap of the syringe may contain dry 
rubber (latex). 
- 
- 
- 
Xolair does not treat acute asthma symptoms, such as a sudden asthma attack. Therefore Xolair should 
not be used to treat such symptoms. 
Xolair is not meant to prevent or treat other allergy-type conditions, such as sudden allergic reactions, 
hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (an inherited immune disorder), aspergillosis (a fungus-related 
lung disease), food allergy, eczema or hay fever because Xolair has not been studied in these 
conditions. 
Look out for signs of allergic reactions and other serious side effects 
Xolair can potentially cause serious side effects. You must look out for signs of these conditions while 
you use Xolair. Seek medical help immediately if you notice any signs indicating a severe allergic 
reaction or other serious side effects. Such signs are listed under “Serious side effects” in section 4. 
It is important that you receive training from your doctor in how to recognise early symptoms of 
severe allergic reactions, and how to manage these reactions if they occur, before you inject Xolair 
yourself or before a non-healthcare professional gives you a Xolair injection (see section 3, “How to 
use Xolair”). The majority of severe allergic reactions occur within the first 3 doses of Xolair. 
Children and adolescents 
Allergic asthma 
Xolair is not recommended for children under 6 years of age. Its use in children under 6 years of age 
has not been studied. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps 
Xolair is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age. Its use in patients 
under 18 years of age has not been studied. 
Other medicines and Xolair 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
This is especially important if you are taking: 
- 
medicines to treat an infection caused by a parasite, as Xolair may reduce the effect of your 
medicines, 
inhaled corticosteroids and other medicines for allergic asthma. 
- 
158 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice before using this medicine. Your doctor will discuss with you the benefits and potential risks of 
using this medicine during pregnancy. 
If you become pregnant while being treated with Xolair, tell your doctor immediately. 
Xolair may pass into breast milk. If you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed, ask your doctor for 
advice before using this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
It is unlikely that Xolair will affect your ability to drive and use machines. 
3. 
How to use Xolair 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, nurse or 
pharmacist if you are not sure. 
How Xolair is used 
Xolair is used as an injection under your skin (known as a subcutaneous injection). 
Injecting Xolair 
- 
You and your doctor will decide if you should inject Xolair yourself. The first 3 doses are 
always given by or under the supervision of a healthcare professional (see section 2). 
It is important to be properly trained on how to inject the medicine before injecting yourself. 
A caregiver (for example a parent) may also give you your Xolair injection after he or she has 
received proper training. 
- 
- 
For detailed instructions on how to inject Xolair, see “Instructions for use of Xolair pre-filled syringe” 
at the end of this leaflet. 
Training to recognise serious allergic reactions 
It is also important that you do not inject Xolair yourself until you have been trained by your doctor or 
nurse on: 
- 
- 
For more information about the early signs and symptoms of serious allergic reactions, see section 4. 
how to recognise the early signs and symptoms of serious allergic reactions. 
what to do if the symptoms occur. 
How much to use 
Your doctor will decide how much Xolair you need and how often you will need it. This depends on 
your body weight and the results of a blood test carried out before the start of the treatment to measure 
the amount of IgE in your blood. 
You will need 1 to 4 injections at a time. You will need the injections either every two weeks, or every 
four weeks. 
Keep taking your current asthma and/or nasal polyps medicine during Xolair treatment. Do not stop 
taking any asthma and/or nasal polyps medicine without talking to your doctor. 
You may not see an immediate improvement after beginning Xolair treatment. In patients with nasal 
polyps effects have been seen 4 weeks after the start of the treatment. In asthma patients it usually 
takes between 12 and 16 weeks to have the full effect. 
159 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Use in children and adolescents 
Allergic asthma 
Xolair can be used in children and adolescents aged 6 years and older, who are already receiving 
asthma medicine, but whose asthma symptoms are not well controlled by medicines such as high dose 
steroid inhalers and beta-agonist inhalers. Your doctor will work out how much Xolair your child 
needs and how often it needs to be given. This will depend on your child’s weight and the results of a 
blood test carried out before the start of the treatment to measure the amount of IgE in his/her blood. 
Children (6 to 11 years of age) are not expected to self-administer Xolair. However, if considered 
appropriate by their doctor, a caregiver may give them their Xolair injection after proper training. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps 
Xolair should not be used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. 
If a dose of Xolair is missed 
If you have missed an appointment, contact your doctor or hospital as soon as possible to re-schedule 
it. 
If you have forgotten to give yourself a dose of Xolair, inject the dose as soon as you remember. Then 
talk to your doctor to discuss when you should inject the next dose. 
If you stop treatment with Xolair 
Do not stop treatment with Xolair unless your doctor tells you to. Interrupting or stopping the 
treatment with Xolair may cause your symptoms to come back. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

4. 
Clean the injection site with an alcohol swab. 
Remove the plastic tray from the box, peel back the paper cover. Gripping the middle of the 
blue syringe guard, lift the syringe out of the tray. 
Inspect the syringe. The liquid should be clear to slightly cloudy. Its colour may vary from 
colourless to pale brownish-yellow. You may see an air bubble, which is normal. DO NOT USE 
if the syringe is broken or if the liquid looks distinctly cloudy or distinctly brown, or contains 
particles. In all these cases, return the entire pack to the pharmacy. 
Holding the syringe horizontally look into the viewing window to check the expiry date printed 
on the label. Note: It is possible to rotate the inner part of the syringe assembly so that the label 
can be read in the viewing window. DO NOT USE if the product has expired. If expired, return 
the entire pack to the pharmacy.

Disposal instructions 
Keep the plunger fully depressed while you 
carefully lift the needle straight out from the 
injection site. 
Slowly release the plunger and allow the syringe 
guard to automatically cover the exposed needle. 
There may be a small amount of blood at the 
injection site. You can press a cotton ball or 
gauze over the injection site and hold it for 
30 seconds. Do not rub the injection site. You 
may cover the injection site with a small adhesive 
bandage, if needed. 
Dispose of the used syringe immediately in a 
sharps container (closable, puncture resistant 
container). For the safety and health of you and 
others, needles and used syringes must never be 
re-used. Any unused medicinal product or waste 
material should be disposed of in accordance with 
local requirements. Do not throw away any 
medicines via wastewater or household waste.

How to use Xolair 
Possible side effects 
How to store Xolair 
Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Xolair is and what it is used for 
Xolair contains the active substance omalizumab. Omalizumab is a man-made protein that is similar to 
natural proteins produced by the body. It belongs to a class of medicines called monoclonal antibodies. 
Xolair is used for the treatment of: 
- 
- 
allergic asthma 
chronic rhinosinusitis (inflammation of the nose and sinuses) with nasal polyps 
Allergic asthma 
This medicine is used to prevent asthma from getting worse by controlling symptoms of severe 
allergic asthma in adults, adolescents and children (6 years of age and older) who are already receiving 
asthma medicine, but whose asthma symptoms are not well controlled by medicines such as high-dose 
steroid inhalers and beta-agonist inhalers. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps 
This medicine is used to treat chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps in adults (18 years of age and 
older) who are already receiving intranasal corticosteroids (corticosteroid nasal spray), but whose 
symptoms are not well controlled by these medicines. Nasal polyps are small growths on the lining of 
the nose. Xolair helps to reduce the size of the polyps and improves symptoms including nasal 
congestion, loss of sense of smell, mucus in the back of the throat and runny nose. 
Xolair works by blocking a substance called immunoglobulin E (IgE), which is produced by the body. 
IgE contributes to a type of inflammation that plays a key role in causing allergic asthma and chronic 
rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. 
169 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you use Xolair 
Do not use Xolair: 
- 
if you are allergic to omalizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you think you may be allergic to any of the ingredients, tell your doctor as you should not use 
Xolair. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using Xolair: 
- 
- 
if you have kidney or liver problems. 
if you have a disorder where your own immune system attacks parts of your own body 
(autoimmune disease). 
if you are travelling to region where infections caused by parasites are common - Xolair may 
weaken your resistance to such infections. 
if you have had a previous severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), for example resulting from a 
medicine, an insect bite or food. 
- 
- 
Xolair does not treat acute asthma symptoms, such as a sudden asthma attack. Therefore Xolair should 
not be used to treat such symptoms. 
Xolair is not meant to prevent or treat other allergy-type conditions, such as sudden allergic reactions, 
hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (an inherited immune disorder), aspergillosis (a fungus-related 
lung disease), food allergy, eczema or hay fever because Xolair has not been studied in these 
conditions. 
Look out for signs of allergic reactions and other serious side effects 
Xolair can potentially cause serious side effects. You must look out for signs of these conditions while 
you use Xolair. Seek medical help immediately if you notice any signs indicating a severe allergic 
reaction or other serious side effects. Such signs are listed under “Serious side effects” in section 4. 
It is important that you receive training from your doctor in how to recognise early symptoms of 
severe allergic reactions, and how to manage these reactions if they occur, before you inject Xolair 
yourself or before a non-healthcare professional gives you a Xolair injection (see section 3, “How to 
use Xolair”). The majority of severe allergic reactions occur within the first 3 doses of Xolair. 
Children and adolescents 
Allergic asthma 
Xolair is not recommended for children under 6 years of age. Its use in children under 6 years of age 
has not been studied. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps 
Xolair is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age. Its use in patients 
under 18 years of age has not been studied. 
Other medicines and Xolair 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
This is especially important if you are taking: 
- 
medicines to treat an infection caused by a parasite, as Xolair may reduce the effect of your 
medicines, 
inhaled corticosteroids and other medicines for allergic asthma.

3. 
How to use Xolair 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, nurse or 
pharmacist if you are not sure. 
How Xolair is used 
Xolair is used as an injection under your skin (known as a subcutaneous injection). 
Injecting Xolair 
- 
You and your doctor will decide if you should inject Xolair yourself. The first 3 doses are 
always given by or under the supervision of a healthcare professional (see section 2). 
It is important to be properly trained on how to inject the medicine before injecting yourself. 
A caregiver (for example a parent) may also give you your Xolair injection after he or she has 
received proper training. 
- 
- 
For detailed instructions on how to inject Xolair, see “Instructions for use of Xolair pre-filled syringe” 
at the end of this leaflet. 
Training to recognise serious allergic reactions 
It is also important that you do not inject Xolair yourself until you have been trained by your doctor or 
nurse on: 
- 
- 
For more information about the early signs and symptoms of serious allergic reactions, see section 4. 
how to recognise the early signs and symptoms of serious allergic reactions. 
what to do if the symptoms occur. 
How much to use 
Your doctor will decide how much Xolair you need and how often you will need it. This depends on 
your body weight and the results of a blood test carried out before the start of the treatment to measure 
the amount of IgE in your blood. 
You will need 1 to 4 injections at a time. You will need the injections either every two weeks, or every 
four weeks. 
Keep taking your current asthma and/or nasal polyps medicine during Xolair treatment. Do not stop 
taking any asthma and/or nasal polyps medicine without talking to your doctor. 
You may not see an immediate improvement after beginning Xolair treatment. In patients with nasal 
polyps effects have been seen 4 weeks after the start of the treatment. In asthma patients it usually 
takes between 12 and 16 weeks to have the full effect. 
171 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Use in children and adolescents 
Allergic asthma 
Xolair can be used in children and adolescents aged 6 years and older, who are already receiving 
asthma medicine, but whose asthma symptoms are not well controlled by medicines such as high dose 
steroid inhalers and beta-agonist inhalers. Your doctor will work out how much Xolair your child 
needs and how often it needs to be given. This will depend on your child’s weight and the results of a 
blood test carried out before the start of the treatment to measure the amount of IgE in his/her blood. 
Children (6 to 11 years of age) are not expected to self-administer Xolair. However, if considered 
appropriate by their doctor, a caregiver may give them their Xolair injection after proper training. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps 
Xolair should not be used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. 
If a dose of Xolair is missed 
If you have missed an appointment, contact your doctor or hospital as soon as possible to re-schedule 
it. 
If you have forgotten to give yourself a dose of Xolair, inject the dose as soon as you remember. Then 
talk to your doctor to discuss when you should inject the next dose. 
If you stop treatment with Xolair 
Do not stop treatment with Xolair unless your doctor tells you to. Interrupting or stopping the 
treatment with Xolair may cause your symptoms to come back. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Important information you need to know before injecting Xolair 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Xolair is for subcutaneous injection only (inject directly into fatty layer under the skin). 
Do not use the pre-filled syringe if either the seal on the outer carton or the seal of the plastic 
tray is broken. 
Do not use if the pre-filled syringe has been dropped onto a hard surface or dropped after 
removing the needle cap. 
Do not inject if the pre-filled syringe has been kept out of the refrigerator for more than a total 
of 48 hours. Dispose of it (see Step 12) and use a new pre-filled syringe for your injection. 
The pre-filled syringe has a safety guard that will be activated to cover the needle after the 
injection is finished. The safety guard will help to prevent needlestick injuries to anyone who 
handles the pre-filled syringe after injection. 
Do not try to re-use or take apart the pre-filled syringe. 
Do not pull back on the plunger. 
Store Xolair 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Store in a refrigerator (2°C to 8°C). The carton containing the pre-filled syringe can be stored 
for a total time of 48 hours at room temperature (25°C) before use. 
Do not freeze. 
Keep the pre-filled syringe in the original carton until ready to use in order to protect from light. 
Keep the pre-filled syringe out of sight and reach of children. 
DOSING TABLE 
Xolair pre-filled syringes are available in 3 dose strengths (one pre-filled syringe in each carton). 
These instructions are to be used for all 3 dose strengths.

Prepare to inject Xolair 
Step 1. Bring to room temperature 
Take the carton containing the pre-filled 
syringe out of the refrigerator and leave it 
unopened so that it reaches room 
temperature (minimum 30 minutes). 
Note: If you need more than one pre-filled 
syringe (one pre-filled syringe per carton) to 
deliver your full dose (see Dosing Table), take 
all the cartons out of the refrigerator at the same 
time. 
Step 2. Gather supplies 
You will need the following supplies (not 
included in the carton): 
• 
Alcohol wipe 
• 
Cotton ball or gauze pad 
• 
Sharps disposal container 
• 
Adhesive plaster 
Step 3. Unpack 
Open the plastic tray by peeling away the 
cover. Remove the pre-filled syringe by holding 
it in the middle as shown. 
Do not remove the needle cap until you are 
ready to inject.

Viewing 
window 
Expiry 
date 
Step 4. Inspect the pre-filled syringe 
Look through the viewing window of the pre-
filled syringe. The liquid inside should be clear 
to slightly cloudy. Its colour may vary from 
colourless to pale brownish-yellow. You may 
see air bubbles in the liquid, which is normal. 
Do not try to remove the air. 
• 
• 
• 
Do not use the pre-filled syringe if the 
liquid contains particles, or if the liquid 
looks distinctly cloudy or distinctly 
brown. 
Do not use the pre-filled syringe if it 
looks damaged or if it has leaked. 
Do not use the pre-filled syringe after the 
expiry date (EXP), which is printed on 
the pre-filled syringe label and carton. 
In all of these cases, contact your doctor, nurse 
or pharmacist. 
Step 5. Choose injection site 
You should inject into the front of the thighs or 
the lower stomach area but not the area 5 cm 
around the belly button. 
Do not inject into skin that is tender, bruised, 
red, scaly or hard or into areas with scars or 
stretch marks. 
Note: If you need more than one pre-filled 
syringe to deliver your full dose, make sure 
your injections are at least 2 cm apart. 
If your caregiver, doctor or nurse is giving you 
the injection, they may also inject into the outer 
upper arm. 
180 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Inject with Xolair 
Step 6. Clean injection site 
Clean your hands. 
Clean the chosen injection site with an alcohol 
wipe. Leave it to dry before injecting. 
Do not touch or blow on the cleaned skin 
before injecting. 
Step 7. Remove needle cap 
Firmly pull straight to remove the needle cap 
from the pre-filled syringe. You may see a drop 
of liquid at the end of the needle. This is 
normal. 
Do not put the needle cap back on. Throw 
away the needle cap. 
Step 8. Insert needle 
Gently pinch the skin at the injection site and 
hold the pinch throughout the injection. With 
the other hand insert the needle into the skin at 
an angle of approximately 45 degrees as shown. 
Do not press the plunger while inserting the 
needle. 
Step 9. Start injection 
Continue to pinch the skin. Slowly press the 
plunger as far as it will go. This will ensure 
that a full dose is injected. 
181 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 10. Complete injection 
Confirm that the plunger head is between the 
safety guard wings as shown. This will ensure 
that the safety guard has been activated and will 
cover the needle after the injection is finished. 
Step 11. Release plunger 
Keeping the pre-filled syringe at the injection 
site, slowly release the plunger until the needle 
is automatically covered by the safety guard. 
Remove the pre-filled syringe from the 
injection site and release the pinch. 
There may be a small amount of blood at the 
injection site. You can press a cotton ball or 
gauze pad over the injection site until any 
bleeding stops. Do not rub the injection site. If 
needed, cover the injection site with a small 
adhesive plaster. 
Note: If you need more than one pre-filled 
syringe to deliver your full dose, throw away 
the used pre-filled syringe as described in 
Step 12. 
Repeat Step 2 to Step 12 again for all the pre-
filled syringes needed to deliver your full dose. 
Carry out the injections immediately one after 
another. 
Make sure the injections are at least 2 cm apart. 
182 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
After the injection 
Step 12. Dispose of the pre-filled syringe 
Put the used pre-filled syringe in a sharps 
disposal container (i.e. a puncture-resistant 
closable container, or similar) immediately after 
use. 
Do not try to put the needle cap back onto the 
syringe. 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about proper 
disposal of the sharps disposal container. There 
may be local regulations for disposal.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Xolair is and what it is used for 
Xolair contains the active substance omalizumab. Omalizumab is a man-made protein that is similar to 
natural proteins produced by the body. It belongs to a class of medicines called monoclonal antibodies. 
Xolair is used for the treatment of: 
- 
- 
allergic asthma 
chronic rhinosinusitis (inflammation of the nose and sinuses) with nasal polyps 
Allergic asthma 
This medicine is used to prevent asthma from getting worse by controlling symptoms of severe 
allergic asthma in adults, adolescents and children (6 years of age and older) who are already receiving 
asthma medicine, but whose asthma symptoms are not well controlled by medicines such as high-dose 
steroid inhalers and beta-agonist inhalers. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps 
This medicine is used to treat chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps in adults (18 years of age and 
older) who are already receiving intranasal corticosteroids (corticosteroid nasal spray), but whose 
symptoms are not well controlled by these medicines. Nasal polyps are small growths on the lining of 
the nose. Xolair helps to reduce the size of the polyps and improves symptoms including nasal 
congestion, loss of sense of smell, mucus in the back of the throat and runny nose. 
Xolair works by blocking a substance called immunoglobulin E (IgE), which is produced by the body. 
IgE contributes to a type of inflammation that plays a key role in causing allergic asthma and chronic 
rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. 
184 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you use Xolair 
Do not use Xolair: 
- 
if you are allergic to omalizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you think you may be allergic to any of the ingredients, tell your doctor as you should not use 
Xolair. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using Xolair: 
- 
- 
if you have kidney or liver problems. 
if you have a disorder where your own immune system attacks parts of your own body 
(autoimmune disease). 
if you are travelling to region where infections caused by parasites are common - Xolair may 
weaken your resistance to such infections. 
if you have had a previous severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), for example resulting from a 
medicine, an insect bite or food. 
- 
- 
Xolair does not treat acute asthma symptoms, such as a sudden asthma attack. Therefore Xolair should 
not be used to treat such symptoms. 
Xolair is not meant to prevent or treat other allergy-type conditions, such as sudden allergic reactions, 
hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (an inherited immune disorder), aspergillosis (a fungus-related 
lung disease), food allergy, eczema or hay fever because Xolair has not been studied in these 
conditions. 
Look out for signs of allergic reactions and other serious side effects 
Xolair can potentially cause serious side effects. You must look out for signs of these conditions while 
you use Xolair. Seek medical help immediately if you notice any signs indicating a severe allergic 
reaction or other serious side effects. Such signs are listed under “Serious side effects” in section 4. 
It is important that you receive training from your doctor in how to recognise early symptoms of 
severe allergic reactions, and how to manage these reactions if they occur, before you inject Xolair 
yourself or before a non-healthcare professional gives you a Xolair injection (see section 3, “How to 
use Xolair”). The majority of severe allergic reactions occur within the first 3 doses of Xolair. 
Children and adolescents 
Allergic asthma 
Xolair is not recommended for children under 6 years of age. Its use in children under 6 years of age 
has not been studied. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps 
Xolair is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age. Its use in patients 
under 18 years of age has not been studied. 
Other medicines and Xolair 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
This is especially important if you are taking: 
- 
medicines to treat an infection caused by a parasite, as Xolair may reduce the effect of your 
medicines, 
inhaled corticosteroids and other medicines for allergic asthma. 
- 
185 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice before using this medicine. Your doctor will discuss with you the benefits and potential risks of 
using this medicine during pregnancy. 
If you become pregnant while being treated with Xolair, tell your doctor immediately. 
Xolair may pass into breast milk. If you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed, ask your doctor for 
advice before using this medicine.

How to use Xolair 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, nurse or 
pharmacist if you are not sure. 
How Xolair is used 
Xolair is used as an injection under your skin (known as a subcutaneous injection). 
Injecting Xolair 
- 
You and your doctor will decide if you should inject Xolair yourself. The first 3 doses are 
always given by or under the supervision of a healthcare professional (see section 2). 
It is important to be properly trained on how to inject the medicine before injecting yourself. 
A caregiver (for example a parent) may also give you your Xolair injection after he or she has 
received proper training. 
- 
- 
For detailed instructions on how to inject Xolair, see “Instructions for use of Xolair pre-filled pen” at 
the end of this leaflet. 
Training to recognise serious allergic reactions 
It is also important that you do not inject Xolair yourself until you have been trained by your doctor or 
nurse on: 
- 
- 
For more information about the early signs and symptoms of serious allergic reactions, see section 4. 
how to recognise the early signs and symptoms of serious allergic reactions. 
what to do if the symptoms occur. 
How much to use 
Your doctor will decide how much Xolair you need and how often you will need it. This depends on 
your body weight and the results of a blood test carried out before the start of the treatment to measure 
the amount of IgE in your blood. 
You will need 1 to 4 injections at a time. You will need the injections either every two weeks, or every 
four weeks. 
Keep taking your current asthma and/or nasal polyps medicine during Xolair treatment. Do not stop 
taking any asthma and/or nasal polyps medicine without talking to your doctor. 
You may not see an immediate improvement after beginning Xolair treatment. In patients with nasal 
polyps effects have been seen 4 weeks after the start of the treatment. In asthma patients it usually 
takes between 12 and 16 weeks to have the full effect.

Use in children and adolescents 
Allergic asthma 
Xolair can be used in children and adolescents aged 6 years and older, who are already receiving 
asthma medicine, but whose asthma symptoms are not well controlled by medicines such as high dose 
steroid inhalers and beta-agonist inhalers. Your doctor will work out how much Xolair your child 
needs and how often it needs to be given. This will depend on your child’s weight and the results of a 
blood test carried out before the start of the treatment to measure the amount of IgE in his/her blood. 
Children (6 to 11 years of age) are not expected to self-administer Xolair. However, if considered 
appropriate by their doctor, a caregiver may give them their Xolair injection after proper training. 
Xolair pre-filled pens are not intended for use in children under 12 years of age. Xolair 75 mg pre-
filled syringe and Xolair 150 mg pre-filled syringe or Xolair powder and solvent for solution for 
injection may be used in children 6-11 years of age with allergic asthma. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps 
Xolair should not be used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. 
If a dose of Xolair is missed 
If you have missed an appointment, contact your doctor or hospital as soon as possible to re-schedule 
it. 
If you have forgotten to give yourself a dose of Xolair, inject the dose as soon as you remember. Then 
talk to your doctor to discuss when you should inject the next dose. 
If you stop treatment with Xolair 
Do not stop treatment with Xolair unless your doctor tells you to. Interrupting or stopping the 
treatment with Xolair may cause your symptoms to come back. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Viewing window 
Expiry date 
Step 4. Inspect the pen 
Look through the viewing window of the pen. 
The liquid inside should be clear to slightly 
cloudy. Its colour may vary from colourless to 
pale brownish-yellow. You may see air bubbles 
in the liquid, which is normal. 
•  Do not use the pen if the liquid contains 
particles, or if the liquid looks distinctly 
cloudy or distinctly brown. 
•  Do not use the pen if it looks damaged. 
•  Do not use the pen after the expiry date 
(EXP), which is printed on the pen label 
and carton. 
In all of these cases, contact your doctor, nurse 
or pharmacist. 
Step 5. Choose injection site 
You should inject into the front of the thighs or 
the lower stomach area but not the area 5 cm 
around the belly button. 
Do not inject into skin that is tender, bruised, 
red, scaly or hard or into areas with scars or 
stretch marks. 
Note: If you need more than one pen to deliver 
your full dose, make sure your injections are at 
least 2 cm apart. 
If a caregiver, doctor or nurse is giving the 
injection, they may also inject into the outer 
upper arm.

Inject with Xolair 
Step 6. Clean injection site 
Clean your hands. 
Clean the chosen injection site with an alcohol 
wipe. Leave it to dry before injecting. 
Do not touch or blow on the cleaned skin 
before injecting. 
Step 7. Remove cap 
Pull the cap straight off in the direction of the 
arrow. 
Do not put the cap back on. Throw away the 
cap. 
Step 8. Position the pen 
Hold the pen comfortably with the needle 
guard directly against the skin. 
The pen should be at a 90°angle to the skin as 
shown. 
Step 9. Start injection 
Push and hold the pen firmly against the skin. 
Listen for the 1st click which indicates that the 
injection has started. 
1st CLICK 
196 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 10. Monitor injection 
Keep holding the pen firmly down against the 
skin. The green indicator shows the progress of 
the injection. 
Step 11. Complete injection 
Listen for the 2nd click. This indicates the 
injection is almost complete. 
Keep holding the pen in position until the 
green indicator has stopped moving to make 
sure the injection is complete. Remove the 
pen from the skin. The needle is automatically 
covered by the needle guard. The injection is 
now complete.

After the injection 
Step 12. Check green indicator 
If the green indicator has not completely filled 
the viewing window, contact your doctor or 
nurse. 
There may be a small amount of blood at the 
injection site. 
You can press a cotton ball or gauze pad over 
the injection site until any bleeding stops. 
Do not rub the injection site. If needed, cover 
your injection site with a small adhesive 
plaster. 
Note: If you need more than one pen to deliver 
your full dose, throw away the used pen as 
described in Step 13. 
Repeat Step 2 to Step 13 again for all the pens 
needed to deliver your full dose. 
Carry out the injections immediately one after 
another. 
Make sure the injections are at least 2 cm apart. 
Step 13. Dispose of the pen 
Put the used pen in a sharps disposal container 
(i.e. a puncture-resistant closable container, or 
similar) right away after use. 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about proper 
disposal of the sharps disposal container. There 
may be local regulations for disposal.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Xolair is and what it is used for 
Xolair contains the active substance omalizumab. Omalizumab is a man-made protein that is similar to 
natural proteins produced by the body. It belongs to a class of medicines called monoclonal antibodies. 
Xolair is used for the treatment of: 
- 
- 
- 
allergic asthma 
chronic rhinosinusitis (inflammation of the nose and sinuses) with nasal polyps 
chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) 
Allergic asthma 
This medicine is used to prevent asthma from getting worse by controlling symptoms of severe 
allergic asthma in adults, adolescents and children (6 years of age and older) who are already receiving 
asthma medicine, but whose asthma symptoms are not well controlled by medicines such as high-dose 
steroid inhalers and beta-agonist inhalers. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps 
This medicine is used to treat chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps in adults (18 years of age and 
older) who are already receiving intranasal corticosteroids (corticosteroid nasal spray), but whose 
symptoms are not well controlled by these medicines. Nasal polyps are small growths on the lining of 
the nose. Xolair helps to reduce the size of the polyps and improves symptoms including nasal 
congestion, loss of sense of smell, mucus in the back of the throat and runny nose. 
Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) 
This medicine is used to treat chronic spontaneous urticaria in adults and adolescents (12 years of age 
and older) who are already receiving antihistamines but whose CSU symptoms are not well controlled 
by these medicines. 
Xolair works by blocking a substance called immunoglobulin E (IgE), which is produced by the body. 
IgE contributes to a type of inflammation that plays a key role in causing allergic asthma, chronic 
rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and CSU. 
199 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you use Xolair 
Do not use Xolair: 
- 
if you are allergic to omalizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you think you may be allergic to any of the ingredients, tell your doctor as you should not use 
Xolair. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using Xolair: 
- 
- 
if you have kidney or liver problems. 
if you have a disorder where your own immune system attacks parts of your own body 
(autoimmune disease). 
if you are travelling to region where infections caused by parasites are common - Xolair may 
weaken your resistance to such infections. 
if you have had a previous severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), for example resulting from a 
medicine, an insect bite or food. 
if you have ever had an allergic reaction to latex. The needle cap of the syringe may contain dry 
rubber (latex). 
- 
- 
- 
Xolair does not treat acute asthma symptoms, such as a sudden asthma attack. Therefore Xolair should 
not be used to treat such symptoms. 
Xolair is not meant to prevent or treat other allergy-type conditions, such as sudden allergic reactions, 
hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (an inherited immune disorder), aspergillosis (a fungus-related 
lung disease), food allergy, eczema or hay fever because Xolair has not been studied in these 
conditions. 
Look out for signs of allergic reactions and other serious side effects 
Xolair can potentially cause serious side effects. You must look out for signs of these conditions while 
you use Xolair. Seek medical help immediately if you notice any signs indicating a severe allergic 
reaction or other serious side effects. Such signs are listed under “Serious side effects” in section 4. 
It is important that you receive training from your doctor in how to recognise early symptoms of 
severe allergic reactions, and how to manage these reactions if they occur, before you inject Xolair 
yourself or before a non-healthcare professional gives you a Xolair injection (see section 3, “How to 
use Xolair”). The majority of severe allergic reactions occur within the first 3 doses of Xolair. 
Children and adolescents 
Allergic asthma 
Xolair is not recommended for children under 6 years of age. Its use in children under 6 years of age 
has not been studied. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps 
Xolair is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age. Its use in patients 
under 18 years of age has not been studied. 
Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) 
Xolair is not recommended for children under 12 years of age. Its use in children under 12 years of age 
has not been studied. 
200 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other medicines and Xolair 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
This is especially important if you are taking: 
- 
medicines to treat an infection caused by a parasite, as Xolair may reduce the effect of your 
medicines, 
inhaled corticosteroids and other medicines for allergic asthma. 
- 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice before using this medicine. Your doctor will discuss with you the benefits and potential risks of 
using this medicine during pregnancy. 
If you become pregnant while being treated with Xolair, tell your doctor immediately. 
Xolair may pass into breast milk. If you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed, ask your doctor for 
advice before using this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
It is unlikely that Xolair will affect your ability to drive and use machines. 
3. 
How to use Xolair 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, nurse or 
pharmacist if you are not sure 
How Xolair is used 
Xolair is used as an injection under your skin (known as a subcutaneous injection). 
Injecting Xolair 
- 
You and your doctor will decide if you should inject Xolair yourself. The first 3 doses are 
always given by or under the supervision of a healthcare professional (see section 2). 
It is important to be properly trained on how to inject the medicine before injecting yourself. 
A caregiver (for example a parent) may also give you your Xolair injection after he or she has 
received proper training. 
- 
- 
For detailed instructions on how to inject Xolair, see “Instructions for use of Xolair pre-filled syringe” 
at the end of this leaflet. 
Training to recognise serious allergic reactions 
It is also important that you do not inject Xolair yourself until you have been trained by your doctor or 
nurse on:

how to recognise the early signs and symptoms of serious allergic reactions 
what to do if the symptoms occur. 
How much to use 
Allergic asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps 
Your doctor will decide how much Xolair you need and how often you will need it. This depends on 
your body weight and the results of a blood test carried out before the start of the treatment to measure 
the amount of IgE in your blood. 
You will need 1 to 4 injections at a time. You will need the injections either every two weeks, or every 
four weeks. 
201 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Keep taking your current asthma and/or nasal polyps medicine during Xolair treatment. Do not stop 
taking any asthma and/or nasal polyps medicine without talking to your doctor. 
You may not see an immediate improvement after beginning Xolair treatment. In patients with nasal 
polyps effects have been seen 4 weeks after the start of the treatment. In asthma patients it usually 
takes between 12 and 16 weeks to have the full effect. 
Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) 
You will need two 150 mg injections at a time every four weeks. 
Keep taking your current medicine for CSU during Xolair treatment. Do not stop taking any medicine 
without talking to your doctor. 
Use in children and adolescents 
Allergic asthma 
Xolair can be used in children and adolescents aged 6 years and older, who are already receiving 
asthma medicine, but whose asthma symptoms are not well controlled by medicines such as high dose 
steroid inhalers and beta-agonist inhalers. Your doctor will work out how much Xolair your child 
needs and how often it needs to be given. This will depend on your child’s weight and the results of a 
blood test carried out before the start of the treatment to measure the amount of IgE in his/her blood. 
Children (6 to 11 years of age) are not expected to self-administer Xolair. However, if considered 
appropriate by their doctor, a caregiver may give them their Xolair injection after proper training. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps 
Xolair should not be used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. 
Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) 
Xolair can be used in adolescents aged 12 years of age and older, who are already receiving 
antihistamines but whose CSU symptoms are not well controlled by these medicines. The dose for 
adolescents aged 12 years and above is the same as for adults. 
If a dose of Xolair is missed 
If you have missed an appointment, contact your doctor or hospital as soon as possible to re-schedule 
it. 
If you have forgotten to give yourself a dose of Xolair, inject the dose as soon as you remember. Then 
talk to your doctor to discuss when you should inject the next dose. 
If you stop treatment with Xolair 
Do not stop treatment with Xolair unless your doctor tells you to. Interrupting or stopping the 
treatment with Xolair may cause your symptoms to come back. 
However, if you are being treated for CSU, your doctor may stop Xolair treatment from time to time 
so that your symptoms can be assessed. Follow your doctor’s instructions. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

4. 
Clean the injection site with an alcohol swab. 
Remove the plastic tray from the box and peel back the paper cover. Gripping the middle of the 
purple syringe guard, lift the syringe out of the tray. 
Inspect the syringe. The liquid should be clear to slightly cloudy. Its colour may vary from 
colourless to pale brownish-yellow. You may see an air bubble, which is normal. DO NOT USE 
if the syringe is broken or if the liquid looks distinctly cloudy or distinctly brown, or contains 
particles. In all these cases, return the entire pack to the pharmacy. 
Holding the syringe horizontally, look into the viewing window to check the expiry date printed 
on the label. Note: It is possible to rotate the inner part of the syringe assembly so that the label 
can be read in the viewing window. DO NOT USE if the product has expired. If expired, return 
the entire pack to the pharmacy.

Disposal instructions 
Keep the plunger fully depressed while you 
carefully lift the needle straight out from the 
injection site. 
Slowly release the plunger and allow the syringe 
guard to automatically cover the exposed needle. 
There may be a small amount of blood at the 
injection site. You can press a cotton ball or 
gauze over the injection site and hold it for 
30 seconds. Do not rub the injection site. You 
may cover the injection site with a small adhesive 
bandage, if needed. 
Dispose of the used syringe immediately in a 
sharps container (closable, puncture resistant 
container). For the safety and health of you and 
others, needles and used syringes must never be 
re-used. Any unused medicinal product or waste 
material should be disposed of in accordance with 
local requirements. Do not throw away any 
medicines via wastewater or household waste.

How to use Xolair 
Possible side effects 
How to store Xolair 
Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Xolair is and what it is used for 
Xolair contains the active substance omalizumab. Omalizumab is a man-made protein that is similar to 
natural proteins produced by the body. It belongs to a class of medicines called monoclonal antibodies. 
Xolair is used for the treatment of: 
- 
- 
- 
allergic asthma 
chronic rhinosinusitis (inflammation of the nose and sinuses) with nasal polyps 
chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) 
Allergic asthma 
This medicine is used to prevent asthma from getting worse by controlling symptoms of severe 
allergic asthma in adults, adolescents and children (6 years of age and older) who are already receiving 
asthma medicine, but whose asthma symptoms are not well controlled by medicines such as high-dose 
steroid inhalers and beta-agonist inhalers. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps 
This medicine is used to treat chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps in adults (18 years of age and 
older) who are already receiving intranasal corticosteroids (corticosteroid nasal spray), but whose 
symptoms are not well controlled by these medicines. Nasal polyps are small growths on the lining of 
the nose. Xolair helps to reduce the size of the polyps and improves symptoms including nasal 
congestion, loss of sense of smell, mucus in the back of the throat and runny nose. 
Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) 
This medicine is used to treat chronic spontaneous urticaria in adults and adolescents (12 years of age 
and older) who are already receiving antihistamines but whose CSU symptoms are not well controlled 
by these medicines. 
Xolair works by blocking a substance called immunoglobulin E (IgE), which is produced by the body. 
IgE contributes to a type of inflammation that plays a key role in causing allergic asthma, chronic 
rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and CSU. 
212 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you use Xolair 
Do not use Xolair: 
- 
if you are allergic to omalizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you think you may be allergic to any of the ingredients, tell your doctor as you should not use 
Xolair. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using Xolair: 
- 
- 
if you have kidney or liver problems. 
if you have a disorder where your own immune system attacks parts of your own body 
(autoimmune disease). 
if you are travelling to region where infections caused by parasites are common - Xolair may 
weaken your resistance to such infections. 
if you have had a previous severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), for example resulting from a 
medicine, an insect bite or food. 
- 
- 
Xolair does not treat acute asthma symptoms, such as a sudden asthma attack. Therefore Xolair should 
not be used to treat such symptoms. 
Xolair is not meant to prevent or treat other allergy-type conditions, such as sudden allergic reactions, 
hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (an inherited immune disorder), aspergillosis (a fungus-related 
lung disease), food allergy, eczema or hay fever because Xolair has not been studied in these 
conditions. 
Look out for signs of allergic reactions and other serious side effects 
Xolair can potentially cause serious side effects. You must look out for signs of these conditions while 
you use Xolair. Seek medical help immediately if you notice any signs indicating a severe allergic 
reaction or other serious side effects. Such signs are listed under “Serious side effects” in section 4. 
It is important that you receive training from your doctor in how to recognise early symptoms of 
severe allergic reactions, and how to manage these reactions if they occur, before you inject Xolair 
yourself or before a non-healthcare professional gives you a Xolair injection (see section 3, “How to 
use Xolair”). The majority of severe allergic reactions occur within the first 3 doses of Xolair. 
Children and adolescents 
Allergic asthma 
Xolair is not recommended for children under 6 years of age. Its use in children under 6 years of age 
has not been studied. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps 
Xolair is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age. Its use in patients 
under 18 years of age has not been studied. 
Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) 
Xolair is not recommended for children under 12 years of age. Its use in children under 12 years of age 
has not been studied. 
213 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other medicines and Xolair 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
This is especially important if you are taking: 
- 
medicines to treat an infection caused by a parasite, as Xolair may reduce the effect of your 
medicines, 
inhaled corticosteroids and other medicines for allergic asthma. 
- 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice before using this medicine. Your doctor will discuss with you the benefits and potential risks of 
using this medicine during pregnancy. 
If you become pregnant while being treated with Xolair, tell your doctor immediately. 
Xolair may pass into breast milk. If you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed, ask your doctor for 
advice before using this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
It is unlikely that Xolair will affect your ability to drive and use machines. 
3. 
How to use Xolair 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, nurse or 
pharmacist if you are not sure 
How Xolair is used 
Xolair is used as an injection under your skin (known as a subcutaneous injection). 
Injecting Xolair 
- 
You and your doctor will decide if you should inject Xolair yourself. The first 3 doses are 
always given by or under the supervision of a healthcare professional (see section 2). 
It is important to be properly trained on how to inject the medicine before injecting yourself. 
A caregiver (for example a parent) may also give you your Xolair injection after he or she has 
received proper training. 
- 
- 
For detailed instructions on how to inject Xolair, see “Instructions for use of Xolair pre-filled syringe” 
at the end of this leaflet. 
Training to recognise serious allergic reactions 
It is also important that you do not inject Xolair yourself until you have been trained by your doctor or 
nurse on: 
- 
- 
For more information about the early signs and symptoms of serious allergic reactions, see section 4. 
how to recognise the early signs and symptoms of serious allergic reactions 
what to do if the symptoms occur. 
How much to use 
Allergic asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps 
Your doctor will decide how much Xolair you need and how often you will need it. This depends on 
your body weight and the results of a blood test carried out before the start of the treatment to measure 
the amount of IgE in your blood. 
You will need 1 to 4 injections at a time. You will need the injections either every two weeks, or every

Keep taking your current asthma and/or nasal polyps medicine during Xolair treatment. Do not stop 
taking any asthma and/or nasal polyps medicine without talking to your doctor. 
You may not see an immediate improvement after beginning Xolair treatment. In patients with nasal 
polyps effects have been seen 4 weeks after the start of the treatment. In asthma patients it usually 
takes between 12 and 16 weeks to have the full effect. 
Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) 
You will need two 150 mg injections at a time or one 300 mg injection every four weeks. 
Keep taking your current medicine for CSU during Xolair treatment. Do not stop taking any medicine 
without talking to your doctor. 
Use in children and adolescents 
Allergic asthma 
Xolair can be used in children and adolescents aged 6 years and older, who are already receiving 
asthma medicine, but whose asthma symptoms are not well controlled by medicines such as high dose 
steroid inhalers and beta-agonist inhalers. Your doctor will work out how much Xolair your child 
needs and how often it needs to be given. This will depend on your child’s weight and the results of a 
blood test carried out before the start of the treatment to measure the amount of IgE in his/her blood. 
Children (6 to 11 years of age) are not expected to self-administer Xolair. However, if considered 
appropriate by their doctor, a caregiver may give them their Xolair injection after proper training. 
Xolair 300 mg pre-filled syringe is not intended for use in children under 12 years of age. Xolair 
75 mg pre-filled syringe and Xolair 150 mg pre-filled syringe or Xolair powder and solvent for 
solution for injection may be used in children 6-11 years of age with allergic asthma. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps 
Xolair should not be used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. 
Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) 
Xolair can be used in adolescents aged 12 years of age and older, who are already receiving 
antihistamines but whose CSU symptoms are not well controlled by these medicines. The dose for 
adolescents aged 12 years and above is the same as for adults. 
If a dose of Xolair is missed 
If you have missed an appointment, contact your doctor or hospital as soon as possible to re-schedule 
it. 
If you have forgotten to give yourself a dose of Xolair, inject the dose as soon as you remember. Then 
talk to your doctor to discuss when you should inject the next dose. 
If you stop treatment with Xolair 
Do not stop treatment with Xolair unless your doctor tells you to. Interrupting or stopping the 
treatment with Xolair may cause your symptoms to come back. 
However, if you are being treated for CSU, your doctor may stop Xolair treatment from time to time 
so that your symptoms can be assessed. Follow your doctor’s instructions. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF XOLAIR PRE-FILLED SYRINGE 
These “Instructions for Use” contain information on how to inject Xolair. 
If your doctor decides that you or your caregiver may be able to give your injections of Xolair at 
home, ensure that your doctor or nurse shows you or your caregiver how to prepare and inject with the 
Xolair pre-filled syringe before you use it for the first time. 
Children below 12 years of age are not expected to inject Xolair themselves, however, if deemed 
appropriate by their doctor, a caregiver may give them their Xolair injections after proper training. 
Be sure that you read and understand these “Instructions for Use” before injecting with the Xolair pre-
filled syringe. Talk to your doctor if you have any questions.

Important information you need to know before injecting Xolair 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Xolair is for subcutaneous injection only (inject directly into fatty layer under the skin). 
Do not use the pre-filled syringe if either the seal on the outer carton or the seal of the plastic 
tray is broken. 
Do not use if the pre-filled syringe has been dropped onto a hard surface or dropped after 
removing the needle cap. 
Do not inject if the pre-filled syringe has been kept out of the refrigerator for more than a total 
of 48 hours. Dispose of it (see Step 12) and use a new pre-filled syringe for your injection. 
The pre-filled syringe has a safety guard that will be activated to cover the needle after the 
injection is finished. The safety guard will help to prevent needlestick injuries to anyone who 
handles the pre-filled syringe after injection. 
Do not try to re-use or take apart the pre-filled syringe. 
Do not pull back on the plunger. 
Store Xolair 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Store in a refrigerator (2°C to 8°C). The carton containing the pre-filled syringe can be stored 
for a total time of 48 hours at room temperature (25°C) before use. 
Do not freeze. 
Keep the pre-filled syringe in the original carton until ready to use in order to protect from light. 
Keep the pre-filled syringe out of sight and reach of children. 
DOSING TABLE 
Xolair pre-filled syringes are available in 3 dose strengths (one pre-filled syringe in each carton). 
These instructions are to be used for all 3 dose strengths.

Prepare to inject Xolair 
Step 1. Bring to room temperature 
Take the carton containing the pre-filled 
syringe out of the refrigerator and leave it 
unopened so that it reaches room 
temperature (minimum 30 minutes). 
Note: If you need more than one pre-filled 
syringe (one pre-filled syringe per carton) to 
deliver your full dose (see Dosing Table), take 
all the cartons out of the refrigerator at the same 
time. 
Step 2. Gather supplies 
You will need the following supplies (not 
included in the carton): 
• 
Alcohol wipe 
• 
Cotton ball or gauze pad 
• 
Sharps disposal container 
• 
Adhesive plaster 
Step 3. Unpack 
Open the plastic tray by peeling away the 
cover. Remove the pre-filled syringe by holding 
it in the middle as shown. 
Do not remove the needle cap until you are 
ready to inject.

Viewing 
window 
Expiry 
date 
Step 4. Inspect the pre-filled syringe 
Look through the viewing window of the pre-
filled syringe. The liquid inside should be clear 
to slightly cloudy. Its colour may vary from 
colourless to pale brownish-yellow. You may 
see air bubbles in the liquid, which is normal. 
Do not try to remove the air. 
•  Do not use the pre-filled syringe if the 
liquid contains particles, or if the liquid 
looks distinctly cloudy or distinctly brown. 
•  Do not use the pre-filled syringe if it looks 
damaged or if it has leaked. 
•  Do not use the pre-filled syringe after the 
expiry date (EXP), which is printed on the 
pre-filled syringe label and carton. 
In all of these cases, contact your doctor, nurse 
or pharmacist. 
Step 5. Choose injection site 
You should inject into the front of the thighs or 
the lower stomach area but not the area 5 cm 
around the belly button. 
Do not inject into skin that is tender, bruised, 
red, scaly or hard or into areas with scars or 
stretch marks. 
Note: If you need more than one pre-filled 
syringe to deliver your full dose, make sure 
your injections are at least 2 cm apart. 
If your caregiver, doctor or nurse is giving you 
the injection, they may also inject into the outer 
upper arm. 
224 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Inject with Xolair 
Step 6. Clean injection site 
Clean your hands. 
Clean the chosen injection site with an alcohol 
wipe. Leave it to dry before injecting. 
Do not touch or blow on the cleaned skin 
before injecting. 
Step 7. Remove needle cap 
Firmly pull straight to remove the needle cap 
from the pre-filled syringe. You may see a drop 
of liquid at the end of the needle. This is 
normal. 
Do not put the needle cap back on. 
Throw away the needle cap. 
Step 8. Insert needle 
Gently pinch the skin at the injection site and 
hold the pinch throughout the injection. With 
the other hand insert the needle into the skin at 
an angle of approximately 45 degrees as shown. 
Do not press the plunger while inserting the 
needle. 
Step 9. Start injection 
Continue to pinch the skin. Slowly press the 
plunger as far as it will go. This will ensure 
that a full dose is injected. 
225 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 10. Complete injection 
Confirm that the plunger head is between the 
safety guard wings as shown. This will ensure 
that the safety guard has been activated and will 
cover the needle after the injection is finished. 
Step 11. Release plunger 
Keeping the pre-filled syringe at the injection 
site, slowly release the plunger until the needle 
is automatically covered by the safety guard. 
Remove the pre-filled syringe from the 
injection site and release the pinch. 
There may be a small amount of blood at the 
injection site. You can press a cotton ball or 
gauze pad over the injection site until any 
bleeding stops. Do not rub the injection site. If 
needed, cover the injection site with a small 
adhesive plaster. 
Note: If you need more than one pre-filled 
syringe to deliver your full dose, throw away 
the used pre-filled syringe as described in 
Step 12. 
Repeat Step 2 to Step 12 again for all the pre-
filled syringes needed to deliver your full dose. 
Carry out the injections immediately one after 
another. 
Make sure the injections are at least 2 cm apart. 
226 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
After the injection 
Step 12. Dispose of the pre-filled syringe 
Put the used pre-filled syringe in a sharps 
disposal container (i.e. a puncture-resistant 
closable container, or similar) immediately after 
use. 
Do not try to put the needle cap back onto the 
syringe. 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about proper 
disposal of the sharps disposal container. There 
may be local regulations for disposal.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Xolair is and what it is used for 
Xolair contains the active substance omalizumab. Omalizumab is a man-made protein that is similar to 
natural proteins produced by the body. It belongs to a class of medicines called monoclonal antibodies. 
Xolair is used for the treatment of: 
- 
- 
- 
allergic asthma 
chronic rhinosinusitis (inflammation of the nose and sinuses) with nasal polyps 
chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) 
Allergic asthma 
This medicine is used to prevent asthma from getting worse by controlling symptoms of severe 
allergic asthma in adults, adolescents and children (6 years of age and older) who are already receiving 
asthma medicine, but whose asthma symptoms are not well controlled by medicines such as high-dose 
steroid inhalers and beta-agonist inhalers. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps 
This medicine is used to treat chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps in adults (18 years of age and 
older) who are already receiving intranasal corticosteroids (corticosteroid nasal spray), but whose 
symptoms are not well controlled by these medicines. Nasal polyps are small growths on the lining of 
the nose. Xolair helps to reduce the size of the polyps and improves symptoms including nasal 
congestion, loss of sense of smell, mucus in the back of the throat and runny nose. 
Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) 
This medicine is used to treat chronic spontaneous urticaria in adults and adolescents (12 years of age 
and older) who are already receiving antihistamines but whose CSU symptoms are not well controlled 
by these medicines. 
Xolair works by blocking a substance called immunoglobulin E (IgE), which is produced by the body. 
IgE contributes to a type of inflammation that plays a key role in causing allergic asthma, chronic 
rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and CSU. 
228 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you use Xolair 
Do not use Xolair: 
- 
if you are allergic to omalizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you think you may be allergic to any of the ingredients, tell your doctor as you should not use 
Xolair. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using Xolair: 
- 
- 
if you have kidney or liver problems. 
if you have a disorder where your own immune system attacks parts of your own body 
(autoimmune disease). 
if you are travelling to region where infections caused by parasites are common - Xolair may 
weaken your resistance to such infections. 
if you have had a previous severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), for example resulting from a 
medicine, an insect bite or food. 
- 
- 
Xolair does not treat acute asthma symptoms, such as a sudden asthma attack. Therefore Xolair should 
not be used to treat such symptoms. 
Xolair is not meant to prevent or treat other allergy-type conditions, such as sudden allergic reactions, 
hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (an inherited immune disorder), aspergillosis (a fungus-related 
lung disease), food allergy, eczema or hay fever because Xolair has not been studied in these 
conditions. 
Look out for signs of allergic reactions and other serious side effects 
Xolair can potentially cause serious side effects. You must look out for signs of these conditions while 
you use Xolair. Seek medical help immediately if you notice any signs indicating a severe allergic 
reaction or other serious side effects. Such signs are listed under “Serious side effects” in section 4. 
It is important that you receive training from your doctor in how to recognise early symptoms of 
severe allergic reactions, and how to manage these reactions if they occur, before you inject Xolair 
yourself or before a non-healthcare professional gives you a Xolair injection (see section 3, “How to 
use Xolair”). The majority of severe allergic reactions occur within the first 3 doses of Xolair. 
Children and adolescents 
Allergic asthma 
Xolair is not recommended for children under 6 years of age. Its use in children under 6 years of age 
has not been studied. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps 
Xolair is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age. Its use in patients 
under 18 years of age has not been studied. 
Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) 
Xolair is not recommended for children under 12 years of age. Its use in children under 12 years of age 
has not been studied. 
229 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other medicines and Xolair 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
This is especially important if you are taking: 
- 
medicines to treat an infection caused by a parasite, as Xolair may reduce the effect of your 
medicines, 
inhaled corticosteroids and other medicines for allergic asthma. 
- 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice before using this medicine. Your doctor will discuss with you the benefits and potential risks of 
using this medicine during pregnancy. 
If you become pregnant while being treated with Xolair, tell your doctor immediately. 
Xolair may pass into breast milk. If you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed, ask your doctor for 
advice before using this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
It is unlikely that Xolair will affect your ability to drive and use machines.

Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, nurse or 
pharmacist if you are not sure 
How Xolair is used 
Xolair is used as an injection under your skin (known as a subcutaneous injection). 
Injecting Xolair 
- 
You and your doctor will decide if you should inject Xolair yourself. The first 3 doses are 
always given by or under the supervision of a healthcare professional (see section 2). 
It is important to be properly trained on how to inject the medicine before injecting yourself. 
A caregiver (for example a parent) may also give you your Xolair injection after he or she has 
received proper training. 
- 
- 
For detailed instructions on how to inject Xolair, see “Instructions for use of Xolair pre-filled pen” at 
the end of this leaflet. 
Training to recognise serious allergic reactions 
It is also important that you do not inject Xolair yourself until you have been trained by your doctor or 
nurse on: 
- 
- 
For more information about the early signs and symptoms of serious allergic reactions, see section 4. 
how to recognise the early signs and symptoms of serious allergic reactions 
what to do if the symptoms occur. 
How much to use 
Allergic asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps 
Your doctor will decide how much Xolair you need and how often you will need it. This depends on 
your body weight and the results of a blood test carried out before the start of the treatment to measure 
the amount of IgE in your blood. 
You will need 1 to 3 injections at a time. You will need the injections either every two weeks, or every 
four weeks. 
230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Keep taking your current asthma and/or nasal polyps medicine during Xolair treatment. Do not stop 
taking any asthma and/or nasal polyps medicine without talking to your doctor. 
You may not see an immediate improvement after beginning Xolair treatment. In patients with nasal 
polyps effects have been seen 4 weeks after the start of the treatment. In asthma patients it usually 
takes between 12 and 16 weeks to have the full effect. 
Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) 
You will need two 150 mg injections at a time or one 300 mg injection every four weeks. 
Keep taking your current medicine for CSU during Xolair treatment. Do not stop taking any medicine 
without talking to your doctor. 
Use in children and adolescents 
Allergic asthma 
Xolair can be used in children and adolescents aged 6 years and older, who are already receiving 
asthma medicine, but whose asthma symptoms are not well controlled by medicines such as high dose 
steroid inhalers and beta-agonist inhalers. Your doctor will work out how much Xolair your child 
needs and how often it needs to be given. This will depend on your child’s weight and the results of a 
blood test carried out before the start of the treatment to measure the amount of IgE in his/her blood. 
Children (6 to 11 years of age) are not expected to self-administer Xolair. However, if considered 
appropriate by their doctor, a caregiver may give them their Xolair injection after proper training. 
Xolair pre-filled pens are not intended for use in children under 12 years of age. Xolair 75 mg pre-
filled syringe and Xolair 150 mg pre-filled syringe or Xolair powder and solvent for solution for 
injection may be used in children 6-11 years of age with allergic asthma. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps 
Xolair should not be used in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. 
Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) 
Xolair can be used in adolescents aged 12 years of age and older, who are already receiving 
antihistamines but whose CSU symptoms are not well controlled by these medicines. The dose for 
adolescents aged 12 years and above is the same as for adults. 
If a dose of Xolair is missed 
If you have missed an appointment, contact your doctor or hospital as soon as possible to re-schedule 
it. 
If you have forgotten to give yourself a dose of Xolair, inject the dose as soon as you remember. Then 
talk to your doctor to discuss when you should inject the next dose. 
If you stop treatment with Xolair 
Do not stop treatment with Xolair unless your doctor tells you to. Interrupting or stopping the 
treatment with Xolair may cause your symptoms to come back. 
However, if you are being treated for CSU, your doctor may stop Xolair treatment from time to time 
so that your symptoms can be assessed. Follow your doctor’s instructions. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Prepare to inject Xolair 
Step 1. Bring to room temperature 
Take the carton containing the pen out of the 
refrigerator and leave it unopened so that it 
reaches room temperature (minimum 
30 minutes). 
Note: If you need more than one pen (one pen 
in each carton) to deliver your full dose (see 
Dosing Table), take all the cartons out of the 
refrigerator at the same time. 
Step 2. Gather supplies 
You will need the following supplies (not 
included in the carton): 
• 
Alcohol wipe 
• 
Cotton ball or gauze pad 
• 
Sharps disposal container

inject. 
Step 4. Inspect the pen 
Look through the viewing window of the pen. 
The liquid inside should be clear to slightly 
cloudy. Its colour may vary from colourless to 
pale brownish-yellow. You may see air bubbles 
in the liquid, which is normal. 
• 
• 
• 
Do not use the pen if the liquid contains 
particles, or if the liquid looks distinctly 
cloudy or distinctly brown. 
Do not use the pen if it looks damaged. 
Do not use the pen after the expiry date 
(EXP), which is printed on the pen label 
and carton. 
In all of these cases, contact your doctor, nurse

Step 5. Choose injection site 
You should inject into the front of the thighs or 
the lower stomach area but not the area 5 cm 
around the belly button. 
Do not inject into skin that is tender, bruised, 
red, scaly or hard or into areas with scars or 
stretch marks. 
Note: If you need more than one pen to deliver 
your full dose, make sure your injections are at 
least 2 cm apart. 
If a caregiver, doctor or nurse is giving the 
injection, they may also inject into the outer 
upper arm. 
Inject with Xolair 
Step 6. Clean injection site 
Clean your hands. 
Clean the chosen injection site with an alcohol 
wipe. Leave it to dry before injecting. 
Do not touch or blow on the cleaned skin 
before injecting. 
Step 7. Remove cap 
Pull the cap straight off in the direction of the 
arrow. 
Do not put the cap back on. Throw away the 
cap.

injection has started. 
1st CLICK 
Step 10. Monitor injection 
Keep holding the pen firmly down against the 
skin. The green indicator shows the progress of 
the injection. 
241 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2nd CLICK 
Step 11. Complete injection 
Listen for the 2nd click. This indicates the 
injection is almost complete. 
Keep holding the pen in position until the 
green indicator has stopped moving to make 
sure the injection is complete. Remove the 
pen from the skin. The needle is automatically 
covered by the needle guard. The injection is 
now complete. 
After the injection 
Step 12. Check green indicator 
If the green indicator has not completely filled 
the viewing window, contact your doctor or 
nurse. 
There may be a small amount of blood at the 
injection site. 
You can press a cotton ball or gauze pad over 
the injection site until any bleeding stops. 
Do not rub the injection site. If needed, cover 
your injection site with a small adhesive 
plaster. 
Note: If you need more than one pen to deliver 
your full dose, throw away the used pen as 
described in Step 13. 
Repeat Step 2 to Step 13 again for all the pens 
needed to deliver your full dose. 
Carry out the injections immediately one after 
another. 
Make sure the injections are at least 2 cm apart. 
242 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 13. Dispose of the pen 
Put the used pen in a sharps disposal container 
(i.e. a puncture-resistant closable container, or 
similar) right away after use. 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about proper 
disposal of the sharps disposal container. There 
may be local regulations for disposal.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Xolair is and what it is used for 
Xolair contains the active substance omalizumab. Omalizumab is a man-made protein that is similar to 
natural proteins produced by the body. It belongs to a class of medicines called monoclonal antibodies. 
Xolair is used for the treatment of: 
- 
- 
allergic asthma 
chronic rhinosinusitis (inflammation of the nose and sinuses) with nasal polyps 
Allergic asthma 
This medicine is used to prevent asthma from getting worse by controlling symptoms of severe 
allergic asthma in adults, adolescents and children (6 years of age and older) who are already receiving 
asthma medicine, but whose asthma symptoms are not well controlled by medicines such as high-dose 
steroid inhalers and beta-agonist inhalers. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps 
This medicine is used to treat chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps in adults (18 years of age and 
older) who are already receiving intranasal corticosteroids (corticosteroid nasal spray), but whose 
symptoms are not well controlled by these medicines. Nasal polyps are small growths on the lining of 
the nose. Xolair helps to reduce the size of the polyps and improves symptoms including nasal 
congestion, loss of sense of smell, mucus in the back of the throat and runny nose. 
Xolair works by blocking a substance called immunoglobulin E (IgE), which is produced by the body. 
IgE contributes to a type of inflammation that plays a key role in causing allergic asthma and chronic 
rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Xolair 
You should not be given Xolair: 
- 
if you are allergic to omalizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you think you may be allergic to any of the ingredients, tell your doctor as you should not be given 
Xolair. 
244 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before you are given Xolair: 
- 
if you have kidney or liver problems. 
- 
if you have a disorder where your own immune system attacks parts of your own body 
(autoimmune disease). 
if you are travelling to a region where infections caused by parasites are common - Xolair may 
weaken your resistance to such infections. 
if you have had a previous severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) for example resulting from a 
medicine, an insect bite or food. 
- 
- 
Xolair does not treat acute asthma symptoms, such as a sudden asthma attack. Therefore Xolair should 
not be used to treat such symptoms. 
Xolair is not meant to prevent or treat other allergy-type conditions, such as sudden allergic reactions, 
hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (an inherited immune disorder), aspergillosis (a fungus-related 
lung disease), food allergy, eczema or hay fever because Xolair has not been studied in these 
conditions. 
Look out for signs of allergic reactions and other serious side effects 
Xolair can potentially cause serious side effects. You must look out for signs of these conditions while 
you use Xolair. Seek medical help immediately if you notice any signs indicating a possible serious 
side effect. Such signs are listed under “Serious side effects” in section 4. The majority of severe 
allergic reactions occur within the first 3 doses of Xolair. 
Children and adolescents 
Allergic asthma 
Xolair is not recommended for children under 6 years of age. Its use in children under 6 years of age 
has not been studied. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps 
Xolair is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age. Its use in patients 
under 18 years of age has not been studied. 
Other medicines and Xolair 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
This is especially important if you are taking: 
- 
medicines to treat an infection caused by a parasite, as Xolair may reduce the effect of your 
medicines, 
inhaled corticosteroids and other medicines for allergic asthma. 
- 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice before using this medicine. Your doctor will discuss with you the benefits and potential risks of 
being given this medicine during pregnancy. 
If you become pregnant while being treated with Xolair, tell your doctor immediately. 
Xolair may pass into breast milk. If you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed, ask your doctor for 
advice before using this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
It is unlikely that Xolair will affect your ability to drive and use machines. 
245 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. 
How Xolair is given 
Instructions on how to use Xolair are given in the section “Information for the healthcare 
professional”. 
Xolair is given to you by a doctor or nurse as an injection just under the skin (subcutaneously). 
Follow carefully all instructions given by your doctor or nurse. 
How much you will be given 
Your doctor will decide how much Xolair you need and how often you will be given it. This depends 
on your body weight and the results of a blood test carried out before the start of the treatment to 
measure the amount of IgE in your blood. 
You will be given 1 to 4 injections at a time, either every two weeks, or every four weeks. 
Keep taking your current asthma and/or nasal polyps medicine during Xolair treatment. Do not stop 
taking any asthma and/or nasal polyps medicine without talking to your doctor. 
You may not see an immediate improvement after beginning Xolair therapy. In patients with nasal 
polyps effects have been seen 4 weeks after the start of the treatment. In asthma patients it usually 
takes between 12 and 16 weeks to have the full effect. 
Use in children and adolescents 
Allergic asthma 
Xolair can be given to children and adolescents aged 6 years and older, who are already receiving 
asthma medicine, but whose asthma symptoms are not well controlled by medicines such as high dose 
steroid inhalers and beta-agonist inhalers. Your doctor will work out how much Xolair your child 
needs and how often it needs to be given. This will depend on your child’s weight and the results of a 
blood test carried out before the start of the treatment to measure the amount of IgE in his/her blood. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps 
Xolair should not be given to children and adolescents under 18 years of age. 
If a dose of Xolair is missed 
Contact your doctor or hospital as soon as possible to re-schedule your appointment. 
If you stop treatment with Xolair 
Do not stop treatment with Xolair unless your doctor tells you to. Interrupting or stopping the 
treatment with Xolair may cause your symptoms to come back. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

INFORMATION FOR THE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL 
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
The lyophilised medicinal product takes 15-20 minutes to dissolve, although in some cases it may take 
longer. The fully reconstituted medicinal product will appear clear to slightly opalescent, colourless to 
pale brownish-yellow and may have a few small bubbles or foam around the edge of the vial. Because 
of the viscosity of the reconstituted medicinal product care must be taken to withdraw all of the 
medicinal product from the vial before expelling any air or excess solution from the syringe in order to 
obtain the 0.6 ml. 
To prepare Xolair 75 mg vials for subcutaneous administration, please adhere to the following 
instructions: 
1. 
Draw 0.9 ml of water for injections from the ampoule into a syringe equipped with a large-bore 
18-gauge needle. 
2.  With the vial placed upright on a flat surface, insert the needle and transfer the water for 
injections into the vial containing the lyophilised powder using standard aseptic techniques, 
directing the water for injections directly onto the powder. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
6. 
7. 
Keeping the vial in an upright position, vigorously swirl it (do not shake) for approximately 
1 minute to evenly wet the powder. 
To aid in dissolution after completing step 3, gently swirl the vial for 5-10 seconds 
approximately every 5 minutes in order to dissolve any remaining solids. 
Note that in some cases it may take longer than 20 minutes for the powder to dissolve 
completely. If this is the case, repeat step 4 until there are no visible gel-like particles in the 
solution. 
When the medicinal product is fully dissolved, there should be no visible gel-like particles in 
the solution. Small bubbles or foam around the edge of the vial are common. The reconstituted 
medicinal product will appear clear to slightly opalescent, colourless to pale brownish-yellow. 
Do not use if solid particles are present. 
Invert the vial for at least 15 seconds in order to allow the solution to drain towards the stopper. 
Using a new 3-ml syringe equipped with a large-bore, 18-gauge needle, insert the needle into 
the inverted vial. Keeping the vial inverted position the needle tip at the very bottom of the 
solution in the vial when drawing the solution into the syringe. Before removing the needle 
from the vial, pull the plunger all the way back to the end of the syringe barrel in order to 
remove all of the solution from the inverted vial. 
Replace the 18-gauge needle with a 25-gauge needle for subcutaneous injection. 
Expel air, large bubbles, and any excess solution in order to obtain the required 0.6 ml dose. A 
thin layer of small bubbles may remain at the top of the solution in the syringe. Because the 
solution is slightly viscous, it may take 5-10 seconds to administer the solution by subcutaneous 
injection. 
The vial delivers 0.6 ml (75 mg) of Xolair. 
8. 
The injections are administered subcutaneously in the deltoid region of the arm, the lower 
abdomen (but not the area 5 centimetres around the navel) or the thigh.

How to store Xolair 
Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Xolair is and what it is used for 
Xolair contains the active substance omalizumab. Omalizumab is a man-made protein that is similar to 
natural proteins produced by the body. It belongs to a class of medicines called monoclonal antibodies. 
Xolair is used for the treatment of: 
- 
- 
- 
allergic asthma 
chronic rhinosinusitis (inflammation of the nose and sinuses) with nasal polyps 
chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) 
Allergic asthma 
This medicine is used to prevent asthma from getting worse by controlling symptoms of severe 
allergic asthma in adults, adolescents and children (6 years of age and older) who are already receiving 
asthma medicine, but whose asthma symptoms are not well controlled by medicines such as high-dose 
steroid inhalers and beta-agonist inhalers. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps 
This medicine is used to treat chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps in adults (18 years of age and 
older) who are already receiving intranasal corticosteroids (corticosteroid nasal spray), but whose 
symptoms are not well controlled by these medicines. Nasal polyps are small growths on the lining of 
the nose. Xolair helps to reduce the size of the polyps and improves symptoms including nasal 
congestion, loss of sense of smell, mucus in the back of the throat and runny nose. 
Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) 
This medicine is used to treat chronic spontaneous urticaria in adults and adolescents (12 years of age 
and older) who are already receiving antihistamines but whose CSU symptoms are not well controlled 
by these medicines. 
Xolair works by blocking a substance called immunoglobulin E (IgE), which is produced by the body. 
IgE contributes to a type of inflammation that plays a key role in causing allergic asthma, chronic 
rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and CSU. 
252 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Xolair 
You should not be given Xolair: 
- 
if you are allergic to omalizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you think you may be allergic to any of the ingredients, tell your doctor as you should not be given 
Xolair. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before you are given Xolair: 
- 
if you have kidney or liver problems. 
- 
if you have a disorder where your own immune system attacks parts of your own body 
(autoimmune disease). 
if you are travelling to a region where infections caused by parasites are common - Xolair may 
weaken your resistance to such infections. 
if you have had a previous severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) for example resulting from a 
medicine, an insect bite or food. 
- 
- 
Xolair does not treat acute asthma symptoms, such as a sudden asthma attack. Therefore Xolair should 
not be used to treat such symptoms. 
Xolair is not meant to prevent or treat other allergy-type conditions, such as sudden allergic reactions, 
hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (an inherited immune disorder), aspergillosis (a fungus-related 
lung disease), food allergy, eczema or hay fever because Xolair has not been studied in these 
conditions. 
Look out for signs of allergic reactions and other serious side effects 
Xolair can potentially cause serious side effects. You must look out for signs of these conditions while 
you use Xolair. Seek medical help immediately if you notice any signs indicating a possible serious 
side effect. Such signs are listed under “Serious side effects” in section 4. The majority of severe 
allergic reactions occur within the first 3 doses of Xolair. 
Children and adolescents 
Allergic asthma 
Xolair is not recommended for children under 6 years of age. Its use in children under 6 years of age 
has not been studied. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps 
Xolair is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age. Its use in patients 
under 18 years of age has not been studied. 
Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) 
Xolair is not recommended for children under 12 years of age. Its use in children under 12 years of age 
has not been studied. 
Other medicines and Xolair 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
This is especially important if you are taking: 
- 
medicines to treat an infection caused by a parasite, as Xolair may reduce the effect of your 
medicines, 
inhaled corticosteroids and other medicines for allergic asthma. 
- 
253 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice before using this medicine. Your doctor will discuss with you the benefits and potential risks of 
being given this medicine during pregnancy. 
If you become pregnant while being treated with Xolair, tell your doctor immediately. 
Xolair may pass into breast milk. If you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed, ask your doctor for 
advice before using this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
It is unlikely that Xolair will affect your ability to drive and use machines. 
3. 
How Xolair is given 
Instructions on how to use Xolair are given in the section “Information for the healthcare 
professional”. 
Xolair is given to you by a doctor or nurse as an injection just under the skin (subcutaneously). 
Follow carefully all instructions given by your doctor or nurse. 
How much you will be given 
Allergic asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps 
Your doctor will decide how much Xolair you need and how often you will be given it. This depends 
on your body weight and the results of a blood test carried out before the start of the treatment to 
measure the amount of IgE in your blood. 
You will be given 1 to 4 injections at a time, either every two weeks, or every four weeks. 
Keep taking your current asthma and/or nasal polyps medicine during Xolair treatment. Do not stop 
taking any asthma and/or nasal polyps medicine without talking to your doctor. 
You may not see an immediate improvement after beginning Xolair therapy. In patients with nasal 
polyps effects have been seen 4 weeks after the start of the treatment. In asthma patients it usually 
takes between 12 and 16 weeks to have the full effect. 
Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) 
You will be given two 150 mg injections at a time every four weeks. 
Keep taking your current medicine for CSU during Xolair treatment. Do not stop taking any medicine 
without talking to your doctor. 
Use in children and adolescents 
Allergic asthma 
Xolair can be given to children and adolescents aged 6 years and older, who are already receiving 
asthma medicine, but whose asthma symptoms are not well controlled by medicines such as high dose 
steroid inhalers and beta-agonist inhalers. Your doctor will work out how much Xolair your child 
needs and how often it needs to be given. This will depend on your child’s weight and the results of a 
blood test carried out before the start of the treatment to measure the amount of IgE in his/her blood. 
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps 
Xolair should not be given to children and adolescents under 18 years of age. 
254 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) 
Xolair can be given to adolescents aged 12 years and older, who are already receiving antihistamines 
but whose CSU symptoms are not well controlled by these medicines. The dose for adolescents aged 
12 years and above is the same as for adults. 
If a dose of Xolair is missed 
Contact your doctor or hospital as soon as possible to re-schedule your appointment. 
If you stop treatment with Xolair 
Do not stop treatment with Xolair unless your doctor tells you to. Interrupting or stopping the 
treatment with Xolair may cause your symptoms to come back. 
However, if you are being treated for CSU, your doctor may stop Xolair treatment from time to time 
so that your symptoms can be assessed. Follow your doctor’s instructions. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

INFORMATION FOR THE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL 
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
The lyophilised medicinal product takes 15-20 minutes to dissolve, although in some cases it may take 
longer. The fully reconstituted medicinal product will appear clear to slightly opalescent, colourless to 
pale brownish-yellow and may have a few small bubbles or foam around the edge of the vial. Because 
of the viscosity of the reconstituted medicinal product care must be taken to withdraw all of the 
medicinal product from the vial before expelling any air or excess solution from the syringe in order to 
obtain the 1.2 ml. 
To prepare Xolair 150 mg vials for subcutaneous administration, please adhere to the following 
instructions: 
1. 
Draw 1.4 ml of water for injections from the ampoule into a syringe equipped with a large-bore 
18-gauge needle. 
2.  With the vial placed upright on a flat surface, insert the needle and transfer the water for 
injections into the vial containing the lyophilised powder using standard aseptic techniques, 
directing the water for injections directly onto the powder. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
6. 
7. 
Keeping the vial in an upright position, vigorously swirl it (do not shake) for approximately 
1 minute to evenly wet the powder. 
To aid in dissolution after completing step 3, gently swirl the vial for 5-10 seconds 
approximately every 5 minutes in order to dissolve any remaining solids. 
Note that in some cases it may take longer than 20 minutes for the powder to dissolve 
completely. If this is the case, repeat step 4 until there are no visible gel-like particles in the 
solution. 
When the medicinal product is fully dissolved, there should be no visible gel-like particles in 
the solution. Small bubbles or foam around the edge of the vial are common. The reconstituted 
medicinal product will appear clear to slightly opalescent, colourless to pale brownish-yellow. 
Do not use if solid particles are present. 
Invert the vial for at least 15 seconds in order to allow the solution to drain towards the stopper. 
Using a new 3-ml syringe equipped with a large-bore, 18-gauge needle, insert the needle into 
the inverted vial. Keeping the vial inverted position the needle tip at the very bottom of the 
solution in the vial when drawing the solution into the syringe. Before removing the needle 
from the vial, pull the plunger all the way back to the end of the syringe barrel in order to 
remove all of the solution from the inverted vial. 
Replace the 18-gauge needle with a 25-gauge needle for subcutaneous injection. 
Expel air, large bubbles, and any excess solution in order to obtain the required 1.2 ml dose. A 
thin layer of small bubbles may remain at the top of the solution in the syringe. Because the 
solution is slightly viscous, it may take 5-10 seconds to administer the solution by subcutaneous 
injection. 
The vial delivers 1.2 ml (150 mg) of Xolair. For a 75 mg dose, draw up 0.6 ml into the syringe 
and discard the remaining solution. 
8. 
The injections are administered subcutaneously in the deltoid region of the arm, the lower 
abdomen (but not the area 5 centimetres around the navel) or the thigh.

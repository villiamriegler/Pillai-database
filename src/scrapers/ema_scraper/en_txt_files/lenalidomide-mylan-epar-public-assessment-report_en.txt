2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Multiple Myeloma (MM) accounts for 1% of all cancers and 10% approximately of all haematological 
malignancies in Caucasians and 20% in African Americans (Dispenzieri A and Kyle RA, 2005; Moreau P 
et al., 2017). The incidence in Europe is 4.5-6.0/100 000/year with a median age at diagnosis of 72 
years; the mortality is 4.1/100 000/year (Moreau P et al., 2017). The incidence of MM is about 1.5 
times higher in males than in females. The prevalence of MM varies from country to country in the 
European Union (EU). Overall, the estimated prevalence of MM in the EU in 2018 ranges from 1.79 to 
3.61 in 10,000 persons (EPAR-Assessment report, Revlimid, 2019).  
Multiple myeloma is characterised by the uncontrolled proliferation of monoclonal plasma cells in the 
bone marrow, leading to production of non-functional intact immunoglobulins or immunoglobulin 
chains. Most patients with MM present with symptoms related to the infiltration of plasma cells into the 
bone or other organs or to kidney damage from excess light chains. The treatment of multiple 
myeloma is complex because of rapid advances in stem cell transplantation, medications, and better 
supportive care, which have led to improved survival over the past 30 years (Kumar SK et al, 2014). 
The main options for treatment include non-chemotherapy drugs that target the cancer cells, standard 
chemotherapy drugs, corticosteroids, and stem cell (bone marrow) transplant.  
Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a systemic neoplasm of the lymphoid tissue displaying germinal centre 
(GC) B cell differentiation. FL represents approximately 5% of all haematological neoplasms and 20–
25% of all new non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnoses in western countries (Carbone et al., 2019). 
Follicular lymphoma is characterised by diffuse lymphadenopathy, bone marrow involvement, and 
splenomegaly. Cytopenias are relatively common. In the absence of transformation to diffuse large B 
cell lymphoma constitutional symptoms of fever, night sweats, and weight loss are uncommon. The 
diagnosis is based on histology from a biopsy of a lymph node or other affected tissue. 
Immunohistochemical staining is positive in virtually all cases for cell surface CD19, CD20, CD10 and 
monoclonal immunoglobulin, as well as cytoplasmic expression of bcl
2 protein. The overwhelming 
majority of cases have the characteristic t(14;18) translocation involving the IgH/bcl
2 genes 
(Freedman et al, 2019). The choice of treatment for FL is highly dependent on patient and disease 
‐
‐
characteristics. In case of limited disease, treatment options include radiotherapy, rituximab 
monotherapy or combination regimens, and surveillance. For advanced disease, the treatment is often 
determined by tumour burden, with surveillance or rituximab considered for low tumour burden and 
chemoimmunotherapy for high tumour burden disease (Matasar et al., 2019). 
This centralised application for marketing authorisation concerns a generic application according to 
Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended for Lenalidomide Mylan 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, 20 and 
25 mg hard capsules. The originator product is Revlimid 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/583241/2020

& 25 mg hard capsules (Celgene Europe Limited), which is currently approved in Europe. 
The proposed medicinal product has for each strength the same qualitative and quantitative 
composition in active substance and the same pharmaceutical form compared to the reference product. 
To support the application, the applicant submitted two bioequivalence studies between Mylan’s 
lenalidomide capsules in strength of 10 mg and 25 mg and reference product, Revlimid Capsules 10 
mg and 25 mg of Celgene Europe Limited, in order to assess bioequivalence between the products. A 
biowaiver of strength has been requested for the remaining strengths: 2.5mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 15 mg, 
and 20 mg. 
The proposed indication for the test product is as follows: 
Multiple myeloma 
Lenalidomide Mylan as monotherapy is indicated for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with 
newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who have undergone autologous stem cell transplantation. 
Lenalidomide Mylan as combination therapy with dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone, 
or melphalan and prednisone (see section 4.2) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for transplant. 
Lenalidomide Mylan in combination with dexamethasone is indicated for the treatment of multiple 
myeloma in adult patients who have received at least one prior therapy. 
During review of the procedure, the applicant applied for an additional indication of the reference 
product as it follows: 
Follicular lymphoma 
Lenalidomide Mylan in combination with rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody) is indicated for the treatment 
of adult patients with previously treated follicular lymphoma (Grade 1 – 3a).

2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of lenalidomide is 3-(4-Amino-1,3-dihydro-1-oxo-2H-isoindol-2-yl)-2,6-
piperidinedione corresponding to the molecular formula C13H13N3O3. It has a relative molecular mass of 
259.27 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
Lenalidomide is an off-white to pale yellow powder that is slightly hygroscopic. It is very slightly 
soluble in water (at 37°C) and slightly soluble across the physiological pH range (1.2 - 8.0).  
The chemical structure of lenalidomide was elucidated by a combination of analytical techniques 
including IR, UV, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, Mass spectroscopy and Elemental analysis.  
The solid-state properties of the active substance were measured by Powder X-ray diffraction (XRPD), 
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA). 
Lenalidomide has an asymmetric carbon atom and can therefore exist as the optically active forms R (-
) and S (+). The active substance manufacturer consistently manufactures it as a racemic mixture. An 
optical rotation (1% w/v solution in dimethyl sulfoxide) study performed on three production scale 
batches of active substance confirms that the racemic mixture is consistently produced.  
Lenalidomide exhibits polymorphism and can exist in seven crystalline and one amorphous polymorphic 
form. The active substance manufacturer consistently manufactures a single polymorphic form as 
confirmed by the data generated from testing of samples from representative batches. The tests for 
identification by XRPD and IR are routinely controlled in the active substance specification and at 
release and on stability. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance information is provided via an Active Substance Master File (ASMF) procedure. 
There is one ASMF Holder.  
Lenalidomide is synthesised in five main steps using well defined starting materials with acceptable 
specifications. The detailed description of the manufacturing process of lenalidomide is provided in the 
Restricted Part of ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. Adequate in-process controls are applied 
during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting 
materials and reagents have been presented and are acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/583241/2020

During the procedure a major objection was raised relating to one of the proposed starting materials 
requesting further justification of its designation as starting material or for it to be redefined as an 
intermediate. The choice the starting material was subsequently justified by the applicant in line with 
the principles of ICH Q11 guideline. The detailed justification was provided in the updated Restricted 
Part of the ASMF. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised. 
The applicant follows the ICH M7 Option 3 approach for controlling four identified potential genotoxic 
impurities based on the fact that they were not detected in three batches of active substance and are 
controlled earlier in the process in various intermediate specifications. In order to support this 
proposed approach, the applicant provided the results from relevant spiking studies. It was 
demonstrated that the proposed limits for these impurities in the intermediate specifications (e.g. 0.50 
%w/w, 0.15 %w/w) are adequate to ensure that the impurities will always be <30% of the TTC (60 
ppm) in the final active substance. The applicants control strategy for potential genotoxic impurities 
was therefore considered acceptable. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the 
clinical development programme. Sufficient details on the manufacturing process development have 
been provided in the Restricted Part of the ASMF. 
The active substance is packaged in a polyethylene (LDPE) bag, twisted and tied with a plastic fastener. 
The polyethylene bag is then placed inside a triple laminated aluminium bag and the triple laminated 
aluminium  bag  is  heat  sealed.  The  triple  laminated  aluminium  bag  is  further  packed  in  HM-HDPE 
container,  closed  with  plastic  lid,  sealed  and  labelled.  The  packaging  materials  comply  with  the  EC 
directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: description (visual), identification (IR, HPLC, 
XRPD), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), related substances (HPLC), content of LEN-I 
(HPLC), assay (HPLC), residual solvents (HS-GC), dimethyl formamide (HPLC), palladium content 
(AAS/ICP-MS) and particle size (Malvern). 
Appropriate specifications for impurities are set in line with the ICH Q3A guideline. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from three production scale batches of the active substance are provided. The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from eight production scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in the intended commercial package for up to 60 months under long term conditions (25ºC / 
60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided.

The following parameters were tested: description, identification (HPLC, XRPD), loss on drying, related 
substances, content of LEN-I, assay.  The analytical methods used were the same as for release and 
were stability. 
All tested parameters were within the specifications and no trends were observed. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. Results on stress 
conditions were also provide on one batch. The results obtained imply degradation by acid and base 
hydrolysis, oxidation and heat for the solution and no degradation by heat for the solid and light (white 
fluorescent light and an integrated UV light). 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 60 months with no special 
storage conditions in the proposed container.

The seven strengths of the finished product were designed into two dose-proportional groups with a 
separate common intermediate for each.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards, with the exception of iron oxides. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product

formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this 
report. 
The Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) for finished product was defined based on the clinical and 
pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics as well as the in vitro dissolution and physicochemical 
characteristics of the reference product (Revlimid) in order to achieve and demonstrate bioequivalence. 
Critical quality attributes (CQAs) were identified based on their direct impact on safety and efficacy and 
the fact that they are influenced by formulation and process variables. The choice of the assay, content 
uniformity, related compounds, dissolution as CQAs has been discussed and is considered acceptable.  
The applicant has applied Quality by Design principles in the development of the finished product and 
the manufacturing process. However, no design spaces were claimed for the manufacturing process of 
the finished product. Risk assessment was used throughout development to identify potentially high-
risk formulation and process variables, and to determine which studies were necessary to achieve 
product and process understanding in order to develop a control strategy. Each risk assessment was 
then updated after development to capture the reduced level of risk based on the improved product 
and process understanding.  
The active substance attributes particle size distribution, chemical stability and flow properties were 
identified as those that could have an potential impact on the finished product CQAs The chosen 
formulation and process adequately mitigates these risks through the use of micronised active 
substance, compatible excipients, dry granulation and active substance-lubricant pre-blending steps. 
The differences to qualitative composition of the finished product and the reference product (Revlimid) 
with respect to excipients are presented in the following table. 
Table 1 Comparison of Excipients between Lenalidomide Mylan and Reference 
Product (Revlimid) 
A dry granulation process (including blend -> compaction -> mill -> blend -> final blend -> 
encapsulation steps) was selected for the manufacture of the finished product. For each unit operation 
that has medium to high risk for product critical quality attributes (CQAs), a risk assessment was 
conducted, and developmental studies were performed to investigate the identified high-risk variables 
to determine the critical material attributes (CMAs) and critical process parameters (CPPs). All process 
parameters (blending time and blender rotation rate) of Initial Blend Process are fixed and there are no 
process variables to investigate. The critical process parameters (CPPs) identified and monitored for 
the compaction/milling step were roll pressure and roll speed. The development studies indicated that 
the output material quality attributes are consistent in relatively wide critical process parameters (CPP) 
ranges. The final blending procedure and conditions (blending speed and time) have been shown to 
produce final blend at exhibit scale with acceptable final blend quality attributes. During the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/583241/2020 
Page 15/49 
 
  
  
 
encapsulation operation the risk is reduced to low as in-process capsule fill weights are tightly 
controlled. Among the attributes of the capsules, weight variation and dissolution are identified as the 
critical output material quality attributes. The effect of encapsulation pressure on active substance 
release was studied and the results indicated that encapsulation pressure has no effect on product 
dissolution.  
The impurity profiles of the Lenalidomide Mylan finished product and the reference product were shown 
to be similar. 
A bio-equivalence study was performed for lenalidomide 10 mg capsules and lenalidomide 25 mg 
capsules. There is no difference between the intended commercial formulation and those used during 
clinical studies. A change of color for 15 mg and 20 mg capsules was made during development.  
There are no differences between the intended commercial process and the one used for the 
production of clinical batches used in bioequivalence studies.  
Justification for selection of a dissolution medium and apparatus has been provided. Comparative 
dissolution profiles of the test product lenalidomide 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg and 
25 mg capsules (manufactured by Mylan) and the European reference product Revlimid (lenalidomide) 
10 mg and 25 mg capsules (Celgene Europe Limited, UK) were generated in different dissolution media 
i.e. QC release media, 0.1 N Hydrochloric acid, pH 4.5 Acetate buffer and pH 6.8 Phosphate buffer. It 
was observed that the release profile of test and reference formulation in QC release media, pH 4.5 
acetate buffer and pH 6.8 phosphate buffer is not similar.  
The difference in profile of the finished product may be attributed to changes in qualitative and 
quantitative composition and manufacturing process between test and reference products. However, 
the test product strengths 10 mg and 25 mg were shown to be bio-equivalent to the respective 
strengths of the reference product. Therefore, it can be concluded that the difference in active 
substance release profile does not have any impact on the in-vivo performance of the product.  
In 0.1N HCl medium the dissolution profiles of test and reference formulations can be considered as 
similar based on guideline CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98-Rev 01. On the basis of the dose proportionality, 
similarity of dissolution among all the strengths of the test product and the established bioequivalence 
of the 10 mg and 25 mg strengths to Revlimid, a bioequivalence waiver was granted for the 2.5 mg, 5 
mg, 7.5 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg strengths. 
The discriminatory power of the QC dissolution method has been demonstrated.  
The finished product is presented in PVC/PCTFE - Alu blister pack (marketable pack), while the bulk 
product is packed in Low-Density Polyethylene (LDPE) bag. The suitability of the selected packaging 
material is confirmed by the stability studies. The finished product manufacturer certificates of analysis 
compliance statements with the relevant EU Directives have been provided for all packaging 
components and are considered satisfactory. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  ten  main  steps:  blending  and  sifting  excipients,  blending  with 
lenalidomide,  co-sifting,  pre-compaction  blending,  compaction,  blending  of  intermediate  granules, 
blending with excipients, sifting, final blending, encapsulation, packaging.  
The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. Although the active substance content 
of some capsules is approximately 2% of composition, if the capsule mass is taken into account, there 
is adequate prior knowledge and understanding of the manufacturing process to consider it standard. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/583241/2020 
Page 16/49 
 
  
  
The process description is considered comprehensive and a summary of the manufacturing conditions 
and operating parameters for the proposed commercial batch size is provided. The in-process controls 
are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form.  
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. Process validation 
has been carried out by the finished product manufacturer for three batches of the two common blends 
at the proposed batch size. The encapsulation step for all strengths has been validated for the smallest 
proposed commercial batch size. Validation studies will be performed on the first three production-scale 
batches with the largest batch size and a process validation protocol/scheme are provided. The process 
validation  scheme  is  based  on  the  critical  process  parameters  and  critical  quality  attributes  already 
discussed in the process validation of the small batch size batches and they are acceptable. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
description/dimension (visual), identification (HPLC/PDA, HPLC), dissolution (Ph. Eur. / HPLC), uniformity 
of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), related compounds (HPLC), LEN 1 Impurity (HPLC), water (Ph. 
Eur.), microbiological test (Ph. Eur.) and colour identifications (in-house). 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing. The finished product specification tests and acceptance criteria are 
appropriately justified and considered to acceptable.  
Based on a maximum daily dose of 25 mg, the ICH Q3B identification threshold is 0.2% and the 
qualification threshold is 0.5%. Hence, the limits for the unspecified and specified impurities are in 
accordance with the identification threshold. During the procedure, the dissolution limit has been 
tightened according to the reflection paper EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/ 336031/2017.  The release 
specification for water has also been tightened based on batch analysis results.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. The assessment 
examined potential sources of elemental impurities and identified components that can introduce 
elemental impurities into the finished product. The theoretical evaluation showed that all Class I and 
2A elements are well below the control threshold of 30% of PDE. Based on the risk assessment it can 
be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls. The information on 
the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
A risk assessment for the presence of nitrosamines in the finished product was performed by the 
applicant applying principles outlined in the EMA notice “Information on nitrosamines for marketing 
authorisation holders”. The applicant considered the formation of nitrosamines impurities in 
Lenalidomide 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg and 25 mg capsules through 
manufacturing process and packaging process (including packaging materials) and it was concluded 
that there is no known risk of nitrosamine impurity formation during these steps. For the 
manufacturing process, it was noted that there is no use of secondary amines, nitrous acid or its 
source or diethylamine. Hence, the possibility for the formation of nitrosamine impurities is ruled out. 
Also, it was noted that there are no recovered materials like recovered solvents, catalysts or reagents

used during the manufacturing process of the finished product. The risk assessment was considered to 
be adequately detailed and in line with the published guidance. 
Batch analysis results are provided for multiple batches (including stability, process validation and 
production batches at commercial scale) confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and 
its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 22 batches of finished product stored for up to 12 months under long term conditions 
(25ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to 
the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for 
marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing (i.e. PVC/PCTFE/Alu blister 
pack). The data provided for each strength was as follows: for 2.5 mg (2 batches), 5mg (3 batches), 7.5 
mg (3 batches), 10 mg (3 batches), 15 mg (4 batches), 20 mg (4 batches), 25 mg (3 batches). 
Samples  were  tested  for  in  line  with  the  shelf  life  specifications.  The  analytical  procedures  used  are 
stability  indicating.  It  is  noted  that  the  results  of  the  dissolution  test  at  the  12-month  interval  of  the 
stability study complied with the tighter acceptance limits agreed during the procedure. 
There  were  no  out  of  specification  results  observed  at  long  term  storage  conditions.  There  was  an 
increase  trend  in  water  content  observed  in  6  batches  stored  at  accelerated  conditions,  however  all 
remained within specification limits. An increase in the levels of impurity was observed at accelerated 
conditions.   
A photostability study of lenalidomide 10 mg, 20 mg and 25 mg capsules conducted in line with ICH 
Q1B concluded that lenalidomide capsules are not photosensitive.   
Forced degradation/stability indicating studies have been performed with samples of finished product 
subjected to environmental degradation conditions and samples of active substance subjected to 
environmental degradation conditions and solution phase degradation conditions. No degradation is 
observed to environmental degradation conditions. The active substance is significantly degraded in 
solution phase base degradation.     
Based on available stability data, and taking account the ICH Q1E guideline, a shelf-life of 15 months 
(2.5 mg) and 24 months (5mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 25 mg) months with storage conditions 
“Do not store above 30°C” as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3 and 6.4) are considered acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
Gelatine obtained from bovine sources is used in the product. Valid TSE CEP from the suppliers of the 
gelatine used in the manufacture is provided.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner.  
A major objection on the choice of one starting material was sufficiently addressed by the applicant 
and the starting material was accepted in line with the principles of ICH Q11 guideline.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/583241/2020

The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, 
which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no 
need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The 
non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity 
profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant performed the Phase I of the ERA according to the ERA guideline 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2).

2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical sections of the SmPC are acceptable and in accordance with those of the reference 
product. The non-clinical overview on the pre-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology 
is considered adequate.  
Concerning Environmental Risk Assessment, the total PECSURFACEWATER value was determined at 
0.007 μg/L, which is below the action limit of 0.01 μg/L. The applicant provided adequate justification 
based on European disease prevalence data, for each approved indication of lenalidomide, for the 
refinement of Fpen. Therefore, a Phase II assessment is not deemed necessary. 
Data on an experimentally derived n-octanol/water partition coefficient (log Kow) for Lenalidomide 
Mylan were submitted by the applicant. The experimentally derived n-octanol/water partition 
coefficient (logKow) for Lenalidomide Mylan was found to be below the trigger of 4.5, indicating a low 
potential for bioaccumulation, comparable to the innovator. Thus, no increase in the environmental 
exposure is expected by the use of Lenalidomide Mylan. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
A summary of the literature with regard to non-clinical data of Lenalidomide Mylan and justifications 
that the active substance does not differ significantly in properties with regards to safety and efficacy 
of the reference product was provided and was accepted by the CHMP. This is in accordance with the 
relevant guideline and additional non-clinical studies were not considered necessary. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for hard capsules containing lenalidomide. To support the marketing 
authorisation application the applicant conducted 2 bioequivalence studies with cross-over design 
under fasting conditions. These studies were pivotal for the assessment. 
No CHMP scientific advice pertinent to the clinical development was given for this medicinal product.  
For the clinical assessment the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr **), the Guideline on Bioanalytical method validation 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/09 Rev.1/Corr. 2**) and Lenalidomide product-specific BE guidance 
(EMA/CHMP/177335/2016/Corr.) in their current versions are of particular relevance.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/583241/2020 
Page 20/49 
 
  
  
 
 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Exemption  
In  order  to  justify  the  biowaiver  of  strengths  the  applicant  made  reference  to  Guideline  on  the 
Investigation  of  Bioequivalence  (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98  Rev.  1/Corr**)  and  Lenalidomide  product-
specific BE guidance (EMA/CHMP/177335/2016/Corr.) 
The in vivo bioequivalence study for the strengths of 1) 2.5 and 5mg (10 mg series) and 2) 7.5, 15 and 
20 mg (25mg series) can be waived as all biowaiver criteria are fulfilled. Specifically: 
- Concerning PK linearity, the maximum concentration (Cmax) and area-under-the-concentration time 
curve  (AUC)  increase  proportionally  with  increases  in  dose.  Multiple  dosing  does  not  cause  marked 
medicinal product accumulation. 
- The pharmaceutical products are manufactured by the same manufacturing process.  
- The qualitative composition of the different strengths is the same.  
- The compositions of the strengths are quantitatively proportional. 
In the case of the last criterion (similar in-vitro performance), the applicant has provided comparative 
dissolution data. Dissolution tests were conducted at different pH values 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8 between:  
1) Lenalidomide Mylan 2.5 and 5mg tablets vs 10mg (batch used for the bioequivalence testing) and  
2) Lenalidomide Mylan 7.5, 15 and 20 mg vs 25mg (batch used for the bioequivalence testing).  
Comparative dissolution profiles of the test product Lenalidomide 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 
mg, 20 mg and 25 mg Capsules (manufactured by Mylan) and the European reference product 
Revlimid (Lenalidomide) 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg and 25 mg Capsules (Celgene 
Europe Limited, UK) were generated in different dissolution media across the pH range of 1.2 to 6.8 
including QC release media. 
The release profile of all the stregnth of test formulation is found to be similar across the pH range of 
1.2  to  6.8  More  than  85%  of  the  labeled  amount  of  the  drug  is  released  within  15  minutes  from  all 
strengths  of  test  product  thus  the  dissolution  profiles  can  be  considered  similar  without  further 
mathematical calculations. 
Test vs Reference product 
The applicant has also presented comparative dissolution profiles of the test product Lenalidomide Mylan 
10 and 25 mg and the reference product Revlimid 10 and 25mg capsules of “Celgene Europe Limited, 
UK, performed in 0.1 N HCl, pH 4.5 acetate buffer and pH 6.8 phosphate buffer. 
Based on the comparative dissolution profiles of the test product Lenalidomide Mylan 10 and 25 mg vs 
the  reference  product  Revlimid  10  and  25mg  capsules  of  “Celgene  Europe  Limited,  UK,  in  0.1  N  HCl, 
pH4.5 acetate buffer and pH 6.8 phosphate buffer: 
- more than 85% of the labelled amount of the drug is released within 15 minutes from the test 
formulation in pH 4.5 acetate buffer and pH 6.8 phosphate buffer whereas relatively slow release was 
observed for reference product  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/583241/2020 
Page 21/49 
 
  
  
- more than 85% of the drug is released within 15 minutes in both the formulation in 0.1N- HCl. 
Clinical studies 
To support the application, the applicant has submitted 2 bioequivalence studies. A study on the 10 mg 
strength is used to support a bio waiver for the 2.5 mg and 5 mg strengths (referred to as the 10 mg 
series) and a study on the 25 mg strength is used to support a bio waiver for the 7.5 mg, 15 mg and 
20 mg strengths (referred to as the 25 mg series).

Study LENA-18009: Single-Dose Fasting Bioequivalence Study of Lenalidomide Capsules (25 mg; 
Mylan) versus Revlimid Capsules (25 mg; Celgene) in Healthy Adult Male Volunteers 
Methods 
Study design  
This was a single-dose, randomised, two-period, two-treatment crossover study investigating the 
bioequivalence of Mylan’s lenalidomide capsules, 25 mg to Celgene’s Revlimid capsules, 25 mg 
following administration of a single, oral dose in 48 healthy, adult male subjects under fasting 
conditions. 
The study protocol dated 28-Mar-2018 was approved by IBIOME-IEC on 25-May-2018.  
The objective of this study was to investigate the bioequivalence of Mylan’s lenalidomide 25 mg 
capsules to Celgene’s Revlimid 25 mg capsules following a single, oral 25 mg (1 x 25 mg) dose 
administration under fasting conditions. 
The test and reference products were administered to the subjects according to the randomisation 
scheme.  
The Study was conducted between 01/11/2018 (First subject treated) and 16/11/2018 (Last subject 
visit). 
The study was initiated with forty-eight (48) healthy adult male subjects. On study day 1, each subject 
received either a single, oral dose of 25 mg (1 × 25 mg) of the test product, lenalidomide capsules, 25 
mg or a single oral dose of 25 mg (1 × 25 mg) of the reference product, Revlimid capsules 25 mg. 
Dosing occurred following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours. There was a 3-day washout period 
between dosing times for the two treatment periods, after which all subjects were dosed with the 
alternative treatment as per the randomisation. In each study period, blood samples were collected 
within 120 minutes prior to dose administration (0 hour) and post-dose at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 
2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 hours. The subjects were allowed to leave the clinical facility 24 
hours after Period 2 dosing. 
The quantification of lenalidomide in plasma was performed using ultra high-performance liquid 
chromatography with tandem mass spectroscopy. 
According to the proposed dosing recommendations lenalidomide can be administered with or without 
food (Revlimid SmPC, 2019). Therefore, the performance of the BE study under fasting state is 
considered acceptable. 
The wash out period of 3 days (more than 7 t1/2) used in the current study is adequate in order to 
ensure that no carry over effects might occur. 
The sampling frequency can be considered adequate to provide a reliable estimate of Cmax based on 
the literature data for Tmax (0.5-3.00 hours) and confirmed by the observed Tmax values (range 0.5-
3.0 hours for treatment A-test product and 0.5-2.5 hours for treatment B-Reference product). 
Monitoring was long enough (16h, approx. 5 t1/2) to cover the plasma concentration-time curve and 
the sampling schedule provided a reliable estimate of the extent of exposure. AUC(0-t) covered at 
least 92% of AUC(0-∞) (AUCextrapolated <20%).

The certificates of analysis of the test and reference product were provided by the applicant (Assay: Test 
product 25 mg: 102.9% and Reference product 25 mg: 100.1%).  
The biobatch size of the test product is acceptable according to the BE guideline. 
Population(s) studied 
Forty-eight (48) Asian subjects were enrolled and dosed in the study, and forty-six (46) subjects 
completed the clinical portion of the study. 
The sample size calculation provided by the applicant is considered acceptable. 
The usual standard inclusion and exclusion criteria for bioequivalence studies were applied: healthy, 
non-tobacco/nicotine using, male volunteers 18-45 years old (inclusive), weighing at least 50 kg (110 
lbs), with a Body Mass Index (BMI) less than or equal to 30 kg/m2 but greater than or equal to 19 
kg/m2, who were judged to be healthy on the basis of a pre-study physical examination and clinical 
laboratory tests. 
The study population chosen is appropriate and in line with current bioequivalence guideline. 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that body weight (33- 135 kg), gender, race and type of 
haematological malignancy (MM, MDS or MCL) do not have a clinically relevant effect on lenalidomide 
clearance in adult patients (Revlimid SmPC, 2019). 
The protocol deviations included:

a) Blood sample collection time deviations for Subjects No 5, 10 and 31 (Treatment B-Revlimid) and  
b) Plasma samples at pre-dose, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 hours post-dose in Period 1 for 
all subjects did not meet the storage criteria mentioned in the protocol (between -55oC to -90oC). Due 
to the frequent opening of the freezer to store plasma samples for the early blood sampling timepoints, 
the freezer temperature rose above -55°C (no higher than -50.75°C) for a short period of time 
(approx. 2-3 hours). Deviations in storage temperature were within the established stability; therefore, 
these deviations had no impact on the affected samples. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical portion of the bioequivalence study no. LENA-18009 was conducted at the Bioanalytical 
Laboratory of the CRC- Mylan Laboratories Ltd. in India, from 08th November 2018 to 13th November 
2018 determining plasma lenalidomide concentrations in the clinical samples from Fasting 
Bioequivalence study.  
The analysis was performed according to Analytical Method Procedure No. “AMP-206-00” and Study 
Protocol No. SP-LENA-18009 Version No.: 00 on three API 4000 LCMS/MS systems using lenalidomide 
13C5 as an internal standard (IS) of the study. The interface used with the systems was a Turbo 
ionspray. The positive ions were measured in MRM mode. 
Samples were collected via an indwelling catheter, inverted 5-10 times immediately after collection and 
immediately placed in an ice bath. The blood samples were placed in the centrifuge within 30 minutes 
from blood sample collection. The samples were then centrifuged at 1900g ± 400g (e.g. 3000 rpm for 
19 cm rotor radius) for 10 minutes under refrigeration (4oC ± 3oC). The plasma was returned to an ice 
bath and transferred into the following labelled polypropylene tubes: SARSTEDT, Inc., Cat. No.: 
60.542, Description: 8 mL PP with cap. 
Each plasma sample was divided equally into two (2) aliquots. Transfer of the samples into the freezer 
took place no later than 90 minutes after the start of centrifugation. The plasma samples were 
maintained in an ice bath until transfer to the storage freezer occurred. Samples were frozen in an 
upright position at -70oC with an acceptable operating range within -55°C to -90oC. 
The details of the collected and analysed samples are described in the following Tables.

The method developed for the analysis of lenalidomide in 100 μL K2EDTA human plasma was 
performed using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectroscopy. The 
lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) was 2.010 ng/mL and the upper limit of quantitation (ULOQ) was 
803.953ng/mL. 
Calibration curve standards (CC) and quality control (QC) samples met the acceptance criteria for all 
the runs used for the final data, demonstrating satisfactory performance of the method during the 
analysis of study subject samples.  
Chromatograms have been presented by the applicant in the LENA-18009 Bioanalytical Study Report 
for standard curve concentration levels, quality control concentrations and unknown blood sample 
assays for subject numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12. 
Validation of the test method 
The applicant has provided the validation report of the test method (VR-2016, Version 00). Specifically, 
the method validation characteristics that were addressed were: Specificity, Selectivity, Carry Over 
effects, Linearity, % Recovery of Analyte and Internal Standard, Matrix effect, Precision and accuracy 
as well as stability.  
There was no re-injection or re-integration in this study.  
All the subject samples with reported final results showed acceptable chromatograms. 
The Analytical method used for the lenalidomide concentration in plasma determination seems to be 
adequately presented and to follow the requirements of the “Guideline on Bioanalytical method 
validation” (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/09 Rev.1/Corr. 2**).  
Concerning Specificity, Selectivity and Injection Carry Over effect no significant interferences at tested 
matrices were observed for Lenalidomide and Internal Standard (Lenalidomide 13C5), while the Limit

of Quantification (2.010 ng/mL) was adequate to quantify low concentration samples. 
The longest storage period prior analysis was 13 days at -70oC for Lena-18009. Long term stability was 
determined for a sufficient time period of 66 days at -70oC.  
The applicant has submitted a bioanalytical report presenting the bioanalysis results of the 
bioequivalence study. The total number of collected samples was 1601 and total number of analysed 
samples with valid results was 1564 (from 46 evaluable subjects). Incurred sample reanalysis was 
performed on 184 samples. 100% of samples were within specifications regarding %Difference 
(repeat-original) with differences between the two values less than 20% of the mean for 
chromatographic assays. 
Pharmacokinetic variables 
Single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters for lenalidomide were calculated using non-compartmental 
techniques.  
The maximum concentration (Cmax) and the time at which it occurred relative to the administered dose 
(Tmax) was determined from the observed plasma concentration-time profile over the sampling time 
interval.  
The elimination rate constant (Kel) was determined by linear regression of the terminal linear phase of 
the log plasma concentration-time profile.  
Area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-t) is the sum of the linear trapezoidal 
estimation of the areas from the time of dosing to the time of the last quantifiable concentration.  
Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to infinity (AUC0-inf) was calculated as: 
AUC0-inf = AUC0-t + LQC/Kel where LQC is the last quantifiable concentration.  
The elimination half-life (t1/2) was calculated as t1/2 = 0.693/Kel. 
The pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax and AUC0-t (primary pharmacokinetic parameters) as well as 
Tmax, Kel, t1/2, and AUC0-inf were computed using non-compartmental model for Lenalidomide of test 
product (T) and reference product (R).  
An internally validated SAS program to calculate non-compartmental PK parameters, including 
automatic Kel selection was used. Both the Kel selection and PK parameter calculation SAS programs 
were validated in Oct 2012 under SAS 9.3 TS for unix AIX server. The SAS macro program validation 
reports have been provided for both Kel and PK parameters.  
The pharmacokinetic variables chosen for demonstration of bioequivalence are appropriate. 
Statistical methods 
Statistical analyses were performed on the pharmacokinetic parameters using the General Linear 
Models Procedure (PROC GLM) of SAS Software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The model tested for 
treatment effects in the parameter means at an alpha level of 0.05.  
The parameters: Tmax, Kel and t1/2 were analysed statistically using the non-transformed data. The 
natural log transformed parameters: LNAUC0-t, LNAUC0-∞ and LNCmax were also analysed. The tests 
were performed to analyse for statistically significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters 
and to determine the test to reference ratios of the pharmacokinetic parameters using Least Squares 
Means. Ninety (90%) percent confidence intervals were constructed using the two one-sided tests 
procedure. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/583241/2020 
Page 28/49 
 
  
  
The 90% confidence interval for the LSMeans ratio of Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-∞ for the test and 
reference product should be between 80.00% and 125.00% for the natural log-transformed data. 
Selection of PK parameters, statistical evaluation of the PK parameters and the acceptance ranges for 
bioequivalence are in accordance with the bioequivalence guideline (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1 
Cor**).  
The SAS proc glm was used to calculate sequence and period effects. In SAS language software, the 
proc glm uses F-test in ANOVA model to determine the p values.

Safety data 
Three (3) post-dose adverse events were experienced by three (3) subjects over the course of this 
Study. The AEs were mild in severity. No serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported.  
None of the AEs reported can be definitively attributed to Treatment A (test product) or Treatment B 
(reference product) since clinical labs were only evaluated at Screening and Study Exit. 
No deaths, other serious adverse events, or other significant adverse events occurred over the course 
of the study. 
All results concerning the laboratory measurements were reviewed by the clinical investigators. Values 
outside the reported reference range were either designated as not clinically significant (NCS) or 
follow-up testing was required. 
Blood and urine samples were collected at the screening visit for clinical laboratory evaluations 
(haematology, biochemistry, urinalysis, serology, urine cotinine test, urine drug screen). Laboratory 
tests (chemistries, haematology or urine) were repeated as needed at the discretion of the investigator 
Assessment report

for subjects whose test values were out of range but not clinically significant. The screening clinical 
laboratory results were reviewed and approved for subject enrolment by the clinical investigators prior 
to Period 1 dose administration. 
There were no clinically significant changes in the clinical laboratory measurements over the course of 
the study which could be reasonably associated with the formulations under investigation.  
Overall, lenalidomide was well tolerated as a single, oral 25 mg (1 x 25 mg capsule) dose administered 
under fasting conditions. Both products were found to be safe and well tolerated. 
Study  LENA-18026:  Single-Dose  Fasting  Bioequivalence  Study  of  Lenalidomide  Capsules  (10  mg; 
Mylan) versus Revlimid Capsules (10 mg; Celgene) in Healthy Adult Male Volunteers 
Methods 
Study design  
This  was  a  single-dose,  randomised,  two-period,  two-treatment  crossover  study  investigating  the 
bioequivalence of Mylan’s lenalidomide capsules, 10 mg to Celgene’s Revlimid capsules, 10 mg following 
administration of a single, oral dose in 48 healthy, adult male subjects under fasting conditions. 
The objective of this study was to investigate the bioequivalence of Mylan’s lenalidomide 10 mg capsules 
to Celgene’s Revlimid 10 mg capsules following a single, oral 10 mg (1 × 10 mg) dose administration 
under fasting conditions. 
The  test  and  reference  products  were  administered  to  the  subjects  according  to  the  randomisation 
scheme.  
The  Study  was  conducted  between  12/03/2019  (First  subject  treated)  and  03/04/2019  (Last  subject 
visit). 
The study was initiated with forty-eight (48) healthy adult male Asian subjects. On study day 1, each 
subject  received  either  a  single,  oral  dose  of  10  mg  (1  ×  10  mg)  of  the  test  product,  lenalidomide 
capsules, 10 mg or a single oral dose of 10 mg (1 × 10 mg) of the reference product, Revlimid capsules 
10 mg. Dosing occurred following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours. There was  a 3-day washout 
period between dosing times for the two treatment periods, after which all subjects were dosed with the 
alternative  treatment  as  per  the  randomisation.  In  each  study  period,  blood  samples  were  collected 
within 120 minutes prior to dose administration (0 hour) and post-dose at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 
2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 hours. The subjects were allowed to leave the clinical facility 24 
hours after Period 2 dosing. 
The  quantification  of  lenalidomide  in  plasma  was  performed  using  ultra  high-performance  liquid 
chromatography with tandem mass spectroscopy. 
The  Bioequivalence  study  was  conducted  under  fasting  conditions  which  is  in  accordance  with  the 
proposed dosing recommendations (Revlimid SmPC, 2019). Therefore, the performance of the BE study 
under fasting state is considered acceptable. 
As noted above for the Lena-18009 BE the wash out period of 3 days used also in the current study is 
adequate in order to ensure that no carry over effects might occur. 
Assessment report

The sampling frequency can be considered adequate to provide a reliable estimate of Cmax based on the 
literature data for Tmax (0.5-3.00 hours) and confirmed by the observed Tmax values (range 0.5-3.0 hours 
for treatment A -test product and 0.5-2.5 hours for treatment B-Reference product). 
Monitoring was long enough (16h, approx. 5 t1/2) to cover the plasma concentration-time curve and the 
sampling schedule provided a reliable estimate of the extent of exposure. AUC(0-t) covered at least 92% 
of AUC(0-∞) (AUCextrapolated <20%).

The protocol deviations presented by the applicant are not expected to have an impact on the results 
of the study. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical portion of the bioequivalence Study No. LENA-18026 was conducted at the Bioanalytical 
Laboratory of the CRC- Mylan Laboratories Ltd. Dr. A.S. Rao Nagar, Hyderabad-500062, India, from 19th 
March 2019 to 25th March 2019 determining plasma Lenalidomide concentrations in the clinical samples 
from Fasting Bioequivalence study. 
The  analysis  was  performed  according  to  Analytical  Method  Procedure  No.  “AMP-206-00”  and  Study 
Protocol No. SP-LENA-18026 Version No.: 1.0 on API 4000 LCMS/MS and Waters Xevo TQ MS system 
using Lenalidomide 13C5 as an internal standard (IS) of the study. The interface used with the systems 
was a Turbo ionspray. The positive ions were measured in MRM mode. 
Samples were collected via an indwelling catheter, inverted 5-10 times immediately after collection and 
immediately placed in an ice bath. The blood samples were placed in the centrifuge within 30 minutes 
from blood sample collection. The samples were then centrifuged at 1900g ± 400g (e.g. 3000 rpm for 
19 cm rotor radius) for 10 minutes under refrigeration (4±3oC). The plasma was returned to an ice bath 
and  transferred  into  the  following  labeled  polypropylene  tubes:  SARSTEDT,  Inc.,  Cat.  No.:  60.542, 
Description: 8 mL PP with cap. 
Each plasma sample was divided equally into two (2) aliquots. Transfer of the samples into the freezer 
took  place  no  later  than  90  minutes  after  the  start  of  centrifugation.  The  plasma  samples  were 
maintained  in  an  ice  bath  until  transfer  to  the  storage  freezer  occurred.  Samples  were  frozen  in  an 
upright position at -70oC with an acceptable operating range within -55°C to -90oC.  
Upon completion of the study, the plasma samples were shipped to the bioanalytical laboratory (Aliquot

05-Jun-2019. 
Information regarding the time span between blood sampling and freezing samples in not specified as in 
LENA -18009 BE study, indicated as protocol deviation.   
The details of the analysed samples are described in the Tables below. 
The assay for lenalidomide was linear from 2.000 ng/mL to 399.908 ng/mL. The method developed for 
the  analysis  of  lenalidomide  in  100  μL  K2EDTA  human  plasma  was  performed  using  ultra  high-
performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectroscopy, which had a limit of quantification 
of 2.010 ng/mL.  
Chromatograms have been presented by the applicant in the LENA-18026 Bioanalytical Study Report for 
standard curve concentration levels, quality control concentrations and unknown blood sample assays 
for subject numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12. 
Validation of the test method 
The applicant has submitted the validation report and the respective results are presented in the LENA 
-18009 study.  
The Analytical method used for the lenalidomide concentration in plasma determination seems to be 
adequately presented and to follow the requirements of the “Guideline on Bioanalytical method 
validation” (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/09 Rev.1/Corr. 2**) (See Relevant Section for LENA-18009). 
The longest storage period prior analysis was 14 days at -70oC for Lena-18026. Long term stability was 
determined for a sufficient time period of 66 days at -70oC.

The applicant has submitted a bioanalytical report presenting the bioanalysis results of the 
bioequivalence study. The total number of collected samples was 1615 and total number of analysed 
samples with valid results was 1598. Incurred sample reanalysis was performed on 157 samples. 
100% of samples were within specifications regarding %Difference (repeat-original) with differences 
between the two values less than 20% of the mean for chromatographic assays. 
Pharmacokinetic variables 
Single-dose  pharmacokinetic  parameters  for  lenalidomide  were  calculated  using  non-compartmental 
techniques.  
The maximum concentration (Cmax) and the time at which it occurred relative to the administered dose 
(Tmax)  was  determined  from  the  observed  plasma  concentration-time  profile  over  the  sampling  time 
interval.  
The elimination rate constant (Kel) was determined by linear regression of the terminal linear phase of 
the log plasma concentration-time profile.  
Area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-t) is the sum of the linear trapezoidal estimation 
of the areas from the time of dosing to the time of the last quantifiable concentration.  
Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to infinity (AUC0-inf) was calculated as: AUC0-
inf = AUC0-t + LQC/Kel where LQC is the last quantifiable concentration.  
The elimination half-life (t1/2) was calculated as t1/2 = 0.693/Kel. 
The pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax and AUC0-t (primary pharmacokinetic parameters) as well as Tmax, 
Kel, t1/2, and AUC0-inf were computed using non-compartmental model for Lenalidomide of test product 
(T) and reference product (R).  
An internally validated SAS program to calculate non-compartmental PK parameters, including automatic 
Kel selection was used. Both the Kel selection and PK parameter calculation SAS programs were validated 
in Oct 2012 under SAS 9.3 TS for unix AIX server. The SAS macro program validation reports have been 
provided for both Kel and PK parameters. 
The pharmacokinetic variables chosen for demonstration of bioequivalence are appropriate.  
Statistical methods 
Statistical analyses were performed on the pharmacokinetic parameters using the General Linear Models 
Procedure (PROC GLM) of SAS Software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The model tested for treatment effects 
in the parameter means at an alpha level of 0.05. The parameters: Tmax, Kel  and t1/2 were analysed 
statistically using the non-transformed data. The natural log transformed parameters: LNAUC0-t, LNAUC0-
inf  and  LNCmax  were  also  analysed.  The  tests  were  performed  to  analyse  for  statistically  significant 
differences  in  the  pharmacokinetic  parameters  and  to  determine  the  test  to  reference  ratios  of  the 
pharmacokinetic  parameters  using  Least  Squares  Means.  Ninety  (90%)  percent  confidence  intervals 
were constructed using the two one-sided tests procedure. 
The determination of biologically implausible (pharmacokinetic) outliers and the statistical method used 
to  identify  statistical  outliers  are  prescribed  in  the  Study  protocol  (see  relevant  section  for  BE  Lena-
18009).

The 90% confidence interval for the LSMeans ratio of Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-∞ for the test and reference 
product should be between 80.00% and 125.00% for the natural log-transformed data. 
Selection of PK parameters, statistical evaluation of the PK parameters and the acceptance ranges for 
bioequivalence  are  in  accordance  with  the  bioequivalence  guideline  (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98  Rev.1 
Cor**). The 90% confidence interval for the LSMeans ratio of Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-∞ for the test and 
reference product was calculated in order to assess bioequivalence.  
The  statistical  methods  chosen  are  considered  appropriate.  The  SAS  proc  glm  was  used  to  calculate 
sequence and period effects. In SAS language software, the proc glm uses F-test in ANOVA model to 
determine the p values.

Statistical  analyses  of  these  data  reveal  that  the  90%  confidence  intervals  are  within  the  acceptable 
bioequivalent  range  of  80.00%  and  125.00%  for  the  natural  log  transformed  parameters,  LNAUC0-t, 
LNAUC0-inf and LNCmax for lenalidomide. This study demonstrates that Mylan’s lenalidomide capsules, 10 
mg are bioequivalent to Celgene’s Revlimid Capsules, 10 mg following administration of a single, oral 10 
mg (1 x 10 mg) dose under fasting conditions. 
Safety data 
Six (6) post-dose adverse events were experienced by five (5) subjects over the course of this study. 
There were four (4) AEs (eosinophil count increased (2), alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate 
aminotransferase increased) that were considered possibly related to study drug administration and two 
(2) AEs (blood cholesterol increased, white blood cell count increased) which were considered unlikely 
related to study drug administration. 
The AEs were mild in severity. No serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported. 
None of the AEs reported can be definitively attributed to Treatment A (test product) or Treatment B 
(reference product) since clinical labs were only evaluated at Screening and Study Exit. 
No deaths, other serious adverse events, or other significant adverse events occurred over the course 
of the study. 
All results concerning the laboratory measurements were reviewed by the clinical investigators. Values 
outside the reported reference range were either designated as not clinically significant (NCS) or follow-
up testing was required. 
Blood  and  urine  samples  were  collected  at  the  screening  visit  for  clinical  laboratory  evaluations 
(haematology,  biochemistry,  urinalysis,  serology,  urine  cotinine  test,  urine  drug  screen).  Laboratory 
tests (chemistries, haematology or urine) were repeated as needed at the discretion of the investigator 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/583241/2020 
Page 36/49 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
for  subjects  whose  test  values  were  out  of  range  but  not  clinically  significant.  The  screening  clinical 
laboratory results were reviewed and approved for subject enrolment by the clinical investigators prior 
to Period 1 dose administration. 
There were no clinically significant changes in the clinical laboratory measurements over the course of 
the study which could be reasonably associated with the formulations under investigation.  
Overall, lenalidomide was well tolerated as a single, oral 10 mg (1 x 10 mg capsule) dose administered 
under fasting conditions. Both products were safe and well tolerated. 
Conclusions 
Based on the presented bioequivalence studies Lenalidomide Mylan is considered bioequivalent with 
Revlimid. 
The results of study LENA-18009 with 25 mg formulation can be extrapolated to other strengths 7.5, 
15 and 20 mg, according to conditions in the Guidelines. 
The results of study LENA-18026 with 10 mg formulation can be extrapolated to other strengths 2.5, 5 
and 10 mg, according to conditions in the Guidelines. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this 
application.  
2.4.4.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The applicant has submitted two bioequivalence studies (LENA-18009 and LENA-18026) which have 
been carried out with the strengths of 25 and 10mg, respectively. The BE study on the 10 mg strength 
was used to support a biowaiver for the 2.5 mg and 5 mg strengths (10mg series) and the study on 
the 25 mg strength was used to support a biowaiver for the 7.5 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg strengths 
(25mg series). 
With regard to the bioequivalence studies submitted by the applicant the study design, study 
population, selection of PK parameters, determination of sample size, statistical evaluation of the PK 
parameters as well as the acceptance ranges for bioequivalence are in accordance with the 
bioequivalence guideline (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1 Cor**).  
The analytical method used for the lenalidomide concentration in plasma determination for both BE 
studies seems to be adequately presented and to follow the requirements of the “Guideline on 
Bionalytical method validation” (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/09). The applicant has performed the 
standard validations for the analytical method. 
The pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax and AUC0-t (primary pharmacokinetic parameters) as well as 
Tmax, Kel, t1/2, and AUC0-inf for both BE studies were computed using non-compartmental model for 
Lenalidomide of test product (T) and reference product (R). An internally validated SAS program was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/583241/2020 
Page 37/49 
 
  
  
  
used to calculate non-compartmental PK parameters, including automatic kel selection. Both the kel 
selection and PK parameter calculation SAS programs were validated in Oct 2012 under SAS 9.3 TS for 
unix AIX server. The SAS macro program validation reports are provided for both kel and PK 
parameters. 
The results of both studies (LENA-18009 and LENA-18026) showed that the ratios of the geometric 
least square mean of ln-transformed data (test/reference) for ln AUC0-t and ln Cmax were within the 
acceptable BE range (80.00%-125.00%).  
The statistical methods chosen are considered appropriate. The SAS proc glm was used to calculate 
sequence and period effects. In SAS language software, the proc glm uses F-test in ANOVA model to 
determine the p values. 
During review, the applicant was requested to discuss the statistical significance of 
formulation/treatment, sequence and period effects shown in the relevant ANOVA tables.  
According to the applicant’s response, the possible reasons for a period or treatment significant effect 
could be due to small/low variability of the PK parameters and/or large sample size. When the intra-
subject CV is small and sample size is large, even a small period or treatment difference would become 
significant. However, the SAS GLM Procedure model utilised for analysis adjusts the period effects 
when it estimates treatment effect. Thus, the results presented in the submitted report took any period 
significant effects into account and adjusted for them in the statistical model utilised for determination 
of treatment effect. The treatment effect can be statistically significant, but when the 90% CI is within 
80-125, the test product can still be considered as equivalent to the Reference product. Thus, based on 
the above the applicant did not anticipate any sequence effect on any PK parameters. The protocol 
deviations presented by the applicant are not expected to have an impact of the results of the study. 
With regard to the safety data, the two formulations were well tolerated, with no apparent differences 
in safety profiles. 
Biowaiver of Strengths 
The in vivo bioequivalence study for the strengths of 1) 2.5 and 5mg (10 mg series) and 2) 7.5, 15 
and 20 mg (25mg series) can be waived as all biowaiver of strength criteria are fulfilled. 
In the case of criterion (d) (similar in-vitro performance), the applicant has provided comparative 
dissolution data and the dissolution profiles can be considered similar. 
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
A summary of the literature with regard to clinical data of Lenalidomide Mylan and justifications that 
the active substance does not differ significantly in properties with regards to safety and efficacy of the 
reference product was provided and was accepted by the CHMP. This is in accordance with the relevant 
guideline and additional clinical studies were not considered necessary. 
Lenalidomide Mylan 10 mg and 25mg can be considered bioequivalent with the originator product 
Revlimid 10 mg and 25mg (Celgene Europe Limited, UK), respectively. 
The results of study LENA-18009 with Lenalidomide Mylan 25mg can be extrapolated to the strengths 
2.5 and 5 mg and the results of LENA-18026 with Lenalidomide Mylan 10 mg can be extrapolated to 
the strengths 7.5, 15 and 20 mg, as in both cases the biowaiver of strength criteria are fulfilled.

2.7.  Product information 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Duloxetine Mylan 30 mg hard gastro-resistant capsules

20mg, 25mg hard capsules package information leaflet for content. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of lenalidomide hard capsules. The reference product 
Revlimid is indicated for:  
Multiple myeloma 
- as monotherapy is indicated for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed 
multiple myeloma who have undergone autologous stem cell transplantation. 
- as combination therapy with dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone, or melphalan and 
prednisone (see section 4.2) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated 
multiple myeloma who are not eligible for transplant. 
- in combination with dexamethasone is indicated for the treatment of multiple myeloma in adult 
patients who have received at least one prior therapy. 
Myelodysplastic syndromes 
- as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with transfusion-dependent anaemia 
due to low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes associated with an isolated deletion 5q 
cytogenetic abnormality when other therapeutic options are insufficient or inadequate. 
Mantle cell lymphoma 
- as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell 
lymphoma (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Follicular lymphoma 
- in combination with rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/583241/2020

with previously treated follicular lymphoma (Grade 1 – 3a). 
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the 
available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. 
From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical 
overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered 
sufficient. 
The bioequivalence studies form the pivotal basis with a randomised, two-period, two-treatment 
crossover design. The study design was considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this 
formulation and was in line with the respective European requirements. Choice of dose, sampling 
points, overall sampling time as well as wash-out period were adequate. The analytical method was 
validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of Lenalidomide Mylan met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when 
compared with the Revlimid. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the 
parameters AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range 
of 80.00 to 125.00%. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Lenalidomide Mylan is favourable in the following indication: 
Multiple myeloma 
Lenalidomide Mylan as monotherapy is indicated for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with 
newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who have undergone autologous stem cell transplantation. 
Lenalidomide Mylan as combination therapy with dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone, 
or melphalan and prednisone (see section 4.2) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for transplant. 
Lenalidomide Mylan in combination with dexamethasone is indicated for the treatment of multiple 
myeloma in adult patients who have received at least one prior therapy. 
Follicular lymphoma 
Lenalidomide Mylan in combination with rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody) is indicated for the treatment 
of adult patients with previously treated follicular lymphoma (Grade 1 – 3a). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following

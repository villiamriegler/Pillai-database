1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

maximum dose of 0.12 mg/kg given twice daily should not 
be exceeded. Increlex is contraindicated in children and 
adolescents with active or suspected neoplasia, or any 
condition or medical history which increases the risk of 
benign or malignant neoplasia. 
There have been post-marketing reports of both benign 
and malignant neoplasms in children and adolescents who 
have received treatment with Increlex.  These cases 
represented a variety of different malignancies and 
included rare malignancies usually not seen in children. 
Current knowledge of IGF-1 biology suggests that IGF-1 
plays a role in malignancies in all organs and tissues. 
Physicians should therefore be vigilant of any symptoms of 
potential malignancy.  
If benign or malignant neoplasia develops, Increlex 
treatment should be discontinued and appropriate expert 
medical care sought. “Benign and malignant neoplasms” 
have been introduced in section 4.8 of the SmPC, with 
frequency “not known”.  
In case of an acute or a chronic overdose, Increlex must be 
discontinued immediately. If Increlex is restarted, the dose 
should not exceed the recommended daily dosage.

diagnosis  to “In some cases, when deemed necessary, the 
physician may decide to assist in the diagnosis by 
performing an IGF-I generation test”. Following a literature 
review, IGFGT test did not prove to be a strong predictor of 
growth response in GH deficiency. However, the test may 
be used to assist the diagnosis. Therefore, the clinician 
decides whether there is a need to use the IGF-1 
generation test to confirm the diagnosis of severe primary 
IGFD.

Update of SmPC section 4.8, upon request by the

SmPC and PL 
A total of 43 cases have been received involving ‘alopecia’ 
CHMP following assessment of PSUR 7, to include the 
ADR 'alopecia'. The Package Leaflet has been 
updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH has taken 
the opportunity to update the contact details of the 
local representatives in the Package Leaflet. 
C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested 
following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a 
PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under Article 
45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - 
Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the 
MAH 
and/or ‘hair texture changes’ (all non-serious events). A 
very small number of these cases reported confounding 
factors. However, in these cases, a causal relationship with 
mecasermin could not be excluded. In three cases 
reporting ‘alopecia’, mecasermin treatment was 
discontinued due to the event. Two cases involving 
‘alopecia’ reported that the patient recovered after the 
mecasermin dose was reduced, demonstrating a dose-
response relationship. One case involving ‘alopecia’ 
reported that the patient recovered despite no action being 
taken with mecasermin treatment. In addition, the 
reporting rate meets the Company’s internal threshold for 
disproptionate reporting. Although very little can be found 
in the literature regarding IGF-1 and adverse events 
relating to hair, it is possible that IGF-1 treatment may 
have an impact on hair growth.

marketing authorisation was granted, the CHMP considers 
that the benefit-risk balance of Increlex in the treatment of 
growth failure in children and adolescents with severe 
primary insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) deficiency 
(primary IGFD) remains favourable and therefore 
recommends the renewal of the marketing authorisation 
under exceptional circumstances. 
The CHMP recommended the renewal of the Marketing 
Authorisation for Increlex, subject to the conditions as laid 
down in Annex II to the Opinion.  
The CHMP considers that the benefit-risk balance of 
Increlex remains positive, but considers that its safety 
profile is to be closely monitored for the following reasons: 
Increlex was granted a MA under exceptional circumstances 
and at the time the available safety data was limited to 76 
subjects with severe primary IGFD. Although more clinical 
safety data has been gathered during the period since the 
granting of the initial MA, the number of patients for whom 
long-term data are available is still limited. For example, it 
was not yet possible to enrol any patients into the registry 
substudy that aims to enrol 100 patients who have reached 
near-adult height and who will be followed for 5 years. 
Thus, the long-term safety of Increlex, including a potential 
effect on the incidence of neoplasia, has not yet been fully 
established.  
The CHMP decided that the PSUR cycle for the product will 
follow the yearly cycle until otherwise agreed by the CHMP.  
Therefore, the CHMP concluded that the MAH should submit 
one additional renewal application in 5 years time. 
In view of new data submitted as part of the renewal 
application, the CHMP recommends amendments to the 
Annexes I, II, IIIA and IIIB. These changes do not affect

change to the safety profile of Increlex. 
Most of the post-authorisation commitments are still 
ongoing and the closely reporting will continue during this

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Polycythaemia vera (PV) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) exhibiting terminal myeloid cell expansion in 
the peripheral blood, resulting in various combinations of erythrocytosis, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, bone 
marrow hypercellularity/fibrosis, and splenomegaly. PV is an acquired form of primary erythrocytosis which is 
characterised by an excess production of erythrocytes, leukocytes and platelets. Erythrocytosis is defined as an 
increase in haematocrit or packed red cell volume caused by different pathological conditions. The term 
“polycythaemia” is often used synonymously with “erythrocytosis”, since leukocytes and platelets are present in 
blood in far smaller proportions than erythrocytes. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
PV is a very rare disease (although being the most common of the MPNs) and typically develops in late 
adulthood. In a 2006 review of the literature, Johansson and colleagues, as well as the latest Orphanet Report 
(as of June 2017) reported a prevalence of PV of approximately 3.0 cases per 10,000 population. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features, Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Two key aspects identify the biology of PV: clonality and erythropoietin (Epo) independence (Medscape, 2016). 
In PV, a single clonal population of erythrocytes, granulocytes, platelets, and variable clonal B cells arises when 
a haematopoietic stem cell gains a proliferative advantage over other stem cells. The T lymphocytes and natural 
killer cells remain polyclonal in PV; this is related to their longevity.  
Erythropoietin-independence is the ability of erythroid colonies formed from the PV haematopoietic stem cell to 
grow without erythropoietin. Although the colonies do not require erythropoietin, they remain responsive to it, 
and the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) is normal without defects in function or quantity. Experiments using 
antibodies to neutralise Epo or block the EpoR do not abolish erythropoietin–independent erythroid colony 
formation.  
Significant progress in the elucidation of the underlying molecular mechanism of PV was made with the 
discovery of a gain of function mutation in the tyrosine kinase Janus-activated kinase-2 (JAK2V617F), which 
now appears to cause most primary PV cases in adults (McLornan et al.,2006). JAK2V617F is detectable in more 
than 95% of patients diagnosed with PV (Tefferi et al., 2007; Quintas-Cardama et al., 2009). Several other 
mutations of JAK2 have since been described (e.g., exon 12, JAK2H538-K539delinsI) (Cario et al., 2003c; Scott 
et al., 2007b). The JAK2 mutations cause the enzyme to be constitutively active. This leads to an “always on” 
signal for cell propagation, inducing a massive overproduction of cell lines that express Epo receptors by both 
cytokine independent proliferation and cytokine hypersensitivity (Tefferi, 2007). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The key clinical features of PV are highly variable and may include increased red blood cell mass (haematocrit), 
increased white blood cell (leucocyte) and platelet counts in the peripheral blood, and splenomegaly in advanced 
disease stages, or any combination of these.  
Assessment report  
EMA/11025/2019 
Page 9/113 
  
  
Mild clinical symptoms of PV are unspecific and related to the increased blood cell count resulting in high blood 
viscosity, e.g. headache, fatigue, dizziness, vision disturbances, vertigo, tinnitus, pruritus, or erythromelalgia.  
However, PV is a long-term debilitating and life-threatening condition as it is associated with the risk of 
thrombosis, haemorrhage and a long term propensity to develop myelofibrosis (MF) and secondary acute 
myeloid leukaemia (AML) (Griesshammer et al., 2015; Stein et al., 2015). 
Since the clinical symptoms are very unspecific, the diagnosis of PV is primarily based on laboratory parameters 
like increased haemoglobin or haematocrit values and the presence of the two most common JAK2 mutations 
[about 90-95% of all patients suffering from PV show either a JAK2V617F or JAK2 exon 12 mutation (Tefferi et 
al, 2007)].  
As erythrocytosis may also be a reaction to a natural or artificial increase in the production of erythropoietin, PV 
has to be distinguished from so-called secondary erythrocytosis. 
Table 1: 2016 WHO diagnostic criteria for PV (Arber et al., 2016) 
Major criteria 
1)  Blood count: 
•  Hgb > 16.5 g/dL (men), > 16.0 g/dL (women) or 
•  Hct > 49% (men), >48% (women) or 
• 
increased red cell mass (RCM)* 
2)  BM biopsy showing hypercellularity for age with trilineage growth 
(panmyelosis) including prominent erythroid, granulocytic, and 
megakaryocytic proliferation with pleomorphic, mature megakaryocytes 
(differences in size) 
3)  Presence of JAK2V617F or JAK2 exon 12 mutation 
Minor criterion 
Subnormal serum erythropoietin (Epo) level 
Diagnosis of PV requires meeting either all 3 major criteria, or the first 2 major criteria and 
the minor criterion 
* More than 25% above mean normal predicted value.  
†Criterion number 2 (BM biopsy) may not be required in cases with sustained absolute erythrocytosis: hemoglobin levels >18.5 g/dL in men 
(hematocrit, 55.5%) or >16.5 g/dL in women (hematocrit, 49.5%) if major criterion 3 and the minor criterion are present. However, initial 
myelofibrosis (present in up to 20% of patients) can only be detected by performing a BM biopsy; this finding may predict a more rapid 
progression to overt myelofibrosis (post-PV MF). 
The median survival of untreated symptomatic patients with PV is 6 to 18 months, whereas survival of treated 
patients is 10 years or more. Accordingly, all patients with symptomatic PV should be treated. 
2.1.5.  Management 
While the WHO guideline appears to be the most recent, internationally-accepted standard for the diagnosis of 
PV and other MPNs, there is no international body that has written universally accepted treatment guidelines for 
PV. The therapeutic goal for PV patients is to alleviate symptoms, reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and 
decrease and/or minimize the risk of progression to MF, MDS or acute leukaemia. Currently available treatment 
options based on a proposed algorithm is illustrated in Figure 1 below (Griesshammer et al 2015). 
Assessment report  
EMA/11025/2019 
Page 10/113 
  
  
 
 
Figure 1: Treatment options based on a proposed algorithm 
In the initial phase of the disease, phlebotomy is the cornerstone of treatment with the objective of maintaining 
haematocrit values below 45%, a cut-off that has been shown to be associated with a lower risk of 
cardiovascular death and major thrombosis. As PV patients are at a high risk of thrombosis, phlebotomy is often 
accompanied by low dose aspirin. In a study by the European Collaboration on Low-dose Aspirin in 
Polycythaemia Vera (ECLAP), the administration of low dose aspirin was shown to significantly reduce the risk of 
non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, pulmonary embolism, major venous thrombosis, or death from 
cardiovascular causes when compared to placebo. 
While phlebotomy and low-dose aspirin are accepted as standard of care for the initial therapy of PV patients, 
cytoreductive therapy is recommended in patients with persistent haematological abnormalities, clinical 
symptoms, poor compliance with or intolerance of phlebotomy, and those at a high risk of thrombosis. Most PV 
patients require cytoreductive therapy during the course of their disease. 
Hydroxyurea (HU), although not approved in all European countries for the use in the treatment of 
polycythaemia vera, is often the first-line cytoreductive therapy used in patients with polycythaemia vera. 
However, hydroxyurea-related toxicities often require either drug reduction or drug discontinuation resulting in 
inadequate management of the disease. Furthermore due of its mechanism of action HU has the potential to be 
mutagenic and it is controversially discussed whether HU is associated with an increased risk of leukemic 
transformation after long-term use in PV patients.  
Since 2015 the JAK2-inhibitor ruxolitinib (Jakavi) is approved in the European Union “for the treatment of adult 
patients with polycythaemia vera who are resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea”.  
Additional antithrombotic medications are used off-label in the therapy of PV and include non-pegylated and 
pegylated interferons, anagrelide and alkylating agents (e.g. busulfan). 
Assessment report  
EMA/11025/2019 
Page 11/113 
  
  
 
Interferons (IFNs) are cytokines with a wide range of biologic properties, including antiviral, 
immune-modulating, anti-proliferative and cellular differentiating effects. Pharmacologically, the binding of 
IFNα to type I IFN receptors induces a conformational change in the intracellular domain of the receptor 
molecules resulting in activation of JAK and tyrosine kinase proteins, phosphorylation of signal transducer and 
activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. Phosphorylated STAT proteins translocate into the nucleus and induce 
the transcription of IFN-stimulated genes within the interferon stimulated response element, which causes 
various effects in the immune system such as modulation of immunoglobulin production, inhibition of T-cell 
cytotoxicity, monocytes / macrophage function and natural killer cell activity (George et al., 2012).  
The exact way IFNα works in Polycythaemia Vera (PV) is not fully understood, but it has been shown that it 
suppresses the proliferation of haematopoietic progenitors, both pluripotent and lineage-committed. It is 
suggested that IFNα has direct effects on MPN stem cells leading to  
• 
• 
• 
depletion of long-term hematopoietic stem cells,  
exit from quiescence and  
enforced terminal differentiation.  
Additionally, IFNα may have direct effects on downstream effector cells leading to reduction in blood counts and 
extramedullary haematopoiesis. The effects of IFNα on preventing fibrotic and/or leukemic transformation have 
not yet been defined (Lane and Mullally, 2013). Dose-dependent suppression of both normal (Epo-stimulated) 
and clonal (neoplastic) haematopoietic progenitors has been demonstrated in vivo and in vitro, and there is 
evidence of a selective action on clonal haematopoietic progenitor cells (Elliott and Tefferi, 1997).  
An overview of known and suspected IFNα mechanism of actions on MPN stem cells, haematopoietic progenitor 
cells, and the related disease initiation and propagation is illustrated in Figure 2 below.

A product specific waiver for ropeginterferon alfa-2b for all subsets of the paediatric population and the condition 
PV was granted by EMA in 2013 (P/0178/2013). 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
Orphan Designation (OD) was granted by the European Commission to AOP for ropeginterferon alfa-2b for the 
treatment of PV on 9 December 2011 (EU/3/11/932) (EMA, 2011).  
The OD was based on the significant benefit of the product compared to other medications for PV licensed in EU 
countries, i.e. the evidence that ropeginterferon alfa-2b may effect haematological remission of the malignant 
clone in PV, without being associated with an increased leukaemogenic risk. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product (FP) is presented as a solution for injection containing 250 micrograms/0.5 ml or 500 
micrograms/0.5 ml of ropeginterferon alfa-2b (INN) as active substance (AS).  
Other ingredients are: sodium chloride, sodium acetate (anhydrous), acetic acid glacial, benzyl alcohol, 
polysorbate 80 and water for injections. 
The product is available as an integrated medicinal product in a pre-filled pen as described in section 6.5 of the 
SmPC, which may be used up to two times, dependent on the prescribed dose. The pen is not refillable. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The molecular mass of ropeginterferon alfa-2b is approximately 60 kilodaltons (kDa). Ropeginterferon alfa-2b  is 
a covalent conjugate of a recombinant proline-interferon alfa-2b and a two-arm methoxypolyethylene glycol 
(mPEG) moiety. Pro-IFN alfa-2b, produced in Escherichia coli, is an approximately 19 kDa non-glycosylated 
polypeptide of 166 amino acids; a 40 kDa two-arm PEG moiety attaches to its N-terminal proline. 
Ropeginterferon alfa-2b contains two pairs of disulfide bonds (cys-2 pairing with cys-99 and cys-30 pairing with 
cys-139) as those found in other interferon alpha-2b products. The secondary and tertiary structures elucidated 
by biophysical characterisation suggest ropeginterferon alfa-2b a monomeric globular protein with a high 
content of alpha helices.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Active substance manufacturing takes place at PharmaEssentia Corporation, Taichung Plant, Taiwan. 
During the procedure, a major objection was raised to request GMP certificates for the AS manufacturing site 
and a specified AS testing site. Satisfactory certificates were subsequently submitted during the procedure.

Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The process is divided into upstream process, downstream process-1 (proline-interferon alfa-2b AS 
intermediate purification), synthesis of the 40 kDa PEG intermediate and downstream process-2 
(ropeginterferon alfa-2b purification) 
The process starts with fermentation in E. coli. The product is expressed as an intracellular protein in the form 
of inclusion bodies. The product is extracted by lysing the cells followed by washing with buffers, and then 
solubilizing the inclusion bodies that contain the product. Downstream processing steps include protein refolding 
and chromatography and ultrafiltration/diafiltration purification steps to produce one proline-interferon alfa-2b 
intermediate batch. This intermediate is stored in a specified Ph.Eur. compliant container (see control of critical 
steps and intermediates).  
Proline-interferon alfa-2b is then PEGylated by attaching a 40 kDa two-arm branched PEG intermediate to the 
N-terminal proline. It is then further purified via chromatography and UF/DF steps to produce the formulated 
active substance. 
 A typical batch size is specified. No reprocessing is claimed.  
The description of the active substance manufacturing process is considered acceptable. The routine in-process 
controls (IPC) along with acceptance criteria, including controls for microbial purity and endotoxin, are described 
for each step. These are acceptable however, as an additional specified IPC during the early stages of 
purification is recommended when data from a stipulated number of batches are available (see 
recommendation).  
The active substance solution is stored in a Ph. Eur.-compliant container and  the transportation is performed in 
a temperature-controlled carrier to maintain the quality. 
Control of materials 
The generation of the cell substrate is well described. The cell substrate for expression of the recombinant 
protein is based on E. coli strain BLR (DE3).  Construction of the expression plasmid is documented and the gene 
encoding Pro-IFN alfa-2b was cloned by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).  
A two tiered cell bank system consisting of master cell bank (MCB) and working cell bank (WCB) has been 
established; characterisation of the cell banks is considered adequate and includes testing for identity, purity, 
viability and genetic characterisation. Extensive testing demonstrating genetic stability has been performed on 
end of production cells (EPC) derived from the MCB and WCB. The strategy for monitoring stability of MCB and 
WCB is considered adequate. A protocol for establishment of future WCBs has been provided. 
Sufficient information on raw materials used in the active substance manufacturing process has been submitted. 
Compendial raw materials are tested in accordance with the corresponding monograph, while specifications 
(including test methods) for non-compendial raw materials are presented. Information is provided on two 
materials of animal origin - isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and stearate (see Adventitious Agents 
section). No other components of animal and/or human origin are declared. 
The 40 kDa mPEG-intermediate, which is critical for the quality of the product, has been re-defined as an 
intermediate during the procedure as a result of a major objection. The new PEG starting materials have been 
defined in the dossier accordingly. The mode of preparation and quality controls of the new starting materials 
were appropriately documented. 
Assessment report  
EMA/11025/2019

Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The criticality assessment and the evaluation of CQAs, CPPs, and IPCs are considered acceptable. During the 
procedure, a major objection was raised on the control strategy for the manufacturing process of the active 
substance because it had not been unambiguously defined and justified.  The criticality assessment was then 
repeated and the control strategy revised. The applicant has re-evaluated CQAs, CPPs, and IPCs. Consequently 
more IPC items are now proposed for commercial production. Information on IPC testing at different stages of 
process development and process validation has been presented. IPC testing for commercial production is now 
provided in a transparent form and considered satisfactory. Based on the results, critical process steps have 
been suitably defined. For all process parameters (critical and non-critical), operating ranges were set. The 
PEGylation reagent is a 40 kDa branched PEG which, as mentioned above, has been re-classified as an 
intermediate during the procedure. 
The route of synthesis as well as the process parameters and in-process controls of the 40 kDa PEG  
intermediate are suitably described in the dossier. The specification of the 40 kDa PEG intermediate was justified 
and completed with the requested parameters during the procedure. The fate and purge of impurities generated 
throughout the production of the intermediate were also satisfactorily addressed. An appropriate QP declaration 
has been provided confirming appropriate audit of the sites and that the manufacture of the intermediate 
complies with the principles and guidelines of good manufacturing practice. The shelf-life for the PEG 
intermediate under the specified storage condition is agreed.  
The specification includes appropriate tests for identity, potency/content, purity and physicochemical attributes. 
Re-validation of some AS intermediate chromatographic analytical methods has been initiated upon request. 
While re-validation has been finalised for some of these methods and updated documents have been provided, 
re-validation reports for other specified chromatographic analytical methods (which may continue to be used for 
release of marketed product) should be submitted post-authorisation (see recommendations). 
Batch data (from process validation and GMP lots) demonstrate that test results met the set acceptance criteria. 
However, it is recommended to re-evaluate the acceptance criteria for the AS intermediate after re-validation 
with the new standards (recommendation). In response to a major objection regarding the shelf-life for the 
intermediate in the specified container, the shelf-life has been acceptably revised. 
Process validation 
The active substance manufacturing process is considered validated for the process from the seed culture to 
Pro-IFN alfa-2b and to ropeginterferon alfa-2b. Consistency of the manufacturing process has been shown on a 
suitable number of batches at commercial production scale. Evaluation of process-parameters and in-process 
controls demonstrate that the manufacturing process of ropeginterferon alfa-2b is consistent. 
To understand the depletion capacity of the manufacturing process for impurities, validation studies for removal 
of product- and process-related impurities were performed and samples taken from different process steps were 
monitored. The potential process-related impurities for Pro-IFN alfa-2b AS intermediate may derive from 
medium components, additives, and host cell components. The medium component and chemical additives have 
been described. The host cell derived impurities include host cell proteins, residual DNA, and endotoxin. The 
removal of these process-related impurities is suitably demonstrated. The potential process-related impurities 
resulted from the PEGylation reaction have also been defined. The removal of these process-related impurities 
is also suitably demonstrated. In conclusion, the current manufacturing process is capable of effectively and 
consistently reducing these impurities to low levels. Most of the process-related impurities are below the LOQ. 
Assessment report  
EMA/11025/2019 
Page 15/113 
  
  
Sufficient information on holding times of process intermediates has been provided. It has been demonstrated 
that quality of the commercial AS is representative of that of the materials used in the clinical trials. 
The column lifetime was addressed using small-scale and full-scales analyses. The testing program included 
controls for purity, impurities, recovery and performance. Potential leachables were adequately addressed. The 
containers used for the storage of AS are generally considered as inert, non-reactive, and non-leachable 
material for injectable solution. Stability studies have also confirmed the suitability of the storage container. 
Manufacturing process development 
The process development history is appropriately documented. Comparability between active substances 
resulting from the different processes over historical development has been demonstrated. The process 
validation runs were performed using the commercial process. The analytical results at release are consistent 
between batches. The critical quality attributes (CQAs) of ropeginterferon alfa-2b were identified and risk was 
assessed using failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA), and then the higher risk process steps and operating 
parameters were further investigated in process characterisation studies.  
Characterisation 
Ropeginterferon alfa-2b is a PEGylated recombinant human IFN alpha-2b with addition of an extra amino acid 
(proline) at the N-terminus. The applicant claims it is a long-acting interferon with only one major isoform in 
contrast to the 8-14 isomers of other approved, PEGylated interferon products. 
Characterisation studies for the AS intermediate as well as for the active substance were performed with batches 
manufactured using the process considered representative of the commercial manufacturing process.  
Interferon alfa-2 is a non-glycosylated polypeptide chain of 165 amino acid residues. Different types of alfa-2 
interferon exist, varying in the amino acid residue at position 23. The selected one for this product is interferon 
alpha-2b, with arginine at position 23. Proline-interferon alfa-2b contains an identical amino acid sequence to 
interferon alpha-2b plus an extra proline at the N-terminus (166 amino acid residues). Ropeginterferon alfa-2b 
is a PEGylated proline-interferon alfa-2b synthesized by conjugating a single 40 kDa PEG molecule to the 
N-terminal proline residue. Similar to Pro-IFN alfa-2b, ropeginterferon alfa-2b was also confirmed to contain two 
pairs of disulfide bonds, (Cys-2)-(Cys-99) and (Cys-30)-(Cys-139). 
The structures of the AS intermediate and the active substance were elucidated using a variety of 
physico-chemical (e.g. peptide mapping, N- and C-terminal sequencing, electrophoretic and liquid 
chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis (LC-MS), SE-HPLC, RP-HPLC, IEX-HPLC, etc.), biophysical, and 
biological (cytopathic effect (CPE)-based potency assay and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding assay) 
techniques to provide a comprehensive understanding of their structure and functional properties and impurity 
profile. 
The primary sequence of the AS was confirmed using peptide map/ RP-HPLC/ LC-MS/MS with 100% sequence 
coverage. Likewise, molecular mass of the intact protein, extinction coefficient, and presence of disulfide bridges 
as well as secondary and tertiary structure profiles of AS sample and respective reference batches were 
confirmed to be superimposable. Only one main PEGylation site was determined; positional isomers, i.e. 
mono-PEGylated products with different PEGylation sites, were detected at relatively low level using IEX-HPLC.  
Active substance samples have been investigated for oxidized forms, deamidated forms, positional isomers and 
different pegylated forms and levels are suitably controlled.  Biological characterisation includes cytopathic 
effect-based potency assay (antiviral assay) and ligand/receptor binding assay. The antiviral bioassay is 
proposed for routine use while the ligand/receptor binding assay, intended for characterisation use, monitors 
Assessment report  
EMA/11025/2019 
Page 16/113 
  
  
the binding affinity of AS intermediate active substance toward both chains (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2) of the Type I 
IFN receptor.  
Comprehensive data are available for the characterisation of active substance intermediate as well as the active 
substance. With the D150 and D180 response most of the variants detectable using chromatographic analyses 
have been identified and quantified. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes all the critical quality attributes that affect the manufacturing and 
quality of the finished product. A summary of testing parameters and methods and the corresponding 
acceptance criteria have been provided. The specification includes testing of purity (endotoxin-Ph. Eur.; 
bioburden -Ph. Eur.), product-related impurities, process-related impurities, identity, potency (CPE antiviral 
assay), protein content (Ph. Eur.), and several general tests.  
Most methods used in characterisation studies to determine the purity/impurity profile of ropeginterferon 
alfa-2b are included in the specification. Based on the additional characterisation data provided with the D150 
and D180 response, revised purity/impurity specifications were proposed for the active substance. Furthermore 
and in accordance with the provided characterisation data SDS-PAGE analysis/ coomassie method has been 
replaced by SDS-PAGE/ silver staining method and refined impurity acceptance criteria have been implemented. 
Free Pro-IFN alfa-2b is now determined using SE-HPLC.   
The general approach to justify the proposed specification taking into consideration historical process batch data 
as well as stability data is considered adequate and some limits were requested to be tightened during the 
procedure.  
In addition, it is recommended to re-evaluate the HCP acceptance criteria for the active substance and to tighten 
the specification once a specified number of commercial batches have been manufactured (see 
recommendations). 
Analytical methods 
Many of the analytical procedures applied for control of the active substance are in-house methods for which 
acceptable descriptions were provided. The basis for calculation of AS purity has been clarified. Representative 
chromatograms have been provided. In-house, process-specific HCP enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) is used for determining the HCP content. Satisfactory information on analytical validation for 
non-pharmacopoeial methods has been provided in line with ICH guidelines. Pharmacopoeial methods have 
been verified.   
The applicant proposes to use the antiviral potency assay described in Ph. Eur. monograph for release/stability 
testing. The bioactivity of active substance is determined using a CPE-based bioassay that measures the ability 
of the protein sample to protect A549 epithelial lung carcinoma cells from cytotoxicity due to infection with the 
EMCV. The applicant will include this antiviral potency assay described in the Ph. Eur. monograph for 
release/stability testing. An alternative assay with improved sensitivity is currently under development and may 
be introduced as an orthogonal alternative/replacement assay to the antiviral assay (see recommendations). 
Batch analysis 
Batch information and active substance release data of active substance for a suitable number of process 
validation lots and several GMP lots - all at commercial-scale- are provided. The results are within the 
Assessment report  
EMA/11025/2019 
Page 17/113 
  
  
specifications and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process. Batch results for batches used in clinical 
studies were provided and support consistency.  
Reference materials 
In-house reference standards are used for AS intermediate and AS manufacture. Characterisation of the 
previously and currently used standards is considered adequate. An appropriate qualification protocol for future 
reference standards was provided. WHO International Standard is used as a primary reference standard in 
potency assay to calibrate the biological activities of the new in-house primary reference standards. Specific 
activities of the current AS intermediate primary RS lot as well as AS primary RS lot have been stated.  
Satisfactory information has been provided on actual potency assignment.  
The strategy to establish new standards has been satisfactorily revised.  
Stability 
The applicant has defined a shelf-life and storage conditions for the AS in specified containers. 
The stability claim in line with ICH guidelines is based on real-time data obtained from a suitable number of 
validation batches produced at PharmaEssentia Corp. Materials used for stability studies were considered as 
representative of materials derived from the commercial process. 
All batches were stored in representative containers.  
Accelerated stability and forced degradation studies (thermal, acidic, oxidative, high pH, agitation and light 
exposure) were also conducted. 
The proposed stability protocol containing adequate stability-indicating test parameters is considered 
appropriate. The parameters chosen for stability monitoring are, in general, the same as those for release 
testing.  
Endotoxins and bioburden are monitored at the beginning and the end of the stability program. 
The long-term, real-time, real-condition stability studies show all results remain within the acceptance criteria.  
Accelerated stability and forced degradation studies show that the stability-indicating methods are qualified for 
the intended use.  
Based on the results from the photo stability study it is concluded that ropeginterferon alfa-2b active substance 
is susceptible to photo degradation. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance is sufficiently stable and justify the proposed shelf life in 
the specified container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Ropeginterferon alfa-2b is presented as a colourless to slightly yellowish sterile solution and is intended for 
subcutaneous administration. 
Assessment report  
EMA/11025/2019 
Page 18/113 
  
  
The finished product includes one multi-dose, disposable pen injector, containing one rubber capped glass 
cartridge containing ropeginterferon alfa-2b solution and two CE-marked safety needles for injection. The 
material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements.  
Two presentations (250 µg and 500 µg, based on protein content, not including the weight of the PEG molecule) 
are available. The compositions of 1 mL of finished product for 0.5 mg/mL and 1.0 mg/mL concentrations, 
respectively, include the ropeginterferon alfa-2b active ingredient and the excipients. The excipients include 
sodium chloride (tonicity agent), sodium acetate, anhydrous (buffer agent), acetic acid, glacial (buffer agent), 
benzyl alcohol (preservative), polysorbate 80 (stabiliser) and water for injections (vehicle). All excipients are 
well known and comply with the requirements and specifications of the relevant compendial monographs. There 
are no novel constituents used in this formulation. The finished product (FP) was developed for subcutaneous 
administration and its formulation remained unchanged since the start of product development and throughout 
the clinical trials. The final commercial process was used in phase III clinical trials. An injection pen was chosen 
for delivery to provide maximum flexibility for dose adjustment while maintaining a high level of dose accuracy, 
as compared to dose selection by withdrawing solution from a glass vial. The injection pen enables patients to 
self-administer doses of ropeginterferon alfa-2b at home in between physician / clinic appointments. The 
suitability of the pen injector has been demonstrated. 
The compatibility of the container closure system with the dosage form was assessed with respect to stability 
testing and extractable/leachable studies. The integrity of the container closure system was verified using the 
dye ingress test method. The injection pen is intended for multiple uses (twice a month) and benzyl alcohol is 
used as a preservative in the finished product formulation. The acceptance criteria for the benzyl alcohol 
concentration are sufficiently justified. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The FP is released by AOP Orphan Pharmaceuticals, Austria. The GMP status of all the FP manufacturing sites has 
been confirmed.  
The FP batch size has been specified. The FP manufacturing process starts with the compounding of excipient 
solution, followed by a bioburden reduction filtration. The filtered excipient solution is added to pooled active 
substance. The process continues through a sequence of operations in a grade A environment (sterile filtration, 
filling into the stoppered cartridges, sealing and capping) to obtain the filled cartridges. A 100% visual 
inspection is performed and the filled cartridges are stored at 2-8°C. After that, the pen elements are assembled 
with the filled cartridges and finally, labelling and packaging is performed. No reprocessing is claimed. 
Compounding steps, sterile filtration and filling as well as pen assembly were defined as critical steps. 
Comprehensive lists of process parameters and in process controls that can be expected to impact the FP CQAs 
are provided. The listed process parameters and in process controls are considered adequate to control the FP 
manufacturing process. 
The in-process controls performed on the critical steps of the manufacturing process are satisfactory. 
Process validation on a suitable number of batches has been conducted and demonstrates that the process is 
acceptably validated. The defined process conditions and parameters, homogeneity of the bulk and filling of 
minimum and maximum batch sizes as well as successful pen assembly have been confirmed. Hold times were 
microbiologically and physico-chemically verified. Filter flush volume for the sterilizing filter was also checked. 
Release data for all batches support the reproducibility of the manufacturing process.  
Assessment report  
EMA/11025/2019 
Page 19/113 
  
  
Product specification 
Several potential process-related impurities relevant at active substance level, are not considered relevant for 
finished product, since all of them are consistently removed by the purification process to acceptable levels and 
in finished product manufacturing, no further purification step takes place. Levels of product related impurities 
are controlled by various analytical methods at batch release.  
Assessment of elemental impurities was done as defined by ICH Q3D Guideline. Different lots of active 
substance were tested, demonstrating that levels of these elements are below the defined PDE limits in ICH Q3D 
Guideline. Equipment and container/closure components were also considered in the risk assessment.  
The specification includes appropriate testing of purity, identity, general tests, potency and protein content. The 
acceptance criteria of the FP release specifications generally correspond to the active substance specification. 
Justification with respect to clinical qualification/ tightening of some FP limits was requested during the 
procedure.  
Analytical methods 
Most of the analytical procedures for testing the finished product are in principle the same as those for the active 
substance (including for potency). The analytical procedures are sufficiently described and considered 
adequately validated.  
Batch analysis 
Batch results were provided for the process validation batches at commercial scale in cartridges (0.5 mg/ mL 
and 1 mg/ mL strength). The 0.5 mg/mL cartridges were further processed to pre-filled pens. The results on 
extractable volume are presented. All results comply with the defined acceptance criteria.  
Reference materials 
See active substance section. 
Container Closure System 
The primary packaging of the finished product for both presentations consists of a 3 mL, Type I, clear 
borosilicate glass cartridge which is closed with a grey bromobutyl rubber stopper and an aluminium crimping 
rubber septum cap. The cartridge and rubber components comply with the requirements of the Ph. Eur. The 
effectiveness of depyrogenation of the cartridges has been demonstrated.  
Medical device  
The pen injector for ropeginterferon alfa-2b pre-filled pen 250 µg and 500 µg (functional secondary packaging) 
is a “dial and push”, multi-dose, disposable needle-based injection system intended exclusively for use in 
combination with the integrated non-replaceable finished product cartridge. Depending on the individual 
patient’s dose, one pen may be used for up to two administrations, but has to be discarded at the latest 30 days 
after the first use. Dose settings visible in the display window of the pen start with 50 µg and can be increased 
in 50 µg steps. The pens for the two strengths of the finished product are identical except for the printing for 
dose setting and the push button colour. 
The pen injector corresponds to System Designation C of ISO 11608-1 (current version) "Needle-based injection 
systems for medical use – Requirements and test methods". Product verification and validation demonstrated 
conformance to ISO 11608-1. Biocompatibility was evaluated in accordance to EN ISO 10993-1. The applicant 
confirms that the essential requirements of the Medical Device Directive 93/42/EEC, Annex I have been met. 
Assessment report  
EMA/11025/2019 
Page 20/113 
  
  
The manufacturing process and quality control of the components and the subassembly of the components are 
described. Pen injector real-time and accelerated ageing has been studied.  
CE-marked injection safety pen needles are provided with the pen injector. 
The submitted information on the pen injector for ropeginterferon alfa-2b pre-filled pen 250 µg and 500 µg and 
the pen needles is considered sufficient.  
Stability of the product 
A shelf life of 3 years for ropeginterferon alfa-2b 0.5 mg/ml (250 micrograms/0.5 ml) strength and a shelf life of 
18 months for ropeginterferon alfa-2b 1.0 mg/ml (500 micrograms/0.5 ml) strength both at +2°C to +8°C, are 
proposed. Long term stability studies at real time/real temperature conditions as well as accelerated studies 
were initiated in line with ICH guidelines. All samples were stored in the original containers used for marketing. 
A suitable number of PV batches have been included in the stability program.  For the FP of both strengths stored 
at 2-8°C, real-time data are available as are accelerated data (25°C/60%RH). In accordance with EU GMP 
guidelines1, for ongoing studies, any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, will be 
reported to the Rapporteur and EMA. 
The applicant discusses the stability indicating test parameters and confirms that the test methods used for the 
stability studies are the same as used for release testing.  
The real-time data presented are within specification limits and prove the unimpaired product quality over the 
current stability testing periods.  
After first use, the pre-filled pen may be stored for a maximum of 30 days in the refrigerator (2°C - 8°C) when 
stored with the pen cap on and kept in the outer carton in order to protect from light. The pre-filled pen may be 
used up to two times within these 30 days. Any medicine remaining in the pre-filled pen after the second use 
and/or after 30 days must be discarded. In-use stability has been demonstrated.  
Photostability studies demonstrated that ropeginterferon alfa-2b finished product is susceptible to light in the 
glass cartridges whereas the pen injector is capable of protecting ropeginterferon alfa-2b against light exposure. 
A shelf life of 3 years for ropeginterferon alfa-2b 0.5 mg/ml (250 micrograms/0.5 ml) strength and a shelf life of 
18 months for ropeginterferon alfa-2b 1.0 mg/ml (500 micrograms/0.5 ml) strength both at +2°C to +8°C are 
accepted. 
Adventitious agents 
The applicant provided information on two materials of animal origin - IPTG used for induction of protein 
expression and stearate, which is used during manufacture of the cation exchange resin matrix. IPTG is 
manufactured using bovine milk from India; the stearate (from tallow origin) has been manufactured by 
rigorous processes in accordance with the requirements of the European guideline EMA/410/01 rev.3. The 
applicant’s risk assessment regarding the risk for TSE transmission for both materials is considered adequate.  
As the production cell substrate for ropeginterferon alfa-2b is E. coli, this represents a major barrier to the 
transmission of viral adventitious agents. Viruses do not infect or replicate in E. coli cells and only a virus-like 
component, bacteriophage, can infect and replicate there. The strategy for controlling the risk of bacteriophage 
contamination is inactivation of bacteriophage from the potential source. It is concluded that the risk

assessment on viral safety shows very low risk of transmission of viral adventitious agents. The risk is 
appropriately minimised with the control strategy. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
In the initial submission four major objections were identified, which were resolved during the procedure.  
The 40kDa PEG intermediate was proposed as a starting material by the applicant. However, as it is critical to 
the quality of the product, it has been re-classified by the applicant as an intermediate. All steps of its synthesis 
starting from the newly defined starting materials are performed under GMP. A revised QP declaration has been 
provided. 
A major objection was raised on the control strategy for the manufacturing process of the active substance that 
was not unambiguously defined and justified. The criticality assessment has been repeated and the control 
strategy has been revised. The applicant has re-evaluated CQAs, CPPs, and IPCs. Consequently more IPC items 
are now proposed for commercial production.  
IPC testing for commercial production is now clarified and considered satisfactory. The proposed shelf-life for the 
non-pegylated active substance intermediate has been based on the data submitted further to a major objection 
at D120 of the procedure.  
GMP issues raised as major objections have been resolved and respective certificates have been provided 
Besides the MOs, the other issues have also been resolved. Five recommendations are also given. Re-validation 
of some AS intermediate chromatographic release methods has been initiated, upon request. While re-validation 
has been finalised for some of these methods and updated documents have been provided, re-validation reports 
for other specified chromatographic methods (which may continue to be used for release of marketed product) 
should be submitted post-authorisation (see recommendations). 
During review, it was noted that difference exists between Besremi and the standard used, it is therefore 
recommended to re-evaluate the acceptance criteria for an AS intermediate test after revalidation with the new 
standards. 
For the AS manufacturing process, the routine IPCs are suitably described and found acceptable. However, an 
additional IPC during the early stages of purification is recommended to assure consistency: establishment of a 
numerical acceptance criterion for this IPC is recommended when data from a specified number of batches are 
available.  
It has been clarified that with the new in-house ELISA although data exist in order to set an AS specification for 
HCP, the applicant is recommended to re-evaluate the HCP acceptance criteria for the active substance and to 
tighten the specification once a specified number of commercial batches have been manufactured. 
The bioactivity of active substance is determined using a CPE-based bioassay (antiviral potency assay) that 
measures the ability of the protein sample to protect A549 epithelial lung carcinoma cells from cytotoxicity due 
to infection with the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). An alternative assay with improved sensitivity is 
currently under development. It is therefore recommended to introduce an alternative/replacement method for 
potency by variation application post-authorisation (see recommendations). 
In conclusion, information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished 
product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
Assessment report

Page 22/113

2.3.1.  Introduction 
The biological activity of ropeginterferon alfa-2b (P1101) was compared to that of peginterferon alfa-2a in 
Cynomolgus monkeys. PD/PK and toxicokinetic studies were performed in Cynomolgus monkeys; safety 
pharmacology studies comprised an in vitro hERG assay, a cardiovascular study in cynomolgus monkeys and 
central nervous system and respiration studies in rats.

A Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Study of P1101 versus Pegasys in Male Cynomologus 
Monkeys (Study Number 44101-08-242) 
Administration of ropeginterferon alfa-2b or Pegasys induced serum activities of 2’,5’-oligoadenylate synthetase 
(OAS) in a time-dependent manner (see Figure 3 and Figure 4). Both magnitude and kinetic of OAS response 
induced by ropeginterferon alfa-2b versus Pegasys are comparable till 144 hr postdose. After that time point, 
OAS activities in the animals receiving Pegasys were gradually subsided, while the OAS activities in the animals 
receiving ropeginterferon alfa-2b were relatively stable at a high level for about 14 days.

Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
Serum concentration of ropeginterferon alfa-2b is illustrated in  Figure 5 and Figure 6. Relative bioavailability of 
ropeginterferon alfa-2b was 42% for subcutaneous administration of 300 μg/kg in the phase-2 study versus 
80% for subcutaneous administration of 30 μg/kg in the phase-I study (see Table 2).

Safety pharmacology programme 
Effects of Ropeginterferon alfa-2b on Cloned hERG Potassium Channels Expressed in Human Embryonic Kidney 
Cells  
The objective of this study was to examine the in vitro effects of ropeginterferon alfa-2b on the hERG (human 
ether-à-go-go-related gene) channel current (hERG as a surrogate for IKr, the rapidly activating, delayed 
rectifier cardiac potassium current). Ropeginterferon alfa-2b at 2.5 μM (150 mg/mL; 2.5 µM is approximately 
the Cmax) was applied to four cells. An additional concentration (0.3 μM (actual 0.25 μM)(15 µg/mL)) was 
selected and applied to four cells also. Terfenadine (60 nM) was used as positive control.  
Ropeginterferon alfa-2b inhibited hERG potassium current by (mean ± SEM) 10.8 ± 0.6% at 0.25 μM (n = 4) 
and 49.9 ± 2.9% at 2.5 μM (n = 4) versus 0.4 ± 0.2% (n = 3) in control. The IC50 for the inhibitory effect of PEG 
INF alpha 2b on hERG potassium current was not determined since inhibition was < 50% and the 2.5 μM was

approximately the Cmax. The positive control (60 nM terfenadine) inhibited hERG potassium current by (Mean 
± SD; n = 2) 77.1 ± 0.1%. Table 3 
Table 3: The Effect of Ropeginterferon alfa-2b  on hERG Channel Current 
Table 3Table 3Table 3Table 3 
At concentrations of 2.5 µM (150 μg/mL), a statistically significant inhibition of the tail current amplitude of 
49.9% in relation to the normalised control current amplitude was observed. However, the concentrations of 2.5 
µM (150 μg/mL) were far in excess of plasma levels achieved clinically (Cmax = 24.84 ± 8.66ng/mL in study 
P1101-2010; PEGINVERA-PV Study).  
Effects on General Activity, Behaviour and Body Temperature in the Rat Following sc Administration   
Four groups of male Sprague Dawley rats comprising 6 animals each received a single administration of placebo 
or test article at doses of 0.2, 2.0 or 20 mg/kg by subcutaneous injection, using a constant dose volume of 4 
mL/kg. Irwin observations were performed at 1, 2, 4, 8, 24 and 48 hours post-dose. In addition, the rectal body 
temperature of each rat was measured pre-dose and immediately following each Irwin observation. The animals 
were kept for a further 7 days following the day of dosing for general observations. 
The formulation analysis of the three doses (0.2, 2.0 and 20 mg/kg) of ropeginterferon alfa-2b showed mean 
recoveries of 220, 114 and 98%. Subcutaneous administration of ropeginterferon alfa-2b at dose levels of 0.2, 
2.0 or 20 mg/kg produced no behavioural, physiological or body temperature changes in rats when compared to 
placebo-treated animals in this study. 
Effects on Respiratory Parameters in the Freely Moving Conscious Rat Using Whole Body Plethysmography   
Four groups of male Sprague Dawley rats comprising 6 animals each were acclimatised in plethysmograph 
boxes (1 rat per box) for one hour prior to dosing. The four groups of rats were administered once i.v. with 
vehicle or ropeginterferon alfa-2b at the doses of 0.1, 1.0 and 10 mg/kg, respectively and returned to the same 
plethysmograph boxes. The following respiratory parameters were recorded pre-dose and for 6-hour interval 
after dosing: tidal volume, minute volume and rate of respiration. 
Administration of the vehicle as well as the test article (ropeginterferon alfa-2b) at all doses elicited small 
increases in the tidal volume, rate and minute volume in the first 15 minutes after dose administration. This was 
observed across all groups and is related to the dosing procedure and the settling period in the plethysmograph 
environment. 
The formulation analysis of the three concentrations (0.1, 1.0 and 10 mg/kg) of ropeginterferon alfa-2b showed 
mean recoveries of 173, 116 and 95%. It is concluded that under the experimental conditions iv administration 
of PEG-Pro-IFN alpha-2b at 0.1, 1.0 and 10 mg/kg, did not elicit any statistically significant changes in 
respiratory parameters in the conscious rat during a 6-hour period, when compared to the vehicle treated group.

The objective of this study was to determine the cardiotoxicity of ropeginterferon alfa-2b in the conscious 
cynomolgus monkey following intravenous administration at a dose volume of 1 ml/kg. Six male non-naïve 
cynomolgus monkeys were pre-instrumented for single-lead telemetry recordings. Each subject received 
vehicle or test item administered i.v. using an adjusted Latin square design. The telemetric data recording 
indicated an increase in body temperature in 3 out of 4 animals following the high dose (600 μg/kg) 
administration. This increase was starting approximately 180 minutes post dose and lasting until approximately 
720 or 840 minutes post dose. In 1 out of 4 animals the body temperature was also increased following the low 
dose (60 μg/kg) administration. In addition, the heart rates were increased with corresponding QT shortening in 
the same animals and duration (180 minutes to 840 minutes post dose) at 600 μg/kg. In addition, QT intervals 
were as well shortened in 1 of 4 animals at the mid dose of 60 μg/kg. Furthermore, QTcf was reduced in 2 
following intravenous administration of the high dose of 600 μg/kg.  
It is concluded that the elevated heart rates with corresponding QT and QTc shortening as well as the elevated 
body temperatures are a result of the intravenous treatment with the test item ropeginterferon alfa-2b. 
The mean arterial blood pressure was only increased in 1 animal following the high dose (600 μg/kg). 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Non-clinical studies investigating pharmacodynamic drug interactions with ropeginterferon were not submitted. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Stand-alone evaluations of PK characteristics of ropeginterferon alfa-2b  were not performed. Pharmacokinetic 
characterization of ropeginterferon alfa-2b was performed as part of the combined 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) study in cynomolgus monkeys (Study No. 44104-08-242; see 
above). In addition, pharmaco-toxicokinetic evaluations were carried out as part of the GLP toxicity studies in 
cynomolgus monkeys (see toxicology). 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
No stand-alone single dose toxicity studies were performed. Single dose toxicity testing was performed as part 
of the non-GLP dose range finding study in rats (Study No. 7975-100). 
Repeat dose toxicity 
The program for ropeginterferon alfa-2b was designed taking into account the nature of the product and its 
intended route of administration. Dose range finding studies were performed in rats (see Table 4) and 
cynomolgus monkeys (see Table 5). The cynomolgus monkey was selected as a relevant species for the pivotal 
4-week repeated dose toxicity study. Two additional bridging toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys compared 
a toxicity lot of ropeginterferon alfa-2b with the clinical lots.

Single- and multiple-dose treatment of rats with ropeginterferon alfa-2b did not translate into any pathological 
or clinical symptoms. Treated rats had normal food consumption and did not show any relevant clinical signs 
related to treatment. In conclusion, the NOEL following a single or multiple subcutaneous injection of 
ropeginterferon alfa-2b into rats is at or greater than 20,000 μg/kg/dose (the highest tested dose).

Based on the treatment-related decreases in mean body weights (males) and reticulocyte counts at 2 and 6.75 
mg/kg/dose, the NOAEL for Ropeginterferon alfa-2b when given to male and female cynomolgus monkeys via 
s.c. injection once daily for four nonconsecutive days within a 2-week period is <2 mg/kg. A maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD) was not achieved in this study. 
The aim of this GLP study was to assess the toxicity, toxicokinetics and immunogenicity of ropeginterferon 
alfa-2b in cynomolgus monkeys treated twice weekly over a period of four weeks and to determine reversibility, 
persistence or delayed occurrence of any treatment-related effect after a 4-week recovery (see Table 6).

Toxicokinetics: The toxicokinetic parameters determined in serum are shown in Table 7 below.  
Following the first s.c. administration (Day 1), the systemic exposure was similar between male and female 
monkeys. The Cmax and AUC were increased in a linear manner proportionally to the administered dose. 
Decrease of PK parameters (Cmax, Tmax and AUC) was observed after Dosing Day 24, indicating the 
development of neutralizing antibodies. In line with this, serum concentrations of ropeginterferon alfa-2b 
started to decrease (with the exception of one male treated at 0.675 mg/kg/dose and one female that received 
6.75 mg/kg/dose) after the last injection (Day 24), further arguing for the development of neutralizing 
antibodies.

Table 7: Toxicokinetic data study 7975-101 
Administration of the maximum tested dose of ropeginterferon alfa-2b (6.75 mg/kg/dose) for four weeks did not 
affect organ weights and did not result in visible changes at necropsy. A decrease in red blood cell counts, 
hemoglobin, hematocrit, reticulocyte counts, and an increase APTT was observed. Clinical chemistry changes 
included decreased alkaline phosphatase, total protein, albumin, calcium, inorganic phosphorous, and 
ketonuria. Most of these treatment-related changes were observed in males and females treated with the 
highest dose of 6.75 mg/kg and were resolved by the end of the 29-day recovery period. The only 
treatment-associated microscopic changes were minimal to moderate infiltrates of lymphocytes and 
macrophages at the injection sites that either resolved or exhibited a reduction in average severity during the 
recovery phase. Based on non-adverse treatmentrelated effects in the food consumption, body weight loss and 
mild clinical observations, the NOAEL for ropeginterferon alfa-2b when given to male and female cynomolgus 
monkeys via s.c. injection once daily for 8 non-consecutive days within a 4-week period followed by a 4-week 
recovery period was defined at 6.75 mg/kg/dose. It is noted, that a decrease of PK parameters after the 8th 
dose (Day 24) of this study indicated the development of neutralizing antibody. Ropeginterferon alfa-2b 
concentration decrease in sera was found after the 5th dose indicating that the majority of the monkeys 
developed neutralizing antibodies by Day 17 on study. The presence of neutralizing antibodies might explain the 
higher NOAEL in this study compared to the non-GLP 2-week study. 
a)  14-Day Repeat-Dose Subcutaneous Toxicity Study with Toxicokinetics and 
Immunogenicity of P1101 in Cynomolgus Monkeys 
The aim of this GLP study (44103 -08-300) was to assess the toxicity and toxicokinetics of ropeginterferon 
alfa-2b (P1101) in cynomolgus monkeys that were treated at 6.75 mg/kg/dose sc twice weekly over a period of 
two weeks and to compare the GMP clinical lot with the lot used in the previous toxicity studies. 
No mortality or treatment-related clinical signs were observed; A slight reduction in bodyweight could be 
observed in all ropeginterferon alfa-2b monkeys, which correlated with reduced food consumption; Lower blood 
pressures (11% -23% lower for toxicity lot, 8% -27% lower for clinical lot) and slightly lower body temperatures 
in both males and females from both treatment groups were recorded, when compared to the control group. All 
electrocardiography parameters were within the normal limits. Decreased group mean white blood cell and 
neutrophil counts were observed and significantly increased group mean basophil levels also noted. In addition, 
treatment-related prolongation of APTT (21-45%) was noted in groups treated with ropeginterferon alfa-2b,

when compared to the control. ALT, AST, BUN and BUN/C values were increased in test item-treated groups, 
while levels of total protein, albumin, globulin and triglycerides were decreased. Necropsy of ropeginterferon 
alfa-2b -treated animals revealed decreased weights of the thymi, microscopically correlating with diffuse 
atrophies.  Animals had mononuclear perivascular immune infiltrates in the brain, while no such infiltrates were 
found in the control animals, suggesting a treatment related effect. Mixed cell inflammation in the lung was also 
identified only in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b administered animals.  
Immunogenicity: Repeated administration of toxicity and clinical lots of the test item elicited anti-drug antibody 
responses in most cynomolgus monkeys. However, drug-neutralizing antibodies were not detected using an 
un-validated cell-based assay. 
Toxicokinetics: Following subcutaneous administration to cynomolgus monkeys, the systemic exposure was 
generally similar between the groups receiving the toxicity lot and clinical lot. Accumulation of test item occurred 
with repeated doses until Day 13, when most of the animals showed a sharp decrease in ropeginterferon alfa-2b 
concentrations in serum (see Table 8). 
Table 8: Toxicokinetic data study 44103-08-300 
Twice-weekly repeated s.c. administration of ropeginterferon alfa-2b at 6.75 mg/kg/dose with toxicity lot or 
clinical lot to male and female cynomolgus monkeys over a period of two weeks resulted in lower mean body 
weights, reduce food consumption, lower blood pressure and body temperature. Treatment also resulted in 
changes in hematological and clinical pathology parameters, decreased thymus weight, and histopathological 
findings.  
There were no significant differences in treatment-related effects between the two lots of test article. 
b)  2-Week Subcutaneous Administration Toxicity, Toxicokinetics and Immunogenicity 
Bridging Study of Two Lots of P1101 in Cynomolgus Monkeys 
The aim of this GLP study (7975-107) was to compare and assess the toxicity, toxicokinetics and 
immunogenicity of ropeginterferon alfa-2b (P1101) in cynomolgus monkeys that were treated twice weekly at 0. 
675 mg/kg/dose, sc, over a period of two weeks with two different lots of ropeginterferon alfa-2b. 
No mortality or treatment-related clinical signs were observed. No treatment-related Electrocardiography 
effects were noted. Moderately reduced reticulocyte counts as well as slightly decreased red blood cell, 
hemoglobin and hematocrit values were noted. In addition, slightly reduced leukocyte, lymphocyte and 
eosinophil were noted in both males and females of both test item treated groups, while reduced neutrophils 
were observed only in ropeginterferon alfa-2b treated males. Changes in clinical chemistry parameters with

unclear association to the test item included slight decreases in levels of total protein, albumin, calcium and 
inorganic phosphorus could be observed on Day 14 when compared to the control group or pre-dose values.  
Immunogenicity: One Group 2 female developed anti-ropeginterferon alfa-2b antibodies after the fourth 
injection. All other animals were tested negative. 
Toxicokinetics: The systemic exposure to ropeginterferon alfa-2b was generally similar following s.c. 
administration of either of the tested lots. Accumulation of ropeginterferon alfa-2b occurred with repeated 
dosing (see Table 9). 
Table 9:  Toxicokinetic data study 7975-107 
Conclusion: Ropeginterferon alfa-2b-induced changes were observed with both tested lots. Slight differences 
in the effects of the two lots of ropeginterferon alfa-2b were observed but, however, these differences were not 
toxicologically relevant and meaningful. 
Table 10: Safety Margins between NOAEL in the Toxicity Studies and Maximum Human Dose  
In conclusion, in the four-week pivotal toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys treated s.c. on eight 
nonconsecutive days, the NOAEL was determined as 6.75 mg/kg. Exposure to the test item was not affected by 
the humoral immune response throughout the dosing phase and was similar between the males and females. 
Reduction in PK parameters such as Cmax and AUC was observed after the administration of the last dose and 
was mirrored by development of antidrug and neutralizing antibodies. The NOAELs of the both monkey studies 
(2 and 6.75 mg/kg, respectively) allows for an appropriate safety margin to the maximal applied human dose of 
540 μg, i.e. 7.7 μg/kg (based on a 70 kg body weight). (See Table 10).

Carcinogenicity 
In accordance with ICH S6 guideline no carcinogenicity studies were performed.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
Based on the general mechanism of action of IFN alpha, reproductive and developmental studies with 
ropeginterferon alfa-2b are not considered to add value to understanding of the safety and toxicity profile of 
ropeginterferon alfa-2b.

Local Tolerance  
The local tolerance evaluation included in the pivotal repeated dose toxicity studies were performed with 
formulation and route of administration intended for marketing, and thus a separate local tolerance study was 
not considered necessary. 
Local tolerance endpoints confirmed a good tolerability of the treatment with ropeginterferon alfa-2b. A few 
incidences of slight erythema were related to the dosing procedure, as they occurred also in the control group 
(Study No. 44103-08-300). Perivascular macrophage and lymphocyte infiltrates without any macroscopic 
correlates were noted at the injection site at the end of the dosing phase (Study No. 7975- 101). These 
inflammatory reactions either resolved or were resolving after four-week recovery period. 
Other toxicity studies 
Analysis of humoral immune response was performed as part of the GLP toxicity studies in cynomolgus 
monkeys. In a pivotal toxicity study, s.c. treatment with ropeginterferon alfa-2b at doses of 0.675, 2 and 6.75 
mg/kg consistently induced anti-drug and neutralizing antibodies by the end of the four-week treatment period, 
demonstrating immunogenicity of the test item. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No ERA studies are submitted, as ropeginterfereon alfa-2b is a protein molecule it is exempted from ERA 
assessment (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).   
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Interferons are used off-label for the treatment of polycythemia vera since the late 1980s. The applicant did not 
conduct any nonclinical proof-of-concept study and relies on the existing clinical data to support the use of 
Besremi (ropeginterferon alfa-2b) in the proposed indication, which was viewed as acceptable from a 
non-clinical perspective. It is acknowledged that the mechanism of action of ropeginterferon alfa-2b is currently 
not established; published data suggest that it may involve stimulation of the immune system, direct effect on 
mutant hematopoietic stem cells to promote their depletion from the stem cell pool, and/or abrogation the 
proliferative advantage of the mutant hematopoietic stem cells over the normal cells. 
PK and magnitude of biological activity of ropeginterferon alfa-2b was similar to that of peginterferon alfa-2a 
(Pegasys) in terms of inducing an antiviral effect in a study in Cynomolgus monkeys at up to 6 days following a 
single 30 µg/kg sc dose. From 6 to 14days post-dose, the biological activity of ropeginterferon alfa-2b remained 
stable whereas that of peginterferon alfa-2a subsided gradually. This sustained response of ropeginterferon 
alfa-2b vs. peginterferon alfa-2a was attributed to potential differences in the biological activities of the active 
moieties by Silva et al (Journal of hepatology, 2006) who compared the levels of interferon-induced gene 
transcripts in 36 patients treated with peginterferon alfa-2b and peginterferon alfa-2a. 
Safety pharmacology studies comprised an in vitro hERG assay, a cardiovascular study in cynomolgus monkeys 
and central nervous system and respiration studies in rats. Although the in vitro hERG assay revealed a signal 
for QT prolongation according to the Redfern et al. (2003) criteria (inhibition of hERG current by 49.9% with 2.5 
µM ropeginterferon alfa-2b), this value is lower than the actual IC50 concentration; at the dose of 450 µg in 
patients a safety margin based on the mean patient serum Cmax of about 1028-fold could be determined 
compared to the used 2.5 µM in the in vitro assay. Further, in a pivotal 4-week cynomolgus toxicity study the 
Assessment report  
EMA/11025/2019 
Page 35/113 
  
  
Cmax values of the animals exceeded the human Cmax values. Therefore, because of the high safety margin, a 
cardiovascular risk for humans is considered unlikely. 
Another study was conducted in rats to study the safety of ropeginterferon alfa-2b in the central nervous 
system. A single sc administration up to the dose of 20 mg/kg did not elicit any adverse effects on central 
nervous system or body temperature in rats. Similarly, single iv dose of ropeginterferon alfa-2b at 10 mg/kg to 
rats had no negative effects on respiration. In conclusion, there was no evidence for significant adverse effects 
on the central nervous, cardiovascular or respiratory system in the rat. In addition, no clinical signs indicating 
influence of the test item on central nervous or respiratory system were noted in the toxicity studies in 
cynomolgus monkeys treated s.c. up to the dose of 6.75 mg/kg. However, as a causal relationship between the 
use of interferons alfa and beta and the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension, a rare but severe 
event, cannot be excluded, a relevant warning is included in the SmPC (see section 4.4). 
The pharmacokinetics of ropeginterferon alfa-2b were not characterized in stand-alone studies, and it was relied 
on results obtained in a PD/PK and in toxicokinetic studies performed in Cynomolgus monkeys. In the PD/PK 
study, the absolute subcutaneous bioavailability could not be accurately determined due to the potential 
occurrence of anti-IFNα antibodies in animals dosed intravenously. Therefore, the bioavailability of 80% should 
be viewed as potentially overestimated due to an underestimated value for systemic exposure after intravenous 
administration. The half-life of ropeginterferon alfa-2b was in the 60-70 hours range, and the volumeof 
distribution values (37-55 mL/kg) indicate that its distribution is restricted to the intravascular space. 
In toxicity studies, the kinetics was shown to be linear over the 0.675-6.75 mg/kg dose range in Cynomolgus 
monkeys treated once subcutaneously with no significant apparent gender-related difference in systemic 
exposure. After twice weekly dosing for 2 weeks, Cmax and AUC0-72 levels were 1.4- to 2.9-fold and 2.1- to 
3.4-fold higher, respectively, than after the first dose. In the pivotal 4-week toxicity study using the same dosing 
frequency, systemic exposure levels measured after the last (eighth) dose were much lower than those 
measured after the first dose, in line with the demonstrated immunogenicity of ropeginterferon alfa-2b. 
No stand-alone distribution studies were conducted; reference is made to mass balance, tissue distribution and 
whole body autoradioluminography studies performed in rats with peginterferon alfa-2a (Pegasys) which is 
distributed to the liver, kidney and bone marrow in addition to being highly concentrated in the blood. In 
accordance with the ICH S6 (R1) guidance, studies investigating metabolism of ropeginterferon alfa-2b were not 
performed as degradation of proteins to short Peptides and amino acids is well understood.  
No stand-alone single dose toxicity studies were performed. The non-clinical toxicity studies conducted with 
ropeginterferon alfa-2b were limited due to species specificity of interferons. Acute and repeated dose toxicity 
studies have been carried out in rats and cynomolgus monkeys. It is known that there is no pharmacological 
activity of human interferon in mice and rats and since one study in rats confirmed this assumption, no further 
repeated dose toxicity studies were conducted in rodents. The duration of the pivotal toxicity study in 
Cynomolgus monkeys does not cover the chronic use of ropeginterferon alfa-2b in patients with the treatment 
length exceeding six months and application every two weeks because this study was limited to 4 weeks by the 
production of neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, the duration of this pivotal toxicity study is justified, as already 
agreed by CHMP scientific advice EMEA/H/SA/2272/1/2012/PA/III/ March 2012.   
The toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys, which used clinical route of administration (s.c.) and formulation 
intended for marketing, did not reveal any serious adverse effects after repeated treatment up to the dose of 
6.75 mg/kg. The major findings such as slight weight loss, decreased appetite, reduced red blood cell mass, 
reticulocytes and platelets, prolonged APTT, transient decrease in mean total protein, albumin and calcium 
levels in serum and ketonuria were all of mild non-adverse character and reversible after the four-week recovery

phase. Safety margin between NOAEL in the pivotal toxicity study (6.75 mg/kg) and the maximum human dose 
of 500 μg, i.e. 7.1 μg/kg assuming 70 kg body weight, was calculated to be 307.04. The peak concentrations in 
sera and exposure were vastly greater in cynomolgus monkeys than in patients, further pointing to a high safety 
margin of the NOAEL to the maximum applied dose of 540 μg/patient. 
Two bridging studies in cynomolgus monkeys showed that clinical lots manufactured with a new producer strain 
and manufacturing process were comparable in terms of induced effects. 
Ropeginterferon alfa-2b was negative in two in vitro genotoxicity assays. In accordance with guideline ICH S6 no 
carcinogenicity studies were performed.  
No reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were performed with ropeginterferon alfa-2b. According to 
the mechanism of action of IFNα effects of ropeginterferon alfa-2b on the reproductive system are expectable 
and are properly labelled in the SmPC. Women of childbearing potential are advised to use effective 
contraception during treatment (sections 4.6. and 5.3). Ropeginterferon alfa-2b is not indicated for the use in 
paediatric patients and thus studies in juvenile animals are not considered necessary. 
Analysis of humoral immune response was performed as part of the GLP toxicity studies in cynomolgus 
monkeys. In a pivotal toxicity study, s.c. treatment with ropeginterferon alfa-2b at doses of 0.675, 2 and 6.75 
mg/kg consistently induced anti-drug and neutralizing antibodies by the end of the four-week treatment period, 
demonstrating immunogenicity of the test item. 
The local tolerance evaluation included in the pivotal repeated dose toxicity studies were performed with 
formulation and route of administration intended for marketing, and thus a separate local tolerance study was 
not considered necessary. Local tolerance endpoints confirmed a good tolerability of the treatment with 
ropeginterferon alfa-2b. A few incidences of slight erythema were related to the dosing procedure, as they 
occurred also in the control group. Perivascular macrophage and lymphocyte infiltrates without any macroscopic 
correlates were noted at the injection site at the end of the dosing phase. These inflammatory reactions either 
resolved or were resolving after four-week recovery period.  
Ropeginterferon alfa-2b is a mono-PEGylated natural protein  and thus belongs to the group of compounds 
exempted from a Phase I and/or II ERA according to the CHMP Guideline on the environmental risk assessment 
of medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2).

The data submitted to address the non-clinical aspects of ropeginterferon alfa-2b are sufficient. All relevant 
information is reflected in the SmPC.

A comparative PK study against Pegasys has been performed to evaluate PK parameters of P1101. 
Study A09-102-P1101 
Design: single centre, double-blind, randomized, active control, single dose escalation study, with P1101 as the 
test drug and PEGASYS as the active control. The study included dose levels from 0.4 to 4.5 μg/kg (24 to 270 μg, 
total dose based on a 60 kg subject). These dose levels are comparable to those evaluated in the first clinical 
study with PEGASYS, an approved PEG-IFN product manufactured with a comparable molecular weight 
polyethylene glycol. 
Subjects: A total of 48 healthy male adult subjects aged 18 to 45 years. 
Table 12: Study Treatments (sc administration)  
. 
Randomisation: Subjects meeting all eligibility requirements were assigned a randomization number in 
consecutive order Subjects in the same cohort received the same dose of either P1101 or PEGASYS®, with the 
doses of P1101 ascending in subsequent cohorts.  Cohorts comprised 8 subjects where 6 subjects were 
randomized to receive P1101 and 2 subjects were randomized to receive PEGASYS®. The two sentinel subjects 
in Cohort 1 were randomized in a 1:1 ratio. The remainder of the subjects, dosed 72 hours later, were 
randomized in a 5:1 ratio in order to maintain an overall 6:2 (=3:1) ratio in Cohort 1.  
PK blood sampling: Serum samples collected within 1 hour pre-dose, and at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 72, 
96, 120, 144, 168, 192, 240, 288, 336, 504, and 672 hours post-dose. 
PD blood sampling: samples were collected within 1 hour pre-dose and at 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 168, 240, 336, 
504, and 672 hours post-dose.

Disposition of subjects: Two subjects were lost to follow-up: 1 subject, 001-405, receiving PEGASYS® (Day 
18), and 1 subject, 001-501, receiving 225 μg P1101 (Day 13); 1 subject, 001-205, randomized to receive 48 
μg withdrew consent (Day 27). All subjects who did not complete the study were dosed and were included in the 
safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic populations. 
Results: Linear and semi-log scale plots of the mean serum concentrations versus time for Cohorts 1 through 
6 and PEGASYS® are shown below in the figures below.

Mean serum concentration time curves were comparable across treatments. Serum compound concentrations 
reached a peak at approximately 3 to 5 days after dosing and declined gradually, with elimination half-lives of

Pharmacokinetic parameters are summarized in the Table 13 below: 
Table 13 Study A09-102-P1101 Summary of Mean (SD) PK Parameters by Treatment in HV 
The P1101 geometric mean values for Cmax, AUC, and AUC0-t showed an increase of 76%, 66%, and 82%, 
respectively over PEGASYS at the 180 μg dose. The geometric mean ratios for AUC and AUC0-t indicate no 
significant statistical differences (p-values of 0.2398 and 0.0687, respectively) at the 180 μg dose level. On the 
other hand, the Cmax geometric mean ratio is 1.76 (with an increase of 76% over PEGASYS), and this ratio is 
statistically significant (p-value of 0.0275) at 180 μg dose level. Tmax values were also compared between 
P1101 (combined and each dose level) and PEGASYS® using Wilcoxon Rank-Sum; however, Tmax values were 
not log-transformed. These results indicate that the time to maximum P1101 (Tmax) concentration was 
independent of dose (74.5-115.7 hours) and was similar to PEGASYS (84.3 hours). 
Distribution 
Plasma protein binding 
Interferons (alpha/beta [type I] and gamma [type II] interferons) are blood (glyco)proteins which belong to the 
protein class of cytokines that are produced by the immune system in response to various stimuli and act as 
Assessment report  
EMA/11025/2019 
Page 42/113 
  
  
 
short distance mediators which are usually present in plasma only during a short period of time. Interferon alpha 
exhibit their cellular effects by binding to the transmembrane receptor IFNAR which initiates a downstream 
signalling cascade through the activation of various effector proteins. The specific binding of interferon alpha to 
IFNAR would suggest that co-binding to another protein would preclude the ligand-receptor interaction. 
Therefore, interferon alpha is not considered to be bound and transported by other blood proteins. This is further 
supported by the attempts made to generate fusion proteins with recombinant HSA and recombinant interferon 
alfa to improve the half-life of interferon alfa (IntronA, recombinant interferon alfa, has a half-life of 2 – 3 hours 
in humans, in comparison, HSA, has a half-life of 19 days) (Osborn et al., 2002; Bain et al., 2006). Hence, 
plasma protein binding studies have not been performed with ropeginterferon alfa-2b 
Elimination 
Elimination studies have not been submitted. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies

Intra and inter- subject variability 
The pharmacokinetic parameter analysis from study A09-102-P1101 indicated that the inter-subject variability 
in Cmax, AUC, and AUC0-t for PEGASYS® (mean coefficient variations of 60%, 82%, and 77%, respectively) is 
higher than that of P1101 (mean coefficient variations of 35%, 25%, and 30%, respectively).

Mechanism of action 
No studies on mechanism of action have been performed. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The proposed biological activity of ropeginterferon alfa-2b in terms of primary pharmacodynamic effects was 
investigated in PV patients in 3 studies [2010-018768-18 (PEGINVERA), 2012-005259-18 (PROUD-PV), 
2012-005259-18 (CONTINUATION-PV)]. The primary pharmacodynamic effect was evaluated by a reduction in 
mutant JAK2 allelic burden, which is assumed to reflect a reduction of the malignant clone in the bone marrow 
causing the aberrant haematopoiesis in PV (see above ‘2.1 Problem statement – Pathophysiology’). 
The effects of ropeginterferon alfa-2b on JAK2 mutant allelic burden were variable and values fluctuated over 
the course of the studies. However, taken together the presented results show a sufficient reduction of JAK2 
mutant allelic burden by IFN alpha 2-b being acceptable as proof of concept. 
No relevant data regarding the proposed biological activity of ropeginterferon alfa-2b in terms of secondary 
pharmacology are presented by the applicant. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products have not been investigated. In their responses the 
applicant discussed that the shared structural similarities with pegIFN alfa-2b in respect of the PEG size and type 
of PEG linkage should provide evidence that the PD interactions of ropeginterferon alfa-2b and pegIFN alfa-2a 
are comparable. 
With regard to genetic differences the majority of PV patients display the same molecular aberration i.e. the 
JAK2V617F mutation (>95%) and hence similarity in PD response is expected. Infrequently, alternative targets 
in the JAK-STAT pathway are affected by somatic mutations in PV. However, JAK2V617F is considered as the 
genetic determinant for the diagnosis of PV according to the WHO 2008 criteria. 
Primary pharmacology data were obtained from the PEGINVERA study

Figure 10: Relative JAK2 allelic burden: boxplot of changes from baseline  
In study 2012-005259-18 (PROUD-PV) JAK2 allelic burden was measured at baseline and then every six months 
(i.e. at month 6 and month 12). Since the PROUD-PV study lasted 12 months, the amount of data regarding 
JAK2 allelic burden during the study is very limited. 
A statistically significant (p=0.0045) difference of JAK2 allelic burden was observed at week 26 of treatment 
(34.6% and 27.4% in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b or HU treatment arm, respectively). However, the difference 
was no longer statistically significant at EOT with 30.7% and 25.9% for ropeginterferon alfa-2b or HU treated 
patient. 
In study 2012-005259-18 (CONTINUATION-PV) open-label extension study to PROUD-PV study assessing the 
long-term efficacy and safety of ropeginterferon alfa-2b and best available treatment (BAT) in PV patients who 
previously participated in the PROUD-PV study; In ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm, the median absolute levels of 
JAK2 allelic burden ranged from 9.5% (Month 36) to 23.7% (Month 12). JAK2 allelic burden was measured at 
baseline and then every six months. The median differences from baseline (Month 0, baseline median 37.3%) 
Assessment report  
EMA/11025/2019 
Page 49/113 
  
  
 
ranged from -25.4% (Month 36) to -12.1 (Month 12). In BAT arm, the median absolute levels of JAK2 allelic 
burden ranged from 18.2% (Month 12) to 42.3% (Month 36). The median differences from baseline (Month 0, 
baseline median 38.1%) ranged from -18.7% (Month 12) to 0.3% (Month 36).  
Comparison of results across studies 
During AOP’s clinical development program, the stringent requirement for a complete molecular response (i.e. 
undetectable levels of JAK2 mutant alleles) was only met by a small number of patients, i.e. only seen in the 
long-term PEGINVERA Study. The less stringent requirement for a partial molecular response (i.e., a relative 
reduction by 50% of the JAK2 mutant alleles) varied widely, which translated into a highly variable number of 
partial molecular responders (i.e., 20-60%) over the course of the studies. In general, the observed decrease in 
JAK2 allelic burden compared to baseline, ranged between 10-30% in all studies. Sustained molecular response 
is expected as long-term treatment effect (treatment duration >18 months). 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the applicant provided minimal own PK data for ropeginterferon alfa-2b in this MAA dossier. It is 
acknowledged that PK evaluation for Besremi was performed in a rare orphan disease population and therefore 
limitations are obvious. Moreover, the necessity for dose-titrating has hindered the PK characterisation.  
The absorption of ropeginterferon alfa-2b is sustained in patients with peak serum concentrations reached after 
3 to 6 days. The absolute bioavailability of subcutaneous administered ropeginterferon alfa-2b was not 
investigated in humans. Thus, no valid estimation of the absolute bioavailability could be done. Based on data in 
monkeys, it is approx. 80%, similar to that seen for PEGylated interferon alfa-2a. 
Ropeginterferon alfa-2b is found mainly in the bloodstream and extracellular fluid as seen by the volume of 
distribution at steady-state (Vd) of 6.6 to 17 litres in patients after subcutaneous administration (dose range 50 
– 450 micrograms). Mean Cmax was 2.4 ng/ml (with a dose of 50 – 80 micrograms) to 49 ng/ml (with a dose of 
450 micrograms) and AUC0-t ranged from 28.5 ng.h/ml (with a dose of 50 – 80 micrograms) to 552.6 ng.h/ml 
(with a dose of 450 micrograms) in patients after subcutaneous multiple dose administration. Inter-subject 
variability was observed with 25-35% for AUC and Cmax, respectively, in healthy volunteers. 
Comparisons of ropeginterferon alfa-2b with marketed PEGylated and un-pegylated interferons are provided 
which allow further conclusions for Besremi.  
The elimination of ropeginterferon alfa-2b is not fully characterised. Studies with a similar interferon alfa 
medicinal product (pegylated interferon alfa-2a) indicated that the kidney is a major organ for excretion of 
radiolabelled metabolic products (study in rats) and that the systemic clearance of pegylated interferon alfa-2a 
in humans is about 100-fold lower compared to the native, un-pegylated interferon alfa-2a. 
After subcutaneous multiple dose administration (dose range 50 – 450 micrograms), the terminal half-life of 
ropeginterferon alfa-2b in patients is approximately 6 to 10 days and the clearance of ropeginterferon alfa-2b is 
0.023 to 0.061 L/h.  
The involvement of transport proteins in absorption, distribution and elimination of ropeginterferon alfa-2b is 
not known. 
Over a dose range of 24 to 270 micrograms, ropeginterferon alfa-2b Cmax increased proportionally with dose in 
a pharmacokinetic study with healthy subjects. A higher than proportional increase in exposure was observed. 
Inter-subject variability for ropeginterferon alfa-2b was 35% (Cmax) and 25% (AUC).

Comparable exposure and pharmacokinetic profile was reported for another interferon alfa medicinal product 
(pegylated interferon alfa-2a) in cirrhotic (Child-Pugh A) and non-cirrhotic patients. Pharmacokinetics were not 
evaluated in patients with increased severity of hepatic impairment. 
The pharmacokinetic profile in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment and in patients with end stage 
renal disease (ESRD) has been evaluated only for other pegylated interferon alfa medicinal products.  
Patients with moderate or severe renal impairment receiving 180 micrograms of pegylated interferon alfa-2a 
once weekly showed a comparable or 60% higher drug plasma exposure, respectively, compared to subjects 
with normal renal function.  
In 13 patients with ESRD requiring chronic haemodialysis, administration of 135 micrograms pegylated 
interferon alfa-2a once weekly resulted in a 34% lower drug exposure than in patients with normal renal 
function.  
Patients with renal impairment receiving a single dose of 1.0 micrograms/kg pegylated interferon alfa-2b 
showed an increased relation of Cmax, AUC, and half-life to the degree of renal impairment. Following multiple 
dosing of pegylated interferon alfa-2b (1.0 micrograms/kg subcutaneously administered every week for four 
weeks), the clearance of pegylated interferon alfa-2b was reduced by a mean of 17% and 44% in patients with 
moderate or severe renal impairment, respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. Based on 
single dose data, clearance was similar in patients with severe renal impairment not on haemodialysis and in 
patients who received haemodialysis. 
Only limited pharmacokinetic data are available from the use of ropeginterferon alfa-2b in the elderly. Based on 
the results from the PROUD-PV and CONTINUATION-PV Study on drug exposure, pharmacodynamic response 
and tolerability, a dose adjustment for ropeginterferon alfa-2b is not considered necessary in the elderly 
population. 
The pharmacokinetic profile of ropeginterferon alfa-2b has not been determined in obese and underweight 
patients.  
Primary pharmacology data regarding reduction in mutant JAK2 allelic burden are acceptable as proof of 
concept. JAK2V617F mutation is considered as the genetic determinant for the diagnosis of PV according to the 
WHO 2008 criteria, hence, with regard to genetic differences, for the majority of PV patients (>95%) similarity 
in PD response is expected. 
Enzymes of the protein catabolism are considered to be involved in the metabolism of ropeginterferon alfa-2b. 
The involvement of transport proteins in absorption, distribution and elimination of ropeginterferon alfa-2b is 
not known. Interferon alfa has shown to influence the activity of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes CYP1A2 and 
CYP2D6.  
Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products have not been investigated 
with ropeginterferon alfa-2b. The applicant discussed differences and similarities between the several 
un-pegylated and pegylated available interferons with regard to labelled dosing recommendations and other 
information for patients with hepatic and renal impairment - based on the shared structural similarities with 
pegIFN alfa-2b the applicant provided evidence that the PD interactions of ropegIFN alfa-2b and pegIFN alfa-2a 
should be comparable and relevant information was included in the SmPC (see section 4.5).  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies in humans with pegylated interferon alfa-2a indicated a moderate inhibitory 
effect on substrates metabolised by CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).  
Assessment report  
EMA/11025/2019 
Page 51/113 
  
  
Co-administration of pegylated interferon alfa-2a with telbivudine in patients with hepatitis B increased the risk 
of developing peripheral neuropathy. A combination therapy with telbivudine and ropeginterferon alfa-2b is 
contraindicated (see section 4.3).  
Administration of 180 micrograms of pegylated interferon alfa-2a once weekly for 4 weeks in healthy male 
subjects did not show any effect on mephenytoin, dapsone, debrisoquine and tolbutamide pharmacokinetics 
profiles, suggesting that pegylated interferon alfa-2a has no effect on in vivo metabolic activity of cytochrome 
P450 (CYP) 3A4, 2C9, 2C19 and 2D6 isozymes. In the same study, a 25% increase in the AUC of theophylline 
(CYP1A2 substrate) was observed, demonstrating that pegylated interferon alfa-2a is an inhibitor of CYP1A2 
activity. Co-administration of pegylated interferon alfa-2b showed no significant interaction with tolbutamide 
(CYP2C9 substrate), midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate), dapsone (N-acetyltransferase substrate) and modestly 
increased the exposure of caffeine (CYP1A2 substrate) and desipramine (CYP2D6 substrate). Therefore, care 
should be taken when ropeginterferon alfa-2b is co-administered with CYP1A2 substrates notably those having 
a narrow therapeutic margin such as theophylline or methadone. Likewise, caution is recommended with 
CYP2D6 substrates (e.g. vortioxetine, risperidone) combined with ropeginterferon alfa-2b. Ropeginterferon 
alfa-2b may inhibit the activity of CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 and thus may increase the blood concentrations of these 
medicinal products (see SmPC section 4.5).  
No dose adaptions for ropeginterferon alfa-2b should be necessary when concomitantly administered with 
medicinal products metabolised via CYP2C9/19, CYP3A4 or by N-acetyltransferase. Caution must be exercised 
when administering ropeginterferon alfa-2b in combination with other potentially myelosuppressive/ 
chemotherapeutic agents. Narcotics, hypnotics or sedatives must be administered with caution when used 
concomitantly with ropeginterferon alfa-2b. (see SmPC section 4.5). 
Similarly, as the applicant did not have own data on patients with renal or hepatic impairment (although renal 
and hepatic impairment were no special exclusion criteria), recommendations from the interferon 2a PI apply.In 
patients with compensated cirrhosis (i.e. Child-Pugh A), another pegylated interferon alfa medicinal product 
(pegylated interferon alfa-2a) has been shown to be safe. No ropeginterferon alfa-2b dose adjustment is 
required for adult patients with mild liver impairment. The use of interferon alfa has not been evaluated in 
patients with decompensated cirrhosis (i.e. Child-Pugh B or C) and is contraindicated in these patients (see 
section 4.3). Increased liver enzyme levels have been observed in patients treated with ropeginterferon alfa-2b. 
When the increase in liver enzyme levels is progressive and persistent, the dose should be reduced. If the 
increase in liver enzymes is progressive and clinically significant despite dose reduction, or if there is evidence 
of hepatic decompensation, therapy should be discontinued (see section 4.4). No dose adjustment for 
ropeginterferon alfa-2b is required for adult patients with mild (GFR 60-89 mL/min) or moderate (GFR 
30-59 mL/min) renal impairment. A reduced starting dose for ropeginterferon alfa-2b of 50 micrograms is 
recommended for patients with severe (GFR 15-29 mL/min) renal impairment. Ropeginterferon alfa-2b is 
contraindicated in patients with end stage renal disease (GFR <15 mL/min) (see section 4.3). 
Adjustments in the recommended dose for ropeginterferon alfa-2b are not necessary when starting therapy in 
elderly patients (see section 5.2). The pharmacokinetic profile of ropeginterferon alfa-2b has not been 
determined in obese and underweighted patients. No recommendation on dose adjustment for ropeginterferon 
alfa-2b can be given for these patients. The safety and efficacy of Besremi in children and adolescents have not 
been established. No data are available (see section 4.4). 
Furthermore, as no PK data are available with the 1 mg/ml strength, the applicant will provide full PK data with 
this strength within the ongoing CONTINUATION-PV study. It is planned to collect PK data from both the 500 
μg/ml then to 1 mg/ml strengths in order to give reassurance that change in the concentration of the 
ropeginterferon alfa-2b solution is unlikely to cause significant differences in PK properties after s.c 
Assessment report

administration in humans. The proposed PK blood sampling (the same as the one used in in the PEGINVERA 
Study) would be insufficient to fully characterise the whole PK profile of ropeginterferon alfa-2b, especially with 
regards to the terminal elimination half-life. Therefore, the applicant committed to extend the proposed PK 
sampling to reliably estimate the terminal elimination half-life of ropeginterferon alfa-2b, and to include 
additional intensive PK sampling to estimate the systemic exposure (AUCss, Cmax, Cmin) during the interval 
between two administrations. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
From a clinical pharmacology point of view the data submitted are sufficient.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
- 
The applicant will further evaluate PK the higher doses in PV patients. Furthermore, as no PK data are 
available with the 1 mg/ml strength, the applicant commits to provide full PK data with this strength 
(and the 0.5 mg/ml strength) to give reassurance that change in the concentration of the 
ropeginterferon alfa-2b solution is unlikely to cause significant differences in PK.   
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Dose finding in study PEGINVERA-PV 
Dose finding aspects were part of the PEGINVERA-PV trial which was an open-label, multicentre small-scale 
phase I study of 51 patients investigated ropeginterferon alfa-2b (named AOP2014 during the clinical 
development) in long-term treatments of PV (a 2-week regime followed by a 4-week regime).  
The study consisted of two stages, corresponding to the primary objective (establishing MTD in Stage 1; N=25) 
and secondary objectives (PK evaluation during longer treatment in Stage 2; N=51).  
In Stage 1, a MTD approach was used in a standard 3+3 dose escalation process and the MTD was defined as the 
highest dose at which there is at most one patient with a dose limiting toxicity out of 6 patients.  
25 evaluable patients entered the stage I dose finding part and the following dose levels have been explored: 50 
μg, 100 μg, 150 μg, 225 μg, 300 μg, 360 μg, 450 μg and 540 μg (one treatment cycle, i.e. 2 weeks). From the 
results the MTD was set to 540 μg, although no dose-limiting toxicity was observed at this dose.  
2.5.2.  Main study(ies) 
PROUD-PV 
This was an open-label, randomized, controlled, parallel-group, non-inferiority study comparing the efficacy and 
safety of ropeginterferon alfa-2b over hydroxyurea over 12 months.  
Methods 
Patients at EOT at 12 months who responded on treatment with ropeginterferon alfa-2b had the opportunity to 
continue treatment in the ongoing extension trial CONTINUATION-PV (supportive).

HU) or their excipients or pretreatment with pegylated products were also excluded from the trial. 
Treatments 
•  AOP2014 (ropeginterferon alfa-2b; Peg-P-IFN-α-2b), administered, s.c. at the starting dose of 100 µg 
(50 μg for HU-pretreated patients) every 2 weeks for up to 12 months of treatment, dose titration allows 
doses up to 500 µg (investigational [main] arm). 
•  HU, administered orally at the starting dose of 500 mg daily dose, titration allows doses up 3000mg to 
for up to 12 months of treatment (reference arm). 
Low dose aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) (100 mg/day) was given to patients in both groups, during the 12 months 
of study treatment, unless contraindicated. 
Both drugs (ropeginterferon alfa-2b and HU) were dosed individually, following their pre-specified dosing 
schemes (10 dose levels each arm) to achieve optimal disease response. The dose was gradually escalated 
Assessment report  
EMA/11025/2019 
Page 55/113 
  
  
depending on disease response and tolerability to the dose which delivered the optimal haematological disease 
response (Hct <45%, platelets <400 x 109/L and leukocytes <10 x 109/L). 
No interferon is approved in PV in the EU; therefore, the CHMP agreed to hydroxyurea (HU) as comparator HU 
is the most commonly used cytoreductive agent approved in the EU in the target population and recommended 
as standard first line treatment since decades in scientific treatment guidelines. 
Treatment Duration: The main study period was expected to be about 13 months per patient, but long-term 
follow up treatment for ropeginterferon alfa-2b allocated patients was further investigated in the 
CONTINUATION-PV trial. (After roll-over in the CONTINUATION-PV trial treatment is planned to be continued as 
long as it is effective and tolerable/safe). 
Objectives 
Primary objective: To demonstrate non-inferiority of ropeginterferon alfa-2b vs. HU in terms of disease response 
rate in both HU naïve and currently treated patients, diagnosed with Polycythemia Vera. 
Secondary objective: Efficacy in the two treatment arms, safety, QoL and change of JAK2 allelic burden were 
analysed, using the secondary endpoints outlined, to provide a more comprehensive picture on ropeginterferon 
alfa-2b compared to HU in patients with PV. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint: Disease response rate at 12 months  
Composite endpoint (complete haematological response + normal spleen size) was defined as the rate of 
patients with a complete haematological response (haematocrit < 45% without phlebotomy [at least 3 months 
since last phlebotomy], platelets < 400 x 109/L and leukocytes < 10 x 109/L) and a spleen normality 
(longitudinal spleen length ≤12 cm for females and ≤13 cm for males).  
Key secondary endpoint (post-hoc declared as primary endpoint): Disease response rate at 12 months 
(=complete haematological response only, without normal spleen size). The endpoint 'complete haematological 
response at Month 12 (excluding spleen normalization)' was not pre-specified in the protocol as primary 
endpoint. The NI margin (-20%) for this endpoint was not specified in the protocol such that the NI analysis is 
not considered confirmatory from a methodological, but nevertheless may be considered relevant from a clinical 
point of view. This endpoint analysis (NI) was defined after data lock date.  
Primary endpoint for FDA and Key secondary efficacy endpoints pre-defined:  
Durable disease response rate as per the following definition of durable responder: 
•  A responder at 12 months, i.e., the following criteria were met: Hct <45% without phlebotomy between 
month 9 visit to month 12 visit, platelets <400 x 109/L, leukocytes <10 x 109/L, normal spleen size), and  
•  A responder at 9 months, as measured by blood parameters, i.e. the following criteria were met: Hct <45% 
without phlebotomy in the past three months (i.e. visits at 6-9 months according to study schedule), 
platelets <400 x 109/L, leukocytes <10 x 109/L. 
For all parameters mentioned above, central lab blinded assessments and assessment of spleen size at month 
12 according to blinded central imaging was used for determination of durable responders.  
Assessment report  
EMA/11025/2019 
Page 56/113 
  
  
Other pre-specified secondary endpoints were: Disease response rates at 3 months and 9 months (spleen size 
measurements and haematological parameters coming from local measurements), time to first disease 
response, disease response duration, number of phlebotomies performed (per protocol, a phlebotomy was 
performed any time the patient’s Hct was higher than 45%). Hct-, leukocytes-, platelet- and spleen size-change 
from baseline to last patient visit, disease-related symptoms (microvascular disturbances, pruritus, headache). 
From the additional efficacy endpoints molecular response as measured with change of JAK2 allelic burden over 
time and Quality of Life (EQ-5D) are most important since only during interferon therapy long-term remissions 
regarding complete molecular response (CMR) is described in the literature.  
Sample size 
Based on expert judgment, the anticipated size of treatment effect in an overall rate of responders at 12 months 
was considered to be 25% at least. The assumed rate of responders was 15% in patients treated with HU 
(reference group) and 40% in patients treated with ropeginterferon alfa-2b (tested group). Supposed drop-out 
was 20%. The dropped-out patients were considered as non-responders according the definition of the primary 
endpoint which would decrease assumed rate of responders to 12% (reference group) and 32% (tested group). 
Based on these assumptions 126 patients per group (252 in total) would be needed in order to detect the 
difference in response rate between treatment groups at 1% (two-sided) significance level with 90% power 
using standard chi-square test. Taking into account divisibility by 8 (in order to enable equal proportion of all 
strata subgroups) 128 patients per treatment group (256 in total) were planned to be enrolled. 
It is recognized that this was a single pivotal trial. In accordance with EMEA /CHMP/EWP/2330/99 guidance 
which specifies that “Statistical evidence considerably stronger than p<0.05 is usually required, accompanied by 
precise estimates of treatment effects, i.e. narrow confidence intervals” (CI). The level of significance was set to 
<5%. For the primary endpoint, 95% and 99% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. 
According to the DMC statement (review of 6-month data) no sample size re-assessment was needed and 
therefore not performed. 
Randomisation 
Treatments were assigned to individual patients based on stratified randomization in order to ensure random 
assignment to treatments and balanced distribution of both treatments within each stratum. The proportion of 
patients enrolled in each individual stratum was not pre-defined by the protocol. The following stratification 
factors were defined: [1] previous HU exposure (yes/no), [2] age at screening (≤60 or >60 years) and [3] 
presence of thromboembolic events in the past (yes/no). Based on these factors 8 stratification groups were 
established. Block randomization was used. A randomization list was generated by the responsible study 
statistician using SAS version 9.3 or higher. 
Blinding (masking) 
This study was open-label.  
Statistical methods 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) including all randomized patients according to the treatment to which they were 
randomized, but excluding patients without intake of study medication and patients not providing baseline data, 
was the primary set used for efficacy analyses. The Per Protocol Set (PPS) was used for efficacy sensitivity

Page 57/113 
  
  
analysis. It consisted of patients included in the FAS who completed a certain pre-specified minimal exposure to 
the treatment regimen, had all measurements needed for assessment of the primary endpoint available and did 
not violate the study protocol in major concerns. 
The study was initially designed as a superiority trial, but switched to a non-inferiority trial after completion of 
the study (after last patient out, prior database lock).  
The primary analysis was conducted using a weighted Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel framework for estimation with 
stratification factors corresponding to those used in the randomization scheme. Corresponding disease response 
rate difference at 12 months between the two treatment arms (test/reference) and its 95% and 99% CIs were 
calculated. Non-inferiority was concluded if the lower limit of the 95% two-sided CI of the Mantel-Haenszel 
common estimate of response rate difference exceeded -0.105 for both the Full Analysis Set (FAS) and the Per 
Protocol Analysis Set (PPS). All results need to be interpreted in an exploratory sense. 
The disease response is a binary (Yes/No) variable defined by four (response) components. Only if all of these 
four response criteria were met the patient was classified as "responder" (treatment success). Patients 
withdrawn, for any reason, were classified as treatment failures. A last observation carried forward analysis 
(LOCF) was provided as sensitivity analysis. 
Secondary efficacy analyses were performed for exploratory purposes using descriptive analysis and standard 
statistical tests. Primary and secondary efficacy endpoint analysis was also done for the individual strata. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total number of 257 patients was enrolled (127 in the ropeginterferon alfa-2barm, 130 in the HU arm) 
according the sample size calculation. Sample size re-assessment allowed enrolment for a maximum of 368 
patients. Two hundred fifty-four (254) patients received at least one dose and were included in the safety 
analysis set, and included in the Full Analysis Set (FAS).  
Of these, 229 patients (90.2 %) were eligible for Per Protocol Set (PPS).

The mean age at inclusion was 58.2 years (SD: 11.99) with a median of 60 years (range 21 to 85 years). 
•  119/254 (46.9%) were male and 135/254 (53.1%) patients were female. 
•  100 % of patients were White, 3/254 (1.2%) had ethnicity Hispanic or Latino. 
• 
The median duration of PV was 1.9 months (range 0-146 months) in the ropeginterferon alfa-2btreatment 
arm and 3.6 months (range 0-126 months) in the HU treatment arm indicating that patients were diagnosed 
in an early stage of the disease. Out of 94 HU pre-treated patients, 82 (32.3 %) had records of HU-treatment 
at study entry, with a median duration of 8.7 months. 
•  At baseline, the haematological parameters were comparable between the two treatment arms with a mean 
Hct around 45.5%. 
•  At baseline, spleen size was comparable between the two treatment arms with a median length of around 
13cm, close to normal size. Only 9.4% [12/127] (ropeginterferon alfa-2b) and 11.8% [15/127] (HU) of 
patients had a spleen size >17cm. 
•  At baseline, 98.8% [251/254] of the patients were JAK2 V617F positive, with a median JAK2 allelic burden 
of 37.4% (comparable between the two treatment arms; 37.3% and 37.4%). 
Recruitment 
The study was conducted between 04 October 2013 and 08. April 2016 in 13 countries (including Austria, 
Bulgaria, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Spain, and 
Ukraine) within and outside the European Union. Planned number of centers was 45 to 60; in total 56 sites were 
activated. Planned: 250 patients; Enrolled: 257 patients; Analysed: 254 patients. 
Study initiation date: 04-October-2013 
Study completion date: 08-April 2016 
Data lock point: 22-August 2016 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol deviations were rare and occurred in11 patients (5 in the ropeginterferon alfa-2barm, and 6 in the HU 
arm) and led to exclusion from PPS in 9 patients (4 in ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm and 5 in HU arm).

Protocol Amendments: 
There were three amendments to the protocol of PROUD-PV: 
Amendment 1: 20 February 2014. Following the discussions with the US FDA, the secondary endpoint "Durable 
disease response" was added. The amended study protocol states that the endpoint "Durable disease response" 
was to be analysed as the primary one for study submission in the US; however, for study submission in Europe 
the primary endpoint "disease response at 12 months" remained unchanged. In order to avoid confusion, a 
separate US Specific SAP was written for submission in the US. All endpoints as per study protocol were included 
in both SAPs (for the European and for the US submission). The statistical methods and sample size justification 
Amendment 2: 17 July 2014. Clarification on patients who will have an immunogenicity sample drawn on WK4 
and who have already started the study at the time this was implemented. 
Amendment 3: 15 June 2016. The primary objective was changed from “To demonstrate superiority of 
ropeginterferon alfa-2b vs. HU in terms of disease response rate in both HU naïve and currently treated patients, 
diagnosed with Polycythemia Vera.” to “To demonstrate non-inferiority of ropeginterferon alfa-2b vs. HU in 
terms of disease response rate in both HU naïve and currently treated patients, diagnosed with Polycythemia 
Vera.” 
Protocol Deviations 
A total of 14 major protocol deviations occurred in 11 patients (5 in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm, and 6 in the 
HU arm) and out of those, 11 led to exclusion from PPS in 9 patients (4 in ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm and 5 in 
HU arm). Major protocol deviations leading to exclusion from PPS were: 6 major deviations due to violation of 
eligibility criteria (history of malignant disease [in 2 patients], positive TPOAb [in 2 patients], positive HADS 
without psychiatric assessment [in 1 patients] and a low Hb value [in one patient]) and 5 major protocol 
deviations due to major efficacy deviations [in 3 patients] (such as a dose reduction or interruption following an 
AE not related to the study drug [in 4 patients] or due to missed visits [in 1 patients]), led to exclusion from PPS. 
Furthermore 3 major safety deviations not leading to the exclusion from PPS were observed in two patients (1 
in each treatment arm): included two cases of continuation of the study drug despite a Grade 3 Adverse event 
(in 1 patient) and an accidental overdose of the ropeginterferon alfa-2b study drug (in 1 patient). 
Baseline data 
Two hundred fifty-four (254) patients received at least one dose and were included in the safety analysis set, 
and included in the Full Analysis Set (FAS).  
Of these, 229 patients (90.2 %) were eligible for Per Protocol Set (PPS). 
Demographics: In the PROUD-PV trial relevant demographic baseline characteristics (mean age: 58.2 y; range 
21 -81y) were balanced between both arms. Females were slightly more included (F:53.1% (M:46.9%). Disease 
specific factors also were balanced regarding median duration of PV, HU pre-treatment, baseline haematological 
parameters, spleen size and median JAK2 allelic burden (at baseline). At least one previous well documented 
major cardiovascular PV-related event, except bleeding and PV-related thromboembolic complications in the 
abdominal area in the medical history was an inclusion criteria; however, cardiovascular risk factors were not 
systematically reported or used for stratification.

The disease response at 12 months of treatment was 21.3% for ropeginterferon alfa-2b and 27.6% for HU 
(FAS), with a difference in responder rates of -6.6 (95% CI: -17.2 to 4.1; p=0.2233), and 22.6% for 
ropeginterferon alfa-2b and 29.0% for HU (PPS), with a difference in responder rates of -6.3 (95% CI: -17.5 – 
5.0; p=0.2353).  
A total of 9/217 (FAS) patients had no data for disease response criteria at end of  month 12 treatment (EOT) 
visit available. Four patients in each treatment group had no data for disease response criteria available but 
other criteria for disease response were fulfilled. For one patient in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b treatment arm, 
no data for disease response evaluation was available. 
Comparison of treatment arms showed that ropeginterferon alfa-2b had 0.69 to 0.75 times lower probability of 
response, but the results were not statistically significant in either of the statistical models (p ranged from 
0.2302 to 0.3909). 
Comparison between HU pre-treated and HU naïve patients was statistically significant in all four models 
(p<0.05) and showed that HU pre-treated patients had a 0.47 to 0.49 times lower probability of response then 
HU naïve patients, irrespective of treatment. A comparable effect was seen in the two treatment groups, as 
trend (0.41 to 0.43 probability of response) within the HU treatment group (p ranged from 0.0534 to 0.0657) 
and non-significant (0.55 to 0.57 probability of response) within the ropeginterferon alfa-2b treatment group (p 
ranged from 0.2222 to 0.2441). 
When adjusted for stratification factors and sex, females were 2.36 times more likely to respond to the 
treatment (p = 0.0069) and the probability of response was slightly increased in the age group > 60 years (1.15 
to 1.18), not showing a significant effect (p ranged from 0.5750 to 0.6484).

The disease response at 12 months of treatment was 43.1% for ropeginterferon alfa-2b and 45.6% for HU 
(FAS), with a difference in responder rates of -3.0 (95% CI: -15.6 to 9.5; p=0.0028), and 44.3% (50/113) for 
ropeginterferon alfa-2b and 46.0% for HU (PPS), with a difference in responder rates of -2.6 (95% CI: -15.8 to 
10.5; p=0.0036). The results did show non-inferiority of ropeginterferon alfa-2b to HU at month 12 in both 
analysis sets (non-inferiority margin of -20.0%; p<0.01). 
Disease response rates over time (i.e. the evaluation of the complete haematological response [haematological 
parameters measured by central blinded lab] without the disease criterion spleen size at the respective 
assessment visits from week 12 until week 52) are summarized in

The difference in the response rate, which was most evident at week 26 and decreased with ongoing treatment 
duration. Ropeginterferon alfa-2b required a longer time to reach the maximal dose plateau (end of titration 
phase) which may explain the timely delay in disease response. 
The following table shows the change in disease response rates (excluding spleen normality) during the 
PROUD-PV trial:

in spleen size (change from baseline) was comparable between the treatment arms and ranged from -0.2 cm to 
-1.4 cm for ropeginterferon alfa-2b and -0.7 cm to -1.9 cm for HU treatment. The absolute increase in spleen 
size (change from baseline) was also similar for ropeginterferon alfa-2b and HU treatment, with +1.3 cm and 
+1.0 cm, respectively (Table 25).

Analysis description 
Clinical studies in special populations 
Information regarding efficacy in special populations were initially not reported. However, the applicant has 
provided a separate analysis regarding gender and several relevant age cohorts which did not demonstrate 
relevant differences. Limitations of this approach in the small orphan disease population have to be noted. 
However, the large clinical experience also in special populations with other interferons is considered reassuring.  
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses AND meta-analysis) 
Analysis across the trial regarding differences in efficacy outcome between the four AOP efficacy studies 
(PEGINVERA; PROUD, CONTINUATION and PEN-PV) shows that the response rate for the haematological 
parameters Hct, PLT and leukocytes (complete haematological responders) ranged between 43% and 75% in 
the clinical studies in line with that reported for other IFNs-α in literature.  
The following “haematological” criteria have been relatively constant throughout the development of 
ropeginterferon alfa-2b; comparison was based on: Hct < 45% (without phlebotomy in the previous two (or 
three) months); Platelet (PLT) count ≤ 400 * 109/L and Leukocyte count ≤ 10 * 109/L

In the four AOP efficacy studies, the response rate for the haematological parameters Hct, PLT and leukocytes 
(complete haematological responders) ranged between 43% and 75%, derived from the AOP study data: 
- 
PROUD-PV Study: 43% after 12 months treatment, 
-  CONTINUATION-PV Study: 70.5% at treatment month 24 and month 36 (i.e. after 12 and 24 months 
treatment in the extension study) 
PEN-PV Study: 75% at treatment month 18.8 (range 14.9 to 24.5), after 3 months treatment within the 
respective study 
PEGINVERA-PV Study: the percentage of complete haematological responders was not evaluated in the 
- 
- 
study. 
Normal spleen size was defined as a longitudinal diameter ≤ 12 cm for females and ≤ 13 cm for males. The 
spleen size ranges observed per AOP study were the following: 
- 
PROUD-PV Study: 13.1-13.4 cm (mean absolute sizes) 
-  CONTINUATION-PV Study: 12.4-12.6 cm (median absolute sizes at treatment month 36) 
- 
- 
PEN-PV Study: 13.4-13.5 cm (mean absolute sizes) 
PEGINVERA Study: 12.4-14.0 cm (median absolute sizes) 
When the spleen size was included as a criteria, the studies evaluating the disease response (defined as 
complete haematological response with spleen size normality), reported the following percentages of complete 
responders: 
- 
PROUD-PV Study: 21% after 12 months treatment 
-  CONTINUATION-PV Study: 37.4% at treatment month 24 and 42.2 at treatment month 36 (i.e. after 12 
and 24 months treatment in the extension study) 
PEN-PV: 48% at treatment month 18.8 (range 14.9 to 24.5), after 3 months treatment within the 
respective study 
PEGINVERA-PV Study: 48% after (median) 30.5 months treatment

Supportive study:  CONTINUATION-PV [2012-005259-18] 
CONTINUATION-PV trial is an open-label, multicenter, phase IIIb study assessing the long-term efficacy and 
safety of ropeginterferon alfa-2b in patients with Polycythemia Vera who previously participated in the 
PROUD-PV Study. It was planned as a follow on study designed to provide long-term evaluation of 
ropeginterferon alfa-2b in patients with PV who received the investigational medicinal product (IMP) 
subcutaneously during the PROUD-PV Study. The integration of the subjects who participated in the PEN-PV 
Study was also to contribute to this long-term evaluation of the investigational product as well as an alternative 
mode of administration (pen). Additionally, data from the routine care treatment of patients, who participated in 
the PROUD-PV Study and were allocated to the HU arm, were to be collected and analysed in the same way as 
the ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm in this study to enable long term observation of ropeginterferon alfa-2b 
treatment compared to the real life treatment information. However, the HU/BAT arm was started later following 
an amendment to the initial study protocol.

Objectives: 
Primary: 
• To assess the long-term efficacy of ropeginterferon alfa-2b or standard first line treatment (HU or other best 
available treatmtent [BAT) in terms of disease response rate in patients diagnosed with PV, who were previously 
treated in the PROUD-PV Study and who completed this study. 
• To assess the long-term efficacy including changes in disease burden in patients diagnosed with PV. Disease 
burden is defined as disease-related signs (clinically significant splenomegaly) and disease-related symptoms 
(microvascular disturbances, pruritus, headache), assessed by investigator. 
Secondary: 
• To further assess the long-term efficacy, safety, quality of life (QoL), ease of self-administration of 
ropeginterferon alfa-2b and change of JAK2 allelic burden in patients diagnosed with PV and previously treated 
with ropeginterferon alfa-2b or HU in the PROUD-PV Study 
Study design/Methodology: 
This was a Phase IIIb, open-label continuation of the PROUD-PV Study performed in adults diagnosed with PV. 
No confirmatory statements or hypotheses were formulated. 
Patients who received ropeginterferon alfa-2b or HU in the primary study, PROUD-PV, and completed the end of 
study visit per protocol, were to be included in this CONTINUATION-PV Study.  
Enrolment occurred after eligible patients had signed the informed consent form (ICF). The first day of the 
CONTINUATION-PV Study coincided with the end of study visit of the primary study, PROUD-PV or the last visit 
in the PEN-PV Study. Patients who participated in the PEN-PV Study (estimated patient participation was 
approximately 12 weeks), were allowed to continue their treatment using the pen in the CONTINUATION PV 
Study. 
Subjects were to continue to receive the individualized dosage delivering the optimal disease response 
(haematocrit [Hct] <45%, platelets [PLTs] <400 x 109/L and leukocytes [WBCs] <10 x 109/L), as determined in 
the PROUD-PV or PEN-PV Study, preferably at the level of target blood values.  
Treatment was to continue with a periodicity of two weeks, but patients could also be switched to a three or four 
week administration schedule after PEN-PV Study completion (last subject out) and based on eligibility criteria. 
Patient visits were to be scheduled every two, three or four weeks. 
Target blood values adopted to avoid fluctuations in response assessment due to the variability of laboratory 
measurements were as follows: 
• PLTs and WBCs (approximately 20% - 25% below the upper limit of normal [ULN)]: 
o ULN for PLTs: 400 x 109/L, i.e. target PLTs approximately 300 x 109/L. 
o ULN for WBCs 10 x 109/L, i.e. target value for WBCs 8 x 109/L. 
• Hct level of 40 - 42% without phlebotomies. 
Dose adjustment rules, defined in the PROUD-PV and PEN-PV Study, were also to be applied in this continuation 
protocol. The number of dose decrease and reescalation attempts was not to be limited in this study, since 
treatment may continue for several years. However, maintaining response or re-gain of response after its loss 
due to toxicity dose decrease was to be desirable to improve long-term treatment outcomes. Decision on 
Assessment report

continuation for each individual patient was to be made by the Investigator upon consideration of benefits and 
risks. 
Disease response assessments were to be made every three months (independently from the administration 
schedule) by the Investigator to allow continuous data assessment. 
A safety follow-up visit was to be planned 28 days after the last IMP administration, including premature 
discontinuation. Immunogenicity samples were to be drawn at 3 and 6 months following the last ropeginterferon 
alfa-2b administration. 
Also, genetic samples post study (e.g. year 2 and year 3) may be collected to assess disease status following 
discontinuation of ropeginterferon alfa-2b treatment. 
Treatment can be continued as long as it is effective and safe and until ropeginterferon alfa-2b becomes 
otherwise available. 
Safety and efficacy data is planned to be periodically analysed in a descriptive manner. 
Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion: 
A patient who met all of the following criteria qualified for entry into the study: 
Patients having completed the 12 months PROUD-PV Study and who fulfilled at least one of the following 
criteria: 
a)  Normalization of at least two out of three main blood parameters (Hct, PLTs and WBCs) if these 
parameters were moderately increased (Hct<50%, WBC<20 x 109/L, PLTs<600 x 109/L) at baseline 
of the PROUD-PV Study, OR 
b)  >35% decrease of at least two out of three main blood parameters (Hct, PLTs and WBCs) if these 
parameters were massively increased (Hct>50%, WBCs>20 x 109/L, PLTs>600 x 109/L), at baseline 
of the PROUD-PV Study, OR 
c)  Normalization of spleen size, if spleen was enlarged at baseline of the PROUD-PV Study, OR  
d)  Otherwise a clear, medically verified benefit from treatment with ropeginterferon alfa-2b (e.g. 
normalization of disease-related micro-vasculatory symptoms, substantial decrease of JAK2 allelic 
burden). 
Treatments  
The following products were administered to patients during the trial: 
IMP:  AOP2014 (ropeginterferon alfa-2b, Pegylated Proline-IFN alpha-2b); Dosage and regimen: Dosing 
scheme achieving optimal disease response in the individual patients, as determined in the primary study, 
PROUD-PV or the PEN-PV Study- administered every two, three or four weeks until the end of the study (sc)  
Comparator: The BAT arm received standard first line treatment for treatment of PV disease, as per 
investigator’s discretion.  
Low dose aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) (100 mg/day) was to be given to all patients (ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm) 
for the duration of study treatment, unless contraindicated.  
Study participation was planned to be as long as the treatment was effective and tolerable/safe and until 
ropeginterferon alfa-2b becomes otherwise available.

10. Change in JAK2 allelic burden and other molecular and genetic abnormalities from baseline over time up to 
last patient visit. 
Additional secondary efficacy endpoints defined in Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) in order to be consistent with 
endpoints defined for final analysis in PROUD-PV Study: 
1. Molecular response 
Safety endpoints (safety evaluation): 
1. Incidence, causality and intensity of adverse events (AEs) according to common terminology criteria for 
adverse events (CTCAE 4.0).

3. Adverse events of special interest (AESI). 
Statistical methods: 
Sample size justification 
No formal hypothesis is planned to be tested in the CONTINUATION-PV Study. Only patients who completed 
PROUD-PV. 
Statistical analysis 
The statistical analysis was to be done in agreement with the ICH Topic E9, Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials 
and the SAP finalized and approved by the Sponsor and the study statistician before database lock. 
Analyses were to be conducted using Statistical Analysis System (SAS®) software, version 9.3 or higher (SAS 
Institute, Cary, NC, USA). 
Analyses of preliminary data without any impact on the study may have been carried out in order to provide 
results before study completion. 
Efficacy analysis 
All statistical analyses were to be performed for exploratory purposes. The standard level of significance, 
alpha=5%, was set for this study. All confidence intervals and tests were to be two-sided. 
Participant flow 
Results: 
A total of 171 patients were enrolled in this study. All enrolled patients completed PROUD-PV Study, 95 patients 
previously treated in ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm and 76 patients participated in hydroxyurea (HU) arm. The 
roll-over rate from PROUD-PV Study into its extension study (CONTINUATION-PV Study) was 78.8% (171/217); 
89.6% (95/106) for ropeginterferon alfa-2b-treated and 68.5% (76/111) for (in PROUD-PV Study) HU- treated 
patients. 
Patients entered CONTINUATION-PV Study after a median of 14 days (range 0-122 days) in the ropeginterferon 
alfa-2b arm, and after a median of 148 days (range 69-481 days) in the BAT arm. The difference is due to the 
Assessment report  
EMA/11025/2019 
Page 74/113 
  
  
 
fact, that the Study Protocol version 4.0, which introduced patients who participated in HU arm of PROUD-PV 
Study to be included into CONTINUATION-PV Study, is dated 15 Jul 2015, i.e. 9 months after the first patient 
completed PROUD-PV Study (04 Oct 2014). 
Demographics: 
All 171 patients were included in the Full Analysis Set (FAS). As all patients enrolled in the CONTINUATION-PV 
Study previously participated in the PROUD- PV Study, baseline values for demographics and other 
characteristics of patients continuing in CONTINUATION-PV Study are taken from the screening visit on 
PROUD-PV Study (i.e. before first study treatment in PROUD-PV Study). 
• The mean age at inclusion was 57.5 years (SD: 11.0) with a median of 59.0 years (range 30 to 85 years). 
• 83/171 (48.5%) patients were male and 88/171 (51.5%) were female. 
• 100 % of patients were Caucasian. 
At database (soft) lock (29 May 2018) a total of 24 (14.0%) patients had prematurely discontinued the study, 
a total of 147 patients is still active in the study. 
The mean duration of treatment for all patients included in the 36-month treatment analysis (12 months of 
treatment within PROUD-PV and 24-month treatment within CONTINUATION-PV Study) was 176.7 weeks 
(median 181.6, range: 68 to 232). 
Efficacy Results: 
The roll-over rate from PROUD-PV Study into its extension study CONTINUATION-PV Study shows that more 
patients were roll-over in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm: 89.6% (95/106) for ropeginterferon alfa-2b-treated 
and 68.5% (76/111) for HU- treated patients in PROUD-PV. Patients included in the HU arm of the PROUD-PV 
Study were labelled as best available treatment (BAT) arm in CONTINUATION-PV Study. Patients entered 
CONTINUATION-PV Study after a median of 14 days (range 0-122 days) in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm, but 
significantly later after a median of 148 days (range 69-481 days) in the BAT arm.  
All 95 patients enrolled in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm received the study drug. The overall number of 
ropeginterferon alfa-2b doses administered was 1844 doses. The mean dose of ropeginterferon alfa-2b at 12 
months (EoT of PROUD-PV Study) for the 36-month population (n=95) was 391 (±137) μg, the median dose 
was 450 (range: 50 - 500) μg administered by assessment visit. At 24 months the mean dose was 377 (±142) 
μg, and the median was 450 (range: 50-500) μg. At 36 months, the mean dose of ropeginterferon alfa-2b 
administered by assessment visit was 363 (±149) μg; the median dose was 425 (range: 35 - 500) μg 
The 76 patients enrolled in the BAT arm received best available treatment for PV disease (at discretion of the 
investigator). All 76 patients in the BAT arm received HU as the primary treatment for PV at least once during the 
CONTINUATION-PV study; at month 12 95.8% (46/48), at month 24 98.4% (61/62) and at month 36 97.0% 
(64/66). The median dose for the control arm remains constant in patients transitioned from the PROUD-PV 
Study (solely HU-treated) to the CONTINUATION-PV Study (BAT option with almost all patients treated further 
with HU). The efficacy results indicated that the maximum responder rate was not achieved within PROUD-PV 
Study (up to Month 12).

The best observed disease response rate (defined as complete haematological response and spleen size 
normality) in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm was achieved at Month 33 with 43.8% (39/89), in the BAT arm at 
Month 18 with 48.9% (23/47). The best observed haematological response in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm 
was again achieved at Month 33 with 74.7% (71/95), whereas the best observed haematological response in 
BAT arm was already achieved at Month 12 (EOT PROUD-PV Study) with 74.7%. 
Up to Month 36, the number of patients with at least one phlebotomy recorded in last 90 days, steadily 
decreased: 20.5% (35/171) at Month 12 to 12.6% (19/151) at Month 36. 
In the ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm the decrease was more prominent: 28.4% (27/95) to 14.5% (12/83), 
respectively at Month 12 and 36 In the BAT arm, the reverse trend was observed, in that the number of patients 
with at least one phlebotomy recorded within the last 90 days, increased from 10.5% (8/76) at Month 12 to 
18.8% (12/64) at Month 24, and then a decrease to Month 36 to 10.3% (7/68). 
No patient reached complete molecular response. (Partial) molecular response was observed for 43.6% (41/94; 
month 12), 68.1% (64/94; month 24) and 66.0% (62/94; month 36) in patients treated with ropeginterferon 
alfa-2b (LOCF). In the BAT arm, the (partial) molecular response was observed for 50.7% (38/75; month 12), 
33.3% (25/75; month 24) and 27.0% (20/74; month 36). 
The median absolute levels of JAK-2 allelic burden ranged in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b treatment arm from 
9.5% (Month 36) to 23.7% (Month 12). The median differences from baseline (Month 0) ranged from −24.3% 
(Month 36) to –12.6%% (Month 12). The median absolute levels of JAK-2 allelic burden ranged in the BAT 
treatment arm from 18.2% (Month 12) to 42.5% (Month 30). The median differences from baseline (Month 0) 
ranged from −13.7% (Month 12) to 2.5% (Month 36). 
In CONTINUATION-PV Study, the comparator arm was changed to BAT/HU;  however, 100% of the 
patients received at least once HU as the primary treatment for PV. At 36-months (24 months of 
CONTINUATION-PV Study), 97.0% still received HU as the primary treatment for PV. The roll-over rate from 
PROUD-PV Study in the extension study CONTINUATION-PV was higher in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm with 
89.6% (95/106) previously ropeginterferon alfa-2b-treated compared with 68.5% (76/111) previously HU- 
treated patients in PROUD-PV. Although imbalances increased and more drop-outs in the comparator arm 
occurred, the results are considered relevant for the efficacy discussion. Additionally, these results will allow 
assessing duration of efficacy for both drugs at least to some degree.  
At this time, only interim analyses of efficacy from this ongoing long term trial are available (i.e. 24-month 
treatment analysis and 36-month treatment analysis)

Within the first 24 months of treatment with ropeginterferon alfa-2b clinical response rates (defined as CHR and 
improvement of clinical symptoms/signs) consistently increased (46.3% at Month 12, 52.6% at Month 36), 
whereas the response rates in the control arm (Best available treatment arm, majority of patients still receiving 
HU) decreased after 12 months of treatment (51.3% at Month 12, 37.8% at Month 36). 
Clinical response rates (defined as CHR and improvement of clinical symptoms/signs) remained stable in both 
treatment arms in the third year of treatment (52.6% and 37.8%, respectively in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b 
and control arm at Month 36).  
Preliminary results from the current interim analysis may indicate that the differences in maintenance of 
response become similar between ropeginterferon alfa-2b and BAT/HU during long treatment and this seems to 
be mainly caused by an increase and stabilisation haematological parameters in target range, while impact on 
spleen size is difficult to interpret and overall less informative in this still early stage population. Interestingly, 
the need for phlebotomy seemed to be significantly lower after longer treatment periods (e.g. Month 21).  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
This application is based on a single pivotal phase 3 trial. The PROUD-PV trial was an open-label, randomized, 
controlled, parallel-group, non-inferiority study comparing the efficacy and safety of ropeginterferon alfa-2b 
(AOP2014) over hydroxyurea (HU) over 12 months in 254 patients with Polycythemia Vera. Patients at EOT at 
12 months who responded on treatment with ropeginterferon alfa-2b  had the opportunity to continue treatment 
in the ongoing CONTINUATION-PV trial (supportive extension trial). 
Two other trials were performed by the applicant: The phase 1/2 trial PEGINVERA-PV aiming to characterise 
MTD and PK and the PEN-PV trial (phase 3) aiming to assess the self-administration of ropeginterferon alfa-2b 
using a pre-filled pen. A small PK comparison trial (in healthy adults) with ropeginterferon alfa-2b (P1101) was 
performed by a different sponsor. 
In PROUD-PV Study, randomization and stratification (based on the age: older than 60 years, or younger than 
60 years at entry, occurrence of at least one thrombotic event in the past [yes/no], and previous HU exposure 
[yes/no]) adhered to the general principles laid down in current guidelines (CHMP/ICH/363/96). 
It is acknowledged that a double-blind design was not an option due to obvious differences in routes of 
administration (s.c. vs. oral) and toxicity between study regimens. So the study was open label. Methods were 
implemented to limit potential bias: relevant blood values at month 12 (primary endpoint) and other endpoints 
Assessment report  
EMA/11025/2019 
Page 81/113 
  
  
 
 
 
 
were measured by a central laboratory, blinded to treatment assignment. Spleen size was assessed by 
observer-independent imaging (computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging [CT/MRI]) with blinded 
radiologic assessment at screening and month 12.  
The applicant decided to set the 540 µg dose as MTD although no dose limited toxicity was observed as outcome 
of both stages of PEGINVERA-PV trial. Thus, it seems questionable whether this dose really represents the MTD. 
Overall, dose selection was triggered by tolerability reasons mainly and the level of evidence that efficacy at this 
dose is equivalent to other pegylated interferons was low. No phase II trial was performed. Nevertheless, the 
dose finding is deemed acceptable considering the limitations clinical development programs in an orphan 
disease entity.  
Due to the absence of an adequate dose finding in a phase II trial, the proposed dose titration in the PROUD-PV 
trial for ropeginterferon alfa-2b was very conservative. Since dose escalation of ropeginterferon alfa-2b was 
performed in 50 μg steps up to 500 μg every two weeks, time until full efficacy becomes evident was foreseeable 
prolonged. A 20 weeks difference to reach the maximum dose plateau was observed between the arms and 
probably has significantly biased the outcome in favour for HU.   
Patients with known risk or contraindication for interferon and hydroxyurea were adequately defined. 
Additionally, subjects that might have additional intrinsic risk or adding potential difficulties in interpreting the 
safety outcome are also sufficiently excluded. Overall, the selected population is in accordance with that applied 
for in this procedure. Although presence of thromboembolic events in the past was used as a stratification factor, 
differences regarding cardiovascular risks between both arms are not excluded. 
HU is the most commonly used approved cytoreductive agent in this disease. This comparator was accepted by 
the CHMP during a scientific advice procedure since there is no interferon approved for the applied indication. 
However, due to the known differences in response kinetics between cytotoxic drugs and interferons, time to 
response is likely to differ significantly. Dose titration and exposure with HU was adequate in PROUD-PV.  
The primary endpoint as a composite of clinically relevant outcomes measures of treatment efficacy is 
acceptable. However, intrinsic difficulties in assessing composite endpoints in small orphan disease population 
have to be considered. The secondary endpoints allow differentiating the outcome for the different 
haematological components of the composite endpoint as well as time to response and duration of response. 
They are all clinically relevant and discriminative. Moreover, the inclusion of change of JAK2 allelic burden over 
time allows some information about treatment effects on disease related important molecular marker.  
The study was initially designed as a superiority trial, but switched to a non-inferiority trial after completion of 
the study (last patient out, prior database lock). The sample size calculation was based on assumptions for 
superiority and the change could not influence sample size calculation. The method that was used for blinded 
sample size re-assessment does in principle not require adjusting the level of significance. The statistical 
methods are generally considered appropriate, but neither a statistical nor a clinical justification of the -10.5% 
NI or -20% NI margin was provided. Therefore, from a biostatistical point of view, the actual differences 
between treatments as well as the results for the additional endpoints need to be interpreted in an exploratory 
sense only.  
Baseline demographic characteristics were balanced between both arms. The same is true with respect to the 
measurable haematological disease parameters, the spleen size and median JAK2 allelic burden. No relevant 
imbalances at baseline were noted. Moreover, the drop-out proportion was low and slightly higher for 
ropeginterferon alfa-2b than for HU. Sensitivity analyses available are considered sufficient to assess impact of 
drop-outs.

CONTINUATION-PV trial was a follow up study designed to provide long-term evaluation of ropeginterferon 
alfa-2b in patients with PV who were previously treated in the PROUD-PV Study. Subjects who participated in the 
PEN-PV Study in order to evaluate an alternative mode of administration (self-administration with PEN) were 
also integrated in this trial. In a rare disease as PV this overlap of study population is not a major concern. 
Additionally, data from the routine care treatment of patients, who participated in the PROUD-PV Study and 
were allocated to the HU arm, is collected. Currently two interim analyses from this long term trial are available: 
i.e. 24-month and 36-month treatment analysis (12 months treatment during PROUD-PV study and 12/24 
months treatment during CONTINUATION-PV study). The 12/24 months results from the CONTINUATION-PV 
trial offer the only opportunity for a more valid characterization beyond the 12 months treatment (within 
PROUD-PV Study) effect with adequately dosed ropeginterferon alfa-2b.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The pivotal PROUD-PV Study failed to show superiority as well as non-inferiority with respect to the pre-specified 
primary efficacy endpoint outcome “disease response rate at end of study (12 month)” (i.e. complete 
haematological response and spleen size normality).  
Post-hoc the applicant has proposed a redefined primary endpoint “complete haematological response (without 
spleen normalisation)” in order to demonstrate efficacy. The reason for changing the primary endpoint was that 
significant splenomegaly was only present in a few patients at baseline and spleen size fluctuations observed 
during the trial were small in the range of that observed also in a healthy population. 
Only for the new post-hoc primary endpoint analysis and post-hoc widened NI margin of – 20% non-inferiority 
could be demonstrated for ropeginterferon alfa-2b as indicated by a complete haematological response of 
43.1% (43/122) in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm versus 45.6% (57/123) in the HU arm after 12 months of 
treatment. The p-value is reported with 0.0028. However, this non-inferiority analysis can hardly be considered 
confirmatory at least from a methodological point of view.  
These weaknesses in reaching clear demonstration of non-inferiority seem to be due to the difference between 
the arms to reach the maximum dose plateau (on cohort level). In the ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm the 
maximum median dose plateau level (i.e. end of titration phase) was reached 20 weeks later than in HU arm 
(week 28 vs week 8). This delay seems to have significantly disadvantaged APO2014 in comparison to HU. At 
EOT endpoint assessment HU patients were already treated adequately for 10 months, while ropeginterferon 
alfa-2b patients had only 6 months comparable treatment intensity. At the end source of bias may be reasonably 
presumed. A comparison of results from the CONTINUATION-PV trial allows to further investigate this issue: 
Estimating efficacy after 12 and 24 months effective treatment with ropeginterferon alfa-2b and BAT (majority 
treated with HU) disease response increased to 70.5% (67/95) in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm at month 24 
and month 36, and 49.3% (33/67) at month 24 and 51.4 (38/74) at month 36 in the BAT arm. Insofar, a similar 
efficacy after adequate treatment intensity seems likely. 
Most importantly, PV is a disease without spontaneous remission. Thus, considering the absolute benefit of a 
treatment with ropeginterferon alfa-2b based on a comparison to baseline ropeginterferon alfa-2b showed a 
clear cytoreductive effect. An efficacy comparison of the differences between the four AOP efficacy studies 
(PEGINVERA; PROUD, CONTINUATION and PEN-PV) shows that the response rate for the haematological 
parameters Hct, PLT and leukocytes (complete haematological responders) ranged between 43% and 75% in 
the clinical studies due to different exposure times. It is obvious that response may further increase and can be 
maintained in up to 70.5% as demonstrated from the interim results after 24 month treatment duration from the 
CONTINUATION-PV trial (i.e. 36-month overall treatment duration). Insofar, explorative results after 36 months 
Assessment report

of treatment indicate a similar efficacy as that reported for IFN- α in the literature. Clinical response rates 
(defined as CHR and improvement of clinical symptoms/signs) consistently increased within the first 24 months 
of treatment with ropeginterferon alfa-2b (46.3% at Month 12, 49.5% at Month 24) and remained stable in the 
third year of treatment (52.6% at Month 36). The prolonged time activity due to the very slow dose titration of 
ropeginterferon alfa-2b is considered acceptable as in non-responders, phlebotomy is used routinely as rescue 
in order to normalise blood hyperviscosity. Nethertheless, physicians and patients should be adequately 
informed about the prolonged time until full efficacy. 
The JAK2 allelic burden decreased during treatment in both treatment cohorts (baseline 42.8% and 42.9% in 
the two treatment arms). The median absolute levels of JAK-2 allelic burden ranged in the AOP204 treatment 
arm from 9.5% (Month 36) to 23.7% (Month 12); The median absolute levels of JAK-2 allelic burden ranged in 
the BAT treatment arm from 18.2% (Month 12) to 42.5% (Month 30). At EOT (month 12) the difference was not 
statistically significant (p=0.0736) between the treatment cohorts, but numerically with 30.7% and 25.9% in 
favour for AOP2014 versus HU treated patients, respectively. This may be seen as a benefit regarding clinical 
outcome for ropeginterferon alfa-2b, although the clinical relevance remains unknown at the time being. 
Nevertheless, it should be considered that from the treatment alternatives in PV only interferon (and probably 
busulfan) offers at least the chance for complete molecular response in PV patients. Until now, complete 
molecular response with respect to JAK2V617F has been reported in 14% to 24.1% of interferon-treated PV 
patients, but clearly long-term treatment is needed to achieve this goal. Long-term absence of disease activity 
in these patients has been reported in the literature (Perricone et al, 2017).  
Many clinical trials in the past have characterized the efficacy of interferon-alfa in PV. Thus, external validity for 
the use of interferons in the applied indication is high, but reflects off-label use only. Since no interferon product 
is currently approved in the EU for the applied orphan disease target population, hydroxyurea had to be used as 
comparator in the pivotal trial. In all relevant treatment guidelines interferons are recommended, only the 
ranking of interferon in the treatment of PV, whether in first or second line, is currently still under discussion. It 
needs to be considered that the current guidelines (ELN 2018, BSH 2018) recommend the use of pegylated 
interferon-alfa 2 for first line in patients of all ages. 
Additional expert consultation 
The SAG Oncology was requested to discuss open issues helping to address the ranking of ropeg-IFN-alfa-2b in 
the treatment of PV. The CHMP was asked the SAG Oncology the following questions:  
1.  The proposed posology of Besremi for the PROUD-PV trial includes a very conservative dose 
titration which resulted in a delay of 20 weeks to reach the maximum dose plateau between 
the treatment arms compared with HU. This difference has obviously significantly biased the 
outcome in favour for the comparator HU and is likely to explain the failure to reach the 
pre-specified primary endpoint at 12 months in PROUD-PV, while results at 18 months from 
the extension trial CONTINUATION-PV might indicate non-inferiority in efficacy. Although 
the dose-titration approach was associated with a favourable safety profile in comparison 
with HU, it has negatively affected the efficacy outcome at 12 months, since a run-in phase 
was not included in the trial. Considering the available clinical experience with interferons in 
PV, the SAG Oncology is requested to comment whether such a conservative dose titration 
as performed in the PROUD-PV trial is also used in clinical practise with other pegylated 
interferons in PV patients treated off-label with other pegylated interferons. 
As a general comment, the SAG considered that the pivotal study (PROUD-PV) suffered of critical deficiencies in 
the design and analysis, making it impossible to formally establish non-inferiority of Besremi compared to HU at 
Assessment report  
EMA/11025/2019 
Page 84/113 
  
  
any time point. Furthermore, there are no data to establish that a different titration strategy would have resulted 
in a better efficacy and acceptable safety of the product. Similarly, any claims about the observed non-inferiority 
of Besremi at later time points remain to be established given the potential selection bias and lack of 
pre-specification and handling of multiplicity. Although titration is performed with any type of agent, including 
off-label pegylated interferons, one cannot extrapolate dosing strategies between different molecules without 
evidence of similarity between products. 
Nevertheless, the SAG agreed that a clinically meaningful effect in terms of response rate has been established 
and even if formally one cannot exclude a 20% worse response rate compared to HU at 12 months, the loss of 
efficacy is not considered critical as phlebotomy can be used in the short term to compensate any lack of effect. 
Availability of a treatment option without the mutagenic and carcinogenic risks associated to HU is certainly of 
interest, particularly in younger patients more concerned about life-long exposure and especially if in a 
reproductive age. The toxicity profile observed with Besremi was considered acceptable. Thus, Besremi should 
only indicated in patients for whom agents with higher activity are not preferred based on the clinical decision 
that should be shared with physicians experienced in the disease. These types of decisions are normal in clinical 
practice given the established use of off-label interferon preparations. 
2.  Considering the outcome of the pivotal trial PROUD-PV for the post-hoc primary endpoint CHR, 
demonstration for non-inferiority of Besremi was only reached, if the NI margin was widen 
to -20%. From a methodological point of view this might indicate that a higher loss of effect 
(at least at 12 months) than acceptable for a convincing demonstration of non-inferiority 
cannot be excluded. On the other side phlebotomy, used as rescue treatment, may 
neutralise potential thromboembolic risks resulting from the very prolonged dose titration 
in the ropeginterferon-alfa-2b’s cytoreductive efficacy in comparison to HU. The SAG 
Oncology is requested to comment whether the higher loss of effect regarding CHR response 
under discussion for Besremi in comparison with HU during the first year of treatment is 
clinically relevant, considering the possibility of additional treatment with phlebotomy. 
A potential loss of 20% or more in CHR is considered clinically significant, especially in the initial treatment 
where HU is preferred to achieve a rapid response. However, given the availability of phlebotomy, this loss in the 
short term (<12 months) is considered acceptable even considering a potential for higher risk of thrombotic 
events (see answer to question No. 1). However, the benefits and risks associated with Besremi need to be 
clearly communicated patients and physicians. Besremi should be indicated in patients for whom agents with 
higher activity are not preferred based on an informed clinical decision. It should also be made clear that inferior 
efficacy compared to HU after 12 months has not been formally established and that patients are likely at higher 
risk of thrombotic events during the first 12 months (even if the trial did not show clear harms). Thus, before and 
after 12 months of starting treatment with Besremi, it is important to consider the benefits and risks compared 
to established active agents like HU and ruxolitinib (where applicable). 
3.  The SAG is requested to comment, whether the indication of the applied 
ropeginterferon-alfa-2b (Besremi) needs to be restricted according the data available for 
the second line (e.g. “for the treatment of patients with PV without splenomegaly in whom 
HU is not a suitable treatment [HU intolerant or HU resistant]”) or whether it can be 
approved with the applied broader indication (“treatment of polycythaemia vera (PV) in 
adults without symptomatic splenomegaly”) taking the documented long clinical experience 
with interferons in this disease into account. 
Based on the available evidence and benefit-risk considerations in the clinical decision, the SAG agreed that the 
indication should be restricted to patients with PV without splenomegaly for whom treatment with established 
Assessment report  
EMA/11025/2019 
Page 85/113 
  
  
active agents like HU or ruxolitinib (where applicable) is not considered acceptable due to the associated risks, 
and for whom a small increased risk of thrombosis associated with lower activity, especially during the first 12 
months, is considered acceptable. Patients should be adequately informed about the benefits, risks, and 
uncertainties of available options. This is considered feasible in clinical practice. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of Besremi in the indication of polycythaemia vera has been demonstrated.  
The CHMP recommends the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
- 
The final analysis from the CONTINUATION-PV trial.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Although the here applied product is currently not marketed, safety assessment needs to consider that similar 
products containing peginterferon alfa-2b are approved and have been frequently used in other indications (e.g. 
Hepatitis C, myeloproliferative disorders like CML and also off-label for PV).  
At least two types of peginterferon products are currently available on the EU market (Plough’s PEG-Intron®; 
PEGASYS®). As other PEGylated products, both differ in regards to their pharmacokinetics (PK) and 
recommended dosing in patients. The here applied product was designed to be more stable (“third-generation 
PEGylated interferon”) and allows a twice-monthly (i.e., once every two weeks) s.c. injection for use in 
PV-population. However, with respect to primary and secondary pharmacology Besremi seemed to be rather 
similar to the other products. 
Thus, the general safety profile of ropeginterferon alfa-2b can be seen as well characterized and safety data 
provided for Besremi can be compared with that of the already approved products regarding consistency or 
differences. 
INFs in general are used since decades in several indications, insofar the safety profile including long-term 
safety of interferons is very well characterized, whether they are PEGylated or not. 
Specific clinical safety data for Besremi is derived from the PEGINVERA, PEN-PV and the pivotal trials PROUD-PV 
as well as from the extension trial CONTINUATION-PV(long-term data); for details of these trials please refer to 
the efficacy section above. Long term safety is available from the phase I PEGINVERA and phase III 
CONTINUATION-PV trials. 
Data from the pivotal phase III trial PROUD-PV (and the extension trial CONTINUATION-PV) allow a safety 
comparison with Hydroxyurea (or BAT). 
For analyses of the relevant safety outcome (TEAEs, ADRs, SAEs and SADRs) the applicant has pooled the data, 
but differences between the studies are assessable from the presented tables. 
Long term experience up to 7 years is available from some patients in the PEGINVERA trial. 
There is a lack of information regarding subgroups of patients with higher safety risks (e.g. in general 
autoimmune and uncontrolled thyroid diseases, psychiatric disorders, severe cardiovascular disease, 
immunosuppressed transplant recipients), because these patients were excluded from the clinical trials. 
Treatment of these subgroups is adequately contraindicated in the product information.

Patient exposure  
At time of cut-off (29 May 2018) in total 178 patients were exposed and a number of patients participated in 
consecutive PV studies with the study drug (PROUD-PV Study, CONTINUATION-PV Study and PEN-PV Study). In 
all clinical studies with ropeginterferon alfa-2b, patients were exposed to the drug for a mean of 38 months; 
constituting 548.8 patient-years.

Life-threatening TEAEs in ropeginterferon alfa-2b were Multi-organ failure, Cholecystitis acute, Septic shock and 
Acute kidney injury – each occurred once. One life-threatening TEAE in the HU arm was Hyponatraemia. One 
death (Glioblastoma) occurred in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm. TEAEs leading to study discontinuation were 
reported overall in 9/254 patients (3.5%).   
Adverse events of special interest were also more frequent in ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm, but overall only 
observed in a small percentage of patients (ropeginterferon alfa-2b:8,7% vs HU:3.1%). 
SAEs after prolonged exposure as available from the pooled PROUD-PV+PEN+CONTI results are only slightly 
higher than in PROUD-PV (pooled: 12.6 % vs PROUD 11.0%). 
In the pooled safety population the percentage of patients reporting at least one ADR was lower for the 
ropeginterferon alfa- 2b vs. the HU/BAT (66.1% vs. 76.4%, respectively), but the total number of ADRs in the 
ropeginterferon alfa-2b was slightly higher (590 vs. 431) probably biased also due to the higher number of 
patients in the ropeginterferon –alfa-2b arm. 
In conclusion, the reported key characteristics of safety for ropeginterferon alfa-2b and HU is deemed similar or 
slightly superior from this analysis; however, limitations from the overall small number have to be considered as 
well as the overall lower treatment intensity with ropeginterferon alfa-2b in PROUD-PV.

According the PROUD-PV results the most common ADRs (>10%) of both drugs are qualitatively rather similar 
as the haematotoxicity at the same time also represent the drug’s efficacy. Whether the more frequent events 
for thrombocytopenia, anaemia and leukopenia reflect a beneficial difference or solely indicate the difference in 
exposure cannot be decided. In conclusion, according the analysis of the adverse events reported at least the 
acute toxicities between both arms may be comparable, however, different.  
Adverse events of special interest 
Regarding the major disease-related cardiovascular and thromboembolic events2 event rates are 8.7% 
(11/127) of patients in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm and 5.5% (7/127) of patients in the HU treatment arm. 
The most frequently observed major cardiovascular PV-related adverse events in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b 
arm were atrial fibrillation [(3 events in 2.4% (3/127) of patients)], while in HU patients most events were 
caused also by atrial fibrillation [2.4% (3/127)] but also due to cardiac failure [3.2% (3/127)].

Phlebotomy need during the individual titration phase (i.e. visits with haematocrit > 45%) ranged between 0-27 
visits (median 3.0 [Q1-Q3: 1-6]) and 0-6 visits (median 1.0 [Q1-Q3: 0- 2]), respectively in the ropeginterferon 
alfa-2b and HU treatment arm. Patients with thrombo-embolic events during the individual titration phase (i.e. 
in ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm only), did not differ significantly with 0 and 2 visits (for the two identified 
patients).  
With respect to the other adverse events of special interest, the results indicate rather similarity in outcome 
between the arms; particularly for psychiatric, ocular and immunological events. PROUD-PV data concerning the 
ocular adverse events as well as from the ocular examinations revealed no increased risks from treatment with 
ropeginterferon alfa-2b. Moreover, there is no doubt that in interferons depression/anxiety events are a risk as 
well as immunological adverse events. However, the data available indicate no specific risk derived from 
ropeginterferon alfa-2b in comparison to other interferons.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events  
In PROUD-PV Study, slightly more SAEs were reported from the ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm [20 events in 
14/127 patients; 11.0%] arm than from the HU arm [16 events in 11/127 patients; 8.7%]. 13 SAEs in 5.6% 
(10/178) of patients were related to ropeginterferon alfa-2b and 3 SAEs in 2.4% (3/127) of patients to HU.  
In CONTINUATION-PV 8 additional SAEs were reported in 7/171 (ropeginterferon alfa-2b: 3.2% vs BAT/HU: 
2.1%) patients. One patient in the BAT arm died from acute leukaemia, this SAE was the only one to be assessed 
related to the study drug. After database lock a two HU additional patients developed malignancies (acute 
leukaemia/ melanoma). 
Deaths 
In PROUD-PV Study, there was 1 death in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm; during CONTINUATION-PV Study, 
one additional death in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b compared to 2 in the BAT (HU treated patients) occurred.  
Two deaths in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm were caused by Glioblastoma during the clinical development 
(PEGINVERA and PROUD-PV Study).  
Laboratory findings 
There is no signal detected for an increased renal toxicity in both arms. Median changes for creatinine and blood 
urea from baseline to EOT are comparable between ropeginterferon alfa-2b and HU arms were comparable.  
Several clinically important changes in sodium, potassium and calcium (including a few grade 4 events) were 
observed similarly in both arms (ropeginterferon alfa-2b: 3 vs HU: 5) during PROUD-PV. Whether these events 
represent a drug related, a disease related or concomitant medication reason cannot be decided.  However, one 
life-threatening event of hyponatremia occurred in the HU arm.  
With respect to the safety assessment of ropeginterferon alfa-2b, an increased hepatotoxicity was observed 
consistently in PROUD-PV and CONTINUATION-PV trial. While no hepatotoxicity was observed in the HU arm, 
clinically significantly elevated liver enzymes [gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)] reported for ropeginterferon alfa-2b. This finding indicates rather a 
mild hepatotoxicity, but two cases of ALT increased grade 3 were reported in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm. 
However, as it was clarified during the procedure hepatotoxicity is a well-known safety class effect of interferons 
(including cases of DILI).  
Significantly abnormal values for the different parameter mentioned occurred in 2 to 10 % of the 
ropeginterferon alfa-2b-treated target population during the treatment duration (including extension trial). The 
increase was most pronounced for the GGT, but overall balanced also for AST and ALT. No “Hy’s Law” case was 
identified up to now during the clinical development of ropeg-IFN-alfa-2b.  
Additionally, the impact of concomitant medication, particularly with NSAIDs on hepatotoxicity was sufficiently 
clarified. Intake of paracetamol was recommended as standard prior administration of ropeg-IFN-alfa-2b as 
standard for prevention of typical flu-like adverse events in interferons. Thus this concomitant medication may 
have also contributed to the differences in ALT/AST and y-GT outcome. (Particularly, as blood samples for 
laboratory analyses were taken < 36 hours after intake of paracetamol). The impact of other factors on 
hepatotoxicity (e.g. accumulation of PEG) was considered, but could be sufficiently rejected during the 
procedure since the total PEG concentration is significantly below the levels probably indication safety risk 
according the recommendations of the safety working party.  
Assessment report  
EMA/11025/2019 
Page 93/113 
  
  
Although hepatotoxicity was not very pronounced in the trial, the treatment is a long term one and from the 
reports of DILI in the literature for all interferons, hepatotoxicity is considered as the most clinical relevant 
toxicity of interferons, relevant including also ropeg-IFN-alfa-2b. 
Safety in special populations 
Information regarding the use in special populations was now provided; however, due to the orphan disease 
character of PV the value of the events observed in the few patients included is not informative. However, it 
needs to be considered that safety of interferons in general is well characterised also special population due to 
the long experience with these products.

Immunological events 
Repeated administration of recombinant IFNα, can result in a break in immune tolerance to self-antigens in 
some patients resulting in the production of anti-IFN antibodies. These antibodies may bind to the IFN molecule 
in such a manner that they are largely without effect, or they may alter IFN pharmacokinetics, or in certain cases 
neutralize the activity of the IFN by binding to an epitope that prevents IFN from binding to its cell-surface 
receptor on target cells. Incidence of anti-IFN antibody production are reported as highly variable (7 to 60%) in 
the literature, but seemed to be lower in pegylated products.  
Interferons are known to increase autoantibody titer in general as a class effect. In particular, antibodies against 
antinuclear antigens (ANAs), erythrocyte and thyroid antigens have been identified as clinically relevant. 
Therefore, patients with known autoimmune disease and thyroid dysfunction or thyroid autoantibodies were 
excluded from the PROUD-PV trial, which is adequately reflected in the contraindications. 
The presence of immunologic reactions, including development of anti-thyroid antibodies with clinical symptoms 
as well as IFN-induced hypersensitivity (anti-IFN antibodies) was tested in the clinical studies; the validity of the 
methods used was clarified during the response.  
In the PROUD-PV trial two clinically significant abnormal values of ANA were observed in the ropeginterferon 
alfa-2b arm at two visits (week 22 and month 9). Starting with study week 12 inclusively (end of titration phase) 
one clinically significant abnormality was reported in TgAb in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm at each study visit 
excluding follow-up. One (week 20 and month 12) to two (screening and FU) clinically significant abnormalities 
were recorded for TPOAb in HU arm.  
During longer exposure in the extension CONTINUATION-PV trial anti-thyroglobulin antibody titers were 
significantly increased in six cases during treatment longer than 18 months. Immunogenicity antibodies are

analysed using frequencies of positive results. Positive results were observed in HU arm only (one case per each 
study visit excluding visit at week 4). 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No product specific interaction studies have been performed with Besremi.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events   
Patients discontinued the ropeginterferon-alfa-2b were 21/127 versus 16/127 in the HU arm in PROUD-PV. 
While withdrawal of consent was balanced between the arm, adverse event associated reasons were more 
frequent in the ropeginterferon-alfal-2b arm (B: 11/21 versus HU: 3/16). Lack of efficacy leading to 
discontinuation was only described in 2 patients in the HU arm.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Due to the rarity of the disease (0.8 -2.6/100 000) a number of patients participated in consecutive PV studies 
with the study drug (PROUD-PV Study, CONTI-PV Study and PEN-PV Study). The total of 178 of PV patients 
exposed is considered adequate in the context of the disease and a similar size as required for the approval of 
Jakavi in PV (Besremi: n=127 / Jakavi =110) and is larger than the PV population initially presented for HU for 
demonstration of efficacy and safety (N=56).  
The comparator was adequately dosed in the trial population (~ 125 mg/kgBW /week) taking a literature 
recommended dose range of 105 -140 mg/kg/week into account. Although times of exposure with 
ropeginterferon alfa-2b and the comparator HU in the PROUD-PV trial were balanced, the mean dose of 
approximately 380 μg (with a median dose of 450 μg) indicates that dose intensity of treatment was relatively 
low for ropeginterferon alfa-2b and reflects the conservative dose escalation already mentioned. The lower dose 
intensity during the first 6 months may have resulted in lower drug related adverse event rates in the PROUD-PV 
trial during this time, as indicated by a decreased need for dose reductions due to drug-related adverse events 
(ropeginterferon alfa-2b: 25.2% versus HU:51.2%). Overall in the clinical development program, patients were 
exposed to the drug ropeginterferon alfa-2b for a mean of 38 months, constituting 548.8 patient-years. This 
indicates that long-term experience is sufficient to allow a valid safety evaluation for this application.  
Mode of pegylation of ropeginterferon-alfa-2b- is different compared with other PEG interferons. During the 
procedure it was discussed at which degree PEG may accumulate in the body and potentially may cause organ 
damage after long-term administration. The applicant has presented meanwhile sufficient comparative data 
with other interferons regarding PEG-accumulation in the body and valid calculations to preclude this risk. Since 
this calculations regarding potential accumulation of ropeg-IFN-alfa-2b in humans were satisfying, non-clinical 
data are deemed not necessary.  
Frequencies of TEAEs during the PROUD-PV trial were slightly higher in the HU arm (TEAE: ropeginterferon 
alfa-2b: 81.9% vs HU:87.4% /ADR: ropeginterferon alfa-2b: 59.8% vs HU:75.6%) and also the differences with 
respect to the intensity of TEAE as reflected by the grading differences may indicate a slightly superiority for 
ropeginterferon alfa-2b. Whether these differences are clinically relevant may be challenged as grade 3 and 4 
events were rare and existing imbalances are difficult to interpret due to the small numbers of events. 
Assessment report  
EMA/11025/2019 
Page 96/113 
  
  
In the PROUD-PV study the most common ADRs (>10%) of both drugs are qualitatively rather similar as 
haematotoxicity of both drug at the same time also represent the drug’s efficacy. Whether more frequent events 
of thrombocytopenia, anemia and leukopenia observed in the HU arm reflect superiority in favour for 
ropeginterferon alfa-2b or solely indicate the difference in exposure cannot be decided. According to the analysis 
of the adverse events reported at least the acute toxicities between both arms may be comparable, however, 
differences regarding typical interferon adverse events as fatigue, flu-like illness, myalgia, arthralgia, fever are 
not surprising and intrinsic characteristics. Hepatotoxicity is also known as a known safety risk for interferons.  
Frequency and adverse events reported from the PROUD-PV trial for ropeginterferon alfa-2b and HU are in 
accordance with that well known for interferons and HU. 
With respect to the other adverse events of special interest, the results indicate rather similarity in outcome 
between the arms; particularly for psychiatric, ocular and immunological events. PROUD-PV data concerning the 
ocular adverse events as well as from the ocular examinations revealed no increased risks from treatment with 
ropeginterferon alfa-2b. Moreover, there is no doubt that in interferons depression/anxiety events are risks as 
well as immunological adverse events.  
The proposed contraindications are in line with the exclusion criteria in the trials and with those of already 
licensed interferons and are considered appropriate. After changes performed as requested after the initial 
indication, the product information in general seems now adequately to reflect remaining uncertainties 
regarding ropeginterferon-alfa 2b and restrictions for the use of interferons in general.  
SAEs in PROUD-PV were reported slightly more frequent in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm (ropeginterferon 
alfa-2b:11.0% vs HU:8.7%). During longer treatment, as reflected by the CONTINUATION-PV results, rates 
may become lower and more similar (ropeginterferon alfa-2b: 3.2% vs BAT/HU: 2,1%). However, the 
differences in safety assessment between both trials suggest that PROUD-PV results are more valid due to the 
more frequent safety monitoring.  
During PROUD-PV and CONTINUATION-PV Study, there were mortality was comparable between the two 
treatment arms (ropeginterferon alfa-2b:2 vs HU: 2); it is important to consider that the only drug-related death 
was observed in the HU arm from acute leukaemia. An increase in leukaemia rate is well documented in the 
literature for Hydroxyurea, while the absence of genotoxicity and carcinogenicity is a well-documented benefit 
for interferons. In this context it should be noted that after database lock two more HU patients developed 
malignancies (acute leukaemia/ melanoma). 
The risk for TE events is significantly increased in the PV population compared with the general population. That 
is the reason for including the parameter of previous TE event as a risk factor and an indicator to start 
cytoreductive therapy in PV disease. This is reflected in significant different TE rates between PV patients 
receiving cytoreductive therapy (< 10%) and not receiving cytoreductive therapy (32.8% - 44.8%). As in the 
first 6 months treatment intensity in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm was significantly lower, these events may 
indicate an insufficient treatment effect during this period. Although phlebotomy as rescue treatment 
normalised a potential blood hyperviscosity increased leucocytes may also contribute to the thromboembolic 
risk. 
In the ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm, the risk ratio of thromboembolic events occurring during the individual 
titration phase vs the non-titration phase was 1.00 (95% CI: 0.14 to 6.99, p>0.999). The statistical analysis did 
not show that there is a risk of thromboembolic events associated with the titration phase in the ropeginterferon 
alfa-2b arm. Taking the even longer titration phase definition (time until maximum dosing plateau is achieved, 
i.e. 28 weeks for ropeginterferon alfa-2b), again, no increased risk of thromboembolic events during the titration

phase compared to the non-titration phase was identified in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b treatment arm 
(p>0.999).  
Two cases of stroke were observed in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm during the titration phase compared to 
none in the HU arm. It is acknowledged that TE events –although significantly more frequent in PV patients than 
in healthy population and a major risk of this disease- are overall rare events. However, it raises concerns that 
both events occurred during the titration phase and thus, may probably indicate a higher risk from the longer 
dose titration phase for ropeginterferon-alfa-2b. As these events are rare, but can become life-threatening, they 
are clinically relevant and very important. The observed imbalance is adequately reflected in the SmPC in order 
to information the target population that a potential higher risk for thromboembolic complications during the 
first 6 months cannot be excluded at present (see SmPC section 4.4.).   
The observation of two cases of Glioblastoma leading to death occurred in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm was 
considered as a chance finding as no similar events were documented in the literature or assessed from post 
marketing sources as potential signals.  
With respect to the laboratory assessment of ropeginterferon alfa-2b an increased hepatotoxicity in terms of 
mild liver enzyme elevations (GGT, AST, ALT), but not with respect to clinical symptoms, was identified during 
the initial assessment. The applicant clarified in the response that this potential signal can be seen as a 
well-known class safety effect of all interferons is classified also in most of the product information of approved 
products. Hepatotoxicity for ropeg-IFN –alfa-2b observed can be classified as mild, but two cases of ALT 
increased grade 3 were reported and DILI cases are reported for all interferons in the literature. Moreover, the 
recommended intake of paracetamol or other NSARs shortly before administration of ropeg-IFN-alfa2b is likely 
to have contributed also to the elevation of liver enzymes. Overall frequency seems to be between 2 to 10 % in 
the ropeginterferon alfa-2b treated population (including CONTINUATION-PV results). No case fulfilling Hy’s 
law” criteria were reported. 
There is no signal detected for an increased renal toxicity in both arms. Median changes for creatinine and blood 
urea from baseline to EOT were comparable between ropeginterferon alfa-2b and HU arms. Electrolyte 
disturbances were balanced, although one life-threatening event of hyponatremia occurred in the HU arm. 
Increased autoantibody formation is a well-known interferon class effect, but the frequency (up 6 events in 
CONTINUATION-PV) and grade of increase observed in the limited target population have not given rise to an 
additional relevant safety signal in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b treated patients. In comparison to other 
interferons the frequency appears to be lower. Patients at increased risk for immunological reactions are 
adequately contraindicated. Development of antibodies against interferon was not reported with 
ropeginterferon-alfa-2b in the limited target population.  
No product specific interaction studies have been performed with Besremi to evaluate drug-drug interactions or 
other interactions. Information provided in section 4.5 of the SmPC is transferred in accordance with that known 
for other comparable pegylated interferon alfa 2 products. In general, it is reassuring that safety data submitted 
was generated in a population in which most patients received concomitant medication relevant in the applied 
target population without any obvious evidence for interactions. 
Data or discussion regarding safety in special populations is very limited due to the small population investigated 
in this orphan disease. Analyses with respect to the safety outcome in the elderly population, potential safety 
differences with respect to gender, body weight and patients with increased fragility were provided. Similarly, 
differences in pharmacokinetics and safety outcome in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment were 
discussed. The conclusions were adequately reflected in SmPC due to changes performed as requested.  
Assessment report  
EMA/11025/2019 
Page 98/113 
  
  
The impact and relevance of the switching strategy in PROUD-PV for those patients who were pre-treated with 
HU before inclusion seems to be minor also with respect to the outcome on safety events. The guarded dose 
escalation strategy in the ropeginterferon-alfa-2b arm seems successful in increasing the treatment compliance. 
Discontinuation results showed an only slightly lower tolerability of ropeginterferon-alfa-2b interferon in 
comparison to hydroxyurea. 
However the dose escalation strategy may have resulted in a higher risk for thromboembolic complications, 
remains not clear. Considering the data in literature lowering of Hct below 45% in PV patients is essential for the 
reduction of the disease-associated thromboembolic risk. But, although the 2 thromboembolic events observed 
during the titration phase may be a chance finding and in general in clinical trials no difference in rates of 
thromboembolic complications between interferons and HU was observed, a higher risk for thromboembolic 
events during the first months of treatment cannot be excluded at the end. This is reflected adequately in the 
product information and in the RMP with appropriate risk minimisation strategy. It is reassuring that during 
long-term treatment with ropeg-IFN-alfa-2b the cardiovascular and thromboembolic risks seemed to be 
adequately reduced, - in line also with literature data.  
Comparing the clinical safety data assessed for ropeginterferon alfa-2b with those reported for other pegylated 
interferons. Hepatotoxicity including cases if DILI was identified to be a class safety effects of interferons known 
for all interferons. As no other interferon is approved for the target population, a head-to head comparison of 
safety is not possible.  Nevertheless, the prolongation of the administration interval for subcutaneous injections 
up to 2 weeks in comparison to once weekly may be seen as a safety advantage over other interferons. As 
predictable occurrence of most drug related adverse events (e.g. flu-like illness, arthralgia, myalgia and fever) 
is promptly related to the interferon injection, a less frequent need for injections may have a positive impact on 
safety.  
The most important undisputed safety benefit of ropeginterferon alfa-2b compared with hydroxyurea is the 
well-known complete absence of genotoxicity and carcinogenicity compared to hydroxyurea. Taking into 
account that two cases of acute leukaemia and one melanoma developed during 18 month treatment with 
hydroxyurea in a small population of 127 patients, a clinical relevant and very important benefit for 
ropeginterferon alfa-2b was already demonstrated during the clinical development of ropeginterferon alfa-2b.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of Besremi including long-term safety is very well characterized as of the submitted studies 
and  as this is a third generation of interferon and knowledge can be extrapolated from authorised products. The 
safety results allow concluding that safety profile of ropeginterferon alfa-2b is different to HU, whereas Besremi 
seems potentially slightly better regarding the frequency of haematological TEAEs (Anaemia, Leukocytopenia 
and Thrombocytopenia) and the absence of carcinogenicity.  Further results from the CONTINUATION-PV trial 
will be submitted following a recommendation from the CHMP.

Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the 
Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did not request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The new EURD list entry will therefore use the EBD to determine the forthcoming 
Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
Clinical aspects 
The CHMP considered that ropeginterferon alpha 2b as investigated in the submitted studies in terms of 
pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic properties in PV patients in [2010-018768-18 (PEGINVERA), 
2012-005259-18 (PROUD-PV), 2012-005259-18 (CONTINUATION-PV)] has shown :  
(i) a prolonged half-life in human serum, allowing the dosing interval to be significantly extended, i.e. dosing 
once every two–four weeks instead of the traditional once every week; thus leading to: 
(ii) improved patient tolerability and compliance. 
Due to the prolonged half-life in human serum allowing a prolonged dosing interval patient tolerability and 
compliance is considered to be improved.   
Conclusions on clinical aspects 
In conclusion, considering that ropeginterferon alpha 2b exhibited a prolonged half-life which resulted in an 
extended dosing interval, it can significantly improves patient tolerability, ensuring better compliance therefore 
having a significant impact on the efficacy and safety of the product. 
Therefore, the CHMP concluded that ropeginterferon alfa-2b contained in Besremi can be considered a NAS on 
the basis of indent 3 of the NTA definition of New Active Substance.    
Overall conclusions on New active substance 
Problem statement 
The applicant requested the active substance, ropeginterferon alfa-2b to be considered a new active substance 
based on the following claim: 
(i) an additional amino acid moiety specifically introduced to the N-terminus of IFN alpha-2b for the purpose of 
site-specific pegylation; 
(ii) the redesign of the activated PEG molecule to a more stable linkage, rather than succinimidyl carbonate PEG 
used for other authorised interferon products, for conjugation of the PEG molecule with proline-IFN alfa-2b; 
Collectively, the two structural innovations described in (i) and (ii) led to ropeginterferon alfa-2b consisting of a 
largely single N-terminal mono-PEGylated interferon versus other authorised interferon products.  
(iii) a 40kDa branching PEG molecule used for ropeginterferon alfa-2b versus the 12kDa linear molecule for the 
authorised EU-marketed PegIntron. 
The branching design described in (iii) led to prolonged half-life without the negative side effects of larger linear 
molecules.

Page 103/113 
  
  
The improvements in the safety and efficacy of ropeginterferon alfa-2b due to its structural innovations over 
other authorised interferon products can be summarized as follows: 
(i) prolonged half-life in human serum, allowing the dosing interval to be significantly extended, i.e. dosing once 
every two to four weeks instead of the traditional once every week; leading to: 
(ii) improved patient tolerability and compliance.  
Scientific evaluation 
Quality aspects 
Position of the Applicant 
The applicant claimed the status of a new active substance for ropeginterferon alfa-2b, as no medicinal products 
containing the active substance ropeginterferon alfa-2b are currently authorised in the European Union.  
Ropeginterferon alfa-2b is a mono-pegylated recombinant analogue of human IFNα-2b. Human IFN alpha 2b in 
its pegylated form is marketed as PegIntron in the EU.  
The non-pegylated drug intermediate of ropeginterferon alfa-2b is a human recombinant interferon alpha-2b 
with an additional proline residue at its N-terminus that, in total, has 166 amino acids in length.  
The drug intermediate is covalently modified with a 40 kilodalton (kDa) branched PEG moiety. The 40 kDa PEG 
moiety is a branched molecule consisting of two 20 kDa linear mPEG branches that are attached to a specified 
linker. One 40 kDa PEG moiety is attached to one PEGylation site on the interferon protein (i.e. N-terminal 
proline residue).  
The applicant presented data to show that the pegylation site is predominantly at the N-terminus of the drug 
intermediate, i.e., ropeginterferon alfa-2b consists of a single predominant mono-PEGylated form with only 2 
positional isomers as minor variants. By contrast, PegIntron consists of 14 positional isomers.  
The applicant also claimed that intentional pegylation at N-terminal cysteine would be challenging due to the C1 
tendency to form internal and external disulfide bonds. Incorrect disulfide bond formation is likely to promote 
protein aggregation.  
Thus, in the applicant’s view, Pro-IFN alfa-2b was chosen as the drug candidate because of its N-terminal 
homogeneity, high refolding yield, and high pegylation yield (Patent US81061607). 
Further, the applicant stated that the addition of an amino acid should be considered an extension of the original 
sequence of IFN alfa-2b that enables targeted N-terminal pegylation of the molecule. 
To obtain greater homogeneity, a functional group was also introduced to PEG molecule to act as the active site 
for selective pegylation. According to the applicant, PegIntron uses a less stable carbamate linkage which results 
in a fairly short half-life in serum and thus requires a weekly dosing interval for PegIntron. The molecular weight 
of the PEG molecule in 40kDa branched PEG in Besremi is significantly higher than PegIntron’s 12kDa thus 
impacting on the half-life both in-vitro and in-vivo. 
In summary, the applicant claimed that ropeginterferon alfa-2b is structurally different from other 
EU-authorised PEGylated-IFN alfa-2b due to the following qualitative aspects: 
(i) a novel rationally designed N-terminal site for pegylations which is an additional amino acid chosen for its 
better structural property so that a single isomer is formed during pegylation; 
Assessment report  
EMA/11025/2019 
Page 104/113 
  
  
(ii) a larger, branching 40kDa PEG molecule which reduces side effects while increasing the half-life of 
ropeginterferon alfa-2b; 
(iii) the novel linkage between the PEG molecule and interferon in ropeginterferon alfa-2b which features a 
functional group responsible for much more reliable conjugation and therefore increased half-life. 
Discussion on quality aspects 
With regard to the NAS status claimed (i.e. a chemical, biological or radiopharmaceutical substance not 
previously authorised in a medicinal product for human use in the European Union), the primary molecular 
structure, which is the basic structural element without added functional structures (e.g., pegylation) needs to 
be different from the basic structural element contained in a medicinal product authorized in the EU. In the 
CHMP’s view, the primary structure of Besremi (ropeginterferon alfa-2b) is different to Pegasys (peginterferon 
alfa-2a) due to the differences at aa23 and aa112. IFN alfa 2a and IFN alfa 2b are therefore considered different 
active substances.  
However, when comparing Besremi (ropeginterferon alfa-2b) and peginterferon alfa-2b containing products 
(such as PegIntron) and considering the basic structural element as the primary structure of interferon 
alpha-2b, CHMP concluded that Besremi and PegIntron are not different when considering structural aspects 
alone. Indeed both Besremi and PegIntron contain the same primary structural element interferon alpha-2b and 
the N-terminal proline in Besremi is an addition to this basic structural element. Consequently based on indent 
1 of the NTA definition of New Active Substance, Besremi and PegIntron should be considered known active 
substances unless it can be shown that these differences have a clinical impact in terms of safety and efficacy 
(indent 3 of Annex I of Chapter 1 - Volume 2A of the Notice to Applicants).   
Conclusions on quality aspects 
In conclusion, considering that interferon alpha 2b is the same basic structural element of both Besremi and 
PegIntron and that the addition of an amino acid at the end of the molecule is not considered to have changed 
the basic structural element of the active substance, the CHMP concluded that ropeginterferon alfa-2b contained 
in Besremi cannot be considered a NAS on the basis of indent 1 of the NTA definition of New Active Substance.     
Clinical aspects 
The CHMP considered that ropeginterferon alfa-2b as investigated in the submitted studies in terms of 
pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic properties in PV patients in [2010-018768-18 (PEGINVERA), 
2012-005259-18 (PROUD-PV), 2012-005259-18 (CONTINUATION-PV)] has shown:  
(i) a prolonged half-life in human serum, allowing the dosing interval to be significantly extended versus 
PegIntron, i.e. dosing once every two to four weeks instead of the traditional once every week; thus leading to: 
(ii) improved patient tolerability and compliance. 
Due to the prolonged half-life in human serum allowing a prolonged dosing interval patient tolerability and 
compliance is considered to be improved.  
Conclusions on clinical aspects 
In conclusion, considering that ropeginterferon alfa-2b exhibited a prolonged half-life which resulted in an 
extended dosing interval, it can significantly improve patient tolerability, ensuring better compliance therefore 
having a significant impact on the efficacy and safety of the product.

Therefore, the CHMP concluded that ropeginterferon alfa-2b contained in Besremi can be considered a NAS on 
the basis of indent 3 of the NTA definition of New Active Substance.   
Overall conclusions on New active substance 
The CHMP considers, based on the available quality and clinical data, that ropeginterferon alfa-2b contained in 
Besremi is considered to be a new active substance as it differs significantly in properties with regard to safety 
and efficacy from interferon alpha-2b contained in medicinal product(s) previously authorised within the 
European Union due to differences in molecular structure, nature of the source material or manufacturing 
process. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant 
show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of 
the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Besremi (ropeginterferon alfa-2b) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal 
product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.  
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Besremi (Ropeginterferon alfa-2b) is intended as monotherapy for the treatment of polycythaemia vera in adults 
without symptomatic splenomegaly. 
Polycythaemia vera (PV) -a very rare disease -is the most common myeloproliferative neoplasia, an acquired 
form of primary erythrocytosis which is characterised by an excess production of erythrocytes, leukocytes and 
platelets which develops when a mutated haematopoietic stem cell gains a proliferative advantage over other 
stem cells. and typically develops in late adulthood. Although the underlying molecular mechanism is still 
controversial, current theories argue that the MPN disease forms are actually linked to a similar set of acquired 
mutations (JAK2, CLR or MPL), the most important being JAK2V617F that can ultimately result in a transition 
from a “pre-leukaemic” MPN state to leukaemia. PV is a long-term debilitating and life-threatening condition as 
it is associated with the risk of thrombosis (including cerebrovascular, myocardial and peripheral atrial 
thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, transient ischemic attack, stroke, and pulmonary embolism), haemorrhage, 
and a long term propensity to develop myelofibrosis (MF) and secondary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). 
Assessment report  
EMA/11025/2019 
Page 106/113 
  
  
The median survival of untreated symptomatic patients with PV is 6 to 18 months, whereas survival of treated 
patients is 10 years or more. Accordingly, all patients with symptomatic PV should be treated in order to increase 
overall survival by reducing the risk for cardiovascular events and progression to myelofibrosis or acute 
leukemia. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In the initial phase of the disease, phlebotomy is the cornerstone of treatment with the objective of maintaining 
haematocrit below 45%, a cut-off that has been shown to be associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular death 
and major thrombosis. As PV patients are at a high risk of thrombosis, phlebotomy is often accompanied by low 
dose aspirin. Cytoreductive therapy is recommended in patients with persistent haematological abnormalities, 
clinical symptoms, poor compliance with or intolerance of phlebotomy, and those at a high risk of thrombosis 
(“high-risk PV-patients”). Most PV patients require cytoreductive therapy during the course of their disease. 
Hydroxyurea, although not approved in all EU countries for the use in the treatment of polycythaemia vera, is 
often the first-line cytoreductive therapy used in patients with polycythaemia vera. However, 
hydroxyurea-related toxicities often require either drug reduction or drug discontinuation resulting in 
inadequate management of the disease. Furthermore, due to its mechanism of action HU has the potential to be 
mutagenic and it is controversially discussed whether HU is associated with an increased risk of leukemic 
transformation after long-term use particularly in younger PV patients. 
IFN-α, known for potential efficacy in MPNs and PV particularly since end of 1980s, is still considered an 
experimental therapy (off label) in Europe due to pending approval in this indication. However, there is sufficient 
evidence from clinical trials that IFN- α is able to induce major haematological response and occasionally even 
complete molecular remissions in patients with PV accompanied by a reduction in the risk of thrombosis and 
bleeding - the major determinants of morbidity in this indication. Moreover, alfa interferons are nowadays even 
recommended as first line therapy in high-risk PV patients of all ages in the relevant ELN guideline. Previously, 
it was mainly recommended in younger or HU resistant/intolerant-patients with high-risk PV. 
Since 2015 the JAK2-inhibitor ruxolitinib (Jakavi) has been approved in the European Union “for the treatment 
of adult patients with polycythaemia vera who are resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea”.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This application is based on a single pivotal phase 3 trial (PROUD-PV) and the supportive follow-up trial, 
CONTINUATION-PV. The PROUD-PV trial was an open-label, randomized (1:1), controlled, parallel-group, 
non-inferiority study comparing the efficacy and safety of ropeginterferon over hydroxyurea over 12 months in 
257 randomised PV patients. While HU was given orally in doses from 500 mg to 3000 mg, ropeginterferon 
alfa-2b (Besremi) was administered subcutaneously s.c., 50 µg to 500 µg every two weeks, both drugs were 
given depending on response and tolerability. No relevant imbalances at baseline were observed between 
treatment arms in the included population of patients with early PV. CONTINUATION-PV trial was an open-label 
extension study to PROUD-PV designed to provide long-term evaluation of safety as well as efficacy of 
ropeginterferon alfa-2b in patients with PV who were previously treated in the PROUD-PV Study. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Non-inferiority of ropeginterferon alfa-2b was shown for the post-hoc defined NI analysis for endpoint “complete 
haematological response” and the post-hoc defined NI margin of -20% only. 43.1% (43/122) versus 45.6% 
Assessment report  
EMA/11025/2019 
Page 107/113 
  
  
(57/123) of the patients in the ropeginterferon-alfa-2b versus HU arm, respectively, reached this endpoint after 
12 months of treatment. However, considering the absolute benefit of a treatment with ropeginterferon alfa-2b 
based on a comparison to baseline ropeginterferon alfa-2b showed a clear cytoreductive effect.  An efficacy 
comparison of the differences between the four AOP efficacy studies (PEGINVERA; PROUD, CONTINUATION and 
PEN-PV) shows that the response rate for the haematological parameters Hct, PLT and leukocytes (complete 
haematological responders) ranged between 43% and 75% in the clinical studies due to different exposure 
times. Response may further increase and can be maintained in up to 70.5 % as demonstrated from the interim 
results after 36 months of treatment (i.e. after 24 months treatment duration from the CONTINUATION-PV 
trial).   
Clinical response rates (defined as CHR and improvement of clinical symptoms/signs) consistently increased 
within the first 24 months of treatment with ropeginterferon alfa-2b (46.3% at Month 12, 49.5% at Month 24) 
and remained stable in the third year of treatment (52.6% at Month 36).  
The accepted PV biomarker JAK2 allelic burden decreased during treatment in both treatment cohorts.  At EOT 
in PROUD-PV Study (month 12) the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.0736) between the 
treatment cohorts with 30.7% and 25.9% for ropeginterferon alfa-2b or HU treated patients, respectively; after 
36 months of treatment the difference was statistically significant (p<0.0001), with 16.6% and 42.5% in the 
ropeginterferon alfa-2b and BAT arm, respectively. In detail, the JAK2 allelic burden decreased during treatment 
in both treatment cohorts (baseline 42.8% and 42.9% in the two treatment arms). The median absolute levels 
of JAK-2 allelic burden ranged in the AOP204 treatment arm from 9.5% (Month 36) to 23.7% (Month 12). The 
median absolute levels of JAK-2 allelic burden ranged in the BAT treatment arm from 18.2% (Month 12) to 
42.5% (Month 30). The differences between the treatment cohorts were in favour for ropeginterferon alfa-2b 
versus HU treated patients, respectively.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
A very conservative dose escalation strategy in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm was associated with a 20 weeks 
difference in time needed to reach the maximum plateau dose between the arms in favour for the comparator 
HU. Therefore, it seems that during the 12 months trial duration patients in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm 
were treated with a lower dose intensity which likely had a significant impact on the trial outcome. It appears 
that the duration of PROUD-PV was too short and assessment of efficacy was planned too early to be able to 
show the intended superiority or at least clear non-inferiority of ropeginterferon-alfa2b.  
However, the prolonged time activity due to the very slow dose titration of ropeginterferon alfa-2b is considered 
acceptable as in non-responders phlebotomy is used routinely as rescue in order to normalise blood 
hyperviscosity. Nethertheless, physicians and patients should be adequately informed about the prolonged time 
until full efficacy. 
Information regarding outcome and consistency of favourable effects in relevant subgroups, as defined by age, 
sex, ethnicity, organ function, disease severity, or genetic polymorphism remains of limited value due to the 
small orphan disease population investigated. 
The clinical relevance of the more pronounced reduction in JAK2 burden in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm is not 
fully understood.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Frequencies of overall TEAEs as well as ADRs during the PROUD-PV trial were slightly lower in the 
ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm (TEAE: ropeginterferon alfa-2b: 81.9% vs HU: 87.4% /ADR: ropeginterferon 
alfa-2b: 59.8% vs HU: 75.6%) and also the differences with respect to the intensity of TEAE as reflected by the 
grading differences may indicate a slight superiority for ropeginterferon alfa-2b. SAEs in PROUD-PV were 
reported slightly more frequent in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm (ropeginterferon alfa-2b: 11.0% vs HU: 
8.7%). During longer treatment, as reflected by the CONTINUATION-PV results, rates may become lower and 
more similar (ropeginterferon alfa-2b: 3.2% vs BAT/HU: 2.1%). The only death deemed drug-related was 
observed in the HU arm from acute leukaemia.  
The most frequent adverse events noted for ropeginterferon alfa-2b in the target population are 
thrombocytopenia (16.3%), leukopenia (15.7%) arthralgia (12.4%), fatigue (11.8%), influenza like illness 
(10.1%) and myalgia (10.1%). The risk for the haematological adverse events described above was higher in 
the comparator arm [thrombocytopenia 26.8%, leukopenia 21.3%), while Flu-like symptoms including 
arthralgia and myalgia were more frequently observed in ropeginterferon alfa-2b. 
The risk for increased psychiatric disorder in general for the AESI “depression” was higher in the ropeginterferon 
alfa-2b arm [ropeginterferon alfa-2b: 3.2% (3/127) vs HU: 0.8% (1/127)]. An increased hepatotoxicity in terms 
of liver enzyme elevations (GGT, AST, ALT) grade 1 or 2 were observed, and two cases of ALT increased grade 
3 were reported. The frequency in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm was between 2 to 10 % (including 
CONTINUATION-PV results) and an increase during longer exposure may be discussed. Hepatotoxicity 
(including cases of DILI) is a well-known class safety effect reported for all interferons. Besremi is 
contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment due to available knowledge on the interferons.   
Antibodies against antinuclear antigens (ANAs), erythrocyte and thyroid antigens have been identified as 
clinically relevant. In the PROUD-PV trial, two clinically significant abnormal values of ANA were observed in the 
ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm at two visits (week 22 and month 9). Starting with study week 12 inclusively (end 
of titration phase), one clinically significant abnormality was reported in TgAb in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm 
at each study visit excluding follow-up. One (week 20 and month 12) to two (screening and FU) clinically 
significant abnormalities were recorded for TPOAb in the HU arm. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Two cases of stroke were observed in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm during the (individual) titration phase 
compared to none in the HU arm. This raises concerns that both events occurred during the titration phase and 
thus, may probably indicate a higher risk from the longer dose titration phase for ropeginterferon-alfa-2b. The 
higher risks in the ropeginterferon –alfa 2b arm during the longer dose-titration due to thromboembolic/major 
cardiovascular events can be sufficiently controlled by phlebotomies (see RMP).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Besremi showed a clear cytoreductive effect in terms of CHR as absolute benefit based on a comparison to 
baseline. Significant increase of efficacy after more adequate exposure (12 months with plateau dose) was 
reported from CONTINUNATION-PV trial. The haematological response rates and clinical response rates 
increased with treatment duration and remain stable beyond 24 months in line with results reported for other 
IFNs. It is anticipated that response may further increase and can be maintained in up to 70.5 % as 
demonstrated from the interim results after 36 months of treatment (i.e. after 24 months treatment duration 
from the CONTINUATION-PV trial). Thus, a clinically relevant efficacy of Besremi in the applied target population 
is demonstrated.  
Assessment report  
EMA/11025/2019 
Page 111/113 
  
  
 
 
 
The toxicity profile observed with Besremi was considered acceptable. The general safety outcome in terms of 
TEAEs, ADRs, drug related SAEs, drug related deaths also is favourable to Besremi. The risk of cardiovascular 
and thromboembolic events during the initial treatment period, i.e. first 6 months, needs to be seen in the 
context of the treatment needs of the patient. Patients in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b arm were not treated with 
the maximum plateau dose until month 6. A potential higher risk for thromboembolic complications during the 
first 6 months cannot be excluded but adequate risk minimisation measures are in place (see RMP). In contrast 
to all other cytoreductive therapies used in PV, interferons are not genotoxic or carcinogenic.  
The absence of genotoxicity, carcinogenicity and leukogenic transformation potential is a benefit very relevant 
to patients considering the long duration of treatment needed, particularly in younger patients more concerned 
about life-long exposure and especially if in a reproductive age.   
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The important favourable effects identified and discussed above in principle outweigh the unfavourable effects. 
A clinically meaningful effect in terms of response rate has been established and even if formally one cannot 
exclude a 20% worse response rate compared to HU at 12 months, the loss of efficacy is not considered critical 
as phlebotomy can be used in the short term to compensate any lack of effect. The applicant has proposed 
adequate risk minimisation measures with respect to the impact of the slow dose titration needed and the 
thromboembolic complications in PROUD-PV. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The CHMP concluded that the overall B/R of Besremi in the treatment of polycythaemia vera without 
symptomatic splenomegaly is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Besremi is favourable in the following indication: 
Besremi is indicated as monotherapy in adults for the treatment of polycythaemia vera without symptomatic 
splenomegaly. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/11025/2019 
Page 112/113 
  
  
list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any 
subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product within 6 
months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP 
presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being 
received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important 
(pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the review of the available data, the CHMP considers that ropeginterferon alfa-2b is a new active 
substance as it differs significantly in properties with regard to safety and efficacy from interferon alpha-2b 
contained in medicinal product(s) previously authorised within the European Union due to differences in 
molecular structure, nature of the source material or manufacturing process.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Castleman’s disease, a lymphoproliferative disorder first described by Castleman and Towne 
(Castleman 1954), is a rare and only partially elucidated disease characterized by growth of 
lymphoid tissue (Bowne 1999). This syndrome is known by a variety of names, including giant 
lymph node hyperplasia, angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia, angiomatous lymphoid 
hamartoma, lymph nodal haematoma, and lymph node hyperplasia of Castleman (Greiner 2000). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/258608/2014 
Page 9/92 
 
  
  
Clinically, patients present with lymph node growth that is confined to a single location (unicentric 
Castleman’s disease) or occurs in multiple locations (MCD) (Gaba 1978; van Rhee 2010). Unicentric 
Castleman’s disease is most commonly asymptomatic whereas MCD, first described by Gaba in 
1978, displays a wide variety of clinical symptoms (Gaba 1978). MCD can occur in association with 
HIV and HHV-8 infection, but in the majority of patients, MCD occurs in the absence of these viral 
infections (Casper 2005; Dispenzieri 2012). Clinical symptoms of MCD may include fever, night 
sweats, fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly, palpable lymphadenopathy, 
peripheral neuropathy, extravascular volume overload (ie, edema, ascites, or effusions), 
documented bony sclerosis, anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, transaminitis, a high 
sedimentation rate, hypergammaglobulinemia, low albumin, elevated creatinine, and significant 
increases in IL-6 and acute-phase proteins such as CRP (Casper 2005; Dispenzieri 2008; van Rhee 
2010; Dispenzieri 2012). Sometimes MCD is associated with polyneuropathy, organomegaly, 
endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome (Dispenzieri 
2012).  
Although the precise incidence of MCD is not known, it has been estimated at less than 1 in 100,000 
(orphanet). A recent publication (Talat 2012) has reviewed 404 published cases of Castleman’s 
disease, of which only 126 were MCD. Different histologic subtypes of Castleman’s disease exist, 
based on the histologic architecture of the lymph node tissue: hyaline vascular, plasmacytic and 
mixed, in which features of both subtypes are present (Cronin 2009). The hyaline vascular type was 
originally thought to be localized and thus associated with unicentric Castleman’s disease, although 
in recent publications, a substantial number of subjects with MCD have distinct hyaline vascular 
characteristics of the disease (van Rhee 2010; Dispenzieri 2012). In MCD, the plasmacytic type 
tends to be more frequently reported (Dispenzieri 2012). 
Treatment goals include alleviation of debilitating symptoms that may be life-threatening and 
reduction of lymph node masses. 
There is no accepted standard of care for non-viral MCD and no known treatment consistently 
results in a reduction in tumour burden in MCD patients; therefore prognosis remains poor with fatal 
outcomes reported (Casper 2005; Dispenzieri 2008; Dispenzieri 2012).  
The underlying pathophysiology of Castleman’s disease is still only partially elucidated. Initially the 
condition was described as a “chronic nonspecific inflammatory process”. Overproduction of the 
cytokine IL-6, either native or virally encoded, has been hypothesized to play a central role in 
driving plasma cell proliferation and systemic manifestations (Casper 2005; van Rhee 2010). 
Siltuximab is a human-mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody that forms high affinity, stable 
complexes with soluble bioactive forms of human IL-6. Siltuximab prevents the binding of human 
IL-6 to both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors (IL-6R), thus inhibiting the formation of 
the hexameric signaling complex with gp130 on the cell surface. Interleukin-6 is a pleiotropic 
pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by a variety of cell types including T cells and B-cells, 
lymphocytes, monocytes and fibroblasts, as well as malignant cells. IL-6 has been shown to be 
involved in diverse normal physiologic processes such as induction of immunoglobulin secretion, 
initiation of hepatic acute phase protein synthesis, and stimulation of hematopoietic precursor cell 
proliferation and differentiation. Overproduction of IL-6, in chronic inflammatory diseases and 
malignancies has been linked to anaemia and cachexia and has been hypothesized to play a central 
role in driving plasma cell proliferation and systemic manifestations in patients with CD.

The Applicant applied for the indication: Sylvant is indicated for the treatment of patients with 
multicentric Castleman’s disease (MCD) who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative 
and human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8)-negative. 
The finally approved indication is the following: SYLVANT is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with multicentric Castleman’s disease (MCD) who are human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) negative and human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) negative. 
The recommended dose is 11 mg/kg given over 1 hour as an IV infusion administered every 3 
weeks until treatment failure. 
2.2.  Quality aspects  
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Siltuximab, the active substance of Sylvant, is a human/murine chimeric immunoglobulin G1κ 
(IgG1κ) monoclonal antibody against human interleukin-6 (hIL-6) produced in a Chinese Hamster 
Ovary (CHO) cell line. 
Siltuximab binds to IL-6, neutralizing its biological activity. IL-6, a proinflammatory cytokine 
produced by many different cell types and some tumor cells, acts by binding to the cell surface IL-6 
receptor. Siltuximab blocks the binding of IL-6 to the IL-6 cell surface receptor and thereby 
prevents initiation of downstream intracellular signaling by the receptor. By neutralizing 
endogenous IL-6, siltuximab interferes with IL-6 mediated regulation of acute phase proteins and 
cell differentiation. Overproduction of the cytokine (IL-6) has been hypothesized to play a central 
role in driving plasma cell proliferation and systemic manifestations in multicentric Castleman’s 
disease (MCD) patients. There is a strong rationale for evaluating siltuximab in MCD, because it is 
a potent and specific inhibitor of circulating IL-6. 
The siltuximab finished product is supplied as a sterile, single-use lyophilized dosage form for 
intravenous infusion (IV). The Finished product is supplied in a Type 1 glass vial with an elastomeric 
closure and an aluminum seal with a flip-off button. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Structural formula 
The intact molecule contains 1324 amino acid residues and is composed of 2 identical heavy chains 
(approximately 50 kDa each) and 2 identical light chains (approximately 24 kDa each). The heavy 
and light chains contain 449 and 213 amino acid residues, respectively. The chains are linked 
together via non-covalent heavy-heavy and heavy-light interactions, and also covalent 
heavy-heavy and heavy-light disulfide bonds. The glutamine residue at position 1 of the light chain 
and the glutamic acid residue at position 1 of the heavy chain constitute the N-termini of the 
secreted protein. The light chain N-terminal glutamine is cyclized to pyroglutamic acid. Both heavy 
chains are glycosylated at Asn-299. Heavy chain C-terminal lysine is depicted in this sequence 
however the typical distribution of species contains a majority (>90%) of variants without 
C-terminal lysine.

Description of the manufacturing process and process controls 
Manufacturing process  
Siltuximab active substance Final Bulk (FB) is manufactured in a 9-stage process. Briefly, the active 
substance is obtained by several purification steps (protein A, cation exchange and anion exchange 
chromatography) from the harvests of one or more CHO cell line bioreactor culture(s). The FB is 
stored frozen at -40 °C until further processing into the final lyophilized product. Specific and 
dedicated viral inactivation steps (low pH inactivation and nanofiltration) have been included in the 
production process. Overall, the active substance manufacturing process is considered adequately 
described. 
Stage 1: Preculture and expansion  
Each manufacturing run starts by thawing a vial of the Working Cell Bank, followed by a pre-culture 
and expansion phase. The cells are cultured in disposable culture bags until the viable cell density 
(VCD) and volume required for inoculation of the production bioreactors are obtained.  
Stage 2: Bioreactor production 
The second stage in the manufacturing process of siltuximab active substance is continuous cell 
culture in a production bioreactor. For harvest, cells are separated from the permeate via an 
alternating tangential flow (ATF) hollow fiber cell-retention device. Cell culture permeates 
(harvests) are collected from the bioreactor at different time points (early, middle and late stage of 
cultivation). 
Stage 3: Direct product capture (DPC) and low pH viral inactivation 
Harvests are filtered and purified through a protein A chromatography column. The eluate is 
incubated at low pH for viral inactivation. After pH re-adjustment, intermediates are stored frozen. 
This frozen material is named Direct Product Capture (DPC) and considered an intermediate.  
Stage 4: Thawing and pooling of DPC eluates 
Siltuximab direct product capture (DPC) eluates are thawed, pooled, and filtered. 
Stage 5: Cation exchange chromatography 
Pooled siltuximab DPC eluates are purified by cation exchange chromatography. Stage 5 is 
designed to remove aggregates, residual protein A, host cell protein, and other impurities from the 
siltuximab product.  
Stage 6: Anion exchange chromatography 
Siltuximab active substance is further purified by an anion exchange chromatography. The step is 
designed to separate the active substance from DNA, other impurities, and viruses (if present). 
Stage 7: Virus removal filtration  
Siltuximab purified by anion exchange chromatography is filtered through a virus removal filter.  
Stage 8: Concentration and diafiltration 
Siltuximab active substance is concentrated and diafiltered to add formulation excipients (except 
for polysorbate 80 added in Stage 9) and to remove in-process buffer salts. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/258608/2014 
Page 12/92 
 
 
  
  
Stage 9: Preparation of formulated bulk  
Polysorbate 80 (PS 80) is added to the pre-formulated bulk (PFB) to obtain the active substance 
formulated bulk (FB). The FB is filtered into polycarbonate containers for frozen storage. 
As requested the applicant provided acceptable information on the Normal Operating ranges (NOR) 
and Proven Acceptable Ranges (PAR) of the active substance manufacturing process. Actions taken 
when process excursions beyond the NOR and PAR occur have been described. 
Pooling of DPC batches at stage 4 of the actives substance manufacturing process 
At D120 a major objection was raised concerning the adequacy of the controls of the proposed 
pooling strategy and how these relate to the pooling strategy employed to manufacture of material 
used in the pivotal clinical study. It was concluded that this issue will potentially impact the safety 
and efficacy of the proposed commercial product since it was unclear if commercial and clinical 
materials were equivalent. To address this concern, the applicant was requested to justify how the 
proposed commercial material will be consistently equivalent to the material used in the pivotal 
clinical study considering the pooling strategy adopted for the clinical material compared with that 
proposed for commercial material. Furthermore, the applicant was requested to unequivocally 
define the pooling strategy, to describe the batch size of each DPC pool completed at stage 4, to set 
specifications at stage 3 and 4 of the active substance manufacturing process, to provide a full 
definition of the normal operating ranges (NOR) employed in the drug substance manufacturing 
process and to describe the actions taken when process excursions beyond the NOR and the proven 
acceptable ranges (PAR) occur. The applicant sufficiently resolved this major objection. 
Control of starting materials 
Sufficient information on raw materials used in the active substance manufacturing process has 
been submitted. Compendial raw materials are tested in accordance with the corresponding 
monograph, while specifications (including test methods) for non-compendial raw materials are 
presented.  
Information provided on the construction of the expression plasmid with respect to sourcing, 
selection and cloning of the coding sequences is satisfactory. The description incorporates the 
history of the expression construct used in earlier development via the murine Sp2/0 cell line.  
The current CHO cell line, C1612A, was used to produce product for Phase 3 clinical trials and will be 
used to produce commercial product. Sufficient information has been provided regarding the 
characteristics of the plasmid and the producer cell line. 
A two tiered cell banking system is used and sufficient information is provided regarding testing of 
master cell bank (MCB) and working cell bank (WCB) and release of future WCBs. Genetic stability 
of the expression construct in the MCB, WCB and end of production cells (EOPC) has been 
demonstrated. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Manufacturing steps are controlled by critical process parameters (CPPs) and In-Process Controls 
(IPCS).

Process validation 
The consistency of the manufacturing process has been adequately evaluated using multiple 
strategies including: characterisation of the harvest material from four consecutive fermentation 
processes; manufacturing and evaluation of three consecutive active substance FB batches whilst 
monitoring relevant performance parameters; employing small scale design of experiments using 
qualified models of the respective unit operation to establish process robustness; independent 
chromatography resin lifetime evaluation; small scale validation of reprocessing at specified 
process stages; validation of process intermediates hold times and removal of impurities. It is 
recommended that the applicant verify the validated column lifetimes during commercial scale 
production.   
Manufacturing process development 
Manufacturing changes and comparability 
The commercial active substance manufacturing process was developed in parallel with the clinical 
development program. A comparability study has been carried out demonstrating that changes 
made during pharmaceutical development did not have a significant influence on the quality of the 
product.  
Characterisation 
The siltuximab active substance has been sufficiently characterised by physicochemical and 
biological state-of-the-art methods revealing that the active substance has the expected structure 
of a human IgG1-type antibody. The analytical results are consistent with the proposed structure. 
Furthermore, heterogeneity of the active substance was adequately characterised by analysing size 
and charge variants, glycosylation and other product-related substances and impurities. Biological 
characterization of siltuximab indicates that this antibody has the ability to bind and neutralize IL-6 
with high affinity and to specifically bind to FcγRI and FcRn as expected of an IgG1. In summary, 
characterization is considered appropriate for this type of molecule. 
Specification 
The release specification for siltuximab active substance include tests for identity, purity, charge 
heterogeneity, potency, oligosaccharide profile, protein concentration, safety (endotoxin, 
bioburden), and physical characteristics (pH, color of solution). Overall, active substance 
specifications are considered adequately set and justified after revision during the evaluation 
procedure and when accounting for the recommendations for further quality development.  
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods have been adequately described and validated.  
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis is based on data from Phase III clinical batches, active substance formulated bulk 
batches and further batches manufactured post validation.  All batches show consistent 
performance within the proposed specifications.

Reference standards 
The same reference standards are used for control of the active substance FB and the finished 
product. The history of the reference standards, the Primary Reference Material (PRM) and the 
Working Reference Material (WRM), and the strategy for the qualification of future reference 
batches was presented.  
Container closure 
The information presented for the Container and Closure system is considered appropriate. The 
container closure system is comprised of a polycarbonate bottle and a polypropylene screw closure 
with a silicone liner and complies with the requirements of regulation EU 10/2011 and Ph.Eur 
monograph 3.1.9, respectively. 
Stability 
Sufficient stability data have been presented in support of the claimed shelf-life of the intermediate 
DCP eluate (stage 3), and the active substance FB. The stability study at real-time conditions is still 
on-going and the applicant has committed to finalize the study and to report any 
out-of-specifications result. This is acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description and composition of finished product 
The finished product, in its two presentations (100 and 400 mg/vial), is well described. The finished 
product is presented as a sterile, single-use lyophilized dosage form for intravenous infusion (IV). 
The container is a Type 1 glass vial with an elastomeric closure and an aluminum seal with a flip-off 
button. 
The finished product is reconstituted with 5.2 mL (for the 100 mg) or 20 mL (for the 400 mg) of 
sterile WFI prior to use. 
Pharmaceutical Development 
Formulation development 
In summary, the pharmaceutical development of the siltuximab finished product has been 
adequately described. All excipients used in siltuximab finished product are incorporated during 
manufacture of the active substance FB. No additional excipients are included during DP 
manufacture. The excipients were selected based on formulation development studies described in 
detail. The choice and level of excipients were determined by evaluating the ability of each excipient 
to maximize the stability of siltuximab against chemical and physical stresses. 
Process development 
During its development, the siltuximab finished product manufacture underwent several process 
changes, some of them were in parallel with changes in the manufacturing process of the active 
substance. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/258608/2014 
Page 15/92 
 
  
  
Comparability studies have been undertaken with siltuximab finished product to show it is 
comparable across the different changes in the manufacture process. It is considered that 
comparability has been sufficiently demonstrated. 
Adventitious agents 
The safety of siltuximab with regard to adventitious agents is assured through the design and 
control of the manufacturing process and raw materials. Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy 
(TSE) infectivity control is assured by exclusion of animal-derived raw materials from the 
production process and the cell bank preparation. No animal-derived materials have been used to 
prepare the Master Cell Bank or Working Cell Banks. Raw material controls and in-process testing 
for virus minimize the risk of contamination by adventitious agents. Clearance studies provide 
assurance that potential adventitious agents will be removed or inactivated by the manufacturing 
process. Non-infectious, retrovirus-like particles (RVLP) typical of a CHO cell line are produced by 
the C1612A cell line and are considered in the virus safety evaluation. 
Viral clearance is achieved through viral inactivation (low pH treatment), physical removal of virus 
by nanofiltration and two orthogonal chromatographic steps. The four viral clearance steps in the 
siltuximab process are: Protein A chromatography (Stage 3), low pH viral inactivation (also Stage 
3), anion exchange chromatography (Stage 6) and virus removal filtration (Stage 7). Of these, low 
pH viral inactivation and virus removal filtration are dedicated viral clearance steps. The studies 
provided are considered satisfactory. 
Manufacture of the finished product 
Batch Release: 
Janssen Biologics B.V. 
Einsteinweg 101 
2333 CB Leiden 
The Netherlands 
Manufacturing process, process controls and validation 
The commercial manufacturing process at the Cilag AG facilities in Schaffhausen (Switzerland) is 
well described and controlled, having all the steps and hold times validated. Briefly, the 
manufacturing process of finished product consists of the thawing of siltuximab active substance 
formulated bulk (FB), pooling and mixing to produce a homogeneous FB, pre-filtration of the FB to 
reduce the bioburden, in-line sterile filtration, and aseptic filling. Following aseptic filling, the vials 
are partially stoppered, and loaded into the lyophilizer(s). Upon completion of lyophilization, all 
vials are fully stoppered, unloaded and capped. Afterwards, the siltuximab finished product vials are 
optically inspected, secondary packaged and then stored at 2-8 °C. 
Control of excipients 
All excipients comply with the requirements in their respective pharmacopoeial monographs (Ph 
Eur, USP/NF or JP). No excipients of human or animal origin are used in the manufacture of the 
finished product.

Product specification 
Finished product release and stability specifications are acceptable for both formulations (100 
mg/vial and 400 mg/vial). The release specification for siltuximab finished product includes general 
tests (appearance, residual moisture, color of solution, osmolality, particulate matter, pH, 
reconstitution time, turbidity, uniformity of dosage), as well as controls for safety (endotoxin, 
sterility), purity, charge heterogeneity, identity, protein concentration and potency.  
Analytical methods 
Analytical methods, including non pharmacopoeial tests, are described in sufficient detail.  
Validation of analytical methods, performed according ICH Q2(R1), is considered adequate. 
Reference standard 
The same reference standards are used for control of active substance formulated bulk and finished 
product (see above). 
Batch data 
The presented batch data comply with the limits of the proposed finished product specification. 
Batch data were submitted for validation batches of the 100mg and 400mg finished product 
manufactured in the commercial facility. Data for further  clinical phase III batches are also 
provided in support.  
Container closure system 
The information presented on the container closure system is considered appropriate.  
The container closure system used for the final lyophilized finished product (100 mg/vial) is an 8R 
(8mL) Type I borosilicate clear glass vial, while the container for the 400 mg/vial finished product is 
a 30 mL Type I borosilicate clear glass. Both vials are closed with a fluoropolymer coated 20mm 
lyophilization-type stopper and a 20mm aluminum seal with a flip-off button made of polypropylene 
and containing a lacquered aluminum ferrule. The vials are tested for hydrolytic resistance, arsenic 
content, microbiological purity and bacterial endotoxins according to current Ph. Eur. and USP. The 
stoppers comply with Ph. Eur. and/or USP. 
Stability of the product 
The proposed finished product shelf life and storage conditions are supported by the provided 
stability data.  Storage of both strengths is recommended at a temperature of 2-8 °C and protected 
from light. The clinical and commercial instructions for use require that the reconstituted finished 
product be added to the infusion bag no more than 2 hours after reconstitution and administered 
within six (6) hours. 
The post-approval stability protocol and stability commitment are considered acceptable.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
In summary, the information provided in the application demonstrates consistent batch-to-batch 
production of Sylvant achieving a defined quality for the active substance and the finished product. 
The fermentation, recovery and purification of the active substance, siltuximab, are adequately 
controlled and validated. Appropriate active substance specifications have been set. The active 
substance has been well characterised using state-of the-art methods with regard to its 
physicochemical and biological characteristics. The manufacturing process of the finished product 
has been described and validated in sufficient detail. The quality of the finished product is controlled 
by adequate test methods and specifications. The data presented support the shelf-life proposed for 
active substance and finished product. Two dedicated virus inactivation/removal steps are included 
in the active substance manufacturing process. No excipients of human or animal origin are used in 
the product manufacture. Therefore there is no risk of contamination with viral or TSE agents. A 
number of recommendations for future quality development are given (see 2.2.6). 
During the evaluation of the quality dossier a major objection was raised concerning the proposed 
commercial pooling strategy at stage 4 of the active substance manufacturing process and the 
resulting potential implications for the comparability of clinical trial material with future commercial 
batches. With the responses the major objection was resolved: The applicant submitted an 
acceptable pooling strategy; addressed the question on setting specifications for critical steps and 
intermediates satisfactorily; introduced acceptable controls and specifications for an additional 
control parameter for the DPC pool at stage 4 and for the active substance formulated bulk and 
committed to follow the recommendations for further quality development of the product. 
Furthermore, an acceptable justification was given to show how the proposed commercial material 
will be consistently equivalent to the material used in the pivotal clinical study considering the 
pooling strategy adopted for the clinical material compared with that proposed for commercial 
material.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
The quality aspects of this dossier are sufficiently described. From the quality point of view, a 
positive opinion can be given since the quality issues have been solved, including the major 
objection.  A number of commitments made by the applicant during the procedure have been drawn 
up as recommendations (see section 2.2.6). The applicant agreed to address and implement these 
recommendations in the on-going development of the product. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommended future quality developments.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The nonclinical program for siltuximab was conducted in accordance with the International 
Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) S6 guidelines. The pivotal toxicology studies and the majority 
of the safety pharmacology studies were conducted in accordance with current regulatory 
requirements and in compliance with the principles of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP). In vivo 
studies were performed in mouse and monkey. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Siltuximab (also referred to as CNTO 328 or cCLB8) is a chimeric (murine-human) immunoglobulin 
G (IgG1 κ) monoclonal antibody (mAb).  In order to characterise the binding of chimeric anti hIL-6 
mAb, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed, which showed that cCLB8 
binds to rhIL-6 (200 ng/mL) in a concentration dependent manner with an EC50 of 4 ng/mL. 
The ability of siltuximab to block the interaction of IL-6 with its receptor was tested in a fluorescent 
bead based assay. A total of 21 ng/mL (147 pM) of siltuximab displaced 50% of the maximum 
bound biotin-hIL-6 (at 20 ng/mL) to hsIL-6R-coated beads. 
Additional in vitro studies showed that siltuximab also neutralized IL-6-mediated responses 
including cell proliferation, cell survival, intracellular signalling (increase of the anti-apoptotic 
protein Mcl-1 levels, phosphorilation of the activator of transcription STAT-3) and production of 
acute phase and IgM proteins. The inhibition of cell proliferation was shown on murine 
plasmacytoma 7TD1 (EC50=4.6-13.48 ng/ml; 30.6-88 pM), U266 myeloma and non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) A549, H226 and H358 cell lines. In studies using the LNCaP-IL-6+ prostate cancer 
cell line, which expresses autocrine IL-6, exposure to CNTO 328 at 10 µg/mL, caused a significant 
increase in apoptosis, which was associated to some degree with down regulation of IL-6-mediated 
intracellular signalling pathways including the anti-apoptotic protein, Mcl-1 and signal transducers 
and activators of transcription (STAT)-3 phosphorylation. Siltuximab did not affect the growth of 
LNCaP-IL-6- cells, which do not produce autocrine IL-6. The inhibition of STAT-3 phosphorilation 
was proved in CD3+ population of mononuclear cells from human whole blood from healthy donors. 
Siltuximab was also able to inhibit the production of acute phase protein serum amyloid A (SAA) by 
HepG2 human hepatoma cells (IC50=34.43 ng/ml, 239 pM). In a similar study using the human 
Burkitt’s B-lymphoma line SKW6.4, the production of immunoglobulin M (IgM) protein in response 
to rIL-6 was blocked by cCLB8 at ≥100 ng/mL. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/258608/2014

To examine species cross-reactivity, a bioassay was used to determine the ability of siltuximab 
(CNTO 328) to inhibit IL-6 induced 7TD1 cell proliferation from different species.  Tumour cells were 
stimulated with IL-6, which was either in the form of recombinant protein (human, rat, or mouse 
IL-6), or conditioned media from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from 
chimpanzee, baboon, pigtailed macaque, cynomolgus monkey, cotton-top tamarin, marmoset, 
guinea pig, rhesus monkey, mini-pig or dog.  Cell proliferation was evaluated via ATPLite assay. 
Tumour cell proliferation was induced by IL-6 or conditioned media from various species.  CNTO 328 
completely blocked proliferation stimulated by hIL-6 or conditioned media from chimpanzee, 
baboon, pigtailed macaque, cynomolgus monkey, cotton-top tamarin, marmoset, and rhesus 
monkey, but not by rat, and mouse IL-6 or conditioned media from guinea pig, mini-pig or dog. 
Since siltuximab did not demonstrate reactivity against mouse IL-6 (mIL-6), an alternative 
anti-mouse IL-6 mAb, called CNTO 345, was developed to be used as a surrogate anti-mouse IL-6 
mAb in fertility and tumor immune surveillance studies. The ka, kd and KD constants for CNTO 345 
are similar to that observed for CNTO 328 and the IC50 for the anti-mouse IL-6 mAb was higher 
than that observed for the proposed product. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The in vivo pharmacologic effects of siltuximab were studied in mice bearing hIL-6-producing 
tumours. Neutralization of IL-6 by a single dose of mCNTO 328 reduced tumour growth by 
approximately 50% in the RC-8 model (Weissglas et al, 1997).  In a second study, weekly 
intraperitoneal (IP) administration of mCNTO 328 caused regression of established human prostate 
cancer xenografts (PC3 cell line) in nude mice (Smith and Keller, 2001).  The activity of mCNTO 328 
was also tested in a human lymphoma model generated by xenotransplantation of severe combined 
immunodeficiency (SCID) mice with human peripheral blood leukocytes from individuals with prior 
contact with Epstein-Barr virus (Mauray et al, 2000).  Treatment with mCNTO 328 decreased 
tumour incidence from 62% to 27% (n=13-14/ group). In a separate study, the activity of the 
chimeric antibody CNTO 328 was also studied in solid tumour models in mice. Siltuximab treatment 
reduced growth of this xenograft and significant differences in mean tumour volume were observed 
at Day 22 and Day 25. In a study of mice bearing H460 human lung tumour xenografts, 
twice-weekly dosing with CNTO 328 (25 mg/kg) caused a reduction in tumour volume and a delay 
in time to tumour endpoint by 7.6 days compared to PBS control.   
The effects of siltuximab in combination with other therapeutic regimens were also characterized in 
in vitro studies and in a variety of xenograft tumor models in mice. These agents included 
dexamethasone, melphalan, docetaxel, mitoxantrone, or androgen ablation (castration) in models 
of prostate cancer, erlotinib in lung cancer models, and bortezomib in an IL-6-sensitive human 
myeloma model. Although siltuximab administered in combination with other treatment regimens 
did not adversely affect the efficacy, some combinations (docetaxel in model of metastasis, 
mitoxantrone in a model of prostate cancer, androgen ablation in models of androgen-sensitive 
prostate cancer and erlotinib in lung cancer models) did not provide a therapeutic advantage for the 
treatment of tumours. Among agents tested in combination with siltuximab, only dexamethasone 
and bortezomib are used in MCD and siltuximab enhanced the efficacy of both drugs in 
monotherapy. Combination studies provided limited data about the tolerance of the combinations 
(with respect to effects on body weight alterations, mortality and clinical signs for e.g.). Only an 
increase of survival was reported in a prostate cancer mice model induced by PC3 cells following 
treatment with siltuximab and docetaxel.

Safety pharmacology programme 
No studies were submitted. Safety pharmacology endpoints were incorporated into the design of 
several in vivo toxicology studies (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Potential effects on the cardiovascular system were evaluated in the 3- and 6-month repeat-dose 
toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys via the evaluation of electrocardiograms (ECGs) and by 
the measurement of blood pressure, heart rate (HR) and capillary refill times; during the ECG 
recordings, the PR-interval, QRS duration, QT- and/or QTc-interval, and heart rate were 
determined and the data interpreted by a board certified veterinary cardiologist. Potential effects on 
the respiratory system were evaluated via the measurement of the respiratory rate during 
veterinary physical examinations as well as at additional protocol-specified study intervals. 
Potential effects on the Central Nervous System (CNS) were evaluated by daily clinical cage side 
observations and by measurement of rectal temperature. 
All ECGs were normal in siltuximab-dosed animals in the 3 and 6-month toxicology studies, with the 
exception of isolated ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) seen in 2 monkeys administered 46 
mg/kg, and arterial premature complexes (APCs) seen at in 1 male administered 9.2 mg/kg. These 
findings were also seen during the predose period and in control group animals, and there was no 
indication of a dosage-related incidence.  
No findings attributable to siltuximab administration were noted during physical examinations. In 
the 3-month study of siltuximab alone, a minimally detectable (Grade I/VI) systolic murmur was 
identified in all groups, including controls, on Day 24/25. A relationship to dose was not seen and 
the finding is occasionally documented in normal cynomolgus monkeys. Additionally, as evidenced 
by the ECG evaluations, the parenchyma and valve of the heart were functional in these animals. 
Indirect blood pressure, respiratory rate, heart rate, rectal temperature, and capillary refill time 
were noted to exhibit minimal fluctuations over the course of the 3- and 6-month repeat-dose 
toxicology studies. The changes, however, were either within the normal range for cynomolgus 
monkeys and a clear dose response could not be established. 
No siltuximab-related changes in behaviour were recorded during the collection of clinical 
observations in the 3- and 6-month toxicology studies. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Potential interactions between the pharmacological effects of siltuximab in combination with a 
variety of anti-cancer therapeutics have been evaluated. In in vitro pharmacology studies using 
human myeloma cells, administration of siltuximab did not adversely affect the efficacy of 
bortezomib, dexamethasone or melphalan. In in vivo pharmacology studies in mice, administration 
of siltuximab did not adversely affect the efficacy of docetaxel, mitoxantrone, erlotinib, or 
bortezomib. In a toxicology study conducted in cynomolgus monkeys, siltuximab did not enhance 
the toxicity induced by IL-2.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The majority of the pharmacokinetics data were generated as part of the toxicology studies to 
assess toxicokinetic (TK) exposure to siltuximab or to the anti-mouse IL-6 specific mAb CNTO 
345.The TK profile and immunogenicity of siltuximab was evaluated in 3 GLP IV repeat-dose 
toxicology studies in male and female cynomolgus monkeys: a 3-month study followed by a 
1-month recovery period (T-2002-007), a 3-month study in which siltuximab was administered in 
combination with interleukin-2 (IL-2) treatment and followed by a 1-month recovery period 
(T-2002-010), and a 6-month study followed by a 3-month recovery period (T-2003-010). 
Two PK studies were performed with siltuximab in cynomolgus monkeys after administration of IV 
single-doses. The first one (P-2002-002) conducted in order to characterize the PK profile of 
siltuximab in this species and the second one (P-2004-061) was conducted to compare the PK 
profile of siltuximab produced from the original Sp2/0 cell line 175A and the Sp2/0 subclone cell line 
175H. The PK profile of the surrogate rodent antibody, CNTO 345 (an anti-mouse IL-6 mAb) 
administered Q1W or B1W via the IV or SC dose route was studied in 1-month toxicology study 
(T-2009-025). Traditional absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion studies were not 
conducted by the applicant.  
Following a single IV dose (1.84, 9.2, and 46 mg/kg) of CNTO 328 to the cynomolgus monkey 
(P-2002-002), exposure to siltuximab as measured by Cmax and AUC0-tz appeared to increase in 
a slightly greater than dose proportional manner; over the tested dose range of 1.84 to 46 mg/kg, 
a 5-fold increase in dose from 1.84 to 9.2 mg/kg and from 9.2 to 46 mg/kg resulted in a 6.4 and 
8-fold increase in Cmax and a 5.86 and 6.98 fold increase in AUC0-tz, respectively. 
Following once weekly repeated IV dosing (once a week [Q1W]; 9.2 and 46 mg/kg) for 6 months in 
the monkey ( T-2003-010), a 5-fold increase in dose from 9.2 to 46 mg/kg resulted in a 3.31- 4.56 
fold increase in AUC and in a 3.49-5.54 fold increase in Cmax. Moderate accumulation of siltuximab 
in serum was observed after administration of multiple doses of 9.2 or 46 mg/kg siltuximab. Drug 
accumulation ratios calculated following administration of the last dose were 7.33 and 4.91 for the 
9.2 and 46 mg/kg dose groups, respectively. No apparent gender-related differences in TK 
parameters were observed. 
The clearance (mean±SD) after a single dose was 5.76±1.11, 4.97±NA, and 2.93±NA mL/day/kg 
for the 1.84, 9.2, and 46 mg/kg dose groups. After 6 months of treatment the clearance at steady 
state (CLss) decreased to 1.11±0.36 and 2.37±0.51 mL/day/kg at 9.2 and 46 mg/kg, respectively. 
The mean volume of distribution of siltuximab in cynomolgus monkeys ranged from 62.98±NA to 
143.60±4.51 mL/kg following single IV administration, and from 17.82±5.01 and 43.52±19.86 
mL/kg following Q1W repeated IV dosing for 6 months.  
Animals treated weekly with siltuximab at doses of 9.2 or 46 mg/kg for three months showed 
detectable concentrations of siltuximab in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Following repeated 
administration to the monkey once a week (3 month study), siltuximab was shown to distribute to 
the CSF where levels ranged from 0.52 to 3.42 at the maximum dose of 46 mg/kg/day.  A study in 
cynomolgus monkeys also showed that siltuximab crosses the placenta, whereby maternal/fetal 
ratios of 0.82 to 1.07 were observed following repeated administration at 4.6 and 9.6 mg/kg/day.  
The levels of siltuximab in the CSF and the fetus increased in a dose-dependent manner. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/258608/2014 
Page 22/92 
 
  
  
Data from an IV (Q1W) repeat-dose embryofetal study in pregnant monkeys revealed that 
siltuximab distributes to the fetus during gestation, with apparent fetal/maternal distribution ratios 
of 0.82 and 1.07 at doses of 9.2 and 46 mg/kg.   
There was no difference in the PK profiles of the test materials produced by 175A and 175H cell lines 
in monkeys. 
Based on the results of the T-2009-025 study, CNTO 345 was absorbed with a tmax of 1 to 3 days 
after SC. Following the dosage regimen selected for toxicity studies in mice (Q1W, via SC), mean 
Cmax and AUC values increased in a dose-proportional manner, with an estimated 2.2- to 3.1-fold 
accumulation in mean serum concentrations across the tested dose level of 40 and 100 mg/kg.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
No studies were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Repeat dose toxicity 
The repeat-dose toxicity of siltuximab was evaluated following once a week (q1w) IV 2-hour 
infusion of 9.2 and 46 mg/kg doses of siltuximab in 3- and 6-month studies (Study T-2002-007 and 
T-2003-010). An additional 3-month study (Study T-2002-010) in cynomolgus monkeys in which 
animals were given siltuximab treatment and IL-2 therapy was designed to support clinical trials in 
oncology patients receiving concomitant IL-2 and siltuximab treatment.  All studies included a 
recovery period in order to evaluate reversibility, persistence, and/or the delayed occurrence of any 
potential adverse effects.  In addition to the standard toxicological endpoints, effects on the 
immune system were evaluated in the 3- and 6-month studies with siltuximab by 
immunophenotyping circulating peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) subsets, measuring primary 
T-cell dependent antibody responses (TDAR) after an intramuscular (IM) injection with Keyhole 
Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH) in Incomplete Freund’s Adjuvant (IFA), and by performing 
histopathology and immunohistopathology examinations of the lymphoid organs with 
immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for B- (CD20+) and T-cells (CD3+).

Weekly IV infusions of 9.2 and 46 mg/kg doses of siltuximab were well tolerated by cynomolgus 
monkeys, and treatment with siltuximab had no effect on IL-2 toxicity, with similar findings being 
noted between groups administered IL-2 therapy with or without siltuximab treatment. No 
siltuximab-related signs of toxicity or mortality were observed, and no treatment-related effects 
were noted on safety pharmacology parameters. In the 6-month study, periodic observations of 
skin erythema seen in the shoulder region of two 46 mg/kg-dosed females, and observations of dry 
flaky skin seen in 1 of the animals correlated with histopathologic findings of minimal 
hyperkeratosis.  One female at 46 mg/kg exhibited moderate facial swelling during the Day 1 
infusion that resolved following the completion of dosing, and did not occur again during the course 
of the study. These observations were considered possibly related to siltuximab administration, 
although a definitive relationship was not established. In the 3-month study with siltuximab, 
immunophenotyping of PBL subsets revealed no effects of treatment on memory T-lymphoctes, 
natural killer (NK)-cells, and monocytes. Increases in B-lymphocytes, total lymphocytes, 
T-lymphocytes, T-helper lymphocytes, T-cytotoxic/suppressor lymphocytes, and naïve 
T-lymphocytes, seen only on Day 2, were considered attributed to siltuximab administration.  In the 
3- and 6-month toxicology studies, IM immunization with the T-cell dependent neoantigen, KLH 
resulted in a robust humoral response (anti-KLH IgM and IgG response) in control animals.  
Siltuximab caused a slight reduction in the anti-KLH antibody titers seen at various time points 
between 1- and 3-months in the siltuximab treated animals relative to the controls.   However, even 
in the presence of siltuximab all animals were still able to generate a robust anti-KLH antibody 
response.  Histopathologic examination of stained lymphoid tissues showed no change in the 
number and distribution of T and B cells of animals administered siltuximab; however, the size of 
the germinal centers in the spleens was decreased in some animals at the high dose of 46 mg/kg 
after dosing for 1-month (3 animals) and 3-months (1 animal); the finding was not observed after 
6-months of dosing.  
An anti-siltuximab antibody response was detected in one female at 9.2 mg/kg from the 3-month 
study with siltuximab, and in one male at 9.2 mg/kg from the 3-month combination study with 
siltuximab and IL-2. With the exception of these 2 animals, toxicokinetic (TK) analysis confirmed 
extensive systemic exposure in monkeys administered siltuximab, which was not influenced by IL-2 
administration. In the 6-month chronic toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys, the mean ± SD 
Cmax value noted after administration of the last IV q1w dose of 46 mg/kg (5331.73 ± 1198.34 
μg/mL) was approximately 20-fold higher than the mean ± SD Cmax value of siltuximab obtained 
after the administration of IV doses of 11 mg/kg administered once every 3-weeks to cancer 
patients (273.3 ± 81.2 μg/mL;), and the mean ± SD AUC0-t in monkeys (20264.11 ± 4435.72 
μg·day/mL) was approximately 7-fold higher than the mean ± SD AUC0-t value (2800.9 ± 1086.2 
μg·day/mL) in cancer patients. Antibodies to siltuximab were not detected in the sera of any 
animals during the 6-month study.

Reproduction Toxicity 
The potential developmental and reproductive toxicity of siltuximab was investigated in an 
embryofetal development study in cynomolgus monkeys (T-205-036).  Supportive fertility studies 
in male (Study T-2010-033) and female (Study T-2010-032) mice were conducted using the rat 
IgG1 isotype anti-mouse IL-6 mAb CNTO 345.  Supplemental information has also been provided on 
the effects seen in a pre and post-natal development study following treatment with the anti-IL-6 
mAb CNTO 136 (T-2010-018). 
In the embryofetal development study (T-205-036), cynomolgus monkeys that were confirmed 
pregnant via ultrasound examination were administered weekly IV doses of 9.2 and 46 mg/kg 
siltuximab during the pregnancy period (GD 20-118), including the period of organogenesis (from 
GD 20-50). Treatment with siltuximab produced no siltuximab treatment-related abortions or 
maternal or fetal toxicities, and no siltuximab-related immunoreactions were observed in fetuses. 
Based on these findings, the NOAEL for pregnant cynomolgus monkeys and their fetuses was 46 
mg/kg; at this dose, siltuximab was approximately evenly distributed in maternal and fetal serum 
(dams: 727.11 ± 261.54 µg/mL; 725.68 ± 254.50 µg/mL). 
In the male fertility study (Study T-2010-033), male mice were administered q1w SC doses of 
CNTO 345 at 40 or 100 mg/kg 4 weeks prior to and during mating with untreated females, 
continuing up to the day before scheduled necropsy (7 weeks). There were no effects on mating and 
fertility of the male mice, nor of caesarean sectioning (C-section) and litter parameters of female 
mice evaluated at mid gestation (Gestation Day (GD) 13). Based on these findings, the paternal and 
male reproductive no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for CNTO 345 is 100 mg/kg.  At this 
dose, the mean serum concentration of CNTO 345 observed after the last dose confirmed that male 
mice had continuous systemic exposure to CNTO 345 during the study.   
In the female fertility study(Study T-2010-032), CNTO 345 was administered to female mice as SC 
doses of 40 and 100 mg/kg q1w for 15 days before cohabitation, through cohabitation with 
untreated male mice (maximum 14 days), and on presumed GDs 0 and 6. C-sections were 
conducted on GD 13.  The maternal NOAEL is 100 mg/kg, as no adverse effects were seen in dams; 
the NOAEL for female reproductive function was also considered to be 100 mg/kg, as no effects 
were seen on mating and fertility, or on C-sectioning and litter parameters evaluated at 
mid-gestation (GD 13). The mean serum concentrations of CNTO 345 obtained after administration 
of the last dose of 100 mg/kg confirmed that female mice had continuous systemic exposure to 
CNTO 345 following repeated q1w SC administration for 7 weeks.

In the embryofetal pre and post natal study (T-2010-018), pregnant cynomolgus monkeys were 
given weekly IV doses of 10 or 50 mg/kg CNTO 136 from early organogenesis (GD 20) to natural 
delivery (GD 167). No maternal toxicity was seen, and no adverse CNTO 136-related effects on 
embryo-fetal loss or on immunophenotyping of PBLs were observed in dams. Two dams died during 
the study; one 10 mg/kg dam was euthanized due to excessive bleeding caused by a retention of 
the placenta (GD 161/LD 0), and a 50 mg/kg-dosed dam found aborting on GD 131 died due to 
extensive blood loss and difficulties passing the fetus. These maternal deaths were not considered 
related to CNTO 136 treatment because they are related to complications at birth that occur on 
occasion in monkeys. No birth defects or adverse effects on growth or functional development were 
observed in infants. No adverse effects were observed on the development of the immune system, 
on infant humoral responses to KLH, or on lymphoid tissues. Based on these results, the NOAEL for 
CNTO 136 in both the dams and infants is considered to be 50 mg/kg. Systemic exposure was 
sustained in dams throughout the dosing period (GD 20 to delivery); at the NOAEL, Cmax was 
1059.18 and 1467.37 μg/mL on GDs 20 and 139, respectively. Concentrations of CNTO 136 in 
breast milk were below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) on LDs 30 and 75, indicating minimal 
trans mammary excretion. 
Toxicokinetic data 
The majority of the pharmacokinetics data were generated as part of the toxicology studies to 
assess toxicokinetic (TK) exposure to siltuximab or to the anti-mouse IL-6 specific mAb CNTO 345 
(see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Local Tolerance  
No studies were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Other toxicity studies 
The antigenicity of siltuximab (antibodies to siltuximab) was evaluated in support of PK and 
toxicology studies. This was done by testing for anti-siltuximab antibodies in single-dose PK studies 
and in repeat-dose toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys following q1w IV administration. 
Animals receiving the lowest dose of siltuximab had the earliest onset of antibodies to siltuximab 
and exhibited the highest antibody titers, which subsided as dose increased and after repeated 
administration, so that anti-siltuximab antibodies were generally not detected at the highest dose 
studied. 
Siltuximab is intended to modulate immune function for therapeutic purposes, and therefore 
evaluations of immunotoxicity were incorporated into the repeat-dose toxicology studies in 
monkeys. 
In-vivo mechanistic studies in murine models of tumour immune surveillance were conducted to 
assess the tumorgenicity potential of CNTO 345. Contrary effects of CNTO 345 on metastasis have 
been observed in two studies and the mechanism leading to the tumoral or antitumoral activity are 
unknown. The relevance of the findings to humans is undetermined but the weight of evidence 
approach used to determine the carcinogenic risk of siltuximab does not indicate a risk for humans.  
Three in vitro tissue cross-reactivity studies which performed with biotinylated siltuximab and 
select tissue sections obtained from normal humans and normal (naive) or siltuximab-treated 
monkeys showed no unexpected tissue binding to siltuximab.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No environmental risk assessment was submitted. In accordance with the Guideline on the 
environmental risk assessment (ERA) of medicinal products for human use 
[EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00], peptides and proteins are excluded from the need for an 
environmental risk assessment.  Therefore, an ERA for siltuximab is not required. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Siltuximab is a chimeric (murine-human) IgG1 monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to and 
neutralizes human IL-6 with high affinity. The binding of siltuximab to hIL-6 was demonstrated by 
BIAcore (KD=34±9 pM) and ELISA analysis. A fluorescent bead-based assay showed that 
siltuximab potently blocks the interaction of IL-6 with its receptor. Additional in vitro studies 
showed that siltuximab also neutralized IL-6-mediated cellular responses including cell 
proliferation, cell survival, intracellular signalling (STAT-3 phosphorilation) and synthesis of 
downstream proteins as acute phase protein SAA by HepG2 human hepatoma cells and the IgM 
production by Burkitt´s B-lymphoma cell lines. Siltuximab blocked the biologic effect of IL-6 at dose 
levels below trough serum concentration reached in humans treated with 11 mg/kg of siltuximab 
once every 3-weeks. 
The ability of siltuximab to block the biologic effects of hIL-6 in vivo was studied in other IL-6 
mediated or dependent disease systems. These included an evaluation of effects of IL-6 inhibition 
on tumour growth, tumour-induced cachexia, angiogenesis, and tumour-induced thrombosis. 
Available data from in vitro and in vivo studies with siltuximab are considered enough to conclude 
it has an anti-tumoral effect. Additional in vivo experiments in the mice model for MCD are not 
considered necessary. 
Siltuximab binds to and neutralizes human and non-human primate IL-6 but does not inhibit 
mouse, rat, dog, pig or guinea pig IL-6. Therefore, the cynomolgus monkey was selected as a 
pharmacologically relevant species for the toxicology and pharmacokinetics evaluation of 
siltuximab.  
In accordance with the ICH S6 guideline for preclinical safety evaluation of biotechnology-derived 
pharmaceuticals [EMA/CHMP/ICH/731268/1998], safety pharmacology endpoints were measured 
during the in vivo toxicology studies where CNTO 328 or siltuximab was given to cynomolgus 
monkeys via repeated intravenous administration once a week for up to 6 months. Decreased heart 
rate and VPCs were noted at the maximum dose level of 46 mg/kg.  However, the observed effects 
appeared to occur in a small number of animals and in the case of the VPCs these were also 
observed during the pre-dose period and in the control group; hence, the observed findings were 
not considered to be of biological significance. Overall the data presented suggest that, siltuximab 
has no effect on the cardiovascular, central nervous and respiratory systems at exposures 7 fold (on 
basis of Cmax) and 20 fold (on basis of AUC) higher than that proposed clinically. 
No siltuximab treatment–related adverse effects on safety pharmacology parameters were 
observed in the 3 and 6 months toxicology studies.

IL-6 has been associated with down-regulation of CYP isoenzymes. Therefore, it cannot be excluded 
that siltuximab might indirectly influence the expression level of CYP enzymes in MCD patients and 
co-administered drugs metabolised by this pathway could then be metabolised faster in the 
presence of siltuximab. On the basis of the data presented, the potential for pharmacodynamic drug 
interactions with a number of anti-cancer drugs seems to be low.  From a non-clinical point of view, 
no further interaction studies are warranted. 
The exposure to siltuximab in monkeys increased in an approximately dose proportional manner 
and moderate accumulation of siltuximab in monkey serum was observed after 6 months of 
treatment. Overall, the toxicology program adequately assessed the systemic exposure to 
siltuximab in MCD treated IV with 11 mg/kg, q3w. 
The mean volume of distribution of siltuximab in cynomolgus monkeys, together with results from 
the Tissue Cross Reactivity study, suggested that the distribution of siltuximab was mainly confined 
to the vascular space in the body, which is typical of a IgG-based mAb. Assuming a similar 
distribution in cancer patients, the projected maximum CSF concentration of siltuximab following 3 
weekly doses at 11 mg/kg would be 125 ng/mL, which is within the pharmacological concentration 
range, but no signs of neurotoxicity have been observed in non-clinical and clinical studies 
performed with siltuximab.   
Siltuximab crosses the placenta in studies in monkeys and it is unknown whether siltuximab is 
excreted in human milk. Excretion of siltuximab into milk has not been studied. A pre- and postnatal 
developmental study in monkeys with CNTO 136 (an anti-IL-6 humanized monoclonal IgG κ 
antibody that was derived from siltuximab) showed CNTO 136 is not distributed to the milk, as 
expected because in non-human primates IgGs are only excreted in the milk initially.  A risk to the 
newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast 
feeding or discontinue/abstain from siltuximab therapy taking into account the benefit of breast 
feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
No specific metabolism and excretion studies were performed. Similar to other IgG1 mAbs, the 
expected consequences of metabolism of siltuximab are the degradation to small peptides and 
individual amino acids.  
Two changes in the manufacturing process of siltuximab were made during its development. 
Initially, it was produced by Sp2/0 cell line (175A), then by the Sp2/0 subclone cell line 175H and 
the intended clinical product is produced by CHO-derived (C1612A) cell lines. The similarity of the 
PK profiles of siltuximab produced by 175A and 175H cell lines in monkeys has been demonstrated. 
No non-clinical studies were performed to compare siltuximab produced by Sp2/0 and CHO cell 
lines; however, the similarity of both products was demonstrated by quality studies. 
In the repeat dose toxicity studies siltuximab was well tolerated by cynomolgus monkeys up to six 
months. The only abnormal clinical signs possibly associated with siltuximab treatment were skin 
erythema and facial swelling observed in individual animals treated with 46 mg/kg of siltuximab and 
signs of immunotoxicity (reduction in anti-KLH IgG and IgM antibody titers after immunization with 
the T-cell dependent neoantigen KLH, an elevation in T and B lymphocytes following the first 
infusion of siltuximab and a reduction in size and number of splenic germinal centers). Skin 
disorders were commonly observed in MCD patients treated with siltuximab. Signs of 
immunotoxicity were considered to be pharmacological responses of IL 6 inhibition and not of 
toxicological significance.

There was no evidence of genotoxic potential.  
Rodent carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with siltuximab. Evidence from studies 
conducted with siltuximab and other IL-6 inhibitors suggest that the potential for siltuximab to 
cause carcinogenicity is low. However, there is also evidence to suggest that IL-6 inhibition may 
suppress immune responses,  immune surveillance and lower defense against established tumors. 
Therefore, an increased susceptibility to specific tumors cannot be entirely ruled out. This 
information is reflected in section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
During an embryo-fetal development study where siltuximab was administered intravenously to 
pregnant cynomolgus monkeys (gestation day 20 – 118) at doses of 9.2 and 46 mg/kg/week, no 
maternal or fetal toxicity was observed. Siltuximab crossed the placenta during gestation whereby 
fetal serum concentrations of siltuximab at gestation day (GD) 140 were similar to maternal 
concentrations. Histopathological examination of lymphoid tissues from GD140 fetuses showed no 
morphological abnormalities in the development of the immune system. 
There are no data from the use of siltuximab in pregnant women. Studies in animals with siltuximab 
have shown no adverse effect on pregnancy or on embryofetal development. Siltuximab is not 
recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. 
Siltuximab should be given to a pregnant woman only if the benefit clearly outweighs the risk.  
Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during and up to 3 months after 
treatment. As with other immunoglobulin G antibodies, siltuximab crosses the placenta as observed 
in studies in monkeys. Consequently, infants born to women treated with siltuximab may be at 
increased risk of infection, and caution is advised in the administration of live vaccines to these 
infants.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK properties of siltuximab were studied in 473 subjects treated with single-agent therapy in 
Phase 1 and 2 Phase 2 studies (Table 1). After the earlier Phase 1 single-agent dose-escalation 
studies (C0328T01, C0328T03, and CNTO328STM2001), single-agent siltuximab Phase 2 studies 
were conducted at 11 mg/kg every 3 weeks (or equivalent dose intensity 15 mg/kg every 4 weeks). 
A pooled population PK analysis (378 patients) was conducted to describe the PK characteristics of 
siltuximab following IV administration of the single-agent siltuximab at doses ranging from 0.9 to 
15 mg/kg and to identify and quantify the influence of significant covariates on the disposition of 
siltuximab in subjects with various haematological and non-haematological malignancies including: 
MCD, CD, RCC, NHL, MM, solid tumours, ovarian cancer, and smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM). 
Six Phase 1/2 studies were included in this population PK analysis: C0328T01, C0328T03, 
CNTO328STM2001, CNTO328SMM1001, CNTO328MDS2001, and CNTO328MCD2001. The 
population PK model development was performed in 2 stages. In the first stage, data from 5 Phase 
1 or Phase 2 studies (Studies C0328T01, C0328T03, CNTO328STM2001, CNTO328SMM1001, and 
CNTO328MDS2001) were used to develop a base model and an initial exploratory model in which a 
stepwise covariate selection procedure was conducted for covariate selection. In the second stage, 
a confirmatory population PK analysis was conducted using data from the Phase 2 Study, 
CNTO328MCD2001. With adequate predictive performance of the Stage 1 initial exploratory model, 
the initial exploratory model was used as a final model to provide an updated estimation of the 
population PK parameters and their associated variability by pooling datasets from all 6 studies.

a Immunogenicity studies are not included in this table. 
Absorption  
Absorption data is not available since all studies administered siltuximab as an IV infusion. 
Distribution 
In study C0328T03, following dosing of 11 mg/kg every 3 weeks, the mean Vz ranged from 91.3 to 
115.4 mL/kg following a single IV administration in B-cell NHL, MM, or CD. As this represents only 
9.1% to 11.5% of the weight, this finding also suggests that siltuximab is primarily localized to the 
circulatory system with limited extravascular tissue distribution. 
Elimination 
In study CNTO328STM2001 following the first dose administration at the recommended dose 
regimen (11 mg/kg given once every 3 weeks), the CL was 3.54±0.44 mL/day/kg and terminal 
phase t1/2 was 16.3±4.2 days. 
In study C0328T03 following the first dose administration at the recommend dose of 11 mg/kg 
every 3 weeks, the mean CL of siltuximab ranged from 4.03 to 4.59 mL/day/kg and the mean t1/2 
ranged from 17.73 to 20.64 days. 
In study C0328T08 following single dose administration of 1.4 mg/kg of CHO-derived siltuximab, 
the mean±standard deviation CL was 2.21±0.479 mL/day/kg and t1/2 was 26.68±5.960 days. 
These parameters were estimated based on an 84-day PK sampling after the dose. 
In study CNTO328MCD2001, following the first dose, the mean CL of siltuximab was 6.14 
mL/day/kg with an inter-subject PK variability in terms of CV% of 48%.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The single-dose PK of siltuximab has been evaluated in study C0328T08. In this study and following 
a single dose administration of 1.4 mg/kg CHO-derived siltuximab, serum concentrations declined 
in a bi-exponential manner with a mean±standard deviation t1/2 of 26.68±5.96 days and CL was 
2.21±0.48 mL/day/kg. 
Dose proportionality for subjects who received doses of siltuximab ranging from 0.9 mg/kg (1.0 
mg/kg) to 11 mg/kg (12 mg/kg) was shown in study C0328T01. 
Following the first dose in study C0328T03, the Cmax and AUC(0-14D) increased in an approximate 
dose-proportional manner from 2.8 mg/kg to 11 mg/kg. Following the Day 43 administration, the 
Cmax and AUC(0-t) increased in an approximate dose-proportional manner for doses ranging from 2.8 
mg/kg to 11 mg/kg. 
Following the first dose in study CNTO328STM2001, the Cmax and AUC∞ increased in an approximate 
dose- proportional manner from 5.5 mg/kg to 15 mg/kg. This is also supported by the CL being 
independent of dose between 5.5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg.  
In study C0328T03, the mean accumulation ratio ranged from 1.54 to 2.77, and this level of 
accumulation is consistent with the observed t1/2 following the first dose.

Based on the preinfusion (trough) siltuximab concentrations in study CNTO328MCD2001, 
steady-state appeared to be achieved by the Cycle 6 Day 1 dose, which occurred after 105 days of 
dosing. The time to steady-state is consistent with the previously reported t1/2. The mean Cmax,ss 
was 331.88±138.72 and Cmin,ss was 84.12±65.631 μg/ml (Cycle 6 Day 1). In addition, trough 
serum concentrations were similar after reaching steady-state, indicating that the PK of siltuximab 
is time-independent. 
Special populations 
No specific studies have been conducted in special populations. All information was obtained from 
the conducted clinical studies and the population PK analysis.  
The population PK analysis evaluated the effect of bodyweight, age, gender, ethnicity, steroids, 
renal and hepatic impairment, effect of cell line and antibodies as well as tumour subtype.  
No substantial differences in PK exposure in subjects ≤ 100 kg or subjects >100 kg wewe observed. 
The typical population values for CL, Vc, Q, and Vp in a subject with a standard body weight of 70 
kg male were 0.223 L/day, 4.54 L, 0.448 L/day, and 3.39 L, respectively. The BSV (% CV) for CL, 
VC, and VP, were 50.9%, 20.3% and 63.5%, respectively.  
Age (range 18 to 85 years) was evaluated as a covariate on siltuximab CL, VC and VP. This covariate 
was not significant during the stepwise forward selection backward elimination covariate selection 
procedure and deemed not to be a statistically important covariate on CL, VC and VP. Thus dose 
adjustment based on age is not warranted.  
Because half of the subjects with PK data in Study CNTO328MCD2001 were Asian (n=33, 50%), an 
additional exploratory evaluation of potential effect of race (Asian versus non-Asian) on CL was 
performed by testing its inclusion in the final model. This resulted in a significant NONMEM objective 
function value (OFV) decrease (41.04) with an estimated 67% increase of CL in Asian subjects. This 
is not supported by any known mechanistic rationale. To examine its plausibility, the EBE of ETAs of 
Asian versus non-Asian was compared. There was no suggestion of apparent PK differences 
between Asians versus non-Asians in Study CNTO328MCD2001 (Part A), while there was a potential 
difference in CL between Asians versus non-Asians in the overall population (Part B). Given that few 
Asian subjects (n=6) were present in studies other than Study CNTO328MCD2001, this suggests 
that the apparent Asian effect could be due to study differences, which may be confounded with 
other known/unknown factors as earlier noted. Analyses in Study CNTO328MCD2001 confirmed 
that efficacy and safety results were similar in Asians versus non-Asians. Therefore, clinically 
important PK differences between Asians and non-Asians were considered unlikely, and were not 
included in the final model. 
Of the remaining covariates, cell type (CELL) and gender were significant covariates on Vc, and 
tumor subtype (STDY) was significant on Vp. However, on evaluation of the plots of the EBEs of 
these PK parameters with the respective covariates, it was found that the medians and the 95% CI 
largely overlapped. Therefore, these covariates were not considered clinically relevant and do not 
warrant dose adjustment based on cell type, gender, or tumor subtype.

Although, CRCL was initially not evaluated due to high correlation with weight, CRCL was evaluated 
using the final model with data from all 6 studies. The addition of CRCL (range of values 12 to 270 
mL/min) as a covariate on CL resulted in a NONMEM OFV decrease of 6.32, which was not 
statistically significant. Therefore, CRCL at baseline did not have a clinically relevant effect on 
siltuximab PK in subjects with calculated CRCL values of 12 mL/min or greater. Four patients with 
severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 12 to 30 mL/min) were included in the data set.  
For patients with baseline alanine transaminase up to 3.7 times the upper limit of normal baseline 
albumin ranging from 15 to 58 g/L, and baseline bilirubin ranging from 1.7 to 42.8 mg/dL there was 
no meaningful effect on siltuximab PK. 
Although not examined due to the high correlation with ALT, utilizing the upper limit of the range for 
AST (10-34 U/L), the range of AST relative to the ULN was 0.1 to 6.4 x ULN. The results of the 
analysis with ALT suggest no relationship between baseline AST and PK will be observed.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Siltuximab is a chimeric (human-murine) IgG1κ mAb that specifically binds to and neutralizes 
human IL-6 with high affinity. 
Overproduction of the cytokine IL-6, either native or virally encoded, has been hypothesized to play 
a central role in driving plasma cell proliferation and systemic manifestations of MCD (Casper, 
2005; van Rhee et al, 2010). 
A possible source of IL-6 production in Castleman’s disease may be from cells infected with human 
herpes virus-8 (HHV-8). HHV-8 has been shown to produce a viral analog of IL-6 with 
approximately 50% similarity to the human IL-6 gene at the amino acid level (Moore et al, 1996), 
and virally produced IL-6 may be an important trigger of Castleman’s disease. However, a 
substantial subset of Castleman’s disease patients is HIV- and HHV-8-negative. In these patients, 
dysregulation of IL-6 production or the cell-signaling pathway downstream of the interleukin-6 
receptor (IL-6R) have been hypothesized to play a role in a number of pathologic conditions, and 
may explain the endogenous production of this human cytokine.

IL-6 is a potent growth factor for B lymphocytes and plasma cells and excess IL-6 induces a 
proinflammatory syndrome that leads to constitutional symptoms, induction of vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF) secretion and induction of immune dysregulation leading to autoimmune 
phenomena including cytopenias (van Rhee et al, 2010). Experience with a human IL-6 transgenic 
murine model clearly supports a pivotal role for IL-6 in the etiology of MCD (Katsume et al, 1997). 
These mice overexpress human IL-6 and develop a CD-like disorder. Continuous treatment of these 
mice with antibodies against the IL-6R significantly reduced or prevented all pathologies examined, 
confirming the role of IL-6 in the etiology of Castleman’s disease (Katsume et al, 2002).  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Study CNTO0328MCD2001 
Rapid and sustained suppression of serum CRP levels in subjects with MCD was observed only in the 
siltuximab group in study CNTO328MCD2001, which is indicative of in vivo neutralization of IL-6 
bioactivity. The CRP suppression with CHO-derived siltuximab was consistent with that observed in 
MCD subjects treated with Sp2/0-derived siltuximab in study C0328T03 at the same dose regimen. 
Hepcidin levels decreased (median decrease of 47%) as early as Cycle 1 Day 8 post siltuximab 
treatment, compared with an 11% increase from baseline in the placebo group. However, hepcidin 
decrease alone is not predictive of hemoglobin improvement, as not all of the hemoglobin 
response-evaluable population with hepcidin reduction showed hemoglobin improvement of at least 
15 g/L in the siltuximab and placebo groups. Further, an exploratory analysis of tissue expression 
of IL-6 and other markers associated with IL-6 signaling, along with gene expression analysis, did 
not indicate any association with clinical response (durable tumor and symptomatic response or 
tumor response). 
Study C0328T03 
Since suppression of CRP can be used as a biomarker reflective of inhibition of IL-6 activity by 
siltuximab, a population PK/PD analysis was performed to explore the relationship between 
siltuximab serum concentration and its inhibitory effect on CRP concentration using data from a 
Phase 1 Study C0328T03 in subjects with B-cell NHL, MM, or CD. The objectives of this analysis 
were to: 1) develop a PK/PD population model to characterize the relationship between siltuximab 
systemic exposure and CRP concentrations following intravenous administration of various 
siltuximab dosing regimens and 2) to apply the model to simulate and identify desirable dosing 
regimens that would reduce serum CRP to below 1 mg/L throughout dosing. 
CRP suppression was observed in all disease types tested across all dose cohorts, with greater 
decreases in higher dose cohorts. Baseline systemic IL-6 levels do not appear to be predictive of 
clinical response in the limited number of subjects evaluated for each disease type. Hepcidin 
decreased post-treatment in a majority of subjects, with a general trend toward hemoglobin 
improvement. Differential gene expression or IL-6 activity strength was not evident in the very 
limited number of samples available for testing. A majority of subjects with Castleman’s disease 
tested for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Cohort 7b (7 of 8) who showed expression of 
the minor allele of 2 IL-6R SNPs, also showed higher levels of serum sIL-6R.

CNT0328SMM1001 Study 
A thorough QT study was not conducted due to the inability to obtain exposure in healthy normal 
volunteers equal to the supratherapeutic dose of 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks. A single-arm 
monotherapy study design was used to examime the effect of siltuximab on QT. The dose was 
selected based on the ICH guidance that QT assessment should be conducted using a 
supratherapeutic dose. The dose intensity of siltuximab in the registration studies was 11 mg/kg 
every 3 weeks. The dose of siltuximab, in this study was 15 mg/kg administered every 3 weeks. The 
QT evaluable population consisted of 27 subjects who completed ECG assessments at each 
prespecified time point in Cycle 1 and Cycle 4 and received 4 full doses of siltuximab in the 
treatment period. The difference in means between the post baseline QTcF and QTcB (at each time 
point in Cycle 1 and Cycle 4) and pre infusion Cycle 1 Day 1 QTc was less than 20 milliseconds. The 
upper bound of the 90% confidence interval for the difference in means between the post baseline 
QTc (at each time point in Cycle 1 and Cycle 4) and pre infusion Cycle 1 Day 1 QTc was less than 20 
milliseconds; therefore an effect of siltuximab on either QTcF or QTcB can be ruled out. None of the 
27 QT evaluable subjects showed a > 30 msec change from baseline in either QTcF or QTcB during 
treatment with siltuximab. There were no meaningful changes at any timepoint tested in mean 
QTcF or QTcB, or in mean change from baseline in QTcF or QTcB. The mean PR, QRS, and heart rate 
remained stable during treatment with siltuximab. No clinically significant ECG abnormalities 
related to siltuximab treatment were observed. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling 
showed no statistically significant relationships between paired siltuximab serum concentrations 
and change from baseline in QTcF or QTcB. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The human pharmacokinetic properties of siltuximab have been characterised sufficiently in cancer 
patients and are in line with those observed for other IgG monoclonal antibodies.  
Serum concentrations of siltuximab appeared to decline in a bi-exponential manner with a mean 
terminal phase half-life ranging from 17.73 to 20.64 days. Overall, based on the available data 
siltuximab is considered to display roughly dose proportional pharmacokinetics in the dose range 
0.9 to 15 mg/kg. Following repeat-dose administration at the target dose of 11 mg/kg every 3 
weeks, siltuximab CL was found to be time-invariant. Consistent with the t1/2 after the first dose, 
serum concentrations reached steady-state levels by the sixth infusion. 
PK comparability of the Cmax and AUC(0-84D) in both CHO and Sp2/0 derived siltuximab arms  
since the 90% CI of the ratios of the geometric means for Cmax and AUC(0-84D) both fell within the 
range of 80% to 125%. Despite initially it was not entirely clear whether the drug lot used in this 
comparison was comparable to those used in the pivotal trial and consistent with the commercial 
process, this has been clarified by the applicant and does not pose a problem anymore.  
Only one patient was positive for a non-neutralising antibody, thus potential effect of antibody 
response on siltuximab PK has not been evaluated. This is considered reasonable and is acceptable. 
Siltuximab treatment in MCD results in rapid and sustained decreases in CRP serum concentrations. 
Measurement of IL-6 concentrations in serum or plasma during treatment should not be used as a 
pharmacodynamic marker, as siltuximab-neutralised antibody-IL-6 complexes interfere with 
current immunological-based IL-6 quantification methods. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/258608/2014 
Page 35/92 
 
  
  
The population PK/PD analysis appears to suggest that the 11 mg/Kg dose q3w or 15 mg/Kg q4w 
would reduce CRP to below 1mg. 
Although no formal drug interaction studies were conducted this is reasonable in the case of 
siltuximab which is a protein and PK interactions subject to cytochrome P450 dependent 
metabolism are considered unlikely to occur. Given the difficulties in performing a DDI study in a 
MCD population with highly variable baseline IL-6 serum and tissue concentration, highly variable 
baseline CYP450 activity, with differential extent and severity of disease (thus resulting in different 
CYP450 activity) and with numerous concomitant medications that may induce or inhibit CYP450 
activity; it was concluded that current information under section 4.5 of SmPC correctly addresses 
the potential of interactions based on theoretical grounds and no further studies are requested for 
siltuximab. Moreover, the lack of data in drug-drug interaction (increased metabolism of CYP450 
substrate) is important missing information reflected in the RMP.  
Estimated CL, central volume of distribution and peripheral volume of distribution increased with 
increasing body weight. As siltuximab is administered intravenously having a low volume of 
distribution, the body weight-based dosing regimen appears to be appropriate. Given that no 
dose-toxicity relationship was established based on early clinical trials no high limit of total dose has 
been established.  
The population PK of siltuximab were analysed to evaluate the effects of demographic 
characteristics. The results showed no significant difference in the PK of siltuximab in patients older 
than 65 years.  
The effect of anti-siltuximab antibody status was not examined, as there were insufficient numbers 
of anti-siltuximab antibody positive patients. 
The lack of studies in renal and hepatic function is acceptable from a PK point of view given that this 
is a monoclonal antibody for which elimination via renal excretion, biliary excretion or hepatic 
metabolism is limited. No dose adjustments are proposed for patients with renal or hepatic 
impairment. However, based on clinical findings it cannot be excluded that patients with liver 
impairment may experience higher-grade AEs and SAEs compared with the overall population and 
monitoring of patients with known liver impairment as well as patients with elevated transaminase 
and/or elevated bilirubin is recommended (see discussion on clinical safety). 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of siltuximab has been investigated sufficiently. Information regarding 
potential interactions has been reflected in the SmPC and remaining uncertainties regarding 
interactions have been addressed in the RMP. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical efficacy of siltuximab in multicentric Castleman’s disease patients who are human 
immunodeficiency (HIV) negative and human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) negative is based on the 
results of studies CNTO328MCD2001, C0328T03, and CNTO328MCD2002.

Table 2. Clinical efficacy studies of siltuximab in MCD 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
The proposed siltuximab dosing regimen of 11 mg/kg every 3 weeks in patients with MCD has been 
selected on the basis of clinical efficacy and safety observed in the phase I dose escalation study 
C0328T03. 
Study C0328T03 was a Phase 1, open-label, non-randomized, dose-finding study to assess the 
safety and pharmacokinetics of multiple dosing regimens of siltuximab administered as an IV 
infusion for the treatment of subjects with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (including chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia [CLL]/small lymphocytic leukemia [SLL] and Waldenstrom’s 
macroglobulinemia [WM]), multiple myeloma (MM), or CD. 
Sixty-seven subjects, including 37 subjects with Castleman’s disease, received treatment in the 
study:  
Cohort 1 (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks): 6 subjects  
Cohort 2 (6 mg/kg every 2 weeks):7 subjects  
Cohort 3 (12 mg/kg every 3 weeks): 10 subjects  
Cohort 4 (6 mg/kg weekly): 6 subjects 
Cohort 5 (12 mg/kg every 2 weeks):6 subjects  
Cohort 6 (12 mg/kg every 3 weeks): 12 subjects  
Cohort 7a (9 mg/kg every 3 weeks):12 subjects  
Cohort 7b (12 mg/kg every 3 weeks): 8 subjects 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/258608/2014 
Page 37/92 
 
 
  
  
The dose levels of 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 mg/kg used in C0328T03 have not been adjusted by multiplying 
them by a factor of 0.92 (see PK section). So, the doses expressed above should be read as 0.9, 
2.8, 5.5, 8.3, and 11 mg/kg. 
C-reactive protein (CRP) suppression was observed after treatment with siltuximab across all 
cohorts. Subjects with Castleman’s disease treated with 12 mg/kg every 3 weeks showed greater 
decrease of CRP compared with those treated with 9 mg/kg every 3 weeks, supporting observations 
from clinical benefit assessments. Neutralization of IL-6 also caused a decrease in hepcidin (an 
iron-regulating peptide hormone) in a majority of subjects, consistent with a general trend toward 
hemoglobin improvement. No apparent treatment-related changes were observed in other serum 
markers (inflammation, angiogenesis, or bone resorption) examined.  
Of the 37 treated subjects with Castleman’s disease, 32 subjects (86.5%) had improvement in 1 or 
more components of clinical benefit assessments, 28 subjects (75.7%) had improvement in 2 or 
more components of clinical benefit assessments, and 21 subjects (56.8%) had improvement in 3 
or more components of clinical benefit assessments.  
Of the 37 treated subjects with Castleman’s disease, 1 subject (2.7%) had a best response of 
complete response (CR), 11 subjects (29.7%) had a best response of partial response (PR), 3 
subjects (8.1%) had unconfirmed PR, and 20 subjects (54.1%) had SD. The 1 CR and 8 of 11 PRs 
were in subjects treated with the highest dose of siltuximab (12 mg/kg). 
The multiple dosing regimens of siltuximab tested in all 3 disease types in the study were well 
tolerated, with no DLTs observed.  
The efficacy results from this phase I trial (study C0328T03) also appeared to be very similar to 
those seen in the pivotal phase II trial in that only 1/53 patients showed a CR while 32% showed a 
partial response which is similar to the 37.5% noted in the phase I study. 
The main criteria for the dose selection was based on suppression of the CRP levels to below 1 mg 
by the various doses tested, which appeared to be increased with the proposed dose. However, 
there was no clinical data to suggest that a higher dose of 15 mg would have achieved similar 
results to the 11mg proposed dose. 
Despite the fact that there was suppression of CRP levels in all indications across different dosing 
regimens a dose response relationship was difficult to determine based on the multiple dose 
intensities examined in this study. Nevertheless, it is remarkable that CRP suppression did not seem 
to correlate with clinical response in both the phase I and phase II pivotal studies. This was 
particularly evident in the individual patient data. 
Accordingly, these observations would appear to suggest that the optimum dose has yet to be 
determined, especially in light of the fact that that the maximum tolerated dose has not been 
reached however,  a degree of efficacy appears to be evident in the doses studied which, 
nevertheless, does not appear to be maximal as far as clinical response is concerned. 
Of the 37 treated subjects with Castleman’s disease, all 37 had AEs, 20 subjects (54.1%) had AEs 
of toxicity grade 3 or higher, 10 subjects (27.0%) had SAEs, 3 subjects (8.1%) permanently 
discontinued study agent due to an AE, and none died because of an AE.

Treatments 
Patients were randomised (2:1) to receive either siltuximab (11 mg/kg) or placebo by a 1-hour IV 
infusion every 3 weeks plus BSC. 
Dose modification (increase or decrease) was not permitted. Infusions could have been 
administered up to 4 days before or 3 days after the scheduled infusion date. Before each 
administration of study agent, clinical laboratory results and general physical status were reviewed 
to evaluate for potential toxicity. Subjects were to have fully recovered to treatment criteria before 
re-administering study agent. If treatment had been delayed due to toxicity, all required laboratory 
assessments for the visit at which the subject was unable to be treated were repeated before 
restarting treatment. 
Best supportive care included management of effusions (eg, drainage, diuretics), antipyretics, 
antipruritics, antihistamines, pain medication, management of infections (antibiotics, oral or topical 
antifungals, and antiviral treatment except for ganciclovir), transfusions and standard management 
of infusion-related reactions as specified in institutional guidelines. Patients who were receiving 
corticosteroid treatment at the time of screening might have been considered for inclusion in the 
study provided the dose did not exceed 1 mg/kg/day of prednisone (or equivalent) and had 
remained stable or decreased over the 4 weeks before randomization.

Objectives 
The primary objective of the CNTO328MCD2001 study was to show superiority of siltuximab plus 
BSC versus placebo plus BSC in terms of durable tumour and symptomatic response among 
subjects with MCD.  
Secondary objectives included comparisons in terms of efficacy (tumour response; duration of 
response; time to treatment failure; change in haemoglobin levels; ability to discontinue 
corticosteroids; and improvement in fatigue, physical function, and other disease-related 
symptoms), evaluation of safety of prolonged dosing, evaluation of pharmacokinetics of siltuximab 
among subjects with MCD and determination of a baseline hepcidin value predictive of a ≥20 g/L 
increase in haemoglobin. 
Biomarker analyses to identify potential pharmacodynamic biomarkers of response for IL-6-driven 
neoplasia and to correlate pharmacodynamic biomarkers with indicators of clinical efficacy were 
also included as exploratory. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint of the study was durable tumour and symptomatic response defined as either 
complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as follows: 
Partial Response (PR) was defined as a >50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters 
(SPD) of index lesion(s), with at least SD in all other evaluable disease in the absence of treatment 
failure, sustained for at least 18 weeks. 
Complete response (CR) was defined as complete disappearance of all measurable and evaluable 
disease (eg, pleural effusion) and resolution of baseline symptoms attributed to MCD, sustained for 
at least 18 weeks. 
Whenever possible, treatment failure documented by the appearance of new lesions was to be 
confirmed by histologic examination of the new lesions. 
Secondary endpoints included the following: 
Duration of Tumour and Symptomatic Response defined as time from first documentation of tumour 
and symptomatic response (CR or PR) to treatment failure. Whenever possible, treatment failure 
documented by the appearance of new lesions was to be confirmed by histologic examination of the 
new lesions. 
Duration of Tumour Response defined as time from first documentation of tumour response (CR or 
PR) to tumour progression. Whenever possible, tumour progression documented by the appearance 
of new lesions was to be confirmed by histologic examination of the new lesions. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/258608/2014 
Page 41/92 
 
  
  
Tumour response (CR+PR) was assessed according to Cheson criteria, modified to allow 
assessment of measurable cutaneous lesions, (PET scan data, if obtained, was not taken into 
account). Tumour response was based on the assessment of index lesions (measurable) and 
nonindex lesions (nonmeasurable). A measurable lesion had to be measurable bi-dimensionally. 
Greatest transverse diameter (GTD) was defined as the longest crosswise measurement. The short 
axis was the longest measurement perpendicular to the GTD. All nodal or extranodal measurable 
lesions must measure ≥16 mm in GTD regardless of short axis measurement, or ≥11 mm in short 
axis regardless of the GTD measurement. 
All other lesions that did not meet the criteria for measurable disease as defined, including any 
findings that could not be accurately measured (eg, spleen, liver), were considered nonmeasurable. 
All other lesions not identified by imaging, including cutaneous skin lesions and lymph nodes that 
did not meet the measurable disease criteria, were to be considered as nonmeasurable clinical 
lesions.  
• 
• 
• 
• 
Tumor CR: complete disappearance of all measurable and evaluable disease (eg, pleural 
effusion) 
Tumor PR: a ≥50% decrease in SPD of index lesion(s), with at least SD in all otherevaluable 
disease 
Tumor SD: failure to attain CR or PR, without evidence of PD 
Tumor PD: a ≥50% increase in SPD of index lesion(s) compared to nadir, or at least 1 new 
lesion that has been confirmed and measures >1.5 cm in longest dimension. Malignant 
transformation in a previously defined mass was also considered PD. 
Time to Treatment Failure defined as the time from randomization until the subject fails treatment. 
Treatment failure was defined as any of the following: a sustained increase from baseline in disease 
related symptoms ≥ Grade 2 persisting for at least 3 weeks despite BSC; onset of any new 
disease-related Grade 3 or higher symptom despite BSC; sustained (ie, at least 3 weeks) 
deterioration in performance status (increase from baseline in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
[ECOG] Performance Status by more than 1 point) despite BSC; radiologic progression, as 
measured by modified Cheson criteria; initiation of any other therapy intended to treat MCD ie, 
prohibited treatments and onset of any new disease-related Grade 3 or higher symptom despite 
BSC. 
Change in Haemoglobin 
The change in haemoglobin was calculated as maximum change from baseline in the absence of 
transfusion and ESAs. 
An increase in haemoglobin of 15 g/L or more at Week 13, defined as an increase in haemoglobin of 
15 g/L or more at Week 13 over baseline, was calculated. 
An increase in haemoglobin of 20 g/L or more at Week 13, defined as an increase in haemoglobin of 
20 g/L or more at Week 13 over baseline, was calculated.

Discontinuations of Corticosteroids 
The proportion of subjects who were able to discontinue corticosteroids (if they were 
corticosteroid-dependent at study entry), and were corticosteroid-free for at least 9 consecutive 
weeks during the blinded Treatment Period, was calculated. 
MCD-related Symptom Improvement 
Thirty-four (34) MCD-related signs and symptoms were prospectively collected. A total score of all 
symptoms (referred to as the MCD-related Overall Symptom Score) is the sum of the severity 
grades (NCI-CTCAE grade) of the MCD-related signs and symptoms (general MCD-related, 
autoimmune phenomena, fluid retention, neuropathy, and skin disorders) and was calculated. The 
per cent change from baseline in MCD-related signs and symptoms (general MCD-related, 
autoimmune phenomena, fluid retention, neuropathy, and skin disorders) at each cycle was 
calculated. 
Symptomatic Response: Based on the MCD-related Overall Symptom Score, symptomatic response 
analyses were defined as follows: 
-Durable symptomatic response (partial and complete): Defined as a ≥50% reduction in overall 
MCD-related Overall Symptom Score sustained for at least 18 weeks prior to treatment failure. 
- Durable complete symptomatic response: Defined as a 100% reduction in the baseline 
MCD-related Overall Symptom Score sustained for at least 18 weeks prior to treatment failure. 
- The time to durable symptomatic response: Defined as the time from randomization to the first 
evidence of durable symptomatic response. 
-The time to durable complete symptomatic response: Defined as the time from randomization to 
the first evidence of durable complete symptomatic response. 
- Duration of durable symptomatic response: Defined as the time from first durable symptomatic 
response to the first documented evidence of symptom progression prior to treatment failure. 
Overall Survival defined as the duration in days from date of randomization to the date of death due 
to any cause. 
Time to Durable Tumour and Symptomatic Response defined as the time from randomization to the 
first evidence of a durable tumour and symptomatic response (CR + PR). 
Patient-reported outcome (PRO) endpoints  
These included change from baseline in fatigue, measured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic 
Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F); change from baseline in physical function, assessed by the 
Medical Outcome Study Short-Form-36 (SF-36) Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental 
Component Score (MCS); and change from baseline in patient reported symptom severity 
measured with the MCD Symptom Scale (MCD-SS).  
Other endpoints 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) endpoints included Cmin and Cmax. Samples were collected for determination 
of antibodies to siltuximab. Biomarker (C-reactive protein [CRP], Interleukin- 6 [IL-6], hepcidin, 
and immunohistochemistry) and gene expression information was collected.

Sample size 
With a 1:2 randomization, assuming a 5% overall response rate in the placebo + BSC arm and a 
30% overall response rate in the siltuximab + BSC arm, a total of 78 subjects (26 placebo + BSC 
arm; 52 siltuximab + BSC arm) were estimated to be required to demonstrate a difference between 
the two treatment arms with a 2-sided level of significance of 5% and 80% power. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomised to receive siltuximab or placebo with a ratio of 2:1. Randomisation was 
stratified by corticosteroid use at baseline. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was double-blind. 
Statistical methods 
The primary population for the efficacy analysis was the ITT population, which was defined as all 
randomised patients. The population for safety analysis comprised all randomized subjects that 
received at least 1 dose of study agent (siltuximab or placebo). 
The primary analysis was to occur after the last subject has completed all Week 48 assessments. 
Subjects who experienced treatment failure before meeting the criteria for a responder were 
counted as non-responders for this analysis. The response rate in the two treatment arms was 
compared using an exact Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, adjusted for the stratification factor.  
Durable tumour and symptomatic response rates were calculated using independently reviewed 
assessments.  
Durable tumour and symptomatic response rate for subjects in the siltuximab treated population 
was also calculated. These analyses included subjects who were randomized to placebo but were 
unblinded and subsequently received siltuximab treatment. Independently reviewed durable 
tumour and symptomatic responses observed were included. These analyses were repeated for the 
durable tumour and symptomatic response according to investigator assessments.

Conduct of the study 
As of the data cut-off, there were five amendments since the original protocol (dated 17 July 2009). 
A summary of major changes resulting from the protocol amendments is presented below. 
Amendment 1 and 2 were implemented before any subjects were randomized.

Amendment 1  (29 October 2009) was implemented to incorporate feedback received from the FDA 
on the Special Protocol Assessment. The  main changes and rationale for the changes are listed 
below:  
•  Subjects whose measurable disease was limited to skin lesions were excluded from the 
study to reduce variability in the subject population for the target indication.  
• 
The population for the primary efficacy endpoint analysis was revised from the evaluable 
population, defined as randomized subjects with confirmed MCD by central pathology 
review, to the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, defined as all randomized subjects, to 
improve the statistical rigor of the study.  
•  A requirement for central pathology review to be performed before randomization to 
confirm MCD was added, because replacement of subjects was no longer permitted.  
• 
• 
• 
• 
The primary efficacy endpoint was modified from objective response (CR + PR) to durable 
tumour and symptomatic response to better reflect treatment goals. CR required resolution 
of all symptoms in addition to tumour response. PR required reduction in tumour burden in 
the absence of treatment failure.  
The primary analysis was conducted using a 2-sided Type I error of 5%, to provide a more 
robust efficacy analysis. The study had been powered accordingly, and the total number of 
subjects was increased to 78.  
The end of study definition was changed from 1 year after the last subject started study 
treatment to 48 weeks after the last subject started study treatment.  
Tumour response was included as a secondary endpoint, because the primary efficacy 
endpoint was now a composite of durable tumour and symptom response.  
•  Haemoglobin assessments were revised from “Change in haemoglobin from baseline to the 
average of the last 8 weeks of treatment (through Week 18)” to “Maximum change from 
baseline in haemoglobin in the absence of transfusion” to provide a readily interpretable 
and clinically relevant measure.  
•  New or increased use of corticosteroid treatment was not permitted as a component of BSC, 
because this may confound the results of the efficacy analyses, and would not allow 
isolation of the siltuximab treatment effect.  
Amendment 2 (10 November 2009): exclusion criterion was added to prevent enrolment of subjects 
with prior exposure to agents targeting IL-6 or the IL-6 receptor).   
Amendment 3  (28 January 2011): The frequency of CRP assessment was revised for subjects 
without disease progression (PD) by the end of treatment. The original protocol previously did not 
include a schedule for CRP assessment at the end of treatment. This was clarified to obtain better 
insight to treatment effect for subjects that discontinued study treatment.  
Amendment 4 (11 March 2012): Updated title page of protocol with name and identity change, to 
comply with regulatory guidelines.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/258608/2014 
Page 46/92 
 
  
  
Amendment 5 (26 June 2012): Continued follow-up for survival status, data on subsequent 
systemic treatment for MCD, and occurrence of malignancies was added for subjects who did not 
continue treatment in the extension study (CNTO328MCD2002). The language was adapted to 
ensure consistent survival follow- up for all subjects that started treatment under the 
CNTO328MCD2001 protocol.

Secondary endpoints 
A summary of secondary endpoints is presented in Table 7 below. 
Table 7. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints From Study CNTO328MCD2001 
• 
Tumour response rate 
Twenty subjects in the siltuximab group and 1 subject in the placebo group had an overall tumour 
response. The overall tumour response rate (independent review) was 37.7% in the siltuximab 
group and 3.8% in the placebo group. The difference in the overall tumour response rate was 
33.9% (95% CI: 11.1-54.8; p=0.0022).  
The best tumour response rate based on the investigator assessment was 50.9% in the siltuximab 
group and 0% in the placebo group. The difference in the overall tumour response rate was 50.9% 
(95% CI: 29.2-70.1; p<0.0001).Twenty-seven (27) subjects in the siltuximab group and no 
subject in the placebo group had an overall tumour response.

• 
Time to treatment failure 
Across both treatment groups, the median duration of follow-up was 422 days (range 55 to 1051 
days).The median time to treatment failure was not reached in the siltuximab group and was 134 
days in the placebo group (HR: 0.418; 95% CI: 0.214-0.815; p=0.0084). 
•  Duration of tumour and symptomatic response 
In the siltuximab group, the median duration of tumour and symptomatic response was 340 days 
(range 55 to 676 days) based on the independent review. The median duration of tumour and 
symptomatic response for subjects with durable tumour and symptomatic response was 383 days 
(range 232 to 676 days) based on the independent review and 466 days (range 183 to 857 days) 
based on the investigator assessment. 
•  Change from Baseline in Haemoglobin 
Nineteen subjects in the siltuximab group and no subject in the placebo group had a ≥15 g/L 
haemoglobin response. The ≥15 g/L haemoglobin response rate was 61.3% in the siltuximab group 
and 0% in the placebo group (95% CI of the difference: 28.3-85.1; p=0.0002). Thirteen subjects in 
the siltuximab group and no subject in the placebo group had a ≥20 g/L haemoglobin response. The 
≥20 g/L hemoglobin response rate was 42% in the siltuximab group and 0% in the placebo group 
(95% CI of the difference: 7.8-70.7; p=0.0195). 
•  Durable Symptomatic Response and Durable Complete Symptomatic Response 
Thirty subjects in the siltuximab group and 5 subjects in the placebo group had a durable 
symptomatic response. The durable symptomatic response rate was 56.6% in the siltuximab group 
and 19.2% in the placebo group. The difference in the durable symptomatic response rate was 
37.4% (95% CI: 14.9-58.2; p=0.0018). 
Thirteen  subjects in the siltuximab group and no subject in the placebo group had a durable 
complete symptomatic response. The durable complete symptomatic response rate was 24.5% in 
the siltuximab group and 0% in the placebo group. The difference in the durable complete 
symptomatic response rate was 24.5% (95% CI: 1.4-46.2; p=0.0037). 
•  Duration of Durable Symptomatic Response and Duration of Complete Symptomatic 
Response 
The median duration of durable symptomatic response was 397 days (range 149 to 865 days) in the 
siltuximab group and 324 days (range 126 to 395 days) in the placebo group. For the 13 
siltuximab-group subjects with durable complete symptomatic response, the median duration of 
durable symptomatic response was 555 days (range 193 to 865 days). The median duration of 
durable complete symptomatic response was 472 days (range 149 to 762 days).  
•  Discontinuations of Corticosteroids 
Corticosteroid use at baseline was reported in 13 subjects (25%) in the siltuximab group and in 9 
subjects (35%) in the placebo group. Discontinuation of corticosteroids during the blinded 
Treatment Period was reported in 4 subjects (31%) in the siltuximab group and 1 subject (11%) in 
the placebo group. The difference in corticosteroid discontinuation rates was 20% (95% CI: -23.6, 
56.7). 
•  Overall Survival 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/258608/2014 
Page 51/92 
 
  
  
At the time of the analysis, overall survival data were not mature (data not shown). 
•  MCD-Related Symptom Improvement 
Baseline MCD-related signs and symptoms were similar between the treatment groups. There was 
a decrease in the median MCD-related Overall Symptom Score at every assessment timepoint, 
compared with baseline, in both treatment groups; however, at any given assessment  timepoint, 
the decrease in median score was numerically larger in the siltuximab group compared with the 
placebo group (data not shown). 
• 
Patient Reported outcomes 
Questionnaires used to directly collect patients’ responses were the MCD Disease Symptom Scale 
(MCD-SS), the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT-F) and SF-36 MCS. 
Numerical differences were found between treatment groups in the MCD-SS. However, statistically 
significant differences in favour to siltuximab were observed for FACIT-F and SF-36 MCS (data not 
shown).

Supportive study 
Study CNTO328MCD2002  
This is an on-going, open-label, multicenter, nonrandomized Phase 2 study designed to evaluate 
the safety of extended treatment with siltuximab in subjects who were previously enrolled in study 
C0328T03 and did not progress on siltuximab in the opinion of the investigator. Duration of disease 
control and survival were assessed. All subjects are being treated until they progress, withdraw, 
experience unacceptable toxicity, or until commercial availability of siltuximab in their region, 
whichever came first.    
At the clinical data cut-off date for the interim analysis, 19 MCD subjects with either CR, PR, or 
stable disease (SD) previously treated in Study C0328T03 were enrolled in the CNTO328MCD2002 
study and all had on-going treatment. Demographics and baseline characteristics of the treated 
subjects are based upon data collected in Study C0328T03 prior to the first exposure of siltuximab: 
the majority of subjects were white (84.2%); 19 subjects were diagnosed with MCD, of which 7 
(36.8%) subjects were newly diagnosed with CD at entry into Study C0328T03.; MCD histology 
subtype by local pathology review: 10 (52.6%) hyaline vascular and 9 (47.4%) plasmacytic; 12 
subjects (63.2%) had systemic therapy for MCD prior to first dose with siltuximab. 
All 19 subjects have been treated for more than 3 years; including 14 (73.7%) subjects who were 
treated more than 4 years, with 1 subject treated for 7 years. At the time of data cut-off, the median 
duration of siltuximab treatment and median duration of follow up was 61 months (range: 41 to 
87). All 19 subjects (100%) are still alive and had a sustained duration of disease control during 
Study CNTO328MCD2002, with a median duration of approximately 45 months.

Although the rationale for the selected dose generally appears to be appropriate in Study 
CO328TO3, it is notable that the maximum tolerated dose was not reached even with a higher dose 
of 15 mg than the selected dose using 11 mg. Despite the fact that there was suppression of CRP 
levels in all indications across different dosing regimens a dose response relationship was difficult to 
determine based on the multiple dose intensities examined. Nevertheless, it is remarkable that CRP 
suppression did not seem to correlate with clinical response in both the phase I and the phase II 
pivotal studies. This was particularly evident in the individual patient data.  The efficacy results from 
the phase I trial appeared to be very similar to those seen in the pivotal phase II trial in that only 1 
patient in each trial showed a CR while 32% showed a partial response which is similar to the 37.5% 
noted in the phase I study. Accordingly, the efficacy as well as good safety results would suggest 
that the data are insufficient to exclude the possibility of a higher dose being more effective while 
still being safe. Therefore the target dose of 11mg/Kg does not appear to be fully justified. 
However, a Registry will be conducted to further evaluate efficacy with respect to an optimal dose 
as well. 
There are no established criteria defining response to therapy in MCD which complicates the 
interpretation of different treatment modalities. However, the applicant has adopted the approach 
reported in the recent literature which has divided the response into 2 separate components and 
established criteria for improvement in symptoms and laboratory values based on the Cheson 
criteria, which was endorsed by the CHMP in their scientific advice. Accordingly, the study 
implemented a clinically relevant primary endpoint of durable tumour and symptomatic response, 
which was measurable, sensitive, and relevant to the population studied, and tumour response was 
assessed by blinded central review. Patient-reported symptom severity data were also assessed 
using a newly developed disease instrument (Multicentric Castleman’s Disease Symptom Scale 
[MCD-SS]), which was developed and validated based on results of qualitative research with MCD 
patients and clinical experts and subsequently field tested with additional MCD patients before 
study start, as no tools are available for this rare indication. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In the pivotal study a statistically significant difference in independently reviewed durable tumour 
and symptomatic response rate in the siltuximab arm compared with the placebo arm (34% vs. 0%, 
respectively; 95% CI: 11.1, 54.8; p = 0.0012) was observed. 
Three sensitivity analyses were performed to support the primary efficacy endpoint (durable 
tumour and symptomatic response rate using the investigator assessment, durable tumour and 
symptomatic response rate using the independently reviewed assessment without adjusting for the 
stratification factor and tumour and symptomatic response rate using the independently reviewed 
assessments). Results were consistent with the primary analysis, with statistically significant 
improvements in favour to the siltuximab group (45% (95% CI: 23.1, 64.8; p<0.0001), 34% (95% 
CI: 11.1, 54.8; p=0.0004), 38% (95% CI: 15.1, 58.2; p=0.0002), respectively. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/258608/2014 
Page 59/92 
 
  
  
Siltuximab has shown to have a beneficial effect on MCD patients both in terms of durable response 
and symptomatic response as well as maintenance of the effect (longer duration of tumour and 
symptomatic response and time to treatment failure). Although only one of the respondent patients 
had a complete response the effect is considered as clinically relevant in the context of this unmet 
medical need. Siltuximab seems also to contribute to symptomatic control of patients by reducing 
symptoms, and increasing and normalising haemoglobin levels in a substantial percentage of 
patients what is usually associated to symptomatic improvement in chronic conditions. Findings for 
the three PRO instruments used to assess symptoms and functioning also partially support the 
clinical benefit of siltuximab. 
Some imbalances have been observed at baseline between the two groups of treatment. Patients on 
placebo seem more symptomatic than those on siltuximab. Intuitively, placebo patients seem to 
have a poorer prognosis based on symptoms. In fact, the percentage of patients with 6-10 
MCD-related Signs and Symptoms at baseline was higher for placebo than siltuximab (73.1% vs 
51.9%). In addition to that, a higher percentage of placebo patients were pre-treated with 
chemotherapy (antineoplastic agents) than siltuximab subjects (70.6% vs 58.6%) and the median 
time since diagnosis was longer for the placebo group (1.1 years) versus the siltuximab group (0.6 
years). However, according to the severity of the symptom at baseline, siltuximab continues 
showing activity whereas none placebo patients achieved any response. Moreover, an analysis 
according to the primary endpoint between pretreated and naïve to chemotherapy patients, and by 
years since first diagnosis (<0.66 years vs. ≥ 0.66 years) showed that none patient in the placebo 
group met the endpoint in all the analyses carried out. On the contrary, siltuximab patients showed 
a significant benefit regardless the pre-treatment with chemotherapy and the time from the 
diagnosis. 
The different analyses carried out so as to elucidate the impact of these imbalances, suggest that 
these uncertainties do not seem to have any relevance and consequently the effect of siltuximab 
can be deemed robust enough, especially since placebo patients did not achieved any positive 
results according to the definition of the primary endpoint, whereas the effect of siltuximab was 
shown regardless the subgroup analysed (severity of the symptoms, time from diagnosis and 
pre-treated patients). 
In general, this effect is observed in all subgroups studied except in the hyaline histological variant 
for which no effect based on primary endpoint has been shown, even though the antitumour activity 
of siltuximab has been shown in this subgroup. This is reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Data on survival are still immature and no conclusion can be drawn yet. Final OS results will be 
provided for both studies CNTO328MCD2001 and CNTO328MCD2002 according to agreed 
timelines. 
A Registry could provide some further insights into the optimal dose, pharmacogenomics data, 
subgroups together with efficacy and safety data.  
Although only interim results have been provided from the extension study CNTO328MCD2002 for 
the 19 patients who were entered from Study CO328TO3, the results appear to support the 
persistence of efficacy for a median figure of 45 months.

2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The benefit-risk balance of siltuximab for the treatment of non-HIV MCD patients is considered 
favourable in the claimed indication considering the beneficial clinical effect on tumour and 
symptom response that have been observed. This positive effect seems to be maintained over time. 
A Registry could provide some further insights into the optimal dose, pharmacogenomics data, 
subgroups together with efficacy and safety data.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy:

•  A  Registry should be conducted to collect information on patients with Castleman’s 
disease, who are candidates to receive Sylvant or are currently receiving treatment with 
Sylvant. The registry should be continued for the either 100 patients, or 5 years, 
whichever is greater. The MAH should provide tabulated data to the CHMP every 6 months 
in line with the periodic safety update report (PSUR) cycle including data for only those 
patients who are candidates for treatment with siltuximab. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The safety evaluation of siltuximab includes 3 siltuximab monotherapy studies in subjects with MCD 
(N=103 subjects exposed to siltuximab), 7 siltuximab monotherapy studies in subjects with various 
disease types including MCD (N=365 subjects exposed to siltuximab), and 4 siltuximab studies in 
combination with other anticancer agents in multiple myeloma (N=285 subjects exposed to 
siltuximab).  In total, safety data of 650 subjects exposed to siltuximab are included in this safety 
evaluation. 
For completed studies, the clinical cut-off date for each individual study is applied. For ongoing 
studies, a clinical cut-off of 31 January 2013 is used, unless specified otherwise. For ongoing studies 
with a clinical cut-off before 31 January 2013, listings of SAEs that occur between the prior cut-off 
and 31 January 2013 are provided. 
Of the 103 subjects in the integrated MCD studies, 82 subjects were treated with a target dose of 11 
mg/kg siltuximab every 3 weeks and 21 subjects were treated with a non-target dose of siltuximab. 
Thirteen subjects crossed over from receiving placebo to siltuximab treatment in Study 
CNTO328MCD2001; for these subjects, data collected after crossover are included in the target 
dose group. 
•  MCD Monotherapy Studies 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/258608/2014

Siltuximab-treated subjects had a longer duration of treatment; the median treatment duration was 
5 months in the placebo versus 12 months (maximum treatment duration of 6.7 years) and 14 
months (maximum treatment duration of 7.2 years) in the target dose and combined siltuximab 
monotherapy groups, respectively. At the time of the clinical cut-off, more than half (52%) of the 
subjects in the target dose group have received treatment for more than 1 year (>1 to 3 years: 
42% and 36% in the target dose and combined siltuximab monotherapy groups, respectively; >3 
years: 11% and 19%, respectively), indicating that prolonged treatment of MCD subjects with 
siltuximab is tolerable. In siltuximab-treated subjects, the median number of administrations was 
19 and 21 administrations in the target dose and combined siltuximab monotherapy groups, 
respectively; and median cumulative dose of siltuximab was 210 and 222 mg/kg, respectively. 
• 
Pivotal study 
The median number of completed siltuximab infusions was 19 (range 1 to 50 infusions) and 
completed placebo infusions was 8 (range 2 to 32 infusions). Twenty-four subjects (45%) in the 
siltuximab group and 2 subjects (8%) in the placebo group completed >20 administrations. The 
median duration of treatment was 375 days (range 1 to 1031 days) in the siltuximab group and 152 
days (range 23 to 666 days) in the placebo group. The median dose intensity of siltuximab was 
11.06 mg/kg/infusion. 
•  Monotherapy Studies of Various Disease Types 
In the integrated monotherapy studies, a prolonged duration of treatment was also seen in the 
target dose group compared with the placebo group, consistent with that seen in the integrated 
MCD studies; the median duration of treatment was 2 months in the placebo versus 11 months 
(maximum treatment duration of 6.7 years) and 2 months (maximum treatment duration of 7.2 
years) in the target dose and combined siltuximab monotherapy groups, respectively. Almost half 
of all subjects (44% [45/102]) in the target dose group received treatment for more than 1 year 
(>1 to 3 years: 35%; >3 years: 9%). In siltuximab-treated subjects, the median number of 
administrations (17 and 4 administrations, respectively) and median cumulative dose of siltuximab 
(188 and 45 mg/kg, respectively) was higher in the target dose group compared with the combined 
siltuximab monotherapy group 
•  Combination Therapy Studies in Multiple Myeloma 
In the integrated combination therapy studies in multiple myeloma, subjects in both the control and 
siltuximab combination groups had a similar median duration of treatment (8.6 and 6.5 months in 
the control [those treated with other anticancer agents] and siltuximab combination [those treated 
with siltuximab + other anticancer agents] groups, respectively). Thirty-four percent (66/192 
subjects) in the control and 24% (69/285 subjects) in the siltuximab combination groups received 
treatment for 1 or more years. Subjects in the siltuximab combination group received a median of 
12 administrations, with a median cumulative dose of 77 mg/kg.

On the basis of the above databases the following AEs could be considered probably related to 
siltuximab: vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, upper respiratory tract infection, 
nasopharyngitis, localised oedema, oedema peripheral, pruritus, rash maculo-papular, rash, night 
sweats, pyrexia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, weight increased, peripheral sensory neuropathy, 
dizziness, headache, injury, hypertension and procedural complications.  
Hyperuricaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia, and hypokalaemia, skin hyperpigmentation and eczema 
are certainly related to the treatment with siltuximab. 
Renal impairment has been reported in 12% of siltuximab patients and 0% in placebo subjects 
within the MCD monotherapy studies and in 9.4% in siltuximab patients vs 0% in placebo in the 
main study. 
With regard to AEs grade 3 or higher into the study CNTO328MCD2001, twenty-five subjects (47%) 
in the siltuximab group and 14 subjects (54%) in the placebo group had Grade 3 or higher AEs. AEs 
classified in the following SOCs were the most frequently reported (≥10% of subjects) in the 
siltuximab group: Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders (9 subjects; 17%), General Disorders and 
Administration Site Conditions (8 subjects; 15%), and Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders (6 
subjects; 11%). AEs classified in the following SOCs were the most frequently reported (≥10% of 
subjects) in the placebo group: Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders (5 subjects; 19%), 
Infections and Infestations (4 subjects; 15%), and Gastrointestinal disorders (3 subjects; 12%). In 
the placebo group, anemia (reported in 12% of subjects) was the only Grade 3 or higher AE that 
was reported in more than 1 subject. 
Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) 
Infections (including upper respiratory tract infections), pruritus, and maculopapular rash were the 
most common adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported in Castleman’s disease (CD) clinical studies 
occurring in > 20% of siltuximab-treated patients. The most serious ADR associated with the use of 
siltuximab was anaphlyactic reaction. 
Table 12 reflects the frequencies of identified ADRs in the 82 MCD patients (studies C0328T03 and  
CNTO328MCD2002) treated at the recommended dose of 11 mg/kg every 3 weeks.

Adverse Events of special interest (AESI) 
• 
Infections 
The incidence of infections and infestations of any grade was higher in siltuximab-treated subjects 
compared with placebo-treated subjects in the MCD population (35% in the placebo vs 68% and 
71% in the target dose and combined siltuximab monotherapy groups, respectively). However, the 
rate of infections and infestations of any grade were similar when adjusted for treatment duration 
(1.24 vs 1.34 and 1.57 events per patient years). The incidence of infections and infestations SAEs, 
Grade 3 or higher AEs, and AEs of leading to dose delay or dose interruption in siltuximab-treated 
subjects was similar to placebo-treated subjects (SAEs: 12% vs 7% and 8%, respectively; Grade 3 
or higher infections: 15% vs 10% and 12%, respectively; dose delay or dose interruption: 4% vs 
9% and 11%, respectively). In the MCD studies, there were no treatment discontinuations and no 
deaths due to infections in siltuximab-treated subjects. 
In the pivotal study, AEs of all grades classified in the Infections and Infestations SOC were reported 
in 35 subjects (66%) in the siltuximab group and 9 subjects (35%) in the placebo group. Across 
both treatment groups, upper respiratory tract infection was the most frequently reported infection 
AE (19 subjects [36%] in the siltuximab group and 4 subjects [15%] in the placebo group). After 
adjusting for exposure, the incidence of AEs were similar, with Grade 3 or higher AEs (0.11 vs 0.26) 
and SAEs (0.08 vs 0.20) being numerically lower among subjects in the siltuximab group than in the 
placebo group, respectively. More infection AEs with an outcome of treatment interruption were 
reported in the siltuximab group compared with the placebo group.  
Grade 3 and higher AEs classified in the Infections and Infestations SOC were reported in 5 subjects 
(9%) in the siltuximab group and 4 subjects (15%) in the placebo group. SAEs classified in the 
Infections and Infestations SOC were reported in 4 subjects (8%) in the siltuximab group and 3 
subjects (12%) in the placebo group. AEs classified in the Infections and Infestations SOC leading 
to dose delays of siltuximab or placebo were reported in 4 subjects (8%) in the siltuximab group 
and 1 subject (4%) in the placebo group, respectively. No subject in either group had an infection 
AE that led to discontinuation of study agent. 
•  Neutropenia 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/258608/2014 
Page 66/92 
 
  
  
In the pool of safety population treated with siltuximab, a similar incidence of all-grade neutropenia 
was reported as an AE in siltuximab-treated subjects compared with placebo-treated subjects (8% 
in the placebo vs 11% and 12% in the target dose and combined siltuximab monotherapy groups, 
respectively). Grade 3 or higher neutropenia was low and similar to placebo (4% vs 4% each). No 
increase in dose delay or dose interruption due to neutropenia was observed (4% vs 4% and 3%, 
respectively). No SAEs, treatment discontinuations, or deaths due to neutropenia were seen. 
Febrile neutropenia was not reported and colony-stimulating factor use was low (≤5%) and similar 
in siltuximab-treated subjects (4% vs 1% and 2%, respectively). 
In the main study, Grade 3 neutrophil abnormalities were observed in 2 subjects (4%) in the 
siltuximab group and 1 subject (4%) in the placebo group; no Grade 4 neutrophil abnormalities 
were observed in either treatment group during the study. AEs of the preferred term neutropenia 
and of all grades were reported in 7 subjects (13%) in the siltuximab group and 2 subjects (8%) in 
the placebo group. Colony stimulating factor use (filgrastim) was reported in 1 subject (4%) in the 
placebo group. Grade 3 neutropenia was reported as an adverse event in 2 subjects (4%) in the 
siltuximab group and 1 subject (4%) in the placebo group; these events resulted in interruption of 
study agent. No SAEs of neutropenia were reported in either treatment group; no subject in either 
treatment group discontinued treatment due to neutropenia. 
• 
Thrombocytopenia 
A higher incidence of all-grade thrombocytopenia was seen in siltuximab-treated subjects 
compared with placebo-treated subjects (4% in the placebo vs 13% and 15% in the target dose and 
combined siltuximab monotherapy groups, respectively). However, Grade 3 or higher 
thrombocytopenia was low and similar among the groups (4% vs 2% and 2%, respectively). Dose 
delays or dose interruptions due to thrombocytopenia were infrequent (0% vs 1% each in the target 
dose and combined siltuximab monotherapy groups) and there were no SAEs, treatment 
discontinuations, or deaths due to thrombocytopenia. One siltuximab-treated subject with MCD 
from Study C0328T03 received a platelet transfusion for a SAE of autoimmune thrombocytopenia 
during extended dosing Week 2 and 1 placebo-treated subject from Study CNTO328MCD2001 had 
thrombocyte transfusions at the time of discontinuation of blinded study treatment; the subject was 
diagnosed with MDS. No severe bleeding events were observed. 
In the pivotal study no Grade 4 platelet abnormality was observed in the siltuximab group, 1 subject 
(4%) in the placebo group had Grade 4 platelet abnormalities; 2 subjects (4%) and no subject, 
respectively had Grade 3 platelet abnormalities during the study. AEs of the preferred term 
thrombocytopenia were reported in 8 subjects (15%) in the siltuximab group and 1 subject (4%) in 
the placebo group. One subject (2%) in the siltuximab group and no subject in the placebo group 
had an AE of thrombocytopenia that resulted in interruption of study agent. 
No SAEs of thrombocytopenia were reported in either treatment group; no subject in either 
treatment group discontinued treatment due to thrombocytopenia. Thrombocyte transfusions were 
provided to 1 subject in the placebo group. No AEs of severe bleedings were reported in any subject 
in the study. 
• 
Elevations in Triglycerides and Cholesterol 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/258608/2014 
Page 67/92 
 
  
  
A higher incidence of all-grade hypertriglyceridemia was reported as an AE in siltuximab-treated 
subjects compared with placebo-treated subjects (0% in the placebo vs 13% and 18% in the target 
dose and combined siltuximab monotherapy groups, respectively). However, the incidence of 
Grade 3 or higher triglyceride increase was low in siltuximab-treated groups and similar to placebo 
(0% vs 2% and 3%, respectively). One subject in the combined siltuximab monotherapy group (at 
the non target dose; ie, 15 mg/kg every 4 weeks) had a dose delay due to hypertriglyceridemia. No 
SAEs, treatment discontinuations, or deaths due to hypertriglyceridemia were reported. 
Within the pivotal trial, in the siltuximab group, AEs of the preferred term hypertriglyceridemia of 
any grade were reported in 6 subjects (11%), and AEs of the preferred term hypercholesterolemia 
of any grade were reported in 3 subjects (6%). No subject in the placebo group had an event of 
hypertriglyceridemia or hypercholesterolemia during the study. One subject (2%) in the siltuximab 
group had Grade 3 hypertriglyceridemia. No SAEs of hypertriglyceridemia or hypercholesterolemia 
were reported; no subject had a hypertriglyceridemia or hypercholesterolemia AE that led to 
treatment interruption or treatment discontinuation 
A higher incidence of all-grade hypercholesterolemia was seen among siltuximab-treated subjects 
(0% vs 9% and 13%, respectively); there were no Grade 3 or higher AEs, SAEs, treatment 
discontinuations, dose delays/dose interruptions, or deaths due to hypercholesterolemia. 
In the main study, there were no shifts in increases in cholesterol values from Grade 0 or 1 at 
baseline to Grades 3 or 4 during the study in either treatment group. 
•  Vascular disorders 
There was a higher incidence of vascular disorders (4% vs 23% and 29%, respectively) observed in 
the MCD studies; however, Grade 3 or higher AEs, SAEs, treatment discontinuations, dose 
delays/dose interruptions were low and similar across the groups. In the main study vascular 
disorders were more frequently reported for siltuximab treated patients (15.1% vs 3.8%). 
•  Renal impairment 
A numerically higher incidence of all-grade renal impairment was reported as an AE in 
siltuximab-treated subjects compared with placebo-treated subjects in the MCD studies (0% vs 
12% and 14%, respectively). However, the incidence of Grade 3 or higher renal impairment was 
low and similar among the groups (0% vs 2% each; 0% vs 1% each in the pivotal trial). Dose delays 
due to renal impairment were low in siltuximab-treated subjects (0% vs 1% each). There were no 
SAEs, treatment discontinuations, or deaths due to renal impairment. Within the main study, renal 
impairment was reported in 9.4% in siltuximab patients vs 0% in placebo. There was a SAE related 
to renal disease in the siltuximab arm vs 0 in the placebo group. 
•  Gastrointestinal Perforations 
There were no GI perforations reported in siltuximab-treated subjects in the MCD population. In the 
siltuximab monotherapy studies, GI perforations occurred in 3 subjects (<1%) with other cancer 
types and confounding factors (eg, GI cancer, medical history of diverticulitis, and prior treatment 
with bevacizumab use), and those that were reported were considered not related or doubtfully 
related to study drug. 
• 
Primary Malignancy or Second Primary Malignancy 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/258608/2014 
Page 68/92 
 
  
  
In the integrated monotherapy studies, no increase in the incidence of malignancy was observed in 
siltuximab-treated subjects compared with placebo-treated subjects (4% [2/52] in the placebo 
group and <1% [2/365] in the combined siltuximab monotherapy group). Grade 4 malignancies 
(T-cell lymphoma and MDS) were observed in 2 subjects with MCD in the placebo group; of which, 
1 malignancy (T cell lymphoma) was considered serious. One subject with MCD (originally assigned 
to siltuximab 11 mg/kg every 3 weeks) reported a Grade 2 squamous cell carcinoma of the skin on 
Study Day 380, 20 days since the last infusion of study drug. 
• 
Infusion Related Reactions 
Infusion related reactions, among those subjects with infusion related reactions collected (from 
Studies CNTO328MCD2001, CNTO328MCD2002, CNTO328STM2001, CNTO328SMM1001, and 
CNTO328MDS2001), were 1.9% [1/52] in the placebo group vs 4.9% [4/81] and 4.8% [12/249] in 
the target dose and combined siltuximab monotherapy groups, respectively. The most common 
infusion related reactions reported in siltuximab-treated subjects (≥2 subjects) were pruritus, 
erythema, chest pain, and nausea. 
In the pivotal trial, four subjects (8%) in the siltuximab group and no subject in the placebo group 
had at least 1 infusion-related reaction AE of any grade reported. One patient had a serious Grade 
3 anaphylactic reaction. All other infusion-related reaction AEs, which included erythema, pruritus, 
chest discomfort, headache, and flushing, were Grade 1 or 2. Four infusion-related reaction 
samples were collected from 3 subjects and assessed for immunogenicity. None of the samples had 
detectable antibodies to siltuximab. 
•  Hepatotoxicity 
No subject in either treatment group had an AE classified as hepatotoxicity during the main study. 
There were no shifts from Grade 0 or 1 at baseline to Grades 3 or 4 during the study in AST, ALT, 
or bilirubin values in either treatment group. Two subjects (4%) in the siltuximab group had a shift 
in bilirubin values from Grade 0 at baseline to Grade 2 during the study; 1 subject (2%) had a shift 
in AST values from Grade 0 at baseline to Grade 2 during the study. 
In the integrated monotherapy studies, no subjects met Hy’s law criteria Grade 3 or higher 
elevations in bilirubin, AST, and ALT were infrequent (Grade 3 bilirubin increase: 0% in the placebo 
group vs 0% and 2% in the target dose and combined siltuximab monotherapy groups, 
respectively; Grade 4 bilirubin increase: 0% vs 0% and <1%, respectively; Grade 3 AST increase: 
2% vs 1% and 3%, respectively; Grade 4 AST increase: 0% all groups; Grade 3 ALT increase: 2% 
vs 0% and 3%, respectively; Grade 4 ALT increase: 0% all groups). There were no deaths due to 
hepatic events and no treatment discontinuations in the placebo or siltuximab target dose groups. 
In the integrated MCD studies, no siltuximab-treated subjects had Grade 3 or higher bilirubin 
increases and Grade 3 elevations in transaminases were infrequent (Grade 3 AST increase: 0% vs 
1% each; Grade 3 ALT increase: 0% vs 0% and 1%, respectively; Grade 4 AST or ALT increase: 0% 
all groups;). There were no deaths or treatment discontinuations due to hepatic events. Dose 
delays or dose interruptions due to hepatobiliary disorders were low and similar across the groups 
(hepatic function abnormal: 0% vs 2% each; hyperbilirubinemia: 0% vs 1% each).

Electrocardiograms in the CNTO328MCD2001 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/258608/2014 
Page 69/92 
 
  
  
Mean baseline QTcF values were 414 ms (range 364 to 460 ms) in the siltuximab group and 416 ms 
(range 368 to 489 ms) in the placebo group. Mean changes from baseline at any assessment 
timepoint were similar between the 2 treatment groups and ranged from -0.7 to 8.8 in the 
siltuximab group and 0 to 8.5 in the placebo group. No subject in either treatment group had a QTcF 
>500 msec postbaseline. Five of 46 subjects (11%) in the siltuximab group and 2 of 23 subjects 
(9%) in the placebo group had a change from baseline in QTcF >30 ms and <60 ms. One subject 
(2%) in the siltuximab group had a change from baseline of 80 ms, which was reported at the end 
of treatment (33 days after the last dose). No other relevant increases in QTcF from baseline were 
reported for this subject. 
Mean baseline QTcB values were 432 ms (range 386 to 478 ms) in the siltuximab group and 432 ms 
(range 397 to 520 ms) in the placebo group. Mean changes from baseline at any assessment 
timepoint during the study were similar and ranged from -9.2 to 4.6 in the siltuximab group and 0 
to 17.2 in the placebo group. Four of 46 subjects (9%) in the siltuximab group and 2 of 23 subjects 
(9%) in the placebo group had a change from baseline in QTcB >30 ms and <60 ms . One subject 
(2%) in the siltuximab group had a change from baseline of 81 ms, which was reported at the end 
of treatment (33 days after the last dose). No other relevant increases in QTcB from baseline were 
reported for this subject. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
In the integrated MCD studies, more (≥5%) treatment-emergent SAEs were reported in 
siltuximab-treated subjects compared with those treated with placebo (19% in the placebo vs 26% 
and 25% in the target dose and combined siltuximab monotherapy groups, respectively). However, 
the higher SAE rate in siltuximab-treated subjects wasn’t driven by any particular SOC. In the 
placebo group, 2 subjects reported an SAE of dyspnea in the integrated MCD studies; otherwise, all 
other SAEs in the placebo group were reported in 1 subject each (pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, 
lung infection, pleural effusion, dysphagia, peripheral edema, congestive cardiac failure, and T-cell 
lymphoma). In the target dose group, all individual SAEs were observed in 1 subject each (1% of 
subjects). 
In the integrated monotherapy studies, treatment-emergent SAEs were also higher (≥5%) in 
siltuximab-treated subjects compared with placebo (23% in the placebo vs 28% and 28% in the 
target dose and combined siltuximab monotherapy groups, respectively); the highest incidence of 
treatment-emergent SAEs was within the infections and infestations SOC (8% vs 11% and 8%, 
respectively). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/258608/2014 
Page 70/92 
 
  
  
In the pivotal trial, SAEs were reported in 12 subjects (23%) in the siltuximab group and 5 subjects 
(19%) in the placebo group. Across both treatment groups, SAEs classified in the infections and 
infestations SOC were the most frequently reported (4 subjects [8%] in the siltuximab group and 3 
subjects [12%] in the placebo group). These SAEs were all Grade 3 or higher. SAEs classified in the 
Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal disorders were reported in no subject in the siltuximab group 
and 3 subjects (12%) in the placebo group; with the exception of dyspnea, which was reported in 
no subject and 2 subjects (8%), respectively, no preferred term was reported in more than 1 
subject in either treatment group. One subject (2%) in the siltuximab group had an SAE of 
anaphylactic reaction. SAEs considered reasonably related to study agent were reported in 3 
subjects (6%) in the siltuximab group and 1 subject (4%) in the placebo group; these events were 
all Grade 3 or higher. 
A similar trend was seen with the integrated combination therapy studies; a higher (≥5%) 
incidence of treatment-emergent SAEs was observed in the siltuximab combination group 
compared with the control group (37% and 42% in the control and siltuximab combination groups); 
the highest incidence of SAEs was in the infections and infestations SOC (15% and 17%, 
respectively). 
Deaths 
In the integrated MCD studies, the incidence of deaths within 30 days of the last dose of study 
treatment was low (4% in the placebo group vs 0% and 1% in the target dose and combined 
siltuximab monotherapy groups, respectively); 1 subject in the placebo group and 1 subject in the 
non-target siltuximab dose group died within 30 days of last dose. No other siltuximab-treated 
subjects died within 30 days of last dose and there were no TEAEs leading to death considered 
reasonably related to siltuximab. 
In the pivotal study, two subjects (4%) in the siltuximab group and 4 subjects (15%) in the placebo 
group died. The primary cause of death for all subjects except one in the placebo group was disease 
progression.  
According to the data from Monotherapy studies in various disease type 6.0% of patients treated 
with a higher dose of 11 mg/kg of siltuximab died vs 3.8% in placebo.  
Laboratory findings 
A summary of the haematology and chemistry toxicity grades during the blinded treatment period 
is presented in Table 13.

Grade 3 hematologic laboratory abnormalities occurred at a low incidence in both treatment 
groups; no Grade 4 hematologic laboratory abnormality was observed in the siltuximab group. The 
most frequently observed Grade 3 hematologic abnormalities across both treatment groups were 
lymphocyte decreases: 3 subjects (6%) in the siltuximab group and 2 subjects (8%) in the placebo 
group. Grade 3 hemoglobin decreases were observed in 1 subject (2%) in the siltuximab group and 
3 subjects (12%) in the placebo group; Grade 3 neutrophil decreases were observed in 2 subjects 
(4%) and 1 subject (4%), respectively. Grade 3 platelet decreases were observed in 2 subjects 
(4%) in the siltuximab group, and Grade 4 platelet decreases were observed in 1 subject (4%) in 
the placebo group. 
Grade 3 chemistry laboratory abnormalities occurred at a low incidence in both treatment groups; 
no Grade 4 chemistry laboratory abnormality was observed in the siltuximab or placebo group. The 
most frequently observed Grade 3 chemistry abnormalities in the siltuximab group were 
hyperkalemia (3 subjects; 6%) and triglyceride increases (2 subjects; 4%). The most frequently 
observed Grade 3 chemistry abnormalities in the placebo group were hypokalemia and triglyceride 
increases (each observed in 1 subject [4%]). Of note, no Grades 3 or 4 increases in any liver 
function test (AST, ALT, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase) were observed in the siltuximab or placebo 
group. Grade 2 creatinine increases were observed in 8 subjects (15%) in the siltuximab group and 
2 subjects (8%) in the placebo group. 
Safety in special populations 
A population PK analysis in order to evaluate the influence of intrinsic factors (age, gender, body 
weight, ethnicity, renal and hepatic functions) on PK was submitted.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/258608/2014 
Page 72/92 
 
 
 
  
  
The analysis carried out in special populations did not reveal any concerns in relation to gender and 
age, even though the low number of patients above 65 years (the majority of subjects in the 
integrated MCD studies were <65 years) clearly hampers to reach any conclusions in older people. 
Important safety information regarding the elderly population is in presented in the following Table

PT = Preferred term (MedDRA). 
Asian subset of patients seems to be less susceptible to grade 3 AEs, SAEs and AEs leading to dose 
delay or dose interruption.  
Regarding the renal impairment, again the low number of patients with abnormal baseline renal 
function appears to complicate the assessment in this subset. Renal impairment is one of AEs 
associated to siltuximab. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/258608/2014 
Page 73/92 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
In the subgroup of mild hepatic impairment population, there seem to be more Grade 3 or higher 
AEs (75% mild vs 56% overall) and SAEs (38% mild vs 28% overall) compared with the overall 
population. According to the laboratory findings, siltuximab increases the levels of hepatic enzymes 
(bilirubin, ALT & AST), so mild-severe hepatic population could be more susceptible of having AEs. 
No safety data of siltuximab in paediatric patients are available, as there is no relevant use of 
Sylvant in paediatric patients in the Castleman’s disease indication. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No drug-drug interaction studies were submitted (see discussion on clinical pharmacology).  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Twenty-two subjects (42%) in the siltuximab group and 20 subjects (77%) in the placebo group 
discontinued treatment prematurely within the main study. The most common reason for treatment 
discontinuation was disease progression, which was reported in 16 of 53 subjects (30%) in the 
siltuximab group and 14 of 26 subjects (54%) in the placebo group; 1 subject in each treatment 
group (2% and 4%, respectively), discontinued due to an AE. Two subjects (8%) in the placebo 
group discontinued due to death. 
It was allowable to delay treatment for up to 3 weeks. No more than 2 nonconsecutive dose delays 
caused by study agent-related toxicity were allowed for each subject during the first 48 weeks of 
treatment. No dose modification (increase or decrease) was to be permitted. In the pivotal trial, AEs 
leading to treatment interruption were reported in 15 subjects (28%) in the siltuximab group and 5 
subjects (19%) in the placebo group.  
The most frequently reported AEs leading to dose delays were AEs classified in the Blood and 
Lymphatic System Disorders SOC (3 subjects [6%] in the siltuximab group and 2 subjects [8%] in 
the placebo group), followed by AEs classified in the Infections and Infestations SOC (4 subjects 
[8%] vs 1 subject [4%]), AEs classified in the Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders SOC (4 
subjects [8%] vs no subject), and AEs classified in the General Disorders and Administration Site 
Conditions SOC (3 subjects [6%] vs no subject), respectively. Infections and neutropenia are 
almost 50% of the AEs leading to dose delays for siltuximab arm. 
The same pattern is observed in the monotherapy studies, a higher percentage of patients with 
dose delays in the siltuximab's groups.

Discussion on clinical safety 
The applicant has submitted an integrated summary of safety as supportive evidence by including 
data from other studies either as monotherapy or combined with chemotherapy in myeloma, MDS, 
MCD as well as solid tumours.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/258608/2014

The safety database is limited and consists of a number of small studies in various disease groups. 
However, despite the fact that 650 patients have been exposed to siltuximab, there is a 
comparatively small number of patients who have been exposed in the target population (103 
patients) and an even smaller number at the target dose (82 patients).  
Focusing on MCD studies, Siltuximab has been administered with a median duration of 12 months 
(maximum treatment duration of 6.7 years) in the target dose. At the time of the clinical cut-off, 
more than half (52%) of the subjects in the target dose group have received treatment for more 
than 1 year.  
Regarding the AEs described in the main study, the most frequently reported AEs in the siltuximab 
group were pruritus, upper respiratory tract infection, rash maculo-papular and fatigue, and 
peripheral edema.  
Pruritus, upper respiratory tract infection, rash maculo-papular, localized edema, weight increased, 
abdominal pain, infusion related reactions, nasopharyngitis, thrombocytopenia, renal impairment, 
hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, neutropenia, and anaphylactic reaction, have been identified 
as ADRs for siltuximab (section 4.8 of the SmPC). 
With regard to AEs grade 3 or higher into the study CNTO328MCD2001, twenty-five subjects (47%) 
in the siltuximab group and 14 subjects (54%) in the placebo group had Grade 3 or higher AEs. 
SAEs were reported in 12 subjects (23%) in the siltuximab group and 5 subjects (19%) in the 
placebo group. No deaths related to treatment were identified in the pivotal trial. 
There were more discontinuations in the placebo group than in the siltuximab arm (77% vs 42%). 
The main reason was disease progression. Only 1 patient treated with siltuximab discontinued due 
to AE.  
No dose modification was to be permitted. Nevertheless, the percentage of treatment interruptions 
due to AEs was higher for siltuximab group (28% vs 19%) than placebo, with Infections and 
infestations (7.5% vs 3.8%; siltuximab and placebo respectively) and Skin and subcutaneous 
tissue disorders (7.5 % vs 0%) as main reasons for that. 
Immunomodulatory medicinal products may increase the risk of malignancy. On the basis of limited 
experience with siltuximab the present data do not suggest any increased risk of malignancy 
(section 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Gastrointestinal (GI) perforation has been reported in siltuximab clinical trials although not in MCD 
trials. Use with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for GI perforation. Promptly 
evaluate patients presenting with symptoms that may be associated with or suggestive of GI 
perforation (section 4.4 of the SmPC).

Laboratory findings are reflecting part of the mechanism of action of siltuximab and its safety 
profile. Decreases were observed during the treatment with siltuximab in platelet values, 
neutrophils and slightly in alkaline phosphatase. On the contrary, increases were reported in 
haemoglobin, bilirubin, ALT & AST, lymphocytes and albumin. These findings are a clear reflect of 
special AEs described for siltuximab, such as a higher incidence of all-grade thrombocytopenia, 
neutropenia, hypertriglyceridemia and renal impairment. Of note, worst CTC grade during 
treatment for hematology was not significantly higher for siltuximab, with similar proportion of 
grade 3-4 of laboratory findings. Nevertheless, regarding the chemistry laboratory findings, apart 
from grade 3 in triglyceride increases (4% vs 4%) grade 3 abnormalities were described for 
siltuximab patients in hyperkalemia (6%) and grade 2 in creatinine increases (15% vs 8% 
siltuximab and placebo respectively). 
Hemoglobin increases above the ULN were observed in the MCD studies (15% [12/82] at the target 
dose, 14% [3/21] at the non-target dose, and 4% [1/26] with placebo) and 4 subjects had 
hemoglobin-related AEs, which did not result in treatment discontinuation. There were no 
thrombovascular or ischemic events associated with these hemoglobin elevations. 
With regard to the increases of hepatic enzymes, no siltuximab-treated subject had Grade 3 or 
higher bilirubin increases. Few Grade 3 elevations in transaminases were observed in 
siltuximab-treated subjects (Grade 3 AST: 0% in the placebo vs 1 in the target dose respectively; 
Grade 3 ALT: 0% vs 0% respectively). There were no discontinuations or deaths due to hepatic 
events. Dose delays or dose interruptions due to hepatobiliary disorders were as follows: hepatic 
function abnormal: 0% in the placebo vs 2% the target dose respectively and hyperbilirubinemia: 
0% vs 1% respectively). 
There is not conclusive data about the possible association between treatment with siltuximab and 
incidence of AEs and SAEs. However it cannot be excluded that patients with liver impairment may 
experience higher-grade AEs and SAEs compared with the overall population. Patients treated with 
siltuximab with known liver impairment as well as patients with elevated transaminase or elevated 
bilirubin should be monitored. 
Although siltuximab corrected hyperimmunoglobulinaemia in 23-53% of patients, the incidence of 
hypoglobulinaemia occurred in 4-11.3% of patients. Hypoglobulinaemia was observed in 4 to 
11.3% of patients in the clinical study. Decreases in total IgG, IgA, or IgM levels below normal were 
observed in the range of 4 to 11% patients in the pivotal trial (section 4.4 of the SmPC). 
All clinical studies with siltuximab excluded patients with clinically significant infections, including 
those known to be hepatitis B surface antigen positive. Two cases of reactivated hepatitis B have 
been reported when sylvant was administered concomitantly with high dose dexamethasone, and 
bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone in multiple myeloma patients (section 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Sylvant may mask signs and symptoms of acute inflammation including suppression of fever and of 
acute-phase reactants, such as C-reactive protein (CRP). Therefore, prescribers should diligently 
monitor patients receiving treatment in order to detect serious infections (section 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Live, attentuated vaccines should not be given concurrently or within 4 weeks before initiating 
siltuximab as clinical safety has not been established (section 4.4 of the SmPC). 
No case of overdose has been reported. Repeated dosing of 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks has been 
administered without additional adverse drug reactions (section 4.9 of the SmPC).

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in 
the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.1.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Although the safety profile appears to be acceptable in the short term, there is a lack of data with 
respect to long term safety since only 19 patients have been entered into the phase II extension 
study CNTO328MCD2002. A Registry will be conducted to address this issue and collect additional 
safety data.  
In conclusion, even considering the limited sample of the safety database and the uncertainties 
related to the long-term safety and tolerability, overall, the safety profile is considered acceptable 
and tolerable.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
•  A  Registry should be conducted to collect information on patients with Castleman’s disease, 
who are candidates to receive Sylvant or are currently receiving treatment with Sylvant. 
The registry should be continued for the either 100 patients, or 5 years, whichever is 
greater. The MAH should provide tabulated data to the CHMP every 6 months in line with 
the periodic safety update report (PSUR) cycle including data for only those patients who 
are candidates for treatment with siltuximab. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance

Evaluate the Safety of Long-term 
Treatment with SYLVANT in Subjects with 
Multicentric Castleman’s Disease 
The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed 
post-authorisation PhV development plan is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the 
product. The PRAC also recommended that following the completion of study CNTO328MCD2002 
the patients which are included in that study should be enrolled in a registry to further evaluate the 
long term safety of Sylvant. 
The PRAC finally considered that routine PhV is sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of the risk 
minimisation measures.

immunomodulatory medicinal products 
may increase the risk of malignancy. On the 
basis of limited experience with SYLVANT 
the present data do not suggest any 
increased risk of malignancy. 
SmPC Section 4.2 provides treatment 
guidance for any severe 
non-haematological toxicity and criteria for 
permanent discontinuation are also 
provided. SmPC Section 4.4 specifies that 
gastrointestinal (GI) perforation has been 
reported in SYLVANT clinical trials although 
not in MCD trials. The SmPC also advises to 
use with caution in patients who may be at 
increased risk for GI perforation and to 
promptly evaluate patients presenting with 
symptoms that may be associated with or 
suggestive of GI perforation 
SmPC Section 5.2 specifies that as with all 
therapeutic proteins, there is potential for 
the generation of anti-medicine antibodies 
(immunogenicity). Further immunogenicity 
analyses of the single positive sample 
revealed a low titer of anti-SYLVANT 
antibodies (1:20) with non-neutralizing 
capabilities. No evidence of altered toxicity 
profile was identified in the 1patient who 
developed antibodies to SYLVANT. 
There are no data on the use of SYLVANT in 
pregnant women and it is unknown whether 
SYLVANT is excreted in human milk (SmPC 
Section 4.6); women of childbearing 
potential must use contraception during and 
up to 3 months after treatment (SmPC 
Section 4.6). Guidance is provided on 
weighing the benefits and risks of giving 
SYLVANT to a woman who is 
breast-feeding. Nonclinical studies did not 
show effects on reproduction or fertility 
(SmPC Sections 4.6 and 5.3).

No major age-related differences in 
pharmacokinetics or in the safety profile 
were observed in clinical trials, and dose 
adjustment is not required for older patients 
(SmPC Sections 4.2 and 5.2). Few subjects 
>65 years of age were studied in MCD 
clinical trials (SmPC Section 5.1). 
The safety and efficacy in children aged 17 
years and younger have not been 
established (SmPC Section 4.2 and 5.2). 
SYLVANT is not indicated for this population 
(SmPC Section 4.1). 
SYLVANT is not indicated for this population 
(SmPC Section 4.1). 
Live, attenuated vaccines should not be 
given concurrently or within 4 weeks before 
initiating SYLVANT, as the safety has not 
been established (SmPC Section 4.4). 
Caution is also advised in the administration 
of live vaccines to infants born to women 
treated with SYLVANT (SmPC Section 4.6). 
In nonclinical studies, IL-6 is known to 
decrease the activity of CYP450; therefore, 
binding IL-6 with SYLVANT may result in 
increased metabolism of CYP450 substrates 
(enzyme activity will normalise) (SmPC 
Section 4.5). Caution is advised when 
co-administered with medicinal products 
that are CYP450 substrates and have a 
narrow therapeutic index. In addition, 
caution is also advised where a decrease in 
effectiveness would be undesirable (eg, oral 
contraceptives). 
No formal trial of the effect of hepatic 
impairment on the pharmacokinetics of 
SYLVANT has been conducted (SmPC 
Sections 4.2 and 5.2). Patients with 
abnormal baseline alanine transaminase, 
baseline albumin, baseline bilirubin levels 
showed no meaningful effect on SYLVANT 
pharmaco-kinetics (SmPC Section 5.2). 
SmPC Section 4.2 provides treatment 
guidance for any severe 
non-haematological toxicity and criteria for 
permanent discontinuation are also 
provided. 
The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed risk 
minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indication.  
The CHMP endorsed this advice with changes. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/258608/2014 
Page 82/92 
 
 
  
  
These changes concerned the following elements of the Risk Management Plan: 
The Pharmacovigilance Plan for which the CHMP considered that the proposed registry to collect 
additional long term safety data should commence now rather than after the completion of the 
ongoing study CNTO328MCD2002. 
The CHMP justified these changes as follows: Despite the rarity of the proposed indication the CHMP 
considered that it was feasible to conduct simultaneously two studies which would enable a more 
robust collection of long term safety data for Sylvant. In addition, only 19 patients have been 
entered into the phase II extension study CNTO328MCD2002 whereas the registry will include 100 
patients.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The results of the pivotal study, showed a statistically significant improvement in the primary 
endpoint of durable tumour and symptomatic response rate for siltuximab plus BSC compared with 
placebo plus BSC (34% vs. 0%, respectively; 95% CI: 11.1-54.8; p = 0.0012).  
The results from the secondary endpoints are consistent with the primary endpoint: Siltuximab has 
shown to have a beneficial effect on MCD patients in terms of maintenance of the effect (longer 
duration of tumour and symptomatic response and time to treatment failure). In the siltuximab 
group, the median duration of tumour and symptomatic response was 340 days (range 55 to 676 
days) based on the independent review. The median time to treatment failure was not reached in 
the siltuximab group and was 134 days in the placebo group (HR: 0.418; 95% CI: 0.214-0.815; 
p=0.0084). 
The overall tumour response rate was 37.7% in the siltuximab group and 3.8% in the placebo 
group. The difference in the overall tumour response rate was 33.9% (95% CI: 11.1, 54.8; 
p=0.0022). Overall, the clinical data provided can be considered comprehensive.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/258608/2014 
Page 85/92 
 
  
  
Siltuximab also contributes to symptomatic control of patients by reducing symptoms, and by 
increasing and normalising haemoglobin levels in a substantial percentage of patients what is 
usually associated to symptomatic improvement in chronic conditions. The ≥ 15 g/L haemoglobin 
response rate was 61.3% in the siltuximab group and 0% in the placebo group (95% CI: 28.3-85.1; 
p=0.0002). Thirteen subjects in the siltuximab group and no subject in the placebo group had a ≥
20 g/L haemoglobin response. The ≥ 20 g/L haemoglobin response rate was 41.9 % in the 
siltuximab group and 0% in the placebo group (95% CI: 7.8-70.7; p=0.0195). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The rationale for selection of the proposed dosage regimen focuses purely on the ability to suppress 
CRP levels to <1mg, nevertheless, the dose finding study clearly showed that there was no clinical 
correlation  with  CRP  suppression.  Similar  to  the  lack  of  clinical  correlation  of  CRP  in  study 
CO328TO3, no clear cut clinical correlation was observed in the pivotal study CNTO328MCD2001. 
These  similar  findings  from  both  clinical  studies  do  not  fully  support  the  justification  of  dose 
selection on the basis of CRP suppression. The individual patient data clearly indicate that baseline 
CRP levels or suppression of CRP levels post-treatment were not strongly associated with tumour 
responses,  likely  due  to  factors  other  than  CRP  (and  IL-6)  that  possibly  control  MCD  disease 
pathogenesis. In this respect the use of CRP suppression to determine the optimum dose may not 
be appropriate. However, a Registry will be conducted to further evaluate efficacy with respect to an 
optimal dose. 
For the primary endpoint analysis in the main study, no subject in the hyaline vascular histology 
subgroup had a durable tumour and symptomatic response according to the definition of the main 
variable  in  either  treatment  group.  This  constitutes  an  uncertainty  for  the  knowledge  of  the 
beneficial  effect  of  siltuximab  in  MCD  patients,  probably  reflecting  a  lower  efficacy  rate  in  this 
histological subtype. However, a positive treatment effect across all major secondary endpoints was 
consistently shown among siltuximab-treated subjects in the hyaline vascular subgroup, that were 
less  pronounced  than  in  the  overall  population  (eg,  investigator-assessed  tumour  response, 
haemoglobin response, median time to treatment failure, and median time to next treatment). This 
information is reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Data on survival are still immature. Final OS results will be provided according to agreed timelines 
(see discussion on Clinical Efficacy). 
A Registry could provide some further insights into the optimal dose, pharmacogenomics data, 
subgroups together with efficacy data.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The most frequently reported AEs in the siltuximab group were pruritus (22 subjects; 42%), upper 
respiratory tract infection (19 subjects; 36%), rash maculo-papular and fatigue (18 subjects each; 
34%), and peripheral oedema (17 subjects; 32%). 
Pruritus, upper respiratory tract infection, rash maculo-papular, localized edema, weight increased, 
abdominal pain, nasopharyngitis, thrombocytopenia, renal impairment, hypertriglyceridemia, 
hypertension, neutropenia, and anaphylactic reaction, have been identified as ADRs for siltuximab. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/258608/2014 
Page 86/92 
 
  
  
With regard to AEs grade 3 or higher into the study CNTO328MCD2001, twenty-five subjects (47%) 
in the siltuximab group and 14 subjects (54%) in the placebo group had Grade 3 or higher AEs. AEs 
classified in the following SOCs were the most frequently reported (≥ 10% of subjects) in the 
siltuximab group: Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders (9 subjects; 17%), General Disorders and 
Administration Site Conditions (8 subjects; 15%), and Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders (6 
subjects; 11%). Hyperkalaemia (3.8 % vs 0%) hyperuricaemia (3.8 % vs 0%) fatigue (9.4% vs 
3.8%) localised oedema (3.8% vs 0%) night sweats (7.5% vs 3.8%) hyperhidrosis (3.8% vs 0%) 
hypertension (3.8% vs 0%) and weight increased (3.8% vs 0%) are the most marked AEs 
associated to siltuximab in the pivotal trial. With regard to the MCD monotherapy studies, the 
pattern is quite similar with the exception of nervous system disorders (7.3% vs 3.8%) and 
respiratory disorders (6.1% vs 3.8%) 
SAEs were reported in 12 subjects (23%) in the siltuximab group and 5 subjects (19%) in the 
placebo group. 
The percentage of treatment interruptions due to AEs was higher for siltuximab group (28% vs 
19%) than placebo, with infections and infestations (7.5% vs 3.8%; siltuximab and placebo 
respectively) and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (7.5 % vs 0%) as main reasons for that. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The safety database is limited and consists of a number of small studies in various disease groups. 
Despite the fact that 650 patients have been exposed to siltuximab, there is a comparatively small 
number of patients who have been exposed in the target population (103 patients) and an even 
smaller number at the target dose (82 patients). Although the safety profile appears to be 
acceptable in the short term, there is a lack of data with respect to long term safety since only 19 
patients have been entered into the phase II extension study CNTO328MCD2002. A Registry will be 
conducted to address this issue and collect additional safety data.

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
There is no accepted standard of care for non-viral MCD and no treatment consistently results in a 
reduction in tumor burden in MCD patients; therefore prognosis remains poor with fatal outcomes 
reported. Therefore an unmet medical need for such population is readily acknowledged. 
In this context the results of the pivotal study are considered of clinical relevance. A statistically 
significant improvement in the durable and symptomatic response associated with treatment with 
siltuximab compared with placebo, and a statistically significant maintenance of the effect (longer 
duration of tumour and symptomatic response and time to treatment failure) was observed. 
Regarding the safety profile, even considering the limited sample of the safety database and the 
uncertainties related to the long-term safety and tolerability, overall, the safety profile is considered 
acceptable and generally manageable. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The efficacy of siltuximab in subjects with MCD has been demonstrated both in terms of tumour and 
symptoms burden as well as in maintenance of the effect. This, associated to the tolerable safety 
profile in this population, provides compelling evidence that the benefits of siltuximab are clinically 
meaningful and favourable relative to the safety profile for the treatment of subjects with MCD. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The benefit-risk balance of siltuximab for the treatment of non-HIV MCD patients is considered 
favourable in the claimed indication considering the beneficial clinical effect on tumour and 
symptom response that have been observed. This positive effect seems to be maintained over time.  
Finally, based on the convincing results obtained in the phase II trial, the clinical data can be 
considered to be comprehensive. However, a Registry will provide further efficacy and safety data 
with respect to optimal dose and pharmacogenomics data.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Siltuximab in the treatment of adult patients with multicentric 
Castleman’s disease (MCD) who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative and human 
herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) negative is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the 
marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

To submit an updated analysis of overall survival for study CNTO328MCD2002  31/08/2017 
A  Registry should be conducted to collect information on patients with 
Castleman’s disease, who are candidates to receive Sylvant or are currently 
receiving treatment with Sylvant. The registry should be continued for the 
either 100 patients, or 5 years, whichever is greater. The MAH should provide 
tabulated data to the CHMP every 6 months in line with the periodic safety 
update report (PSUR) cycle including data for only those patients who are 
candidates for treatment with siltuximab.

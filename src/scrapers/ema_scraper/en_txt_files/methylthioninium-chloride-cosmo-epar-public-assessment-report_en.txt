2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo is indicated as a diagnostic agent enhancing visualisation of 
colorectal lesions in adult patients undergoing screening or surveillance colonoscopy. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
CRC, or colorectal adenocarcinoma, represents the third most common cancer in men and the second 
most common cancer in women worldwide. In 2012, there were approximately 746,000 new cases of 
CRC in men and 614,000 in women, corresponding to 10.0% and 9.2% of all new cancer cases in men 
and women, respectively. Overall, 1.4 million cases and 693,900 deaths were estimated in 2012 (Torre 
CA Cancer J Clin 2015). Wide geographical variation is evident between countries in the incidence and 
mortality of CRC, with almost 55% occurring in developed countries (IARC Cancer Fact sheets). In 
Europe, CRC was the second most common cancer in 2012, with 447,000 cases, and the second most 
common cause of death from cancer, with 215,000 deaths (Ferlay Eur J Cancer 2013).  
Risk factors for CRC can be divided into lifestyle/behavioural factors and genetic factors, with the 
former including smoking, obesity and physical inactivity (Labianca Ann Oncol 2013). The major 
unchangeable risk factor for sporadic CRC is age, with nearly 70% of patients aged over 65 years. 
There are a number of inherited syndromes which are associated with a higher risk of CRC, including 
familial adenomatous polyposis; however, these high-risk subjects were excluded from enrolment into 
the pivotal study (Study CB-17-01/06).

2.1.3.  Biologic features, Aetiology and pathogenesis 
CRC usually develops over a period of several years, generally starting from pre-cancerous lesions: it 
has been estimated that at least 95% of CRC cases arise from pre-existing adenomas (Lin Agency for 
Healthcare Research and Quality 2016), even though the rate of progression of adenoma to cancer is 
variable. Polyps are lesions located in the mucosa of the large bowel and may be pre-cancerous 
(neoplastic adenoma) or non-pre-cancerous (non-neoplastic, including hyperplastic polyps) (Brown 
Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2016). Adenomas are epithelial tumours that can progress to 
adenocarcinomas and are therefore considered as precursors of CRC. Adenomas can vary greatly in 
their size and shape and have different degrees of dysplasia and different histologic characteristics. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
In the early stages of the disease, CRC is asymptomatic in most patients. As tumour grows in size and 
spreads, it may present as focal symptoms (changes in bowel habits, visible blood in stools, abdominal 
pain etc.) or general symptoms (fatigue, weight loss, jaundice etc.). Diagnosis is made by 
sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy (including biopsies). As for most solid tumours, staging is done according 
to the TNM staging system. Prognosis is heavily dependent on the stage, with close to 90% survival for 
early stages and less than 15% for advanced stages. 
2.1.5.  Management 
The detection and removal of lesions, and consequently, the removal of adenomas, is a crucial aspect 
of the prevention of CRC (Kaminski Gastroenterology 2017). It has been shown that for every 1% 
increase in ADR, there is an associated 3% reduction in the risk of interval CRC and a 5% decrease in 
risk of fatal interval cancer (Kaminski Gastroenterology 2017; Corley N Engl J Med 2014). 
A growing body of scientific evidence now proves that adenomas need to be categorised as either 
“conventional adenomas” or “serrated adenomas” (part of the serrated polyps group), and that both 
are recognised as precursors of CRC, so that they both need to be removed during colonoscopy, 
whereas the “Vienna Classification” classifies conventional adenomas only. Serrated polyps comprise a 
heterogeneous group of lesions with distinct features and are normally divided into 3 subgroups: 
traditional serrated adenomas (TSAs), sessile serrated adenomas (SSAs), and hyperplastic polyps. 
While the last subgroup, hyperplastic polyps, lacks malignant potential, there is now widespread 
consensus between endoscopists and histologists that TSAs and SSAs must be identified as potential 
cancer precursors. This is because there is unequivocal evidence that a significant proportion of TSAs 
and SSAs progress via the so-called “serrated neoplasia pathway” to colorectal adenocarcinoma and 
they likely account for 10% to 20% of all CRCs. There are also reasons to suspect that this “serrated 
pathway” may contribute disproportionately to interval or missed cancers. These TSAs and SSAs are 
usually flat or sessile, occasionally covered by a mucous cap, and consequently may be easily missed 
during colonoscopy screening. The prevalence and distribution of these lesions are however not well-
defined, partly because most of the large population-based screening studies were conducted before 
the full characterisation and classification of different subtypes of serrated polyps. 
If pre-cancerous lesions are detected and removed, CRC can be prevented, and if CRC is diagnosed 
early, it is a curable disease (CDC 2011). Therefore, in many Western countries, CRC mortality has 
declined progressively, due to the application of cancer screening programmes, with the removal of the 
detected mucosal lesions and adenomas, as well as the early detection of pre-cancerous and cancerous 
lesions, and the introduction of more effective treatments (Labianca Ann Oncol 2013). Prevention 
strategies have 2 arms; firstly, screening programmes for early detection and removal in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/424242/2020  
Page 10/119 
 
 
 
 
asymptomatic individuals (baseline colonoscopy), and secondly surveillance to follow-up those 
individuals at high-risk (surveillance colonoscopy) (Zavoral World J Gastroenterol 2014). 
There are a number of factors that make CRC an excellent candidate for population screening, 
including high incidence, long preclinical phase, recognisable and treatable precursor, and correlation 
of mortality with disease stage (Schreuders Gut 2015). Colorectal cancer screening programmes were 
introduced in Europe after publication of the EU Council recommendations on cancer screening in 2003. 
Different screening tests and test algorithms are used in CRC screening programmes across different 
EU Member States. As of 2015, a total of 23 EU Member States have implemented or have plans to 
introduce CRC screening programmes (20 population-based and 3 non-population-based) (Ponti 
European Commission Report 2017). Screening guidelines for CRC generally use endoscopy, either 
flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, as the primary screening tool, or combine them with a less 
invasive first-line test, such as a screening test for faecal occult blood in stool samples (Brenner BMJ 
2014). A positive faecal screening test is then followed up with a flexible sigmoidoscopy or full 
colonoscopy. In some EU countries, colonoscopy allows the complete and direct examination of the 
whole colon and combines diagnosis and therapy in a single session, compared with non-invasive 2-
stage screening strategies (Hewett Gastrointest Endosc Clin N Am 2015). The examination through the 
endoscopic probe requires the intestinal mucosa to be cleansed: for this purpose the European Society 
of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guidelines for bowel preparation for colonoscopy (Hassan 
Endoscopy 2013) recommend a day before or split regimen (day before and day of colonoscopy) of 4 
litres of polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution for routine bowel preparation, which may be reduced to 2 
litres in some situations such as outpatient elective colonoscopy or to same day regimen for afternoon 
colonoscopies. However, recent data demonstrate that in clinical practice in Europe, actual uptake of 
the split dose regimen is low, with only 33% of patients opting for this regimen for early morning (8.00 
am to 10:00 am) colonoscopies and nearly 40% of patients rejecting this option overall (Radaelli Gut 
2017). 
Due to the established progression of adenoma to CRC and the difficulty of determining the nature of 
lesions (e.g., benign lesions, pre-cancerous adenomas or cancerous adenomas) during the colonoscopy 
procedure, it is currently recommended by multiple international endoscopist societies that all lesions 
found during colonoscopy are removed (Winawer N Engl J Med 1993, Winawer Bull World Health Organ 
1995, Rex Am J Gastroenterol 2002, Ferlitsch Endoscopy 2017, von Renteln Clin Transl Gastroenterol 
2017). Subsequently, the nature of the lesion is assessed by histological analysis. Resect and discard’ 
or ‘diagnose and leave behind’ approaches are also proposed in guidelines (Ferlitsch Endoscopy 2017) 
where optical diagnosis of diminutive polyps may be made with a high degree of confidence or for 
diminutive multiple polyps in the rectum where a sampling approach is appropriate. The caveat for 
these approaches being with regard to the endoscopists expertise in optical biopsy and degree of 
confidence. 
There are several mechanisms by which colonoscopy is able to reduce the incidence and mortality of 
CRC. Firstly, removal of pre-cancerous lesions during colonoscopy prevents their progression to 
carcinoma; secondly, colonoscopy enables detection and histological diagnosis of CRC at an earlier, 
pre-symptomatic stage, which greatly increases survival rates (Lin JAMA 2016). In addition, the 
number and histological classification of adenomas detected at baseline colonoscopy are used to 
determine the frequency with which patients will undergo subsequent follow-up surveillance 
colonoscopy (Lieberman Gastroenterology 2012). According to guidelines, patients in whom no lesions 
are detected at baseline colonoscopy will not undergo a second colonoscopy for 10 years, while 
patients considered at higher risk for CRC based on their first colonoscopy will undergo surveillance 
colonoscopy within 3 to 5 years, depending on the number and nature of the removed lesions. This 
increased frequency of surveillance colonoscopies reduces the possibility of higher risk patients 
developing CRC in the interval between colonoscopic examinations (hereafter referred to as interval 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/424242/2020  
Page 11/119 
 
 
 
 
cancers) and also helps ensure that any interval cancer that has developed will be detected early 
(Lieberman Gastroenterology 2012). 
Since the early 1990s, several studies have shown the benefit of lower gastrointestinal endoscopy in 
reducing the risk of CRC, and this has been confirmed by more recent randomised controlled trials 
(Brenner BMJ 2014). A systematic review of randomised controlled studies demonstrated a 26% 
reduction in CRC mortality with flexible sigmoidoscopy screening compared to controls (Fitzpatrick-
Lewis Clin Colorectal Cancer 2016). Similarly, a recent meta-analysis showed colonoscopy and flexible 
sigmoidoscopy screening reduced CRC mortality by 61% and 33%, respectively (Zhang Clin Colorectal 
cancer 2017). In patients with known polyps, a 76% to 90% reduction in the incidence of CRC 
compared to 3 reference groups as part of the National Polyp Study was demonstrated (Winawer N 
Engl J Med 1993). More recently, a 53% reduction in mortality with colonoscopic polypectomy 
compared to the general population has been demonstrated. Mortality from CRC was similar among 
patients with adenomas and those with non-adenomatous polyps during the first 10 years after 
polypectomy (relative risk, 1.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.1 to 10.6) (Zauber N Engl J Med 
2012). In a study of a large group of endoscopists, it was observed that a 1% increase in the ADR was 
associated with a reduction in the risk of interval cancer of 3% and a decrease in mortality of 5% 
(Corley N Engl J Med 2014). 
Rationale for the Clinical Indication 
Colonoscopy is considered the gold standard for colorectal polyp detection and removal (Pohl Gut 
2009), but this procedure is not perfect. However, the effective level of protection offered by 
colonoscopy against CRC is significantly lower than originally estimated (Hewett J Natl Compr Canc 
Netw 2010). There is a concern about the sensitivity of colonoscopy, with studies suggesting that as 
many as a quarter of polyps may be missed (Heresbach Endoscopy 2008; Trivedi QJM 2013). Reasons 
for this can be technical, anatomical, or lesion-dependent (Matsuda Dig Endosc 2015). Many 
endoscopists have reported levels of lesion detection significantly lower than recommended targets 
(Hewett J Natl Compr Canc Netw 2010). There is also evidence that training and experience play a 
significant role in determining an individual endoscopist’s ADR (Peters Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol 
2010).  
Lesions that are missed, rather than being removed during colonoscopy, may progress to carcinoma. 
During the colonoscopy procedure, in fact, it is impossible to fully determine which lesions are benign, 
which are adenomas, and which adenomas are cancerous or pre-cancerous. Therefore, the standard of 
care in endoscopy is to remove (or sample) all lesions found during colonoscopy, a practice that is 
recommended by the United States (US) Multi-Society Task Force on CRC (Rex Gastrointest Endosc 
2017). The only definitive means of distinguishing the lesion type is through histopathological 
examination. Failing to detect (and consequently remove) colonic lesions expose patients to the risk of 
developing interval CRC. Low ADR is one of the primary reasons for post-colonoscopy CRC (Ngu Therap 
Ad Gastroenterol 2018). 
Between 70% and 91% of interval cancers have been suggested to result from missed lesions or 
incompletely or inappropriately resected lesions (Pohl Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol 2010, Robertson Gut 
2014, Benedict World J Gastroenterol 2015), and interval cancer represents a significant portion of 
CRC (Bressler Gastroenterology 2007). Because the number and nature of adenomas detected at 
baseline colonoscopy are used to determine the frequency of subsequent surveillance colonoscopies, 
patients for whom adenomas were completely missed at baseline will have longer surveillance periods, 
which pose a serious risk for development of interval cancer (Hewett J Natl Compr Canc Netw 2010). 
Failure to detect lesions therefore ultimately jeopardises the overall effectiveness of colonoscopy. Low 
ADR is implicated as one of the primary reasons for post-colonoscopy CRC. Acceptable levels of ADR

will depend upon the population receiving colonoscopy, but minimal standards should be defined (Ngu 
Therap Ad Gastroenterol 2018). 
Several factors limit the effectiveness of colonoscopy in detecting lesions: these are primarily related 
to the patient (i.e., quality of bowel preparation), the equipment (i.e., image resolution and quality) 
and the endoscopist (i.e., suboptimal procedural technique). In particular, the shape and dimensions of 
colorectal lesions have a dramatic impact on the rate at which they are missed (Matsuda Dig Endosc 
2015). Flat and depressed lesions (non-polypoid) and small lesions are the most challenging lesions to 
be detected during colonoscopy, due to a lack of contrast with respect to the surrounding tissues. It is 
estimated that 10% of the colonic surface is poorly surveyed using a standard forward-viewing 
colonoscope even with good bowel preparation; thus, optimising mucosal visualisation is fundamental 
to ensuring high-quality colonoscopy (Ngu Therap Ad Gastroenterol 2018). In a multicentre 
retrospective study, patients diagnosed with colorectal adenomas at a screening colonoscopy 
underwent a second colonoscopy 3 months later. Among the 2093 patients, 560 patients had 
adenomas that were missed in the first colonoscopy and were only detected in the second colonoscopy. 
Of a total of 4632 adenomas, 967 were missed at the first colonoscopy, with an overall ‘per-adenoma’ 
adenoma miss rate (AMR) of 20.9%. The ‘per-patient’ AMR was 43.3% in patients with flat adenomas, 
compared to 18.6% in patients with only protruding adenomas (odds ratio [OR]: 0.300, 95% CI 0.245 
to 0.367) (Xiang World J Gastroenterol 2014). In another retrospective study to investigate the miss 
rate of lesions in 463 patients, non-polypoid lesions were missed at a rate of 32.7%, compared to a 
miss rate of 7.5% for pedunculated or sub-pedunculated polyps (adjusted OR: 3.62, 95% CI 2.40 to 
5.46) (Kim Intest Res 2017). Non-polypoid lesions are relatively common worldwide, and failure to 
detect these lesions is a particular concern. In fact, patients with non-polypoid lesions have an 
increased risk of developing advanced neoplasia at surveillance colonoscopy compared to patients with 
polypoid lesions only, and patients with non-polypoid lesions are at high risk of developing CRC (McGill 
Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol 2017). Tandem colonoscopy has also shown smaller lesions are 
understandably more frequently missed by all endoscopists (Rex Gastroenterology 1997). The ADR, 
defined as the proportion of colonoscopies during which at least one adenoma is found, is used as an 
important marker of quality in colonoscopy by the most eminent and important endoscopy societies in 
the world, including the ESGE and the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) 
(Matsuda Digestive Endoscopy 2015; Kaminski Endoscopy 2017; Rex Gastrointest Endosc 2015). ADR 
represents the primary measure of the quality of mucosal inspection, and is the single most important 
quality measure in colonoscopy, recognised in the medical literature as the ‘gold standard’ in 
colonoscopy quality (Liem Transl Gastroenterol Hepatol 2018). Endoscopists with a low ADR might fail 
to identify patients with pre-cancerous lesions, putting patients at risk of cancer twice, once by failure 
to clear the colon and secondly by recommending inappropriately long intervals between examinations 
(Rex Gastrointest Endosc 2015). Furthermore, ADR is inversely correlated with the rate of interval 
cancers (Kaminski N Engl J Med 2010), and ADR has been validated as an independent predictor of the 
risk of interval cancer. An increase in ADR represents a clear and quantitative improvement in CRC 
prevention, through both a more complete clearance of adenomas at baseline colonoscopy and shorter 
surveillance intervals. Even incremental improvements in ADR are clinically significant: a 1% increase 
in ADR is associated with a 3% reduction in the risk of interval cancer, and a 5% decrease in CRC 
mortality (Kaminski Gastroenterology 2017, Corley N Engl J Med 2014). Assessing and improving ADR 
is therefore at the core of a successful CRC prevention programme (Fayad Gastroinest Endosc Clin N 
Am 2015). 
Considering the relevance of ADR as the most important quality indicator of colonoscopy for CRC 
screening or surveillance, and the growing evidence about its impact on the decrease of interval cancer 
risk and death, there has been much research and effort made in developing tools or techniques, such 
as chromoendoscopy or virtual (or electronic) chromoendoscopy, with the aim of increasing the ADR 
and decreasing the miss rate of pre-cancerous lesions.

Chromoendoscopy 
One technique that has been found to significantly improve ADR for both average- and high-risk CRC 
screening populations is chromoendoscopy (Pohl Gut 2011). Chromoendoscopy involves using a dye to 
highlight the mucosal architecture, and improve detection of mucosal irregularities and contours of 
lesions. These contrast dyes are either absorbed by the mucosa (in the case of vital dyes such as 
methylthioninium chloride) or remain on the mucosal surface (in the case of non-vital dyes such as 
indigo carmine) (Bartel Gastrointest Endoscopy Clin N Am 2015). Currently in chromoendoscopy, the 
dye is ‘sprayed’ onto the mucosal surface using a catheter via the biopsy channel during colonoscopy. 
The application of the dye can be ‘targeted’ to areas or lesions of interest, or ‘pan-colonic’ involving 
spraying the whole of the colonic mucosa (Brown Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2016). Contrast dyes 
are safe and cheap but their use requires time and is cumbersome, which has limited their general 
implementation. Spray chromoendoscopy, independently of the application modality (pan-colonic or 
targeted spraying), has been proven to be more effective than standard colonoscopy in the detection 
of non-polypoid lesions in published studies, both in subjects at average risk for CRC (Kahi Am J 
Gastroenterol 2010; Pohl Gut 2011) and in patients at high-risk for CRC (e.g., inflammatory bowel 
disease [IBD] patients) (Kiesslich Gastroenterology 2003; Kiesslich Gastroenterology 2007). 
In clinical studies, chromoendoscopy has shown a generally higher ADR than normal colonoscopy. For 
example, the ADR with standard colonoscopy ranged between 25% and 31%, whereas ADR with 
chromoendoscopy ranged between 33% and 39% (Brooker Gastrointest Endosc 2002, Le Rhun Clin 
Gastroenterol Hepatol 2006). A Cochrane review in 2016 looked at chromoendoscopy versus 
conventional endoscopy for the detection of polyps in the colon and rectum (Brown Cochrane Database 
Syst Rev 2016). Seven trials were included involving 2727 participants, with 5 of the trials being 
similar enough to allow pooled results, and the other 2 trials included in a subgroup analysis. Overall, 
chromoendoscopy was significantly more likely to detect people with at least one neoplastic lesion (OR 
1.53, 95% CI 1.31 to 1.79), and at least one diminutive neoplastic lesion (< 5 mm) (OR 1.51, 95% CI 
1.19 to 1.92). None of the studies reported adverse events related to the use of the contrast dye 
(usually indigo carmine). Analysis of the 7 studies also suggested that chromoendoscopy consistently 
enhances the detection of premalignant polyps in the colon and rectum (Figure 2). There was no 
apparent increase in the detection of larger lesions or advanced pathology, which is consistent with the 
expectation that chromoendoscopy should particularly enhance the detection of small and flat lesions, 
which otherwise may be hard to detect. 
Despite the fact that spray chromoendoscopy increases ADR and is endorsed by several guidelines for 
patients at high-risk of CRC, such as patients with IBD (Cairns Gut 2010; Cancer Council Australia 
Colonoscopy Surveillance Working Party 2011; Mowat Gut 2011; NICE 2011; Dignass J Crohns Colitis 
2012; Annese J Crohns Colitis 2013; Kaminski Endoscopy 2014), its use in routine clinical practice is 
limited. A particular disadvantage of chromoendoscopy is that it takes significantly longer than typical 
colonoscopy, with an average length of 36.9±14.5 minutes versus 27.3±6.2 minutes in a typical 
colonoscopy (Stoffel Cancer Prev Res (Phila) 2008). Chromoendoscopy is also more labour-intensive 
than conventional colonoscopy, and can be quite messy (Brown Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2016). 
Non-uniform staining of the colon and possibility of missing lesions is also an issue, as the technique is 
operator-dependent in terms of extent of area sprayed, and the washing of the excess dye within a few 
minutes after spraying prevents the vital dye from penetrating deeply into the mucosal cell 
architecture to maximise the contrast between the lesion and the surrounding tissue (Trivedi QJM 
2013).  
Several alternative tools have been developed with the aim of avoiding the drawbacks related to the 
practical application of chromoendoscopy, while retaining its benefits. These tools include the use of 
optical filters or software-based technologies to improve detection of lesions by virtual 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/424242/2020  
Page 14/119 
 
 
 
 
chromoendoscopy (Bartel Gastrointest Endosc Clin N Am 2015), such as Narrow-Band Imaging (NBI) 
(Emura World J Gastroenterol 2008), Flexible Spectral Imaging Colour Enhancement (Fujifilm, Japan), 
and iScan (Pentax, Japan). Virtual chromoendoscopy attempts to replicate the results of 
chromoendoscopy in terms of increased detection of lesions with digital techniques.  
However, notwithstanding the massive investments made by the equipment makers, no new tool has 
been able to generate an increase in ADR at least resembling that achievable with chromoendoscopy 
(Nagorni Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2012; Hong Gastrointest Endosc 2012). Furthermore, the use of 
such techniques has not unequivocally been demonstrated to improve the ADR with respect to 
conventional colonoscopy in randomised, controlled clinical trials. The most significant advancement in 
the equipment of colonoscopy in recent years has been the introduction of high-definition white light 
(HDWL) colonoscopy. Nonetheless, HDWL colonoscopies have generated, on average, an increase of 
ADR equal to 3.5% compared with standard definition colonoscopy (Subramanian Endoscopy 2011), 
incomparable with the reported ADR gain with chromoendoscopy versus standard colonoscopy. Given 
the significant improvement of HDWL colonoscopy over standard colonoscopy and the broad adoption 
of this technological advancement over and above others, as described above, it is pertinent to note 
that all the endoscopies conducted in the pivotal Phase 3 study with Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 
tablets (both the active and placebo groups) were conducted by experienced colonoscopists (> 500 
colonoscopies/year) using the most current standard HDWL equipment. 
2.2.  About the product 
The initially applied indication was “Methylthioninium chloride-MMX is indicated as an aid for the 
enhanced visualization and detection of colorectal lesions in adult patients undergoing screening / 
surveillance colonoscopy for colorectal cancer. An increased detection of colorectal lesions translates 
into an increase in the adenoma detection rate (ADR).”  
The final agreed indication following the CHMP review is: “Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo is indicated 
as a diagnostic agent enhancing visualisation of colorectal lesions in adult patients undergoing 
screening or surveillance colonoscopy.” 
Cosmo have developed Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo as a self-administered tablet formulation to 
be taken orally during or after the intake of the bowel cleansing preparation. Tablet administration 
should be completed in the evening prior to the colonoscopy to ensure there is enough time for the 
tablets to reach the colon and locally release the methylthioninium chloride prior to the colonoscopy. 
Each tablet contains methylthioninium chloride European Pharmacopoeia equivalent to 25 mg of 
anhydrous methylthioninium chloride. The recommended total dose is 200 mg (8 × 25 mg tablets), 
taken with the bowel cleansing regimen chosen by the healthcare professional (HCP) or with water.  
Methylthioninium chloride is widely used in humans for a variety of medical purposes, as both a 
medication and a dye, and is a registered drug in many countries for indications such as the treatment 
of acquired and hereditary methaemoglobinaemia (including drug-induced and idiopathic 
methaemoglobinaemia), the prevention of ifosfamide-induced encephalopathy in human cancer 
management, the prevention of urinary tract infections, the intraoperative visualisation of nerves and 
endocrine glands as well as of pathologic fistulae, and the sterilisation of transfusion plasma. 
It is currently approved centrally in Europe by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) as 
Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue® 5 mg/mL solution for injection for use in adults, children and 
adolescents for the acute symptomatic treatment of medicinal and chemical products-induced 
methaemoglobinaemia; as well as a Class IIa medical device ProveDye, indicated as a visualisation aid 
for surgical procedures such as the delineation of tissues and operative pieces, seal tests for sutures, 
detection of leaks, and fistula detection.

2.4.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of methylthioninium chloride is 3,7-bis(dimethylamino)phenothiazin-5-ylium 
chloride (methylene blue), corresponding to the molecular formula C16H18ClN3S, xH2O (the active 
substance is a mixture of mainly pentahydrate and other hydrates forms). It has a relative molecular 
mass of 319.9 + x*18 and the following structure: 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
The chemical structure of the active substance was elucidated by a combination of infrared (IR) 
absorption spectrophotometry, ultraviolet (UV) absorption spectrophotometry, nuclear magnetic 
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (1H, 13C) and mass spectrometry. 
The solid state properties of the active substance were measured by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) 
and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). 
The active substance is a dark blue or dark green crystalline hygroscopic powder with a metallic sheen. 
It is slightly soluble in water and ethanol (96%). 
Methylthioninium chloride has a non - chiral molecular structure.  
There is a monograph of methylthioninium chloride in the European Pharmacopoeia. The Active 
Substance Master File (ASMF) procedure is used within the current Marketing Authorisation Application 
(two ASMFs are submitted). 
Polymorphism has been observed for the active substance. Based on literature, methylthioninium 
chloride exists in different hydrate structures: Form A is a pentahydrate, Form B and C are dihydrates, 
Form D contains more than 2 equivalents of water and Form E is a monohydrate. Form A is considered 
to be the most stable thermodynamically at room temperature and up to 70% RH. Furthermore, as 
described in literature, crystallisation of methylthioninium chloride from water generally gives a 
mixture of mainly pentahydrate and additional dihydrated forms. It has been demonstrated that the 
active substance obtained from two sources is a mixture of mainly pentahydrate and other hydrates 
forms, which is also in line with the monograph of methylthioninium chloride in the Ph. Eur., which 
states that the active substance contains a variable quantity of water (with prescribed limits). No 
issues related to the solubility of the active substance are expected and its bioavailability is not linked 
to a specific crystalline status, since methylthioninium chloride can be defined as highly soluble at 
physiological pH. In line with ICH Q6A, no acceptance criteria are set for polymorphism in active

substances since there is no finished product safety, performance, or efficacy issue linked to a specific 
polymorph of the active substance. 
The active substance is manufactured according to two synthetic routes. It was demonstrated that the 
active substance manufacturing process of both suppliers consistently produces the active substance in 
which pentahydrate crystals (Form A) are mainly evident. It was further demonstrated that the 
polymorphic form does not change during storage. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the ASMF 
restricted parts of two ASMF holders and was considered satisfactory. 
During initial development, the active substance was sourced from the first manufacturer, 
Manufacturer B only. All clinical trial batches of the finished product used the active substance sourced 
from Manufacturer B in their manufacture. An additional active substance supplier, Manufacturer A was 
selected to support commercialisation. A comparability study was conducted for the active substance 
made by Manufacturer A and B, as well as a comparison of finished product batches made using active 
substance batches from both manufacturers. The study demonstrated that the active substance 
sourced from the two manufacturers is comparable. 
The active substance obtained from Manufacturer A is synthesised in three chemical reaction steps, 
purification and physical processing step using well-defined starting materials with acceptable 
specifications. Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and 
control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
The active substance obtained from Manufacturer B is synthesised in five chemical reaction steps, 
purification and physical processing step, using well-defined starting materials with acceptable 
specifications. Of note, the active substance manufacturing process was updated during the procedure 
at the request of CHMP, to include additional synthesis steps. Adequate in-process controls are applied 
during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting 
materials and reagents have been presented. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities, sourced from both manufacturers is in 
accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual 
impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. The risk of genotoxic 
impurity formation has been assessed in line with ICH M7 and relevant control strategies are in place. 
Several synthesis impurities have been identified as potentially genotoxic. Genotoxic impurities are 
further discussed under the active substance specification section. The potential risk of nitrosamine 
impurity formation and the presence of elemental impurities are discussed under the finished product. 
The active substance provided by the additional active substance manufacturer is packaged in packaging 
which complies with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
 The active substance provided by the initial supplier is packaged in packaging which complies with the 
EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance, identification (IR), identification of 
chlorides (Ph. Eur.), related substances (HPLC), metals (Ph. Eur.), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), sulfated 
ash (Ph. Eur.) and assay (HPLC), according to official European Pharmacopoeia monograph of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/424242/2020  
Page 18/119 
 
 
 
 
Methylthionium chloride and additional in house tests for residual solvents (GC) and synthesis 
impurities (HPLC). 
The proposed active substance specification complies with the Ph. Eur. monograph 1132 
Methylthioninium chloride, including supplements. Specifications of the active substance sourced by 
different manufacturers contains appropriate limits for process-related impurities. The limits for 
potentially genotoxic impurities are compliant with acceptable daily intake in line with the ICH M7 
guideline. 
Microbiological purity of the active substance is controlled by the active substance Manufacturer A and 
the finished product manufacturer routinely controls microbiological purity of prolonged-release tablets 
with appropriate limits according to Ph.Eur. The justification of non-control of microbiological purity of 
the active substance by finished product manufacturer is acceptable. 
All the analytical methods applied by the finished product manufacturer for active substance testing 
are Ph. Eur. methods except for specific tests for residual solvents and for synthesis impurities. The 
analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference 
standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data of three active substance batches from each manufacturer are provided. The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of active substance from Manufacturer A stored in 
the package representative of proposed commercial packaging for up to 36 months under long term 
conditions (5 ºC ± 3°C), for up to 36 months under accelerated conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH), for up to 
12 months at 30 ºC / 65% RH and for up to 6 months at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided. Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one 
batch. Results on stress conditions (acidity, alkalinity, oxidation, exposed to light, temperature 80 ºC) 
were also provide on one batch. 
The tested parameters were the same as those at active substance release. The analytical methods 
used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
Long term stability shows all results within specification. Photostability study showed that the active 
substance manufactured by Manufacturer A is photostable. 
Results of forced degradation test show that the active substance is sensitive to alkaline and acidic 
conditions and more stable under oxidation and high temperature conditions. 
Any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the 
Rapporteur and EMA. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by Manufacturer A is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period. 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of active substance from Manufacturer B, the initial 
active substance manufacturer, stored in the intended commercial package for up to 36 months under 
long term conditions (5 ºC ± 3°C) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (25 ºC / 60% 
RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Photostability testing following the ICH guideline 
Q1B was performed on one batch. Results on stress conditions (acidity, alkalinity, oxidation, exposed 
to light, temperature 80 ºC) were also provide on one batch.

2.4.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as prolonged-release tablets presented in one strength. Each tablet 
contains 25 mg of the active substance methylthioninium chloride. The tablets are off-white to light 
blue, round, biconvex with a diameter of 9.5 mm and a thickness of 5.3 mm. 
The aim of pharmaceutical development was to develop a locally released vital dye formulation 
indicated for enhanced visualisation and detection of colorectal lesions in patients undergoing 
screening or surveillance colonoscopy. The tablets are formulated using a patented Multi-Matrix (MMX) 
structure that allows the delivery of the active substance directly inside the colon. With this 
technology, the maximum local bioavailability of the active substance is achieved and, consequently, 
the contrast enhancing effect is optimised. The MMX technology allows the delivery of active 
pharmaceutical ingredients into the lumen of the colon through tablets in a delayed and controlled 
extent with the effect that the active pharmaceutical ingredients can be applied to the full length of the 
colon. The controlled release over the length of the colon simplifies the application for the patients and 
allows for the topical application of the active pharmaceutical ingredients to the bowel surface.  
The active substance methylthioninium chloride is described in a monograph in Ph. Eur. 
Methylthioninium chloride is highly bioavailable, with virtually 100% of the oral dose absorbed. A 
comparison of the active substance sourced from the proposed suppliers, Manufacturer A and 
Manufacturer B (used during clinical development work) was performed, considering the physical 
properties that could affect the performance of the finished product formulation. The characteristics 
was found similar for the two sources. 
The potential influence of active substance particle size on the manufacture, quality and stability of the 
finished product has been adequately discussed. At pH ranging from 2 to 7.2, covering the intestinal 
tract, the solubility of the active substance is ranging between approximately 10 to 40 g/l and 
therefore the active substance can be considered as “highly soluble” in physiological pH. The active 
substance is considered a highly soluble drug since it shows dose/solubility volume ≤ 250 mL 
throughout the physiological pH range. In addition, the finished product is formulated to deliver the 
active substance in a controlled release manner, therefore the active substance particle size is not 
considered a critical parameter. 
The two active substance manufacturers have characterised the physical state of the manufactured 
active substance. Both sources have demonstrated to consistently produce active substance containing 
mainly the pentahydrate form although no direct, formal quantification is provided. The performance of 
the active substance is mainly controlled by the formulation. No issues related to the solubility of the 
active substance are expected and its bioavailability is not linked to a specific crystalline status, since 
Assessment report

methylthioninium chloride can be defined as highly soluble at physiological pH. Methylthioninium 
chloride also does not have a narrow therapeutic index. Performance of the finished product, linked 
with solubility of the active substance, is sufficiently controlled at release with dissolution testing and 
appropriate acceptance criteria. In line with ICH Q6A, no acceptance criteria are set for polymorphism 
in active substances since there is no finished product safety, performance, or efficacy issue linked to a 
specific polymorph of the active substance.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards, except lecithin, which complies with a USP/NF monograph, since there is no Ph. Eur. 
Monograph for this substance. Reference to USP/NF for the excipient lecithin has been justified and a 
tabulated specification of excipient is included in the dossier. Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo contains 
3 mg soya lecithin per prolonged-release tablet, which is an excipient with a known effect. Appropriate 
warnings have been included in the product information. There are no novel excipients used in the 
finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in 
paragraph 2.1.1 of this report.  
No formal compatibility studies between the active substance and each of the excipients were 
performed during the finished product development. The excipients were chosen based on the 
manufacturers experience (prior knowledge) with other products using the MMX technology. The 
compatibility has been adequately confirmed by the stability studies of the finished product. 
The chosen formulation is considered adequate for the intended indication. The selection and 
concentration of excipients in the final formulation was based on the physicochemical characteristics of 
each excipient. The choice of excipients in order to manufacture the multi matrix structure has been 
explained and justified. The applicant has discussed the functionality-related characteristics of the 
excipients. The tests that are included in the excipient specifications are suitable for release controlling 
excipients and their functionality in the multi matrix system. 
The multi matrix structure uses a combination of different controlled release mechanisms, such as 
swelling and diffusion. The tablet core multi-matrix structure is composed primarily of hydrophilic and 
inert (amphiphilic/lipophilic) matrices. The methylthioninium chloride is partially embedded in the inert 
matrix (lecithin / stearic acid), which is dispersed in the hydrophilic matrix (hypromellose).  
After the pH dependent coating is dissolved, the tablet core is exposed to solvents in the local 
environment, which cause the hydrophilic matrix to swell. The solvent then penetrates the inert matrix, 
which is dispersed in the hydrophilic matrix and causes the release of the drug through diffusion from 
the matrix into the colon. 
Multiple administration of 8 tablets each containing 25 mg methylthioninium chloride, during the bowel 
preparation procedure was considered as optimal. 
The same formulation was used in the clinical trials as in the development studies. 
The manufacturing process, is a standard dry-granulation direct compression method, including the 
following stages: pre-mixing, final blending preparation, tableting and film-coating. The development 
of the formulation and manufacturing process is considered adequately described. 
The primary packaging is polyamide/aluminium/PVC foil blister with aluminium push-through foil. The 
material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has 
been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of four main steps: pre-mixing, final blending preparation, 
tableting and film-coating. The process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process 
(prolonged release dosage form) however, standard processing steps are used.  
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated on three consecutive commercial scale 
batches. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished 
product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this 
type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
appearance, size, methylthioninium chloride identification (HPLC, UV/VIS), uniformity of dosage units 
(Ph. Eur.), methylthioninium chloride assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), 
ethanol (GC), dye identification (colorimetric) and microbial analysis (Ph. Eur.).  
A risk assessment of the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the methylthioninium chloride 
tablets was provided at the request of CHMP. All potential sources for the formation of nitrosamines 
have been evaluated. These includes the active substance from Manufacurer A and Manufacturer B, 
excipients, manufacturing process conditions, manufacturing equipment, container closure system and 
storage conditions. No risk for the presence of any nitrosamine impurities in the methylthioninium 
tablets was identified. The nitrosamine risk evaluation was considered to be sufficient. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data on 3 
batches using a validated ICP-MS method was provided, demonstrating that each relevant elemental 
impurity was not detected above 30% of the respective PDE. The information on the control of 
elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 6 commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 6 commercial scale (3 manufactured using active substance manufactured by the 
initial active substance supplier, Manufacturer B and  3 manufactured using active substance 
manufactured by the additional supplier, Manufacturer A,) batches of finished product stored for up to 
36 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH), for up to 12 months under intermediate 
conditions (30 ºC / 65% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those 
proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. Additional 
supportive stability data was provided on 3 supportive batches for clinical use. The supportive batches 
were produced with the same drug product composition and container closure system as the 
registration batches. Furthermore, stability data at 25 °C / 60% RH and 5°C (18 months) on bulk 
product packaged in double LDPE bags placed in HDPE drums are available for two batches. 
Assessment report

A comparable stability profile between registration and the supportive development batches has been 
demonstrated, at both long term and accelerated conditions. No significant differences were observed 
between batches manufactured using active substance obtained from different manufacturers. No out 
of specification result was observed in all the tested conditions and no significant change was 
evidenced. All the batches met the proposed specifications for all storage conditions. Stress stability 
studies conducted demonstrated that the assay and related substances methods were stability 
indicating. 
Samples were tested (based on the timepoint) for appearance, identification by HPLC, uniformity of 
dosage unit, assay, related substances, dissolution test, dye identification, microbiological analysis. 
The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. Analytical methods have been optimized during 
the development, therefore the methods used for testing assay, related substances and dissolution for 
release and stability testing of the supportive stability batches are not fully identical. The details of the 
methods development were summarized by the applicant, a comparison between the methods used for 
release and stability of registration batches with the methods previously used on the supportive 
stability batches was provided and the study results show substantial equivalence of the methods. 
In accordance with EU GMP guidelines, any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative 
trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA. 
Photostability studies were conducted according to ICH Q1B and it was shown that the finished product 
is photo-stable and no special packaging protection from light is needed. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 3 years and no special storage conditions as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
 No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The synthetic route used by the two active substance manufacturers Manufacturer B and Manufacturer 
A are different, however the quality of the active substance obtained by both manufacturers is the 
same and complies with the monograph in Ph. Eur. for methylthioninium chloride. In addition, both 
have specification for residual solvents, which is specific to each manufacturer.  
Regarding the synthesis used by the initial active substance manufacturer Manufacturer B, the starting 
materials have been redefined to an earlier step in the synthesis and all relevant sections of the ASMF 
have been updated. Discussion on potentially genotoxic impurities has been amended.  
The finished product manufacturer controls the active substance in accordance with the monograph in 
Ph. Eur. and additional supplier specific tests for residual solvents. 
Sufficient information regarding the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities has been provided 
and no risk for the presence of any nitrosamine impurities in the methylthioninium tablets was 
identified.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

Not applicable. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects   
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The nonclinical package in support of this application is comprised of published studies on 
methylthioninium chloride in peer-reviewed literature complemented by studies conducted with 
methylthioninium chloride and Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo tablets. Methylthioninium chloride has 
been known and used for more than a century, therefore this application is based on comprehensive 
data related to different applications for human use, particularly, both systemic and local applications.  
The proprietary Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo prolonged release formulation significantly changes 
the systemic absorption of methylthioninium chloride compared to when it is administered “as is” as 
drug substance, therefore the assessment of the actual exposure, and its effects, in nonclinical studies 
with MMX gastro-resistant, prolonged release tablets have also been determined. The species selected 
for oral administration was the dog, as the administration of MMX tablets impeded treatment of smaller 
animals, e.g. rats and rabbits. GLP-compliant studies in the dog included a 28-day toxicology study 
(including toxicokinetic evaluation) and the assessment of safety pharmacology parameters (blood 
pressure, heart rate, ECG and body temperature).  In addition, in view of the complexity of the 
pharmacokinetics of methylthioninium chloride, which involves interconversion to leucomethylene blue, 
and a high volume of distribution, the assessment of plasma protein binding, transporter effects and 
inhibition/induction of hepatic enzymes of methylthioninium chloride, using drug substance, was also 
investigated.

2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
Specific studies on the primary pharmacology of methylthioninium chloride drug substance have not 
been conducted. Methylthioninium chloride has been used for many years and is currently used in the 
treatment of methemoglobinemia [Beutler 2005]. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Specific studies on the secondary pharmacology of methylthioninium chloride have not been 
conducted, as methylthioninium chloride has a well-established efficacy and safety profile and many 
years of medicinal use. 
Safety pharmacology programme  
A limited safety pharmacology programme was conducted with Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 
25 mg tablets, focusing on cardiovascular safely in a 28-day repeat oral toxicity study in beagle dogs 
(Study No. CERB 20160066TCPB). Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo at 200 mg, 400 mg and 600 mg 
did not induce any statistically significant changes in mean, systolic and diastolic arterial blood 
pressure, heart rate, body temperature, cardiac conduction times (i.e., PR, PQ intervals and QRS 
complex durations), ventricular repolarisation duration (QTc and QT shift), QT interval short term 
variability or ST segment when compared to the placebo control group. No test article-related changes 
in the sympatho-vagal balance were observed. No test article-related disturbances in the Lead II 
electrocardiogram were noted. All animals that received Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo tablets had 
blue/green faeces during the experiment. 
Respiratory System 
No respiratory studies have been conducted. In a published one-month oral gavage study in rats, 
doses of 1000 or 2000 mg/kg caused methemoglobinemia and respiratory changes [NTP 1990]; the 
respiratory changes were consistent with reduced levels of hemoglobin which would be expected to 
result in a compensatory increase in respiratory parameters such as rate and volume. No evidence of 
methemoglobinemia was noted in the 28-day repeat oral toxicity study in beagle dogs (Study No. 
CERB 20160066TCPB), indicating that respiratory changes are unlikely following oral dosing with 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo tablets. 
Central Nervous System (CNS)

No studies have been conducted. In a study reported in the literature, the incubation of slices of young 
rat cerebellum incubated for one hour with methylene blue (10 to 100 μM), caused a progressive 
destruction of the differentiating cells [Garthwaite 1988]. However, these effects were noted at free 
concentrations of methylene blue, orders of magnitude higher than observed in the clinic. In addition, 
a suppression of evoked excitatory field potentials in hippocampal slices at 1h following incubation with 
10 μM methylene blue has been reported; in dissociated neuronal cultures from the subventricular 
zone, this was associated with an increase in dying cells at doses of ≥10 μM methylene blue [Vutskits 
2008, Garthwaite 1988]. 
No specific studies to investigate central nervous system effects have been conducted by the Sponsor. 
In a one-month oral gavage toxicity study (125 to 2000 mg/kg/day) in rats, methylene blue induced 
no significant neurological deficits at 2 weeks or at study termination [NTP 1990]. No central nervous 
system effects were noted in the cardiovascular safety pharmacology study in dogs or in the 28-day 
oral repeat-dose toxicity study in Beagle dogs, administering Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 25 mg 
tablets (Study No. 20160066TCPB).  
Cardiovascular system  
A GLP study was conducted (Study no. 20160067PCCPB) to examine the effects of administration of 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 25 mg tablets on blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature and 
electrocardiograms in Beagle dogs. Four male Beagle dogs (21-39 months of age, 12.3-15.0 kg body 
weight) equipped with implanted telemeters received placebo or 200, 400 or 600 mg Methylthioninium 
chloride Cosmo 25 mg tablets via oral gavage in a cross-over design with 72 hours of washout 
between doses. There were two phases in the study: the first involved dosing with telemetry 
measurements, with the second part involving additional dosing for blood collection and observations. 
In phase I, the animals received 3 capsules at 1 hour intervals containing 9, 9 and 6 placebo tablets 
for the placebo group, 3, 3 and 2 tablets for the 200 mg group, 6, 6 and 4 tablets for the 400 mg dose 
group, and 9, 9 and 6 tablets for the 600 mg dose group.  
Measurements included arterial blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and epicardial Lead II 
electrocardiograms started at least 2 hours prior to dosing and continued for at least 24 hours after 
dosing with the third capsule.  
In phase II, the animals were dosed again with Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 25 mg tablets at 600 
mg for complementary investigations such as blood sampling and observation of animals.  
Whole blood concentration results confirmed that all treated animals (males and females) were 
exposed to Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 25 mg tablets throughout the study on D1 and D25. 72 
hours after the last dosing, methylene blue was not quantifiable whatever the dose. Variability in whole 
blood concentration between animals was high, one or two blood exposure peaks were seen depending 
on animals and independently from dose levels, gender and dosing days.  
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 25 mg tablets at 200 mg, 400 mg and 600 mg did not induce any 
statistically significant changes in mean, systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure, heart rate, body 
temperature, cardiac conduction times (i.e., PR, PQ intervals and QRS complex durations), ventricular 
repolarisation duration (QTc and QTshift), QT interval short term variability or ST segment when 
compared to the placebo control group. 
No test article-related changes in the sympatho-vagal balance were observed. No test article-related 
disturbances in the Lead II electrocardiogram were noted. All animals that received Methylthioninium 
chloride Cosmo 25 mg tablets had blue/green faeces during the experiment.

Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Studies on pharmacodynamic drug interactions have not been conducted. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The nonclinical pharmacokinetics (PK) of methylthioninium chloride MMX is presented as a compilation 
of the information available in the public domain on methylthioninium chloride complemented by 
studies conducted on methylthioninium chloride by the applicant. No dedicated PK studies were 
conducted for Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo. 
Methods of analysis 
For the support of non-clinical studies, a Liquid Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-
MS/MS) bioanalytical method for the quantification of methylene blue in dog K2EDTA whole blood by 
LC-MS/MS was validated according to generally recommended acceptance criteria for samples stored 
at ≤ -18⁰C. Method validation parameters including response function, selectivity, carryover, precision, 
accuracy, recovery, matrix effect, bench-top stability at processing temperature, re-injection stability 
at 10°C, F/T stability, stock solution stability, spike solution stability, long-term stability at ≤ -18⁰C and 
at ≤ -70⁰C, dilution integrity and the determination of the maximum batch size were evaluated.  
Absorption 
No dedicated absorption studies were performed with Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo. A summary of 
published studies was included in support of the absorption of methylene blue. Methylene blue was 
absorbed from the small intestinal tract in rats, guinea pigs and rabbits to a similar extent [Watanabe 
and Fujita 1977, Watanabe and Mori 1977]. Following IV and oral administration to the dog, it was 
determined that approximately 60 to 70% of the oral dose was absorbed [Disanto 1972, Disanto 1972, 
Watanabe and Fujita 1977].  
Pharmacokinetic profiles are relatively complex due to the binding of methylthioninium chloride and 
leuko-methylene blue with tissues and the difficulty of analysis [Disanto 1972, Disanto 1972, 
Watanabe and Fujita 1977, Watanabe and Mori 1977, Yang 2011]. In animals, such as the sheep, half-
life is relatively short but the apparent volume of distribution is very high, likely due to the extensive 
tissue distribution and binding [Burrows 1984]. 
Sponsor-led studies were performed to assess the involvement of P-glycoprotein in absorption. 
Toxicokinetic evaluation was also performed in a 28-day repeat-dose study with Methylthioninium 
chloride Cosmo 25 mg tablets in beagle dogs (Study No. 20160066TCPB). In brief, male and female 
beagle dogs were administered a total daily dose of placebo, 200 mg, 400 mg and 600 mg 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo orally every 4 days over a 28-day period. Whole blood was collected 
from the cephalic vein pre-dose and 2, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48 and 72 hours post-dosing on Days 1 and 
25. A pre-dose blood sample was also collected on Day 13 of dosing. Whole blood concentration results 
confirmed that all treated animals (males and females) were exposed to methylthioninium chloride 
throughout the study on D1 and D25. 72 hours after the last dosing, methylthioninium chloride was 
not quantifiable at all dose levels. Variability in whole blood concentration between animals was high, 
and one or two blood exposure peaks were seen depending on animals independently from dose levels, 
gender and dosing days. Because of delayed blood exposure peaks, half-life (t1/2) could not be 
calculated in most animals independently from dose levels and dosing days. Despite heterogeneity of 
blood exposure peaks, Cmax and AUClast were dose dependent. Due to heterogeneity of blood

exposure, linearity of Cmax and AUClast values according to dose levels was not assessed.

Distribution 
No dedicated distribution studies were performed with Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo. A summary of 
published studies was included in support of the absorption of methylthioninium chloride. In animals, 
such as the sheep, the half-life of methylthioninium chloride is relatively short but the apparent volume 
of distribution is very high, likely due to the extensive tissue distribution and binding [Burrows 1984].  
There have been high concentrations of methylthioninium chloride measured in liver, kidney, lung, and 
heart after IV administration in rats but the full distribution of methylthioninium chloride and the rate 
of elimination from all tissues are not known [Disanto 1972]. A GLP-compliant plasma protein binding 
study with methylthioninium chloride was conducted in rats, dogs and humans (Study No. CPS/04). 
The test article was soluble in the buffer used at nominal concentrations of up to 12 μg/mL. Preliminary 
system suitability tests were performed with human plasma and protein-free plasma spiked with 
methylthioninium chloride at a nominal concentration of ca. 12 μg/mL. The techniques of equilibrium 
dialysis, ultrafiltration and ultracentrifugation were evaluated for their suitability to determine the 
plasma protein binding of methylthioninium chloride. The stability and non-specific binding of 
methylthioninium chloride during these experiments were determined. Following review of the 
suitability experiments and in conjunction with the Sponsor the selected technique for the 
determination of the plasma protein binding of methylthioninium chloride was ultrafiltration.  
The plasma protein binding of methylthioninium chloride  in rat, dog and human plasma was then 
determined through ultrafiltration, at the following nominal concentrations: 12, 2.4, 1.2, 0.24, 0.12 
μg/mL. Spiked plasma was allowed to equilibrate for approximately 10 minutes in a heated incubator 
at 37°C, then was loaded into duplicate ultrafiltration devices and centrifuged at 1,525 x g for 20 
minutes at 37°C. The concentration of test compound in the spiked plasma and ultrafiltrate was then 
determined by LC-MS/MS analysis. All residual samples were stored at ca. -20°C.  
Following ultrafiltration, the plasma protein binding of methylthioninium chloride in rat plasma ranged 
from 79.8% - 88.5%, in dog plasma it ranged from 77.3% - 88.1%, and in human plasma it ranged 
from 62.9% - 86.3% over the concentration range studied. In each species, the plasma protein binding 
was approximately concentration-dependent. 
In a more recent study (Pohler 2004), the adsorption, distribution and excretion of 14C-labeled 
methylthioninium chloride following oral and 24h infusion, respectively, were investigated in rats. A 
nominal dose level of 20 mg/kg body weight of methylthioninium chloride was administered by gavage 
or by 24h infusion. In addition, the profile of the metabolite Azure B was also investigated after IV 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/424242/2020  
Page 28/119 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
infusion in blood and tissues. The observation time was 96 hours. The study demonstrated that the 
radioactivity is completed excreted within 96 hours from dosing, less than 1% is remaining after 96 
hours, bioavailability was approximately 50% and no accumulation of methylthioninium chloride was 
seen. Although during the study the radioactivity content in the intestinal mucosa was not assessed, it 
is assumed that the concentrations in the intestinal mucosa would have been larger after oral than 
after iv administrations. As the tissue content after 96 hours from dosing is very limited, it is 
reasonable to assume that no accumulation of methylthioninium chloride and its metabolites occurred 
after 96 hours from administration of methylthioninium chloride at 20 mg/kg in the rat. 14C- 
methylthioninium chloride has a very short initial half-life of few minutes, but a longer terminal half-life 
of approximately from 13 to 18 hours. The PK profile was comparable after os and IV administrations. 
Similar PK profiles of Azure B and methylthioninium chloride were observed. Slightly longer terminal 
phase was estimated for Azure B. Kidney and liver are the organs with the major concentration of 
radioactivity. 
Metabolism 
Once absorbed there is conversion of methylthioninium chloride to leucomethylene blue (LMB) such 
that the majority of material available systemically is LMB: a NADPH-dependent enzyme reaction is 
involved in this biotransformation [Beutler 2005]. The interconversion of methylthioninium chloride to 
leuko-methylene blue occurs consistently in a range of species studied, including rat, rabbit, guinea 
pig, dog and man [Disanto 1972, Disanto 1972, Watanabe and Fujita 1977, Watanabe and Mori 1977, 
Yang 2011]. In rats and mice, there is also an indication that other metabolites are formed by N-
demethylation of methylthioninium chloride (Azure A and B) [Yang 2011]. These metabolites are also 
seen in urine of humans treated with methylthioninium chloride. The information available therefore 
indicates that metabolism in the typical pre-clinical species employed, including the dog, are reflective 
of metabolism in man.  
The applicant has conducted studies to examine the ability of methylthioninium chloride to inhibit and 
induce human cytochromes P450.  No interspecies comparison studies were conducted. 
Enzyme inhibition 
CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4/5 Inhibition Experiments 
A GLP-compliant study (Study No. CPS/06) was conducted in human liver microsomes to determine 
the inhibition profile of methylthioninium chloride towards human cytochrome P450 isozymes 1A2, 
2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4/5. Methylene blue (at nominal concentrations of 0, 0.05, 0.5, 5, 50 
and 500 μM) was incubated with pooled human liver microsomes, β-NADPH, phosphate buffer and 
CYP-selective chemical substrates for 10 minutes. The experiments were conducted with and without 
30 minutes pre-incubation (with and without cofactor) prior to the addition of selective substrate, to 
assess potential time-dependent inhibition and potential contribution of mechanism-based inhibition. 
Methylthioninium chloride was found to inhibit all the CYP enzymes investigated (CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 
2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4/5) at the concentrations investigated in this study (nominal concentrations of 
0.05 – 500 μM). CYP3A4/5 with midazolam as substrate was affected to the greatest degree, with 
>99.0% inhibition. CYP1A2 was inhibited the least (73.1% to >92.6% inhibition). TDI potential is 
indicated if there is a >2-fold shift in IC50 following a 30-minute pre-incubation period. Therefore, with 
an IC50 shift of 2.63-fold and 2.18-fold for CYP2B6 and CYP2C9, respectively, it is likely that the 
inhibition by methylthioninium chloride of these enzymes was time-dependent.  
The IC50 shifts of 1.16-fold (CYP2C8), 1.38-fold (CYP2D6), 1.35-fold (CYP3A4/5 with testosterone as 
substrate) and 1.18-fold (CYP3A4/5 with midazolam as substrate) indicate that it is possible that the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/424242/2020  
Page 29/119 
 
 
 
 
inhibition by methylthioninium chloride of these enzymes was time-dependent, in part at least. Due to 
the shift of <2-fold in the IC50 following a 30-minute pre-incubation period, it cannot be concluded if 
time-dependent inhibition occurred in these assays, due to the potent reversible inhibition being 
observed.  Time-dependent inhibition was unlikely to have contributed to the inhibition of CYP1A2 and 
CYP2C19, with IC50 shifts of 0.700-fold and 0.349-fold respectively. 
CYP1A2, 2B6 and 3A4 Induction Experiment 
A GLP-compliant study (Study No. CPS-07) was conducted in cultured human hepatocytes to assess 
the potential of methylthioninium chloride to induce CYP1A2, 2B6 and 3A4, the major inducible CYP450 
enzymes in drug metabolism. Prior to conducting the induction experiments, the cytotoxic 
(hepatotoxic) effect of methylthioninium chloride on cultured cryopreserved human hepatocytes from 
one donor was assessed by visual microscopic inspection and a cell proliferation assay to define the 
maximum concentration of methylthioninium chloride that could be evaluated for CYP induction in this 
study. No cytotoxic effects on the human hepatocytes were observed with up to nominal 
concentrations of 40 μM methylthioninium chloride compared to the relevant solvent control after 72 
hours incubation. At a nominal concentration of 80 μM cell viability was reduced to 72.5%, indicating 
possible cytotoxicity at this concentration. Based upon these data it was decided to perform the 
assessment of methylthioninium chloride -mediated CYP induction with nominal concentrations of 
methylthioninium chloride 
Following this, cryopreserved human hepatocytes from three individual donors were cultured and 
exposed to multiple doses of methylthioninium chloride for 72 hours at nominal concentrations to 
assess the effects on CYP1A2, 2B6 and 3A4 mRNA expression. Following exposure, RNA was extracted 
from the cells and analyzed for levels of mRNA of the target genes using validated RT-qPCR methods. 
In addition to methylthioninium chloride, cultured hepatocytes from the same three donors were 
exposed to the prototypical inducing compounds omeprazole (CYP1A2), phenobarbital (CYP2B6) and 
rifampicin (CYP3A4), as well as to the non-inducing agent flumazenil.  
The maximum methylene blue-mediated inductive responses (fold change in mRNA) for CYP1A2, 2B6 
and 3A4, compared to solvent only control values, are summarized below:

26.9 (24 µM) 
5.27 (0.4 µM) 
2.31 (0.4 µM) 
3.17 (24 µM) 
For donors 1, 2 and 3, the values for omeprazole (AhR)-mediated CYP1A2 induction, phenobarbital 
(CAR)-mediated CYP2B6 induction and rifampicin (PXR)-mediated CYP3A4 induction were above the 
minimum values accepted by current industry best practice, at the concentrations dosed. The expected 
induction results were obtained with these compounds and therefore the data obtained in this study 
(and conclusions drawn from it) are considered valid.  
The results from this study demonstrate that the test material methylthioninium chloride at nominal 
concentrations of 0.8 μM and above is a potential inducer of CYP1A2 and CYP2B6 in human 
hepatocytes following 3 days (72 hours) exposure. Methylthioninium chloride is not an inducer of 
CYP3A4 at nominal concentrations up to 40 μM.

Excretion 
Excretion is via urine and faeces; the rates and routes appear to vary between species [Disanto 1972, 
Watanabe and Fujita 1977, Watanabe and Mori 1977].  
No specific studies on excretion of methylthioninium chloride following oral administration of 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 25 mg tablets have been performed. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
P-glycoprotein (P-gp), OAT1 and OAT3 Interaction experiments  
A GLP-compliant study (Study No. CPS-05) was conducted in Caco-2 cells and MDCKII cells to 
investigate the interactions of methylthioninium chloride with the ABC transporter P-glycoprotein (P-
gp; MDR1) and the renal SLC transporters OAT1 and OAT3. 
The methylene blue concentrations for the interactions experiment were selected on the basis of the 
solubility of the compound in the buffer used and was determined before initiation of the experiments. 
Following the solubility assessment, the following methylene blue concentrations were chosen for P-gp 
and OAT1 and OAT3 interaction assessments: 0, 0.565, 5.65, 16.8 and 56.5 μM.  Methylene blue was 
permeable across the Caco-2 cell monolayer in both the A – B and B – A, directions. However, Papp 
values were higher in the B – A direction, suggesting an efflux transporter-mediated movement of 
methylene blue. Methylene blue may be a low absorption compound in humans via P-gp transport, as 
the Papp values in the A – B direction (simulating movement from the lumen of the GI tract to the 
systemic circulation) after 120 minutes were generally less than 2 x 10-6cm.sec-1. 
P-gp inhibition 
Following P-gp inhibition experiment, a reduction in the efflux ratios for digoxin was seen throughout 
the incubation period, when compared to wells incubated with digoxin alone. This trend indicated that 
methylthioninium chloride  has the potential to be a weak inhibitor of P-gp, with an estimated IC50 of 
49.7 μM.  
The efflux ratio of methylthioninium chloride when incubated alone with MDCKII cells was ≥2 at 
concentrations of 16.8 μM and 56.5 μM at each timepoint, indicating methylthioninium chloride was a 
substrate of P-gp. Based on the A – B permeability parameter (Papp), and the involvement of P-gp, 
absorption of methylthioninium chloride via P-gp may be limited in humans.  
OAT1 inhibition and substrate experiments 
Methylthioninium chloride was found to unlikely be either an inhibitor or a substrate of OAT1; there 
was a <5% inhibition of the uptake of the OAT1 substrate p-aminohippuric acid, and a <20% inhibition 
of methylthioninium chloride uptake into transfected cells by the OAT1 inhibitor probenecid. 
OAT3 inhibition and substrate experiments 
Methylthioninium chloride was found to unlikely be an inhibitor of OAT3, since there was approximately 
30% inhibition of the uptake of the OAT3 substrate estrone-3-sulphate (IC50 was >56.5 μM). 
Methylthioninium chloride was found to be a possible substrate of the OAT3, since the uptake into 
transfected cells was inhibited 30-40% by the OAT3 inhibitor probenecid.

2.5.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity  
Single-dose studies were not conducted in any nonclinical species. The LD50 and acute toxicity for 
various routes of administration in various nonclinical species has been provided based on the 
literature. The LD50 for oral administration was 3500 mg/kg (mice) 1180 mg/kg (rat), 1000 mg/kg 
(rabbit) and 500 mg/kg (dog). These doses are considerably higher than the maximum clinical dose 
(200 mg per patient or 3.3 mg/kg based on a 60kg human). Acute toxicity findings included 
hemoconcentration, hypothermia, acidosis, hypercapnia, hypoxia, increases in blood pressure, changes 
in respiratory frequency and amplitude, corneal injury, conjunctival damage, and Heinz body 
formation. These effects are unlikely to be observed at the anticipated clinical exposure with 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo.   
Repeat dose toxicity  
The National Toxicology Program in the U.S.A has conducted six in vivo studies on methylene blue. 
Three (3) studies were conducted in F344/N rats and the other 3 in B6C3F1 mice. In each species, a 
one-month toxicity, a three-month toxicity [NTP 1990, National Toxicology Program 2008, Auerbach 
2010] and a two-year carcinogenicity study [National Toxicology Program 2008] were performed 
subsequently. In the NTP, doses ≥ 500 mg/kg/day were associated with lethality in both species over 1 
month of dosing. Methemoglobinemia, regenerative Heinz body anaemia, reduced body weight and 
organ weight, bone marrow hyperplasia and liver lesions were some of the effects noted in methylene 
blue-treated animals. In a 3-month study at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day were administered to both 
mice and rats. Similar effects were observed including methemoglobinemia, regenerative Heinz body 
anaemia, reduced body weight and organ weight at all dose levels. NOAELs were not identified in 
either study. 
The applicant also conducted a GLP-compliant 28-day repeat dose oral dose toxicity study on with 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo tablets in Beagle dogs, the findings of which are detailed in the 
following table.

 NOAEL: 600 mg  
Toxicokinetics 
Toxicokinetic evaluation was performed at D1 and D25. Whole blood concentration results confirmed 
that all treated animals (males and females) were exposed to methylthioninium chloride throughout 
the study on D1 and D25. 72 hours after the last dosing, methylthioninium chloride was not 
quantifiable whatever the dose. Variability in whole blood concentration between animals was high, 
one or two blood exposure peaks were seen depending on animals independently from dose levels, 
gender and dosing days. Because of delayed blood exposure peaks, half-life (t1/2) could not be 
calculated in most animals independently from dose levels and dosing days. Despite heterogeneity of 
blood exposure peaks, Cmax and AUClast appeared dose dependent. Due to heterogeneity of blood 
exposure, linearity of Cmax and AUClast values according to dose levels was not assessed. At the 
NOAEL of 600 mg (every 4 days), AUClast ranged between 364-8668 ng/ml.hr in males, and 1977- 
3910 ng/ml.hr in females at D25. Exposure margins at the NOAEL were calculated based on clinical 
exposure in PK study CB-17-01/02 (AUC0-t  25.16 ± 7.42 µg/ml.hr) in the below table.

In the 28-day toxicity study in dogs (20160066TCPB), as part of the examinations at necropsy, the 
whole gastrointestinal (GI) tract of treated dogs was examined. As Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 
25mg tablets are specifically designed to release the active substance throughout the whole length of 
the colon, where the highest local concentration is achieved in vivo, the macroscopic and microscopic 
findings in the GI tract, and particularly of the colon, might be deemed as indicative of any possible 
local effects due to the product. On Day 29, there were macroscopic points in colon of animals treated 
with Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo tablets across all the dose levels. On Day 43, these changes

were no longer present. There were other macroscopic changes, mainly in the gastrointestinal tract, 
such as points in cecum or rectum, foam in the stomach or red duodenum on Days 29 and 43. The 
incidence was similar in animals treated with Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo tablets or placebo. No 
significant histologic changes were noted. These results indicated a good local tolerability of the 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo tablets in the GI tract, since no significant signs of toxicity were 
found after administration of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo tablets at multiples of the human dose. 
Genotoxicity 
Genotoxicity studies were not conducted by the applicant. The applicant has included results from a

females, mean body weights were less after weeks 73 
and 53, respectively. Dosed male and female rats 
developed methemoglobinemia, and females developed 
a regenerative Heinz body anemia. The incidences of 
pancreatic islet cell adenoma and adenoma or 
carcinoma (combined) were increased in all dosed 
groups of males, were significantly increased in 25

or carcinoma (combined) of the small intestine 
occurred with a positive trend in males. The incidences 
of malignant lymphoma occurred with a positive trend 
in females, and the incidence in 25 mg/kg males 
exceeded the historical control range. The incidences of 
hematopoietic cell proliferation of the spleen were 
significantly increased in 12.5 and 25 mg/kg males and 
in 25 mg/kg females. The incidences of inflammation of 
the nose were significantly increased in 12.5 and 25 
mg/kg females. 
Reproduction toxicity 
No dedicated reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have been conducted by the applicant. 
The findings from published studies were included in support of this application. 
In vitro, methylthioninium chloride has been shown to reduce motility of human sperm in a dose 
dependent manner [Coddington 1989]. It has also been shown to inhibit the growth of cultured two-
cell mouse embryos [Coddington 1989]. In vivo, there were no consistent effects of methylthioninium 
chloride trihydrate administration on reproductive system measures in male or female rats after 3 
months of oral administration of methylthioninium chloride up to 200 mg/kg, however, male mice had 
decreased sperm motility and increased epididymal sperm counts at 200 mg/ kg. No significant 
difference in oestrus cycle in rats or mice was identified in any group [National Toxicology Program 
2008]. 
In rats and rabbits, teratogenic effects have been reported, with fetal and maternal toxicity [National 
Toxicology Program 1993, National Toxicology Program 1994]. In rats, methylthioninium chloride has 
been shown to increase resorption rates [Telford 1962]. Methylthioninium chloride  also causes 
preterm delivery and fetal growth restriction in 45%, 50% and 83% of animals after subcutaneous 
injection at doses of 50, 60 or 85 mg/kg [Tiboni, Giampietro, 2001]. Transplacental exposure of mice 
to up to 70 mg/kg of methylthioninium chloride also caused a dose-dependent increase in 
embryolethality and in axial skeleton and neural tube defects [Tiboni and Lamonaca 2001]. In studies 
conducted by the National Toxicology Program, in rats the NOAEL for developmental toxicity was 125 
mg/kg/d; in rabbits, the maternal NOAEL was 50 mg/kg/d [National Toxicology Program 1993, 
National Toxicology Program 1994]. Based upon these data, Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo tablets 
should not be used during pregnancy. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Screening for Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity  
A review of available information has revealed that logPow (log partition coefficient (water and 1-
octanol)) for methylthioninium chloride has been reported as -0.9 [Proveblue EPAR] and -0.1 
[Wainwright 1997]. These values are well below the action limit of 4.5, and therefore no Persistence, 
Bioaccumulation and Toxicity screening is necessary. 
Concentration in surface water 
The following assumptions were made in the calculation of PECsurface water: 
•  DOSEai 
Assessment report

o  The maximum daily dose consumed per inhabitant was 200 mg, in line with the MRHD 
in the proposed SmPC. 
•

o 
In the case of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo, the expected population is the number 
of patients who undergo colorectal screening in the EU. Data published by Eurostat 
estimates that there are over 4.8 million colonoscopies conducted in the EU annually 
[Eurostat 2014]. This revised estimate of the number of colorectal endoscopy 
procedures conducted annually in Europe is a more accurate estimate of market 
penetration for Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo and has been utilised for the 
calculations in this ERA. It is assumed that every patient is subjected to only one 
colonoscopy, so that the total number of colonoscopies is the total number of patients 
exposed in a given year. In line with the EMA guidance, Q&A, a market share of 100% 
(i.e. every patient undergoing colonoscopy receives Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo) 
has also been assumed. 
•  WasteWinhab 
o  CHMP default value of 200 litres/day (0.2m3) 
•  Dilution

The total dose per inhabitant per day [DOSEai x Fpen] can therefore be calculated based on the 
number of colorectal endoscopy procedures conducted annually in Europe and the total EU 
population, also published in the 2014 EuroStat report.

2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The data presented in the nonclinical pharmacology section is largely in line with relevant guidelines 
including ICH M3 R2, ICH S7A and “Guideline on the non-clinical documentation for mixed marketing 
authorisation applications”, (CPMP/SWP/799/95). The pharmacology package consists of bibliographic 
reference to the primary pharmacodynamic properties of the active substance methylthioninium 
chloride and a mixed safety pharmacology package of reference to published studies and sponsored 
studies. The primary and secondary pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of methylthioninium chloride 
are well-characterised clinically and it is agreed that nonclinical studies would not be of added value 
given that the specificity of staining of specialised columnar epithelium in the colon has also been 
established clinically. The multi-matrix (MMX) formulation of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo acts as 
a passive carrier of methylthioninium chloride to the colon lumen and mucosa and does not alter the 
known pharmacodynamics of methylthioninium chloride. 
Respiratory changes due to reduced haemoglobin (a known effect of methylthioninium chloride) has 
been identified at high doses (≥ 1000 mg/kg) in a National Toxicology Program (NTP) study, however 
respiratory changes or methemoglobinemia was not observed in a 28-day oral toxicity study in dogs 
and are unlikely to be observed at the anticipated clinical dose of 200 mg with Methylthioninium 
chloride Cosmo. Published studies identified neuronal death in cerebellar slices and neuronal cultures 
from the subventricular zone. In vivo, no neurological deficits were observed at doses ranging 125-
2000 mg/kg/day in rats (NTP study) or in the sponsored 28-day repeat dose toxicity study in dogs. 
Cardiovascular safety was investigated in a GLP-compliant study with Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 
in dogs. There were no test article-related changes in cardiovascular parameters including blood 
pressure, heart rate, cardiac conduction and ventricular repolarisation duration. No additional safety

pharmacology studies were performed. Given the exposures expected at the clinical dose, the 
observations from the aforementioned studies are unlikely to be observed in humans and clinical 
experience supersedes nonclinical data in this regard. 
The pharmacokinetic (PK) package presented in support of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo is largely 
based on bibliographical data, and supplemented with observational toxicokinetic (TK) data from a 28-
day repeat dose study in beagle dogs and a suite of in vitro drug interaction experimentsThe PK of 
methylthioninium chloride in nonclinical species is dissimilar to the known human PK and thus 
nonclinical evidence is inherently limited. PK data was obtained from toxicokinetic (TK) data from the 
28-day repeat dose dog study with Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 25 mg tablets. Dose dependent 
exposure was observed as demonstrated by observational Cmax and AUC values with significant inter-
animal variability. T1/2 could not be determined in this study due to delayed exposure peaks, likely 
due to the MMX formulation. The PK/TK data in the beagle dog study indicates poor absorption 
following oral administration of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo and is supported by bibliographic 
evidence of poor absorption of methythioninium chloride in nonclinical species. The clinical PK profile of 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo (25 mg tablets) is also characterised by poor systemic absorption, 
however variability is considerably lower and dose proportionality is observed. The potential impact of 
variability in absorption in nonclinical species in relation to the MMX formulation and appropriate dose 
levels for clinical use in the proposed indication was raised during the procedure. Although variability in 
methylene blue absorption could be species dependent, it could also be impacted by other factors 
including gastric emptying, intestinal motility and gastrointestinal pH. Dose selection for clinical use 
was determined using standard spray chromoendoscopy. No animal model was used to confirm the 
release characteristics of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo formulation, however the impact of 
systemic exposure with this formulation is low and no further nonclinical studies are warranted. 
In rats, IV administration of methylene blue leads to high concentrations in the kidney, lung, liver, 
heart and brain. No tissue distribution data was provided for other nonclinical species, including dogs. 
This would usually be insufficient to support the application; however given the limited systemic 
bioavailability with Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo it is unlikely that there will be significant 
distribution to sites other than the colon. Distribution studies of methylene blue in mucosal tissues of 
the intestine after oral use were not included in the original submission. A literature review identified a 
study that provided indirect (faecal sample measurements) evidence suggesting methylene blue 
accumulation in the intestinal mucosa is more profound after oral administration in comparison to the 
intravenous administration. None of the studies in the literature review examined the distribution of 
methylene blue (or MMX formulation) specifically on the intestinal surface. However, the evidence 
provided together with the existing data from the long-term medical use of methylthioninium chloride 
(chromoendoscopy using spray probe) is supportive for the clinical use of methylthioninium chloride 
formulation administered via the gastrointestinal tract. 
Metabolites of methythioninium chloride are anticipated to have greater lipophilicity than the parent 
compound and may accumulate in tissues (IARC monograph Methylene Blue, 2018). A comparative 
accumulation of leucomethylene blue (LMB), Azure A and B – the major metabolites of MB, in tissues, 
possibly related to their increased lipophilicity, was discussed by the applicant. The PK profile of Azure 
B was similar to that of methylthioninium chloride, when given as IV infusion (14C-radiolabelled), with 
a slightly longer elimination phase from tissues. Kidney and liver are the organs with the major 
concentration of radioactivity. Although longer persistence of Azure B in tissues was shown, it however 
not necessarily resulted in tissue accumulation. Plasma binding activity studies were performed to 
supplement the distribution package. High protein binding activity was identified in rats, dogs and 
humans and was approximately concentration-dependent. 
Based on the bibliographic studies provided, the metabolism of methylthioninium chloride is not fully 
understood nonclinically/clinically. The first step involves rapid conversion of methylthioninium chloride 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/424242/2020  
Page 40/119 
 
 
 
 
to leucomethylene blue, which is observed in a range of non-clinical species including mice, rats, 
rabbits and dogs, in addition to humans. Two additional metabolites have been characterised, Azure A 
and B, and are also present in nonclinical species and humans. Sponsor-led studies were performed to 
investigate methylthioninium chloride  drug interaction and methylthioninium chloride was found to be 
a strong inhibitor of several CYP450 enzymes (CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4/5). The 
excretion of methylthioninium chloride is primarily via the urine and feces in nonclinical species, 
comparing to high urinary excretion in humans. Methylthioninium chloride was also identified as an 
inhibitor of P-gp and limited P-gp-mediated absorption was observed in the intestine. Methylthioninium 
chloride was also a potential substrate for OAT3. These drug interactions have been appropriately 
listed in SmPC section 4.5. Methylthioninium chloride has also been identified as a potent inhibitor of 
renal transporters OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2-K (Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue SmPC Section 4.5 
(EMA/CHMP/280202/2018)). This has been included in Section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
The use of dogs as the nonclinical species for toxicology studies, and thus the derived TK data, is of 
limited relevance due to low systemic absorption in dogs. However, the selection is justified on the 
basis of the technical difficulties with oral dosing of the MMX tablets in smaller animals e.g. rats or 
rabbits. Additionally, bioavailability is predicted to be low regardless of the nonclinical species used due 
to the prolonged release formulation. Overall, the PK package, is considered sufficient to support the 
application for Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo. 
Single-dose studies were not conducted in any nonclinical species.The LD50 for various routes of 
administration in various nonclinical species has been provided based on the literature. The LD50 for 
oral administration was 3500 mg/kg (mice) 1180 mg/kg (rat), 1000 mg/kg (rabbit) and 500 mg/kg 
(dog). These doses are considerably higher than the maximum clinical dose (200 mg per patient or 3.3 
mg/kg based on a 60kg human). Acute toxicity findings included hemoconcentration, hypothermia, 
acidosis, hypercapnia, hypoxia, increases in blood pressure, changes in respiratory frequency and 
amplitude, corneal injury, conjunctival damage, and Heinz body formation. These effects are unlikely 
to be observed at the anticipated clinical exposure with Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo.  
Repeat-dose toxicity was investigated in a 28-day oral study in beagle dogs with Methylthioninium 
chloride Cosmo 25 mg tablets. Findings from the GLP-compliant studies conducted as part of the 
National Toxicology Program (NTP) were also included in support of the application and were 
conducted with oral administration of methylthioninium chloride in mice and rats. In the NTP, doses ≥ 
500 mg/kg/day were associated with lethality in both species over 1 month of dosing. 
Methemoglobinemia, regenerative Heinz body anaemia, reduced body weight and organ weight, bone 
marrow hyperplasia and liver lesions were some of the effects noted in methylene blue-treated 
animals. In a 3-month study at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day were administered to both mice and rats. 
Similar effects were observed including methemoglobinemia, regenerative Heinz body anaemia, 
reduced body weight and organ weight at all dose levels. NOAELs were not identified in either study. In 
the GLP-compliant 28-day oral study in beagle dogs, no toxicities were observed with 200, 400 or 600 
mg doses of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo when administered every 4 days (a total of 7 doses). A 
NOAEL of 600 mg was identified in this study. Toxicokinetic (TK) evaluation was performed at Day 1 
and 25. Absorption of the test article was highly variable with delayed exposure peaks and linearity 
could not be confirmed. The variability of intra-animal exposure data on Day 1 and 25 confounds an 
assessment on the potential for accumulation, however this is not a significant concern given the likely 
frequency of use with the proposed indication.  
Due to the relatively limited absorption of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo in dogs, no safety margins 
were achieved against the maximum clinical dose (200 mg,) at the NOAEL (600 mg). From the pivotal 
clinical PK study with Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 25 mg tablets, a single dose (8 x 25 mg 
tablets) gave mean exposures Cmax and AUC0-t of 1.15 ± 0.26 µg/ml and 25.16 ± 7.42 µg/ml.hr, 
respectively. Comparison of exposures in the repeat-dose dog study and clinically demonstrated 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/424242/2020

negative margins at all dose levels. Despite the absence of safety margins, there is significant clinical 
experience with methylthioninium chloride and toxicities are well-known. In consideration of the 
proposed indication for patients undergoing surveillance/screening for colorectal cancer, patient 
exposure will be infrequent (maximum once-yearly according to the RMP) and the potential for 
systemic toxicity is likely to be low. In relation to local tolerance, the observation of the liquid faeces in 
the animals in the control and test groups were of notable incidence and may demonstrate local 
intolerance of the final drug product itself, unrelated to the test article, implying a possible role of 
excipient in this side effect (Study 20160066TCPB). It is stated that medicinal product does not include 
a novel excipient, and all of the excipients used for the medicinal product are commonly used in 
pharmaceuticals for oral administration, therefore an assessment of the information regarding its 
safety is not provided. Since the observed side effect persisted also in the recovery period of 14 days 
after drug withdrawal, it could represent a significant issue. The applicant provided additional 
information on the study to address this. Liquid faeces were observed in both control and treated 
animals, with high variability in frequency during the time, including the off-dose period. A confounding 
factor is represented by collective allocation of animals in boxes, that impeded the individual 
observation. In addition, collective caging may contribute to spread parasitic infection which are often 
undetected (e.g. giardiasis) and are often asymptomatic, with the exception of gastrointestinal 
disturbances. This could explain the persistence of symptoms beyond the treatment period. Based on 
these considerations, the relevance of this effects to humans is unclear, both because the components 
of the MMX tablets are well known as GRAS substances, and because the occurrence of liquid faeces 
during clinical trials was never recorded. The applicant’s justification was considered acceptable. 
No nonclinical genotoxicity studies have been conducted with Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo. The 
applicant has included results from a number of published studies with methylthioninium chloride 
evaluating the mutagenic and clastogenic potential of methylthioninium chloride. Additionally, the 
applicant conducted a clinical study to assess the potential for DNA damage in colonic mucosa when 
white light is applied to the stained area and no evidence was observed in biopsy samples taken after 
the first and second procedure. Based on the information provided from studies in salmonella 
typhimurim and E.coli strains, methylene blue is considered to be both mutagenic and clastogenic. 
Evidence of induced sister chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations in CHO cells indicate 
clastogenic potential. Positive findings in vitro were not observed in vivo at doses of 62 mg/kg 
(intravenous), 12 or 150 mg/kg (intraperitoneal) and 200 mg/kg (oral gavage). However, methylene 
blue is considered genotoxic and this has been noted in Section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
The GLP-compliant 2-year oral study in mice and rats conducted as part of the National Toxicology 
Program suggests methylene blue may demonstrate carcinogenic potential, however methylthioninium 
chloride it is not of significant concern for this application due to the low systemic exposure, short 
duration of treatment and infrequency of administration. 
A phase I environmental risk assessment (ERA) for Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo was performed. 
PBT screening was assessed using a referenced log Kow. As methylene blue is an ionisable substance 
the applicant was requested to provide a log Dow in line with “Guideline on the environmental risk 
assessment of medicinal products for human use”, (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2) and ‘Questions 
and answers on 'Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use', 
(EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010 Rev. 1). The justification for refinement of the FPen to reflect a more 
accurate estimate of market penetration is appropriate, based on an estimate of the number of 
colorectal endoscopy procedures conducted annually in the EU. An appropriate statement on disposal 
has been included in section 6.6 of the SmPC. An experimentally derived n-octanol/water partition 
coefficient will be provided by the MAH post authorisation.

2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Due to the nature of this type of application the nonclinical package is heavily reliant on evidence from 
published studies with methylthioninium chloride, the active substance of Methylthioninium chloride 
Cosmo 25mg tablets. The pharmacology of methylthioninium chloride is considered to be well 
established. The pharmacokinetics of orally-administered methylthioninium chloride is complex and 
varies across nonclinical species, thus limiting the value of PK studies with Methylthioninium chloride 
Cosmo as it is a prolonged-release formula with low bioavailability.  
Overall, the nonclinical package supports the application for Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo in the 
proposed indication. It is considered that the toxicology of methylthioninium chloride is well-known and 
the potential risk with this prolonged-release tablet is low. The toxicology of methylthioninium chloride 
is well-documented in terms of genotoxicity and carcinogenicity although these are not of significant 
concern for the proposed indication in this application. Methylthioninium chloride is a known 
reproductive toxicant and appropriate warnings regarding its use during pregnancy/lactation and in 
WOCBP have been included in the SmPC.  
2.6.  Clinical aspects  
2.6.1.  Introduction 
The Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 25 mg tablet is a gastro-resistant, prolonged release tablet, 
containing methylthioninium chloride equivalent to 25 milligrams of anhydrous methylthioninium 
chloride. The indication is as a diagnostic agent enhancing visualisation of colorectal lesions in adult 
patients undergoing screening or surveillance colonoscopy. 
The active substance, methylthioninium chloride (methylene blue) is the same active substance as in 
the EU reference medicinal product METILÉNKÉK PHARMAMAGIST 1% oldatos injekció approved in 
Hungary. Medicinal products containing methylthioninium chloride have been approved for many years. 
Methylthioninium chloride is already approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) as 
methylthioninium chloride Proveblue for use in adults, children and adolescents for the acute 
symptomatic treatment of medicinal and chemical product induced methaemoglobinaemia (IV 
formulation). 
For Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo, the active substance is the same as in the proposed reference 
product, as well as other EU approved medicinal products, however the indication, strength, 
pharmaceutical form and route of administration for Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo are different. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

2.6.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
The active substance, methylthioninium chloride, is well-known from other EU approved products, 
however the indication, strength, pharmaceutical form and route of administration for 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 25 mg tablet are different. Single doses of 500 mg have been 
administered safely to healthy subjects, and for an indication like treatment of methaemoglobinaemia 
daily IV doses of 2 mg/kg is administered. 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo is designed to act locally in staining the colonic mucosa as an aid for 
the enhanced visualization and detection of colorectal lesions, they exert their effect at the site of 
application. The Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo tablet contains methylthioninium chloride at a 
concentration of 25 mg per tablet. Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo is self-administered by the patient 
at a total oral dose of 200 mg (8 × 25 mg tablets), administered in divided doses according to a simple 
administration schedule coordinated with the bowel cleansing preparation regimen prior to 
colonoscopy. 
Methylthioninium chloride is absorbed and becomes systemically available, and the bioavailability and 
pharmacokinetics of methylthioninium chloride following administration in MMX tablets, were 
investigated and analysed descriptively in the two Phase I studies (table 1).

 In vitro studies were conducted with methylthioninium chloride to determine the plasma protein 
binding (Study CPS/04). In addition, potential interactions of methylthioninium chloride with 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (Studies CPS/06 and CPS/07) and efflux/uptake transporters were 
assessed (Study CPS/05), presented in Table 2.

Both PK studies were conducted in healthy subjects, 36 males and 10 postmenopausal females, from

Absorption 
The MMX tablet formulation has been developed to allow drug delivery in the colon. Absorption is 
delayed and the drug is not detectable in blood until after 3 hours for the 200 mg dose and 5 hours for 
the 400 mg dose.  
The mean absolute bioavailability (Fabs) of methylthioninium chloride when administered as a single 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 200 mg tablet was calculated to be approximately 140%. One 
mechanism for this unexpected high value could be saturation of efflux transporter mechanisms, 
causing a bottleneck in the elimination of methylthioninium chloride from the body. High inter-subject 
variability could also contribute.

To avoid potential unwanted expulsion of the 200 mg monolithic tablet before adequate delivery of 
dye, a 25 mg tablet was developed to allow dived dosing and decrease the risk that all tablets are 
expelled before dye is delivered. This formulation was used in study CB-17-01/02. 
PK parameters of methylthioninium chloride administered as single oral doses of Methylthioninium 
chloride Cosmo 100 mg (4 × 25 mg tablets) and 200 mg (8 × 25 mg tablets) concomitantly with the 
administration of the bowel cleansing preparation are detailed in Table 3. Inter-individual variability in 
methylthioninium chloride PK is high.

Bioequivalence  
The commercial formulation contains 25 mg of methylthioninium chloride per tablet, and is the same 
formulation that was used in Phase 1 Study CB-17-01/02, Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies, and which will 
be used for commercial manufacturing. The only difference between the clinical batches and the 
commercial batches is that an additional drug substance supplier  has been selected for the 
commercialisation phase. Thus, no bioequivalence studies of the 25 mg formulation were necessary 
between Phase 1, 2, or 3 studies. 
Distribution 
The apparent distribution volume of methylthioninium chloride after single iv injection of 100 mg was 
between 160 and 580 L. Methylthioninium chloride has a high volume of distribution indicating both 
extensive distribution to extravascular compartments and high protein binding. With the single 
administration of 200 mg Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo in conjunction of endoscopy, there is no 
concern of clinically relevant accumulation.   
Protein binding of methylthioninium chloride is low/moderate with a range of 62.9% to 86.3% in 
human plasma. 
Elimination 
No ADME study has been conducted.

Elimination t1/2 ranged between 14 and 27 hours after the lower dose and between 6 and 26 hours 
after the higher dose. After single dose of 200 mg of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo the dye was 
quantifiable in blood after 3-12 h of the dosing due to the modified release profile of MMX tablets. After 
single dose of 400 mg of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo the dye became quantifiable in blood after 
5-12 h of the dosing. Systemic exposure to the active principle reached a peak in a median time of 16 
h. 
Following oral administration in man, methylthioninium chloride is largely (78%) metabolised in the 
body to leukomethylene blue, which is excreted primarily in the urine along with the unchanged 
methylthioninium chloride. Urinary excretion is around 40 % of the oral dose. The remaining 
methylthioninium chloride likely is removed by 1) distribution and binding to tissues, 2) metabolism or 
3) biliary excretion, expectedly a combination of all.  
Metabolism 
Methylthioninium chloride is metabolised by CYPs 1A2, 2C19 and 2D6 in vitro; however, the 
predominant in vitro pathway appears to be uridine diphosphate-glucuronyltransferase 
(UGT)-mediated conjugation by multiple UGT enzymes, including UGT1A4 and UGT1A9.  
Azure B, which is a minor impurity in methylthioninium chloride, is also formed in humans as a 
metabolite of methylthioninium chloride. The PK of metabolites has not been investigated, but the 
clinical impact of methylthioninium chloride metabolites is expected to be minimal given the single 
application of methylthioninium chloride in relation to an endoscopic procedure.  
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
In Study CB-17-01/01, peak blood concentration did not increase proportionally with the dose 
escalation. On average, Cmax was very similar after both the 200 mg dose (1.66 ± 0.50 µg/mL) and the 
400 mg dose (1.64 ± 0.73 µg/mL) of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo. AUC was, on average, 
32.94 µg/mL × h after a 200 mg dose and 38.08 µg/mL × h after a 400 mg dose. This could be caused 
by partial saturation of the transporter mechanism, which is partly responsible for drug absorption, so 
that at the dose of 400 mg, part of the dye probably remains in the gastrointestinal tract without being 
absorbed.  
In Study CB-17-01/02, single oral doses of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 100 mg (4 × 25 mg 
tablets) and 200 mg (8 × 25 mg tablets) were administered concomitantly with the administration of 
the bowel cleansing preparation.  
The rate and extent of exposure (Cmax and AUC, respectively) increased proportionally with the dose: 
Cmax was, on average, 2 fold higher after the 200 mg dose (1.15 ± 0.26 µg/mL) than after the 100 
mg dose (0.57 ± 0.18 µg/mL). Also, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ were on average 2.5 fold higher after 200 
mg than after 100 mg.

In general, dose proportionality was seen between the 100 mg and 200 mg dose. For the 400 mg 
dose, peak blood concentration did not increase proportionally. The explanation has not been 
investigated, but saturation of transporter mechanisms is hypothesized.  
No studies have been conducted to investigate methylthioninium chloride time dependency. Time 
dependency is not likely to be clinically relevant for single dose administration. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
The applicant has not conducted studies to assess PK characteristics in the ‘patient’ population as 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo’s  effectiveness is not considered to be related to systemic ADME 
characteristics, given that the product is a locally applied vital dye of the colonic mucosa. Initial 
tolerability studies were not conducted in the ‘patient’ population as the active substance is well 
known. 
No PK studies in special population have been conducted. The 46 subjects included in the two PK 
studies were overall highly homogenous and no Pop PK analyses have been conducted to assess the 
impact of covariates in PK.

Period 1: 100 mg dose group; period 2: 20 mg dose group 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo should be used with caution in patients with moderate to severe 
renal impairment as there are no data in this patient group and methylthioninium chloride is 
predominantly renally eliminated. Based on clinical trial analysis (see Clinical Safety), no dose 
adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. There is no experience in 
patients with severe hepatic impairment. PK data in patients ≥ 75 years of age are limited, but the 
safety profile is overall similar across age groups. No dose adjustment is required for elderly patients. 
No studies in children have been conducted. Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo should not be used in 
children (as reflected in sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC).

Pharmacokinetic interactions 
Serotonin syndrome has been reported with the use of methylthioninium chloride class 
productsProvepharm SAS 2016). Safety announcements released by the US FDA and the UK Medicines 
and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency have indicated that most cases of CNS toxicity/serotonin 
syndrome occurred in the context of IV administration of methylthioninium chloride as a visualising 
agent in preparation for parathyroid or thyroid surgery (US FDA 2011; UK MHRA 2009). Most reports 
of serotonin syndrome with IV methylthioninium chloride  have been associated with concomitant use 
of serotonergic drugs, some tricyclic antidepressants and other psychiatric medications, and 
monoamine oxidase inhibitors Provepharm SAS 2016). Not all serotonergic drugs have equal capacity 
to cause serotonin syndrome with IV methylthioninium chloride. The cases of serotonin syndrome with 
IV methylthioninium chloride occurred in patients taking specific serotonergic psychiatric drugs, namely 
a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. For 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo, the clinical impact is expected to be minimal due to the short 
treatment duration also when co-administered with sedatives.

Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
Potential interactions of methylthioninium chloride cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and efflux/uptake 
transporters were assessed in vitro.  
The inhibitory potential of methylthioninium chloride to inhibit CYP isozymes is substantial. In vitro, 
methylthioninium chloride directly inhibited human CYP isozymes 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 
3A4/5 at therapeutic concentrations. Potential time-dependent inhibition was found for CYP isozymes 
2B6 and 2C9, and irreversible mechanism-based inhibition > 70% was found for all CYP isozymes 
tested. In more details, the inhibition profile of methylthioninium chloride in the concentration range of 
0 μM to 500 μM towards human CYP isozymes 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4/5 was 
assessed in vitro in pooled human liver microsomes in the presence of reduced β-nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide phosphate (β-NADPH), phosphate buffer, and a substrate. 
Total time-dependent inhibition (TDI) was determined by pre-incubation of methylthioninium chloride 
and the CYP isozyme for 30 minutes with cofactor before addition of the substrate. Total TDI by 500 
μM methylthioninium chloride ranged from > 92.6% for CYP1A2 (phenacetin used as the substrate) to 
> 99.3% for CYP3A4/5 (midazolam used as the substrate). The IC50 was in the range of 0.0659 μM 
(CYP1A2) to 0.835 μM (CYP2B6). A shift in the IC50 of > 2-fold after the 30-minute pre-incubation 
period indicates TDI potential. This threshold was passed by CYP2B6 (2.63-fold) and CYP2C9 (2.18-
fold), showing likely TDI by methylthioninium chloride. In addition, possible TDI by methylthioninium 
chloride was indicated for CYP2D6 (1.38-fold), CYP3A4/5 (1.35-fold with testosterone as the substrate; 
1.18-fold with midazolam as the substrate) and CYP2C8 (1.16-fold), although this cannot be 
definitively concluded due to the potent reversible inhibition observed. For CYP1A2 (0.700-fold) and 
CYP2C19 (0.349-fold), TDI by methylthioninium chloride was unlikely. 
Irreversible mechanism-based inhibition (MBI) was determined with pre-incubation for 30 minutes 
without cofactor (Table 3). Irreversible MBI by 500 μM methylthioninium chloride ranged from 73.1% 
for CYP1A2 (phenacetin used as the substrate) to > 99.0% for CYP3A4/5 (midazolam used as the 
substrate). The IC50 was in the range of 0.0445 μM (CYP1A2) to 1.08 μM (CYP2D6). 
Methylthioninium chloride induces CYP1A2 and CYP2B6 in human hepatocytes at concentrations ≥ 0.8 
µM, which are below therapeutic concentrations, as Cmax for methylthioninium chloride is 1.66 µg/mL 
equivalent to 5.2 µM (methylthioninium chloride relative molecular mass 319.85).  
Methylthioninium  chloride  was  in  vitro  identified  to  be  a  substrate  both  for  the  renal  solute  carrier 
transporters P-gp and OAT3 and potentially acts as a mild inhibitor of P-gp (concentration of drug causing 
50% inhibition of enzyme activity = 49.7 µM). Methylthioninium chloride is not a substrate or an inhibitor 
of OAT1.  
The clinical consequences of changes in plasma concentrations of co-administered drugs which are 
substrates of these metabolic enzymes and transporters are not known but cannot be excluded. 
However they are considered likely to be minimal due to the single administration. 
Methylthioninium chloride has also been identified as a potent inhibitor of renal transporters OCT2, 
MATE1 and MATE2-K (Methylthioninium chloride Proveblue SmPC Section 4.5 
(EMA/CHMP/280202/2018)).

Exposure relevant for safety evaluation 
The daily IV dose indicated for the treatment of methaemoglobinaemia with the products available on 
the market at the time this programme began was up to 2 mg/kg of body weight. Thus, in a man of 60 
kg, the maximal daily dose would be 120 mg. In the US, the maximal daily oral dose of 
methylthioninium chloride indicated for the treatment of bladder infections with Urolene blue® is 195 
mg, while for the treatment of infections of the urinary tract with Mictasol bleu®, a maximal daily dose 
of 180 mg is recommended. In the treatment of ifosfamide induced encephalopathy, daily IV injections 
of up to 300 mg of methylthioninium chloride are recommended. ProveDye®, indicated as a 
visualisation aid for surgical procedures, is used at a range of doses (1 mg to 30 mg) depending on the 
procedure being performed. 
2.6.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Methylthioninium  chloride  is  known  to  be  a  “vital  dye”,  meaning  “a  dye  or  stain  agent  capable  of 
penetrating  living  cells  or  tissues  and  not  inducing  immediate  evident  degenerative  changes”. 
Methylthioninium chloride is taken up across the cell membrane into the cytoplasm of actively absorbing 
cells such as those found in the small intestine and colon.  
The Multi-Matrix (MMX) formulation of methylthioninium chloride was developed as an oral drug product 
to provide a locally released dye for use during colonoscopy that would maximise the staining contrast 
in mucosal lesions while minimising variability inherent in operator delivered sprays. The formulation is 
designed with extended release characteristics using a film coating that dissolves at pH 7 or above, a 
condition  normally  achieved  in  the  terminal  ileum,  so  that  methylthioninium  chloride  is  progressively 
released directly into the colon. Once the film coating has dissolved, the MMX formulation determines a 
slow release  of the dye, resulting in its homogeneous and prolonged  dispersion on the surface of the 
colonic mucosa during the tablets’ transit through the colon. The maximum local bioavailability of the 
methylthioninium chloride in the colon is thus achieved and, consequently, the contrast enhancing effect 
is optimised. 
There is no molecular or other interaction between methylene blue and MMX tablets, which may alter 
the pharmacodynamics (PD) of methylene blue. The MMX acts as a passive carrier of methylene blue 
to the colon lumen and mucosa, preventing its release in the small bowel. There is no evidence of any 
structural change in methylene blue due to the gastric transit, and pH and time are responsible for the 
extended delivery of methylene blue from the tablet to the targeted colorectal mucosa. Thus, the 
methylene blue that is passively delivered by MMX at the colorectal level is exactly the same molecule 
with the same PD properties that is used in routine chromoendoscopy. 
The pharmacodynamics of methylene blue are well known and it is still widely used for long time in 
humans for a variety of medical purposes, as both a medication and a dye. No new relevant studies on 
the mechanism of action of the compound have been conducted by the applicant, the efficacy of 
staining is evaluated during the clinical studies. 
Primary pharmacology 
•  Colon staining assessments were performed in five clinical studies, CB-17-01/02, CB-17-01/03, 
CB-17-01/04, CB-17-01/05, and CB-17-01/08. Four regions of interest (ROIs) in the colon 
were defined (ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon and rectosigmoid colon) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/424242/2020  
Page 52/119 
 
 
 
 
and each given a staining score based upon the proportion of colon mucosa stained as 
assessed by the investigator against predefined criteria, using a 0-5 scoring system.  
Results were expressed as staining score (SC) for each ROI, Total Staining Score (TSC) i.e., the sum of 
all SCs and NSA= Number of Stained Areas with SC > 2.  
Colonic mucosa staining quality was satisfactory (i.e., TSC ≥ 8 and no over-staining in any ROI) in all 
subjects evaluated in both dose groups (100 mg and 200 mg), but a better result was achieved in the 
200 mg dose group. 
Ten different tablet administration schedules for the total amount of 150 mg (schedules A, B, C) or 
200 mg (schedules D, E, F, G, H, I, and J) doses were investigated in small groups of subjects during 
the study, as shown in Table 11.

Secondary pharmacology 
Potential effect of the oral administration of 200 mg Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo tablets on the 
integrity of colonic epithelial double stranded DNA during a full chromoendoscopy in comparison with a 
standard white light colonoscopy without the use of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo was investigated 
in a small exploratory study (Study CB-17-01/08). There was no evidence of damage to colonic 
epithelial double stranded DNA in the study (data not shown). 
2.6.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 25 mg tablet is a gastro-resistant, prolonged release tablet. The 
active substance, also known as methylthioninium chloride, has been approved for many years in 
different formulations and for different indications.  
The MMX formulation improves delivery of methylthioninium chloride in the colon, where it is locally 
released and acts as a visual dye to enhance the staining contrast in mucosal lesions. For the proposed 
indication, the proposed posology of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo is as single oral administration 
of a split 200 mg dose during and after oral bowel cleansing preparation.  
Assessment report

Systemic absorption after oral administration is substantial. Single doses of 500 mg have been 
administered safely to healthy subjects, and for other indications daily IV doses of 2 mg/kg are 
administered. The absolute bioavailability was 140 %. This is unusual, but besides high inter-subject 
variability, an underlying mechanism could be saturation of efflux transporter mechanisms causing a 
bottleneck in the elimination of methylthioninium chloride from the body. The absolute bioavailability 
was roughly calculated in two different populations on mean AUC0-∞ values from the ratios of AUC0-∞ 
values after single oral dose of 400 mg and single i.v. injection of 100 mg to be 78%.  
A 25 mg tablet was developed to allow dived dosing and decrease the risk that all tablets are expelled 
before dye is delivered. The intended delay in absorption was demonstrated, as the drug was not 
detectable in blood until after 3 hours for the 200 mg dose and 5 hours for the 400 mg dose. The 
divided dose (8 x 25 mg) resulted in lower Cmax values compared to a single dose (1x 200 mg), which 
is preferred in relation to safety.  
Dose proportionality was seen between the 100 mg and 200 mg dose. For the 400 mg dose, peak 
blood concentration did not increase proportionally, possibly due to saturation of transporter 
mechanisms. Lack of dose proportionality between the 200 mg and 400 mg dose support the 200 mg 
dose.   
Methylene blue has a high volume of distribution indicating both extensive distribution to extravascular 
compartments and high protein binding. With the single administration of Methylthioninium chloride 
Cosmo in conjunction of endoscopy, there is no concern of clinically relevant accumulation.   
Urinary excretion in the two PK studies was around 40 % of the oral dose. This is in line with what has 
previously been found for methylthioninium chloride.  
The summary of methylthioninium chloride metabolism is mainly based on information available from 
EU-approved methylthioninium chloride products. Published literature describing the metabolism of 
methylthioninium chloride is scarce. Methylthioninium chloride is well-known as active substance from 
other EU approved products and even though the data presented to support the metabolism of 
methylene blue are suboptimal, metabolism has been adequately described. Methylthioninium chloride 
is metabolised by CYPs 1A2, 2C19 and 2D6 in vitro; however, the predominant in vitro pathway is – 
according to product information from other methylthioninium chloride products - uridine diphosphate 
glucuronyltransferase (UGT) mediated conjugation by multiple UGT enzymes, including UGT1A4 and 
UGT1A9.  
Potential interactions of methylthioninium chloride with cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and 
efflux/uptake transporters were assessed in vitro. No clinical DDI studies have been conducted, which 
is acceptable for this single dose administration treatment. The inhibitory potential of methylthioninium 
chloride to inhibit CYP isozymes is substantial. In vitro, methylthioninium chloride directly inhibited 
human CYP isozymes 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4/5 at therapeutic concentrations. 
Potential time-dependent inhibition was found for CYP isozymes 2B6 and 2C9, and irreversible 
mechanism-based inhibition > 70% was found for all CYP isozymes tested. The clinical impact of the 
inhibitory potential of methylthioninium chloride is expected to be limited due to the short treatment 
duration. 
Methylthioninium chloride induces CYP1A2 and CYP2B6 in human. However, also here the risk of 
clinically relevant DDIs is considered to be minor due to the relative short treatment durations and 
almost complete elimination of methylthioninium chloride after 72 hours. 
Methylthioninium chloride was in vitro identified to be a substrate both for the renal solute carrier 
transporters P-gp and OAT3 and potentially acts as a mild inhibitor of P-gp. Decrease in excretion 
efficiency would not be expected to be clinically relevant for a split, single dose administration.

Both PK studies were conducted in healthy subjects, 36 males and 10 postmenopausal females, from 
18-65 years of age, and therefore PK has been investigated in a very homogenous population. No 
studies in special populations, i.e. subjects with impaired renal or hepatic function, elderly or children 
have been conducted. This is acceptable. Based on clinical trial analysis (see Clinical Safety) there is no 
evidence that hepatic impairment impacts on the safety profile of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo. No 
warnings or dose adjustments are required in respect of hepatic impairment. There are no data in 
patients with severe hepatic impairment. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild renal 
impairment (see Clinical Safety), but should be used with caution in patients with moderate to severe 
renal impairment as there are no data in this patient group and methylthioninium chloride is 
predominantly renally eliminated (relevant information is reflected in SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.2). No 
Pop PK studies have been conducted, which is acceptable. 
The mechanism of action of methylthioninium chloride is well-known. The MMX formulation with 
extended release and protection against dissolving at pH < 7 enhance release of methylthioninium 
chloride into the colon and the split dose administration protects against the risk of potential expulsion 
as a result of the concomitant administered full bowel preparation.  
Colonic mucosa staining quality was satisfactory (i.e., TSC ≥ 8 and no over-staining in any ROI) in all 
subjects evaluated in both dose groups (100 mg and 200 mg), but a better result was achieved in the 
200 mg dose group. This is supportive of the 200 mg dose. 
The methylthioninium chloride that is passively delivered by MMX at the colorectal level is exactly the 
same molecule with the same PD properties that is used in routine chromoendoscopy. The literature 
appears to be comprehensive with regard to the specific action of methylthioninium chloride and 
inactive content of MMX tablets in the application in chromoendoscopy under consideration. The 
material presented is considered sufficient regarding pharmacodynamic. 
The methylthioninium chloride  is not selective in identifying a specific type of lesion from other types 
of lesions, it does not provide any insight for differentiation of certain type of lesion. Available evidence 
suggests that methylthioninium chloride has a different uptake in normal mucosal cells compared to 
dysplastic or pre-neoplastic mucosal cells which allows for an enhancement of contrast and facilitates 
lesion detection. As the product is aimed to improve current practice, provided information regarding 
efficiency and PD correlation could be considered acceptable. 
Different dosing regimens of the 8x 25 mg tablets before, during and after the bowel preparation have 
been included in the clinical trials. Firm conclusions are challenged by small numbers and different 
doses. The dosing instructions have been adapted to be independent of the bowel cleansing regimen 
with the two most important aspects being sufficient time between first Methylthioninium chloride 
Cosmo administration and colonoscopy and that first dose should be administered after the first portion 
of the bowel preparation (this is reflected in SmPC 4.2). 
2.6.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  clinical  pharmacology  program  to  support  the  application  is  limited,  but  adequate  to  supplement 
what is well-known about the PK of methylthioninium chloride. The split 200 mg dose split is supported 
from a PK point of view.

The recommended dose of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo is a single dose of 200 mg, to be 
administered in conjunction with the bowel cleansing preparation prior to colonoscopy. 
Phase 2 Study CB-17-01/03 suggested that a dose of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 200 mg 
provided better colon staining than a dose of 150 mg. Phase 3 Study CB-17-01/06 also supports a 
conclusion that the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 200 mg dose is better than a lower dose, such as 
100 mg, for the detection of adenomas and carcinomas during colonoscopy. 
To control for the potential for acquisition bias, by masking the active arm of the pivotal study from the 
investigator (endoscopist) and provide subject blinding between the placebo and Methylthioninium 
chloride Cosmo 200mg groups after dosing, a 100 mg dose group was included in the pivotal CB-17-
01/06 study. Fewer subjects were enrolled in the 100 mg dose group, and the study was not powered 
to show statistically significant differences between the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 100 mg 
group and the placebo group, or between the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 100 mg group and the

200 mg group. However, a clear dose-response trend was observed for most of the relevant endpoints, 
including the primary efficacy endpoint and key secondary and exploratory endpoints. The low dose 
group (Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 100 mg) consistently obtained values numerically 
intermediate between full dose and placebo for all the main efficacy endpoints.  
To further investigate the dose-response relationship, several additional analyses were conducted on 
selected endpoints for dose-response using the Cochran-Armitage trend test (one-sided). With respect 
to the primary endpoint, in the FAS, the proportion of subjects with at least one histologically proven 
adenoma or carcinoma in the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 100 mg group was intermediate 
between placebo and Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 200 mg, with a statistically significant test for 
dose response (Cochran-Armitage trend test p = 0.0042). Statistically significant dose response was 
also demonstrated for other endpoints, including the proportion of subjects with at least one excised 
non-polypoid lesion (p = 0.0025) and proportion of subjects with at least one non-polypoid 
histologically proven adenoma or carcinoma < 10 mm (p = 0.0027). Thus, Methylthioninium chloride 
Cosmo shows a very clear dose-response relationship throughout the 100 mg and 200 mg dosing 
range, with 200 mg being the most effective dose. Overall, the results throughout the clinical 
development programme and the dose-response relationship evident in Study CB-17-01/06 provides 
support for the selection of 200 mg as the recommended total dose of Methylthioninium chloride 
Cosmo, to be administered in a divided dose of 8 × 25 mg tablets although higher doses were not 
investigated.

Treatments 
Bowel cleansing preparation 
All subjects received a full dose regimen of 4 litres PEG-based bowel cleansing preparation starting in 
the late afternoon (after 6 pm) before the colonoscopy day. The subjects drank at least 250 mL of 
solution every 15 min, so that the intake of the cleansing preparation, and study drug was completed 
in 4 hours.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/424242/2020  
Page 59/119 
 
 
 
 
Subjects had to adopt a low residue diet for three days prior to the colonoscopy. On the third day of 
the low residue diet patients they had to fast for at least 3 h before starting intake of the bowel prep 
and study drug. During the intake of bowel preparation, the subjects were recommended to drink 
additional non-gaseous water according to the product instructions. Subjects were to be fasting from 
3-4 h prior to beginning of the intake of the bowel preparation solution until the completion of the 
colonoscopy the following day. Non-gaseous water and clear liquids intake were freely allowed. 
Dose regimen 
The subjects were randomized 2:2:1 into three groups: 
Group One received an oral dose of 200 mg of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 25 mg tablets: 3 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 25 mg tablets (75 mg) after the first 2 litres of bowel preparation, 3 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 25 mg tablets (75 mg) after a total of 3 litres of bowel preparation 
and, finally, 2 Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 25 mg tablets (50mg) after a total of 4 litres of bowel 
preparation had been consumed. 
Group Two received an oral dose of matching placebo tablets: 3 tablets after the first 2 litres of bowel 
preparation, 3 tablets after a total of 3 litres of bowel preparation and, finally, 2 tablets after a total of 
4 litres of bowel preparation had been consumed. 
Group Three was included only for masking purposes in order to reduce the acquisition bias due to the 
lack of investigator and subject blinding between placebo and Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 200 
mg groups. This unpowered masking group was treated with 100 mg Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 
25 mg tablets: 1 tablet (25mg) of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 25mg tablets and two placebo 
tablets after the first 2 litres of bowel preparation, additional 2 tablets (50 mg) of Methylthioninium 
chloride Cosmo 25mg tablets and one placebo tablet after a total of 3 litres of bowel preparation, and, 
finally, 1 tablet (25 mg) of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 25 mg tablet, and one placebo tablet after 
a total of 4 litres of bowel preparation solution had been consumed. 
Objectives 
The objective of the study was the evaluation of the Adenoma or Carcinoma detection rate in patients 
undergoing a full colonoscopy after colonic mucosal staining and contrast enhancing with 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo tablets compared to placebo tablets. The adenoma detection rate 
(ADR) was defined as the proportion of patients with at least one histologically proven Adenoma or 
Carcinoma. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint (adenoma detection rate (ADR)):  
The primary endpoint of this study was to assess the detection efficacy of chromoendoscopy performed 
with 200 mg Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 25 mg tablets versus placebo tablets (white light 
endoscopy) in terms of the proportion of patients with at least one histologically proven Adenoma or 
Carcinoma. Adenoma was defined as a histologically proven Vienna Grade 3 to 4.2 or a histologically 
proven Traditional Serrated Adenoma (TSA), or a histologically proven Sessile Serrated Adenoma 
(SSA). Histologically proven Carcinoma was defined as Vienna Grade 4.3 to 5b. 
The Vienna Classification and TSA and SSA grading was made by blinded central laboratory 
pathologists who reviewed slides prepared from an additional tissue section of each paraffin embedded 
specimen prepared at the local centre laboratory in accordance with the specific histology charter.

excision of the identified lesions. 
Changes in the definition of the primary endpoint while the study was ongoing 
The Study Protocol originally provided for adenomas to be defined according to the “Vienna 
Classification” as the histological Grade 3 to 4.2. But the “Vienna Classification” does not take into 
account certain lesions named Traditional Serrated Adenomas (TSAs) and Sessile Serrated Adenomas 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/424242/2020  
Page 61/119 
 
 
 
 
(SSAs), although the Study Protocol provided for their separate identification and listing as mucosal 
lesions. 
At the time the Study Protocol was filed, certain major scientific findings were not yet globally 
acknowledged. Now there is widespread consensus between endoscopists and histologists that TSAs 
and SSAs are precursors of colorectal carcinomas and need to be removed because of their nature, 
independently from their score under the “Vienna Classification”. Exclusion of TSAs and SSAs from the 
primary end-point would lead to an incomplete assessment of lesions with malignant potential. The 
objective of the study was to identify all lesions that need to be removed which have the potential to 
degenerate and turn into cancers. Therefore, TSAs and SSAs were included in the primary endpoint in 
addition to the “Vienna Classification” grade 3 to 4.2 lesions. The calculation of the adenomas detection 
rate and into all the other efficacy evaluations based on the histological classification. 
Sample size 
A retrospective study on 5175 subjects found out an adenoma and carcinoma detection rate around 
30% (95% CI [26.7%-31.8%]) for white light colonoscopy. Considering an improvement of 10%, 
deemed to be clinically significant, due to the use of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo® (this 
hypothesis is strongly supported by the results on the first 100 subjects of phase II trial) the expected 
adenoma a carcinoma detection rate for chromoendoscopy is 40%. 
The superiority of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo® full dose versus Placebo was tested in terms of 
the adjusted odds ratio derived from a logistic regression model. 
Under the hypothesis of a 2:2:1 allocation among full dose test group, placebo control group and low 
dose masking group, the sample size required in order to show superiority of full dose 
chromoendoscopy with respect of white light colonoscopy in terms of adenoma and carcinoma 
detection rate increase is listed below. 
Considering an exclusion rate from the Full Analysis Set around 5%, at least 1270 subjects have to be 
enrolled. 
Randomisation 
The subjects are randomised using a central system. Randomisation is stratified by centre and reason 
for colonoscopy (screening, surveillance within 2 years from previous colonoscopy and surveillance 
after more than 2 years from previous colonoscopy). Subjects are allocated to the full dose of 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo arm, placebo control arm or low dose of Methylthioninium chloride 
Cosmo arm according to a 2:2:1 ratio. 
Blinding (masking) 
The trial was double blind at randomisation. The investigator and the subject were not aware of the 
treatment the subject was assigned, although during colonoscopy and afterwards due to the blue dye 
characteristics the endoscopist and subject were likely to have become aware of the assigned 
treatment.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/424242/2020  
Page 62/119 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Due to the lack of blindness, a low dose arm of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo was included for 
masking purposes only. Only the full dose arm of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo and the placebo 
arm were included in the primary efficacy analysis, while the low dose arm of Methylthioninium 
chloride Cosmo was included in the evaluation of demographic, baseline and background 
characteristics, in the secondary and exploratory efficacy analysis and in the evaluation of safety and 
tolerability. 
 Statistical methods 
Analysis sets 
Intention-to-Treat Set (ITT): all randomised subjects regardless of investigational medicinal product 
intake, colonoscopy execution and colon cleansing. This analysis set was used for sensitivity analyses. 
Full Analysis Set (FAS): all randomised subjects who received at least one dose of the investigational 
medicinal product and underwent colonoscopy (regardless of the completion status). This analysis set 
was be used for the primary efficacy analysis. 
Per Protocol Set (PP): all randomised subjects who will fulfilled the study protocol requirements in 
terms of investigational medicinal product intake and collection of primary efficacy data (full 
colonoscopy successfully executed), who had an acceptable colon cleansing (defined as a Boston 
Bowel Preparation Score ≥ 1 in the right colon, transverse colon and left colon; missing scores will not 
lead to exclusion), who did not have any inclusion/exclusion criteria violation and with no major 
deviations that may have affected study results. This analysis set was to be used for sensitivity 
analyses. 
Safety Set: all subjects who received at least one dose of the investigational medicinal product. This 
analysis was used for safety analyses. 
Subjects assigned to the wrong randomization category 
The randomisation list is stratified by centre and reason for colonoscopy (screening, surveillance 
within 2 years from previous colonoscopy and surveillance after more than 2 years from previous 
colonoscopy). Some subjects were by mistake assigned to a stratum of the randomisation list not 
consistent with their actual reason for colonoscopy. Subjects will be analysed according to the 
treatment they actually received and to their actual reason for colonoscopy, despite disagreement with 
the randomisation list. 
Primary efficacy analysis 
The proportion of subjects included in the Full Analysis Set with at least one histologically proven 
Adenoma or Carcinoma found during colonoscopy was summarised by treatment (Methylthioninium 
chloride Cosmo Full Dose, Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo Low Dose and Placebo). Odds ratio, 
difference in proportions and their 95% confidence intervals was presented. 
The proportion of subjects included in the Full Analysis Set (Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo Full 
Dose and Placebo only) with at least one histologically proven Adenoma or Carcinoma found during 
colonoscopy was analysed through a logistic regression and treatment, centre, age, sex, reason for 
colonoscopy (screening, surveillance within 2 years from previous colonoscopy and surveillance after 
more than 2 years from previous colonoscopy) and number of excisions (categorised as "≤ 3", "4 - 6" 
and "> 6") were included in the regression model as fixed effects.

Sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint 
Per protocol analysis: The proportion of subjects included in the Per Protocol Set (Methylthioninium 
chloride Cosmo Full Dose arm and Placebo arm only) with at least one histologically proven Adenoma 
or Carcinoma found during colonoscopy was analysed through the same logistic regression model as 
used for the primary endpoint. 
Centre by treatment interaction: In order to evaluate the presence of a centre by treatment 
interaction, the proportion of subjects included in the Full Analysis Set (Methylthioninium chloride 
Cosmo Full Dose arm and Placebo arm only) with at least one histologically proven Adenoma or 
Carcinoma found during colonoscopy was analysed by the same logistic regression model as used for 
the primary endpoint. 
Multiple imputation: The proportion of subjects included in the FAS (Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 
Full Dose arm and Placebo arm only) with at least one histologically proven Adenoma or Carcinoma 
found during colonoscopy was analysed through the same logistic regression model as used for the 
primary endpoint. Missing values of the primary endpoint were replaced according to a multiple 
imputation under MAR assumption method. The multiple imputation model will use treatment, centre, 
age, sex, reason for colonoscopy, and number of excisions as covariates. A monotone missing pattern 
was used. The number of imputation data sets was set to 100. 
Worst case analysis: The proportion of subjects included in the FAS (Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 
Full Dose arm and Placebo arm only) with at least one histologically proven Adenoma or Carcinoma 
found during colonoscopy were analysed through the same logistic regression model as used for the 
primary endpoint. Missing values of the primary endpoint were replaced according to a worst-case 
method. For each subject, missing values of the primary endpoint were replaced with the worst value 
of that variable (i.e. 0 - Failure) if the subject was assigned to the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 
Full Dose arm and with the best value of that variable (i.e. 1 - Success) if the subject was assigned to 
the Placebo arm. 
Handling of missing data 
Intention-to-Treat Set (ITT): all missing values of the primary endpoint were replaced according to the 
MI under MAR assumption method and according to the WC method in order to perform two distinct 
sensitivity analyses. Missing values of the secondary endpoints were not be replaced. 
Full Analysis Set (FAS): all subjects of the FAS underwent colonoscopy and the presence/absence of at 
least one histologically proven Adenoma or Carcinoma detected during colonoscopy could be evaluated 
for each subject. No replacement of missing data was required for the primary endpoint. Missing 
values of the secondary endpoints were not be replaced. 
Per Protocol Set (PP): all subjects of the PP underwent colonoscopy and the presence/absence of at 
least one histologically proven Adenoma or Carcinoma detected during colonoscopy could be evaluated 
for each subject. No replacement of missing data was required for the primary endpoint. Missing 
values of the secondary endpoints were not be replaced. 
Safety Set: all missing safety and tolerability data (vital signs, clinical laboratory test results) were not 
be replaced. 
Secondary endpoints 
The secondary and exploratory endpoints were summarised by descriptive statistics only (mean, 
standard deviation [SD], coefficient of variation [CV%], minimum, median and maximum values for 
quantitative variables and by frequencies for qualitative variables) with the exception of the FPR. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/424242/2020  
Page 64/119 
 
 
 
 
The FPR was evaluated as the proportion of patients who did not have histologically confirmed 
Adenoma or Carcinoma but did have at least one excision. The False Positive Rate (FPR) was 
compared between Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo Full Dose and Placebo according to the following 
hypothesis test: 
H0 = FPR Full Dose - FPR Placebo ≥ PThreshold 
Ha = FPR Full Dose - FPR Placebo < PThreshold 
The null hypothesis was rejected if the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval of the difference 
FPR Full Dose - FPR Placebo was less than the proportion PThreshold. 
The false positive rate retrieved from the first 100 subjects of phase II trial was around 26% and the 
ones retrieved from literature ranged from 24% to 30%. The proportion of subjects with excisions 
with respect to the enrolled ones ranged from 41% to 61%. 
Considering the worst case (i.e. a FPR of 30% for Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo Full Dose and a 
FPR of 24% for Placebo) and supposing that around 50% of enrolled subjects per arm (i.e. 250 
subjects per arm) would undergo at least one excision, the 95% confidence interval of the difference 
of the FPRs could be determined to be [-1.8% - 13.8%]. According to this result, a PThreshold of 15% 
for the FPR difference between Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo Full Dose Placebo was established. 
The same PThreshold of 15% and the same hypothesis test were to be used for the comparisons 
between Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo Low Dose and Placebo and between Methylthioninium 
chloride Cosmo Full Dose and Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo Low Dose. 
Changes from the Statistical Analyses Plan 
There were the following additions to the planned analyses as described in the SAP Final Version 1.0 
dated 08 April 2016: 
Proportion of patients with at least one histologically proven Adenoma or Carcinoma (FAS), Fisher's 
exact tests were performed for the three pairwise comparisons Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo Full 
Dose versus Placebo, Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo Low Dose versus Placebo and Methylthioninium 
chloride Cosmo Full Dose versus Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo Low Dose. This test was not 
foreseen in the SAP and was added during the analysis, but does not replace the primary analysis 
based on the logistic regression model. 
Additional tables were produced, as additional informative and exploratory analyses, to summarize the 
FPR calculation at excision level for the FAS and PP Set, respectively. The FPR at excision level was to 
be calculated as the proportion of histologically negative lesions among all the excisions.   
Other changes included addition of tables and clarification of data sets. 
Additional analysis (not listed in the SAP) were presented after interaction with the EMA. 
The primary analysis was redone excluding the post-randomization variable “number of excisions”. 
The primary analysis was re calculated using the definition presented in the older version of the 
protocol (version 1.2 Amendment 1, date 16 September 2013) and thus excluding SSAs and TSAs.

Results 
Participant flow 
Recruitment 
Patients were recruited from 20 centres in Europe and North America from 15 December 2013 (First 
Patient Enrolled) to 20 October 2016 (Last Patient Completed). 
Conduct of the study 
The protocol was amended twice. First amendment intended to make the protocol applicable to both 
EMA and FDA. The second amendment involved a change of the primary efficacy endpoint to include 
SSA and TSA in the ADR (see statistical analysis). 
Protocol   deviations   were   defined   as   major   or   minor   during   the   blind   review 
meeting/conference.  
For the ITT Set, a total of 593/1249 patients (47.5%) had deviations, with similar proportions of 
patients with deviations across the treatment groups. 
Major deviations were reported for a total of 112/1249 patients (9.0%) in the ITT Set, with a slightly  
higher  proportion  of  patients  in  the  Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo Full  Dose  group (49/504 
patients; 9.7%), when  compared  to  the  Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo Low  Dose  group (22/247 
patients; 8.9%) and the placebo group (41/498 patients; 8.2%). 
Overall, reasons for major deviations included: 
•   Lack of any data post randomisation (43 patients; 3.4%); 
•   Failure to take at least one dose of IMP (41 patients; 3.3%); 
•   Full colonoscopy not successfully executed (25 patients; 2.0%); 
•   3rd or 4th endoscopist performed procedure (24 patients; 1.9%); 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/424242/2020  
Page 66/119 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Lack of cleansing (16 patients; 1.3%); 
•   Lack of compliance to the IMP (8 patients; 0.6%); 
•   Failure to satisfy any inclusion/exclusion criteria (4 patients; 0.3%); 
•   Non study endoscopist performed procedure (2 patients; 0.2%); 
•   Missing information about IMP intake (1 patient; 0.1%). 
Minor deviations were reported for a total of 564/1249 patients (45.2%) in the ITT Set, with similar 
proportions of patients with minor deviations across the treatment groups. 
Overall, minor deviations reported by >5% of patients in the ITT Set, included: 
•   Incorrect bowel preparation procedure (91 patients; 7.3%); 
•   Follow up visit out of window (88 patients; 7.0%); 
•   No recording from colonoscopy (77 patients; 6.2%). 
Baseline data 
Demographic  characteristics  varied slightly across the treatment groups. No clinically 
relevant differences regarding these characteristics were observed when comparing the different 
treatment groups.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
A total of 626/1205 patients (51.95%) in the overall population for the FAS had at least one 
histologically proven Adenoma or Carcinoma found during colonoscopy (Table 11-6). The proportion of 
patients was highest in the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo full dose group (56.29% of patients) 
when compared to the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo low dose group (51.45% of patients) and the 
placebo group (47.81% of patients). Results showed that the odds ratio [95% CI] of 1.41 [1.09, 1.81] 
between the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo full dose group and the placebo in the proportion of 
patients with at least one histologically proven Adenoma or Carcinoma was statistically significant

(using Fisher’s Exact test) (pvalue=0.0099), indicating a significantly higher detection rate by the 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo full dose when compared with the placebo group. The odds ratio 
(odds ratio [95% CI] of 1.16 [0.85; 1.58]) for the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo low dose group 
compared to the placebo group in the proportion of patients achieving the primary endpoint was close 
to 1 and not statistically significant (p-value=0.3851). Similarly, the odds ratio [95% CI] of 1.22 [0.89, 
1.66] for the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo full dose group compared to the Methylthioninium 
chloride Cosmo low dose group in the proportion of patients achieving the primary endpoint was not 
statistically significant (p-value=0.2353). It is important to consider that the Methylthioninium chloride 
Cosmo low dose was not powered to show any statistically significant difference from placebo or the 
full dose. Nevertheless, a numerical dose-related increase in ADR was observed in the sequence 
placebo - Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo low dose - Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo full dose. The 
analysis of the PP Set confirms the evidence resulting from the FAS analysis (Table 11-7): Similar to 
the ADR reported for FAS, a total of 605/1137 patients (53.21%) in the overall population for the PP 
Set had at least one histologically proven Adenoma or Carcinoma found during colonoscopy, with the 
highest ADR recorded in the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo full dose group (58.24% of patients) 
when compared to the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo low dose group (53.78% of patients) and the 
placebo group (47.92% of patients). In the PP Set the difference in ADR between the Methylthioninium 
chloride Cosmo full dose group and the placebo group was 10.32%, a higher value than the 8.48% 
difference in ADR recorded in the FAS. Results for the PP Set showed the odds ratio [95% CI] of 1.52 
[1.17, 1.97] for the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo full dose group compared to the placebo group in 
the proportion of patients achieving the primary endpoint was highly statistically significant (Fisher’s 
Exact test) (p-value=0.0018). 
In the PP Set, the difference in ADR between the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo low dose group and 
the placebo group, even though not powered for this comparison, was 5.86%, also a higher value than 
the 3.64% difference in ADR recorded in the FAS, supporting the indication of a dose related trend of 
the dye as already indicated from the analysis in the FAS.

Primary Efficacy Endpoint Sensitivity Analyses 
Multiple Imputation under MAR Assumption Analysis 
When the MAR assumption was used for imputing the missing values for the ITT Set, results by means 
of the logistic regression model continued to show that there was a statistically significantly higher 
detection rate of at least one histologically proven Adenoma or Carcinoma in the Methylthioninium 
chloride full dose group when compared to the placebo group (adjusted odds ratio [95% CI] of 1.46 
[1.09, 1.95]) (p-value=0.0114). All variables included in the regression model as fixed effects (i.e., 
treatment, centre, patients’ age and sex, reason for the colonoscopy and the number of excisions) 
were statistically significant variables in the proportion of patients with at least one histologically 
proven Adenoma or Carcinoma when comparing differences between the Methylthioninium chloride full 
dose group and the placebo group (p-values of 0.0111, <0.0001, 0.0120, <0.0001, 0.0066 and 
<0.0001, respectively). 
The results based on MI method were generally consistent with those for the primary analysis based on 
the FAS, with the exceptions of statistical significance of centre and reason for the colonoscopy, 
indicating that missing data had a minimal impact on the validity of the primary analysis.

Worst Case Analysis 
For the worst case, success is ascribed with ≤3 excisions for placebo and failure with >6 excisions for 
Methylene Blue. Nineteen (19) patients assigned to Methylene  Blue full dose and excluded from the 
FAS were analysed as having >6 excisions and no histologically proven Adenoma or Carcinoma; 18 
patients assigned to placebo and excluded from the FAS were analysed as having ≤3 excisions and at 
least one histologically proven Adenoma or Carcinoma; Patient 131-124, assigned to placebo and 
excluded from the FAS due to failure to take at least one dose of IMP, underwent colonoscopy and was 
analysed according to the actual findings (i.e. ≤3 excisions and at least one histologically proven 
Adenoma or Carcinoma). When the missing data were imputed by the worst case method for the ITT 
Set, results by means of the logistic regression model showed that any difference between the 
Methylene Blue full dose group and the placebo in the proportion of patients with at least one 
histologically proven Adenoma or Carcinoma (point estimate [95% CI] of 1.13 [0.86, 1.49]) was no 
longer statistically significant (p-value=0.3862). When used as fixed effects, patients’ age and sex, 
reason for the colonoscopy and the number of excisions were all statistically significant variables in the 
proportion of patients with at least one histologically proven Adenoma or Carcinoma when comparing 
differences between the Methylene Blue full dose group and the placebo group (p-values of 0.0134, 
<0.0001, 0.0244 and <0.0001, respectively). Results showed that neither the treatment nor the centre, 
were statistically significant variables in the proportion of patients with at least one histologically proven 
Adenoma or Carcinoma when comparing the Methylene Blue full dose group and the placebo group (p-
values of 0.3862 and 0.0941, respectively).

Post-hoc Analyses of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
In line with relevant ICH guidelines, the number of excisions was removed as a covariate in the logistic 
regression model among the primary analysis covariates. 
A post-hoc logistic regression analysis was conducted where the number of excisions was not included 
into the model as a covariate. The other pre-specified covariates as per SAP Version 1.0 (treatment, 
centre, age, sex, and reason for colonoscopy) were maintained in the analysis. The results are 
summarised in Table 4 and were even more favourable to Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 200 mg 
with respect to placebo, with an adjusted OR of 1.51 [1.15, 1.97] and p = 0.0027. Age, sex, and reason 
for colonoscopy were confirmed to be statistically significant variables, whereas the analysis centre is 
not significant.

endoscopy) in terms of the proportion of subjects with at least one histologically proven adenoma or 
carcinoma. 
Histologically proven adenoma is defined as Vienna Grade 3 to 4.2. 
Histologically proven carcinoma is defined as Vienna Grade 4.3 to 5b.

Post-hoc Analyses of the False Positive Rate (at excision level) 
Following a request by another Agency, an additional post-hoc analysis of FPR was performed at the 
excision level, to compare treatment with Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 200 mg versus placebo with 
regard to the number of excised lesions identified as false positives. 
Overall, there were 1356/2780 (48.8%) false positives (histology negative lesions) in the FAS, with 
slightly higher proportions reported in both the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 200 mg group 
(592/1189; 49.8%) and the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 100 mg group (283/571; 49.6%) 
compared to the placebo group (481/1020; 47.2%). 
The upper limit of the 95% CI for the difference in the FPRs between the Methylthioninium chloride 
Cosmo 200 mg group and the placebo group was 6.81%, less than the threshold of 15% for rejecting 
the null hypothesis that the difference is higher than 15%. The corresponding p-value for testing the 
null hypothesis was < 0.0001. Similar results were observed for the PP Population.

Post hoc analysis of FPR excluding SSA and TSA 
Following the request by the DKMA to perform the statistical analysis on the primary endpoint 
according to the initial definition of adenoma per protocol Version 1.2 (Amendment 1, dated 
16 September 2013), Cosmo also investigated the outcome of the main secondary endpoint of the 
trial, the FPR, using the initial definition of adenoma. The result of this exploratory post-hoc analysis

Data Source: Study CB-17-01/06 Post-hoc Analysis Table 14.2.3.1a 
Proportion of Patients with at least One Histologically Proven Adenoma 
Overall, 621/1205 patients (51.54%) in the FAS had at least one histologically proven Adenoma, with 
a higher percentage of patients (55.88%) in the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo full dose group when 
compared to the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo low dose group (51.45%) and the placebo group 
(47.18%). There was a higher detection rate of patients with at least one histologically proven 
Adenoma (odds ratio [95% CI] of 1.42 [1.10, 1.83]) in the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo full dose 
group than the placebo group and the difference was statistically significant (Fisher’s Exact test p-
value=0.0082). 
There were only small differences in the proportion of patients with at least one histologically proven 
Adenoma between the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo low dose group and the placebo group (odds 
ratio [95% CI] of 1.19 [0.87; 1.62]); also between the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo full dose 
group and the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo low dose group (odds ratio [95% CI] of 1.19 [0.88, 
1.63]), neither was statistically significant. 
Proportion of Patients with at least One Histologically Proven Carcinoma; 
Only a small proportion of patients in the FAS (17/1205 patients; 1.41%) had at least one 
histologically proven Carcinoma, whilst the majority (1188/1205 patients; 98.59%) did not have any 
carcinoma. The proportion of patients with at least one histologically proven Carcinoma fell between 
1% and 2% for the three treatment groups with no statistically significant differences recorded. 
Number of histologically proven Adenomas or a histologically proven TSA, or a histologically proven 
SSA and Carcinomas detected per patient; 
Overall, a mean number of 1.2 (SD=1.8) histologically proven Adenomas and Carcinomas were 
detected per patient in the FAS, individually ranging from 0 to 13. Mean values were similar for all 
three treatment groups: 1.2 (SD=1.8) for the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo full dose group; 1.2 
(SD=1.7) for the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo low dose group and 1.1 (SD=1.8) for the placebo 
group with differences not regarded statistically significant. 
Number of histologically proven hyperplastic polyps, fibroblastic polyps and mixed polyps detected per 
patient; 
A mean number of 0.6 (SD=1.2) hyperplastic, fibroblastic and mixed polyps were detected per patient 
for the overall population in the FAS (ranging from 0 to 9), with the highest number in the 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo full dose group with a mean of 0.7 (SD=1.3) (ranging from 0 to 9). 
The Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo low dose group had a mean of 0.6 (SD=1.2) (ranging from 0 to 
8) and the placebo group, 0.5 (SD=1.2) (ranging from 0 to 7). The difference in means (0.16 [95% 
CI: 0.01; 0.30]) between the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo full dose group and the placebo group 
was statistically significant (p-value=0.0326).

Ancillary analyses 
Comparison of Results in Subpopulations 
As part of the SCE analyses of data, subgroup analyses of the adenoma or carcinoma detection 
rate, FPR, ADR, and non-polypoid lesion detection rate were performed by age group (18 to  49 
years, 50 to 64 years, ≥ 65 years), sex (male, female), race (White, Black, Other), reason for 
colonoscopy (screening, surveillance within 2 years from previous colonoscopy, surveillance after 
more than 2 years from previous colonoscopy), and number of excisions (≤ 3; 4 to 6; > 6) for 
Studies CB-17-01/06 and CB-17-01/05. Although Study CB-17-01/05 was included in the SCE 
analyses, very limited conclusions could be drawn based on the low numbers of subjects treated in 
the preliminary efficacy study. Thus, data discussed herein are limited to Study CB-17-01/06. 
Forest plots are presented for Study CB-17-01/06 for overall FAS and by subgroups for the efficacy 
for the primary endpoint. Similar figures (not shown) were completed for the secondary endpoints.  All 
statistical models used for subgroups had the same factors as in the primary efficacy endpoint 
analysis, except for the factor relating to the subgroup being presented (i.e., that term was not 
included in the model). The other difference is that the primary analysis included Methylthioninium

Analysis of Clinical Information Relevant to Dosing recommendation 
A Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 100 mg group was included in the pivotal Study CB-17-01/06 
for masking purposes, in order to reduce the potential acquisition bias due to the possible lack of 
investigator (endoscopist) and subject blinding between placebo and Methylthioninium chloride 
Cosmo 200 mg groups after dosing. Fewer subjects were enrolled in that dose group, and the 
study was not powered to show statistically significant differences between the Methylthioninium 
chloride Cosmo 100 mg group  and placebo, or between the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 100 
mg group and the 200 mg group. However, overall, 241 subjects were randomised to the 100 mg 
group in the FAS and this allowed a comparison of efficacy among the doses.

Summary of efficacy for trial CB-17-01/06 
Title:  
The safety and efficacy of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo prolonged release tablets administered to 
patients undergoing screening or surveillance colonoscopy  
Study identifier 
Sponsor code: CB-17-01/06 
EudraCT Number:2012-003983-32 
ClinicalTrials.gov identifier (NCT number): NCT01694966 
Design 
The study was a multi-centre, multinational, placebo controlled, randomised, 
double-blind at randomisation, parallel-group Phase III study of 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo (multimatrix structure) ‘MMX®’ prolonged 
release tablets compared to placebo in the treatment of patients undergoing 
full colonoscopy for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening or surveillance.  
Patients were randomised to the treatment group 200 mg of Methylthioninium 
chloride Cosmo tablets (Group One) or placebo tablets (Group Two) or the 
reduced dose group 100 mg of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo tablets (Group 
Three) in a ratio of 2:2:1. The reduced dose group was included only for 
masking purposes in order to reduce the acquisition bias due to the lack of 
investigator and patient blinding between placebo and Methylthioninium 
chloride MMX 200 mg groups. 
Duration of main phase: 
First patient enrolled: 15 December 2013 
Last patient enrolled: 20 October 2016 
Hypothesis 
Superiority of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo (200mg arm) compared to 
placebo (High Definition White Light endoscopy) in terms of proportion of 
patients with at least one histologically proven Adenoma or Carcinoma detected. 
Low dose (100 mg) arm was included for confounding purposes to reduce 
potential acquisition bias only.

Primary Analysis 
Full Analysis Set (FAS): All randomised subjects who received at least one dose of 
the IMP and underwent colonoscopy (regardless of the completion status). This 
analysis set was used for the primary efficacy analysis.  
Reasons for exclusion from the FAS were:  
- Failure to have taken at least one dose of the IMP;  
- Lack of any data post randomisation (i.e. colonoscopy not performed).  
The primary analysis was performed on the subjects included in the FAS.

Clinical studies in special populations 
Only patients age 50-75 were included in the pivotal study (i.e. patients eligible for entering a 
colonoscopy screening programme). A limited number of patients between 75 and 80 years were 
included in the supportive studies. All patients with ALT, AST, GGT, Bilirubin, Creatinine or Urea 
greater than 2.5 x the upper limit for normal range were excluded from the pivotal study, thus patients 
with more severe hepatic and/or renal impairment were not studied.

procedure prior to endoscopy. Subsequent colonoscopy was performed as usual removing all identified 
polyps.  
Study CB-17-01/04: Intraepithelial neoplasia detection rate after single oral dose of Methylthioninium 
chloride Cosmo prolonged release tablets administered to patients with long standing ulcerative colitis 
undergoing colonoscopy 
This was an open label, efficacy, exploratory, descriptive study. Patients with long standing ulcerative 
colitis who, as per guideline recommendations underwent screening colonoscopy for CRC, were treated 
with Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo during the cleansing procedure prior to endoscopy. During 
subsequent colonoscopy, as per guideline, 2 biopsies were taken randomly from each segment of the 
colon (ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon and rectum/sigmoid) as well as from any 
identified lesion. 
Due to the design (open label, uncontrolled) and the study population (for study CB-17-01/04) the 
results of these studies are of very limited support for the proposed indication, and not presented. 
2.7.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Demonstration of clinical efficacy and safety of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo in the proposed 
indication is based on a single pivotal study (study CB 17 01/06). As stated during previous scientific 
advice given by the CHMP, this could be acceptable provided that the study is well conducted and 
provides statistically and clinically significant and robust results.  
The objective of study CB 17 01/06 was to investigate if Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo, compared 
to placebo, increases ADR (adenoma detection rate) which is a generally accepted measure of the 
quality of the screenings and surveillance colonoscopies. This objective is considered relevant and 
adequately reflected in the primary endpoint and the primary efficacy analysis. 
Study CB 17 01/06 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled study comparing 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo to placebo in terms of ADR in subjects scheduled for screening or 
surveillance colonoscopy. Overall this design is considered acceptable.  
The inclusion and exclusion criteria selected a population with very little concomitant disease whose 
main medical problem was age-defined screening for colorectal cancer or surveillance for previously 
identified colorectal polyps. Considering the proposed indication, this is acceptable. 
Patients were randomised to receive either test drug (Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo), 200 mg or 
100 mg or matching placebo. Treatment was given as add-on to the usual standard PEG based 
cleansing procedure prior to colonoscopy. Both study medication (Methylthioninium chloride COsmo or 
placebo) and background treatment is adequately described. The efficacy of the drug was investigated 
in combination with 4 L PEG based bowel preparation procedure. Use of Methylthioninium chloride 
Cosmo is restricted to this volume and type of bowel preparation. 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with at least one histologically proven Adenoma or 
Carcinoma. Adenoma was defined as a histologically proven Vienna Grade 3 to 4.2 or a histologically 
proven Traditional Serrated Adenoma (TSA), or a histologically proven Sessile Serrated Adenoma 
(SSA). Histologically proven Carcinoma was defined as Vienna Grade 4.3 to 5b. It is generally accepted 
that adenoma detection rate is a surrogate for the risk reduction (for colorectal cancer) which can be 
achieved by colonoscopy. The higher the ADR (and subsequent removal of identified adenomas), the 
Assessment report

higher the reduction in colorectal cancer risk. In that respect, ADR is considered an appropriate 
primary endpoint. However, while the inclusion of adenomas and cancers follow the generally accepted 
definition of ADR, the inclusion of sessile serrated adenomas (SSA) and traditional serrated adenomas 
(TSA) is at least debatable. It is fully acknowledged that both these types of lesions are associated 
with increased risk of cancer. However, the data on the effect of removal of such lesions on the 
subsequent colorectal cancer risk is less robust than for the classical adenomas. Thus, the proposed 
primary endpoint (including SSA and TSA as well as classic adenomas) was considered acceptable and 
backed up by secondary endpoints investigating the effect on ADR using the previously applied 
definition of ADR, i.e. only including classic adenomas and excluding TSA and SSA. The change in 
primary endpoint is considered scientifically justified and is not considered to invalidate the internal 
validity of the study as the change of the primary endpoint occurred prior to unblinding, thus 
precluding that the decision to change endpoints could have been data driven. Furthermore, as 
endoscopist from the very start of the study (i.e. before the change in endpoint) were required to 
remove all lesions detected, the potential effect of the change of endpoint on endoscopists’ selection of 
lesions to be removed can be considered negligible. In addition, the applicant has stated that a Central 
Endoscopy review provided an independent confirmation that each colonoscopy was complete (caecum 
reached), that biopsies and excisions had been appropriately performed, that all the lesions had been 
detected and appropriately managed and whether or not the sampled area was a stained region. This 
lends additional support to the conclusion that the above-mentioned change of primary endpoint did 
not induce bias in terms of changes in selection of lesions to be removed. 
As regards bias introduced in subsequent handling and reading of biopsies, the applicant has explained 
that the study Histology Charter for the classification of the biopsied or resected lesions did not change 
as a consequence of the revision in the definition of adenoma during the study. From study start, the 
central histologists were required to classify the lesions according to the Vienna classification or to the 
serrated lesions classification (including SSAs and TSAs). Pathologist were blinded to the treatment 
received and during the blinded processing of biopsies/lesions prior to histological evaluation residual 
methylthioninium chloride staining was removed/covered by the sample preparation and staining. 
Thus, pathologists were blinded to treatment and consequently any bias as a result of the change of 
primary endpoint is unlikely. In conclusion, the change in primary endpoint is not considered to have a 
detrimental effect on the internal validity of the study.  
The sample size calculations were based on results of previous studies. The Applicant considered that a 
10 % increase in detection of lesions to be clinically significant. The sample size calculations are 
endorsed. Patients were randomization according to an adequately described and conducted strategy. 
Due to the colour of the product, it is not feasible to assure a complete blinding of the colonoscopists. 
Thus, the Applicant included a third arm in the study, where patients received a low dose of 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo to mitigate this effect. The rest of the staff involved was blinded to 
the treatment assignment. The blinding strategy is endorsed. However, it is noted that in essence 
neither endoscopist nor patient could remain blinded. 
In general, the statistical analysis plan is endorsed. The use of the FAS (full analysis set) for the 
primary analysis is agreed.  
The primary endpoint is related to difference in proportion of subjects with at least one histologically 
proven Adenoma or Carcinoma found during colonoscopy between methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 
and placebo. The use of logistic regression to calculate the odds ratio is endorsed. The inclusion of the 
stratification variables used at randomization (centre and reason for colonoscopy) in the logistic model 
is agreed. The use of age and sex in the logistic model are not agreed. The main reason to include a 
covariate in the analysis of a trial is the existence of strong or moderate association between the 
covariate and the primary outcome measure. According to the Guideline on adjustment for baseline 
Assessment report

covariates (EMA/295050/2013), known or expected associations with the primary outcome variable 
should be justified on the basis of previous evidence (possibly data from previous or other current 
trials) and/or on clinical grounds. When there is a lack of such established prior knowledge, it is safer 
to use a simple model with no, or only a few, covariates. The applicant also included a post-baseline 
variable “number of excisions”. This is not endorsed since this variable is affected by treatment. 
However, the applicant has performed additional analyses for the primary endpoint where only the 
stratification variables (centre and reason for colonoscopy) and treatment were included in the model 
and these support the primary analysis.  
The applicant was also requested to perform additional analysis for the primary endpoint using the 
Fisher Exact test and FAS according to the original randomization list, regardless of the treatment 
actually received by the patients and excluding TSAs and SSAs from the primary endpoint 
The sensitivity analysis planned for the primary endpoint are agreed. The calculations for the 
secondary endpoints are endorsed. 
A number of protocol violations have been noted. However, neither the number nor the nature of these 
violations raises any concerns about the conduct of the study. As previously mentioned, the primary 
efficacy endpoint was changed to include (in addition to “classical” adenomas) TSA and SSA. The 
rationale for this change is supported as TSA and SSA do have potential to develop into cancer.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Included patients were representative of the proposed indication. The three study groups were well 
balanced in term of demographics, previous medical history and previous and concomitant medication. 
Treatment compliance was high and similar across the three treatment groups. 
The applicant defined three analyses sets: the safety set, the full analysis set (FAS) and the Per 
Protocol Set (PP). Subjects randomized to a wrong stratum or receiving the wrong treatment were 
analysed by the applicant according to the treatment they actually received and to their actual reason 
for colonoscopy (regardless of the stratum they were assigned to) in the FAS and PP (per protocol) 
analyses. This is methodologically not appropriate. However, the applicant provided sensitivity 
analyses demonstrating that using the (correct) assigned stratum/population for these patients did not 
affect results significantly. The definitions of the safety and per protocol sets are considered 
acceptable. 
The study met its primary objective. Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 200 mg given in conjunction 
with standard bowel preparation prior to colonoscopy, increased the ADR significantly (in both FAS and 
PP set). The significance was evident for both Fischer exact test and logistic regression. The difference 
in ADR between Methylthioninium chloride COSMCosmoO and placebo was 8.48 (95 % CI (2.20 -
14.77)) percentage points.  
As noted, the study was not powered to detect differences in ADR between the low dose 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo (100 mg) group and the high dose Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 
group (200 mg) or placebo. The low dose group had numerically lower ADR than the high dose group 
but numerically higher than placebo. 
The statistical robustness was investigated in a series of sensitivity analyses that to some extent 
supported the robustness of the results. The multiple imputation under MAR (missing at random) 
assumption did support the primary efficacy. The worst-case analysis did not. Subgroup analyses 
demonstrated that the effect on ADR (both original definition excluding SSA/TSA and updated 
definition including SSA/TSA) was maintained across relevant subgroups (age, sex, reason for 
colonoscopy (screening or surveillance)) although number of patients of non-Caucasian ethnicity was

too limited to allow meaningful analysis.  Following post-hoc analysis of the data, the effect of 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo on ADR was calculated to be statistically significant in non-US (EU 
and Canada) subgroup only. When considering the regional difference, it was considered that within US 
centres, non-polypoid lesion constituted approximately 25% of the lesions whereas the corresponding 
figure for the EU/Canada centres was approximately 50%. Given that the effect of Methylthioninium 
chloride Cosmo is mainly on the non-polypoid lesions (see below), this difference in fraction of non-
polypoid lesions could explain the apparent lower effect size in the US stratum (difference in proportion 
between active and placebo 8.01 %  US vs 11.13 % EU/Canada). Several causes were postulated 
which could have contributed to the observed difference in non-polypoid lesion between the US and 
RoW study subpopulations. While the cause of the difference could not be determined, differences in 
clinical practice and training in the detection of these lesions, as well as, limited inter-rater agreement 
may have influenced the results. Using the original definition of the primary endpoint (i.e. excluding 
TSA and SSA and only including classical adenomas and carcinomas) the results just barely reached 
significance (p=0.0496).  
As regards the clinical relevance of the observed effect, it is well-known that the impact of colonoscopy 
screening in terms of reduction in risk of CRC is critically dependent on a sufficiently high ADR and 
there appears to be a correlation between the magnitude of the ADR and the reduction of risk for 
colorectal cancer. Thus, while any effect on ADR in principle is beneficial, the exact size of the effect on 
the clinically relevant endpoint, i.e. risk of CRC, is difficult to ascertain accurately as the risk of cancer 
differs according to size, location and histological characteristics of the removed adenomas. As 
expected, the effect of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo was primarily driven by increased detection of 
adenomas. The effect was statistically significant for adenomas but not for cancers.  It is fully 
acknowledged that the number of cancers was very low and consequently the power correspondingly 
low. Thus, it is considered acceptable and expected that Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo did not 
increase the number of cancers detected.  
The exploratory endpoint differentiating effect on polypoid versus non-polypoid lesions clearly 
demonstrates that the benefits of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo is limited to the non-polypoid 
lesions. This is to be expected as polypoid lesions generally are easier detectable than flat lesions. 
Although small lesions generally have lower risk of transformation to malignancy, the risk is not zero 
as they may, albeit rarely, harbour frank malignancy in spite of the size. Furthermore, by nature, 
smaller polyps are more often missed and these missed lesions account for a substantial part of the 
interval cancers observed. This supports the clinical benefit of finding and removing even small 
adenomas/cancers. 
The effect of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo on ADR was in part due to an increase in smaller and 
flat, non-polypoid lesions. However, the applicant has provided analyses excluding small TSA and SSA 
less than 5 mm, demonstrating that the effect of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo on ADR remained 
statistically significant even after exclusion of small (less than 5 mm) TSA/SSA. Although the 
differences between Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo and placebo in terms of ADR were numerically 
slightly smaller than for comparisons including all polyps (irrespectively of size), the analyses indicate 
that the beneficial effect of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo in terms of increase in ADR is not solely 
dependent on increase in detection of small SSA/TSA (with a presumably lesser risk of subsequent 
development of cancer) thus supporting the clinical relevance of the observed increase in ADR. 
Whereas an increase in the number of patients in whom an adenoma is detected (ADR) is of interest 
and a generally accepted measure of the quality of an endoscopist/an endoscopy screening program 
(and thus the reduction in risk of CRC), the individual patient it is also interested in achieving a truly 
“clean colon” (i.e. no relevant polyps left). As the truth (when is the colon clean) remains unknown, it 
is reasonable to assume that number of polyps removed per patient is a surrogate for achieving a truly 
clean colon. Number of histology confirmed adenomas and carcinomas per patient did not differ

Page 90/119 
 
 
 
 
between Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo treated patients and placebo. This is somewhat unexpected, 
as a treatment that increases the detection of polyps on a population level would also be expected to 
increase the detection on an individual level. The applicant argues that this is expected and 
consequently does not question the clinical relevance of the observed effect on ADR. Chromoendoscopy 
most likely does not increase the detection of polypoid lesion, only (otherwise hard to detect) flat, non-
polypoid lesions. Thus, an effect on number of polyps removed per patient would only be evident for 
the non-polypoid lesion, not for the polypoid lesions. As the polypoid lesions make up 50-75% of all 
lesions, the effect on the non-polypoid lesions may “drown” in the lack of effect on the detection of the 
large number of polypoid lesions. This interpretation is supported by analyses indicating that, 
compared to placebo, the number of non-polypoid lesions is indeed increased by Methylthioninium 
chloride Cosmo (acknowledging that no formal correction for multiplicity was performed, please see 
above). Whereas, increased detection and removal of lesions associated with risk of CRC indisputably 
is considered beneficial, increased detection and removal of lesions that are not associated with any 
risk of CRC is not beneficial and could potentially be harmful. Thus, the number of patients with false 
positive excision (i.e. excisions made assuming that the lesion was an adenoma but where subsequent 
histological evaluation could not confirm that the removed lesion was indeed an adenoma/TSA/SSA) 
compared to total number of patients with excisions (FPR), is an important secondary endpoint. Any 
intervention aiming at increasing detection of lesions in need of excision should not cause a 
disproportionate increase in false positive excisions as every excision is associated with a risk (albeit 
very small for the smallest lesions). The data presented shows that Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 
did not cause a clinically relevant increase in FPR at the subject level. In fact, compared to placebo, the 
FPR in the high dose, Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo was statistically significantly lower although the 
difference was not clinically relevant. While this to some extent is reassuring, it is of more interest to 
evaluate the FPR at the excision level. At the excision level, the FPR was numerically greater in the 200 
mg Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo group. However, the upper boundary of the confidence interval 
around the difference was below the predefined limit for non-inferiority and not considered clinically 
significant.  
Excluding SSA and TSA, FPR at the subject level was numerically (but not statistically significantly) 
greater in the two Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo groups. However, the upper boundary of the 
confidence interval around the difference was well below the predefined limit for clinical significance. 
The FPR at excision level (excluding SSA/TSA) in the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo full dose group 
was similar to the placebo group (54.08% vs 51.27%; difference [95% CI]: 2.80 [-1.37, 6.98]). The 
difference is below 15 %. These post hoc analyses using the originally proposed definition of adenomas 
(i.e. excluding SSA and TSA) confirms the results of the analysis presented using the later definition of 
adenomas (i.e. including SSA and TSA). Thus, Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo does not increase the 
FPR, neither at subject nor at excision level, in a clinical meaningful way. Thus, there is no indication 
that Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo increase the detection and removal of mucosa that does not 
represent a lesion that should be removed (FPR). 
Number of histology confirmed Hyperplastic, Fibroblastic and Mixed Polyps was slightly but statistically 
significantly higher in the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 200 mg treated patients compared to the 
placebo treated patients. As these lesions generally are considered without malignant potential, the 
increased detection and removal cannot be considered of benefit but actually potentially harmful to the 
patient and unwelcomed for the colonoscopists as it unnecessarily prolongs the procedure. However, 
considering the safety and ease of removal of these lesions as well as the lack of clinically relevant 
effect on overall FPR, the increased detection and removal of the before mentioned, non-neoplastic 
lesions is not considered to pose a clinically relevant risk to the patient.

A dose response relationship was evident for the data presented. Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 200 
mg was numerically superior to Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 100 mg. The 100 mg dose was 
included for masking purposes, as the blue colouring of mucosa/faeces/urine makes it impossible to 
maintain blinding. The inferior results of the lower dose do suggest a drug effect, not merely an 
increased awareness of the endoscopist because of the unblinding as a result of any blue colouring. 
Efficacy has not been studied in elderly patients and patients with severe hepatic and/or renal 
impairment. While, efficacy is in these populations is expected to be similar to the efficacy in the target 
population (i.e. otherwise healthy subjects between 50 and 75 eligible for entering colposcopy based 
colorectal cancer screening program), the lack of data has been noted in the SPC. As regards the 
safety in these populations, please refer to subsequent section. 
In addition to the above mentioned pivotal, randomised, placebo-controlled phase three study (Study 
CB-17-01/06) the applicant has submitted two uncontrolled studies in otherwise healthy subjects 
(Study CB-17-01/05) and patients with long standing ulcerative colitis (Study CB-17-01/04) who 
underwent screening/surveillance and surveillance, respectively. Due to the nature of these studies 
(un-blinded and uncontrolled) the results of these studies are difficult to interpret. 
2.7.4.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
Overall, the study met its primary endpoint, i.e. the ADR was significantly higher in Methylthioninium 
chloride Cosmo treated patients as compared to placebo treated patients. The primary endpoint was 
changed during the study to include SSA and TSA but as the change was well justified from a scientific 
point of view and as there are no indications that this change has had a negative effect on the internal 
validity of the study, this is considered acceptable. Overall the results are considered statistically 
robust and compelling. No impact on the robustness of the efficacy results is anticipated and the issue 
is not pursued further. Compared to placebo, Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo caused an increase in 
ADR of 8.48 (95 % CI (2.20 -14.77) percentage points. Previous studies indicate inverse relationship 
between ADR and risk of CRC supporting the clinical relevance of the observed effect. However, the 
before mentioned relationship is not linear and influenced by size, location and histology of the 
removed adenomas, precluding an accurate translation of the observed effect on ADR in terms of 
improvement of reduction of CRC risk. The data presented is considered to support the conclusion that 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo can improve ADR in screening/surveillance colonoscopy. 
2.7.5.  Clinical safety 
The clinical development program includes seven studies in humans. All seven studies contribute safety 
data. They are tabulated below:

Adverse events of special interest 
Some studies have suggested that methylthioninium chloride can induce DNA damage when exposed 
to white light in CRC cell lines and in vivo (Barrett’s oesophagus and ulcerative colitis biopsy samples) 
(Davies Gut 2007, Olliver Biomarkers 2003), although safety data in patients with ulcerative colitis and 
gastric intestinal metaplasia suggest that these observations regarding DNA damage are unlikely to 
have biological consequences (Kiesslich Gastrointestinal Endoscopy 2004, Dinis-Ribeiro Gastrointest 
Endosc 2008). 
The primary endpoint in Study CB-17-01/08 was evaluation, by γH2AX analysis, of the effect of a total 
oral dose of 200 mg of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo tablets on colonic epithelial double stranded 
DNA in colonic biopsy samples collected during chromoendoscopy as compared to control biopsies 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/424242/2020  
Page 101/119 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
collected during standard white light colonoscopy without Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo in the same 
subject. Effect on double stranded DNA was evaluated by counting the cells that stained positive for 
the DNA damage marker, γH2AX, and based on the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of staining for 
γH2AX. The threshold for both variables was set according to the negative and positive control staining 
of human HT29 cell line samples. The biopsy was considered negative if the average of MFI and of the 
percentage of gated cells was ≤ 1.5%, considered as an acceptable level of deviation, and positive if it 
was > 1.5%. 
Results of the γH2AX analysis are summarised in the table below. 
The γH2AX assay was negative for all the colonic regions for all the analysed subjects (N=10 – safety 
set) and at both colonoscopies. The occurrence of any DNA double strand damage could be excluded at 
each of the performed colonoscopies on the basis of the γH2AX analysis result performed in all colonic 
regions. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
No subjects died during the studies. 
Serious adverse events 
Serious TEAEs were reported in a total of 3 events subjects across the pooled analysis. The serious 
TEAEs were events of gastrointestinal haemorrhage and bronchitis viral in 1 (0.1%) subject each in the 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 200 mg treatment group and an event of haematochezia in 1 (0.4%) 
subject in the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 100 mg group. No serious TEAEs were reported in 
subjects who were treated with placebo. 
The serious adverse events are tabulated first for the pooled data. No SAEs or any other significant AE 
occurred during the non-pooled phase 1 study.

The pooled studies:  
Laboratory findings 
A panel of clinical laboratory assessments were conducted in Studies CB-17-01/01 and CB-17-01/02, 
including haematology, coagulation (Study CB-17-01/01 only), blood chemistry, and urinalysis 
parameters. In Studies CB-17-01/06 and CB-17-01/08, clinical laboratory assessments were limited to 
creatinine, urea, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT), and total bilirubin (all assessed in both studies) and haemoglobin 
(Study CB-17-01/08 only). No clinical laboratory assessments were conducted in Studies CB-17-01/03, 
CB-17-01/04, and CB-17-01/05. 
Results of liver and renal function laboratory tests are tabulated for the pooled analysis below:

Vital signs 
There were no clinically significant changes from baseline in systolic or diastolic blood pressure, heart 
rate, and oxygen saturation by treatment group. Median measurements, minimum change, and 
maximum change from baseline in systolic or diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen 
saturation were similar across treatment groups, including placebo. 
ECG evaluations were performed in Studies CB-17-01/01 and CB-17-01/02. No clinically relevant 
changes in ECG parameters or clinically significant ECG abnormalities were observed in either study. 
A thorough QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) study has not been performed with 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo, but such a study was performed previously with an IV formulation of 
methylthioninium chloride. ProvayBlue® is an injectable form of methylene blue and is currently 
approved in the US for the treatment of paediatric and adult patients with acquired 
methaemoglobinaemia. A randomised, open-label, single-dose, cross-over, thorough QTc study 
(Protocol PVP-2014002) was performed in 48 healthy volunteers who received 2 mg/kg IV ProvayBlue, 
moxifloxacin 400 mg orally, and placebo (sodium chloride) IV, with a 7-day wash-out period between 
each treatment. The sample size had 90% power to exclude a QTc effect > 10 msec if the true effect 
was up to 3 msec, based on the published effect size for placebo. In that study, no significant QTc 
prolongation effect was detected for a single 2 mg/kg IV dose of ProvayBlue.

Race 
Overall, in the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 200 mg treatment group in Study CB-17-01/06, 
TEAEs were reported in 287/435 (66.0%) White subjects, 17/38 (44.7%) Black subjects, and 10/15 
(66.7%) subjects with race categorised as “Other”. However, the small numbers of subjects in the 
Black (N = 38) and “Other” subgroups (N = 15) precludes meaningful comparisons between these 
subgroups. 
Renal Impairment 
It is estimated that approximately 40% of methylthioninium chloride is excreted by the 
kidneysProvepharm SAS 2016). In order to provide an assessment of the safety profile of 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo in subjects with renal impairment, TEAEs were summarised in a 
retrospective analysis for the pivotal Phase 3 study (CB-17-01/06) according to possible renal 
impairment. 
For the purposes of the current retrospective analysis, subjects were considered to have evidence of 
renal impairment if they had: 
• A high (> ULN) clinical laboratory result for creatinine at Screening; and/or 
• Reported medical history(ies) with PTs within the Standardised MedDRA Query (SMQ) 
of “Acute renal failure” (broad scope) that was ongoing at the start of treatment. 
Based on this definition, a total of 68 subjects were identified with some degree of renal impairment in 
Study CB-17-01/06, comprising 38 subjects in the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 200 mg group, 9 
subjects in the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 100 mg group, and 21 subjects in the placebo group.

Hepatic impairment 
Methylthioninium chloride is extensively metabolised in the liverProvepharm SAS 2016), and is an 
inhibitor and inducer, respectively, of various cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (inhibitor: CYP1A2, 
2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4/5; inducer: CYP1A2, CYP2B6). 
In order to provide an assessment of the safety profile of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo in subjects 
with hepatic impairment, TEAEs were summarised in a retrospective analysis for the pivotal Phase 3 
study (CB-17-01/06) according to possible hepatic impairment. 
For the purposes of the current retrospective analysis, subjects were considered to have evidence of 
hepatic impairment if they had: 
-  A high (> ULN) clinical laboratory result for ALT, bilirubin, and/or GGT at Screening; and/or 
-  Reported medical history(ies) with PTs within the SMQ of “Hepatic disorders” (narrow scope) 
that was ongoing at the start of treatment. 
Based on this definition, a total of 241 subjects were identified with some degree of hepatic 
impairment in Study CB-17-01/06, comprising 90 subjects in the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 
200 mg group, 44 subjects in the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 100 mg group, and 107 subjects in 
the placebo group. It is worth noting that of these 241 subjects, 40 had elevated bilirubin alone 
(i.e., without any reported ongoing medical history within the “Hepatic disorders” SMQ and without any 
elevation in ALT or GGT at Screening), including 13/90 (14.4%), 7/44 (15.9%), and 20/107 (18.7%) 
subjects in the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 200 mg, 100 mg, and placebo groups, respectively.

Glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency 
Methylthioninium chloride belongs to a group of drugs which have the potential to cause haemolysis in 
patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, although there is controversy 
regarding the clinical importance of this (Youngster Drug Saf 2010; Lu BMC Med 2018). There are case 
reports of methylthioninium chloride being associated with severe haemolytic reactions in neonatal 
G6PD deficiency (Gauthier J Matern Fetal Med 2000). 
Subjects with G6PD deficiency were excluded from participation in Studies CB-17-01/01, CB-17-01/02, 
CB-17-01/06, and CB-17-01/08, and while this was not an exclusion criterion in Studies CB-17-01/03, 
CB-17-01/04, and CB-17-01/05, no subjects enrolled in those studies had a known medical history of 
G6PD deficiency (Listing 16.2.10.3 [CB-17-01/03 CSR]; Listing 16.2.10.1 [CB-17-01/04 CSR]; 
Listing 16.2.10.1 [CB-17-01/05 CSR]). Thus, the effect of single-dose oral methylthioninium chloride in 
adult patients with G6PD deficiency is unknown, but caution is warranted. 
Based on experience of the use of methylthioninium chloride in the treatment of malaria and IV use 
(Lu BMC Med 2018), Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo is contraindicated in patients with known G6PD 
deficiency. 
Pregnancy and lactation 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo has not been tested in pregnant or lactating women. In the clinical 
development programme for Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo, there were 464 females who received 
any dose of the drug, of which 34 were aged 15 to 44 years. No pregnancies and no AEs related to 
pregnancy, lactation, or fertility occurred in any of the studies. Pregnancy tests at screening were 
required for women of childbearing potential and the results had to be negative for enrolment. Since 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo has not yet been approved or marketed in any country, potential use 
rates of this drug amongst females of reproductive age are not known.

Historically, epidemiological studies have shown an increased risk of neonatal intestinal atresia and 
foetal death after intra-amniotic injection of a methylthioninium chloride class product during the 
second trimester (Cragan Teratology 1999). Intra-amniotic injection of a methylthioninium chloride 
class product hours to days prior to birth has been reported to cause hyperbilirubinemia, haemolytic 
anaemia, skin staining, methaemoglobinaemia, respiratory distress, and photosensitivity in newborns 
(Cragan Teratology 1999). 
Studies with methylthioninium chloride in animals and in vitro have shown reproductive toxicity. Based 
on this animal experience, it has been concluded that methylthioninium chloride may cause foetal 
harm when administered to a pregnant woman and should therefore not be used during pregnancy 
(Coddington Fertil Steril 1989; National Toxicology Program 1993; National Toxicology Program 1994; 
Cragan Teratology 1999).  
There is no information regarding the presence of methylthioninium chloride in human milk, the effects 
on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Studies in animals suggests 
methylthioninium chloride will pass into breast milk. Nonetheless, it is recommended that 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo not be given to breastfeeding or lactating females (Ziv J Vet 
Pharmacol Ther 1984).  
Immunological events 
No immunological events occurred. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Serotonergic Drugs 
Serotonin syndrome has been reported with the use of methylthioninium chloride class products 
(Provepharm SAS 2016). Safety announcements released by the US FDA and the UK Medicines and 
Healthcare products Regulatory Agency have indicated that most cases of central nervous system 
(CNS) toxicity/serotonin syndrome occurred in the context of IV administration of methylthioninium 
chloride as a visualising agent in preparation for parathyroid or thyroid surgery (US FDA 2011; UK 
Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency 2009). Most reports of serotonin syndrome with 
IV methylthioninium chloride have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs, some 
tricyclic antidepressants and other psychiatric medications, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors 
(Provepharm SAS 2016). Not all serotonergic drugs have equal capacity to cause serotonin syndrome 
with IV methylthioninium chloride. The cases of serotonin syndrome with IV methylthioninium chloride 
occurred in patients taking specific serotonergic psychiatric drugs, namely a selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), or clomipramine (US 
FDA 2011). 
Serotonin syndrome may include the following signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., 
agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood 
pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, and hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, 
rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, and incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms 
(e.g., nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea) (Provepharm SAS 2016). 
There was no report of serotonin syndrome in the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo clinical 
programme, although a small number of subjects who received Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 200 
mg (8 × 25 mg tablets) were also receiving concomitant psychiatric serotonergic medications. It is not 
known if there is a risk of serotonin syndrome when methylthioninium chloride is administered orally in 
preparation for colonoscopy. However, maximal systemic exposure to methylthioninium chloride 
(maximum plasma concentration [Cmax]) was lower for orally administered Methylthioninium chloride 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/424242/2020  
Page 108/119 
 
 
 
 
Cosmo than for IV methylthioninium chloride, suggesting that there may be a lower risk of systemic 
CNS effects such as serotonin syndrome occurring with oral Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo than for 
IV methylthioninium chloride. Nonetheless, appropriate warnings regarding serotonin syndrome are 
included in the proposed labelling. 
Agents Metabolised by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes 
Methylthioninium chloride is an inhibitor and inducer, respectively, of various CYP enzymes (inhibitor: 
CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4/5; inducer: CYP1A2, CYP2B6) (Module 2.7.2). These 
interactions could be more pronounced with narrow therapeutic index drugs that are metabolised by 
one of these enzymes (e.g., digoxin, warfarin, phenytoin, alfentanil, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, 
ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, and tacrolimus). Across the clinical studies, a 
total of 11 subjects in the Safety Analysis Set were receiving 1 or more of these narrow therapeutic 
index drugs upon study entry, including 7 subjects receiving warfarin, 2 subjects receiving digoxin, and 
2 subjects receiving. Among these 11 subjects, there were no safety concerns raised, with TEAEs 
including chromaturia in 5 subjects, faeces discoloured and diverticulum in 3 subjects each, 
haemorrhoids in 2 subjects, and vomiting, alanine aminotransferase increased, 
gamma-glutamyltransferase increased, and aspartate aminotransferase increased in 1 subject each.  
Overall, there is limited clinical information regarding the concomitant use of Methylthioninium chloride 
Cosmo with drugs that are metabolised by CYP isoenzymes. 
Transporter Interactions 
Based on in vitro studies, methylthioninium chloride was found to be a substrate of the membrane 
transport proteins P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and organic anion transporter (OAT) 3 (Module 2.7.2); 
therefore, drugs which are inhibitors of these transporters have the potential to decrease the excretion 
efficiency of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo. Caution should be taken when Methylthioninium 
chloride Cosmo is co-administered with agents such as cyclosporine A, ritonavir, saquinavir, 
amiodarone, alectinib, probenecid and novobiocin. Across the clinical studies, a total of 2 subjects in 
the Safety Analysis Set were receiving 1 or more of these drugs upon study entry, both of whom were 
in Study CB-17-01/06.. No safety concerns were raised in these 2 subjects; one subject experienced a 
single TEAE of diverticulum intestinal. 
Overall, there is limited clinical information regarding the concomitant use of Methylthioninium chloride 
Cosmo with drugs that are inhibitors of P-gp and OAT3. 
Methylthioninium chloride was also found to potentially act as a mild inhibitor of P-gp. The clinical 
relevance of this in vitro interaction is unknown; however, there is the potential for co-administration 
to increase the plasma concentrations of drugs which are substrates of this transporter (digoxin, 
topotecan, sirolimus, everolimus, nilotinib and lapatinib). Across the clinical studies, a total of 
2 subjects were receiving 1 or more of these drugs upon study entry, both of whom were receiving 
digoxin. No safety concerns were raised in these 2 subjects; one subject experienced a single TEAE of 
chromaturia. 
Overall, there is limited clinical information regarding the concomitant use of Methylthioninium chloride 
Cosmo with drugs that are substrates of P-gp. Appropriate monitoring is recommended.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
TEAEs leading to study discontinuation were reported in a total of 7 (0.9%) subjects in the 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 200 mg treatment group (pooled analysis) and no subjects in any 
other Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo group. All TEAE PTs that led to study discontinuation were 
reported in individual subjects (1 [0.1%] subject each in the 200 mg group), with the events including 
gastrointestinal haemorrhage (SAE), haematemesis, vomiting, adhesion, adverse reaction (verbatim: 
‘adverse reaction during colonoscopy’), presyncope, and bradycardia. The events of gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage and adverse reaction were assessed as severe in intensity, while all other events were 
assessed as mild or moderate. One event, vomiting, was assessed as related to study treatment while 
all other events were assessed as not related. 
2.7.6.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.7.7.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Seven studies are included in the main safety analyses set, hereof one placebo-controlled phase 3 
study of 1208 patients. In total, 798 subjects have been exposed to the proposed dose of 200 mg 
(8x25 mg) and 244 subjects have been exposed to 100 mg (4x25 mg); the 100 mg group was 
included in the phase 3 study to assure blinding of the physician conducting the colonoscopy. Since 
some patients didn’t receive/take the full intended dose, a minority of subjects received a variety of 
doses between 25 mg to 175 mg. Additionally, 22 healthy volunteers have been exposed to 100 mg 
methylthioninium chloride i.v. as part of a phase I study. These studies together are considered to 
contribute sufficient data to assess the safety profile. An additional study on the possible long-term 
effects of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo has been investigated in a single study of 10 patients, in 
whom possible colonic epithelial DNA damage was investigated two weeks after exposure to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/424242/2020  
Page 110/119 
 
 
 
 
 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo. While the design of the study does not provide firm evidence of 
possible long-term risks, the likelihood of any long-term risks is considered very low due to the single 
dose exposure to Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo. Furthermore, it should be acknowledged that 
methylthionium chloride is approved for i.v. injection in the treatment of different other conditions.   
More males than females were included and more patients of 64 year or less than patients of 65 years 
or more were included. However, a sufficient number of elderly (≥ 65 years) have been included to 
evaluate the safety profile in this group. In the Phase 3 study, the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 
and placebo groups were balanced with regard to the age, gender and race of the patients. The 
demographics of the pooled studies including the phase 3 study is sufficiently representative of the 
populations expected to be undergoing colonoscopy. 
Discontinuations 
Seven subjects discontinued the studies; however, none of the reasons for discontinuations were 
recorded in more than one patient. Hence, there was not a pattern of adverse events leading to 
discontinuations. Furthermore, only one of the cases were assessed as related to the Methylthioninium 
chloride Cosmo, which was vomiting. There were no deaths during the studies. Three patients 
experienced serious adverse events; two patients in the 200 mg Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 
group and one patient in the 100 mg Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo group consisting of 
gastrointestinal haemorrhage, viral bronchitis, and haematochezia. However, the narratives clarified 
that these serious adverse events were not related to Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo. Overall, the 
rate of discontinuation due to AEs in subjects treated with Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo was 
acceptable. 
Analysis of adverse events 
Overall, AEs were reported as mild or moderate and 46.7% patients in Methylthioninium chloride 
Cosmo treatment group experienced at least 1 AE compared to 29.2% in the placebo group. 
The most commonly reported adverse events were chromaturia (48%) and discoloured faeces (20%), 
followed by nausea (6%), vomiting (5%), headache (3%), and abdominal pain (1%), percentages as 
reported in the phase 3 placebo-controlled trial. These common adverse events are adequately 
addressed in the SmPC and are also labelled for the already approved Methylthioninium chloride 
Proveblue (which, however, has additional common AEs as it is given as i.v. injection). The phase 1 
study, in which healthy volunteers received i.v. injections of methylthioninium chloride, did not indicate 
other common adverse events.  
Despite some evidence on carcinogenic activity of methylthioninium chloride has been shown in male 
mice and male rats, and female mice, it has been clarified that the proposed use of Methylthioninium 
chloride Cosmo cannot be expected to be carcinogenic in humans.  
PK assessment for Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo was conducted in healthy volunteers with an intact 
colonic mucosa. However, a thorough discussion indicate that colonic mucosa lesions are not expected 
to  affect  the  rate  and  extent  of  methylthioninium  chloride  systemic  absorption,  and  hence  do  not 
influence the overall safety profile. 
Serious adverse events 
The rate of SAEs was low. Overall, only 3 severe TEAEs were reported in the Methylthioninium chloride 
Cosmo group: 2 in 200 mg group and 1 in 100 mg group. No one TEAE was considered to be IMP 
related. Of note, one patient experienced haematemesis and melaena the day after colonoscopy, while 
another patient reported haematochezia. The narratives indicated that the SAEs were most likely 
related to underlying conditions and not to exposure to Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo. Furthermore, 
there was no indications of hypersensitivity reactions or anaphylaxis. Drug-drug interactions, which are 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/424242/2020  
Page 111/119 
 
 
 
 
well-described for i.v. methylthioninium chloride products are adequately addressed in the SmPC, even 
though the frequency and severity is expected to be modified by the relatively low serum 
concentrations obtained with Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo.  
Laboratory findings 
There were no clinically significant differences in the incidence of any renal or liver function laboratory 
test results across treatment groups. It has been clarified that an observed increase in ALT from 
baseline was higher in Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo group (5.4%) compared to placebo (3.4%), as 
well as increase of GGT from baseline was slightly higher in Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo group 
(1.6% versus 0.6 in placebo group) were most likely not related to the Methylthioninium chloride 
Cosmo exposure but rather to the patients’ underlying conditions. 
The phase I and II clinical studies did not reveal any abnormal laboratory findings that were considered 
related to Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo exposure. This is considered an adequate justification for 
the absence of e.g. haematology in the phase 3 controlled trial and the limited number of days, during 
which clinical laboratory assessments were conducted. 
It can be expected that methylthioninium chloride will be used more than once in patients undergoing 
more than one colonoscopy over years, however the use of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo on 
repeated occasions is not expected to lead to immunological reactions. 
Special populations 
Age 
The representativeness of the age groups is considered acceptable. It has been concluded that the 
pattern of AEs was generally similar across the age subgroups. Difference in the proportion of subjects 
of ≥ 2% between subgroups for the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 200 mg group (study CB-17-
01/06) were gastrointestinal disorders, reported in 42.5% of subjects aged 50 to 64 years and 33.5% 
of subjects aged ≥ 65 years. Overall, slightly lower incidence of AEs was reported in the age group ≥ 
65 years.  
Sex 
Enrolment of female subjects was lower compared to male subjects. A higher proportion of TEAEs was 
reported in females compared to males, though the pattern of events was generally similar regardless 
of sex. It is therefore proposed that neither warnings nor dose adjustments are required in respect of 
patient’s sex. 
Race 
The proportion of non-white subjects was extremely low. Therefore, any definite conclusions in relation 
to safety assessment by race/ethnicity cannot be driven based on the available data set. 
Renal impairment 
Although renal impairment was listed as an exclusion criterion, looking retrospectively, it has been 
found that some patients included in the study had some degree of renal impairment at the time of 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo administration.  
It has been concluded that these data do not imply to the higher frequency of any TEAEs in the 
subjects with renal impairment compared to those without. However, it was also concluded that based 
upon these limited data it is not possible to further extrapolate the safety profile of the product 
stratified by GFR. Nonetheless, the SmPC has been revised to reflect the lack of data in patients with 
moderate to severe renal impairment 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/424242/2020  
Page 112/119 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic impairment 
Other methylthioninium chloride medicinal products are restricted for use in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment.  During  the  studies  no  increased  risk  of  adverse  events  were  observed  in  patients  with 
hepatic  impairment.  Furthermore,  the  single  dose  exposure  is  not  expected  to  lead  to  a  significantly 
different safety profile in patients with hepatic impairment. However, the SmPC has been updated with 
information  of  higher  proportion  of  “faeces  discoloured”  in  the  hepatic  impairment  group  than  other 
patient groups. 
Patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency 
There are case reports of methylthioninium chloride being associated with severe haemolytic reactions 
in neonatal G6PD deficiency, therefore known G6PD deficiency is included as a contraindication. As the 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo will be used predominantly in middle aged or elderly patients, it is 
not considered necessary to require genotyping for G6PD deficiency before use of Methylthioninium 
chloride Cosmo; it is considered that patients with severe G6PD deficiency are aware of their condition 
at this time in life and/or that the systemic exposure to doses Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo will be 
too low to cause severe haemolytic reactions. 
2.7.8.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
In total, 798 subjects have been exposed to the proposed dose of 200 mg (8x25 mg), 244 subjects 
have been exposed to 100 mg (4x25 mg), while a minority of subjects received a variety of doses 
between 25 mg to 175 mg. Additionally, 22 healthy volunteers have been exposed to 100 mg 
methylthioninium chloride i.v. as part of a phase I study. Less than 1% experienced serious adverse 
events and/or discontinued the studies, no subjects died during the studies. 
The main safety issues consist of chromaturia (48%) and discoloured faeces (20%), followed by 
nausea (6%), vomiting (5%), headache (3%), and abdominal pain (1%). Drug-drug interactions were 
not observed in the studies but are labelled for concomitant treatment with seronergic medicinal 
products (serotonin syndrome) or with medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic index since 
methylthioninium chloride both inhibits and induces various CYP-enzymes (reflected in the PI).

3.  Benefit-risk balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo is indicated as a diagnostic agent enhancing visualisation of 
colorectal lesions in adult patients undergoing screening or surveillance colonoscopy.     
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Colonoscopy with identification and removal of suspected precancerous lesions is the standard 
screening method for CRC. The quality of the colonoscopy has been sought improved by improving 
bowel preparation methods (e.g. split dosing), improving education of endoscopists and technical 
improvements such as high definition white light imaging and NBI. Chromoendscopy, i.e. the direct 
application of dye (e.g. methylthioninium chloride or indigo carmine) is to improve characterization, 
differentiation and diagnosis of endoscopically detected suspicious lesions. However, this procedure is 
time consuming or not feasible in a high-volume screening programme. Currently it is only routinely 
used in patient groups with very high risk (e.g. long-standing ulcerative colitis). 
Evidenced by a high number of interval cancers (i.e. cancers being identified in between two 
screening/surveillance endoscopies), current methods are far from perfect and the need to improve the 
detection of relevant colonic lesions can be considered to constitute an unmet medical need. The need 
encompasses both the need to improve detection of lesions as well as the ability to differentiate 
between relevant (precancerous) and non-relevant (not associated with subsequent risk of CRC) 
lesions. While an intervention ideally should affect both factors, an intervention only improving overall 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/424242/2020  
Page 115/119 
 
 
 
 
detection can be considered beneficial provided that it does not do so primarily by increasing the 
detection of non-relevant lesions.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The confirmatory evidence of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo in the proposed indication is based on a 
single  pivotal  study.  Study  CB-17-01/06  was  a  phase  3,  multicentre,  randomised,  controlled  study  in 
patients  eligible  for  inclusion  in  a  general  screening/surveillance  programme  for  colorectal  cancer 
comparing  200  mg  and  100  mg  Methylthioninium  chloride  Cosmo  to  placebo  in  terms  of  adenoma 
detection rate which is considered a surrogate for the quality of the screenings/surveillance programme 
and a surrogate for the reduction of risk of colorectal cancer. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Compared to placebo (47.81 % of patients), Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 200 mg statistically 
significantly increased the fraction of patients in whom at least one adenoma (including SSA and TSA) 
or carcinoma was detected (56.29% of patients). In the 100 mg Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo 
group, the corresponding figure was 51.45%. The difference between placebo and 200 mg 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo was statistically significant (p=0.0099). As regards the original 
primary endpoint, i.e. fraction of patients in whom at least one adenoma (excluding TSA and SSA) or 
carcinoma was detected, the Odds Ratio between 200 mg Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo and 
placebo was 1.3088 [95% confidence interval 1.0005, 1.7120], P=0.0496. The effect was maintained 
across important predefined subgroups such as age, sex and reason for colonoscopy. The increase in 
detection rate was secondary to increased detection of adenomas whereas the rate of detection of 
cancers, as expected, was low and similar in both groups. Compared to placebo, Methylthioninium 
chloride Cosmo did not increase FPR (False positive rate= fraction of all polyps removed in which 
histological assessment did not confirm the diagnosis “adenoma (including TSA and SSA)” or 
“adenocarcinoma”), neither at subject level, nor at incision level. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Previous studies indicate inverse relationship between ADR and risk of CRC supporting the clinical 
relevance of the observed effect. However, the before mentioned relationship is not linear and 
influenced by size, location and histology of the removed adenomas, precluding an accurate translation 
of the observed effect on ADR in terms of improvement of reduction of CRC risk. Adding to the 
difficulty of translating the improvement in ADR into improved CRC risk reduction is the fact that the 
increased detection rate associated with Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo was mainly a result of an 
increased detection of small polyps with a lower potential for malignant transformation. Furthermore, 
whereas Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo (compared to placebo) increased the fraction of patients 
with at least one adenoma or carcinoma, there was no difference between placebo and 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo in terms of number of adenomas and carcinomas detected per 
patient. However, the number of non-polypoid lesions detected per patient was statistically 
significantly greater in the Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo group compared to placebo. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Chromaturia (48%) and discoloured faeces (20%) were the most commonly reported adverse events, 
followed by nausea (6%), vomiting (5%), headache (3%), and abdominal pain (1%), percentages as 
reported in the phase 3 placebo-controlled trial. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/424242/2020  
Page 116/119 
 
 
 
 
No deaths occurred and no serious adverse events appeared related to Methylthioninium chloride 
Cosmo. 
With regard to drug-drug interactions, it cannot be excluded that serotonin syndrome may occur if 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo is administered concomitantly with serotonergic medicinal products. 
Adverse events of other medicinal products, especially medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic 
index, may occur following Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo administration, since Methylthioninium 
chloride Cosmo is both an inducer and inhibitor, respectively, of various CYP enzymes (reflected in 
SmPC sections 4.5 and 4.5).  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The long-term risks related to the use of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo are unknown. There was not 
a minimum time of follow-up after administration of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo, the last safety 
evaluation took place at a not specified time between the second and the seventh day after 
colonoscopy. However, long-term adverse events are not labelled for i.v. methylthioninium chloride 
containing products.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
ADR is a generally accepted indicator of the quality, and hence the effect in terms of risk reduction, of a 
programme for screening for CRC. An increase in ADR is likely to result in improvement of the CRC risk 
reduction although the relationship is not linear. Thus, the exact size of the CRC risk reduction cannot 
be accurately determined based on this study. Although, the increase in ADR is considered robust, it is 
primarily the result of detection of smaller, flat lesions. On one hand these generally have a lower risk 
of transformation than larger lesions, but on the other hand small, flat and thus hard to detect lesions 
account  for  a  substantial  proportion  missed  polyps/interval  cancers  (cancers  occurring  between 
endoscopies). Thus, while it is acknowledged that observed increase in ADR will reduce risk of CRC, the 
exact effect size in terms of CRC risk reduction cannot precisely defined.  
The safety profile of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo is adequately characterised and comprise mainly 
mild or moderate transient symptoms. The safety profile of methylthioninium chloride given iv is well 
known  from  previously  approved  products  using  this  method  of  administration,  albeit  for  another 
indication, and do not indicate long-term risks. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The  benefits  of  Methylthioninium  chloride  Cosmo  in  terms  of  increase  in  ADR  has  been  convincingly 
demonstrated.  The  safety  profile  is  adequately  characterised  and  there  are  no  major  safety  issues 
associated  with  the  drug.  The  benefit  risk  balance  of  Methylthioninium  chloride  Cosmo  is  considered 
positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The indication reflects that Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo can enhance visualisation and detection of 
colorectal  lesions  without  any  specification  of  histology.  It  has  not  been  demonstrated  that 
Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo enhances visualisation of suspected (pre-) cancerous lesions. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo is positive. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
decision that the benefit-risk balance of Methylthioninium chloride Cosmo is favourable in the following

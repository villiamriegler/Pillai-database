1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Takeda Global Research and Development Centre (Europe) Limited submitted on 30 
May 2012 an application for Marketing Authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for 
Incresync, through the centralised procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 3 of Annex of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 . The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the 
EMA/CHMP on 20 October 2011. During the procedure the applicant has changed to Takeda 
Pharma A/S. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Incresync is indicated to improve glycaemic control in adult patients (≥ 18 years old) with type 2 
diabetes mellitus: 
  when diet and exercise plus pioglitazone alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
 
in combination with metformin when diet and exercise plus dual therapy with pioglitazone and 
metformin do not provide adequate glycaemic control.  
In addition, Incresync can be used to replace separate tablets of alogliptin and pioglitazone in 
those adult patients (≥ 18 years old) with type 2 diabetes mellitus already being treated with this 
combination. 
After initiation of therapy with Incresync, patients should be reviewed after 3 to 6 months to 
assess adequacy of response to treatment (e.g. reduction in HbA1c).  In patients who fail to show 
an adequate response, Incresync should be discontinued.  In light of potential risks with prolonged 
pioglitazone therapy, prescribers should confirm at subsequent routine reviews that the benefit of 
Incresync is maintained (see section 4.4). 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
New active substance (Article 8(3) of Directive No 2001/83/EC). The applicant indicated that 
alogliptin was considered to be a new active substance. 
The application submitted is a new fixed combination medicinal product composed of 
administrative information, complete quality data, a clinical bioequivalent study with the individual 
tablets, non-clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or 
bibliographic literature substituting/supporting certain tests or studies. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/60/2008 on the granting of a class waiver.

Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) 
No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for 
a condition related to the proposed indication. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance alogliptin contained in the above medicinal product 
to be considered as a new active substance in itself, as the applicant claims that it is not a 
constituent of a product previously authorised within the Union 
Scientific Advice 
The applicant received repeated Scientific Advice from the CHMP during 2009. The Scientific 
Advice pertained to non-clinical and clinical aspects of the dossier.  
Licensing status 
Incresync has been given a Marketing Authorisation in Japan on 1 July 2011, in the US on 25 
January 2013, and Mexico on 23 May 2013

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has increased dramatically throughout the 
world, and is expected to continue to rise from approximately 366 million adults in 2011 to 552 
million adults by 2030. T2DM is a chronic illness associated with a number of long-term 
microvascular (i.e. nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy) and macrovascular (i.e. 
cardiovascular [CV] disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease) complications.  
Current pharmacologic interventions for T2DM include a diverse range of antidiabetic medications 
with different mechanisms of action, developed to manage the 2 different aspects of the disease: 
reduced insulin secretion and peripheral insulin resistance. The main classes of oral agents include 
biguanides (e.g. MET), SUs (e.g. glipizide), TZDs (e.g. pioglitazone), and other DPP-4 inhibitors 
(e.g. sitagliptin). Insulin and glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs (e.g. exenatide and 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 9/136 
 
  
  
liraglutide) are also commercially available and are administered by injection. Many therapies have 
clinically important side effects, such as hypoglycaemia (SUs), weight gain, fluid retention and 
heart failure (TZDs), and gastrointestinal effects and lactic acidosis (MET). 
The application concerns a FDC of alogliptin and pioglitazone. The applicant proposed the following 
strengths: 25 mg/ 30 mg, 25 mg/ 45 mg, 12.5 mg/ 30 mg and 12.5 mg/ 45 mg. Alogliptin belongs 
to the class of DPP-4 inhibitors. Pioglitazone is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma 
(PPAR) agonist and member of the thiazolidinediones (TZD) class of oral antiglycaemic agents. 
Pioglitazone is currently approved for use in the treatment of T2DM in 107 countries (including the 
European Union, the US, and Japan). The initial EU Marketing Authorisation for pioglitazone was 
granted in October 2000 via the centralized procedure and a 10-year renewal was approved in 
August 2010. 
Alogliptin belongs to a relatively new class of agents, DPP-4 inhibitors, which has emerged as a 
novel treatment to help manage T2DM. In patients with T2DM, actions of the incretin hormones 
GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are blunted, which contributes to 
hyperglycaemia. GLP-1 and GIP are released into the bloodstream in response to meals/glucose 
levels, but are quickly inactivated by DPP-4. Inhibition of DPP-4 increases circulating blood levels of 
GLP-1 and GIP, thereby increasing insulin levels and decreasing glucagon levels. 
For this MAA, key guidance documents considered in the design of the clinical development program 
included the Note for Guidance on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Treatment of 
Diabetes Mellitus (CPMP/EWP/1080/00). The program is also largely consistent with the adopted 
revision 1 (CPMP/EWP/1080/00 Rev 1). Specifically relevant for this FDC is the Guideline on fixed 
combination medicinal products (CPMP/EWP/240/95). This guideline was in general followed. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is manufactured as immediate-release, round, biconvex, film-coated tablets 
for once daily oral administration containing alogliptin (as benzoate) and pioglitazone (as 
hydrochloride) as active substances. Four tablet strengths are proposed for commercial use 
containing 12.5mg+30mg, 12.5mg+45mg, 25mg+30mg, or 25mg+45mg of alogliptin and 
pioglitazone, respectively. All strengths of the drug product have the same dimensions (diameter: 
approximately 8.7 mm; thickness: approximately 5.0 mm) and weight. The 4 strengths are 
distinguished by film color, printing ink color, and dose-specific imprinted markings on one side of 
the tablet.  
The composition is further detailed in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The product is available in aluminum blister strips using push-through aluminum lidding as 
described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.

2.2.2.  Active Substance Pioglitazone 
The active substance pioglitazone (INN) is a white crystalline powder, odourless, slightly bitter, 
melting at 193 C, freely soluble in dimethylsulfoxide, soluble in dimethlyformamide and methanol, 
sparingly soluble in solvents such as acetonitrile, acetone, insoluble in diethyl ether and hexane, 
practically insoluble in water. Partition coefficients were provided.  Pioglitazone is non-hygroscopic. 
Pioglitazone has one asymmetric carbon but is manufactured as the racemate (optical rotation in 
dimethylformamide of 0.0°).Pioglitazone is crystalline but does not exhibit polymorphism. 
The active substance is packed in well-closed polyethylene bags placed in fibre drums. 
Specifications for the packaging components are provided. The materials are in compliance with EU 
regulation 10/2011 and Ph. Eur. 3.1.11 where applicable. 
Manufacture 
The five-step chemical synthesis of pioglitazone (as hydrochloride) involves two main steps 
synthesis of a key intermediate and the conversion to pioglitazone hydrochloride and its subsequent 
purification. The synthetic routes used at all the manufacturing sites are identical. The equipment 
and process controls used at each site are very similar. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control 
methods for intermediates, starting materials and reagents have been presented. The molecular 
structure of Pioglitazone hydrochloride has been confirmed by Elemental analysis UV, IR, MS, 
13C-NMR and 1H-NMR. Additional supportive data are provided by studies characterising the key 
intermediate in which the comparative IR absorption spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction data 
showed that the chemical and physical properties of the intermediates remain the same from all 
manufacturing sites. Equivalency was demonstrated including results for impurity profile and 
stability studies.  
Pioglitazone hydrochloride has one asymmetric carbon but is synthesised as a racemate.  
Information about related substances including potential genotoxic impurities, residual solvents 
and residual catalyst has been provided. Impurity level results show that most potential impurities 
are not detected or below the limit of quantitation and that the potential for carry-through of 
impurities and starting materials to the final drug substance is low. The impurity levels do not raise 
any safety concern. Comparative data demonstrate that the impurity profiles of intermediate and 
pioglitazone hydrochloride are similar for all manufacturing sites.

Specification 
The specification for pioglitazone hydrochloride (applicable to all manufacturing sites) includes test 
for: description (visual), identification (IR, UV, HPLC, chloride ion test Ph.Eur.), heavy metals 
(Japan. Ph.), related substances (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water (USP method), residue on 
ignition (USP), assay (HPLC) and particle size (laser diffraction). The analytical procedures have 
been described for each manufacturer of the final drug substance. Reference to compendial 
methods (USP, JP and Ph.Eur.) is made where relevant. The different manufacturers apply the same 
methods. Analytical methods have been described and non-compendial methods have been 
validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. 
The specification is based on batch analyses of the drug substance prepared by the commercial 
process, and batches used for clinical, toxicological and stability studies. The limits established for 
the impurities including related substances, heavy metals, and residual solvents are in line with the 
relevant ICH guideline. The related substances are toxicologically qualified and do not raise any 
safety concern. With regards to the particle size, specification was set due to the low aqueous 
solubility of pioglitazone. 
Stability 
Stability studies have been performed on 17 batches obtained from the different manufacturers (six 
pilot-scale batches and 11 production-scale batches) in well-closed polyethylene packs 
The parameters tested were description, identity, clarity & colour of solution, water content, assay, 
related substances and optical isomeric ratio. The methods were the same as for release testing; 
methods of parameters additional to release testing (e.g. optical isomer ratio) were described and 
validated. 
Studies were conducted under long- term (25°C/60% RH) for up to 48 months, and accelerated 
(40°C/75% RH) for up to 6 months stability testing ICH conditions. In addition, stress stability 
testing was conducted under various conditions (heat, humidity, acid and basic, oxidising, and 
photostability). Photostability studies were in line with ICH requirements. 
The analytical procedures were fully described, validated and stability indicating. All the stability 
batches were manufactured using the proposed route of synthesis. 
No significant change could be observed under any of the storage conditions (long-term and 
accelerated). Similarly there were no significant changes under the specified stress conditions. 
The stability data provided support the proposed the re-test period of 48 months when stored in the 
commercial storage container at a temperature not exceeding 30°C. 
2.2.3.  Active Substance Alogliptin 
The active substance alogliptin benzoate (INN: alogliptin) is a white crystalline odourless powder, 
soluble in i.e dimethylsulfoxide, sparingly soluble in methanol, slightly soluble in e.g. 
tetrahydrofuran, and practically insoluble in e.g. toluene and diethyl ether. The aqueous solubility is 
high and independent of the pH between 3 and 11. The chemical name is 
2-({6-[(3R)-3-aminopiperidin-1-yl]-3-methyl-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydropyrimidin-1(2H)-yl}methyl)-
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 12/136 
 
  
  
benzonitrile monobenzoate, also known as 
2-[[6-[(3R)-3-Amino-1-piperidinyl]-3,4-dihydro-3-methyl-2,4-dioxo-1(2H)-pyrimidinyl]methyl]be
nzonitrile monobenzoateand has the structural formula C25H27N5O4. It is a 1:1 salt between 
alogliptin and benzoic acid. 
The structure of alogliptin benzoate was unambiguously confirmed by NMR, UV, and IR 
spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, and an X-ray crystal structural study.  
Physico-chemical properties such as crystalline form, optical rotation and partition coefficients have 
been detailed. Although alogliptin exhibits polymorphism, a single stable polymorphic form is 
routinely delivered by the manufacturing process. The active substance is not hygroscopic. It has a 
single chiral centre and is manufactured as the R enantiomer.  
The chemical structure of alogliptin benzoate is: 
Manufacture 
Alogliptin is synthesized in three steps from three commercially available, well-defined starting 
materials. The active substance is then milled to attain the desired particle size. Detailed 
information about the manufacturing process, control of starting materials, reagents and solvents, 
control of critical steps and intermediates along with process development and validation has been 
provided. 
The manufacturing process is adequately described. The full 3-step process can be carried out in its 
entirety at one manufacturer. Alternatively, step 1 is carried out at a different manufacturer. The 
synthetic scheme, including the raw materials suppliers and process descriptions is identical for all 
manufacturing sites although the scales differ. The starting materials are well-defined, 
commercially available and purchased from vendors who have demonstrated the ability to supply 
materials that consistently meet the established acceptance criteria. Appropriate specifications 
have been adopted for the starting materials, taking into account their route of synthesis and 
impact on active substance quality. The applicant has discussed the formation and control of 
potential and actual impurities, including genotoxins, degradants, and residual solvents at each 
step of the synthesis. Critical process parameters were identified for each step and appropriate 
limits defined. All relevant impurities have been appropriately characterised and are well controlled 
by the process and intermediate specifications. Therefore, the manufacturer has good control over 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 13/136 
 
  
  
 
 
 
the manufacturing process and the described in-process controls and specifications are considered 
adequate to ensure the required quality of active substance. 
Alogliptin benzoate is packaged in double low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags closed by a plastic 
tie. The bags are then stored in a fiberboard drum for further protection. The information on the 
container closure system is considered acceptable and supports the stability of alogliptin benzoate. 
The plastic materials in direct contact with the substance are stated to be in compliance with the EU 
regulations.  
Specification 
The active substance specification includes the following parameters: appearance (visual and XRD), 
identification (UV, IR, HPLC), heavy metals (USP method), content of (S)-enantiomer (chiral HPLC), 
related substances (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water (Ph.Eur. 2.5.12), residue on ignition (Ph. 
Eur. 2.4.14), assay (HPLC) and particle size (laser diffraction). The specifications have been 
adequately justified and are in compliance with ICH guidelines including ICH Q3A(R2) and ICH Q3C 
for residual solvents. The potential effect of particle size on the dissolution properties of alogliptin 
tablets was investigated, and it was found to be negligible within the range evaluated. 
The analytical results of 46 batches of alogliptin (manufactured and used in development, 
preclinical, clinical, stability studies as well as used for the purpose of validation and registration) 
have been provided. Results were found within the set specification. Analytical methods have been 
described and non-compendial methods validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. 
Stability 
Three pilot-scale batches of the active substance stored in the commercial packaging were put on 
stability studies under long-term (25 °C / 60% RH) for up to 60 months and accelerated (40 °C / 
75% RH) for up to 6 months as per ICH guidelines. Additional stress studies (heat (50, 60 oC), 
humidity (93% RH) and photostability (white fluorescent and UV light) in line with ICH option 2) 
were performed on one batch for 3 months. The parameters tested in the stability studies were 
appearance, crystallinity, identification, (S)-enantiomer, related substances, 
(R)-3-aminopiperidine, water content, assay and microbiological limit testing. The analytical 
procedures were detailed and validated. No significant changes were observed to any of the 
monitored parameters under any of the tested conditions. Furthermore, stability of the polymorphic 
form was demonstrated. 
Forced degradation studies were also carried out and identified several degradation products 
formed under acidic, basic, and oxidative aqueous conditions. The drug substance was shown to be 
stable in neutral aqueous solution, even on exposure to light. 
The stability studies indicate that the drug substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container.

2.2.4.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
Alogliptin benzoate is identified as a single stable crystal form, which is manufactured for use in the 
finished product. Although particle size has been shown not to influence exposure to alogliptin, 
specifications are in place to control the particle size distribution of the active substance to ensure 
uniformity of content.  
Pioglitazone is always obtained as a racemic mixture.Given its low aqueous solubility particle size 
limits have been established for the commercial pioglitazone. These limits provide adequate 
manufacture and controls to ensure consistent physical and biological properties of the drug 
product. 
Key physicochemical characteristics of the active substances such as particle size distribution and 
stereochemistry are controlled through the respective specifications.  
The two active substances have been shown to be chemically incompatible in mixtures under 
stressed and accelerated stability conditions; therefore, separate granulations were prepared and 
compressed into bi-layer tablets to minimize physical interaction between the drug substances. 
All excipients are used in concentrations based on historical experience, and are conventional for 
their pharmaceutical function. The excipients are: mannitol, cellulose microcrystalline, 
hydroxypropylcellulose, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate, and lactose monohydrate. 
For the film-coating solution the excipients are: hypromellose , talc, titanium dioxide, iron oxide 
yellow, iron oxide red.  For the polishing solution, macrogol is used and for the printing ink solution 
printing red and gray inks are used. Both substances alogliptin and pioglitazone demonstrate good 
compatibility with all excipients used in their respective granulations and with the excipients used 
for film-coating. Each excipient was chosen based on its required function for the formulation and 
on successful demonstration of compatibility with the relevant active substance. The amounts of 
excipients were selected based on experiments performed to study excipient ranges and their 
effects on drug product performance and manufacturability. All excipients are compendial (Ph.Eur, 
Commission Directive 95/45/EC or the USP/NF) except the printing inks. These inks are prepared 
from components that meet compendial specifications on an individual basis or comply with 
relevant regulatory standards.  
During the formulation development, six dosage strengths were developed, containing 12.5 mg or 
25 mg of alogliptin and 15 mg, 30 mg, or 45 mg of pioglitazone, in an immediate-release, 
fixed-dose combination (FDC), oral tablet. Only four strengths have been applied for in this 
submission. The development resulted in evaluation of 2 distinct formulations, both based on the 
requirement to separate the alogliptin and pioglitazone.  
Formulation development proceeded in parallel with clinical development; co-administered 
individual alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets were used in the Phase III clinical program while the 
fixed dose combination product was being developed. As such, formulation development for the 
fixed dose combination product required demonstration of bioequivalence (BE) to the reference 
alogliptin and pioglitazone products.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013

The concentrations of the ingredients used in the film-coating were determined on the basis of 
historical knowledge gained by the applicant, and conventional pharmaceutical practice. The effect 
of film-coating on the dissolution of alogliptin was negligible, and was minimal for pioglitazone. 
There were no significant differences in the dissolution results observed between film-coated and 
uncoated tablets by the 10 minute sample time. 
The dissolution profiles of alogliptin and pioglitazone from the bi-layer (BL) tablets (12.5mg+15mg 
and 25mg+45mg, respectively) were similar to those of the corresponding individual tablets.  
Equivalency was confirmed on laboratory-scale, pilot-scale and commercial-scale. Subsequently, 
comparative dissolution studies were performed that established the similarity of all dosage 
strengths relative to the 25mg+45mg strength, based on difference and similarity factors f1 and f2, 
which justifies the biowaiver for the intermediate strengths of  BL tablets that were not tested in the 
in-vivo pivotal BE study. 
The process for the manufacturing of the finished product followed conventional pharmaceutical 
practices, and consists of individual granulation of the active substances, mixing, tabletting and 
film-coating. The manufacturing steps were studied during the pilot-scale manufacturing 
campaigns. All results indicated that the operating parameters and ranges selected for these 
batches will produce acceptable product. 
To ensure that manufacturing conditions used at the commercial scale are appropriate to produce 
BL tablets with properties equivalent to those achieved at the pilot scale, optimization studies were 
performed for the individual operations to develop the appropriate operating parameters for use 
with the larger commercial scale equipment. All equipment intended for commercial manufacturing 
was either the same or equivalent to that used during pilot scale manufacturing. All results from the 
commercial scale process optimization batches showed acceptable results for each manufacturing 
stage using the selected operating ranges.  
The primary packaging consists of nylon/ aluminium /PVC (NYL/alu/PVC) blister strips using 
push-through aluminum lidding as described in the SmPC. The materials comply with the Ph.Eur. 
requirements and is adequate to support the stability and the use of the tablets.  
Bulk packaging for the tablets included a primary heat-sealed polyethylene bag, a silica gel 
desiccant bag, a secondary heat-sealed, laminated aluminum bag, and a tertiary fiberboard or 
metal drum for storage and shipment to the commercial packaging facility. Stability in the bulk 
packaging has been established for 24 months. 
Adventitious agents 
The only component from animal origin is lactose monohydrate. It is certified that the magnesium 
stearate used will be of plant origin only. Furthermore, Takeda certifies that lactose monohydrate 
used is sourced from milk collected under the same conditions as that for human consumption and 
comply with the latest Note for Guidance on minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform 
Encephalopathy Agents via Human and veterinary medicinal products.

Manufacture of the product 
The manufacture of the finished product is a standard process and consists of individual granulation 
of the active substances, mixing, tabletting and film-coating.  
Consistency of the manufacturing process for the tablets is maintained by the combination of 
controls established for operating parameters and routine in-process tests of selected physical 
attributes of the process materials. Although no manufacturing steps are defined as critical, 
operating parameters of key processes are controlled, and testing of in-process materials is 
performed.  
Validation of the commercial manufacturing process was performed to confirm the reproducible 
quality of the manufacturing process. The process consists of conventional pharmaceutical unit 
operations; therefore, the general properties were evaluated on three full-scale production batches 
of each strength manufactured under fixed processing conditions. All results demonstrated that the 
manufacturing process consistently produces a product that meets its pre-determined 
specifications and quality attributes. 
Product specification 
The release and shelf-life specifications for the 12.5mg+30mg, 12.5mg+45mg, 25mg+30mg, and 
25mg+45mg of alogliptin and pioglitazone film-coated tablets include appropriate tests for: 
appearance (visual), identification (UV and HPLC), assay for each active substance (HPLC), content 
uniformity (Ph.Eur. 2.9.40), related substances (HPLC) and microbiological test (Ph.Eur. method). 
Analytical methods have been described and when non-compendial have been adequately validated 
in accordance with ICH Guideline, Q2B. The release and shelf-life specifications have been 
adequately justified based on product development, batch analyses, stability data for clinical and 
primary stability batches, and are in compliance with general pharmacopoeial standards (including 
Ph Eur) and ICH guidelines (Q3B and Q6A). 
Batch analysis results were provided for 13 pilot-scale batches of the finished product 
(12.5mg+30mg, 12.5mg+45mg, 25mg+30mg, and 25mg+45mg of alogliptin+pioglitazone, 
respectively). Tests were performed using the same analytical procedures proposed for testing of 
commercial product, except for dissolution. All results met the proposed commercial specifications.  
Stability of the product 
Stability studies have been performed on three pilot-scale batches of each strengths 
12.5mg+30mg, 12.5mg+45mg, 25mg+30mg, and 25mg+45mg of alogliptin and pioglitazone, 
respectively, in the proposed commercial package stored under long-term (25°C/60%RH) for up to 
48 months, accelerated (40°C/75%RH) for 6 months according to ICH conditions. Photostability 
testing was conducted on one batch of each strength according to ICH Q1B guidance, Option 1. 
Based on results presented, the drug product is not sensitive to light.  
Additional studies were performed under accelerated and long-term conditions for the bulk tablets 
packaged in an inner polyethylene bag sealed within an outer aluminum laminated bag with 
desiccant. 
CHMP assessment report

The parameters studied were appearance, assay, related substances, dissolution, hardness, and 
loss on drying for all time points; microbial examination at significant intervals (6 months at 
accelerated, annually at long term). 
No significant change could be observed for any of the parameters tested. Three commercial-scale 
batches have been tested for 18 months under long-term storage and the results are satisfactory. 
Bulk stability studies showed that the product remained stable after 24 months under long-term 
and 3 months under accelerated conditions.  
Based on the stability data generated, the proposed shelf-life for the tablets and storage conditions 
as stated in the SmPC are acceptable.   
2.2.5.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture, and control applied to the active substances 
(pioglitazone and alogliptin) and the finished product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. 
The two active substances have been shown to be chemically incompatible in mixtures under 
stressed and accelerated stability conditions. Therefore, separate granulations were prepared and 
compressed into bi-layer tablets to minimize physical interaction between the drug substances. 
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory 
and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.6.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of Incresync film-coated tablets is considered to be acceptable when used in the 
conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform 
clinical performance of this fixed-dose combination tablets have been investigated and are 
controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.7.  Recommendation for future quality development   
N/A 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The alogliptin/ pioglitazone fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet containing alogliptin and 
pioglitazone hydrochloride is being developed by Takeda for the treatment of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM). Proposed strengths are 25 mg/ 30 mg; 25 mg/ 45 mg; 12.5 mg/ 30 mg; and 12.5 
mg/ 45 mg. 
Alogliptin is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 enzyme that 
is being developed as an antihyperglycaemic agent. Alogliptin has been characterized in a battery of 
in vitro and in vivo pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, and toxicologic studies. Alogliptin, as 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 18/136 
 
  
  
synthesized, exists predominantly as the (R)-enantiomer (>99%). In vivo chiral conversion to 
(S)-alogliptin is minimal. Alogliptin is metabolized to 2 metabolites, an N-demethylated metabolite 
(M-I) and an N-acetylated metabolite (M-II). M-I has DPP-4 inhibitory activity that is similar to 
alogliptin, whereas the (S)-enantiomer has minimal DPP-4 inhibitory activity, and M-II does not 
inhibit DPP-4 in vitro. 
Pivotal toxicity and safety pharmacology studies were conducted in compliance with the good 
laboratory practice (GLP). 
The intended clinical route of administration is oral; therefore, with the exception of an IV single 
dose toxicity study in rats, IV and paravenous tolerance studies in rabbits, and an IP micronucleus 
study in mice, alogliptin was administered orally (gavage or capsule) in the in vivo toxicological 
evaluations. 
Nonclinical studies assessing immunotoxicity, including in vitro assessments for immune function 
and immunophenotyping of leukocyte populations, were not conducted with alogliptin. 
Pioglitazone is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR) agonist and member 
of the thiazolidinediones (TZD) class of oral antiglycaemic agents. 
Pioglitazone is currently approved for use in the treatment of T2DM in 107 countries (including the 
European Union, the US, and Japan). The initial EU Marketing Authorisation for pioglitazone was 
granted  in  October  2000 via  the  centralized procedure  and  a  10-year  renewal  was  approved  in 
August 2010. 
Pioglitazone is approved in the EU for the treatment of T2DM as monotherapy, as dual therapy in 
combination with metformin or a SU, as triple therapy in combination with metformin and a SU, or 
in combination with insulin. The Marketing Authorization (MA) for pioglitazone was granted by the 
European Commission in October 2000 and 5-year renewals received European Commission 
decisions in October 2005 and August 2010. 
With the exception of minor editorial changes and the inclusion of three studies conducted to 
evaluate the in vitro protein binding of pioglitazone and its active metabolite AD-4833 M-IV with 
glimepiride to human serum albumin (HSA) as well as the toxicity studies conducted to evaluate the 
mechanism for bladder cancer in male rats, the written and tabulated summaries for pioglitazone 
are the same as those that were submitted with the pioglitazone/metformin FDC MAA in 2005. Five 
studies supported the evaluation of the mechanism for bladder cancer in male rats. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
2.3.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Alogliptin 
In vitro Pharmacodynamic assays 
The primary pharmacological activity of alogliptin was determined in various enzyme assays. The 
target enzyme, dipeptidyl peptidase-4, was inhibited in vitro by alogliptin with an IC50 (nM) ranging 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 19/136 
 
  
  
from 6 to 18 depending on source of enzyme. The assays demonstrated that alogliptin is a potent 
and specific inhibitor of rat, dog, and human DPP-4 activity. Similar to alogliptin, the M-I metabolite 
is equipotent and a selective inhibitor of DPP-4. No inhibitory activity was noted for M-II, while weak 
DPP-4 inhibition was noted for the (S)-enantiomer of alogliptin. The R-enantiomer is 1000-times  
more active than the (S)-enantiomer. 
An assay comparing the potency and selectivity of alogliptin with other DPP-4 inhibitors (vildagliptin 
and sitagliptin) showed that alogliptin was more potent, and generally more selective; mean IC50 
values for DPP-4 inhibition for alogliptin, vildagliptin, and sitagliptin were 6.9 nmol/L, 23.8 nmol/L, 
and 12.1 nmol/L, respectively. 
In Vivo Primary Pharmacodynamic Assays 
The effects of alogliptin on DPP-4 activity were assessed in normal, euglycemic animals and in 
various animal models of T2DM. These in vivo studies evaluated the effects of alogliptin on diabetic 
parameters such as GHb, glucose tolerance, and plasma glucose and insulin levels, as well as 
effects on endocrine pancreatic function and morphology. In vivo, alogliptin was pharmacologically 
active in normoglycemic mice, rats, dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys and in mouse and rat models 
of T2DM. Alogliptin improved glucose tolerance and increased plasma insulin levels in normal mice.  
A single dose of alogliptin to wild-type C57BL/6 mice decreased the normalized plasma glucose area 
under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 90 minutes (AUC(0-90min)) to 75% of 
control values and increased plasma insulin levels to 146% of control values. When administered in 
the diet to diabetic ob/ob mice for 4 weeks, alogliptin decreased GHb and increased plasma insulin 
levels, plasma insulin/glucose ratio, and pancreatic insulin levels. 
In established rat models of T2DM, female Wistar fatty rats and nonobese N-STZ-1.5 rats, alogliptin 
produced a dose-dependent improvement in glucose tolerance and a dose-dependent increase in 
plasma immunoreactive insulin (IRI) levels. 
Oral administration of alogliptin to normal cynomolgus monkeys increased insulin and GLP-1 levels 
and decreased glucagon levels with no notable effect on plasma glucose. 
Alogliptin increased pancreatic insulin content in ob/ob mice and male N-STZ-1.5 rats. 
Immunohistochemical analyses of pancreatic β-cell and α-cell morphology in the ob/ob mice 
following 4 weeks of daily exposure to alogliptin revealed increased staining of the β-cells for 
insulin-like immunoreactivity. Apparent changes in β-cell number and size in the islets could not be 
detected, suggestive of a lack of β-cell proliferation or hypertrophy. There were no apparent 
changes in α-cell morphology. 
Pioglitazone 
The binding affinity of pioglitazone for recombinant human (h) PPARγ was examined in vitro by 
competitive binding assays. Pioglitazone demonstrated low micromolar affinity for PPARγ but not 
for PPARα. Assays for PPARα and PPARγ transactivation activity of pioglitazone indicated 50% 
effective concentration (EC50) values for hPPARγ1 of 420 nmol/L, 490 nmol/L, and 680 nmol/L. 
Pioglitazone produced rat PPARγ activation, with an EC50 value of 470 nmol/L. There was also some 
(relatively weak) activation of human PPARα by pioglitazone. There was no activation of human 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 20/136 
 
  
  
retinoid X receptor (RXR)α or retinoic acid receptor (RAR)α by pioglitazone. Transactivation activity 
of hPPARγ was also demonstrated with metabolites M-II, M-III, and M-IV, with EC50 values ranging 
from 1.0 to 7.0 μmol/L. 
Pioglitazone does not bind to insulin receptors. Pioglitazone appears to reduce insulin resistance by 
effects that are mediated at postbinding sites, but without increasing the expression of signaling 
molecules. 
Insulin-stimulated glucose incorporation was increased in diaphragmatic muscle and adipocytes 
obtained from KKAy mice after dietary administration of pioglitazone. Insulin-stimulated glycogen 
synthesis and glycolysis were increased in soleus muscle preparations obtained from male Wistar 
fatty rats after administration of pioglitazone (3 mg/kg/day) for 10 days. Insulin sensitivity, glucose 
oxidation, and lipid synthesis were augmented when adipocytes prepared from the epididymal fat 
pads of the same animals were incubated in the presence of glucose. Pioglitazone also potentiated 
the action of insulin mimickers, such as vitamin K5 and vanadate in adipocytes obtained from 
pioglitazone treated male Wistar fatty rats. The hepatic activity of glucokinase was increased, 
glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) was decreased, and pyruvate kinase activity was unchanged 
when pioglitazone was administered to Wistar fatty rats at 3 mg/kg/day and their lean litter mates 
at 10 mg/kg/day. Administration of pioglitazone (3 mg/kg/day) for 7 days accelerated the 
disappearance of exogenous TG from plasma and increased hepatic TG output in male Wistar fatty 
rats. 
Daily treatment of male Zucker fatty rats with pioglitazone (10 mg/kg/day) decreased their fasting 
plasma glucose and insulin concentrations, normalized their responses to an oral glucose load, and 
increased the glycemic response to insulin. Administration of pioglitazone to Wistar fatty rats, at a 
dose of 3 mg/kg/day, improved glucose tolerance and insulin hypersecretion in response to oral 
glucose loading (2 g/kg) and augmented the glycemic response to exogenous insulin. 
Pre-treatment for 7 days with pioglitazone (3 mg/kg/day) improved hepatic and peripheral insulin 
sensitivity as assessed by isotopic measurement of hepatic production and peripheral utilization of 
glucose in combination with euglycemic clamping. 
The hypoglycemic and hypotriglyceridemic activities of (+), (-), and (±) pioglitazone after 7 days of 
treatment at 1 mg/kg/day have been compared using the Wistar fatty (insulin resistant) rat model 
of T2DM. No differences in pharmacological activity were observed. 
Six metabolites (M-I, M-II, M-III, M-IV, M-V, and M–VI) of pioglitazone have been isolated from 
pioglitazone-treated animals and synthesized. The ability of each of the identified metabolites to 
reduce plasma glucose and TG was investigated in Wistar fatty rats dosed by the IP route. 
Metabolites M-II, M-III, and M-IV showed hypoglycemic and hypotriglyceridemic activities whereas 
metabolites M-I, M-V, and M-VI were inactive at doses up to the maximal dose tested (ie, 3 
mg/kg/day). None of the pharmacologically active metabolites were as potent as the parent 
compound in lowering plasma glucose levels. M-II was more potent in lowering plasma TG levels 
and metabolites M-III and M-IV were only slightly lower in potency.

2.3.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Alogliptin 
Secondary activity of alogliptin at concentrations of 1 and 10 µmol/L was evaluated in vitro in 
receptor binding assays and enzyme activity screening. At the high concentration alogliptin caused 
a 50% inhibition of naloxane binding at the opioid receptor in the rat cerebral cortex. No activity 
equal to or exceeding 50% was evident on other receptors, ion channels or enzymes. 
GLP-1 has been associated with decreased gastrointestinal (GI) motility and appetite. In vivo 
studies have shown that a single dose of alogliptin is effective in lowing plasma glucose levels, 
increasing plasma intact GLP-1 levels, and increasing plasma IRI levels in Wistar fatty rats. 
However, in this same strain (Wistar fatty rat), exposure to alogliptin for 8 consecutive weeks did 
not produce notable changes in body weight or in metabolic indices. Plasma total cholesterol (TC) 
was statistically decreased (p≤ 0.025) at the highest dose evaluated (10 mg/kg/day). Unlike the 
DPP-4 inhibition that occurred in this model after a single dose of alogliptin, only minimal DPP-4 
inhibition was observed after 8 consecutive weeks of treatment. 
A study to investigate effect of alogliptin or metformin on xylose absorption in male Wistar fatty rats 
was conducted. Metformin or alogliptin (1 mg/kg) were administered 1 hour prior to xylose 
challenge. No effect of alogliptin on xylose absorption was noted while metformin dose-dependently 
inhibited xylose absorption. 
Pioglitazone 
Efficacy is apparent against hyperglycaemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia in animal 
models of obesity/hyperglycaemia that mimic aspects of T2DM. Pioglitazone may also be effective 
in reducing the onset and severity of hypertension and nephropathy that occur in hyperinsulinemic 
states. The mechanism of action has yet to be clarified but involves modulation of intracellular 
signaling mediated via nuclear PPARγ. No potential has been identified for pioglitazone to elicit 
unintended pharmacological effects in non-target tissues. 
2.3.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
Alogliptin 
The potential of alogliptin to elicit unintended pharmacological activity in non-target systems has 
been investigated. With the exception of preliminary, investigative hERG assays with the HCl and 
TFA salts and the action potential duration assay; the core safety pharmacology studies were 
conducted in compliance with GLPs. 
Central Nervous System 
Alogliptin is unlikely to have untoward pharmacologic activity in the central nervous system (CNS). 
Although alogliptin inhibited naloxone binding at nonselective opioid receptors in vitro in the rat 
cerebral cortex, it did not show any binding affinity for human receptors typically associated with 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 22/136 
 
  
  
abuse potential (human recombinant opiate receptors). In vivo, no noteworthy 
alogliptin-related effects on general behavior and activity were observed in rats at doses of up to 
300 mg/kg/day for 4 consecutive weeks. The evaluations were performed at day -1, day 1 and day 
25 and included open-field observations, forelimb and hindlimb grip strength, hindlimb splay and 
pain perception. 
Respiratory and Cardiovascular Systems 
Alogliptin is not expected to interfere with respiratory or cardiovascular function at the proposed 
clinical dosage of 25 mg/day. The IC50 value for the in vitro inhibition of human ether 
a-go-go-related gene (hERG) channel currents by alogliptin was >30 μmol/L. At concentrations up 
to 30 μmol/L, alogliptin did not delay action potential repolarization in isolated canine Purkinje 
fibers, and no alogliptin-related effects on resting membrane potential, action potential amplitude, 
or the maximum rate of depolarization were noted. The sensitivity of these in vitro assays was 
confirmed by the appropriate positive controls.  
Alogliptin had no effect on body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure (systolic, diastolic, and 
mean arterial pressure), or electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters (PR or RR intervals, QRS duration, 
QT interval or corrected QT interval [QTc] value) in telemetrized beagle dogs given oral gavage 
doses of up to 25 mg/kg. No alogliptin-related cardiovascular effects were noted in dogs in the 
repeat-dose toxicity studies at oral doses of up to 200 mg/kg/day for up to 39 weeks.  
Alogliptin did not affect cardiac troponin (I or T isoform) concentrations in dogs. The 200 mg/kg/day 
dose to beagle dogs for 26 weeks provides an estimated exposure margin of alogliptin, based on 
area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 24 hours (AUC(0-24)), of 
approximately 227-fold higher than the clinical dose of 25 mg/day.  
Respiratory function of rats administered a single oral dose of 10 to 100 mg/kg alogliptin was 
unaffected. 
Pioglitazone 
In vitro and/or in vivo studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of pioglitazone on the CNS, 
cardiovascular system, autonomic nervous system, renal function, and digestive system. 
Doses of 100 and 300 mg/kg pioglitazone demonstrated slight anticonvulsive effects in male ICR 
mice whereas phenytoin significantly prevented seizures. No effects were noted at 30 mg/kg. 
There were no pioglitazone-related effects on the autonomic nervous system in anesthetized cats. 
At 100 µmol/L, pioglitazone produced a rightward shift in the concentration-response curve of the 
contraction of the isolated guinea pig ileum in response to acetylcholine, histamine, and barium and 
slightly inhibited the maximum contraction. Spontaneous motility of the isolated rabbit ileum was 
inhibited at a concentration of 100 µmol/L. Since these in vitro effects were not apparent at 
concentrations <100 µmol/L, there is a considerable margin of safety with respect to clinically 
attainable plasma concentrations of pioglitazone. Pioglitazone did not elicit unintended 
pharmacological actions when administered orally or intraduodenally at large multiples of the 
clinically relevant doses.  
CHMP assessment report

The potential for pioglitazone to modify cardiac action potential duration has not been evaluated; 
however, literature describes the effects of several antidiabetic TZDs on the action potential and 
membrane currents of rabbit ventricular myocytes. Pioglitazone had no significant effect on 
ventricular myocyte excitability, action potential configuration, or membrane currents over the 
concentration range 1 to 10 µmol/L. 
AD-4833 (HCl) had no significant effect on gastric emptying in rats. 
Pioglitazone had no significant effect on intestinal transport or urine volume or urinary excretion of 
sodium or potassium in rats. 
2.3.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Alogliptin 
Because T2DM is a progressive disease, combination therapies are used to achieve better glycemic 
control. Combination treatment with alogliptin, which stimulates insulin secretion, and pioglitazone, 
which enhances insulin sensitivity or with alogliptin and glibenclamide, which enhances insulin 
secretion, could augment their effects on glycemic control. Similarly, combination treatment with 
alogliptin and metformin or alogliptin and voglibose, therapeutic agents that affect intestinal 
glucose absorption, may provide better efficacy than treatment with either agent alone.  
Combined treatment with alogliptin and pioglitazone to db/db mice resulted in additive decreases in 
plasma GHb levels, plasma triglyceride (TG) levels, plasma nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) levels, 
and plasma glucose area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) values, and an additive 
increase in the insulinogenic index. This treatment synergistically decreased plasma glucose and 
synergistically increased pancreatic insulin content and, immunohistochemical analyses of 
pancreatic tissues revealed intense expression of insulinlike immunoreactivity (IR), normal 
β-cell/α-cell distributions, and overall expression of insulin promoter transcription factor 
(pdx-1)-like IR. Combined treatment with alogliptin and pioglitazone in ob/ob mice additively 
decreased GHb, fed and fasting plasma glucose levels, and plasma NEFA and additively increased 
plasma insulin, fed and fasting plasma/insulin glucose ratios, and pancreatic insulin content. 
Additionally, treatment with alogliptin alone or in combination with pioglitazone decreased plasma 
glucagon levels.  
Combination treatment with alogliptin and glibenclamide to N-STZ-1.5 rats additively decreased 
plasma glucose levels and additively increased plasma insulin levels.  
Combined treatment with alogliptin and voglibose to db/db mice additively decreased plasma DPP-4 
activity, synergistically increased plasma intact GLP-1 levels and pancreatic insulin content, and 
additively prevented deterioration of glycemic control while additively preserving plasma insulin 
levels. Immunohistochemical analyses of the pancreatic tissue from these mice showed that 
combination treatment with alogliptin and voglibose effectively preserved islet architecture and 
islet cell composition in db/db mice.

Pioglitazone 
The effects of coadministration with pioglitazone and metformin, glibenclamide, or voglibose on 
diabetic indices were evaluated in Wistar fatty rats. Combination treatment with pioglitazone and 
insulin was evaluated in Goto-Kakizaki rats.  
Oral administration of 1 mg/kg/day pioglitazone or 300 mg/kg/day metformin for 14 days 
decreased plasma glucose levels to 57% and 78% of control, respectively; coadministration of the 
same doses of AD-4833 (HCl) and metformin decreased plasma glucose levels to 38% of control. 
Combined treatment resulted in a marked reduction in hemoglobin A1 (82% of control). 
Combined treatment with pioglitazone and glibenclamide markedly improved glucose intolerance 
and slightly suppressed the oversecretion of insulin. 
Combined treatment with pioglitazone and voglibose decreased plasma glucose and TG levels more 
markedly than either compound separately. The combined treatment significantly decreased 
hemoglobin A1 levels, which were not decreased by either compound individually. 
Combined treatment of both pioglitazone and insulin decreased plasma glucose, TG and cholesterol 
levels more markedly than treatment with AD-4833 or insulin separately. Combined treatment 
normalized hemoglobin A1. 
Alogliptin combined with pioglitazone 
Combined treatment with alogliptin and pioglitazone to db/db mice resulted in additive decreases in 
plasma GHb levels, plasma triglyceride (TG) levels, plasma nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) levels, 
and plasma glucose area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) values, and an additive 
increase in the insulinogenic index. This treatment synergistically decreased plasma glucose and 
synergistically increased pancreatic insulin content and, immunohistochemical analyses of 
pancreatic tissues revealed intense expression of insulinlike immunoreactivity (IR), normal 
β-cell/α-cell distributions, and overall expression of insulin promoter transcription factor 
(pdx-1)-like IR [322/000178]. Combined treatment with alogliptin and pioglitazone in ob/ob mice 
additively decreased GHb, fed and fasting plasma glucose levels, and plasma NEFA and additively 
increased plasma insulin, fed and fasting plasma/insulin glucose ratios, and pancreatic insulin 
content. Additionally, treatment with alogliptin alone or in combination with pioglitazone decreased 
plasma glucagon levels. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
2.3.3.1.  Performed studies 
Alogliptin 
The pharmacokinetics of alogliptin were determined after oral or IV administration to rats, dogs and 
cynomolgus monkeys. The disposition of 14C-alogliptin was studied in rats and dogs. Plasma 
protein binding in mouse, rat, dog and human plasma was determined in vitro, and tissue 
distribution (including distribution to the eyeball and the placenta) of 14C-alogliptin was evaluated 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 25/136 
 
  
  
in rats. The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of alogliptin and its metabolites 
were studied in rats and dogs. The biotransformation of alogliptin was investigated extensively in 
vitro and in vivo in rats and dogs. A milk excretion study was also conduced in rats. Non-clinical 
pharmacokinetic and metabolism studies used formulations that were similar, or identical, to those 
used in toxicology and pharmacodynamic studies. 
The kinetics of alogliptin were also investigated when co-administered with pioglitazone and 
metformin. The effect on the kinetics of the combination of alogliptin with sulphonylurea or triple 
therapies was not investigated in the pre-clinical species. 
Validated LC-MS-MS methods having acceptable linear range, LLOQ, intra assay accuracy and 
precision were used to analyse Alogliptin, Alogliptin M-I and Alogliptin M-II in mouse plasma, rat 
plasma, rat fetal serum, rat milk, rabbit plasma, dog plasma or monkey plasma. Acceptable and 
validated methods were also developed for analysis of (S)-alogliptin in rat and dog plasma. 
For LC/MS/MS assays, alogliptin-d4 TFA salt and M-I-d4 were used as the internal standards for 
quantitation of alogliptin and M-I. 
For rat metabolism studies, a bioanalytical method based on HPLC with liquid scintillation detection 
and counting of radioactivity was used. 
Pioglitazone 
The pharmacokinetics of pioglitazone were determined after oral or IV administration to mice, rats, 
dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys. Extensive pharmacokinetic evaluations were conducted in rats, 
dogs, and monkeys, since these were the major species used in the toxicology program. The 
concentrations of pioglitazone and its six identified metabolites in plasma samples from a number of 
nonclinical pharmacokinetic and toxicology studies in mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, and monkeys were 
assayed using validated and acceptable analytical methods. 
Alogliptin combined with pioglitazone 
A toxicity study showed no toxicokinetic interactions between alogliptin and pioglitazone after a 
single oral administration of alogliptin with pioglitazone to rats. Therefore, nonclinical 
pharmacokinetic studies were not conducted using a combination of alogliptin and pioglitazone as 
test articles.  
2.3.3.2.  Absorption  
Alogliptin 
Caco-2 permeability 
Alogliptin has low permeability as the apparent permeability (Papp) coefficients were comparable to 
those of mannitol, which is a reference compound for low permeable compounds. The Papp ratios 
were different at each time point (1 and 2 hours) and were relatively low compared with those of 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 26/136 
 
  
  
digoxin. Therefore, the involvement of P-glycoprotein in the transport of alogliptin was not clear in 
a Caco-2 assay but expected to be limited.  
Single-dose pharmacokinetics 
The single-dose pharmacokinetics of alogliptin was studied in rats, dogs, monkeys and humans via 
PO and IV routes of administration. 
Alogliptin was absorbed in rats, dogs and monkeys following PO dose administration. The oral 
bioavailability of alogliptin in the non-clinical species evaluated differed across species 41-45% in 
rats, 69-85% in dogs and 72-88% in monkeys. Studies with radiolabeled alogliptin benzoate 
showed an oral absorption ratio of 61.1% in rats and 88.6% in dogs based on AUC0-24hr values. In 
rats, ~30% of the dose radioactivity was absorbed via the jejunal loop within 2 hours after 
administration of 14C-alogliptin benzoate (3 mg freebase/kg) into the jejunal loop suggesting that 
the jejunum is one of the major absorption sites in rats.  
Alogliptin was poorly absorbed (<0.1% at 24 hours post-dose) via the lymph after a single PO 
administration of 3 mg free base/kg radiolabeled alogliptin to rats.  
The terminal elimination half-life (T½) of alogliptin after IV administration was a little bit shorter in 
rats and dogs (1.1-1.4 hours and 1.5-2.9 hours, respectively) when compared to monkeys (5.7 
hours). In studies with PO (3 mg/kg) or IV (1 mg/kg) administered 14C-alogliptin, the half-life of 
the measured radioactivity was found to be 4.9 and 3.4 hours after oral and IV dosing, respectively, 
in rats and 6.7 and 5.3 hours, respectively, in dogs. The volume of distribution of alogliptin after IV 
dosing was ~2.6 – 3.9 L/kg in all pre-clinical species used. Plasma clearance values were higher in 
rats (~3.0 – 3.3 L/kg/hr) and dogs (~1.3 – 2.4 L/kg/hr) than in monkeys (~0.5 L/kg/hr). 
After a single PO administration of alogliptin benzoate in male rats and dogs, Cmax and AUC0-24hr 
values increased dose-proportional between 0.3 to 3 mg/kg in dogs, and more than 
dose-proportional between 3 to 30 mg/kg in dogs and between 3 to 100 mg/kg in rats.  Tmax and 
T½ values were generally constant over the tested dose range, but in dogs T½ was lower (~2-fold) 
at 0.3 mg/kg and Tmax higher (~3-fold) at 30 mg/kg compared to the other doses tested. 
Among the several salts of alogliptin that were evaluated, the benzoate salt showed the best 
bioavailability in rats and dogs. Therefore, it was selected for toxicity studies.  
Repeated-dose pharmacokinetics of alogliptin and its metabolites (M-I & M-II)  
The repeated-dose pharmaco- and toxicokinetics of alogliptin were determined after repeated PO 
dosing in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys. Alogliptin was rapidly absorbed in all species studies.   
In mice and monkeys, exposure to alogliptin was generally dose-proportional. For male mice, the 
exposure was higher than expected at the 200 mg/kg dose leading to dose non-proportionality on 
visual inspection, which was the result of the high, but largely variable plasma concentrations at 8 
hours and 12 hours post-dose on Day 1 and Day 90, respectively. In rats and dogs, the increase in 
alogliptin exposure was more than dose-proportional. In addition, there was an increase in T½ at 
increasing dose in rats. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 27/136 
 
  
  
In general, no significant accumulation of alogliptin was observed in mice and monkeys after 
repeated dosing with alogliptin. In rats, accumulation of alogliptin was observed with accumulation 
ratios mostly in the range of 1.7-2.8. In dogs, a slight accumulation was seen for alogliptin after 
repeated dosing with accumulation ratios ranging between 1.1 and 1.7.  
As only up to 1% of alogliptin will be present in vivo as [S]-alogliptin, its pharmaco- and 
toxicokinetics will not influence the pharmacological effects of alogliptin. 
Less than ~3.2% of alogliptin was converted to M-I in mice at all dose levels when the AUC values 
were compared and decreased with increasing dosages. On the other hand, in rats, the 
metabolite-to-parent ratio (in %) was maximally 33.8% with lower contribution of the metabolite to 
total exposure at increasing dosage. The elimination of M-I in rats seemed to be saturable since its 
T½ increased with increasing dose. Following a low oral dose of 10 mg/kg alogliptin, the 24-hour 
total exposure to M-I was 76 and 85% of that to the parent drug in female and male dogs, 
respectively. With increasing dose, the contribution of the metabolite exposure decreased (to 
20-40%). A saturable formation of the metabolite may be responsible for the decrease of M-I 
contribution with increasing dose. The 24-hour total exposure to M-I in monkeys was 11 and 12.6% 
of that to the parent drug for females and males, respectively, at the low dose and decreased to 2.5 
and 1.6%, respectively, at the high dose suggesting saturation of metabolism. 
No significant accumulation of M-I was observed in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys after oral 
repeated dosing with alogliptin.  
In all species for which data on M-II was present, AUC0-24hr values showed that M-II was only 
formed to a small extent: 0.5% in monkeys and <3% in rats. In rats, slight accumulation occurred 
at all dose levels except at 400 mg/kg/day in male rats with accumulation ratios up to ~2.6. In 
monkey, no accumulation of M-II was observed. 
Repeated-dose pharmacokinetics in pregnant animals 
Pregnancy had an impact on total exposure of alogliptin in pregnant rats and rabbits leading to 
differences in exposure to alogliptin and alogliptin metabolites most likely due to increases in 
distribution volume and differences in elimination. 
After oral dosing with 250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg in pregnant rats, Tmax and systemic exposure of 
alogliptin were generally higher on gestation day (GD) 17 compared to GD6. Plasma half-life was 
generally ~2.2 to 4 hours, but was ~49 hours at the highest dose on GD6 and not determinable on 
GD17. 
In pregnant rabbits, exposures were slightly lower on GD6 than on GD18 at doses of 100 and 200 
mg/kg but comparable at higher doses of 500 and 700 mg/kg which may indicate less absorption at 
the late stage of gestation for higher doses. 
Repeated-dose pharmacokinetics in juveniles 
The toxicokinetic effects of alogliptin in juvenile rats were assessed in an oral 4-week and 8-week 
toxicity study with dose levels of 30, 100 and 300 mg/kg. AUC0-24hr values for alogliptin and M-II 
increased more than dose-proportional with increases in dose and AUC0-24hr values for M-I less than 
dose-proportional with dose, and tended to increase with repeated doses (up to max. ~3-fold).

Pharmacokinetics when concomitantly administered with metformin or pioglitazone 
The combination treatment of alogliptin and metformin was investigated in one single-dose study 
and in two repeated-dose toxicity studies of 4 and 13 weeks, respectively. No effects on the 
toxicokinetics of metformin were observed when co-administered with alogliptin. The effects of 
concomitant treatment with alogliptin and pioglitazone on the toxicokinetic parameters of both 
compounds were assessed in a single-dose and two repeated-dose studies for 4 weeks and 13 
Weeks, respectively. These studies showed no toxicokinetic interactions regarding the kinetic 
parameters of alogliptin. 
Pioglitazone 
Single-dose PO studies were conducted in mice, rats, dogs, monkeys and humans. Values for CL 
and volume of distribution were derived after a single IV dose of 0.5 mg/kg in rats, dogs, monkeys 
and humans.  
Pioglitazone was well absorbed in the non-clinical species following oral administration of 0.5 
mg/kg. Oral bioavailability was 81% in mice and monkeys, 85% in rats, 94% in dogs and 83% in 
humans. Hepatic first-pass effect was insignificant in rats, although an in vitro study did show that 
pioglitazone was partly metabolized in rat duodenum. In an absorption site study, pioglitazone was 
well absorbed from all segments of the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract, and absorption was greatest 
form the small intestine in rats. 
Maximum plasma concentrations were achieved within 1, 4, 0.5, 4.3 and 1.5 hour of dosing in mice, 
rat, dog, monkey and human, respectively, indicating a slower rate of absorption in monkeys. The 
elimination of pioglitazone was rapid with an estimated T½ of 2.1-5.7 hours in all species. The 
volume of distribution was comparable across species, ~0.22-0.47 L/kg. Clearance was more rapid 
in dogs (~329 mL/h/kg) than in rat (~60 mL/h/kg), monkey (~77 mL/h/kg) or humans (~33 
mL/h/kg). 
The linearity of plasma kinetics of pioglitazone after single doses was examined in the rat over the 
concentration range 0.5 to 30 mg/kg. Cmax and AUC values increased with rising dose and were 
almost proportionally increased in relation to the dose increase. 
Pharmacokinetics after repeated dosing were studied in male rats given 7 consecutive daily oral 
doses of 0.5 mg/kg radiolabeled pioglitazone HCl. The kinetics of total radioactivity were not 
changed by 7 days dosing at a pharmacologically relevant dose. 
2.3.3.3.  Distribution 
Alogliptin 
Protein binding 
In vitro plasma protein binding of alogliptin was studied in mice, rats, dogs and humans. The results 
indicate that alogliptin has low protein binding (<60% in all species) and was concentration 
dependent. Plasma protein binding of M-I was also low (<40% in all species). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 29/136 
 
  
  
Red blood cell partitioning 
Following PO administration of 3 mg free base/kg 14C-alogliptin benzoate to rats, concentrations of 
radioactivity in red blood cells were 35% to 41% and were almost constant from 1 to 24 hours 
post-dose. In dogs, the distribution ratio of radioactivity into blood cells constantly decreased from 
1 to 8 hours post-dose from 38% to 23% when dosed with 3 mg free base/kg 14C-alogliptin. 
Tissue distribution 
Distribution was studied in rats following PO administration of a single dose of 14C-alogliptin 
benzoate (3 mg freebase/kg) to male albino and male pigmented rats. Radioactivity was absorbed 
rapidly with most matrices reaching Cmax at 4 hours post dose. In albino rats, the tissues with the 
highest mean Cmax values at 4 hours, excluding the gastrointestinal (GI) tract tissues, were 
kidneys, liver, lungs, pituitary gland, and submaxillary glands. The tissues with the lowest Cmax 
values were brain and spinal cord. By 72 hours post dose, concentrations of radioactivity were low 
in all tissues except the kidneys. 
In pigmented rats, the concentrations of radioactivity in the plasma showed a similar profile to that 
in albino rats. The concentrations of radioactivity in the eyes of pigmented rats, however, were 
much higher than those in the eyes of albino rats. These results suggest that alogliptin-related 
materials have an affinity to melanin and Alogliptin accounted for most of the residual radioactivity 
in sclera of pigmented rats after a single PO administration of 14C-alogliptin benzoate. 
Placental transfer 
On gestation day (GD) 18, pregnant rats were administered 14C-alogliptin benzoate (3 mg free 
base/kg) via PO (322-00246). Radioactivity was quickly absorbed and Cmax was reached at 4 hours. 
The Cmax of total radioactivity in fetal tissues (136 ng equiv/g) was lower than the corresponding 
value in maternal plasma (191 ng equiv/g). The Cmax of total radioactivity in placenta was higher 
(639 ng equiv/g) than that in maternal plasma. 
Elimination of total radioactivity in fetal plasma, amniotic fluid, and fetal tissues was rapid (0.004, 
0.002, 0.003 ng equiv/g at 24 hours post-dose, respectively). The concentration-time profiles of 
radioactivity in the fetuses and fetal plasma were parallel to those in the maternal plasma. The 
radioactivity in the placenta was higher than that in maternal plasma or in amniotic fluid. However, 
elimination of total radioactivity in placenta was also rapid. The concentrations of radioactivity in 
the fetuses and fetal plasma were lower than those in the maternal plasma at all the time points 
examined, suggesting that the transfer of radioactive compounds from the maternal side to the 
fetal side was quantitatively restricted by placental passage. Based on these results, it can be 
concluded that 14C-alogliptin-derived radioactivity is able to cross the blood-placental barrier. 
Pioglitazone 
Protein binding 
[14C]pioglitazone exhibited relatively high (>98%) plasma protein binding in all species, including 
humans, and binding was broadly concentration-independent in all species.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 30/136 
 
  
  
Red blood cell partitioning 
There was no preferential partitioning into red blood cells. 
Tissue distribution 
The volume of distribution of pioglitazone ranged from approximately 0.22 to 0.47 L/kg across 
species. These values were relatively small, suggesting that pioglitazone was not extensively 
partitioned into tissues, which was confirmed in tissue distribution studies with [14C]pioglitazone in 
male rats. Radioactivity was detectable in a wide range of tissues and the highest values were 
recorded at 6 hours after dosing except in the case of stomach. Except liver, tissue:plasma 
radioactivity ratios were less than one. These results indicated a wide distribution of 
[14C]pioglitazone without extensive uptake in any specific tissues. At 6 hours, the concentration of 
radioactivity in the liver was 1.60 µg equivalents/g and 0.97 µg equivalents/mL in plasma. 
Radioactivity declined to low but quantifiable levels by 24 hours and was undetectable except in 
Harder’s gland, thyroid, liver, adrenal gland, kidney, and fat at 72 hours. In the pigmented rats, the 
14C was distributed in the choroidea and skin (pigment) with relatively high concentrations but 
disappeared within 72 hours after dosing. In other tissues, no apparent differences were observed 
between albino and pigmented rats. After repeated dosing for 14 days, most tissues attained steady 
state exposure. The highest tissue concentrations were found in the liver and brown fat. 
Placental transfer 
Following oral administration, radioactivity was quickly absorbed and transferred to fetal tissues. 
Pioglitazone and metabolites M-II, M-III, M-IV, and M-V were quantifiable in fetal plasma. 
Radioactivity was consistently higher in maternal plasma than in fetal tissues, amniotic fluid and 
placenta. 
2.3.3.4.  Metabolism 
Alogliptin 
Alogliptin was stable in all metabolic systems investigated (human, rat, dog, and monkey 
cryopreserved hepatocytes and rat, dog, monkey, and human liver microsomes) with the exception 
of dog and rat hepatocytes (approximately 50% and 65% of the parent compound remained after 
2-hour incubation with dog and rat hepatocytes, respectively).  
Identification of the metabolites showed that alogliptin is considered to be biotransformed to M-I by 
N-demethylation, and to M-II by acetylation of the amino group. M-I is an N-demethylated 
metabolite and a pharmacologically active metabolite with a DPP-4 inhibitory activity similar to that 
of alogliptin (IC50: 14 and 10 nmol/L, respectively in human plasma). M-II is an N-acetylated 
metabolite and has no DPP-4 inhibitory activity and thus a pharmacologically inactive metabolite.  
Both M-I and M-II are minor human metabolites with an exposure to these 2 identified minor 
metabolites in plasma, relative to unchanged drug, of <1% and <6%, respectively. All metabolites 
found in humans were also found in rats and dogs and there are thus no unique human metabolites 
of alogliptin. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 31/136 
 
  
  
When the exposure to M-I was compared following oral (gavage) administration of alogliptin to 
Sprague Dawley rats, beagle dogs and monkeys during a 28-day toxicity study Cmax levels of M-I 
were found to be much higher in dogs (day 26) as compared to rats (day 28) and monkeys (day 1). 
The in vivo chiral conversion of [R]-alogliptin to [S]-alogliptin was negligible (<1%) in rats and dogs 
in both plasma and urine samples. 
Pioglitazone 
Pioglitazone exhibits chirality, with chiral inversion between (+) and (-)-enantiomers of 
pioglitazone observed in plasma of rats and humans. No obvious differences in the absorption and 
elimination between the two enantiomers were observed in rats. 
In vivo, pioglitazone was extensively metabolized in all species investigated, including humans and 
the metabolic profile was found to be similar across species. Six metabolites were identified in 
animals and human plasma, urine, or feces samples, mainly arising from hydroxylation of the 2 
side-chain attached to the pyridine ring of pioglitazone. After oral administration, all species, 
including humans, were systemically exposed to the active metabolite M-IV and to other 
metabolites. None of the pharmacologically active metabolites were as potent as parent compound 
in lowering plasma glucose. Humans were found to be primarily exposed to pioglitazone and M-IV, 
with less exposure to other metabolites. Mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys were also primarily exposed 
to pioglitazone and M-IV. 
2.3.3.5.  Excretion 
Alogliptin 
Following PO administration of 14C-alogliptin benzoate to rats and dogs, the major route of 
elimination of total radioactivity was via the feces in both species. 
In rat alogliptin and M-I were the major components in the urine and feces, M-II was a minor 
component in feces. A study to evaluate the potential enterohepatic recirculation of alogliptin 
indicated that alogliptin-related radioactivity undergoes some enterohepatic recirculation in rats. In 
dogs alogliptin and M-I were the major components in urine and feces and M-II was not detected. 
After PO administration of 14C-alogliptin benzoate (3 mg freebase/kg) to lactating rats on Lactation 
Day (LD) 14, the concentrations of radioactivity in the plasma reached a maximum of 0.170 μg 
equiv/mL at 0.5 hours post dose and rapidly decreased to 0.006 μg equiv/mL at 24 hours post dose, 
followed by a gradual decrease to 0.003 μg equiv/mL 48 hours postdose. The concentrations of 
radioactivity in the milk reached a maximum of 0.316 μg equiv/mL at 0.5 hours postdose and 
rapidly decreased to 0.012 μg equiv/mL at 24 hours postdose, followed by a gradual decrease to 
0.003 μg equiv/mL at 48 hours postdose. These results indicate that alogliptin and its related 
compounds were secreted into the milk of lactating rats after a single PO administration of 
14C-alogliptin benzoate. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013

Pioglitazone 
Excretion balance data were provided for mice, rats, dogs, cynomolgus monkeys, and humans. 
Excretion was primarily urinary in the monkey but the fecal route predominated in the other 
species. Following oral administration of [14C]pioglitazone, excretion of radioactivity was rapid, 
with most excretion occurring within 24 to 48 hours post dose. Good recovery of radioactivity was 
observed in all studies. The primary route of elimination of total radioactivity after oral 
administration to mice, rats, dogs was via fecal excretion (76%, 63% and 81%, respectively), while 
in monkeys the primary route of excretion was urinary excretion (77%). (In humans urinary 
excretion was 32% and fecal excretion 39% in a study where total excretion of the administrated 
dose was 71%.) In all species, including humans, only a very small amount of unchanged 
pioglitazone was excreted into urine, indicating that renal clearance of pioglitazone was a minor 
elimination pathway, and that pioglitazone was mainly eliminated by metabolism. Following 
excretion into bile in rats, pioglitazone-related radioactivity was shown to be re-absorbed 
significantly. 
2.3.3.6.  Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Alogliptin 
In vitro, alogliptin is a weak direct CYP2D6 inhibitor at concentrations ≥40 µM (=~14 µg/mL). 
Metabolism-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4/5 was observed for alogliptin with an IC50 value of 78 
µM (=~26 µg/mL). These concentrations are however much higher than the human Cmax of 0.483 
µg/mL reached after a 100 mg dose, which is four times higher than the clinical recommended dose 
of 25 mg. Therefore, alogliptin is not expected to be an inhibitor of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5 in vivo in 
humans as is underlined by the results of the clinical drug-drug interaction study with midazolam 
(CYP3A4) and dextromorphan (CYP2D6). CYPs 1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19 were not inhibited in vitro by 
alogliptin as is supported by the observation that alogliptin does not interact with rosiglitazone, 
glyburide or glipizide. 
Induction of CYP enzymes by alogliptin was only observed for CYP3A4/5 at a concentration of 100 
µM based on testosterone 6ß-hydroxylase activity, although this was not statistically significant. 
However, the induction potential was about a fourth of the effectiveness of the known inducer 
rifampin, and no induction was observed clinically. Therefore, no CYP induction is expected in 
humans. 
The applicant investigated if alogliptin is an in vitro inhibitor of OAT1, OAT3 and OCT2. The study 
included both control cells and cells transfected with the specific transporter of interest. Further, the 
used probe substrates (PAH, E3S and metformin) and positive control inhibitors (probenecid, 
probenecid and quinidine) are appropriate. No clinically relevant inhibition by alogliptin (based on 
its Cmax of 0.3 µM) was seen for any of the investigated transporters. 
The inhibitory effect of alogliptin on BCRP was examined using BCRP expressed cells. After 
incubation of [3H]prazosin (0.01 μmol/L), a substrate for BCRP, at 37°C with alogliptin at 
concentrations of 0, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, and 100 μmol/L, the Papp ratios of [3H]prazosin (0.01 
μmol/L) were 12.5, 12.6, 11.2, 12.0, 10.6, 12.8, and 11.9×10–6 cm/sec across the 
BCRP-expressing cells, and were 1.3, 1.3, 1.2, 1.3, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.3×10–6 cm/sec across the 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 33/136 
 
  
  
control cells, respectively. The corrected Papp ratios were 9.6, 9.7, 9.3, 9.2, 8.8, 9.8, and 9.2, 
respectively. These results suggest that alogliptin had no inhibitory effect on BCRP-mediated efflux 
activity. Therefore, alogliptin is not an inhibitor of BCRP. 
No in vitro studies were performed with MATE and OATP. A clinical study was performed to study the 
interaction potential between alogliptin and cyclosporine (inhibitor of OATP1B1/OATP1B3, BCRP 
and P-glycoprotein). Whether alogliptin is a substrate and/or an inhibitor of MATE1 and MATE2 was 
investigated in a clinical study in healthy volunteers with cimetidine and metformin. (Please see 
clinical pharmacology section for further details) 
Pioglitazone 
The effect of oral administration of pioglitazone at doses of 0.5, 3 and 30 mg/kg for 7 days on the 
activity of hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzymes was investigated in male rats and 
compared with the inducible effects of phenobarbital. No changes in total hepatic CYP and 
cytochrome b5 levels, and activities of 4-nitroanisole O-demethylation, 4-nitrophenol 
hydroxylation, regio- and stereoselective testosterone hydroxylation, and 4-nitrophenol 
glucuronidation were observed. Thus pioglitazone was devoid of any induction effects on hepatic 
microsomal drug-metabolizing enzymes in this mode. 
Competitive protein binding to human serum albumin (HSA) between pioglitazone and 12 
concomitant drugs (glibenclamide, gliclazide, acetohexamide, buformin HCl, furosemide, 
manidipine HCl, delapril HCl, pravastatin, bezafibrate, cimetidine, digoxin and warfarin) was 
studied. Results indicated that there is no interaction in protein binding between pioglitazone and 
the 12 drugs at anticipated therapeutic concentrations.  
The effects of pioglitazone on the in vitro binding of glimepiride to HSA were investigated. At about 
10 times the therapeutic concentration of pioglitazone, the concentration of unbound glimepiride 
was slightly increased to 1.18-fold. The therapeutic concentration of pioglitazone did not affect the 
concentration of unbound glimepiride. These results show that the plasma protein binding of 
glimeripide did not change significantly with concomitant dosing with pioglitazone HCl in clinical 
use. Effect of glimepiride on the in vitro binding of pioglitazone and its active metabolite M-IV to 
HSA were investigated. The presence of glimepiride had no effect on the plasma protein binding 
ratio of pioglitazone and M-IV to HSA. 
No transporter-based drug-drug interactions with pioglitazone have been conducted. Pioglitazone 
did not show any inhibition towards P-gp and BCRP in vitro. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The safety of alogliptin has been investigated in a battery of nonclinical toxicity studies including 
single- and repeat-dose toxicity studies in mice, rats, and dogs, reproductive toxicity studies in rats 
and rabbits, and in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies. Two-year carcinogenicity studies were 
conducted in mice and rats. Repeat-dose toxicity studies were also conducted in juvenile rats (4 
weeks of age at dose initiation), including one study specifically aimed at evaluating the possible 
toxicity on male reproductive organs. Local tolerance studies assessing the hemocompatibility of a 
parenteral formulation of alogliptin in human blood/plasma and the IV and paravenous tolerance of 
alogliptin were performed in rabbits. Special toxicity studies (4- and 13-week) were conducted in 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 34/136 
 
  
  
monkeys to evaluate the potential dermal toxicity of alogliptin. The potential of alogliptin to induce 
phototoxicity was evaluated in a hairless mouse model. 
In addition repeat-dose toxicity studies (4- and 13 week) in rats and an embryo-fetal development 
toxicity study in rats were conducted to assess the toxicity of combination treatments with alogliptin 
and pioglitazone and with alogliptin and metformin. 
Toxicology studies conducted with pioglitazone include single- and escalating-dose studies in rats 
and monkeys; repeat-dose toxicity studies of durations up to 13 weeks in mice, and 1 year in rats, 
dogs, and monkeys; in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies; and reproductive toxicity studies. 
Two-year carcinogenicity bioassays were conducted in mice and rats. Special toxicity studies were 
conducted to further clarify urinary bladder, heart, and ovarian findings, to compare toxicities in 
lean vs fatty animals, and general toxicity and genotoxicity testing served to qualify the potential 
product impurities. 
2.3.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
Alogliptin 
The lethal single oral and IV doses of alogliptin in rats were greater than 1471 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg, 
respectively. The lethal single oral dose in dogs was greater than 368 mg/kg. There were no 
sex-related differences in the single-dose toxicity of alogliptin. Clinical signs were observed in dogs 
only. Reddened skin around the ears and face were observed in males following oral doses of ≥ 92 
mg/kg and in females at ≥ 221 mg/kg. Warm to touch and/or decreased activity were observed at 
doses of ≥ 221 mg/kg. A female dosed with 368 mg/kg also exhibited swelling around the face, skin 
cold to touch, salivation, and emesis; this female also lost weight during the 2-week post dose 
observation period. 
Pioglitazone 
There were no mortalities or abnormal clinical signs after oral dosing at doses up to 2000 mg/kg in 
mice or rats. Signs of acute intoxication were apparent within 5 to 30 minutes after an IP dose of ≥
90 mg/kg in mice, and after a dose of ≥ 260 mg/kg in rats. Deaths occurred between Days 0 and 5 
in mice after IP doses of 180 and 250 mg/kg and between Days 2 and 6 in rats at doses of ≥ 360 
mg/kg. Calculated LD50 values derived following IP dosing were 181 mg/kg for mice of both sexes 
and 558 and 587 mg/kg for male and female rats, respectively. 
Alogliptin combined with pioglitazone 
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (3/group, 6 weeks of age) were administered oral gavage doses of 3.6 
and 14.5 mg/kg pioglitazone, 30 and 100 mg/kg alogliptin, 100 mg/kg alogliptin with 3.6 mg/kg 
pioglitazone, and 30 mg/kg alogliptin with 14.5 mg/kg pioglitazone. There were no toxicokinetic 
interactions resulting from concomitant treatment with alogliptin and pioglitazone. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 35/136 
 
  
  
2.3.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
Alogliptin 
Low toxicity was showed for mice, with a NOAEL of about 50 times the intended human exposure 
based on AUC. In mice, several deaths occurred in the repeat-dose toxicity studies. Although 
pathologic examinations could not confirm the exact cause of these deaths, the incidence increased 
dose dependently at doses of 400 mg/kg/day and higher. Alogliptin-related observations were 
noted in male mice and included yellow discoloured fur and unkempt appearance at 200 mg/kg/day 
and higher, and swelling in the anogenital area at 400 mg/kg/day and higher. Decreased RBC, HCT, 
and HGB were also noted at 600 mg/kg/day. 
Most important alogliptin-related histopathologic findings in rats were noted in the liver, kidneys, 
and urinary bladder. Increased ALP, increased liver weights, and centrilobular hepatocellular 
hypertrophy were noted in rats administered doses of ≥900 mg/kg/day. With the exception of 
increased liver weights, liver-related findings were fully reversible. Mortality was observed in rats 
administered repeat doses of ≥1000 mg/kg/day. The The clinical pathologic findings observed 
included increased WBC, LYM, RET, or MON and decreased RBC, HCT, and HGB at 900 mg/kg/day 
and higher, and increased phosphorus and cholesterol at 1000 mg/kg/day and higher. Decreased 
ALB and A/G (albumin/globulin) ratio were also observed at 1333 mg/kg/day and higher. NOAEL for 
6 months exposure was 400 mg/kg/day, which is about 50 – 150 times the intended human 
exposure. 
In the repeat-dose toxicity studies in dogs, occasional and transient occurrences of reddened ears 
and facial swelling without associated histopathologic changes were observed at doses of 
30 mg/kg/day and higher. In the 39-week repeat-dose toxicity study, dogs administered 
200 mg/kg/day (highest dose evaluated) lost weight during the first month of the treatment period; 
these losses resulted in a decrease in mean body weight during the treatment period. The overall 
NOAEL in dogs was 200 mg/kg/day; at this dose, the AUC(0-24) was 400 µg·hr/mL (combined 
sexes). 
The effects of concomitant treatment with alogliptin and pioglitazone on the toxicokinetic 
parameters of both compounds were assessed in a single-dose and two repeated-dose studies for 
4 weeks and 13 Weeks, respectively. These studies showed no toxicokinetic interactions regarding 
the kinetic parameters of alogliptin. In addition, the incidence and magnitude of the findings seen in 
rats administered alogliptin and pioglitazone in combination for 13 weeks were comparable to rats 
that received pioglitazone alone. Combination treatment with alogliptin and pioglitazone did not 
produce new toxicities, and did not exacerbate any pioglitazone-related findings. 
Pioglitazone 
Plasma volume expansion producing hemodilution (decreased RBC counts and decreased HCT and 
HGB) and eccentric cardiac hypertrophy occurred after repeated dosing in mice, rats, dogs, and 
monkeys, a response suggested being adaptive and compensatory in nature, and reversible. The 
plasma volume expansion appears to be a consequence of enhancement of the natriuretic 
properties of insulin resulting in increased Na retention mediated via the renal tubular Na+, K+ 
ATPase system. The NOAELs for Pioglitazone (HCl) derived from 52-week repeat-dose toxicity 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 36/136 
 
  
  
studies were defined as the highest doses that did not produce increased heart weight, and were 1 
mg/kg/day(rats), 1.1 mg/kg/day (male dogs), 3.4 mg/kg/day (female dogs), and 35.6 mg/kg/day 
(monkeys).  
Changes in the size and location of fat depots and, at high doses, vacuolar and vascular changes in 
adipose tissue and changes in the bone marrow fat:cell ratio seen in rodents was considered to be 
due to an exaggeration of the pharmacological effect of pioglitazone. Enlargement of the liver seen 
after administration of high doses in mice and rats was not associated with elevation of liver 
enzymes or pathology. An approximately 2-fold elevation of ALT, when compared with concurrent 
control values, was reported for dogs treated with Pioglitazone (HCl) at 11.4 mg/kg/day for 3 
months or one year but not at 10 mg/kg/day for 6 months. There were no associated 
histopathologic changes and ALT values were reversible. 
Alogliptin combined with pioglitazone 
Combination treatment with alogliptin and pioglitazone for up to 13 consecutive weeks in rats did 
not produce unanticipated toxicities, and did not exacerbate any pioglitazone-related findings.  
2.3.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
Alogliptin 
Alogliptin was evaluated for its potential to induce reverse mutations in S typhimurium and E coli, 
its mutagenic potential in vitro in L5178Y/TK+/- mouse lymphoma cells, and its mutagenic potential 
in vivo in a mouse bone marrow micronucleus study. Where appropriate, positive controls were 
used to confirm the sensitivity of the assay. Based on the results of these studies, alogliptin does 
not pose a mutagenic or clastogenic risk to humans. 
Pioglitazone 
Pioglitazone was inactive in an Ames Salmonella microsomal plate incorporation assay using strains 
TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537 and TA1538 over the concentration range 250 to 2000 µg/plate. 
Negative results were obtained in an additional bacterial mutation assay in which concentrations 
over the range 156 to 5000 µg/plate were tested against E coli WP2uvrA and S typhimurium (strains 
TA100, TA1535, TA98, and TA1537). Pioglitazone was also negative at the tk locus 
(5-trifluorothymidine resistance) in mouse lymphoma cells.  
In the CHO/HPRT and AS-52/XPRT mammalian cell forward mutation assays, there were no 
increases in mutation frequency in either cell line. An in vitro cytogenetic test using Chinese 
Hamster Lung (CHL) cells also proved negative. An unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay using 
primary rat hepatocyte cultures revealed no increase in UDS at concentrations up to 100 µg/mL. 
A bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice given IP doses of pioglitazone, dissolved in DMSO, at 
1250, 2500, and 5000 mg/kg, showed no statistically significant increases in micronuclei in 
polychromatic erythrocytes at any dose at any time point.

2.3.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
Alogliptin 
Alogliptin was shown to be not oncogenic or carcinogenic in mice, and the NOAEL of the 2-year 
carcinogenicity study was 300 mg/kg/day. Slightly, statistically non-significant, increased incidence 
in malignant lymphoma in female mice was observed at doses of 150 mg/kg/day when compared 
with historical control data. 
In rats, a slight, statistical non-significant increase in the incidence of thyroid C-cell tumours was 
noted in males at ≥ 400 mg/kg/day. This was weakly supported by increments of adenomas and 
hyperplasia. However, the incidence of these findings in this study was within the variability 
suggested by the historical control. Moreover, a rodent-specific mechanism through increased 
calcitonin release has been suggested for increases in C-cell tumours seen for GLP1 analogues 
(Knudsen et.al. Endocrinology 151:1473-86). Therefore, a weak increase in C-cell tumours after 
alogliptin treatment could be explained by the indirect impact on GLP1 levels following the 
administration of this DPP4 inhibitor. 
Minimal to mild simple transitional cell hyperplasia in the urinary bladder was noted in 2, 6, 10, and 
14 males at 0, 75, 400, and 800 mg/kg/day, respectively. In the male historical control series, 
simple transitional cell hyperplasia in the urinary bladder was reported for several studies and was 
seen in 6/60 males in one study. NOAEL for simple transitional cell hyperplasia in the urinary 
bladder was considered to be 75 mg (males) and 400 mg (females)/kg/day. 
Also, alogliptin-related non-neoplastic histopathologic changes were seen in the liver, lung, and 
urinary bladder of males and females, and in the testes, epididymides, and prostate of males. The 
NOAEL for nonneoplastic changes was 75 mg/kg/day for males and 400 mg/kg/day for females. The 
safety factors based on AUC are about 25 and >200 respectively. 
Pioglitazone 
There was no indication of any carcinogenic potential in mice. There was an increased incidence of 
urinary bladder benign/malignant transitional cell tumors in male rats administered doses of 4 
mg/kg/day and higher.  
Additional mechanistic studies were conducted to further evaluate the mechanisms of the bladder 
carcinogenesis observed in rats. Investigative studies were conducted to assess mRNA expression 
of the PPARs in the urinary bladder of rats, mice, and humans, to evaluate methodologies for 
detection of the microcrystals and hyperplastic changes, and to provide information about the 
optimal concentration for the acidified diet. These studies were followed by a 2-year mechanistic 
study in male rats that was conducted to provide evidence that the microcrystal hypothesis as 
described by Cohen was the causative factor of the urinary bladder hyperplasia seen in male rats . 
The chronic mechanistic study of the effects of pioglitazone with or without NH4Cl dietary 
acidification demonstrated that although the incidence of proliferative lesions in the urinary bladder 
was increased in rats administered pioglitazone, the incidence of advanced proliferative lesions, ie, 
carcinoma, papilloma, and/or nodular and papillary hyperplasia were suppressed when the urinary 
pH was lowered by feeding the rats an acidified diet.

2.3.4.5.  Reproduction Toxicity 
Alogliptin 
In a rat fertility study with dose levels of 0, 100, 500, 1000 mg/kg bw/day, maternal toxicity was 
observed at 500-1000 mg/kg/day, and paternal toxicity at 100 – 1000 mg/kg/day. In male rats, 
dose related increase of absolute and relative cauda epididymis weight, relative epididymis weight, 
relative weight of seminal vesicle with coagulating glands and relative testes weight and an 
increased % of abnormal sperm were observed, however, without any effect on fertility. At the 
highest dose of 1000 mg/kg increased post implantation loss and decreased number of viable 
foetuses occurred. 
Two embryo-foetal developmental reproduction toxicity studies were done, one in rats and one in 
rabbits. In rats, doses 250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day induced maternal toxicity and foetal toxicity. 
It is likely that the foetal toxicity (bent ribs, decreased ossification) was secondary to the maternal 
effects (decreased food consumption and gravid uterine weight change). In rabbits, high doses 
resulted in maternal deaths (highest doses) and toxicity signs (lower food consumption and body 
weight and body weight and gravid uterine weight). The only observed foetal effect was decreased 
number of viable foetuses in the only surviving doe at the highest dose level, which can be 
considered a consequence of maternal toxicity. 
An embryo-foetal developmental toxicity study in rats was also done with the combination of 
alogliptin with pioglitazone. The combination only showed a slight potentiation of foetal growth 
inhibition. 
A pre/postnatal developmental study in rats revealed maternal toxicity in the form of decreased 
gestation body weights, gestation body weight changes, lactation body weight, food consumption 
during lactation at doses of 500 – 1000 mg/kg/day. At 1000 mg/kg, developmental toxicity was 
found, consisting of increased stillborn index, decreased pup viability and effects on motor activity, 
learning, memory in F1 males. At 500-1000 mg/kg/day, decreased pup body weight was observed 
up to PND28 and through pre/post mating of F1. 
Two rat juvenile toxicity studies were performed, one with a treatment duration of 4 weeks and one 
with a treatment duration of 8 weeks, both with the same dose levels of 30, 100 and  300 
mg/kg/day. In the 4-week study some slight effects were found on haematological and 
blood/urinary chemistry and slight hepatocyte hypertrophy, but these changes were not considered 
toxicologically significant and were not replicated in the second longer study. 
Pioglitazone 
There was no effect of pioglitazone on male or female fertility in rat (NOEL for reproductive 
performance was 11.1 mg/kg/day - the highest dose used in the study). 
Pioglitazone was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits. However, embryotoxicity, increased incidences 
of skeletal and visceral variants, retarded fetal growth and development, and delayed attainment of 
reproductive capacity were apparent. In rats Pioglitazone was embryotoxic at 44.9 mg/kg/day; 
fetal body weight and crown-rump length were decreased, and the incidences of skeletal and 
visceral variants were increased at 11.2 and 22.5 mg/kg/day. The body weight gains of the 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 39/136 
 
  
  
offspring of rats treated at 22.5 and 44.9 mg/kg/day were reduced and the high dose animals 
required 3 breeding periods to achieve fertility rates that were comparable with control rates. In 
rabbits doses of 0, 44.5, 89.0, and 178 mg/kg/day administered on Days 6 through 18 of gestation 
embryotoxicity was only evident at the dose of 178 mg/kg/day pioglitazone and there was no 
evidence of developmental toxicity. The findings in the animal studies were suggested to be 
secondary to effects on the maternal organism via the pharmacological activity of Pioglitazone and 
not to be indicative of primary selective developmental toxicity. 
Alogliptin combined with pioglitazone 
Fertility and early embryonic development and pre- and postnatal development studies were 
conducted with alogliptin and pioglitazone alone; no additional studies were conducted with the 
combination alogliptin/pioglitazone. 
2.3.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
Alogliptin 
Systemic exposure and maximum plasma concentrations increased generally more than 
dose-proportional in rats and dogs, except at low doses (0.3 to 3 mg/kg) in dogs over which dose 
range the kinetics were linear. This was observed both after single and repeated dosing to which 
saturation of metabolic pathways may be contributing in these species. An increase in elimination 
half-life and the less-than-dose-proportional increase in the exposure to M-I (and M-II) with 
increasing alogliptin doses support the idea of saturable metabolism. In mice and monkeys, 
exposure to alogliptin was generally dose-proportional where exposure to M-I was less than 
dose-proportional. 
The formation of the pharmacologically active metabolite M-I differed across the non-clinical 
species: total 24-hour exposure to M-I was <3.2%, <34%, <85% and 13% of respective of 
alogliptin exposure in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys, respectively, with decreasing M-I contribution 
to total exposure with increasing dose. The formation of M-I is thus saturable. However, as M-I is 
pharmacologically active with a similar mode of action as alogliptin, the systemic exposures of both 
compounds need to be added up in the pre-clinical species for determining the total exposure to 
active substance in vivo. 
Pioglitazone / Alogliptin combined with pioglitazone 
In a 4 week study pioglitazone induced hypertrophy of adipocytes in the brown adipose and bone 
marrow, and hyperplasia of the adipocytes in the white adipose tissue, changes which are 
considered to be due to the pharmacological action of this compound. The changes in adipocytes, 
together with decreased ovary weights, which were also seen in rats treated with pioglitazone 
alone, were also seen in rats after the combined alogliptin-pioglitazone treatment. However, the 
magnitude and incidence was similar after the combined treatment as compared to treatment with 
piaglitazone alone, indicating that there was no toxicological interaction between these compounds. 
Treatment-related changes were observed in the heart in males, bone marrow (femur and sternum) 
in both sexes, and brown and white adipose tissue in both sexes in a 13-week study, but again no 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 40/136 
 
  
  
differences in magnitude or incidence were detected in rats treated with the combination as 
compared to rats treated with pioglitazone alone. 
No toxicological interaction between alogliptin and pioglitazone was thus detected in the 4- and 
13-week repeat dose toxicity studies performed. However, based on results obtained in an 
embryo-fetal toxicity study it is concluded that the combined administration of alogliptin and 
pioglitazone may potentiate the effects of pioglitazone alone in terms of fetal growth and most of 
visceral variation. No embryo-fetal mortality or fetal anomalies were induced in this study. 
There was an increased incidence of urinary bladder benign/malignant transitional cell tumors in 
male rats at ≥4 mg/kg/day. Effects on urinary pH, crystalluria, and cell proliferation markers 
confirmed the absence of a marked hyperplastic response over 13-week dosing periods, but trends 
for increases in urinary pH and microcrystalluria were detected. Calculi obtained from affected rats 
were composed of amorphous material likely to be spontaneously precipitated in male rat urine with 
increased pH. This may be the result of chronic irritation following formation and retention of 
urinary bladder calculi and other urinary solids in male rats treated with pioglitazone and fed 
traditional rodent diet. This hypothesis was supported in a battery of mechanistic studies, including 
a 2-year study in which pioglitazone-related effects in the urinary bladder were evaluated in male 
rats fed diet that was acidified with NH4Cl. The underlying non-genotoxic mechanism is considered 
to have no predictive significance for humans. 
2.3.4.7.  Local Tolerance  
Alogliptin 
A parenteral formulation of alogliptin in physiological saline was not hemolytic in human blood and 
did not cause any macroscopic flocculation, precipitation, or coagulation in human plasma. A 2.5 
mg/mL solution of alogliptin in physiological saline was well tolerated following IV or paravenous 
injection to rabbits. 
Pioglitazone 
No local tolerance studies were conducted with pioglitazone since the clinical formulation is an oral 
tablet. 
2.3.4.8.  Other toxicity studies 
2.3.4.8.1.  Immunotoxicity 
Alogliptin 
Non-clinical studies assessing immunotoxicity, including in vitro assessments for immune function 
and immunophenotyping of leukocyte populations, were not conducted with alogliptin. No evidence 
of drug-induced immunosuppression or enhancement were seen in the nonclinical toxicity studies 
with alogliptin. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 41/136 
 
  
  
2.3.4.8.2.  Phototoxicity 
Alogliptin 
Although alogliptin has been shown to bind to melanin in the eyes of pigmented rats, it only has 
minor or negligibly low absorbance in the ultraviolet B (UVB) range of 290 to 320 nm and the 
ultraviolet A (UVA) range of 320 nm and longer, and single doses of up to 800 mg/kg (a dose that 
exceeded the maximum-tolerated dose [MTD]) did not produce cutaneous phototoxicity in hairless 
mice. The positive control (lomefloxacin HCl) produced the expected response (erythema, edema, 
and flaking). 
2.3.4.8.3.  Dermal toxicity 
Alogliptin 
Repeated doses of up to 30 mg/kg/day administered to cynomolgus monkeys for 4 and 13 
consecutive weeks did not produce alogliptin-related dermal toxicity. No alogliptin-related lesions 
were seen histopathologically in sections of skin obtained from the thoracic region, tail, left fore- 
and hindlimbs, left auricle, nasal area, and scrotum. The NOAEL was the highest dose evaluated (30 
mg/kg/day). In the 13-week study, the mean AUC(0-24) at the NOAEL was 47 μg·hr/mL. This 
plasma concentration provides an exposure margin of approximately 27-fold higher than the clinical 
dose of 25 mg/day. 
2.3.4.8.4.  Dependence 
Alogliptin 
Abuse liability studies were not conducted with alogliptin. Although alogliptin inhibited naloxone 
binding at non-selective opioid receptors in vitro in the rat cerebral cortex, it did not show any 
binding affinity for human receptors typically associated with abuse potential. Additionally, no 
noteworthy alogliptin-related effects on general behaviour and activity were observed in rats at 
doses of up to 300 mg/kg/day for 4 consecutive weeks. 
2.3.4.8.5.  Effects on peroxisome proliferation 
Pioglitazone 
Enzymatic activities of catalase and acyl CoA oxidase, primary enzymes that index peroxisome 
proliferation, were measured for pioglitazone, clofibrate (a typical PPARα agonist), and Wy-14643 
(a potent PPARα agonist) in human derived liver cells (HepG2 and primary culture cells). 
Pioglitazone did not increase the enzymatic activity of the human hepatocyte peroxisome, and did 
not cause proliferation of peroxisomes.

2.3.4.8.6.  Echocardiographic analysis of pioglitazone-induced cardiac hypertrophy 
Pioglitazone 
Echocardiography was used to investigate the morphological and functional changes in the hearts of 
male Sprague-Dawley rats after 2, 4, and 6 weeks treatment with pioglitazone at doses of 0, 4, 16, 
and 64 mg/kg/day and male beagle dogs treated at 64 mg/kg/day for 13 weeks. The 
echocardiography findings in both species were consistent with eccentric hypertrophy resulting 
from volume overload and quite distinct from the pattern associated with the concentric 
hypertrophy resulting from thickening of the ventricular wall because of pressure overload. There 
was no functional evidence of heart failure or histological evidence of myocardial damage, 
indicating that the echocardiographic changes were reflective of an adaptive or compensatory state 
that had not progressed to overt irreversible pathology.  
2.3.4.8.7.  Insulin sensitivity, plasma volume, and cardiac hypertrophy 
Pioglitazone 
Insulin is known to promote renal sodium retention in euglycaemic rats. Increased plasma and 
blood volume was apparent at 4 hours after a single dose and at 4 and 8 hours after 7 daily doses 
of long acting insulin (0.06 IU/kg) in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Increased heart weight, 
attributable to increased left ventricular mass, was also apparent after repeated dosing of insulin. 
Pioglitazone had no effect on the in vitro rate of RNA synthesis in cultured cardiac myocytes and did 
not modify the extent of insulin-stimulated RNA synthesis in the same system. Heart weight was 
increased in male rats given 160 mg/kg/day for five weeks, but there was no change in the ratio of 
components (moisture:fat:fat free mass). There was also no change in the quantities of 
extracellular matrix components (fibronectin, laminectin) and transforming growth factor (TGF)β1 
in the hearts of rats treated at 64 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks or 160 mg/kg/day for 5 weeks. 
Increased plasma volume, with consequent hemodilution and increased heart weight was not 
apparent in male rats treated with pioglitazone (64 mg/kg/day) that were allowed access only to 
the same quantity of food as consumed by their controls. There was a slight increase in plasma 
volume, no hemodilution, and no increase in heart weight in rats with STZ-induced insulin 
deficiency even at a dose of 480 mg/kg/day. Treatment of Wistar fatty rats at 160 mg/kg/day for 12 
days normalized blood glucose and increased plasma volume with resultant hemodilution, but heart 
weight remained similar to that of untreated rats. Administration of pioglitazone (160 mg/kg/day) 
to Goto-Kakizaki rats with relatively high plasma insulin levels, induced plasma volume increase, 
hemodilution, and increased heart weight but did not normalize plasma glucose. 
Co-administration of the diuretic furosemide (30 mg/kg/day BID) did not affect the TG lowering 
activity of pioglitazone (160 mg/kg/day) but increased urinary sodium excretion and prevented or 
ameliorated the plasma volume increase, hemodilution, and cardiac enlargement induced by 
pioglitazone alone. In renal proximal convoluted tubules obtained from rats given pioglitazone (160 
mg/kg/day) for 5 to 7 days, mean values (nmol/5 µg/hr) for Na+, K+ ATPase activity were 
12.6±2.1 (controls) and 20.5±4.0 (pioglitazone, 160 mg/kg/day).

2.3.4.8.8.  Estradiol and progesterone levels 
Pioglitazone 
Decreased ovary weights were noted in the 13-week toxicity studies in rats. In an in vitro study, 
there were no pioglitazone or rosiglitazone-related effects on the production of estradiol or 
progesterone from cultured rat ovarian cells. However, a concentration of 30 µmol/L, troglitazone 
suppressed estradiol and progesterone production along with morphological changes in the ovarian 
cells. In an in vivo study, there were no pioglitazone related functional changes in estrus cycle, 
plasma estradiol and progesterone levels, estradiol: progesterone ratios, or ovary weights. The 
Cmax and AUC values at the highest dose tested were 43.29 µg/mL and 601.9 µg·hr/mL, 
respectively. 
2.3.4.8.9.  Metabolites 
Alogliptin 
When plasma profiles were evaluated, humans were primarily exposed to alogliptin and exposure to 
M-I was minimal. The plasma metabolic profiles of mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys were broadly 
similar to that of humans except that a very low level of M-II was found in dog plasma. Based on 
current guidelines, both M-I and M-II are classified as minor human metabolites, since they account 
for plasma levels of less than 10 percent of systemic exposure in humans. No extra toxicological 
studies on metabolites have been performed. 
Pioglitazone 
The single dose toxicity of pioglitazone and its pharmacologically active metabolites M-II, M-III, and 
M-IV as well as its inactive metabolite M-V were compared after IP dosing in mice (ICR strain) of 
both sexes. The severity and incidence of signs inducible with pioglitazone metabolites at 250 
mg/kg were either comparable to or not as severe as those seen with pioglitazone at the same dose. 
In the light of the findings from the rat 2-year carcinogenicity study, the mutagenic potential of the 
main metabolites (M-I, M-IV, M-V, and M-VI) found in the urine of rats were evaluated. M-I, M-IV, 
M-V and M-VI showed no mutagenic potential in S typhimurium (strains TA100, TA1535, TA98, and 
TA1537) and E coli strain WP2uvrA. 
Pioglitazone and its metabolites M-I, M-IV, M-V, and M-VI showed no structural alerts of 
carcinogenic potential using computer automated structure evaluation (CASE/MULTICASE) 
programs incorporating validated structure activity relationship (SAR) models.

2.3.4.8.10.  Studies on impurities 
Alogliptin 
Impurities measured in the alogliptin drug substance and drug product are below the Qualification 
Thresholds specified in ICH guidances Q3A and Q3B; therefore, toxicity studies with the individual 
impurities are not required. The impurity profiles of alogliptin drug substance used in the pivotal 
toxicity studies, and for alogliptin, pioglitazone, and metformin drug substances used in the pivotal 
combination toxicity studies were comparable to the impurity profiles for the drug substances used 
in the clinical formulations. 
Pioglitazone/Alogliptin in combination with pioglitazone 
Pioglitazone-related impurities, designated related Substances I, II, and III, may be present in the 
clinical formulation. Related Substances II and III were present in the material used for the pivotal 
toxicity studies and are therefore qualified at the impurity levels set in the analytical specification. 
Related substance I was not detectable in the material used for toxicity tests. Neither impurity 
elicited a mutagenic response. 
The impurity profiles of alogliptin drug substance and pioglitazone drug substance used in the 
pivotal combination toxicity studies were comparable to the impurity profiles for the drug 
substances used in the clinical formulations. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
2.3.5.1.  Phase I 
The applicant has submitted an ERA for Incresync (alogliptin/ pioglitazone fixed dose combination). 
Alogliptin is a dissociating molecule, the amine moiety is deprotonated at a pKa of 8.5. The molecule 
becomes predominantly neutral at pH values around 10 and higher. The pH metric method was 
used to determine the apparent log P vs. pH profile. Log P is 0.6 at pH 10, 11 and 12. Hence, log 
Kow of alogliptin is 0.6. This corresponds with a high water solubility (approx. 20 g/L) and a QSAR 
estimate for log Kow of 0.9 (Biobyte's ClogP).

Pioglitazone, a thiazolidinedione, is an authorised medicinal product in the European Union and has 
been marketed since 2000. The maximum daily pioglitazone dose is 45 mg and this dose was used 
in the initial calculations of the PECsurfacewater presented in Phase I, Estimation of Exposure of the 
ERA. The CHMP opinion on the ERA submitted in support of pioglitazone was that, “Overall 
pioglitazone is not considered to represent an environmental risk and no special precautions and 
safety measures are considered to be necessary”.  
Incresync is indicated to improve glycaemic control in adult patients (≥ 18 years old) with type 2 
diabetes mellitus. Incresync will be available in different strengths; however, the maximum daily 
dose of 25 mg alogliptin and 45 mg pioglitazone will not be exceeded. Incresync will be used as an 
alternative to taking alogliptin and pioglitazone as separate medications. 
The applicant has used the default Fpen of 0.01. The resulting PECsw is 0.125 µg alogliptin/L. Based 
on these results a Phase II assessment was considered appropriate for alogliptin. 
2.3.5.2.  Phase II, Tier A

Alogliptin has a Kow value below the trigger for an assessment of the potential for bioconcentration. 
A risk assessment for the soil compartment was not triggered as Koc, sludge <10,000 L/kg.  
Since >10% of alogliptin shifted to sediment in the water/sediment simulation study, a Phase IIB 
assessment was triggered. However, alogliptin is not very toxic to aquatic organisms and based on 
the PECsediment and PNECsediment values derived from the equilibrium partitioning method the 
PECsediment/PNECsediment ratio indicates alogliptin is unlikely to represent a risk to the sediment 
compartment. 
In conclusion alogliptin poses an acceptable risk to sewage treatment facilities, all standard surface 
water species and groundwater. 
Pioglitazone 
Pioglitazone, a thiazolidinedione, is an authorised medicinal product in the European Union and has 
been marketed since 2000. The maximum daily pioglitazone dose is 45 mg and this dose was used 
in the initial calculations of the PECsurfacewater presented in Phase I, Estimation of Exposure of the 
ERA. The CHMP opinion on the ERA submitted in support of pioglitazone was that, “Overall 
pioglitazone is not considered to represent an environmental risk and no special precautions and 
safety measures are considered to be necessary”.  
No increased environmental exposure of pioglitazone hydrochloride is expected based on the use 
pattern of Incresync.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
2.3.6.1.  Pharmacology  
Alogliptin 
The primary pharmacodynamics of alogliptin is well characterised. Alogliptin is shown to be a 
selective and potent DPP4-inhibitor, as compared to the first gliptins on the market, sitagliptin and 
vildagliptin. The R-isomer is the active one as the S-isomer is 1000-times less active. From the 
metabolites the M-I is also showing activity. From a pharmacodynamic point of view (DPP4 
inhibition) the duration of action is relatively long, e.g. in monkeys is lasting at least 24 hours, which 
suggests that a once-day administration in humans might be sufficient. 
Not only the primary effect DPP4 inhibition has been shown in vivo, but also the resulting 
physiological consequences such as enhancement of GLP-1, and increase of insulin, and the 
decrease of glucose after a glucose infusion, supporting the use of alogliptin as an antidiabetic drug. 
The nonclinical data do not suggest any clinically relevant effects of alogliptin on immunological 
parameters in healthy animals. 
From a safety point of view there are no concerns about the secondary pharmacology or on the 
safety pharmacology. Over a wide range of receptors and enzymes alogliptin appears to be a 
specific DPP4 inhibitor. 
Combination pharmacodynamic studies confirmed the additive and/or synergistic effects of 
concomitant treatment with alogliptin and pioglitazone, alogliptin and metformin, alogliptin and 
glibenclamide, and alogliptin and voglibose. 
Pioglitazone 
Pioglitazone is an orally active antihyperglycemic agent that acts as an insulin sensitizer. Both (+) 
and (-) pioglitazone are pharmacologically active and it has been established that epimerization, 
with attainment of equilibrium of chiral inversion, occurs in the plasma of humans and animals. 
Efficacy is apparent against hyperglycaemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia in animal 
models of obesity/hyperglycaemia that mimic aspects of T2DM. Pioglitazone may also be effective 
in reducing the onset and severity of hypertension and nephropathy that occur in hyperinsulinemic 
states. The mechanism of action has yet to be clarified but involves modulation of intracellular 
signaling mediated via nuclear PPARγ. No potential has been identified for pioglitazone to elicit 
unintended pharmacological effects in non-target tissues. 
Alogliptin in combination with pioglitazone 
Combination  pharmacodynamic  studies  showed  additive  and  synergistic  effects  of  concomitant 
treatment with alogliptin and pioglitazone.

2.3.6.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Alogliptin 
Kinetics of alogliptin was well investigated by the applicant.  
Alogliptin has two enantiomers of which the [R]-enantiomer is clinically relevant. Chiral conversion 
into the [S]-enantiomer hardly occurs. 
Alogliptin was well absorbed, with the jejunal loop being one of the major absorption sites, in the 
non-clinical species following oral dosing. Absorption into the lymphatic circulation hardly occurs. 
Oral bioavailability was moderate to high and differed across species.  
Kinetics of alogliptin was generally linear in mouse and monkeys and in dogs in the dose range 0.3 
to 3 mg/kg. In rats and at higher doses in dogs, kinetics were more than dose-proportional caused 
by saturation of metabolic pathways. In line with this, exposure to M-I displayed less than 
dose-proportional kinetics and its formation decreased with increasing alogliptin doses in all 
species.  
Alogliptin is moderately bound to plasma proteins (<60%) and widely distributed among tissues, 
including passage over the blood testes barrier and placenta, as is expected by a high volume of 
distribution. 
Metabolism: Identification of the metabolites showed that alogliptin is considered to be 
biotransformed to M-I by N-demethylation, and to M-II by acetylation of the amino group. Alogliptin 
and M-I are the major circulating components in dog plasma at dosages of 10 mg/kg and higher.  
Alogliptin is excreted in milk from lactating rats and mainly present as unchanged parent and M-I. 
Elimination of alogliptin in rats and dogs is both by hepatic clearance and renal clearance. 
Enterohepatic circulation is also possible.  
Interactions: CYPs 2D6 and 3A4/5 were inhibited in vitro by alogliptin via direct inhibition and 
metabolism-dependent inhibition, respectively, but at concentrations much higher than the clinical 
Cmax. CYP induction by alogliptin is not found in vitro or in vivo. 
In humans, alogliptin is mainly eliminated by the kidneys with some evidence of activerenal 
secretion. Therefore, the main focus of the in vitro transporter studies was in the transporters 
associated with renal clearance. 
The applicant investigated if alogliptin is an in vitro inhibitor of OAT1, OAT3 and OCT2. The study 
included both control cells and cells transfected with the specific transporter of interest. Further, the 
used probe substrates (PAH, E3S and metformin) and positive control inhibitors (probenecid, 
probenecid and quinidine) are appropriate. No clinically relevant inhibition by alogliptin (based on 
its Cmax of 0.3 µM) was seen for any of the investigated transporters. 
Alogliptin was not an in vitro inhibitor of BCRP at clinically relevant concentrations 12 µM (= 50 × 
Cmax,unbound = 50 × 0.24 µM = 12 µM) and 29.5 µM (=0.1 × dose/250 mL = 0.1 × 25 mg/250 
mL = 10 µg/mL = 29.5 µM) for liver and intestinal transporter concentrations, respectively. 
Therefore, clinically relevant interactions via BCRP inhibition by alogliptin are not expected.   
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 49/136 
 
  
  
No in vitro studies were performed with MATE and OATP. Additional clinical studies investigating the 
interaction potential of alogliptin have been performed and discussed in the clinical pharmacology 
section of this report. 
Pregnancy may have an influence on alogliptin and M-I exposure as a result of saturated alogliptin 
and M-I absorption, an increase in distribution volume and/or differences in elimination. 
Toxicokinetics in juvenile rats were not different compared to kinetics in adult rats. However, using 
healthy juvenile rats may not be representative for the human situation as it may be expected that 
T2DM is mainly present in obese children. 
Co-administration with pioglitazone or metformin did not result in significant or clinically relevant 
alterations in pharmacokinetics of alogliptin, pioglitazone or metformin. Combinations with 
sulphonylurea, insulin or triple therapies were not investigated in the non-clinical species. 
Pioglitazone 
Orally administered pioglitazone is rapidly absorbed with high bioavailability, ranging from 81% in 
monkeys and mice to 94% in dogs, has a low volume distribution and is highly protein bound. The 
T1/2 of the parent compound in plasma varies between 2 to 5 hours in animals as compared with 5 
to 6 hours in humans, but the metabolites persist for longer durations in animals, especially in dogs. 
Excretion is predominantly fecal in mice, rats, and dogs, and urinary in monkeys. Tissue uptake in 
rats is low and depletes rapidly with the highest tissue concentrations being found in liver and fat. 
Six metabolites, that are all present in the plasma of mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys have been 
identified. The routes of biotransformation include cleavage of aliphatic bonds, hydroxylation of 
methylene groups, and oxidative reactions. 
Alogliptin in combination with pioglitazone 
When alogliptin and pioglitazone are administered concomitantly, there are no direct interactions 
expected on metabolism level. The effect of co-administration of alogliptin and pioglitazone on the 
absorption kinetics of both compounds could not be assessed as no information is present about the 
involvement of transporters in absorption which is inevitable in this case as the rat model is not a 
good predictive model since the absorption and elimination kinetics are too different from those in 
humans. However, clinically there are no indications of interactions regarding absorption and 
bioavailability. Interactions on the distribution level may occur as protein displacement may lead to 
a relatively large increase in the free fraction of pioglitazone. There were however no indications of 
protein displacement in the clinical setting. Further, as in humans both drugs are mainly eliminated 
via renal clearance interactions altering the excretion kinetics of alogliptin and/or pioglitazone 
cannot be excluded. As alogliptin is also excreted via other routes in the rat, this pre-clinical model 
is not a good predictive model of the clinical situation. 
No transporter-based drug-drug interactions with pioglitazone have been reported. Pioglitazone did 
not show any inhibition towards P-gp and BCRP in vitro. A clinical drug-drug interaction study of 
pioglitazone with digoxin (as a substrate of P-gp) confirmed that pioglitazone is not an inhibitor of 
P-gp. A pivotal bioequivalence study of 12.5 mg alogliptin +15 mg pioglitazone and 25 mg alogliptin 
+45 mg pioglitazone bilayer tablets suggested that there are no drug-drug interactions between 
alogliptin and pioglitazone, consequently suggesting that there are no transporter-based drug-drug 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 50/136 
 
  
  
interactions between these 2 drugs. Based on these results, it is concluded that the occurrence of 
clinically relevant interactions for alogliptin and pioglitazone at the transporter level is very unlikely. 
2.3.6.3.  Toxicology 
Alogliptin 
Acute and repeat-dose toxicity studies showed a very low toxicity of alogliptin in mice, rats, dogs 
and monkeys, with very high safety margins of 50-200 fold. Alogliptin-related toxicity occurred in 
rats at doses of ≥  900 mg/kg/day and the findings were generally limited to the physical 
appearance of the animals and were frequently associated with decreases in body weight. 
Alogliptin-related histopathologic findings were noted in the liver, kidneys, and urinary bladder. In 
dogs, occasional and transient occurrences of reddened ears and facial swelling, without 
histopathologic changes, were observed at doses of 30 mg/kg/day and higher. Although these 
effects remain unexplained, and a treatment-related effect cannot be ruled out, the transient 
nature of these findings and the lack of adaptive changes in any organs, suggest this may be an 
allergic reaction. This is not likely to be relevant for humans. Decreased food consumption and body 
weight gain occurred at 200 mg/kg/day only in the early weeks of the 39-week study. However, 
these effects on body weight did not adversely affect clinical pathology, organ weights, or 
histopathologic results.   
Combination treatment with alogliptin and pioglitazone for up to 13 consecutive weeks did not 
produce unanticipated toxicities, and did not exacerbate any pioglitazone-related findings. 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies with alogliptin and metformin in rats for up to 13-weeks slightly 
augmented metformin-related effects on plasma lactic acid levels and increased the incidence of 
metformin-related effects in the adrenal gland, liver, heart, and submandibular gland (males), 
although it did not affect the severity of the changes. Because these differences were shown only at 
the combination of alogliptin with the high dose of 1000 mg/kg metformin, this is probably not of 
clinical relevance. 
Alogliptin is not genotoxic and not clearly carcinogenic in rodent models. The finding of a low 
magnitude of an increased incidence of malignant lymphoma in female mice, commonly found in 
mice, and the lack of a clear immunological effect at lower dose levels, is considered most likely not 
relevant for humans and the clinical situation. A low potency of alogliptin in inducing C-cell tumours 
seen in the rat carcinogenicity study is likely not clinically relevant. A minimal to mild simple 
transitional cell hyperplasia in the urinary bladder was noted in male rats at 27-fold higher than the 
intended human exposure. Since no threshold has been defined for the possible induction of cell 
hyperplasia in the urinary bladder by alogliptin and bladder cancer has been confirmed to be 
associated with pioglitazone, possibly via a similar non-genotoxic mechanism, an interaction 
between alogliptin and pioglitazone cannot be excluded. 
In reproduction and developmental toxicity studies alogliptin showed at the highest tested dose an 
increase in abnormal sperm, but fertility was not affected. The major developmental toxicity seen 
was most likely secondary to maternal toxicity. In the pre-postnatal toxicity study, effects on body 
weight and neuro-behavioral development appeared to be long-lasting. Exposure at the NOAEL 
levels was sufficiently above the clinical exposure. No juvenile toxicity was seen in rats, however in 
these studies the highest dose was at the level of the NOEL in the other studies. Embryo-foetal 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 51/136 
 
  
  
developmental toxicity studies in rats were also done with the combination of alogliptin with 
pioglitazone and alogliptin with metformin. The combination with pioglitazone only showed a slight 
potentiation of foetal growth inhibition. 
Based on the presented data the CHMP can conclude that alogliptin did not show any local tolerance 
effects, no phototoxicity, and in monkeys no dermal toxicity. 
No dedicated studies to investigate the imunotoxicity or dependence of alogliptin have been 
performed. The CHMP considers that no such studies are warranted since no imunological signals 
have been revealed in the extended non-clinical program and alogliptin did not show any binding 
affinity for human receptors typically associated with abuse potential.     
Pioglitazone 
Single oral doses of up to 2000 mg/kg pioglitazone were well tolerated without manifestations of 
toxicity in rats and mice. Repeated dosing in mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys showed plasma volume 
expansion producing hemodilution and eccentric cardiac hypertrophy, which was adaptive and 
compensatory in nature, and reversible. The NOAELs for pioglitazone derived from the 52-week 
toxicity studies were defined as the highest doses that did not produce increased heart weight, and 
were 1 mg/kg/day (rats), 1.1 mg/kg/day (male dogs), 3.4 mg/kg/day (female dogs), and 35.6 
mg/kg/day (monkeys). Safety monitoring during the clinical program has included 
echocardiography assessments that confirm the lack of adverse effects on cardiac morphology and 
function at therapeutic doses in the target patient population. 
Pioglitazone increases insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism in muscle and adipose tissue and is a 
potent hypotriglyceridemic agent. Exaggeration was manifest in rodent studies as changes in the 
size and location of fat depots and, at excessively high doses, as vacuolar and vascular changes in 
adipose tissue and changes in the bone marrow fat:cell ratio. 
Enlargement of the liver seen after administration of high doses in mice and rats was not associated 
with elevation of liver enzymes or pathology and most probably represented an adaptive response. 
A 2-fold elevation of ALT was reported for dogs treated with pioglitazone at 11.2 mg/kg/day for 3 
months or 1 year but not at 10 mg/kg/day for 6 months. There were no associated histopathological 
changes and ALT values decreased on cessation of treatment.  
Pioglitazone and its metabolites M-I, M-IV, M-V, and M-VI showed no genotoxic potential, and no 
carcinogenic potential in mice. There was an increased incidence of urinary bladder 
benign/malignant transitional cell tumors in male rats at ≥ 4 mg/kg/day. Effects on urinary pH, 
crystalluria, and cell proliferation markers confirmed the absence of a marked hyperplastic 
response over 13-week dosing periods, but trends for increases in urinary pH and microcrystalluria 
were detected. Calculi obtained from affected rats were composed of amorphous material likely to 
be spontaneously precipitated in male rat urine with increased pH. This may be the result of chronic 
irritation following formation and retention of urinary bladder calculi and other urinary solids in male 
rats treated with pioglitazone and fed traditional rodent diet. Dietary acidification significantly 
decreased but did not abolish the incidence of tumours. The presence of microcrystals exacerbated 
the hyperplastic response but was not considered to be the primary cause of hyperplastic changes. 
The relevance to humans of the tumourigenic findings in the male rat cannot be excluded. 
Pioglitazone showed embryotoxicity, increased incidences of skeletal and visceral variants, retarded

fetal growth and development, and delayed attainment of reproductive capacity. No observable 
effect doses were defined and the data should be evaluated in the context of the physiological 
changes in insulin secretion and sensitivity that occur during pregnancy. Hyperinsulinemia and 
increased insulin resistance are normal features of pregnancy ensuring that competition between 
maternal and fetal tissues for glucose and carbohydrates is biased in favor of the fetus. Thus, 
stimulation of maternal insulin sensitive tissues in healthy animals by pioglitazone simulates the 
fetal growth syndrome reported in spontaneously increased insulin sensitivity. The findings in the 
animal studies are therefore secondary to effects on the maternal organism and not indicative of 
primary selective developmental toxicity. 
Alogliptin in combination with pioglitazone 
Combination treatment with alogliptin and pioglitazone for up to 13 consecutive weeks did not 
produce unanticipated toxicities, and did not exacerbate any pioglitazone-related findings. A 
combination of alogliptin with pioglitazone only showed a slight potentiation of foetal growth 
inhibition. 
2.3.6.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Alogliptin 
The alogliptin PECsw value of 0.125 µg/L warranted a Phase II ERA assessment. 
A risk assessment for the soil compartment was not triggered as Koc, sludge <10,000 L/kg. 
However, the EMA guideline requests determination of adsorption constants in three soils and two 
sludges. The applicant submitted a study with adsorption data for two sludges only. Since a Phase 
IIB assessment is to be performed, adsorption data determined in soil (or sediment) should be 
investigated. 
Since >10% of alogliptin shifted to sediment in the water/sediment simulation study, a Phase IIB 
assessment was triggered. The applicant has performed a Phase IIB assessment using the PNECsw. 
This is not in accordance with the EMA guidance. A toxicity study with a sediment dwelling organism 
should be performed. 
In addition, the applicant only provided summarized log Kow data published in literature of low 
quality. The Q&A document (EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010) states that the log Kow should be 
determined experimentally and that a calculated value is generally not acceptable. Therefore the 
applicant is recommended to perform and submit the results of a Kow study. 
As a result of the above considerations, the available data do not allow to conclude definitively on 
the potential risk of alogliptin to the environment. The CHMP considers that the disposal instructions 
given in the PL and SmPC are appropriate. 
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following studies to be performed: 
 
an OECD 106 study determining the adsorption constants in three soils (or sediments) 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 53/136 
 
  
  
 
a toxicity study with a sediment dwelling organism (OECD 218). Although alogliptin has a 
relatively high water solubility, the applicant is recommended to perform an OECD 218 
(sediment spiked) study. This study results in mg/kg concentrations, which are needed in the 
sediment risk assessment and moreover, the OECD 308 study demonstrated that shifting of 
alogliptin to sediment occurred both rapidly and in substantial amounts. The results of the 
effect study with the sediment dwelling organism should be compared to the PECsediment.  
 
a Kow study for alogliptin 
Pioglitazone 
The CHMP opinion on the ERA submitted in support of pioglitazone was that, “Overall pioglitazone is 
not considered to represent an environmental risk and no special precautions and safety measures 
are considered to be necessary”.  
It can be concluded that no increased environmental exposure of pioglitazone hydrochloride is 
expected based on the use pattern of Incresync.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The applicant has investigated the non-clinical properties of alogliptin and pioglitazone sufficiently 
to support the indication applied for. From a non-clinical point of view the application is 
approvable. 
The CHMP recommends the following studies to be performed in order to fully investigate potential 
risk of alogliptin to the environment: 
 
 
an OECD 106 study determining the adsorption constants in three soils (or sediments) 
a toxicity study with a sediment dwelling organism (OECD 218). Although alogliptin has a 
relatively high water solubility, the applicant is recommended to perform an OECD 218 
(sediment spiked) study. This study results in mg/kg concentrations, which are needed in the 
sediment risk assessment and moreover, the OECD 308 study demonstrated that shifting of 
alogliptin to sediment occurred both rapidly and in substantial amounts. The results of the 
effect study with the sediment dwelling organism should be compared to the PECsediment.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics of alogliptin and pioglitazone FDC tablet 
Introduction 
The application concerns a FDC of alogliptin and pioglitazone. Proposed strengths are 25 mg/ 30 mg; 
25 mg/ 45 mg, 12.5 mg/ 30 mg, and 12.5 mg/ 45 mg.  
The clinical pharmacology program for alogliptin/pioglitazone comprises 1 pivotal bioavailability 
study (study 322OPI-101) and 1 pivotal food effect study (322OPI-006) and is supported by a 
drug-interaction study between alogliptin and pioglitazone (017) that was conducted as part of the 
alogliptin program. Additional supporting studies are 322OPI-005, 322OPI-007, 322OPI-102, 
322-4833/CPH-001, and 322-4833/CPH-002). 
Pharmaceutical development 
For the combination tablet, a bilayer formulation developed for the alogliptin/pioglitazone FDC, and 
6 dose strengths of alogliptin/pioglitazone BL were used: A12.5+P15, A12.5+P30, A12.5+P45, 
A25+P15, A25+P30, and A25+P45. All 6 tablet strengths are of the same mass and size and contain 
the same quantities of inactive ingredients, with the exception of mannitol, lactose, titanium dioxide, 
and yellow and red iron oxides. The diluents mannitol and lactose are varied proportionally to 
coincide with the quantity of active ingredients in their respective layers; titanium dioxide and the 
iron oxides are varied to impart different colors to each dosage strength.

Bioequivalence 
In study 322OPI-101, the pivotal BE study, the bioequivalence of alogliptin and pioglitazone when 
dosed orally as the highest proposed dosage strength (A25+P45) and lowest dosage strength that 
was developed (A12.5+P15) of the FDC product (alogliptin/pioglitazone BL), was compared with 
individual alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets. 
 
Bioequivalency assessment of A12.5+P15 Tablets 
Plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of alogliptin and serum pharmacokinetic parameters of 
pioglitazone following administration of an A12.5+P15 tablet and co-administered individual 
alogliptin 12.5 mg and pioglitazone 15 mg tablets are presented in the table below. The 90% CIs for 
the ratios of the LS means for AUC(0-tlqc), AUC(0-inf), and Cmax values of both alogliptin and 
pioglitazone were within the 80% to 125% range. Therefore, the A12.5+P15 BL tablet met the 
standards for bioequivalence to individual alogliptin 12.5 mg and pioglitazone 15 mg tablets. 
No statistically significant differences for the median Tmax values for either alogliptin or pioglitazone 
were observed between the A12.5+P15 BL tablet, and individual alogliptin 12.5 mg and 
pioglitazone 15 mg tablets.

Bioequivalence between the individual alogliptin 12.5 mg and pioglitazone 15 mg tablets and the 
A12.5+P15 BL was sufficiently shown in study 322OPI-101. Additionally, bioequivalence between 
the individual alogliptin 25 mg and pioglitazone 45 mg tablets and the A25+P45 BL was sufficiently 
shown. In all cases the 90% CI of the AUC and Cmax was within the 80%-125% range. 
Food interaction 
The effect of food on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of alogliptin and pioglitazone when dosed 
orally as the highest proposed dosage strength (A25+P45) of the proposed commercial formulation 
of the FDC product (alogliptin/pioglitazone BL) was determined in study 322OPI-006. 
Subjects who received the fed treatment were given a high-fat breakfast and were given 30 
minutes to consume it. Study drug was administered immediately after completion of the meal. 
Subjects who received the fasted treatment continued to fast for at least 4 hours after dosing. 
Plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of alogliptin and serum pharmacokinetic parameters of 
pioglitazone following administration of an A25+P45 BL tablet under fed and fasted conditions are 
presented in the table below.

The food interaction study ( 322OPI-006) with highest proposed dosage strength (A25+P45) of the 
proposed commercial formulation of the FDC product (alogliptin/pioglitazone BL) did not show any 
influence of food on the pharmacokinetics of pioglitazone and alogliptin as the 90% CIs for AUC and 
Cmax of alogliptin and of pioglitazone were within the 80% to 125%. This was supported by food 
interaction studies 322-4833/CPH-001 and 322-4833/CPH-002 in Japanese subjects. 
Interaction between alogliptin and pioglitazone 
The effect of multiple doses of pioglitazone on the multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of alogliptin and 
M-I and the effect of multiple doses of alogliptin on the multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of 
pioglitazone were assessed in a randomized, multiple-dose, open-label, 6-sequence, 3-period 
crossover study (study 017). Thirty subjects enrolled in the study, and 27 subjects completed the 
study. Subjects were randomized to 1 of 6 treatment sequences and received alogliptin 25 mg once 
daily for 12 days, pioglitazone 45 mg once daily for 12 days, and alogliptin 25 mg + pioglitazone 45 
mg once daily for 12 days. Study 017 showed that when alogliptin and pioglitazone (CYP2C8 
substrate) were co-administered, no changes in the exposures to alogliptin, pioglitazone, or 
pioglitazone metabolites were observed. 
Pharmacokinetics of alogliptin 
Introduction 
Four tablet strengths of alogliptin were developed: 3.125, 6.25, 12.5 and 25 mg. The 3.125 mg and 
the 6.25 mg dose strengths were developed for the purpose of dose reduction in patients with 
severe renal impairment, but the registration of these dose strengths is not being sought for the 
FDC alogliptin/pioglitazone. Instead the 12.5 mg dose strength is for patients with moderate renal 
impairment.

Absorption 
Alogliptin is absorbed rapidly with median time to reach Cmax (Tmax) occurring approximately 1-2 
hours after single and multiple dosing. Food does not alter the pharmacokinetics of alogliptin. The 
absolute bioavailability of alogliptin is close to 100%. Therefore, alogliptin is considered to be highly 
permeable. This is confirmed by the mass balance study in which at least 76% of the (radioactivity) 
is recovered in urine.  
Bioequivalence 
Four formulations of alogliptin were used in the clinical program. The formulation of the phase 3 
tablet that was used in the main studies and the proposed commercial tablet differed substantially. 
Bioequivalence between the alogliptin phase 3 and proposed commercial tablets was established for 
both the 12.5 and 25 mg tablets (90% CI within the 80%-125% range). Additionally the lower 
commercial tablet strengths had the same dissolution profile as the 12.5 and 25 mg tablet 
strengths.  
Distribution 
Protein binding of alogliptin was approximately 20% and was unaffected by renal impairment. 
Protein binding of M-I ranges from 12-32%. The volume of distribution (Vz) of alogliptin following a 
12.5 mg IV dose was 417 L. The Vz was greater than total body water (42 L), which indicates that 
alogliptin is well distributed into tissues. The apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) at steady state 
was 300 L at a dose of 25 mg alogliptin administered once daily for 14 days in patients with T2DM. 
Metabolism 
Alogliptin is metabolized into 2 identified minor metabolites: M-I, an N-demethylated metabolite via 
CYP2D6, and M-II, an N-acetylated metabolite. CYP3A4 may also be involved in the formation of 
other unidentified minor metabolites. Exposure to these 2 metabolites in plasma, relative to 
unchanged drug, are <1% and <6%, respectively. M-I has DPP-4 inhibitory activity similar to that 
of alogliptin; M-II has no DPP-4 inhibitory activity.  
Inter-conversion: Alogliptin exists predominantly as the (R)-enantiomer (>99%) and undergoes 
little or no enantiomeric conversion to the (S)-enantiomer in vivo. The (R)-enantiomer is the active 
moiety, and is >150-fold more active against DPP-4 than the (S) enantiomer. Therefore, 
inter-conversion has no clinical implications. 
Elimination 
The overall mean recovery of radioactivity in urine + faeces was 88.5 %. Approximately 76% of 
orally administered radioactivity was excreted in urine. This confirms that the extent of oral 
absorption in humans is high (at least 76%), and that alogliptin is moderately to highly permeable. 
Metabolism represents only a small part of the elimination of alogliptin: 95% of the radioactivity 
recovered in urine and 88% of the radioactivity recovered in faeces was alogliptin. The clearance 
(CL) of alogliptin following the 12.5 mg IV dose was 14 L/hr. CL/F ranges between 15- 20 L/hr.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality has been established across the dose range of 6.25 to 800 mg.  Steady state 
is achieved after 7 days. Accumulation was ~1.4 fold.

Variability: The intersubject variability of alogliptin ranged for the Cmax and AUC between 17-31%. 
The intrasubject variability was (<23% for Cmax and AUC values).  
Pharmacokinetics in target population: Exposure to alogliptin is similar in subjects with T2DM and 
healthy subjects.  
Special populations 
Renal impairment: Exposure to alogliptin increased with increasing severity of renal impairment. 
Peak exposure (Cmax) to alogliptin was approximately 13%, 42%, 27%, and 32% greater in 
subjects with mild, moderate, and severe  renal impairment, and subjects with ESRD, respectively, 
than in healthy subjects. Total exposure (AUC(0-inf) to alogliptin in subjects with renal impairment 
increased with decreases in renal function, and was approximately 71%, 112%, 251%, and 377% 
greater in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, and ESRD, respectively, than 
in healthy subjects. No significant differences in Tmax for any of the renal impairment groups vs the 
healthy matched controls for each group were observed. Metabolic ratios of alogliptin to M-I in 
healthy subjects and in subjects with severe renal impairment or ESRD were similar.  
Hepatic impairment: No clinical significant differences in AUC and peak Cmax exposure to alogliptin 
was observed  in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment than in healthy subjects; therefore, no 
dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Classes A and 
B). Subjects with severe hepatic impairment were not evaluated. 
Gender and weight: No clinically meaningful changes in exposure related to gender, and weight 
were observed. Therefore, no dose adjustment is required. 
Age and race: Small increases in exposure related to age and race were observed, the AUC was 
about 30% increased after multiple doses.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro results: Alogliptin did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 in vitro. Little or 
no direct inhibition was observed for CYP isoforms (CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, 
CYP3A4/5) in vitro.  
Alogliptin was not an in vitro inhibitor of BCRP, OAT1, OAT3 and OCT2 at clinically relevant 
concentrations. Therefore, clinically relevant interactions via BCRP, OAT1, OAT3 and OCT2 
inhibition by alogliptin are not expected. 
Clinical results:. Clinical alogliptin drug-drug interaction studies of digoxin (a substrate of 
P-glycoprotein [P-gp]) and cyclosporine (an inhibitor of P-gp) confirmed that alogliptin is neither a 
substrate of P-gp, nor an inhibitor of P-gp.  
It can be concluded that at clinically relevant concentrations (Cmax = 0.3 µM), alogliptin is not a 
substrate or inhibitor of P glycoprotein, OAT1, OAT3, and OCT2. 
A clinical study was performed to study the interaction potential between alogliptin and cyclosporine 
(inhibitor of OATP1B1/OATP1B3, BCRP and P-glycoprotein). No clinically relevant interactions were 
observed. In addition, OATP is involved in the transport from the systemic circulation to the liver 
based on the in vivo excretion pattern most likely not relevant. However, alogliptin is mainly 
excreted as parent compound via urine and BCRP transporters are involved in the transport to 
urine. Based on the provided clinical data it cannot be concluded that alogliptin is not an inhibitor of 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 62/136 
 
  
  
BCRP. Since, the bioavailability of alogliptin is high, no clinically relevant changes in alogliptin 
exposure are expected if alogliptin was a substrate of BCRP and it was concomitantly administered 
with a drug that is an inhibitor of BCRP. In addition, since excretion via faeces is <15%, it will be 
unlikely that an inhibitor of BCRP could have an effect on the excretion of alogliptin if alogliptin 
would be a substrate of BCRP. 
Whether alogliptin is a substrate and/or an inhibitor of OCT1, OCT2,MATE1 and MATE2 was 
investigated in a clinical study in healthy volunteers with cimetidine and metformin. Cimetidine is an 
inhibitor of OCT1, OCT2,MATE1 and MATE 2. Metformin is a substrate of OCT1, OCT2,MATE1 and 
MATE 2. No clinically relevant effects were observed on the exposure of alogliptin, cimetidine and 
metformin. Therefore, no clinically relevant drug-drug interactions are expected for alogliptin as 
either a substrate or as an inhibitor of OCT1, OCT2,MATE1 and MATE2 at current exposure levels 
(dose up to 100 mg once daily). 
Alogliptin and co-administrated drugs were dosed together in the studies. Based on the data 
presented there is no obvious effect of alogliptin on the tmax and subsequently on the gastric 
emptying of the drugs coadministrated with alogliptin.  
Effect of alogliptin on other drugs: No clinically meaningful changes in exposure to a number of 
drugs that are metabolized by CYP isozymes (pioglitazone [2C8]; glyburide, tolbutamide and 
(S)-warfarin [2C9]; midazolam, atorvastatin, ethinyl estradiol, and norethindrone [3A4]; caffeine 
and (R)-warfarin [1A2]; dextromethorphan [2D6]), transported by P-glycoprotein (Pgp) 
(fexofenadine and digoxin) or organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) (MET), or drugs that are excreted 
unchanged in urine (MET, cimetidine [an OCT2 inhibitor], and digoxin) were observed when these 
drugs were administered with alogliptin. 
Effect of other drugs on alogliptin: In addition, no clinically meaningful changes in exposure to 
alogliptin were observed when it was administered with MET, cimetidine, or digoxin (drugs that are 
excreted renally), pioglitazone (a 2C8 substrate), or atorvastatin (a 3A4 substrate); with drugs that 
inhibit CYP isozymes (ketoconazole [3A4], fluconazole [2C9], and gemfibrozil [2C8/9]); with Pgp or 
OCT2 substrates (digoxin [Pgp], MET [OCT2]) or inhibitors (cyclosporine [Pgp], cimetidine [OCT2]); 
or with a drug that is excreted primarily in the feces (voglibose [an α-glucosidase inhibitor]). In 
general, alogliptin seems to have a low potential for interactions with co-administered medicinal 
products. 
Pharmacokinetics of pioglitazone 
General pharmacokinetics (ADME) 
Pioglitazone is synthesized and used as a racemic mixture. The 2 enantiomers of pioglitazone 
interconvert in vivo; no differences were found in the pharmacologic activity of the 2 enantiomers. 
Pioglitazone is absorbed rapidly following oral administration, and peak serum concentrations of 
unchanged pioglitazone are usually reached within 2 hours after administration. Proportional 
increases in serum concentrations were observed with doses from 2 to 60 mg. Steady state is 
achieved after 4 to 7 days of dosing. Absorption is not influenced by food intake. The absolute 
bioavailability of pioglitazone is approximately 83%. Repeated dosing does not result in 
accumulation of pioglitazone or metabolites. The Vz of pioglitazone is approximately 19 L. In vitro 
CHMP assessment report

distribution of [14C]pioglitazone into human red blood cells was minimal. Pioglitazone and all active 
metabolites are extensively bound to plasma protein (>99%). 
Pioglitazone undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism by hydroxylation of aliphatic methylene 
groups. This is predominantly via CYP2C8, although other isoforms may be involved to a lesser 
degree. Renal elimination is negligible. Three of the 6 identified metabolites are active (M-II, M-III, 
and M-IV). Pioglitazone metabolites M-III (a keto derivative of pioglitazone) and M-IV (a hydroxyl 
derivative of pioglitazone) are the major circulating active metabolites in humans and are 
pharmacologically active. The overall mean recovery of radioactivity in feces + urine was 
approximately 71% (38.5% excreted in feces [55% of the recovered label] and 32.1% excreted in 
urine [45% of the recovered label]). The mean serum T1/2 of unchanged pioglitazone is 5 to 6 hours, 
and the mean serum T1/2 for its total active metabolites is 16 to 23 hours. 
Intrinsic factors 
Total exposure AUC(0 inf) to pioglitazone was approximately 20% higher in elderly (≥65 years of age) 
subjects than in young subjects (≤50 years of age). Mean AUC and Cmax values for pioglitazone and 
its metabolites were 20% to 60% higher in female subjects than in male subjects, and elimination 
rate constants and oral clearance values of pioglitazone were 25% to 40% lower. 
Overall, these small changes in the pharmacokinetics of pioglitazone are not considered clinically 
relevant, and no dose adjustments based on age or sex are required; however, pioglitazone should 
be started at the lowest available dose and increased gradually in elderly patients. 
Peak exposure (Cmax) to pioglitazone was 18% and 38% lower in subjects with moderate and severe 
renal impairment, respectively, than in healthy subjects after 10 days of once daily dosing. Total 
exposure (AUC) to pioglitazone in subjects with renal impairment decreased with decreases in renal 
function, and was 12% and 40% lower in subjects with moderate and severe renal impairment, 
respectively. The AUC of pioglitazone decreases with decreasing renal function. Despite the 
apparent lower exposure to pioglitazone, no dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild to 
severe renal impairment (CrCL >4 mL/min); however, pioglitazone was not studied in subjects on 
hemodialysis, and therefore should not be used in this population. 
Cmax values of pioglitazone in subjects with hepatic impairment were approximately 50% of those of 
healthy subjects. The volume of distribution in subjects with hepatic impairment was approximately 
55% higher and the elimination rate constant was approximately 42% slower in subjects with 
hepatic impairment. Peak and total exposure to M-III were lower in subjects with hepatic 
impairment than in healthy subjects. Peak exposure to M-IV was similar in both groups, but total 
exposure (AUC) was approximately 20% higher in subjects with hepatic impairment than in healthy 
subjects. The differences in exposure to these metabolites suggests impaired oxidative 
biotransformation of M-IV to M-III in subjects with hepatic impairment. Peak exposure to the total 
active compounds (unchanged pioglitazone + M-III + M-IV) was approximately 50% lower in 
subjects with hepatic impairment than in healthy subjects, but total exposure was similar in both 
groups. It is recommended that pioglitazone not be used in patients with any degree of hepatic 
impairment. 
Interactions

No clinically meaningful changes in exposure to a number of drugs that are metabolized by CYP 
isozymes, transported by Pgp or OCT2, or excreted unchanged in urine were observed when these 
drugs were administered with pioglitazone. 
No clinically meaningful changes in exposure to pioglitazone were observed when it was 
administered with a number of drugs that are CYP, Pgp, or OCT2 substrates; excreted unchanged in 
the urine; or CYP inhibitors or inducers, except for the following: 
Co-administration of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (an inhibitor of CYP2C8) is reported to result in a 
3-fold increase in AUC of pioglitazone. Since there is a potential for an increase in dose-related 
adverse events, a decrease in the dose of pioglitazone may be needed when gemfibrozil is 
concomitantly administered. Close monitoring of glycemic control should be considered. 
Coadministration of pioglitazone with rifampicin (an inducer of CYP2C8) is reported to result in a 
54% decrease in AUC of pioglitazone. The pioglitazone dose may need to be increased when 
rifampicin is concomitantly administered. Close monitoring of glycaemic control should be 
considered.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Pharmacodynamics of alogliptin were investigated in 7 PK/PD studies, including healthy volunteers, 
Japanese healthy volunteers, and subjects with T2DM. 
Study 001 was an ascending single dose study in healthy subjects, using doses from 25 mg to 800 
mg. 
Study CHP-001 was a single dose study including lower dosages of alogliptin (6.25 mg – 200 mg) 
and was performed in healthy Japanese subjects. 
Study 002 was a multiple dose study (25, 100 or 400 mg or placebo) in subjects with T2DM. 
Subjects received alogliptin or placebo once daily for 14 days. 
Study CHP-002 was a multiple dose study in healthy male Japanese subjects, using doses of 25 or 
50 mg alogliptin once daily for 7 days. After safety data were confirmed, subjects received alogliptin 
100 mg once daily for 7 days. 
Study 022 investigated effects of age, race and sex on single and multiple-dose 
pharmacodynamics of alogliptin. 
Study 004 and study 019 were QT/QTc studies. 
The applicant, as also being the MAH for Pioglitazone, re-submitted the pharmacodynamics studies 
of pioglitazone. Additionally, the pharmacodynamics of pioglitazone were derived from the labeling 
and scientific literature of pioglitazone. 
Mechanism of action 
Alogliptin and pioglitazone have complementary mechanisms of action.  
Alogliptin inhibits DPP-4. DPP-4 is the primary enzyme involved in the rapid degradation of the 
incretin hormones GLP-1 and GIP. GLP-1 augments glucose-induced insulin secretion, inhibits 
glucagon secretion and hepatic glucose production, and increases glucose disposal. Based on the 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 65/136 
 
  
  
mechanism of action, DPP-4 inhibition is expected to increase active GLP-1 levels in patients with 
T2DM.  
Pioglitazone is a PPAR-gamma agonist, and decreases both fasting and postprandial glucose, 
which may improve glucose metabolism and reduce insulin sensitivity in patients with T2DM. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Alogliptin 
DPP-4 inhibition 
Based on current literature, DPP-4 inhibition of ≥80% is necessary to achieve optimal glucose 
reduction. Following single-dose administration in healthy subjects, maximum inhibition (Emax) 
was >93% for all dose groups (25, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 mg), with median time to Emax 
(Tmax) of 2 to 3 hours (study 001), and >88% for all dose groups (6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 
mg), with median Tmax of 1.00 to 1.25 hours [CPH-001]. Emax and Tmax for the placebo group were 
12.2% and 6 hours, respectively, in Study 001, and 16.0% and 12.5 hours, respectively, in study 
CPH-001. Mean inhibition at 24 and 72 hours post dose (E24 and E72) ranged from 74.3% and 
47.5%, respectively, for the 25 mg group, to 97.0% and 83.0%, respectively, for the 800 mg group 
in study 001, and from 64.7% and 27.8%, respectively, for the 6.25 mg group, to 94.2% and 
74.4%, respectively, for the 200 mg group in study CPH-001. 
Following multiple-dose administration in healthy Japanese subjects [CPH-002], Emax was >95% for 
all dose groups (25, 50, and 100 mg), with Tmax of 1 hour on both Day 1 and after 7 days of 
once-daily dosing (Day 7). Emax and Tmax for the placebo group were 3.8% and 15 hours, 
respectively, on Day 1, and 4.6% and 15 hours, respectively, on Day 7. E24 ranged from 79.7% for 
the 25 mg group to 89.8% for the 100 mg group on Day 1 and from 83.5% for the 25 mg group to 
92.0% for the 100 mg group on Day 7. 
Following multiple-dose administration in subjects with T2DM (002), Emax was >93% for all dose 
groups (25, 100, and 400 mg), with Tmax of approximately 1 hour on Day 1 and 1 to 2.5 hours after 
14 days of once-daily dosing (Day 14). Emax and Tmax for the placebo group were 25.3% and 1.5 
hours, respectively, on Day 1, and 20.8% and 6.5 hours, respectively, on Day 14. E24 ranged from 
78.3% to 95.7% on Day 1 and from 81.8% to 96.7% on Day 14, and E72 ranged from 66.3% to 
81.6% for the 3 alogliptin groups on Day 14. 
NONMEM modeling that combined a 2-compartment, first order absorption pharmacokinetic model 
with an Emax pharmacodynamic model confirmed the potency of alogliptin as an inhibitor of DPP-4 
activity with a predicted Emax value of 96.2% and a predicted EC50 value of 3.73 ng/mL in healthy 
subjects in study 001 and a predicted Emax of 98.9% and a predicted EC50 value of 6.55 ng/mL in 
subjects with T2DM in study 002. The EC80 in Study 002 was around 30 ng/mL in T2DM patients. 
This concentration is in line with the 25 mg alogliptin dose. 
The effects of age, race, and sex on the single- and multiple-dose pharmacodynamics of alogliptin 
alone was investigated in a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in 
healthy male and female subjects [study 022].  Peak levels of mean DPP-4 inhibition were at least 
92% and were reached by 2 hours postdose. DPP-4 inhibition 24 hours after alogliptin 
administration was 76±4% vs 79±4% in young vs elderly, 77±4% vs 79±5% in men vs women, 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 66/136 
 
  
  
and 76±4% vs 80±4% in Black vs White. No relevant differences were observed between 
subgroups. 
GLP-1 levels 
The inhibition of DPP-4 activity by alogliptin elicited prominent increases in plasma active GLP-1 
levels in healthy subjects (this parameter was not evaluated in subjects with T2DM in the phase 1 
program), with mean changes from baseline in plasma active GLP-1 levels that were consistently 
greater in the alogliptin groups than in the placebo groups. Dose-related elevations in plasma levels 
of GLP-1 persisted through 72 hours after dosing, which is consistent with continuing DPP-4 
inhibition. As expected, the effects of alogliptin were most evident after meals when GLP-1 levels 
increased. 
Postprandial Glucose Concentrations 
Following multiple-dose administration in subjects with T2DM (study 002), statistically significant 
decreases, compared with placebo, from baseline in 4-hour postprandial glucose concentrations 
were observed following each meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) as well as when averaged across 
all 3 meals. 
Effects on QT- time 
The applicant performed one QT-study with alogliptin doses 50 mg and 400 mg. This study did not 
reveal effects of alogliptin on cardiac repolarization. Although, in the highest dose (400 mg 
alogliptin, which is 16 times the proposed dosage), the 2-sided 90% CI of the difference from 
placebo in LS mean change from baseline in QTcI interval was >10 msec at two time points (0.5 
hours and 1 hour postdose) on Day 7, the difference from placebo at these time points for alogliptin 
400 mg was 5.84 msec (90% CI, 1.44-10.24 msec) at 0.5 hour; and 6.60 msec (90% CI, 
2.50-10.70 msec) at 1 hour postdose. All other measurements were within the boundary and no 
other signals on cardiac repolarization in clinical or non-clinical studies have been found, therefore 
alogliptin is not considered to have effects on cardiac repolarization in the proposed posology (25 
mg). 
Pioglitazone 
Once daily doses of pioglitazone reduced both fasting blood glucose and postprandial glucose levels 
in subjects with T2DM. This hypoglycaemic effect was maintained throughout the day, and was 
observed as early as 2 weeks after the start of treatment. 
Multiple-dose pharmacodynamics of pioglitazone in subjects with T2DM were evaluated in 2 
studies. In these studies, the effects of once-daily doses of pioglitazone 15, 30, and 60 mg on 
fasting insulin, postprandial insulin, and C-peptide were evaluated. For fasting insulin, there were 
no significant changes from baseline for all 3 doses. Average insulin over the 12-hour postprandial 
period showed an 18% reduction from baseline with the 30 mg dose and a 20% reduction from 
baseline with the 60 mg dose, while the 15 mg dose did not produce significant changes. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Alogliptin/pioglitazone combination tablets 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 67/136 
 
  
  
In study 322OPI-101, the pivotal BE study, the bioequivalence of alogliptin and pioglitazone when 
dosed orally as the highest proposed dosage strength (A25+P45) formulation and lowest dosage 
strength that was developed (A12.5+P15) of the proposed commercial FDC product 
(alogliptin/pioglitazone BL), was shown with individual alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets.  
The applicant used a bracketing approach by making only an evaluation of the highest and lowest 
dose strengths in humans in vivo, as was previously advised by the scientific advice.  
The applicant used as reference tablet in the pivotal bioequivalence study of the FDC the phase 3 
formulation of alogliptin, which had been shown in study 027 of the original alogliptin dossier to be 
bioequivalent to the proposed commercial formulation of alogliptin. The applicant showed 
sufficiently that the risk of drifting is minimal. In addition, since alogliptin has a bioavailability of 
near 100% (Study 103), exhibits high solubility, and has very rapid in vitro dissolution 
characteristics, it may be considered to be a BCS class 1 substance, therefore the approach of the 
applicant is acceptable. 
The applicant included pharmacodynamic studies concerning piogitazone, which already have been 
assessed by the CHMP in the MAA for pioglitazone (Actos) preceding the authorization in 2000. No 
specific pharmacodynamic studies were performed with the combination of alogliptin and 
pioglitazone or the FDC. This is acceptable, since it is not mandatory and phase 3 studies with the 
combination were included (see efficacy section). 
Alogliptin 
Several studies were performed to characterize the PK and PD of alogliptin. 
The Pharmacokinetics of alogliptin is fairly uncomplicated. It is absorbed fast and almost 
completely, the maximum plasma concentration is reached after 1-2 hours after administration. 
Bioequivalence between the alogliptin phase 3 and proposed commercial tablets was established for 
both the 12.5 and 25 mg tablets (90% CI within the 80%-125% range). Additionally the lower 
commercial tablet strengths had the same dissolution profile as the 12.5 and 25 mg tablet 
strengths. As all tablet strengths including the lower strengths were used in the pharmacokinetics 
studies and dose proportionality was sufficiently shown, it is agreed that the conclusion on 
bioequivalence can be extended to the lower 6.25 and 3.125 mg tablet strengths. 
Alogliptin is mainly excreted unchanged via the urine (75%), two minor metabolites were identified: 
M-I, and M-II. The Exposure to these 2 metabolites are <1% and <6%.  M-I has DPP-4 inhibitory 
activity similar to that of alogliptin; M-II has no DPP-4 inhibitory activity. Therefore, small to 
moderate changes in exposure to these metabolites are not considered to be clinically relevant. 
CYP2D6 is involved in the formation of these two metabolites and CYP3A4 may also be involved in 
the formation of other unidentified minor metabolites. 
In the PD studies, alogliptin showed a dose-dependent reduction in DPP-4 levels in both healthy and 
T2DM patients. Multiple-dose of 25 mg alogliptin treatment caused a ≥ 80% reduction in DPP-4 
levels, which is considered necessary to achieve optimal glucose reduction. However, it is not 
known if a lower dose of 12.5 mg could cause a comparable clinically effect. Therefore, both 12.5 
mg and 25 mg dose have been used in the clinical trials.

The inhibition of DPP-4 activity by alogliptin elicited prominent increases in plasma active GLP-1 
levels in healthy subjects, and significant decreases in 4-hour post prandial glucose concentrations 
in T2DM subjects. 
In healthy Japanese subjects, the levels of active GLP-1 appear lower than those observed in the 
healthy volunteers. However, since these differences are observed in the alogliptin groups and the 
placebo groups, the differences are unlikely to be related to racial differences, but to aspects of the 
assay, which was conducted with different batches of the kit and in different laboratories. 
Subjects with severe hepatic impairment were not evaluated; therefore alogliptin is not 
recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment (Class C). The FDC 
alogliptin/pioglitazone cannot be used in patients with hepatic impairment based on the 
pioglitazone component, which is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment as stated in 
sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 of the SmPC. Increased exposure to alogliptin is observed in patients with 
renal impairment, and therefore the applicant proposes dose reduction in these patients. However, 
the applicant did not apply for an indication for the FDC in patients with severe renal impairment or 
ESRD. 
The PK-study 022 showed that gender did not influence the AUC or other PK-parameters. Small 
increases in exposure related to age and race were observed, the AUC was about 30% increased 
after multiple doses of alogliptin. These changes were not considered clinically relevant since age or 
race had no effect on alogliptin inhibition of DPP-4 activity.However, the CHMP had concerns 
regarding the quality of the population PK analysis in order to be used for description of the effect 
of weight on alogliptin exposure, and requested during the procedure several updated data sets to 
assess the influence of body weight.  
The applicant provided an updated POP-PK analysis which included pooled data from studies 002, 
006, and 008 for a detailed evaluation of the effects of renal function (measured by creatinine 
clearance [CRCL]) and weight in kilograms [WTKG]) on the PK and exposure of alogliptin.  The 
applicant provided numerical (Bootstrap) and visual (pcVPC) diagnostics thus allowing assessment 
of the updated model. The effect of body weight in the view of the CHMP was thus well estimated 
and the model now sufficiently robust with high convergence rate and precise parameter estimates. 
The conclusion regarding the clinically insignificant effect of body weight on exposure to alogliptin 
was therefore accepted and is reflected in the text regarding the influence of body weight in SmpC 
section 5.2. 
The alogliptin potential for interactions appears to be low; it has been studied in vivo with all 
relevant antidiabetic drugs. Most possibly relevant CYP enzymes have been evaluated. The 
applicant investigated if alogliptin is an in vitro inhibitor of OAT1, OAT3 and OCT2. The study 
included both control cells and cells transfected with the specific transporter of interest. Further, the 
used probe substrates (PAH, E3S and metformin) and positive control inhibitors (probenecid, 
probenecid and quinidine) are appropriate. No clinically relevant inhibition by alogliptin (based on 
its Cmax of 0.3 µM) was seen for any of the investigated transporters.. Alogliptin and 
co-administrated drugs were dosed together in the studies. Based on the data presented there is no 
obvious effect of alogliptin on the tmax and subsequently on the gastric emptying of the drugs 
coadministrated with alogliptin.  
The ability of alogliptin to inhibit CYP2B6 (as measured by efavirenz 8-hydroxylation rates) was 
investigated with a pool of 16 individual human liver microsomal samples at concentrations ranging 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 69/136 
 
  
  
from 0.1 to 100 μmol/L. The study setup of the submitted study to investigate if alogliptin is an in 
vitro inhibitor of CYP2B6 is acceptable. The marker CYP2B6 reaction efavirenz 8-hydroxylation and 
the CYP2B6 positive control inhibitors orphenadrine (750 uM) and phencyclidine (30 uM) is 
appropriate. No inhibition of CYP2B6 activity by alogliptin was seen up to 100 µM and subsequently 
the risk for alogliptin inhibition of CYP2B6 at clinically relevant concentrations is 
unlikely.Information that alogliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP2B6 in vitro is included in section 5.2 of 
the SmPC.   
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The applicant performed several clinical pharmacology studies to show the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics of alogliptin and pioglitazone, separately and combined. Additionally, specific 
for the combination product one pivotal bioavailability study and one pivotal food effect studies 
were submitted. The pharmacodynamic study results of pioglitazone were in line with the already 
published literature. 
Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were sufficiently investigated in the view of the CHMP. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
An overview of the performed studies is shown in the two tables below. Table 6 shows studies 
relevant for the Fixed Dose Combination; in table 7 other trials performed with alogliptin are 
described. 
In support of this FDC application, five studies have been submitted (see table 2): study 009 and 
study 322OPI-004 were main studies: 322OPI-001 and 322OPI-002 were submitted as supportive 
trials; study 010 is included to show the efficacy and safety of alogliptin as monotherapy. 
The total clinical development program for alogliptin (Vipidia) examined the use of alogliptin in 
monotherapy and in combination use with 4 major classes of antidiabetic agents: (1) MET, (2) SU, 
(3) TZD, and (4) insulin. The efficacy of alogliptin has been evaluated in 15 studies: 1 phase 2 
dose-ranging study, 7 main phase 3 studies and 7 supportive phase 3 studies (tables 2 and 6).

(a) Studies were, at the time of evaluation of this application, ongoing studies. 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
No separate dose response studies were performed for the FDC. Dose selection for the FDC was 
based on alogliptin dose-range studies and approved doses of pioglitazone. 
Alogliptin 
Results from the phase 1 studies suggested a dose range between 6.25 and 100 mg should be 
tested to determine optimal dosage in confirmatory clinical studies. Hence, that dose range was 
used in the phase 2 dose-ranging study (study 003). Study 003 assessed the efficacy, safety, and 
tolerability of alogliptin 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 mg over 12 weeks compared with placebo in 
265 subjects with T2DM, 26 to 75 years of age, inclusive, who were either receiving no treatment 
(i.e. either newly diagnosed or experiencing inadequate glycaemic control with diet and exercise 
alone) or were being treated with an SU, MET, or a combination of SU and MET, but were 
experiencing inadequate glycaemic control.  
Statistically significant and clinically relevant reductions in HbA1c were observed at alogliptin doses 
of ≥12.5 mg and in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) at doses of ≥25 mg, with no additional HbA1c 
benefit seen at doses >25 mg (see table below). HbA1c levels were not significantly reduced with 
alogliptin 6.25 mg, which is likely due to lack of optimal DPP-4 inhibition.

These HbA1c and FPG results were the basis for selecting alogliptin 12.5 and 25 mg for evaluation 
in the phase 3 clinical program. Both doses were chosen for further evaluation because, at that 
point in time, only limited comparative safety data were available.  
Total exposure to alogliptin in subjects with moderate and severe renal impairment/ESRD increased 
approximately 2- and 4-fold, respectively, compared with healthy matched control subjects. Dose 
reductions proportional to the increases in exposure seen in study 006 were used in study 402, in

which a dose of alogliptin 25 mg was assigned to T2DM subjects with normal renal function and 
those with mild renal impairment, alogliptin 12.5 mg to T2DM subjects with moderate renal 
impairment, and alogliptin 6.25 mg to T2DM subjects with severe renal impairment/ESRD. 
Pioglitazone 
The strengths of the pioglitazone component were mainly based on the approved dose range of 
pioglitazone (15 to 45 mg). In Europe, the treatment paradigm for antidiabetic therapy requires 
that a dose of antidiabetic medication be maximized before another antidiabetic medication is 
added. As such, in the 2 main studies for the alogliptin/pioglitazone FDC, alogliptin was added on to 
background pioglitazone therapy, which was usually pioglitazone 30 or 45 mg. Therefore, both 
higher pioglitazone dose strengths (ie, 30 and 45 mg) are being proposed for the FDC, and approval 
was not being sought for a FDC formulation containing alogliptin in combination with pioglitazone 
15 mg. This was found to be acceptable by CHMP. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Methods and study design 
Study 009 was a 26-week, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 
T2DM on pioglitazone or rosiglitazone, with or without metformin or SU. Both 12.5 mg and 25 mg 
alogliptin was used as active study compounds. Adult subjects with T2DM were included who failed 
(HbA1c between 7.0% and 10.0%) to achieve adequate glycaemic control on background 
antidiabetic medication consisting of TZD with or without metformin or SU. Subjects underwent a 
4-week Run-in/Stabilization Phase during which they were stabilized on a dose of 30 or 45 mg 
pioglitazone (or MTD), ≥1500 mg MET (or maximum tolerated dose [MTD]). The specific indication 
of add-on treatment to TZD with SU is not being sought in Europe. 
Change from baseline in HbA1c was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints include changes in 
other measures of glycaemic control, including clinical response rates, FPG, the incidence of marked 
hyperglycaemia, and the incidence of hyperglycaemic rescue.  
The primary analysis was performed for the full analysis set (FAS) using an analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) model with last observation carried forward (LOCF) values. The primary model included 
in all studies, study treatment and geographic region as class variables and baseline HbA1c as 
covariate. Additional study-specific covariates or factors were included in the primary analysis 
model. For the primary analysis, the alogliptin 25 dose was compared with placebo at the 2-sided 
0.05 significance level using a contrast derived from the primary model. Only if this test was 
statistically significant, the alogliptin 12.5 dose was to be evaluated in a similar fashion. 
Study 322OPI-004 was a 52 week active controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy of 
alogliptin 25 mg as triple therapy (add-on to pioglitazone 30 mg and MET), in which efficacy was 
compared with uptitration of pioglitazone, in subjects on pioglitazone 30 mg and MET. Adult 
subjects with T2DM were included who failed (HbA1c between 7.0% and 10.0%) to achieve 
adequate glycaemic control on background antidiabetic medication consisting of pioglitazone 30 mg 
with metformin (≥1500 mg (or MTD). The primary efficacy variable was change from baseline in 
HbA1c at Weeks 26 and 52 in the PPS using the LOCF method for subjects who were rescued or who 
prematurely discontinued from the study. The primary model included study treatment, study 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 74/136 
 
  
  
schedule, and geographic region as class variables, and baseline MET dose and baseline HbA1c as 
covariates. The primary analysis was a non-inferiority assessment (non-inferiority margin of 0.3%) 
at Week 26 followed by an assessment at Week 52. Both analyses (at Weeks 26 and 52) were 
performed at the 1-sided 0.025 significance level. The Week 26 analysis was a pre-planned interim 
analysis; the Week 52 analysis was considered the primary endpoint. 
Study 010 was a monotherapy trial. It was a 26-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind 
placebo controlled study in T2DM patients were included who failed treatment with diet and exercise 
(HbA1c 7-10%). Subjects were treated with alogliptin 12.5 or 25 mg or placebo. Change from 
baseline in HbA1c was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints include changes in other 
measures of glycaemic control, including clinical response rates, FPG, the incidence of marked 
hyperglycaemia, and the incidence of hyperglycaemic rescue. 
Study Participants  
Studies 009, 322OPI-004 and 010 
Subject demographics and baseline characteristics of studies 009, 010 and 322OPI-004 are shown 
in the table below.  
A total of 1296 subjects were randomized into the 2 main phase 3 studies 009 and study 
322OPI-004 and received at least 1 dose of study drug. No meaningful differences across treatment 
groups were observed for any demographic or baseline characteristic with respect, specifically, to 
sex, age, race, and body mass index (BMI). Mean age in both studies was 55 years. In these 2 
studies, 229 (18%) randomized subjects were elderly (≥65 years), with 24 subjects (2%) at least 
75 years of age. The majority (67%) of all randomized subjects were White. Mean BMI for all 
randomized subjects was 32 in Study 322OPI-004 and 33 in study 009. Overall, the characteristics 
of the study population were consistent with the general T2DM population in the EU. Duration of 
T2DM was 7.16 years in Study 322OPI-004 and 7.58 years in study 009. 
Study 010 included a total of 329 subjects were randomised. Overall, 53.2% of subjects were men. 
Mean age for all randomized subjects was 53.4 years. The majority of subjects were <65 years of 
age (83.3%) and White (66.9%). Mean BMI for all randomized subjects was 32.02 and mean 
duration of T2DM was 3.22 years. Mean HbA1c values at baseline were similar among the placebo, 
A12.5, and A25 groups (8.03%, 7.91%, and 7.91%, respectively). Overall, no meaningful

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary outcome parameters: 
Glycosylated Haemoglobin (HbA1c): 
In study 009, subjects received alogliptin or placebo as add-on therapy to TZD with or without MET 
or SU. Statistically significant LS mean differences from placebo were seen for both the alogliptin 
12.5 mg and 25 mg groups (figure below). Reductions (compared with placebo) were seen 
regardless of pioglitazone dose or whether the subject was receiving pioglitazone with or without SU 
or MET. Of the 493 subjects randomized in the study, 112 (23%) received alogliptin (89 subjects) 
or placebo (23 subjects) as add-on therapy to pioglitazone alone. Although the number of subjects 
receiving add-on therapy to TZD alone is somewhat limited in this study, the overall response is 
clinically relevant. In the supportive initial combination study 322OPI-002, the combination of 
alogliptin 25 mg+pioglitazone 30 mg showed a decrease in HbA1c of 1.71%. In study 009, 277 
subjects (56%) received alogliptin (221 subjects) or placebo (56 subjects) as add-on therapy to 
TZD plus MET. The positive clinical response of add-on therapy to TZD and MET is confirmed in 
study 322OPI-004, as described below.

Study 009 (add-on to TZD): Change from baseline in LS Mean of HbA1c 
In the long-term, active-controlled study 322OPI-004, greater LS mean reductions from baseline 
in HbA1c were observed in the alogliptin group than in the comparator group at Weeks 26 and 52, 
and alogliptin efficacy was shown to be sustained for up to 52 weeks. Non-inferiority and superiority 
of alogliptin 25 mg was demonstrated vs titration of pioglitazone from 30 to 45 mg in subjects on a 
background treatment of MET and pioglitazone 30 mg (see figure below).

LS Mean (SE) Changes From baseline in HbA1c (%) (LOCF, PPS), study 
In study 010, at Week 26, the LS mean changes from baseline in HbA1c were -0.02%, -0.56%, 
and -0.59% for the placebo, A12.5, and A25 groups, respectively. LS mean differences from 
placebo were -0.54% (p<0.001) and -0.57% (p0.001) for the A12.5 and A25 groups, respectively. 
Results for the primary efficacy endpoint are presented in the table below. Subjects in both 
alogliptin dose groups (A12.5 and A25) achieved statistically significant mean decreases in HbA1c 
levels compared with the placebo group at every time point.

Secondary outcome parameters: 
Secondary endpoints include clinical response, FPG, changes body weight and lipid parameters. 
Clinical Response  
Clinical response was evaluated by assessing the percentage of subjects who achieved HbA1c levels 
of 7.0% at Week 26, following treatment in the respective study. In study 009, a higher 
percentage of subjects in both alogliptin groups achieved these clinical response endpoints at 
Week 26 than in the placebo group (44.2%, 49.2% and 34.0% in the A12.5, A25 and placebo 
groups respectively). Differences from the placebo group were statistically significant (p≤0.016). In 
study 322OPI-004, significantly higher percentages of subjects in the MET+A25+P30 group 
(33.2%) achieved the HbA1c clinical response endpoint at Week 52 compared with the MET+P45 
group (21.3%; p<0.001).  
In study 010 the percentage of subjects who achieved an HbA1c level of ≤7.0% by Week 26 was 
also statistically significantly higher in the A12.5 and A25 groups (47.4% [p=0.001] and 44.3% 
[p=0.008], respectively) than in the placebo group (23.4%). 
Change from baseline in FPG  
In study 009, LS mean decreases in FPG observed in alogliptin-treated subjects were statistically 
significant compared with the placebo group for the alogliptin 25 mg group and alogliptin 12.5 mg 
group (-1.09, -1.10 and -0.32 in the A12.5, A25 and placebo group respectively). In Study 
322OPI-004, the LS mean changes from baseline at Week 52 were -0.81 and -0.21 mmol/L in the 
MET+A25+P30 and MET+P45 groups, respectively (p<0.001). Additionally, LS mean decreases 
from baseline in FPG were statistically significant for the MET+A25+P30 group at all time points 
through Week 52 compared with the MET+P45 group (p<0.01). 
In study 010, at Week 26, subjects in the A12.5 and A25 groups achieved statistically significant LS 
mean decreases in FPG (-0.57 and -0.91 mmol/L, respectively) compared with subjects in the 
placebo group (+0.63 mmol/L) (p<0.001). 
Body weight and serum lipids 
In study 009, results suggest that treatment with alogliptin is weight neutral. Following 26 weeks of 
treatment, there were no meaningful differences in LS mean changes in body weight between the 
placebo group (1.04 kg) and A12.5 and A25 groups (1.46 and 1.09 kg, respectively). In study 
322OPI-004, mean changes in body weight were consistent with the concomitant medication (ie, 
pioglitazone) administered. At Week 52, LS mean increases in body weight were observed in both 
treatment groups (1.10 kg and 1.60 kg in the MET+A25+P30 and MET+P45 groups, respectively). 
These increases were not considered clinically meaningful and there was no statistically significant 
difference between treatment groups. Also in study 010, there were no meaningful differences in LS 
mean changes in body weight between the placebo group (0.18 kg) and A12.5 and A25 groups 
(-0.09 and  0.22 kg, respectively). 
Overall, changes from baseline in lipid parameters were similar in the alogliptin and placebo groups 
suggesting that treatment with alogliptin has a neutral effect on lipid parameters.

Primary Endpoint Analysis: An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model using 
last observation carried forward (LOCF) values was performed, with study treatment 
and geographic region as class variables and duration of T2DM and baseline HbA1c 
as continuous covariates. The A25 dose was compared with placebo at the 2-sided 
0.05 significance level using a contrast derived from the primary model. If this test 
result was statistically significant, the A12.5 dose was evaluated in a similar fashion.  
Full analysis set (FAS), which was defined as all randomized subjects who received 
at least 1 dose of double-blind study drug, had a baseline value, and had at least one

Primary Endpoint Analysis: An ANCOVA model using LOCF values was 
performed, with study treatment, geographic region, and study schedule (see notes 
below) as class variables and baseline metformin dose and baseline HbA1c as 
continuous covariates. At Week 26, the A25+P30 dose was compared with P45 at the 
1-sided 0.025 significance level using a noninferiority margin of 0.3%. If this test 
result was statistically significant, Week 52 was evaluated in a similar fashion.  
Per protocol set, which was defined as all FAS subjects (ie, those randomized who 
received at least 1 dose of double-blind study drug, had a baseline value, and had at 
least one post baseline value) who had no major protocol violations.

Summary of Efficacy for Study 322OPI-004 (continued) 
Title: A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind Study to Determine the Efficacy and Safety of the Addition of 
SYR-322 25 mg versus Dose Titration from 30 mg to 45 mg of ACTOS® Pioglitazone HCl in Subjects with 
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Who Have Inadequate Control on a Combination of Metformin and 30 mg of 
Pioglitazone HCl Therapy 
Study identifier  01-06-TL-322OPI-004 (also referred to as Study 322OPI-004) 
Subjects entered the Screening Period via 1 of 2 study schedules:  
- Schedule A for subjects with HbA1c of 7.0% to 10.0% while on a stable (2 months) 
regimen of pioglitazone 30 mg with metformin ≥1500 mg or MTD. These subjects 
directly entered the run-in phase. 
- Schedule B for subjects with HbA1c ≥7.5% while on metformin with other oral 
antidiabetic agent. These subjects entered a 12-week switching period, discontinued 
their antidiabetic treatment, were switched to pioglitazone 30 mg with metformin 
≥1500 mg or MTD, and had to achieve HbA1c of 7.0% to 10.0% before entering the 
run-in phase. 
Key Secondary Endpoint Analysis: Same as primary model except with baseline 
FPG value in place of HbA1c as covariate and at the 0.05 2-sided significance level 
for statistical difference rather than for non-inferiority.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) and in special 
populations 
No specific subpopulation investigations have been conducted with alogliptin/pioglitazone; 
however, this FDC product is expected to have a similar efficacy profile as the individual 
components, in view of the evidence provided in the bioequivalence study with the FDC and the 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies with the individual components.  
Evaluation of change from baseline in HbA1c was conducted for subgroups defined by sex, age 
group (<65, ≥65, ≥75 years), race, and baseline BMI (<30 and ≥30). These subgroup analyses 
were for exploratory purposes and no formal statistical hypothesis testing was performed. The 
analyses demonstrated that regardless of age, sex, race, and baseline BMI, alogliptin continued to 
have clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c compared with placebo in study 009 and study 
322OPI-004. This was also seen in the supportive studies 322OPI-001 and 322OPI-002. 
Elderly  
A total of 559 subjects ≥65 years (16%) were enrolled in the 2 main and 2 supporting studies 
supporting this application for alogliptin/pioglitazone. Of these subjects, 50 were ≥75 years 
(1%). A total of 326 subjects ≥65 years (17%) and 25 subjects ≥75 years of age (1%) were treated 
with alogliptin/pioglitazone specifically. 
In study 009, clinically relevant placebo-adjusted HbA1c mean changes from baseline were 
observed for both alogliptin doses in both age categories (<65 and ≥65 years), with no clinically 
meaningful differences observed, although the numbers were small (n=71). 
Table 15 
(study 009) 
Change From baseline in Mean HbA1c (%) at Week 26 by Age (LOCF, FAS) 
In a pooled analysis for alogliptin clinically relevant placebo-adjusted HbA1c mean changes from 
baseline were observed for both alogliptin doses ( 0.44% and -0.59% for 12.5 mg; -0.51% and  
0.67% for 25 mg) in both age categories (<65 and ≥ 65 years, respectively), with no clinically 
meaningful differences observed. There was a relatively small number of patients aged ≥ 75 years. 
Nevertheless, in these patients, placebo-adjusted HbA1c changes were -0.42 % for alogliptin 12.5 
mg (n=26) and -0.48% for alogliptin 25 mg (n=20). Overall, these results are supportive of the 
findings of the primary analyses from each of the individual main phase 3 studies. 
In the long-term study 322OPI-004, clinically relevant HbA1c reductions were observed at Week 
52 for elderly (≥65 years) subjects who received alogliptin 25 mg added to pioglitazone + 
MET, in keeping with the overall results (-0.97%; n=50).

Subjects with Impaired Renal Function 
Dose recommendations for the FDC alogliptin/pioglitazone in patients with renal impairment are 
based on monotherapy alogliptin and pioglitazone data. Pharmacokinetic data generated in 
subjects with T2DM demonstrated increased systemic exposure with decreasing renal function (see 
pharmacokinetic section). These results confirm the pharmacokinetic profile observed in phase 1 
study subjects with mild or moderate renal impairment. A dose reduction is therefore recommended 
for patients with moderate impairment so that exposure to alogliptin in these patients is similar to 
that of patients with normal renal function.  
As stated in the SmPC for pioglitazone, no dose adjustment is required in patients with renal 
impairment. However, it also states that no information is available from dialyzed patients and, 
therefore, pioglitazone should not be used in such patients. 
Therefore, the FDC alogliptin/pioglitazone is not recommended for patients with severe renal 
impairment or ESRD, as described in the SmPC sections 4.2 and 4.4. 
Subjects with hepatic impairment 
Dose recommendations for patients with hepatic impairment are based on monotherapy alogliptin 
and pioglitazone data: as a precautionary measure consistent with the pioglitazone label, the 
administration of alogliptin/pioglitazone is contraindicated (SmPC) in patients with hepatic 
impairment. 
Longer term studies 
The persistence of efficacy of combination treatment including alogliptin has been demonstrated for 
up to 52 weeks in study 322OPI-004, showing the durability of the glucose-lowering effect as 
assessed by HbA1c reduction (see above). Significantly greater decreases in HbA1c were observed 
in the MET+A25+P30 treatment group vs the MET+P45 treatment group (p<0.001 at all time 
points). At Week 52, the LS mean difference between treatment groups indicated non-inferiority of 
MET+A25+P30 to MET+P45. Furthermore, results at Week 52 also indicated statistical superiority 
of the MET+A25+P30 group to the MET+P45 group. 
Supportive studies 
Study 322OPI-001 evaluated 12 treatment groups (in addition to background MET) over a 26 week 
period: placebo+placebo, or pioglitazone 15 mg, 30 mg, or 45 mg once daily; alogliptin 12.5 
mg+placebo or pioglitazone 15 mg, 30 mg, or 45 mg once daily; alogliptin 25 mg+placebo or 
pioglitazone 15 mg, 30 mg, or 45 mg once daily. A total of 1554 subjects were randomized to 
receive treatment.  
In subjects who were experiencing inadequate glycaemic control with MET alone (mean baseline 
HbA1c values of approximately 8.5%), there were statistically significant (p≤0.001) decreases from 
baseline in the LS mean HbA1c levels at Week 26 in subjects treated in the alogliptin 12.5 
mg+pioglitazone and alogliptin 25 mg+pioglitazone groups compared with pioglitazone alone (LS 
mean changes from baseline in HbA1c were  0.89%,  1.43%, and -1.42% in the pioglitazone alone, 
alogliptin 12.5 mg+pioglitazone, and alogliptin 25 mg+pioglitazone groups, respectively). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 87/136 
 
  
  
A dose response for alogliptin add-on to MET was evident, in which alogliptin 25 mg showed a 
greater reduction in HbA1c compared with alogliptin 12.5 mg (-0.90% vs -0.64%), in a setting with 
a higher mean baseline HbA1c. 
Study 322OPI-002 was a 26-week initial combination (alogliptin+pioglitazone) study. Subjects 
were randomized to receive alogliptin 12.5 mg+pioglitazone 30 mg once daily, alogliptin 25 
mg+pioglitazone 30 mg once daily, alogliptin 25 mg+placebo once daily, or pioglitazone 30 
mg+placebo once daily. A total of 655 subjects were randomized to receive treatment.  
Both of the alogliptin 12.5 mg+pioglitazone 30 mg and alogliptin 25 mg+pioglitazone 30 mg groups 
demonstrated better efficacy with respect to HbA1c reductions vs pioglitazone 30 mg alone. 
Overall, the data collected in these supporting studies reflect the conclusions made from the results 
seen in the main placebo- and active-controlled studies. 
Another supportive study is study 402, which is an at the time of the evaluation of this application 
ongoing long-term CV outcomes study in subjects with T2DM and recent (within 15 to 90 days) 
acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Subjects were included with varying degrees of renal impairment. 
The primary endpoint in this study is the major adverse CV event (MACE) composite of CV death, 
nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), and nonfatal stroke. Study 012 was a long-term (4 years), 
open-label extension study of alogliptin (12.5 or 25 mg) once daily in subjects enrolled in 7 of the 
controlled phase 3 studies. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
In the total alogliptin program, an extensive number of randomized trials has been performed, 
including trials with placebo and active comparators, and in combination with several other 
antidiabetic agents. For this FDC two main studies, two supportive studies and the monotherapy 
study 010 are relevant. 
Dose selection 
In dose finding studies, no additional efficacy was observed at alogliptin doses greater than 
12.5 mg. However, the inclusion of alogliptin 12.5 mg and 25 mg in the phase 3 trials is reasonable. 
In most pivotal studies, the difference between alogliptin 12.5 mg and 25 mg was not large, but the 
efficacy for alogliptin 25 mg was somewhat more pronounced. Therefore, the choice for alogliptin 
25 mg was acceptable. 
No specific dose-response studies for pioglitazone were performed. However, the clinical phase 3 
studies showed efficacy of both the 30 mg and 45 mg pioglitazone dose. Furthermore, the proposed 
dose for the pioglitazone component in the FDC is in line with the currently approved dose of 
pioglitazone and also in line with clinical practice. Therefore, the proposed dose of 30 mg and 45 mg 
pioglitazone in the FDC tablet was acceptable. 
Pivotal trials 
In each of the studies, no meaningful differences across treatment groups were observed for any 
demographic or baseline characteristic. Change from baseline in HbA1c was the primary endpoint. 
For the combination with TZD (with or without metformin), pivotal study 009 is submitted. In 
this study, alogliptin is compared to placebo in patients treated with TZD (with or without 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 88/136 
 
  
  
metformin). In addition, study 322OPI-004 is submitted. This is a 52 week active controlled study 
designed to evaluate the efficacy of alogliptin as triple therapy (add-on to pioglitazone 30 mg 
and MET), in which efficacy was compared with uptitration of pioglitazone, in subjects on 
pioglitazone 30 mg and MET. The combination with TZD and SU is not requested. Nevertheless, a 
small number of patients treated with alogliptin in combination with TZD and SU were investigated 
in pivotal study 009. For the combination with TZD (with or without metformin), alogliptin 25 mg 
was associated with a reduction in HbA1c of -0.61% (95% CI -0.80 to -0.41) after 26 weeks in 
comparison to placebo. Treatment effects were clinically relevant for alogliptin 25 mg in 
combination with TZD only (-0.49%) and in combination with TZD and metformin (-0.72%). In 
addition, in study 322OPI-004, the effects of adding alogliptin 25 mg were non-inferior compared 
with increasing the dose of pioglitazone from 30 to 45 mg. A monotherapy study (010) comparing 
alogliptin with placebo is submitted. Compared to placebo, alogliptin 25 mg was associated with a 
reduction in HbA1c of -0.57% (-0.80 to -0.35). 
Renal impairment 
Renal dose adjustment recommendations of alogliptin 12.5 mg for patients with moderate renal 
impairment are based on PK data. In the pivotal trials efficacy was not importantly influenced by 
mild or moderate renal impairment. For the FDC alogliptin/pioglitazone, the applicant did only seek 
approval of alogliptin/pioglitazone at a dose of alogliptin 12.5 mg in combination with pioglitazone 
30 or 45 mg for adults with T2DM in combination with moderate renal impairment. For the FDC 
alogliptin/pioglitazone the 6.25 mg alogliptin dose was not applied for. 
Elderly individuals 
Diabetes is a disease that is especially prevalent in elderly individuals.  
In study 009, where alogliptin was used as add-on therapy to a thiazolidinedionie,  no difference in 
efficacy between subjects < 65 year and those ≥65 years was observed, although the numbers 
were small (n=71).  
Similarly, in the pivotal trials with alogliptin, the treatment effect of alogliptin was not lower in 
patients >65 years compared to patients <65 years. However, only 2% of the patients treated with 
alogliptin were >75 years of age (n=124).  
Therefore, a study in elderly individuals was performed (study 303) which showed non-inferiority of 
alogliptin 25 mg vs. glipizide, however with a decrease of power due to low baseline HbA1c values.  
Importantly, results of the large pooled analysis of 2234 subjects from the 5 main phase 3, 26 
week, placebo-controlled studies with alogliptin demonstrate relevant efficacy in the elderly. In 
patients aged  ≥ 75 years alogliptin was associated with a treatment effect of -0.49% (95% 
CI-1.03, 0.06).  
Furthermore, efficacy results from the 2 main phase 3, active-controlled studies supporting this 
application for alogliptin/pioglitazone (total of 237 elderly subjects) demonstrated that HbA1c 
reductions at Week 52 were greater in subjects ≥ 65 years compared with subjects <65 years, 
although data interpretation in subjects ≥ 75 years is limited by the small numbers of subjects.  
These results, taken together, suggest that alogliptin/pioglitazone is a useful treatment option for 
elderly patients.

EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 89/136 
 
  
  
 
Secondary endpoints 
The results of the analysis of the effects of alogliptin on fasting plasma glucose were in line with the 
effects on HbA1c. There were no important effects on weight and serum lipids. 
Initial combination studies 
In patients inadequately controlled with metformin (study 322OPI-001), each individual 
combination of Alogliptin + Pioglitazone achieved larger reductions in HbA1c at Week 26 compared 
with the corresponding alogliptin and pioglitazone doses given alone. These differences were 
clinically relevant. The initial combination of alogliptin and pioglitazone (study 322OPI-002) was 
associated with a reduction in HbA1c that was larger than that with alogliptin and pioglitazone 
monotherapy. These data provide further support for the use of alogliptin in combination with 
metformin and/or pioglitazone, but initial combination therapy is not an indication requested by the 
applicant. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy was investigated in 2 pivotal trials for the combined use and in supportive trials. For the 
combination with a thiazolidinedione (with or without metformin), add-on of alogliptin 25 mg was 
associated with a clinically relevant reduction in HbA1c of -0.61% after 26 weeks in comparison to 
placebo.  
Since the bioequivalence of alogliptin and pioglitazone at the highest and lowest proposed dosage 
strength formulations, respectively, was sufficiently demonstrated when compared with individual 
alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets in the pivotal bioequivalence study, overall efficacy was found to 
be sufficiently demonstrated; this included also subgroups of elderly patients and patients with mild 
or moderate renal impairment. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Alogliptin + pioglitazone 
The safety discussion for the FDC alogliptin/pioglitazone in this safety document will focus on the 2 
main phase 3 studies (009 and 322OPI-004). As studies 009 and 322OPI-004 utilized different 
study designs and evaluated unique patient populations, the individual study results were not 
pooled but are instead summarized individually. 
For the assessment of the FDC, an overview of all pooled alogliptin studies is provided. In addition, 
information regarding pioglitazone is provided. 
Alogliptin 
Data from all 55 clinical alogliptin studies that comprise this MAA submission were used in the 
overall evaluation of safety. However, the focus of the safety assessment involves the Controlled 
Phase 2 and 3 Study Group and the main phase 3 studies 
Safety data from the 12 completed alogliptin phase 2 and 3 studies (003, 007, 008, 009, 010, 011, 
301, 302, 303, 322OPI-004, 322OPI-001, and 322OPI-002) and 1, at the time of evaluation of this 
application, ongoing phase 3 study (305) were pooled into the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 90/136 
 
  
  
Group. As the patient populations enrolled into these studies best represent the intended use of 
alogliptin, results from this Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group are the primary focus of the 
evaluation of clinical safety. These data were pooled to allow for an opportunity to detect rare 
events and potential safety signals. Studies are also assessed individually for specific indications, as 
appropriate. In addition, data from 4 of the main phase 3 placebo-controlled studies (007, 008, 009, 
010) were pooled to evaluate the safety data from a pool of main studies relevant to the proposed 
indications. 
Study 012 is an uncontrolled safety extension study and the CV outcome study (study 402, ongoing 
at the time of evaluation of this application) is evaluating a specific subpopulation of patients with 
T2DM and recent ACS; therefore, these studies are excluded from the pooled data but are discussed 
separately, as appropriate. 
Pioglitazone 
The safety profile of pioglitazone has been well established based on pre and postapproval clinical 
studies conducted in ≥ 27,000 subjects and over 10 years of postmarketing experience. 
Pioglitazone-containing products have accumulated postmarketing experience in over 25 million 
patient-years (24th PSUR). 
The safety assessment for the FDC alogliptin/pioglitazone involved the 2 main studies (009 and 
322OPI-004) and the 2 supporting studies (322OPI-001 and 322OPI-002). 
Patient exposure 
Alogliptin + pioglitazone 
A total of 3504 subjects were randomized in the four alogliptin/pioglitazone studies (009, 
322OPI-004, 322OPI-001 and 322OPI-002). Across these 4 studies, 1908 subjects received 
alogliptin in combination with pioglitazone either as a background medication or as one of the 
initial-combination treatment assignments. A total of 195 subjects were exposed to alogliptin and 
pioglitazone for 1 year (≥52 Weeks).

Study 009 
The median treatment duration was similar in all groups. Mean exposure was similar in the placebo, 
A12.5, and A25 groups (22.16 weeks, 22.93 weeks, and 23.46 weeks, respectively). The majority 
of subjects in each of the alogliptin groups were exposed to treatment for at least 26 weeks 
(≥52.0% in the alogliptin groups and 48.5% in the placebo group). 
Overall, 287/493 (58.2%) subjects were men. Mean age for all randomized subjects was 55.4 
years. The majority of subjects were <65 years of age (408/493, 82.8%) and White (366/493, 
74.2%). Mean BMI for all randomized subjects was 32.81 and mean duration of T2DM was 7.58 
years. 
Study 322OPI-004 
The median treatment duration was similar in both groups. Mean exposure duration was slightly 
greater in the MET+A25+P30 group (43.14 weeks) compared with the MET+P45 group (39.73 
weeks). Less than one-half of subjects in each group were exposed for at least 1 year (48.3% and 
42.6% in the MET+A25+P30 and MET+P45 groups, respectively).Overall, 414/803 subjects 
(51.6%) were men. Mean age for all randomized subjects was 55.1 years. The majority of subjects 
were <65 years of age (659/803, 82.1%) and White (498/803, 62.0%). Mean BMI for all 
randomized subjects was 31.55 and mean duration of T2DM was 7.16 years. The median baseline 
MET dose was 1700 mg for both groups. Overall, no meaningful differences were observed between 
the groups for any subject demographic or baseline characteristics. 
Alogliptin 
The number of subjects exposed to study drug, the duration of exposure, categorized duration of 
exposure, and cumulative exposure (subject-years) for subjects who participated in the phase 2 
and 3 studies (the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group and Studies 012 and 402) are summarized 
in the table below. In study , all subjects are counted within the alogliptin 25 mg group, although 
different doses were assigned according to renal function, such that all subjects had equivalent 
exposure. Furthermore, higher numbers of subjects in the overall program were exposed to 
alogliptin 25 mg compared with 12.5 mg. Additionally, asymmetrical randomization schedules in 
the phase 3 studies resulted in a proportionately smaller number of subjects in the placebo group 
compared with active comparator and the alogliptin groups. For these reasons, exposure-corrected 
rates for adverse events are included in key tables.

All subjects in the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group had a diagnosis of T2DM with inadequate 
glycaemic control. At the discretion of the investigator, subjects with a major illness or debility were 
excluded. Specific prohibited prior and concurrent conditions included New York Heart Association 
[NYHA] Class III or IV heart failure (Classes I-IV in Study 322OPI-004); angioedema associated 
with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor blockers (except 301); 
treated diabetic gastroparesis, laser-treated proliferative diabetic retinopathy (except 301), 
haemoglobinopathy (due to potential effect on HbA1c determination); history within 6 months 
(3 months for studies 302 and 305) prior to Screening of coronary angioplasty, coronary stent 
placement, coronary bypass surgery, or MI; and history within 5 years prior to Screening of cancers 
other than squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma of the skin.

Demographic and other baseline characteristics were comparable among the treatment groups. 
The majority (79%) of subjects were less than 65 years, with a mean age ranging from 54.9 to 56.3 
years, although there was an adequate representation of elderly subjects in the program. A total of 
1990 subjects were at least 65 years, 224 were ≥75 years, and 2 subjects were ≥85 years. Most 
(69%) subjects were White. Slightly more than half (54%) of the subjects had a BMI greater than 
30. At baseline, mean HbA1c ranged from 8.00% to 8.39% across treatment groups. 
Across the main safety pool, approximately 20% of subjects were from Europe, 33% were from the 
US or Canada, 23% were from Latin/South America, and 23% were from other regions, mainly 
Asia/Pacific countries. 
Adverse events 
Alogliptin + pioglitazone 
In study 009, alogliptin or placebo was added to TZD therapy (rosiglitazone or pioglitazone), which 
was given either alone or in combination with MET or an SU. In an ad-hoc analysis of TEAEs by 
background medication in study 009, there were no clinically important differences in the overall 
incidence of TEAE or the general safety profile among the pioglitazone only, pioglitazone+MET, and 
pioglitazone+SU groups. Therefore, the overall safety analysis of the study is presented by 
alogliptin dose, irrespective of the additional background therapy. 
TEAEs reported by ≥3% of subjects in any treatment group during study 009 are summarized by 
SOC and preferred term in the table below. All treatments were in addition to a pioglitazone with or 
without MET or an SU.

009) 
Common TEAEs (3% of Subjects in Any Treatment Group) (study 
The incidence of TEAEs observed with alogliptin in combination with pioglitazone with or without 
MET or an SU (69.7% and 72.4% for A12.5 and A25, respectively) was similar to placebo (64.9%). 
The most commonly reported TEAEs (experienced by ≥5% of subjects in the A25 group) were 
nasopharyngitis (placebo: 6.2%; A12.5: 4.0%; A25: 7.0%), edema peripheral (placebo: 7.2%; 
A12.5: 6.1%; A25: 5.5%), influenza (placebo: 4.1%; A12.5: 1.5%; A25: 5.5%), headache 
(placebo: 4.1%; A12.5: 4.0%; A25: 5.0%), and upper respiratory tract infection (placebo: 5.2%; 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013

A12.5: 5.6%; A25: 5.0%). Of note, the incidence of anemia, which is an ADR for pioglitazone, was 
higher in the A25 group vs the placebo group (3.0% in the A25 group vs none in the placebo group). 
The percentages of subjects who experienced at least 1 TEAE considered by the investigator to be 
possibly, probably, or definitely related to study drug were comparable across groups (placebo: 
18.6%; A12.5: 18.7%; A25: 18.6%). Study drug-related TEAEs that occurred in 2% of subjects 
were edema peripheral, hypokalemia, and headache in the placebo group (2.1% each); no study 
drug-related TEAEs occurred in >2% of subjects at either alogliptin dose. 
The majority of TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity. The percentage of subjects reporting 
TEAEs that were severe in intensity was generally similar among the groups (placebo: 6.2%; A12.5: 
5.6%; A25: 9.0%). The slightly higher incidence of severe TEAEs in the A25 group was due to 
2 subjects each reporting myocardial infarction and cardiac failure congestive. The only other 
severe event that occurred in more than 1 subject in any group was coronary artery disease 
(experienced by 2 subjects in the A12.5 group). One of the severe events of cardiac failure 
congestive was considered by the investigator to be related to study drug. 
The TEAEs reported by ≥3% of subjects in either group during study OPI-004 are summarized in 
the table below.

The incidence of TEAEs observed with alogliptin in combination with MET and pioglitazone (71.5%) 
was similar to that observed for MET and pioglitazone (68.9%). The most commonly reported TEAEs 
(≥5% in the MET+A25+P30 group) were upper respiratory tract infection (MET+A25+P30: 7.2%; 
MET+P45: 4.0%), nasopharyngitis (MET+A25+P30: 6.9%; MET+P45: 5.3%), hypertension 
(MET+A25+P30: 5.9%; MET+P45: 5.5%), and urinary tract infection (MET+A25+P30: 5.4%; 
MET+P45: 3.3%). 
The percentages of subjects who experienced at least 1 TEAE considered by the investigator to be 
possibly, probably, or definitely related to study drug were comparable between groups 
(MET+A25+P30: 21.8%; MET+P45: 18.8%). Study drug-related TEAEs that occurred in 2% of 
subjects were edema peripheral (2.0%) in the MET+A25+P30 group and oedema peripheral (3.0%) 
and diarrhoea (2.0%) in the MET+P45 group. 
The majority of TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity. The percentage of subjects reporting 
TEAEs that were severe in intensity was similar between groups (MET+A25+P30: 5.9%; MET+P45: 
6.8%). Most reported severe TEAEs occurred in only 1 subject, except for muscle spasms (1 
MET+A25+P30, 2 MET+P45), neutropenia (2 MET+A25+P30), road traffic accident 
(2 MET+A25+P30), acute myocardial infarction (2 MET+P45), pneumonia (2 MET+P45), back pain 
(2 MET+P45), hypertension (2 MET+P45), angina unstable (1 MET+A25+P30, 1 MET+P45), fall 
(1 MET+A25+P30, 1 MET+P45), osteoarthritis (1 MET+A25+P30, 1 MET+P45), and migraine 
(1 MET+A25+P30, 1 MET+P45). 
Comparison across the main studies for FDC alogliptin/pioglitazone 
Specific preferred terms such as anaemia achieve the 3% reporting threshold in 
alogliptin/pioglitazone studies 009 and 322OPI-004 (3% and 3%, respectively) and oedema 
peripheral (4% and 5.5%, respectively) versus alogliptin monotherapy sStudy 010 (0% and 3%, 
respectively). However, both preferred terms are labelled as common ADRs in the pioglitazone 
SmPC, suggesting an influence of pioglitazone on the reported AE profile, as would be expected.

 (a) Combines the 12.5 and 25 mg groups (already shown in the table) with the 6.25, 50, and 100 mg groups 
(which are not shown in the table). 
The incidence of TEAEs was comparable across treatment groups (68.6% active comparator vs 
66.6% alogliptin), although slightly lower in subjects receiving placebo (64.8%). However, in terms 
of events per 100 subject-years, the numbers were higher in the placebo group (438.0) than in the 
other groups (330.1 active comparator vs 340.5 alogliptin). The incidence of SAEs was slightly 
higher in the active comparator group (5.2%) than in the alogliptin 25 mg group (4.7%), the 
alogliptin 12.5 mg group (4.0%) or the placebo group (3.2%). For TEAEs leading to discontinuation 
of study drug, more subjects were withdrawn in the active comparator group (5.8%) than in the 
alogliptin group (3.9%) or the placebo group (2.3%). The incidence of deaths within the study 
period was low, with no deaths reported in the placebo group, 4 deaths in the active comparator 
group (0.2%), and 9 deaths (0.1%) in the alogliptin group.

more frequently than in subjects who received placebo or active comparators were headache, 
nasopharyngitis, and upper respiratory tract infection.  
The majority of the TEAEs experienced were considered by the investigator as either mild or 
moderate in intensity. No specific TEAE of severe intensity occurred in >1.0% of subjects in any 
group.

TEAEs reported in ≥1% of subjects treated with alogliptin 25 mg and occurring with a frequency 
twice the rate of placebo or active comparator (with at least 2 subjects if zero in the comparator 
group) were identified for consideration as possible adverse drug reactions. Compared with placebo, 
events meeting the criteria were upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, influenza, 
headache, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea, pruritus, rash, back pain, musculoskeletal pain, and 
myalgia. Compared with active comparator, events meeting the criteria were nasopharyngitis, 
insomnia, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, nausea, muscle spasms, 
musculoskeletal pain, hypersensitivity, headache, and rash. 
Pioglitazone 
The safety profile of pioglitazone has been well established based on clinical and significant 
marketing experience. In pioglitazone monotherapy studies, the most commonly (>5%) reported 
AEs were upper respiratory tract infection, headache, sinusitis, myalgia, and pharyngitis. The 
results from the pioglitazone safety evaluation are consistent with the pioglitazone SmPC. 
Across the 4 studies conducted with alogliptin and pioglitazone in combination, no clinically relevant 
or consistent increased incidence of AEs was noted for the combination vs the comparators. 
For pioglitazone, identified ADRs are those presented in the label. Following medical review of AE 
terms, the ADRs included in the proposed alogliptin/pioglitazone SmPC are identified for each of the 
single agents and in combination (dual and triple therapies) as listed below: 
 
 
 
 
headache, diarrhea, pruritus, and myalgia for alogliptin; 
upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, bladder cancer, hypoesthesia, insomnia, visual 
disturbance, macular edema, bone fracture, weight increased, and alanine aminotransferase 
increased for pioglitazone; 
upper respiratory tract infection and influenza for alogliptin/pioglitazone 
nasopharyngitis, insomnia, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, 
nausea, muscle spasms, musculoskeletal pain, hypersensitivity, headache, and rash for 
alogliptin/pioglitazone with metformin. 
Comparison across studies 
Comparisons of common overall AE rates (>3%) and AE rates by SOC in alogliptin/pioglitazone 
studies 009 and 322OPI-004, with AE rates reported in alogliptin monotherapy study 010 and 
against the alogliptin Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group (see section below), showed no 
clinically relevant or consistent differences in the overall safety profile of the alogliptin/pioglitazone 
FDC combination versus either dataset. Rate differences in individual preferred terms are subject to 
multiple different influences such as treatment durations, background medications and random 
variation. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Alogliptin + pioglitazone 
In the alogliptin/pioglitazone program there were a total of 3 deaths; one sudden death (study 
009, A12.5 as add-on to background P30); one myocardial infarction (study 322OPI-004, 
A25+P30); one sudden cardiac death (study 322OPI-001, P45).  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 99/136 
 
  
  
In study 009, the following treatment-emergent SAEs were reported by two subjects each in the 
A25 (add-on to a TZD with or without MET or an SU) group:  cardiac failure congestive, cellulitis, 
and myocardial infarction. No other individual treatment-emergent SAE was reported by more than 
1 subject in any treatment group. Based on the small number of SAEs in each SOC, no clear 
patterns in the types of SAEs experienced by subjects in the different groups were noted. 
In study 322OPI-004, two subjects each in the MET+A25+P30 group reported an SAE of 
non-cardiac chest pain and osteoarthritis. In addition, 2 subjects each in the MET+P45 group 
reported an SAE of acute myocardial infarction, cataract, fall, and hypotension. No other individual 
treatment-emergent SAE was reported by more than 1 subject in either treatment group. Based on 
the small number of SAEs in each SOC, no clear patterns in the types of SAEs experienced by 
subjects in the different groups were noted. 
Alogliptin 
Fifteen deaths were reported in the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group (11/6354 in the alogliptin 
group [0.17%]; 4/2257 in the active comparator group [0.18%]; and none in the placebo group). 
Most deaths were CV in nature. Only 2 of the 15 deaths (both in the alogliptin group) were 
considered by the investigator to have a possible relationship to study drug. 
In the CV outcomes study 402, deaths were reported for 26 subjects who received placebo 
(26/1079; 2.4%), 17 subjects who received alogliptin (17/1070; 1.6%), and 1 subject whose 
treatment assignment is unknown at this time (occurred after the clinical database cut for the 
interim analysis). None of these deaths was considered to be related to administration of study 
drug. 
A total of 44 deaths occurred in the open-label safety extension Study 012 (44/3320; 1.3%). Ten of 
the deaths were considered to have a possible relationship to study drug by the investigator. 
An additional 5 deaths occurred in the Japanese studies (5/1649; 0.3%), all considered unrelated to 
study drug. 
Overall, a low and similar percentage of subjects across treatment groups experienced at least 
1 SAE (placebo 3.2%; active comparator 5.2%; alogliptin 12.5 mg 4.0%, alogliptin 25 mg 4.7%). 
SAEs were reported most frequently in the cardiac disorder SOC, followed by the infections and 
infestations SOC. The incidence of SAEs associated with cardiac disorders was comparable between 
the alogliptin 25 mg and active comparator groups (1.0% and 1.2%, respectively) and greater 
compared with placebo (0.4%).  
A slightly higher percentage of subjects discontinued due to a TEAE in the alogliptin 25 mg group 
(4.1%) than the alogliptin 12.5 mg (3.6%) group. There was no discernible pattern of 
discontinuations with respect to type of TEAE. Notably, the percentage of subjects in the alogliptin 
groups (3.9%) that discontinued due to a TEAE was lower than for subjects who received active 
comparator (5.8%). 
Comparison across studies 
Comparisons of overall SAE rates and SAE rates for A25 by SOC in alogliptin/pioglitazone studies 
009 and 322OPI-004 with SAE rates reported in Study 010 (alogliptin monotherapy), showed 
higher overall SAE rates in studies 009 and 322OPI-004 (6.5% and 5%, respectively) compared 
with Study 010 (0.8%). In study 009, the main contributing SOCs were cardiac disorders and 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013

infections and infestations. In study 322OPI-004, no particular SOC predominated. Such 
differences can be explained by the progressive nature of the subjects’ T2DM in the 
alogliptin/pioglitazone studies; namely that the requirement for dual or triple therapy contrasts 
with the alogliptin monotherapy employed in study 010. This suggests that the disease was 
substantially more advanced, bringing with it higher rates of complications, some of which were 
serious. 
In the alogliptin Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group, the overall SAE rate in the A25 grouping was 
4.7%, which is consistent with the rates observed in the 2 main studies (009 and 322OPI-004). 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Special-interest TEAEs were predefined based on observations made during the clinical program, 
conditions in the T2DM patient population, and known or suspected effects of the drug class.  
CV Safety 
Alogliptin + pioglitazone 
In the 2 main phase 3 studies, the incidence of TEAEs in the cardiac disorders SOC was slightly 
higher in A25 mg group (in addition to a TZD with or without MET or an SU) in study 009 (6.5%) and 
the MET+A25+P30 group in Study 322OPI-004 (6.2%) compared to the A25 mg Grouping in the 
Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group (4.5%). 
For the 2 main phase 3 studies, potential CV events were retrospectively adjudicated. Events 
adjudicated as MACE (CV death, nonfatal MI, and nonfatal stroke) are presented in the table below.

The  incidence  of  any  MACE  in  the  alogliptin/pioglitazone  studies  was  low  and  generally  similar 
across treatment groups, although no subjects on placebo reported a MACE. 
Alogliptin 
In the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group, the percentages of subjects who experienced a TEAE 
from the SOC of cardiac disorders were comparable between the alogliptin 25 mg and active 
comparator groups (4.5% and 4.9%, respectively) and greater compared with placebo (2.5%). The 
most frequently reported cardiac disorder TEAEs in the alogliptin 25 mg group were angina pectoris 
and palpitations. The incidence of SAEs associated with cardiac disorders was comparable between 
the alogliptin 25 mg and active comparator groups (1.0% and 1.2%, respectively) and greater 
compared with placebo (0.4%). The most frequently reported cardiac disorder SAE in subjects 
receiving alogliptin 25 mg was angina pectoris. The incidence of events of hypertension was slightly 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 101/136 
 
  
  
higher in the active comparator group (4.5%) than for subjects receiving alogliptin 12.5 mg (3.6%) 
and 25 mg (3.9%), but slightly lower in the placebo group (3.3%).  
In the adjudicated MACE analysis for the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group, the incidence of CV 
death and nonfatal MI was similar and low in the alogliptin (0.1% and 0.2%, respectively) and 
active comparator groups (0.1% and 0.3%, respectively), while no subject receiving placebo 
reported CV death or nonfatal MI. The incidence of nonfatal stroke was lower for alogliptin-treated 
(<0.1%) subjects than for active comparator-treated (0.2%) and placebo (0.3%) subjects. 
Using a Cox Proportional Hazards (CPH) model for adjudicated MACE for the Controlled Phase 2 and 
3 Study Group, a hazard ratio of alogliptin against all comparators (placebo and active) was 0.806.  
During the procedure, the CHMP did seek clarification on the cases of cardiac failure and myocardial 
infarction designated as nonserious. The applicant stated that there were 20 subjects in total in the 
alogliptin clinical studies who experienced adverse events (AEs) of cardiac failure/cardiac failure 
congestive (14 subjects) or myocardial infarction (6 subjects) in which the event had been 
classified by the investigator as nonserious. The applicant did provide details of the definition of 
SAEs provided to the investigators, which was applied consistently for all studies and also provided 
detailed case narratives for these 20 subjects; a clinical review of the available data was performed 
and a rationale for the nonserious designation has been determined based on that data. The review 
of the 6 subjects with nonserious AEs of myocardial infarction indicated that these were reported by 
investigators on the basis of ECG findings, suggestive of myocardial ischaemia rather than hospital 
admissions with typical chest pain (and confirmatory cardiac enzyme rise). The majority of these 
AEs were supported with sufficient clinical information indicating that the nonserious classification 
was appropriate. Similarly, reassuring descriptions were provided by the applicant for the cases of 
heart failure, and therefore the CHMP considered this concern as being resolved.  
The CV risk of alogliptin is also being assessed in the CV outcomes Study 402. In that study, 
potential CV events are being collected and independently and prospectively adjudicated (by a 
blinded cardiovascular endpoint committee [CEC]). The incidence of CV death (1.0%) and nonfatal 
stroke (0.5%) in the interim analysis were the same for alogliptin and placebo in this study, with the 
incidence of nonfatal MI higher in the placebo group (2.8%) than in the alogliptin group (2.0%). 
MACE results from the interim analysis of Study 402 were consistent (hazard ratio alogliptin vs 
placebo, 0.814) with the MACE analysis done for the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Group. When urgent 
revascularization due to unstable angina is added to adjudicated events, the hazard ratio is lower at 
0.750. The proportion of subjects requiring urgent revascularization was lower in the alogliptin 
group (0.4%) than in the placebo group (0.8%).  
Based on results showing no increase in MACE with alogliptin, no special warning/precaution 
regarding CV events is included but a warning concerning limited experience with alogliptin in 
patients with class III/IV congestive heart failure is included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Pioglitazone 
The CV safety of pioglitazone has been assessed in the PROactive study. This study evaluated CV 
outcomes in subjects with T2DM and macrovascular disease. Subjects received either pioglitazone 
titrated from 15 mg to 45 mg (n=2605) or placebo (n=2633) in addition to their glucose-lowering 
drugs and other medications for approximately 3 years. Overall, the results of this study 
demonstrated no increase in mortality or total macrovascular events with pioglitazone compared 
with placebo. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 102/136 
 
  
  
With regard to MACE, which was evaluated as a secondary endpoint, pioglitazone reduced the risk 
of having an event in the composite of all-cause mortality, non-fatal MI, or stroke compared with 
placebo (HR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.72–0.98, p=0.027). Furthermore, results of meta-analyses of all 
pioglitazone studies were consistent with results of PROactive. 
Hypersensitivity Reactions 
Alogliptin + pioglitazone 
No subjects in the 2 main alogliptin/pioglitazone studies experienced an SAE hypersensitivity 
reaction or a TEAE leading to discontinuation within the SMQs. Three subjects from the 2 main 
phase 3 studies supporting the combination of alogliptin/pioglitazone reported an AE from the 
severe cutaneous adverse reaction SMQ: 1 subject (1/399 [0.3%]) receiving an active 
comparator (dermatitis exfoliative) and 2 subjects (2/603 [0.3%]) receiving A25 (exfoliative rash 
and dermatitis exfoliative). Nine subjects from the 2 main phase 3 studies supporting the 
combination of alogliptin/pioglitazone reported an AE from the angioedema SMQ: 1 (1/97 
[1.0%]) receiving placebo (urticaria), 4 (4/399 [1.0%]) receiving an active comparator (periorbital 
edema and swelling face [1 subject] and face edema, lip swelling, and urticaria [1 subject each]), 
and 4 subjects (4/603 [0.7%]) receiving A25 (angioedema, conjunctival edema, corneal edema, 
and face edema [1 subject each]). These events were not reported as SAEs and did not lead to 
study drug discontinuation. No subject in any either of the 2 main phase 3 studies reported an 
anaphylaxis reaction (category A). 
Alogliptin 
Hypersensitivity reactions are of special interest as they have been associated with the use of other 
DPP-4 inhibitors. Administration of some DPP-4 inhibitors has been associated with dose- and 
duration-dependent necrotic peripheral skin lesions in monkeys. Such lesions have not been 
observed in alogliptin non-clinical studies nor have they in humans. 
Preferred terms were identified by severe cutaneous adverse reactions Standardized Medical Query 
(SMQ) (narrow-scope terms only), angioedema SMQ (narrow-scope terms only), and anaphylactic 
reaction SMQ (narrow-scope terms only). 
Overall, the frequency of hypersensitivity reactions was low (≤0.8%) and balanced across the 
treatment groups. There were no serious hypersensitivity reactions in subjects receiving alogliptin 
12.5 mg or 25 mg. 13 patients (0.2%) developed an anaphylactic reaction during alogliptin, 
whereas no patient developed an anaphylactic reaction during treatment with placebo. Although 
not part of the hypersensitivity reaction event search by SMQ, it is noted that a subject in the 
phase 3 program (on alogliptin 25 mg) had an SAE of serum sickness that resulted in 
discontinuation of study drug. 
While safety results for alogliptin indicate a low incidence of hypersensitivity reactions, such 
reactions are included as an undesirable effect in section 4.8 of the SmPC, which is consistent with 
labeling for other DPP-4 inhibitors, and listed as a potential risk in the RMP. As additional 
pharmacovigilance activity the cardiovascular outcome study 402 is further investigating 
hypersensitivity reactions. The final study report is expected to be in the first quarter of 2014.

Pioglitazone 
Hypersensitivity reactions are known to have occurred following administration of pioglitazone, and 
hence are noted as an identified risk for pioglitazone in the RMP. A total of 46 serious, medically 
confirmed cases of anaphylactoid reaction have accumulated in the Takeda global safety database 
in association with the pioglitazone monoproduct. This equates to a reporting rate of 2.13 per 1 
million patient-years, which is very low. 
Acute Pancreatitis 
Alogliptin + pioglitazone 
None of the subjects in the 2 main phase 3 alogliptin/pioglitazone studies reported an AE of 
pancreatitis. 
Alogliptin 
No toxicological effects in the pancreas or pancreatic cells were observed in non-clinical studies of 
alogliptin. No evidence of pancreatitis was noted in the chronic toxicity studies in rats and dogs or 
in a 2-year carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats.  
In the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group, the percentage of subjects reporting at least 1 acute 
pancreatitis TEAE was low in all groups, reported in 5 subjects (0.1%) treated with alogliptin 25 mg 
and 2 subjects (<0.1%) with alogliptin 12.5 mg compared with 1 subject (<0.1%) treated with an 
active comparator. Among the 7 alogliptin-treated subjects reporting at least 1 acute pancreatitis 
TEAE, 3 subjects had SAEs and 2 subjects had TEAEs (pancreatitis acute and pancreatitis) that led 
to study drug discontinuation.  
In addition to the 8 subjects in the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group with pancreatitis TEAEs, 
as of 23 August 2011, pancreatitis TEAEs were reported for 6 subjects in study 402 (3 and 
3 subjects, respectively, in the alogliptin 25 mg and placebo groups), 13 subjects in study 012 (9 
and 4 subjects, respectively, in the alogliptin 25 and 12.5 mg groups), and 2 subjects in the 
regional studies (1 subject on placebo in study 308 [China] and 1 subject on alogliptin 25 mg in 
study OCT-001 [Japan]). 
After adjusting for exposure, rates of pancreatitis adverse events were 0, 0.1, 0.1, and 0.3 events 
per 100 subject-years, respectively, for the placebo, active comparator, and alogliptin 12.5 and 
25 mg groups in the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group. These rates are comparable to 
epidemiological studies that have shown that diabetic subjects have an increased incidence of 0.05 
to 0.4 events per 100 patient-years vs 0.02 to 0.15 events per 100 patient-years in non-diabetic 
subjects. 
The frequency of pancreatitis events is low but there is an increased risk with alogliptin treatment.  
The risk of pancreatitis is included as Warning and Precautions in the SmPC, Section 4.4, and acute 
pancreatitis is listed as an adverse reaction in Post-marketing Reports in the SmPC, Section 4.8. 
Moreover, new pancreatitis data have been integrated during the procedure and hence pancreatitis 
is now included as an identified risk in the Risk Management Plan.. As additional pharmacovigilance 
activity the cardiovascular outcome study 402 is further investigating pancreatitis. The final study 
report is expected to be available in the first quarter of 2014.

Malignancies 
Alogliptin + pioglitazone 
Two subjects in study 009 in the placebo group reported SAEs within the malignancy SMQ: basal 
cell carcinoma and colon cancer, and 2 subjects in Study 322OPI-004 reported SAEs within the 
malignancy SMQ: colon cancer (MET+A25+P30 treatment group) and rectosigmoid cancer 
(MET+P45 treatment group). Of note, no subject in either of the main phase 3 studies reported 
bladder neoplasm. 
Based on the results in the alogliptin/pioglitazone main studies, there is no evidence to suggest that 
the combination of alogliptin and pioglitazone is associated with an increase in incidence of 
malignancy. 
Since there is a warning in the pioglitazone SmPC regarding bladder cancer, this is reflected for the 
FDC product SmPC. Bladder cancer specifically is listed as an identified risk of pioglitazone, and 
other malignancies are considered a potential risk of pioglitazone in the RMP. 
Alogliptin 
Malignancies are considered special-interest TEAEs for long-term use of DPP-4 or GLP-1 therapies. 
Alogliptin was not genotoxic in non-clinical in vitro and in vivo genotoxic studies, and no evidence of 
carcinogenicity occurred in the non-clinical studies with alogliptin. 
The percentage of subjects reporting at least 1 malignancy TEAE was low in all groups (0.9% 
placebo, 0.4% active comparator, 0.8% alogliptin 12.5 mg, 0.5% alogliptin 25 mg) with no 
imbalance in individual cancers.  
Based on these results showing low overall incidence, no special warning/precaution is included for 
malignancies in the SmPC. 
Pancreatic Cancer: Uncertainties remained during the procedure regarding effects of alogliptin on 
the pancreas, as long term safety data are limited. Besides, during the procedure data had been 
published that gave rise to additional concerns on inflammatory and proliferative pancreatic effects 
of the therapy with another DPP-4 inhibitor, sitagliptin, (Butler et al. Diabetes, March 2013). 
Therefore the applicant was asked during the assessment procedure to provide further analyses 
with regard to pancreatic risk. 
In the controlled clinical studies, including the long-term studies OPI-004 (52 weeks) and 
305 (104 weeks), there were no TEAEs of pancreatic cancer in alogliptin treatment groups. A PV 
database search found that 5 subjects had pancreatic cancer events that occurred outside of the 
study treatment period: 4 subjects had events that occurred during run-in before randomization 
(prior to study drug exposure) and 1 subject who received placebo and pioglitazone had an event 
spontaneously reported 1 year after study completion. 
As of November 2012, in Study 402, there were no TEAEs of pancreatic cancer.  
A total of 5 subjects with events were reported with alogliptin in uncontrolled studies, and the 
incidence rates of pancreatic cancer for the alogliptin uncontrolled studies were considered to be 
consistent with the incidence expected in the T2DM population.  
Most postmarketing cases reported a time to onset less than 2 months from starting alogliptin or 
had pre-existing pancreatic cancer before receiving alogliptin.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 105/136 
 
  
  
Based on these additional data the CHMP considered that there was no clear evidence for an 
association of pancreatic cancer and alogliptin treatment. Nevertheless, CHMP considered that a 
targeted follow-up is needed. This has now been reflected in the RMP as ‘Pancreatic cancer’ has 
been included as an important potential risk (in line with the recommendation given by CHMP at the 
July 2013 meeting for this class of products in the conclusions of the Art. 5(3) referral for GLP 1 
based therapies). 
Pioglitazone 
Bladder neoplasm was identified as an AE of special interest based on the 2-year carcinogenicity 
study of pioglitazone that revealed treatment-associated neoplastic changes in the urinary bladder 
in male rats. A meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials involving over 22,000 patients 
(12,506 pioglitazone and 10,212 comparator) examined the relationship between pioglitazone and 
bladder cancer. Results of the analysis revealed 26 total cases (19 pioglitazone, 7 comparator). 
When subjects that were diagnosed with bladder cancer within the first year of treatment were 
excluded, there were 9 total cases (7 pioglitazone, 2 comparator). Given the low overall incidence 
of bladder cancer and biologic implausibility of developing new bladder cancer within 1 year of 
starting treatment, it is difficult to draw meaningful conclusions from these results. Interim results 
of an ongoing epidemiological study of the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) database 
showed no statistically significant increase risk of bladder cancer among patients ever treated with 
pioglitazone. Analyses addressing longer exposure to pioglitazone, however, suggest an increased 
risk of developing bladder cancer with longer-term therapy. This KPNC study is ongoing, with the 
final report expected in 2013. 
After extensive non-clinical, clinical, and epidemiological investigations, no conclusive evidence has 
emerged. This may be due partly to the rarity of bladder cancer, the long latency to the 
development of bladder cancer, confounding of multiple other risk factors (eg, smoking) and 
treatments in the T2DM population, particularly when pioglitazone is used late in T2DM and 
following other antidiabetic treatments. Nonetheless, the results from the meta-analysis do not 
exclude the possibility that there is an association between pioglitazone and bladder cancer. 
The CHMP recently reviewed available data on pioglitazone use and the occurrence of bladder 
cancer and concluded in July 2011 and October 2011 that there is a small increased risk of bladder 
cancer in subjects taking pioglitazone but that the benefit/risk balance remained positive (referral 
procedure EMEA/H/C/0285/A-20/0046). The Company Core Safety Information (CCSI) for 
pioglitazone has subsequently been updated to include active bladder cancer as a listed event and 
to include warnings in the product information regarding the use of pioglitazone in subjects with 
active bladder cancer or a history of bladder cancer. 
Hypoglycaemia  
Investigators were asked to record episodes of hypoglycaemia on a dedicated case report form 
(CRF). Three criteria were identified: 
 
 
Symptomatic hypoglycaemic episode and blood glucose <3.33 mmol/L (mild to moderate). 
Symptomatic or asymptomatic hypoglycaemic episode and blood glucose <2.78 mmol/L 
(mild to moderate). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 106/136 
 
  
  
 
Any hypoglycaemic episode that required assistance, associated with a documented blood 
glucose <3.33 mmol/L (severe). 
Alogliptin + pioglitazone 
In the case of alogliptin 25 mg used to form triple therapy with MET and pioglitazone in study 
322OPI-004, there was an approximate tripling of rate of hypoglycaemic episodes (4.5%) vs dual 
therapy with MET and a higher dose of pioglitazone (1.5%). A similar trend was also seen in 
Study 322OPI-001, which compared pioglitazone and alogliptin alone and in combination as add-on 
therapy to MET, but with lower incidence rates. 
In study 009 (add-on to TZD), accurate interpretation of hypoglycaemic episode rates is 
complicated by the permitted variations in background therapy with respect to MET and SU. There 
were more hypoglycaemic episodes in the alogliptin 25 mg group (7.0%) compared to the placebo 
group (5.2%). 
Alogliptin 
The incidence of hypoglycaemic episodes in the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group (excluding 
study 301 as detailed information regarding hypoglycaemic episodes was not collected in this study) 
was 12.9% in the active comparator group, 3.6% in the alogliptin 25 mg group, and 6.2% in the 
placebo group. Within each treatment group, the highest numbers of hypoglycaemic episodes were 
classified as symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes with a blood glucose <3.33 mmol/L. Although 
the incidence of severe hypoglycaemic episodes was low overall, the percentages in the placebo and 
active comparator groups (both 0.4%) were higher than for subjects treated with alogliptin (0.1%). 
From this pooled analysis, across the alogliptin clinical development program, alogliptin treatment 
does not lead to an increased risk of hypoglycaemia when compared with placebo or active 
comparator. 
From the main individual placebo-controlled studies covering use as add-on to MET (study 008) and 
add-on to SU (study 007), there was no consistent indication of an increase in hypoglycaemia risk 
or severity by the addition of alogliptin 25 mg. The level of HbA1c on entry, being at the lower end 
of the diabetic range, did not appear to unduly influence hypoglycaemia rates or severity.  
In study 007 (add-on to SU), fewer subjects in the alogliptin 25 mg group (9.6%) experienced a 
hypoglycaemic event compared with placebo (11.1%). The noticeably higher rates in the placebo 
and alogliptin 12.5 mg (15.8%) arms were likely driven by the SU component.  
In Study 011 (add-on to insulin, with or without MET), episodes of hypoglycaemia were anticipated 
due to the insulin background therapy in this study population. The incidence of hypoglycaemic 
episodes was higher in the alogliptin 25 mg (27.1%) and 12.5 mg (26.7%) groups vs placebo 
(24.0%), but the incidence was similar for severe cases.  
In study 305 (alogliptin vs SU in a general adult T2DM population, on MET monotherapy), 
hypoglycaemia rates with alogliptin 25 mg vs MET+glipizide were >10-fold lower (1.4% vs 23.8%, 
respectively). Similarly, the incidence of severe hypoglycaemic episodes was greater in the 
MET+glipizide group (0.5%) compared with the MET+alogliptin 12.5 mg and MET+alogliptin 25 mg 
groups (0.1% and 0, respectively). The higher incidence of hypoglycaemia in the MET+glipizide 
group is consistent with the glipizide label, which states that hypoglycaemia is likely to occur when 
more than one glucose-lowering drug is used. 
CHMP assessment report

Page 107/136 
 
  
  
In elderly subjects ≥65 years in study 303, hypoglycaemia rates were approximately 5-fold lower 
for alogliptin 25 mg vs glipizide (5.4% vs 26.0%). There were no severe episodes of hypoglycaemia 
in the alogliptin 25 mg group, and the rate of hypoglycaemia was in line with the hypoglycaemia 
rates in the placebo and alogliptin groups reported in the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group, 
predominantly in subjects <65 years. As elderly patients with T2DM are considered more 
susceptible to episodes of hypoglycaemia than younger patients, a pooled analysis of the data from 
12 studies was performed comparing these age groups. The overall incidence of any episode of 
hypoglycaemia was similar between subjects ≥65 years and <65 years (3.8% and 3.6%, 
respectively) treated with alogliptin 25 mg. 
Cardiac Failure 
Alogliptin + pioglitazone 
The incidence of cardiac failure and cardiac failure congestive was 0% and 1.5%, respectively, in 
the alogliptin 25 mg group in study 009 and 0.5% and 0.2%, respectively, in the MET+A25+P30 
group in study 322OPI-004. There were no patterns or trends observed for AEs in any of the 
alogliptin/pioglitazone main studies suggestive of an increased incidence in these types of events 
when alogliptin is added to pioglitazone treatment. 
Pioglitazone 
TZDs, including pioglitazone, cause or exacerbate congestive heart failure (CHF) in some patients. 
After initiation of pioglitazone, and after dose increases, patients should be monitored carefully for 
signs and symptoms of heart failure (e.g. excessive, rapid weight gain, dyspnea, and/or edema). If 
heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care and 
discontinuation or dose reduction of pioglitazone must be considered. Pioglitazone is not 
recommended in patients with symptomatic heart failure. Pioglitazone is contraindicated in patients 
with established NYHA class I to IV heart failure. 
Statements in the proposed SmPC are aligned with the approved pioglitazone SmPC. 
Oedema 
Alogliptin + pioglitazone 
The incidence of oedema peripheral was 5.5% in the alogliptin 25 mg group in study 009 and 4.0% 
in the MET+A25+P30 group in study 322OPI-004. No subject in either of the 
alogliptin/pioglitazone main phase 3 studies had an SAE of oedema peripheral. One subject in the 
MET+A25+P30 group reported a TEAE of oedema peripheral that led to study discontinuation. 
There were no patterns or trends observed for AEs in any of the alogliptin/pioglitazone main studies 
suggestive of an increased incidence in these types of events when alogliptin is added to 
pioglitazone treatment. 
Statements in the proposed SmPC are aligned with the approved pioglitazone SmPC. 
Pioglitazone 
Oedema, a known effect in the TZD drug class, can occur with pioglitazone treatment and is usually 
mild or moderate. In controlled studies, oedema was reported more frequently in subjects treated 
with pioglitazone than in placebo-treated subjects and is dose related.

Weight Gain 
Alogliptin + pioglitazone 
In the main phase 3 studies with the combination, there were no significant treatment differences 
for the change from baseline in body weight at Week 26 (study 009) or Week 52 
(study 322OPI-004). A similar pattern was observed in supportive phase 3 Study 322OPI-001; 
however, there was a statistically significant body weight increase for subjects in the A25+P30 
group compared with the A25 alone or P30 alone groups in supportive study 322OPI-002. 
Statements in the proposed SmPC are aligned with the approved pioglitazone SmPC. 
Pioglitazone 
Dose-related weight gain, a known effect in the TZD drug class, has been observed with 
pioglitazone treatment, alone or in combination with other hypoglycaemic agents. 
Bone Fracture 
Alogliptin + pioglitazone 
The incidence of TEAEs in the musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders SOC was similar in 
the alogliptin 25 mg group in study 009 (13.6%) and the MET+A25+P30 group in 
study 322OPI-004 (15.1%) compared to the alogliptin 25 mg group (13.9%) and the placebo 
group (12.1%) in the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group of the alogliptin clinical program. 
Pioglitazone 
An increased incidence of bone fracture in women treated with pioglitazone was observed in the 
PROactive randomized trial. During a mean follow-up of 34.5 months, the incidence of bone 
fracture in women was 5.1% (44/870) for pioglitazone vs 2.5% (23/905) for placebo. This 
difference was noted after the first year of treatment and persisted during the course of the study. 
The majority of fractures observed in women were nonvertebral fractures, including lower limb and 
distal upper limb. Results from a recently completed study that evaluated the effect of pioglitazone 
on bone metabolism in postmenopausal women with impaired fasting glucose, however, do not 
suggest an altered bone metabolism in pioglitazone-treated subjects that would lead to excessive 
bone fragility. 
Statements in the proposed SmPC are aligned with the approved pioglitazone SmPC. 
Hepatic dysfunction 
Alogliptin + pioglitazone 
There is no evidence to suggest that the combination of alogliptin and pioglitazone is associated 
with an increased incidence of hepatotoxicity. 
Pioglitazone 
Specific long-term studies consistently demonstrate that pioglitazone use does not lead to 
increased hepatotoxicity. The current pioglitazone SmPC provides guidance for use in subjects who 
exhibit active liver disease, and hepatic dysfunction is listed as an identified risk for pioglitazone in 
the RMP. Statements in the SmPC are aligned accordingly.

Macular Oedema 
Alogliptin + pioglitazone 
There is no evidence to suggest that the combination of alogliptin and pioglitazone is associated 
with an increase in incidence or severity of any of these AEs of special interest. 
Pioglitazone 
A potential signal for macular edema was observed in a retrospective, postmarketing medical 
record review in subjects treated with pioglitazone and other TZDs. However, no evidence for 
increased reporting of this common diabetic complication of retinopathy has been found in the 
pioglitazone clinical database. Nonetheless, macular edema is included as a potential risk for 
pioglitazone (RMP). 
Comparative safety by dose 
Alogliptin + pioglitazone 
Only the main study 009 evaluated both alogliptin 12.5 mg and 25 mg for the FDC 
alogliptin/pioglitazone. In this study, incidence of TEAEs was similar (69.7%, alogliptin 12.5 mg; 
72.4%, alogliptin 25 mg) between the dose groups, and there was no clear dose-response 
relationship. The incidence of SAEs in the alogliptin 12.5 mg group was lower than in the alogliptin 
25 mg group (2.5% vs 6.5%, respectively), but both groups were similar to placebo-control (4.1%). 
The proportion of subjects discontinuing the study due to a TEAE was identical in both alogliptin 
groups (3.0%) 
In study 322OPI-004, TEAE rates were consistent with the data for alogliptin 25 mg described above, 
but no dose comparison could be performed within this study. 
Alogliptin 
In most of the phase 3 studies, both alogliptin 12.5 mg and 25 mg were evaluated; however, in 
some studies, particularly the longer duration studies, only 25 mg was evaluated. Therefore, for the 
alogliptin 25 mg group, there were more subjects exposed overall and for longer durations 
compared with the alogliptin 12.5 mg group. 
Incidence of TEAEs was similar between the alogliptin 12.5 and 25 mg dose groups. In the 
Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group, the incidence of TEAEs was 67.5% in the alogliptin 12.5 mg 
group (333.2 events per 100 subject-years) and 66.6% in the alogliptin 25 mg group (342.1 events 
per 100 subject-years). For SAEs, the incidence was 4.0% in the alogliptin 12.5 mg group (8.5 
events per 100 subject-years) vs 4.7% in the alogliptin 25 mg group (9.9 events per 100 
subject-years). For TEAEs leading to discontinuation of the study drug, the incidence was 3.6% in 
the alogliptin 12.5 mg group (6.5 events per 100 subject-years) vs 4.1% in the alogliptin 25 mg 
group (7.1 events per 100 subject-years). 
Common TEAEs (experienced by 3% of subjects in either dose group) were experienced by similar 
proportions of subjects in the 12.5 and 25 mg dose groups and included nasopharyngitis (5.7% vs 
5.1%, alogliptin 12.5 mg vs 25 mg), upper respiratory tract infection (4.9% vs 5.2%), headache 
(4.4% vs 5.4%), urinary tract infection (4.1% vs 4.2%), hypertension (3.6% vs 3.9%), diarrhoea 
(3.7% vs 3.8%), and back pain (3.5% vs 3.3%). No meaningful differences were observed between 
the dose groups in the analysis of common TEAEs by time to onset or by duration of exposure to 
CHMP assessment report

treatment. In addition, no single type of event emerged in 1 of the 2 dose categories and not in the 
other.  
Similarly, the incidences of TEAEs of special interest, including hypersensitivity, acute pancreatitis, 
malignancies, and CV events were comparable between exposure-corrected dose groups. Overall, 
the safety and tolerability profile of alogliptin was similar between the 12.5 and 25 mg groups. 
Laboratory findings 
Alogliptin + pioglitazone 
The incidence of markedly abnormal values for renal function parameters during treatment was low 
overall and similar across treatment groups. There is no safety signal for an increased incidence of 
abnormal renal function values when alogliptin is coadministered with pioglitazone. 
In study 009, 2 subjects in each of the alogliptin groups (1.0% each) had an alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) >3× upper limit of normal (ULN) during treatment compared with no 
subjects in the placebo group. The ALT value exceeded 10×ULN for 2 of the 4 subjects. In both 
cases, these abnormalities were considered to be unrelated to study drug by the investigator and a 
possible alternative aetiology was provided (009 Study Report). No subjects had an ALT 
value >3×ULN in conjunction with elevated bilirubin. 
In study 322OPI-004, 3 subjects (0.8%) in the MET+A25+P30 group and 2 subjects (0.5%) in 
the MET+P45 group had an ALT >3×ULN. No subjects had an ALT>10×ULN or an ALT>3×ULN with 
elevated bilirubin. 
Overall, the data indicate the combination of alogliptin and pioglitazone is associated with a low risk 
of hepatic toxicity. 
Alogliptin 
For laboratory evaluations of haematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis, mean changes from 
baseline to Endpoint were generally small and consistent across the treatment groups. This was 
also the case for renal and hepatic function parameters. 
The incidence of markedly abnormal values for renal function parameters during treatment was low 
overall and similar across treatment groups. 
During treatment, the incidence of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >3× upper limit of normal (ULN) 
was higher in the active comparator group (2.2%) than in alogliptin or placebo groups (1.3% and 
0.9%, respectively). The incidence of ALT >5×ULN in subjects receiving active comparator, 
alogliptin or placebo was 0.5%, 0.3%, and 0.1%, respectively. ALT >10×ULN only occurred in 
subjects receiving active comparator or alogliptin (0.2% and 0.1%, respectively). 
The incidence of total bilirubin >34.2 µmol/L was low and similar across groups (active comparator 
0.5%, alogliptin 0.4%). The incidence of ALT >3×ULN concurrent with total bilirubin >34.2 µmol/L 
was 0.1% in the active comparator group and <0.1% in subjects receiving alogliptin. 
For the alogliptin-treated subjects with an ALT >10×ULN, all had an alternative (non-study drug) 
aetiology. Minor, transient and isolated elevations in hepatic parameters were observed in other 
subjects but most were not considered clinically meaningful in terms of observed absolute values 
within expected physiological fluctuation of these enzymes in the context of underlying liver 
comorbidity. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013

Overall, the data indicate alogliptin is associated with a low risk of hepatic toxicity. 
Vital signs and electrocardiogram evaluations 
No clinically meaningful trends were observed in vital sign measures (pulse, blood pressure, 
respiratory rate, and temperature) in either the alogliptin studies or the two main studies for the 
FDC alogliptin/pioglitazone. In addition, alogliptin was found to be weight neutral. 
Non-clinical electrophysiological studies did not raise any safety concerns. Study 019 investigated 
the effects of alogliptin on cardiac repolarization (QT/QTc) and concluded that alogliptin had no 
clinically meaningful effect on cardiac repolarization. Electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters showed 
no clinically meaningful trends.  
Safety in special populations 
To determine whether certain factors predispose subgroups of individuals to experience specific 
TEAEs, analyses were performed using the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group for a number of 
intrinsic (sex, age, race, BMI, and renal function) factors. No important differences were noted. The 
safety of alogliptin/pioglitazone in special groups and situations was not specifically investigated in 
the clinical program; however, because there is no drug interaction between pioglitazone and 
alogliptin, the FDC is expected to have a similar profile as the individual components. 
Elderly 
TEAEs in the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group were reviewed by age group (<65, 65-74, 
75-84, and ≥85 years). Dizziness, headache, urinary tract infection, diarrhoea, and dyslipidaemia 
were consistently reported by a greater percentage of subjects 75-84 years compared with subjects 
<65 years and subjects 65-74 years in the alogliptin 25 mg group. This trend was also evident in the 
active comparator group for dizziness. This finding is consistent with the known propensity for these 
conditions observed in the general population of elderly patients and is not attributable per se to 
alogliptin treatment. 
In addition, creatinine renal clearance decreased was reported by a greater percentage of subjects 
75-84 years of age compared with subjects <65 years and subjects 65-74 years in the alogliptin 
25 mg group. This trend was also evident in the active comparator group. This subgroup difference 
is not unexpected and is unlikely to be attributable to alogliptin treatment. 
In the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group, no safety signals were observed in subgroup 
populations stratified by age, but exposure in subjects older than 85 years of age is very limited. 
Study 303 was a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study designed to further explore the 
efficacy and safety of alogliptin compared with glipizide over a longer period of time (up to 52 weeks) 
in an older T2DM subject population (age, 65 to 90 years). Overall, compared with glipizide, 
alogliptin was well tolerated, showed less hypoglycaemia, and no body weight increases. The safety 
and tolerability results evaluated in this study were consistent with the safety profile established for 
alogliptin in previous studies within its clinical development program. The most frequently reported 
TEAEs included urinary tract infection, dizziness, and headache, all of which are similar to glipizide 
and consistent with what has been reported in previous studies. Most other TEAEs occurred in less 
than 1% of subjects, were considered by the investigator not drug related, and were mild or 
moderate in intensity. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 112/136 
 
  
  
Pioglitazone 
No important differences in safety profile in elderly subjects were noted in the pioglitazone studies. 
However, in the pioglitazone SmPC, age-related risks such as bladder cancer, bone fracture, and 
heart failure should be taken into account and the balance of benefits and risks should be 
considered during treatment in the elderly. 
Combination treatment with alogliptin and pioglitazone in the elderly population is expected to have 
a similar safety profile as the individual components. Thus, no dose adjustment is necessary for 
alogliptin/pioglitazone based on age. 
Subjects with Impaired Renal Function 
In the phase 1 study 006 with alogliptin (renal pharmacokinetic study), compared with healthy 
subjects, systemic exposure to alogliptin was 71%, 112%, 251% and 377% higher in subjects with 
mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment, and with ESRD, respectively, following administration 
of a single alogliptin 50 mg dose. While no change in dose is anticipated for patients with mild renal 
impairment, dose reductions proportional to the increases in exposure in subjects with moderate or 
severe renal impairment or ESRD are recommended (SmPC). The majority of TEAEs reported in this 
study were judged to be mild in intensity and unrelated to study drug. The percentage of TEAEs was 
similar between each renal impairment group and their respective healthy matched controls. As 
expected, several subjects with renal impairment exhibited serum chemistry and urinalysis 
abnormalities consistent with their underlying condition; however, no clinically meaningful changes 
in any of these values were observed. 
The majority of subjects in the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group had mild or moderate renal 
impairment based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the MDRD calculation. The 
relatively small number of subjects with severe baseline renal impairment limits the ability to make 
meaningful comparisons in this subgroup (no subjects receiving placebo or active comparator, 1 
subject in the alogliptin 12.5 mg group, and 3 subjects in the alogliptin 25 mg group when defined 
by MDRD formula).  
In the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study group, urinary tract infection was the only common TEAE 
reported by ≥1% of subjects in the alogliptin 25 mg group for which the incidence in subjects with 
moderate renal impairment at baseline was higher than that in subjects with normal renal function 
or mild renal impairment at baseline. A similar trend was evident for subjects who received active 
comparator, indicating that this difference is not necessarily attributable to treatment with 
alogliptin. Similarly, pruritus was the only TEAE of interest reported by ≥1% of subjects overall in 
the alogliptin 25 mg group for which the incidence in subjects with either mild or moderate renal 
impairment at baseline was at least twice that in subjects with normal renal function at baseline.  
Of the TEAEs reported by ≥1% of subjects with severe renal impairment in study 402, compared to 
placebo, alogliptin was associated with a similar percentage TEA’s (87.9 % vs. 87.9 %). As 
expected with multiple comparisons, some numerical imbalances remain with the updated data set, 
including events in which incidence was lower for alogliptin compared with placebo and those with 
an incidence higher for alogliptin compared with placebo. Among the most common TEAEs (≥5% 
incidence), a 2-fold difference between treatment groups was observed for anemia, urinary tract 
infection, and angina pectoris (higher for alogliptin) and diarrhea, edema peripheral, and blood 
creatine phosphokinase increased (higher for placebo). As additional pharmacovigilance activity the

cardiovascular outcome study 402 is further investigating effects in patients with renal impairment. 
The final study report is expected to be in the first quarter of 2014. 
The applicant did not apply for an indication of the FDC alogliptin/pioglitazone in T2DM patients with 
severe renal insufficiency.  
Subjects with Impaired Hepatic Function 
Results from phase 1 study 023 demonstrated that mild or moderate hepatic impairment did not 
affect exposure to alogliptin; therefore, subgroup analyses were not performed for hepatic function. 
The effect of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of alogliptin was not studied. As a 
result, use in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended in the SmPC. 
In line with the SmPC of pioglitazone, the FDC alogliptin/pioglitazone is contraindicated in patients 
with hepatic impairment. As additional pharmacovigilance activity the cardiovascular outcome 
study 402 is further investigating effects in patients with renal impairment. The final study report is 
expected to be in the first quarter of 2014. 
Interactions 
Alogliptin was devoid of any clinically meaningful drug or food interactions, which suggests a 
favourable safety profile in patients with T2DM who are likely to be receiving multiple concomitant 
medications. 
Post marketing experience 
Alogliptin was approved for use in the treatment of T2DM in Japan in April 2010 and commercially 
launched (6.25, 12.5, and 25 mg) in June 2010. The FDC Alogliptin/pioglitazone was approved for 
use in the treatment of T2DM in Japan in July 2011 and commercially launched (A25+P15 mg and 
A25+P30 mg) in September 2011. 
As of 15 October 2011, cumulative exposure for alogliptin is estimated to be 
117,359 patient-years. A total of 271 postmarketing cases were included in the 3 PSURs, 37 of 
which were serious. The most common events reported postmarketing were in the skin and 
subcutaneous disorders SOC (18 serious and 124 nonserious cases) and included 1 case of 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome.  
Hepatotoxicity was reported postmarketing in 5 cases. An independent committee concluded that 
the relationship between alogliptin and hepatotoxicity in three of the five cases was deemed “
probable” (50-74% probability) and in the remaining two was deemed “possible” (25-49% 
probability).  
There were 6 serious post marketing cases of acute pancreatitis (as of 27 October 2011). All except 
1 serious post marketing case had a possible alternative aetiology that likely precipitated the event. 
One fatal case of necrotizing pancreatitis was reported, which occurred in a patient with multiple 
gallbladder stones as evidenced by dilation of the extrahepatic common bile duct on autopsy. 
No new information affecting the safety profile of alogliptin has been identified post-tmarketing and 
no changes have been made to the Company Core Safety Information (CCSI). To date, no 
regulatory action has been taken by the Japanese regulatory authority with respect to safety 
labelling, which is based on the clinical trial program. 
CHMP assessment report

PSURs have been produced every 6 months since approval in Japan. Categories of medically 
significant adverse reactions reviewed within each PSUR include those relating to skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders, hypoglycaemia, pancreatitis, and hepatotoxicity. 
During the review period from launch of the alogliptin/pioglitazone FDC to the end of the PSUR 
review period (20 September 2011 to 15 October 2011), patient exposure was estimated to be 
7,215 patient-years based on volume of shipment. No spontaneous reports for the 
alogliptin/pioglitazone FDC were received during the review period. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Alogliptine + pioglitazone 
The safety profile of the FDC alogliptin/pioglitazone is derived from two main phase 3 clinical studies 
(009 and 322OPI-004) and from supportive studies. A total of 3504 subjects received at least 1 
dose of study drug in the alogliptin/pioglitazone studies. A total of 1908 subjects with T2DM 
received at least 1 dose of alogliptin with pioglitazone in the phase 3 studies. Treatment duration 
ranged from 16 to 52 weeks in the phase 3 studies and the majority of subjects in all studies 
completed treatment. A total of 195 subjects were exposed to alogliptin and pioglitazone in study 
322OPI-004 for 1 year. 
Alogliptin/pioglitazone was well tolerated in the study population to improve glycaemic control in 
patients with T2DM. The safety profile of alogliptin in combination with pioglitazone was shown to 
be consistent with known safety profiles of pioglitazone and the submitted pooled safety data of the 
alogliptin studies. 
Considering the limited number of clinical studies for this FDC, the focus of this assessment is also 
on the submitted safety data of the single components, which will be discussed below. Importantly, 
the currently available clinical safety data of the FDC is in line with the available clinical safety data 
of alogliptin and pioglitazone. This provides sufficient grounds to perform a full assessment for the 
FDC, even though the studies with co-administration of both medicines is limited. 
In the phase 3 studies for the FDC alogliptin/pioglitazone, the most commonly reported TEAEs 
(≥5% of subjects) in the combination grouping were oedema peripheral, nasopharyngitis, upper 
respiratory tract infection, influenza, urinary tract infection, headache, and hypertension. The 
majority or TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity and considered by the investigator to be not 
related to study drug. TEAEs tended to occur more often within the SOC of infections and 
infestations and the incidence was generally similar among treatment groups. Analysis of AE rates 
on A12.5+pio vs A25+pio groupings revealed small numerical increments in AE rates in the 
A25+pio grouping, which were not clinically relevant. 
In the alogliptin/pioglitazone clinical program, there were three deaths. These deaths occurred in 
subjects with known pre-existing CV risk factors. The incidences of treatment-emergent SAEs and 
TEAEs that led to discontinuation from the study were low and similar among the treatment groups, 
with no meaningful differences observed with respect to the specific types of events reported in the 
treatment groups. 
For alogliptin, special-interest AE assessments were conducted for hypoglycaemia, CV events, 
hypersensitivity reactions, acute pancreatitis, and malignancies. For pioglitazone, AE assessments 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 115/136 
 
  
  
were conducted for CV safety, cardiac failure, oedema, weight gain, bone fracture, and bladder 
cancer. For the special-interest AE hypoglycaemia, alogliptin 25 mg in combination with 
metformin and pioglitazone in study 322OPI-004, there was an increased rate of hypoglycaemic 
episodes. In study 009 (add-on to TZD), there was also a small increase in the rate of 
hypoglycaemic episodes in the alogliptin 25 mg group. This increased rate of hypoglycaemia in 
combination with TZD is clearly mentioned in the SmPC. There is no evidence to suggest that the 
combination of alogliptin and pioglitazone is associated with an increase in incidence or severity of 
any other AE of special interest. 
An evaluation of CV risk did not show an increased risk of major adverse CV events for pioglitazone 
or alogliptin. However, in studies 009 and 322OPI-004, the incidences of TEAEs in the SOC Cardiac 
disorders was higher in A25 mg (6.5%) and A12.5 (3.0%) vs. placebo (1.0%) in study 009 
respectively higher in MET+A25+P30 (6.2%) vs. MET + P45 (4.3%) in study 322OPI-004. The 
incidence of cardiac failure/ cardiac failure congestive was 1.5% (3 cases) in A25 vs. 0% in placebo 
in study 009 and 0.7% (3 cases) in MET+A25+P30 vs. 0.3% (1 case) in MET + P45 in study 
322OPI-004; although, the incidence of oedema was not increased in the ALO + PIO group 
compared to the PIO group in either of the studies. The applicant was requested to comment on the 
increased incidence of cardiac failure/cardiac failure congestive with pioglitazone in combination 
with alogliptin compared to pioglitazone in study 009 and 322OPI-004 respectively. The applicant 
has commented on that the incidence of cardiac failure in the subjects taking pioglitazone without 
alogliptin in study 009 and 322OPI-004 respectively was slightly lower than expected, which could 
be a plausible explanation. Furthermore, the incidence of cardiac failure in subjects administered 
alogliptin in combination with pioglitazone was summarized for the ‘Pivotal Phase III Alogliptin/ 
Pioglitazone Controlled Studies’. The incidence of cardiac failure (narrow-scope cardiac failure SMQ) 
in the A25+PIO group was low (6 subjects [0.5%]) and comparable to the pioglitazone alone 
grouping (4 subjects [0.4%]), which is considered reassuring although there were a few number of 
cases wherefore it is difficult to drew any firm conclusions. 
For the 2 main phase 3 studies, potential CV events were retrospectively adjudicated. Events 
adjudicated as MACE (CV death, nonfatal MI, and nonfatal stroke) showed that the incidence was 
low and generally similar across treatment groups, although no subjects on placebo reported a 
MACE. A cardiovascular outcome study (study 402), for which the final study report is expected in 
the first quarter of 2014, will provide additional information. 
Specific preferred terms such as anaemia achieve the 3% reporting threshold in 
alogliptin/pioglitazone Studies 009 and 322OPI-004 (3% and 3%, respectively) and oedema 
peripheral (4% and 5.5%, respectively) versus alogliptin monotherapy study 010 (0% and 3%, 
respectively). However, both preferred terms are labelled as common ADRs in the pioglitazone 
SmPC, suggesting an influence of pioglitazone on the reported AE profile, as would be expected. 
Alogliptin 
Overall, for alogliptin, a comprehensive clinical program was submitted comprising 55 clinical 
studies involving approximately 1000 healthy adult subjects and more than 11,000 adult subjects 
with T2DM. The patient population seems representative of the European population of diabetes 
patients. Two studies (study 305 and 402) were onging at the time of evaluation of this application.  
The most common TEAEs reported in ≥5% of subjects treated with alogliptin 25 mg and more 
frequently than in subjects who received placebo or active comparators were headache, 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 116/136 
 
  
  
nasopharyngitis, and upper respiratory tract infection. In comparison to other DPP-4 inhibitors, no 
potential new adverse events emerged. In order to increase the precision of adverse event rates 
and to achieve a higher validity, the applicant was requested during the procedure to generate a 
safety data pool containing all 7 pivotal Phase III studies (5 placebo-controlled and 2 
active-comparator studies) and to present a table of adverse events to be reflected in the tabulated 
list of adverse reactions for section 4.8 for the proposed SmPC. The applicant has provided the 
requested safety data pool containing all pivotal Phase III studies. It is agreed that the pattern of 
TEAEs in the pool ‘Pivotal Phase III Controlled Studies’ was similar to the pool ‘Controlled Phase 2 
and 3 Study Group’. The tabulated list of ADRs in SmPC section 4.8 was updated accordingly to 
reflect data from pooled Phase III studies instead of individual studies in accordance with the SmPC 
guideline.  
Serious adverse events were higher with alogliptin compared to placebo, but lower compared to 
active comparators. There was no discernible pattern in the type of adverse events. The applicant 
was requested to a more in depth discussion regarding the following 7 fatal cases, considered to be 
related to alogliptin treatment: 1 acute pancreatitis, 1 sudden death and 1 acute pulmonary 
oedema in the Controlled Phase 2/3 Group and 4 fatal cases with CV outcome in the study 012.  
After review of the cases, it is considered that these individual cases (seven classified as possibly 
related and one as not related) do not strongly reflect an association with alogliptin. Such events 
are expected in a population with T2DM and occurred at rates consistent with other studies. No 
apparent patterns, trends, were observed and it is considered that they do not indicate a new safety 
concern. Moreover, further results from the CV outcome study 402, for which a final study report is 
expected to be available during the first quarter of 2014, should allow a further in-depth 
characterisation of the CV profile of  alogliptin-containing products. 
Pre-defined special-interest AEs for alogliptin were CV (MACE), hypersensitivity reactions (severe 
cutaneous adverse reactions, angioedema, and anaphylaxis reactions), acute pancreatitis, and 
malignancies. 
Cardiovascular safety 
In the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group, when compared to placebo, alogliptin was associated 
with a higher cardiovascular event rate (Hazard ratio 1.33). However, in the Controlled Phase 2 and 
3 Study Group, cardiovascular event rate was lower compared to active comparators (Hazard ratio 
0.66). In addition, interim analyses of the cardiovascular outcome study demonstrated that 
alogliptin was associated with a lower cardiovascular risk (Hazard ratio 0.81). 
Owing to the differences in the number of events for MI (10 vs. 6), cardiac failure (7 vs. 1) and 
cardiac failure congestive (14 vs. 7) in the table presenting TAES vs. the table presenting serious 
TEAEs) in the SOC cardiac disorders, the CHMP did seek clarification during the procedure on the 
cases of cardiac failure and myocardial infarction designated as non serious. The applicant stated 
that there were 20 subjects in total in the alogliptin clinical studies who experienced adverse events 
(AEs) of cardiac failure/cardiac failure congestive (14 subjects) or myocardial infarction 
(6 subjects) in which the event had been classified by the investigator as non serious. The applicant 
did provide satisfactory details of the definition of SAEs, a clinical review of the available data that 
was performed and a rationale for the non serious designation. Similarly, reassuring descriptions 
were provided by the applicant for the cases of heart failure, and therefore the CHMP considered 
this concern as being resolved.

Hypersensitivity reactions  
Safety results for alogliptin indicate a low incidence of hypersensitivity reactions. Nevertheless, 13 
patients (0.2%) developed an anaphylactic reaction during alogliptin, whereas no patient 
developed an anaphylactic reaction during treatment with placebo. During post marketing 
surveillance in Japan, skin disorders, including Stevens Johnson, were reported. Consistent with 
labelling for other DPP-4 inhibitors such reactions should be mentioned in section 4.4 Special 
warnings and precautions for use of the SmPC. 
Pancreatitis 
The frequency of pancreatitis events is low, but alogliptin was associated with a higher risk for 
pancreatitis in comparison to comparators. Several cases of pancreatitis were reported 
post-marketing of which one was fatal. Given the increased risk of pancreatitis reported with other 
DPP-4 inhibitors, the risk of pancreatitis is included as Warning and Precautions in the SmPC, 
Section 4.4, and acute pancreatitis is listed as an adverse reaction in Post-marketing Reports in the 
SmPC, Section 4.8.  Moreover, new pancreatitis data have been integrated during the procedure 
and hence pancreatitis is now included as an identified risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
Malignancies 
There is no safety signal for malignancies with alogliptin. Therefore, no special warning/precaution 
is necessary for malignancies. 
Pancreatic Cancer 
Uncertainties remained during the procedure regarding effects of alogliptin on the pancreas, as long 
term safety data are limited. Besides, during the procedure data had been published that gave rise 
to additional concerns on inflammatory and proliferative pancreatic effects of the therapy with 
another DPP-4 inhibitor, sitagliptin, (Butler et al. Diabetes, March 2013). Therefore the applicant 
was asked during the assessment procedure to provide further analyses with regard to pancreatic 
risk. 
In the controlled clinical studies, including the long-term studies OPI-004 (52 weeks) and 
305 (104 weeks), there were no TEAEs of pancreatic cancer in alogliptin treatment groups. A PV 
database search found that 5 subjects had pancreatic cancer events that occurred outside of the 
study treatment period. As of November 2012, in Study 402, there were no TEAEs of pancreatic 
cancer. In uncontrolled studies, the incidence rates of pancreatic cancer associated with the use of 
alogliptin were low and considered to be consistent with the incidence expected in the T2DM 
population.  
Based on these additional data the CHMP considered that there was no clear evidence for an 
association of pancreatic cancer and alogliptin treatment. Nevertheless, CHMP considered that a 
targeted follow-up is needed. This has now been reflected in the RMP as ‘Pancreatic cancer’ has 
been included as an important potential risk (in line with the recommendation given by CHMP at the 
July 2013 meeting for this class of products in the conclusions of the Art. 5(3) referral for GLP 1 
based therapies). 
Hypoglycaemia 
There was no increase in hypoglycaemia rate vs placebo when alogliptin 25 mg was administered 
alone, added on to SU, or added on to metformin. In the case of alogliptin 25 mg used to form triple 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 118/136 
 
  
  
therapy with metformin and pioglitazone in study 322OPI-004, there was an increased rate of 
hypoglycaemic episodes. In study 009 (add-on to TZD), there was a small increase in the rate of 
hypoglycaemic episodes in the alogliptin 25 mg group. In study 011 (add-on to insulin, with or 
without metformin), the incidence of hypoglycaemic episodes was higher with alogliptin 25 mg vs 
placebo. This increased rate of hypoglycaemia in combination with metformin/TZD and insulin is 
clearly mentioned in the SmPC. 
Vital signs and ECG  
There were no relevant changes in vital signs and ECG. There were no relevant changes in 
laboratory findings. 
Subgroups 
In patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency, no safety signals were observed with 
alogliptin. The number of patients with severe renal insufficiency in the pivotal studies was 
negligible. In the cardiovascular outcome study 402, a number of patients with severe renal 
insufficiency were included. Of the TEAEs reported by ≥ 1% of subjects with severe renal 
impairment, compared to placebo, alogliptin was associated with a similar percentage TEA’s (87.9 
% vs. 87.9%). The applicant does not apply for an indication in patients with severe renal 
impairment for the FDC alogliptin/pioglitazone. For T2DM patients with moderate renal impairment, 
a lower dose of alogliptin in the FDC tablet (12.5 mg alogliptin/30 mg or 45 mg pioglitazone) is 
proposed. This is in line with the proposed alogliptin (Vipidia) dose. 
No safety signals for alogliptin were observed in subgroup populations stratified by age. Some 
adverse events were more common with alogliptin in elderly individuals. However, the number of 
patients was limited, and the differences between alogliptin and placebo were small. Overall, no 
safety signals were observed with alogliptin in subgroup populations stratified by race. In addition, 
no safety signals were observed with alogliptin in subgroup populations stratified by BMI. 
Patients with hepatic disease were excluded in the phase 2 and 3 studies. In a pharmacokinetic 
study in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, there were no adverse events and no clinically 
meaningful changes in laboratory tests were reported. However, the use of alogliptin in patients 
with severe hepatic impairment can not be recommended. In addition, five cases of hepatotoxicity, 
including one case of hepatic failure were  reported postmarketing. An independent committee 
concluded that the relationship between alogliptin and hepatotoxicity in three of the five cases was 
deemed “probable” (50-74% probability) and in the remaining two was deemed “possible” 
(25-49% probability). Although no causal relationship between alogliptin and hepatic dysfunction 
has been established,these 5 cases provide important knowledge about the risks of alogliptin in 
clinical practice. Therefore, hepatic dysfunction has been included in the SmPC in section 4.4 
(warnings and precautions) and 4.8 (undesirable effects). Furthermore, hepatotoxicity is included 
in the RMP as important potential risk.. 
Drug interactions  
No dose adjustment is required due to drug interactions.

Pioglitazone 
The safety profile of pioglitazone has been well established based on pre and post approval clinical 
studies conducted in ≥27,000 subjects and over 10 years of post- marketing experience. All safety 
issues are sufficiently addressed in the SmPC and in the Risk Management Plan. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
In comparison to other DPP-4 inhibitors, no potential new adverse events emerged for the alogliptin 
component.  
Regarding the pioglitazone component, the safety profile of pioglitazone is well established and 
includes the risk for bladder cancer, as available epidemiological data suggests a small increase of 
this risk, and fluid retention, which may exacerbate or precipitate heart failure. Cardiac failure is an 
identified risk for pioglitazone and is contraindicated in patients with cardiac failure or a history of 
cardiac failure (NYHA class I-IV) and information is included in section 4.3 and 4.4 of the SmPC for 
alogliptin/pioglitazone. 
For the FDC alogliptin/pioglitazone, the only additional potential safety risk is the higher incidence 
in hypoglycaemic events, compared to the single components, which is addressed in the product 
information. 
For the FDC alogliptin/pioglitazone, no indication for T2DM patients with severe renal insufficiency 
was proposed by the applicant. For T2DM patients with moderate renal impairment a dose reduction 
of 12.5 mg alogliptin was proposed (in line with alogliptin used as monocomponent) in combination 
with pioglitazone 30 or 45 mg. This is reflected in the SmPC of the FDC alogliptin/pioglitazone. 
Hypersensitivity reactions and pancreatitis are mentioned in the SmPC. Because of the cases of 
hepatotoxicity observed post-marketing in Japan, hepatotoxicity is mentioned in the SmPC. Since 
pioglitazone is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment, the FDC alogliptin/pioglitazone 
can not be used in these patients.  
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the 
legislative requirements.    
2.8.  Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 120/136 
 
  
  
 
PRAC Advice 
Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 4.0, the PRAC considers by 
consensus that the risk management system for alogliptin/pioglitazone (Incresync) is acceptable. 
Proposed indication: 
Incresync is indicated as a second or third line treatment in adult patients aged 18 years and older 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus: 
 
as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adult patients (particularly 
overweight patients) inadequately controlled on pioglitazone alone, and for whom metformin is 
inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance. 
 
in combination with metformin (i.e. triple combination therapy) as an adjunct to diet and 
exercise to improve glycaemic control in adult patients (particularly overweight patients) 
inadequately controlled on their maximal tolerated dose of metformin and pioglitazone. 
In addition, Incresync can be used to replace separate tablets of alogliptin and pioglitazone in those 
adult patients aged 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus already being treated with this 
combination. 
After initiation of therapy with Incresync, patients should be reviewed after 3 to 6 months to assess 
adequacy of response to treatment (e.g. reduction in HbA1c). In patients who fail to show an 
adequate response, Incresync should be discontinued. In light of potential risks with prolonged 
pioglitazone therapy, prescribers should confirm at subsequent routine reviews that the benefit of 
Incresync is maintained (see section 4.4). 
Advice on conditions of the marketing authorisation  
The PRAC advises that the following should be conditions of the Marketing Authorisation: 
Risk management system  
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
  At the request of the European Medicines Agency;  
  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached. 
If the submission of a PSUR and the update of a RMP coincide, they can be submitted at the same 
time.

Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal 
product 
Additional risk minimisation measures: 
The MAH shall provide an educational pack targeting all physicians who are expected to 
prescribe/use alogliptin/pioglitazone. Prior to distribution in each Member State, the MAH must 
agree the content and format of the educational material, together with a communication plan, with 
the national competent authority. 
 
This educational pack is aimed at strengthening awareness of the important identified risks of 
bladder cancer and heart failure and the overall recommendations intended to optimise the 
benefit-risk balance at the patient level.  
 
The physician educational pack should contain: the Summary of Product Characteristics, the 
Package Leaflet and a Prescriber Guide. 
The Prescriber Guide should highlight the following:

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed risk 
minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed 
indication(s). 
In addition the PRAC considered that the applicant should address the following points 
 
 
Pancreatic cancer should be included in the RMP as missing information 
Pancreatic cancer should be added as an adverse event of special interest in the CV outcome 
study 402.   
The CHMP endorsed this advice with changes. 
These changes concerned the following elements of the Risk Management Plan: 
 
Pancreatic cancer should be included in the RMP as an important potential risk   
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 125/136 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
The CHMP justified these changes as follows: 
The Article 5 (3) referral procedure assessing the available data concerning the potential 
relationship between pancreatic cancer and GLP-1 agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors treatment, was 
concluded during July 2013 CHMP meeting. In line with the recommendation given by CHMP in the 
conclusion of the above mentioned Art. 5(3) referral procedure, “pancreatic cancer” should be seen 
as an important potential risk associated with alogliptin treatment and reflected as such in all 
alogliptin containing products’ RMPs. 
All issues identified by the PRAC and the CHMP were properly addressed by the applicant and an 
updated RMP version 5 was submitted. 
The CHMP endorsed the updated RMP without changes. 
2.9.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by 
the applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the 
Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Incresync is a Fixed Dose Combination of a new DPP-4 inhibitor, alogliptin, and the PPAR-γ agonist 
pioglitazone. 
Benefits  
Beneficial effects 
Pharmacokinetics 
The applicant performed several clinical pharmacology studies to show the pharmacokinetics of 
alogliptin and pioglitazone, separately and combined, demonstrating no significant interaction. For 
the fixed dose combination (FDC) product one pivotal bioavailability study and one pivotal food 
effect studies were submitted. In study 322OPI-101, the pivotal BE study, bioequivalence was 
shown for the commercial FDC product when dosed orally as the highest proposed dosage strength 
(Alogliptin 25 mg +Pioglitazone 45 mg) formulation and lowest dosage strength (Alogliptin 12.5 mg 
+Pioglitazone 15 mg), compared with the individual alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets.  
The food interaction study (322OPI-006) with highest dosage strength (Alogliptin 25 mg 
+Pioglitazone 45 mg) of the commercial formulation of the FDC product (alogliptin/pioglitazone BL) 
did not show any influence of food on the pharmacokinetics of pioglitazone and alogliptin. This was 
supported by food interaction studies 322-4833/CPH-001 and 322-4833/CPH-002 in Japanese 
subjects. 
Study 017 showed that when alogliptin and pioglitazone (CYP2C8 substrate) were co-administered, 
no changes in the exposures to alogliptin, pioglitazone, or pioglitazone metabolites were observed. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 126/136 
 
  
  
Clinical 
For the FDC four clinical trials were submitted: two pivotal studies (009 and 322OPI-004) and two 
supportive studies (322OPI-001 and 322OPI-002). In pivotal study 009, in which alogliptin was 
added to TZD with or without metformin, alogliptin 25 mg was associated with a reduction in HbA1c 
of -0.61% (95% CI -0.80 to -0.41) after 26 weeks in comparison to placebo. Treatment effects were 
clinically relevant for both alogliptin 25 mg in combination with TZD only (-0.49%) and in 
combination with TZD and metformin (-0.72%). In addition, in study 322OPI-004, the effects of 
adding alogliptin 25 mg were non-inferior compared with increasing the dose of pioglitazone from 
30 to 45 mg. 
In supportive study 322OPI-001, in patients inadequately controlled with metformin, each 
individual combination of alogliptin + pioglitazone achieved larger reductions in HbA1c at Week 26 
compared with the corresponding alogliptin and pioglitazone doses given alone. These differences 
were clinically relevant. The initial combination of alogliptin and pioglitazone (study 322OPI-002) 
was associated with a reduction in HbA1c that was larger than that with alogliptin and pioglitazone 
monotherapy. These data provide further support for the use of alogliptin in combination with 
pioglitazone with or without metformin; initial combination therapy was not applied for by the 
applicant but also cannot be recommended as this is not in line with current diabetes treatment 
guidelines. 
In addition to the specific combination trials of alogliptin with pioglitazone, efficacy and safety of 
alogliptin were studied in an extensive number of double blind randomized trials, including trials 
with placebo and active comparators, and in combination with several other glucose lowering 
agents. HbA1c was used as the primary endpoint. In the placebo controlled studies, the treatment 
effect of alogliptin was modest (0.5-0.6%), but clinically relevant and thus supported the 
corresponding marketing atuhorisation application of alogliptin.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The number of subjects in the FDC studies was limited.  
In study 009, where alogliptin was used as add-on therapy to a thiazolidinedionie,  no difference in 
efficacy between subjects < 65 year and those ≥65 years was observed, although the numbers 
were small (n=71). Similarly, in the pivotal trials with alogliptin, the treatment effect of alogliptin 
was not lower in patients >65 years compared to patients <65 years. However, only 2% of the 
patients treated with alogliptin were >75 years of age (n=124).  
A study in elderly individuals showed non-inferiority of alogliptin 25 mg vs. glipizide, however with 
a decrease of power due to low baseline HbA1c values.  Importantly, results of the large pooled 
analysis of 2234 subjects from the 5 main phase 3, 26 week, placebo-controlled studies with 
alogliptin demonstrate relevant efficacy in the elderly. In patients aged  ≥75 years alogliptin was 
associated with a treatment effect of -0.49% (95% CI-1.03, 0.06). However, the study was not 
performed specifically for the combined use of alogliptin and pioglitazone. Nevertheless, results 
from the 2 main phase 3, active-controlled studies supporting this application for 
alogliptin/pioglitazone (total of 237 elderly subjects) demonstrated also that HbA1c reductions at 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 127/136 
 
  
  
 
week 52 were greater in subjects ≥ 65 years compared with subjects <65 years, although data 
interpretation in subjects ≥ 75 years is limited by the small numbers of subjects.  
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
For the FDC alogliptin/pioglitazone two main studies were submitted. In these phase 3 studies, the 
most commonly reported TEAEs (≥5% of subjects) in the combination grouping were oedema 
peripheral, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, influenza, urinary tract infection, 
headache, and hypertension. The majority or TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity and 
considered by the investigator to be not related to study drug. TEAEs tended to occur more often 
within the SOC of infections and infestations and the incidence was generally similar among 
treatment groups. Analysis of AE rates on alogliptin 12.5 mg + pioglitazone vs alogliptin 25 mg + 
pioglitazone groupings revealed small numerical increments in AE rates in the alogliptin 25 mg + 
pioglitazone grouping, which were not clinically relevant. 
In study 322OPI-004, there was an approximate tripling of rate of hypoglycaemic episodes (4.5%) 
for patients on alogliptin + pioglitazone + MET treatment vs dual therapy with MET and a higher 
dose of pioglitazone (1.5%). A similar trend was also seen in study 322OPI-001, which compared 
pioglitazone and alogliptin alone and in combination as add-on therapy to MET, but with lower 
incidence rates. In study 009 (add-on to TZD), there were more hypoglycaemic episodes in the 
alogliptin 25 mg group (7.0%) compared to the placebo group (5.2%). 
Regarding the mono components, the safety profile of pioglitazone is well established and includes 
the risk for bladder cancer, as cases of bladder cancer were reported more frequently in a 
meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials with pioglitazone, and available epidemiological data 
suggests a small increased risk of bladder cancer in diabetic patients treated with pioglitazone. 
Pioglitazone can also cause fluid retention, which may exacerbate or precipitate heart failure and is 
therefore contraindicated in heart failure (NYHA classes I-IV). 
Regarding alogliptin, the following unfavouralbe effects associated with the use of alogliptin: 
Hypersensitivity reactions  
Safety results for alogliptin indicate a low incidence of hypersensitivity reactions. Nevertheless, 13 
patients (0.2%) developed an anaphylactic reaction during alogliptin, whereas no patient 
developed an anaphylactic reaction during treatment with placebo. During postmarketing 
surveillance in Japan, skin disorders, including Stevens Johnson, were reported. Consistent with 
labeling for other DPP-4 inhibitors such reactions are now mentioned in the SmPC. 
Pancreatitis 
The frequency of pancreatitis events is low, but alogliptin was associated with a higher risk for 
pancreatitis in comparison to comparators. Several cases of pancreatitis were reported 
postmarketing of which one was fatal. Given the increased risk of pancreatitis reported with other 
DPP-4 inhibitors, the risk of pancreatitis is included as Warning and Precautions in the SmPC, 
Section 4.4, and acute pancreatitis is listed as an adverse reaction in Postmarketing Reports in the 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 128/136 
 
  
  
SmPC, Section 4.8. Moreover, pancreatitis is now included as an identified risk in the Risk 
Management Plan. 
Malignancies 
There is no safety signal for malignancies with alogliptin. Therefore, no special warning/precaution 
is necessary for malignancies. 
Based on all available data the CHMP considered that there was no clear evidence for an association 
of pancreatic cancer and alogliptin treatment. Nevertheless, ‘Pancreatic cancer’ has been included 
in the Risk Management Plan as an important potential risk (in line with the recommendation given 
by CHMP at the July 2013 meeting for this class of products in the conclusions of the Art. 5(3) 
referral for GLP 1 based therapies). 
Hypoglycaemia 
There was no increase in hypoglycaemia rate vs placebo when alogliptin 25 mg was administered 
alone, or added on to metformin. In Study 009 (add-on to TZD), there was a small increase in the 
rate of hypoglycaemic episodes in the alogliptin 25 mg group. In the case of alogliptin 25 mg used 
to form triple therapy with metformin and pioglitazone in study 322OPI-004, there was an increased 
rate of hypoglycaemic episodes.  
Subgroups 
No safety signals for alogliptin were observed in subgroup populations stratified by age. Some 
adverse events were more common with alogliptin in elderly individuals. However, the number of 
patients was limited, and the differences between alogliptin and placebo were small. Overall, no 
safety signals were observed with alogliptin in subgroup populations stratified by race. In addition, 
no safety signals were observed with alogliptin in subgroup populations stratified by BMI. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The number of subjects in the FDC studies was limited leaving some uncertainty regarding the exact 
safety profile of the combination therapy alogliptin plus pioglitazone, which was further addressed 
during the procedure. In the two main FDC trials, there was a numerically higher incidence in CV 
outcome. However, the numbers were very low. The same was true for all alogliptin studies 
together. Alogliptin, when compared to placebo, was associated with a higher cardiovascular event 
rate (Hazard ratio 1.33). However, in the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group, cardiovascular 
event rate was lower compared to active comparators (Hazard ratio 0.8). In addition, interim 
analyses of the cardiovascular outcome study (study 402) demonstrated that alogliptin was 
associated with a lower cardiovascular risk (Hazard ratio 0.81). 
Pioglitazone use is associtated with the following uncertainties: 
Cardiac failure is an identified risk for pioglitazone and pioglitazone is contraindicated in patients 
with cardiac failure or a history of cardiac failure (I-IV) and information is included in section 4.4 of 
the proposed SmPC for Incresync. Furthermore, cardiovascular ischaemic disease is considered as 
a potential risk for pioglitazone and is included in the proposed RMP.  
With regards to alogliptin the following uncertainties were observed.

Patients with renal insufficiency 
In patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency, no safety signals were observed with 
alogliptin. The number of patients with severe renal insufficiency in the pivotal studies was 
negligible. In the cardiovascular outcome study, 87 patients with severe renal insufficiency were 
studied for 6 months (43 treated with alogliptin and 44 treated with placebo). Of the TEAEs reported 
by ≥ 1% of subjects with severe renal impairment, compared to placebo, alogliptin was associated 
with a similar percentage TEA’s (87.9 % vs. 87.9%).  
Patients with hepatic disease  
Patients with hepatic disease were excluded in the phase 2 and 3 studies. In a pharmacokinetic 
study in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, there were no adverse events and no clinically 
meaningful changes in laboratory tests reported. Patients with severe hepatic impairment were not 
investigated. In addition, five cases of hepatotoxicity, including one case of hepatic failure, were  
reported postmarketing in Japan.  An independent committee concluded that the relationship 
between alogliptin and hepatotoxicity in three of the five cases was deemed “probable” (50-74% 
probability) and in the remaining two was deemed “possible” (25-49% probability). Although no 
causal relationship between alogliptin and hepatic dysfunction has been established,these 5 cases 
provide important knowledge about the risks of alogliptin in clinical practice. Therefore, hepatic 
dysfunction has been included in the SmPC in section 4.4 (warnings and precautions) and 4.8 
(undesirable effects). Furthermore, hepatotoxicity is included in the RMP as important potential 
risk. 
Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Overall, alogliptin demonstrates a clinically and statistically significant treatment effect as dual and 
triple combination therapy with pioglitazone ±MET and as monotherapy. The treatment effect is 
generally consistent for primary and secondary efficacy variables, and appears maintained over 
time. The combination was not associated with weight gain, and there were no detrimental effects 
on blood pressure and serum lipids. The selected doses for the fixed-dose combination studies are 
in line with the doses evaluated in the clinical studies and in accordance with clinical practice. 
The main goal of treatment of diabetes is the prevention of cardiovascular events. HbA1c is only a 
surrogate endpoint. The effect of alogliptin on cardiovascular events is not clear. Nevertheless, 
interim analyses of the cardiovascular outcome study (study 402) demonstrated that alogliptin was 
associated with a lower cardiovascular risk (Hazard ratio 0.81). A final study report is expected to 
be available during the first quarter of 2014.  
Alogliptin was associated with several relatively minor adverse events, such as headache, 
nasopharyngitis, and upper respiratory tract infection. In comparison to other DPP-4 inhibitors, no 
potential new adverse events emerged. Similar to other DPP-4 inhibitors, alogliptin is associated

with pancreatitis. However, these events were rare, and consistent with labeling for other DPP-4 
inhibitors these risks can be mentioned in the SmPC (4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use).  
DPP-4 inhibitors in general have been associated with a potential risk of developing acute 
pancreatitis. Similar to other DPP-4 inhibitors, alogliptin is associated with pancreatitis. In addition, 
there have been spontaneously reported adverse reactions of acute pancreatitis with alogliptin in 
the postmarketing setting in Japan. However, these events were rare, and consistent with labeling 
for other DPP-4 the risk of pancreatitis is included as Warning and Precautions in the SmPC, 
Section 4.4, and acute pancreatitis is listed as an adverse reaction in Postmarketing Reports in 
SmPC, Section 4.8.  Pancreatitis is included as an identified risk in the Risk Management Plan, into 
which new pancreatitis data has been integrated during the procedure. 
The risk of hypoglycaemia for alogliptin in combination with metformin and SU is only slightly 
increased. 
There is insufficient knowledge about efficacy and safety in patients with severe hepatic disease. 
The use of alogliptin in patients with severe hepatic impairment can not be recommended. This is 
stated in the SmPC. In addition, hepatotoxicity was reported postmarketing in Japan.  A relation 
with treatment with alogliptin cannot be ruled out but the hepatic safety database for the controlled 
clinical trials is considered reassuring. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Considering  the  consistent  clinically  and  statistically  significant  treatment  effect  observed  with 
alogliptin in the monotherapy study, the add-on to oral therapy study and the long-term active 
comparator study, the benefit risk balance of the alogliptin/pioglitazone FDC is  considered postive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by majority 
decision that the risk-benefit balance of Incresync is favourable in the “second or third line 
treatment of adult patients aged 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus: 
 
as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in adult patients (particularly 
overweight patients) inadequately controlled on pioglitazone alone, and for whom metformin is 
inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance. 
 
in combination with metformin (i.e. triple combination therapy) as an adjunct to diet and 
exercise to improve glycaemic control in adult patients (particularly overweight patients) 
inadequately controlled on their maximal tolerated dose of metformin and pioglitazone. 
In addition, Incresync can be used to replace separate tablets of alogliptin and pioglitazone in those 
adult patients aged 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus already being treated with this 
combination. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/208477/2013 
Page 131/136 
 
  
  
After initiation of therapy with Incresync, patients should be reviewed after 3 to 6 months to assess 
adequacy of response to treatment (e.g. reduction in HbA1c). In patients who fail to show an 
adequate response, Incresync should be discontinued. In light of potential risks with prolonged 
pioglitazone therapy, prescribers should confirm at subsequent routine reviews that the benefit of 
Incresync is maintained (see section 4.4).” 
Therefore the CHMP recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the 
following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal products subject to medical prescription. 
Conditions and requirements of the Marketing Authorisation  
  Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this 
product within 6 months following authorisation. Subsequently, the marketing authorisation holder 
shall submit periodic safety update reports for this product in accordance with the requirements set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal 
product 
  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the  
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed  subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted: 
At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
When the submission of a PSUR and the update of a RMP coincide, they should be submitted at the 
same time. 
  Additional risk minimisation measures  
The MAH shall provide an educational pack targeting all physicians who are expected to 
prescribe/use alogliptin/pioglitazone. Prior to distribution of the prescriber guide in each Member 
State, the MAH must agree the content and format of the educational material, together with a 
communication plan, with the national competent authority.

 
This educational pack is aimed at strengthening awareness of the important identified risks of 
bladder cancer and heart failure and the overall recommendations intended to optimise the 
benefit-risk balance at the patient level. 
 
The physician educational pack should contain: the Summary of Product Characteristics, the 
package leaflet and a prescriber Guide. 
The Prescriber Guide should highlight the following: 
 
Patient selection criteria including that alogliptin/pioglitazone should not be used as first line 
therapy and emphasising the need for regular review of treatment benefit. 
 
 
The risk of bladder cancer and relevant risk minimisation advice. 
The risk of heart failure and relevant risk minimisation advice. 
  Caution on using in the elderly due to the age related increased risks (in particular bladder 
cancer, fractures and heart failure). 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of data on the quality properties of the active substance, the CHMP 
considers that alogliptin is qualified as a new active substance.

Divergent Position 
We have a divergent opinion on the above mentioned Marketing Authorisation from that which has 
been adopted by the CHMP during its July 2013 session: 
 We consider that pioglitazone being of a negative benefit-risk ratio, any combination containing 
this same drug has necessarily a negative benefit-risk ratio as well.  
 This is due to the increased risk of bladder  cancer  in  addition to the other well known adverse 
effects  (especially  heart  failure  and  bone  fracture)  of  this  medicine,  its  questionable  long  term 
benefit  in  terms  of  cardiovascular  protection  and  the  available  alternative  treatments  in  type  2 
diabetic patients. 
Regarding bladder cancer, it was concluded by the CHMP in July 2011 that the small increased risk 
of  bladder  cancer  could  be  reduced  by  appropriate  patient  selection  and  exclusion,  including  a 
requirement for periodic review of the efficacy and safety of the individual patient's treatment.  
However, we observe that there is still a very substantial increase in the number of bladder cancer 
cases  reported  worldwide  during  the  last  6-month  period  (01 /08/2012  to  31/01/2013) 
covering   by  PSUR  76:  1780  medically  confirmed cases  (3000  cumulatively)  and  3162 
non-medically  confirmed  cases (cumulatively  4925)  mostly  from  US,  despite  risk  minimization 
measures. Furthermore results of the Drug Utilisation Study are inconclusive in terms of adherence 
to minimisation activities and to the performance of a benefit monitoring under treatment. 
This increased number of bladder cancer is one among a range of factors to be considered in the 
negative benefit-risk of pioglitazone: 
  The sole beneficial effect of pioglitazone is its glucose reducing effect (a recognized marker 
of microvascular complications), which is similar to other oral antidiabetic drugs, such as 
sulphonylureas.  Pioglitazone  has  not demonstrated  a   cardiovascular  benefit,  it  is 
considered as neutral on cardiovascular complications, despite an increase of congestive 
heart failure associated with its use.  
  According to PROactive long term follow up and utilisation studies, a large proportion of 
patients stop pioglitazone treatment within the first years of treatment precluding potential 
long term benefit on prevention of cardiovascular events. The identified increased bladder 
cancer risk is likely to reduce adherence to pioglitazone long-term treatment.  
  Several other serious risks have already been identified, as cardiac failure, weight increase, 
bone fractures and macular oedema.  
 Thus,  it appears  impossible  to  define  a  subpopulation  of  diabetic  patients that  could  benefit  of 
pioglitazone or any combination containing this same drug.

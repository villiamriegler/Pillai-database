Summary of Risk Management Plan for Rozlytrek (Entrectinib) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Rozlytrek. The RMP details 
important risks of Rozlytrek, how these risks can be minimized, and how more 
information will be obtained about Rozlytrek risks and uncertainties (missing 
information). 
Rozlytrek SmPC and its package leaflet give essential information to healthcare 
professionals and patients on how Rozlytrek should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Rozlytrek should be read in the context of all this 
information, including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Rozlytrek RMP. 
THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR 
I. 
Rozlytrek is authorized for the treatment of NTRK fusion-positive locally advanced or 
metastatic solid tumors and ROS1-positive, advanced non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) (see SmPC for the full indication).  It contains entrectinib as the active 
substance, and it is given by oral administration. 
Further information about the evaluation of Rozlytrek benefits can be found in 
Rozlytrek’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA Web 
site, under the medicine’s Web page. 
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES TO 
II. 
MINIMIZE OR FURTHER CHARACTERIZE THE RISKS 
Important risks of Rozlytrek, together with measures to minimize such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about Rozlytrek risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, 
in the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare 
professionals 
• 
• 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging 
The authorized pack size:  the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so as to 
ensure that the medicine is used correctly. 
The medicine’s legal status:  the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., 
with or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk-minimization measures.  
 
 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected 
continuously and regularly analyzed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate 
action can be taken as necessary.  These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Rozlytrek is not yet available, it is 
listed under “missing Information” below. 
II.A  List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of Rozlytrek are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
taken.  Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks are 
concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Rozlytrek.  Potential 
risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible 
based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs 
further evaluation.  Missing information refers to information about the safety of the 
medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-
term use of the medicine).

II.B  Summary of Important Risks 
Important Identified Risk:  Fractures 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Evidence is based on the safety data from two Phase I/Ib 
studies (GO40783 [ALKA], GO40784 [STARTRK-1]) one 
Phase I/II CO40778 [STARTRK-NG]) and one Phase II 
study (GO40782 [STARTRK-2]) of entrectinib, in adults, 
adolescents, and children (504 patients) with, ROS1, 
NTRK1/2/3 or ALK alterations or fusions who received at 
least one dose of entrectinib 
In adult patients, the most common cause of fractures 
appears to be by accidental injury.  It is known that 
entrectinib may cause dizziness and ataxia in patients, 
though this seemed to be a factor in few of the falls leading 
to the fractures.

Important Identified Risk:  Congestive Heart Failure 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Evidence is based on the safety data from two Phase I/Ib 
studies (GO40783 [ALKA], GO40784 [STARTRK-1]) one 
Phase I/II (CO40778 [STARTRK-NG]) and one Phase II 
study (GO40782 [STARTRK-2]) of entrectinib, in adults, 
adolescents, and children (504 patients) with, ROS1, 
NTRK1/2/3 or ALK alterations or fusions who received at 
least one dose of entrectinib 
Risk factors and risk groups  Risk factors of heart failure include a medical history of 
coronary artery disease including a previous myocardial 
infarction, age 65 years, smoking, body mass index  
27 kg/m2, sedentary life style, abnormality in lipidi profile, 
hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, valvular heart 
disease, alcohol abuse, infection, and cardiomyopathy of 
an unknown cause  
In addition, prior cancer treatments including the most 
commonly used chemotherapy agents (e.g., anthacyclines, 
cyclophosphamide and radiation therapy) and biologic and 
targeted therapy drugs, can induce cardiac disorders

Important Identified Risk:  QT Prolongation 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Evidence is based on the safety data from two Phase I/Ib 
studies (GO40783 [ALKA], GO40784 [STARTRK-1]), one 
Phase I/II study (CO40778 [STARTRK-NG]) and one 
Phase II study (GO40782 [STARTRK-2]) of entrectinib, in 
adults, adolescents, and children (504patients) with, 
ROS1, NTRK1/2/3 or ALK alterations or fusions who 
received at least one dose of entrectinib 
Risk factors and risk groups  QTc prolongation appears to occur more frequently in 
females. Inherited genetic polymorphisms or mutations 
with low penetrance, involving the same gene loci 
associated with phenotypically expressed long-QT 
syndrome, may underlie individual idiosyncrasies to the 
acquired form in many, if not most, cases. Some 
individuals have QT prolongation throughout life without 
any manifest arrhythmias, while others are highly 
susceptible to symptomatic arrhythmias, particularly 
torsades de pointes. 
Risk factors for QTc prolongation may also include 
patients with pre-existing conditions such as history of 
cardiac dysrhythmia, electrolyte disturbances, cardiac 
ischemia, and the concomitant use of medications with the 
potential to prolong QTc.  
Risk-minimization measures  Routine risk-minimization measures:

prolongation) and Section 4.8 (undesirable effects) provide 
recommendations on risk management approach

Important Potential Risk:  Severe Neurological Reactions  
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Evidence is based on the safety data from two Phase I/Ib 
studies (GO40783 [ALKA], GO40784 [STARTRK-1]), one 
Phase I/II study (CO40778 [STARTRK-NG]) and one 
Phase II study (GO40782 [STARTRK-2]) of entrectinib, in 
adults, adolescents, and children (504patients) with, 
ROS1, NTRK1/2/3 or ALK alterations or fusions who 
received at least one dose of entrectinib 
Risk factors and risk groups  Patients with metastatic brain tumours can develop 
substantial cognitive disability, but the extent and type of 
cognitive dysfunction often varies from patient to patient 
because of differential tumour volume and location. In the 
entrectinib clinical trial programme, 96.3% of patients had 
metastatic disease and 22.2% had CNS metastases at 
baseline per investigator assessment. Chemotherapy-
induced cognitive dysfunction is a common side effect and 
cause of morbidity in cancer patients and the majority 
(85.2%) of patients receiving entrectinib were previously 
treated with chemotherapy. Memory, attention, 
psychomotor function, processing speed, and executive 
function appear to be commonly affected.  
Risk-minimization measures  Routine risk-minimization measures:  
SmPC Sections 4.2 (Dose modifications), 4.4 (Cognitive 
disorders) and 4.7 (Effects on ability to drive and use 
machines), provide recommendations on risk management

Important Potential Risk:  Neuro-developmental impairment in paediatric patients 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Evidence is based on a 13-week juvenile rat toxicology 
study animals were dosed daily from post-natal day 7 to 
day 97 (approximately equivalent to neonate to adulthood 
in humans). In addition to CNS and skin effects, and 
decreased RBC parameters,  effects on growth and 
development were observed in the dosing and recovery 
phases including decreased body weight gain and delayed 
sexual maturation (at ≥ 4 mg/kg/day, approximately 0.1 
times the human exposure by AUC at the recommended 
dose), deficits in neurobehavioral assessments including 
functional observational battery and learning and memory 
(at ≥ 8 mg/kg/day, approximately 0.2 times the human 
exposure by AUC at the recommended dose).  
Risk factors and risk groups  Young children treated with entrectinib for an extended 
duration up to adult maturity. 
 
 
Risk-minimization measures  Routine risk-minimization measures:

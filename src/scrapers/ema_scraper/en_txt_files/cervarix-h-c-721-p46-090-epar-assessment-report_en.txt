1.  Introduction 
This report covers the following post-authorisation commitments undertaken by the MAH: 
The HPV-073 study report is submitted to comply with the requirements of Article 46 of the Pediatric 
regulation. The study aimed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity profile of the HPV-16/18-
adjuvanted vaccine in young female children 4-6 years, and whether delivery of the HPV vaccine at a 
paediatric age would be an alternative to the current adolescent schedule. The results of this study can 
be used to inform potential future HPV vaccine studies in this age range.

2.  Scientific discussion 
This study is a phase III randomised, single-blind, controlled study with two parallel groups (HPV_2D 
and MMR_DTPa). Vaccine against HPV was administered according to a 2-dose schedule at 0,6 months 
in healthy female children aged 4-6 years. Vaccines against MMR and DTPa served as a control in the 
study wherein one dose of MMR vaccine was administered at Day 0 and one dose of DTPa vaccine at 
Month 6. 
Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) reviewed the first interim analysis data and 
providedrecommendation in case a potential safety signal was identified by GSK. 
Healthy female subjects between, and including, 4-6 years of age at the time of the first vaccination, 
who received four doses of DTP containing vaccine (i.e., three doses in the first year of life and a 
fourth dose in the second year of life) as well as first dose of MMR vaccine according to the local 
schedule applicable in the participating countries. 
The duration of the study was approximately 36 months for each subject in HPV_2D group and 12 
months in MMR_DTPa group.

The primary analysis was based on the according-to-protocol (ATP) cohort for analysis of 
immunogenicity. A second analysis based on the total vaccinated cohort (TVC) was performed to 
complement the ATP analysis. 
Discussion on the rationale of the design of this study. 
The primary vaccination course of GSK Biologicals’ HPV vaccine consists of three doses at 0, 1, 6 
months. It has been demonstrated that the HPV-16/18 vaccine induces a high and sustained immune 
response up to 9.4 years after vaccination in female subjects aged 15-25 years [Naud, 2014]. The 
sustained high immune response is associated with protection from HPV infection as well as protection 
against cervical precancerous lesions associated with HPV-16/18 infection (Studies HPV-001/007/023) 
[Harper, 2006; GlaxoSmithKline Vaccine HPV-007 Study Group, 2009; Roteli-Martins, 2012; Naud, 
2014]. Statistical models predict that the antibody response will remain above the level induced by 
natural infection for at least 20 years [David, 2009]. In pre-teen/adolescent girls (aged 10-14 years), 
the HPV-16/18 vaccine elicited approximately 2-fold higher serum anti-HPV-16/18 antibody levels than 
in young adult women (aged 15-25 years) [Pedersen, 2007]. The augmented immune response in pre-
teen/adolescent girls has been shown to be sustained for at least 48 months [Petäjä, 2011]. 
On the other hand, administration of GSK Biologicals’ HPV vaccine according to an alternative 2-dose 
schedule at 0, 6 months in adolescent females has also been shown to be highly immunogenic 
[Romanowski, 2011]. The results from the GSK Biologicals’ study HPV-048 showed that up to Month 48 
the HPV vaccine administered on a 2-dose schedule at 0, 6 months in pre-teen/adolescent girls (aged 
9-14 years) was non-inferior to the 3-dose standard schedule in females 15-25 years of age, the age 
group in which vaccine efficacy has been demonstrated [Romanowski, 2014]. Of importance, the 
kinetics of serum antibody responses in the preteen/adolescent population receiving 2 doses of the 
HPV-16/18 vaccine within a 6-month period are similar to those observed in young adult women who 
receive the standard 3-dose schedule within 6 months, suggesting that long lasting protection can be 
expected. Based on the high immunogenicity of the HPV vaccine in young adolescents, it is anticipated 
that the vaccine administered according to a 2-dose schedule at 0, 6 months in children of pre-school 
age could induce a similarly high and sustained immune response.

The current study was originally designed to demonstrate that the immune response induced by 2 
doses of HPV vaccine administered according to a two dose schedule at Months 0 and 6 in 4-6 years 
old female subjects is non-inferior to three doses of HPV vaccine administered at Months 0, 1 and 6 in 
15-25 years old female subjects, and that the co-administration of the HPV vaccine with MMR and 
DTPa vaccines (routinely recommended for children in the 4-6 years age range) would not lead to an 
interference in immune response to DTPa, MMR and HPV vaccine antigens. Since the start of the study, 
2-dose schedules for HPV vaccination of adolescents have been approved in many countries. 
Given the increasing success of adolescent immunisation programmes, the medical need for paediatric 
HPV vaccination (below 9 years of age) has become less clear. In addition, the recruitment of the study 
population of eligible 4-6 years old subjects has been very difficult due to the measles vaccination 
campaigns in several countries related to the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO)/ World Health 
Organisation (WHO)-led measles elimination strategy. The current study therefore descriptively 
evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of GSK Biologicals’ HPV-16/18 vaccine when administered 
according to a 2-dose schedule in 4-6 years old female subjects. Vaccines against measles, mumps 
and rubella (MMR) and against diphtheria-tetanus- pertussis (DTPa) served as a control in the study. 
Safety results 
Solicited adverse events: During the 7-day post-vaccination period, overall/dose incidence of at least 
one solicited symptom was 73.3% in the HPV_2D group and 60.7% in the control (MMR_DTPa) group. 
- 
The overall incidence of solicited local symptoms was 63.7% in HPV_2D group and 40.0% in 
MMR_DTPa group. The most frequently reported local solicited symptom was pain at injection 
site, with an incidence of 60.3% of HPV doses in 73.0% of subjects, 20.3% after MMR 
vaccination and 50.7% after DTPa vaccination. Grade 3 solicited local symptoms after HPV-
16/18 vaccination included injection site pain (2.7% of HPV doses in 5.4% of subjects), 
swelling (2.7% of HPV doses in 5.4% of subjects) and redness (0.7% of HPV doses in 1.4% of 
subjects). Grade 3 solicited local symptoms after DTPa vaccination included injection site 
swelling (9.9%), redness (5.6%) and pain (1.4%). No Grade 3 solicited local symptoms 
reported after MMR vaccination. 
- 
The overall incidence of solicited general symptoms was 47.3% in HPV_2D group and 46.2% in 
MMR_DTPa group. The most frequent solicited general symptom after HPV-16/18 vaccination 
was irritability/fussiness (21.2% of HPV doses in 29.7% of subjects). The most frequently 
reported solicited general symptom was headache (25.7%) after MMR vaccination and 
irritability/fussiness (23.9%) after DTPa vaccination. Grade 3 solicited general symptoms 
reported after HPV-16/18 vaccination included drowsiness (2.1% of HPV doses in 4.1% of 
subjects), fever (0.7% of HPV doses in 1.4% of subjects), irritability/fussiness (0.7% of HPV 
doses in 1.4% of subjects) and loss of appetite (0.7% of HPV doses in 1.4% of subjects). 
Grade 3 solicited general symptoms reported after DTPa vaccination included loss of appetite 
(1.4%). No Grade 3 solicited general symptoms reported after MMR vaccination. 
Unsolicited adverse events: Overall 64.9% of subjects in the HPV_2D group reported at least one 
unsolicited AE. In the control (MMR_DTPa) group, 54.1% of subjects reported at least one unsolicited 
AE after the MMR vaccination and 18.3% of girls reported at least one unsolicited AE after the DTPa 
vaccination. In both groups, the most frequently reported unsolicited AE was nasopharyngitis (in 
32.4% vs. 36.5% of girls in the HPV_2D and the control (MMR_DTPa) group, respectively).

Serious adverse events (SAEs): A total of 3 SAEs were reported by 2 subjects (in the MMR_DTPa 
group) till Month 7, and 4 SAEs were reported by 3 subjects till Month 12 (3 SAEs were reported by 2 
subjects in the MMR_DTPa group and one SAE was reported by one subject in the HPV_2D group). The 
SAEs were not considered to be causally related to vaccination. No fatal SAE was reported.   
Withdrawal due to adverse events (AEs)/serious adverse events (SAEs): None of the subjects were 
withdrawn due to AEs/SAEs.  Medically significant conditions (MSCs): MSCs were reported by 38 
(51.4%) subjects in the HPV_2D group and 29 (39.2%) subjects in the MMR_DTPa group till Month 12.   
Potential Immune-Mediated Diseases (pIMDs): None was reported till Month 12.  
Clinical laboratory evaluations: In both groups, most of the subjects with haematological and 
biochemical parameters within the normal ranges at study entry remained as such after each vaccine 
dose. 
Immunogenicity results 
- 
Following 2-dose vaccination (Month 0, 6) of HPV-16/18, seroconversion rates for anti-HPV-16 
and anti-HPV-18 were 100% at Month 7 and seropositivity rates remained 100% up to Month 
36. 
- 
The GMCs for both anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibodies peaked at Month 7 (20080.0 
EU/mL for anti-HPV-16 antibody and 10621.8 EU/mL for anti-HPV-18 antibody) and then 
gradually declined until Month 18, after which a plateau level was reached until Month 36. 
Seropositive rates for measles, mumps and rubella after 43 days of MMR vaccination were 
100%, 98.3% and 100%, respectively. The GMCs were 2512.3 IU/mL for anti-measles 
antibody, 7001.1 IU/mL for anti-mumps antibody and 124.2 IU/mL for anti-rubella antibody. 
Seroprotection rates for diphtheria and tetanus were both 100%, 30 days after DTPa 
vaccination.

Conclusion of the MAH:  
In this phase III, controlled, randomized, single-blind, multicenter study, evaluating the safety and 
immunogenicity of HPV-16/18 vaccine given to 4-6 year-old female subjects as a 2-dose schedule 
(Month 0, 6), compared to the control group receiving sequentially MMR (Month 0) and DTPa (Month 6) 
vaccines: 
- 
The safety profile of the HPV-16/18 vaccine was acceptable. 
-  Seroconversion rates were 100% for both HPV-16 and HPV-18 one month after completion of 
the 2-dose HPV vaccination (i.e. Month 7). Antibody response peaked at Month 7 and persisted 
up to Month 36. 
The MAH does not consider use of the current study data for changing the age indication.  
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
The design and the rationales were discussed by the MAH. 
The results in the population studied of girls aged 4 to 6 years support an acceptable safety profile and 
a correct antibody response that is comparable to the results seen in the 9 to 14 years of age. Of 
importance, the kinetics of serum antibody responses in the preteen/adolescent population receiving 2 
doses of the HPV-16/18 vaccine within a 6-month period are similar to those observed in young adult 
women who receive the standard 3-dose schedule within 6 months, suggesting that long lasting 
protection can be expected.

The vaccine administered according to a 2-dose schedule at 0, 6 months in children of pre-school age 
induced a similarly high and sustained immune response seen in young adolescent girls. High 
seroconversion rates and GMTs reached for the 2 HPV types, which (although declining over time) were 
sufficiently maintained up to 36 months. AE frequencies were comparable with controls MMR and DTPa. 
Higher frequencies for both Grade 3 local and general solicited AEs were observed but are acceptable. 
Meanwhile, vaccine efficacy results in this pre-school population are not available. 
Based on the presented efficacy, immunogenicity and safety results the benefit risk balance for 
Cervarix remains positive. The presented data support the previously presented data. No regulatory 
action is considered necessary by the MAH based on the current study results. 
The section 4.2 of the SmPC currently states : 
Paediatric population (children < 9 years of age) 
Cervarix is not recommended for use in children below 9 years of age due to lack of data on 
safety and immunogenicity in this age-group. 
The Rapporteur endorses the discussion, but the SmPC should be updated to reflect that clinical data 
are available in this new paediatric age group (very limited data, and outside the indication).  
Member State 1 comment 
Section 4.2 of the SmPC states: 
This is not factually correct. It could be suggested to change this into “(very) limited data available”. 
Rapp response 
Agreed. 
  PAM not fulfilled (not all commitments fulfilled) and further action required: 
The SmPC should be updated to reflect that clinical data are available in this new paediatric age group. 
The following wording is proposed in Section 4.2, with a cross-reference to a brief description of the 
available data to be included in section 5.1. 
The safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of Cervarix in children below 9 years of age has not yet been 
established. Currently available data are described in section 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology 
can be made.

PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR 
QTERN (SAXAGLIPTIN/DAPAGLIFLOZIN FDC) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for QTERN (saxagliptin/dapagliflozin 
FDC). The RMP details important risks of QTERN, how these risks can be minimised, and 
how more information will be obtained about QTERN’s risks and uncertainties (missing 
information). 
QTERN’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet (PL) give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how QTERN should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for QTERN should be read in the context of all this information, 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
QTERN’s RMP.  
THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR 
QTERN is authorised in adults aged 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus (see 
SmPC for the full indication). It contains saxagliptin and dapagliflozin as the active 
substances and it is given by oral route of administration. 
Further information about the evaluation of QTERN’s benefits can be found in QTERN’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/qtern. 
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES TO 
MINIMISE OR FURTHER CHARACTERISE THE RISKS 
Important risks of QTERN, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about QTERN's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals, 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging, 
 
  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly, 
1 of 6 
 
 
  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures 
constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of QTERN is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of QTERN are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of QTERN. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs 
to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
The potential risk of pancreatic cancer has been discussed in published 
literature and evaluated by health authorities for the class as well as for 
other incretin-based antidiabetics (GLP- 1 analogues).  
Pancreatic cancer is an important potential risk for saxagliptin. 
There is an increase in risk of pancreatic cancer among patients with 
T2DM. Age, gender, race, cigarette smoking, obesity, diabetes, chronic 
pancreatitis, cirrhosis of the liver, occupational exposure, family 
history, and infections of the stomach with the ulcer causing bacteria 
Helicobacter pylori are other known risk factors.

Important potential risk – lower limb amputation 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Clinical trial data with another SGLT2 inhibitors. 
Lower limb amputations is an important potential risk for 
dapagliflozin. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Amputation is a treatment that is preceded by multiple diseases. 
Subjects with diabetes are at high risk for amputation due to a high 
prevalence of cardiovascular disease, including peripheral arterial 
disease, dyslipidaemia, peripheral neuropathy, and chronic kidney 
disease. Minor trauma can be an increased risk due to existing 
neuropathy and may led to ulcers that get infected and do not heal. The 
non-healing, infected ulcers may lead to gangrene and amputation.  
Risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
Additional pharmacovigilance 
activities 
SmPC section 4.4 and PL section 2. 
Dedicated eCRF for Lower Limb Amputation will be evaluated in 
studies D169AC00001, D169CC00001, D169EC00001, 
D169EC00002. 
Post-authorisation development plan 
There are no ongoing or planned additional pharmacovigilance studies or activities for 
QTERN.  
Studies which are conditions of the marketing authorisation  
There are no studies that are conditions of the marketing authorisation or specific obligations 
of QTERN.  
Other studies in post-authorisation development plan  
There are no studies required for QTERN. The pharmacovigilance activities listed below are 
planned or ongoing for the mono-component products, saxagliptin and dapagliflozin, and are 
included in this RMP as the results will potentially provide information relevant to the safety 
profile of QTERN. The information below is provided for information purpose only and these 
studies will be maintained through the respective mono-component RMPs.

On 14 December 2017, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a 
positive opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the 
medicinal product Yervoy. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Bristol-
Myers Squibb Pharma EEIG. 
The CHMP adopted an extension to the existing indication as follows2: 
“Yervoy is indicated for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma 
in adults, and adolescents 12 years of age and older (see section 4.4).” 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment 
report (EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this 
change to the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

issued 67 days from adoption of the opinion

1.  Background information on the procedure 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, MSD Vaccines submitted to the 
European Medicines Agency on 3 December 2021 an application for a variation. 
The following changes were proposed:

category 3 study in the RMP. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make some minor editorial 
changes (spacings) and included the updated long-term follow-up data received for the qHPV vaccine 
following V501-167 extension study. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package 
Leaflet. 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
The 9-valent vaccine Gardasil 9 (9vHPV) was authorised in EU in 2015. 
Based on new data accrued from the now completed clinical study V503-002-20, the MAH proposed to 
update the SmPC section 5.1 by updating the information on effectiveness data for 9vHPV vaccines. 
Study V503-002-20 had been assessed previously in separate worksharing procedures. The submission 
of the final study report is also in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 which sets 
out the obligation for MAHs to submit any MAH-sponsored studies involving the use of an authorised 
medicinal products in the paediatric population to the competent authority. 
LTFU data for the quadrivalent vaccine, 10 years follow-up, from V501-167 extension study, was 
assessed during a previous procedure for the tetravalent qHPV Gardasil (EMEA/H/C/000703/II/0087) and 
the changes were agreed with, but the data were not completely updated in the SmPC. In the current 
SmPC, information on V501-167 is updated according to earlier agreement and therefore will not be 
repeated again in this procedure.  
The phase 3 studies of the qHPV (Gardasil) and 9vHPV (Gardasil 9) vaccine programs were extended to 
provide LTFU data on effectiveness, immunogenicity, and safety. Subjects in the qHPV vaccine arm 
(control arm) of the pivotal 9vHPV vaccine efficacy study were offered vaccination with 9vHPV vaccine at 
the end of the base study. Because there is no control group in these LTFU studies, vaccine efficacy 
cannot be measured. In lieu of efficacy measurements, effectiveness of vaccination with the qHPV or 
9vHPV vaccine is assessed. LTFU for effectiveness was collected using the system of registries and tissue 
repositories in Scandinavia. Effectiveness is measured in terms of the observed incidence rates of disease 
in comparison with the expected incidence in an unvaccinated population. 
The final study report for Study V503-002-20 provides reassuring and consistent data on long-term 
effectiveness and immunogenicity or persistence of antibodies. The results speak for uniform long-term 
protection against infection and clinical disease caused by HPV types in the vaccine. The immune 
responses are rapid, substantial and well sustained, with current follow-up reaching up to 10 (9vHPV) 
years. Over time, GMT levels and seropositivity rates decline through an expected natural course and also 
number of persistent infections had been grown somewhat from 8 years follow-up to 10 years follow-up.

As there were no break-through cases of dysplasia so far, one can conclude that the protective effect of 
Gardasil 9 lasts at least 10 years. 
The updated safety follow-up did not reveal any new safety concern. 
The updates in SmPC are considered relevant, but the MAH was asked to describe also the incidence of 
the persistent HPV infections as it was a key effectiveness endpoint of the study and as no cases would be 
expected in the study cohort due to the limited sample size. The MAH updated the SmPC with information 
about incidence of the persistent HPV infections as requested. 
The benefit-risk balance of Gardasil 9 remains positive.

5.  Introduction 
The 9vHPV (Types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, 58) recombinant vaccine (GARDASIL™9), is an 
aluminum-adjuvanted recombinant VLP vaccine indicated for the prevention of cancer, dysplasia, genital 
warts, and infection caused by HPV types that are targeted by the vaccine in individuals from the age of 9 
years. 
This application is in support of an update to the SmPC and includes updated results from a clinical study 
of the 9vHPV vaccine program. 
Pivotal Phase 3 studies from the 9vHPV vaccine program were extended to evaluate the long-term 
effectiveness and immunogenicity of the 9vHPV and qHPV vaccines in support of approved indications 
specified in the SmPC. The proposed variation aims to update section 5.1 of the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) 
Current type II variation: 
1)  Addition of long-term effectiveness and immunogenicity data from Gardasil 9 study V503-002-
20 (MEA 010). 
V503-002-20 is a LTFU extension of Study V503-002 (base study; a 3-year immunogenicity study of the 
9vHPV vaccine in girls and boys 9 to 15 years of age, which assessed the immunogenicity and 
effectiveness of the 9vHPV vaccine through 10 years post dose 3.  
A total of 1272 participants (971 female and 301 male participants) who received 3 doses of 9vHPV 
vaccine in the base study were followed in the study extension. Serum was collected in the extension at 
Months 66, 90, and 126 to evaluate persistence of the HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 antibody 
responses. LTFU for effectiveness was collected at study visits every 6 months during the study 
extension, starting when the participant reached 16 years of age. Three analyses were conducted, 
including 2 interim analyses (at Months 72 and 96, representing 5.5 years and 7.5 years post dose 3, 
respectively) and 1 final analysis (at Month 126, representing 10 years post dose 3). This application 
provides the final analyses for the study extension summarized in the CSR 
6.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
6.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Clinical Immunogenicity Endpoints 
The immunogenicity endpoints for the LTFU study were the assessment of serum anti-HPV antibody levels 
(GMTs) and the proportions of participants who remained seropositive to vaccine HPV types at specific 
time points of the follow-up period to allow determination of the persistence of immune responses. 
The primary immunoassay was HPV-9 cLIA. The IgG LIA, which is slightly more sensitive than the HPV-9 
cLIA, was used as a secondary assay in supportive analyses to assess antibody persistence.  
The immunogenicity analyses were conducted in the PPI population, consisting of individuals who 
received all 3 doses of vaccinations with the correct dose of the correct clinical material and within 
acceptable day ranges, provided a Month 7 serology result within 21 to 49 days post dose 3, were 
seronegative by cLIA to the appropriate HPV type at Day 1 (For HPV 6 and 11, participants must have 
been seronegative to both HPV 6 and 11 at Day 1), and had no other protocol violations that could have 
interfered with the evaluation of participant's immune response to the study vaccine.

For the determination of endpoints, tissue samples collected during the study were reviewed by an 
adjudication panel of 4 pathologists and tested by PCR to detect the presence of HPV deoxyribonucleic 
acid. 
The primary effectiveness analyses were conducted in the PPE population consisting of individuals who 
received all 3 doses of vaccinations with the correct dose of the correct clinical material within 1 year, 
were seronegative by cLIA to the appropriate HPV type at Day 1 (seronegative to both HPV 6 and 11 in 
analysis of HPV 6- and 11-related endpoints), and had no other protocol violations that could have 
interfered with the evaluation of effectiveness of the study vaccine. Only PPE population-eligible 
participants who were at least 16 years of age and had at least 1 follow-up visit with PCR data 
contributed to the PPE analyses. 
6.2.  Results 
Final Analysis of Protocol V503-002-20: Antibody Persistence in Girls and Boys 9 to 15 Years of 
Age Administered 9vHPV Vaccine 
GMTs assessed by HPV-9 cLIA and IgG LIA to each of the 9 HPV types were highest at Month 7 (1 month 
postdose 3) and decreased thereafter. The steepest decline in GMTs occurred between Month 7 and 
Month 12, after which titers continued to gradually decrease through Month 126 (10 years postdose 3). 
Seropositivity rates were >99% at Month 7 and remained high at Month 126 (≥81.3% and ≥94.9% 
measured by cLIA and IgG LIA, respectively) for each of the 9 HPV types. 
In summary, the Month 126 immunogenicity results demonstrated persistent HPV antibody responses 
through 10 years postvaccination in girls and boys 9 to 15 years of age who received a 3-dose regimen of 
9vHPV vaccine (Table 2 & 3).

Assessor´s comment: Over time, GMT levels and seropositivity rates declined through an expected 
natural course. After 10 years, the vaccine induced antibodies are still detectable among more than 80 % 
of participants, depending on HPV type. There has not been a remarkable drop of antibody level or 
seropositivity from month 90 to month 126 indicating that antibody level is rather stable between 8 to 10 
years.  
Final Analysis of Protocol V503-002-20: Long-term Clinical Effectiveness of 9vHPV Vaccine in 
Girls and Boys 9 to 15 Years of Age 
Participants in the PPE population (n=1134) were followed for effectiveness for a maximum of 11.0 years 
(median: 10.0 years) postdose 3. Female participants (n=872) were followed for up to 11.0 years 
(median: 10.0 years) postdose 3; male participants (n=262) were followed for up to 10.6 years (median: 
9.9 years) postdose 3.  
One case of HPV 6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58-related low-grade cervical dysplasia was observed in 
female participants 9 to 15 years of age in the PPE population (866 participants, 4576.1 person-years 
follow-up). This case was diagnosed as CIN1, which was based on a CIN1 diagnosis associated with HPV

39 and HPV 59 on a cervical biopsy and a CIN1 diagnosis associated with HPV 16, HPV 39 and HPV 59 on 
an endocervical curettage. Cervical biopsy was positive for HPV 39 and HPV 59 with no pathological 
abnormalities. Persistent infection was observed with HPV 39 and HPV 59; HPV 16 was detected only once 
in association with the endocervical curettage. Based on these results, it is likely that the lesion was 
caused by HPV 39 or HPV 59. This CIN1 lesion is not considered a breakthrough since these 2 HPV types 
are not covered by the 9vHPV vaccine. 
No (0) cases of HPV 6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58-related PIN, genital warts, or penile/perineal/perianal 
cancer were observed in boys 9 to 15 years of age in the PPE population (261 participants, 
1278.6 person-years follow-up).  
Incidence rates of HPV 6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58-related 6-month persistent infection in females and 
males were low (52.4 and 54.6 per 10000 person-years, respectively) and within ranges expected in 
vaccinated cohorts (based on results from previous efficacy studies of the 9vHPV and qHPV vaccines) 
(Table4).

The number of persistent infections (>6 months) increased about two-fold at 10 years follow-up 
compared to the 8 years follow-up among both women and men. It is not possible to conclude from these 
data if this is due to waning protection or from increased exposure. The study cohort, which was at 9-15 
years of age at vaccination start is now, after 10 years FU, between 20-26 years old, which is a sexually 
active age. 
6.3.  Discussion 
9vHPV vaccine induced strong immune response with high levels of antibodies for all vaccine included 
HPV types. These antibodies persisted at least 10 years following vaccination with 9vHPV vaccine as 
measured with a binding assay. Over time, GMT levels and seropositivity rates declined through an 
expected natural course. After 10 years, the vaccine induced antibodies are still detectable among more 
than 80 % of participants, depending on HPV type. There has not been a remarkable drop of antibody 
level or seropositivity from month 90 to month 126 indicating that antibody level is rather stable between 
8 to 10 years.  
In case of 9vHPV study in younger cohort (9-15 at vaccination initiation) V503-002-20 there was no 
possible break through case identified during 10 years of follow-up. On the other hand, this cohort has 
not reached the age when the cervical lesions are usually discovered (30+). 
During this study, persistent HPV infections were noted in some cases. During the 8 years follow-up, 
when 856 women had been sampled at least once, eleven females had HPV 16, and 3 women had one of 
each HPV 6, 18 and 33 infections which persisted more than 6 months. Seven HPV 16 infections were 
cleared, but the rest of these HPV infections persisted 12 months. At 8 years follow-up, 251 men had 
been sampled and three males had 6 months of persistence of HPV type HPV 11, 45 and 52. In one case, 
HPV 52 infection persisted 12 months.  
According to the final analysis at 10 years of follow-up, 16 additional women compared to 8 years follow-
up were sampled (altogether 872) and additional persistent HPV infections appeared. HPV 16 was 
altogether persistent more than 6 months in 17 women and more than 12 months in 5 women. HPV 6 
persisted more than 6 months in 4 women and 12 months in 2 women. Also one women had HPV 58 
infection, which persisted more than 6 months.  
Among 8 males, HPV11 (1), HPV 31 (2), HPV 45 (1) and HPV 52 (4) persisted more than 6 months, 
whereas in 2 males HPV 52 persisted more than 12 months. 
The number of infections increase compared to the earlier observation-point. It is not possible to conclude

if this is due to waning protection, or due to increased exposure. As this cohort was very young at the 
vaccination time it is unlikely that these infections were there already before vaccination.  
7.  Clinical Safety aspects 
This application is in support of an update to the PI for the 9vHPV vaccine and includes Protocol V503-
002-20. Protocol V503-002-20 is a LTFU extension of Protocol V503-002, to assess the long-term 
immunogenicity, effectiveness, and safety of the 9vHPV vaccine through 10 years postdose 3 (Month 
126). Eligible participants included girls and boys enrolled in the V503-002 base study aged 9 to 15 years 
who received a 3-dose regimen of 9vHPV vaccine at Day 1, Month 2, and Month 6. No vaccinations were 
administered during the study extension. The final analysis (at Month 126) is included in this application. 
7.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Safety Population 
All safety analyses were performed on the all-participants-as-treated population, which was defined as all 
enrolled participants who received at least 1 dose of the study vaccine and had a safety follow-up. 
Serious Adverse Events 
SAEs included those events that met standard definitions for SAEs (ie, resulted in death, was life 
threatening, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, resulted in or prolonged existing 
inpatient hospitalization, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or was another important medical event) 
as well as cancer and overdose. 
Adverse events resulting in death and SAEs that were considered by the investigator to be vaccine- or 
procedure-related occurring at any time during the study were to be reported to the Sponsor. 
Pregnancy Outcomes 
Throughout the study, pregnancies were to be followed to outcome. Pregnancy outcomes were reported 
to the Sponsor. SAEs in infants born to study participants were collected throughout the study and 
followed to outcome. 
Overall Extent of Exposure 
Measures of extent of exposure did not apply to the V503-002-20 study because vaccinations  
were not administered in the LTFU study. 
The 1272 participants enrolled in the V503-002-20 study (971 female and 301 male) all received 3 doses 
of 9vHPV vaccine in the V503-002 base study. 
7.2.  Results 
Serious Adverse Events 
No vaccine-related or procedure-related SAEs were reported during the LTFU.  
One participant died during the LTFU. The cause of death was disseminated tuberculosis (SAE, onset over 
eight and a half years post dose 3). The death was considered not related to study vaccination or 
procedures. 
Although not required by the protocol, 1 SAE of ‘abortion threatened’ at over four and a half years post 
dose 3, considered not related to the vaccine or study procedures, was reported in 1 participant during 
study V503-002-20. 
Pregnancy Outcomes 
The safety profile of the 9vHPV vaccine with respect to pregnancy outcomes has been previously 
established based on a combined analysis of 7 Phase 3 clinical studies including more than 1500

pregnancies. 
Known outcomes were reported for 240 pregnancies in Protocol V503-002-20. Most pregnancies resulted 
in live births. Spontaneous abortions (fetal loss before 20 weeks of gestation) and late fetal deaths (fetal 
death after 20 weeks of gestation) were reported for 9.6% (23/240) and 0.4% (1/240) of the 
pregnancies with known outcomes, respectively. The proportion of pregnancies with live birth that  
resulted in a congenital anomaly was 3.3% (8/240). Overall, the proportions of pregnancies that resulted 
in adverse outcomes of spontaneous abortion, late fetal death, or congenital anomaly in the study were 
within ranges reported in the general population. These results do not change the safety profile 
previously established.  
Eight pregnancies in Protocol V503-002-20 resulted in live births in which the infants were diagnosed with 
congenital anomalies. These congenital anomalies included 1 case of unspecified congenital heart disease, 
4 cases of congenital ankyloglossia, 1 case of syndactyly, 1 case of cleft lip and palate, and 1 case of 
trisomy 21. All these congenital anomalies occurred in pregnancies with an estimated date of conception 
>2 years postvaccination. None of these congenital anomalies were considered related to the study 
vaccine. 
A total of 35 SAEs were reported in infants of 17 vaccinated female participants enrolled in Protocol V503-
002-20 from the Month 36 visit through the end of the study. None of these SAEs were considered 
related to the study vaccine.  
Narratives for all the SAEs reported in infants were provided. 
7.3.  Discussion 
No vaccine-related or procedure-related SAEs were reported during the LTFU as expected as such AEs 
appear in frame of the few months from vaccination and not years after. One participant died due to the 
tuberculosis almost 9 years after last dose of Gardasil 9 and is clearly unrelated to the vaccination. Same 
applies to the case of “abortion threatened” 4.5 years post dose 3. The pregnancy outcomes were as 
expected, and Gardasil 9 had no influence for these.  
We conclude that administration of a 3-dose regimen of 9vHPV vaccine to girls and boys 9 to 15 years of 
age is generally well tolerated through 10 years postvaccination. 
8.  Changes to the Product Information 
As  a  result  of  this  variation,  section  5.1  of  the  SmPC  is  updated  to  include  information  on  long-term 
effectiveness and immunogenicity data following the final results of the Gardasil 9 study V503-002-20 listed 
as  a  category  3  study  in  the  RMP.  In  addition,  the  applicant  took  the  opportunity  to  make  some  minor 
editorial changes (spacings) and included the updated long term follow-up data already approved for the 
qHPV vaccine following V501-167 extension study. 
The main SmPC changes in section 5.1 proposed by the MAH were the following: 
Long-term effectiveness studies

Assessor´s comment: the updates are based on 10 years-follow-up of study V503-002-20. The updates 
are in agreement with the presented data and are therefore acceptable, but the Long-term effectiveness 
paragraph should also mention the data on persistent infection as no cases would be expected in the 
study cohort due to the limited sample size. Also, persistent infection was a key effectiveness endpoint of 
this study. 
Immune responses to Gardasil 9 using a 2-dose schedule in individuals 9 through 14 years of 
age 
Assessor´s comment: the update bases on 10 years-follow-up of study V501-167. The updates are in 
agreement with the presented data during the previous procedure EMEA/H/C/000703/II/0087 for Gardasil 
and are therefore acceptable.  
Based on the above assessment remarks, the resulting text for Section 5.1 is therefore endorsed:

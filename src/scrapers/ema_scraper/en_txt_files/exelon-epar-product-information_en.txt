CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Symptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe Alzheimer’s dementia. 
Symptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe dementia in patients with idiopathic Parkinson’s 
disease. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and treatment 
of Alzheimer’s dementia or dementia associated with Parkinson’s disease. Diagnosis should be made 
according to current guidelines. Therapy with rivastigmine should only be started if a caregiver is 
available who will regularly monitor intake of the medicinal product by the patient. 
Posology 
Rivastigmine should be administered twice a day, with morning and evening meals. The capsules should 
be swallowed whole. 
Initial dose 
1.5 mg twice a day. 
Dose titration 
The starting dose is 1.5 mg twice a day. If this dose is well tolerated after a minimum of two weeks of 
treatment, the dose may be increased to 3 mg twice a day. Subsequent increases to 4.5 mg and then 6 mg 
twice a day should also be based on good tolerability of the current dose and may be considered after a 
minimum of two weeks of treatment at that dose level. 
If adverse reactions (e.g. nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or loss of appetite), weight decrease or 
worsening of extrapyramidal symptoms (e.g. tremor) in patients with dementia associated with 
Parkinson’s disease are observed during treatment, these may respond to omitting one or more doses. If 
adverse reactions persist, the daily dose should be temporarily reduced to the previous well-tolerated 
dose or the treatment may be discontinued. 
Maintenance dose 
The effective dose is 3 to 6 mg twice a day; to achieve maximum therapeutic benefit patients should be 
maintained on their highest well tolerated dose. The recommended maximum daily dose is 6 mg twice a 
day. 
Maintenance treatment can be continued for as long as a therapeutic benefit for the patient exists. 
Therefore, the clinical benefit of rivastigmine should be reassessed on a regular basis, especially for 
patients treated at doses less than 3 mg twice a day. If after 3 months of maintenance dose treatment the 
patient’s rate of decline in dementia symptoms is not altered favourably, the treatment should be 
discontinued. Discontinuation should also be considered when evidence of a therapeutic effect is no 
longer present. 
Individual response to rivastigmine cannot be predicted. However, a greater treatment effect was seen in 
Parkinson’s disease patients with moderate dementia. Similarly a larger effect was observed in 
Parkinson’s disease patients with visual hallucinations (see section 5.1). 
Treatment effect has not been studied in placebo-controlled trials beyond 6 months. 
Re-initiation of therapy 
If treatment is interrupted for more than three days, it should be re-initiated at 1.5 mg twice daily. 
Dose titration should then be carried out as described above.

Special populations 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate renal or hepatic impairment. 
However, due to increased exposure in these populations dosing recommendations to titrate according to 
individual tolerability should be closely followed as patients with clinically significant renal or hepatic 
impairment might experience more dose-dependent adverse reactions. Patients with severe hepatic 
impairment have not been studied, however, Exelon capsules may be used in this patient population 
provided close monitoring is exercised (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of Exelon in the paediatric population in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance rivastigmine, to other carbamate derivatives or to any of the 
excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Previous history of application site reactions suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis with rivastigmine 
patch (see section 4.4). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
The incidence and severity of adverse reactions generally increase with higher doses. If treatment is 
interrupted for more than three days, it should be re-initiated at 1.5 mg twice daily to reduce the 
possibility of adverse reactions (e.g. vomiting). 
Skin application site reactions may occur with rivastigmine patch and are usually mild or moderate in 
intensity. These reactions are not in themselves an indication of sensitisation. However, use of 
rivastigmine patch may lead to allergic contact dermatitis. 
Allergic contact dermatitis should be suspected if application site reactions spread beyond the patch 
size, if there is evidence of a more intense local reaction (e.g. increasing erythema, oedema, papules, 
vesicles) and if symptoms do not significantly improve within 48 hours after patch removal. In these 
cases, treatment should be discontinued (see section 4.3). 
Patients who develop application site reactions suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis to rivastigmine 
patch and who still require rivastigmine treatment should only be switched to oral rivastigmine after 
negative allergy testing and under close medical supervision. It is possible that some patients 
sensitised to rivastigmine by exposure to rivastigmine patch may not be able to take rivastigmine in 
any form. 
There have been rare post-marketing reports of patients experiencing allergic dermatitis 
(disseminated) when administered rivastigmine irrespective of the route of administration (oral, 
transdermal). In these cases, treatment should be discontinued (see section 4.3). 
Patients and caregivers should be instructed accordingly. 
Dose titration: Adverse reactions (e.g. hypertension and hallucinations in patients with Alzheimer’s 
dementia and worsening of extrapyramidal symptoms, in particular tremor, in patients with dementia 
associated with Parkinson’s disease) have been observed shortly after dose increase. They may 
respond to a dose reduction. In other cases, Exelon has been discontinued (see section 4.8). 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gastrointestinal disorders such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea are dose-related, and may occur 
particularly when initiating treatment and/or increasing the dose (see section 4.8). These adverse 
reactions occur more commonly in women. Patients who show signs or symptoms of dehydration 
resulting from prolonged vomiting or diarrhoea can be managed with intravenous fluids and dose 
reduction or discontinuation if recognised and treated promptly. Dehydration can be associated with 
serious outcomes. 
Patients with Alzheimer’s disease may lose weight. Cholinesterase inhibitors, including rivastigmine, 
have been associated with weight loss in these patients. During therapy patient’s weight should be 
monitored. 
In case of severe vomiting associated with rivastigmine treatment, appropriate dose adjustments as 
recommended in section 4.2 must be made. Some cases of severe vomiting were associated with 
oesophageal rupture (see section 4.8). Such events appeared to occur particularly after dose increments 
or high doses of rivastigmine. 
Electrocardiogram QT prolongation may occur in patients treated with certain cholinesterase inhibitor 
products including rivastigmine. Rivastigmine may cause bradycardia which constitutes a risk factor 
in the occurrence of torsade de pointes, predominantly in patients with risk factors. Caution is advised 
in patients with pre-existing, or a family history of, QTc prolongation or at higher risk of developing 
torsade de pointes; for example, those with uncompensated heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, 
bradyarrhythmias, a predisposition to hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia, or concomitant use with 
medicinal products known to induce QT prolongation and/or torsade de pointes. Clinical monitoring 
(ECG) may also be required (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). 
Care must be taken when using rivastigmine in patients with sick sinus syndrome or conduction defects 
(sino-atrial block, atrio-ventricular block) (see section 4.8). 
Rivastigmine may cause increased gastric acid secretions. Care should be exercised in treating patients 
with active gastric or duodenal ulcers or patients predisposed to these conditions. 
Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or 
obstructive pulmonary disease. 
Cholinomimetics may induce or exacerbate urinary obstruction and seizures. Caution is recommended in 
treating patients predisposed to such diseases. 
The use of rivastigmine in patients with severe dementia of Alzheimer’s disease or associated with 
Parkinson’s disease, other types of dementia or other types of memory impairment (e.g. age-related 
cognitive decline) has not been investigated and therefore use in these patient populations is not 
recommended. 
Like other cholinomimetics, rivastigmine may exacerbate or induce extrapyramidal symptoms. 
Worsening (including bradykinesia, dyskinesia, gait abnormality) and an increased incidence or severity 
of tremor have been observed in patients with dementia associated with Parkinson’s disease (see section 
4.8). These events led to the discontinuation of rivastigmine in some cases (e.g. discontinuations due to 
tremor 1.7% on rivastigmine vs 0% on placebo). Clinical monitoring is recommended for these adverse 
reactions. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Special populations 
Patients with clinically significant renal or hepatic impairment might experience more adverse reactions 
(see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Dosing recommendations to titrate according to individual tolerability must be 
closely followed. Patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied. However, Exelon may 
be used in this patient population and close monitoring is necessary. 
Patients with body weight below 50 kg may experience more adverse reactions and may be more likely 
to discontinue due to adverse reactions. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
As a cholinesterase inhibitor, rivastigmine may exaggerate the effects of succinylcholine-type muscle 
relaxants during anaesthesia. Caution is recommended when selecting anaesthetic agents. Possible dose 
adjustments or temporarily stopping treatment can be considered if needed. 
In view of its pharmacodynamic effects and possible additive effects, rivastigmine should not be given 
concomitantly with other cholinomimetic substances. Rivastigmine might interfere with the activity of 
anticholinergic medicinal products (e.g oxybutynin, tolterodine). 
Additive effects leading to bradycardia (which may result in syncope) have been reported with the 
combined use of various beta-blockers (including atenolol) and rivastigmine. Cardiovascular beta- 
blockers are expected to be associated with the greatest risk, but reports have also been received in 
patients using other beta-blockers. Therefore, caution should be exercised when rivastigmine is 
combined with beta-blockers and also other bradycardia agents (e.g.class III antiarrhythmic agents, 
calcium channel antagonists, digitalis glycoside, pilocarpin). 
Since bradycardia constitutes a risk factor in the occurrence of torsades de pointes, the combination of 
rivastigmine with QT prolongation- or torsades de pointes-inducing medicinal products such as 
antipsychotics i.e. some phenothiazines (chlorpromazine, levomepromazine), benzamides (sulpiride, 
sultopride, amisulpride, tiapride, veralipride), pimozide, haloperidol, droperidol, cisapride, citalopram, 
diphemanil, erythromycin IV, halofantrin, mizolastin, methadone, pentamidine and moxifloxacine 
should be observed with caution and clinical monitoring (ECG) may also be required. 
No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between rivastigmine and digoxin, warfarin, diazepam or 
fluoxetine in studies in healthy volunteers. The increase in prothrombin time induced by warfarin is not 
affected by administration of rivastigmine. No untoward effects on cardiac conduction were observed 
following concomitant administration of digoxin and rivastigmine. 
According to its metabolism, metabolic interactions with other medicinal products appear unlikely, 
although rivastigmine may inhibit the butyrylcholinesterase mediated metabolism of other substances.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
In pregnant animals, rivastigmine and/or metabolites crossed the placenta. It is not known if this occurs 
in humans. No clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. In peri/postnatal studies in rats, an 
increased gestation time was observed. Rivastigmine should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly 
necessary. 
Breast-feeding 
In animals, rivastigmine is excreted in milk. It is not known if rivastigmine is excreted into human milk. 
Therefore, women on rivastigmine should not breast-feed. 
Fertility 
No adverse effects of rivastigmine were observed on fertility or reproductive performance in rats (see 
section 5.3). Effects of rivastigmine on human fertility are not known. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Alzheimer’s disease may cause gradual impairment of driving performance or compromise the ability to 
use machinery. Furthermore, rivastigmine can induce dizziness and somnolence, mainly when initiating 
treatment or increasing the dose. As a consequence, rivastigmine has minor or moderate influence on the 
ability to drive and use machines. Therefore, the ability of patients with dementia on rivastigmine to 
continue driving or operating complex machines should be routinely evaluated by the treating physician. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions (ADRs) are gastrointestinal, including nausea (38%) and 
vomiting (23%), especially during titration. Female patients in clinical studies were found to be more 
susceptible than male patients to gastrointestinal adverse reactions and weight loss.

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms 
Most cases of accidental overdose have not been associated with any clinical signs or symptoms and 
almost all of the patients concerned continued rivastigmine treatment 24 hours after the overdose. 
Cholinergic toxicity has been reported with muscarinic symptoms that are observed with moderate 
poisonings such as miosis, flushing, digestive disorders including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and 
diarrhoea, bradycardia, bronchospasm and increased bronchial secretions, hyperhidrosis, involuntary 
urination and/or defecation, lacrimation, hypotension and salivary hypersecretion. 
In more severe cases nicotinic effects might develop such as muscular weakness, fasciculations, seizures 
and respiratory arrest with possible fatal outcome. 
Additionally there have been post-marketing cases of dizziness, tremor, headache, somnolence, 
confusional state, hypertension, hallucinations and malaise. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Management 
As rivastigmine has a plasma half-life of about 1 hour and a duration of acetylcholinesterase inhibition of 
about 9 hours, it is recommended that in cases of asymptomatic overdose no further dose of rivastigmine 
should be administered for the next 24 hours. In overdose accompanied by severe nausea and vomiting, 
the use of antiemetics should be considered. Symptomatic treatment for other adverse reactions should 
be given as necessary. 
In massive overdose, atropine can be used. An initial dose of 0.03 mg/kg intravenous atropine sulphate is 
recommended, with subsequent doses based on clinical response. Use of scopolamine as an antidote is 
not recommended. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: psychoanaleptics, anticholinesterases, ATC code: N06DA03 
Rivastigmine is an acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor of the carbamate type, thought to 
facilitate cholinergic neurotransmission by slowing the degradation of acetylcholine released by 
functionally intact cholinergic neurones. Thus, rivastigmine may have an ameliorative effect on 
cholinergic-mediated cognitive deficits in dementia associated with Alzheimer’s disease and 
Parkinson’s disease. 
Rivastigmine interacts with its target enzymes by forming a covalently bound complex that 
temporarily inactivates the enzymes. In healthy young men, an oral 3 mg dose decreases 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in CSF by approximately 40% within the first 1.5 hours after 
administration. Activity of the enzyme returns to baseline levels about 9 hours after the maximum 
inhibitory effect has been achieved. In patients with Alzheimer’s disease, inhibition of AChE in CSF 
by rivastigmine was dose-dependent up to 6 mg given twice daily, the highest dose tested. Inhibition 
of butyrylcholinesterase activity in CSF of 14 Alzheimer patients treated by rivastigmine was similar 
to that of AChE. 
Clinical studies in Alzheimer’s dementia 
The efficacy of rivastigmine has been established through the use of three independent, domain 
specific, assessment tools which were assessed at periodic intervals during 6 month treatment periods. 
These include the ADAS-Cog (Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive subscale, a 
performance based measure of cognition), the CIBIC-Plus (Clinician’s Interview Based Impression of 
Change-Plus, a comprehensive global assessment of the patient by the physician incorporating 
caregiver input), and the PDS (Progressive Deterioration Scale, a caregiver-rated assessment of the 
activities of daily living including personal hygiene, feeding, dressing, household chores such as 
shopping, retention of ability to orient oneself to surroundings as well as involvement in activities 
relating to finances, etc.). 
The patients studied had an MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) score of 10–24. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The results for clinically relevant responders pooled from two flexible dose studies out of the three 
pivotal 26-week multicentre studies in patients with mild-to-moderately severe Alzheimer’s Dementia, 
are provided in Table 4 below. Clinically relevant improvement in these studies was defined a priori as 
at least 4-point improvement on the ADAS-Cog, improvement on the CIBIC-Plus, or at least a 10% 
improvement on the PDS. 
In addition, a post-hoc definition of response is provided in the same table. The secondary definition 
of response required a 4-point or greater improvement on the ADAS-Cog, no worsening on the 
CIBIC-Plus, and no worsening on the PDS. The mean actual daily dose for responders in the 6–12 mg 
group, corresponding to this definition, was 9.3 mg. It is important to note that the scales used in this 
indication vary and direct comparisons of results for different therapeutic agents are not valid.

Clinical studies in dementia associated with Parkinson’s disease 
The efficacy of rivastigmine in dementia associated with Parkinson’s disease has been demonstrated in 
a 24-week multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled core study and its 24-week open-label 
extension phase. Patients involved in this study had an MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) score 
of 10–24. Efficacy has been established by the use of two independent scales which were assessed at 
regular intervals during a 6-month treatment period as shown in Table 5 below: the ADAS-Cog, a 
measure of cognition, and the global measure ADCS-CGIC (Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study-
Clinician’s Global Impression of Change).

Although a treatment effect was demonstrated in the overall study population, the data suggested that a 
larger treatment effect relative to placebo was seen in the subgroup of patients with moderate dementia 
associated with Parkinson’s disease. Similarly a larger treatment effect was observed in those patients 
with visual hallucinations (see Table 6).

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Exelon in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of Alzheimer’s dementia and in the 
treatment of dementia in patients with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (see section 4.2 for information 
on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Rivastigmine is rapidly and completely absorbed. Peak plasma concentrations are reached in 
approximately 1 hour. As a consequence of rivastigmine’s interaction with its target enzyme, the 
increase in bioavailability is about 1.5-fold greater than that expected from the increase in dose. Absolute 
bioavailability after a 3 mg dose is about 36%13%. Administration of rivastigmine with food delays 
absorption (tmax) by 90 min and lowers Cmax and increases AUC by approximately 30%. 
Distribution 
Protein binding of rivastigmine is approximately 40%. It readily crosses the blood brain barrier and has 
an apparent volume of distribution in the range of 1.8–2.7 l/kg. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Biotransformation 
Rivastigmine is rapidly and extensively metabolised (half-life in plasma approximately 1 hour), 
primarily via cholinesterase-mediated hydrolysis to the decarbamylated metabolite. In vitro, this 
metabolite shows minimal inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (<10%). 
Based on in vitro studies, no pharmacokinetic interaction is expected with medicinal products 
metabolised by the following cytochromes isoemzymes: CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, CYP2E1, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, or CYP2B6. Based on evidence from animal studies the major 
cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are minimally involved in rivastigmine metabolism. Total plasma 
clearance of rivastigmine was approximately 130 l/h after a 0.2 mg intravenous dose and decreased to 
70 l/h after a 2.7 mg intravenous dose. 
Elimination 
Unchanged rivastigmine is not found in the urine; renal excretion of the metabolites is the major route of 
elimination. Following administration of 14C-rivastigmine, renal elimination was rapid and essentially 
complete (>90%) within 24 hours. Less than 1% of the administered dose is excreted in the faeces. There 
is no accumulation of rivastigmine or the decarbamylated metabolite in patients with Alzheimer’s 
disease. 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that nicotine use increases the oral clearance of 
rivastigmine by 23% in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (n=75 smokers and 549 non-smokers) 
following rivastigmine oral capsule doses of up to 12 mg/day. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
While bioavailability of rivastigmine is greater in elderly than in young healthy volunteers, studies in 
Alzheimer patients aged between 50 and 92 years showed no change in bioavailability with age. 
Hepatic impairment 
The Cmax of rivastigmine was approximately 60% higher and the AUC of rivastigmine was more than 
twice as high in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment than in healthy subjects. 
Renal impairment 
Cmax and AUC of rivastigmine were more than twice as high in subjects with moderate renal impairment 
compared with healthy subjects; however there were no changes in Cmax and AUC of rivastigmine in 
subjects with severe renal impairment. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Repeated-dose toxicity studies in rats, mice and dogs revealed only effects associated with an 
exaggerated pharmacological action. No target organ toxicity was observed. No safety margins to human 
exposure were achieved in the animal studies due to the sensitivity of the animal models used. 
Rivastigmine was not mutagenic in a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo tests, except in a 
chromosomal aberration test in human peripheral lymphocytes at a dose 104 times the maximum clinical 
exposure. The in vivo micronucleus test was negative. The major metabolite NAP226-90 also did not 
show a genotoxic potential. 
No evidence of carcinogenicity was found in studies in mice and rats at the maximum tolerated dose, 
although the exposure to rivastigmine and its metabolites was lower than the human exposure. When 
normalised to body surface area, the exposure to rivastigmine and its metabolites was approximately 
equivalent to the maximum recommended human dose of 12 mg/day; however, when compared to the 
maximum human dose, a multiple of approximately 6-fold was achieved in animals. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In animals, rivastigmine crosses the placenta and is excreted into milk. Oral studies in pregnant rats and 
rabbits gave no indication of teratogenic potential on the part of rivastigmine. In oral studies with male 
and female rats, no adverse effects of rivastigmine were observed on fertility or reproductive 
performance of either the parent generation or the offspring of the parents. 
A mild eye/mucosal irritation potential of rivastigmine was identified in a rabbit study.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Symptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe Alzheimer’s dementia. 
Symptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe dementia in patients with idiopathic Parkinson’s 
disease. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and treatment 
of Alzheimer’s dementia or dementia associated with Parkinson’s disease. Diagnosis should be made 
according to current guidelines. Therapy with rivastigmine should only be started if a caregiver is 
available who will regularly monitor intake of the medicinal product by the patient. 
Posology 
Rivastigmine oral solution should be administered twice a day, with morning and evening meals. The 
prescribed amount of solution should be withdrawn from the container using the oral dosing syringe 
supplied. Rivastigmine oral solution may be swallowed directly from the syringe. Rivastigmine oral 
solution and rivastigmine capsules may be interchanged at equal doses. 
Initial dose 
1.5 mg twice a day. 
Dose titration 
The starting dose is 1.5 mg twice a day. If this dose is well tolerated after a minimum of two weeks of 
treatment, the dose may be increased to 3 mg twice a day. Subsequent increases to 4.5 mg and then 6 mg 
twice a day should also be based on good tolerability of the current dose and may be considered after a 
minimum of two weeks of treatment at that dose level. 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If adverse reactions (e.g. nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or loss of appetite), weight decrease or 
worsening of extrapyramidal symptoms (e.g. tremor) in patients with dementia associated with 
Parkinson’s disease are observed during treatment, these may respond to omitting one or more doses. If 
adverse reactions persist, the daily dose should be temporarily reduced to the previous well-tolerated 
dose or the treatment may be discontinued. 
Maintenance dose 
The effective dose is 3 to 6 mg twice a day; to achieve maximum therapeutic benefit patients should be 
maintained on their highest well tolerated dose. The recommended maximum daily dose is 6 mg twice a 
day. 
Maintenance treatment can be continued for as long as a therapeutic benefit for the patient exists. 
Therefore, the clinical benefit of rivastigmine should be reassessed on a regular basis, especially for 
patients treated at doses less than 3 mg twice a day. If after 3 months of maintenance dose treatment the 
patient’s rate of decline in dementia symptoms is not altered favourably, the treatment should be 
discontinued. Discontinuation should also be considered when evidence of a therapeutic effect is no 
longer present. 
Individual response to rivastigmine cannot be predicted. However, a greater treatment effect was seen 
in Parkinson’s disease patients with moderate dementia. Similarly a larger effect was observed in 
Parkinson’s disease patients with visual hallucinations (see section 5.1). 
Treatment effect has not been studied in placebo-controlled trials beyond 6 months. 
Re-initiation of therapy 
If treatment is interrupted for more than three days, it should be re-initiated at 1.5 mg twice daily. 
Dose titration should then be carried out as described above. 
Special populations 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate renal or hepatic impairment. 
However, due to increased exposure in these populations dosing recommendations to titrate according to 
individual tolerability should be closely followed as patients with clinically significant renal or hepatic 
impairment might experience more dose-dependent adverse reactions. Patients with severe hepatic 
impairment have not been studied, however, Exelon oral solution may be used in this patient population 
provided close monitoring is exercised (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of Exelon in the paediatric population in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance rivastigmine, to other carbamate derivatives or to any of the 
excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Previous history of application site reactions suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis with rivastigmine 
patch (see section 4.4). 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
The incidence and severity of adverse reactions generally increase with higher doses. If treatment is 
interrupted for more than three days, it should be re-initiated at 1.5 mg twice daily to reduce the 
possibility of adverse reactions (e.g. vomiting). 
Skin application site reactions may occur with rivastigmine patch and are usually mild or moderate in 
intensity. These reactions are not in themselves an indication of sensitisation. However, use of 
rivastigmine patch may lead to allergic contact dermatitis. 
Allergic contact dermatitis should be suspected if application site reactions spread beyond the patch 
size, if there is evidence of a more intense local reaction (e.g. increasing erythema, oedema, papules, 
vesicles) and if symptoms do not significantly improve within 48 hours after patch removal. In these 
cases, treatment should be discontinued (see section 4.3). 
Patients who develop application site reactions suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis to rivastigmine 
patch and who still require rivastigmine treatment should only be switched to oral rivastigmine after 
negative allergy testing and under close medical supervision. It is possible that some patients 
sensitised to rivastigmine by exposure to rivastigmine patch may not be able to take rivastigmine in 
any form. 
There have been rare post-marketing reports of patients experiencing allergic dermatitis 
(disseminated) when administered rivastigmine irrespective of the route of administration (oral, 
transdermal). In these cases, treatment should be discontinued (see section 4.3). 
Patients and caregivers should be instructed accordingly. 
Dose titration: Adverse reactions (e.g. hypertension and hallucinations in patients with Alzheimer’s 
dementia and worsening of extrapyramidal symptoms, in particular tremor, in patients with dementia 
associated with Parkinson’s disease) have been observed shortly after dose increase. They may 
respond to a dose reduction. In other cases, Exelon has been discontinued (see section 4.8). 
Gastrointestinal disorders such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea are dose-related, and may occur 
particularly when initiating treatment and/or increasing the dose (see section 4.8). These adverse 
reactions occur more commonly in women. Patients who show signs or symptoms of dehydration 
resulting from prolonged vomiting or diarrhoea can be managed with intravenous fluids and dose 
reduction or discontinuation if recognised and treated promptly. Dehydration can be associated with 
serious outcomes. 
Patients with Alzheimer’s disease may lose weight. Cholinesterase inhibitors, including rivastigmine, 
have been associated with weight loss in these patients. During therapy patient’s weight should be 
monitored. 
In case of severe vomiting associated with rivastigmine treatment, appropriate dose adjustments as 
recommended in section 4.2 must be made. Some cases of severe vomiting were associated with 
oesophageal rupture (see section 4.8). Such events appeared to occur particularly after dose increments 
or high doses of rivastigmine. 
Electrocardiogram QT prolongation may occur in patients treated with certain cholinesterase inhibitor 
products including rivastigmine. Rivastigmine may cause bradycardia which constitutes a risk factor 
in the occurrence of torsade de pointes, predominantly in patients with risk factors. Caution is advised 
in patients with pre-existing, or a family history of, QTc prolongation or at higher risk of developing 
torsade de pointes; for example, those with uncompensated heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, 
bradyarrhythmias, a predisposition to hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia, or concomitant use with 
medicinal products known to induce QT prolongation and/or torsade de pointes. Clinical monitoring 
(ECG) may also be required (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Care must be taken when using rivastigmine in patients with sick sinus syndrome or conduction defects 
(sino-atrial block, atrio-ventricular block) (see section 4.8). 
Rivastigmine may cause increased gastric acid secretions. Care should be exercised in treating patients 
with active gastric or duodenal ulcers or patients predisposed to these conditions. 
Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or 
obstructive pulmonary disease. 
Cholinomimetics may induce or exacerbate urinary obstruction and seizures. Caution is recommended in 
treating patients predisposed to such diseases. 
The use of rivastigmine in patients with severe dementia of Alzheimer’s disease or associated with 
Parkinson’s disease, other types of dementia or other types of memory impairment (e.g. age-related 
cognitive decline) has not been investigated and therefore use in these patient populations is not 
recommended. 
Like other cholinomimetics, rivastigmine may exacerbate or induce extrapyramidal symptoms. 
Worsening (including bradykinesia, dyskinesia, gait abnormality) and an increased incidence or severity 
of tremor have been observed in patients with dementia associated with Parkinson’s disease (see section 
4.8). These events led to the discontinuation of rivastigmine in some cases (e.g. discontinuations due to 
tremor 1.7% on rivastigmine vs 0% on placebo). Clinical monitoring is recommended for these adverse 
reactions. 
Special populations 
Patients with clinically significant renal or hepatic impairment might experience more adverse reactions 
(see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Dosing recommendations to titrate according to individual tolerability must be 
closely followed. Patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied. However, Exelon may 
be used in this patient population and close monitoring is necessary. 
Patients with body weight below 50 kg may experience more adverse reactions and may be more likely 
to discontinue due to adverse reactions. 
Excipients with known effects 
One of the excipients in Exelon oral solution is sodium benzoate (E211). Benzoic acid is a mild irritant 
to the skin, eyes and mucous membrane. 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per ml, that is to say essentially 
'sodium-free'. 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
As a cholinesterase inhibitor, rivastigmine may exaggerate the effects of succinylcholine-type muscle 
relaxants during anaesthesia. Caution is recommended when selecting anaesthetic agents. Possible dose 
adjustments or temporarily stopping treatment can be considered if needed. 
In view of its pharmacodynamic effects and possible additive effects, rivastigmine should not be given 
concomitantly with other cholinomimetic substances. Rivastigmine might interfere with the activity of 
anticholinergic medicinal products (e.g oxybutynin, tolterodine). 
Additive effects leading to bradycardia (which may result in syncope) have been reported with the 
combined use of various beta-blockers (including atenolol) and rivastigmine. Cardiovascular beta- 
blockers are expected to be associated with the greatest risk, but reports have also been received in 
patients using other beta- blockers. Therefore, caution should be exercised when rivastigmine is 
combined with beta-blockers and also other bradycardia agents (e.g.class III antiarrhythmic agents, 
calcium channel antagonists, digitalis glycoside, pilocarpin). 
Since bradycardia constitutes a risk factor in the occurrence of torsades de pointes, the combination of 
rivastigmine with QT prolongation- or torsades de pointes-inducing medicinal products such as 
antipsychotics i.e. some phenothiazines (chlorpromazine, levomepromazine), benzamides (sulpiride, 
sultopride, amisulpride, tiapride, veralipride), pimozide, haloperidol, droperidol, cisapride, citalopram, 
diphemanil, erythromycin IV, halofantrin, mizolastin, methadone, pentamidine and moxifloxacine 
should be observed with caution and clinical monitoring (ECG) may also be required. 
No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between rivastigmine and digoxin, warfarin, diazepam or 
fluoxetine in studies in healthy volunteers. The increase in prothrombin time induced by warfarin is not 
affected by administration of rivastigmine. No untoward effects on cardiac conduction were observed 
following concomitant administration of digoxin and rivastigmine. 
According to its metabolism, metabolic interactions with other medicinal products appear unlikely, 
although rivastigmine may inhibit the butyrylcholinesterase mediated metabolism of other substances. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
In pregnant animals, rivastigmine and/or metabolites crossed the placenta. It is not known if this occurs 
in humans. No clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. In peri/postnatal studies in rats, an 
increased gestation time was observed. Rivastigmine should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly 
necessary. 
Breast-feeding 
In animals, rivastigmine is excreted in milk. It is not known if rivastigmine is excreted into human milk. 
Therefore, women on rivastigmine should not breast-feed. 
Fertility 
No adverse effects of rivastigmine were observed on fertility or reproductive performance in rats (see 
section 5.3). Effects of rivastigmine on human fertility are not known. 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Alzheimer’s disease may cause gradual impairment of driving performance or compromise the ability to 
use machinery. Furthermore, rivastigmine can induce dizziness and somnolence, mainly when initiating 
treatment or increasing the dose. As a consequence, rivastigmine has minor or moderate influence on the 
ability to drive and use machines. Therefore, the ability of patients with dementia on rivastigmine to 
continue driving or operating complex machines should be routinely evaluated by the treating physician. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions (ADRs) are gastrointestinal, including nausea (38%) and 
vomiting (23%), especially during titration. Female patients in clinical studies were found to be more 
susceptible than male patients to gastrointestinal adverse reactions and weight loss. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms 
Most cases of accidental overdose have not been associated with any clinical signs or symptoms and 
almost all of the patients concerned continued rivastigmine treatment 24 hours after the overdose. 
Cholinergic toxicity has been reported with muscarinic symptoms that are observed with moderate 
poisonings such as miosis, flushing, digestive disorders including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and 
diarrhoea, bradycardia, bronchospasm and increased bronchial secretions, hyperhidrosis, involuntary 
urination and/or defecation, lacrimation, hypotension and salivary hypersecretion. 
In more severe cases nicotinic effects might develop such as muscular weakness, fasciculations, seizures 
and respiratory arrest with possible fatal outcome. 
Additionaly there have been post-marketing cases of dizziness, tremor, headache, somnolence, 
confusional state, hypertension, hallucinations and malaise. 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Management 
As rivastigmine has a plasma half-life of about 1 hour and a duration of acetylcholinesterase inhibition of 
about 9 hours, it is recommended that in cases of asymptomatic overdose no further dose of rivastigmine 
should be administered for the next 24 hours. In overdose accompanied by severe nausea and vomiting, 
the use of antiemetics should be considered. Symptomatic treatment for other adverse reactions should 
be given as necessary. 
In massive overdose, atropine can be used. An initial dose of 0.03 mg/kg intravenous atropine sulphate is 
recommended, with subsequent doses based on clinical response. Use of scopolamine as an antidote is 
not recommended.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: psychoanaleptics, anticholinesterases, ATC code: N06DA03 
Rivastigmine is an acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor of the carbamate type, thought to 
facilitate cholinergic neurotransmission by slowing the degradation of acetylcholine released by 
functionally intact cholinergic neurones. Thus, rivastigmine may have an ameliorative effect on 
cholinergic-mediated cognitive deficits in dementia associated with Alzheimer’s disease and 
Parkinson’s disease. 
Rivastigmine interacts with its target enzymes by forming a covalently bound complex that 
temporarily inactivates the enzymes. In healthy young men, an oral 3 mg dose decreases 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in CSF by approximately 40% within the first 1.5 hours after 
administration. Activity of the enzyme returns to baseline levels about 9 hours after the maximum 
inhibitory effect has been achieved. In patients with Alzheimer’s disease, inhibition of AChE in CSF 
by rivastigmine was dose-dependent up to 6 mg given twice daily, the highest dose tested. Inhibition 
of butyrylcholinesterase activity in CSF of 14 Alzheimer patients treated by rivastigmine was similar 
to that of AChE. 
Clinical studies in Alzheimer’s dementia 
The efficacy of rivastigmine has been established through the use of three independent, domain 
specific, assessment tools which were assessed at periodic intervals during 6 month treatment periods. 
These include the ADAS-Cog (Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive subscale, a 
performance based measure of cognition), the CIBIC-Plus (Clinician’s Interview Based Impression of 
Change-Plus, a comprehensive global assessment of the patient by the physician incorporating 
caregiver input), and the PDS (Progressive Deterioration Scale, a caregiver-rated assessment of the 
activities of daily living including personal hygiene, feeding, dressing, household chores such as 
shopping, retention of ability to orient oneself to surroundings as well as involvement in activities 
relating to finances, etc.). 
The patients studied had an MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) score of 10–24. 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The results for clinically relevant responders pooled from two flexible dose studies out of the three 
pivotal 26-week multicentre studies in patients with mild-to-moderately severe Alzheimer’s Dementia, 
are provided in Table 4 below. Clinically relevant improvement in these studies was defined a priori as 
at least 4-point improvement on the ADAS-Cog, improvement on the CIBIC-Plus, or at least a 10% 
improvement on the PDS. 
In addition, a post-hoc definition of response is provided in the same table. The secondary definition 
of response required a 4-point or greater improvement on the ADAS-Cog, no worsening on the 
CIBIC-Plus, and no worsening on the PDS. The mean actual daily dose for responders in the 6–12 mg 
group, corresponding to this definition, was 9.3 mg. It is important to note that the scales used in this 
indication vary and direct comparisons of results for different therapeutic agents are not valid.

Clinical studies in dementia associated with Parkinson’s disease 
The efficacy of rivastigmine in dementia associated with Parkinson’s disease has been demonstrated in 
a 24-week multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled core study and its 24-week open-label 
extension phase. Patients involved in this study had an MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) score 
of 10–24. Efficacy has been established by the use of two independent scales which were assessed at 
regular intervals during a 6-month treatment period as shown in Table 5 below: the ADAS-Cog, a 
measure of cognition, and the global measure ADCS-CGIC (Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study-
Clinician’s Global Impression of Change).

Although a treatment effect was demonstrated in the overall study population, the data suggested that a 
larger treatment effect relative to placebo was seen in the subgroup of patients with moderate dementia 
associated with Parkinson’s disease. Similarly a larger treatment effect was observed in those patients 
with visual hallucinations (see Table 6).

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Exelon in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of Alzheimer’s dementia and in the 
treatment of dementia in patients with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (see section 4.2 for information 
on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Rivastigmine is rapidly and completely absorbed. Peak plasma concentrations are reached in 
approximately 1 hour. As a consequence of rivastigmine’s interaction with its target enzyme, the 
increase in bioavailability is about 1.5-fold greater than that expected from the increase in dose. Absolute 
bioavailability after a 3 mg dose is about 36%  13%. Administration of rivastigmine oral solution with 
food delays absorption (tmax) by 74 min and lowers Cmax by 43% and increases AUC by approximately 
9%. 
Distribution 
Protein binding of rivastigmine is approximately 40%. It readily crosses the blood brain barrier and has 
an apparent volume of distribution in the range of 1.8–2.7 l/kg. 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Biotransformation 
Rivastigmine is rapidly and extensively metabolised (half-life in plasma approximately 1 hour), 
primarily via cholinesterase-mediated hydrolysis to the decarbamylated metabolite. In vitro, this 
metabolite shows minimal inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (<10%). 
Based on in vitro studies, no pharmacokinetic interaction is expected with medicinal products 
metabolised by the following cytochromes isoemzymes: CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, CYP2E1, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, or CYP2B6. Based on evidence from animal studies the major 
cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are minimally involved in rivastigmine metabolism. Total plasma 
clearance of rivastigmine was approximately 130 l/h after a 0.2 mg intravenous dose and decreased to 
70 l/h after a 2.7 mg intravenous dose. 
Elimination 
Unchanged rivastigmine is not found in the urine; renal excretion of the metabolites is the major route of 
elimination. Following administration of 14C-rivastigmine, renal elimination was rapid and essentially 
complete (>90%) within 24 hours. Less than 1% of the administered dose is excreted in the faeces. There 
is no accumulation of rivastigmine or the decarbamylated metabolite in patients with Alzheimer’s 
disease. 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that nicotine use increases the oral clearance of 
rivastigmine by 23% in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (n=75 smokers and 549 non-smokers) 
following rivastigmine oral capsule doses of up to 12 mg/day. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
While bioavailability of rivastigmine is greater in elderly than in young healthy volunteers, studies in 
Alzheimer patients aged between 50 and 92 years showed no change in bioavailability with age. 
Hepatic impairment 
The Cmax of rivastigmine was approximately 60% higher and the AUC of rivastigmine was more than 
twice as high in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment than in healthy subjects. 
Renal impairment 
Cmax and AUC of rivastigmine were more than twice as high in subjects with moderate renal impairment 
compared with healthy subjects; however there were no changes in Cmax and AUC of rivastigmine in 
subjects with severe renal impairment. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Repeated-dose toxicity studies in rats, mice and dogs revealed only effects associated with an 
exaggerated pharmacological action. No target organ toxicity was observed. No safety margins to human 
exposure were achieved in the animal studies due to the sensitivity of the animal models used. 
Rivastigmine was not mutagenic in a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo tests, except in a 
chromosomal aberration test in human peripheral lymphocytes at a dose 104 times the maximum clinical 
exposure. The in vivo micronucleus test was negative. The major metabolite NAP226-90 also did not 
show a genotoxic potential. 
No evidence of carcinogenicity was found in studies in mice and rats at the maximum tolerated dose, 
although the exposure to rivastigmine and its metabolites was lower than the human exposure. When 
normalised to body surface area, the exposure to rivastigmine and its metabolites was approximately 
equivalent to the maximum recommended human dose of 12 mg/day; however, when compared to the 
maximum human dose, a multiple of approximately 6-fold was achieved in animals. 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In animals, rivastigmine crosses the placenta and is excreted into milk. Oral studies in pregnant rats and 
rabbits gave no indication of teratogenic potential on the part of rivastigmine. In oral studies with male 
and female rats, no adverse effects of rivastigmine were observed on fertility or reproductive 
performance of either the parent generation or the offspring of the parents. 
A mild eye/mucosal irritation potential of rivastigmine was identified in a rabbit study.

4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and treatment 
of Alzheimer’s dementia. Diagnosis should be made according to current guidelines. Similar to any 
treatment initiated in patients with dementia, therapy with rivastigmine should only be started if a 
caregiver is available to regularly administer and monitor the treatment.

Initial dose 
Treatment is started with 4.6 mg/24 h. 
Maintenance dose 
After a minimum of four weeks of treatment and if well tolerated according to the treating physician, the 
dose of 4.6 mg/24 h should be increased to 9.5 mg/24 h, the daily recommended effective dose, which 
should be continued for as long as the patient continues to demonstrate therapeutic benefit. 
Dose escalation 
9.5 mg/24 h is the recommended daily effective dose which should be continued for as long as the 
patient continues to demonstrate therapeutic benefit. If well tolerated and only after a minimum of six 
months of treatment at 9.5 mg/24 h, the treating physician may consider increasing the dose to 
13.3 mg/24 h in patients who have demonstrated a meaningful cognitive deterioration (e.g. decrease in 
the MMSE) and/or functional decline (based on physician judgement) while on the recommended daily 
effective dose of 9.5 mg/24 h (see section 5.1). 
The clinical benefit of rivastigmine should be reassessed on a regular basis. Discontinuation should also 
be considered when evidence of a therapeutic effect at the optimal dose is no longer present. 
Treatment should be temporarily interrupted if gastrointestinal adverse reactions are observed until 
these adverse reactions resolve. Transdermal patch treatment can be resumed at the same dose if 
treatment is not interrupted for more than three days. Otherwise treatment should be re-initiated with 
4.6 mg/24 h. 
Switching from capsules or oral solution to transdermal patches 
Based on comparable exposure between oral and transdermal rivastigmine (see section 5.2), patients 
treated with Exelon capsules or oral solution can be switched to Exelon transdermal patches as 
follows: 
• 
A patient on a dose of 3 mg/day oral rivastigmine can be switched to 4.6 mg/24 h transdermal 
patches. 
A patient on a dose of 6 mg/day oral rivastigmine can be switched to 4.6 mg/24 h transdermal 
patches. 
A patient on a stable and well tolerated dose of 9 mg/day oral rivastigmine can be switched to 
9.5 mg/24 h transdermal patches. If the oral dose of 9 mg/day has not been stable and well 
tolerated, a switch to 4.6 mg/24 h transdermal patches is recommended. 
A patient on a dose of 12 mg/day oral rivastigmine can be switched to 9.5 mg/24 h transdermal 
patches. 
• 
• 
• 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
After switching to 4.6 mg/24 h transdermal patches, provided these are well tolerated after a minimum of 
four weeks of treatment, the dose of 4.6 mg/24 h should be increased to 9.5 mg/24 h, which is the 
recommended effective dose. 
It is recommended to apply the first transdermal patch on the day following the last oral dose. 
Special populations 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Paediatric population: There is no relevant use of Exelon in the paediatric population in the 
treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. 
Patients with body weight below 50 kg: Particular caution should be exercised in titrating 
patients with body weight below 50 kg above the recommended effective dose of 9.5 mg/24 h 
(see section 4.4). They may experience more adverse reactions and may be more likely to 
discontinue due to adverse reactions. 
Hepatic impairment: Due to increased exposure in mild to moderate hepatic impairment as 
observed with the oral formulation, dosing recommendations to titrate according to individual 
tolerability should be closely followed. Patients with clinically significant hepatic impairment 
may experience more dose-dependent adverse reactions. Patients with severe hepatic impairment 
have not been studied. Particular caution should be exercised in titrating these patients (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Renal impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment (see 
section 5.2). 
Method of administration 
Transdermal patches should be applied once a day to clean, dry, hairless, intact healthy skin on the upper 
or lower back, upper arm or chest, in a place which will not be rubbed by tight clothing. It is not 
recommended to apply the transdermal patch to the thigh or to the abdomen due to decreased 
bioavailability of rivastigmine observed when the transdermal patch is applied to these areas of the body. 
The transdermal patch should not be applied to skin that is red, irritated or cut. Reapplication to the exact 
same skin location within 14 days should be avoided to minimise the potential risk of skin irritation. 
Patients and caregivers should be instructed on important administration instructions: 
• 
• 
The previous day’s patch must be removed before applying a new one every day (see section 4.9). 
The patch should be replaced by a new one after 24 hours. Only one patch should be worn at a 
time (see section 4.9). 
The patch should be pressed down firmly for at least 30 seconds using the palm of the hand until 
the edges stick well. 
If the patch falls off, a new one should be applied for the rest of the day, then it should be replaced 
at the same time as usual the next day. 
The patch can be used in everyday situations, including bathing and during hot weather. 
The patch should not be exposed to any external heat sources (e.g. excessive sunlight, saunas, 
solarium) for long periods of time. 
The patch should not be cut into pieces. 
•

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance rivastigmine, to other carbamate derivatives or to any of the 
excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Previous history of application site reactions suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis with rivastigmine 
patch (see section 4.4).

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
The incidence and severity of adverse reactions generally increase with increasing doses, particularly 
at dose changes. If treatment is interrupted for more than three days, it should be re-initiated with 
4.6 mg/24 h. 
Misuse of the medicinal product and dosing errors resulting in overdose 
Misuse of the medicinal product and dosing errors with Exelon transdermal patch have resulted in 
serious adverse reactions; some cases have required hospitalisation, and rarely led to death (see section 
4.9). Most cases of misuse of the medicinal product and dosing errors have involved not removing the 
old patch when putting on a new one and the use of multiple patches at the same time. Patients and 
their caregivers must be instructed on important administration instructions for Exelon transdermal 
patch (see section 4.2). 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
Gastrointestinal disorders such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea are dose-related, and may occur 
when initiating treatment and/or increasing the dose (see section 4.8). These adverse reactions occur 
more commonly in women. Patients who show signs or symptoms of dehydration resulting from 
prolonged vomiting or diarrhoea can be managed with intravenous fluids and dose reduction or 
discontinuation if recognised and treated promptly. Dehydration can be associated with serious 
outcomes. 
Weight loss 
Patients with Alzheimer’s disease may lose weight whilst taking cholinesterase inhibitors, including 
rivastigmine. The patient’s weight should be monitored during therapy with Exelon transdermal 
patches. 
Bradycardia 
Electrocardiogram QT prolongation may occur in patients treated with certain cholinesterase inhibitor 
products including rivastigmine. Rivastigmine may cause bradycardia which constitutes a risk factor 
in the occurrence of torsade de pointes, predominantly in patients with risk factors. Caution is advised 
in patients with pre-existing, or a family history of, QTc prolongation or at higher risk of developing 
torsade de pointes; for example, those with uncompensated heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, 
bradyarrhythmias, a predisposition to hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia, or concomitant use with 
medicinal products known to induce QT prolongation and/or torsade de pointes. Clinical monitoring 
(ECG) may also be required (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). 
Other adverse reactions 
Care must be taken when prescribing Exelon transdermal patches: 
• 
to patients with sick sinus syndrome or conduction defects (sino-atrial block, atrio-ventricular 
block) (see section 4.8); 
to patients with active gastric or duodenal ulcers or patients predisposed to these conditions 
because rivastigmine may cause increased gastric secretions (see section 4.8); 
to patients predisposed to urinary obstruction and seizures because cholinomimetics may induce 
or exacerbate these diseases; 
to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease. 
• 
• 
• 
Skin application site reactions 
Skin application site reactions may occur with rivastigmine patch and are usually mild or moderate in 
intensity. Patients and caregivers should be instructed accordingly. 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
These reactions are not in themselves an indication of sensitisation. However, use of rivastigmine 
patch may lead to allergic contact dermatitis. 
Allergic contact dermatitis should be suspected if application site reactions spread beyond the patch 
size, if there is evidence of a more intense local reaction (e.g. increasing erythema, oedema, papules, 
vesicles) and if symptoms do not significantly improve within 48 hours after patch removal. In these 
cases, treatment should be discontinued (see section 4.3). 
Patients who develop application site reactions suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis to rivastigmine 
patch and who still require rivastigmine treatment should only be switched to oral rivastigmine after 
negative allergy testing and under close medical supervision. It is possible that some patients 
sensitised to rivastigmine by exposure to rivastigmine patch may not be able to take rivastigmine in 
any form. 
There have been rare post-marketing reports of patients experiencing allergic dermatitis 
(disseminated) when administered rivastigmine irrespective of the route of administration (oral, 
transdermal). In these cases, treatment should be discontinued (see section 4.3). 
Other warnings and precautions 
Rivastigmine may exacerbate or induce extrapyramidal symptoms. 
Contact with the eyes should be avoided after handling Exelon transdermal patches (see section 5.3). 
Hands should be washed with soap and water after removing the patch. In case of contact with eyes or if 
the eyes become red after handling the patch, rinse immediately with plenty of water and seek medical 
advice if symptoms do not resolve. 
Special populations 
• 
• 
Patients with body weight below 50 kg may experience more adverse reactions and may be 
more likely to discontinue due to adverse reactions (see section 4.2). Carefully titrate and 
monitor these patients for adverse reactions (e.g. excessive nausea or vomiting) and consider 
reducing the maintenance dose to the 4.6 mg/24 h transdermal patch if such adverse reactions 
develop. 
Hepatic impairment: Patients with clinically significant hepatic impairment may experience 
more adverse reactions. Dosing recommendations to titrate according to individual tolerability 
must be closely followed. Patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied. 
Particular caution must be exercised in titrating these patients (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No specific interaction studies have been performed with Exelon transdermal patches. 
As a cholinesterase inhibitor, rivastigmine may exaggerate the effects of succinylcholine-type muscle 
relaxants during anaesthesia. Caution is recommended when selecting anaesthetic agents. Possible dose 
adjustments or temporarily stopping treatment can be considered if needed. 
In view of its pharmacodynamic effects and possible additive effects, rivastigmine should not be given 
concomitantly with other cholinomimetic substances. Rivastigmine might interfere with the activity of 
anticholinergic medicinal products (e.g. oxybutynin, tolterodine). 
Additive effects leading to bradycardia (which may result in syncope) have been reported with the 
combined use of various beta-blockers (including atenolol) and rivastigmine. Cardiovascular beta-
blockers are expected to be associated with the greatest risk, but reports have also been received in 
patients using other beta-blockers. Therefore, caution should be exercised when rivastigmine is 
combined with beta-blockers and also other bradycardia agents (e.g.class III antiarrhythmic agents, 
calcium channel antagonists, digitalis glycoside, pilocarpin). 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Since bradycardia constitutes a risk factor in the occurrence of torsades de pointes, the combination of 
rivastigmine with QT prolongation- or torsades de pointes-inducing medicinal products such as 
antipsychotics i.e. some phenothiazines (chlorpromazine, levomepromazine), benzamides (sulpiride, 
sultopride, amisulpride, tiapride, veralipride), pimozide, haloperidol, droperidol, cisapride, citalopram, 
diphemanil, erythromycin IV, halofantrin, mizolastin, methadone, pentamidine and moxifloxacine 
should be observed with caution and clinical monitoring (ECG) may also be required. 
No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between oral rivastigmine and digoxin, warfarin, 
diazepam or fluoxetine in studies in healthy volunteers. The increase in prothrombin time induced by 
warfarin is not affected by administration of oral rivastigmine. No untoward effects on cardiac 
conduction were observed following concomitant administration of digoxin and oral rivastigmine. 
Concomitant administration of rivastigmine with commonly prescribed medicinal products, such as 
antacids, antiemetics, antidiabetics, centrally acting antihypertensives, calcium channel blockers, 
inotropic agents, antianginals, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, oestrogens, analgesics, 
benzodiazepines and antihistamines, was not associated with an alteration in the kinetics of rivastigmine 
or an increased risk of clinically relevant untoward effects. 
According to its metabolism, metabolic interactions with other medicinal products appear unlikely, 
although rivastigmine may inhibit the butyrylcholinesterase mediated metabolism of other substances. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
In pregnant animals, rivastigmine and /or metabolites crossed the placenta. It is not known if this occurs 
in humans. No clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. In peri/postnatal studies in rats, an 
increased gestation time was observed. Rivastigmine should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly 
necessary. 
Breast-feeding 
In animals, rivastigmine is excreted in milk. It is not known if rivastigmine is excreted into human milk. 
Therefore, women on rivastigmine should not breast-feed. 
Fertility 
No adverse effects of rivastigmine were observed on fertility or reproductive performance in rats (see 
section 5.3). Effects of rivastigmine on human fertility are not known. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Alzheimer’s disease may cause gradual impairment of driving performance or compromise the ability to 
use machines. Furthermore, rivastigmine may induce syncope or delirium. As a consequence, 
rivastigmine has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Therefore, in 
patients with dementia treated with rivastigmine, the ability to continue driving or operating complex 
machines should be routinely evaluated by the treating physician. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Application site skin reactions (usually mild to moderate application site erythema), are the most 
frequent adverse reactions observed with the use of Exelon transdermal patch. The next most common 
adverse reactions are gastrointestinal in nature including nausea and vomiting.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
When doses higher than 13.3 mg/24 h were used in the above-mentioned placebo-controlled study, 
insomnia and cardiac failure were observed more frequently than with 13.3 mg/24 h or placebo, 
suggesting a dose effect relationship. However, these events did not occur at a higher frequency with 
Exelon 13.3 mg/24 h transdermal patches than with placebo. 
The following adverse reactions have only been observed with Exelon capsules and oral solution and not 
in clinical studies with Exelon transdermal patches: malaise, confusion, sweating increased (common); 
duodenal ulcers, angina pectoris (rare); gastrointestinal haemorrhage (very rare); and some cases of 
severe vomiting were associated with oesophageal rupture (not known). 
Skin irritation 
In double-blind controlled clinical trials, application site reactions were mostly mild to moderate in 
severity. The incidence of application site skin reactions leading to discontinuation was ≤2.3% in patients 
treated with Exelon transdermal patches. The incidence of application site skin reactions leading to 
discontinuation was higher in the Asian population with 4.9% and 8.4% in the Chinese and Japanese 
population respectively. 
In two 24-week double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, skin reactions were measured at each 
visit using a skin irritation rating scale. When observed in patients treated with Exelon transdermal 
patches, skin irritation was mostly slight or mild in severity. It was rated as severe in ≤2.2% of patients 
in these studies and in ≤3.7% of patients treated with Exelon transdermal patches in a Japanese study. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms 
Most cases of accidental overdose of oral rivastigmine have not been associated with any clinical signs 
or symptoms and almost all of the patients concerned continued rivastigmine treatment 24 hours after the 
overdose. 
Cholinergic toxicity has been reported with muscarinic symptoms that are observed with moderate 
poisonings such as miosis, flushing, digestive disorders including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and 
diarrhoea, bradycardia, bronchospasm and increased bronchial secretions, hyperhidrosis, involuntary 
urination and/or defecation, lacrimation, hypotension and salivary hypersecretion. 
In more severe cases nicotinic effects might develop such as muscular weakness, fasciculations, seizures 
and respiratory arrest with possible fatal outcome. 
Additionaly there have been post-marketing cases of dizziness, tremor, headache, somnolence, 
confusional state, hypertension, hallucinations and malaise. Overdose with Exelon transdermal patch 
resulting from misuse/dosing errors (application of multiple patches at a time) has been reported in the 
post-marketing setting and rarely in clinical trials. 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Management 
As rivastigmine has a plasma half-life of about 3.4 hours and a duration of acetylcholinesterase 
inhibition of about 9 hours, it is recommended that in cases of asymptomatic overdose all Exelon 
transdermal patches should be removed immediately and no further transdermal patch should be applied 
for the next 24 hours. In overdose accompanied by severe nausea and vomiting, the use of antiemetics 
should be considered. Symptomatic treatment for other adverse reactions should be given as necessary. 
In massive overdose, atropine can be used. An initial dose of 0.03 mg/kg intravenous atropine sulphate is 
recommended, with subsequent doses based on clinical response. Use of scopolamine as an antidote is 
not recommended.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: psychoanaleptics, anticholinesterases, ATC code: N06DA03 
Rivastigmine is an acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor of the carbamate type, thought to 
facilitate cholinergic neurotransmission by slowing the degradation of acetylcholine released by 
functionally intact cholinergic neurones. Thus, rivastigmine may have an ameliorative effect on 
cholinergic-mediated cognitive deficits in dementia associated with Alzheimer’s disease. 
Rivastigmine interacts with its target enzymes by forming a covalently bound complex that 
temporarily inactivates the enzymes. In healthy young men, an oral 3 mg dose decreases 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in CSF by approximately 40% within the first 1.5 hours after 
administration. Activity of the enzyme returns to baseline levels about 9 hours after the maximum 
inhibitory effect has been achieved. In patients with Alzheimer’s disease, inhibition of AChE in CSF 
by oral rivastigmine was dose-dependent up to 6 mg given twice daily, the highest dose tested. 
Inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase activity in CSF of 14 Alzheimer patients treated by oral 
rivastigmine was similar to the inhibition of AChE activity. 
Clinical studies in Alzheimer’s dementia 
The efficacy of Exelon transdermal patches in patients with Alzheimer’s dementia has been 
demonstrated in a 24-week double-blind, placebo-controlled core study and its open-label extension 
phase and in a 48-week double-blind comparator study. 
24-week placebo-controlled study 
Patients involved in the placebo-controlled study had an MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) 
score of 10–20. Efficacy was established by the use of independent, domain-specific assessment tools 
which were applied at regular intervals during the 24-week treatment period. These include the 
ADAS-Cog (Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive subscale, a performance-based 
measure of cognition) and the ADCS-CGIC (Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study – Clinician’s 
Global Impression of Change, a comprehensive global assessment of the patient by the physician 
incorporating caregiver input), and the ADCS-ADL (Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study – 
Activities of Daily Living, a caregiver-rated assessment of the activities of daily living including 
personal hygiene, feeding, dressing, household chores such as shopping, retention of ability to orient 
oneself to surroundings as well as involvement in activities related to finances). The 24-week results 
for the three assessment tools are summarised in Table 2.

48-week active comparator controlled study 
Patients involved in the active comparator controlled study had an initial baseline MMSE score of 
10-24. The study was designed to compare the efficacy of the 13.3 mg/24 h transdermal patch against 
the 9.5 mg/24 h transdermal patch during a 48-week double-blind treatment phase in Alzheimer’s 
disease patients who demonstrated functional and cognitive decline after an initial 24-48 week open-
label treatment phase while on a maintenance dose of 9.5 mg/24 h transdermal patch. Functional 
decline was assessed by the investigator and cognitive decline was defined as a decrease in the MMSE 
score of >2 points from the previous visit or a decrease of >3 points from baseline. Efficacy was 
established by the use of ADAS-Cog (Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive subscale, a 
performance-based measure of cognition) and the ADCS-IADL (Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative 
Study – Instrumental Activities of Daily Living) assessing instrumental activities which include 
maintaining finances, meal preparation, shopping, ability to orient oneself to surroundings, ability to 
be left unattended. The 48-week results for the two assessment tools are summarised in Table 4.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Absorption of rivastigmine from Exelon transdermal patches is slow. After the first dose, detectable 
plasma concentrations are observed after a lag time of 0.5-1 hour. Cmax is reached after 10-16 hours. 
After the peak, plasma concentrations slowly decrease over the remainder of the 24-hour period of 
application. With multiple dosing (such as at steady state), after the previous transdermal patch is 
replaced with a new one, plasma concentrations initially decrease slowly for about 40 minutes on 
average, until absorption from the newly applied transdermal patch becomes faster than elimination, 
and plasma levels begin to rise again to reach a new peak at approximately 8 hours. At steady state, 
trough levels are approximately 50% of peak levels, in contrast to oral administration, with which 
concentrations fall off to virtually zero between doses. Although less pronounced than with the oral 
formulation, exposure to rivastigmine (Cmax and AUC) increased over-proportionally by a factor of 2.6 
and 4.9 when escalating from 4.6 mg/24 h to 9.5 mg/24 h and to 13.3 mg/24 h, respectively. The 
fluctuation index (FI), a measure of the relative difference between peak and trough concentrations 
((Cmax-Cmin)/Cavg), was 0.58 for Exelon 4.6 mg/24 h transdermal patches, 0.77 for Exelon 9.5 mg/24 h 
transdermal patches and 0.72 for Exelon 13.3 mg/24 h transdermal patches, thus demonstrating a 
much smaller fluctuation between trough and peak concentrations than for the oral formulation (FI = 
3.96 (6 mg/day) and 4.15 (12 mg/day)). 
The dose of rivastigmine released from the transdermal patch over 24 hours (mg/24 h) cannot be 
directly equated to the amount (mg) of rivastigmine contained in a capsule with respect to plasma 
concentration produced over 24 hours. 
The single-dose inter-subject variability in rivastigmine pharmacokinetic parameters (normalised to 
dose/kg bodyweight) was 43% (Cmax) and 49% (AUC0-24h) after transdermal administration versus 
74% and 103%, respectively, after the oral form. The inter-patient variability in a steady-state study in 
Alzheimer’s dementia was at most 45% (Cmax) and 43% (AUC0-24h) after use of the transdermal patch, 
and 71% and 73%, respectively, after administration of the oral form. 
A relationship between active substance exposure at steady state (rivastigmine and metabolite 
NAP226-90) and bodyweight was observed in Alzheimer’s dementia patients. Compared to a patient 
with a body weight of 65 kg, the rivastigmine steady-state concentrations in a patient with a body 
weight of 35 kg would be approximately doubled, while for a patient with a body weight of 100 kg the 
concentrations would be approximately halved. The effect of bodyweight on active substance 
exposure suggests special attention to patients with very low body weight during up-titration (see 
section 4.4). 
Exposure (AUC∞) to rivastigmine (and metabolite NAP266-90) was highest when the transdermal 
patch was applied to the upper back, chest, or upper arm and approximately 20–30% lower when 
applied to the abdomen or thigh. 
There was no relevant accumulation of rivastigmine or the metabolite NAP226-90 in plasma in patients 
with Alzheimer’s disease, except that plasma levels were higher on the second day of transdermal patch 
therapy than on the first. 
Distribution 
Rivastigmine is weakly bound to plasma proteins (approximately 40%). It readily crosses the blood-brain 
barrier and has an apparent volume of distribution in the range of 1.8-2.7 l/kg. 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Biotransformation 
Rivastigmine is rapidly and extensively metabolised with an apparent elimination half-life in plasma of 
approximately 3.4 hours after removal of the transdermal patch. Elimination was absorption rate limited 
(flip-flop kinetics), which explains the longer t½ after transdermal patch (3.4 h) versus oral or intravenous 
administrations (1.4 to 1.7 h). Metabolism is primarily via cholinesterase-mediated hydrolysis to the 
metabolite NAP226-90. In vitro, this metabolite shows minimal inhibition of acetylcholinesterase 
(<10%). 
Based on in vitro studies, no pharmacokinetic interaction is expected with medicinal products 
metabolised by the following cytochrome isoenzymes: CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, CYP2E1, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, or CYP2B6. Based on evidence from animal studies, the major 
cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are minimally involved in rivastigmine metabolism. Total plasma 
clearance of rivastigmine was approximately 130 litres/h after a 0.2 mg intravenous dose and decreased 
to 70 litres/h after a 2.7 mg intravenous dose, which is consistent with the non-linear, over-proportional 
pharmacokinetics of rivastigmine due to saturation of its elimination. 
The metabolite-to-parent AUC∞ ratio was around 0.7 after transdermal patch administration versus 3.5 
after oral administration, indicating that much less metabolism occurred after dermal compared to oral 
treatment. Less NAP226-90 is formed following application of the transdermal patch, presumably 
because of the lack of presystemic (hepatic first pass) metabolism, in contrast to oral administration. 
Elimination 
Unchanged rivastigmine is found in trace amounts in the urine; renal excretion of the metabolites is the 
major route of elimination after transdermal patch administration. Following administration of oral 14C-
rivastigmine, renal elimination was rapid and essentially complete (>90%) within 24 hours. Less than 
1% of the administered dose is excreted in the faeces. 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that nicotine use increases the oral clearance of 
rivastigmine by 23% in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (n=75 smokers and 549 non-smokers) 
following rivastigmine oral capsule doses for up to 12 mg/day. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
Age had no impact on the exposure to rivastigmine in Alzheimer’s disease patients treated with Exelon 
transdermal patches. 
Hepatic impairment 
No study was conducted with Exelon transdermal patches in subjects with hepatic impairment. After oral 
administration, the Cmax of rivastigmine was approximately 60% higher and the AUC of rivastigmine was 
more than twice as high in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment than in healthy subjects. 
Following a single 3 mg or 6 mg oral dose, the mean oral clearance of rivastigmine was approximately 
46-63% lower in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (n=10, Child-Pugh score 5-12, 
biopsy proven) than in healthy subjects (n=10). 
Renal impairment 
No study was conducted with Exelon transdermal patches in subjects with renal impairment. Based on 
population analysis, creatinine clearance did not show any clear effect on steady state concentrations of 
rivastigmine or its metabolite. No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment (see 
section 4.2).

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Oral and topical repeated-dose toxicity studies in mice, rats, rabbits, dogs and minipigs revealed only 
effects associated with an exaggerated pharmacological action. No target organ toxicity was observed. 
Oral and topical dosing in animal studies was limited due to the sensitivity of the animal models used. 
Rivastigmine was not mutagenic in a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo tests, except in a 
chromosomal aberration test in human peripheral lymphocytes at a dose exceeding 104 times the 
foreseen clinical exposure. The in vivo micronucleus test was negative. The major metabolite NAP226-
90 also did not show a genotoxic potential. 
No evidence of carcinogenicity was found in oral and topical studies in mice and in an oral study in 
rats at the maximum tolerated dose. The exposure to rivastigmine and its metabolites was 
approximately equivalent to human exposure with highest doses of rivastigmine capsules and 
transdermal patches. 
In animals, rivastigmine crosses the placenta and is excreted into milk. Oral studies in pregnant rats and 
rabbits gave no indication of teratogenic potential on the part of rivastigmine. In oral studies with male 
and female rats, no adverse effects of rivastigmine were observed on fertility or reproductive 
performance of either the parent generation or the offspring of the parents. Specific dermal studies in 
pregnant animals have not been conducted. 
Rivastigmine transdermal patches were not phototoxic and considered to be a non-sensitiser. In some 
other dermal toxicity studies, a mild irritant effect on the skin of laboratory animals, including controls, 
was observed. This may indicate a potential for Exelon transdermal patches to induce mild erythema in 
patients. 
A mild eye/mucosal irritation potential of rivastigmine was identified in a rabbit study. Therefore, the 
patient/caregiver should avoid contact with the eyes after handling of the patch (see section 4.4).

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Exelon is and what it is used for 
The active substance of Exelon is rivastigmine. 
Rivastigmine belongs to a class of substances called cholinesterase inhibitors. In patients with 
Alzheimer’s dementia or dementia due to Parkinson’s disease, certain nerve cells die in the brain, 
resulting in low levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (a substance that allows nerve cells to 
communicate with each other). Rivastigmine works by blocking the enzymes that break down 
acetylcholine: acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. By blocking these enzymes, Exelon 
allows levels of acetylcholine to be increased in the brain, helping to reduce the symptoms of 
Alzheimer’s disease and dementia associated with Parkinson’s disease. 
Exelon is used for the treatment of adult patients with mild to moderately severe Alzheimer’s 
dementia, a progressive brain disorder that gradually affects memory, intellectual ability and 
behaviour. The capsules and oral solution can also be used for the treatment of dementia in adult 
patients with Parkinson’s disease. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Exelon 
Do not take Exelon 
- 
- 
if you are allergic to rivastigmine (the active substance in Exelon) or any of the other ingredients 
of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
if you have a skin reaction spreading beyond the patch size, if there is a more intense local 
reaction (such as blisters, increasing skin inflammation, swelling) and if it does not improve 
within 48 hours after removal of the transdermal patch. 
If this applies to you, tell your doctor and do not take Exelon. 
95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Exelon: 
- 
if you have, or have ever had, a heart condition such as an irregular or slow heartbeat, QTc 
prolongation, a family history of QTc prolongation, torsade de pointes, or have a low blood level 
of potassium or magnesium. 
if you have, or have ever had, an active stomach ulcer. 
if you have, or have ever had, difficulties in passing urine. 
if you have, or have ever had, seizures. 
if you have, or have ever had, asthma or severe respiratory disease. 
if you have, or have ever had impaired kidney function. 
if you have, or have ever had, impaired liver function. 
if you suffer from trembling. 
if you have a low body weight. 
if you have gastrointestinal reactions such as feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting) and 
diarrhoea. You may become dehydrated (losing too much fluid) if vomiting or diarrhoea are 
prolonged. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
If any of these apply to you, your doctor may need to monitor you more closely while you are on this 
medicine. 
If you have not taken Exelon for more than three days, do not take the next dose until you have talked 
to your doctor. 
Children and adolescents 
There is no relevant use of Exelon in the paediatric population in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. 
Other medicines and Exelon 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Exelon should not be given at the same time as other medicines with similar effects to Exelon. Exelon 
might interfere with anticholinergic medicines (medicines used to relieve stomach cramps or spasms, 
to treat Parkinson’s disease or to prevent travel sickness). 
Exelon should not be given at the same time as metoclopramide (a medicine used to relieve or prevent 
nausea and vomiting). Taking the two medicines together could cause problems such as stiff limbs and 
trembling hands. 
If you have to undergo surgery whilst taking Exelon, tell your doctor before you are given any 
anaesthetics, because Exelon may exaggerate the effects of some muscle relaxants during anaesthesia. 
Caution when Exelon is taken together with beta-blockers (medicines such as atenolol used to treat 
hypertension, angina and other heart conditions). Taking the two medicines together could cause 
problems such as slowing of the heartbeat (bradycardia) leading to fainting or loss of consciousness. 
Caution when Exelon is taken together with other medicines that can affect your heart rhythm or the 
electrical system of your heart (QT prolongation). 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
If you are pregnant, the benefits of using Exelon must be assessed against the possible effects on your 
unborn child. Exelon should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. 
You should not breast-feed during treatment with Exelon. 
96 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Driving and using machines 
Your doctor will tell you whether your illness allows you to drive vehicles and use machines safely. 
Exelon may cause dizziness and somnolence, mainly at the start of treatment or when increasing the 
dose. If you feel dizzy or sleepy, do not drive, use machines or perform any tasks that require your 
attention.

How to store Exelon 
Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Exelon is and what it is used for 
The active substance of Exelon is rivastigmine. 
Rivastigmine belongs to a class of substances called cholinesterase inhibitors. In patients with 
Alzheimer’s dementia, certain nerve cells die in the brain, resulting in low levels of the 
neurotransmitter acetylcholine (a substance that allows nerve cells to communicate with each other). 
Rivastigmine works by blocking the enzymes that break down acetylcholine: acetylcholinesterase and 
butyrylcholinesterase. By blocking these enzymes, Exelon allows levels of acetylcholine to be 
increased in the brain, helping to reduce the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. 
Exelon is used for the treatment of adult patients with mild to moderately severe Alzheimer’s 
dementia, a progressive brain disorder that gradually affects memory, intellectual ability and 
behaviour. 
111 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you use Exelon 
Do not use Exelon 
- 
- 
- 
if you are allergic to rivastigmine (the active substance in Exelon) or any of the other 
ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
if you have ever had an allergic reaction to a similar type of medicine (carbamate derivatives). 
if you have a skin reaction spreading beyond the patch size, if there is a more intense local 
reaction (such as blisters, increasing skin inflammation, swelling) and if it does not improve 
within 48 hours after removal of the transdermal patch. 
If this applies to you, tell your doctor and do not apply Exelon transdermal patches. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before using Exelon: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
if you have, or have ever had, a heart condition such as an irregular or slow heartbeat, QTc 
prolongation, a family history of QTc prolongation, torsade de pointes, or have a low blood 
level of potassium or magnesium. 
if you have, or have ever had, an active stomach ulcer. 
if you have, or have ever had, difficulties in passing urine. 
if you have, or have ever had, seizures. 
if you have, or have ever had, asthma or a severe respiratory disease. 
if you suffer from trembling. 
if you have a low body weight. 
if you have gastrointestinal reactions such as feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting) and 
diarrhoea. You may become dehydrated (losing too much fluid) if vomiting or diarrhoea are 
prolonged. 
if you have impaired liver function. 
- 
If any of these apply to you, your doctor may need to monitor you more closely while you are on this 
medicine. 
If you have not applied a patch for more than three days, do not apply the next one before you have 
talked to your doctor. 
Children and adolescents 
There is no relevant use of Exelon in the paediatric population in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. 
Other medicines and Exelon 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Exelon might interfere with anticholinergic medicines some of which are medicines used to relieve 
stomach cramps or spasms (e.g. dicyclomine), to treat Parkinson’s disease (e.g. amantadine) or to 
prevent motion sickness (e.g. diphenhydramine, scopolamine, or meclizine). 
Exelon Patch should not be given at the same time as metoclopramide (a medicine used to relieve or 
prevent nausea and vomiting). Taking the two medicines together could cause problems such as stiff 
limbs and trembling hands. 
If you have to undergo surgery whilst using Exelon transdermal patches, tell your doctor that you are 
using them because they may exaggerate the effects of some muscle relaxants during anaesthesia. 
Caution when Exelon Patch is given together with beta-blockers (medicines such as atenolol used to 
treat hypertension, angina, and other heart conditions). Taking the two medicines together could cause 
problems such as slowing of the heartbeat (bradycardia) leading to fainting or loss of consciousness. 
Caution when Exelon is taken together with other medicines that can affect your heart rhythm or the 
electrical system of your heart (QT prolongation). 
112 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
If you are pregnant, the benefits of using Exelon must be assessed against the possible effects on your 
unborn child. Exelon should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. 
You should not breast-feed during treatment with Exelon transdermal patches. 
Driving and using machines 
Your doctor will tell you whether your illness allows you to drive vehicles and use machines safely. 
Exelon transdermal patches may cause fainting or severe confusion. If you feel faint or confused do 
not drive, use machines or perform any other tasks that require your attention. 
3. 
How to use Exelon 
Always use Exelon transdermal patches exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. 
IMPORTANT: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Take off the previous patch before putting ONE new patch on. 
Only one patch per day. 
Do not cut the patch into pieces. 
Press the patch firmly in place for at least 30 seconds using the palm of the hand. 
How to start treatment 
Your doctor will tell you which Exelon transdermal patch is most suitable for you. 
• 
• 
Treatment usually starts with Exelon 4.6 mg/24 h. 
The recommended usual daily dose is Exelon 9.5 mg/24 h. If well tolerated, the treating 
physician may consider increasing the dose to 13.3 mg/24 h. 
• 
Only wear one Exelon patch at a time and replace the patch with a new one after 24 hours. 
During the course of the treatment your doctor may adjust the dose to suit your individual needs. 
If you have not applied a patch for more than three days, do not apply the next one before you have 
talked to your doctor. Transdermal patch treatment can be resumed at the same dose if treatment is not 
interrupted for more than three days. Otherwise your doctor will restart your treatment on Exelon 
4.6 mg/24 h. 
Exelon can be used with food, drink and alcohol. 
113 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Where to apply your Exelon transdermal patch 
• 
• 
• 
Before you apply a patch, make sure that your skin is clean, dry and hairless, free of any 
powder, oil, moisturiser or lotion that could keep the patch from sticking to your skin properly, 
free of cuts, rashes and/or irritations. 
Carefully remove any existing patch before putting on a new one. Having multiple patches 
on your body could expose you to an excessive amount of this medicine which could be 
potentially dangerous. 
Apply ONE patch per day to ONLY ONE of the possible locations shown in the following 
diagrams: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
left upper arm or right upper arm 
left upper chest or right upper chest (avoid breast) 
left upper back or right upper back 
left lower back or right lower back 
Every 24 hours take off the previous patch before putting 
ONE new patch on to ONLY ONE of the following possible 
locations. 
Front 
Back 
OR 
OR 
OR 
OR 
OR 
OR 
OR 
When changing the patch, you must remove the previous day’s patch before you apply the new one to 
a different location of skin each time (for example on the right side of your body one day, then on the 
left side the next day, and on your upper body one day, then on your lower body the next day). Do not 
apply a new patch to the same skin area twice within 14 days. 
114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
How to apply your Exelon transdermal patch 
Exelon patches are thin, opaque, plastic patches that stick to the skin. Each patch is sealed in a sachet 
that protects it until you are ready to put it on. Do not open the sachet or remove a patch until just 
before you apply it. 
Carefully remove the existing patch before putting on a new one. 
For patients starting treatment for the first time and for patients 
restarting Exelon after treatment interruption, please begin with 
the second picture. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Each patch is sealed in its own protective sachet. 
You should only open the sachet when you are ready to 
apply the patch. 
Cut the sachet along the dotted line with scissors and 
remove the patch from the sachet. 
A protective liner covers the sticky side of the patch. 
Peel off one side of the protective liner and do not touch the 
sticky part of the patch with the fingers. 
Put the sticky side of the patch on the upper or lower back, 
upper arm or chest and then peel off the second side of the 
protective liner. 
Then press the patch firmly in place for at least 30 seconds 
using the palm of the hand to make sure that the edges stick 
well. 
If it helps you, you may write, for example, the day of the week, 
on the patch with a thin ball point pen. 
The patch should be worn continuously until it is time to replace it with a new one. You may wish to 
experiment with different locations when applying a new patch, to find ones that are most comfortable 
for you and where clothing will not rub on the patch. 
115 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
How to remove your Exelon transdermal patch 
Gently pull at one edge of the patch to remove it slowly from the skin. In case the adhesive residue is 
left over on your skin, gently soak the area with warm water and mild soap or use baby oil to remove 
it. Alcohol or other dissolving liquids (nail polish remover or other solvents) should not be used. 
You should wash your hands with soap and water after removing the patch. In case of contact with 
eyes or if the eyes become red after handling the patch, rinse immediately with plenty of water and 
seek medical advice if symptoms do not resolve. 
Can you wear your Exelon transdermal patch when you are bathing, swimming, or in the sun? 
• 
Bathing, swimming or showering should not affect the patch. Make sure the patch does not 
loosen during these activities. 
Do not expose the patch to any external heat sources (e.g. excessive sunlight, saunas, solarium) 
for long periods of time. 
• 
What to do if a patch falls off 
If a patch falls off, apply a new one for the rest of the day, then replace it at the same time as usual the 
next day. 
When and for how long to apply your Exelon transdermal patch 
• 
To benefit from treatment, you must apply a new patch every day, preferably at the same time 
of day. 
Only wear one Exelon patch at a time and replace the patch with a new one after 24 hours. 
• 
If you use more Exelon than you should 
If you accidentally apply more than one patch, remove all the patches from your skin, then inform 
your doctor that you have accidentally applied more than one patch. You may require medical 
attention. Some people who have accidentally taken too much Exelon have experienced feeling sick 
(nausea), being sick (vomiting), diarrhoea, high blood pressure and hallucinations. Slow heartbeat and 
fainting may also occur. 
If you forget to use Exelon 
If you find you have forgotten to apply a patch, apply one immediately. You may apply the next patch 
at the usual time the next day. Do not apply two patches to make up for the one that you missed. 
If you stop using Exelon 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you stop using the patch. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

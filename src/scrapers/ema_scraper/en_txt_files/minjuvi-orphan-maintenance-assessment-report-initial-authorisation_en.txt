2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
Orphan medicinal product designation 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2015 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
“The sponsor MorphoSys AG submitted on 25 September 2014 an application for designation as an 
orphan medicinal product to the European Medicines Agency for a medicinal product containing 
humanised Fc engineered monoclonal antibody against CD19 for treatment of diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”). The application was submitted on the basis of 
Article 3(1)(a) first paragraph of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products.  
Having examined the application, the COMP considered that the sponsor has established the following:  
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing humanised Fc engineered 
monoclonal antibody against CD19 was considered justified based on preliminary clinical data 
showing reduced tumour size in treated patients affected by the condition;  
the condition is chronically debilitating due to involvement of single or multiple nodal or extranodal 
sites, including the gastrointestinal tract and bone marrow and life-threatening in patients not 
responding to treatment;  
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 2.5 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made.  
Thus, the requirements under Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products are fulfilled.  
In addition, although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union, the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal 
product containing humanised Fc engineered monoclonal antibody against CD19 may be of significant 
benefit to those affected by the condition. The sponsor has provided preliminary clinical data in 
patients affected by the condition who had relapsed or did not respond to previous treatments. These 
patients showed clinically relevant responses when treated with the product. The Committee 
considered that this constitutes a clinically relevant advantage.  
Thus, the requirement under Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products is fulfilled.  
The COMP concludes that the requirements laid down in Article (3)(1) (a) and (b) of Regulation (EC) 
No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products are fulfilled. The COMP therefore recommends the 
designation of this medicinal product, containing humanised Fc engineered monoclonal antibody 
against CD19 as an orphan medicinal product for the orphan indication: treatment of diffuse large B-
cell lymphoma.”

3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) 
in adults, accounting for 30% to 40% of all cases globally (Chaganti et al,2016) and for approximately 
31% of all NHLs in Europe (Martelli et al,2013). DLBCL usually affects adults, especially around 60 to 
70 years, but also rarely occurs in adolescents and children. Hereditary and acquired 
immunodeficiencies, occupational exposures, and pharmacological immunosuppression in the setting of 
transplantation or treatment of autoimmune diseases have been identified as factors thought to 
potentially confer increased risk of developing DLBCL. 
The sponsor identified that there were significant changes to the condition since the orphan drug 
designation was initially granted in 2014. The revision of the World Health Organization classification of 
lymphoid neoplasms in 2016 (Swerdlow et al, 2016) has led to a major change in the pathological 
category of DLBCL, due to the presence of rearrangements of transcription factors MYC and BCL2 
and/or BCL6. Based on a better understanding of these genetic alterations in large B-cell lymphomas, 
the updated WHO classification has established a new category of high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL), 
with rearrangements of MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6, so-called “double-hit” lymphomas (DHL) or 
“triple-hit” lymphomas (THL). The sponsor claims that between 7% and 10% of former DLBCL cases 
harbour MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements (DHL, THL) and are therefore not considered as 
DLBCL any longer, i.e. they are excluded from the condition. Despite these changes in sub-
classifications, the condition DLBCL is still a suitable orphan condition. 
The approved therapeutic indication “MINJUVI is indicated in combination with lenalidomide followed by 
MINJUVI monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large 
B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who are not eligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT)” falls within 
the scope of the designated orphan condition “Treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma”.  
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP, please 
see EPAR. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
At the time of initial designation and review at initial marketing authorisation, the COMP agreed that 
the condition was chronically debilitating and life-threatening. 
At the time of this review, the sponsor argued that DLBCL remains a chronically debilitating and life-
threatening disease with a median survival of less than one year if left untreated. In Europe, the 5-
year overall survival is estimated between 50% and 60% (Le Guyader-Peydou et al, 2017, Sant et al, 
2014, Székely et al, 2014, Issa et al, 2015) underscoring the life-threatening nature of the disease. 
While around 50% of newly diagnosed patients can be cured with first
line therapy a combination

treatment of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) / R-
CHOP + etoposide (CHOEP) chemotherapy, prognosis remains particularly poor in those patients 
refractory to first-line treatment (about 10-15%), with overall survival (OS) less than 1 year. Poor 
outcomes are also observed among patients who are ineligible for stem cell transplantation  (median 
OS: 6 to 11 months) or have refractory disease after any line of treatment (median OS: 6.1 to 7.1 
months) (Arcari et al 2016; Crump et al 2017; Czuczman et al 2017). 
The clinical course can be debilitating due to constitutional symptoms, local symptoms of 
lymphadenopathy, end-organ damage from disease involvement, and bone marrow failure that may 
lead to infections, anaemia, and thrombocytopenia. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
As the sponsor has not identified any sources where the prevalence is given for DLBCL specifically they 
have estimated the prevalence based on:  
• 
• 
identification of incidence of NHL,  
percentage of DLBCL from NHL,  
•  mean duration of DLBCL and  
• 
validation of the results. 
The percentage of DLBCL varies in the literature with the most recent ESMO guideline indicating 
between 30% and 58% of the NHL series. While most publications report about 30% of all NHL cases 
being DLBCL, Smith et al, 2015 report 47.8% of NHL constituting DLBCL based on data from the 
Hematologic Malignancy Research Network (HMRN) in the UK from 2004 to 2012. To be on the 
conservative side the sponsor uses this figure for the estimate. It was recognised that the figure is on 
the higher side of reported percentages and is rather conservative. With regards to the prevalence, the 
sponsor was asked to further discuss and justify the most suitable proportion of DLBCL in relation to 
NHL and disease duration. In this context it should also be noted that data from the UK should no 
longer be taken into account for the prevalence calculations. 
The most recent registries cited are the Spanish, German and Slovenian, in which the percentage of 
DLBCL range from 28.4-39.7% respectively, although none of these registries is very large. However, 
even if the highest of these figures were used it would still be below 40%. 
The data on incidence for NHL was taken from ECIS 2020 and was concluded to be 0.92 per 10,000 for 
DLBCL in the EU. GLOBOCAN-2018 and RARECARENet gives lower figures, while the crude incidence 
from NORDCAN is approximately 0.89 per 10,000. The incidence reported from literature is also below 
the estimate based on NHL incidence from ECIS.  
The sponsor has not found any indication that the incidence is increasing in the last 20 years, rather a 
stabilisation occurred, and therefore the assumptions made are considered justified. 
The sponsor proposed to use a 5-year duration of the condition for the purpose of the prevalence 
estimate. They justify this based on: 
•  >50% of patients will be cured after R-CHOP treatment. 
•  Although OS for DLBCL patients relapsing after first line treatment continued to improve during the 
15 years following the introduction of rituximab, this improvement has been modest (Epperla et al, 
2019).

• 
• 
The recent approvals of polatuzumab vedotin or CAR T-cell therapies have not had a clinically 
relevant effect on overall survival (according to the clinical trial results, and since little or no post-
approval data is available). 
Patients with complete remission are considered cured after 2 years of diagnosis (Maurer et al, 
2014; Tilly et al, 2015; Crump et al, 2017), positively impacting the 5-year relative survival rate of 
the overall DLBCL population. 
The sponsor originally proposed an estimated prevalence in the EU of 4.6 in 10,000 based on a 5-
year duration and an incidence of 0.92 in 10,000. 
Two sensitivity analysis were also performed: 
In analysis No 1 the sponsor argues that patients cured should not be included in the estimate. As 
DLBCL is not a chronic disease, those persons that are cured because of a successful treatment no 
longer belong to the persons affected by DLBCL and thus no longer count for the prevalence 
calculation. Therefore, it is justified to not count these persons for a 10-year prevalence calculation but 
only the remaining 50% of the population relapsing after R-CHOP treatment. The respective 10-year 
prevalence, assuming an incidence of 0.46 per 10,000 (i.e. 50% of the overall incidence of DLBCL in 
EU-27), is 4.6 per 10,000. 
In analysis No 2 the sponsor uses a lower figure for the percentage of DLBCL of 40% instead of 47.8%. 
This is based on the consistently reported lower figures but also on the deduction of high-grade B 
lymphoma with MYC and/or BCL6 rearrangements, which previously accounted for approximately 8% 
of DLBCL. The estimated prevalence would then be 3.9 in 10,000.  
Although very sparse data on the actual prevalence of DLBCL in the EU is available, the proposed 
figure is supported by what the sponsor has identified. 
Discussion by the sponsor in response to outstanding issues on the prevalence: 
In written responses to a list of questions the sponsor argued that most of the publications report a 
percentage of 30%-40% of all NHL cases representing DLBCL. To more precisely estimate the 
percentage of DLBCL from NHL, the Sponsor used 11 recent sources from 8 European countries. These 
percentages varied between the 17.2 and 43.5%, resulting in a median about 35% of all NHL cases 
being DLBCL. This is in alignment with data reported from the United States with 30% of all NHL cases 
being DLBCL in 2018 (SEER, 2021). The sponsor proposes that, in order not to underestimate the 
prevalence, a proportion of 30-35% could be used. 
With regards to the duration of the disease the sponsor added information from France, Belgium and 
Sweden and the percentage of patients surviving 5 years (Monnereau et al., 2021, Belgian Cancer 
Registry, 2020, Harrysson et al., 2021). An improvement in survival seems to have taken place from 
the 90s but this seems to have stagnated around 2010. This is also reported for the Integral Cancer 
Center Netherlands (IKNL) which described improved survival for all age categories from 1996 up to 
2013, with a plateau observed since then. 
Overall, 5-year survival rates in the EU range from 60-65%, with shorter survival in the elderly 
population. The survival rate is positively impacted by those 50% of patients who respond to first -line 
treatment with R-CHOP and are event-free 24 months after diagnosis, have excellent long-term 
outcomes, and can be considered to be cured. In contrast, the prognosis for patients with 
relapsed/refractory disease continues to be poor, despite the emergence of new therapies. In 
summary, the sponsor concludes that a mean disease duration of 5 years for DLBCL is considered 
justified.

Page 7/16 
 
 
 
 
 
During an oral presentation the sponsor summarised that DLBCL accounts for about 30% of all NHL. 
The disease duration was suggested to be 5 years for the purpose of the prevalence calculation 
considering that 50% of patients are actually cured within two years of onset. In the end a prevalence 
range of 2.9 - 4.6 in 10,000 was given, depending on the percentage used (30-47.5). With the 
uncertainties of both the duration of disease and the percentage of NHL the COMP accepted the 
outcome of the second sensitivity analysis where the sponsor used 40%, 5 year and concluded on a 
prevalence of 3.9 in 10,000. This was rounded up to 4 in 10,000.

The proposed therapeutic indication for Minjuvi is in second line therapy for patients who are not 
eligible for ASCT. 
R-CHOP is standard of care in first line treatment, but not used after progression. For younger, high-
risk patients, R-CHOEP is a valid option. Patients eligible for Minjuvi will have relapsed after R-CHOP 
and therefore the therapeutic indication is not the same. 
The chemotherapeutic agent pixantrone (Pixuvri) is approved for use as monotherapy in adult patients 
with multiple relapsed or refractory aggressive NHL (Pixuvri Summary of Product Characteristics 
[SmPC] 2020), i.e. third-line or later. As Minjuvi can be used earlier than Pixuvri the therapeutic 
indications are not considered to be completely overlapping.  
Two CAR T-cell therapies targeting CD19 (same target as Minjuvi) have been approved: axicabtagene 
ciloleucel/Yescarta® (August 2018); and tisagenlecleucel/Kymriah® (August 2018), respectively, for 
patients with R/R DLBCL who have failed at least two prior lines of systemic therapy. As for Pixuvri, the 
target patient population for the CAR T-cell therapies is later in the treatment armamentarium as 
compared to Minjuvi.  
The only approved product with a completely overlapping therapeutic indication is the CD79b-targeting 
antibody-drug conjugate polatuzumab vedotin (Polivy), which in combination with bendamustine and 
rituximab (BR) (POLA-BR), was granted a conditional marketing authorization (CMA) by the European 
Commission for the treatment of adult R/R DLBCL patients who are not candidates for hematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation in January 2020. Polivy is therefore considered a satisfactory method for the 
target population for Minjuvi and should be considered for the discussion on significant benefit.

Significant benefit 
The sponsor sought protocol assistance for the justification of significant benefit, in particular related to 
indirect comparisons, in June 2019 (EMEA/H/SA/3466/3/2019/PA/II). At the time, the COMP noted 
that it would be challenging to show a significant benefit. 
The sponsor has done a matched adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) vs the polatuzumab vedotin 
regimen, using data from the L-MIND study and GO29365 study, which are the pivotal registration 
studies for tafasitamab and polatuzumab vedotin, respectively. The L-MIND study was an uncontrolled 
single-arm study in 81 R/R DLBCL patients who were not eligible for ASCT, where tafasitamab was 
given add-on to lenalidomide for 12 monthly cycles. Thereafter, patients could continue with 
tafasitamab monotherapy until disease progression. GO29365 was a randomised open-label study, 
where 80 R/R DLBCL patients were randomized 1:1 to receive polatuzumab vedotin plus BR 
(bendamustine-rituximab) or BR alone for six 21-day cycles. A MAIC was considered feasible due to 
similar inclusion and exclusion criteria of the GO29365 study and the L-MIND study. However, 
according to the sponsor, the MAIC remains subject to uncertainty due to some prognostic 
factors/effect modifiers that were not reported at baseline. Overall, the patient population enrolled in 
the polatuzumab vedotin study GO29365 was similar to the L-MIND study (R/R DLBCL, ineligible for 
transplantation or experienced treatment failure with ASCT), although the GO29365 population was 
more heavily pre-treated and included more primary refractory patients. On the other hand, patients 
with transformed lymphomas and peripheral neuropathy > Grade 1 were eligible in the L-MIND study, 
in contrast to GO29365 (Sehn et al, 2020a). Eight patients with a DLBCL that transformed from a prior 
indolent lymphoma were enrolled in the L-MIND study. 
Overall, no statistically significant difference in treatment effect could be established in the comparison 
of tafasitamab + LEN versus polatuzumab vedotin + BR. However, a numerical advantage in favor of 
tafasitamab + LEN was found for duration of response (DoR), OS and progression-free survival (PFS) 
for both analysed populations. The most favorable hazard ration (HR) was observed for the 
tafasitamab + LEN combination in terms of DoR with 0.39 [0.13, 1.12] and a p-value of 0.079 for the 
matched population. The duration of response is especially important for this patient population, which 
is ineligible for potentially curative treatment such as ASCT, and hence has short OS otherwise (Farooq 
et al, 2017). In view of the high chance of relapse in this population, the DoR advantage represented 
for tafasitamab + LEN compared with polatuzumab vedotin + BR in this analysis could be considered 
clinically relevant.  
The sponsor claims a SB based on the following arguments: 
1. 
Tafasitamab is associated with substantially longer durability of responses translating into 
longer overall survival, which is of high clinical relevance for patients, in view of their 
ineligibility for a potentially curative treatment option, such as ASCT.  
2. 
3. 
Tafasitamab + LEN demonstrated clinical benefit in patients with a transformed lymphoma, 
which were excluded from the treatment with polatuzumab vedotin + BR. 
Although not fatal, serious or leading to study withdrawal, peripheral neuropathy was very 
commonly reported for the polatuzumab vedotin + BR combination which is not the case for 
the tafasitamab + LEN combination. In addition, the tafasitamab + LEN combination is 
supposed to be used in a wider population, e.g. while polatuzumab vedotin is contraindicated 
in patients with active severe infection, this is not as strictly the case for tafasitamab + LEN. 
The COMP considerate that in relation to the first claim:

The combination regimes for both products might impact the effect. Polivy is administered together 
with rituximab and bendamustin for a duration of maximum 6 months. The effect of the 
chemotherapy part of the regimen might be the reason for the numerically better figures for ORR 
and CRR. Minjuvi on the other hand is given as a long-term treatment in combination with a 
product with limited information on the response in DLBCL. The fact that Minjuvi is given for a 
longer time might contribute to the numerically improved survival and DOR figures.  
The DOR of >50% at 2 years is considered to be relevant for the target population of patients who 
are at high risk of relapsing.  
In relation to the second claim: 
• 
It is recognised that patients with transformed lymphoma were not included in study GO29365; 
however, while there is evidence to say that de novo DLBCL patients have a better outcome with 
first line treatment (R-CHOP), this is less well established for second line treatment and might not 
necessarily mean that the patient population in L-MIND was more severe.  
Finally, in relation to the third claim, the COMP considered that: 
• 
• 
It is challenging to compare the two products on their own as they are given in as part of the 
combination therapy. 
Treatment related all-grade thrombocytopenia and anemia were substantially lower with 
tafasitamab + LEN (anemia 23.5% vs 46.7%, thrombocytopenia 24.7% vs 46.7%, febrile 
neutropenia 7.4% vs 11.1 %), rates for neutropenia were comparable for tafasitamab + LEN and 
polatuzumab vedotin + BR (48.1% vs 46.7%). Among reported infections, pneumonia was more 
frequently considered related to treatment with polatuzumab vedotin (15.6%) vs tafasitamab 
(7.4%). 
Given the limited experience with Minjuvi thus far, the claim of better safety cannot be concluded on at 
present stage.  
The  COMP  agreed  that  the  two  studies  have  similar  patient  populations  included,  i.e.  first  relapse 
ineligible  to  ASCT,  but  the  report  from  the  sponsor  did  not  provide  much  information  apart  from  the 
results on five endpoints. A detailed description of the model that was used or the covariates that were 
considered would be needed for a complete assessment. It is not clear what has been done to derive the 
Naïve and MAIC-adjusted estimates. The estimates differ substantially (e.g. 0.90 vs. 0.69 for ORR or 
0.57 vs. 0.79 for OS). This is neither explained nor discussed by the sponsor and. a reference could have 
been provided. Finally, an overview of the baseline characteristics is lacking in the submission, and it 
would have been essential to compare the two trials.  
The COMP considered that more details on the MAIC and the indirect comparison to polatuzumab vedotin 
were needed for a final conclusion. 
Discussion by the sponsor in response to outstanding issues on the Significant Benefit 
The MAIC methodology follows the approach introduced by Signorovitch et al.2012, and the UK 
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines.  
In order to achieve the best compromise between increasing the number of covariates, while 
preserving an acceptable sample size, clinical experts advised the sponsor to prioritize matching for 
age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) score, International 
Prognostic Index (IPI) score, refractoriness of patients (primary refractoriness or refractoriness to prior 
lines of therapy), number of prior treatment lines, prior SCT, and cell type of origin of the disease.

However, these turned out to be too many variables and the model did not converge. In the final 
model, cell type of origin of the disease was not included in the adjustment due to the very high 
number of missing values reported in the L-MIND study for this variable. Primary refractoriness was 
also not included. The first MAIC analysis was conducted based on the primary analysis results of study 
L-MIND and is presented in the Orphan drug maintenance report of 19 March 2021. An updated 
analysis, which was performed on the updated efficacy data of October 2020, was provided in the 
answer to the LoQ. The outcome was in line with the first analysis: 
•  Relative estimates for DoR-IRC after matching showed a larger treatment effect of tafasitamab + 
lenalidomide over Pola + BR, acknowledging however, that the sample size was small. 
•  Single hazard ratios estimate for OS and PFS-IRC numerically favoured tafasitamab + lenalidomide 
over Pola + BR, although no statistically significant differences were found, and the upper 95% 
confidence intervals of the medians were not reached. 
•  A numerical advantage favouring Pola + BR over tafasitamab + lenalidomide was found on ORR 
and CRR, although no statistically significant differences were found. 
Indirect comparisons before and after the MAIC are provided in the table below.

To further validate the results of the MAIC analysis, the sponsor presented an additional comparative 
analysis with study RE-MIND2. This comparison was based on real world Pola + BR data collected from 
an observational trial and was done using a different methodological approach, using propensity score 
matching based on patient level data between the two therapies. The results are supportive of the 
MAIC outcome. 
Despite the differences in treatment duration (6 months for polatuzumab and 12 months for 
tafasitamab + lenalidomide, followed by monotherapy), the sponsor considered it possible to compare 
the two treatments, in particular as the endpoints measured were the same and the duration of follow 
up was similar. They also emphasised the possibility to treat patients with tafasitamab (a single 
immunotherapeutic agent without chemotherapy) until progression, which was not evaluated for 
Pola+BR because of its toxicity.

The sponsor also claimed that the vast majority of prior precedents in oncology clearly rely on durable 
responses, establishing the importance of favourable effects on both endpoints, ORR and DoR. The 
significance of ORR is assessed by its magnitude and duration. Based on the MAIC analysis, after 
adjusting for the differences in key prognostic factors, the DoR of patients treated with tafasitamab + 
lenalidomide was longer than for the patients who were treated with polatuzumab vedotin + BR. There 
was a trend towards prolonged PFS and OS, but the presented single HR were not statistically 
significant.  
During the oral explanation some further aspects of the MAIC were clarified. The specific model was 
selected by the sponsor as it had the highest sample size and all models with less than 16 patients 
were rejected. The consistency between the models was considered reassuring, with the obvious 
difference that the confidence interval became wider for the models with lower sample size. With the 
limitations recognised by the sponsor, the COMP accepted the results from the MAIC. 
The possibility of reliably comparing the survival data from the pivotal studies was also discussed. The 
sponsor claimed that, for Polivy, most events had happened at month 20, after which the curve would 
stay the same at best. However, that was not the case for Minjuvi-treated patients. This was 
appreciated by the COMP, however, due to the single arm nature of L-MIND and the small datasets for 
both treatments (tafasitamab and polatuzumab vedotin), the survival data was not considered to be 
supportive for the significant benefit. DoR is not to be considered as a surrogate endpoint for clinically 
relevant and confirmatory endpoints like PFS and OS, and the sponsor concurred that there is no 
literature to support this. The uncontrolled study design of L-MIND did not allow for any conclusions to 
be drawn on whether the continuation of tafasitamab monotherapy had contributed to the prolonged 
DoR.  
Furthermore, it was clarified that tafasitamab was well tolerated in the mono-therapy part of the study 
and that there were lower AEs than in the phase where tafasitamab was given in combination with 
lenalidomide as compared to Pola + BR.  
The sponsor considered that the synergistic effect of lenalidomide and tafasitamab is the reason for 
why this product will work, as opposed to other products. Based on data from a few patients, the 
sponsor also confirmed that CD19 function is preserved after treatment with Minjuvi, which was 
considered important as it would allow for further treatment with CAR T-cell products.  
In conclusion, the COMP acknowledged that there are limited treatment options for patients with 
DLBCL refractory to R-CHOP and considered that the considerable longer duration of response with 
Minjuvi over Polivy could be of clinical relevance and supportive of a significant benefit, in a target 
population with limited treatment options and poor prognosis.

4.  COMP position adopted on 15 July 2021 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product. 
the prevalence of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was 
estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be approximately 4 in 10,000 
persons in the European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to involvement of single or multiple nodal or extranodal 
sites, including the gastrointestinal tract and bone marrow and life-threatening in patients not 
responding to first-line treatment;  
although satisfactory methods for the treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union, the assumption that Minjuvi may be of potential significant benefit to those 
affected by the orphan condition still holds. Patients who relapsed after or were refractory to first 
line treatment and were not eligible for autologous stem cell transplantation, achieved comparable 
response rates and a longer duration with Minjuvi as indirectly compared to the other approved 
product in this setting, Polivy. This was considered clinically relevant given a target population with 
limited treatment options and poor prognosis. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Minjuvi, Humanised Fc 
engineered monoclonal antibody against CD19, tafasitamab for treatment of diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma (EU/3/14/1424) is not removed from the Community Register of Orphan Medicinal 
Products.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This application for marketing authorisation is made under article 10(1) generic application of Directive 
2001/83/EC as amended. The application refers to the original medicinal product Invanz 1 g powder for 
concentrate for solution for infusion, marketed by Meck Sharp & Dohme Limited granted via centralised 
procedure on 18 of April 2002 to Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited.  
Ertapenem inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis following attachment to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). Like 
other beta-lactam agents, the mechanism of action of ertapenem involves decreased synthesis of 
peptidoglycan by inhibition of specific PBP. In Escherichia coli, affinity is strongest to PBPs 2 and 3.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction  
The finished product is presented as powder for concentrate for solution for infusion containing 1.0 g 
ertapenem as active substance.  
Other ingredients are sodium hydrogen carbonate (E500), and sodium hydroxide (E524) to adjust pH to 7.5. 
The product is available in Type I clear glass vials with a 20 mm grey chlorobutyl rubber stopper and a tear 
off seal with polypropylene disk as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of the active substance is [4R-[3(3S*,5S*),4α,5β,6β(R*)]]-3-[[5-[[(3-
carboxyphenyl)amino]carbonyl]-3-pyrrolidinyl]thio]-6-(1-hydroxyethyl)-4-methyl-7-oxo-1-azabicyclo[3.2.0]-
hept-2-ene-2-carboxylic acid monosodium salt corresponding to the molecular formula C22H24N3O7SNa. It has 
a relative molecular mass of 497.5 and the following structure: 
Figure 1: Active substance structure 
The chemical structure of the active substance was elucidated by a combination of infrared (IR) and 
ultraviolet (UV) absorption, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, mass spectrum (MS). The solid-state properties of the active 
substance were measured by XRD. 
The active substance is a hygroscopic white to pale yellow powder, freely soluble in water and practically 
insoluble in ethanol.  
The active substance is an optically active molecule having 6 chiral centres. Adequate controls are available 
in specifications of the intermediate and the starting material to justify control of stereo-chemistry of these 
moieties.  
Assessment report

Polymorphism is not relevant as the medicinal product is used for injectables. Representative X-ray 
diffraction pattern for three batches of the active is provided. The data presented indicates consistency in 
polymorphic form. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is manufactured by one manufacturing site. Detailed information on the manufacturing 
of the active substance has been provided and was considered satisfactory. 
During evaluation, the CHMP requested a major objection (MO) on redefinition of one of the initially proposed 
starting materials, redefinition was performance by the applicant and it was considered satisfactory. The 
process is described overall in four synthetic steps and a final purification step. The starting materials are 
well with acceptable specifications.  
Critical steps of the synthesis have been clearly stated. Adequate in-process controls are applied during the 
synthesis. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents 
have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. During 
evaluation, the CHMP raised a MO requesting grouped limit for all intermediates containing one of the 
identified genotoxic impurities to introduce to the specification of the active substance. The applicant agreed 
to update the active substance specification in this respect and this was considered acceptable, 
The  active  substance  is  packaged  in  a  triple  polybag  ((LDPE  (inner  bag),  polyester/LDPE  (middle  bag),  and 
polyester/aluminium/polyester/LPDE (outer bag))and which is placed in a HDPE drum/container which complies 
with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for description (visual), solubility (visual), identification (IR, 
HPLC, test for sodium), assay (HPLC), water (KF), pH (Ph. Eur.), bacterial endotoxins (gel clot), assay 
(HPLC), related substances (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), microbial limits (Ph. Eur), palladium content (ICP-
MS), rhodium content (ICP-MS), specific optical rotation (polarimeter), and p-Toluidine (LC/MS/MS).  
Limits proposed for related substances are in-line with ICH Q3A and are also based on observed batch 
analysis data. The level of the dimeric impurities are also in compliance with respective data from the 
reference medicinal product. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data (5 commercial scale batches) of the active substance are provided. The results are within 
the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Assessment report  
Page 9/20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Stability 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in 
the intended commercial package for up to 18 months under long term conditions (-20 ± 5°C) according to 
the ICH guidelines were provided.  
The following parameters were tested: description, water, pH, assay, related substances, bacterial 
endotoxins, and microbial limit test. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were 
stability indicating. Ertapenem sodium showed no significant change in any of the test parameters. All the 
results meet in-house requirements for ertapenem sodium indicating that it is a stable product. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. The data indicated that 
there was a change in  description. However a significant change was observed in the assay and related 
substance, hence it is recommended to store the sample in well closed container at -20 ± 5°C. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 18 months when stored in well closed 
container at -20 ± 5°C in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is lyophilised powder for solution for infusion with the following description:  
Dry powder – Off white to pale yellow coloured powder/cake. 
After reconstitution – Colourless to yellow coloured solution. 
The aim was to develop a stable, robust, generic injectable dosage form which is pharmaceutically equivalent 
to the reference product Invanz 1 g powder for concentrate for solution for infusion. 
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the finished product However, no design 
spaces were claimed. 
The quality target product profile (QTPP) was defined on the basis of the active substance properties, the 
characterisation of the reference product, taking into account the reference product label and the intended 
patient population.  
The physicochemical characteristics of the active substance have been taken into consideration when 
developing the finished product. The final formulation of the finished product is an amorphous lyophilizate. 
During reconstitution it is dissolved in water or saline, therefore no concern is raised regarding the 
polymorphic form. To evaluate the impact the active substance residual solvents on the related substance of 
finished product, two batches were manufactured with different levels of residual solvents and charged on 
stability.  The  stability data showed that residual solvent of the active substance, resulted in similar impurity 
profile of finished product at initial and stability. Since the excipients are qualitatively and quantitatively the 
same no compatibility study between the active substance and the excipients was required. 
All excipients are well-known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. The qualitative and quantitative composition of excipients is same as that of the reference 
Assessment report  
Page 10/20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reference product. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of 
excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The strategy to achieve essential similarity to the reference medicinal product and to obtain a product with 
similar in-vivo performance to the innovator product, was to develop a stable formulation of ertapenem 1 g 
powder for concentrate for solution for infusion. 
The proposed finished generic medicinal product is administered as an aqueous solution for intravenous use 
containing the same active substance in the same concentration as the currently authorised reference 
product.  
There is no difference between the proposed commercial formulation for marketing and the development 
formulation. The essential similarity of the generic medicinal product formulation with the reference medicinal 
product formulation was demonstrated by comparison of the composition and impurity profiles. 
In the reference medicinal product information it is stated that Ertapenem for Injection must be reconstituted 
and then diluted prior to administration of the IV infusion. The reconstituted solution, immediately diluted in 
0.9% sodium chloride Injection may be stored at room temperature and used within 6 hours or stored for 24 
hours under refrigeration (2-8°C) and used within 4 hours after removal from refrigeration. Solutions of 
Ertapenem for Injection should not be frozen. 
Based on above information, diluents compatibility study was conducted with 10 mL water for injection and 
0.9% sodium chloride followed by dilution with 50 ml of 0.9 % Sodium Chloride injection (Final solution conc. 
– 16.67 mg/mL) respectively, on generic medicinal product development batches and demonstrated that the 
diluents compatibility was satisfactory. 
The primary packaging is Type I clear glass vials with a 20 mm grey chlorobutyl rubber stopper and a tear off 
seal with polypropylene disk. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the 
container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the 
product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured by one manufacturing site. The manufacturing process consists of 3 
main steps: compounding, aseptic filtration and filling followed by lyophilisation The process is considered to 
be a non-standard manufacturing process as it is an aseptic manufacturing process. 
The critical steps of the process and the in-process controls were presented, justified and they are considered 
acceptable.  
The aseptic manufacturing process was validated on three commercial scale finished product batches. Major 
steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been demonstrated 
that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a 
reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process. 
Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf life specifications shown include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form: description (visual), identification (HPLC, HPLC-PDA), water (KF), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), 
Assessment report  
Page 11/20 
 
 
 
 
 
residual solvents (GC), sodium content (atomic absorption spectrophotometer), pH (Ph. Eur.), completeness 
and clarity of solution (visual), particulate matter (visual), reconstitution time (in min), colour absorbance (UV- 
visible  spectrophotometer),  particulate  matter  (Ph.  Eur.),  related  substance  (HPLC),  assay  (HPLC),  bacteria 
endotoxins  (Ph. Eur.), sterility (Ph. Eur.), colour  solution (Ph. Eur.) and clarity of solution (Ph. Eur.)  
The justification, and the acceptance limits of the description, identification, water, uniformity of dosage 
units, residual solvents, sodium content, pH, constituted solution characteristics (completeness and clarity of 
solution, particulate matter and reconstitution time, colour absorbance and particulate matter), assay, 
bacterial endotoxins, sterility, clarity of solution and colour of solution tests are considered acceptable. The 
calculation of the bacterial endotoxins limit is correct, and it is considered acceptable. 
The limits for the unspecified impurities are in-line with ICH Q3B, taking into account the maximum daily 
dose of Ertapenem and acceptable. The acceptance limits of the specified impurities were established on the 
basis of batch analysis data, stability data and comparative impurity data between the test and the reference 
product, batch analysis and stability results. The levels found in the EU reference product can be used to 
establish limits “qualified by use”. The proposed limits for the specified impurities are acceptable.  
Based on ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities, a risk assessment was performed using Option 2b to 
determine the probability of inclusion of elemental impurities in the finished product to establish the 
appropriate controls to ensure the quality of the finished product. The assessment examined the sources of 
elemental impurities and  identified several components that had the potential to transfer elemental 
impurities into the finished product. In the active substance Palladium (Pd) value is higher than 30 % PDE 
but controlled in the active substance specification with a specification limit of NMT 7.5 ppm. Thus, it remains 
at levels below the PDE. Overall the Risk assessment confirms that levels of elemental impurities in 
Ertapenem for Injection 1g/vial are adequately controlled and no additional controls are required. 
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has 
been performed (as requested as Major Objection) considering all suspected and actual root causes in line 
with the “Questions and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the 
Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the 
information provided, it is accepted that there is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or 
the related finished product. Therefore, no specific control measures are deemed necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for testing has been 
presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 3 commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of finished product stored for up to 18 months under long 
term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. In addition to this, stability data has been generated at 
Assessment report  
Page 12/20 
 
 
 
 
intermediate stability condition (30°C ± 2°C / 75% ± 5% RH) for 12 months as significant changes were 
observed under accelerated stability condition. The batches of the medicinal product are identical 
representative to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for 
marketing.  
Samples were tested for tests for description, water, pH, constituted solution (completeness and clarity of 
solution and particulate matter), reconstituted time, colour absorbance, related substances and assay. The 
analytical procedures used are stability indicating.  
All the parameters are complying to the updated shelf-life specification for the proposed pack till 18 months 
at long term condition and 12 month at intermediate stability conditions. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New 
Drug Substances and Products. There was no significant change in all tested parameters and data was found 
within specifications limits after exposure to light. Thus, it can be concluded that finished product is 
photostable. 
In addition to the studies conducted during development, the diluent compatibility and primary reconstitution 
solution studies were performed on reference medicinal product samples and all three exhibit batches at the 
finished product with diluents recommended in the reference medicinal product information. Details on 
preparation and reconstitution prior to administration of the finished product is stated in section 6.6 of the 
Summary of product characteristics (SmPC). 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months without storage conditions as stated in 
the SmPC (section 6.3 and 6.4) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
 No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. Three issues were raised by CHMP as Major Objections (MO) related to 
redefinition of starting material, control of genotoxic impurities in the active substance and  nitrosamine risk 
assessment. The issue was resolved satisfactorily by the applicant. 
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use.  
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance and/or finished product 
and their manufacturing process. However, no design spaces were claimed for the manufacturing process of 
the active substance, nor for the finished product.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is 
based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to 
generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No environmental risk assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the introduction of 
Ertapenem SUN manufactured by Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Europe B.V. is considered unlikely to result 
in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all ertapenem containing products and the 
exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical overview on the pre-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology is adequate. 
The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile 
has been discussed and was considered acceptable. The Overview based on literature review is appropriate. 
Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of ertapenem are well known. As ertapenem 
is a widely used, well-known active substance, the applicant has not provided additional studies.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical aspects are considered adequate to support this application. There are no objections to the 
approval of Ertapenem SUN from a non-clinical point of view.

This is an application for a powder for concentrate for solution for infusion containing ertapenem.  
The reference product is Invanz, 1 g powder for concentrate for solution for infusion, by Merck Sharp & 
Dohme B.V., a centralised product (EMEA/H/C/389). 
No formal scientific advice by the CHMP was given for this medicinal product. For the clinical assessment 
Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 (Rev.1) in its current version is of 
particular relevance. 
Exemption 
No bioequivalence study was submitted to support the application. According to Appendix II of the Guideline 
on the investigation of bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98), bioequivalence studies are generally not 
required if the test product is to be administered as an aqueous intravenous solution containing the same 
active substance as the currently approved reference product. This is the case for Ertapenem SUN. 
Furthermore, the product applied for and the reference product contain the same excipients. A 
bioequivalence study was thus not required. 
Ertapenem SUN, is considered essentially similar to Invanz by Merck Sharp & Dohme B.V.

This application concerns a generic version of ertapenem powder for concentrate for solution for infusion. The 
reference product Invenz is indicated for: 
Treatment  
INVANZ is indicated in paediatric patients (3 months to 17 years of age) and in adults for the treatment of 
the following infections when caused by bacteria known or very likely to be susceptible to ertapenem and 
when parenteral therapy is required:  
• Intra-abdominal infections  
• Community acquired pneumonia  
• Acute gynaecological infections  
• Diabetic foot infections of the skin and soft tissue 
Prevention  
INVANZ is indicated in adults for the prophylaxis of surgical site infection following elective colorectal surgery. 
No non-clinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available 
nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical 
perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as 
well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance. The applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical 
aspects based on information from published literature was considered sufficient. 
Ertapenem SUN is considered essentially similar to the reference product.  
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded.

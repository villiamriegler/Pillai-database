Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for Xenical, the scientific conclusions 
of PRAC are as follows:  
In view of available data regarding orlistat, the PRAC considered that changes to the product 
information were warranted (see below).  
Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC to provide clearer information regarding renal toxicity and in section 
4.8 to provide updated clarification on renal and hepatic toxicities 
Update  of  section  4.5  of  the  SmPC  to  add  information  regarding  interactions  with  antidepressant, 
antipsychotics and Lithium.  
The Package leaflet is also updated accordingly.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Xenical the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance orlistat is favourable subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

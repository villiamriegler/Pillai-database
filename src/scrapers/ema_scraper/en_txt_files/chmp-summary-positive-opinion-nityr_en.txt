Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Nityr 
nitisinone 
On 31 May 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Nityr, 
intended for treatment of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT-1). The applicant for this medicinal product is 
Cycle Pharmaceuticals Ltd. 
Nityr will be available as 10 mg tablets. The active substance of Nityr is nitisinone, an inhibitor of 4-
hydroxyphenyl-pyruvate dioxygenase (HDDP), an enzyme involved in tyrosine degradation (ATC code: 
A16AX04). By inhibiting the normal catabolism of tyrosine in patients with HT-1, nitisinone prevents the 
accumulation of maleylacetoacetate and fumarylacetoacetate, which are converted into toxic metabolites. 
Nityr is a generic of Orfadin, which has been authorised in the EU since 21 February 2005. Studies have 
demonstrated the satisfactory quality of Nityr, and its bioequivalence to the reference product Orfadin. A 
question and answer document on generic medicines can be found here. 
The full indication is:  
"Treatment of adult and paediatric patients with confirmed diagnosis of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 
(HT-1) in combination with dietary restriction of tyrosine and phenylalanine." 
It is proposed that Nityr be prescribed by physicians experienced in the treatment of HT-1. 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and 
made available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been 
granted by the European Commission.

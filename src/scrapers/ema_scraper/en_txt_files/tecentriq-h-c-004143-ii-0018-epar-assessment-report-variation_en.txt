2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death worldwide.  NSCLC is the predominant subtype, 
accounting for approximately 85% of all cases (Molina et al. 2008; Howlader et al. 2014). Small cell lung 
cancer accounts for approximately 15% of all cases, and is distinguished from NSCLC by its rapid growth, 
early development of metastatic disease, and initial responsiveness to platinum-based doublet 
chemotherapy (Govindan et al. 2006). 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
SCLC is characterised by uniform round to spindled-shaped small cells, sparse cytoplasm, high mitotic 
index, necrotic areas (ESMO, 2013). 
 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
SCLC is characterised by a rapid doubling time, high growth fraction, and early development of 
widespread metastases. The majority of the patients with SCLC present with hematogenous metastases. 
One third of the patients present with limited disease confined to the chest (NCCN, 2019).  
The Veterans Administration Lung Group (VALG) proposed a clinical two-stage system for SCLC that 
distinguishes limited stage and extensive stage. Limited-stage is defined as being limited to one 
hemithorax, including mediastinal, contralateral hilar and ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph nodes, 
whereas extensive-stage represents tumour spread beyond these regions (Zelen 1973). Poor prognostic 
factors for survival in patients with SCLC include extensive-stage (ES) disease, poor ECOG PS, weight 
loss, and markers associated with excessive bulk of disease (e.g., elevated lactate dehydrogenase) (Yip 
et al. 2000; Foster et al. 2009). 
2.1.5.  Management 
Patients with limited-stage SCLC can be treated with chemotherapy and radiation with the potential for 
long-term survival (Stinchcombe et al. 2010).  However, the majority (approximately 70%) of patients 
with SCLC are diagnosed with ES-SCLC, which has poor survival prospects: the median OS is 
approximately 10 months with a 1-year OS rate of approximately 40% (Socinski et al. 2009). 
Chemotherapy alone can palliate symptoms and prolong survival for patients with ES-SCLC; however, 
long-term survival is rare (Johnson et al. 2004; DeMets et al. 2010). 
The current standard first-line treatment for patients with ES-SCLC is platinum-based chemotherapy with 
etoposide, a topoisomerase II inhibitor (NCCN 2018, Fruh et al. 2013). The combination of cisplatin or 
carboplatin with etoposide has shown response rates ranging from 60% to 70% in patients with ES-SCLC 
(Rossi et al. 2012).  Several studies using cisplatin or carboplatin with etoposide (at various doses) have 
shown consistent outcomes, suggesting their efficacy is equivalent in patients with ES-SCLC. A 
meta-analysis of four randomized studies compared cisplatin-based versus carboplatin based regimens in 
patients with SCLC (Rossi et al. 2012).  Of the 663 patients included in this meta-analysis, 68% had 
extensive-stage disease. In patients receiving cisplatin- versus carboplatin-containing regimens, there 
was no significant difference observed in response rate (67% vs. 66%), PFS (median: 5.5 vs. 5.3 months; 
hazard ratio [HR]: 1.10; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.94, 1.29) or OS (median: 9.6 vs. 9.4 months; 
HR: 1.08; 95% CI: 0.92, 1.27), suggesting equivalent efficacy in patients with ES-SCLC. Carboplatin is 
frequently substituted for cisplatin in clinical practice as it reduces the risk of emesis, neuropathy, 
nephropathy and fluid overload from cisplatin intravenous (IV) hydration protocols that patients may not 
tolerate. Etoposide in combination with cisplatin or carboplatin is nationally authorised for the treatment 
of SCLC 
Despite the impressive response rates observed with first-line chemotherapy regimens, most patients 
with ES SCLC develop chemotherapy resistant disease and their prognosis is poor. Therefore, there is 
need for improved treatment options for patients with ES-SCLC (Chute et al 1999).  
About the product 
Atezolizumab  is  an  Fc-engineered  humanized  immunoglobulin  (IgG1)  monoclonal  antibody  (MAb) 
targeting  the  programmed  death-ligand  1  (PD-L1).  Binding  of  atezolizumab  to  PD-L1  inhibits  the 
interaction of the PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. Both of these interactions are reported to provide inhibitory 
signals to T cells. 
Tecentriq is currently authorised as 840 mg concentrate for solution for infusion (positive opinion adopted 
by CHMP but pending EC decision at the time of adoption of this procedure) and 1,200 mg concentrate for 
solution for infusion. 
Tecentriq is currently authorised in the following indications: 
-  Tecentriq  as  monotherapy  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  locally  advanced  or 
metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC): 
• 
• 
after prior platinum-containing chemotherapy, or 
who are considered cisplatin ineligible, and whose tumours have a PD-L1 expression ≥ 5%. 
- Tecentriq, in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin, is indicated for the first-line 
treatment  of  adult  patients  with  metastatic  non-squamous  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC).  In 
patients  with  EGFR  mutant  or  ALK-positive  NSCLC,  Tecentriq,  in  combination  with  bevacizumab, 
paclitaxel and carboplatin, is indicated only after failure of appropriate targeted therapies . 
-  Tecentriq  as  monotherapy  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  locally  advanced  or 
metastatic NSCLC after prior chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR mutant or ALK-positive NSCLC should 
also have received targeted therapies before receiving Tecentriq. 
-  Tecentriq  in  combination  with  nab-paclitaxel  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with 
unresectable locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) whose tumours have 
PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% and who have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease.  
The current application is submitted to extend the authorised indication to the use of atezolizumab in 
combination  with  carboplatin  and  etoposide  for  the  treatment  of  ES-SCLC  in  patients  who  have  not 
received previous systemic therapy. The evidence comes from pivotal study IMpower133, a phase III, 
multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. 
The following new indication is recommended by the CHMP: 
Tecentriq, in combination with carboplatin and etoposide, is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult 
patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC).  
During the induction phase, the recommended dose of Tecentriq is 1,200 mg administered by intravenous 
infusion  followed  by  carboplatin,  and  then  etoposide  administered  by  intravenous  infusion  on  day  1. 
Etoposide is also administered by intravenous infusion on days 2 and 3. This regimen is administered 
every three weeks for four cycles. 
The  induction  phase  is  followed  by  a  maintenance  phase  without  chemotherapy  in  which  1,200  mg 
Tecentriq is administered by intravenous infusion every three weeks. 
It is recommended that patients are treated with Tecentriq until disease progression or unmanageable 
toxicity. Treatment beyond disease progression may be considered at the discretion of the physician (see 
section 4.2 of the SmPC). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Atezolizumab is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody produced by recombinant DNA technology, a protein with 
a molecular mass of ~150 kDa. As an unaltered protein, being extensively degraded in the patient’s body 
by  regular  proteolytic  mechanisms  before  excretion,  atezolizumab  is  unlikely  to  result  in  a  significant 
environmental exposure. Atezolizumab is expected to biodegrade in the environment and does not pose 
a  significant  risk  to  the  environment.  Thus,  according  to  the  “Guideline  on  the  Environmental  Risk 
Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), atezolizumab is exempt 
from the submission of Environmental Risk Assessment studies as the product and excipients do not pose 
a significant risk to the environment. 
2.2.2.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
No new nonclinical data has been provided to support this application. The applicant did not submit 
studies for the ERA. According to the relevant guideline, in the case of products containing proteins as 
active pharmaceutical ingredient(s), this is acceptable. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Tabular overview of clinical studies  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  PK  of  atezolizumab  in  ES-SCLC  was  characterized  based  on  data  from  the  Phase  I/III  study, 
IMpower133. 
 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
The  descriptive  statistics  of  the  available  Cmax  (30  minutes  following  the  end  of  the  atezolizumab 
infusion) and Cmin (pre-dose) serum concentrations of atezolizumab for the Atezo + CE arm following 
1200 mg q3w IV administration are summarized in the table below. A total of 195 patients had evaluable 
atezolizumab PK. Mean serum atezolizumab concentrations over time are shown in Figure 1. Steady-state 
was reached by approximately Cycle 3 based on evaluation of trough concentration (Cmin).

Figure 1: Mean (±SD) Plot of Atezolizumab Serum Concentrations versus Time Following Multiple IV 
Doses of Atezolizumab 1200 mg, Administered Every 3 Weeks in Combination with Carboplatin and 
Etoposide  
Carboplatin Pharmacokinetics 
A total of 30 patients had evaluable carboplatin PK (16 patients from the Atezo + CE arm and 14 patients 
from the PBO + CE arm). The mean plasma carboplatin concentrations over time are presented in Figure 
2, and show that the concentration-time profiles of carboplatin are similar between treatment arms.

of Carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL*min, Administered Every 3 Weeks in Combination with Etoposide, with or 
without Atezolizumab 
Etoposide Pharmacokinetics  
A total of 30 patients had evaluable etoposide PK (16 patients from the Atezo + CE arm and 14 patients 
from the PBO + CE arm). The mean plasma etoposide concentrations over time are presented in Figure 3, 
and show that the concentration-time profiles of etoposide are similar between treatment arms. The data 
suggest administration of carboplatin and atezolizumab in combination with etoposide do not impact the 
PK of etoposide.  
Figure 3: Mean (±SD) Plot of Etoposide Plasma Concentrations versus Time Following Multiple IV Doses 
of Etoposide 100 mg/m2, Administered on Days 1, 2, and 3 of Every 3 Week Cycle in Combination with 
Carboplatin, with or without Atezolizumab 
Pharmacokinetics by Treatment-Emergent ADA Status 
Atezolizumab concentrations up to Cycle 7 Day 21 (or pre-dose Cycle 8) by treatment-emergent ADA 
status are summarized in Table 2 for all atezolizumab patients who were both PK and ADA-evaluable. The 
 
 
geometric mean Cmin estimates for Cycle 7 Day 21 (or pre-dose Cycle 8) in the Atezo + CE arm were 135 
μg/mL and 179 μg/mL for ADA-positive and ADA-negative patients, respectively. 
Mean  serum  atezolizumab  concentrations  over  time  by  ADA  status  are  shown  in  Table  2.  Average 
atezolizumab  Cmin  for  both  ADA-positive  and  ADA-negative  patients  approached  a  plateau  (or 
steady-state) between 4–8 cycles of dosing.

Population PK analysis 
The  Phase  I  popPK  Model  was  subjected  to  an  external  validation  for  mUC,  NSCLC,  and  ES-SCLC 
separately,  using  PK  data  collected  in  IMvigor210  and  IMvigor211  for  mUC,  data  collected  in  BIRCH, 
POPLAR, FIR, OAK and IMpower150 for NSCLC and data collected in IMpower133 for ES-SCLC.  
The prediction-corrected visual predictive check suggested that the median, 95th, and 5th percentiles of 
observed  Cmax  and  Cmin  were  generally  within  the  prediction  intervals  of  the  Phase  I  popPK  Model 
(Figure 5). Covariate effects (i.e., BWT, gender, ADA status, albumin levels and tumor burden) in the 
IMpower133 data were generally consistent with those identified in the popPK Model. Both Cycle 1 and 
steady-state  exposure  metrics  were  similar  to  those  estimated  in  other  atezolizumab  monotherapy 
studies.

the Phase I PopPK Model 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  recommended  dose  of  atezolizumab  is  1200  mg  administered  as  an  IV  infusion  q3w.  Study 
IMpower130 evaluated atezolizumab at this dose level and schedule in chemotherapy-naïve patients with 
NSCLC, in combination with carboplatin and nab- paclitaxel.  The rationale for the recommended dose 
was  based  on  data  from  nonclinical  studies  and  available  clinical  data  from  Study  PCD4989g  (see 
European Public Assessment Report for the initial marketing authorisation). In addition, results from the 
studies OAK, BIRCH and POPLAR support the selection of the 1200 mg q3w dose level in patients with 
locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. 
The starting point for the population PK analysis submitted in the current variation application was the 
previous  population  PK  analysis  based  on  dataset  including  subjects  from  phase  I  clinical  studies 
 
PCD4989g  and  JO28944).  This  “Phase  I  popPK  Model”  was  subsequently  subjected  to  an  external 
evaluation with the use of atezolizumab PK data collected in Study IMpower133.  
The  goodness-of-fit  plots  for  population  and  individual  predictions  appeared  adequate.  The  Phase  1 
popPK Model is suitable to describe the individual PK data from the IMpower130 Study and seems suitable 
for determination of atezolizumab exposure metrics. The co-administration of chemotherapy (carboplatin 
+  etoposide)  did  not  seem  to  influence  atezolizumab  PK.  The  data  submitted  also  suggest  that 
administration of etoposide and atezolizumab in combination with carboplatin do not impact the PK of 
carboplatin. 
In general, the observed concentrations in this setting fall within the range of predicted concentrations, at 
least during the first cycle, indicating that the definitive population PK model developed on monotherapy 
data  provides  an  adequate  description  of  the  pharmacokinetics  of  atezolizumab  in  combination  with 
carboplatin  and  etoposide. The  data  available  support  the  use  of  the  same  dose  of  1200  mg q3w  for 
atezolizumab. 
Since  atezolizumab  is  cleared  from  the  circulation  through  catabolism,  no  metabolic  drug-drug 
interactions are expected. Based on PK data from IMpower133, there is no evidence of a PK drug-drug 
interaction with the co-administration of atezolizumab with carboplatin and etoposide. 
While PK and ADA samples had to be collected from patients assigned to the comparator arm to maintain 
the blinding of treatment assignment, PK and ADA assay results for atezolizumab in these patients were 
generally not needed for the safe conduct or proper interpretation of this study. Sponsor personnel 
responsible for performing PK and ADA assays were unblinded to patients’ treatment assignment to 
identify appropriate samples to be analyzed. Samples from patients assigned to the comparator arm were 
not analyzed for atezolizumab concentration except by request (e.g., to evaluate a possible error in 
dosing). Atezolizumab ADA samples collected on Day 1 of Cycle 1 could be analysed for all patients, while 
subsequent samples from patients assigned to the comparator arm were not to be analyzed for ADA 
unless requested. 
The baseline prevalence of atezolizumab ADAs was 2.0% in the atezolizumab - CE arm for 
atezolizumab-treated patients with a baseline ADA sample. The post-baseline treatment-emergent ADA 
incidence was 18.6%. The rates of treatment emerged ADA are considered to be high. Treatment 
emergent ADAs did not appear to have a clinically meaningful impact, the number of ADA positive 
subjects is too small (n=35) to draw firm conclusions.  There was a trend for slightly lower exposure in 
ADA-positive patients; however the Cmin in all ADA-positive patients was in excess of the target serum 
concentration of 6 μg/mL. The MAH is recommended to further investigate the effect of neutralizing 
antibodies on atezolizumab pharmacokinetics and efficacy of atezolizumab (see also clinical efficacy). 
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of atezolizumab has previously been characterized and the PK investigations in 
IMPower133 overall confirm previous findings. The PK of atezolizumab is similar when administered in 
combination with carboplatin and etoposide without evidence of drug-drug interactions, no unexpected 
interactions with covariates have been identified and the proposed dose of 1200 mg q3w seems to be 
appropriate and is endorsed.

IMpower133 (study GO30081): A Phase I/III, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study of carboplatin plus etoposide with or without atezolizumab 
(anti-PD-L1 antibody) in patients with untreated extensive-stage small cell lung 
cancer

disease; SCLC = small cell lung cancer 
Figure 6: Overview of Study Design for IMpower133 
The study included a Phase I safety run-in period in order to establish tolerability of the study treatment. 
After a minimum of 12 patients were enrolled in each treatment arm and received at least two cycles of 
study treatment, unblinded safety data were reviewed by an independent data monitoring committee 
(iDMC). Subsequently, the iDMC reviewed safety data approximately every 6 months during the study.

Treatments 
The induction phase of the study consisted of four cycles of atezolizumab/placebo plus chemotherapy, 
with each cycle being 21 days in duration. On Day 1 of each cycle, study drug infusions were administered 
in the following order: 
Arm A: atezolizumab → carboplatin → etoposide (ATZ + CE) 
Arm B: placebo → carboplatin → etoposide (PBO + CE) 
During the induction phase, study treatment was administered in the following manner: 
•  Day 1: Atezolizumab 1200 mg or placebo administered intravenously over 60 minutes  
•  Day 1: Carboplatin to reach AUC 5 mg/mL/min administered intravenously over 30-60 minutes  
•  Day 1-3: Etoposide 100 mg/m2 administered intravenously over 60 minutes.  
If one component of study treatment was discontinued permanently because of tolerability concerns, the 
patient was allowed to continue with other components of study treatment until disease progression if 
agreed upon by the investigator and patient.   
Following the induction phase, patients continued maintenance therapy with either atezolizumab or 
placebo (21 day-cycles). During the maintenance phase, prophylactic cranial irradiation was permitted 
per local standard-of-care. Thoracic radiation with curative intent or the intent to eliminate residual 
disease was not permitted. Palliative thoracic radiation was allowed. Treatment had to be discontinued in 
all patients (in both treatment arms) who exhibited evidence of disease progression per RECIST v1.1.

Treatment beyond progression: 
Conventional response criteria may not adequately assess the activity of immunotherapeutic agents since 
progressive disease (PD) by initial radiographic evaluation may not necessarily reflect therapeutic failure. 
In order to better accommodate standard clinical practice which is guided by the fact that patients with 
ES-SCLC whose disease progresses after first-line treatment have limited treatment options and such 
options have limited efficacy and significant toxicity, patients could be considered for treatment beyond 
radiographic disease progression per RECIST v1.1, at the discretion of the investigator and after 
appropriate discussion with the patient and obtaining informed consent, only if all of the following criteria 
were met: 
• 
Evidence of clinical benefit as assessed by the investigator 
•  No decline in ECOG PS that could be attributed to disease progression 
•  Absence of tumor progression at critical anatomical sites (e.g., leptomeningeal disease) that 
could not be managed by protocol-allowed medical interventions 
• 
Patients must provide written consent to acknowledge deferring other treatment options in favor 
of continuing study treatment at the time of initial progression 
Patients were fully informed of the risk of continuing study treatment in spite of apparent radiographic 
progression, and consent was documented appropriately before study treatment could continue. 
Investigators made a careful assessment of the potential benefit of continuing study treatment beyond 
radiographic disease progression, considering radiographic data and the clinical status of the patient. 
Patients who continued treatment beyond radiographic disease progression per RECIST v1.1 were closely 
monitored clinically and with a follow-up scan in 6 weeks or sooner if symptomatic deterioration occurred. 
Treatment had to be discontinued if clinical deterioration due to disease progression occurred at any time, 
or if persistent disease growth was confirmed in a follow-up scan. In addition, patients had to be 
discontinued for unacceptable toxicity or for any other signs or symptoms of deterioration attributed to 
disease progression as determined by the investigator after an integrated assessment of radiographic 
data and clinical status. 
Dose modification:  
No dose reductions for atezolizumab/placebo were permitted. Patients could temporarily suspend 
treatment with atezolizumab/placebo for up to 105 days beyond the last dose if they experienced an AE 
that required a dose to be withheld. If atezolizumab/placebo was withheld because of AEs for more than 
105 days beyond the last dose, then the patient was discontinued from atezolizumab/placebo treatment. 
Exceptions required Medical Monitor approval. If a patient had to be tapered off steroids used to treat AEs, 
atezolizumab could be withheld for additional time beyond 105 days from the last dose until steroids were 
discontinued or reduced to prednisone dose (or dose equivalent) ≤ 10 mg/day. The acceptable length of 
interruption depended on agreement between the investigator and the Medical Monitor.  
 
Dose modifications for carboplatin and etoposide were permitted for toxicity according to the prescribing 
information and local standard-of-care. Once reduced, the dose could not be increased back to 100%. 
Treatment with carboplatin or etoposide was recommended to be discontinued if a patient experienced 
any hematologic or non-hematologic Grade 3 or Grade 4 toxicity after two dose reductions or treatment 
was delayed for more than 63 days due to toxicities. 
Tumour assessments: 
Tumour assessments were conducted every 6 weeks for the first 48 weeks following Cycle 1, Day 1 and 
then every 9 weeks thereafter. Patients who met established criteria and who agreed to be treated 
beyond disease progression had tumour assessments conducted every 6 weeks until treatment 
discontinuation.

Outcomes/endpoints 
 
Sample size 
Approximately 400 patients were to be randomized into the global enrollment phase of this study to the 
ATZ+CE arm and the PBO+CE arm in a 1:1 ratio. 
There are two co-primary efficacy endpoints: PFS and OS. To control the overall two-sided Type I error 
rate at 0.05, the two-sided significance levels of 0.005 and 0.045 were allocated to the primary 
comparisons for PFS and OS, respectively.  
The following sample size calculation applies to the global enrollment phase, excluding the China 
extension cohort, unless otherwise noted. 
The sample size of the study is determined by the analysis of OS. To detect an improvement of HR = 0.68 
in OS using a log-rank test, approximately 306 deaths in the ITT population will be required to achieve 
91% power at a two-sided significance level of 0.045. One OS interim analysis will be performed when 
approximately 240 OS events in the ITT population are observed, which by estimation will occur at 
approximately 25 months after the first patient is randomized. The final analysis of OS will be performed 
when approximately 306 OS events in the ITT population have been observed, which is expected at 
approximately 36 months after the first patient is randomized. 
The primary analysis of PFS is planned to be conducted at the time of the OS interim analysis, and is 
estimated to be when approximately 295 PFS events in the ITT population have occurred, which is 
expected at approximately 25 months after the first patient is randomized. This provides 99% power to 
detect an improvement of HR = 0.55 in PFS at a two-sided significance level of 0.005. There will be no 
interim analysis for PFS.  
The calculation of sample size and estimates of the analysis timelines are based on the following 
assumptions: 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
PFS and OS are exponentially distributed. 
The median duration of PFS in the control arm is 6 months. 
The median duration of OS in the control arm is 10 months. 
The interim and final analyses of OS use the Lan-DeMets alpha spending function to approximate the 
O’Brien-Fleming boundary. 
The dropout rate is 5% over 12 months for PFS and OS. 
Table 4: Power and minimum detectable difference for the proposed design of each primary endpoint 
Randomisation 
Eligible patients were stratified by sex (male vs. female), ECOG PS (0 vs. 1), and presence of brain 
metastases (yes vs. no) and randomized 1:1 to receive either ATZ+CE or PBO+CE. Randomization 
occurred in a 1:1 ratio using a permuted-block randomization method. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study. The Sponsor and its agents (with the exception of the IxRS service 
provider [the external independent statistical coordinating center responsible for verifying patient 
randomization and study treatment kit assignments], PK/pharmacodynamic laboratory personnel, and 
the iDMC members); the study site personnel, including the investigator; and the patient were blinded to 
treatment assignment. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis populations: 
• 
• 
ITT population: Defined as all randomized patients, regardless of whether the patient received the 
assigned treatment. ITT patients were analyzed according to the treatment assigned at 
randomization by the IxRS. 
Pharmacokinetic-Evaluable Population: PK analyses were based on PK observations from all patients 
who had received atezolizumab, carboplatin, or etoposide treatment and who provided at least one 
evaluable atezolizumab PK sample. 
•  Safety Population: Included all treated patients, defined as patients who received any amount of any 
component of study treatment. For the safety analyses, patients who received any amount of 
atezolizumab were analyzed as part of the Atezo + CE arm, even if atezolizumab was given in error. 
 
•  ADA-Evaluable Population: ADA analyses were based on ADA observations from patients who had 
received atezolizumab treatment and were evaluated for immunogenicity. 
Efficacy analyses: 
The co-primary efficacy outcome measures for this study are: 
• 
PFS, defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression as 
determined by the investigator using RECIST v1.1 or death from any cause, whichever occurs 
first 
OS, defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause 
The null and alternative hypotheses regarding PFS or OS in the ITT population can be phrased in terms of 
the PFS or OS survival functions SA(t) and SB(t) for Arm A (ATZ+CE) and Arm B (PBO+CE), respectively: 
H0: SA(t) = SB(t) versus H1: SA(t) ≠ SB(t) 
The Kaplan-Meier approach will be used to estimate median PFS for each treatment arm. The 
Brookmeyer-Crowley methodology (Brookmeyer and Crowley 1982) will be used to construct the 95% CI 
for the median PFS for each treatment arm. Cox proportional-hazards models, stratified by sex (male vs. 
female), ECOG performance status (0 vs. 1), and presence of brain metastases (yes vs. no) will be used 
to estimate the HR and its 95% CI. The unstratified HR will also be presented. Treatment comparisons will 
be based on the stratified log-rank test. 
Use of the stratification factors implemented at randomization in the Cox model for OS and PFS: 
The Study GO30081 Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) Version 2 was amended (27 February 2018)due to the 
potential risk of over-stratification (Akazawa et al. 1997). If at least one stratum (i.e., a combination of 
stratification factor levels across sex [male vs female], Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] 
performance status [0 vs 1], and brain metastasis [Yes vs No] per interactive voice/Web response system 
[IxRS]) has less than 10 events (progression-free survival [PFS] or overall survival [OS] events), the 
stratification factor (one of 3 stratification factors: sex, ECOG performance status, and brain metastasis 
per IxRS) which contains the level with the smallest number of patients will be removed from the 
stratified analyses. The removal of the stratification factor will continue until there is no stratum with less 
than 10 events (PFS or OS events). The final set of stratification factors used in stratified analyses will be 
applied to all endpoints where stratified analyses are planned. 
Censoring rules: 
OS: Patients who are alive at the time of the analysis data cutoff will be censored at the last date they 
were known to be alive. Patients with no post-baseline information will be censored at the date of 
randomization plus 1 day.  
PFS: Patients who have not experienced disease progression or death at the time of analysis will be 
censored at the time of the last tumor assessment. Patients without a date of disease progression will be 
analyzed as censored observations on the date of the last tumor assessment. Patients with no 
post-baseline tumor assessment will be censored at the date of randomization plus 1 day. 
Sensitivity analyses: 
OS: 
The impact of non-protocol-specified anti-cancer therapy on OS will be assessed, in which data from 
patients who receive non-protocol-specified anti-cancer therapy before a PFS event will be censored at 
the date before receipt of non-protocol-specified anti-cancer therapy. 
The impact of loss to follow-up on OS will be assessed depending on the number of patients who are lost 
to follow-up. If > 5% of patients are lost to follow-up for OS in either treatment arm, a sensitivity analysis 
will be performed for the comparisons between two treatment arms in which patients who are lost to 
follow-up will be considered as having died at the last date they were known to be alive. 
PFS: 
One sensitivity analysis will be performed to evaluate the potential impact of missing scheduled tumor 
assessments on the primary analysis of PFS, as determined by the investigator using a PFS event 
imputation rule 
1. If a patient misses two or more assessments scheduled immediately prior to the date of the PFS event, 
the patient will be counted as having progressed on the date of the first of these missing assessments. 
2. Patients with a PFS event who missed two or more scheduled assessments immediately prior to the PFS 
event will be censored at the last tumor assessment prior to the missed visits. 
The imputation rule will be applied to patients in both treatment arms. Statistical methodologies that are 
analogous to those used in the primary analysis of PFS will be used for this sensitivity analysis. 
Analyses were also presented to assess the impact of non-prior anti-cancer therapy (NPT) on PFS for 
patient who switched to other treatment before a PFS event. 
Control of the type 1 error due to two co-primary endpoints:  
To adjust for multiplicity due to having two co-primary endpoints, a group sequential Holm’s procedure 
will be implemented: initially the hypothesis test for PFS will be conducted at a two-sided alpha of 0.005 
and OS will be tested at a two-sided alpha of 0.045. Once a null hypothesis is rejected, the test mass 
predefined for that endpoint becomes available and can be recycled to the other unrejected test. 
Table 5: Group sequential Holm procedure 
Interim analyses: 
One interim efficacy analysis of OS is planned for when approximately 240 OS events have been 
observed. The primary analysis of PFS will be conducted at the same time as the interim OS analysis, and 
the exact timing of the analysis depends on when 240 OS events in the ITT population have occurred. 
The final OS analysis will be conducted when approximately 306 OS events in the ITT population have 
been observed. This is expected to occur approximately 36 months after the first patient is randomized, 
but the exact timing of this analysis will depend on the actual number of OS events. 
To control the type I error for OS, the stopping boundaries for OS interim and final analyses are to be 
computed with use of the Lan-DeMets approximation to the O’Brien-Fleming boundary.  
An external independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC) will be set up to evaluate safety data on an 
ongoing basis. All summaries/analyses by treatment arm for the iDMC’s review will be prepared by an 
independent Data Coordinating Center. Members of the iDMC will be external to the Sponsor and will 
follow a charter that outlines their roles and responsibilities. Any outcomes of these safety reviews that 
 
 
affect study conduct will be communicated in a timely manner to the investigators for notification of the 
institutional review boards/ethics committees. A detailed plan will be included in the iDMC Charter. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients who had an objective response by 
the investigator using RECIST v1.1. An estimate of ORR and its 95% CI will be calculated with the Clopper 
Pearson method for each treatment arm. CIs for the difference in ORRs between the two treatment arms 
will be determined with use of the normal approximation to the binomial distribution. Patients without any 
post-baseline assessment will be considered non-responders. 
Confirmation of response according to RECIST v1.1 was not required, but for the exploratory purposes, 
ORR with confirmation was to be reported as needed.  
Duration or Response (DOR) was to be assessed for patients who had an objective response as 
determined by the investigator using RECIST v1.1. Patients whose disease has not progressed and who 
have not died at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of last tumor assessment date. If no 
tumor assessments were performed after the date of the first occurrence of a CR or PR, DOR will be 
censored at the date of the first occurrence of a CR or PR plus 1 day. DOR is based on a non-randomized 
subset of patients (specifically, patients who achieved an objective response); therefore, formal 
hypothesis testing will not be performed for this endpoint. Comparisons between treatment arms will be 
made for descriptive purposes. The methodologies detailed for the PFS analysis was used for the DOR 
analysis. 
Patient-Reported Outcomes. PROs of HRQoL, lung cancer−related symptoms was measured using EORTC 
QLQC30 and EORTC QLQ-LC13. The ITT population was used for TTD analyses and to document 
completion rates. Missing PRO scores were not imputed. Patients whose symptoms have not deteriorated 
before the last PRO a ssessment is completed were to be censored at the date of the last PRO assessment. 
Patients with no baseline assessment or post-baseline assessments were to be censored at the date of 
randomization plus 1 day. 
TTD according to the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-LC13 measures will be evaluated in each of the 
following linearly transformed symptom scores: cough, dyspnea (single item), dyspnea (multi-item 
subscale), chest pain, or arm/shoulder pain. The linear transformation gives each individual symptom 
subscale a possible score of 0 to 100. For the symptom to be considered “deteriorated,” a score 
increase of ≥ 10 points above baseline must be held for at least two consecutive assessments or an initial 
score increase of ≥10 points is followed by death within 3 weeks from the last assessment. A ≥ 10-point 
change in the symptoms subscale score is perceived by patients as clinically significant (Osoba et al. 
1998). The methodologies outlined for the analysis of PFS will be used for the analyses of TTD of the 
pre-specified symptoms of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-LC13 measures. The estimated 
Kaplan-Meier plots will be provided for each symptom separately. 
Subgroup analyses: 
The consistency of PFS and OS results was investigated by estimating the treatment effect in predefined 
subgroups based on key demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity), baseline disease characteristics (ECOG 
PS, smoking status, brain, liver and other metastases at enrollment), and pre-specified TMB biomarker 
expression cutoffs (≥10 or 
<10 and ≥16 or <16).Results 
Participant flow 
Table 6: Patient disposition (screened patients) 
Failed screening: A total of 123 patients failed screening based on information collected in the IxRS 
system. The most common reasons for screen failure were active or untreated CNS metastases (25 
patients), withdrawal by subject (13 patients), and lack of evidence of histologically or cytologically 
confirmed ES-SCLC per the VALG staging system (Inclusion Criterion 4; 10 patients). A listing of all 
patients who failed screening, including the reason for screening failure, was provided in the appendix of 
the CSR. 
No treatment received: Overall, 9 patients did not receive any study treatment (5 patients in the PBO + 
CE arm and 4 patients in the Atezo + CE arm). As of the CCOD of 24 April 2018, all 9 untreated patients 
had discontinued the study due to withdrawal by subject (4 patients), death (4), and physician decision 
(1).  
Patients Unblinded During the Study: At the time of the CCOD, treatment allocation had been unblinded 
for 4 patients for safety reasons (2 patients in each arm) and for 6 patients for other reasons, for example 
to inform subsequent treatment decisions after disease progression (2 patients in the Atezo + CE arm and 
4 patients in the PBO + CE arm). These were individual patient unblindings that occurred at the site level, 
and the Sponsor continued to remain blinded to the treatment assignment. Patients who were unblinded 
were included in the analysis populations.

Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments:  
The original protocol dated 08 December 2015 was amended on four times (v2, 08 June 2016; v3, 25 
August 2016; v4, 29 August 2017; v5, 27 February 2018). Only relevant protocol amendments are 
included in the following section: 
Protocol Amendment 1 (Version 2) – 08 June 2016 
• 
• 
The phase of this study was changed from Phase III to Phase I/III throughout the protocol. 
It was added that in the case of an early termination of the study, patients who were deriving clinical 
benefit from treatment with atezolizumab would be permitted to continue treatment with 
atezolizumab at the discretion of the investigator. 
Protocol Amendment 2 (Version 3) – 25 August 2016 
• 
The phase of the study was changed from Phase III to Phase I/III where applicable throughout. 
•  A secondary efficacy objective and corresponding outcome measure were added to evaluate the 
efficacy of Atezo + CE compared with PBO + CE as measured by investigator-assessed time to 
response (TTR). TTR will be assessed in the ITT population for patients who had an objective response 
as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1. 
•  Clarification was made that during the maintenance phase, prophylactic cranial irradiation was 
permitted as per local standard-of-care and its use was to be reported on the Prophylactic Cranial 
Irradiation eCRF page. 
•  Clarification was made that thoracic radiation with curative intent or the intent to eliminate residual 
disease was not permitted but that palliative thoracic radiation was allowed. 
• 
• 
The criteria for continuing study treatment beyond radiographic disease progression per RECIST v1.1 
was modified to remove the criterion for absence of symptoms and signs including worsening of 
laboratory vitals indicating unequivocal progression of disease. 
It was added that in the case of an early termination of the study, patients who were deriving clinical 
benefit from treatment with atezolizumab would be permitted to continue treatment with 
atezolizumab at the discretion of the investigator. 
•  Clarification was made that cycles in which no chemotherapy was given did not count toward the total 
number of induction chemotherapy cycles. 
• 
The screening assessments were revised, clarifying that either a CT or MRI scan of the pelvis was 
required at screening. 
•  Clarification was made that biomarker blood samples should not be taken during screening. The 
baseline biomarker blood sample should be collected on Cycle 1, Day 1, and the samples should be 
taken prior to administration of any study treatment. 
•  Revision was made to clarify that a pre-treatment tumor tissue sample could be archival or freshly 
obtained and should be submitted before or within 4 weeks after randomization. This specimen was 
expected to be accompanied by the associated pathology report. Additionally, although any available 
tumor tissue sample could be submitted, preferred sample types were included. It was strongly 
encouraged that representative tumor specimens in paraffin blocks (preferred) or 10 (or more) serial, 
freshly cut, unstained slides were submitted for exploratory biomarker analysis, including but not 
limited to PD-L1 status. NGS may be performed by Foundation Medicine on evaluable pre-treatment 
tissue if requested by the investigator. 
•  Clarification was made that pre-treatment tumor tissue samples from patients who were deemed 
ineligible to enroll into the study were returned no later than 6 weeks after eligibility determination. 
• 
Preferred sample types for optional tumor samples after completion of induction treatment were 
added. In addition, language was added to specify that NGS may be performed by Foundation 
Medicine on evaluable tissue if requested by the investigator. 
•  Revision was made to clarify that if clinically feasible, it was recommended that a tumor biopsy be 
performed at the time of radiographic progression, preferably within 40 days of radiographic 
progression or prior to the start of the next anti-cancer treatment, whichever was sooner. Preferred 
sample types were also added. In addition, language was added to specify that NGS could be 
performed by Foundation Medicine on evaluable tissue if requested by the investigator. 
• 
The frequency of the EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-LC13, and EQ-5D-5L questionnaires were 
modified. Patients who discontinued study treatment for any reason other than disease progression 
per RECIST v1.1 (e.g., toxicity) were to complete these questionnaires at each tumor assessment 
visit until disease progression per RECIST v1.1, unless the patient withdrew consent or the Sponsor 
terminated the study, whichever occurred first. 
•  Revision was made to clarify that if, in the opinion of the investigator, a toxicity was considered to be 
due solely to one component of the study treatment and the dose or administration of that component 
was delayed or modified, the dose or administration of the other study treatment components did not 
require modification and could be administered if there was no contraindication. 
• 
The length of time that atezolizumab could be withheld was clarified to be a maximum of 105 days 
beyond the last dose of atezolizumab and that exceptions required Medical Monitor’s approval. 
•  Dose modification guidelines for carboplatin and etoposide were revised for clarity and consistency. 
•  Clarification was made that a hospitalization that was necessary because of patient requirement for 
outpatient care outside of normal outpatient clinic operating hours were not considered to be SAEs, 
but should be reported as AEs. 
• 
The requirement for a tumor response assessment at the treatment discontinuation visit was 
removed. 
Protocol Amendment 3 (Version 4) – 29 August 2017  
•  Modifications were made to the SAP and the timing for the efficacy analyses for PFS and OS in the 
global study. The OS event-patient ratio for the interim OS analysis was increased from 45% to 55%; 
for the final OS analysis, the ratio was reduced from 74% to 70%. Additionally, the second OS interim 
analysis at the time when 258 OS events had occurred was removed. As a result of the changes, 280 
deaths were required for the final OS analysis, estimated to be achieved at approximately first patient 
randomized plus 31 months, compared to 298 OS events with 37 months under a 74% event-patient 
ratio. These changes were implemented to be consistent with other studies in the atezolizumab 
first-line lung cancer program. The multiplicity strategy was adjusted from splitting alpha to a group 
sequential Holm procedure so that alpha spent on PFS could be recycled to OS when PFS was 
significant, and vice versa, to most efficiently use alpha and maximize power.  
The secondary objectives and outcome measures regarding investigator-assessed time in response 
(TIR) and TTR according to RECIST v1.1 were removed to be consistent with other studies in the 
atezolizumab first line lung cancer program.  
The exploratory objectives and outcome measures regarding disease control rate (DCR), TIR, and 
TTR according to modified RECIST v1.1, PFS, OS, ORR, DOR, TIR, TTR, and DCR in the PD-L1 selected 
population, and investigator-assessed DCR according to RECIST v1.1 were removed to be consistent 
with other studies in the atezolizumab first line lung cancer program. 
The definition of the end of the study was updated. The end of study was to occur when all of the 
following criteria had been met: the last patient last visit (LPLV) had occurred (i.e., last patient in the 
global and extended China enrollment phases combined); approximately 280 deaths had been 
observed among the randomized patients in the global enrollment phase; and there were sufficient 
OS events in the ITT population enrolled in the China enrollment phase. 
Language was modified to clarify the process for reporting deaths and for reporting events that 
occurred after the AE reporting period. 
The reporting procedures for death were modified to prohibit use of the term "sudden death" on the 
AE eCRF unless it was combined with the presumed cause of death (e.g., "sudden cardiac death"), as 
use of the term "sudden death" required the Sponsor to query the site for clarification on the cause of 
death. 
The reporting instructions for AEs leading to hospitalization were clarified. 
Language was added to clarify that AE reports were not to be derived from PRO data by the Sponsor 
and sites were not expected to review the PRO data for AEs.  
PFS defined by additional censoring rule for missed visits was changed to a sensitivity analysis to be 
consistent with other studies in the atezolizumab first line lung cancer program. 
The impact of non-protocol-specified anti-cancer therapy on OS was to be assessed as a sensitivity 
analysis by using censoring date cutoff at the date before receipt of non-protocol-specified 
anti-cancer-therapy to be consistent with other studies in the atezolizumab first line lung cancer 
program. 
Language was added to clarify that the Sponsor reviewed all protocol deviations, and prospective 
•

requests to deviate from the protocol were not allowed. 
Protocol Amendment 4 (Version 5) – 27 February 2018 
• 
Protocol GO30081 Version 5 was a country-specific amendment to comply with the Spanish health 
authority's (Agencia Española de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios) requirement to include 
guidelines on the management of atezolizumab-specific AEs, which were also included in the 
Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure, in the protocol.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The MAH has provided data from the final PFS analysis and interim OS analysis (24-APR-2018) and the 
final OS analysis (24-JAN-2019) of IMpower133, a pivotal phase I/III, randomised, double-blind, placebo 
(PBO) controlled study of carboplatin plus etoposide (CE) with or without atezolizumab (ATZ) in patients 
with untreated extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). Co-primary objectives were PFS and OS 
assessed in the ITT population, hypothesis was superiority of ATZ+CE over PBO+CE. 
For sample size calculation, a considerable PFS benefit was assumed (HR of 0.68 and 0.55 for OS and PFS, 
respectively), planning to recruit 400 all-comer patients. Eligible subjects were stratified by sex (male vs. 
female), ECOG PS (0 vs. 1), and presence of brain metastases (yes vs. no) and then randomised 1:1 to 
receive 4 cycles of either ATZ+CE or PBO+CE. After induction, patients continued maintenance therapy 
with ATZ or PBO, respectively. Treatment continued until disease progression per RECIST v1.1, but 
patients could be considered for treatment beyond radiographic disease progression if they had evidence 
of clinical benefit. During the maintenance phase, prophylactic cranial irradiation and palliative thoracic 
radiation was permitted per local standard-of-care. Dose and scheduling of all drugs was based in 
previously approved indications.  
 
 
 
 
 
The main challenges in relation to the design of the study include maintenance (treatment effect cannot 
be differentiated from induction); treatment beyond progressive disease (considering patients on the 
PBO+CE arm would continue on PBO+/-CE); not allowing consolidation thoracic radiotherapy; and not 
considering the choice between cisplatin and carboplatin for the backbone chemotherapy regimen. 
INV-assessed PFS is an acceptable co-primary endpoint because the study is double-blinded and OS was 
the other co-primary objective. The definitions of primary and secondary objectives were also endorsed. 
Out of 526 screened patients, 403 were randomised into both arms of the trial. The distribution of major 
protocol deviations between arms is balanced. The proportion of patients with brain metastases (8%) is 
about half of that in clinical practice (15%), but this was explained as due to the specific inclusion 
requirements for these patients. The proportion of patients in each of the analysis subpopulations is 
acceptable and balanced between arms. 
Overall, the main issue upon the design and conduct of this study is failing to enforce the established 
tissue requirement, leading to retrospective biomarker availability for less than half of the ITT population.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
At first data cutoff on 24 April 2018, 238 death events (59%) and 360 PFS events (89%) had occurred, 
satisfying the predefined data-driven criteria for performing the interim analysis of OS and the final 
analysis of PFS. Median duration of survival follow-up was 13.9 months in the ITT population.  
Both co-primary endpoints of the study had been met. OS data showed significant statistical benefit from 
ATZ+CE (mOS 12.3 months) over PBO+CE (mOS 10.3 months), as indicated by a stratified HR of 0.701 
(95% CI 0.54-0.91, p=0.0069). OS results from PBO+CE are comparable to data from most published 
studies of platinum + etoposide. The MAH has provided results from the exploratory final OS analysis 
after a median follow-up of 22.9 months (data cutoff 24 January 2019, 302 out of 403 OS events = 75%). 
The data seem overall consistent with the first interim analysis. Median OS in both arms is unchanged 
(12.3 months in the ATZ+CE arm and 10.3 months in the PBO+CE arm), although the statistical 
parameters differ slightly: HR 0.76 (95%CI 0.60, 0.95), p-value=0.0154. 
PFS was statistically significant (only) after alpha was recycled from the significant OS analysis 
(“recycling” was introduced with protocol amendment 3). However, the difference in PFS between 
ATZ+CE (mPFS 5.2 months) and PBO+CE (mPFS 4.3 months) is not striking and hence of only marginal 
clinical relevance, observing a stratified HR of 0.772 (95% CI 0.62-0.96, p=0.0170). 
The benefit of adding atezolizumab was not substantially supported by secondary endpoints. Both 
confirmed and unconfirmed ORR were numerically higher in the PBO+CE arm. DoR was similar in both 
arms. PRO data “time to deterioration of lung cancer-related symptoms” did not demonstrate clinically 
meaningful consistent differences. Forest plots on PFS and OS (including bTMB biomarker) did not identify 
any particular –appropriately sized– subgroup with considerably higher or lower benefit from ATZ+CE 
over PBO+CE. The limited number of patients with CNS metastases in the trial limits conclusions 
regarding efficacy of adding ATZ to CE in this subgroup, so a clarification has been inserted in the SmPC. 
The practiced sensitivity analyses do not alter the modest statistical benefit indicated from the primary 
endpoints. 
IHC as a biomarker to select patients who benefit from immunotherapy across cancers is well established. 
PD-L1 IHC (Ventana SP263) results are available for 168 patients (42% from ITT), 93 in the PBO+CE arm 
and 75 in the ATZ+CE arm. PD-L1 positivity, defined as staining of ≥1% of tumour cells, was 55% in the 
PBO+CE arm and 56% in the ATZ+CE arm. In PD-L1 positive patients (n=93), median OS is 10.6 in 
ATZ+CE and 11.1 in PBO+CE. In PD-L1 negative patients (n=75), median OS is 10.5 in ATZ+CE and 8.8 
in PBO+CE. The addition of atezolizumab to CE demonstrated a greater OS benefit in the PD-L1 negative 
subgroups compared to the PD-L1 positive subgroups when regarding the lower PD-L1 cutoff of 1%, 
which lacks any biological rationale. Overall, the provided retrospective OS results are considered 
inconclusive (see Benefit-Risk section). 
95% of the 198 patients who received ATZ were evaluable for anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). Updated 
analyses of OS by treatment-emergent ADA status based on the 24 January 2019 cutoff analyses 
reported an even larger difference for the median OS values between both ADA subgroups (mOS 14.1 
months in ADA- subgroup and 10.9 months in the ADA+ subgroup), but the data are limited due to the 
small sample size of the ADA+ (n=35) subgroup.  
Concerning treatment beyond progression, the benefit of maintaining ATZ is not established: 3 out of 49 
patients who continued atezolizumab beyond progression exhibited a partial response. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
IMpower133 has met both its co-primary endpoints (superior OS and INV-assessed PFS from ATZ+CE vs. 
PBO+CE in ITT), but whether this translates into a compelling clinical benefit to all patients regardless of 
PD-L1 IHC status is unknown. Overall, in patients with ES-SCLC, a net gain of roughly 1 month in median 
PFS and 2 months in median OS must be weighed against the known safety risks from combining 
immunotherapy with chemotherapy. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
As of 17 May 2018, an estimated 16,815 patients have been exposed to atezolizumab either as a single 
agent  or  in  combination  with  chemotherapy,  immunotherapy,  or  targeted  therapy  in  ongoing  clinical 
studies. 
The safety of atezolizumab monotherapy is based on pooled data in 3,178 patients with multiple tumour 
types. The most common adverse reactions were fatigue (35.9%), decreased appetite (25.5%), nausea 
(23.5%), cough (20.8%), dyspnoea (20.5%), pyrexia (20.1%), diarrhoea (19.7%), rash (19.5%), back 
pain (15.3%), vomiting (15.0%), asthenia (14.5%), arthralgia (13.9%), musculoskeletal pain (13.0%), 
pruritus (12.6%) and urinary tract infection (11.6%). 
Safety data for the use of ATZ+CE in patients with chemotherapy-naïve ES-SCLC in the IMpower133 
study are presented versus the standard of care control arm (PBO+CE). Safety analyses included all 
treated patients (defined as all randomized patients who received any amount of any component of study 
treatment) according to actual treatment received: 198 patients treated with ATZ+CE and 196 patients 
treated with PBO+CE. Patients who received any amount of atezolizumab were analyzed as part of the 
ATZ+CE arm even if atezolizumab was given in error. 
In addition, safety data from atezolizumab-treated safety evaluable patients (all patients who received 
any amount of atezolizumab) were pooled and are presented as follows:  
•  Atezolizumab in combination with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy as 1L treatment in lung 
cancer, hereinafter referred to as Atezo + Chemo Combo population. The safety analyses for this 
population are based on safety data from a total of 2421 atezolizumab-treated, safety evaluable 
patients from IMpower133 (n=198 with SCLC), IMpower130 (n=473 with NSCLC), IMpower131 
(n=666 with NSCLC), IMpower132 (n=291 with NSCLC), and IMpower150 (n=793 with NSCLC).  
•  Single-agent atezolizumab regardless of tumor type, hereinafter referred to as Atezo Mono 
population. The safety analyses for this population are based on safety data from a total of 3178 
atezolizumab-treated, safety evaluable patients from OAK (n=609 with NSCLC), POPLAR (n=142 
with NSCLC), BIRCH (n=659 with NSCLC), FIR (n=137 with NSCLC), IMvigor211 (n=459 with UC), 
IMvigor210 (n=429 with UC), IMmotion150 (n=103 with RCC), and PCD4989g (n=89 with NSCLC, 
n=95 with UC, n=17 with SCLC, n=439 with other tumor types).  
The severity of all adverse events (AEs) was graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for AEs, Version 4.0 (NCI-CTCAE v4.0) and reported in detail in the electronic Case 
Report Form (eCRF). Multiple occurrences of the same event in the same patient are counted once at the 
maximum severity (worst grade) in summary tables. 
Verbatim descriptions of AEs were mapped to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
thesaurus terms. MedDRA Version 21.0 was used for the individual study of IMpower133, the pooled 
analysis of Atezo + Chemo Combo studies, and the pooled analysis of Atezo Mono studies.

Hy’s law: Hy’s law cases were defined in the study protocol as elevated ALT or AST ( > 3 x baseline value) 
in combination with either an elevated total bilirubin ( > 2 x ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of 
cholestasis or other causes of hyperbilirubinemia. One patient in the Atezo + CE arm had laboratory 
abnormalities suggestive of a Hy’s law case. This patient developed changes in liver function tests after 1 
cycle of Atezo + CE, which was confounded by his liver metastasis at enrollment. Atezolizumab was 
permanently discontinued and chemotherapy was interrupted, and the patient received treatment with 
 
 
systemic corticosteroids, after which his liver function tests followed a downward trend. No further 
atezolizumab re-challenge was conducted. The positive dechallenge and the laboratory improvement 
after steroid treatment were indicative of an immune-related etiology and not drug induced liver injury. 
This patient had AESI of transaminases increased.

Post marketing experience 
Since the International Birth Date (18 May 2016) through 17 May 2018, an estimated cumulative total of 
20,783 patients have received atezolizumab from marketing experience (United States n=18,470; 
European Union n=987; Japan n=181; Rest of the World n=1,145). No new or unexpected safety findings 
were identified in the post marketing setting for atezolizumab used as a monotherapy. The combination 
regimen of atezolizumab with carboplatin and etoposide administrated in study IMpower133 is not 
approved yet. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Likely reflecting worse prognosis of SCLC as compared to NSCLC, exposure to ATZ in IMpower133 
(median 7 doses) was lower than the other first-line NSCLC studies (median 10 doses). Importantly, 
 
 
exposure to ATZ/PBO and chemotherapy between both arms of the trial was similar, with data that reflect 
completed induction (4 cycles) and started maintenance phase for 81% of the safety population. 
AEs were observed in almost all treated subjects from the trial. The proportion of patients with G3-4 AEs 
was high, although comparable between both arms of treatment (67% ATZ+CE, 64% PBO+CE), as was 
the rate of serious AEs (37% and 35%, respectively). G5 AEs, however, were more common in the 
PBO+CE arm (6% vs. 2%). On the other hand, most patients with AEs that prompted permanent 
treatment withdrawal were in the ATZ+CE arm (22 out of 28).  
The most common AEs of any grade that occurred in the trial were anaemia (39%), neutropenia (36%), 
alopecia (36%), nausea (35%), constipation (28%) and fatigue (26%), corresponding to what is 
expected from carboplatin + etoposide, the backbone of both arms.  
AEs with a considerably higher frequency in the ATZ+CE arm were hypothyroidism (10% vs. 0.5%), 
decreased appetite (27% vs. 18%), anaemia (43% vs. 35%) and nausea (38% vs. 33%). Conversely, 
hypokalaemia occurred more often in the PBO+CE arm (9% vs. 4%).  
Excluding neutropenia, most AEs from the ATZ+CE arm occurred in a similar proportion of patients from 
the lung-pool studies (37% vs. 27%).  
G3-4 events that occurred in the trial were in general related to myelotoxicity and hence most likely 
associated to carboplatin + etoposide. G3-4 gastrointestinal disorders –such as diarrhoea, vomiting and 
nausea– occurred more in ATZ+CE (9% vs. 6% in PBO+CE). The incidence of G3-4 neutropenia was 
comparable in both arms (23% ATZ+CE, 25% PBO+CE), albeit considerably higher than in the lung-pool 
(17%).  
Based on the review of the pooled safety data set for atezolizumab in combination with chemotherapy, 
the following ADRs have been added to the section 4.8 of the SmPC: lymphocyte count decreased, 
headache, vomiting, AST/ALT increased and asthenia. 
The majority of serious AEs were also related to myelotoxicity and were observed in a similar proportion 
of patients from both arms. The proportion of patients with febrile neutropenia was higher in the PBO+CE 
arm (4.6% vs. 2.5%).  
The proportion of patients with AESIs in the ATZ+CE arm was noticeably higher than in the PBO+CE arm 
(40 vs. 25%). Most AESIs were immune-related but only about a quarter of the patients from each arm 
required systemic corticosteroids. Of these, the most frequent was rash, followed by thyroid disorders 
and hepatitis. As compared to the lung-pool, the incidence and severity of AESIs in the ATZ+CE arm was 
slightly lower. 
As expected from chemotherapy-related myelotoxicity, the majority of clinically relevant shifts occurred 
in haematology (CBC) parameters. 
The safety profile from the pooled lung-studies suggests particular sensitivity of elderly and Asian 
patients to treatment with ATZ+chemotherapy. 
As compared to PBO+CE (3%), 11% of patients from the ATZ+CE arm required treatment withdrawal due 
to AEs. The main reasons for permanently discontinuing ATZ in 21 patients from the ATZ+CE arm were 
infusion-related reactions and gastrointestinal disorders. Similarly, the proportion of patients who 
required dose modification/interruption of ATZ/PBO in the ATZ+CE arm was higher than in the PBO+CE 
arm (59% vs. 52%). This difference seems mainly driven by the incidence of leukopenia (6.6% vs. 
1.5%). 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. No changes to the RMP are needed as a result of the new safety data 
submitted as part of the application. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile from carboplatin + etoposide (CE) in both arms of IMpower133 corresponded to 
the known safety profile of the individual study drugs in clinical practice. Adding ATZ to CE slightly 
increases the incidence of G3-4 and serious AEs and led to higher proportions of patients that require dose 
modification/interruption or permanent treatment withdrawal. Nonetheless, the majority of ADRs from 
ATZ were manageable and resolved with treatment. The safety profile of ATZ+CE in the IMpower133 
study was generally consistent with the safety profile of atezolizumab in combination with platinum-based 
chemotherapy in the Atezo + Chemo Combo population (lung-pool studies). No new safety concerns arise 
from the use of ATZ+CE in ES-SCLC patients. 
The current RMP is adequate to manage the risks associated with Tecentriq is this new indication. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle

The risk minimisations measures remain unchanged as a result of this extension of indication. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
The new indication has only been reflected in the SmPC for the 1,200 mg strength, however the safety 
sections have been aligned between the 840 mg and 1,200 mg strengths. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
• No significant changes impacting the readability of the package leaflet are made. The new additions 
follow the same structure and use similar descriptions and terminology as used in the approved package 
leaflet. 
• The target group of users will be similar between the approved indication (locally advanced or 
metastatic NSCLC previously treated with chemotherapy) and the applied indication (first-line treatment 
of adult patients with extensive-stage SCLC), with no significant age difference. 
• Moreover, the posology proposed in this application is the same as for the currently approved indication. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The proposed new therapeutic indication in this procedure is in combination with carboplatin and 
etoposide, for the first-line treatment of adult patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer 
(ES-SCLC). 
SCLC is a deadly tumour accounting for approximately 13-15% of lung cancers and is pathologically, 
molecularly, biologically and clinically very different from other lung cancers (Gazdar et al, Nat Rev 
2017;17:725-37). Most SCLC patients have a history of tobacco use. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
SCLC is usually widely metastatic at diagnosis and initially responds to cytotoxic therapy and 
radiotherapy, but it nearly always rapidly relapses with resistance to further therapies. Despite numerous 
clinical trials, including at least 40 phase 3 trials since the 1970s, systemic treatment for patients with 
SCLC (commonly carboplatin or cisplatin + etoposide) has not changed significantly in the past several 
decades (Früh et al, Ann Onc 2013;24:Supp6). Consequently, the 5-year survival rate remains low (<7% 
overall), and most patients survive for only 1 year or less after diagnosis. Unlike non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC), in which major advances have been made using targeted agents and immunotherapy, 
there are still no approved targeted drugs or immunotherapy for SCLC (Byers and Rudin, Cancer 
2015;121:665-72). However, over the past 5 years, there has been a worldwide resurgence of studies on 
SCLC, including comprehensive molecular analyses, the development of relevant genetically engineered 
mouse models and the establishment of patient-derived xenografts. These studies have led to the 
discovery of new potential therapeutic vulnerabilities for SCLC and therefore to new clinical trials. (Gazdar 
et al, Nat Rev 2017;17:725-37).  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
One pivotal, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized phase I/III study was submitted by the MAH to 
support the first-line indication in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). 
IMpower133 investigated the efficacy and safety of 4 cycles of carboplatin plus etoposide with or without 
atezolizumab (n=403). Following the induction phase, patients continued maintenance therapy with 
either atezolizumab or placebo (no re-randomization). The co-primary efficacy endpoints of the trial were 
INV-assessed PFS and OS in the ITT population. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The study has met its two co-primary efficacy endpoints. At the primary analysis (data cut-off 
24-APR-2018), 59% of OS events had occurred and median follow-up was 13.9 months for all patients. 
First interim OS analysis showed significant statistical benefit from atezolizumab+CE (mOS 12.3 months) 
over PBO+CE (mOS 10.3 months), with a stratified HR of 0.701 (95% CI 0.54-0.91, p=0.0069), for a net 
gain of 2 months of median OS for the ITT.  
Final exploratory OS analysis for the ITT (data cut-off 24-JAN-2019, 302 OS events = 75%) seems overall 
consistent with the first interim OS analysis. Median OS in both arms is unchanged (12.3 months in the 
atezolizumab+CE arm and 10.3 months in the PBO+CE arm), although HR has decreased [HR 0.76 
(95%CI 0.61, 0.96] and the p-value is now 0.0154. 
For the final PFS analysis, 89% INV-declared PFS events are accounted for. PFS from atezolizumab+CE is 
also superior to PBO+CE, but with a meagre difference: median PFS 5.2 vs. 4.3 months and stratified HR 
of 0.772 (95% CI 0.62-0.96, p=0.0170). The net gain of median PFS is 0.9 months. 
Forest plots on PFS and OS (updated) suggest the treatment effect from atezolizumab+CE was consistent 
across the majority of subgroups evaluated. The practiced sensitivity analyses do not alter the statistical 
benefit indicated from the primary endpoints. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
It is not clear whether the treatment effect is related to the use of atezolizumab during the induction or 
the maintenance phase.  
The benefit of treatment with atezolizumab beyond progressive disease is not established and is therefore 
left at the discretion of the physician (see section 4.2 of the SmPC). 
Patients with brain metastases are underrepresented in the pivotal trial (9%, n=35); only subjects with 
pre-treated and asymptomatic brain metastases were allowed for enrolment; data are too limited to draw 
conclusions on this population and this has been reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Updated analyses of OS by treatment-emergent ADA status based on the 24 January 2019 cutoff 
analyses reported a large difference for the median OS values between both ADA subgroups (mOS 14.1 
months in ADA- subgroup and 10.9 months in the ADA+ subgroup), but the data are limited due to the 
small sample size of the ADA+ (n=35) subgroup. However, complete ADA analyses across several 
indications (including SCLC) will be performed by the MAH. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall, atezolizumab in combination with CE is well tolerated. Similar rates of AEs were observed in both 
arms of the trial. The most common AEs of any grade that occurred in the trial were anaemia, 
neutropenia, alopecia, nausea, constipation and fatigue, likely corresponding to the chemotherapy 
backbone. 
AEs with a considerably higher frequency in the atezolizumab+CE arm were hypothyroidism (10% vs. 
0.5%), decreased apetite (27% vs. 18%), anemia (43% vs. 35%) and nausea (38% vs. 33%). 
The proportion of patients with G3-4 AEs was high, although comparable between both arms of treatment 
(67% atezolizumab+CE, 64% PBO+CE), as was the rate of serious AEs (37% and 35%, respectively). 
The majority of G3-4 and serious AEs were related to myelotoxicity from chemotherapy. G5 AEs were 
rare: 11 (5.6%) patients from the PBO+CE arm and 4 (2.0%) from the atezolizumab+CE arm. 
As expected, AESIs occurred more in the atezolizumab+CE arm than in the PBO+CE arm (40% vs. 25%). 
The majority of AESIs were immune-related and the most frequent were rash, thyroid disorders and 
hepatitis. Overall, AESIs were manageable and resolved with treatment. 
The main safety concern from adding atezolizumab to CE derives from the high proportion of patients who 
permanently withdrew from treatment due AEs: 22 (11%) vs. 6 (3%) in the PBO+CE arm.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The need for improving outcomes in ES-SCLC is imperative, but a clinically compelling benefit must be 
proven against potential risks of add-on treatments. In NSCLC, three different immune checkpoint 
inhibitors (nivolumab, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab) were approved as monotherapy in the 
second-line setting before escalating to first-line in combination with backbone chemotherapy 
(pembrolizumab + carboplatin + paclitaxel was approved by CHMP in July 2018). This is not the case with 
SCLC, since immunotherapy in any setting has not demonstrated an advantage that supersedes its 
hazards. 
Although  IMpower133  has  met  both  its  co-primary  endpoints  (superior  OS  and  PFS  from 
atezolizumab+CE vs. PBO+CE in ITT), with a modest net gain of 0.9 months in median PFS (HR=0.77) 
and 2 months in median OS (HR=0.76). Furthermore, this benefit is not firmly supported by surrogate 
endpoints such as ORR and DoR. However, given the high unmet medical need in this population and the 
lack of any survival improvements in the last years, even a small OS advantage could be accepted as 
clinically meaningful in this patient population. 
A retrospective and limited (42% of the ITT) analysis on PD-L1 IHC status and efficacy does not allow for 
reliable conclusions regarding this as a predictive biomarker for response to immunotherapy in ES-SCLC. 
In regards to safety, adding atezolizumab to standard of care platinum + etoposide did not seem to make 
it less tolerable or significantly increase its risks, but there are two issues that cannot be overlooked from 
the atezolizumab+CE arm: a high rate of immune-related adverse events and a considerable proportion 
of patients who withdrew from treatment due AEs. However no new safety signals have been identified 
and given the overall tolerability of the combination therapy, the added toxicity would not outweigh a 
clinical relevant improvement in survival. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Based on the provided data, the B/R balance is positive. 
 
 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
PD-L1 IHC (Ventana SP263) results are available for 168 patients (42% from ITT), 93 in the PBO+CE arm 
and 75 in the atezolizumab+CE arm. PD-L1 positivity, defined as staining of ≥1% of tumour cells, was 
55% in the PBO+CE arm and 56% in the atezolizumab+CE arm. In PD-L1 positive patients (n=93), 
median OS is 10.6 in atezolizumab+CE and 11.1 in PBO+CE. In PD-L1 negative patients (n=75), median 
OS is 10.5 in atezolizumab+CE and 8.8 in PBO+CE. No reliable conclusions regarding the relationship 
between PD-L1 IHC status and efficacy can be drawn.  
The actual PFS difference was considerably smaller than the expected one. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of atezolizumab in combination with carboplatin + etoposide is positive as first line 
treatment for all-comer patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.

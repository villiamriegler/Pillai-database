2.  Scientific discussion 
Problem statement 
This application concerns a centralised procedure for marketing authorisation of MVASI (ABP 215) 
bevacizumab concentrate for solution for intravenous infusion of 25 mg/mL, as a biosimilar product to the 
European reference product product Avastin (EU/1/04/300/001-002). 
Bevacizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) subclass.  
About the product 
ABP 215 is a recombinant IgG1 humanised monoclonal antibody produced from Chinese hamster ovary cells. 
The monoclonal antibody contains murine heavy and light chain complementarity determining region 
sequences and human immunoglobulin G1 kappa constant region sequences. ABP 215 has the same primary 
structure as bevacizumab. 
The primary mechanism of action of bevacizumab involves the inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF), which is a potent mitogen and survival factor for endothelial cells. Vascular endothelial growth factor 
has been shown to bind two related VEGF receptors (VEGFRs), VEGFR-1 (Fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 [Flt-
1]) and VEGFR-2 (kinase insert domain receptor), expressed on vascular endothelial cells (Park et al, 1994; 
Waltenberger et al, 1994). When expressed alone, VEGFR-1 is unable to mediate cellular responses to VEGF 
and is only very weakly auto-phosphorylated following VEGF binding (Waltenberger et al, 1994).  
Evidence from knockout mice and recombinant expression studies demonstrate that VEGFR-2, expressed 
alone, can mediate all known cellular effects of VEGF, and is thus the primary functional receptor for VEGF 
(Shalaby et al, 1995; Waltenberger et al, 1994). Studies comparing the dose effects of VEGF on human 
umbilical vein endothelial cells (which naturally express both VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2) to cells engineered to 
express just one of the receptors, suggest that signalling is mediated primarily by VEGFR-2, but that 
heterodimers between VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 may be formed (Waltenberger et al, 1994).  
In summary, VEGF binds with high affinity to VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, but only induces tyrosine kinase activity 
of VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-2 is sufficient to mediate VEGF mitogenic and angiogenic responses. Thus, VEGFR-2 
is the primary signalling receptor for VEGF. The binding of bevacizumab to VEGF inhibits activation of VEGFR-
2 and thus inhibits angiogenesis, which is required for the growth and persistence of solid tumours and their 
metastases. Additionally, bevacizumab has been shown to inhibit VEGF-induced cellular proliferation and 
vascular permeability, and normalise the vasculature, thereby potentially promoting the delivery of cytotoxic 
chemotherapy (Goel et al, 2011). 
The Applicant claimed the same therapeutic indications and posology for the proposed biosimilar Mvasi as 
granted for Avastin in the European Union (EU): 
•  MVASI in combination with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy is indicated for treatment of adult 
patients with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum. 
•  MVASI in combination with paclitaxel is indicated for first-line treatment of adult patients with 
metastatic breast cancer.

•  MVASI, in addition to platinum-based chemotherapy, is indicated for first-line treatment of adult 
patients with unresectable advanced, metastatic or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer other than 
predominantly squamous cell histology. 
•  MVASI, in combination with erlotinib, is indicated for first-line treatment of adult patients with 
unresectable advanced, metastatic or recurrent non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer with 
Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) activating mutations. 
•  MVASI in combination with interferon alfa-2a is indicated for first-line treatment of adult patients with 
advanced and/or metastatic renal cell cancer. 
•  MVASI, in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel is indicated for the front-line treatment of adult 
patients with advanced (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stages IIIB, 
IIIC and IV) epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. 
•  MVASI, in combination with carboplatin and gemcitabine or in combination with carboplatin and 
paclitaxel, is indicated for treatment of adult patients with first recurrence of platinum-sensitive 
epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who have not received prior therapy 
with bevacizumab or other VEGF inhibitors or VEGF receptor-targeted agents. 
•  MVASI in combination with paclitaxel, topotecan, or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin is indicated for 
the treatment of adult patients with platinum-resistant recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or 
primary peritoneal cancer who received no more than two prior chemotherapy regimens and who 
have not received prior therapy with bevacizumab or other VEGF inhibitors or VEGF receptor-targeted 
agents. 
•  MVASI, in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin or, alternatively, paclitaxel and topotecan in 
patients who cannot receive platinum therapy, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
persistent, recurrent, or metastatic carcinoma of the cervix. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
Development programme/compliance with CHMP guidance/scientific advice

2.1.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
ABP 215 is a humanized monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) subclass and consists of 2 
heavy chains (HC), and 2 light chains (LC) of the kappa subclass. ABP 215 contains 32 total cysteine residues 
involved in both intrachain and interchain disulfide bonds. Each HC contains 453 amino acids with 4 
intrachain disulfides. Each LC contains 214 amino acids with 2 intrachain disulfides. Each HC contains an N-
linked glycan at the consensus glycosylation site on Asn303. The HC C-terminal Lys453 is mostly removed due 
to the presence of carboxypeptidases during the cell culture process.  
The theoretical molecular mass is 149,197 Da (glycosylated with A2G0F glycan and C-terminal lysine) and 
the experimental molecular mass is 149,200 Da (C-terminal lysine processed, all cysteines bridged) 
ABP 215 has been developed as a biosimilar product to the reference product Avastin (bevacizumab, 
EMA/H/C/000582). Like bevacizumab, ABP 215 is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a Chinese 
hamster ovary (CHO) cell expression system.  
ABP 215 binds to human vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) with high affinity and prevents the 
signalling of VEGF receptors VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, and heterodimers of VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3. 
VEGF-A-induced signalling through these receptors results in the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells and 
angiogenesis. Although VEGF-A-induced angiogenesis is required for normal vascular neogenesis, skeletal 
growth, reproductive functions and wound repair, VEGF-A also plays a key role in pathological angiogenesis 
that is required for solid tumour growth and metastasis. VEGF-A antagonists have been shown to reduce 
pathological angiogenesis, growth and metastasis of tumours. 
ABP 215 lacks effector functions such as antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement 
dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Description of the Manufacturing process 
The active substance is manufactured in accordance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) at 
Amgen Thousand Oaks, USA (ATO). 
Material from a single cell culture production bioreactor is harvested and purified to comprise a single lot of 
active substance. The process begins with thawing a working cell bank (WCB) vial. A single production lot is 
initiated from a single vial thaw. After the vial thaw, the process includes steps for expanding the culture to 
inoculate the production bioreactor. At the end of the production culture, cells and cellular debris are 
removed through the harvest steps.  
Purification of ABP 215 is achieved through a series of chromatography, filtration, and viral inactivation steps. 
Product pools are held within defined hold times and temperatures prior to further processing.

The container closure system for the active substance is a 10 L polycarbonate container with a polypropylene 
screw thread cap and thermoplastic elastomer gasket. Specifications for the container closure components 
have been provided and are satisfactory. 
Acceptable hold times at defined temperatures have been established for harvest and purification in-process 
pools. The acceptable hold times were determined in process characterization studies for chemical stability. 
Validation studies were also conducted to establish validated hold times based on in-process product quality 
and a demonstration of microbial control at the production scale. During manufacturing, the pool holds are 
controlled within the validated hold times through the manufacturing procedures. No reprocessing is 
proposed for the active substance manufacturing process. 
Control of materials 
All manufacturing raw materials are received, identified, sampled, quarantined, tested, labeled, and released 
according to established written procedures.  
A listing of raw materials and process solutions, including cell culture media, stock solutions and buffers, used 
in the active substance manufacturing process has been provided. Compendial materials are tested to the 
referenced compendia. Specifications are provided for all non-compendial materials and media solutions used 
in the process and considered acceptable.  
The production cell line was generated at Amgen. The source, history and generation of the cell substrate and 
cell line development was described. 
Verification of the bevacizumab primary sequence was performed using analytical techniques including 
Edman N-terminal sequencing, liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for 
peptide mapping of enzymatically cleaved product, and mass analysis of intact and reduced product by 
electrospray ionization time-of-flight (ESI-TOF) mass spectrometry. 
The master cell bank (MCB) and working cell bank (WCB) were manufactured in compliance with current 
good manufacturing practices (cGMP) and tested and characterized according to ICH Q5D. 
Relevant testing was performed to confirm the integrity and genetic stability of the cell line through the limit 
of in vitro cell age (LIVCA). 
Any future WCBs will be created from a MCB vial following the submitted protocol. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The control strategy incorporates the standard elements of the Applicant’s control strategy, which is used in 
the control of manufacture of many of the Applicant’s products. Elements include identification of Critical 
Quality Attributes (CQAs) by risk assessment, followed by identification of the process steps and operations 
which could impact these CQAs. Suitable strategies have been implemented to ensure process parameters 
remain within ranges which are demonstrated to not impact on the CQAs. These strategies include control of 
equipment and operations within pre-defined critical process parameter ranges, monitoring/control of In-
process controls (IPCs) and release specifications, validation, stability, comparability etc. To ensure the 
suitability of the overall control strategy, a Product Quality Risk Assessment was conducted, which assesses 
the impact of severity, occurrence and detectability of any excursion to a CQA. The risk assessment confirms 
that no medium or high risk steps are identified. This risk assessment will be re-examined periodically.  
Assessment report  
EMA/798844/2017 
Page 14/91 
 
  
  
IPCs are used to monitor the manufacturing process to ensure that the active substance and resulting 
finished product will meet quality requirements, or to monitor process consistency. 
Process validation 
The active substance manufacturing process was validated at ATO. Validation acceptance criteria for process 
parameters and performance indicators were based on reference product data, process understanding gained 
from prior knowledge, process characterization, and clinical manufacturing. Process validation was completed 
for cell culture, harvest, purification, and in-process pool holds. Validation data demonstrated that the 
process is controlled and reproducible while consistently producing active substance having the required 
quality when conducted within the defined operating ranges.  
Additionally, cleaning effectiveness as well as performance over the lifetime of the chromatography resins 
and ultrafiltration/diafiltration (UF/DF) membranes is adequately supported by small scale studies and 
ongoing validation. 
Data has also been presented to validate the shipping duration. 
Manufacturing process development 
Throughout development, no changes in scale and no significant changes to the active substance 
manufacturing process were made. A single site change was made between the manufacture of development 
and clinical lots. The proposed commercial site is the same as that used to produce the clinical lots.  
The active substance was initially manufactured at Amgen Washington (AWA) using the pre-master cell bank. 
Material manufactured at AWA was used to establish the primary reference standard and in pre-clinical 
studies. The process was transferred to ATO at the same scale. With the exception of the implementation of 
the WCB, no changes were made to the process as a result of the transfer. 
During development, a comparability study was performed to demonstrate that the clinical material 
manufactured at ATO was comparable to the development lots manufactured at AWA. The comparability 
assessment included lot release methods capable of assessing product purity and a characterization method 
capable of detecting differences in glycan species. All lots were tested using routine lot release methods for 
purity, potency, and general properties. Minor differences between the development batches and the clinical 
batches were observed, but concluded to be without any biological significance. 
Characterisation 
The elucidation of structure studies were conducted using ABP 215 active substance manufactured at ATO 
using the intended commercial process and scale. Characterization included biochemical studies (primary 
structure, glycosylation, disulfide structure, charge variants and size variants), biophysical studies (secondary 
structure, tertiary structure and thermal stability), biological studies (mechanism of action, including antigen 
specificity and Fc functionality) and forced degradation studies under specific stress conditions, to reveal 
potential degradation pathways and understand product quality attributes. 
The primary structure was confirmed by peptide mapping and mass analysis, with 100% sequence coverage 
and good correlation with expected values for the polypeptide and expected glycoforms. Details have been 
provided for product-related substances, which are present at low levels. 
Disulfide linkages were as expected, with 12 intrachain bonds and 4 interchain bonds connecting the heavy 
and light chains.  
Assessment report  
EMA/798844/2017 
Page 15/91 
  
  
ABP 215 contains a single N-linked glycosylation site at Asn303. Full analytical details of the glycans were 
provided. 
Based on comprehensive characterization presented in the dossier the determined product-related impurities 
were identified. The product-related impurities were determined to have a potential impact on patient safety 
or product efficacy. The product-related impurities are present at very low levels in the active substance and 
are controlled to acceptable levels by the manufacturing process. Process-related impurities encompass those 
derived from or introduced during the active substance manufacturing process. Included are impurities from 
the host cell line and raw materials used during cell culture and downstream processing. 
The removal of host cell protein (HCP), DNA, and residual protein A in the active substance process was 
evaluated in commercial-scale runs. Removal of these impurities to predefined acceptance criteria was 
demonstrated during challenge studies performed at small-scale during process characterization and 
confirmed during process validation.  
Specification 
Active substance specifications are given for identity, purity, potency, quantity, adventitious agents, as well 
as general tests. The active substance release specifications are considered acceptable.  
Analytical methods 
The Applicant has provided summaries of the analytical methods applied during active substance 
manufacture as well as detailed descriptions on how the methods are performed. Non-pharmacopoeial 
analytical methods have been appropriately validated.  
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data have been provided for all active substance lots used during development through 
process validation. Fifteen lots were produced at the Amgen Washington (AWA) process development facility 
or the Amgen Thousand Oaks (ATO) active substance manufacturing facility. Each lot was tested to the 
specification in place at the time of testing. The results confirm consistency of the manufacturing process. 
Reference materials 
The primary and working reference standards are well characterized. An acceptable study protocol is in place 
for control of the stability of the reference standard. Forty-eight months data are currently available from 
real-time studies at -70oC ± 10oC supporting that the primary reference standard is stable. Additionally, 
results from a one month real-time stability study have been provided, demonstrating stability of the 
reference standard when held at 2oC to 8oC for up to 1 month. 
A protocol for qualification of future reference standards has been provided, including studies for monitoring 
the stability. 
Stability 
An expiry period has been proposed for the active substance stored at the recommended storage 
temperature.  
Stability studies were conducted at the recommended storage temperature to support the expiry period. The 
studies were performed in accordance with ICH Q5C. The chosen stability parameters for the long-term 
studies were considered acceptable and included tests for appearance, purity, potency and pH.  
Assessment report  
EMA/798844/2017

All supporting, primary, and production lots were manufactured using the intended commercial active 
substance process. Stability containers were smaller than (but otherwise identical to) the container closure 
system used in manufacturing, comprising a 30 mL polycarbonate bottle with a polypropylene screw cap and 
a thermoplastic elastomer gasket. 
For the long-term stability study no major trends were observed. 
Stability studies were conducted at accelerated and stressed conditions to compare relative rates of 
degradation, assess the effect of temperature stress on the product, and support potential temperature 
excursions. Stability data at the accelerated storage conditions demonstrate that the active substance 
remains stable under accelerated conditions. Stability data at the stressed storage condition demonstrate 
that the active substance remains stable under stressed conditions. 
2.1.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development 
Description and composition of the finished product 
The  finished  product  is  supplied  as  a  sterile,  preservative-free  concentrate  for  solution  for  intravenous 
infusion containing 25 mg/ml of bevacizumab. The product is available as a 4 mL solution in a vial containing 
100 mg of bevacizumab and as a 16 mL solution in a vial containing 400 mg of bevacizumab. The excipients 
(trehalose  dihydrate,  sodium  phosphate,  polysorbate  20,  and  water  for  injections)  are  well-known  and 
comply  with  the  Ph  Eur.  The  container  closure  system  consists  of  a  Type  I  glass  vial  with  a  fluoropolymer 
laminated elastomeric stopper and an aluminum seal with flip-off cap. The vial, stopper and seal components 
are compliant with appropriate Ph Eur monographs for primary containers and closures.  
No formula overages are included. The vials are filled to ensure a deliverable volume of 4 mL for the 100 mg 
presentation and 16 mL for the 400 mg presentation. 
Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product was developed to have the same formulation, route of administration, dosage form and 
strength as the reference product Avastin. 
The active substance and finished product have an identical formulation. Compatibility of the active 
substance with the excipients has been confirmed.  
Formulation studies were conducted to evaluate finished product stability. The results demonstrated that the 
finished product is physically and chemically stable in the selected formulation.  
Manufacturing process development 
The finished product manufacturing process was characterized to develop a comprehensive understanding in 
order to consistently deliver the required finished product quality. The process design approach was based on 
an evaluation of existing knowledge from a variety of sources, including reference product data, prior 
knowledge from other platform monoclonal antibody processes, ABP 215 process development studies and 
manufacturing experience, and the results of process risk assessments. The comprehensive process 
understanding gained from these evaluations and studies was used to establish process parameters for each 
Assessment report

process step and in-process controls (IPCs) for demonstrating acceptable process performance during routine 
manufacturing operations. Process characterization studies were performed. 
Acceptable ranges for the process parameters were established. Parameters were assessed for criticality 
based on their potential to impact product quality. When operated within the process parameter acceptable 
ranges, the process delivers acceptable quality and process performance. 
A manufacturing site change was made between clinical and commercial manufacturing.   
Analytical comparability was demonstrated between finished product manufactured at the two manufacturing 
sites using biochemical, biophysical, and biological analytical methods including methods routinely used for 
lot release and product characterisation. The comparability assessment also included an evaluation of 
accelerated stability data. The results demonstrated that the finished products were comparable.  
Analytical comparability assessments were also performed to evaluate the introduction of the 100 mg vial 
during clinical development. The 100 mg vial was shown to be comparable to the 400 mg vial. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product manufacturing process includes active substance thaw, active substance hold, active 
substance pooling and mixing, bioburden reduction filtration, filtered formulated active substance hold, 
filtered formulated active substance warming, sterile filtration, aseptic filling, stoppering and sealing, 
inspection, and storage. Reprocessing is not currently proposed during manufacturing of ABP 215 finished 
product.  
IPCs are used to ensure process consistency and product quality during the manufacture of the vials. The 
critical IPCs with action or rejection limits for the finished product manufacturing process have been 
presented.  
A comprehensive microbial control strategy has been implemented to minimize the potential for introduction 
and proliferation of microbial contaminants in order to ensure the production of sterile product. 
The finished product process validation strategy was designed to demonstrate that the manufacturing process 
is controlled and reproducible, consistently yielding finished product with the required product quality. 
The finished product manufacturing process was validated. Aseptic process validation, media fill validation, 
cleaning validation, filter validation, and equipment sterilization validation were performed in support of the 
finished product process validation. Validation acceptance criteria for process parameters and performance 
indicators were based on process understanding gained from process characterisation and clinical 
manufacturing. Three consecutive finished product lots were manufactured for both the 100 mg and 400 mg 
vial. Batch analysis data for these lots demonstrated batch to batch consistency at the commercial facility 
with the commercial process.   
The finished product can be transported by air, ground, and ocean modes between manufacturing, 
packaging, and distribution sites. Finished product exposed to transport conditions of vibration, pressure, and 
shock events has been evaluated, and the results confirm that product quality is maintained when 
transported.  
Product specification 
Assessment report  
EMA/798844/2017 
Page 18/91 
  
  
The finished product specification applies to both the 100 and 400 mg presentations. The two presentations 
are analytically comparable. Therefore, the same specification acceptance criteria are used for assessing 
product quality, with the exception of volume. 
Development of the finished product specification was performed in accordance with ICH Q6B, Specifications: 
Test Procedures and Acceptance Criteria for Biotechnological/Biological Products and ICH Q8, Pharmaceutical 
Development. 
Information gained from characterisation studies, scientific understanding of product quality attributes, as 
well as prior knowledge derived from process characterisation of other monoclonal antibodies, were used to 
determine the potential impact of quality attributes of the product on patient safety and product efficacy.  
Relevant tests have been included in the finished product specification to control appearance, identity, purity, 
potency and quantity. The product-related impurities are present at very low levels in the finished product 
and are controlled to acceptable levels by the manufacturing process. The composition of the finished product 
is identical to that of the active substance and no new impurities are introduced as a result of the finished 
product manufacture. 
The data set used to calculate and establish the acceptance limits included release testing results from the 
finished product manufactured at the clinical and commercial manufacturing sites, as well as stability data 
from finished product lots held at the recommended storage conditions. 
Analytical methods 
Validation summaries for analytical procedures used to test the finished product have been provided.  
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data have been provided for all finished product lots manufactured during development 
through process validation, covering both the 100 mg and 400 mg presentations.  
The batch analysis data presented demonstrated that the proposed finished product release limits were met 
for all batches and confirmed product reproducibility.  
Reference materials 
Please see the active substance section. The same reference standard is used for testing both the active 
substance and finished product. 
Stability of the product 
A shelf life of 24 months has been proposed for the finished product stored at the recommended storage 
temperature of 2°C to 8°C.  
The stability studies were performed in accordance with ICH Q5C. 
The supporting stability lots were manufactured using active substance manufactured using the commercial 
process. Real time data covering up to 48 months was provided.  
Primary stability lots were manufactured using active substance manufactured using the commercial process 
and scale at ATO. Real time data covering up to 48 months was provided.  
Assessment report  
EMA/798844/2017 
Page 19/91 
 
  
  
Production lots were manufactured using the commercial process and scale and with active substance 
manufactured using the commercial process and scale at ATO. Real time data covering up to 12 months was 
provided.  
The primary container closure system used for finished product lots in the stability program was identical to 
those used in clinical trial and proposed for commercial distribution. 
Stability studies at elevated temperatures were also conducted to assess the effect of accelerated stress 
conditions to confirm relative degradation rates between supporting, primary, and production/comparability 
finished product lots. Additionally, experimental studies were performed to assess the effect of other storage 
conditions (e.g. temperature cycling and light) on the finished product. 
Results of these studies, together with results from the accelerated and stressed stability studies, 
demonstrate that the finished product is stable in the primary container, protected from light, under 
conditions that may be encountered during transport, storage, handling, and use. 
As the photostability studies demonstrated that the product is sensitive to light, the SmPC states that the vial 
should be kept in the outer carton in order to protect from light. 
Data provided demonstrate that the finished product is physically stable in 0.9% saline diluent for 
intravenous administration for 48 hours at 2°C to 30°C and is compatible with commonly used IV bags and 
tubing materials. 
Based on the data provided a shelf life of 24 months is accepted.  
Analytical similarity assessment  
Mvasi (ABP 215) has been developed as a biosimilar product to the reference product Avastin 
(EMEA/H/C/000582, Marketing Authorisation held by Roche).  
The Applicant performed a comprehensive analytical similarity assessment which included comparative 
evaluations of biological activity, primary structure, higher order structure, particles and aggregates, product-
related substances and impurities, thermal stability and degradation studies, general properties, and process-
related impurities using state-of-the-art methods.  
The reference product is supplied in 100 mg and 400 mg preservative free, single-use vials to deliver 4 mL or 
16 mL of bevacizumab (25 mg/mL), respectively. For attributes not impacted by the presentation, results 
were pooled from both presentations to establish the reference product profile for analytical similarity 
assessment. For volume, which is impacted by the presentation, results were presented separately for each 
presentation. 
Generally, the approaches used for establishment of the biosimilarity assessment criteria were considered 
acceptable. According to the proposed criteria, a conclusion on comparability was made if > 90% of individual 
batches of biosimilar product fell within the calculated range of mean ± 3 SD for the reference product. This 
approach could easily lead to acceptance criteria that are too wide to conclude on similarity. However, as 
data from the analysis of individual batches were provided, an assessment can be made independently of the 
statistical model used. For attributes where a change over time was observed when stored at the 
recommended storage condition, values were adjusted for material age prior to calculating the range. The 
Applicant has provided data demonstrating suitability of the model used including goodness-of-fit and 
linearity.

Similarity with regards to the biological activity has been studied by inhibition of proliferation in human 
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), binding to the target (VEGF-A), binding kinetics for VEGF 121, and a 
comparison of the binding to the common isoforms VEGF 121 and VEGF 165. Blockade of signaling 
downstream of the receptor VEGFR-2, was evaluated using a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) assay in HUVEC. 
The specificity of ABP 215 and the reference product for VEGF-A was demonstrated using the RTK assay by 
substituting VEGF-C or VEGF-D. FcRn binding was studied using a competitive AlphaScreen binding assay. Fc 
receptor and C1q binding has been studied as well as lack of ADCC and CDC activity. The methods used were 
considered appropriate and the data presented indicate that ABP 215 and the reference product have similar 
biological activity.  
Testing for the general properties protein concentration, volume, osmolality, pH, appearance, colour and 
clarity have been performed. Slight differences were observed between the reference product and ABP 215 
regarding colour and visible particles, but these are not expected to have any clinical impact and are 
therefore considered acceptable. 
Higher order structure has been studied by FTIR spectroscopy, Near Ultraviolet Circular Dichroism and 
differential scanning calorimetry, and similarity is considered demonstrated. The levels of subvisible particles 
were determined using HIAC and MFI methods. The HIAC method measures ≥2 µm, ≥ 5 µm, ≥10 µm, and 
≥25 µm size particles. The Applicant concluded that ABP 215 has similarly low levels of HIAC subvisible 
particles compared to the reference product. 
The analytical similarity of the primary structure of ABP 215 and the reference product was established 
through the use of several complementary characterization methods, which include whole protein mass 
analysis, reduced and deglycosylated heavy chain and light chain mass analyses, reduced and non-reduced 
peptide mapping, glycan mapping, comparison of isoelectric points, extinction coefficients, and confirmation 
of identity using an immunoassay. The presented data revealed minor analytical differences in biochemical 
attributes between ABP 215 and the reference product. These differences have been justified and do not have 
any clinical significance. 
Process-related impurities such as host cell protein (HCP), host cell DNA, and leached protein A were 
characterized. Results provided support the conclusion that ABP 215 has similarly low levels of process-
related impurities compared to the reference product.

Product-related substances and impurities of ABP 215 and the reference product were assessed using a 
combination of methods that evaluate size and charge variants. Physicochemical properties of size variants 
were assessed by size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography (SE-HPLC), reduced capillary 
electrophoresis-sodium dodecyl sulfate (rCE-SDS), and non-reduced capillary electrophoresis-sodium dodecyl 
sulfate (nrCE-SDS). Additionally, potential levels of free thiol were assessed by nrCE-SDS. Charge variants 
were assessed by cation exchange high performance liquid chromatography (CEX-HPLC). The SE-HPLC 
profiles indicated slightly lower levels of HMW species for ABP 215 as compared to the reference product, 
which is acceptable and in line with guidance. Data from the rCE-SDS analysis demonstrated that ABP 215 
has slightly higher levels of % heavy chain and light chain (HC + LC), lower levels of % non-glycosylated 
heavy chain (NGHC) due to more complete glycosylation at the Asn303 glycosylation site on the HC, and 
slightly lower levels of fragment (measured as % LMW + MMW) as compared to the reference product. 
However, no impact was observed on the biological activity. The nrCE-SDS purity profile indicated slightly 
higher level of % main peak and lower level of % pre-peaks as compared to the reference product, except for 
one batch which fell just below the presented comparability range. Furthermore, charge variants assessed by 
CEX-HPLC demonstrate that ABP 215 and the reference product have a similar purity profile for CEX-HPLC, 
although ABP 215 is projected to have lower levels of acidic peaks at 24 months compared to the reference 
product. ABP 215 is also projected to have a slightly higher level of basic peak at 24 months compared to the 
reference product. Differences in C-terminal lysine is not expected to have any clinical impact, since C-
terminal lysine is rapidly removed in serum. 
Thermal stability and degradation studies have been performed indicating similar degradation profiles for ABP 
215 and reference product. 
Data was also provided to demonstrate that US batches can be considered representative of EU batches. 
However, the pivotal clinical data to support the MAA was generated with Avastin sourced in the EU. 
In general, as an overall comment to the analytical similarity assessment, some minor analytical differences 
in the biochemical attributes have been observed between ABP 215 and the reference product. These minor 
differences have been evaluated and it has been concluded that they have no clinical relevance or impact on 
the biological activity of the product. Overall, it can be concluded that the data demonstrate that ABP 215 is 
analytically similar to the reference product.  
Adventitious agents 
The Applicant’s viral safety program minimizes the potential for introduction of adventitious virus into the 
ABP 215 manufacturing process and includes the following:  
•  Master and working cell banks have been extensively tested and found to be free of detectable 
adventitious agents.  
•  Raw materials have appropriate certification.  
An assessment of risk for transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) transmission was performed on all 
raw materials from transfection of the cell line through fill and finish of the finished product. Materials not 
directly used in the process, but which may come into contact with the product during manufacturing or 
primary packaging, were also identified and assessed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/798844/2017 
Page 25/91 
  
  
The testing of the cell banks for virus contamination is considered adequate. No adventitious viruses have 
been detected, with the exception of expected A- and C-type retrovirus-like particles, which are non-
infectious and typical of the parental CHO cell line.  
The purification process includes dedicated steps that provide inactivation and removal of viruses. Additional 
viral clearance by the process is afforded by the virus removal capability of the chromatography steps. The 
capacity of the manufacturing process for removal/inactivation of viral contamination is considered 
acceptable. Viral clearance assessments utilized both non-enveloped and enveloped model viruses. Reduction 
factors are satisfactory. 
2.1.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product have 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
The  Applicant  has  successfully  demonstrated  that  ABP  215  is  analytically  similar  to  the  reference  product 
Avastin.  
2.1.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give 
reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
The Applicant has successfully demonstrated that ABP 215 is analytically similar to the reference product 
Avastin. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The applicant presented in vitro pharmacology studies (eg VEGF-A binding; FcRn binding) with bevacizumab 
(Motanga) and bevacizumab (Avastin) and in vivo studies which assessed activity in vascular permeability 
and anti-tumour activity in xenograft experiments in mice. The PK of ABP 215 versus bevacizumab (US) was 
characterized in a non-GLP, single-dose study in rats and the TK of ABP 215 versus bevacizumab (US) was 
characterized in a GLP-compliant, multiple-dose toxicology study in cynomolgus monkey. 
A 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study was conducted with ABP 215 and bevacizumab (US) in cynomolgus 
monkeys.

In vivo 
Bevacizumab has been extensively evaluated in a number of studies, including a range of tumour xenograft 
models, demonstrating tumour growth inhibition, reduced microvessel density and decreased vascular 
tortuosity and permeability.  
Two xenograft tumour models were used to compare the effects of ABP 215 and bevacizumab (US) on 
tumour growth and tumour vasculature. Data from these xenograft models showed that ABP 215 and 
bevacizumab (US) are similarly able to inhibit tumour growth and decrease vascular permeability. 
Furthermore, the results suggest that ABP 215 inhibits tumour growth in a manner similar to bevacizumab 
(US) and consistent with the known bevacizumab MOA. 
Effect of ABP 215 and bevacizumab (US) treatment on tumour growth in an A431 tumour xenograft model in 
female athymic nude mice (study ID R20120191) 
Athymic nude mice (10 females/group) were injected subcutaneously (SC) with A431 tumour cells at a 
concentration of 5 x 106 cells per mouse. Eight days later, bevacizumab (US) or ABP 215  was administered 
by intraperitoneal (IP) injection at doses of 10 or 100 µg twice weekly for 12 days. Tumour sizes and body 
weights were measured twice per week.  
ABP 215 and bevacizumab (US) both significantly inhibited tumour growth when compared to the control 
group (IgG1) (see Figure 1). At both dose levels, ABP 215 inhibited tumour growth similarly to bevacizumab 
(US), with no observed statistical differences (p = 0.34 for the 10-µg dose and p = 0.16 for the 100-µg 
dose). There was no body weight loss in any of the treatment groups.

Effect of bevacizumab (US) and ABP 215 treatment on A421 tumour xenograft growth and CD31 staining of 
vasculature in female athymic nude mice (study ID R20120192) 
ABP 215 and bevacizumab (US) were evaluated for their ability to inhibit tumour-induced vascularization, as 
measured by CD31 staining (CD31 is expressed on the endothelial cell surface). Athymic nude mice (10 
females/group) were injected with 5 × 106 cells/mL A431 cells in the right flank. Eight days later, ABP 215 or 
bevacizumab (US) was administered ip at 100 mg, twice per week. Tumour sizes and body weights were 
measured twice per week. After 1 week of treatment (2 doses), tumours were removed, sectioned, and 
stained for CD31. CD31 is expressed on the endothelial cell surface, and blood vessel area (% CD31+) was 
measured as a percentage of tissue area.  
Results are presented in Figure 2. ABP 215 and bevacizumab at 100 μg significantly inhibited tumour growth 
when compared to vehicle resulting in 51% TGI. There was no body weight loss in either of the treatment 
groups. Both ABP 215 and bevacizumab (US) resulted in a significant and similar decrease in vessel area 
compared with control (IgG1), as measured by CD31 staining.

106 cells per mouse. Ten days later, ABP 215 or bevacizumab (US) was administered by IP injection at 10 or 
100 µg twice weekly for 10 days. Tumour sizes and body weights were measured twice per week.  
ABP 215, at both dose levels, inhibited tumour growth similarly to bevacizumab (US) (see Figure 3), with no 
observed statistical difference (p = 0.50 for the 10-µg dose and p = 0.95 for the 100-µg dose); ABP 215 and 
bevacizumab (US) significantly inhibited tumour growth when compared to the control group (IgG1). There 
was no body weight loss in any of the treatment groups.

measured as a percentage of tissue area. 
Results are presented in Figure 4. Bevacizumab and ABP 215 treatment inhibited growth of Colo205 
xenograft tumours. Both treatment groups showed statistically decreased vessel area as measured by CD31

used. Briefly, on day 1, groups of athymic nude mice were injected IP with 100 µg of isotype control (IgG1); 
3, 10, 30, or 100 µg of ABP 215; or 3, 10, 30, or 100 µg of bevacizumab (US). On day 2, the mice were 
injected SC on the ventral surface with 1 × 105 HEK cells transfected with either empty vector or vector 
containing the sequence for rhu VEGF. On day 3, the mice were IV injected with Evans Blue dye to quantify 
the level of vascular permeability via spectrophotometry.  
Results are presented in Figure 5. ABP 215 inhibits rhu VEGF-induced vascular permeability in mouse skin 
vasculature in a similar fashion to bevacizumab (US). Although there appears to be a difference in 
permeability between ABP 215 and bevacizumab (US) at 3 µg dose level, this difference is attributed to assay 
variability at low dose levels.

PK study of bevacizumab and high-mannose variant ABP 215 following IV administration of a single 1 mg/kg 
dose to male Sprague-Dawley rats with cross-over satellite groups (study ID 114878, non-GLP) 
Male SD-rats were assigned to 2 groups of 12 rats and received a single IV injection of 1 mg/kg ABP 215  or 
1 mg/kg bevacizumab (US) on day 0. On day 21, 4 rats from each group were crossed over to receive a 
single IV 1-mg/kg dose of the alternate treatment to the one received initially. Serum samples were collected 
from all animals for PK analysis on day 0 and day 21, using the ELISA method.  
Following IV administration on day 0, ABP 215 serum concentration profiles were similar to those from 
bevacizumab (US) treatment groups (see Table 6). On Day 21, 4 rats from each treatment group were

crossed over and received a single IV dose of the alternate test article to the one their received initially, i.e. 
initial dose with ABP 215 and subsequent dose with bevacizumab. A slight accumulation in exposure was 
noted in both groups since the bioanalytical assay detects both ABP 215 and bevacizumab.

Multiple-dose IV toxicokinetic study in cynomolgus monkeys (Study ID 114831, GLP) 
Twelve monkeys (6 females and 6 males) were assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups (3/sex/group) receiving 
50 mg/kg ABP 215 or 50 mg/kg bevacizumab (US) IV on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, and 25. Serum 
samples were collected from all animals for TK analysis at predose, 0.25, 1, 4, 8, 24, 48, and 72 hours post 
dose on day 1 and at predose, 0.25, 1, 4, 8, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours post dose on day 25. Serum samples 
were analysed for ABP 215, bevacizumab (US) and anti-drug antibody (ADA) concentrations using validated 
ECL methods.  
Results are presented in Figure 6 and Table 7. No sex differences in TK parameter estimates were observed. 
A moderate and similar accumulation in exposure was observed from day 1 to day 25 with an AR of 3.26 for 
ABP 215 and 3.40 for bevacizumab (US). Mean concentration-time profiles were similar between the 2 
groups. Day 1 and day 25 serum TK parameters for ABP 215 were similar to those for the bevacizumab (US) 
dose group and contribute to the totality of evidence to support the demonstration of ABP 215 as a biosimilar 
product to bevacizumab.

Antibodies to ABP 215 or bevacizumab were not detected in any animals treated with ABP 215 or 
bevacizumab (US). However, considering that the immunoassay can tolerate up to 10 μg/mL of ABP 215 or 
bevacizumab at the lower limit of reliable detection, high levels of circulating drug could possibly have 
interfered with the ability to detect antibodies in the drug safety studies.

ABP 215 and bevacizumab (US): 1-month intravenous toxicology study in the Cynomolgus monkey (study ID 
114831, GLP) 
The purpose of the study was to demonstrate a lack of unexpected effects with ABP 215 and to qualitatively 
compare the toxicity of ABP 215 and bevacizumab (US). Three monkeys/sex/group (initial age 2.6-3.4 years) 
were administered ABP 215 or bevacizumab (US) at 50 mg/kg IV twice weekly for 1 month (8 doses). A 
vehicle control group was not included because the study objective was to compare the 2 drug products; a 
vehicle control group was not considered necessary to identify the primary toxicity of femoral physeal 
dysplasia (the main and most sensitive endpoint of the study) and this study design reduced the use of 
nonhuman primates.

The dose selection of 50 mg/kg IV was based on the highest dose in the original 1-month toxicology study 
with bevacizumab (Avastin FDA Approval Package: Toxicology Data, 2004; Ryan et al, 1999), in which 
physeal dysplasia was observed in Cynomolgus monkeys. A 1-month study was considered to be of sufficient 
duration to identify potential differences in toxicological effects and to evaluate the most sensitive toxicity 
finding, physeal dysplasia. Samples were tested for TK parameters and anti-drug antibodies using validated 
ECL immunoassays (see section 4.1). 
Mean TK parameters and concentration-time profiles were similar between the 2 groups (see Table 7: in 
section 4.2) and there were no apparent sex differences. No antidrug antibodies were detected in the ABP 
215 or bevacizumab (US) groups; however, high levels of circulating drug may have interfered with the 
assay. 
ABP 215 and bevacizumab (US) were well tolerated. No ABP 215- or bevacizumab (US)-related effects were 
observed on clinical signs, body weight, food consumption, physiologic measurements (heart rate and body 
temperature), ophthalmic or electrocardiogram examinations, haematology, serum chemistry, coagulation, 
urinalysis, or on macroscopic necropsy observations. 
In the original bevacizumab 1-month toxicology study, a trend toward reduced organ to body weight of the 
uterus and ovaries that did not achieve statistical significance was described. In the current comparative 
study, ovarian and uterine to body weights were similar between the ABP 215 and bevacizumab (US) groups. 
Overall, average ovary-to-body weights were slightly reduced for ABP 215 and bevacizumab (US) compared 
to historical controls. Uterine weights were more variable, and one animal administered ABP 215 had a higher 
uterus weight than any of the historical controls; this animal was the only one to have histological evidence 
of having ovulated at least once, whereas the remainder of the animals in this study appeared histologically 
to be sexually immature or peripubertal. 
In the original bevacizumab 1-month toxicology study, light microscopy histology revealed femoral physeal 
dysplasia, characterized by a linear cessation of growth line and chondrocyte hyperplasia, which was 
observed in all males at 50 mg/kg. In the current study, physeal dysplasia was observed in the femur of all 
animals dosed with either ABP 215 or bevacizumab (US), primarily characterized by a thicker than expected 
physeal growth plate that contained long columns of large chondrocytes. Femoral physeal dysplasia was mild 
in severity in both groups and affected all animals, indicating ABP 215 and bevacizumab (US) had similar 
effects.

Other toxicity studies 
Immunogenicity of ABP 215 in comparison with bevacizumab (US) was assessed as part of the 1-month 
toxicology study in monkeys (Study 114831). No antidrug antibodies (ADA) were detected in the ABP 215 or 
bevacizumab (US) treated groups; however, high levels of circulating drug may have interfered with the 
assay. 
2.2.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Bevacizumab is a protein, which is expected to biodegrade in the environment and not be a significant risk to 
the environment. Thus, according to the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal 
Products for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), bevacizumab is exempt from preparation of an 
Environmental Risk Assessment as the product and excipients do not pose a significant risk to the 
environment. 
2.2.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
A comprehensive number of in vitro functional assays has been conducted by the Applicant to substantiate 
similarity between ABP 215 and the European reference product Avastin (bevacizumab (EU)) in terms of

The in vitro data have demonstrated similarity between ABP 215 and bevacizumab (EU). The similarity is 
further supported by in vivo PD studies from xenograft models comparing APB 215 and bevacizumab (US).   
High-mannose may influence PK when present at relatively high levels. In general, the amount of high-
mannose in ABP 215 (about 2.5%) is significantly higher than in bevacizumab (EU and US). In a cross-over 
study in rats, however, the PK properties of an early-developmental lot of ABP 215 with 3.5% high-mannose 
were comparable to bevacizumab (US).  
A 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study was conducted with ABP 215 and bevacizumab (US) in cynomolgus 
monkeys, indicating comparable toxicity, toxicokinetic and immunogenic properties. Non-human primate 
toxicity studies are considered of limited value for biosimilarity evaluation and such studies are not generally 
recommended. The small format of these studies lacks any power to detect differences of potential clinical 
importance. It is, however, acknowledged that these studies were conducted as part of a global development.  
The toxicokinetic properties of ABP 215 were characterized and compared with that of bevacizumab (US) in a 
GLP-compliant repeat-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys after single and multiple doses of 50 
mg/kg/week (iv). The TK properties of ABP 215 were determined to be similar to that of bevacizumab (US).

Antibodies to bevacizumab (US) were not detected in any animal treated with ABP 215 or bevacizumab (US). 
However, high levels of circulating drug could possibly have interfered with the ability to detect antibodies in 
the drug safety studies. 
No separate local tolerance studies have been conducted with ABP 215. The intended formulation for ABP 215 
is identical to Avastin, and no new excipients are introduced. Consequently, evaluation of local tolerance is 
not required. Local tolerance endpoints were, however incorporated in the repeat-dose toxicity study, with 
similar findings in both treatment groups. 
No anti-ABP 215 or anti-bevacizumab antibodies were detected in monkeys, however, high levels of 
circulating drug may have interfered with the assay.  Although anti-drug antibody (ADA) -formation was not 
evaluated in rats, a decline in both ABP 215 and bevacizumab (US) PK profile was observed in a single-dose, 
crossover PK study in rats (study ID 114878), potentially related to ADA-formation. 
Studies on secondary pharmacodynamics, safety pharmacology, pharmacodynamics drug interactions, 
genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and reproduction and developmental toxicity were not conducted. This is 
considered acceptable for a biosimilar product, and is in accordance with EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010. 
2.2.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In view of the non-clinical data presented, ABP 215 can be considered similar to the reference product 
Avastin in terms of in vitro and in vivo functionality and toxicological, toxicokinetic and immunogenicity 
profiles.  
The non-clinical information under section 5.3 of the Avastin SmPC applies also to the SmPC of MVASI.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
In the phase I clinical study 20110216 in healthy subjects, the primary objective was to demonstrate 
bioequivalence of ABP 215 relative to EU-sourced, as well as US-sourced Avastin (bevacizumab) following a 3 
mg/ kg body weight single iv injection. The secondary objective of this study was to determine the safety, 
tolerability, and immunogenicity of ABP 215 in healthy male subjects compared with bevacizumab (US) and 
bevacizumab (EU). 
In the phase III clinical study 20120265 in patients, trough (pre-dose) plasma levels of bevacizumab or ABP 
215 was determined following repeat dose administration at weeks 4, 7 and 13, and at end of study. 
The same bioanalytical methods were used for the phase I study (20110216) and the phase III study 
(20120265). ABP 215, bevacizumab (EU) and bevacizumab (US) were determined by 
electrochemiluminescence (ECL) following an antibody capture procedure. Method validation and the results 
of incurred sample analysis have been provided. 
Phase I study (20110216) 
The study was conducted at two sites, one in EU and one in US. First enrolment was 13 June 2012, and the 
last end-of-study visit was 23 November 2012. Sample analyses were performed at ICON Development 
Solutions, LLC, Whitesboro, NY, USA between 24 September 2012 and 4 January 2013. 
The original protocol dated 15 February 2012 was updated twice (19 March 2012 and 14 May 2012). The 
amendments involved corrections of typing errors, or otherwise minor changes. The most important changes 
were additions of exclusion criteria and minor changes to the clinical (adverse events) evaluation of subjects. 
One amendment was made to the statistical analysis plan (SAP) 21 January 2013: AUClast was added to the 
formal statistical analysis in the SAP – this parameter was not mentioned in the protocol. In the SAP 
amendment, the primary statistical analysis was also changed from being an analysis of protein content 
factor adjusted AUClast, AUCinf, and Cmax to being an analysis of unadjusted AUClast, AUCinf, and Cmax. The 
analysis of adjusted AUClast, AUCinf, and Cmax was included as a sensitivity analysis. In the subgroup/ 
sensitivity analyses the unadjusted AUClast, AUCinf, and Cmax was used as the parameters of interest.  
This study was a randomised, single-blind, single-dose, 3-arm, parallel group, phase I study. A total of 202 
healthy subjects (aged 18-45 years) were enrolled to the study; 34 + 34 subjects in the ABP 215 group and 
67 in each of the bevacizumab (US and EU, respectively) groups. Sixty three (63), 64 and 64 subjects, 
respectively, completed the study. All 202 subjects were included in the safety population. In each group, all

subjects received a single dose (3 mg/ kg body weight) of ABP 215, EU-sourced bevacizumab, or US-sourced 
bevacizumab by i.v. infusion. 
Test product was ABP 215 (batch number 1033020 (US) and 1032747 (EU)), which is representative for 
commercial batches of APB 215. Reference products were EU-sourced bevacizumab (batch H0135B13) and 
US-sourced bevacizumab (batch 970032).   
Blood samples for PK analysis were collected at time zero (pre-dose), at 1.5 (end of infusion), 4, 8, 12 and 
24 hours after the start of dosing, at days 3, 5, 8, 11, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 50, 64 and 78, and at the end of 
study visit (day 85). 
The primary objective of the study was: To demonstrate bioequivalence as assessed principally by the area 
under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) from time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUCinf) and the 
maximum observed serum concentration (Cmax) of ABP 215 following a 3 mg/kg intravenous (IV) infusion 
relative to that from a 3 mg/kg IV infusion of bevacizumab (US) and bevacizumab (EU). 
The secondary objective of this study was: To determine the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of ABP 
215 in healthy male subjects compared with bevacizumab (US) and bevacizumab (EU). 
Primary PK endpoints were: 
•  AUCinf and Cmax of ABP 215, bevacizumab (US), and bevacizumab (EU)  
•  AUClast was included as primary PK endpoint after the clinical phase  
Secondary Endpoints were: 
•  Subject incidence of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), vital signs, laboratory safety tests, ECGs, and 
subject incidence of ADAs. 
• 
Pharmacokinetic parameter AUClast of ABP 215, bevacizumab (US), and bevacizumab (EU). 
Equivalence of the primary endpoints (AUCinf, Cmax) was determined if the 90% CI for the ratio of geometric 
means of test-to-reference was within the predefined acceptance interval of 0.8 to 1.25.

Pharmacokinetic profiles for healthy volunteers were simulated using the population PK model for 
bevacizumab in patients with patient-specific covariates removed (Lu et al 2008). These simulations indicated 
a t ½ of 19.8 days, which was consistent with previous reports. Results from these simulations also predicted 
that PK monitoring for approximately 85 days would have resulted in greater than 97% of subject having 
AUC from time 0 to the last quantifiable concentration (AUClast) values greater than 85% of AUCinf (ie, the 
extrapolated AUC would have been ≤ 15 % of AUCinf).  
In accordance with the protocol, the following subgroup analyses were performed:

•  Body weight: Body weight was determined to be a significant predictor of bevacizumab PK. Following 
the inclusion of body weight as a covariate in the statistical model, bioequivalence between the three 
products was however confirmed.  
•  Outliers: Four samples were determined to be outliers and re-analysed due to an apparent systematic 
10-fold error in these four samples, which were analysed at the same time by the same analyst. Re-
analysis confirmed the assumption that a dilution error had occured in these four samples, and the 
re-assay result were included in the PK analysis.

Protein Content Factor Adjusted Analysis: Protein contents were 25.6, 24.8, and 25.1 mg/mL for ABP 
215, bevacizumab [US], and bevacizumab [EU], respectively. For all 3 parameters, the 90 % CIs for 
the ratios of adjusted GMs were fully within 0.80 to 1.25. 
Phase III study (20120265) 
Sample analyses were performed at ICON Development Solutions, LLC, Whitesboro, NY, USA. 
This study was a randomised, double-blind, active-controlled study in adult subjects with non-squamous 
NSCLC receiving first-line chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel. A total of 630 patients were enrolled 
to the study; 322 subjects in the ABP 215 group and 308 in the bevacizumab group. 195 and 208 subjects, 
respectively, completed the study. In each group, all subjects received a dose of 15 mg/kg administered as 
an intravenous (IV) infusion every 3 weeks (Q3W) for 6 cycles.  
Test product was ABP 215;  Reference product was bevacizumab (Avastin EU). 
Blood samples for PK analysis were collected at time zero (baseline), and at weeks 4, 7, 13 and 19. Anti-drug 
antibodies were determined at baseline, and at weeks 7, 13, 19 and at follow-up. 
PK endpoint was Ctrough.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic data has been submitted as part of this application (see discussion on Clinical 
Pharmacology).

EMA/798844/2017 
Page 43/91 
 
  
  
2.3.4.  Immunogenicity 
Serum samples for anti-drug antibodies were collected pre-dose on day 1 and on day 85 at the end of study 
visit. ADA positive cases were to be followed until ADA negative or for 1 year.  
Analytical methods 
A stepwise approach of screening, confirmatory and neutralising Ab assays was adopted. 
Screening for Binding antibodies 
Sera were screened for a signal-to-noise (S/N) value greater than the assay cut point and then tested in the 
specificity assay for signal inhibition in the presence of excess soluble drug before being regarded as positive 
for the presence of anti-ABP 215 antibodies, ADA. Direct evidence to support stability of the positive control 
Ab is not provided. The general principle of Ab stability is accepted and is supported by Hendricks et al 2014 
for specific Abs to Adenovirus, Plasmodium sp. Circumzoite CS protein, HAV, and HBV including the 2nd 
international anti-HB standard as a positive polyclonal serum (NIBSC 07/164, 2008) – but affinity purified 
polyclonal rabbit Abs were not tested. Company reports were cited with details of the stability criteria for 
affinity purified anti-drug rabbit polyclonal Abs but no copies provided. In these specific circumstances this 
issue will not be pursued further. 
Neutralising Ab assay  
Very limited data have been provided to show that the assay is able to detect both ADA to ABP-215 and the 
RMP to an equivalent extent. Additional data are required to support the assumption, based on the cross-
reactivity studies, that the ADA assays have equivalent sensitivity in detecting ADA to Avastin and ABP 215. 
Evidence of antigenic equivalence is presented, but evidence of antibody equivalence is lacking, although in 
this specific context the issue will not be pursued further. Drug tolerance indicates the screening, 
confirmatory and neutralising Ab assays should be able to detect ADA in the end of study samples when 
bevacizumab concentrations after a single dose are ~2 µg/ml. Typical trough bevacizumab levels of 100 – 
150 µg/ml in the clinical studies should allow detection of higher titre ADA. The ADA assay may fail to detect 
binding ADA at trough bevacizumab levels of >250µg/ml seen in some patients although these subjects are 
likely to be immunosuppressed by the chemotherapy received. This problem might be avoided by analysis of 
end of study samples when bevacizumab levels should be lower. 
Results 
ADA subjects were to be listed and summarised by treatment group. Subgroup analysis of ADA subjects was 
planned but not executed as no ADA positive cases were identified. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetic properties of ABP 215 were compared to those of both EU- and US-sourced 
bevacizumab (Avastin) in two clinical trials: A pivotal phase I clinical study in healthy subjects, following a 3 
mg/ kg body weight single i.v. injection, and by analysis of trough (pre-dose) plasma levels of ABP 215 or 
bevacizumab following repeat dose administration in patients (15 mg/ kg).  
The single dose parallel arm design with sampling over 4 serum half-lives is acceptable for PK determination.  
Assessment report  
EMA/798844/2017 
Page 44/91 
 
  
  
The primary endpoints of the phase I clinical study (i.e. AUClast, AUCinf and Cmax) with their 90% confidence 
intervals are well within the predefined acceptance range of 80-125%: The geometric LS means ratios for the 
comparison of ABP 215 and EU sourced Avastin for AUClast, AUCinf and Cmax were 1.03, 0.96 and 0.96 and the 
corresponding 90%CIs [0.982-1.080], [0.916-1.006], [0.920-1.004], respectively. 
Interpretation of the PK data is complicated by extreme values for t max of 8 – 24 hours after a 90 minute 
infusion of ABP215 or Bevacizumab (EU) and median values for Bevacizumab (EU) were more than 2xt max for 
ABP215 or Bevacizumab (US).  
The Tmax of ABP 215 occurred at 4 hours for 34.4% of subjects at the EU site versus 14.3% at the US site. 
The same trend of a higher proportion of subjects with tmax at 4 hours was observed for the bevacizumab 
(EU) group (48.4%) versus the bevacizumab (US) group (19.7%) In summary, the observed difference in 
median t max for both ABP 215 and bevacizumab (EU) at the EU site is neither related to the product nor to 
infusion duration or PK sample collection deviations. The apparent difference between sites likely represents a 
chance occurrence that does not impact the ability to conclude PK similarity from this study.  
It is noted that although bevacizumab-US vs bevacizumab-EU was not randomised between centres the 
allocation of ABP 215 (IMP) versus bevacizumab (RMP) was randomised at each centre. 
The binding ADA validation indicated the impact of higher bevacizumab concentrations (>150 µg/ml) on the 
ability to detect ADA, The trough bevacizumab levels achieved, together with the PK data provided, indicate 
there is significant overlap with drug tolerance limits for the binding ADA assay before the end of study 
samples.  
During the procedure, the applicant provided data regarding EOS sera tested for ADA by standard protocol 
from 95 of 102 subjects, (ABP 215 = 49, bevacizumab = 46) followed for approximately 6 months beyond 
end of treatment (EOT) period. One of 95 subjects tested was positive for binding ADA and negative for 
neutralizing ADA after EOT. This additional testing of 95 subjects at the EOS, when drug concentrations were 
low, provides reassurance of similar and low immunogenicity. The risk of false-negatives is mitigated by ADA 
assessment of all available post-EOT samples. 
No difference in Ctrough was observed between the ABP 215 and the bevacizumab groups at any time-point 
during the phase III clinical study. 
No new pharmacodynamic data has been submitted as part of this application.  
No validated PD markers considered relevant to predicting efficacy of bevacizumab in patients do so far exist. 
Therefore, no PD markers were included in the ABP 215 PK study, and clinical endpoints were utilised in the 
phase 3 study in NSCLC patients. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The Applicant has demonstrated that the pharmacokinetic properties of ABP 215 are comparable to those of 
reference bevacizumab product following i.v. injection. 
The clinical pharmacology information under section 5.2 of the Avastin SmPC applies also to Mvasi.

Study 20120265: A randomized, double-blind, phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of 
ABP 215 compared with bevacizumab in subjects with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. 
Methods 
Clinical similarity was evaluated in subjects with advanced NSCLC under the conditions of use approved for 
bevacizumab. 
The study was a randomised, double-blind, active-controlled study in adult subjects with non-squamous 
NSCLC receiving first-line chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel. Patients were to be randomised 
(1:1) to receive investigational product (ABP 215 or bevacizumab) at a dose of 15 mg/kg administered as an 
intravenous (IV) infusion every 3 weeks (Q3W) for 6 cycles. All subjects were to receive additional 
carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy Q3W for at least 4 and not more than 6 cycles. Subjects were 
stratified by geographic region (Eastern Europe vs Western Europe vs Asia Pacific/Other vs North America), 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0 vs 1), and sex. Maintenance 
monotherapy was not included in the study.  
No reductions in IP dose were allowed in the study. If adverse events occurred that necessitated delaying IP, 
the dose remained unchanged once treatment resumed. 
In the clinical study report (CSR) in the table: Schedule of assessments and Procedures the following 
was defined: 
End of treatment was defined as 21 (+7) days after the last dose of investigational product or study-specified 
chemotherapy. A subject was to remain on the treatment phase until 21 days after the last dose of 
bevacizumab or study-specified chemotherapy.

Follow-up was defined as the period after the end of treatment visit were subjects were followed for disease 
progression and/or overall survival (OS) until the end of the clinical study, withdrawal of consent, lost to 
follow-up, death, or proscribed therapy (e.g. commercial bevacizumab, non-study anti-cancer treatment). 
End of study was defined as the last day that protocol specified procedures were conducted for an individual 
subject.

Study Participants  
The subject population was selected based upon the approved bevacizumab NSCLC indication and represents 
a sensitive population to rule out any clinically meaningful differences between ABP 215 and bevacizumab. 
Eligible subjects met the following key criteria: 
1. Males and females ≥ 18 and < 80 years of age with histologically or cytologically confirmed non-squamous 
NSCLC 
2. Stage 4 or recurrent metastatic NSCLC with measurable disease according to modified RECIST v1.1. For 
subjects with recurrent disease, at least 12 months had to have elapsed since completing adjuvant 
chemotherapy. Subjects had to have had a baseline scan (CT or MRI) of the chest and abdomen to assess 
disease burden before enrolling in study and receiving first-line chemotherapy for NSCLC. If the scan had 
been performed more than 28 days prior to randomization, an additional scan was to be obtained 
3. Subjects had to be initiating first-line carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy within 8 days after 
randomization and be expected to receive at least 4 cycles of chemotherapy

Treatments 
Subjects were randomly assigned to one of the following two treatment arms: 
• 
Treatment A: ABP 215, IV infusion, 15 mg/kg Q3W with IV carboplatin (area under the concentration-
time curve [AUC] of 6) and paclitaxel (200 mg/m2). 
• 
Treatment B: bevacizumab, IV infusion, 15 mg/kg Q3W with IV carboplatin (AUC 6) and paclitaxel 
(200 mg/m2). 
In both treatment arms, doses were administered Q3W (±7 days) for 6 cycles. The dosage for both ABP 215 
and bevacizumab was 15 mg/kg Q3W. The dosage was chosen to align with the EU-approved dosing 
instructions for the treatment of NSCLC with bevacizumab in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel. 
All of the following were prohibited at any time during the study: 
• 
• 
• 
any non-study anti-cancer treatment 
commercial bevacizumab 
any experimental (biological or non-biological) therapy (within or outside a clinical study) 
In the SmPC for Avastin, monotherapy is recommended for NSCLC patients after combination treatment until 
disease progression or unwanted toxicity. Maintenance monotherapy post-treatment was not included. 
After the treatment phase, subjects then entered a follow-up period during which they were followed for 
disease progression and overall survival until one of the following: 
• 
consent was withdrawn, they were lost to follow-up, died, or had proscribed therapy (eg. commercial 
bevacizumab, non-study anticancer treatment), thus marking the end of study for that subject, or 
• 
the end of the clinical study, defined as the last subject’s completion of the treatment phase. 
Objectives 
The primary objective for this study was to compare the efficacy of ABP 215 with bevacizumab. The 
secondary objective was to assess the safety and immunogenicity of ABP 215 compared with bevacizumab, 
which are in accordance with the biosimilar approach. However, although not stated explicitly in the study 
objective, it is assumed, based on the statistical methodology, that the primary objective of the trial was to 
demonstrate biosimilarity between ABP 215 and bevacizumab.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy: 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the risk ratio (RR) of objective response rate (ORR), according to RECIST 
version 1.1, as assessed by the central, independent, blinded radiologist. The primary analysis of ORR was 
based on the ITT population, using data from the central, independent, blinded radiologists’ review. The pre-
specified equivalence margin for the primary endpoint (RR of ORR) was 0.67 to 1.5. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints were the RD of ORR, duration of response (DOR), and progression-free 
survival (PFS).  
Assessment report  
EMA/798844/2017 
Page 48/91 
  
  
Safety: 
The safety variables evaluated were incidence of adverse events, OS, changes in clinical laboratory tests and 
vital signs, and incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). 
Sample size 
Approximately 620 subjects overall (310 subjects per arm) were to be randomized. The sample size was 
chosen to achieve 95% power to demonstrate equivalence between ABP 215 and bevacizumab on the 
primary efficacy endpoint (risk ratio of ORR) with a margin of (0.67, 1.5) at a 2-sided significance level of 
0.05. It was assumed that the ORR would be approximately 38% (Botrel et al, 2011) in both the ABP 215 
and bevacizumab arms.

Statistical methods 
This was a comparative study designed to demonstrate clinical equivalence of ABP 215 and bevacizumab in 
adult subjects with NSCLC receiving first-line chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel. The study was 
designed to inferentially assess similarity between ABP 215 and bevacizumab with regard to ORR and to 
descriptively assess other endpoints. 
The primary study hypothesis was that there was no clinically meaningful difference between ABP 215 and 
bevacizumab for ORR. The hypothesis was tested by comparing the 2-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) of 
the risk ratio in ORR between ABP 215 and bevacizumab with an equivalence margin of (0.67, 1.5). A 
generalised linear model adjusted for the stratification factors was fitted using the SAS® procedure 
“GENMOD”. 
To assess the robustness of the primary ORR analysis results, the primary analysis was repeated using data 
from the central, independent, blinded radiologists’ review in the PP population and in the tumour response 
set.  
A sensitivity analysis was also performed including the following baseline covariates in the model, in addition 
to the randomization stratification factors: weight loss in the last 6 months, age group, stage IV/recurrent 
disease at baseline, race, smoking history, EGFR mutation status, and ALK status. 
The risk ratio for ORR was also examined in the subgroups as defined by baseline covariates (including 
geographic region, ECOG performance status, gender, etc…). 
The risk difference for ORR was calculated using a method analogous to that used for the risk ratio. The RD 
was summarised with 90% and 95% CIs for all of the analyses done for the risk ratio. A forest plot was 
created to summarize the variability in the RDs using 95% CIs across the subgroups. 
The non-inferiority margin of 12.5% was chosen based on a meta-analysis consisting of the 4 published, 
randomized bevacizumab studies in NSCLC cited in Botrel et al, 2011, and was chosen to be less than the 
Assessment report

lower bound of 95% CI for the risk difference of ORR, which is the smallest effect size that bevacizumab 
would be reliably expected to have compared with placebo.

Recruitment 
The phase 3 study was conducted at 101 sites (14 sites in the US, 11 in Russia, 10 in Australia, nine in 
Germany, eight in Poland, seven in Hungary, seven in Romania, six in Italy, six in Spain, five in Bulgaria, five 
in Greece, three in the Czech Republic, three in Mexico, three in Taiwan, two in the Netherlands, one in 
Canada, and one in Hong Kong). Russia, Taiwan and Hong Kong are countries outside the EU and the OECD 
mutual acceptance of data agreement. 
The first subject in study 20120265 was enrolled the 11th of November 2013, and last subject completed 
study the 23rd of July 2015. 
Conduct of the study 
A total of 642 subjects was included in the ITT analysis set (328 and 314 subjects were randomised to ABP 
215 and bevacizumab, respectively. 
One hundred two subjects (102; 15.9% randomised subjects; 58 [17.7%] and 44 [14.0%]) completed the 
study (i.e., were ongoing in active follow-up when the study was terminated). Reasons for ending the clinical 
study included death (related to adverse events or disease progression), protocol violations, lost to follow-up, 
physician decision, withdrawal of consent, plan to receive commercial bevacizumab or non-study anticancer 
therapy, decision by sponsor, or other.

STD = standard deviation. 
Not performed/not done = EGFR/ALK status not assessed. 
Patients with NSCLC expressing activating mutations in EGFRs or ALK translocations were included in the 
phase 3 study; receptor status assessment was not required at baseline. Recent clinical development of 
targeted drugs, e.g. monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), has dramatically changed 
cancer treatment, including treatment of NSCLC. Several TKIs have been approved for first line therapy of 
patients with metastatic NSCLC with activating mutations in EGFR and ALK, and are now standard therapy for 
this condition in Europe and other western countries. These patients are known to do less well with up front 
chemotherapy. Ideally, to reduce unbalanced arms and thereby uncertainty in the data, all patients should 
have been tested for EGFR and ALK mutations before entering the study; and patients positive for either of 
the mutation/rearrangement should have been be excluded. In addition, to avoid unbalanced enrolment of 
mutation-negative and mutation-unknown patients, the randomisation of patients harbouring either of these 
mutations should have been stratified. Therapies targeting the EGF-receptor mutations, were approved for 
first line use in metastatic NSCLC patients already in 2011. However, given that the advice from CHMP in 
2011 did not discuss this subject; the use of an adequate randomisation procedure when enrolling patients; 
and in addition, results are indicating similarity between the two products, the chosen strategy are 
considered acceptable. 
Numbers analysed 
All the randomised subjects were included in the ITT population. Of the randomised subjects, 633 subjects 
(98.6%; 324 [98.8%] and 309 subjects [98.4%] on ABP 215 and bevacizumab reference, respectively) 
received at least one dose of bevacizumab and were included in the safety analysis set. 
The PP population constituted approximately 86% of the ITT population.

Secondary endpoints: 
Risk difference for objective response rate 
Risk difference based on the central, independent, blinded radiologists’ review in the ITT population indicated 
that the 2 treatment arms were similar in the ITT population (RD = -2.90%; 90% CI: -9.26% to 3.45%; 
95% CI: -10.48% to 4.67%), in the PP population (RD = -2.82%; 90% CI: -9.73% to 4.10%; 95% CI: -
11.06% to 5.42%), in the tumour response set (RD = -2.78%; 90% CI: -9.27% to 3.71%; 95% CI: -
10.51% to 4.95%), in the ITT population when using the investigator’s assessment of response (RD = -
0.68%; 90% CI: -7.11% to 5.76%; 95% CI: -8.34% to 6.99%), and in the model with additional covariates, 
using the ITT population and the central response (RD = -3.24%; 90% CI: -9.54% to 3.05%; 95% CI: -

The risk ratio for ORR was also examined in the subgroups as defined by the stratification covariates 
geographic region (Eastern Europe vs Western Europe vs Asia Pacific/Other vs North America), ECOG 
performance status (0 vs 1), sex (men vs women) and a number of additional covariates: weight loss in the 
last 6 months, age group, stage IV/recurrent disease at baseline, race, smoking history, EGFR mutation 
status, and ALK status and ADA status.

Point estimate and 90% confidence interval of the risk ratio (ABP215/Bevacizumab) are estimated using a generalised 
linear model adjusted for the randomisation stratification factors geographic region, ECOG performance status, and sex. 
For subgroup analyses for each of the randomization stratification factors, the 2 remaining factors were adjusted for in the 
model. Two subjects who selected both White and Non-white races are included in the Non-white category for subgroup 
analyses. 
Figure 9: Forest Plot of Risk Ratio of ORR by Subgroup (Intent-to-treat Population) 
There are some considerable discrepancies in RR of ORR between the gender subgroups (Female RR of 0.79, 
90%CI: 0.62 to 1.01; Male RR of 1.04, 90%CI: 0.85 to 1.29) and between the ECOG subgroups (Grade 1 RR 
of 0.83, 90%CI: 0.68 to 1.02; Grade 2 RR of 1.09, 90%CI: 0.84 to 1.41).

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
In response to CHMP concerns that a loss of efficacy of 11% on the risk difference scale for ORR (95% CI: -
10.48% to 4.67% in ITT; 95% CI: -11.06% to 5.42% in PP) is clinically relevant, the applicant provided 
additional calculations of bevacizumab’s ORR based on historical trials from a meta-analysis by Botrel et al 
2011 to present the effect of ABP215 in a broader perspective.

Figure 10: ORR results from bevacizumab historical trials in subjects with NSCLC 
In order to assess the preservation of treatment effect, the applicant calculated the estimated proportion of 
bevacizumab’s effect retained by ABP 215 (along with a 95% CI). This calculation uses a method that 
incorporates (or synthesises) the variability of the estimate of bevacizumab’s effect relative to placebo and 
ABP 215’s effect relative to bevacizumab. Using this method (Rothmann et al, 2003; Snapinn and Qi, 2008), 
known as the synthesis method, it is estimated that ABP 215 preserves 83% (95% CI: 44%, 121%) of 
bevacizumab’s effect on the risk difference scale and 89% (95% CI: 57%, 118%) of bevacizumab’s effect on 
the risk ratio scale in the ITT population.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
A single pivotal, randomised, double-blind phase III study (20120265) was conducted in adult subjects with 
non-squamous NSCLC receiving first-line chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel to show similarity in 
efficacy, safety and immunogenicity between the proposed biosimilar ABP 215 and EU reference product 
Avastin. The patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either ABP 215 or the reference bevacizumab. 
The ABP 215 product batches used in the clinical studies can generally be considered representative for 
commercial production. 
All clinical studies were conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and 
were consistent with International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) “Guideline for Good Clinical Practice 
Assessment report  
EMA/798844/2017 
Page 62/91 
 
 
  
  
(GCP)” (ICH E6) as claimed by the applicant. The pivotal phase III efficacy study was conducted in 17 
countries of which seven were outside the EU. The Applicant has stated that clinical trials conducted with ABP 
215, carried out outside the European Union (EU), meet the ethical requirements of Directive 2001/20/EC, in 
accordance with Article 6 of Regulation 726/2004 and Article 8 (ib) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended.  
The chosen patient population of non-squamous NSCLC with the presence of stage IV or recurrent metastatic 
NSCLC with measurable disease according to modified Recist v1.1, is a homogenous population regarded as a 
sensitive target population for the purpose of establishing clinical similarity between ABP 215 and reference 
bevacizumab. Even if maintenance monotherapy with bevacizumab after the active treatment period is 
indicated in the Avastin SmPC, this was not included in the pivotal phase 3 study, as clearly stated by the 
Applicant.  
Patients with NSCLC expressing activating mutations in EGFRs or ALK translocations were included in the 
phase 3 study; receptor status assessment was not required at baseline. These patients are known to do less 
well with up front chemotherapy. Ideally, to reduce unbalanced arms and thereby uncertainty in the data, all 
patients should have been tested for EGFR and ALK mutations before entering the study; and patients 
positive for either of the mutation/rearrangement should have been excluded. In addition, to avoid 
unbalanced enrolment of mutation-negative and mutation-unknown patients, the randomisation of patients 
harbouring either of these mutations should have been stratified. Therapies targeting the EGF-receptor 
mutations were approved for first line use in metastatic NSCLC patients already in 2011. However, given that 
the advice from CHMP in 2011 did not discuss this subject; use of an adequate randomisation procedure 
when enrolling patients; and in addition, results are indicating similarity between the two products, the 
chosen strategy is considered acceptable. 
The primary endpoint was risk ratio (RR) of best overall response in the ITT population, and the duration of 
the active treatment (combination regimen) was about 19 weeks.  
ORR is considered acceptable as primary endpoint because ORR in NSCLC patients was the most sensitive 
endpoint observed throughout the original Avastin trials. 
The selected primary and secondary outcomes, their measurement time points as well as the pre-selected 
criteria for biosimilarity are mostly according to the CHMP scientific advice provided, as well as according to 
relevant CHMP guidelines for biosimilar clinical development.  
The inclusion and exclusion criteria used in the phase 3 study are according to the Avastin labelling and 
therefore considered adequate. The sample size calculations, randomisation and blinding procedures are also 
considered adequately performed.  
According to the Guideline on the choice of the non-inferiority margin (EMEA/CPMP/EWP/2158/99), the CHMP 
recommends 95% CI in an equivalence setting for proving biosimilarity. The applicant used the 95-95 
approach to derive a non-inferiority margin which is acceptable. 
The pre-specified equivalence margin for the primary endpoint (RR of ORR) was 0.67 to 1.5. The applicant 
based the margin on 12.5% for the risk difference in ORR between ABP 2015 and bevacizumab, which is less 
than the lower bound of 95% CI for the risk difference of ORR derived from a meta-analysis by Botrel et al 
(2011).  
RD of ORR in the PP population was presented in the dossier as one of the secondary end-points. The use of 
the PP population which is the most sensitive population, in the similarity calculations instead of the ITT 
population, is considered acceptable.

Patients were sampled for ADAs in approximately one year after randomisation; six months while on active 
combination treatment with potential suppressive chemotherapy and six months without any treatment.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
RR of ORR was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.77 to 1.12) and RD of ORR was -2.90 (95% CI: -10.48 to 4.67)]. Similarity 
between ABP 215 and EU-licensed bevacizumab reference product was demonstrated within the pre-specified 
equivalence margin (0.67, 1.5). The ORR of ABP215 from Study 265 does not deviate considerably from 
reference bevacizumab results in the previous trials. 
In order to more precisely define the primary endpoint and to reduce the masking of differences in the time 
points of best overall response, it was requested to provide ORR at week 19. The applicant was also 
requested to present a comparative analysis of response patterns over time showing the proportion of 
patients with a response at each time point. Results of the risk difference (RD) of ORR from the clinical phase 
3 study in NSCLC patients in both the ITT and PP population with 95% CI at week 19, as well as at week 
seven and 13, confirmed similarity between ABP 125 and reference bevacizumab. 
There was a difference in ORR RR between gender and ECOG subgroups which was greater for gender (RR of 
1.04 for male, 0.79 for women) than for ECOG subgroups (RR of 1.09 for PS0, 0.83 for PS1). During the 
procedure, the Applicant provided ORR per treatment arm separately for women and men, and separately for 
ECOG PS. The proportion of males and females in the ABP215 group achieving ORR was balanced and the 
difference in RR between genders is driven by the denominator (i.e proportion of women in the bevacizumab 
arm achieving ORR). It is acknowledged that such deviation in the bevacizumab arm might have arrived by 
chance, especially given the large number of subgroups studied. It is also noted that although point 
estimates deviate from 1, the confidence intervals from the subgroups overlap with the confidence interval of 
the overall effect. 
Both the secondary outcomes (PFS, duration of response, tumour burden) and the different sensitivity 
analyses (investigator assessment) were in line with the primary outcome, supporting the biosimilarity claim 
between ABP 215 and reference product bevacizumab shown by RR of ORR in the ITT population (primary 
analysis) and also by RD of ORR in the PP population.   
ABP 215 is convincingly demonstrated to be a biosimilar to the bevacizumab reference product is through 
efficacy comparability studies. The Applicant is claiming the same indications for ABP 215 as granted for the 
originator Avastin. Since the mechanisms of action are the same, inhibition of tumour vessel growth is 
expected to be similar across all currently approved cancer indications, extrapolation to all other currently 
approved indications labelled for the reference product bevacizumab is considered acceptable. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Similarity between ABP 215 and EU-licensed bevacizumab reference product was demonstrated in the ITT 
and PP population, with RR of ORR within the pre-specified equivalence margin (0.67, 1.5). Equivalence 
between ABP 215 and reference bevacizumab was also shown by RD of ORR in the ITT and PP population. 
Extrapolation to all other indications labelled for the reference product bevacizumab is considered acceptable, 
given the relevance of the same mechanism of action across indications.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
A total of 835 subjects received at least one dose of ABP 215 or bevacizumab (US or EU) IV either as healthy 
subjects in the phase 1, single-dose clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) study (Study 20110216) or in the phase 3 
active-controlled, randomized, double-blind, study of ABP 215 compared with bevacizumab in subjects with 
advanced NSCLC (Study 20120265). These subjects comprise the safety population. 
Pharmacokinetic Similarity Studies in Healthy Subjects - Study 20110216 
A phase 1, single-dose clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) study in healthy subjects. Exposure to investigational 
product was comparable across the treatment groups; 68 received ABP 215, 67 received bevacizumab (US), 
and 67 received bevacizumab (EU).  
Phase 3 Controlled Clinical Study - Study 20120265 
An active-controlled, randomized, double-blind, phase 3 study of ABP 215 compared with bevacizumab in 
subjects with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The median number of doses 
administered in both the ABP 215 and bevacizumab treatment groups were six.  
The end of treatment was at week 19 [+7 days] and it should be noted that no adverse events was recorded 
during the follow-up phase (after week 19 [+7 days]) except serious adverse events (SAEs) ongoing at the 
time of the end-of-study visit which will be followed until they resolve or are considered chronic or stable.  
The majority of subjects (191 [59.0%] for ABP 215 and 202 [65.4%] for bevacizumab) received 6 doses; 1 
subject in the ABP 215 group received 7 doses. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) cumulative total dose of 
investigational product was 71.3 (26.32) mg/kg for ABP 215 and 74.8 (24.22) mg/kg for bevacizumab.  
For paclitaxel and carboplatin subjects were to receive at least 4 cycles of each treatment and no more than 
6 cycles with median number of doses administered in both groups being 5.  
From the data provided, exposure to the IP and non-IP appears generally comparable across the treatment 
groups.

•  Disposition of the Study population 
Study 20110216 
One hundred ninety-one subjects overall (94.6%) completed the study; 11 (5.4%) subjects discontinued the 
study early. The reason for discontinuation for the majority of these subjects was either withdrawal by the 
subject (4 subjects, 2.0%) or lost to follow-up (3 subjects, 1.5%).  
Study 20120265 
59.3% (192 subjects) and 65.4% (202 subjects), respectively, completed treatment. The most common 
reasons for discontinuing investigational product across both treatment groups were adverse events (77 
[12.2%] subjects) and disease progression (78 [12.3%] subjects); the incidence was similar between

groups. Investigational product was discontinued as a result of death for 4.0% (13) subjects in the ABP 215 
group and 3.6% (11) subjects in the bevacizumab group. 
The percentage of subjects who completed the study was similar between treatment groups (85.2% for ABP 
215 and 88.3% for bevacizumab). However, it should be noted that considerably fewer patients in the ABP 
215 group (13.6%) plan to receive commercial bevacizumab as compared to the reference group 21.7%). 
Adverse events 
Study 20110216 
In this phase 1 study where a single-dose of ABP 215 or bevacizumab was given, 47.0% of subjects overall 
reported at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). The majority of these events were assessed 
as grade 1 or 2 (mild to moderate). There were no deaths, SEAs, or TEAEs leading to discontinuation of the 
study. 
No major safety concerns or signals were identified in this single dose study. However, of notice, more TEAEs 
were reported in the ABP 215 and bevacizumab (EU) treatment groups (EU sourced bevacizumab carried out 
at EU site) compared with the ABP 215 and bevacizumab (US) treatment group (US sourced bevacizumab 
carried out at US site). In relation to this and in order to better understand these site differences the 
Applicant did a post hoc analysis of the TEAEs by study site. This analysis shows that the frequency, type and 
severity of TEAEs were similar within each site: In the US site TEAEs was reported in 37.1% (13 subjects) in 
the ABP 215 group and 32.8% (22 subjects) in the bevacizumab (US) group; the subject incidence for the EU 
site was 57.6% (19 subjects) for ABP 215 and 61.2% (41 subjects) for bevacizumab (EU). It was concluded 
that the differences in adverse event rates between sites are likely due to types of adverse events reported in 
different geographic locations in an otherwise healthy population.

Study 20120265 
Overall, the majority of subjects (597 subjects; 94.3%) reported at least 1 TEAE (Table 24). In the ABP 215 
group, the subject incidence was 95.1% (308 subjects, 2,643 events) and in the bevacizumab group the 
subject incidence was 93.5% (289 subjects, 2,712 events). For approximately half of these subjects (276 
subjects, 43.6% overall), the severity of at least one TEAEs was grade 3 or higher.

EOI were not analysed.  
Study 20120265 
The prespecified EOIs were derived based on the MOA and clinical data available in prescribing information 
for the reference product (Avastin).  
The incidence of any EOI in the ABP 215 and bevacizumab treatment were 76.2% and 74.1%, respectively. The 
most frequently reported EOIs grade ≥ 3 were neutropenia and infections (16.7% for ABP 215 and 15.2% for 
bevacizumab), infusion reaction (9.6% and 6.8%, respectively), and hypertension (6.8% and 5.5%, 
respectively).

Infusion Reaction Adverse Events 
In both groups, hypertension (ABP 215: 15.7%, bevacizumab: 13.3%) and myalgia (12.0% and 14.2%, 
respectively) were reported most frequently. Events that were grade 4 in the ABP 215 were respiratory 
failure in 2 subjects and respiratory distress in 1 subject; in the bevacizumab group, the grade 4 event was 
hypertension and the grade 5 event was sudden death.

Pulmonary Haemorrhage Adverse Events 
4.3% (14 subjects) in the ABP 215 treatment group and 3.2% (10 subjects) in the bevacizumab treatment 
group were identified with pulmonary haemorrhage TEAEs; these events were reported as “haemoptysis” for 
all subjects but 2, which were reported as “pulmonary haemorrhage” (bevacizumab treatment group). Across 
all the pulmonary haemorrhage TEAEs, the events for 3 subjects in the ABP 215 group and 6 subjects in the

the bevacizumab treatment group with arterial thromboembolic TEAEs; all events occurred in <1% of 
subjects in either group. Also, all of the arterial thromboembolic TEAEs were serious in both treatment 
groups, and the events were fatal (grade 5) for 2 subjects in the ABP 215 treatment group.  
•  Gastrointestinal perforation adverse events 
The standard search identified 0.9% (3 subjects) in the ABP 215 group and 1.3% (4 subjects) in the 
bevacizumab group with GI perforation TEAEs. Across all of the GI perforation TEAEs, the events were 
serious for 2 subjects in the ABP 215 group (grade 5 for 1 subject) and serious for all 4 subjects in the 
bevacizumab group (none were grade 5). 
•  Congestive heart failure adverse events 
Two subjects in the ABP 215 treatment group and 1 subject in the bevacizumab with one or more congestive 
heart failure TEAEs were identified. For 1 subject in each group, the events were serious and grade 5. 
•  Non-gastrointestinal fistula formation adverse events 
Two subjects in the ABP 215 treatment group and 2 subjects in the bevacizumab treatment group were 
identified with one or more non-GI fistula formation TEAEs. For 1 subject in the ABP 215 group, the event

bevacizumab group), and rectal haemorrhage (2 subjects [0.6 %] in the ABP 215 group). All other events 
occurred in 1 subject in a single treatment group. 
On review of the individual case narratives in the CSR:  
•  4 fatal TEAEs were reported as related to the IP - 2 in the ABP 215 group (Intestinal perforation and 
Rectal Haemorrhage) and 2 in the bevacizumab group (Haemoptysis and Bronchial fistula). 
•  2 fatal TEAEs were reported as related to the IP, paclitaxel and carboplatin – 2 in the ABP 215 group 
(Rectal haemorrhage and Ischaemic cerebral infarction). 
•  1 fatal TEAE was reported as related to paclitaxel and carboplatin in the ABP 215 treatment group 
(thrombocytopenia). 
•  The remaining 17 fatal TEAEs were reported as not related to the IP, paclitaxel or carboplatin. 
The incidence of any fatal TEAE due to disease progression was 4 (1.2%) subjects in the ABP 215 treatment

Laboratory findings 
Study 20110216 
Overall, the profile of laboratory abnormalities was similar across treatment groups. However, three healthy 
volunteers experienced TEAEs of abnormal LFTs, all subjects were in the ABP 215 arm. Abnormal LFTs are 
not a listed ADR for bevacizumab and no signal was identified in the clinical efficacy/safety study in patients 
with NSCLC.  
For two cases, it seems likely the results were exercise induced and these asymptomatic cases resolved 
before the end of the study without medical intervention. For the last subject, the event had not resolved at 
the time the subject withdrew from the study, he was found to have a positive Hepatitis A IgG result but IgM 
was negative. Abnormal LFTs are not a listed ADR for bevacizumab and no signal was identified in the much 
larger clinical efficacy/safety study in patients with NSCLC who received multiple higher doses of 
bevacizumab compared with the single dose in the healthy volunteer study. The cause of these results in this 
single subject remains unclear and the subject was lost to follow-up.

All clinically significant (grade ≥ 3) subjects with postbaseline haematology and serum chemistry results are

White (leukocytes and neutrophils) and red (haemoglobin and haematocrit) blood cell parameters and 
platelets all decreased approximately 10% to 25% over the course of treatment. The decreases were similar 
in both the ABP 215 and bevacizumab group except for the decrease in median platelet, which was greater in 
the ABP 215 group than in the bevacizumab group.  
The majority of subject incidences listed in Error! Reference source not found. were grade 3 events. Two 
(0.6%) subjects in both ABP 215 and bevacizumab had grade 4 decreases in leukocytes. Eleven (3.4%) and 
5 subjects (1.6%) on ABP 215 and bevacizumab, respectively, had grade 4 decreases in neutrophils. One

Immunological events 
All samples from the PK similarity study in healthy subjects (Study 20110216) were screened for binding 
ADAs using a validated 2-tiered immunoassay approach (screening assay and specificity assay; see 
assessment of the assays under Pharmacokinetics and Methods above). Only two samples were collected 
from each patient, at baseline and at day 85, end-of study. Evaluations of immunogenicity were also 
conducted in the phase 3 safety and efficacy study (20120265), using the same methodology as that used in 
the PK similarity study. All binding ADA-positive samples were to be assessed for neutralising antibodies 
using a target binding assay.  
In the phase 3 study (20120265), patients were sampled for ADAs in the end of each treatment cycle, 
together with pharmacokinetic sampling; baseline, week 7, week 13 and week 19. 
 Two validated assays, subject to resolution of outstanding issues, were used to detect the presence of anti-
ABP 215 antibodies. All available protocol-specified samples were first tested in an electro-
chemiluminescence (ECL)-based bridging immunoassay to detect antibodies capable of binding to ABP 215 
(Binding Antibody Assay). Samples confirmed to be positive for binding antibodies were subsequently tested 
in a non-cell based target binding assay to determine neutralising activity against ABP 215 (Neutralising 
Antibody Assay). If a post-dose sample was positive for binding antibodies and demonstrated neutralising 
activity at the same time point, the sample was defined as positive for neutralising antibodies. 
•  Anti-drug Antibodies  
In the pivotal PK study, a total of 199 subjects were tested for anti-ABP 215 antibodies. There were no pre-
existing ADAs detected in baseline blood samples for either treatment group, and no subjects tested positive 
for binding ADAs after end-of study. No differences in anti-ABP 215 antibody rates were observed across 
groups treated with ABP 215, Bevacizumab (US), or Bevacizumab (EU). If present in the sample, drug 
concentration in all tested antibody samples was below the levels which may interfere with the detection of 
anti-ABP 215 binding antibodies in the immunoassay. 
In the safety and efficacy study, the overall incidence of developing binding ADAs at week 19, after end-of 
combination treatment, first phase of the study, was 1.9% (1.4% [4 subjects] for ABP 215 and 2.5% [7 
subjects] for bevacizumab); i.e. four out of 294 (1.4%) evaluable subjects in the ABP 215 arm and 7 out of 
284 (2.5%) evaluable subjects in the bevacizumab arm developed binding ADAs on study. Three subjects 
(1% and 1.1%) in each arm developed transient ADAs, meaning the results on ADAs were negative at the 
subject’s last time point tested within the study period. No subject in either treatment arm tested positive for 
neutralising antibodies. Results from isolated samples were presented to support the assertion that the risk of 
false negative tests for ADA was low; further assays of the end of study (EOS) samples for ADA were 
performed to mitigate the risk of false negatives. EOS sera were tested for ADA by standard protocol from 95 
of 102 subjects, (ABP 215 = 49, bevacizumab = 46). One (subject 26551001019, bevacizumab group) of 95 
subjects tested was positive for binding ADA and negative for neutralizing ADA after EOT.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Study 20120265 
A higher number of patients discontinued carboplatin and/or paclitaxel because of adverse events on ABP 215 
compared to bevacizumab [74 (22.8%) vs 59 subjects (19.1%), respectively]. The types and frequencies of 
adverse events leading to chemotherapy dose reductions were similar on ABP 215 and bevacizumab.

N/A 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
A total of 835 subjects were treated with one or more doses of ABP 215 or bevacizumab in two clinical 
studies; a single-dose phase 1 study (study 20110216) in healthy male subjects and an active-controlled, 
randomized, double-blind, phase 3 study (study 20120265) of ABP 215 compared with bevacizumab in 
subjects with advanced non-squamous NSCLC. The number of subjects is considered sufficient to study 
safety signals in this comparability exercise.  
Assessment report  
EMA/798844/2017 
Page 80/91 
 
  
  
In the phase 1 study a single dose of 3-mg/kg intravenous (IV) was administered and 15 mg/kg every 3 
weeks (Q3W) for 6 treatment cycles was administered in the phase 3 study. Thus, fewer TEAEs are expected 
in the single dose phase 1 study as compared to the phase 3 study.  
In the phase 1 study more TEAEs were reported in the ABP 215 (57.6%) and bevacizumab (EU) (61.2%) 
treatment groups (EU sourced bevacizumab carried out at EU site) compared with the ABP 215 (37.1%) and 
bevacizumab (US) (32.8%) treatment group (US sourced bevacizumab carried out at US site). However, the 
frequency, type and severity of TEAEs were similar within each site supporting biosimilarity. In the pivotal 
phase 3 study the end of treatment was defined at week 19 [+7 days] and it should be noted that adverse 
events were not monitored during the follow-up phase (after end-of-treatment; week 19 [+7 days]), except 
SAEs ongoing at the time of the end-of-study visit which will be followed until they resolve or are considered 
chronic or stable. An end of treatment at week 19 [+7 days], after 6 cycles of combination therapy, is 
considered to be on the short side in order investigate and register safety signals.Most of the safety signals 
for bevacizumab have been recorded during the combination phase (in the early cycles) and hence the 
monitoring period should be sufficient to uncover safety signals. However, it should be stressed that patients 
are immunosuppressed when on chemotherapy. Thus, continuation with monotherapy would have been 
preferable in this study as this could potentially have uncovered chemotherapy suppressed immunogenicity 
signals (and related safety events). 
In both the ABP 215 and bevacizumab treatment groups of the phase 3 study, exposure to investigational 
product, paclitaxel, and carboplatin was generally similar, but a higher number of subjects receiving two 
doses in the ABP 215 as compared to the bevacizumab group for all treatments (37 subjects vs 19 subjects 
for the investigational product exposure, 39 subjects vs 20 subjects for the paclitaxel exposure and 37 
subjects vs 19 subjects for the carboplatin exposure, respectively) were reported. In total, discontinuation of 
investigational product due to a TEAE was similar between the two groups with (18.8% in the ABP 215 
treatment group compared to 17.2% in the bevacizumab treatment group). Of notice, a slightly higher 
number of patients discontinued carboplatin and/or paclitaxel because of adverse events (21.0% and 16.8% 
in the ABP 215 and bevacizumab group, respectively). These slight differences between the two treatment 
groups are considered not to have any clinical impact. 
In general, the number, type, and severity of TEAEs in the two groups of the pivotal study phase 3 are 
similar and in line with the safety profile for bevacizumab. Importantly, no new safety signals or safety 
patterns were reported for ABP 215. Also, the incidence of subjects experiencing any AE were similar in the 
two groups (95.1% in the ABP 215 group, and 93.5% in the bevacizumab group). For approximately half of 
these subjects (42.9% in the ABP 215 group, and 44.3% in the bevacizumab group), the severity of at least 
one TEAE was grade 3 or higher. The largest differences (≥5%) between the two groups were detected for 
nausea (25.6% in the ABP 215 group and 30.7% in the bevacizumab group) and diarrhoea (13.0% in the 
ABP 215 group and 18.1%, in the bevacizumab group), but as no events were serious this is considered 
acceptable. 
There were 24 deaths, 13 (4.0 %) in the ABP 215 treatment group and 11 (3.6 %) in the bevacizumab 
treatment group in the phase 3 study. Most of these were events that occurred in one single patient with no 
pattern revealed, hence they are considered acceptable given the well-known safety profile of the reference 
product. The fatal events that occurred in more than one subject in a single treatment groups by preferred 
term were related to bleeding (5 subjects in the ABP 215 arm versus 2 in the bevacizumab arm). Overall, 
these numbers are considered acceptable with no new AE patterns revealed. Also, on review of the individual 
case narratives: 4 fatal TEAEs were reported as related to the IP, 2 in each treatment group; 2 fatal TEAEs 
were reported as related to the IP, paclitaxel and carboplatin, both in the ABP 215 group; and 1 fatal TEAE 
Assessment report  
EMA/798844/2017 
Page 81/91 
  
  
was reported as related to paclitaxel and carboplatin in the ABP 215 group. The remaining 17 fatal TEAEs 
were reported as not related to the IP, paclitaxel or carboplatin. The incidence of any fatal TEAE due to 
disease progression was 4 (1.2%) subjects in the ABP 215 treatment group and 2 (0.6%) subjects in the 
bevacizumab treatment group. 
The number of patients that developed ADAs was low in the phase 3 study; 7 and 4 patients in the 
bevacizumab and ABP215 groups, respectively. Overall, the results obtained for clinical laboratory 
parameters were similar between the ABP 215 and bevacizumab groups with no major concerns in safety 
signals. The variations between the ABP 215 and the bevacizumab group on the haematology parameters, in 
particular the difference in neutrophils (25 [7.7%] and 12 subjects [3.9%] on ABP 215 and bevacizumab, 
respectively) are noteworthy. Still, no difference between the two groups was reported for the TEAE of 
neutropenia (18.5% [60 subjects] for ABP 215 and 19.7% [61 subjects] for bevacizumab), leukopenia (7.1% 
[23 subjects] and 7.4% [23 subjects], respectively). For febrile neutropenia the differences are considered 
minor (4% [13 subjects] for ABP 215 and 2.6% [8 subjects] for bevacizumab). Based on this, these 
differences in neutrophils are considered not to be of concern. The median platelet values for subjects in the 
ABP 215 and bevacizumab group were similar at baseline, and by week 19 median decreases from baseline 
were greater in the ABP 215 group (-109.50 x 109/L) than in the bevacizumab group (-76.00 x 109/L). 
However, these differences are not considered to be of clinical concern. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The number and type of TEAEs were comparable between ABP 215 and bevacizumab, and from a safety and 
immunogenicity point of view biosimilarity between ABP 215 and the reference product Avastin has been 
shown.  
The clinical safety information under sections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8 of the Avastin SmPC applies also to Mvasi.

Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
Assessment report  
EMA/798844/2017 
Page 86/91 
  
  
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Mvasi has been developed as a biosimilar of bevacizumab using Avastin as a reference medicinal product. The 
indications applied for are treatment of patients with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum; metastatic 
breast cancer; metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); metastatic renal cell 
carcinoma; metastatic cervical cancer; and epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. 
3.1.2.  Main clinical studies 
A PK study was performed in healthy subjects and the primary objective was to demonstrate bioequivalence 
of ABP 215 relative to EU-sourced, as well as US-sourced Avastin (bevacizumab) following a 3 mg/ kg body 
weight single i.v. injection.  
A phase 3 study for the efficacy and safety comparison of ABP 215 with the reference product bevacizumab, 
including monitoring of immunogenicity, was submitted by the Applicant. This was a randomised, double-
blind, active-controlled study in adult subjects with non-squamous NSCLC receiving first-line chemotherapy 
with carboplatin and paclitaxel in addition to ABP 215 and bevacizumab, respectively, for 6 cycles. The 
primary endpoint was risk ratio (RR) of ORR in the ITT population and secondary endpoints were RD of ORR, 
duration of response and PFS. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The purpose of this application is to demonstrate similarity of ABP 215 to the reference product bevacizumab. 
Thus, there is no requirement to demonstrate benefit to the patient per se as this has been shown for the 
reference product. The biosimilarity approach has been assessed from a quality, non-clinical, pharmacokinetic 
and clinical perspective, and the conclusion is based upon the totality of the submitted data. 
From a quality and non-clinical perspective, data has been presented supporting that ABP 215 can be 
considered a biosimilar to the bevacizumab reference product.  
From a pharmacokinetic perspective, bioequivalence has been demonstrated between ABP 215 and 
bevacizumab (Avastin). The primary endpoints (i.e. AUClast, AUCinf and Cmax) with their 90% confidence 
intervals are well within the predefined acceptance range of 80-125%. 
The geometric LS means ratios for the comparison of ABP 215 and EU sourced Avastin for AUClast, AUCinf and 
Cmax were 1.03, 0.96 and 0.96 and the corresponding 90%CIs [0.982-1.080], [0.916-1.006], [0.920-1.004], 
respectively. 
Assessment report  
EMA/798844/2017 
Page 87/91 
 
  
  
From a pharmacokinetic perspective, ABP 215 can be considered similar to the bevacizumab reference 
product. 
•  From a Clinical perspective 
A phase 3 study in advanced NSCLC has been performed aiming at showing similarity in efficacy, safety and 
immunogenicity between the proposed biosimilar ABP 215 and EU-licensed Avastin. The primary efficacy 
endpoint was the risk ratio (RR) of objective response rate (ORR) in the ITT population, according to RECIST 
version 1.1, as assessed by the central, independent, blinded radiologist. 95% CI for RR and risk difference 
(RD) of ORR in the ITT population [ABP 215/bevacizumab, RR of ORR was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.77 to 1.12); RD 
of ORR was -2.90 (95% CI: -10.48 to 4.67)] were within the pre-specified equivalence margin (0.67, 1.5 and 
12.5%) and indicated similarity between ABP 215 and bevacizumab reference product).  
Similarity was also shown by RR and RD of ORR in the per protocol (PP) population (secondary analysis of the 
primary endpoint), within the predefined boundaries for equivalence of 0.67 to 1.5 for RR based on 12.5% for 
the risk difference [RR of ORR: 0.94 (95% CI: 0.78 to1.13) and RD of ORR: -2.82% (95% CI: -11.06% to 
5.42%)]. 
The results of the secondary efficacy endpoints were also similar between the two treatment arms (ITT 
population: DOR medians of 5.8 for ABP 215 (95% CI: 4.9 to 7.7 months) and 5.6 months for bevacizumab 
(95% CI: 5.1 to 6.3 months); PFS medians were 6.6 for ABP 215 (95% CI: 6.3 to 7.9 months) and 7.9 
months for bevacizumab (95% CI: 6.6 to 8.2 months).   
Several sensitivity analyses (e.g. based on investigator’s assessment or other patient populations) also 
support similarity between ABP 215 and the reference product bevacizumab.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
No uncertainties remain on the favourable effects.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall, the safety profile for the biosimilar ABP 215 is comparable to the reference product Avastin during 
the treatment period of 19 weeks [+7 days] with combination therapy, both in terms of TEAE, SAEs, deaths, 
discontinuation of treatment due to AEs and laboratory findings. 
The ADA-positive rates after 19 weeks (end-of-treatment) were zero for ABP 215 and the reference 
bevacizumab in the pivotal PK study, and low for both in the safety and efficacy study (4 and 6 patients with 
ADAs at week 19 in the ABP 215 group and Avastin group, respectively). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The phase 3 efficacy and safety study was not continued with monotherapy of ABP 215 or bevacizumab after 
the six cycles with combination therapy, and safety signals are thereby not available for the final phase of the 
study (follow-up). As patients are immunosuppressed when on chemotherapy, this may supress the 
production of ADAs, and also related adverse events. Thus, preferably, patients should have continued on 
monotherapy in the follow-up phase until end-of study as they are more prone to develop ADAs in a state 
when they only receive investigational products (bevacizumab) and chemotherapy has been ended. 
Assessment report  
EMA/798844/2017 
Page 88/91 
  
  
However based on the totality of the safety data submitted, there are no new safety signals, hence the safety 
profile of ABP 215 is considered adequate. 
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The totality of results collected from the quality, non-clinical data, pharmacokinetics and clinical studies 
supports similarity between ABP 215 and the reference product bevacizumab. 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Since the similarity of ABP 215 to the bevacizumab reference product was convincingly demonstrated through 
comparability studies both at the quality, non-clinical and clinical level the benefit – risk for Mvasi follows the 
benefit-risk balance for the reference product bevacizumab (Avastin) and is positive. 
3.6.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of MVASI is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Mvasi is not similar to Lynparza, Torisel, Yondelis and Zejula 
within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Mvasi is favourable in the following indications: 
MVASI in combination with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy is indicated for treatment of adult patients 
with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum. 
MVASI in combination with paclitaxel is indicated for first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic 
breast cancer. For further information as to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, please 
refer to section 5.1. 
MVASI, in addition to platinum-based chemotherapy, is indicated for first-line treatment of adult patients with 
unresectable advanced, metastatic or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly 
squamous cell histology.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for roflumilast, the scientific conclusions 
of CHMP are as follows:  
Cumulative 35 cases containing at least one event from the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
High Level Term (MedDRA HLT), Panic attacks and disorders have been retrieved for roflumilast. 
Overall, it is not possible to exclude a causal relationship between roflumilast and the development of 
panic attack due to nearly 50% reported dechallenge positive and the time to onset was plausible in 
most (80%) of the cases. In COPD controlled clinical trials 4 out of 5766 subjects who received 
roflumilast experienced a TEAE of panic attack. Therefore, panic attack should be included in the 
product information with a frequency rare. 
Therefore, in view of available data regarding roflumilast, the PRAC considered that changes to the 
product information were warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for roflumilast the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal products containing roflumilast is favourable subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The applied indication for Opdualag was for the first-line treatment of advanced (unresectable or 
metastatic) melanoma in adults and adolescents (12 years and older and weighing at least 40 kg). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
Melanoma, a form of skin cancer, is the 6th most common cause of cancer in Europe with an estimated 
144,209 new cases, and more than 25,000 deaths, annually. The European annual incidence of 
malignant melanoma varies from 3–5/100.000 in Mediterranean countries to 12–35/100.000 in Nordic 
countries, whereas it can reach over 50/100.000 in Australia or New Zealand. The incidence of 
melanoma has been rising steadily over the last 40 years, with a trend towards stabilisation of 
mortality, except in elderly males1. Melanoma incidence peaks at 65 years, though any age can be 
affected2. While rare in the adolescent population, the incidence of melanoma rises sharply to over 10 
per million in the second decade, and 15–19-year-old account for between 70% and 80% of all 
melanoma cases diagnosed in individuals < 20 years of age3,4. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
Most melanomas arise as superficial, indolent tumours that are confined to the epidermis, where they 
remain for several years. At some point, probably in response to the stepwise accumulation of genetic 
abnormalities, the melanoma is transformed into an expansile nodule that extends beyond the biologic 
boundary of the basement membrane and invades the dermis. Frequently observed mutations in order 
of decreasing frequency are BRAF, RAS and NF15. Melanoma is a heterogeneous and complex disease 
with various clinical factors and molecular defects playing a key role in outcomes. Cutaneous 
melanoma is by far the most common melanoma subtype, accounting for in excess of 90% of cases of 
melanoma6. Approximately 50% of cutaneous melanomas bear an oncogenic driver mutation in the 
BRAF gene which is associated with a worse prognosis. Mutation testing for actionable mutations is 
mandatory in patients with resectable or unresectable stage III or stage IV. In addition to the 
mutational status, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, reported as the percentage of 
positive tumour cells, can be useful to assess and record for all resectable or unresectable stage III 
and IV

2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Metastatic melanoma can spread to bone, lung, central nervous system (CNS), liver and skin. It can 
lead to pain, neurologic sequelae including chord compression and nerve impingement, haemorrhage, 
and laboratory abnormalities. Generalised effects of metastatic disease also include cachexia, 
thrombotic and embolic events, and infections. Clinical factors associated with poor survival include 
elevated LDH, visceral metastases (notably liver and brain), multiple metastatic sites, and poor 
performance status7. These are negative prognostic and predictive markers for both targeted and 
immunotherapies. 
The eighth version of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging and classification 
system, which includes sentinel node staging, is the preferred classification system8. The target 
population is confined to unresectable stage III (regional metastatic) and stage IV (distinct metastatic) 
melanoma.  
The prognosis of metastatic melanoma was extremely poor (5-year survival rate of 25% between 
2009-2015) until the advent of targeted and immuno-therapies which have dramatically changed the 
treatment paradigm.  
Both strategies have shown markedly improved survival compared with the use of chemotherapy 
regimens. The initial approval of ipilimumab (Yervoy) in 2011, increased the median OS for patients 
from 6 - 9 months to 19.9 months. Since then, 2 checkpoint inhibitors (nivolumab, pembrolizumab) 
targeting the PD-1 pathway further extended the median OS to > 30 months and incurring a lower 
frequency and severity of side effects. Further benefit was realised with the addition of ipilimumab to 
nivolumab, with the combination demonstrating an unprecedented 5-year OS rate of 52% and more 
recently, a 6.5 year OS rate of 49% for patients with advanced melanoma, though toxicity was higher 
with the combination9,10.  
In addition to immunotherapy, treatment options for patients with BRAF mutated melanoma include 
targeted BRAF/MEK combination therapies. While these agents are effective in a high proportion of 
patients with BRAF mutated disease, most patients acquire resistance over time.  
Despite progress in its current treatment and management, there is still a considerable proportion of 
patients who fail to respond to these therapies or respond but then later relapse. There are no 
standard approaches to treating patients once progresses after receiving anti-PD-1 therapy. An 
analysis of real-world Flatiron Health data (2014 - 2019) revealed that over 40% of BRAF mutant and 
60% of BRAF wild-type patients did not initiate a new treatment after disease progression on anti-PD-
1, highlighting an unmet need to identify effective and tolerable therapies in this setting11.

The current first-line standard of care treatments for unresectable stage III/IV are PD-1 blockade 
(nivolumab, pembrolizumab), PD-1 blockade (nivolumab) combined with cytotoxic T lymphocyte 
associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) blockade (ipilimumab) and, in addition for BRAFV600-mutated 
melanoma, B-Raf proto-oncogene (BRAF) inhibition (vemurafenib, dabrafenib, encorafenib) combined 
with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibition (cobimetinib, trametinib, binimetinib).  
First-line decision between targeted therapies or immuno-therapies is currently being studied in 
prospective trials (SECOMBIT, NCT02631447) to define the best sequencing combination treatment in 
terms of OS, the primary efficacy variable. No direct randomised comparison exists between the two 
approaches, but meta-analyses suggest that, despite better out-come within the first 12 months for 
targeted therapies, immuno-therapy patients may have a better survival after 1 year. Patients for 
whom immunotherapy can be delivered safely for the first few months, i.e. patients with tumours not 
progressing very quickly and not immediately threatening an important organ or function, should be 
considered for immunotherapy first, preserving targeted therapies for the subsequent lines.

3) human Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody, and nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 human IgG4 
monoclonal antibody. 
Relatlimab binds selectively to LAG-3 with high affinity and potently blocks ligand binding thereby 
stimulating enhanced in vitro antigen-specific T-cell responses and cytokine signalling and promoting 
anti-tumour immunity. Nivolumab binds selectively and with high affinity to PD-1 and potently blocks 
binding to PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby inhibiting PD-1 pathway-mediated suppression of anti-tumour 
immunity. 
The dual blockade of LAG-3 and PD-L1 is supported by co-expression on immune cells and both 
inhibitory receptors playing a role in immune-escape by tumours. Dual inhibition of LAG-3 and PD-1 in 
the preclinical setting elicited enhanced anti-tumour immune response and demonstrated synergistic 
anti-tumour activity through blocking two distinct immune checkpoint pathways.

Scientific Advice 
CHMP scientific advice (SA) on the clinical development was given on 30 January 2020 
(EMA/H/SA/4345/1/2019/II) and a follow-up advice on 28 May 2020 
(EMEA/H/SA/4345/1/FU/1/2020/II).

the clinically meaningful efficacy, with an acceptable safety profile, in a well-defined population 
in study CA224047 would be sufficient to allow for a benefit/risk assessment of relatlimab plus 
nivolumab for the treatment of untreated, unresectable or advanced metastatic melanoma. 
The CHMP agreed that there is a need for new drugs and combination strategies in the target 
population and supported the investigation in the first line setting. The overall study design was 
supported, including the interim PFS efficacy analysis and the proposed study population. PFS was 
considered an acceptable primary endpoint, provided mature OS data excluding a negative effect were 
available and the effect was homogenous across sub-populations. It was recommended that analyses 
were delayed to allow reaching at least 50% maturity in all subgroups. The dose for 
relatlimab/nivolumab was considered acceptable and the nivolumab monotherapy comparator arm 
(480 mg Q4W) was agreed. A follow-up advice was strongly suggested once more information on the 
biomarker plan was available. 
Brief summary EMA/H/SA/4345/1/FU/1/2020/II: 
The applicant received follow-up SA on the development of Nivolumab, Relatlimab for treatment of 
advanced melanoma from the CHMP on 28 May 2020 (EMEA/H/SA/4345/1/FU/1/2020/II). The SA 
pertained to the following clinical aspects: 
1.  Introduction of an additional interim analysis (IA2) of PFS for study CA224047 
2.  Proposed to move OS to the first secondary endpoint in the statistical hierarchy 
The CHMP discouraged to perform the proposed PFS IA2 (minimum 80% planned PFS events), planned 
to occur 3 months before the final PFS. The benefits of introducing this unplanned interim analysis, 
resulting in few weeks of anticipation of the readings of the PFS results, did not seem to outweigh the 
risks of hampering a proper assessment of the outcome in the various subgroup of interest, whose 
importance was clearly stated in the previous CHMP advice. The proposal to move OS to the first of the 
secondary endpoints was acceptable. It was agreed that it better reflects the role of OS as a more 
robust measurement of benefit to patients over ORR, which is often used more as a surrogate measure 
of benefit.  
Paediatric Investigation Plan 
The indication targeted by the PIP: Treatment of adolescents from 12 to less than 18 years of age with 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma. A waiver was given for the paediatric population from birth to 
less than 12 years of age.

2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Nivolumab and relatlimab, the two active substances contained in Opdualag are human 
immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) 
cells by recombinant DNA technology. Nivolumab is the active substance in the authorised medicinal 
product Opdivo (EMEA/H/C/3985). 
Opdualag is presented as a concentrate for solution for infusion in a single use Type I glass vial.  One 
vial of 20 mL contains 240 mg of nivolumab (12 mg/mL) and 80 mg of relatlimab (4 mg/mL).  
Nivolumab and relatlimab are formulated with histidine, histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, sucrose, 
pentetic acid (diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid), polysorbate 80 and water for injections. 
2.4.2.  Active substance - Relatlimab 
2.4.2.1.  General information 
Relatlimab is a fully human IgG4 MAb consisting of four polypeptide chains: two identical heavy chains 
of 446 amino acids and two identical kappa light chains of 214 amino acids, which are linked through 
inter-chain disulfide bonds. Relatlimab is directed against LAG-3 receptor, a negative T-cell regulator 
associated with T-cell exhaustion. The mechanism of action of relatlimab is to bind to LAG-3 on T-cells 
and block the interaction between LAG-3 and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class II, the 
peptide antigen presentation molecule recognised by CD4+ T-cells. By blocking the normal down 
regulatory pathway, relatlimab reverses LAG-3-mediated inhibition of T-cell activation. The mechanism 
of action does not involve effector function, such as activation of complement dependent cytotoxicity 
(CDC) or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). 
Relatlimab has a theoretical mass of 148.2 kDa for the intact antibody and one consensus site for N-
linked glycosylation (Asn297 of the heavy chain). 
2.4.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Manufacturing process and process controls 
Active substance manufacturing takes place at a single-use facility (SUF) at Bristol-Myers Squibb 
Company, Devens, MA, USA (BMS-Devens).   
Assessment report  
EMA/720884/2022  
Page 17/147 
 
 
 
Relatlimab is produced as a secreted protein in a manufacturing-scale cell culture using a CHO cell line 
that was transfected with an expression vector containing the coding sequences for the heavy and light 
chains of the relatlimab IgG.  
A pre-harvest sample from the bioreactor is tested for bioburden, endotoxin, mycoplasma, minute 
virus of mice (MVM) and in vitro adventitious agents. Subsequent filtering through depth filter and 
membrane filters produces a clarified bulk which is further processed.  
The downstream process is designed to reduce impurities and potential adventitious viral agents and to 
formulate the active substance. The relatlimab protein is processed across a series of chromatography, 
viral inactivation, viral filtration, and ultrafiltration/diafiltration steps.  The active substance in 
bioprocess containers is transferred to the cryogenics facility at BMS-Devens where it is frozen. The 
active substance may be stored refrigerated with protection from light prior to transfer at the 
manufacturing facility and prior to freezing.  
The relatlimab active substance manufacturing process does not include any reprocessing steps. 
Control of materials 
Raw materials used in the manufacture of relatlimab active substance are either of compendial grade 
or controlled to ensure the quality and safety of the active substance and to maintain the consistency 
of the manufacturing process. Information provided on raw materials of biological origin do not give 
rise to safety concerns with regard to potential viral contamination or TSE.  
A master cell bank was prepared from the RCB in 2012 and one working cell bank, was generated from 
the MCB in 2014. The MCB and WCB are stored frozen and are re-evaluated. Results from the initial re-
evaluations raise no issues. Cell bank testing is performed in line with ICH Q5A and Q5D guidelines. 
Future WCBs are qualified based on provided analytical test procedures, the performance in the 
bioreactor and release results of one active substance lot. The stability of the cell line after normal 
production and after extended passaging was demonstrated by characterisation of the end-of-
production cell banks (EPCBs). The limit of in vitro cell age (LIVCA) was determined through extended 
cell age development followed by evaluation of the stability of the production cell line in scale-down 
model bioreactors.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The in-process control (IPC) strategy for the manufacture of relatlimab active substance is described as 
a tiered set of in-process ranges to ensure consistent monitoring and control of the manufacturing 
process. IPC ranges for individual inputs (process parameters or PPs) and outputs (performance 
attributes or PAs) are classified as critical (CPPs and CPAs) when a potential impact of the parameter 
on the manufacturing process or an active substance critical quality attribute (CQA) was recognised 
during manufacturing process development. Excursions outside the ranges for PPs and PAs are 
investigated according to a established procedure. Excursions from the ranges for CPPs and CPAs are 
investigated for product quality impact and could lead to lot rejection. A confirmed excursion outside 
any CQA range or distribution results in rejection of the lot. This IPC strategy and the defined set of 
(C)PPs and (C)PAs are considered adequate for control of the manufacturing process.  
Process validation 
The process validation strategy encompasses three stages: design, process verification (also referred 
to as PPQ) and ongoing process verification. The PPQ protocols included prospectively defined 
acceptance criteria consisting of numerical limits for release testing results, CPAs, CPPs, PAs, and PPs, 
as defined in the IPC strategy presented. Acceptance criteria for the upstream and downstream 
manufacturing process were met, demonstrating that the manufacturing process is effective and 
consistent for the production of relatlimab active substance. All PPQ lots met the proposed commercial

active substance release specification. Supporting qualification studies included shipping validation, 
chromatography resin lifetime studies, impurity clearance studies, extended testing of intermediates, 
viral clearance studies, microbial control strategy studies, single-use systems studies, and in-process 
hold biochemical stability studies. After PPQ was completed, the IPC ranges and classifications were 
reviewed and changed when appropriate. Overall, process validation is considered satisfactory. 
Manufacturing process development 
The relatlimab active substance manufacturing process development is divided in Process A, Process B, 
Process B.1, and the Commercial Manufacturing Process (CMP).  
Process A material was used to support toxicology studies. Material from the CMP process was used in 
early-phase studies as well as in pivotal clinical studies as a component of the fixed-dose combination 
(FDC) product, and no changes were introduced during or after the pivotal study. Therefore, no 
concerns are raised regarding differences between the commercial and clinically tested material. 
Nevertheless, comprehensive data is provided on analytical comparability for each manufacturing 
process development step and as well as a comparison of all processes. Analytical comparability 
between Process A and Process B, Process B and Process B.1, and Process B.1 and CMP is considered 
sufficiently demonstrated. 
Potential CQAs were identified for product-related variants, process-related impurities and formulation 
related quality attributes. The available knowledge for each attribute, both specific to relatlimab and 
from relevant supporting class knowledge was compiled and then each attribute was assigned as 
critical or non-critical.  
The development of individual manufacturing steps is studied through comprehensive process 
characterisation studies and were used to establish the IPC strategy. This includes the definition of 
parameter ranges and the identification of (C)PPs and (C)PAs. Process parameter risk assessments 
were performed evaluating the potential impact on CQAs and (C)PAs. Parameters were ranked based 
on their overall risk score which determined whether or not further evaluation through Design of 
Experiments (DoE) was performed. Appropriate ranges were determined to evaluate in modelling 
DoEs, and results evaluated using statistical software. For each parameter it was determined if there 
was a statistically significant and/or a practical significant impact on a process output to determine the 
classification of parameters for the IPC strategy implementation. Scale-down models were qualified by 
demonstrating equivalence between the manufacture-scale and scale-down model. Overall, the studies 
demonstrate adequate control and understanding of the manufacturing process and support the ranges 
for (C)PPs and (C)PAs as proposed in the IPC strategy. 
Overall, information on manufacturing process development is considered satisfactory. 
Characterisation 
Characterisation of relatlimab was performed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the 
chemical structure and the biochemical, biophysical, and biological properties of the protein allowing a 
precise description of its quality attributes. Several state-of-the-art methods were used to evaluate the 
properties of nivolumab that relate to its primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary protein structure. 
In addition, post-translational modifications related to N- and C-terminal heterogeneity, glycosylation, 
disulfide bonding, Met and Trp oxidation, deamidation, and charge variant characterisation were 
included in the evaluation. The biological activity of relatlimab was also characterised.

2.4.2.3.  Specification 
Specification 
Relatlimab quality control testing for batch release includes appearance, quantity, pH, purity, identity, 
potency, process-related impurities and endotoxins/bioburden.  
Analytical procedures 
Method descriptions for all non-compendial analytical procedures are provided and validations are 
performed according to ICH Q2(R1). 
Batch analyses 
Batch (lot) information for relatlimab active substance (31) including the process designation, site of 
manufacture, date of manufacture, batch size and designated use for each active substance batch is 
presented for all Process A, B, B1 and CMP lots. All batch analysis data were in line with the 
acceptance criteria that applied at the time of testing. 
Reference standards  
The primary reference standard and working reference standard are prepared using the CMP and have 
both supported pivotal clinical trials. The PRS and WRS were initially qualified using release methods 
and additional testing followed by qualification of release tests relative to a previous research reference 
standard (RRS) or the PRS, respectively, to demonstrate suitability for their intended use. The PRS and 
WRS are requalified. Future WRSs are qualified using the PRS lot.  
Container closure system 
Relatlimab active substance is filled into single-use bioprocess containers. Extractables studies were 
performed. The quantification of volatile extractables in the test solutions show very low levels (ppb) 
and no metals were detected for any test solution. Leachable studies were performed by exposing the 
active substance or the final formulation buffer. The leachables that increased above baseline values 
during the hold period were assessed for their potential impact on patient safety. The toxicological 
review concluded that no leachable compounds are anticipated to pose a safety risk when relatlimab is 
administered as directed. 
Bioprocess container integrity testing confirmed the integrity of the container closure system. 
2.4.2.4.  Stability 
A shelf life of 36 months is claimed for the active substance when stored at -60°C ± 10°C. 
Stability studies were conducted on four CMP batches of relatlimab active substance in accordance with 
ICH stability guidelines and demonstrate that the active substance is stable for up to 36 months when 
stored at -60°C ± 10°C and protected from light. The long-term stability is continued for up to 60 
months to support optional shelf-life extension post-authorisation. 
2.4.3.  Active substance - Nivolumab 
2.4.3.1.  General information 
Nivolumab is a fully human IgG4 MAb with 440 amino acid heavy chains and 214 amino acid kappa 
light chains linked through inter-chain disulfide bonds. Nivolumab is a highly specific programmed 
death 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor. The co-inhibitory receptor PD 1 has important T-cell 
Assessment report  
EMA/720884/2022  
Page 20/147 
 
 
 
regulatory functions. It mediates tumour-specific inhibition of T-cell responses in tumours, but does 
not mediate ADCC of activated human T-cells. Engagement of PD-1 by its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 is a 
key interaction that allows tumours to evade immune-mediated destruction by inhibition of T-cell 
proliferation, survival and cytokine secretion. Nivolumab blocks PD 1, thereby inhibiting multiple PD-1 
ligand interactions and restoring T-cell responsiveness and the ability to mount a direct T cell immune 
attack against tumour cells. 
Nivolumab-histidine has a theoretical mass of 146.2 kDa for the intact antibody and one consensus site 
for N-linked glycosylation (Asn290 of the heavy chain). The heavy chain includes S221P mutation 
which is known to impart increased stability to IgG4 antibodies. 
The active substance is identical to nivolumab in Opdivo (referred to as nivolumab-citrate). The 
manufacturing process of nivolumab-histidine (Process C-histidine) is also highly similar to the 
approved commercial manufacturing process for nivolumab-citrate (Process C) with respect to the 
expression system, upstream and downstream manufacturing process, process controls and control 
strategy, and the active substance dossiers have been aligned when appropriate. Therefore, the 
assessment of the dossier focussed on the differences between the two dossiers. 
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Manufacturing process and process controls 
Active substance manufacturing also takes place at Bristol-Myers Squibb Company in Devens, MA, USA 
(BMS-Devens). It is manufactured following Process C-Histidine to produce nivolumab active substance 
formulated in a histidine-based buffer (referred to as nivolumab-histidine). Process C-Histidine was 
developed based on Process C, which is the commercially approved manufacturing process to produce 
nivolumab active substance formulated in citrate-based buffer (nivolumab citrate, BMS 936558). 
One vial of the working cell bank (WCB) is thawed and expanded in several steps to inoculate the 
production bioreactor, which leads to one formulated active substance lot. Active substance lots are 
not combined at the active substance stage.  
Nivolumab-histidine is produced as a secreted protein in a manufacturing-scale cell culture using the 
same Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line that is used to produce nivolumab-citrate. A conventional 
two-tiered cell banking system is employed, consisting of a MCB from which the WCBs are derived. 
The upstream manufacturing process is a conventional fermentation process and is identical to that for 
nivolumab-citrate with the exception of minor facility related changes and a change to the primary 
recovery step which was altered to align with manufacturing facility capabilities.  
The downstream manufacturing steps for the production of nivolumab-histidine up to the ultrafiltration 
and diafiltration (UF/DF) step are the same as for the production of nivolumab-citrate, except for minor 
facility related changes. The UF/DF step, formulation, filtration and fill steps, and active substance 
handling and cryogenics steps were changed to accommodate the increase in protein concentration, 
the change in formulation buffer, the change in container closure and the frozen storage of the active 
substance. Hold conditions for in-process intermediates were re-established when appropriate. The 
active substance in bioprocess containers is transferred to the cryogenics facility at BMS-Devens where 
it is frozen. The active substance may be stored refrigerated with protection from light prior to transfer 
at the manufacturing facility and prior to freezing. 
The nivolumab-histidine active substance manufacturing process does not include any reprocessing 
steps. 
Assessment report  
EMA/720884/2022  
Page 21/147 
 
 
 
Control of materials 
All raw materials, media, buffers, filters and solutions used in the Process C-histidine are the same as 
those used in the commercially approved Process C, with the exception of formulation specific 
materials and the addition of primary recovery filters. Information provided on raw materials of 
biological origin do not give rise to safety concerns with regard to potential viral contamination or TSE. 
Cell bank testing is performed in line with ICH Q5A and Q5D guidelines.  The MCB and WCB are stored 
frozen facilities. The MCB is re-evaluated, a WCB is re-evaluated. The stability of the WCB after 
production of nivolumab-histidine was demonstrated by characterisation of the end-of-production cell 
bank (EPCB).  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The in-process control (IPC) strategy for Process C-Histidine is based on the IPC strategy for Process C 
and aligns with the commercially approved ranges when appropriate. All ranges for Process C that 
were considered alert ranges are action ranges for Process C-Histidine. The IPC strategy for altered 
steps was developed based on data from process development, process characterisation, and active 
substance commercial manufacturing experience.  
Process validation 
The process validation strategy encompasses three stages: design, process qualification, and continued 
process verification. The PPQ protocols included prospectively defined acceptance criteria consisting of 
numerical limits for release testing results, CPAs, CPPs, PAs, and PPs, as defined in the IPC strategy 
presented. Acceptance criteria for the upstream and downstream manufacturing process were met, 
demonstrating that the manufacturing process is effective and consistent for the production of 
relatlimab active substance. All PPQ lots met the proposed commercial active substance release 
specification. Supporting qualifications include studies performed for the validation of Process C when 
appropriate. After PPQ was completed, the IPC ranges and classifications were reviewed and changed 
when appropriate. 
Manufacturing process development 
Process C-histidine for the manufacture of nivolumab-histidine is based on Process C and was initially 
implemented for early clinical manufacturing at BMS-Bothell before transfer to BMS-Devens. Detailed 
development information reflecting the changes from Process C to Process C-histidine for each step in 
the manufacturing process are provided. Overall, the studies demonstrate adequate control and 
understanding of the manufacturing process and support the ranges for (C)PPs and (C)PAs as proposed 
in the IPC strategy.  
Analytical comparability between Process C and Process C-histidine is performed in accordance with 
ICH Q5E. Based on results from release testing, extended characterisation studies, and comparability 
assessment of stability, Process C-histidine and nivolumab-histidine active substance are considered 
comparable to Process C and nivolumab-citrate active substance.  
Critical quality attributes for nivolumab-histidine DS are aligned with those for nivolumab-citrate DS 
with the exception of formulation related attributes and changes to the criticality of some attributes as 
justified.  
Characterisation 
The nivolumab molecule and its process- and product-related impurities are identical between the 
nivolumab-histidine and nivolumab-citrate active substances, therefore this information is unchanged. 
Tests that were used for the comparability assay are indicated.

2.4.3.3.  Specification 
Specifications 
Nivolumab quality control testing for batch release includes appearance, quantity, pH, purity, identity, 
potency, process-related impurities and endotoxins/bioburden.  
The nivolumab-histidine active substance specification is aligned with the approved nivolumab-citrate 
active substance specification when appropriate. Changes to the appearance and protein concentration 
reflect the differences in formulation. As no meaningful trends are observed under the recommended 
storage condition of -50°C to -70°C, the acceptance criteria for release and stability are the same and 
aligned with the nivolumab-citrate shelf-life specifications when appropriate.  
Analytical procedures 
Method descriptions for all non-compendial analytical procedures are provided and validations are 
performed according to ICH Q2(R1). When validations performed on nivolumab-citrate were applicable 
to nivolumab-histidine active substance and they were not repeated, additional experiments were 
performed, as applicable, to demonstrate the suitability of the methods for nivolumab-histidine active 
substance. 
Reference standards or materials 
The reference standards for nivolumab-histidine active substance are the same for nivolumab-citrate 
active substance. For the two-tiered reference standard programme, the PRS and two WRS have been 
used. The stability of PRS and WRS will be monitored through annual testing. New lots of WRS will also 
be identified from released nivolumab-citrate active substance lots according to the previously 
approved qualification protocol. 
Batch analyses 
Batch analysis data from all 20 nivolumab-histidine active substance batches currently produced are 
used to support the proposed specification. The information provided does not call for comment. 
Container closure system 
Nivolumab-histidine active substance is filled into the same single-use, pre-sterilised bioprocess 
containers as relatlimab active substance. The extractables and leachables studies are identical to 
those in the relatlimab active substance dossier. For the leachable study, the relatlimab active 
substance and the relatlimab final formulation buffer test solutions are considered worst-case for 
nivolumab histidine active substance as the relatlimab final formulation is more acidic compared to the 
nivolumab histidine final formulation. This is acceptable. 
2.4.3.4.  Stability 
A shelf life of 36 months is claimed for the active substance when stored at -60°C ± 10°C. 
Stability studies are being conducted on four Process C-histidine batches of nivolumab-histidine active 
substance in accordance with ICH stability guidelines and demonstrate that the active substance is 
stable for up to 36 months when stored at -60°C ± 10°C and protected from light. The long-term 
stability is continued for up to 60 months to support optional shelf-life extension post-authorisation.

Pharmaceutical development 
The applicant has developed a FDC finished product containing relatlimab and nivolumab co-formulated 
within a single glass vial at a protein-mass ratio of 1:3. The relatlimab and nivolumab active 
substances that are used to manufacture Opdualag are both formulated in a histidine-based buffer 
system. The finished product is prepared by diluting the thawed and pooled active substances with 
buffer solution for dilution. The buffer solution for dilution contains all the excipients that are used in 
each active substance and, additionally, the metal-ion chelator pentetic acid. 
To evaluate the feasibility of co-formulating relatlimab and nivolumab, the stability profile of the FDC 
was compared against the stability profiles of the separate components. The results of the study show 
no difference in the stability profile of the FDC and the samples containing only relatlimab or 
nivolumab-histidine No new degradation products were observed in the FDC solution in comparison to 
the individual antibodies in the FDC formulation buffer. In addition, various state-of-the-art techniques 
were applied to exclude protein-protein interaction.  
The excipients added during the manufacture of the finished product formulation meet compendial 
requirements. No excipients of human or animal origin are used.  
A use-time compatibility study was performed to demonstrate the compatibility of the finished product 
with infusion fluids, IV infusion containers, IV sets, syringes and in-line filters. A high (undiluted at 16 
mg/mL) and low (0.8 mg/mL) concentration was used to bracket all intermediate concentrations and 
all anticipated clinical doses. IV bags made of Polyolefin (PO), Ethylene Vinyl Acetate (EVA), and 
Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), administration sets made of PVC, Polyurethane (PUR), and Di-2-ethylhexyl 
phthalate (DEHP)-free PVC, and in line filter types were 0.2-1.2 µm and made of PES 
(Polyethersulfone), Nylon and PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) were included in the study. 
The applicant performed studies to support storage of the prepared finished product infusion solutions 
(either undiluted at 16 mg/mL or diluted to a concentration as low as 0.8 mg/mL in NS or D5W) under 
refrigeration conditions (2ºC to 8ºC) for up to 24 hours, with a maximum of 8 hours of the total 24 
hours at room temperature (15 °C to 25 °C), room light.

Manufacturing process development 
No changes were made to the finished product manufacturing process during clinical studies. Process 
development studies included material compatibility studies, extractable and leachable studies, mixing 
studies, a filter adsorption study, filling studies, and process hold time studies.  
Materials used during the manufacturing process were found to be compatible with the finished 
product. The identified extractables and leachables identified for the bag/carboy were detected at 
levels that are not expected by the applicant to pose a hazard or safety risk when patients are treated 
once every 28 days at the therapeutic dose. 
Mixing studies were performed for the manufacture of the polysorbate 80/pentetic acid solution, for the 
manufacture of the buffer solution for dilution, and for finished product formulation. Process parameter 
ranges were defined in accordance with the mixing studies. As an alternative supplier of pentetic acid 
with larger particle size was introduced, a longer mixing time was introduced during PPQ for the 
polysorbate 80/pentetic acid solution. 
Process hold time evaluation was performed during the manufacture of a registrational stability batch. 
As part of the process hold-time studies, additional in-process samples were tested above those that 
are collected and tested during routine manufacture. Hold times were evaluate for active substance 
thaw, buffer solution for dilution, formulated finished product, bulk finished product, total time out of 
refrigeration (TOR), and room temperature/light exposure.  
2.4.4.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
All sites involved in the manufacture and control of the finished product are EU GMP compliant. 
Manufacturing process and process controls 
The finished product manufacturing process consists of thawing, mixing, filtration and aseptic filling 
process. Mixing conditions (speed and duration), hold times, and in process controls have been 
defined.  
Process validation 
Three PPQ batches covering minimum and maximum batch sizes were manufactured. Two batches 
were manufactured using holding times in excess of the proposed commercial hold times. All 
specifications and pre-defined acceptance criteria for the manufacture of the PPQ batches were met.  
In addition to the PPQ and process development studies, the applicant performed validation of aseptic 
processing via media fills, validation of sterile filtration and a shipping qualification study. 
2.4.4.3.  Product specification 
Specifications 
The finished product specifications include control of identity, purity, potency and other general tests. 
Analytical methods 
Method descriptions and summaries of the method validations are provided. In-house reference 
standards for relatlimab and nivolumab are used in release and stability testing (see active substance 
section).

Characterisation of impurities 
Process-related impurities are described in the active substance section.  
The applicant conducted a risk assessment for elemental impurities in accordance with ICH Q3D guideline 
showing that there are no concerns. It is concluded that the risk is low and it is not necessary to include 
any elemental impurity controls in the finished product specification. This is acceptable. 
A risk assessment regarding the potential presence of N-nitrosamines impurities in the active substance 
and  finished  product  was  provided.  This  assessment  concludes  the  risk  is  low  and  as  a  consequence 
there  is  no  need  for  testing  either  active  substance  or  finished  product  for  the  presence  of  N-
nitrosamines. This conclusion is endorsed.  
Reference standard 
Reference standards are the same as used to test the active substance. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data are provided, including information on batch numbers, manufacturing site, batch 
size, Active substance batch numbers and manufacturing process, finished product use, and, if 
applicable, clinical study number. A total of 10 finished product batches have been manufactured to 
date, of which nine used active substances manufactured according to the commercial process. The 
data do not call for comment. 
Container closure 
The finished product is supplied in 25 mL vials (Type I glass), with a stopper (coated butyl rubber) and 
a yellow flip-off aluminium seal. The glass vials are sterilised with ethylene oxide (ETO) according to 
ISO 11135-1, Sterilization of Health Care Products – Ethylene oxide – Part 1: Requirements for 
Development, Validation and Routine Control of a Sterilization Process for Medical Devices. In addition, 
the glass vial material does not contain materials of animal origin or natural rubber latex. 
The stoppers are steam sterilised. The stopper material does not contain materials of animal origin, 
natural rubber latex, 2-mercaptobenzothiazole, or any related substance or nitrosamines.  
The flip-off seal is gamma-irradiated. 
The vials are (secondary) packaged in a paperboard folding carton. 
2.4.4.4.  Stability of the product 
A shelf-life of 36 months is proposed for Opdualag stored at the recommended storage condition of 
2°C to 8°C, protected from light.  
Stability studies were conducted on four registrational batches and three PPQ batches according to ICH 
guidelines. Long-term, accelerated and stress stability data, time out of refrigeration (TOR) stability 
data, stress-and-store stability data, and photostability data are provided.  
Long-term stability data are available for 36 months for all batches at the long-term storage 
conditions. All acceptance criteria were met and no significant trends were observed in any of the 
parameters tested. Based on the stability data provided the claimed shelf-life of 36 months for 
Opdualag (unopened vial) when stored at the recommended storage condition of 2°C to 8°C is 
considered acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/720884/2022  
Page 26/147 
 
 
 
Results from the TOR and stress-and-store studies showed no impact on product quality of short 
durations of exposure to room temperature/room light (up to one month) and of short-term exposure 
to temperatures ranging from -20°C to 40°C followed by long-term storage. 
Photostability data demonstrated that the finished product is sensitive to light exposure and therefore, 
it is recommended to store the finished product vials in the original package (a folded paperboard 
carton) to protect from light. An appropriate warning has been included in section 6.4 of the proposed 
SmPC. 
In use physical-chemical stability is claimed for:  
1) 30 days at 2-8°C for the undiluted product, and product diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride 
(9 mg/mL), and  
2) 7 days for product diluted with 5% glucose solution (50 mg/mL).  
In both cases, stability for 24 hours storage at room temperature (≤ 25°C) and room light is claimed 
(of total of 30 days and 7 days storage, respectively). This is acceptable. 
Microbiological in-use stability is claimed for 24 hours at 2-8°C, which is considered acceptable. The 
applicant was requested to amend SmPC section 6.3 with the following standard statement: “From a 
microbiological point of view, the prepared solution for infusion, regardless of the diluent, should be 
used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the 
responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C, unless 
preparation has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions”. 
2.4.4.5. Adventitious agents 
Relatlimab and nivolumab are produced using CHO host cell lines. No human- or animal-derived raw 
materials are used in the manufacture. The raw materials of biological origins used in the relatlimab 
and nivolumab manufacturing processes are listed in the dossier and this does not call for comments. 
Foetal calf serum / foetal bovine serum was used during development of both MCBs. The applicant 
provided the certificates of suitability. 
The manufacturing process of the antibodies have been evaluated for their capacity to remove or 
inactivate viruses.  
The model viruses chosen are commonly used model viruses in viral clearance studies and cover 
relevant physico-chemical characteristics (RNA, DNA, enveloped, non-enveloped, size range 18-200 
nm). This is in line with ICH Q5A (R1) and can be accepted. The results of the virus validation study 
demonstrate effective reduction of all model viruses by the manufacturing process of relatlimab and 
nivolumab. 
The data provided do not give rise to safety concerns as regards to potential viral contamination or 
TSE. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Active substance (relatlimab) 
The active substance manufacturing process is generally described in sufficient detail. Materials used 
during the manufacturing process are listed and tested when appropriate. Critical steps and 
intermediates are controlled by an IPC strategy that is essentially approvable. Issues regarding the 
classification of process parameters have been addressed and intermediate hold conditions are 
Assessment report  
EMA/720884/2022  
Page 27/147 
 
 
 
 
supported by stability studies. Process validation demonstrates that the manufacturing process is 
effective and consistent for the production of relatlimab active substance. Missing information on the 
qualification of buffers and solutions has been provided. The list of CQAs of the active substance is 
considered approvable. The manufacturing process development is described in sufficient detail. 
Analytical comparability between all successive manufacturing processes has been demonstrated. 
Material from the commercial manufacturing process (CMP) was used in early and pivotal clinical 
studies. A comprehensive list of quality attributes (QAs) is provided and divided in active substance 
attributes, process-related impurity attributes, and formulation-related attributes. The individual 
manufacturing steps are studied in comprehensive process characterisation studies. The robustness of 
the manufacturing process is demonstrated using scale-down worst-case studies. 
Relatlimab physicochemical, biological and immunological properties, and heterogeneity of the active 
substance are sufficiently addressed in the characterisation section of the dossier. 
The proposed relatlimab active substance specification is provided with acceptance criteria for release 
and stability. The panel of tests for active substance release and during manufacturing is according to 
the test programme for the active substance of monoclonal antibodies for human use stated in the Ph. 
Eur. <2031>. As no trends are observed during frozen storage of the active substance, the acceptance 
criteria for stability are identical to those for release with the exception of tests that are not regarded 
stability-indicating. Analytical procedures are adequately described and validated. Batch analyses 
demonstrate a high level of batch-to-batch consistency. The proposed specification for relatlimab 
active substance is acceptable.  
Adequate information has been provided for the relatlimab reference standards. Future WRSs are 
relative to the PRS and should comply with acceptance criteria for qualification.  
Drawings and materials of the bioprocess containers in which relatlimab active substance is filled, 
frozen, stored and transported are provided. Additional information regarding BSE/TSE compliance, 
cytotoxicity, extractables and leachables has been provided. The container closure system is 
considered qualified as appropriate for use in the storage of active substance with regard to integrity 
from microbial contamination.  
The data presented support the proposed relatlimab active substance shelf-life of 36 months stored at 
-60°C ± 10°C and protected from light.  
Active substance (Nivolumab-histidine) 
The nivolumab-histidine active substance is identical to the approved nivolumab-citrate active 
substance of Opdivo with the exception of protein concentration and formulation. Consequently, this 
section of dossier is highly similar to the active substance section of the approved Opdivo dossier.  
Nivolumab-histidine is an IgG4 human monoclonal antibody selectively binding to the programmed 
death-1 (PD-1) receptor on the surface of target T-cells and structurally identical to nivolumab-citrate.  
The nivolumab-histidine active substance manufacturing process, Process C-histidine, is based on 
Process C for the manufacture of nivolumab-citrate active substance and is generally described in 
sufficient detail. Materials used during the manufacturing process are listed and tested when 
appropriate. The MCB for the production of nivolumab-histidine and nivolumab-citrate are identical. 
Critical steps and intermediates are controlled by an IPC strategy that is essentially approvable. An 
issue regarding intermediate hold conditions was adequately addressed. Process validation 
demonstrates that the manufacturing process is effective and consistent for the production of 
nivolumab-histidine active substance. The list of CQAs of the active substance is considered 
approvable. 
Assessment report

Nivolumab-histidine is identical to nivolumab-citrate with regard to physicochemical, biological and 
immunological properties and heterogeneity of the active substance and new studies are considered 
unnecessary. The active substances are also shown to be similar with regard to impurities. 
The proposed relatlimab active substance specification is provided with acceptance criteria for release 
and stability. The panel of tests for active substance release and during manufacturing is according to 
the test programme for the active substance of monoclonal antibodies for human use stated in the Ph. 
Eur. (2031). As no trends are observed during frozen storage of the active substance, the acceptance 
criteria for stability are identical to those for release with the exception of tests that are not regarded 
stability-indicating. Analytical procedures are adequately described and validated. Batch analyses 
demonstrate a high level of batch-to-batch consistency. The proposed specification is considered 
acceptable. 
Adequate information has been provided for the nivolumab-histidine active substance reference 
standards, which are the same as those for nivolumab-citrate active substance.  
The container closure system is identical to that for relatlimab active substance. Drawings and 
materials of the bioprocess containers in which relatlimab active substance is filled, frozen, stored and 
transported are provided. Extractables and leachables were studied. The container closure system is 
considered qualified as appropriate for use in the storage of active substance with regard to integrity 
from microbial contamination.  
The data presented support the proposed nivolumab-histidine active substance shelf-life of 36 months 
stored at -60°C ± 10°C and protected from light.  
Finished product 
The pharmaceutical development of the finished product is sufficiently described. Prior to the 
development of the FDC, the administration of relatlimab-nivolumab combination therapy was 
performed by using two separate finished products. However, all clinical trials were performed with the 
FDC.  
The selection of excipients is sufficiently justified. For pentetic acid (USP-grade), additional detail was 
provided on its quality control. The other excipients are Ph. Eur. Grade. No novel excipients are used. 
The studies to evaluate potential interaction between relatlimab and nivolumab give no reason for 
concern and support feasibility of coformulation. Ruggedness of the finished product formulation is 
demonstrated, but showed that pH can impact charge variants during storage. Batch analysis data 
suggest that the proposed specification for pH is unnecessary wide, but the acceptance criterium has 
been aligned with active substance and is thus considered acceptable. 
No changes were made to the finished product manufacturing process during clinical studies. Process 
development studies, which included material compatibility studies, extractable and leachable studies, 
mixing studies, a filter adsorption study, filling studies, and process hold time studies, give no reason 
for concern. Further information on the evaluation of extractables/leachables is provided and does not 
give rise to any concerns. Operational ranges for the finished product manufacturing process are in 
general supported by the mixing studies. A comprehensive description of the finished product control 
strategy and information on the approach used for criticality assignment of the process parameters has 
been provided. 
Sufficient information on the sites involved in finished product manufacturing is provided. The 
manufacturing process is, in general, described in sufficient detail. Information on the filling procedure 
is provided. In addition, some of the critical equipment has been further specified and was laid down in 
P.3.3. No intermediates are defined in the finished product manufacturing process. Hold times for the 
different manufacturing stages are provided and supported by the PPQ, media-fill, and hold-time 
Assessment report

studies. IPCs for the manufacture of the buffer solution and finished product are listed and have been 
supplemented with concise information on the actions taken in case a limit is not met. The acceptance 
criterion for bioburden of the dilution buffer prior to sterile filtration has been sufficiently justified and 
is in line with EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/850374/2015.  
The PPQ study is in line with expectations. All acceptance criteria were met and results demonstrate 
that the process is capable to consistently produce finished product batches that comply with the 
specifications. Additional validation studies that were performed, include validation of aseptic 
processing via media fills, validation of sterile filtration and a shipping qualification study. Based on 
these studies, aseptic processing and sterile filtration are considered sufficiently validated. For the 
shipping qualification a summary is provided. Temperature excursions outside of the approved range 
were sufficiently explained. 
The applicant has provided justification for the acceptance criteria for the finished product release test 
and for the omission of a number of test methods that are part of the specifications of the single-
protein products. In general, the proposed finished product test panel and acceptance criteria are 
considered sufficiently justified.  The provided method descriptions are in general considered sufficient, 
and details were laid down in the dossier. Methods have been validated in accordance with ICH Q2(R1) 
and all acceptance criteria were met.  
The container closure system, consisting of a Type I glass vial, stoppered with a 20-mm FluroTec film-
laminated chlorobutyl rubber stopper, and 20-mm aluminium ferrule with yellow polypropylene flip-off 
seal, is sufficiently detailed. Information on the ethylene oxide sterilisation of the empty vials and proof 
of ISO certification were provided.   
The available long term stability data support the proposed shelf life of 36 months at 5°C. 
Photostability data demonstrated that the finished product is sensitive to light exposure and therefore, 
it is recommended to store finished product vials in the original package (a folded paperboard carton) 
to protect from light. This package provides sufficient protection.  
The proposed physical chemical in-use stability claim is sufficiently supported by data. The proposed 
microbiological in-use stability claim was not agreed, and the applicant was requested to be aligned 
with the Guideline CPM/QWP/159/96 on maximum shelf-life for sterile products for human use after 
first opening or following reconstitution.  
Adventitious agents 
Adventitious agents’ safety including TSE have been sufficiently assured. 
2.4.6.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The overall quality of Opdualag is considered acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
documentation comply with existing guidelines.  
In conclusion, based on the review of the data provided, the marketing authorisation application for 
Opdualag is considered approvable from the quality point of view. 
2.4.7.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends points for investigation.

2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
In Opdualag, treatment with relatlimab is combined with nivolumab. 
Nivolumab has already market authorisation under the name Opdivo for several cancer indications. 
There is no new information presented on single administration of nivolumab. The non-clinical 
information on nivolumab is available in the EPAR and the SmPC for Opdivo (see Opdivo EPAR). The 
non-clinical information presented below involves either the studies with relatlimab alone or the 
combination of relatlimab and nivolumab, which are the two monoclonal antibodies present in the 
Opdualag formulation. As the therapeutic is a biological product developed for a cancer indication, it 
falls within in the scope of ICH S6 and ICH S9. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro binding assays 
Binding of relatlimab to its target human LAG-3 (EC50 0.49 nM) or to the LAG-3 loop insertion peptide 
(EC50 0.44 nM) was assessed by means of ELISA in study BDX-1408-242. Via SPR (study BDX-1408-
241) the binding of relatlimab to human recombinant LAG-3 (EC50 0.12 nM) was determined. The 
binding of relatlimab to LAG-3 expressed on the membrane of an activated human CD4+ T-cell was 
assessed by means of Scatchard (KD 0.51 nM) (BDX-1408-243). With FACS, binding of relatlimab to 
human (EC50 0.11 nM) and cynomolgus (EC50 29.11 nM) activated CD4+T cells, hLAG-3 (EC50 2.33 
nM) and cynLAG-3 (EC50 28.73 nM) expressing CHO cells and muLAG-s expressing 3A9 cells (not 
measurable) was assessed in study BDX-1408-243. Relatlimab has highest affinity for human LAG-3, 
followed by cynomolgus LAG-3, albeit 265x lower. Affinity for LAG-3 protein compared to affinity to 
LAG-3 expressed on CD4+ T-cells is comparable upon different analysis methods and EC50 appears 
slightly lower than nanomolar range for human LAG-3 and is 10-100-fold higher for cynomolgus LAG-
3). The affinity for murine LAG-3 appears not detectable. 
Besides expression on (exhausted) CD-4 T-cells, LAG-3 is also expressed on the membrane of 
plasmacytoid DCs. 
Using MHC class II positive Daudi (B-Lymphoma) cells, the ability of relatlimab to block binding huLAG-
3-mFc (fixed concentration, pre-incubated with antibody) compared to isotype control was assessed 
and resulted in an IC50 of 0.67 nM, which is in the range comparable to EC50 values for binding of 
relatlimab to its target, LAG-3, as assessed in in vitro binding studies (study BDX-1408-244).  
In ELISA and Octet binding assays (study IO00330), LAG-3 binding to FGL1 was confirmed, and BMS-
986016 was able to potently block recombinant LAG-3/FGL1 binding with an estimated IC50 of 0.02 
nM by ELISA. This binding was also observed in an in vitro co-culture assay. Parental LK35.2 cells 
(murine B-cell line), expressing MHC II, were engineered to co-express membrane-anchored human 
FGL1 on their surface (LK35-FGL1TM), together with endogenous MHC Class II. Co-culture with 3A9-
huLAG-3 cells (producing soluble LAG-3) resulted in enhanced repression of IL-2 production by the T 
cells. This was used as a read-out to measure the effect of the LAG-3 blocking antibody relatlimab. In 
a dose-dependent manner, relatlimab enhanced T-cell IL-2 production to a similar Ymax in co-culture 
with either parental (expressing only MHC II) or LK35-FGL1TM (expressing both MHC II and FGL1) cell 
lines, with a similar estimated IC50 (1.39 nM and 0.95 nM, respectively). The IC50 values were at the 
Assessment report  
EMA/720884/2022

low end of the nanomolar range and apparently both the blockade of the interaction LAG3/MHC II and 
the LAG3/FGL1 contribute to the effect. It has to be mentioned that IL-2 repression is further 
decreased when expressing FGL-1 in the parent cell line.  
In vitro functional assays 
In study BDX-1408-245 it was shown that an antigen-specific mouse T-cell hybridoma transfected with 
the human LAG-3 gene (3A9-huLAG-3 cells) was able to functionally interact with APCs that express 
mouse MHC Class II. This led to an inhibitory signal into the mouse T-cell line which resulted in 
attenuated responsiveness to a cognate peptide. This in vitro assay was used in two ways; 1) titrating 
the peptide in excess of antibody (relatlimab or IgG4 isotype) and 2) titrating the antibody in presence 
of intermediate peptide concentration. In the first option, the EC50 for peptide-responsiveness in the 
presence of relatlimab was 0.26 nM compared to 0.95 nM in the presence of isotype control antibody. 
Via the second more sensitive option; EC50 for peptide responsiveness by the T-cells in the presence of 
relatlimab was 1.05 nM compared to an absence of peptide responsiveness of the cell line exposed to 
isotype control antibody. The blockade of the LAG-3-mediated inhibition of T-cells and thus the 
responsiveness to the peptide can be measured by means of IL-2 secretion.  
In study BDX-1408-246, the capacity of nivolumab, ipilimumab, relatlimab or a combination of these to 
enhance the activation of human PBMC upon stimulation with superantigen SEB (staphylococcus 
enterotoxin B) was evaluated. Relatlimab alone was not able to enhance IL-2 secretion upon 
stimulation with increasing levels of SEB, whereas nivolumab and ipilimumab were able to enhance IL-
2 secretion upon increasing levels of SEB. A combination of nivolumab or ipilimumab with relatlimab is 
able to increase the enhancement of IL-2 secretion, with the combination of ipilimumab with relatlimab 
seemingly more effective than the combination of nivolumab with relatlimab.  
In study BDX-1408-247 it was demonstrated that relatlimab lacked measurable induction of ADCC or 
CDC on LAG-3+ activated human T-cells. Exposure of activated T-cells to either relatlimab or isotype 
control did not result in measurable ADCC or CDC whereas exposure to the positive controls, anti-CD30 
antibody (ADCC) or anti-MHC Class I (CDC) resulted in dose-dependent cytotoxicity. ADCC and CDC 
were assessed at concentrations up to 10 ug/ml and 50 ug/ml respectively, which are lower than those 
clinically relevant (Cmax in patients=61.5 ug/ml). However, depletion of T cells was not observed in in 
vivo non-clinical studies. 
In report IO00197 allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR) containing HLA-mismatched mature 
dendritic cells and CD4 T-responding cells showed that mAb blockade of PD-1 exhibited consistent and 
marked enhancement (2.1- to 11.4-fold) of IL-2 and IFN-γ production. PD-1 antagonism also resulted 
in consistently enhanced cytokine levels (3.1- to 53.1-fold) in the allogeneic MLR suppressed with Treg 
cells. Subsequent monoclonal antibody blockade of LAG-3 yielded more modest enhancement (0.5- to 
3.4-fold) of cytokine production in the MLR and Treg MLR assays. However, in experiments that 
surveyed both IL-2 and IFN-γ, different donor cell pairs, different levels of PD-1 mAb combinations, 
and at different Treg:CD4 T-cell ratios, statistically significant enhancement of CD4 T cell activity was 
observed. Almost universally, significant IL-2 and IFN-y enhancement due to LAG-3 antagonism 
required the combination with PD-1 receptor antagonism. Thus LAG 3 blockage showed more 
significant effects in combination when low concentrations of PD1 blocker were added. These results 
together with in vivo pharmacology studies suggest a reasonable expectation that LAG-3 antagonism 
could enhance anti-tumour immunity in patients treated with PD-1 antagonists, either with or without 
high levels of suppression by Treg cells.

In vivo animal studies with tumour models  
Several in vivo animal studies have been conducted with murine tumour models. In these models, the 
mouse surrogates for relatlimab (19C7 and C9B7W) were used.   
In an immunogenic Sa1N fibrosarcoma tumour model (study BDX-1408-251, dosing at D7, 10 and 14), 
the anti-tumour effect of 1, 3.3, 10 and 30 mg/kg anti-LAG-3 antibody (19C7) was 30%, 60%, 40% 
and 60%, respectively.  
In two other studies Study (MDX-1106-059 & Study BDX-1408-224), the effect of the combination of 
10 mg/kg anti-LAG3 antibody (C9B7W) and 10 mg/kg anti-PD-1 antibody (4H2) was evaluated. In 
study MDX-1106-059 (dosing at D7, 10 and 14), the combination showed an 80% antitumour response 
compared to 40% with anti-LAG-3 alone and no anti-tumour effect with anti-PD-1 alone. In Study 
BDX-1408-224 (dosing at D9, 14 and 17), the combination of anti-PD-1 and anti-LAG-3 showed a 90% 
antitumour response compared to 20% with anti-LAG-3 alone and no antitumour effect with anti-PD-1 
alone. Apparently the combination of anti-PD-1 antibody with anti-LAG3 antibody is more effective in 
raising an antitumour response compared to anti-LAG3 alone in a Sa1N fibrosarcoma tumour model. It 
should be noted that in study BDX-1408-251, the 19C7 antibody and in study MDX-1106-059 & Study 
BDX-1408-224 the C9B7W antibody was used as the anti-LAG3 antibody. Both seem to be effective in 
the syngeneic mouse model.  
In study BDX-1408-253, the antitumour activity of 10 mg/kg anti-LAG-3 antibody (19C7) and 10 
mg/kg anti-PD-1 antibody (4H2) as single agents and in combination (0.34, 1, 3.4 and 10 mg/kg anti-
LAG-3 antibody (19C7) and 10 mg/kg anti-PD-1 antibody (4H2) were evaluated in the colon carcinoma 
MC38 model, in which tumour free mice (day 0) were IP dosed with antibodies on D7, 10 and 14). 
Anti-LAG-3 antibody (19C7) showed modest tumour growth inhibition at the 10 mg/kg dose and did 
not yield any tumour-free mice while anti-PD-1 antibody led to 40% of mice being rendered tumour 
free. The combination of anti-LAG-3 and anti-PD-1 antibody led to enhanced antitumour activity (58%-
67%-83% tumour-free mice for 1, 3.4 and 10 mg/kg anti-LAG3 respectively) compared to anti-PD-1 
antibody alone (40%). 
In study MDX-1408-206-R and study BDX-1408-207 anti-tumour effect of anti-LAG-3 antibody 
(C9B7W) as a single agent and in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody (4H2) or anti-CTLA-4 antibody 
(9D9) was evaluated in 2 independent studies in the MC38 colon carcinoma model. In study MDX-
1408-206-R (dosing at D7, 10 and 12) anti-PD-1 antibody treatment alone resulted in 40% anti-
tumour activity and in 70% anti-tumour activity when combined with anti-LAG-3. Anti-LAG-3 was not 
effective in this tumour model. In study BDX-1408-207 (dosing at D8, 11 and 14) only monotherapy 
with anti-PD-1 resulted in anti-tumour activity. Combination of anti-LAG3 with anti-CTLA4 or anti-PD-1 
resulted in 30% and 70% antitumour activity respectively. A combination of anti-LAG3 with anti-PD-1 
results in a higher anti-tumour activity in the MC38 colon carcinoma model as compared to the 
combination with an anti-CTLA-4 antibody and compared to an anti-PD-1 antibody alone. However, the 
data for the combination of anti-LAG3 and anti-CTLA-4 are not relevant for the current application.  
In study IO00232 the antitumour activity of anti-LAG-3 antibody (19C7) as a single agent and in 
combination with anti-CTLA-4 antibody (9D9) was evaluated in the CT26 Murine Carcinoma model. As 
compared to the isotype control antibody, 10 mg/kg single-agent anti-LAG-3 antibody resulted in 13% 
median tumour growth inhibition and 1 out of 10 tumour-free mice whereas 10 mg/kg single-agent 
anti-CTLA-4 antibody resulted in 78% median tumour growth inhibition and 1 out of 10 tumour-free 
mice. The combination of 10 mg/kg each of anti-LAG-3 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies resulted in 
synergistic antitumour activity with 100% median tumour growth inhibition and 10 out of 10 tumour-
free mice. Apparently an anti-CTLA4 antibody, in particular in combination with an anti-LAG-3 
antibody, is effective in raising an anti-tumour response against this murine carcinoma model.

In addition to solid tumour models, the antitumour activity of anti-LAG-3 antibody (19C7) as a single 
agent and in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody (4H2) or anti-CTLA-4 antibody (9D9) were also 
evaluated in the disseminated murine A20 model of B-cell lymphoma (study BDX-1408-263). Anti-
LAG-3 (10% TF) and anti-PD-1 (20% TF) antibodies were only marginally efficacious as single agents 
while anti-CTLA-4 provided modest survival benefit on its own (30% TF). While the combination of 
anti-LAG-3 with anti-CTLA-4 (20% TF) showed no enhancement of survival compared to either 
antibody alone, the co-administration of anti-LAG-3 and anti-PD-1 resulted in 60% of mice surviving 
until the end of the study, without evidence of tumours upon necropsy. Apparently, a combination of 
an anti-LAG3 antibody with an anti-PD-1 antibody is more effective against a A20 B-cell lymphoma 
model in mice compared to the combination of anti-LAG3 with anti-CTLA4 or monotherapy with one of 
the three antibodies tested.  
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
There were no studies addressing a secondary pharmacologic mechanism of action of relatlimab as its 
target and mechanism of action are selective. 
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
Since relatlimab is an IgG4 monoclonal antibody with a selective mechanism and does not belong to a 
drug or chemical class expected to cause cardiovascular effects, specific safety pharmacology studies, 
including cardiovascular telemetry safety pharmacology studies, were not conducted. Safety 
pharmacology assessments, including clinical evaluations of cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurologic 
function, were included in repeat-dose general toxicology studies, which is agreed. There were no 
effects on safety pharmacology parameters when relatlimab was administered as a single agent or in 
combination with nivolumab in the 4 week and the 3-month GLP repeated dose toxicity studies. 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The pharmacodynamic activity of relatlimab and nivolumab administered in combination was evaluated 
in a 1-month toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys (toxicology study BMS-986016 and BMS-936558). 
This study was not intended to investigate effects of a specific ratio of relatlimab plus nivolumab. 
Relatlimab or nivolumab alone (30 and 100 mg/kg relatlimab or 50 mg/kg nivolumab) and in 
combination (100 mg/kg relatlimab and 50 mg/kg nivolumab) were administered weekly, and the 
following parameters were assessed: in vivo antibody responses and ex vivo recall responses to 
keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) antigen and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and 
immunophenotypic analyses of peripheral blood and splenic T-lymphocyte subsets. When dosed in 
combination, relatlimab and nivolumab did not alter each other’s systemic exposures indicating no 
toxicokinetic drug-drug interactions. There were no relatlimab/nivolumab-related changes in T cell-
dependent antibody responses to KLH and HBsAg or ex-vivo recall responses to KLH in CD8+CD4- T 
cells or HBsAg in CD4+CD8+ or CD4-CD8+ T cells. Test article-related changes in ex vivo recall 
responses to KLH included reversible increases in mean percent: (1) CD69+, TNF-α+, and CD69+TNF-
α+ CD4+CD8- T cells in females at all dose groups and in males at 100 mg/kg relatlimab alone and in 
the combination therapy group without meaningful differences in degree between relatlimab alone or in 
combination with nivolumab; and (2) IFN-γ+, CD69+IFN-γ+, and CD69+TNF-α+IFN-γ+ CD4+CD8- T 
cells in both sexes at 100 mg/kg relatlimab and 50 mg/kg nivolumab when administered individually, 
with further non-additive increases in the combination group. 
Changes in lymphocyte phenotypes at 100 mg/kg relatlimab alone were limited to increases in mean 
percent CD25+FoxP3+ CD8+ T cells. In the combination group, there were modest increases in mean 
Assessment report  
EMA/720884/2022  
Page 34/147 
 
 
 
percent of peripheral blood CD4+ regulatory T cells in male monkeys on and after Day 15 that were 
not reversible; similar changes were observed at 50 mg/kg nivolumab but were reversible. 
Additionally, in the combination group, decreases in mean percent naive CD4+ T cells and concomitant 
increases in central memory CD4+ T cells were noted during the recovery period. Changes that were 
not considered different between groups dosed in combination or with 50 mg/kg nivolumab alone: (1) 
statistically significant non-reversible increases in mean percent splenic CD4+ regulatory T cells; (2) 
non-reversible increases in mean percent splenic CD25+FoxP3+CD8+ T cells; and (3) decreases in 
mean percent splenic naive CD8+ T cells and concomitant increases in central memory CD8+ T cells 
during the recovery period. Increases in the mean percent of CD4+ regulatory T cells and 
CD25+FoxP3+ CD8+ T cells may correlate with the high expression of the targets (i.e., LAG-3 and PD-
1) on regulatory T cells54 in the presence of relatlimab and nivolumab. 
The changes above are consistent with the pharmacological mechanisms of action of relatlimab and 
nivolumab and highlight the potential for enhanced effects when the two are administered in 
combination. 
Pharmacodynamic activity was also explored in the 1-month exploratory combination study in which 
LAG3.1-G4P was administered weekly as a single agent (50 mg/kg) or in combination (10 or 50 
mg/kg) with 50 mg/kg nivolumab to cynomolgus monkeys (study MDX-1408 AND BMS-936558). In 
this study, pharmacodynamic endpoints included evaluation of T-cell-dependent antibody responses to 
Hep A/Hep B, KLH and SKMEL-3 cells, phenotyping of peripheral blood and splenic lymphocytes, and 
immunostaining of splenic tissue. No T-cell-dependent antibody responses were observed. 
LAG3.1-G4P- and nivolumab-related changes consisted of modest increases in the CD4+ lymphocytes 
expressing CD25 (activated CD4+ T lymphocytes) in the peripheral blood in all dose groups as 
compared to vehicle control with no appreciable differences between dose groups. An increase in 
splenic CD4+ lymphocytes expressing CD25 was also noted with 50 mg/kg LAG3.1-G4P alone with 
further increases upon combination treatment with nivolumab (50 mg/kg) in a LAG3.1-G4P dose-
dependent manner as compared to vehicle control. Additional changes in spleen consisted of moderate 
increases in CD4+ lymphocytes expressing CD28hi and CD95 (CD4+ central memory T lymphocytes) 
with concomitant decreases in CD4+ lymphocytes expressing low CD28 and no CD95 (CD4+ naive T 
lymphocytes) in all dose groups, and an elevation in the CD3+ lymphocytes expressing HLA-DR in the 
LAG3.1-G4P and nivolumab high-dose combination (50 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg) group. 
Immunostaining and microscopic analysis of frozen splenic tissue revealed increases in CD3+ 
lymphocytes expressing CD4 and CD25 (activated CD4+ T lymphocytes) relative to vehicle control 
upon combination treatment with LAG3.1-G4P and nivolumab in an LAG3.1-G4P dose-dependent 
manner, which were more pronounced in females than in males. Splenic activated CD4+ T lymphocyte 
cell counts upon LAG3.1-G4P (50 mg/kg) treatment alone, however, were elevated only in females, 
but not in males. Overall, the microscopic findings in the spleen correlated well with the parallel 
findings of increases in activated CD4+ T lymphocytes in the spleen and peripheral blood via flow 
cytometry and reflect an anticipated pharmacologic response to LAG3.1-G4P and/or nivolumab 
treatment. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Relatlimab pharmacokinetic profile was characterised in in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) experiments in 
cynomolgus monkeys with relatlimab administered alone or in combination with nivolumab. In 
addition, since relatlimab does not bind to mouse LAG-3, in vivo efficacy studies in mouse tumour 
models were conducted with a surrogate antibody, clone 19C7, that recognises mouse LAG-3, and 
19C7 serum exposure data was obtained. In addition, multiple dose toxicokinetics (TK) profiles were 
Assessment report  
EMA/720884/2022  
Page 35/147 
 
 
 
characterised in Cynomolgus monkey following once weekly (QW) intravenous (IV) dosing, which is the 
intended clinical route, for a total duration of up to 4 weeks and 3 months.  
Nivolumab has been previously well-characterised in the nonclinical setting as part of BLA 125,554 and 
a brief summary of the nonclinical data is also presented here. 
2.5.3.1.  Methods of analysis 
Assays were developed for the evaluation of PK and immunogenicity in the nonclinical studies. For the 
GLP studies in Cynomolgus monkey and mouse (embryo-foetal development study), assays were 
developed and validated according to guidelines and, while not validated under GLP, sample analysis 
was conducted in compliance with GLP. Relatlimab was quantified using a sandwich enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assays (ELISA) with a capture antibody against relatlimab and a detecting antibody 
against IgG4 (LLOQ 75 ng/ml, ULOQ 8000 ng/ml) or relatlimab (LLOQ 50 ng/ml, ULOQ 3200 ng/ml). 
The provided validation reports, which included (amongst others) the evaluation of precision and 
accuracy (both intra- and inter-assay), specificity, selectivity, and sample stability (long-term at -70ºC, 
freeze-thaw), demonstrate that both assays were suitable for quantification of relatlimab in 
cynomolgus monkey serum. ISR was shown to be acceptable for relatlimab in monkey serum analysis. 
The ELISA method for quantification of anti-LAG-3 C9B7W surrogate antibody in mouse serum utilises 
a recombinant dimeric mouse LAG-3(D1-4) huFcG1 as capture and a commercial goat anti-rat IgG 
(H+L) detecting antibody and was considered fit for purpose for use in the mouse embryo-foetal 
development study (LLOQ 10 ng/ml, ULOQ 1000 ng/ml). Although long-term stability (-70ºC) was not 
established, this is not considered an issue for IgG storage.  
For the measurement of nivolumab in monkey serum a fit for purpose ELISA (DS10061) and a 
validated ECL (DN12123) method was used. 
For the detection of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) against relatlimab or nivolumab in monkey serum, 
bridging immunoassays with Meso Scale Discovery ECL-based detection were developed. The ADA 
assays were validated and the sensitivity was found to be 0.23 - 0.68 and 50 ng/mL for the anti-
relatlimab and anti-nivolumab assay, respectively. Drug tolerance was 3.33 - 10 µg/mL of relatlimab in 
the presence of 25 ng/mL ADA in cynomolgus monkey serum. 
2.5.3.2.  Absorption 
Upon a single-dose IV bolus of 3, 16.5 or 30 mg/kg (n=1, non-GLP) to male cynomolgus monkeys, a 
multicompartmental decline in relatlimab serum exposure was seen with a terminal elimination half-life 
(t½) of about 11 days and a serum clearance of 0.16 ml/h/kg. Exposure (AUC0-inf) was found to be 
proportional to dose. 
Repeat-dose toxicokinetics (TK) were performed in the 4-week and 3-month toxicology studies (GLP), 
where male and female cynomolgus monkeys (n=5-6/sex) received once weekly (QW) IV doses of 
relatlimab (30 or 100 mg/kg). In general, relatlimab showed a biphasic decline, with an initial 
distribution phase, followed by a very slow elimination phase. Relatlimab systemic exposure in the 
dosing period (AUC0-168) increased dose-proportionally for the 30 and 100 mg/kg dose in both the 4-
week and 3-month study as shown by the comparable dose normalised AUCs. No clear or consistent 
sex difference was observed on serum exposure. After 4-week IV multiple (QW) dosing, the volume of 
distribution, as estimated by population PK analysis, was low (i.e. 0.072 L/kg), about 2–fold the 
plasma volume in monkey, and in line with human (~0.095 L/kg). Clearance in monkey was very low 
(i.e. 0.12 ml/h/kg) and is about 1.5-fold higher than in humans (~0.078 ml/h/kg). Terminal 
elimination half-life (T1/2) in monkeys was about 20 days in the 4-week study and about 20 – 30 days 
Assessment report  
EMA/720884/2022  
Page 36/147 
 
 
 
in the 3-month toxicology study and was ~25.7 days in human. Exposure accumulation ratios upon 
multiple dosing were ~2.2-fold (Day 22) in the 4-week study and 4.4-fold (D85) in the 3-month study 
indicating that steady state was not yet reached in the 4-week study, which is in line with the dosing 
period and the long elimination half-life. Steady state exposures were generally achieved by Day 50. In 
the 4-week study, relatlimab (100 mg/kg) treatment was also combined with nivolumab (50 mg/kg), 
and this did not impact the exposure or accumulation ratio of relatlimab. 
In support of pharmacology mouse xenograft studies, the systemic exposure of the anti-LAG-3 murine 
surrogate antibody (19C7) was determined in serum from the Sa1N and the MC38 mouse xenograft 
models upon intraperitoneal (IP) administration at 7, 10 and 14 days after implantation. In both mouse 
models an increase in 19C7 serum exposure was found over a 9-10-day period upon multiple injections 
and with increasing dose but the PK data are insufficient to conclude on the respective PK parameter 
values. In mouse embryo-foetal development (EFD) study, serum concentrations of C9B7W, the 
murine surrogate anti LAG-3 antibody, were determined on GD10 after intraperitoneal treatment (25 
or 51.5 mg/kg, Q2D) from GD6 to 14. Considering the different route of administration and time points 
of analysis in relation to the dosing periods, no further conclusions can be made on PK parameter 
values for C9B7W. 
2.5.3.3.  Immunogenicity  
ADA formation against relatlimab was found in about 70% to 80% of the treated monkeys in both the 
4-week and the 3-month QW repeat-dose toxicology study. The serum levels of relatlimab were 
generally unaffected, with the exception of 1 monkey at the low dose in the 3-month study.  
2.5.3.4.  Distribution 
Formal tissue distribution and protein binding studies were not conducted with relatlimab. Consistent 
with the known biodistribution of monoclonal antibodies, relatlimab and nivolumab have a low volume 
of distribution (62-79 and 46-71 ml/kg, respectively), suggesting limited extravascular distribution as 
it is lower than twice that of the plasma volume (45 mL/kg).  
Foetal exposure to relatlimab (or C9B7W as surrogate anti-mouse LAG-3 antibody) was not 
investigated in the embryo-foetal development study in mice. However, both relatlimab and nivolumab 
are IgG4 antibodies, and are likely to be transported through placenta by the neonatal FcR (FcRn) 
receptor, especially during the latter half of gestation. 
Relatlimab transfer to maternal milk was not examined. However, as an IgG, relatlimab would be 
expected to be present in the first milk. 
2.5.3.5.  Metabolism 
In accordance with ICH S6(R1), no metabolism studies with relatlimab were conducted in animals. 
2.5.3.6.  Excretion 
In accordance with ICH S6(R1), no specific studies to measure excretion of relatlimab were conducted. 
As relatlimab is a monoclonal antibody, no renal excretion is anticipated due to its molecular size. 
Assessment report  
EMA/720884/2022  
Page 37/147 
 
 
 
2.5.3.7.  Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Drug-drug interaction at the PK level is highly unlikely for this type of product since biotechnology-
derived substances do not metabolise via CYP P450 enzymes. As the mechanism of action may have an 
effect on CYP450 activities via cytokine release, this was further explored in the clinical pharmacology 
(section 2.6.2). 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
No dedicated IV single-dose toxicity studies were performed with relatlimab. Potential acute effects 
were monitored in the repeat-dose toxicity studies. One subcutaneous single-dose toxicity study was 
conducted to evaluate local tolerance (see Section 2.5.4.7). 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
Three repeat-dose toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys were conducted to evaluate the toxicity of 
LAG3.1-G4P (a predecessor non-clinical molecule differing from relatlimab by 2 amino acids) or 
relatlimab when administered either as a single agent or in combination with nivolumab. In an 
exploratory non-GLP study, mature male and female monkeys were administered 10 or 50 mg/kg LAG-
3.1-G4P with or without 50 mg/kg nivolumab once a week for 4 weeks. In one definitive GLP 
combination study, mature male and female monkeys were administered 30 or 100 mg/kg relatlimab 
with or without 50 mg/kg nivolumab once a week for 4 weeks, with a subsequent recovery period of 6 
weeks. In a second definitive GLP study, male and female monkeys were administered 30 or 100 
mg/kg relatlimab - without nivolumab - once a week for 3 months, followed by a recovery period of 10 
weeks. Although significant exposure margins were obtained in the repeat-dose toxicology studies for 
both antibodies, for interpretation of safety data and extrapolation of findings to humans it should be 
considered that relatlimab showed a 265-fold higher affinity for the human epitope than for the 
monkey epitope in activated T cells (29.11 nM vs. at 0.11 nM) and a different dosing ratio between 
nivolumab and relatlimab was used in these studies compared to humans.  
Relatlimab was well tolerated in monkeys when administered IV QW as a single agent at ≤ 100 mg/kg 
(margin-of-exposure based on AUC (MoE): 223) for up to 3 months with no relatlimab-related findings. 
In the pivotal 1-month combination study, one male dosed IV QW at 100 mg/kg relatlimab (MoE: 97), 
in combination with 50 mg/kg nivolumab (MoE: 13), was prematurely sacrificed due to moribund 
conditions and histopathology revealed signs of central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis 
(lymphoplasmacytic inflammation of the choroid plexus; lymphohistiocytic inflammation of the 
vasculature of the brain parenchyma, meninges, and spinal cord) and epididymitis. Additional findings 
in this antibody combination group were irreversible lymphoplasmacytic inflammation of the choroid 
plexus in the brain in both sexes and lymphohistiocytic inflammation of the vasculature of the brain 
parenchyma in one male monkey. Irreversible lymphoplasmacytic inflammation of choroid plexus in 
the brain was also observed in multiple animals dosed with 50 mg/kg nivolumab alone, but not in 
animals dosed with relatlimab alone. None of the animals displayed abnormal neurological clinical 
findings.  
Anti-drug-antibodies (ADAs) against nivolumab were detected in 2/8 animals dosed with 50 mg/kg 
nivolumab in the exploratory non-GLP study, with no apparent impact on nivolumab serum levels or 
exposures. In the definitive combination study, ADAs against nivolumab were detected in one monkey 
at 50 mg/kg nivolumab and one monkey in the combination group, and resulted in slightly lower serum 
Assessment report  
EMA/720884/2022  
Page 38/147 
 
 
 
nivolumab levels. ADAs against LAG3.1-G4P were not detected in the exploratory study. In the 
definitive combination study, ADAs against relatlimab were detected in 24/40 monkeys administered 
either relatlimab alone or in combination with nivolumab. The presence of relatlimab-specific antibodies 
had no impact on relatlimab toxicokinetics. In the second definitive GLP study, ADAs against relatlimab 
were detected in 20/24 monkeys. In general, the presence of treatment-emergent ADAs had no 
substantial impact on systemic exposures, although substantially high levels of ADAs may have led to 
decreased serum relatlimab concentrations in one low-dose monkey. This animal exhibited decreased 
activity, hunched posture, emesis and tremors. These findings are not considered treatment-related, 
but rather secondary to treatment-emergent ADAs with subsequent compliment activation. Since 
relatlimab and nivolumab are human antibodies, these treatment-emergent ADAs in monkeys can be 
expected and are likely not relevant for humans. 
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
According to the ICH Guideline S6(R1), no genotoxicity studies were performed for relatlimab.  
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
According to the ICH Guideline S1A, S6(R1) and S9, no carcinogenicity studies were performed for 
relatlimab.  
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
According to the ICH Guideline S9, no studies of fertility and early embryonic development were 
performed with relatlimab and nivolumab. 
During the pivotal 1-month and 3-month repeat-dose toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys (Section 
2.5.4.2), no relatlimab-related findings in the reproductive organs were observed. However, one male 
dosed IV QW 100 mg/kg relatlimab (MoE: 97), in combination with 50 mg/kg nivolumab (MoE: 13) 
showed histopathological signs of epididymitis (i.e. mixed-cell inflammation of the epididymis, seminal 
vesicles, and testes).  
One exploratory pregnancy study and one definitive GLP-compliant embryo-foetal development study 
were conducted in mice. These studies were designed using syngeneic and allogeneic breeding models. 
Based on the lack of cross-reactivity in rodents, surrogate anti-LAG-3 antibodies (mLAG3.4 mIgG1-
D265A or C9B7W) were used. In the exploratory pregnancy study, ADAs were detected in all treated 
groups, but the effect on serum mLAG3.4 mIgG1-D265A levels was not determined. However, there 
were no ADA-mediated toxicities. In the definitive embryo-foetal development study, ADAs were 
detected in 8/41 allogeneic animals and 6/22 syngeneic animals, with no substantial effect on anti-
LAG-3 C9B7W serum levels. 
Anti-LAG-3 antibodies were well-tolerated by dams at the highest dose tested and no maternal or 
developmental toxicities were detected, with resulting maternal and developmental NOAELs of 50 
mg/kg (mLAG3.4 mIgG1-D265A) and 51.5 mg/kg (C9B7W). It was noted that syngeneic and 
allogeneic breedings resulted in comparable outcomes, despite the expected risk of higher foetal loss 
with allogeneic breedings. Considering that the setup of the studies was acceptable and that nivolumab 
use during pregnancy is not recommended (see below), additional non-clinical reproductive toxicity 
data were not warranted. 
Assessment report  
EMA/720884/2022  
Page 39/147 
 
 
 
Results from the in vitro MLR (study IO00197, Section 2.5.2.1) showed that the combination of 
relatlimab and nivolumab may increase effector T cell activation compared to regulatory T-cell 
activation.  
According to the ICH Guideline S9, no studies of pre- and postnatal toxicology were performed with 
relatlimab and nivolumab. No juvenile toxicity studies were performed with relatlimab and nivolumab. 
2.5.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic data was collected in the three repeat-dose toxicity (IV) studies and local tolerance (SC) 
study in cynomolgus monkeys, and in the definitive IP embryo-foetal development study in mice. 
Sufficient exposure levels were achieved for both relatlimab and nivolumab in cynomolgus monkeys. In 
general, systemic relatlimab exposure increased dose-proportionally between 30 and 100 mg/kg, with 
no substantial sex differences. Relatlimab exposure margins based on the AUC reached 85-100 fold 
after 1 month and 183-260 fold after 3 months, at the highest tested dose of 100 mg/kg/week. 
However, for interpretation of safety data and extrapolation of findings to humans, it should be 
considered that relatlimab showed significant (256-fold) lower affinity for the monkey epitope than for 
the human epitope in activated T cells. Nivolumab exposure margins reached 10-14 folds after 1 
month, at the highest tested dose of 50 mg/kg/week. No clear gender effect was observed in monkeys. 
In mice, C9B7W exposure margins reached 13-fold, at the highest tested dose of 51.5 mg/kg. 
2.5.4.7.  Local tolerance  
In a subcutaneous single-dose toxicity study, relatlimab was not considered a local irritant. This is in 
line with results from IV administration of relatlimab in monkeys (Section 2.5.4.2). 
2.5.4.8.  Other toxicity studies 
The potential induction of ADAs has been described in the pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies (Section 
2.5.4.2). No additional antigenicity studies were warranted. 
No dedicated immunotoxicity studies with relatlimab were conducted. Instead, evaluation and 
discussion on immunotoxicity was incorporated into the repeat-dose toxicity studies (Section 2.5.4.2) 
in accordance with the ICH S8 and ICH S6(R1) guidelines. 
In line with ICH M3 (R2), no studies to evaluate the potential for relatlimab dependence were 
conducted. 
No studies to evaluate relatlimab metabolites were warranted. 
No non-clinical studies were conducted to assess relatlimab-related impurities.  
Relatlimab alone or in combination with nivolumab does not possess agonistic potential to induce 
cytokine release syndrome when presented to in vitro human PBMCs. In line with this observation, 
there was no significant T-cell, B-cell or NK-cell activation.  
The applicant performed a tissue cross-reactivity study of relatlimab with a panel of human and 
cynomolgus monkey tissues. Staining was observed in tissues containing LAG-3 expressing immune 
cells in the plasma membrane, as expected. LAG-3-specific staining was also observed in the 
adenohypophysis of the human pituitary in a pilot tissue cross reactivity study. In the pivotal cross- 
reactivity study, relatlimab-FITC staining of endocrine cell epithelial cytoplasm and cytoplasmic 
granules in the adenohypophysis of the pituitary was also observed. LAG-3 mRNA is known to be 
expressed in the human pituitary.

2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In accordance with the current Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products 
for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), relatlimab and nivolumab are monoclonal antibodies that 
only consist of naturally occurring substances (amino acids) and are therefore exempt from the ERA 
requirements.  
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
The applicant submitted information with regard to binding of relatlimab to LAG-3, the inhibition of the 
binding to its ligands and the functional consequences (T-cell inhibition), demonstrating the proof of 
principle. 
In syngeneic tumour mouse models, the proof of concept was shown from which became clear that 
combination therapy with nivolumab is more effective.  
Although the applicant has submitted data to support the disruption of the LAG-3/FGL-1 binding, FGL-1 
is not included as a LAG-3 ligand in 5.1 of the SmPC. LAG-3 binds to its ligands, such as major 
histocompatibility complex Class II. It is noted that the role of the interaction between FGL-1 and LAG-
3 is not yet fully clear. FGL-1 is considered implicitly referred to in the word ligands. SmPC 5.1 refers 
only explicitly to the functionality of the interaction (and abrogation thereof) with LAG-3 and MHC-II, 
because this interaction and its implications has been the most studied. 
Besides expression on (exhausted) CD-4 T-cells, LAG-3 is also expressed on the membrane of 
plasmacytoid DCs. According to the applicant the presence of pDCs has been described in the tumour 
microenvironment (TME) across many human cancers and is generally associated with poor clinical 
outcome. Tumour-infiltrating pDCs exhibit a dysfunctional state as characterised by an inability to 
produce type 1 IFN. Plasmacytoid pDCs have been identified in the TME of primary melanoma and in 
melanoma metastases, but the role for LAG-3 in regulating pDC biology remains poorly understood, 
including within the TME. Plasmacytoid DCs isolated from tumour-invaded draining lymph node and 
cutaneous melanoma lesions were enriched (42-55%) for cell surface LAG-3-expression (LAG-3+) and 
these LAG3+ pDC preferentially localise near and interact directly with major histocompatibility class 
II-expressing (MHC class II+) melanoma cells and to display a partially activated phenotype, 
characterised by high levels of TLR-independent IL-6 production, and limited type 1 IFN. IL-6 is a 
pleiotropic immunomodulatory cytokine. Chronically elevated levels of IL-6 can promote tumour cell 
survival, drive recruitment of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and induce angiogenesis and tumour 
vascularisation, and is a poor prognostic factor in many tumours, including melanoma. MHC class II is 
frequently expressed by melanoma cells, and thereby may contribute to immune suppression within 
the TME via engagement of LAG-3 on pDCs. Therefore relatlimab, which blocks LAG-3 from binding to 
MHC class II, may function to reduce pDC-mediated immunosuppression within the TME and promote 
anti-tumour efficacy. In addition, related to pDC biology and the safety of Opdualag, pDC 
hyperactivation has been described in autoimmune diseases. The impact of Opdualag administration to 
melanoma patients with underlying autoimmune disease remains uncertain, and a reason for excluding 
patients with known/ suspected autoimmune disease from the study. Therefore, section 4.4 of the 
SmPC includes the precaution that the administration of a combination of relatlimab with nivolumab 
(Opdualag) should be undertaken with caution in these populations after careful consideration of the 
potential benefit/risk on an individual basis. 
The data from study BDX-1408-245 demonstrate the ability of relatlimab to block, in a dose-dependent 
manner, LAG-3-mediated inhibition of T-cells.

Several syngeneic tumour models have been tested in the in vivo studies in mice. According to the 
applicant the syngeneic tumour models used in testing the immune checkpoint inhibitors commonly 
share features of the human TME. These include a varying number of mutation-derived neo-epitopes, a 
broad range of immune cell infiltration profiles (e.g., ‘hot’ v. ‘cold’ tumours), and a broad range of 
infiltrating immunosuppressive cell types (e.g., dysfunctional tumour-reactive T cells and regulatory T 
cells). The chosen syngeneic tumour models thus represent different aspects of human TME across and 
within tumour types, including melanoma and that thereby the preclinical studies are relevant to study 
the mechanism of action of Opdualag in melanoma patients and establish proof of concept for the 
therapeutic efficacy of the combination in this indication. Together, the four models in which a 
combination of anti-PD-1 and anti-LAG-3 were effective, aim to support the rationale for treatment of 
melanoma. Not because of expression of (one of) the target, but because of the reflection of different 
features of the TME. This approach can be followed, and the provided explanation is regarded 
sufficient. 
The omission of studies addressing a secondary pharmacologic mechanism of action of relatlimab can 
be endorsed as its target and mechanism of action are selective. 
While some effect was observed with relatlimab alone, the results from the combination studies 
highlight the potential for enhancing the immunologic effects when relatlimab is administered in 
combination with nivolumab. Furthermore, these results are consistent with in vitro studies 
demonstrating the potentiation by relatlimab of nivolumab-mediated T-cell responses, and in vivo 
study data demonstrating enhanced antitumour activity from the combined administration of LAG-3 
and PD-1 blocking antibodies. The effect seems synergistic, suggesting that T-cell inhibition occurs via 
more pathways and that these two antibodies do not affect each other in a negative way. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic profile of relatlimab was only characterised in cynomolgus monkeys with 
relatlimab administered alone (30 and 100 mg/kg, IV) or in combination with nivolumab. In addition, 
since relatlimab does not bind to mouse LAG-3, in vivo efficacy tumour models and safety EFD studies 
in mouse were conducted with a surrogate antibody, 19C7 or C9B7W. 
Upon IV administration to monkey, relatlimab showed a biphasic decline, with an initial distribution 
phase, followed by a very slow elimination phase. Relatlimab systemic exposure in the weekly dosing 
period (AUC0-168) increased dose-proportionally in both the 4-week and 3-month study. No clear or 
consistent sex difference was observed on serum exposure. After 4-week IV multiple (QW) dosing, the 
volume of distribution, as estimated by population PK analysis, was low (i.e 0.072 L/kg), about 2–fold 
the plasma volume in monkey, and in line with human. Serum clearance in monkey was very low (i.e. 
0.12 ml/h/kg) and is about 1.5-fold lower in humans. Terminal elimination half-life (T1/2) in monkeys 
was about 20 – 30 days and was ~25.7 days in human. Exposure (AUC) accumulation ratios upon 
multiple dosing were ~2.2-fold (Day 22) in the 4-week study and 4.4-fold (D85) in the 3-month study 
indicating that steady state was not yet reached in the 4-week study, which is in line with the dosing 
period and the long elimination half-life. Steady state exposures were generally achieved by Day 50. In 
the 4-week study, relatlimab (100 mg/kg) treatment was also combined with nivolumab (50 mg/kg), 
and this did not impact the exposure or accumulation ratio of relatlimab. Anti-drug antibody (ADA) 
formation against relatlimab was found in about 70% to 80% of the treated monkeys in both the 4-
week and the 3-month QW repeat-dose toxicology study. The high incidence of ADAs is not considered 
relevant for the clinical situation. Relatlimab transfer to the foetus or to maternal milk was not 
examined. However, as relatlimab is an IgG, this is expected to occur.

Toxicology 
In the pivotal 1-month combination study, 1 male dosed IV QW at 100 mg/kg relatlimab (MoE: 97) in 
combination with 50 mg/kg nivolumab (MoE: 13), was prematurely sacrificed due to moribund 
conditions and histopathology revealed signs of central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis 
(lymphoplasmacytic inflammation of the choroid plexus; lymphohistiocytic inflammation of the 
vasculature of the brain parenchyma, meninges, and spinal cord) and epididymitis. Additional findings 
in the combination group were irreversible lymphoplasmacytic inflammation of the choroid plexus in 
the brain in both sexes and lymphohistiocytic inflammation of the vasculature of the brain parenchyma 
in 1 male monkey. Irreversible lymphoplasmacytic inflammation of choroid plexus in the brain was also 
observed in multiple animals dosed with 50 mg/kg nivolumab only, but not in animals dosed with 
relatlimab only. None of the animals displayed abnormal neurological clinical findings. The applicant 
indicated that the target organ profile in different species is not fully understood, but that the 
combined immunostimulatory effects of nivolumab and relatlimab are not unexpected. Variable 
immune-mediated adverse effects are also observed after treatment with other checkpoint inhibitors, 
which are not always predictive for specific target organ toxicities in humans.  
Although LAG-3 inhibition in mice did not result in maternal or developmental toxicity, the risk for 
adverse human pregnancy outcome associated with relatlimab + nivolumab FDC administration is 
considered to be of concern. The relevant argumentation is: (1) LAG-3 is likely to have a role in 
maintaining maternal tolerance to the developing foetus; (2) nivolumab has been shown to increase 
third trimester pregnancy loss in cynomolgus monkeys; (3) both relatlimab and nivolumab are IgG4 
antibodies, and are likely to be transported through the placenta. The use of relatlimab + nivolumab 
FDC in pregnancy is not recommended. Human IgG4 is also excreted in milk and thus nursing may 
result in relatlimab and nivolumab exposure to the infant through FcRn-mediated antibody 
internalisation. Women are therefore advised not to breastfeed while receiving relatlimab + nivolumab 
FDC in the period of anticipated IgG4 excretion in milk (SmPC section 4.6). 
In conclusion, while relatlimab alone is well tolerated, the combination with nivolumab (and to a 
certain extent nivolumab alone) resulted in adverse immune-mediated toxicity. The applicant further 
indicated that clinical monitoring of all patients for neurologic signs and symptoms has been 
emphasised and should continue and managed using BMS neurological adverse event management 
algorithms. This is considered adequate. The enhanced immunostimulatory effects of nivolumab and 
relatlimab are adequately reflected in SmPC Section 5.3. 
Although the effect on fertility is not known, the potential relevance of epididymitis for the clinic was 
mentioned as a significant non-clinical safety finding in the RMP. 
In the pivotal cross- reactivity study, relatlimab-FITC staining of endocrine cell epithelial cytoplasm and 
cytoplasmic granules in the adenohypophysis of the pituitary was also observed. LAG-3 mRNA is 
known to be expressed in the human pituitary. However, since relatlimab is not expected to have 
access to the cytoplasmic compartment in vivo, this finding is not anticipated to have clinical 
significance. 
Environmental risk assessment 
The active substance is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter the concentration or 
distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, relatlimab is not expected to pose a risk to 
the environment, also not in the combination with nivolumab (also a natural substance) in the 
Opdualag formulation.

2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No animal studies were conducted with nivolumab in combination with relatlimab to evaluate potential 
carcinogenicity, genotoxicity or reproductive and developmental toxicity. This is considered acceptable 
and in line with relevant guidelines. In a 1-month study in monkeys dosed with nivolumab and 
relatlimab, inflammation within the central nervous system (choroid plexus, vasculature, meninges, 
spinal cord) and the reproductive tract (epididymis, seminal vesicles and testes) was observed. 
Although safety margins were not established for these effects with the combination, they occurred at 
doses that suppose exposure levels significantly higher (13 folds for nivolumab and 97 folds for 
relatlimab) than those reached in patients. In an embryo foetal toxicity study in mice using murine anti 
LAG 3 antibodies, no maternal or developmental effects were observed. The effects of relatlimab on 
prenatal and postnatal development have not been evaluated, however, based on the mechanism of 
action, blockade of LAG 3 with relatlimab can have a similar negative effect as nivolumab on 
pregnancy.  
In conclusion it can be considered that all non-clinical aspects were sufficiently addressed, and relevant 
information has been adequately reflected in the SmPC.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK of relatlimab was characterised by non-compartmental PK analyses of individual subject 
concentration-time profile data from Phase 1/2a Study CA224020 and by popPK analysis using pooled 
concentration data from Study CA224020 and Phase 2/3 Study CA224047 in subjects with solid 
tumours who received relatlimab doses of 20 to 800 mg Q2W and 160 to 1440 mg Q4W either as 
monotherapy or in combination with nivolumab doses of 80 or 240 mg Q2W or 480 mg Q4W. 
Analytical methods  
Serum levels of relatlimab in studies CA224020 and CA224047 were quantitated with a 
chemiluminescence ELISA method (MTD021). The ELISA assay measures relatlimab in human serum 
using capture antibody (coating onto a plate) and a biotin-labeled detection antibody. The assay range 
in undiluted human serum is from 50 to 3200 ng/ml. QCs were included at concentrations of 150, 500 
and 2400 ng/ml. 
Assessment report  
EMA/720884/2022  
Page 45/147 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During validation, dilutions from the 500,000 ng/ml QC were designed to obtain samples falling within 
the calibration curve range (1,953, 488, 122 ng/ml). A hook effect was not observed at analyte 
concentration up to 500,000 ng/ml. 
The presence of nivolumab at 300 µg/ml or a ratio of 2000:1 (300:0.15 µg/ml) of 
nivolumab:relatlimab in serum did not interfere with relatlimab quantitation. In the samples tested for 
relatlimab concentrations in study CA224020 and CA224047, the highest observed concentration of 
nivolumab did not exceed 300 µg/ml or a ratio of 2000:1, thus, there was no risk of nivolumab 
interference with relatlimab detection.  
This method was used to analyze all human serum samples in the Phase 1/2a CA224020 and Phase 
2/3 CA224047 studies that had PK sample collection for relatlimab. The method performed well in 
studies CA224020 and CA224047 and met the acceptance criteria with an ISR passing rate of 91.1% 
and 97.8%, respectively.  
Serum levels of nivolumab in studies CA224020 and CA224047 were quantitated with an 
electrochemiluminescence (ECL) ligand-binding assay (LBA) method using an 
electrochemiluminescence platform (ICD 416 and MTD035). Both methods (ICD 416 and MTD035) 
were cross-validated to verify and confirm acceptable accuracy and precision across methods and 
laboratories. These ECL assays measure nivolumab in human serum using biotin-labeled capture 
antibody and a ruthenium-labeled detection antibody. The assay range is from 0.2 µg/ml to 6.5 µg/ml 
in undiluted human serum. In both methods, QCs were included at concentrations of 0.6, 1.5 and 4.8 
µg/ml. 
Further, during validation, dilutions from a 100 µg/ml QC were designed to generate samples with 
nivolumab concentrations (amongst others) that fall above and within the calibration curve range 
(5.00, 1.00, 0.500 and 0.250 μg/ml). A hook effect was not observed at analyte concentration up to 
100 μg/ml. 
The presence of relatlimab at 200 µg/ml or a ratio of 333:1 (200:0.6 µg/ml) of relatlimab: nivolumab 
in serum did not interfere with nivolumab quantitation when tested at nivolumab concentrations 
equivalent to the low quality control (0.6 µg/ml) and high quality control (4.8 µg/ml). In the samples 
tested for nivolumab concentrations in studies CA224020 and CA224047, the highest observed 
concentration of relatlimab did not exceed 200 µg/ml or a ratio of 333:1. Thus, there was no risk of 
relatlimab interference with nivolumab measurements.  
Method ICD 416 was used to analyze all human serum samples in the CA224020 study that had 
pharmacokinetic sample collection for nivolumab, and method MTD035 was used to analyze all human 
serum samples in the CA224047 study that had pharmacokinetic sample collection for nivolumab. 
PopPK models  
The PK of relatlimab, alone and in combination with nivolumab, was characterised by a 2-
compartment, zero-order IV infusion PK model with parallel nonlinear and time-varying CL. A trend of 
decreasing contribution of relatlimab nonlinear CL to the total CL with dose was observed. At the 
recommended dose (relatlimab 160 mg Q4W in combination with nivolumab), nonlinear CL represents 
~31% of total CL of relatlimab. The relatlimab popPK model is sufficiently validated, provides a 
sufficient description of the relatlimab exposure data with reasonable shrinkage for CL and Vc 29.0 and 
20.2%, and is considered suitable for investigation towards the consequences of various covariates on 
relatlimab exposure.  
The PK of nivolumab, alone and in combination with relatlimab, was characterised by a 2-
compartment, zero-order IV infusion PK model with time-varying CL. Nivolumab CL decreases over 
time with maximal reduction of 18% in adult 1L MEL subjects. Nivolumab baseline CL in subjects 
Assessment report  
EMA/720884/2022  
Page 46/147 
 
 
 
receiving nivolumab monotherapy or relatlimab SAV + nivolumab (Opdivo) was similar (≤ 5% 
difference) compared with subjects receiving relatlimab + nivolumab FDC. The popPK model is 
sufficiently validated, provides a sufficient description of the nivolumab exposure data with reasonable 
shrinkage of 11.2% and 22.7% for CL and Vc, respectively, and is considered suitable for investigation 
towards the consequences of various covariates on nivolumab exposure.  
In the nivolumab popPK model, paediatric PK data were included. It is apparent that adolescent (≥ 12 
to 17 years) and paediatric (< 12 years) subjects showed 36% and 62% lower baseline CL, 
respectively, than adult 1L MEL subjects. In addition, the adolescent (≥ 12 to 17 years) and paediatric 
subjects (< 12 years) had 16% and 32% lower Vc, respectively, than adult subjects. 
Absorption  
Relatlimab and nivolumab plasma exposures obtained from a single agent vial (co-administered) or 
given as FDC were comparable (Table 3). Therefore, no effect of drug product (single agent vial vs 
FDC) on the PK of relatlimab and nivolumab is present. 
Table 3. Relatlimab and nivolumab PK parameter comparison between SAV coadministration and FDC 
cohorts for relatlimab + nivolumab 160/480 mg Q4W (Study CA224020 part D1) 
Distribution 
The geometric mean value for volume of distribution at steady state is 6.65 L both for relatlimab and 
nivolumab. The nivolumab volume of distribution at steady state in adolescents is 5.16 L. These values 
are consistent with the expected distribution of mAbs limited to the vascular space. 
Elimination 
Relatlimab and nivolumab are mAbs that are expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino 
acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG. No active metabolites are 
therefore expected. 
Based on non-compartmental PK analysis in patients with solid tumours, the relatlimab t1/2 at doses 
between 320-1440 mg was approximately 14 to 27 days. Based on popPK analysis, for subjects who 
received relatlimab/nivolumab 160/480 mg Q4W, the relatlimab effective half-life both was 25.7 days 
and for nivolumab 26.4 days. The t1/2 predicted for nivolumab when given in combination with 
relatlimab is in line with the t1/2 reported for nivolumab when given as monotherapy of 25 days (Opdivo 
EPAR). Both for relatlimab and nivolumab, the t1/2 is in line with the plasma half-life of circulating 
endogenous human IgG of approximately 21 days. 
Assessment report  
EMA/720884/2022  
Page 47/147 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on popPK analyses, single dose clearance is 6.1 ml/h for relatlimab and 9.6 ml/h for nivolumab. 
Both for relatlimab and nivolumab, clearance decreased at steady state (to 5.5 ml/h, 9.7% lower for 
relatlimab, and to 7.6 ml/h, 21% lower for nivolumab). Nivolumab clearance under steady state, when 
given in combination with relatlimab, is comparable to that reported for nivolumab as single agent (7.9 
ml/h, EPAR nivolumab). 
Based on popPK analyses, adolescent (≥ 12 to < 18 years) and paediatric (< 12 years) subjects 
showed 36% (95% CI: 22.1-47.5) and 62% (95% CI: 51.9-71.3) lower baseline CL of nivolumab, 
respectively, than adult unresectable or metastatic melanoma subjects. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Relatlimab exposure increased approximately dose proportionally when given as monotherapy (20-800 
mg) or in combination with nivolumab across the studied dose ranges (160-1440 mg). Based on 
information from the Opdivo SmPC, the pharmacokinetics of nivolumab is linear in the dose range of 
0.1 to 10 mg/kg (i.e. 7.5 to 750 mg for a 75 kg patient). Applying the 160/480 mg Q4W posology, 
relatlimab exposure reaches steady-state after approximately 16 weeks (Table 4). The observed 
relatlimab accumulation ratio of in the range of 1.3 to 1.7 is in line with the t1/2 of approximately 25 
days and the once every 4 weeks administration schedule.

Renal impairment. Considering the fact that both relatlimab and nivolumab are mAbs, an effect of 
renal impairment on clearance is not expected. Indeed, based on popPK analysis, renal impairment 
(normal vs mild and moderate) resulted in a 20% decreased CL of relatlimab or nivolumab, which is 
considered not clinically relevant. The impact of severe renal impairment on the PK of relatlimab or 
nivolumab is unclear given the limited number of subjects were enrolled with severe impairment.  
Hepatic impairment. Considering the fact that both relatlimab and nivolumab are mAbs, an effect of 
hepatic impairment on clearance is not expected. Indeed, based on popPK analysis, hepatic 
impairment (normal vs mild and moderate) resulted in a 10% decreased CL of relatlimab or nivolumab, 
which is considered not clinically relevant. The impact of severe hepatic impairment on the PK of 
relatlimab or nivolumab is unclear given the limited number of subjects were enrolled with severe 
impairment.  
Gender. Based on popPK analyses, exposure to relatlimab and nivolumab was not affected to a 
clinically relevant extent by gender.  
Race. Based on popPK analyses, exposure to relatlimab and nivolumab was not affected to a clinically 
relevant extent by race.  
Weight. Patient weight, as indicated in the popPK report, ranged from 51.9 to 111 kg. Due to the flat 
dosing, both for relatlimab and nivolumab, Cavg decreases with an increase in body weight and 
increases with a decrease in body weight. Within this weight range, the relatlimab Cavgss were 26% 
higher in subjects with lower body weight (at 5th percentile, i.e. 50-55 kg) and were ~ 31% lower in 
subjects with higher body weight (at 95th percentile, i.e. 106-117 kg) relative to the exposure in 
typical subjects at a body weight of 75 kg. For nivolumab, these differences were <20%.

Elderly.  
A summary of the number of elderly patients included in the provided clinical trials and providing 
dense or sparse PK data for relatlimab and nivolumab was provided (Table 5 and Table 6). The 
majority of elderly patients included in Studies CA224020 and CA224047 (505 and 591 for relatlimab 
and nivolumab, respectively) were aged ≥ 65 to < 75 years. Although at lower numbers, also patients 
aged ≥ 75 to < 85 (approximately 203 and 148, respectively) and patients aged ≥ 85 (approximately 
29 and 36, respectively) were included.

Number of Subjects (% of all subjects in the analysis) 
Adolescents. With respect to nivolumab, PK data in children and adolescents were available for patients 
with solid tumours. These paediatric PK data were included in the nivolumab popPK model. Comparison 
of the exposure data in the nivolumab popPK model indicate that adolescent subjects had 24% lower 
CL0, 28% lower CLss, and 28% lower VC than corresponding parameters of adult subjects. Further 
simulations indicated that the 6 mg/kg up to 480 mg Q4W posology in adolescents provided nivolumab 
exposures that were comparable with median adult exposures, with median exposures of adolescent 
subjects at each body weight group contained within the adult median exposure range of high body 
weight (≥ 100 kg) and low body weight (40-50 kg) adults (Table 7).

a The range of geometric mean exposure of high-body-weight adult (≥ 100 kg) and low-body-weight adult (40-50

With respect to relatlimab, no adolescent PK data were available. Therefore, these simulations were 
performed with a revised version of the relatlimab popPK model, which incorporated the paediatric 
effects on CL and VC determined in the nivolumab popPK analysis (i.e., adolescent subjects had 24% 
lower CL0, 28% lower CLss, and 28% lower VC than corresponding parameters of adult subjects). The 
applicant ‘s arguments for accepting this strategy are that both nivolumab and relatlimab are IgG4 
mAbs with similar mechanisms of distribution and non-specific elimination. Assuming a comparable 
effect of age/weight on nivolumab and relatlimab PK, relatlimab simulations indicated that the 2 mg/kg 
up to 160 mg Q4W posology in adolescents provided relatlimab exposures that were comparable with 
median adult exposures, with median exposures of adolescent subjects at each body weight group >50 
kg contained within the adult median exposure range of high body weight (≥ 100 kg) and low body 
weight (40-50 kg) adults (Table 8).

60- vs 30-minute infusion. During clinical development, relatlimab and nivolumab were administered 
via a 60-min infusion. For registration, the applicant aims for a 30 min infusion period. Based on the 
provided simulations, no relevant difference in exposure to relatlimab and nivolumab is expected using 
either of the two infusion periods. From a PK perspective, relatlimab and nivolumab Cmin and Cavg data 
obtained by using a 60-minute administration period are considered relevant for the 30 minutes 
administration period as well. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Antibodies have a low potential for pharmacokinetic drug interactions as they are not metabolised by 
liver cytochrome P450 (CYP) or other drug metabolizing enzymes. Therefore, it is unlikely that they 
have an effect on CYPs or other metabolizing enzymes in terms of inhibition or induction. As such, no 
formal DDI study was conducted. 
The across-study assessment of PK interaction between relatlimab and nivolumab were conducted 
through popPK analyses using pooled data from CA224020 and CA224047. There was no clinically 
relevant PK interaction between relatlimab and nivolumab when administered in combination. 
Relatlimab baseline CL in subjects receiving relatlimab monotherapy and relatlimab SAV + nivolumab 
(sequential or co-administered) was similar to subjects receiving rela+nivo FDC (≤ 5% and ≤ 18%

difference, respectively). Similarly, nivolumab baseline CL in subjects receiving nivolumab 
monotherapy or relatlimab SAV + nivolumab was similar (≤ 5% difference) compared with subjects 
receiving rela+nivo FDC. There was no clinically relevant PK interaction between relatlimab and 
nivolumab when administered in combination.  
Therapeutic proteins that are modulators of cytokines may indirectly affect expression of cytochrome 
P450 enzyme. The extent of cytokine modulation by rela+nivo was explored with the available data of 
cytokines that have been reported to indirectly affect expression or stability of cytochrome P450 
enzyme18 in Studies CA224020 and CA224047. No trend of treatment-associated changes was 
observed for IL-6, IL-10, IL-1β or TNF-α (data not shown). 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Binding of relatlimab to the LAG-3 receptor releases the LAG-3 mediated inhibition of immune 
response by blocking its interaction with ligands. Binding of nivolumab to the PD-1 receptor blocks its 
interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2, releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune 
response, including the anti-tumour immune response. 
In preclinical studies, combined relatlimab (anti-LAG3) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1) mediated inhibition 
enabled T-cell activation, increased interferon gamma (IFNγ) production, and restored effector function 
of exhausted T cells, more than the effects of either antibody alone. LAG-3 blockade potentiated the 
anti-tumour activity of PD-1 blockade in murine syngeneic tumour models, inhibiting tumour growth 
and promoting tumour regression. Hereby, the mode of action is to some extent demonstrated.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
In Study CA224020, a relatlimab dose-dependent increase in LAG-3 receptor occupancy (RO) on CD8+ 
memory T cells was demonstrated. Additionally, exposure-response analysis of peripheral RO predicts 
> 80% ROavgss with the recommended rela + nivo dose of 160/480 mg Q4W (see exposure response 
relationships below).  
No consistent treatment-induced changes were observed for IFNγ or IFNγ-induced soluble factors and 
chemokines in subjects treated with relatlimab monotherapy, except for a modest increase of CXCL9. 
Further, no apparent treatment-induced change of T cell subsets was observed for any subject treated 
with relatlimab monotherapy, at doses up to 800 mg Q2W. In subjects treated with rela+nivo, IFNγ 
and IFNγ-induced chemokines and soluble factors (CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, and IL-2Rα) increased 
consistently with across all dosing regimens evaluated, although no dose-dependency was observed. A 
consistent trend of increase in proliferating and activated CD4+ and CD8+ central and effector memory 
T cell subset was observed on Day 8 after the first dose of combination therapy ranging from rela+nivo 
20/80 mg to 160/480, no clear dose-dependent changes were observed (limited number of samples at 
each dose combination). 
In Study CA224047, a consistent decrease of free sLAG3 was observed after the administration of 
rela+nivo FDC, which was not shown in subjects treated with nivolumab monotherapy. The median 
increase of IFNγ was approximately doubled after the administration of rela+nivo FDC compared to 
nivolumab alone. Similar treatment-induced increases were also observed for IFNγ-inducible 
chemokines and soluble factors, including MIG, IP10, and IL-2Rα, but the difference in levels of 
increase was less significant between subjects treated with rela+nivo FDC or nivolumab monotherapy.

Effect on corrected QT interval (QTc)  
The effect of relatlimab and relatlimab in combination with nivolumab on ventricular repolarisation was 
studied in the phase 1/2a study CA224020, based on the dose escalation parts A and B using rela SAV 
+ nivolumab product. Relatilimab monotherapy had no effect on the QTc interval duration; however, 
there was limited QTc data (N=7) and therefore the monotherapy data was combined with data from 
rela+nivo (N = 65) in the concentration-QTc analysis. Overall, QT prolongation was not observed for 
relatlimab up to 800 mg Q2W as monotherapy and up to 1440 mg Q4W in combination with 480 mg 
nivolumab. There were no trends of change from baseline in QTcF, PR, and QRS intervals among all 
evaluable subjects, and no subject assessed had a ΔQTcF > 60 ms. No electrocardiogram (ECG)-
assessed patient had an adverse event (AE) associated with abnormal ECG findings potentially related 
to proarrhythmia. The upper limit of the 90% CI for mean ΔQTcF was <10 ms over the range of 
observed relatlimab concentrations. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
Receptor-binding. With respect to the exposure-peripheral receptor occupancy, the predicted 
peripheral LAG-3 RO was similar between relatlimab/nivolumab 80/240 mg Q2W regimen and the 
requested relatlimab/nivolumab 160/480 mg Q4W dose regimen. LAG-3 RO was higher following a 
dose of relatlimab/nivolumab 480/480 mg Q4W as compared to 160/480 mg Q4W (Table 9).

Efficacy. With respect to the exposure-progression free survival, PFS was associated with exposure to 
relatlimab, resulting in a longer PFS in relatlimab + nivolumab combination treatment compared to 
nivolumab monotherapy. Predicted HRs of PFS were similar across the range of exposures produced by 
relatlimab/nivolumab 80/240 mg Q2W, 160/480mg Q4W, and 480/480 mg Q4W, suggesting a flat 
relatlimab E-R relationship with respect to PFS (Figure 1).

Safety. With respect to the exposure-Grade 2+ immune-mediated adverse events, as well as the 
exposure Grade 3+ drug-related adverse events, the risk of these Gr2 and Gr3 AEs was significantly 
associated with relatlimab and nivolumab exposure, resulting in a higher risk in relatlimab + nivolumab 
combination compared with nivolumab monotherapy. Nivolumab exposure was not significantly 
associated with the risk of Gr3+ Drug-related adverse events. The risk for these Gr2 and Gr3 AEs was 
similar across the range of relatlimab exposures produced by the studied combination dosing regimen 
in Studies CA224020 and CA224047, supporting a flat relatlimab E-R relationship over this exposure 
range (Figure 3, Figure 4).

2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Analytical methods. The analytical methods for relatlimab and nivolumab appear sufficiently validated 
and yielded acceptable accuracy and precision. The presence of nivolumab at relevant concentrations 
did not interfere with relatlimab quantitation and vice versa. A hook effect was excluded. For both 
analytical assays, the distribution of the QCs is not completely in line with requirements, with a QC at 
500 (16% of ULQ) and 2400 ng/ml (75% of ULQ) within the calibration range of 150 to 3200 ng/ml. 
No QC around 50% is present. Likewise, for the nivolumab assay, QCs were present at 1.5 (23% of 
ULQ) and 4.8 µg/ml (74% of ULQ) within the calibration range of 0.2 to 6.5 µg/ml. However, during 
validation of the relatlimab assay, a QC diluted to 1953 ng/ml (61%) was tested as well, yielding 
acceptable results. Therefore, the absence of a QC around 50% of the ULQ is considered not a critical 
issue, and the outcome of the bioanalytical assays is considered sufficiently reliable for its intended 
purpose.  
PK variability. Interindividual variability was from moderate to high (34-53%) both for relatlimab and 
nivolumab.  
Assessment report  
EMA/720884/2022  
Page 55/147 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Excretion. The non-compartmental analysis showed that relatlimab t1/2 had an inverse relationship 
with dose, since 1440 mg Q4W of relatlimab in combination with nivolumab showed a t1/2 of 14 days, 
whereas 320 mg Q4W in combination with nivolumab showed a t1/2 of 27 days. The shorter t1/2 as 
dose increases is unexpected, because the opposite effect would be expected in drugs that show a 
target-mediated elimination. It is agreed that the number of patients (2) is quite limited to obtain 
definitive conclusions but this result is confirmed in the population PK analysis, where with the 
proposed dose (160 mg Q4W in combination with nivolumab) the estimated half-life is 25 days.  
Dose proportionality. A dose-proportionality effect was observed on relatlimab exposure when 
administered as monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab (Q2W and Q4W). The overall impact 
of dose-dependent target mediated CL on relatlimab exposure at the proposed dosing regimen 160 mg 
Q4W has also been evaluated, which represents around 31% of the overall clearance.  
Pharmacokinetics in the target population.  
Relatlimab population PK model 
A base, full and final (or refined) population PK model allowed to characterise first the structural and 
inter-individual and residual random effects, then the covariate analysis and ultimately a model 
refinement including only the significant covariate relationships. According to the parameter estimates, 
relative standard errors, shrinkage and condition number, the final popPK model of relatlimab 
confirmed the adequacy and parsimony of the popPK proposed. Moreover, based on the pcVPC the 
model is able to describe the observed data, despite the unbalanced distribution of experimental 
evidence across the different dose levels.  
Nivolumab population PK model 
The population PK model development of nivolumab includes the re-use of a base population PK model 
previously established in other cancer indications and the application of the full population PK model 
with all the significant covariates previously identified. The popPK model for nivolumab consists of a 
two-compartment model with zero-order IV infusion and linear and time-varying elimination pathway. 
Moderate (<50%) inter-individual variability has been characterised on several PK parameters. The full 
popPK model includes 22 covariate effects. However, several covariates are non-significant based on 
the 95%CI, which includes the null value (and those covariate effects were unreliable estimated based 
on the high RSE values (>50%)). However, a model comparison was conducted with a reduced version 
of the population PK model and no differences on final parameter estimates was detected. 
The popPK model of nivolumab for paediatric patients <18 years of age demonstrated a reasonably 
good performance based on the pc-VPC. However, a clinically relevant effect on CL for paediatric 
patients <12 and 12-18 years of age and Vc for paediatric patients <12 years of age was predicted. It 
is acknowledged that no indication has been claimed for paediatric patients <12 years of age. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment. The impact of severe renal impairment on the PK of relatlimab or nivolumab is 
unclear given the limited number of subjects enrolled with severe impairment. In light of the scarcity 
of data in the severe renal impairment population, combined with the observed trend up to 17% and 
15% difference on exposure metrics of nivolumab and relatlimab in patients with mild/moderate renal 
impairment, respectively, it is accepted that the information in the SmPC section 4.2 indicates that no 
dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment, and that no 
conclusions can be drawn for the severe renally impaired population, in line with the SmPC for Opdivo.  
Hepatic impairment. The impact of severe hepatic impairment on the PK of relatlimab or nivolumab is 
unclear given the limited number of subjects were enrolled with severe impairment. In light of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/720884/2022  
Page 56/147 
 
 
 
 
scarcity of data in the severe hepatic impairment population, it is accepted that the information in the 
SmPC section 4.2 indicates that no dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate 
hepatic impairment, and that no conclusions can be drawn for the severe hepatically impaired 
population, in line with the SmPC for Opdivo.  
Gender. Exposure to relatlimab and nivolumab was not affected to a clinically relevant extent by 
gender. For transparency reasons, the number of males/females (1056/657) included in the 
development programme for Opdualag is indicated in the SmPC section 5.2. The clinical relevance of 
gender for relatlimab showed a 19% lower CL in females compared to males, but no impact is 
expected in terms of response due to the flat exposure-response relationship.  
Race. Exposure to relatlimab and nivolumab was not affected to a clinically relevant extent by race. For 
transparency reasons, the number of the various ethnic subpopulations (1655 White, 41 Asian, 167 
African American) included in the development programme for Opdualag is indicated in the SmPC 
section 5.2. 
Weight. Patient weight, as indicated in the popPK report, ranged from 51.9 to 111 kg. Due to the flat 
dosing, both for relatlimab and nivolumab, Cavg decreases with an increase in body weight and 
increases with a decrease in body weight. The model estimated the relatlimab Cavgd28 was ~ 49% 
higher in extremely low body weight (~40 kg) and ~ 41% lower in extremely high body weight 
subjects (100 kg). For nivolumab, the model estimated Cavgd28 is ~ 43% higher in extremely low 
body weight and ~ 31% lower in extremely high body weight subjects. However, the E-R analysis for 
PFS and OS is relatively flat. Further, the safety profile of the combination of nivolumab and relatlimab 
in subjects with low body weight (< 50 kg) was generally similar to the safety profile in subjects with a 
body weight ≥ 50 - < 106 kg, and no consistent trend was observed for higher frequency or severity of 
AEs with lower body weight. Therefore, no dose-modifications or special caution appears necessary in 
the low and high weight patient population (see also Discussion on clinical safety).  
Age. Both for relatlimab and nivolumab, age was not considered a significant covariate in the popPK 
model. 
Adolescents. With respect to relatlimab, no adolescent PK data were available. Therefore, the popPK 
simulations were performed with a revised version of the relatlimab popPK model, which incorporated 
the paediatric effects on CL and VC determined in the nivolumab popPK analysis (i.e., adolescent 
subjects had 24% lower CL0, 28% lower CLss, and 28% lower VC than corresponding parameters of 
adult subjects). Additional consideration in support of this strategy were that both nivolumab and 
relatlimab are IgG4 mAbs with similar mechanisms of distribution and non-specific elimination was 
provided based on other oncology MAbs displaying a comparable effect of age on CL and VC, i.e., 
ipilimumab, atezolizumab, and pembrolizumab. Ipilimumab and atezolizumab are not IgG4, but IgG1 
antibodies, pembrolizumab is an IgG4 antibody. However, ipilimumab has a considerable shorter half-
life than nivolumab. Further, atezolizumab binds to the tumour while ipilimumab, pembrolizumab, 
nivolumab and relatlimab bind to the T-cells. Therefore, although some examples have been provided, 
not all were considered relevant and the evidence for a generally decreased CL of oncology IgG4 MAbs 
in adolescent patients needed further consideration. A discussion was provided on the comparability of 
the covariate effects for body weight, albumin and disease for nivolumab and relatlimab. The effect of 
body weight at the 95th percentile on CL was 34% and on VC was 15% for relatlimab, and for 
nivolumab the effect was 23% on CL and 25%, respectively. Further, the effect of albumin (with 
increased CL at lower albumin) was 21% and 28%, for nivolumab and relatlimab respectively. In both 
cases, CL was higher in patients with ECOG PS >0, although not clinically relevant (<20%). Although 
these data indicate reasonable comparability of the covariate effects, it was considered that, e.g. due 
to the different degree of target mediated clearance for nivolumab and relatlimab, uncertainties still 
remained on the exact comparability of the effect on CL for nivolumab and relatlimab in adolescents.

With respect to the reason for the reduced clearance in adolescent patients, the applicant argued that 
the reduced clearance of nivolumab and other IgG1 and IgG4 oncology MAbs may be linked to the 
disease state in adolescent solid tumour subjects. Higher protein turnover rate due to cachexia and 
hypermetabolic state in cancer patients are expected, dependent on the severity of disease. This effect 
has been described in literature. The applicant clarified that the actual age of the patient included in 
Study CA224020 assumed to be 17 years of age was in fact 18. The reason for this deviation was that 
according to EU regulations, only the year of birth was available in the eCRF. This explanation is 
acceptable. PcVPC of this particular subject with the reported relatlimab and nivolumab PK model were 
provided where the applicant treated this subject as 17-year-old in the nivolumab PK model, which was 
interpreted as applying the reduced CL and Vc for the adolescent population. This was compared to the 
actual exposure, based on the adult dose. It was noted that in a number of timepoints, the actual 
exposure was below the predicted nivolumab exposure, while this was less so the case for the 
predicted relatlimab exposure. This lower actual exposure was explained for a great deal by the fact 
that the applied CL and Vc in the popPK model for a patient aged 17 years were assumed to be lower 
than in adults. A new pcVPC for this patient was further provided using the adult covariates (i.e. 
simulate the patient as 18 year old subject), indicating a higher predicted exposure, more closely in 
line with the actual exposure. Overall, no new actual nivolumab and relatlimab PK data for adolescent 
patients was provided, since the identified patient was actually 18 years old. Due to the rarity of 
melanoma in adolescents and the availability of alternative treatment options for such patients, it is 
unlikely that confirming PK data in adolescent melanoma patients can be obtained.  
Possible scenarios for fixed or weight-based dosing in adolescents were compared, both under the 
condition that nivolumab or relatlimab clearance and apparent volume of distribution in adolescents is 
decreased or comparable to that in adults. 
As a starting point, in situations of comparable pathophysiology in adolescent and adult patients, as is 
the case for melanoma, efficacy and safety data can be translated based on comparable exposure.  
In this respect, two situations with flat dosing are possible: 
In case of flat dosing and assuming a paediatric effect on clearance is present, somewhat increased 
Cavg1 and Cmax1 for relatlimab and nivolumab (<25%) and increased Cmin1 (~25-50%) is predicted 
in adolescents as compared to adults.  
In case of flat dosing and assuming no paediatric effect on clearance is present, Cavg1 and Cmax1 are 
predicted to be similar in adolescents and adults both for relatlimab and nivolumab (<10%) and 
somewhat increased and similar Cmin1 (<27% and <15% for relatlimab and nivolumab, respectively). 
In case of flat dosing and assuming no paediatric effect on clearance, in general, exposure parameters 
for relatlimab and nivolumab are therefore predicted to be close to those in adults, and therefore 
efficacy and safety can be assumed to be comparable based on comparable exposure. In case a 
paediatric effect is present, exposure parameters increase in adolescents as compared to adults. The 
effect of this increased exposure is considered most relevant for safety. 
Likewise, two situations with weight-based dosing are possible: 
In case of weight-based dosing and assuming a paediatric effect on clearance is present, geometric 
mean of relatlimab and nivolumab Cavg1, Cmin1 and Cmax1 in adolescents with weight-based dosing 
in body weight groups <70-80 kg were all lower than the same body weight group in adults with flat 
dosing, with differences increasing down to lower weight patients (with 47-84% (relatlimab) and 38-
46% (nivolumab) lower exposure in adolescents in the 30-40 kg weight group).  
In case of weight-based dosing and assuming no paediatric effect on clearance, geometric mean of 
relatlimab and nivolumab Cavg1, Cmin1 and Cmax1 in adolescents with weight-based in body weight 
Assessment report  
EMA/720884/2022

groups <70-80 kg were all lower than the same body weight group in adults with flat dosing, with 
differences increasing down to lower weight patients (with 55-90% (relatlimab) and 52-54% 
(nivolumab) lower exposure in adolescents in the 30-40 kg weight group). The effect of this decreased 
exposure a lower body ranges is considered most relevant for efficacy. 
Since the pathophysiology of the adolescent and adult melanoma population is considered comparable, 
and comparable exposure between adolescents and adults has been sufficiently demonstrated for 
relatlimab and nivolumab applying the same flat 160/480 mg dose, this is considered sufficient to 
grant extension of the indication to include the adolescent population. In further support of this 
conclusion, the applicant discussed the exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety relationships in 
adolescents. 
Potential consequences of differences in relatlimab and nivolumab exposure 
Though both in case of flat dose and weight-based dosing, overall adolescent exposure was within the 
range of adult flat-dose exposures, in case of weight-based dosing a risk of underdosing and reduced 
efficacy in lower weight patients is likely to occur. This possibility is predicted by the outcome of the 
exposure-PFS and exposure-OR analyses developed in adults, indicating more comparable PFS and OR 
in adolescents and adults by flat dosing than following weight-based dosing, both in case of a 
paediatric effect on clearance or not. In this sense, flat dosing, yielding more comparable exposures 
between adolescents and adults, is preferred.  
Moreover, based on the exposure-safety relationship, the increased exposure in case of flat dosing is 
predicted to yield a limited increase in safety issues (HR ~1.01 and ~1.10 in case of no paediatric 
effect or presence of a paediatric effect on clearance).  
The disease in adolescents and adults is similar and the expected outcome of the treatment is also 
similar. Therefore, the exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety relationships in adults are considered 
valid for adolescents as well. 
Of note, for nivolumab, PK data in adolescents is available, and therefore for nivolumab comparable 
exposure can be claimed based on actual data. In case of relatlimab, uncertainties exist whether the 
same effect on clearance and volume of distribution in adolescents as observed for nivolumab is also 
present. However, overall, based on the simulations provided, it is expected that differences in 
exposure that may arise due to the presence of absence of the paediatric effect on clearance and 
volume of distribution, are limited. The assumption that the increased exposure with the currently 
proposed dose in case of reduced clearance and volume of distribution in adolescents for a flat dose is 
not expected to bear clinical relevance, is further supported by limited safety findings in the 480/480 
mg Q4W dose applied in part E of Study CA224020, in any case (long term) safety in adolescents will 
be followed post approval (see RMP). 
By applying a flat dose, in case no paediatric effect on clearance and volume of distribution is present, 
exposure in adults and adolescents will be highly comparable, which indeed can be concluded from the 
simulation data provided. In the situation of comparable pathophysiology in adolescents and adults as 
is the case here, this would mean that efficacy and safety in adolescents and adults are expected to be 
comparable as well. Only in case for relatlimab and nivolumab indeed a 30% reduced clearance and 
volume of distribution in adolescents occurs, exposure in adolescents with the proposed flat dose will 
be somewhat higher than that in adults. However, based on exposure-safety analyses, the 
consequences for safety are expected to be limited.  
In contrast, by applying a weight-based dose, adolescent patients with a lower weight are expected to 
have a lower exposure than adults to such degree (>40%), that an effect on efficacy may be 
consequential. Therefore, the proposal to apply the same flat dose for adolescents and adults is 
supported. 
Assessment report  
EMA/720884/2022  
Page 59/147 
 
 
 
Overall, based on the provided simulated exposure in adolescent and adult patients, applying either a 
flat dose in adolescents and adults or a weight-based dose in adolescents and a flat dose in adults, 
taking into account either the presence or the absence of a reduced clearance and volume of 
distribution in adolescents, reasonably comparable predicted exposure to relatlimab and nivolumab is 
considered acceptable. Considering the comparable pathophysiology of adolescent and adult melanoma 
patients, this comparable predicted exposure is expected to translate into comparable efficacy and 
safety in both populations. Therefore, the proposal for a flat dose for relatlimab and nivolumab, being 
the same in adolescents and adults weighing 30 kg and higher, is supported. The posology in section 
4.2 of the SmPC was modified to indicate a flat 160 mg/480 mg Q4W dose in adolescents and adults. 
This is considered acceptable, although it should be added that this dose was established for patients 
weighing at least 30 kg with a cross reference to section 5.2 (see SmPC comment section 4.2). 
The applicant indicates that it will pursue efforts to include adolescent patients in ongoing melanoma 
studies with relatlimab/nivolumab. Although it is uncertain, due to the low prevalence of melanoma in 
adolescent patients, that indeed adolescent patients will be included, the efforts are acknowledged, 
and the applicant is invited to consider such adolescent patients in the evaluation of the current 
160/480 mg Q4W dose advice for relatlimab/nivolumab in adolescent and adult melanoma patients 
(see RMP). 
60 vs 30 minute infusion. From a PK perspective, relatlimab and nivolumab Cmin and Cavg data obtained 
by using a 60 minutes administration period are considered relevant for the 30 minutes administration 
period as well. The proposed reduction of the infusion duration is in principle acceptable as a clinically 
relevant increase of immunogenicity and adverse events is considered unlikely given the limited 
differences in exposure based on popPK simulations. In addition, both nivolumab and relatlimab have a 
low immunogenic potential and a limited number of patients experienced hypersensitivity/infusion-
related reactions (11/412 pooled data) at the recommended dose. There were no apparent 
associations between dose (maximum rela + nivo SAV dose up to 1440/480 mg Q4W) and infusion or 
hypersensitivity reactions in study CA224020. The predicted Cmax after 30 or 60 min infusion is 
comparable, which is explained by the slow distribution half-life from the systemic circulation, i.e., 42.5 
and 32.7 h for relatlimab and nivolumab, respectively. Due to this slow distribution half-life, only a 
small portion of the administered dose will be cleared from the circulation between 30 and 60 minutes, 
explaining the comparable Cmax following 30 or 60 minutes infusion. 
Exposure relevant for safety evaluation. The relatlimab and nivolumab exposure figures in section 5.2 
of the SmPC were obtained from the popPK analysis. Due to their popPK nature, small differences are 
present between these data and the actual data in Study CA224047. The reported PK data are 
considered acceptable. 
The lack of dedicated in vitro and in vivo DDI studies is acceptable. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The proof of concept for efficacy of the combination of relatlimab and nivolumab was shown through 
non-clinical in vitro and in vivo experiments. Relatlimab administration resulted in dose-dependent 
changes of peripheral LAG-3 receptor occupancy and sLAG-3 which supports target engagement. 
Treatment associated increases of IFNγ and IFNγ-inducible chemokines, as well as a trend of increase 
in proliferating and activated CD4+ and CD8+ central and effector memory T cell subset in peripheral 
blood on Day 8 after the first dose, support enhanced T-cell activation upon combination treatment. 
Enhanced T-cell activation was not shown with relatlimab monotherapy, and differences appeared 
increased compared to nivolumab monotherapy although these data were not available for all 
parameters. 
Assessment report  
EMA/720884/2022

Relatlimab monotherapy (up to 800 mg Q2W) and relatlimab/nivolumab up to 1440/480mg Q4W did 
not result in a clinically relevant QTc prolongation in patients with a wide variety of solid tumours. 
Overall numbers were small, however, relatlimab and nivolumab are highly specific mAbs and not 
expected to directly inhibit the function of hERG or other ion channels responsible for cardiac 
repolarisation. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect. 
Receptor-binding. With respect to the exposure-peripheral receptor occupancy (RO), LAG-3 RO was 
higher following a dose of relatlimab/nivolumab 480/480 mg Q4W as compared to 160/480 mg Q4W. 
The clinical relevance of this increased RO at higher dose is not completely clear, considering the flat 
exposure-PFS analysis, but at the same time the dose-dependent exposure-OR relationship. No 
difference in binding RO was apparent comparing the situation of simultaneous administration as FDC 
or as SAV sequentially. 
Efficacy.  
With respect to the exposure-efficacy, PFS, OS, and OR were significantly associated with relatlimab 
exposure, resulting in a longer PFS or OS and higher OR compared to nivolumab monotherapy. The 
efficacy for all the PFS and OS endpoints was similar across the range of relatlimab exposures 
(Cavgd28) produced by nivolumab/relatlimab 240/80 mg Q2W, 480/160 mg Q4W, and 480/480 mg 
Q4W suggesting a flat E-R for efficacy. This flat E-R was shown to be applicable both for 1L and prior-
IO melanoma patients. Some uncertainty on the E-R comes from the exposure-OR analyses, where OR 
is predicted to be higher with higher doses of relatlimab (480 mg vs. 160 mg and 80 mg Q4W). The 
landmark analysis of OS from month 6 by response status in the previously assessed ipilimumab + 
nivolumab registrational study (CA209067) suggested a survival benefit for those patients who achieve 
a response (CR or PR), potentially indicating importance of the OR, which appears to increase at higher 
relatlimab dose. However, some uncertainty remains on the relationship between ORR and OS (see 
discussion on clinical efficacy). Preliminary data from Part E of the dose-finding study indicate that 
applying a 480/480 mg relatlimab/nivolumab posology numerically increased ORR but was also less 
tolerable compared to 160/480 mg relatlimab/nivolumab (see clinical efficacy), supporting the 
currently recommended dose.  
No significant relationship was observed between relatlimab exposure and HR of PFS, OS and OR, since 
no differences were observed across the different dosing regimens. Initially, only Cavgd28 was used in 
these analyses. However, based on the high correlation between relatlimab Cavgd28 and Cmind28 
(0.97) and between relatlimab Cavgd28 and Cmax1 (0.95), the E-R relationship with Cavgd28 is 
expected to be similar with alternative exposures such as Cmind28 or Cmax1. Indeed, based on the 
provided E-R analyses using the alternative exposure measures Cmind28, the results of E-R 
relationship of the efficacy end points (OS, PFS, and OR) were similar to those for Cavgd28 exposure, 
i.e., relatively flat. This was true both in the 1L and prior IO melanoma patient population. The 
provided additional E-R analyses do not point at a different E-R relationship between exposure and 
response than previously determined for Cavgd28. Further, the E-R relationship for PFS and OS is 
considered relatively flat both in the 1L and prior IO melanoma patient population.  
Safety.  
A higher incidence of Gr2 and Gr3 AEs was observed in patients receiving relatlimab+nivolumab 
treatment vs. nivolumab alone. However, no dose dependency effect was detected across the different 
schedules, suggesting that the higher incidence of AEs is basically related to the presence of 
relatlimab.

2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, PK and PD for relatlimab and nivolumab when given in combination has been investigated to a 
reasonable extent. Based on the provided simulated exposure to relatlimab and nivolumab in 
adolescent and adult patients, applying a flat dose and taking into account either the presence or the 
absence of a reduced clearance in adolescents, sufficiently comparable exposure between adolescent 
and adults with body weight ≥30 kg is demonstrated. Considering the comparable pathophysiology of 
melanoma in adolescents and adults, the proposal for a flat dose for relatlimab and nivolumab, being 
the same in adolescents and adults, is therefore supported. SmPC section 4.2 clarifies that the dose 
was established for patients weighing at least 30 kg with a cross reference to section 5.2. 
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The study considered to be key to the proposed indication is study CA224047, a phase 2/3 
randomised, double-blind study comparing relatlimab in combination with nivolumab to nivolumab 
alone. Supportive evidence is derived from study CA224020, which is a Phase 1/2a open-label study of 
relatlimab alone and in combination with nivolumab. Study details are summarised in Table 2. 
2.6.5.1.  Dose response study 
Study CA224020 is a large, ongoing Phase 1/2a, open-label study to assess the safety, tolerability, 
and efficacy of multiple dosing regimens of relatlimab monotherapy, relatlimab SAV (BMS-986016) + 
OPDIVO (BMS-936558; nivolumab) (hereafter referred to as rela SAV + nivo), and rela+nivo FDC 
(BMS-986213) in subjects with selected advanced or recurrent malignancies, including melanoma. As 
of the 25-Feb-2021 database lock (DBL), 1404 subjects have been treated with either relatlimab 
monotherapy (n = 25) or in combination with nivolumab (n = 1379) across all study parts. Except for 
select cohorts in Part E, enrolment to the remaining parts has been completed. 
CA224020 consists of 5 parts (Figure 5). Supportive efficacy data includes results from CA224020 Part 
A, melanoma cohorts in Part C, and Part D. Part E is still enrolling patients and data are not present. 
Sparse PK of relatlimab and nivolumab from part E along with clinical efficacy (PFS and ORR) were 
used for exposure-response for efficacy analysis reported in the clinical pharmacology part of this 
report. Eligible patients were treated with either relatlimab monotherapy (Parts A and A1) or in 
combination with nivolumab (Part B, Part C, Part D, and Part E). In each cycle, treatment was 
administered on Days 1, 15, 29, and 43. In Parts B, C and D, Q4W dosing, relatlimab and nivolumab 
were administered on Days 1 and 29 of each treatment cycle. Subjects in Part B and C received 
sequential infusion of nivolumab and relatlimab. 
The study population included males and females ≥ 18 years. For Part C (melanoma only), Part D, and 
Part E, males and females ≥ 12 to 17 years were also included if local regulations and/or institutional 
policies allowed for participants < 18 years of age. All subjects must have had histologic or cytologic 
confirmation of advanced, nonresectable, or metastatic solid tumours and measurable disease as 
defined by response criteria evaluation in solid tumours (RECIST) v1.1. Unless otherwise stated, 
patients must have ECOG PS 0 or 1. Part D1 melanoma subjects with prior IO were more strictly 
defined than those in part C, whereas Part D2 used expanded eligibility criteria; e.g. multiple prior 
lines of anti-PD-1 containing regimens allowed, and ECOG PS 0-2. The main objectives of Part D1 were 
to assess ORR by LAG-3 expression and to provide support for the tolerability of the FDC. Data from 
the expansion cohorts Part C 1L melanoma patients and Part D1 IO-pretreated melanoma patients are 
considered of most relevance for the current application.

Efficacy assessments were based on tumour assessments using computed tomography (CT) and/or 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as appropriate, performed at baseline and every 8 weeks during 
the treatment period. Tumour response was evaluated locally per RECIST v1.1. Subjects continued 
study therapy until the first occurrence of progressive disease, clinical deterioration, and/or meeting 
other criteria for discontinuation. Safety assessment included physical examinations, vital sign 
measurements, 12-lead ECG, and clinical laboratory evaluations. Samples were collected for PK, 
immunogenicity, PD, and biomarker analyses.   
Results 
Part A – Relatlimab monotherapy: Forty percent of subjects received prior IO-therapy. No clinically 
relevant antitumour activity (CR or PR) of relatlimab monotherapy was observed across a dose range 
of 20 to 800 mg administered Q2W. One out of 8 subjects treated with relatlimab 800 mg Q2W in the 
expansion cohort Part A1 achieved an investigator-assessed best overall response (BOR) of PR, which 
was maintained for 2.1 months. 
Part B – Rela+nivo dose escalation: About 64% of subjects received prior IO-therapy. Partial responses 
were variable across dose groups and varied from 0%-25%, no consistent pattern was observed. No 
CR was observed.

Part C – 1L melanoma: A total of 66 subjects with previously untreated unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma were treated with sequential administrations of rela SAV 80 mg + nivo 240 mg Q2W in the 
1L-Melanoma Expansion Cohort. The median duration of rela+nivo therapy was 34.5 weeks (range: 2-
109). The median age was 64.5 (range: 24-87 years). At study entry, 61 (92.4%) subjects had Stage 
IV disease. Baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were > upper limit of normal (ULN) in 24 
(36.4%) subjects and 18 (27.3%) subjects were BRAF mutation positive. With a minimum follow-up 
time of 31.9 months, BICR confirmed ORR was 47.0% (95% confidence interval (CI): 34.6, 59.7) with 
CRs reported in 11 (16.7%) subjects and PRs in 20 (30.3%) subjects. The confirmed disease control 
rate (DCR: CR+PR+stable disease (SD) ≥ 12w) was 59.1%. Median durability of response (DOR) was 
not reached. Median PFS per BIR was 12.7 months (95% CI: 3.71, 18.17) and median OS was 34.6 
months (95% CI: 18.6, NR). 
Fifty-five subjects had a quantifiable LAG-3 immunohistochemistry (IHC) result in the 1L melanoma 
cohort. ORR per BICR was 38.5% (95% CI: 20.2, 59.4) and 58.6% (95% CI: 38.9, 76.5) for subjects 
with LAG-3 < 1% (n=26) and subjects with LAG-3 ≥1% (n=29), respectively.  
Part D1 – prior IO melanoma: Subjects in Part D1 were randomised 1:1:1 to treatment with rela SAV 
80 mg + nivo 240 mg Q2W coadministration, rela SAV 160 mg + nivo 480 mg Q4W coadministration, 
and rela+nivo FDC 160/480 mg Q4W. At study entry, median age was 63-65 years and 89.2%-96.3%

had stage IV disease. Baseline LDH levels were > ULN in 45.5%-53.0% of subjects and 14.6%-27.7% 
were BRAF mutation positive. Minimum follow-up was 28.0, 19.7 and 19.4 months for Part D1 Arms 1, 
2, and 3, respectively. ORR per BICR was 11.8% (95% CI: 7.6, 17.4), 6.0% (95% CI: 2.0, 13.5), and 
18.3% (95% CI: 10.6 28.4), for 80/240 mg Q2W, 160/480mg Q4W, and 160/480mg Q4w FDC, 
respectively. About 3.6%-4.9% of subjects had a CR. DCR was 37.1% (95% CI: 30.1, 44.5), 32.5% 
(95% CI: 226, 43.7), and 48.8% (95% CI: 37.6, 60.1), respectively. Median DOR was not reached 
except for the 160/480mg Q4W FDC and was 18.4 months. Median PFS per BIR was between 2-3.6 
months and median OS was between 13.1-16.7 months across treatment arms. 
Tumour response in the subgroup of LAG-3 expressing (≥ 1%) subjects (n = 109) was consistent with 
that of the entire cohort; ORR was 11.9% (95% CI: 6.5, 19.5). For subjects with LAG-3 <1%, ORR 
was 8.9% (95% CI: 2.5, 21.1; n=45).  
Part E – 1L melanoma: Subjects in Part E were randomised 1:1 to rela+nivo 160 mg/480 mg Q4W or 
rela+nivo 480 mg/480 mg Q4W. A total of 77 patients were enrolled in each treatment arm and 
baseline characteristics were generally balanced between arms. The most common reason for drug 
discontinuation was disease progression in both treatment arms (35.1% vs 26.0%); the rate of 
discontinuation due to study drug toxicity was numerically lower in the 480/160 Q4W arm versus the 
480/480 Q4W arm (13.0% and 20.8%). As of DBL, minimum follow-up was 4.4 months and efficacy 
data are not fully mature, yet. The median (range) follow-up was 10.1 (2.9, 28.7) months in the 
rela+nivo 160/480 mg Q4W arm and 10.0 (1.2, 27.5) months in the 480/480 mg Q4W arm. BICR-
assessed ORR was 44.2% (95% CI: 32.8, 55.9) and 58.4% (95% CI: 46.6, 69.6) in the 480/160 mg 
Q4W and 480/480 mg Q4W arms, respectively. The median DOR was not reached in either arm 
(range: 1.6+, 26.0+ and 1.3+, 24.0+). Median PFS per BICR was not reached in the 480/160 mg Q4W 
arm (95% CI: 5.59, NA) and 17.8 months in the 480/480 mg Q4W arm (95% CI: 11.10, NA).  
Safety 
No maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was identified for relatlimab monotherapy (20-800 mg) or 
relatlimab + nivolumab (20/80 mg Q2W to 1440/480 mg Q4W). 
To support the FDC compared to co-administration, the safety profile of the different treatment arms in 
Part D1 were compared overall and by the incidence of AEs in the Broad Scope Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Anaphylactic Reaction Standardized MedDRA queries (SMQ) occurring 
within 2 days after dosing. Any grade AEs were reported in the majority of subjects (Table 10). Grade 
3-4 events and serious AEs (SAEs) rates were similar between the rela+nivo 80/240 mg Q2W and 
160/480 mg Q4W coadministration. SAE rates were slightly lower in the FDC compared to the SAV 
coadministration arm for rela+nivo 160/480 mg Q4W. The incidence rates of drug-related AEs were 
higher in the FDC arm as compared to the rela+nivo coadministration, mostly attributable to low grade 
(Grade1-2) AEs and in the category of endocrine disorders (hypothyroidism). Endocrine drug-related 
select AEs were observed in 13.4%, 3.6%, and 5.8% of subjects for the 160/480mg Q4W FDC, 
160/480mg Q4W coadministration, and 80/240mg Q2W, respectively. The incidence of AEs in the 
anaphylactic reaction MedDRA SMQ Broad Scope (all causality) were comparable between the 
rela+nivo 80/240 mg Q2W coadministration (18.5%) and the rela+nivo 160/480 mg Q4W FDC 
(17.1%), but numerically higher compared to rela+nivo 160/480 mg Q4W coadministration (10.8%).

1 therapy in study CA224020 Part D1 
Part E – 1L melanoma: The number of deaths was similar in both treatment arms (18-19%), with the 
majority due to disease progression (about 15%). One death in the 480/480 arm was considered 
related to study drug by the investigator (Grade 5 pneumopathy). All causality AEs (93-100%) and 
SAEs (52-54%) were reported in similar proportions of patients across the 2 arms, but all causality AEs 
of any grade leading to study drug discontinuation were more frequent in the 480/480 arm (32.5% of 
patients) vs the 480/160 arm (15.6%). There were numerically higher frequencies of Grade 3-4 drug-
related AEs (29.9% vs. 26.0%), drug-related Grade 3-4 SAEs (19.5% vs. 15.6%), and drug-related 
AEs leading to discontinuation (18.2% vs 13.0%) in the 480/480 arm relative to the 160/480 arm.

Methods 
CA224047 is a seamless Phase 2/3, randomised, double-blind study of relatlimab + nivolumab (FDC at 
a 1:3 ratio; BMS-986213) vs nivolumab monotherapy in subjects with previously untreated metastatic 
or unresectable melanoma.  
The study design is shown in Figure 6. Adults and adolescents ≥ 12 years of age were eligible for 
enrolment in Study CA224047. Subjects were randomised 1:1 to treatment with relatlimab + 
nivolumab 160/480 mg IV Q4W FDC (BMS-986213) or nivolumab 480 mg IV Q4W and study treatment 
was continued until disease progression, treatment discontinuation, withdrawal of consent, or end of 
study. Randomisation was stratified by tumour PD-L1 expression (≥ 1% vs < 1%), LAG-3 expression 
(≥ 1% vs < 1%), BRAF mutation (V600 mutation positive vs V600 wild-type), and AJCCv8 M stage 
M0/M1any[0] vs M1any[1]). On-study tumour assessments began 12 weeks from randomisation and

continued every 8 weeks up to week 52, and every 12 weeks thereafter until BICR-confirmed disease 
progression or treatment discontinuation, whichever occurred later. Treatment beyond initial 
investigator-assessed RECIST v1.1 defined progression was permitted if the subject had investigator-
assessed clinical benefit and was tolerating study treatment.

• 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤ 1/Lansky Performance Score 
≥ 80% for minors (ages 12-17) only. 
•  Histologically confirmed Stage III (unresectable) or Stage IV melanoma, per the AJCC staging 
system (8th edition). 
•  No prior systemic anticancer therapy for unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Prior adjuvant or 
neoadjuvant melanoma therapies were permitted if all related adverse events have either returned 
to baseline or stabilised: Anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4 therapy with at least 6 months between the last 
dose and date of recurrence; Interferon therapy with the last dose at least 6 weeks prior to 
randomisation; BRAF- or MEK-inhibitor-containing regimens with at least 6 months between the 
last dose and date of recurrence. 
• 
• 
Participants must have measurable disease by CT or MRI per RECIST v1.1 criteria. 
Tumour tissue from an unresectable or metastatic site of disease must be provided for biomarker 
analyses. In order to be randomised, a participant must be classified as PD-L1 positive or PD-L1 
negative, as well as LAG-3 positive or LAG-3 negative. Participants with indeterminate or 
unevaluable PD-L1 or LAG-3 status results will not be permitted to randomize to a treatment arm. 
If an insufficient amount of tumour tissue from an unresectable or metastatic site is available prior 
to the start of the screening phase, participants must consent to allow the acquisition of additional 
tumour tissue during the screening period for performance of biomarker analyses.  
• 
Participants must have known BRAF V600 mutation status or consent to BRAF V600 mutation 
testing per local institutional standards during the screening period. 
Prior radiotherapy must have completed at least 2 weeks prior to study treatment administration. 
• 
Key exclusion criteria 
•  Active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases. Participants with brain metastases were 
eligible if these have been treated and there is no MRI evidence of progression for at least 8 weeks 
after treatment is complete and within 28 days prior to first dose of study treatment 
administration.  
•  Ocular melanoma.

mellitus, hypothyroidism only requiring hormone replacement, skin disorders (such as vitiligo, 
psoriasis, or alopecia) not requiring systemic treatment, conditions not expected to recur in the 
absence of an external trigger were permitted to enrol. 
•  Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (> 10 mg daily 
prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of start of study

pathways. 
•  Subjects with a history of myocarditis. 
• 
Troponin T (TnT) or I (TnI) > 2x institutional ULN. Subjects with TnT or TnI levels between > 1 to 
2x ULN were permitted if repeat levels within 24 hours are ≤ 1x ULN. If TnT or TnI levels are > 1 to 
2x ULN within 24 hours, the subject may undergo a cardiac evaluation and be considered for 
treatment. If TnT or TnI repeat levels beyond 24 hours are < 2x ULN, the subject may undergo a 
cardiac evaluation and be considered for treatment.

•  Treatments 
Subjects either received relatlimab + nivolumab 160/480 mg IV Q4W FDC (BMS-986213) or nivolumab 
480 mg IV Q4W administered as ~60-minute IV infusions. For adolescent subjects < 40 kg, dosing was 
planned to be weight-based. However, no adolescents were enrolled. No dose reductions or dose 
escalations were permitted for both treatment arms. Dose delay criteria were defined and applied for 
all drug-related AEs according to protocol. Besides the medications already mentioned in the in- and 
exclusion criteria, any concurrent anti-neoplastic was prohibited. Also, any live / attenuated vaccine 
(eg, varicella, zoster, yellow fever, rotavirus, oral polio and measles, mumps, rubella [MMR]) during 
treatment and until 100 days after last dose were prohibited, inactivated vaccines were permitted. 
Immunosuppressive agents and immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids were allowed to 
treat a drug-related AE.

Safety:  
• 
To assess the overall safety and tolerability of rela+nivo FDC (BMS 986213) and of nivolumab 
monotherapy. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
• 
PFS time was assessed by BICR, using RECIST v1.1. PFS was defined as the time between the date 
of randomisation and the first date of documented progression, or death due to any cause, 
whichever occurs first. 
Secondary endpoints 
•  OS was defined as the time between the date of randomisation and the date of death due to any 
cause. 
•  ORR was assessed by a BICR and defined as the number of subjects with a BOR of CR or PR 
divided by the number of randomised subjects for each treatment group. Confirmation of response 
is required at least 4 weeks after the initial response. The BOR is defined as the best response 
designation, recorded between the date of randomisation and the date of objectively documented 
progression per RECIST v1.1 or the date of subsequent anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurs first.  
PD-L1 results 
PD-L1 expression was defined as the percent of tumour cells with membrane staining in a minimum of 
100 evaluable tumour cells per the validated Agilent/Dako PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx test. For 
stratification during randomisation, subjects were classified as PD-L1 positive ≥ 1% versus PD-L1 
negative <1%. The baseline PD-L1 was defined as the last quantifiable test result before, or on the 
date of randomisation. Subjects with indeterminate or unevaluable PD-L1 status results were not 
permitted to be randomised to a treatment arm.  
LAG-3 results 
LAG-3 expression was determined using an analytically validated IHC assay. LAG-3 expression was 
defined as the percentage of positive-staining immune cells with a morphological resemblance to 
lymphocytes relative to all nucleated cells within the tumour region in samples containing a minimum 
of 100 viable tumour cells. For stratification during randomisation, subjects were classified LAG-3 
negative: <1% LAG-3 positive cells, or LAG-3 Positive: ≥1% LAG-3 positive cells. The baseline LAG-3 
was defined as the last quantifiable test result before, or on the date of randomisation. Subjects with 
indeterminate or unevaluable LAG-3 status results were not permitted to be randomised to a treatment 
arm.

•  Sample size 
The sample size for the study was based on a primary endpoint of PFS using BICR for either a Phase 2 
or a Phase 3 study. The overall alpha for the Phase 3 study was 0.05 (two-sided). As the PFS IA met 
the pre-specified HR of ≤ 0.8, the study transitioned seamlessly to Phase 3 and therefore the sample 
size justification for Phase 3 is outlined here.  
The sample size was calculated in order to compare PFS among subjects randomised to receive 
rela+nivo FDC (BMS-986213) vs nivolumab monotherapy. The number of events required was 
simulated based on results from Study CA209067 with a median PFS of 6.9 months for the nivolumab 
monotherapy arm and 11.8 months for the rela+nivo FDC (BMS-986213) arm. The cure rates were 
assumed to be 30% in the nivolumab monotherapy arm and 40% in the rela+nivo FDC (BMS-986213) 
arm. It was estimated that the study required at least 365 PFS events to ensure approximately 
85% power to detect a HR of 0.73 with an overall type I error of 0.05. Approximately 700 subjects 
were to be randomised to the two treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio. The final PFS analysis was planned to 
occur when 365 participants have had a PFS event.  
The sample size was also calculated in order to compare OS among participants randomised to receive 
BMS-986213 versus nivolumab. The number of OS events (deaths) required was based on results from 
study CA209067, with a median OS of 36.9 months for nivolumab monotherapy and 49.2 months for 
nivolumab with relatlimab, resulting in an effective hazard ratio of approximately 0.75. With 300 
deaths the power will be approximately 69% with a type I error rate of 0.05. 
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
All participants were centrally randomised using interactive response technology (IRT). Subjects were 
randomised in a 1:1 fashion into two parallel treatment groups: rela+niv FDC (BMS-986213) IV Q4W 
and nivolumab IV Q4W. Stratification factors at randomisation were tumour PD-L1 expression (≥ 1% 
vs < 1%), tumour LAG 3 expression (≥ 1% vs < 1%), BRAF mutation (V600 mutation positive vs V600 
wild-type), and AJCCv8 M stage (M0/M1any[0] vs M1any[1]). M1any is defined as all M1 with elevated 
LDH only. The randomisation procedures were carried out via permuted blocks within each stratum, 
defined by combination of LAG-3 status (positive or negative), PD-L1 status (positive or negative), 
BRAF V600 mutational status (positive or wild type), and M Stage (M0/M1any[0] or M1any[1]).  
BMS, subjects, investigators, and site staff were blinded (study remained double blinded) to the study 
therapy administered and randomisation through the DBL. Only the independent data monitoring 
committee (DMC) reviewed the PFS IA and OS IA1 results, an independent third-party prepared the 
analyses for the DMC. 
•  Statistical methods 
The intention to treat (ITT) population, comprising of all randomised patients was to be used for the 
primary analysis and the secondary endpoints.  
A two-sided log-rank test stratified by LAG-3 expression (≥ 1% vs < 1%), (PD-L1 status (≥ 1% vs < 
1%), BRAF status, and AJCC (8th edition) M Stage in randomised participants to compare the PFS of 
relatlimab + nivolumab arm (BMS-986213) and the nivolumab alone arm. In the event of small strata, 
it was pre-planned that PD-L1 would be removed from the analysis as a stratification factor. This was 
the case for the PFS analysis. Hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 2-sided 95% CI were to be 
estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model, with treatment group as a single covariate, 
stratified by the above factors. 
Two definitions were pre-specified for the analysis of PFS. These differed by how subsequent therapy 
before progression was accounted for in the analysis. Table 11 presents the censoring scheme for the 
Assessment report

primary definition. For the secondary definition, patients were followed-up for progression regardless of 
whether they received subsequent therapy before progression or not.  
Table 11. Censoring scheme used in primary definition for PFS 
The overall alpha for the Phase 3 study is 0.05 (two-sided). Following the seamless phase 2/3 design, 
an interim PFS futility analysis was performed when approximately 150 PFS events had been observed 
in the Phase 2 cohort. If the pre-specified HR of ≤ 0.8 was met, then the study would continue to 
recruit into the Phase 3 stage (T2 onwards). The two secondary endpoints, OS and ORR were to be 
tested hierarchically following the scheme provided in Figure 7.

Results 
•  Participant flow 
At the time of the clinical study report (CSR) data cut-off (DCO) (9 March 2021), 1281 patients were 
screened, and 714 subjects were randomised in the study; 355 subjects to rela+nivo FDC (BMS-
986213) and 359 subjects to nivolumab. Study disposition is shown in Table 12. Reasons for no longer 
meeting study criteria did not show any single predominant reason and included unevaluable PD-L1, 
LAG-3, and/or BRAF status, worsening of ECOG performance status (PS), and presence of exclusionary 
brain metastases. 
Overall, the most common reasons for study treatment discontinuation were progressive disease 
(36.3% vs 46.0% for BMS-986213 and nivolumab, respectively) and AEs (17.7% and 8.9% for 
rela+nivo FDC and nivolumab, respectively). At the time of DCO, 464 (65.0%) of subjects were 
ongoing on study treatment.

•  Recruitment 
The first subject was enrolled in April 2018 and the first subject was randomised in May 2018. The last 
subject was randomised in Dec 2020. No subjects were enrolled between Feb 2019 and Aug 2019. 
Enrolment was paused to allow for sufficient follow-up (minimum 12 weeks) to perform the interim 
analysis of PFS (PFS IA). On 26-Aug-2019, the study proceeded to Phase 3 based on the DMC 
Assessment report

recommendation after the PFS IA, concluding that the pre-specified PFS HR threshold of ≤ 0.8 was 
met, and enrolment started again in September 2019. A total of 425 subjects were initially randomised 
within the Phase 2 portion of the study and then additional 289 patients were randomised in the phase 
3 portion: up to a total of 714. 
Overall, the median duration of follow-up (defined as randomisation to last known alive date) was 
13.21 months (range: 0-33.1). The median duration of therapy was 5.55 months (range: 0.0, 31.5) 
and 4.86 months (range: 0.0, 32.2), respectively. 
•  Conduct of the study 
The original protocol for this study was dated 18-Dec-2017. As of the 09-Mar-2021 DBL, there were a 
total of 3 global revisions, 3 country-specific amendments (UK, Norway and France), and 6 
administrative letters. Key study level changes to Study CA224047 after the original protocol are 
provided below (Table 13). 
Table 13. Summary of key global changes to protocol CA224047 
The SAP was amended to incorporate a pre-specified sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint if ≥ 
10% of PFS events were attributable to COVID-19. 
Changes to planned analyses 
The following analyses were performed differently than specified in the SAP or were added post-hoc: 
• 
In the SAP, AEs by subgroups were specified. Region was inadvertently not updated to include the 
final region categories. The analysis for AEs by region were performed with the same regions that 
are displayed at baseline and for efficacy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/720884/2022  
Page 74/147 
 
 
 
 
 
 
o  Post-hoc: AEs by biomarker subgroups of baseline LAG-3 (≥ 1% vs < 1%) and PD-L1 (≥ 
1% vs < 1%/non-quantifiable, and ≥ 10% vs < 10%) were analysed and are presented in 
this CSR.  
o  Post-hoc: additional analyses of myocarditis and elevated troponin were performed. These 
included time to onset/resolution, duration, events leading to discontinuation, events 
requiring immune-modulating medication (IMMs), and events leading to dose delay. 
Protocol deviations 
Important protocol deviations (IPDs), previously known as significant protocol deviations, are a subset 
of protocol deviations that may significantly impact the completeness, accuracy, and/or reliability of 
the study data or that may significantly affect a subject's rights, safety, or well-being. BMS has 
modified the terminology, reporting process, and categorisation of protocol deviations. IPDs that had 
the potential to impact PFS were captured as relevant protocol deviations (RPDs) and are summarised 
in Table 14. 
Table 14. Summary of relevant protocol deviations – All randomised subjects Study CA224047 
Overall, 88% and 75% of subjects reported any important protocol deviation in the rela+nivo FDC and 
nivolumab monotherapy arm, respectively. These were predominantly in the categories Trial 
Procedures (mostly timing tumour assessment not performed according to protocol), Safety Reporting 
(mostly related to ECG performance and timely reporting SAEs), and Study Intervention (mostly 
incorrect stratification factor). More IPDs were seen in the nivo+rela FDC for the Inclusion/Exclusion 
criteria (39 vs 28), Trial Procedures (96 vs 81), and Informed Consent and/or Independent Ethics 
Committee and Institutional Review Board (IEC/IRB) (41 vs 27) categories. Percentage of protocol 
deviations that could potential impact PFS were low; 2.3% and 1.7% in the rela+nivo FDC and 
nivolumab monotherapy arm, respectively. One site in Mexico was closed, GCP inspections by 
competent authorities do not question GCP compliance.  
During the study, PD-L1 testing was switched to a different laboratory site as PD-L1 ≥ 1% cases were 
lower than expected, due to under-scoring. PD-L1 re-scoring was performed and these results were 
used for the primary efficacy analyses. A sensitivity analysis of the PFS primary endpoint was 
performed using the originally scored PD-L1 to assess the impact of the discrepancies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/720884/2022  
Page 75/147 
 
 
 
 
Specification of M-stage classification was added, as it was observed that sites were not reliably 
including LDH lab values into the staging classification needed for randomisation, likely due to 
confusion with the updated AJCC staging criteria (v8, 2018). Further, it was decided that the AJCC v8 
M stage for statistical analysis would be programmed by extracting the actual lab LDH values and the 
metastasis stage data directly from RAVE clinical database. This was pre-specified in statistical analysis 
plan (SAP) V2.0 (approval date: 23-Nov-2020). A sensitivity analysis of the PFS primary endpoint was 
performed based on IRT and RAVE clinical database. 
•  Baseline data 
Baseline demographic and disease characteristics are presented in Table 15 and Table 16.  
At trial entry, the majority of subjects (91.7%) were AJCC Stage IV and 34.3% of subjects had 
tumours characterised as M1Any [1] (see Table 16). Both the PD-L1 and M-stage factors were 
balanced between treatment arms, whether using the original values that determined subject 
stratification at the time of randomisation, or the values used as stratification factors for the statistical 
efficacy models (data not shown).

Overall, 8.7% of subjects received prior systemic therapy, mostly interferon (6.3%). 
Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were in general comparable between the phase 2 
and phase 3 part of the study (data not shown). The main differences between part 2 and part 3 relate 
to region (20.5% vs 42.6% from Latin America), ECOG 1 (26.4% vs 42.9%), LDH>ULN (33.4% vs 
40.1%), and M1C (34.3% vs 42.1%, more pronounced in the nivolumab monotherapy arm). There 
were no substantial differences in prior systemic cancer therapy.  
A total of 87.0% of subjects treated in the rela+nivo FDC (BMS-986213) arm received ≥90% of the 
planned dose intensity, comparable to the nivolumab monotherapy arm (84.7%). The median duration 
of therapy was 5.55 months in the rela+nivo FDC (BMS-986213) arm and 4.86 months in the 
nivolumab monotherapy arm. A total of 29.3% and 28.1% received ≥ 12 months of study drug, 
respectively.

As of the 09-Mar-2021 DBL, a total of 49.3% and 41.2% of randomised subjects in the rela+nivo FDC 
(BMS-986213) and nivolumab monotherapy arms, respectively, were censored for PFS (per the 
primary definition), see Table 19.

Separation of the Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves favouring rela+nivo FDC (BSM-986213) over nivolumab 
monotherapy occurred at approximately 3 months, at the time of the first on-study assessment, and 
this treatment effect was sustained through the period of follow-up (Figure 8).

CA224047 
Sensitivity analyses for PFS by BIRC 
A sensitivity analysis censoring for subsequent therapy was performed and results were comparable to 
the primary analysis (see  
Assessment report  
EMA/720884/2022  
Page 81/147 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 18). Other prespecified sensitivity analyses were performed for the following assumptions: 1) 
constant hazards assumption, 2) crossover of treatment effect across strata, 3) adjustment for 
potentially important covariates, 4) censoring for two missing images in a row, 5) any differences 
between stratification values in IRT vs. RAVE, and 6) an unstratified analysis. These analyses were all 
consistent with the primary analysis (data not shown).  
Investigator assessment 
The exploratory analyses of PFS per investigator were supportive of the primary endpoint results. 
Rela+nivo FDC (BSM-986213) demonstrated a higher PFS (primary definition) compared with 
nivolumab monotherapy: HR = 0.85 (95% CI: 0.69, 1.03), with a longer median PFS (primary 
definition): 10.15 months (95% CI: 8.21, 14.75) vs 6.51 months (95% CI: 4.63, 10.09), respectively. 
Concordance between BICR and investigator PFS assessments was 83.7% and 85.5% for the primary 
PFS definition in the rela+nivo FDC (BSM-986213) and nivolumab arm, respectively. 
Additional sensitivity analyses were performed post-hoc to justify the assumption of non-informative 
censoring, including subsequent anticancer therapy as PFS event, combining investigator assessment 
and BICR for PFS events, counting non-administrative censored times as events, as well as further 
information after treatment discontinuation. These analyses were reassuring that any potentially 
informative censoring did not have an influence on the results and related conclusions of efficacy in the 
ITT population (both for the 09-Mar-2021 DBL and 28-Oct-2021 DBL, see below).  
Updated PFS analyses time final OS analysis 28-Oct-2021 DBL: 
As of the 28-Oct-2021 DBL, with a median extent of follow-up of 19.27 months, the median 
duration of therapy was 8.3 months in the nivo+rela FDC arm and 6.5 months in the nivolumab 
monotherapy arm. The updated PFS analysis including an additional 46 PFS events (primary definition) 
across both arms supported the primary analysis, see Table 20 and Figure 9. The median PFS in the 
nivo+rela FDC arm (10.22 months (95% CI: 6.51, 14.75)) was 5.6 months longer compared with the 
nivolumab monotherapy arm (4.63 months (95% CI: 3.48, 6.44)). About 42% and 35% in the 
nivo+rela FDC and nivolumab monotherapy arms, respectively, were censored for PFS, the majority of 
subjects were censored at the time of the last on-study tumour assessment.

Figure 9. Kaplan-Meier plot of PFS per BICR (primary definition) – All randomised subjects (28-Oct-
2021 DBL) 
The PFS per BICR analysis using the secondary definition (without censoring for subsequent 
therapy) also continued to favor nivo+rela FDC compared with nivolumab monotherapy: 
HR = 0.79 (95% CI: 0.66, 0.95) (Table 20). Further, updated PFS (primary definition) sensitivity 
analyses were performed and supported the primary analyses (data not shown). 
Key secondary endpoints 
Overall Survival 
The secondary endpoint of OS, with a cumulative design power of approximately 69%, was analysed 
based on 297 deaths (nearly 100% of the planned events) for the 28-Oct-2021 DBL. This analysis was 
considered the final OS analysis. There were 137 (38.6%) deaths in the rela+nivo FDC arm and 160 
(44.6%) deaths in the nivolumab monotherapy arm, and 61.4% and 55.4% of subjects were censored 
for OS, respectively (Table 21). The most common reason for OS censoring was subjects in follow-up, 
with < 3% censored for being off study in both treatment arms. While OS favoured rela+nivo FDC over 
nivolumab monotherapy, the improvement was not statistically significant (HR = 0.80 (95% CI: 0.64, 
1.01); p value = 0.0593; 2-sided O’Brien Fleming boundary for statistical significance p-value < 
0.04302)) (Figure 10). The estimated OS rates at 12, 24 and 36 months were more than 5% higher for 
rela+nivo FDC with respect to the nivolumab monotherapy arm.

Objective Response Rate 
Due to the position of ORR in the statistical testing hierarchy, ORR per BICR was not formally tested 
for statistical significance, however rela+nivo FDC demonstrated an improvement in ORR compared 
with nivolumab in all randomised subjects; ORR = 43.1% (95% CI: 37.9, 48.4) vs 32.6% (95% CI: 
27.8, 37.7) respectively (Table 22). ORR rates at 12 weeks were 30.1% vs 21.7% and ORR matured 
until 28 weeks. A BOR of CR was achieved in 16.3% of patients in the rela+nivo FDC arm and 14.2% 
of patients in the nivolumab arm.

Table 22. Summary of objective response rate – All randomised subjects (28-Oct-2021 DBL) 
Concordance between BICR and investigator-assessed ORR was high and similar between treatment 
arms in all randomised subjects, with a concordance rate of 86.5% and 88.3% for rela+nivo FDC and 
nivolumab arms, respectively 
Disease control rate per BICR was also higher in the BMS-986213 arm relative to the nivolumab 
monotherapy arm (62.8% vs 50.7%, respectively). The median TTR per BICR was the same in both 
treatment arms (2.79 months) and the median DOR was not reached in either arm.

LAG-3 expression 
The PFS HRs favoured rela+nivo FDC (BMS-986213) compared with nivolumab monotherapy 
regardless of LAG-3 expression (< 1%, ≥ 1%, < 5%, and ≥ 5%) (Table 23 and Figure 11). The largest 
absolute improvement in median PFS was observed with high LAG-3 expression (≥ 1%, and ≥ 5%).

For subjects with high PD-L1 expression (≥ 5%, and ≥ 10%), median PFS was not reached in the 
rela+nivo FDC arm or in both treatment arms.

Updated Efficacy analyses (28-Oc-2021 DBL) Biomarker subgroups 
Updated efficacy analyses of PFS confirm the initial analyses (Table 26). Exploratory subgroup analyses 
for OS provided higher HR point estimates for the comparison between nivo+rela FDC and nivolumab 
monotherapy among tumour PD-L1 expressers relative to those with low or absent expression at the 
1%, 5%, and 10% thresholds. As noted above, the OS data remain immature with OS maturity defined 
as deaths in 50% of subjects. There were approximately 42% (297/714) of deaths among all 
randomised subjects (34% and 46% of deaths among patients in the PD-L1 positive and PD-L1 
negative subgroups based on 1% cut-off, respectively). An ORR difference of ~8% to 12% was 
observed in favour of nivo+rela FDC above nivolumab monotherapy across the majority of PD-L1 
expression levels.

Table 26 Efficacy by baseline tumour cell PD-L1 expression levels – All randomised subjects (28-Oct-

Updated efficacy PFS analyses by combined baseline PD-L1/LAG-3 expression levels supported the 
initial analyses and the updated median PFS in the subgroup PD-L1 ≥1%/LAG-3 ≥1% was similar to 
that of the PD-L1 ≥1% subgroup (data not shown). 
Tumour PD-L1 expression at the 1% threshold was a study randomisation stratification factor and 
defined the largest PD-L1 positive subgroup in Study CA224047. Therefore, additional analyses to 
further characterize the relationship between treatment efficacy and PD-L1 expression were focused on 
the PD-L1 ≥1% subgroup. KM-curves of PFS and OS per baseline PD-L1 expression are shown below 
(Figure 14 and Figure 15). Clear separation of curves is seen for PD-L1 <1%, whereas curves overlap 
for PD-L1 ≥1%.

Exploratory analyses of PFS and OS by response showed that achievement of a tumour response (BOR 
of CR or PR) was associated with prolonged PFS and OS, irrespective of the treatment and PD-L1 
expression subgroup (≥1% and < 1%) (Figure 16 and Figure 17).

A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for PD-L1 expression based on 6-month PFS was 
constructed, which was the closest landmark to the 8.7-month minimum study follow-up at the time of 
the latest DBL (Figure 18). The ROC analyses for PFS at 6 months and response per BICR 
demonstrated AUCs close to 0.5 for both nivo+rela FDC and nivolumab monotherapy, and the ROC 
analysis does not clearly define an optimal PD-L1 cut-off that maximizes sensitivity and specificity.

PFS2 per investigator 
PFS2 was defined as the time from randomisation to progression date after the next line of therapy, 
per investigator assessment, or to death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Subjects who were 
alive and without progression after the next line of therapy were censored at last known alive date. 
Median PFS2 per investigator were N.A. (95% CI: 21.75, N.A.) and 20.04 (95% CI: 15.44, 25.13) 
months for rela+nivo FDC (BMS-986213) vs nivolumab monotherapy, respectively. HR of rela+nivo 
FDC (BMS-986213) arm versus nivolumab monotherapy arm was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.97). 
Based on the 28-Oct-2021 DBL, PFS2 was 30.23 (95% CI: 23.72, NA) and 20.04 (95% CI: 15.44, 
25.13) months for rela+nivo FDC vs nivolumab monotherapy, respectively (HR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.61, 
0.93). 
Frequencies and type of subsequent anti-cancer therapy were comparable between treatment arms. A 
total of 35.5% and 37.3% of subjects received any type of subsequent systemic therapy in the 
rela+nivo FDC and nivolumab arm, respectively. PD1/CTLA4 inhibitors were given in 9.0% and 12.8% 
of subjects, and targeted BRAF/MEK mono or combination were given in 11.5% and 13.9% of subjects 
in the rela+nivo FDC and nivolumab arm, respectively. 
Treatment-free interval and treatment-free survival 
TFI and TFS are defined in a limited subgroup of randomised subjects who were off study treatment, 
and either on study or off study. Median TFI was 7.53 months (range: 0.1-30.4) in the rela+nivo FDC 
arm (n=167) and 4.21 months (range: 0.1-3.25) in the nivolumab arm (n=151). Median TFS was 3.98 
months (range: 0.1-30.4+) and 1.45 months (range: 0.1-25.6+) for rela+nivo FDC and nivolumab, 
respectively. 
Patient reported outcomes (PRO) 
Various PRO tools were used to measure changes in quality of life, including change in health status 
(EuroQoL EQ-5D), change in cancer-related symptoms and quality of life (FACT-M score), and impact 
of symptomatic AEs (FACIT GP5 item). In general, quality of life remained stable in both treatment 
arms and observed changes did not reach minimal important differences. Numerically slightly higher 
scores for nivolumab monotherapy were observed in some domains of these scores, however no 
clinically meaningful differences in health-related quality of life were observed between both treatment 
arms. 
•  Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses for PFS per BICR (primary definition) are presented in Figure 19. Biomarker data 
have been discussed before. For almost all other subgroups, HR was below 1. 
Additionally, subgroup analyses are shown for OS based on 28-Oct-2021 DBL (Figure 20) and results 
for most subgroups are in line with the ITT. However, data are considered preliminary as OS data are 
not yet fully mature.

Participants with Previously Untreated Metastatic or Unresectable Melanoma. 
Study identifier 
CA224047 
CA224047 is a multicentre, seamless Phase 2/3, randomised, double-blind study of 
relatlimab + nivolumab (FDC at a 1:3 ratio; BMS-986213) vs nivolumab monotherapy 
in subjects with previously untreated metastatic or unresectable melanoma. Subjects 
(adults and adolescents ≥ 12 years of age) were randomised 1:1 to treatment with 
BMS-986213 (relatlimab + nivolumab 160/480 mg IV Q4W FDC) or nivolumab 480 
mg IV Q4W and study treatment was continued until disease progression, treatment 
discontinuation, withdrawal of consent, or end of study. Randomisation was stratified 
by tumour PD-L1 expression (≥ 1% vs < 1%), LAG-3 expression (≥ 1% vs < 1%), 
BRAF mutation (V600 mutation positive vs V600 wild-type), and AJCCv8 M stage 
M0/M1any[0] vs M1any[1]).  As the indication is restricted to the patient population 
with tumour PD-L1 expression <1%, results described below refer to this patient 
group.

There was no dedicated study in special populations. 
A summary of the clinical trial by age is shown below. 
Table 29. Subjects in studies CA224020 and CA224047 by age groups
Paediatric population 
The applicant applies for the first line indication treatment of metastatic or unresectable (advanced) 
melanoma. This indication includes both adults and adolescents aged 12 to <18 years of age (weighing 
at least 40 kg), however no patients below the age of 18 years are included in the clinical studies for 
the fixed dose combination of relatlimab and nivolumab. The indication for adolescents will be based on 
extrapolation of adult data. Given the low incidence of advanced melanoma in the paediatric population 
it is difficult to enroll adolescents in clinical studies in this setting.  
The following points are considered important for assessment of extrapolation in the context of the 
favourable and unfavourable effects:  
- Confirmation that benefit/risk can be established and is positive in the source (adult) population  
- Confirmation that disease, progression of disease, treatment and prognosis is similar between ages  
- Confirmation that with the proposed dose, exposure in adolescents can be predicted and is 
comparable with adults  
- Confirmation that the PK/response- relation is comparable for adults and adolescents, or relation can 
be predicted from adult data  
- Evaluating the safety profile in adolescents

Similarity and differences in disease between adults and adolescents 
Primary melanoma tumour characteristics are considered to be comparable between adolescent and 
adult melanoma patients. In an analysis of 1,255 children (age less than 20 years), the 10-19-year-old 
group had similar baseline characteristics compared with the group of 20-24-year-old young adults 
(Strousse JJ et al., J Clin Oncology 2005).  
Similarity of advanced melanoma between adolescents and adults has been demonstrated by 
comparable general clinical characteristics: 
o  Histology: The frequency of histological subtypes, such as lentigo malignant melanoma, 
superficial spreading melanoma, acral lentiginous melanoma, and nodular melanoma in 
tumours of adolescent melanoma patients is comparable to melanoma tumours in adult 
patients. 
o  Clinical presentation: Primary tumour characteristics, such as the site of the primary tumour, 
stage at diagnosis, tumour thickness, or level of invasion were compared between paediatric 
and adult melanoma patients.  
o  Risk factors: Common risk factors for melanoma in paediatric and adult patients are 
intermittent intense sun exposure, tendency to sunburn, tendency to freckle, fair skin, blue or 
green eyes, and blond or red hair. Genetic predisposing conditions for developing melanoma, 
specifically in the paediatric population, do more frequently manifest in early childhood than in 
adolescence. 
o  Driver mutations: Among the paediatric melanomas, conventional melanoma, which 
predominantly occurs in adolescents, shares properties similar to adult melanomas, including 
mutation rates, high rate of single nucleotide variations that are characteristic of ultraviolet 
damage, and similar rate of activating BRAFV600 mutation (Lu C et al., J Invest Derm 2015; 
Newman S et al., Nat Med 2019; Bhram A et al., Pediatr Blood Cancer 2018) 
o  Survival: A literature search for studies investigating the survival in paediatric melanoma 
patients was conducted. The majority of publications show that the OS, including the subgroup 
of adolescent melanoma patients with regional or distant metastases, is similar to that from 
adult patients. 
o  Treatment: Current treatment strategies for paediatric and adolescent melanoma are based on 
clinical guidelines for adult patients (Bagnoni G et al., Pediatr Surg Int 2019). There are limited 
clinical studies evaluating treatment outcomes in these age groups. The number of patients in 
paediatric studies are generally small and the studies did not have a randomised design.  
o  The few clinical studies with radiotherapy and chemotherapy in paediatric patients with 
melanoma showed a comparable safety profile to adult patients. Tumour shrinkages in 
individual patients were reported. However, the design of the reported studies and the 
small number of adolescent melanoma patients enrolled do not allow for a conclusive 
comparison of efficacy to adult studies. 
o  Clinical studies with IFNα2b and high-dose IL-2 in paediatric patients showed the 
feasibility and overall comparable safety profile to adult patients. However, the number 
of enrolled paediatric melanoma patients in these studies is too small to make a 
conclusive statement about the efficacy of IL-2 or interferon treatment in paediatric 
melanoma in relation to adult patients. These treatment modalities have now largely 
been supplanted (Michielin O et al., Ann Oncol 2019) 
Assessment report  
EMA/720884/2022  
Page 100/147 
 
 
 
o  Targeted therapies: To date, there are limited data on the safety and efficacy of BRAF 
V600 targeted therapies (eg, vemurafenib and dabrafenib)26,27,28 in the paediatric 
population (ages 12-17 years). Similar to adult melanoma, paediatric CM is associated 
with a high somatic mutation load, high frequencies of activating BRAF mutations, and 
PTEN copy number changes, with resulting activation of MAPK and PI3K/AKT cellular 
signalling pathways (Davar D et al., J Invest Dermatol 2015). Real world data from the 
DMTR (n = 3775) showed that the proportion of adolescents and young adults initially 
treated with BRAF/MEK-inhibition and immune checkpoint inhibitors were 35.2% and 
33.8%, respectively (van der Kooij MK et al., Cancer 2020). Suggesting that BRAF and 
MEK inhibitors might also be active against adolescent melanoma. 
o  CTLA-4 inhibitor: Ipilimumab was evaluated in 2 trials of paediatric patients: (1) a 
dose-finding study in 33 patients aged 2 to 21 years with relapsed or refractory solid 
tumours, and (2) an open-label, single-arm trial in 12 adolescents aged 12 to 16 years 
with previously treated or untreated, unresectable Stage III or IV malignant 
melanoma. The overall safety profile of ipilimumab in children and adolescents was 
consistent with the safety profile in adults.  
o  PD-(L)1 Inhibitor: Clinical study CA209070 (NCT02304458), is an ongoing Phase ½ 
study of nivolumab with or without ipilimumab in children, adolescents, and young 
adults with recurrent or refractory solid tumours or sarcomas. The study includes 
patients older than 12 months of age to 30 years of age with variety of tumours 
occurring in children, such as lymphoma, neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, 
rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing Sarcoma as well as advanced melanoma. The study will 
eventually report on 242 patients.  
In addition, the Phase 1/2 study, KEYNOTE-051 (NCT02332668) (Geoerger B, et al., 
Lancet Oncol 2020), which evaluated the safety of pembrolizumab monotherapy in 154 
paediatric patients with advanced melanoma (5.2%), lymphoma (11.7%), and PD-L1 
positive advanced, relapsed/refractory solid tumours had shown that the safety profile 
was generally similar to that seen in adults. Pooled efficacy results for the solid 
tumours cohort reported an ORR of 5.9%, with no CRs and a PR rate of 8.9%. 
Exposure in adolescents and adults  
The applied indication for Opdualag is for patients ages 12 years and older. The dosing regimen for 
adolescent patients 12-18 years is based on popPK simulations. 
With respect to nivolumab, limited PK data in children and adolescents were available for patients with 
solid tumours. These paediatric PK data were included in the nivolumab popPK model. Comparison of 
the exposure data in the nivolumab popPK model indicate that adolescent subjects had 24% lower 
CL0, 28% lower CLSS, and 28% lower VC than corresponding parameters of adult subjects.  
Although limited nivolumab PK data in adolescent solid tumour patients indicate a reduced clearance of 
nivolumab in adolescents as compared to adults, with respect to relatlimab, no adolescent PK data 
were available. The consequences of either the presence or absence of a reduced clearance in 
adolescent patients on nivolumab and relatlimab exposure was further investigated. To this end, popPK 
simulations on the different scenarios, i.e., flat dose or weight-based dose, and decreased clearance in 
adolescents or comparable clearance in adolescents and adults. Based on these provided simulated 
exposure to relatlimab and nivolumab in adolescent and adult patients, applying a flat dose and taking 
into account either the presence or the absence of a reduced clearance in adolescents, sufficiently 
comparable exposure between adolescent and adults is demonstrated. Considering the comparable 
Assessment report  
EMA/720884/2022  
Page 101/147 
 
 
 
pathophysiology of melanoma in adolescents and adults, the proposal for a flat dose for relatlimab and 
nivolumab, being the same in adolescents and adults, is therefore supported.  
PK/response- relation for adults and adolescents  
As relatlimab and nivolumab are immune checkpoint inhibitors, the E-R resulting from relatlimab + 
nivolumab in adult and adolescent subjects with advanced melanoma is expected to be similar, based 
on the following biological and empirical evidence: 
o  The immune system in adolescents is fully mature with adult levels of T cells (Th1, Th2, 
cytotoxic T cells), dendritic and B cells, and is known to obtain adult levels of protection 
against infections. 
o  Relatlimab and nivolumab are IgG4 mAb targeting the LAG-3 and PD-1 receptors, respectively. 
Similar systemic exposures in adolescents and adults will therefore result in similar antibody-
target binding; therefore, the E-R of relatlimab in combination with nivolumab is expected to 
be the same. 
The exposure-effect relationships only have been investigated in adults.  
2.6.5.4.  In vitro biomarker test for patient selection for efficacy 
LAG-3 and PD-L1 were determined in Formalin
Fixed Paraffin
 Embedded (FFPE) Human Tissue 
Samples.  
LAG-3 assay 
‐
‐
LAG-3 expression was defined as the percentage of positive-staining immune cells with a 
morphological resemblance to lymphocytes relative to all nucleated cells within the tumour region in 
samples containing a minimum of 100 viable tumour cells. LAG-3 expression is scored on a continuous 
scale from 0, then increments of 1% from 1 – 5% (i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), followed by increments of 10 for 
samples with ≥ 10% of cells staining (i.e. 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100) LAG-3 positive cells. 
The final LAG-3 score is LAG-3 negative: <1% LAG-3 positive cells, or LAG-3 Positive: ≥1% LAG-3 
positive cells. 
LAG-3 analytical method  
The analytical method for LAG-3 in FFPE human tissue is determined at LabCorp using 
Immunohistochemistry performed on the Leica Bond III Automated Staining System. This assay is 
labelled as Research Use Only (RUO). In order to remove or reduce melanin pigmentation, which could 
interfere with LAG-3 staining interpretation, tissue slides are pretreated with a 3% hydrogen perioxide/ 
1x target retrieval solution pH9/methanol solution. Following the melanin removal process, tissue 
sections are incubated with a primary antibody that is directed specifically against the target epitope. 
In general, for this method, heat induced epitiope retrieval (HIER) pretreatment is used to enhance 
exposure of the epitope to the antibody. After incubating the tissue with the primary antibody, the 
bound antibody is detected using Bond Polymer Refine Detection reagents (Leica). This detection 
format uses a polymerbased, biotin-free system that complexes horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to the 
tissue-bound antibody. The antibody-HRP complexes are visualised using diaminobenzidine (DAB) 
which produces a brown reaction product. The specimen is then counterstained and coverslipped. 
Results are interpreted using a light microscope by a pathologist. 
Validation of the LAG-3 IHC assay was performed at LabCorp CMBP in accordance with LabCorp 
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and regulatory requirements to provide documentation of assay 
Assessment report  
EMA/720884/2022

performance characteristics and to ensure validity of the data produced. The original validation of LAG-
3 IHC was completed 27-Nov-2017. 
LAG-3 assay clinical validity 
No information on clinical validation was provided. This assay is labelled as Research Use Only (RUO). 
LAG-3 cut-point selection and validation 
The LAG-3 IHC assay is validated for exploratory purposes and has been used to stratify randomisation 
of subjects at a cut-off of 1%. Clinical validation has not been performed. About 75% of patients had 
LAG-3 ≥1% at baseline. 
No clinical cut-point has been selected and validated for this assay.  
PD-L1 assay 
PD-L1 positive staining is defined as complete circumferential and/or partial linear plasma membrane 
staining of tumour cells at any intensity. The entire specimen must be evaluated. All viable tumour 
cells on the entire PD-L1 stained patient slide must be evaluated and included in the PD-L1 scoring 
assessment. A minimum of 100 viable tumour cells should be present in the PD-L1 stained patient slide 
to determine the percentage of stained cells. Cytoplasmic staining, if present, is not considered for 
scoring purpose. Non-malignant cells and immune cells (e.g., infiltrating lymphocytes or macrophages) 
may also stain with PD-L1; however, these should not be included in the scoring for the determination 
of PD-L1 positivity. 
PD-L1 assay analytical method 
Two PD-L1 biomarker reports were submitted one for LabCorp CMBP NC which initially performed PD-
L1 testing and one for LabCorp LA used for the primary analysis and described here. The analytical 
method for PD-L1 determined at LabCorp LA used the immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay for the 
detection of PD-L1 clone 28-8 (Dako) in human formalin fixed embedded (FFPE) tissues. PD-L1 IHC 
28-8 pharmDx contains optimised reagents and protocol required to complete an IHC staining 
procedure of FFPE specimens using Dako Autostainer Link48 and PT Link Pre-treatment module. 
Following incubation with the primary monoclonal antibody to PD-L1 or the Negative Control Reagent 
(NCR), specimens are incubated with a linker antibody specific to the host species of the primary 
antibody and incubated with a ready-to-use visualisation reagent consisting of secondary antibody 
molecules and horseradish peroxidase molecules coupled to a dextran polymer backbone. The 
enzymatic conversion of the subsequently added chromogen results in precipitation of a visible reaction 
product at the site of antigen. The colour of the chromogenic reaction is modified by a chromogen 
enhancement reagent. The specimen may then be counterstained and coverslipped. Results are 
interpreted by a trained pathologist using a light microscope. 
Validation of the PD-L1 assay was performed in CLS Los Angeles in accordance with Covance Standard 
Operating Procedures (SOPs) and approved for use in 06-Nov-2017 (Melanoma Samples). The Dako 
PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx™ assay is labeled for Investigational Use Only (IUO). 
PD-L1 assay clinical validity 
No information on clinical validation was provided. The analytical method for PD-L1 in Formalin-Fixed 
Paraffin Embedded Human Tissue is Immunohistochemistry performed on Dako Autostainer Link48. 
This assay is labelled as Investigational Use Only (IUO). 
PD-L1 cut-point selection and validation 
The PD-L1 IHC assay is validated for exploratory purposes and has been used to stratify randomisation 
of subjects at a cut-off of 1%. Clinical validation has not been performed. About 40% of patients had

PD-L1 ≥1% at baseline. PFS by baseline PD-L1 expression showed a beneficial effect of the 
combination over nivo monotherapy in subjects with low PD-L1 expression (<1%). No beneficial effect 
was seen in subjects with PD-L1 ≥1%. Comparable results were seen based on a cut-off of 5% or 
10%.  
No clinical cut-point has been selected and validated for this assay. 
2.6.5.5.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Not applicable. 
2.6.5.6.  Supportive study(ies) 
The phase 1/2a study CA224020 provides support for antitumour activity of the combination treatment 
in the PD-L1 pretreated melanoma population, however this is not the current target population. Anti-
tumour activity was shown in subjects with 1L melanoma (Part C, see section on dose response study), 
but these results cannot be fully interpreted in the absence of a nivolumab monotherapy arm. 
Immunogenicity 
In Study CA224047, the incidence of relatlimab and nivolumab treatment emergent ADA and Nab were 
low (< 6%) in subjects who received rela+nivo FDC and nivolumab monotherapy. The incidence of 
nivolumab treatment emergent ADA, persistent ADA and NAb was similar in the FDC arm as compared 
to nivolumab monotherapy. There was no apparent trend showing an effect of ADA or NAb (either anti-
relatlimab or anti-nivolumab) on the efficacy of rela+nivo FDC based on the assessment of the 
presence of ADA and NAb in relation to PFS (per BICR). Comparable results were observed for the 
phase 1/2a study CA224020. 
Biomarker analysis plan 
The applicant presented a biomarker analysis plan, aimed to identify biomarkers that predict response 
to rela+nivo combination therapy and gain a better understanding of the mechanism of action of novel 
LAG-3 and PD1 dual checkpoint inhibition. The utility of LAG-3 and PD-L1 as predictive biomarkers is 
described above in section 2.6.5.4. Further investigations performed by the applicant are described 
here.  
LAG-3 as biomarker for treatment selection 
Retrospective analysis by LAG-3 status in CA209067 showed similar enrichment in efficacy by LAG-3 
expression when treated with nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab+ipilimumab combination as was 
shown in study CA224020 in patients previously treated with IO therapy. As LAG-3 expression was 
quantified as the percentage of LAG-3 positive lymphocytes among all nucleated cells, it is likely to 
correlate with overall infiltrating lymphocytes in the tumour. In CA224020, biomarker comparison 
revealed apparent correlation between LAG-3 IHC score and BMS-4 gene tumour inflammatory 
signature (data not shown). An “inflamed” tumour microenvironment and the presence of tumour 
infiltrating lymphocytes have been associated with improved response to anti-PD1 therapy in 
melanoma, so LAG-3 expression as presently quantified, reflecting tumour immune infiltrates, may be 
a general predictive marker for immune therapies that rely on the presence of infiltrating immune cells 
to mount anti-tumour response. According to the applicant, overall data support LAG-3 as a predictive 
marker for checkpoint blockade therapy but not specific to relatlimab.

Other exploratory biomarkers study CA224047 
In CA224047, exploratory biomarker analyses characterizing tumour and immune microenvironment 
and interrogating LAG-3 pathway were planned and data generation are ongoing. Amongst others 
tumour expression of CD8, MHC class I and class II at baseline, gene expression signature for tumour 
inflammation, and tumour TMB as measured by whole exome sequencing will be evaluated for 
association with response to rela+nivo therapy. Projected timeline for most biomarkers is Q2-Q3 2022 
(PAM-REC). 
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
This is a marketing authorisation application (MAA) for an intravenous (IV) fixed-dose combination 
(FDC) of relatlimab, a first in class human LAG-3 specific IgG4 antibody, and nivolumab. This 
application is based on the adaptive phase 2/3 pivotal clinical study CA224047, as described below. In 
addition, data from the phase 1/2 study CA224020 have been submitted to provide supportive 
evidence of efficacy for the proposed combination in unresectable or metastatic melanoma, including 
subjects with advanced (relapsed or refractory) melanoma previously treated with immunotherapies. 
The initially applied indication was:  
“Opdualag is indicated for the first-line treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma 
in adults and adolescents (12 years and older and weighing at least 40 kg).” 
The primary objective of Study CA224047 was to determine if relatlimab/nivolumab IV FDC improves 
PFS, assessed per BICR, compared with nivolumab, which is a current standard of care in this patient 
population (adults only). 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The rationale for the dual blockade is supported by co-expression of LAG-3 and PD-1 on infiltrated 
lymphocytes and synergistic anti-tumour activity in mouse tumour models. Relatlimab monotherapy up 
to 800 mg elicited only one PR (n=25) in the phase 1/2a study CA224020. Available data indicate that 
LAG-3 monotherapy will not lead to clinically meaningful benefit for the target population and the lack 
of a relatlimab monotherapy arm in the pivotal trial is acceptable. Overall, it is considered adequate to 
investigate the efficacy in the first line setting, as in the relapsed/refractory setting with PD-L1 pre-
treated patients’ outcomes did not appear promising, based on the results of the CA224020 study, with 
an expected ORR of around 10%. 
The phase 2/3 recommended dose of rela+nivo FDC of 160/480 mg Q4W in adults was based on an 
integrated assessment of relatlimab and nivolumab data from in vitro and preclinical studies, as well as 
clinical PK, PD, safety, and efficacy results from the phase 1/2a study CA224020. Treatment with 
rela+nivo 80/240 mg Q2W induced responses in heavily pretreated advanced solid tumours. The dose 
of 160/480 mg Q4W was supported by model-based simulations predicting similar exposure and 
receptor occupancy between rela+nivo 80/240 mg Q2W and 160/480 mg Q4W. Exposure-response 
relationships suggest flat relationships for both efficacy and safety, including the full PK data from Part 
E investigating relatlimab 480 mg vs. 160 mg Q4W. The applicant presented preliminary efficacy and 
safety results of the two doses of relatlimab (480 mg vs. 160 mg Q4W) in the first line melanoma 
setting from part E. Preliminary efficacy results indicate that ORR was higher with the higher relatlimab 
dose, however, tolerability appeared lower. Overall, these findings support the phase 2/3 
recommended dose to a sufficient extent although predominantly based on safety/tolerability. The lack 
of a nivolumab monotherapy within study CA224020 precludes conclusions on the efficacy of the 
combination treatment over monotherapy in the 1L melanoma setting (Part C). Treatment with the 
FDC showed comparable safety to co-administration of the single agents, supported by PK exposure

data. The FDC was selected to provide convenient infusion preparation and rapid administration, as 
well as to decrease dosing and administration errors. Such simplification of therapy is insufficient by 
itself for a complete justification of a FDC (FDC guideline, EMA/CHMP/158268/2017), however, there is 
also no objection in terms of limitation of dose adjustments for the individual components as no dose 
changes are allowed. The proposed infusion time is 30 minutes, whereas a 60-minute infusion time 
was used in the clinical studies. This is further discussed in the PK and safety section.   
The pivotal trial study CA224047 was a global, double-blind, randomised, adaptive phase 2/3 study 
comparing rela+nivo FDC with nivolumab in patients with previously untreated, unresectable, or 
metastatic melanoma. The overall study design is acceptable, as also stated at the time of a first initial 
SA received in January 2020 (EMEA/H/SA/4345/1/2019/II). The study enrolled male and female 
subjects, sought to enrol ≥ 12 years of age, with histologically confirmed Stage III (unresectable) or 
Stage IV melanoma (AJCC 8th), with no prior systemic anticancer therapy for advanced melanoma. 
Specified prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant melanoma therapies were permitted. Patients with uveal 
melanoma, active or untreated brain metastases, active autoimmune disease, and a history of 
myocarditis, and those with a baseline elevated troponin > 2xULN were excluded from the study. The 
in- and exclusion criteria largely reflect the target population, although somewhat healthier, and 
resemble that of clinical studies in the same setting. Exclusion of subjects with a history of myocarditis 
and elevated troponin was based on preclinical findings, myocarditis being an IMAE for nivolumab, and 
a case of Grade 4 myocarditis reported in Study CA224020. 
Subjects were randomised 1:1 to treatment with relatlimab + nivolumab 160/480 mg IV Q4W FDC 
(BMS-986213) or nivolumab 480 mg IV Q4W, and randomisation was stratified based on LAG-3 
expression (≥ 1% vs < 1%), tumour cell PD-L1 expression (≥ 1% vs < 1%), BRAF mutation (V600 
mutation positive vs V600 wild-type), and AJCC v8 M stage (M0/M1Any[0] vs M1Any[1]). BRAF 
mutation and elevated LDH (stage M1Any[1]) are well known prognostic factors. Stratification by LAG-
3 and PD-L1 is supported given their potential predictive value. Nivolumab monotherapy or in 
combination with ipilimumab is the standard of care for the target population and an appropriate 
comparator, as is the recommended dose of 480 mg Q4W over 60 minutes iv infusion.  
The phase 2/3 adaptive trial design is acceptable. As the PFS IA met the pre-specified HR of ≤ 0.8 
after 425 subjects were enrolled, the study transitioned seamlessly to Phase 3. During a follow-up SA 
procedure, received in May 2020 (EMEA/H/SA/4345/1/FU/1/2020/II), a second interim analysis (PFS 
IA2) was proposed by the applicant. This was discouraged and the recommendation was followed by 
the applicant. The primary endpoint is PFS by BICR using RECIST v1.1 with OS as the key secondary 
endpoint. PFS is an acceptable endpoint provided mature OS data exclude a negative effect are 
available and the effect is homogenous across important sub-populations. ORR was also part of the 
hierarchical testing strategy after OS and was not considered mature until all subjects had the 
potential for 7 months of follow-up. For the primary analysis, a primary and secondary definition of PFS 
were defined. These differed by how subsequent anti-cancer medication prior to BICR-determined 
progression was handled (i.e. censored or not). Further definitions of events and censoring rules were 
standard, and a number of sensitivity analyses were pre-specified.  
A total of 1,281 patients were enrolled in the study. Among them 714 (55.7%) were randomised in the 
study, 355 subjects received rela+nivo FDC and 359 received nivolumab monotherapy. The main 
reason for screening failure was “no longer meeting study criteria” (n=465; 36.3%). These included 
unevaluable PD-L1, LAG-3, and/or BRAF status, worsening of ECOG PS, and presence of exclusionary 
brain metastases with no single predominant reason.  
Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were balanced across the treatment arms. The 
median age was 63 years (range: 20-94), 58.3% were male and 96.6% were white. ECOG 
performance status score was 0 (33.1%) or 1 (66.9%). The majority of the patients had AJCC stage IV 
Assessment report

disease (91.7%); 38.9% had M1c disease at study entry. A slightly higher percentage was observed in 
the rela+nivo FDC arm. Thirty-eight percent of subjects had BRAF mutation-positive melanoma, 36.1% 
had baseline LDH level greater than ULN at study entry, and 2.7% had a history of brain metastases. 
Forty-one percent of subjects had PD-L1 ≥1% tumour cell membrane expression and 75.2% had LAG-
3 ≥1% expression. Eight percent of subjects received prior adjuvant therapy. 
Study enrolment was paused for the PFS IA of phase 2, thereafter enrolment was slowed down for 
about 6 months due to the pandemic. Demographic and baseline disease characteristics were largely 
comparable between the phase 2 and phase 3 part, except for a higher proportion of subjects with 
ECOG 1 in the phase 3 part (42.9% vs 26.4%). Differences (<10%) were also seen for baseline 
LDL>ULN (higher in phase 3 part) and metastasis M1c (lower in phase 3 part). In addition, more 
patients were included from Latin America in the phase 3 part compared to the phase 2 part (42.9% vs 
20.5%) due to additional recruitment from this region. PFS analyses were also presented separately 
for the phase 2 and phase 3 part of the study to rule out, to the extent possible, that the decision to 
proceed to phase 3 was not based on over-optimistic phase 2 results. Divergent results were seen 
between the two phases with clearly separating KM-curves in the phase 2 part and (party) overlapping 
curves in the phase 3 part of the study. Though differences in baseline characteristics and follow-up 
may partly explain this divergent result, there was no single baseline characteristic that could explain 
the observed differences. As the decision to proceed to phase 3 was made by the DMC independently 
of the company and in a blinded manner, it appears reasonable to conclude that the decision was not 
based on over-optimistic phase 2 results.  
Changes in primary endpoint for the phase 2 part (PFS instead of ORR) and the order of statistical 
testing of the phase 3 part secondary endpoints were driven by external evidence and not considered 
to impact the study integrity or outcome. There were, in general, no issues raised during the 
assessment concerning the conduct of the studies submitted. The majority of subjects had any 
important protocol deviation, however a limited number had deviations that could potentially impact 
study outcomes. GCP inspections from competent authorities support GCP compliance.  
Study CA224020 provides limited supported evidence for efficacy of the combination treatment in the 
1L target population (Part C) as a nivolumab monotherapy arm was not included. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
At the time of the database lock (9 March 2021), 33.0% and 35.1% subjects remained on treatment in 
the rela+nivo FDC and nivolumab arms, respectively. The most common reason for treatment 
discontinuation in both groups was progressive disease; a higher percentage within the nivolumab arm 
discontinued due to disease progression (46.0%) compared with the rela+nivo FDC arm (36.3%), 
while discontinuation due to study drug toxicity was more frequent in those receiving rela+nivo FDC 
(17.7% vs 8.9% in the nivolumab arm).  
At the time of the final PFS the median duration of follow-up was 13.21 months (range: 0-33.1); the 
median duration of therapy was 5.55 months (range: 0.0, 31.5) and 4.86 months (range: 0.0, 32.2), 
for the rela+nivo FDC and nivolumab monotherapy arm, respectively. In all randomised subjects, 
rela+nivo FDC showed a statistically significant improvement in PFS vs nivolumab monotherapy, HR: 
0.75 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.92). Median PFS improved from 4.63 (95% CI: 3.38, 5.62) to 10.12 (95% CI: 
6.37, 15.74) months; the improvement in median PFS of 5.5 months is considered of clinical 
relevance. The primary PFS analysis is supported by several sensitivity analyses and investigator 
assessed PFS.  
As of 9 March 2021, about 40-50% of subjects are censored and remain in follow up and median 
treatment duration is low. An updated PFS analysis, including sensitivity analyses, was performed at 
the time of the OS analysis, 28-Oct-2021 DBL, with a median extent of follow-up of 19.27 months, and 
Assessment report

the median duration of therapy was 8.3 months in the nivo+rela FDC arm and 6.5 months in the 
nivolumab monotherapy arm. This analysis included an additional 46 PFS events and supported the 
primary analysis.  
Additional sensitivity analyses were performed post-hoc to justify the assumption of non-informative 
censoring, including subsequent anticancer therapy as PFS event, combining investigator assessment 
and BICR for PFS events, counting non-administrative censored times as events, as well as further 
information after treatment discontinuation. These analyses were reassuring that any potentially 
informative censoring did not have an influence on the results and related conclusions of efficacy in the 
ITT population (both for the 09-Mar-2021 DBL and 28-Oct-2021 DBL).  
The observed median PFS in the control arm is somewhat lower than expected based on the results in 
study CA209067 (median PFS of 4.6 months vs. 6.9 months), although based on an indirect 
comparison. Potential reasons for the observed difference are differences in study design (e.g. BICR vs 
investigator assessment and need for confirmation) as well as differences in patient characteristics. 
Median OS appears comparable and there are no concerns on the (external) validity of the obtained 
results.  
The primary endpoint PFS in the ITT population is supported by the key secondary endpoints OS and 
ORR (28-Oct-2021 DBL). With a median follow-up of 19.27 months, 39% OS events with rela+nivo 
FDC and 45% with nivo monotherapy were observed. The OS results did not reach statistical 
significance (final OS analysis). Median OS was not reached (95% CI: 34.20, NR) in the nivo+rela FDC 
arm and 34.10 (95% CI: 25.23, NR) months in the nivolumab monotherapy arm. Nevertheless, the KM 
curves showed that the nivo+rela FDC arm was well above the nivolumab monotherapy arm 
throughout the follow-up period for the ITT population, supporting a trend for an OS benefit and 
excluding a detrimental effect. In addition, confirmed ORR per BICR showed a 10.3% (95% CI: 3.4, 
17.3) increase in ORR for the combination treatment over nivolumab. However, statistical testing was 
not performed due to the hierarchical testing strategy (ORR after OS).   
Median PFS2 was not yet reached with combination treatment and about 20 months for the nivolumab 
monotherapy arm (HR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.97). However, results should be interpreted cautiously 
as this was an exploratory endpoint. About 30% of patients in both treatment arms received 
subsequent systemic therapy during follow-up, predominantly targeted BRAF/MEK inhibitors or 
PD1/CTLA4 inhibitors. Updated analysis confirmed the previous analysis with a median PFS2 of 30.23 
months and 20.04 months for rela+nivo FDC and nivolumab monotherapy, respectively (28-Oct-2021 
DBL; HR 0.76 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.93)). 
A beneficial effect of rela+nivo FDC over nivo monotherapy on PFS was shown independent of LAG-3 
status (either cut-off ≥ 1% or ≥ 5%). Comparable HRs were observed for LAG-3 low expression (<1%, 
HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.54, 1.15) and LAG-3 high expression (≥ 1%, HR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.59, 0.95), 
supported by a clear separation of KM-curves. These data suggest clinical benefit from rela+nivo FDC 
irrespective of LAG-3 expression level and do not support the utility of LAG-3 as a biomarker selecting 
differential benefit by rela+nivo FDC over nivolumab monotherapy. In subjects with PD-L1 low 
expression the use of the combination appears to offer additional benefit while there is little additional 
benefit observed in subjects with a higher expression on PD-L1 (HR 0.66; 95% CI: 0.54, 0.84 vs HR 
0.95; 95% CI: 0.68, 1.33 with a cut-off of 1%). In the subgroup with PD-L1 ≥ 1%, median PFS was 
comparable for both treatment arms (15.74 months vs 14.72 months) and KM-curves overlap. These 
results suggest that PD-L1 status modifies the treatment effect of rela+nivo FDC compared to nivo 
monotherapy. Based on the current PFS results, patients with a high PD-L1 expression respond well to 
nivolumab monotherapy and there is little additional benefit of relatlimab in combination with 
nivolumab. For the low PD-L1 expression group, patients on nivolumab monotherapy performed poorly, 
with a large proportion having experienced a PFS event (presumably death) before the first 
Assessment report

assessment for progression scheduled at 12 weeks. In this patient subgroup, there is some benefit to 
the addition of relatlimab particularly for the LAG-3 ≥ 1% group.  
As of the 28-Oct-2021 DBL, similar PFS results were obtained for PD-L1 positive patients (cut-off >1%) 
with a HR 0.96 (95% CI: 0.70, 1.31) and median PFS of 15.74 months versus 14.72 months for 
nivo+rela FDC and nivolumab monotherapy, respectively, and overlapping K-M curves. Exploratory 
analyses showed that PFS and OS were longer in responders compared to non-responders in both 
subgroups. However, these analyses are based on post-randomisation events of CR and PR and 
inference of PFS/OS gain from these data is questionable. It is acknowledged that at the time of the 
MAA of the combination treatment of nivolumab + ipilimumab (EPAR EMEA/H/C/002213/II0055 and 
EMEA/H/C/003985/II/003 and 0032) a 10% difference in ORR, in the absence of an effect on PFS and 
OS, was considered potentially of clinical relevance in the PD-L1 positive subgroup based on similar 
analyses. At that time there was uncertainty, amongst others, related to the available IHC PD-L1 assay 
not being able to provide a clear demarcation of a bimodal population that could be defined by a 
dichotomous cut-off and potential heterogeneity within the subjects’ tumours. Ultimately, an “all-
comer” population was granted and the differential efficacy based on PD-L1 subgroup was reflected in 
the indication. This approach is no longer deemed acceptable. Of more importance, long term data up 
till 60 months of follow-up do not indicate a PFS/OS benefit for ipi+nivo in the PD-L1 ≥1% subgroup 
(see SmPC Yervoy), questioning the prior assumption that the observed ORR difference translates into 
long term benefit (at least within a reasonable timeframe). Overall, a clinical benefit of the addition of 
relatlimab to nivolumab over nivolumab monotherapy has not been made plausible/demonstrated in 
the PD-L1≥1% subgroup.   
The current understanding of LAG-3 is still very limited, including its signalling mechanism and the 
ligands involved. It also remains unclear whether LAG-3 could be a predictive or prognostic biomarker 
in melanoma. In addition, the exact mechanisms of the synergistic or additive action of LAG-3 with PD-
1 remains unknown. Additional data presented by the applicant suggest that LAG-3 expression as 
presently quantified, reflecting tumour immune infiltrates, may be a general predictive marker for 
immune therapies that rely on the presence of infiltrating immune cells to mount an anti-tumour 
response. The current data showing a beneficial effect of the combination independent of LAG-3 
expression, do not support the utility of LAG-3 for patient selection for efficacy. Initially the applicant 
did not consider PD-L1 suitable for patient selection of efficacy based on the confidence intervals of HR, 
encompassing the point estimates of HR for low and high PD-L1 expression and the all-comer HR. 
Further, receiver operating characteristic analyses indicate that PD-L1 is not a reliable predictor of 
efficacy for either treatment, at any threshold. However, these analyses do not provide insight into the 
PD-L1 cut-off for which the added benefit of relatlimab is demonstrated. Experience with PD-1/L1 
inhibitors has increased over the past years and there are several examples in which indications are 
restricted based on PD-1/L1. It is acknowledged that biomarker-defined subgroups were not alpha-
controlled in the current study, in contrast to other cases, however these were still pre-planned in the 
SAP. In addition, the PD-L1 cut off of 1% was chosen as a stratification factor based on previous data 
showing an association between PD-L1 expression and outcomes. Therefore, PD-L1 of 1% is 
considered a reasonable cut-off point. Overall, it was considered that the clinical benefit of the addition 
of relatlimab to nivolumab monotherapy has not been made plausible/demonstrated in the PD-L1 ≥1 
subgroup. The applicant has restricted the indication by tumour PD-L1<1%. 
Additional analyses of biomarker data from study CA224047 are ongoing and the applicant will submit 
these data when available to better understand the role of LAG-3 inhibition in combination with PD-1 
inhibition and a further insight into potential responders/non-responders (PAM-REC).  
Exploratory subgroup analyses for PFS support a beneficial effect of rela+nivo FDC over nivo 
monotherapy in most important subgroups as HR was below 1. This includes important subgroups with 
a worse prognosis like BRAF mutation, high HDL and baseline metastasis stage of M1c.

Adolescents 
There were no adolescents included in the phase 1/2a or the phase 2/3 studies. Efficacy assessment is 
based on the extrapolation concept, assuming that disease, progression of disease, treatment and 
prognosis is similar for adolescents and adults. Furthermore, the proposed doses should lead to 
comparable exposure and PK/response relation should be similar as well.  
The applicant has submitted data to address these issues support the extrapolation of adult data to the 
adolescent population.   
Indeed, disease histology, genetic background, treatment and prognosis of metastatic melanoma 
appears to be comparable for adults and adolescents, therefore comparable efficacy of anti-melanoma 
therapies might be expected in these patients populations. Nivolumab and relatlimab, are both check 
point inhibitors stimulating the anti-tumour immune response. As the immune system in adolescents 
are mature, it can be assumed that these agents simulate the immune system in adolescents in a 
comparable manner as in adults.  
The added benefit of relatlimab appears dependent on the level of PDL1 expression. The indication is 
restricted by tumour PD-L1<1%, which is also applicable to adolescents. 
No paediatric efficacy data for nivolumab and relatlimab combination therapy and only very limited 
efficacy data for other treatments, is available to support the expected similar efficacy. For the 
treatment of advanced melanoma in adolescents only ipilimumab is approved. Approval of ipilimumab 
for adolescents was based on extrapolation of adult efficacy data which was accepted given a similar 
course of the disease and an overlapping PK in combination with limited efficacy data showing a similar 
trend of efficacy in adolescents and adults with advanced melanoma.  
One of the principles of the extrapolation concept is that comparable drug exposure will lead to 
comparable efficacy.  
Limited nivolumab PK data in adolescent solid tumour patients indicate a reduced clearance and 
volume of distribution of nivolumab in adolescents as compared to adults. However, with respect to 
relatlimab, no adolescent PK data were available. The consequences of either the presence or absence 
of a reduced clearance and volume of distribution in adolescent patients on nivolumab and relatlimab 
exposure was further investigated. To this end, popPK simulations on the different scenarios, i.e., flat 
dose or weight-based dose, and decreased clearance and volume of distribution in adolescents or 
comparable clearance and volume of distribution in adolescents and adults were conducted. Based on 
these provided simulated exposure to relatlimab and nivolumab in adolescent and adult patients, 
applying a flat dose and taking into account either the presence or the absence of a reduced clearance 
in adolescents, sufficiently comparable exposure between adolescent and adults is demonstrated. 
Considering the comparable pathophysiology of melanoma in adolescents and adults, the proposal for 
a flat dose for relatlimab and nivolumab, being the same in adolescents and adults, is therefore 
supported.  
Furthermore, for extrapolation PK/response relation for adults and adolescents need to be comparable.  
Considering the mode of action of relatlimab and nivolumab which are immune checkpoint inhibitors 
and that the immune system of adolescents is fully mature with adult levels of T cells dendritic and B 
cells, the exposure response relation for relatlimab + nivolumab in adult and adolescent is expected to 
be comparable, provided that PDL1 expression is similar in adult and adolescent tumours and that with 
the proposed dosing the receptor binding (occupancy) is comparable.  
The exposure-effect relationships, only based on adult patients, have been investigated.  
Assessment report  
EMA/720884/2022  
Page 110/147 
 
 
 
With respect to the exposure-peripheral receptor occupancy (OR), the predicted peripheral LAG-3 RO 
was similar between relatlimab/nivolumab 80/240 mg Q2W regimen and the requested 
relatlimab/nivolumab 160/480 mg Q4W dose regimen. LAG-3 RO was higher following a dose of 
relatlimab/nivolumab 480/480 mg Q4W as compared to 160/480 mg Q4W; The clinical relevance of 
this increased RO at higher dose is not completely clear, considering the flat exposure-PFS analysis, 
but at the same time the dose-dependent exposure-OR relationship.  
With respect to the exposure-efficacy, PFS, OS, and OR were significantly associated with relatlimab 
exposure, resulting in a longer PFS or OS and higher OR compared to nivolumab monotherapy. The 
efficacy for all the PFS and OS endpoints was similar across the range of relatlimab exposures 
(Cavgd28) produced by nivolumab/relatlimab 240/80 mg Q2W, 480/160 mg Q4W, and 480/480 mg 
Q4W suggesting a flat E-R for efficacy. This flat E-R was shown to be applicable both for 1L and prior-
IO melanoma patients. Some uncertainty on the E-R comes from the exposure-OR analyses, where OR 
is predicted to be higher with higher doses of relatlimab (480 mg vs. 160 mg and 80 mg Q4W). 
However, tolerability also appears lower with the higher relatlimab dose. 
With respect to the exposure-Grade 2+ immune-mediated adverse events, as well as the exposure 
Grade 3+ drug-related adverse events, the risk of these Gr2 and Gr3 AEs was significantly associated 
with relatlimab and nivolumab exposure, resulting in a higher risk in relatlimab + nivolumab 
combination compared with nivolumab monotherapy. Nivolumab exposure was not significantly 
associated with the risk of Gr3+ Drug-related adverse events. The risk for these Gr2 and Gr3 AEs was 
similar across the range of relatlimab exposures produced by the studied combination dosing regimen 
in Studies CA224020 and CA224047, supporting a flat relatlimab E-R relationship over this exposure 
range. 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The improvement in median PFS of 5.5 months for the combination treatment compared to 
monotherapy could be considered clinically relevant in the ITT population. The primary endpoint is 
supported by a trend for OS benefit whereas a detrimental effect is excluded. However, the effect in 
the ITT population is driven by the subgroup of PD-L1 <1%; a beneficial effect of adding relatlimab to 
nivolumab has not been demonstrated/made plausible in the PD-L1 ≥1% subgroup which responds 
well to nivolumab monotherapy.  
Regarding to adolescents, based on similarity of disease and response to treatment, extrapolation of 
efficacy from adults to adolescents can be acceptable, provided exposures between adults and 
adolescent (≥ 12 years) are similar. Based on the provided simulated exposure to relatlimab and 
nivolumab in adolescent and adult patients, applying a flat dose and taking into account either the 
presence or the absence of a reduced clearance and volume of distribution in adolescents, sufficiently 
comparable exposure between adolescent and adults is demonstrated. Considering the comparable 
pathophysiology of melanoma in adolescents and adults, the proposal for a flat dose regimen for 
relatlimab and nivolumab, being the same in adolescents and adults, is therefore supported. 
The finally agreed indication is: “Opdualag is indicated for the first-line treatment of advanced 
(unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older with PD-L1 
<1%.”

was no pooling of safety data from CA224047 and CA224020 due to the differences in study design 
(see Table 2). Data from the higher dose of rela+ nivo 480 mg/480 mg Q4w from part E of study 
CA22402 were not included in the safety database.  
The issues that warranted increased attention during the conduct of Studies CA224047 and CA224020 
included: 
-  Myocarditis was initially identified as a potential safety concern due to the observation of early, 
lethal myocarditis in LAG-3/PD-1 double knockout mouse models, coupled with emerging literature 
describing a low risk of severe checkpoint inhibitor-associated myocarditis in the post approval 
setting. Myocarditis was also identified as an IMAE for Nivolumab in 2016. A case of Grade 4 
myocarditis was reported in May 2016 in Study CA224020 at the rela+nivo dose of 240/240 mg IV 
Q2W. Troponin monitoring was included in Study CA224047 as a pilot to determine if increased 
surveillance could support identification of early myocarditis, and to permit characterisation of the 
frequency and severity of myocarditis with rela+nivo FDC compared with an established anti-PD-1 
monotherapy. The timeframe of 2 months was selected based on the median time-to-onset of 
observed myocarditis cases within Study CA224020 at the time of implementation and the safety 
data from Nivolumab programme. Both myocarditis and troponin elevation terms are OESIs, 
permitting characterisation of the potential risk of myocarditis identified in the pre-clinical setting. 
-  CNS vasculitis and mild inflammation of the choroid plexus and brain vasculature were observed 
during pre-clinical general toxicity testing in cynomolgus monkeys. Due to the rare, but known, 
risk of immune-mediated events of the CNS with established immuno-oncology agents, CNS 
adverse event terms were added to the OESI category to support detection and reporting, 
including demyelination, meningitis and encephalitis. There are no routine laboratory or imaging 
evaluations that would enhance safety monitoring for CNS events within these clinical studies 
beyond clinical observation.  
-  Hypersensitivity/infusion reactions: Because both relatlimab and nivolumab contain only human 
immunoglobulin protein sequences, they have a low risk of inducing immunogenicity or associated 
infusion or hypersensitivity reactions. Given a theoretical risk of infusion reactions with the new 
FDC formulation, a safety lead-in in Study CA224047 was employed for the first 18 subjects 
randomised to monitor for Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions; no risks were identified in the safety 
lead-in study. 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
The majority of subjects in both treatment arms received ≥ 90% of the intended dose intensity (87% 
and 85%), and approximately one-third of subjects received ≥ 12 months of study drug, which was 
comparable between the BMS-986213 and nivolumab monotherapy treatment (29% and 28%). Median 
treatment duration was about 5 months (Table 30 and Table 31).

Common Adverse Events 
There is a higher numerical incidence of grade 3-4 AEs in the rela+nivo FDC group vs nivo, 39.4% vs. 
31.8%. There is no specific adverse event to which this increased incidence might be attributed. 
Drug-Related Adverse Events  
The most frequently reported any grade drug-related AEs (≥ 15% of subjects) were (Table 32):  
-  Rela+nivo FDC: pruritus (23.4%), fatigue (23.1%), rash (15.5%); 
-  Nivolumab: pruritus (15.9%).  
The most frequently reported drug-related Grade 3-4 AEs (≥ 1% of subjects) were: 
-  Rela+nivo FDC: lipase increased (1.7%), ALT increased (1.4%), AST increased (1.4%), fatigue 
(1.1%);

-  Nivolumab: None; all drug-related Grade 3-4 AEs by PT occurred in < 1% of subjects. 
Select Adverse Events (select AEs) 
Select AEs have been defined as AEs that:  
- 
differ from non-immunotherapies 
-  may require immunosuppression 
- 
- 
early recognition may mitigate severe toxicity 
for which multiple event terms may be used to describe a single type of AE, thereby necessitating 
the pooling of terms for full characterisation 
The majority of select AEs reported were Grade 1 or 2 and most were considered drug-related by the 
investigator. The most frequently reported drug-related select AEs by PT (any grade; rela+nivo FDC vs 
nivo; ≥ 10% of rela+nivo FDC subjects) were: 
- pruritus (23.4% vs 15.9%) 
- rash (15.5% vs 12.0%) 
- hypothyroidism (14.4% vs 12.0%) 
- diarrhoea (13.5% vs 9.2%) 
- vitiligo (10.4% vs 9.7%).  
The most frequently reported Grade 3-4 drug-related select AEs by PT (rela+nivo FDC vs nivo; ≥ 1% 
of rela+nivo FDC subjects) were increased ALT (1.4% vs 0.6%) and increased AST (1.4% vs 
0.3%). 
Most of drug-related select AEs resolved, except for endocrine AEs that made endocrine suppletion or 
suppression permanently necessary (Table 33).

Immune-mediated Adverse Events (IMAEs) 
IMAEs are defined as events 
-  within 100 days of the last dose and 
- 
- 
treated with immunosuppression or 
any endocrine AEs 
The most frequently reported IMAEs (any grade; rela+nivo FDC vs nivo; ≥ 5% of rela+nivo FDC 
subjects) were: 
- hypothyroidism (16.6% vs 13.1%) 
- rash (9.3% vs 6.7%) 
- diarrhoea/colitis (6.8% vs 3.1%) 
- hyperthyroidism (6.2% vs 6.7%)

- hepatitis (5.6% vs 2.5%).  
The most frequently reported Grade 3-4 IMAEs (rela+nivo FDC vs nivo; ≥ 1% of rela+nivo FDC 
subjects) were: 
- hepatitis (3.9% vs 1.1%) 
- adrenal insufficiency (1.4% vs 0.8%) 
- nephritis/renal dysfunction (1.1% vs 1.1%) 
- diarrhoea/colitis (1.1% vs 1.4%). 
Most drug-related select AEs and all causality IMAEs (except for endocrine events) had resolved at the 
time of database lock. Across the categories, the median time to resolution of drug-related select AEs 
ranged from 0.14 (range 0.1-8.1) weeks to 12.43 (range: 0.9-51.0+) weeks, and the median time to 
resolution of IMAEs ranged from 0.14 (range: 0.1- 0.1) weeks to 25.43 (0.6+-104.0+) weeks. 
2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
As of the 09-Mar-2021 DBL, 30.4% subjects in the rela+nivo FDC arm and 33.1% of subjects in the 
nivolumab monotherapy arm died during the study (Table 34). Disease progression was the most 
common cause of death in both arms. A similar proportion of subjects in the rela+nivo FDC (0.8%; 3 
subjects) and nivolumab (0.6%; 2 subjects) arms died due to study drug toxicity during the study. Per 
Investigator, causes of death due to study drug toxicity in the rela+nivo FDC arm were 
haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, acute oedema of lung, and pneumonitis.  
Table 34. Death summary, All treated subjects in study CA224047 
Deaths attributed to other reasons were reported in 14 (3.9%) subjects in the rela+nivo FDC arm 
and 16 (4.5%) subjects in the nivolumab arm. Deaths due to AEs considered unrelated to study drug 
by investigators were balanced between treatment arms, including deaths attributed to COVID-19 (3 in 
the rela+nivo FDC arm and 4 in the nivolumab monotherapy arm). Of the subjects who died due to 
COVID-19, 5 subjects had already experienced disease progression per BICR prior to death.

CA224047 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
Overall, 34% and 29% of patients in rela+nivo FDC and nivo, respectively, experienced a SAE (any 
grade). The most frequently reported (≥ 1% of subjects) any-grade SAEs were: 
- Rela+nivo FDC: malignant neoplasm progression (3.7%), adrenal insufficiency, myocarditis, back 
pain, colitis, and diarrhoea (1.1% each);  
- Nivolumab: malignant neoplasm progression (5.3%). 
The frequency of specific drug-related SAEs was so low (<2%), that no pattern of drug-related SAEs 
could be established. 
Of SAEs attributed to study drug by the investigator, there were 4 reported events total that were 
considered rare for immuno-oncology agents in the rela+nivo FDC arm affecting individual subjects 
(haemolytic anaemia, Guillain-Barré syndrome, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease and hemophagocytic 
lymphohistiocytosis), and 1 event in the nivolumab arm (acquired haemophilia). 
Other Events of Special Interest (OESIs) 
OESIs are events that do not fulfil all criteria to qualify as select AEs or IMAEs. These events may differ 
from those caused by non-immunotherapies and may require immunosuppression as part of their 
management. OESIs included the following categories: demyelination, encephalitis, Guillain Barré 
syndrome, myasthenic syndrome, pancreatitis, uveitis, myositis/rhabdomyolysis, myocarditis, graft 
versus host disease, troponin elevation, and meningitis. 
Overall, OESIs were reported in 62/355 subjects (17.5%; 83 OESIs) in the rela+nivo FDC arm and 
49/359 subjects (13.6%; 75 OESIs) in the nivolumab arm. 
In the rela+nivo FDC arm, the OESIs reported were Guillain Barré syndrome (1 [0.3%] subject; 1 
event), pancreatitis (4 [1.1%] subjects; 5 events), uveitis (6 [1.7%] subjects; 9 events), encephalitis 
(2 [0.6%] subjects; 3 events), myositis/rhabdomyolysis (2 [0.6%] subjects; 3 events), myocarditis (6 
Assessment report  
EMA/720884/2022  
Page 120/147 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[1.7%] subjects; 9 events), and troponin elevation (41 [11.5%] subjects; 53 events). There were no 
events in the categories of myasthenic syndrome, demyelination, meningitis, and graft versus host 
disease. Of the 83 OESIs, 76 OESIs in the rela+nivo FDC arm were resolved at the time of DBL: 45 
troponin events, 9 myocarditis events, 8 uveitis events, 3 encephalitis events, 3 myositis events, 3 
pancreatitis events, and 1 Guillain Barré Syndrome.  
All resolved events of myocarditis, uveitis, encephalitis, myositis, pancreatitis, and Guillain Barré 
Syndrome were resolved with immune-modulating medication (IMM); only 3/45 troponin events were 
resolved with IMM. 
In the nivolumab arm, the OESIs reported were pancreatitis (4 [1.1%] subjects; 6 events), uveitis (5 
[1.4%] subjects; 13 events), encephalitis (2 [0.6%] subjects; 2 events), myocarditis (2 [0.6%] 
subjects; 3 events), and troponin elevation events (36 [10.0%] subjects; 51 events). There were no 
events in the categories of Guillain Barré syndrome, myositis/rhabdomyolysis, myasthenic syndrome, 
demyelination, meningitis, and graft versus host disease. Of the 75 OESIs, 64 OESIs in the nivolumab 
arm were resolved at the time of DBL: 46 troponin events, 11 uveitis events, 2 myocarditis events, 
and 5 pancreatitis events. 
All resolved events of uveitis, myocarditis, and pancreatitis were resolved with IMM; only 1/46 troponin 
event was resolved with IMM. 
Myocarditis and Troponin Elevation 
Myocarditis was reported infrequently at 1.7% and 0.6% in the rela+nivo FDC and nivolumab arms, 
respectively, and a minority were high grade (Grade 3-4) events (0.6% vs 0%, respectively). The 
majority of myocarditis events occurred in the first 2 months. In the rela+nivo FDC arm, all observed 
myocarditis events were manageable within established IMAE management practices and resolved. 
There were no overall differences in the median time to resolution or median duration of 
immunosuppression between the study arms. 
There was 1 fatal event in the nivolumab arm; the cause of death was attributed to a combination of 
myocarditis and bacterial sepsis due to immune suppression for management of myocarditis. This 
subject died despite early observed myocarditis events were associated with other symptoms or signs 
(eg, fatigue, nausea, diffuse body aches, dizziness, dyspnoea, and hepatitis). 
Adverse events of troponin elevation were observed more commonly than myocarditis events, and 
were reported in 41 (11.5%) subjects in the rela+nivo FDC arm and 36 (10.0%) subjects in the 
nivolumab arm, in the context of a protocol requirement for cardiac assessment in subjects with raised 
troponin values. In addition to a subject in the rela+nivo FDC arm who was recorded as treated with 
steroids for both myocarditis and elevated troponin and therefore appears in both OESI categories, 3 
subjects with troponin elevation events were treated with immune-modulating medications: 2 (0.6%) 
subjects vs 1 (0.3%) subject in the rela+nivo FDC and nivolumab arms, respectively. One of these 3 
subjects, treated with corticosteroids in the rela+nivo FDC, had myocardial inflammation on MRI but 
was asymptomatic; the other 2 subjects did not have radiographic confirmation of myocarditis and a 
clinical decision was made to treat with corticosteroids. However, these 3 events represented a 
minority of the troponin elevation events observed within the study, most of which required no 
immunosuppression. 
CNS AEs 
OESIs of the central nervous system, including encephalitis, meningitis, and demyelination events 
were uncommon and balanced between treatment arms. 
CNS AEs were reported infrequently in both treatment arm: 2 subjects each in the rela+nivo FDC and 
nivolumab arms experienced encephalitis OESIs. No subjects in either arm reported meningitis and 
Assessment report  
EMA/720884/2022  
Page 121/147 
 
 
 
demyelination events. Of the encephalitis OESIs reported in the rela+nivo arm, all events were 
manageable with established IMAE management practices and resolved after 6-60 days. One subject in 
the nivolumab arm had a concurrent COVID-19 infection, which was fatal. 
Hypersensitivity/infusion-related reactions 
All hypersensitivity/infusion-related reactions were drug-related and of low frequency, with less than 
2.5% difference in all grade events (6.5% vs 4.2% in the rela+nivo FDC arm vs nivolumab arms, 
respectively). The proportion of hypersensitivity/infusion-related reactions treated with immune-
modulating medication was higher in the nivolumab arm (53.3% vs 34.8%), of which 17.4% in the 
rela+nivo FDC arm vs 6.7% in the nivolumab arm were treated with high dose steroids. The events 
were manageable with no high grade or serious hypersensitivity/infusion-related reactions in the 
rela+nivo FDC arm, compared with 0.3% high grade events and 0.6% serious events in the nivolumab 
arm. The two infusion reaction events that led to discontinuation were in the nivolumab arm with no 
infusion reaction events leading to discontinuation of treatment with rela+nivo FDC. 
2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
The on-treatment haematologic parameters that worsened to Grade 3-4 relative to baseline in ≥ 1% of 
subjects in both treatment arms included decreased haemoglobin (rela+nivo FDC: 2.7%, nivolumab: 
3.5%) and decreased absolute lymphocyte count (rela+nivo FDC: 3.8%, nivolumab: 1.2%). There 
were no Grade 3 or 4 haematologic abnormalities reported in >5% of subjects in both treatment arms. 
Liver Tests 
Increased ALT was reported more frequently with rela+nivo FDC (30.1% Grade 1-4; 2.3% Grade 3-4) 
compared with nivolumab (22.0% Grade 1-4; 1.4% Grade 3-4). 
During the treatment period, abnormalities in hepatic parameters (all increases) were primarily Grade 
1-2). There were no Grade 3 or 4 hepatic abnormalities reported in > 5% of subjects in both treatment 
arms. A total of 2/342 (0.6%) subjects in the rela+nivo FDC arm and 1/345 (0.3%) subject in the 
nivolumab arm had concurrent ALT or AST > 3 > ULN with total bilirubin > 2 > ULN within 1 day and 
within 30 days based on laboratory results reported after the first dose and within 30 days of last dose 
of study therapy, suggestive of a potential drug induced liver injury. 
There were 3 additional subjects in the rela+nivo FDC arm that had concurrent elevation of ALT or AST 
> 3x ULN with total bilirubin > 2x ULN within 100 days after the first dose of study therapy that could 
suggest a potential DILI. Liver toxicity was confounded by progressive disease in 2 subjects and 
Gilbert’s disease in 1 subject. In 1 subject, liver toxicity could have been in the context of concurrently 
elevated creatinine kinase/myositis. 
Thyroid Function Tests 
TSH increases (> ULN) from baseline (> ULN) were reported in 84/354 (23.7%) subjects in the 
rela+nivo FDC arm, and 82/357 (23.0%) subjects in the nivolumab arm. TSH decreases (< LLN) from 
baseline were reported in 79/327 (24.2%) subjects in the rela+nivo FDC arm, and 78/331 (23.6%) 
subjects in the nivolumab arm. 
Electrolytes 
Grade 3-4 hyponatremia and hyperkalemia were reported more frequently with rela+nivo FDC (1.2% 
and 1.8%, respectively) compared with nivolumab (0.6% and 0.9%, respectively). 
Assessment report  
EMA/720884/2022  
Page 122/147 
 
 
 
Most subjects had normal electrolyte levels during the treatment reporting period. Abnormalities in 
electrolytes during treatment were primarily Grade 1 to 2 in severity. No Grade 3 or 4 abnormalities in 
electrolytes were observed in ≥ 5% of treated subjects in both treatment arms. 
Selected Laboratory Abnormalities that Worsened Relative to Baseline in Study CA224047 
In CA224047, laboratory abnormalities that worsened relative to baseline in ≥ 15% of rela+nivo FDC 
treated subjects are presented in Table 36 below.

Vital signs and ECG parameters 
Vital Signs 
In CA224047, on-study safety assessments of vital signs were required at screening and within 3 
calendar days prior to each dose of study treatment. Median baseline vital sign values (blood pressure, 
heart rate, and temperature) were in the normal range, with no clinically meaningful differences 
between the nivo+rela FDC and nivolumab monotherapy arms. No substantial changes in the 
longitudinal vital sign assessments were seen for subjects within the two treatment arms of CA224047, 
and there were no remarkable differences seen between treatment arms across all measured 
parameters. 
Electrocardiograms 
In CA224047, ECG assessments were required at screening and within 3 calendar days prior to each 
dose of study treatment. ECGs were read locally by investigators and results entered into the eCRF by 
the site. Median baseline ECG values (HR, PR Interval, QRS duration, QT interval, and QTcB and/or 
QTcF) were in the normal range, and were comparable between the nivo+rela FDC and nivolumab 
monotherapy arms. No clinically important difference was seen in the median change from baseline for 
any measured ECG parameter in either treatment arm (across treatment cycles including at least 10% 
randomised subjects), and there were no remarkable differences between the treatment arms.

2.6.8.6.  Safety in special populations 
Overall, the safety profile of rela+nivo FDC among subgroups of age, gender, race, and geographic 
region was generally similar to the total rela+nivo FDC treated population. 
Intrinsic and Extrinsic Factors 
The frequencies of all-causality and drug-related AEs in the rela+nivo FDC arm and nivolumab arm for 
subgroups of gender, race, age, and geographic region were generally similar to the AE frequencies 
reported for the overall study populations by treatment. 
Race: Most subjects were clustered in a single category (White), consistent with the geographical 
distribution of study subjects. Very low sample sizes in other categories of race limit the interpretability 
of potential differences (data not shown). 
Age: The overall safety profile of rela+nivo FDC was comparable between subjects ≥ 65 years of age 
and those < 65 years of age. No substantial differences in AEs (all-causality or drug-related; any 
grade) were reported in older subjects (≥ 65 and < 75 and ≥ 75 years) compared with younger 
subjects (< 65 years) treated with rela+nivo FDC, although the small number of subjects above the 
age of 85 limited comparisons (table below). 
Table 37. Summary of on-treatment adverse events by age Ggoup - All randomised subjects treated 
with Nivo+rela FDC (28-Oct-2021 DBL) 
Gender: The overall safety profile of rela+nivo FDC was comparable between males and females. All-
causality AEs of headache, nausea, and UTIs were more common in females, while arthralgia was more 
common in males; this pattern was similar to the differences between genders for the nivolumab arm. 
The frequency of drug-related AEs was similar between males and females for both the rela+nivo FDC 
and nivolumab (data not shown).

Region: The frequencies of overall AEs was generally higher in the US and Australia than Europe or 
Latin America for both the rela+nivo FDC and the nivolumab treatment arms. There were no 
differences in the nature of AEs reported between regions (data not shown).  
Safety in relation to PD-L1- and LAG-3-expression 
There were no consistent differences observed in the frequencies of all-causality or drug-related AEs, 
SAEs, or AEs leading to discontinuation between PD-L1 expression subgroups (1% and 10% cut-offs) 
or LAG-3 expression subgroups (1% cut-off). A safety summary for LAG-3 and PD-L1 subgroups with a 
1% cut-off are provided in Table 38 and Table 39, respectively.

2.6.8.7.  Immunological events 
Incidence of Immunogenicity 
The incidence of relatlimab and nivolumab treatment emergent ADA and NAb were low (< 6%) when 
relatlimab was administered with nivolumab as the FDC or nivolumab was administered alone, and the 
incidence of nivolumab treatment emergent ADA and NAb was similar in both treatment arms (Table 
40). In the rela+nivo FDC arm, there were only 2 subjects that were NAb positive (1 to relatlimab and 
1 to nivolumab), and in the nivolumab arm, there was only 1 subject that was NAb positive. In the 
rela+nivo FDC arm, no subjects were PP positive to relatlimab and 2 subjects were PP positive to 
nivolumab. In the nivolumab arm, 2 subjects were PP positive.

Table 40. ADA assessments summary - All treated subjects with baseline and at least one post-
baseline assessment in study CA224047 
Effect of Immunogenicity on Safety 
The occurrence of either relatlimab or nivolumab ADA did not have an effect on safety of the regimens. 
None of the relatlimab ADA positive subjects had hypersensitivity/infusion reactions. There were only 1 
and 2 subjects with hypersensitivity/ infusion reactions who were nivolumab ADA positive in the 
rela+nivo FDC and nivolumab arms, respectively. Most of the hypersensitivity/infusion reactions 
occurred after the first dose, were transient, and independent of ADA status. 
2.6.8.8.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Drug Interactions 
Since mAb are not direct inhibitors/inducers of metabolizing enzymes and are eliminated by metabolic 
pathways (ie, degradation by catabolism/proteolysis [mainly by enzymes in the cells of 
reticuloendothelial system], Fc gamma receptor-mediated clearance, target-mediated clearance, 
nonspecific endocytosis, and formation of immune-complexes followed by complement- or Fc receptor-
mediated clearance mechanism) that are different from small molecules, direct drug-drug interactions 
(DDIs) between mAb and small molecules are unlikely. Therefore, no formal PK DDI studies have been 
conducted with rela+nivo FDC. However, therapeutic proteins that are modulators of cytokines may 
indirectly affect the expression of cytochrome P450 enzyme. Levels of cytokines quantified in 
CA224020 and CA224047 including IL6, IL10 IL1β, IL12p70 and TNFα are near or below the assay 
lower limit of quantification in rela+nivo treated patients. Rela+nivo treatment resulted in increases in 
IFNγ and IFNγ-induced chemokines; however, clinically meaningful effects of IFNγ and IFNγ-induced 
chemokines on the expression or stability of CYP enzymes have not been reported. Overall, rela+nivo 
FDC is considered to have a low potential to affect the PK of other drugs eliminated by CYP450 
enzymes, based on the lack of any clinically relevant effect on cytokines in the peripheral circulation. 
Relatlimab and nivolumab are IgG4 monoclonal antibodies, which are likely to be eliminated via several 
pathways similar to that of other antibodies, ie degradation by catabolism/proteolysis (mainly by 
enzymes in the cells of reticuloendothelial system), Fc gamma receptor-mediated clearance, target-

mediated clearance, nonspecific endocytosis, and formation of immune-complexes followed by 
complement- or Fc receptor-mediated clearance mechanism. These enzymes or pathways are not 
known to be inhibited or induced by drugs; therefore, it is unlikely that other drugs will have an impact 
on the PK of relatlimab and nivolumab. Food-drug interactions are not applicable as rela+nivo FDC is 
administered as an IV infusion. 
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
There are no available data on rela+nivo FDC use in pregnant women to evaluate a drug-associated 
risk. There was one reported case of inadvertently exposure to rela+nivo FDC during pregnancy that 
resulted in spontaneous abortion, which was considered related to rela+nivo FDC by the investigator. 
Human IgG4 is known to cross the placenta; and rela+nivo FDC therapy has the potential to be 
transmitted from the mother to the developing fetus. Therefore, rela+nivo FDC should not be used 
during pregnancy. If a patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, they should be advised of the 
potential risk to the fetus. It is unknown whether relatlimab and/or nivolumab are secreted in human 
milk. Because antibodies can be secreted in human milk, a risk to the newborns/infants cannot be 
excluded. Therefore, a decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue 
from rela+nivo FDC therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the 
benefit of therapy for the woman.  
Overdose 
Higher doses of relatlimab up to 1440 mg in combination with nivolumab have been studied and were 
well-tolerated by patients without increased toxicity. Therefore, the observed physiological effect is 
minimal. However, in case of over dosage, the patient should be closely monitored for immune-
adverse reactions and treated appropriately. There is no known antidote for relatlimab and/or 
nivolumab overdose. 
Drug Abuse 
There is no evidence that suggest a risk for a potential drug abuse for rela+nivo FDC as the 
combination drug is dispensed by pharmacies and administered in medical settings. 
Effects on Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery or Impairment of Mental Ability 
Relatlimab and/or nivolumab may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines due 
to fatigue, which is a very common side effect of rela+nivo FDC. 
2.6.8.9.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
A total of 39.4% of subjects in the rela+nivo FDC arm and 36.2% of subjects in the nivolumab 
monotherapy arm had at least 1 dose delayed, mainly due to an AE (no specific ones), but dose delays 
accounted for only approximately 6-7% of all doses received by subjects. Most dose delays lasted ≤ 42 
days. Very few dose delays were due to COVID-19 (27 total in the rela+nivo FDC 3 arm and 34 total in 
the nivolumab monotherapy arm). 
The majority of “other” reasons for IV rate reduction were more specifically due to previous infusion 
reaction, infusion reaction prophylaxis, and infusion reaction. Infusion interruption occurred in a low 
percentage of subjects and was similar between the two treatment arms (6.2% and 5.6% in the 
rela+nivo FDC and nivolumab arms, respectively). The most common cause of infusion interruption 
was hypersensitivity reaction (73.3% and 62.5% in the rela+nivo FDC and nivolumab arms, 
respectively). 
Assessment report  
EMA/720884/2022

The overall frequencies of AEs leading to discontinuation (all-causality and drug-related) were higher in 
the rela+nivo FDC arm (19.4%) compared with the nivolumab arm (11.4%). Drug-related any grade 
AEs leading to discontinuation were 14.6% and 7.8%, and grade 3-4 8.5% and 3.1%, respectively. 
2.6.8.10.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data were provided. 
SUPPORTIVE SAFETY - CA224020 
An overview of extent of exposure in all treated subjects with rela+nivo 160/480 mg Q4W (N = 412, 
FDC or non-FDC) is provided in Table 41. 
Table 41. Dose information summary - All treated subjects with relatlimab + nivolumab 160/480 mg 
Q4W in study CA224020 
Median duration of therapy was 16 weeks for single agent vials and 19.8 weeks for rela+nivo FDC. 
Drug-related SAEs grade 3-4 varied between 4.9% and 15.8%. Drug-related AEs leading to 
discontinuation varied between 4.9% and 10.5%. The most frequently reported any-grade drug-

related select AE categories were skin (31.6%), endocrine (23.7%), gastrointestinal (7.9%), and 
hypersensitivity/infusion reaction (5.3%). 
OESIs were infrequently reported (5 subjects reported 6 OESIs). The OESIs reported were uveitis, 
meningitis, myositis/rhabdomyolysis, and myocarditis (1 subject [1 event] each), and Guillain-Barre 
syndrome (1 subject [2 events]). Of the 5 OESIs, 1 event was resolved with IMM and 4 events were 
continuing at the time of DBL. 
Of all subjects treated with rela+nivo 160/480 mg Q4W who were evaluable for ADA, 
hypersensitivity/infusion reaction select AEs were experienced by 1/13 (7.7%) relatlimab ADA-positive 
subject, 11/316 (3.5%) relatlimab ADA-negative subjects, and 12/323 (3.7%) nivolumab ADA-
negative subjects; none of the nivolumab ADA-positive subjects experienced hypersensitivity/infusion 
reaction. 
Overall, hypersensitivity/infusion reactions occurred in 11 (2.7%) subjects in the pooled group of 
subjects who received at least one dose of rela+nivo 160/480 mg Q4W (N = 412), and in 8 (5.7%) 
subjects who received at least one dose of rela+nivo 480/480 mg Q4W (N = 140) in Study CA224020.  
Hypersensitivity/infusion reaction events were manageable. Due to Grade 3-4 AEs 2 subjects treated 
with rela+nivo 160/480 mg Q4W and none of the subjects treated with rela+nivo 480/480 mg Q4W 
with hypersensitivity/infusion reactions were treated with immune modulating medication. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The main safety data for relatlimab+nivolumab (rela+nivo) FDC (160 mg + 480 mg Q4W) is based on 
the pivotal study CA224047. Safety data from study CA224020 was also included, but there was no 
pooling of safety data from these studies due to a difference of study designs, e.g. high percentage of 
IO-pre-treated patients and various tumour types. The safety profile of 412 patients that were 
comparable to the pivotal patients was supportive for the safety data of the pivotal study. 
The pivotal Study CA224047 is a Phase 2/3, randomised, double-blind study of rela+nivo FDC (n=355) 
versus nivolumab (nivo) monotherapy (N = 359) in subjects with unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma. Safety data is based on a 09-Mar-2021 DBL. 
Based on the MOA of relatlimab and nivolumab, the key expected drug toxicities were related to 
immune activation; therefore, particular attention was paid to detecting and reporting select AEs, 
IMAEs, and OESIs. 
Exposure 
The study population included 18% of subjects ≥ 75 years of age, including almost 2% who were 
above the age of 85 years and no patients < 18 years of age. The median follow-up time was 13.2 
months. The median duration of therapy was comparable for both treatment arms, being 5.5 months 
for rela+nivo FDC and 4.8 months for nivo monotherapy, as was relative dose intensity 90-110% in 
87% and 85%, respectively. Most patients received >90% intensity in both treatment arms, which is 
indicative of manageable adverse events. However, median duration of treatment is 5 months with a 
median follow-up time of 13 months, which is short to conclude on long-term safety. The applicant 
provided updated data with 28-Oct-2021 DBL (with a median follow-up of 19.27 months) (data not 
shown). The median treatment duration was 8.31 months for nivo+rela FDC treated subjects and 6.47 
months for nivolumab monotherapy treated subjects, and nearly 40% subjects have been treated ≥ 12 
months. This follow-up data was consistent with the previously provided data and is considered of 
sufficient duration to have an adequate understanding of safety.  
Assessment report  
EMA/720884/2022

Patients included in the study may have received prior adjuvant or neo-adjuvant therapy if, at least, it 
had happened 6 months (6 weeks for interferon) before recurrence. In Study CA224047, 31 (8.7%) 
and 26 (7.2%) subjects had received prior adjuvant therapy in the combination and monotherapy arm, 
respectively; and 2 (0.6%) and 1 (0.3%) patients, respectively, had received prior therapy in the neo-
adjuvant setting. As per inclusion criteria these subjects were allowed to enter the study if all related 
AEs have either returned to baseline or stabilised. There were no predefined objective criteria to 
consider non-resolved AEs from adjuvant therapy as stabilised and this was up to the investigator. The 
percentage of patients receiving prior systemic therapy has been added to section 5.1 SmPC. 
Adverse events (AEs) 
Almost all patients experienced all-causality AEs, any grade at 97% and 94%, and grade 3-4 at 40% 
and 33%, for rela+nivo FDC and nivo monotherapy, respectively. Regarding drug-related AEs, the 
reported incidence of any grade AEs was 81.1% in the rela+nivo FDC arm and 69.9% in the nivo arm, 
while grade 3-4 drug-related AEs were reported by 18.9% and 9.7% of subjects, respectively. 
The most frequently (>15%) reported any grade AEs were fatigue (29% vs 20%), pruritus (25% vs 
17%), arthralgia (24% vs 15%), diarrhoea (23% vs 17%), headache (18% vs 12%), nausea (17% vs 
15%), rash (17% vs 13%) and hypothyroidism (15% vs 12%).  
The most frequently reported drug-related AEs (rela+nivo FDC vs nivo monotherapy; ≥ 10% of 
rela+nivo FDC subjects) were pruritus (23.4% vs 15.9%), fatigue (23.1% vs 12.8%), rash (15.5% vs 
12.0%), arthralgia (14.4% vs 7.2%), hypothyroidism (14.4% vs 12.0%), diarrhoea (13.5% vs 9.2%), 
and vitiligo (10.4% vs 9.7%); these AEs were predominantly of low grade.  
The most frequently reported Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs (rela+nivo FDC vs nivo monotherapy; ≥ 1% 
of rela+nivo FDC subjects) were increased lipase (1.7% vs 0.8%), increased ALT (1.4% vs 0.6%), 
increased AST (1.4% vs 0.3%), and fatigue (1.1% vs 0.3%). 
In general, rela+nivo showed more toxicity than nivo monotherapy, as was to be expected since two 
drugs can cause more adverse events than just one. Therefore, the numerical incidence of grade 3-4 
drug-related SAEs is higher in the rela+nivo FDC patients (9.3%) versus nivo monotherapy (4.7%). 
Although the overall frequencies of all causality and drug-related AEs were higher in the rela+nivo FDC 
arm, the majority were of low grade (Grades 1-2), and the safety profile of rela+nivo FDC was 
manageable using well established AE management guidelines. 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) and deaths 
As of the 09-Mar-2021 DBL, 30.4% subjects in the rela+nivo FDC arm and 33.1% of subjects in the 
nivo monotherapy arm died during the study. Disease progression was the most common cause of 
death in both arms. A similar proportion of subjects in the rela+nivo FDC (0.8%; 3 subjects) and nivo 
monotherapy (0.6%; 2 subjects) arms died due to study drug toxicity during the study. This was 
caused by haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, acute oedema of the lung and pneumonitis in the 
rela+nivo FDC group and in the nivo monotherapy group sepsis+myocarditis and worsening 
pneumonia. The numbers are too low to reveal any trend or indication for a systematic causal 
relationship on the contribution of relatlimab. 
Although a higher numerical percentage of patients in the rela+nivo FDC group (34%) than in the nivo 
monotherapy group (29%) suffered from any grade SAEs, no individual SAE was reported with a 
frequency > 2% except malignant neoplasm progression in either arm. The majority of SAEs in both 
groups were considered not drug-related by the investigator, which is an acceptable explanation with 
respect to the wide variety and type of SAEs.  
Drug-related SAE of myocarditis was infrequent in both treatment arms (1.1% rela+nivo FDC and 
0.3% nivolumab monotherapy), as were high grade myocarditis SAEs (0.6% in the rela+nivo FDC arm 
Assessment report  
EMA/720884/2022  
Page 130/147 
 
 
 
vs 0% in the nivolumab monotherapy arm). There seems to be no specific relationship between drug-
related SAEs and one of the treatment arms. 
Deaths attributed to other reasons were reported in 14 (3.9%) subjects in the rela+nivo FDC arm and 
16 (4.5%) subjects in the nivolumab monotherapy arm, which is balanced between study arms. The 
verbatim terms might be consistent with events expected in this study population and none were 
considered related to the study drugs. This might be acceptable as explanation for the variety of 
causes of death. However, 6 patients of all randomised patients died of ischemic cardiac failure and 2 
patients died of a cerebrovascular event. From the details of the cardiovascular death cases it is 
understood that most patients had a pre-existing risk factor for cardiovascular disease and that it is 
unlikely that the death was attributable to the study drug. This seems acceptable. 
Other Serious Adverse Events 
Of SAEs attributed to study drug by the investigator, there were 4 reported events that are considered 
rare for immuno-oncology agents in the rela+nivo FDC arm affecting individual subjects (haemolytic 
anaemia, Guillain-Barré syndrome, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease and haemophagocytic 
lymphohistiocytosis), and 1 event in the nivo monotherapy arm (acquired haemophilia). 
The most frequently reported (≥ 1% of patients) any-grade drug-related SAEs were: 
- Rela+nivo FDC: colitis, diarrhoea, and myocarditis (1.1% each); 
- Nivolumab: None; all drug-related SAEs by PT occurred in < 1% of subjects. 
No individual SAE was reported with a frequency > 2% except malignant neoplasm progression in 
either arm. The majority of SAEs in both groups were considered not drug-related by the investigator. 
Drug-related SAE of myocarditis was infrequent in both treatment arms (1.1% rela+nivo FDC and 
0.3% nivolumab), as were high grade myocarditis SAEs (0.6% in the rela+nivo FDC arm vs 0% in the 
nivolumab arm). There seems to be no specific relationship between overall SAEs and one of the 
treatment arms. 
The applicant has outlined some SAEs that were considered rare for immuno-oncology agents: 
haemolytic anaemia, Guillain-Barré syndrome, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease and haemophagocytic 
lymphohistiocytosis (with concomitant hypohysitis) in the rela+nivo arm and a case of acquired 
haemophilia in the nivo arm. Except for haemolytic anaemia and acquired haemophilia, the rest of 
them have been already identified as nivolumab ADRs and are included in the PI of Opdivo. Haemolytic 
anaemia was resolved after long treatment with corticosteroids and resolution of concomitant infective 
arthritis according to the submitted patient narrative.  
Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation of Study Therapy 
The overall frequencies of AEs leading to discontinuation (all-causality and drug-related) were higher in 
the rela+nivo FDC arm (19%) compared with the nivo monotherapy arm (11%) as was the case for 
Grade 3-4 events in both treatment arms (11.5% vs 6.4%). 
The most frequently reported any grade AEs leading to discontinuation (≥ 1% of patients) were: 
- Rela+nivo FDC: pneumonitis, malignant neoplasm progression, and myocarditis (1.4% each); 
- Nivolumab monotherapy: malignant neoplasm progression (2.5%). 
The most frequently reported any grade drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation (≥ 1% of subjects) 
were: 
- Rela+nivo FDC (14.6%): pneumonitis and myocarditis (1.4% each); 
- Nivolumab (6.7%): None; all events by PT occurred in < 1% of subjects. 
Recommended treatment modifications are properly addressed in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/720884/2022  
Page 131/147 
 
 
 
 
The proportion of AEs leading to discontinuation represented by Grade 3-4 events in both treatment 
arms were 11.5% and 6.4%, respectively, as well as for Drug-Related Adverse Events Leading to 
Discontinuation (14.6% vs 6.7%). There is a non-negligible difference of about 8% in drug-related 
discontinuation of treatment.   
Select Adverse Events 
Across the select AE categories, the majority of events in the rela+nivo FDC and nivolumab 
monotherapy arm were manageable using the established algorithms, with resolution occurring for the 
majority of non-endocrine AEs (ranging from 42.7% - 100% across categories) when immune-
modulating medications (mainly systemic corticosteroids) were administered. Although there is a 
higher incidence of select AEs in the rela+nivo patients, this difference is acceptable from a clinical 
point of view. 
Immune-mediated Adverse Events (IMAEs) 
The most frequently reported IMAEs (any grade; ≥ 5% of subjects) were as follows in each treatment 
arm: 
- Rela+nivo FDC: hypothyroidism (16.6%), rash (9.3%), diarrhoea/colitis (6.8%), hyperthyroidism 
(6.2%), and hepatitis (5.6%); 
- Nivolumab monotherapy: hypothyroidism (13.1%), hyperthyroidism (6.7%), and rash (6.7%). 
Incidence and duration of IMMs in subjects who experienced IMAEs did not appear to be consistently 
different between treatment arms. The percentage of subjects with an IMAE leading to dose 
discontinuation was comparable between both treatment arms. 
IMAEs and implications are well described in section 4.4 of SmPC, as are the class effects. 
Other Events of Special Interest (OESIs) 
Events defined as OESIs for rela+nivo included the following categories: myasthenic syndrome, 
demyelination, Guillain-Barré syndrome, pancreatitis, uveitis, encephalitis, myositis/rhabdomyolysis, 
myocarditis, GVHD, meningitis and troponin increase. 
Specific attention was paid to: 
-  Myocarditis. Early, lethal myocarditis in LAG-3/PD-1 double knockout mouse models was observed, 
together with emerging literature describing a low risk of severe checkpoint inhibitor-associated 
myocarditis in the post approval setting. Monitoring of troponin has been implemented adequately 
in the study protocol  
-  CNS vasculitis and mild inflammation of the choroid plexus and brain vasculature were observed 
during pre-clinical general toxicity testing in cynomolgus monkeys. There are no routine laboratory 
or imaging evaluations that would enhance safety monitoring for CNS events within these clinical 
studies beyond clinical observation and awareness of the treating physician, which is acceptable. 
-  Hypersensitivity/infusion reactions: Because both relatlimab and nivolumab contain only human 
immunoglobulin protein sequences, they have a low risk of inducing immunogenicity or associated 
infusion or hypersensitivity reactions. Given a theoretical risk of infusion reactions with the new 
FDC formulation, a safety lead-in was employed in Study CA224047 for the first 18 subjects 
randomised to monitor for Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions; no risks were identified in the safety 
lead-in study. 
Overall, OESIs were reported in 17.5% of patients in the rela+nivo FDC arm and 13.6% in the 
nivolumab arm. In the rela+nivo FDC arm 76 of the 83 OESIs, were resolved at the time of DBL: 45 
troponin events, 9 myocarditis events, 8 uveitis events, 3 encephalitis events, 3 myositis events, 3 
pancreatitis events, and 1 Guillain Barré Syndrome. All resolved events of myocarditis, uveitis, 
Assessment report  
EMA/720884/2022  
Page 132/147 
 
 
 
encephalitis, myositis, pancreatitis, and Guillain Barré Syndrome were resolved with IMM; only 3/45 
troponin events were resolved with IMM. 
In the nivolumab monotherapy arm 64 of the 75 OESIs were resolved at the time of DBL: 46 troponin 
events, 11 uveitis events, 2 myocarditis events, and 5 pancreatitis events. All resolved events of 
uveitis, myocarditis, and pancreatitis were resolved with IMM; only 1/46 troponin event was resolved 
with IMM. 
Myocarditis was reported infrequently at 1.7% and 0.6% in the rela+nivo FDC and nivolumab arms, 
respectively, and a minority were high grade (Grade 3-4) events (0.6% vs 0%, respectively). The 
majority of myocarditis events occurred in the first 2 months. In the rela+nivo FDC arm, all observed 
myocarditis events were manageable within established IMAE management practices and resolved. 
There was 1 fatal event in the nivolumab arm due to a combination of myocarditis and bacterial sepsis 
due to immune suppression for management of myocarditis. There were no overall differences in the 
median time to resolution or median duration of immunosuppression between the study arms. 
Troponin elevation was reported in 41 (11.5%) subjects in the rela+nivo FDC arm and 36 (10.0%) 
subjects in the nivo monotherapy arm, in the context of a protocol requirement for cardiac assessment 
in subjects with raised troponin values. 3 subjects with troponin elevation events were treated with 
immune-modulating medications: 2 (0.6%) subjects vs 1 (0.3%) subject in the rela+nivo FDC and 
nivo monotherapy arms, respectively. One of these 3 subjects, treated with corticosteroids in the 
rela+nivo FDC, had myocardial inflammation on MRI but was asymptomatic; the other 2 subjects did 
not have radiographic confirmation of myocarditis and a clinical decision was made to treat with 
corticosteroids. However, these 3 events represented a minority of the troponin elevation events 
observed within the study, most of which required no immunosuppression. Overall, the rate, duration, 
or grade of troponin elevation events were similar between the study arms. Troponin elevation does 
not seem to be of clinical importance. However, troponin elevation might be indicative for myocardial 
damage and since there is no difference between both treatment groups it might be related to ‘any’ 
immunotherapy. According to the applicant, study CA224047 is the first randomised, double-blind 
immuno-oncology (IO) trial to incorporate prospective troponin monitoring as a tool to determine if 
increased surveillance could support identification of myocarditis and to permit characterisation of the 
risk of myocarditis with nivo+rela FDC compared to an established immune check-point inhibitor (ICI), 
nivolumab. Data from cohort studies recently published in literature indicate that the clinical relevance 
and aetiology of troponin elevations for patients receiving checkpoint inhibitors are currently ill-defined 
and multi-factorial. Overall, as only very few patients with an isolated troponin evaluation in the 
CA224047 study might have suffered from myocarditis with clinical symptoms, it might be concluded, 
that troponin elevation is not a reliable predictive value for myocarditis and should only be used as 
diagnostic in case of clinical suspicion of myocardial damage. The current information in the SmPC and 
package leaflet is considered sufficient to take care of patient and prescriber awareness of cardiac 
toxicity. 
In this respect, as the key immune-mediated cardiac toxicity for checkpoint inhibitors including 
nivo+rela FDC, and due to the need for early identification and appropriate clinical management of this 
event, myocarditis has been included in the proposed SmPC within Sections 4.8 and Section 4.4 
(Special Warnings and Precautions) to support patient safety. These measures are considered 
adequate. 
CNS AEs were reported infrequently in both treatment arms: 2 subjects each in the rela+nivo FDC and 
nivo monotherapy arms experienced encephalitis OESIs. Of the encephalitis OESIs reported in the 
rela+nivo arm, all events were manageable with established IMAE management practices and resolved 
(in the 2 cases in the nivo monotherapy arm it did not resolve). Overall, there is no clinical important 
difference in incidence and outcome of OESIs between both treatment arms. Encephalitis is listed in 
Assessment report  
EMA/720884/2022  
Page 133/147 
 
 
 
 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC, Special warnings and Precautions for use, along with other rarely reported 
immune-related adverse reactions, and with adequate treatment guidelines. ‘Encephalitis’ was 
positioned within Table 2 under the ‘Nervous system disorders’ instead of the ‘Infections and 
infestations’ heading, in accordance with the non-infectious aetiology of this type of encephalitis. 
With respect to OESIs it was noted, that in nivo+rela FDC 76 out of 83 OESIs and in the nivo group 64 
out of 75 were resolved. To address the question “which OESIs were not resolved”, an analysis was 
performed to evaluate the proportion of subjects experiencing each OESI in whom the event resolved 
within 100 days of last dose, based on the updated safety information from the DBL of 28-Oct-2021. 
Overall, the proportion of subjects with ongoing OESIs was similar between the nivo+rela FDC and 
nivolumab arms. Although there were some differences between treatment arms in the proportion with 
resolved events for individual OESI categories, these differences are likely attributable to small 
numbers of impacted subjects and there was no consistent trend. 
SUPPORTIVE SAFETY data of study CA224020 
Study CA224020 is an ongoing Phase 1/2 trial evaluating safety, tolerability, and efficacy of multiple 
dosing regimens of relatlimab monotherapy and relatlimab in combination with nivolumab in subjects 
with selected advanced or recurrent malignancies, including melanoma: 
n=412 for rela+nivo 160/480 mg Q4W, median duration of therapy varies from 16-19.8 weeks; 
median follow-up varies from 9.4-13.4 months; 
n=743 for rela+nivo 80/240 mg Q2W, median duration of therapy 16 weeks; median follow-up varies 
from 12-30.3 months. 
Data on safety and immunogenicity of study CA224020 for all subjects who received at least one dose 
of rela+nivo 160/480 mg Q4W (the proposed dosing regimen, N = 412) was generally consistent with 
the safety findings from study CA224047. Since there is no control group in the CA224020 study no 
comparison can be made between single and combined therapy. No additional safety signals were 
noticed. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
There were no Grade 3 or 4 haematologic abnormalities reported in >5% of subjects in both treatment 
arms. 
Liver tests, creatinine and electrolytes 
Only a very small percentage of patients had concurrent ALT or AST > 3 ULN with total bilirubin > 2 
ULN. Since there were only 3 patients involved, and 2 of them had contributing factors to elevated liver 
enzymes, no conclusions can be drawn on this reversible high grade hepatic toxicity. Moreover, the 
incidence of drug-induced high grade hepatic toxicity is very low. 
There were no Grade 4 increased creatinine levels in either arm. No Grade 3 or 4 abnormalities in 
electrolytes were observed in > 5% of treated subjects in both treatment arms. 
Thyroid Function Tests 
TSH increases (>ULN) and decreases (<LLN) were equally distributed between both study arms, 23% 
and 24%, respectively. 
Overall, incidence of grade 3-4 laboratory toxicity was low and no unexpected signals were noticed. 
Assessment report

Vital signs 
No remarkable differences were noted between treatment arms across all measured parameters.  
Safety by Biomarkers (LAG-3 and PD-L1 Expression) 
There were no consistent differences observed in the frequencies of all-causality or drug-related AEs, 
SAEs, or AEs leading to discontinuation between PD-L1 expression subgroups (1% and 10% cut-offs) 
or LAG-3 expression subgroups (1% cut-off). 
SAFETY IN SPECIAL GROUPS AND SITUATIONS - CA224047 
Overall, the safety profile of rela+nivo FDC among subgroups of age, gender, race, and geographic 
region was generally similar to the total rela+nivo FDC treated population. 
PREGNANCY - CA224047 
One patient who received two doses of rela+nivo FDC on Study Day 1 and Day 30 had a positive 
pregnancy test at day 54 and most probably had an early spontaneous abortion. There is no other data 
on pregnancy, which is addressed in SmPC 4.6. 
Immunogenicity 
Like in other PD-(L)1 inhibitor trials and prior nivolumab-trials ADAs were found in a relatively low and 
stable percentage of patients. ADA positivity was found for relatlimab (5.6%, n=286) and nivo 
monotherapy (3.8%, n=288) in the FDC group and nivolumab (5.9%, n=272) in the nivo monotherapy 
group. Almost none were persistently positive and Nab was only found in 0.3%. No new safety signal 
due to ADA for nivolumab was noted and no detrimental ADA-related safety effect for relatlimab. 
Proposed 30-minute infusion rate  
The applicant proposes a 30-minute infusion rate within the SmPC, whereas a 60 minute infusion rate 
was used in the pivotal study. This is acceptable as a clinically relevant increase of immunogenicity and 
adverse events is considered unlikely given the limited differences in exposure based on popPK 
simulations. In addition, both nivolumab and relatlimab have a low immunogenic potential and a 
limited number of patients experienced hypersensitivity/infusion-related reactions (11/412 pooled 
data) at the recommended dose. There were no apparent associations between dose (maximum rela 
SAV + nivo dose up to 1440/480 mg Q4W) and infusion or hypersensitivity reactions in study 
CA224020. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
Safety extrapolation from adults to adolescents  
There is a need for new therapeutic modalities for advanced melanoma given the limited options and 
poor outcomes in adolescent patients. Currently only ipilimumab is approved for the treatment of 
advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adolescents. Although survival benefit for 
ipilimumab in adults is established, the toxicity of this drug is considerable, by which the medical need 
for adolescent advanced melanoma patients is considered not fulfilled. The applied indication for the 
FDC of relatlimab and nivolumab includes both adults and adolescents aged 12 to <18 years old, 
however no patients below the age of 18 years were included in the clinical studies. Given the low 
incidence of advanced melanoma in the paediatric population it is difficult to enroll adolescents in 
clinical studies in this setting. Therefore, the indication for adolescents is based on extrapolation from 
adult data. 
Assessment report  
EMA/720884/2022  
Page 135/147 
 
 
 
Prognosis for adolescent patients is poor, and advanced melanoma is rare in adolescents, by which the 
number of patients that could be available to participate in a (paediatric) clinical study is too limited for 
generation of robust efficacy and safety data needed for benefit/risk assessment, therefore the 
proposed approach by the applicant to support the adolescent indication by extrapolation from adult 
data is agreed.   
Regarding young adults, in Study CA224047, 11 subjects treated with rela+nivo FDC were 18 to ≤ 30 
years of age. In Study CA224020, of the 412 treated subjects receiving the same study drug dose and 
schedule (relatlimab 160 mg + nivolumab 480 mg Q4W), 8 subjects treated with relatlimab + 
nivolumab were 18 to ≤ 30 years of age. No substantial differences in incidence of AEs including grade 
3-4 AEs, SAEs IMAEs, were reported for young adults or the ITT population.  
To facilitate the extrapolation approach, clinical data in subjects with advanced melanoma receiving 
relatlimab 160 mg + nivolumab 480 mg Q4W (SAV and FDC formulations) in Studies CA224047 and 
CA224020 were analysed by body weight (data not shown). There were 6 subjects with low body 
weight (< 50 kg) in Study CA224047 and 10 subjects with low body weight (< 50 kg) in Study 
CA224020. The safety profile of the combination of relatlimab and nivolumab in subjects with advanced 
melanoma with low body weight (< 50 kg) was generally similar to the safety profile in subjects with a 
body weight ≥ 50 kg, and no consistent trend was seen for higher frequency or severity of AEs with 
decreasing body weight. The cut-off of 50 kg was used because the analysis using a 40 kg cut-off 
would not be feasible due to negligible numbers enrolled in the studies. The number of subjects < 40 
kg at baseline enrolled in CA224047 and CA224020 are 0 and 1, respectively. 
For the only product that is currently approved for the treatment of adolescents with advanced 
melanoma, ipilimumab, only limited safety data for adolescents treated were available at the time of 
approval. No new safety concerns and no new adverse drug reactions for ipilimumab were reported in 
adolescents 12 years of age and older during this procedure (EMEA/H/C/002213/II/0044). However, 
the CHMP concluded that ipilimumab seemed to be less well tolerated in adolescents compared to 
adults as a numeric high number of SAEs and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation, were reported. 
To further characterize the safety profile in children and mitigate the uncertainties surrounding a 
negative effect of ipilimumab on endocrine-related ADRs which may affect hormonal and sexual 
development in adolescents, the CHMP requested to collect post-marketing paediatric safety data, 
through joining the existing Dutch Melanoma Treatment Registry (DMTR) as additional 
pharmacovigilance activities. Similarly, to obtain more adolescent data for the relat+nivo FDC the 
study CA224122 will be initiated. This is a voluntary post-authorisation safety study and pertains to a 
long-term follow-up of paediatric patients exposed to relatlimab + nivolumab fixed dose combination 
(FDC) in the DMTR (see RMP).   
Considering the lack of safety data of nivolumab and relatlimab monotherapy and for nivolumab in 
combination with relatlimab in adolescents, the applicant submitted further safety data from two 
studies (CA209070 and CA209908, data not shown), which included children who were treated with 
nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab. In general, the short-term 
safety profile of nivolumab for children appears to be comparable to the known safety profile of 
nivolumab in adults. As both nivolumab and relatlimab are checkpoint inhibitors, also for relatlimab the 
toxicity profile is expected to be comparable in adolescents and adults, as comparable exposure has 
been established.  
Selected AEs and IMAEs, including those that were severe appeared to be manageable and the 
majority of drug related select AEs and IMAEs resolved. An exception is endocrine select AEs and 
endocrine IMAEs, that were managed by hormone replacement therapy.  
Hardly any long-term toxicity data for any immune checkpoint inhibitor is available for adolescents. 
Considering the endocrine AEs that are managed with hormone replacement therapy and the unknown 
Assessment report

Page 136/147 
 
 
 
impact of these AEs on growth and development, the lack of information on long term toxicity is a 
concern. On the other hand, it is acknowledged that the prognosis of adolescents with metastatic or 
unresectable (advanced) melanoma is poor and have a high unmet medical need. The long-term safety 
for checkpoints in adolescents will be further studied, specifically for the nivolumab+ relatlimab 
combination therapy, additional safety data will become available from children with haematological 
malignancies treated with this combination. Moreover, adolescent melanoma patients treated with 
nivolumab+relatlimab will be included in the DMTR study, which may also provide long term safety 
follow up data. Critical attention should be given to several potential long-term toxicities associated to 
treatment with check point inhibitors (like autoimmune endocrine, hepatic and renal toxicity) in the 
adolescent population. These aspects are reflected in the RMP. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
In general, no new safety signals were found from the phase 3 study comparing rela+nivo FDC with 
nivo monotherapy for first-line treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adults 
and adolescents. As was to be expected, adverse events were observed in a higher incidence in the 
(combined treatment) study arm, although there was only a small difference in grade 3-4 toxicity. The 
most common serious adverse reactions are colitis, diarrhoea, back pain, myocarditis, and adrenal 
insufficiency, though in low frequency. An extended follow-up at median 19.3 months showed 
consistent results with the primary analysis (data not shown). 
Drug-related adverse events lead to discontinuation of treatment in almost 15% of patients in the 
rela+nivo FDC group versus almost 7% in the nivo group. Nevertheless, drug-related AEs were 
generally manageable with treatment guidelines and are adequately addressed in SmPC 4.2. 
The issue of troponin elevation and myocarditis that has been raised in non-clinical studies does not 
seem to play a clinically important role. While there is a quite high incidence of troponin elevation in 
both study arms of around 10%, it is noticed that troponin elevation is not a reliable predictive value 
for myocarditis. There is not enough knowledge about the causal mechanism of troponin elevation, and 
it is not justified yet neither to screen for troponin elevation during treatment nor to make a specific 
guideline for the situation of isolated elevated troponin. Instead, elevated troponin should only be used 
as a diagnostic marker in case of clinical suspicion of myocardial damage. SmPC sections 4.2, 4.4 and 
4.8 provide adequate information on immune-related myocarditis.  
No adolescents have been included in the pivotal phase 3 study. In general, the safety profile of 
nivolumab in adolescents seems to be comparable to the known safety profile of nivolumab in adults. 
As both nivolumab and relatlimab are check point inhibitors, also for relatlimab comparable toxicity for 
adults and adolescents can be expected as comparable exposure has been established. No long-term 
safety data for adolescents treated with checkpoint inhibitors is however available. The long-term 
safety of nivolumab+relatlimab in adolescents will be followed post-approval (cat 3 study in the RMP).  
In conclusion, there are no new clinically relevant safety issues.

2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Opdualag (relatlimab / nivolumab) is 
included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 
2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Opdualag is indicated for the first line treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma 
in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older with tumour cell PD-L1 expression < 1%.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Melanoma is a heterogeneous and complex disease with various clinical factors and molecular defects 
playing a key role in outcomes. Cutaneous melanoma is by far the most common melanoma subtype 
and approximately 50% of cutaneous melanomas bear an oncogenic driver mutation in the BRAF gene 
which is associated with a worse prognosis. Clinical factors associated with poor survival include 
elevated LDH, visceral metastases (notably liver and brain), multiple metastatic sites, and poor 
performance status.  
The target population is confined to unresectable stage III (regional metastatic) and stage IV (distinct 
metastatic) melanoma. The five-year survival is about (10%-)20% when distant metastases are 
present. The main aim of treatment in this setting is to prolong progression-free survival and improve 
overall survival. The current first-line standard of care treatments for unresectable stage III/IV are PD-
1 blockade (nivolumab, pembrolizumab), PD-1 blockade (nivolumab) combined with CTLA-4 blockade 
(ipilimumab) and, in addition for BRAFV600-mutated melanoma, BRAF inhibition (vemurafenib, 
dabrafenib, encorafenib) combined with MEK inhibition (cobimetinib, trametinib, binimetinib). Patients 
for whom immunotherapy can be delivered safely for the first few months, i.e. patients with tumours 
not progressing very quickly and not immediately threatening an important organ or function, should 
be considered for immunotherapy first, preserving targeted therapies for the subsequent lines. 
Assessment report  
EMA/720884/2022  
Page 140/147 
 
 
 
Combination treatment of ipilimumab and nivolumab has markedly improved survival with a 5-year OS 
rate of 52%. However, as the toxicity profile of the ipilimumab and nivolumab combination is non-
negligible, there is still a need for more safe therapies. Similarly, there is a need for more effective 
therapies as part of the patient population fail to respond to these therapies or respond but then later 
relapse.  
There are no standard approaches to treating patients without BRAF mutations once they progress 
after receiving anti-PD-1 therapy. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Pivotal study CA224047 is a seamless Phase 2/3, randomised, double-blind study of relatlimab + 
nivolumab vs. nivolumab monotherapy in subjects with previously untreated metastatic or 
unresectable melanoma. A total of 714 patients were randomised (1:1) to receive either relatlimab 
plus nivolumab, or nivolumab monotherapy. Randomisation was stratified by PD-L1 expression (≥ 1% 
vs. < 1%), LAG-3 expression (≥ 1% vs. < 1%), BRAF mutation (V600 mutation positive vs. V600 wild-
type), and AJCC M stage (M0/M1 with normal LDH vs. M1 with elevated LDH). The approved indication 
is based on the results from 421 patients with PD-L1 < 1%. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary objective was to compare PFS (per BICR) of rela+nivo FDC to nivolumab monotherapy 
with OS and ORR as key secondary endpoints (ITT). 
At the time of the database lock (9 March 2021) and a median duration of follow-up of 13 months, 
rela+nivo FDC showed a statistically significant improvement in PFS vs. nivolumab monotherapy, HR: 
0.75 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.92, log-rank p-value 0.0055). Median PFS was 10.12 months with rela+nivo 
FDC versus 4.63 months with nivolumab monotherapy. An updated PFS analysis with a median follow-
up of 19.27 months (at the time of OS analysis 28-Oct-2021 DBL) supported the primary analysis,  
OS data were not statistically significant at the time of the final analysis (28-Oct-2021 DBL); HR of 
0.80 (95% CI: 0.64, 1.01). Median OS was not reached for rela+nivo FDC (95% CI: 34.20, N.A.) and 
34.10 months (95% CI: 25.23, N.A.) for nivolumab monotherapy. 
ORR was 43.1% (95% CI: 37.9, 48.4) vs 32.6% (95% CI: 27.8, 37.7) in the rela+nivo FDC and 
nivolumab monotherapy arm, respectively (28-Oct-2021 DBL). 
In subjects with PD-L1 low expression the use of the combination appears to offer additional PFS 
benefit while there is little additional benefit observed in subjects with a higher expression on PD-L1 
(HR 0.66; 95% CI: 0.54, 0.84 vs HR 0.95; 95% CI: 0.68, 1.33 with a cut-off of 1%). 
Similar to PFS, the KM curves of OS separate for PD-L1 negative patients. KM-curves for OS only start 
to separate late (30 months) in the PD-L1 positive subgroup where there is still extensive censoring.  
ORR data showed an increase in ORR for the combination treatment over monotherapy of 8% and 12% 
for PD-L1 ≥1% and PD-L1 <1% subgroup, respectively. 
Exploratory subgroup analyses for PFS supported a beneficial effect of rela+nivo FDC over nivo 
monotherapy in most important subgroups as HR was below 1. This includes important subgroups with 
a worse prognosis like BRAF mutation, high HDL and baseline metastasis stage of M1c. Comparable 
HRs were observed for LAG-3 low expression (<1%, HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.54, 1.15) and LAG-3 high 
expression (≥ 1%, HR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.59, 0.95). 
Assessment report  
EMA/720884/2022  
Page 141/147 
 
 
 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Though OS results were not statistically significant and have not reached full maturity, KM-curves show 
a clear separation between treatment arms supporting the primary endpoint and excluding a 
detrimental effect in the ITT population. ORR data could not be formally tested due to the hierarchical 
testing strategy (OS first). Nevertheless, response rates numerically favour the combination treatment 
over monotherapy and are also considered supportive for the primary endpoint in the ITT population. 
The applicant was recommended to provide additional descriptive OS data. Survival follow-up 
continues for approximately 5 years and will be submitted when available. 
Efficacy in adolescents ≥12-18 years was uncertain as no adolescents were included in the pivotal 
study. An extrapolation approach from adults to adolescents using relatlimab and nivolumab exposures 
based on similarity of disease and expected similarity of outcome to treatment is acceptable, as 
exposures between adults and adolescent (≥ 12 years) with the adult and adolescent posology are 
similar. The latter accounts for relatlimab as well as for nivolumab (see clinical pharmacology part of 
this AR). Therefore, based on sufficiently comparable exposure to relatlimab and nivolumab in 
adolescents and adults weighing 30 kg or more and considering comparable pathophysiology between 
the two patient populations, the proposed inclusion of adolescents 12 years of age and older on the 
therapeutic indication is considered acceptable. In the SmPC section 4.2, the 30 kg cut-off used in the 
popPK simulations is referred to with a cross reference to section 5.2 (see SmPC). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Almost all patients experienced all-causality AEs, any grade 97% and 94%, grade 3-4 40% and 33% 
for rela+nivo FDC and nivo, respectively. Regarding drug-related AEs, the reported incidence of any 
grade AEs was 81.1% in the rela+nivo FDC arm and 69.9% in the nivo arm while grade 3-4 drug-
related AEs were reported by 18.9% and 9.7% of subjects, respectively. 
The most frequently (>15%) reported any grade AEs in the rela+nivo FDC were fatigue (29%), 
pruritus (25%), arthralgia (24%), diarrhoea (23%), headache (18%), nausea (17%), rash (17%) and 
hypothyroidism (15%).  
The most frequently reported drug-related AEs (rela+nivo FDC) were pruritus (23.4%), fatigue 
(23.1%), rash (15.5%), arthralgia (14.4%), hypothyroidism (14.4%), diarrhoea (13.5%), and vitiligo 
(10.4%); these AEs were predominantly of low grade.  
The most frequently reported Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs (rela+nivo FDC) were increased lipase 
(1.7%), increased ALT (1.4%), increased AST (1.4%), and fatigue (1.1%). 
As of the 09-Mar-2021 DBL, 30.4% subjects in the rela+nivo FDC arm and 33.1% of subjects in the 
nivolumab monotherapy arm died during the study. Disease progression was the most common cause 
of death in both arms. A similar proportion of subjects in the rela+nivo FDC (0.8%; 3 subjects) and 
nivolumab (0.6%; 2 subjects) arms died due to study drug toxicity during the study. This was caused 
by haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, acute oedema of the lung and pneumonitis in the rela+nivo 
FDC group and in the nivo group sepsis+myocarditis and worsening pneumonia. 
SAEs were reported by 34.1% of subjects in the rela+nivo arm and 29.2% in the nivolumab arm and 
the most common drug-related SAEs in the combination arm were colitis, diarrhoea and myocarditis 
(1.1% each). 
The overall frequencies of AEs leading to discontinuation (all-causality and drug-related) were higher in 
the rela+nivo FDC arm (19%) compared with the nivolumab arm (11%) as was the case for Grade 3-4 
events in both treatment arms (11.5% vs 6.4%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/720884/2022  
Page 142/147 
 
 
 
Regarding IMAEs, all categories presented a higher number of subjects from the rela+nivo treatment 
arm although the type of events were similar between both arms. 
OESIs were reported in 17.5% in the rela+nivo FDC arm and 13.6% in the nivolumab arm. In the 
rela+nivo FDC arm 76 of the 83 OESIs, were resolved at the time of DBL. In the nivolumab arm 64 of 
the 75 OESIs were resolved at the time of DBL. Myocarditis was reported infrequently at 1.7% and 
0.6% in the rela+nivo FDC and nivolumab arms, respectively. Troponin elevation was reported in 
11.5% of subjects in the rela+nivo FDC arm and 10.0% of subjects in the nivolumab arm. CNS AEs 
(including encephalitis, meningitis, and demyelination) were reported: 2 subjects each in the rela+nivo 
FDC and nivolumab arms experienced encephalitis. Also, some events of Guillain-Barré Syndrome, 
pancreatitis, uveitis and myositis were reported with the combination. AEs of pancreatitis and uveitis 
were also reported in the nivolumab arm. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Safety data in adolescents is missing and long-term safety effect in this patient population is unknown. 
Available safety data for nivolumab in adolescents, suggest a similar short term toxicity profile in 
adults and adolescents. Safety follow up in adolescents is planned in a post-authorisation safety study, 
i.e. CA224122 (DMTR) (cat 3 RMP).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The median PFS results of 10.12 months with rela+nivo FDC versus 4.63 months with nivolumab 
monotherapy and a HR of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.92, log-rank p-value 0.0055), in the overall 
population could be considered a clinically relevant benefit. OS data, though not statistically significant 
and not fully mature, show a trend for a clinical benefit of the combination treatment over 
monotherapy as well. A detrimental effect can be excluded. In addition, ORR data numerically favour 
the combination treatment over monotherapy and is in line with the primary endpoint in the ITT 
population. 
In general, a beneficial effect on PFS was observed among important (prognostic) subgroups and 
independent of LAG-3 expression. However, the effect in the ITT population appears to be driven by 
the PD-L1 <1% subgroup as no PFS benefit of relatlimab in combination with nivolumab was shown in 
the subgroup of patients with high PD-L1 expression (cut-off 1%). As seen for PFS, KM-curves of OS 
separate in the PD-L1 <1% subgroup but overlap in the PD-L1 ≥1% subgroup. ORR is numerically in 
favour of the combination treatment in both PD-L1 defined subgroups, however it is uncertain whether 
this translates into clinical benefit for these patients, while it is known that the PD-L1 subgroup ≥1% 
responds well to nivolumab monotherapy. Notably, similar results for the PD-L1 defined subgroups 
were seen at the time of the MAA of the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab in the same target 
population. Long-term follow-up data on OS up till 5 years did not show a benefit of ipi+nivo in the PD-
L1 ≥1% subgroup over nivolumab monotherapy, despite a 10% difference in ORR (see Opdivo SmPC).

In the dossier at hand the PD-L1 subgroup analysis was not alpha-controlled, but exploratory analysis 
were pre-planned in the SAP and randomisation was stratified for PD-L1 with a cut-off of 1% based on 
previous data. Therefore, in combination with the available efficacy results and the plausible biological 
rationale for nivolumab monotherapy inferring clinical benefit in patients expressing PD-L1, it is 
concluded that only for patients with no or low PD-L1 expression (<1%), benefit of the combination 
therapy is demonstrated. The applicant has restricted the indication by tumour PD-L1<1%.   
The qualitative safety profile of the combination was comparable to that known for nivolumab 
monotherapy and no new safety signals were identified. In general, rela+nivo showed more toxicity 
than nivolumab monotherapy, as to be expected from a combination treatment, e.g. the numerical 
incidence of grade 3-4 drug-related SAEs is higher in the rela+nivo FDC patients versus nivo. Although 
the overall frequencies of all causality and drug-related AEs were also higher in the rela+nivo FDC arm, 
the majority were of low grade (Grades 1-2), and the safety profile of rela+nivo FDC was manageable 
using well established AE management guidelines. Notably, in the rela+nivo FDC group 14.6% versus 
nivo 6.7% of patients had to discontinue treatment because of drug-related adverse events. 
The median treatment duration of patients was 5 months, which is rather short to assess the safety 
over time. However, around 30% of patients in both treatment arms have been treated over 12 
months. At time of DBL the median follow-up was 13 months. An update of the safety data with a 
median follow-up of 19.3 months supported the previous analyses and no new safety signals were 
identified. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Relatlimab+nivolumab FDC has demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically relevant 
improvement in PFS in the ITT population. This is supported by a trend for benefit in OS and 
numerically higher ORR, whereas an OS detriment can be excluded. However, considering the lack of 
benefit observed with rela+nivo FDC in patients with PD-L1 ≥1% and that the proposed combination is 
more toxic and less well tolerated than nivolumab monotherapy, the indication was restricted to the 
PD-L1<1% patients. For the patient population with PD-L1<1%, the benefit/risk ratio is considered 
positive based on a clinically relevant improvement in terms of PFS and manageable toxicity. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
No adolescents were included in the clinical studies. Given the similarity of disease histology, genetic 
background, treatment and prognosis of metastatic melanoma for adults and adolescents, and 
sufficiently comparable predicted drug exposure in adults and adolescents, based on popPK simulations 
in patients weighing at least 30 kg, extrapolation of efficacy and safety from adults to the adolescent 
population is considered acceptable. In these simulations, both the situation of a reduced clearance 
and volume of distribution of relatlimab and nivolumab, as well as the situation of a comparable 
clearance and volume of distribution in adolescents and adults, was simulated. In both cases the 
exposure is considered sufficiently comparable between adolescent and adult patients. Therefore, 
inclusion of adolescents 12 years of age and older in the indication is considered approvable. 
The available safety data of nivolumab in adolescents, indicate a comparable short term safety profile 
for adolescents as for adults. Given that nivolumab and relatlimab are both check-point inhibitors, also 
for relatlimab a comparable short term safety profile for adolescents and adults may be expected in 
case of comparable exposure. Long term safety data are missing, especially the long-term effect of 
endocrine AEs might be different between adults and adolescents. Given the poor prognosis of 
adolescents with metastatic or unresectable (advanced melanoma), the uncertainty regarding the long-
term toxicity profile is not considered a major concern. In addition, long-term safety will be followed-

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Opdualag is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
decision that the benefit-risk balance of Opdualag is favourable in the following indication(s): 
Opdualag is indicated for the first-line treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma 
in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older with tumour cell PD-L1 expression < 1%.  
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
•  Periodic Safety Update Reports 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
•  Additional risk minimisation measures 
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where Opdualag is marketed, all healthcare 
professionals and patients/caregivers who are expected to prescribe and use Opdualag have access

•  Signs or symptoms of the safety concern and when to seek attention from a HCP 
•  Contact details of the Opdualag prescriber 
The MAH shall agree about the format and content of the above educational material with the National 
Competent Authority prior to launch of Opdualag in each Member State. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that relatlimab is to be qualified 
as a new active substance in itself as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously 
authorised within the European Union. 
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0070/2021 and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

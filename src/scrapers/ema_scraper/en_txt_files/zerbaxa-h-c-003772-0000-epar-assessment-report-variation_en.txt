4.  Scientific discussion 
4.1.  Introduction 
Infections due to resistant Gram-negative bacteria are increasingly common also in paediatric patients. 
Beta-lactamases are a major cause of resistance to beta-lactam antibacterial agents in infections caused 
by Gram-negative pathogens. The increasing resistance has significantly limited treatment options in 
patients with suspected extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) infections and often only carbapenems 
have sufficient coverage for empiric use in these cases. 
Few antibiotics with activity against ESBL and carbapenemase producing Gram-negative bacteria are 
currently available. Furthermore, only a few antibacterial agents have had their safety and efficacy 
carefully evaluated in paediatric patients. Hence, there is need for further treatment options for the 
paediatric patient population. 
Zerbaxa – Ceftolozane/tazobactam (C/T) - is a fixed drug combination that has been developed as an 
intravenously administered compound.  
- Ceftolozane belongs to the cephalosporin class of antimicrobials. Ceftolozane exerts bactericidal activity 
through binding to important penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), resulting in inhibition of bacterial cell-wall 
synthesis and subsequent cell death. 
- Tazobactam is a beta-lactam structurally related to penicillins. It is an irreversible inhibitor of some 
beta-lactamases (e.g., certain penicillinases and cephalosporinases), and can bind covalently to some 
chromosomal and plasmid-mediated bacterial beta-lactamases. Tazobactam has little antibacterial activity 
in itself. 
At the time of this application, Zerbaxa was approved for adults in complicated intra-abdominal infections 
(cIAI), acute pyelonephritis (AP), complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) and hospital-acquired 
pneumonia (HAP), including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 
This application was submitted for ceftolozane/tazobactam in order to expand the age range for the 
treatment of AP, cUTI and cIAI to include use in paediatric patients from birth (defined as >32 weeks 
gestational age and ≥7 days postnatal) to <18 years of age. 
In support of the application, results from 3 clinical studies listed in the agreed paediatric investigation 
plan (PIP) were submitted; 2 completed Phase 2 studies in AP/cUTI and cIAI (P034 and P035, 
respectively, both completed in 2021) and 1 completed Phase 1 study (P010, completed in 2017, 
studying safety and PK of a single-dose of Zerbaxa).  
4.1.1.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The MAH provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. Furthermore, the MAH 
declared in the study reports that studies were “conducted in accordance with local and/or national 
regulations (including all applicable data protection laws and regulations), ICH GCP and with the ethical 
principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki regarding IEC review, informed consent and 
the protection of human participants in biomedical research (MSD Code of Conduct for Interventional 
Clinical Trials).”

4.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic, or toxicology studies were conducted to support the 
paediatric indication for C/T treatment of paediatric patients, from birth to <18 years of age, with cUTI 
(including pyelonephritis), or cIAI. However, in the non-clinical dossier submitted with the initial 
application for marketing authorisation for Zerbaxa EMEA/H/C/3772 (AP/cUTI and cIAI in adults), studies 
in juvenile rats were included. These studies are listed as Non Clinical measures in the agreed PIP (EMEA-
001142-PIP01-11-M03). The MAH submitted an updated overview and assessment of these relevant data, 
focusing on safety aspects related to use in paediatric patients from birth to < 18 years of age. In line 
with this, an updated assessment of non-clinical paediatric data is included below.  
4.2.1.  Introduction 
Summary of general toxicity profile for ceftolozane and tazobactam 
Ceftolozane’s pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity, both alone and in combination with 
tazobactam, have been well characterized in a comprehensive series of in vitro and in vivo non-clinical 
studies, including GLP-compliant IV repeat dose toxicity studies of up to 4 weeks duration.  
Ceftolozane-related effects in rats and dogs were limited primarily to non-adverse microscopic presence 
of reversible hyaline droplets in proximal tubular cells in renal cortex in rats and dogs, in parallel with 
accumulation of ceftolozane in renal tissue following repeated dosing. The occurrence of hyaline droplets 
within the proximal tubular epithelium of the kidney represents lysosomes containing drug and membrane 
remnants and has been described also for other cephalosporins. Reversible decreased total bilirubin and 
increased ALAT, changes in liver weight and histological changes, were noted in dogs administered 
ceftolozane.  
No repeat-dose toxicity studies were conducted with tazobactam alone. A well-known tazobactam-related 
effect evident in animals is a reversible accumulation of glycogen in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes.  
No new effects or unexpected toxicities were observed in adult rat or dog when ceftolozane was combined 
with tazobactam for 2 to 4 weeks. Non-adverse, reversible changes evident in the kidney and liver were 
consistent with findings noted in studies with either compound alone. See Table 1 for NOAELs, 
corresponding exposure data and safety margins calculated based on a clinical AUC of 345/82.8 µg.h/mL 
in cIAI patients. In the lack of severe toxicity, the margins of safety were considered acceptable.

The weight of evidence suggests that ceftolozane alone and in combination with tazobactam has a low 
potential for genotoxicity. Ceftolozane showed a potential for local tolerance effects in rodents, a low

potential for antigenicity and reproductive effects, and no potential for phototoxicity, immunotoxicity, or 
hemolytic activity.  
During the initial MAA assessment, the clinical relevance of a decrease in auditory startle response 
observed in postnatal day (PND) 60 male and female F1 rats at maternal ceftolozane doses of 300 and 
1000 mg/kg/day during pregnancy and lactation was discussed. Although not confirmed in juvenile rat 
studies, a clinical relevance in the setting of in utero exposure could not be excluded and relevant 
information was included in Section 4.6 of the SmPC.

4.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
A non-GLP subcutaneous pharmacokinetic study of ceftolozane and tazobactam in post-natal

Following a single subcutaneous administration of ceftolozane in combination with tazobactam in a 2-to-1 
dose ratio to post-natal day (PND) 4 male and female Sprague-Dawley rats, the achieved systemic 
exposures of ceftolozane and tazobactam were demonstrated to be approximately dose proportional, with 
similar exposures observed in both male and female neonate animals. See Table 2 and Table 3.

4.2.4.  Toxicology 
Reproduction toxicity 
A subcutaneous 14-day dose range finding juvenile toxicity and toxicokinetic study in 
postnatal day (PND) 4 SD rats 
Neonatal (PND 4) SD rats (6/sex/group) were administered ceftolozane/tazobactam at 0 (vehicle control), 
50/25, 300/150 and 1000/500 mg/kg/day (sc) for 14 days. An additional 18 PND4 rats/sex/group were 
utilized to determine toxicokinetics of the test articles. Parameters included mortality and moribundity, 
cageside observations, body weights, haematology, clinical chemistry, toxicokinetics on PND17, gross 
necropsy, organ weights, femur length, and histopathology on selected tissues. 
No test article-related mortalities occurred and no effects on body weights, femur length, haematology, 
clinical chemistry, or gross necropsy were noted. Adverse clinical signs related to ceftolozane/tazobactam 
included decreased motor activity, lost or impaired righting reflex, and ataxia in the 1000/500 mg/kg/day 
dose group between PND 12 through 16. These effects generally occurred on a single day. Non-adverse 
red and/or purple discoloration was noted at the injection site in 17 of 18 male and female toxicokinetic 
rats on PNDs 4, 5, and/or 6 at 1000/500 mg/kg/day.  
A non-adverse, dose dependent increase in absolute liver and kidney weights were noted at dose levels ≥
300/150 mg/kg/day. Liver weights were 6% to 8% higher than controls in the 300/150 mg/kg/day dose 
group and 11% to 17% higher in the 1000/500 mg/kg/day dose group. Paired kidney weights were 7% to 
12% higher than controls in the 300/150 mg/kg/day dose group and 21% to 24% higher in the 1000/500 
mg/kg/day dose group. Increased liver and kidney weights correlated with microscopic findings (mild 
centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy) in five male rats and a single female rat at 1000/500 mg/kg/day 
and in a single male rat at 300/150 mg/kg/day. The degree of hypertrophy seen in these animals was 
unlikely to be clinically significant, and no associated necrosis was present. Cortical tubular vacuolation 
and basophilia, and minimal to mild cortical fibrosis were seen in the kidney of both male and female rats 
in the 1000/500 mg/kg/day dose group. Cortical tubular vacuolation was noted in four of six female rats 
in the 300/150 mg/kg/day dose group. Hyaline droplets were also present in the proximal convoluted 
tubular epithelium of two male rats in the 1000/500 mg/kg/day dose group. No epithelial cell necrosis 
was identified in the renal tubules, but the presence of tubular basophilia is consistent with recent cell 
loss that may have occurred during the dosing phase and subsequent regenerative activity. Foci of renal 
cortical fibrosis are also suggestive of previous tubular damage that possibly occurred during the dosing 
phase.  
NOAEL for sc administration of ceftolozane/ tazobactam to male and female neonatal SD rats from PND 4 
through 17 was considered to be 300/150 mg/kg/day, which correlated with mean PND 17 AUC0-∞ and 
Cmax values of 657/145 µg.h/mL and 416/184 µg/mL, respectively. The AUC based safety margins for 
AP/cUTI and cIAI in paediatric patients are 1.3 and 1.2 for ceftolozane and tazobactam, respectively. 
28-day subcutaneous toxicity study including toxicokinetics with a 28-day recovery period in 
neonatal SD rats 
Neonatal (PND 4) SD rats (20/sex/group) were administered ceftolozane/tazobactam at 0 (vehicle 
control), 50/25, 300/150 and 1000/500 mg/kg/day (sc) for 28 days. The reversal of potential ceftolozane 
effects was examined following a 4-week recovery period (10/sex/group). Parameters evaluated during 
the study included morbidity/mortality, clinical signs of toxicity, body weights, food consumption, 
toxicokinetics, ophthalmology, sexual maturation, acoustic startle response, functional observational

battery, motor activity, femur length, haematology, coagulation, blood chemistry, urinalysis, gross 
pathology, organ weights, and histopathology. 
No mortalities related to ceftolozane/tazobactam were observed. Administration at doses up to 1000/500 
mg/kg/day was not associated with any effects on body weights, food consumption, ophthalmology, 
sexual maturation, femur length, acoustic startle, functional observational battery, motor activity, 
coagulation, blood chemistry, or urinalysis, or gross pathology. Ceftolozane/tazobactam-related adverse 
clinical signs of decreased motor activity and/or impaired righting reflex occurred at ≥300/150 
mg/kg/day and were considered adverse at 1000/500 mg/kg/day. The decreased motor activity and 
impaired righting reflex generally occurred simultaneously, shortly after dose administration and were 
generally resolved within 1- to 2-hour post-dose observation. These effects were not observed at any 
dose level following the 28-day recovery period. 
The weights of the paired kidneys and the ratios of the paired kidney weights to the terminal body weight 
and the brain weight were increased (from 8% to 30% above control) in males and females at ≥ 300/150 
mg/kg/day on PND 32. 
Values for erythrocytes, haemoglobin and haematocrit were significantly reduced (7% -10%) at 1000/500 
mg/kg/day on PND 32, but because they were of a small magnitude and within the historical control 
range, they were not considered adverse. Centrilobular hypertrophy of hepatocytes, characterized by 
increased cytoplasmic volume and translucency of affected cells, was observed at 1000/500 mg/kg/day. 
This is consistent with the cytoplasmic alteration that has been described previously in association with 
tazobactam. In the absence of effects on liver weight and clinical chemistry, these changes were 
considered to be adaptive and non-adverse. Centrilobular hypertrophy was also observed at the end of 
the recovery period; however, there was a trend toward lesser severity at that time point, suggestive of 
ongoing resolution.  
Based on the adverse clinical signs observed at 1000/500 mg/kg/day, the NOAEL for this study was 
300/150 mg/kg/day. The TK data for ceftolozane and tazobactam are presented in Table 4. 
The highest mean AUC across the paediatric age groups of both the AP/cUTI and cIAI indications studied 
in the paediatric clinical trials were used to calculate margins for ceftolozane and tazobactam. The PND 31 
AUC based safety margins are 0.59 and 0.26 for ceftolozane and tazobactam, respectively.

4.2.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No environmental risk assessment was included as part of this extension of indication application for 
Zerbaxa on the grounds that the predicted environmental concentrations of ceftolozane and tazobactam 
are not expected to increase.  
An extension of indication to include paediatric patient groups can potentially increase the total 
consumption of Zerbaxa, and consequently the environment exposure of ceftolozane and tazobactam. It 
was, however, acknowledged by the CHMP that in a previous application that led to extending the 
indication to treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia in adults (EMEA/H/C/003772/II/0020), predicted 
environmental concentration (PEC) and risk quotient (RQ) values were updated for surface water, 
groundwater and wastewater treatment facilities, based on a maximum daily dose of 6 g ceftolozane and 
3 g tazobactam and a default market penetration factor (Fpen) of 0.01. All RQs for tazobactam were 
under the threshold of 1, indicating no risk to the environment. For Ceftolozane a risk for surfacewater 
was indicated, which was confirmed after refinement of Fpen. Considering use of default Fpen, that 
environmental risk assessment covers also this application for extension of indication. Section 6.6 of the 
SmPC for ZERBAXA includes the following statement: 
One of the active ingredients, ceftolozane, may have harmful effects if it reaches the aquatic environment 
(see section 5.3). Do not throw away any unused medicinal product or waste material via wastewater. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed in accordance with local 
requirements. These measures will help protect the environment. 
Considering the above, the CHMP considered that Zerbaxa should be used according to the precautions 
stated in the SmPC in order to minimise any potential risks to the environment. 
4.2.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Juvenile toxicity 
In GLP-compliant repeat dose toxicity studies performed in adult rat and dog, effects associated with 
ceftolozane and tazobactam treatment alone were limited to non-adverse changes in the kidney and liver, 
respectively. Studies in juvenile animals were justified by the need to evaluate potential increased 
sensitivity to toxicity in immature and developing organs. Rat appeared to be more sensitive than dog 
and was appropriately selected as species for juvenile animal testing. The juvenile animal studies 
performed are in compliance with the approved PIP. Sc administration was selected for practical reasons 
given the young age of the rats. Juvenile rats were treated from PND 4, which would support children 
from gestation week 32 or later since both liver and kidneys are immature in PND 4 rats (Ref. ICH S11). 
Notable findings in the non-GLP 14-day range-finding and the definitive 28-day GLP studies in juvenile 
rats included: 
- 
adverse clinical signs (decreased motor activity, lost/impaired righting reflex, ataxia) at 1000/500 
mg/kg/day. The signs occurred shortly after dosing, but they resolved quickly indicating they 
were not a developmental consequence and appeared to be Cmax-related. These clinical signs 
were not associated with findings in the functional observational battery in rats, were seen at high 
multiples to the clinical plasma Cmax, did not have a histopathological correlate, and are clinically 
monitorable and reversible. As such, these clinical signs were considered of limited concern for 
clinical safety. 
- 
adverse renal effects in the non-GLP study, suggestive of possible renal tubular degeneration that 
may have occurred earlier in the study. However, these possible adverse renal effects did not

EMA/644705/2022 
Page 13/127 
 
 
 
 
 
replicate in the definitive rat GLP 28-day (PND 4-31) toxicity study that utilized the same doses 
and a longer dosing period and larger group sizes. Due to the absence of findings in the definitive 
rat GLP 28-day (PND 4-31) toxicity study initiated in rats at an age equivalent to pre-term 
infants, the possible renal findings in the range-finding study are considered of limited 
significance.  
- 
other findings reported in the definitive 28-day juvenile toxicity study (decreases in erythrocytes, 
hemoglobin, and hematocrit and centrilobular hypertrophy of hepatocyte histomorphologically, 
only at the highest dose) were non adverse and either reversed or were in the process of 
reversing following a 28-day recovery period. 
Overall, the toxicity profile in neonatal and juvenile rats does not indicate developmental toxicity or more 
severe effects compared to older rats. Furthermore, juvenile rats do not appear to be significantly more 
sensitive to toxicity. The decrease in auditory startle response observed in PND 60 male and female F1 
rats in a previous peri-post natal rat study (initial MA procedure) was not confirmed in juvenile rat 
studies. The information included in SmPC section 4.6 is, however, still considered appropriate and 
relevant in the setting of in utero exposure.  
Together with clinical safety data, the study results support the safe use of Zerbaxa for the treatment of 
AP/cUTI and cIAI in paediatric patients from birth to less than 18 years of age.  
4.2.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Paediatric data on non-clinical aspects 
The toxicity profile in neonatal and juvenile rats does not indicate developmental toxicity or more severe 
effects compared to older rats. Furthermore, juvenile rats do not appear to be significantly more sensitive 
to toxicity. The decrease in auditory startle response observed in PND 60 male and female F1 rats in a 
previous peri-post natal rat study (initial MA procedure) was not confirmed in juvenile rat studies. The 
information included in SmPC section 4.6 is however still considered appropriate and relevant in the 
setting of in utero exposure.  
Together with clinical safety data, the study results support the safe use of Zerbaxa for the treatment of 
AP/cUTI and cIAI in paediatric patients from birth to less than 18 years of age.

4.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The original marketing application for ceftolozane/tazobactam (C/T) included data from 13 studies (2 
Phase 3, 2 Phase 2, and 9 Phase 1). The Phase 1 studies characterized the clinical pharmacology profile 
of C/T by defining the general pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of C/T or ceftolozane alone, effects of 
intrinsic factors (eg, renal impairment), effects of extrinsic factors (eg, DDIs), tissue distribution (e.g., 
ELF), and pharmacodynamics (PD) (eg, QT/corrected QTc interval). These studies were performed to 
support the initial marketing application for the use of Zerbaxa 1.5 g (C/T) powder for concentrate for 
infusion in the treatment of adult patients with complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI), including 
pyelonephritis and complicated inter-abdominal infections (cIAI) (EMEA/H/C/3772). The indication was 
later extended to include Nosocomial pneumonia (NP) including HA(B)P/VA(B)P 
(EMEA/H/C/003772/II/0020) with the dosing regimen 3 g C/T q8h. That extension of indication 
application included 3 additional studies (2 Phase 1 and one Phase 3 study) to support the new adult NP 
indication and dose regimen. Table 6 shows the key PK characteristics of Zerbaxa established in previous 
procedures.

Overview of new pharmacokinetics data 
This application to extend the cUTI, AP and cIAI indications to children and adolescents from birth 
(defined as >32 weeks gestational age and ≥7 days postnatal) to <18 years is supported by one phase 1 
(P010: P010MK7625A) and two phase 2 studies; 
• 
• 
P034: P034MK7625A (Please note that the patient population in this study is called cUTI in the 
clinical pharmacology report, but is comprised of both patients with cUTI and AP) 
P035: P035MK7625A (patients with cIAI).  
In study P010, extensive PK data were collected from patients ≥3 months of age and sparse samples 
were collected for patients <3 months of age. Sparse PK data was collected from patients in P034 and 
Assessment report  
EMA/644705/2022

P035. These PK data were used to develop a paediatric population PK model based on prior information 
from established adult population PK (population-PK) models and re-investigate covariates impacting the 
PK of C/T in paediatric patients. Furthermore, the population-PK model was used to derive individual PK 
exposure metrics, which in turn were used to explore exposure-response relationships of Zerbaxa in 
children and adolescents with AP/cUTI or cIAI, as well as a joint PTA analysis to support the paediatric 
dose recommendations. After a request from the CHMP, the population PK models of ceftolozane and 
tazobactam were also used to perform additional simulations to provide dosing recommendation in 
paediatric patients (2 to <18 years) with renal impairment category (moderate and severe). Further to 
additional questions by the CHMP, the MAH withdrew the initial proposals for dosing recommendations in 
paediatric patients aged 2 to <18 years of age with moderate or severe renal impairment (see section 
Special populations - Paediatric patients with impaired or immature renal function). Table 7 shows the 
design of the studies supporting the application.  
There are no expected differences in the mechanism of action of C/T based on age as both ceftolozane 
and tazobactam exert their effects by acting on the causative pathogen, and the Gram-negative causative 
pathogens are similar in adults and children, and the same joint PK/PD targets would be relevant to dose 
setting in paediatric patients. Thus, the aim of the dose selection was to achieve comparable exposures to 
those calculated for adult patients with cIAI and AP/cUTI. 
The initial dose in study P010 was subject to change based upon the interim analysis of PK and safety 
data, resulting in the following dosing regimen in the two Phase 2 studies (P034 and P035);  
•  Group 1 (12 to <18 years): 1 g ceftolozane and 0.5 g tazobactam 
•  Group 2-5 (birth to <12 years): 20 mg/kg ceftolozane and 10 mg/kg tazobactam (maximum 
ceftolozane 1 g and tazobactam 0.5 g/dose).  
In the Phase 2 studies (P034 and P035), one of the exclusion criteria was CrCL <50 mL/min/1.73 m2. In 
study P010 estimated renal function was also an inclusion criteria (Groups 1 through 4 needed CrCL ≥80 
mL/min/1.73m2, Group 5 needed CrCL ≥50 mL/min/1.73m2, Group 6 needed CrCL ≥20 mL/min/1.73m2). 
Creatinine clearance estimated in the clinical trials (CrCL) was calculated by the Bedside Schwartz 
equation. 
In this application, the proposed posology in children and adolescents from birth to <18 years with 
AP/cUTI or cIAI and with eGFR>50 mL/min/1.73 m2 is 30 mg/kg (20 mg/kg ceftolozane and 10 mg/kg 
tazobactam) up to a maximum dose of 1.5 g (1 g ceftolozane and 0.5 g tazobactam for ≥50 kg body 
weight) administered every 8th hour by IV infusion over 1 hour. As can be seen, this is a simplified dosing 
regimen compared to the age-based dose regimen that was administered in the Phase 1 and Phase 2 
studies (Table 7 shows the dosing regimens in the Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies).  
No new formulation was developed for use in the paediatric AP/cUTI and cIAI indications, and no new 
biopharmaceutical studies were conducted to support this variation application. The formulation used in 
the paediatric studies submitted with this application is the intended formulation for use in paediatric 
patients and was identical to the currently marketed formulation approved for use in adults.

Methods 
• 
Analytical methods 
Bioanalysis 
In all studies ceftolozane and tazobactam were analysed using LC-MS/MS methods but the laboratories 
that performed the analyses varied. According to the MAH, the bioanalytical methods used for 
determination of concentrations of ceftolozane, tazobactam and tazobactam M1 in plasma samples from 
clinical studies are the same as those previously described and assessed in the initial procedure 
(EMEA/H/C/3772).  
In study P010, plasma concentrations of ceftolozane, tazobactam and tazobactam M1 in subject samples 
were measured using the validated LC-MS/MS method MN14014. In the studies P034 and P035, 
plasma concentrations of ceftolozane and tazobactam in subject samples were measured using the 
validated LC-MS/MS method PMRI-1756-18 v.00. While tazobactam M1 were measured using the 
Assessment report

validated LC-MS/MS method PMRI-1757-18 v.00. The analytical ranges were the same in all studies 
(0.25 to 150 μg/mL, 0.10 to 60.0 μg/mL, and 0.05 to 30.0 μg/mL for ceftolozane, tazobactam, and 
tazobactam M1, respectively). 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  described  validation  of  the  bioanalytical  assays  for  quantification  of 
ceftolozane, tazobactam and tazobactam M1 in human plasma to be acceptable in the initial MAA procedure 
(EMEA/H/C/3772). 
The  acceptance  criteria  used  for  the  in-study  validation  was  in  accordance  with  the  CHMP  Guideline  on 
bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1 Corr. 2**), and the within-study 
validation of the studies P010, P034 and P035 was successful. The previously established sample storage 
stability covered the storage period of the study samples. 
Incurred sample reproducibility was assessed for >10% of samples in study P034 and P035, and ~10% 
(9.6%) of samples in study P010. The ISR met acceptance criteria i.e. at least 2/3 of all the analysed ISR 
samples had no more than a ±20.0% difference when compared to the original analysis results, which is in 
accordance with CHMP Guideline on bioanalytical method validation, and thus considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
Database  
The population PK analysis included paediatric data from two Phase 2 studies [AP/cUTI (P034) and cIAI 
(P035)] and one Phase 1 PK study (P010). P010 was conducted in patients with proven or suspected 
gram-negative infections, whereas P034 and P035 were conducted in patients with AP/cUTI or cIAI, 
respectively. The studies are described under the section on Special populations in this assessment 
report.  
A total of 194 subjects from the three clinical studies were included in the analysis dataset, and 3 
subjects were excluded due to unreasonable PK profiles. A total of 191 subjects were included in the final 
dataset: 35 (18.3%) from PN010, 89 (46.6%) from PN034, and 65 (35.1%) from PN035. There were 596 
ceftolozane and 594 tazobactam samples in total; of which, 2 samples were BLQ for ceftolozane and 98 
samples BLQ for tazobactam. The following 3 subjects were excluded from the PK population:  
•  1  subject  from  Group  1  with  drug  concentration  BLQ  at  the  end  of  infusion.  This  subject  had 
measurable pre-dose concentrations, suggesting a possible sample switch.  
•  1 subject from Group 5 with a site-reported infusion issue wherein drug was not completely flushed 
through the infusion line after administration.  
•  1 subject from Group 6 (20/10 mg/kg dose) with insufficient plasma available in the PK samples 
for drug quantification.  
Characteristics of participants in all three studies, including covariates of interest, are summarized in

The CHMP noted that the PK analysis dataset consists of sparse samples from 191 paediatric patients. All 
relevant studies were included in the data base and raw data have been presented. The potential sources 
of variability investigated was mainly related to demographic factors: age, weight, gender and race. Renal 
function and infection type is known to affect the PK of C/T and both was tested in the paediatric models.  
The dataset spans across the full age range, albeit with few patients in the lower age ranges. Accordingly, 
there are also few patients at the lower end of the weight and renal function ranges. Only one patient 
below 2 years of age with cIAI was included in the studies. The inclusion/exclusion criteria were set to 
only include most patients with eGFR above 50 mL/min/1.73 m2. A few patients with eGFR below 50 
mL/min/1.73 m2 were included in the study (see section Special populations on Paediatric patients with 
impaired or immature renal function). The full range of renal function values expected from birth 
(term/preterm) have thus not been covered. Adjustments were made in the dosing recommendation 
during the phase 1 PK study, by simplifying the dosing to mg/kg to all patients (with cap at the adult 
dose). The limitations in the observed data impact the ability to validate the model predictions at low 
weight, low renal function and for the cIAI indication. Furthermore, a high proportion of the tazobactam 
samples were below the Limit of Quantitation (LOQ). This mostly relates to the pre-dose and the samples 
taken 6 to 7 hours after dosing, even though some additional time points are affected for a few patients. 
The samples that were below LOQ were excluded from the dataset.  
Model diagnostics 
The final models were evaluated using all diagnostic plots mentioned in the model analysis plan.  
•  Visual predictive checks (VPCs) of concentration versus time were constructed.  
o  VPCs were performed manually using R 3.6.1. Simulated data distributions were based on a 
minimum of 500 replicates. The mean and 90% prediction interval of the simulated data 
were plotted, and the observed data were overlaid together with the observed median, 5th, 
and 95th percentile. In response to the first request of supplementary information, the MAH 
also provided prediction corrected VPCs (pcVPC) as requested by CHMP. 
Assessment report  
EMA/644705/2022 
Page 21/127 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
o  To evaluate model performance across the population, VPCs and pcVPCs were stratified 
by key factors of interest, such as age group. Consistency of simulated and observed 
quantiles qualifies the model as suitable to predict concentration-time profiles.  
• 
Parameter precision for the final Population-PK model were evaluated using the standard errors 
calculated from NONMEM.  
- Ceftolozane 
The final PK model parameters of ceftolozane is given in Table 9.  
Table 9: Final pharmacokinetic model parameter estimates for Ceftolozane 
The MAH provided graphical presentations of ceftolozane and tazobactam steady-state exposure metrics 
(Ceoi and AUC) versus body weight, on a continuous scale. In addition, both ceftolozane and tazobactam 
exposure measures (Ceoi and AUC) versus age were also depicted in separate figures focused on children 
0 – 1 year of age (see section Special populations - Paediatric patients with impaired or immature renal 
function). As infection type was shown to be a covariate of ceftolozane and tazobactam PK in the models, 
separate panels for cIAI and cUTI were provided in each figure. In order to allow assessment of dosing-
adequacy for body weight and age, 2000 paediatric subjects per age category from the virtual paediatric 
population database were simulated using the paediatric population PK model of ceftolozane and 
tazobactam. The results of the simulations were illustrated graphically by superimposing the distribution 
of simulated paediatric exposure (Ceoi and AUC) values (median and 90% prediction interval) on the 
adult reference range, together with the predicted paediatric exposure (Ceoi and AUC) values for the 
individual paediatric patient using the empirical Bayes estimates (EBEs) from the final population PK 
model. 
The CHMP considered that, overall, the model diagnostics indicate that the ceftolozane population-PK 
model fit the paediatric data well. As part of the assessment, the MAH was requested by the CHMP to 
provide prediction corrected VPCs (pcVPS) to allow detecting potential misspecifications (Bergstrand et al. 
2011).  These were provided and indicated reasonable fit of the population-PK model to the paediatric 
data.  
Due to the rather sparse dataset, the MAH was also requested to discuss whether other data could be 
presented to better understand the adequacy of the dosing recommendations in the lowest age range 
(<3mo). Furthermore, the MAH was requested to present plots of observed data vs simulated to better 
understand the ceftolozane exposures at the end of the dosing interval. Additionally, graphical 
presentations of exposure metrics (Css, Cmax, Cmin) versus body weight, age and renal function on 
continuous scales for the full paediatric populations with additional separate plot focused on the children 0 
Assessment report  
EMA/644705/2022

– 1 year of age were requested. The graphical presentations of simulated exposure metrics by age and 
body weight have been provided for AUC and Ceoi. Since in smaller children there is a risk that similar 
AUC may be observable, while Cmax may be higher and Cmin lower (which may affect the PTA 
simulations), presentations with Cmax and Cmin would have been preferable. However, this was not 
further pursued, as it is not expected to further inform the conclusion on the dosing recommendations in 
the lowest age range (<3 months). AUC and Ceoi vs. weight have been provided for the whole age range, 
but a closer look at the lower weight ranges would have been preferable.  
The simulations of ceftolozane exposures in moderate and severe renal impairment submitted by the MAH 
in response to the first request for supplementary information indicated that the paediatric model for 
ceftolozane did not adequately describe the influence of renal function. The CHMP considered that a 
potential explanation for this could be that the co-variate on renal function was overfit with the observed 
paediatric data and consequently lost predictive ability on the impact of renal function (see also section 
Paediatric patients with impaired or immature renal function for assessment). Hence, in the second 
request for supplementary information further questions were posed regarding paediatric patients with 
impaired or immature renal function, especially those <2 years of age. To better understand the 
adequacy of the dosing recommendations in the lowest age range (<3 months) and in paediatric patients 
with reduced renal function and low weight, the MAH was requested to provide graphical presentations of 
observed and simulated ceftolozane exposure metrics by continuous renal function (all age ranges) and 
weight (focused on children 0 – 1 year of age, all age ranges already provided). As requested, the MAH 
provided graphical presentations of ceftolozane steady-state exposure metrics (AUC and Ceoi) versus the 
continuous measure of renal function (eGFR) for all age ranges and for 0 – 1 year-olds. See the Special 
Populations section on Paediatric patients with impaired or immature renal function for further discussion 
of dosing recommendations in this patient population. 
- Tazobactam 
The final PK model parameters of tazobactam were provided. The MAH also provided graphs of the 
observed and individual predicted versus predicted, pcVPCs. Overall, by age, by infection type, by weight 
and by eGFR. Etas versus co-variates and CWRES vs Time were also provided.  
The evaluation of the various provided parameters seemed to indicate model mis-specifications for 
tazobactam, with bias observed in both CWRES versus predicted and CWRES versus time since last dose. 
Attempts to improve the model were made by relaxing the priors on some of the thetas (CL, V), relaxing 
the omega prior, removing the random effect on V2 and testing a block structure for CL and V1 
covariance (omega), however these runs either failed to converge or lead to no improvement in model fit.  
No indications of outliers were reported. Shrinkage was reported as low, except from V2 (40.9%). No 
attempts were made to test methods for handling the BLOQ values (such as handling BLOQs as censored 
data along the lines discussed in Ahn et al. 2008) or test simplifications in model structure to account for 
the limitations in the paediatric database. Due to the low number of patients in the lower age ranges, the 
VPC plots initially provided were not well fit for evaluating the goodness of fit in these age categories.  
In response to the first request for supplementary information, the MAH provided pcVPCs for the 
tazobactam model. As well as graphical presentations of the exposure metrics AUC and Ceoi versus body 
weight and age on continuous scales for the full paediatric populations with additional separate plot 
focused on the children 0 – 1 year of age. The provided overall pcVPC indicated no major mis-
specification in the model, and overall, the additional presentations submitted indicated that the 
tazobactam population-PK model fit to the paediatric data reasonably well, also at the lower age range. 
Still the model is considered as of low credibility, particularly for the lowest age ranges (below 3 months 
for AP/cUTI and below 2 years for cIAI), and some aspects still bring uncertainties to the joint PTA

analysis. Please refer to the section on special population for the discussion of the observed tazobactam 
data.  
As for ceftolozane, to better understand the adequacy of the dosing recommendations in the lowest age 
range (<3 months) and in paediatric patients with reduced renal function and low weight, the MAH was 
requested to provide graphical presentations of observed and simulated tazobactam exposure metrics by 
continuous renal function (all age ranges) and weight (focused on children 0 – 1 year of age, all age 
ranges already provided). The requested presentations of tazobactam steady-state exposure metrics 
(AUC and Ceoi) versus the continuous measure of renal function (eGFR) for all age ranges and for the 0 – 
1 year-old were provided by the MAH.

- Study P010 – Non-compartmental analysis 
This was a Phase 1, single-dose, non-comparative, open-label trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) 
and safety of C/T in paediatric subjects from birth (7 days postnatal) to <18 years receiving concurrent 
standard-of-care antibiotic therapy for treatment of proven or suspected gram-negative infection or peri-
operative prophylaxis. In December 2017, the MAH submitted the completed paediatric study for C/T 
(P010), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006 (EMEA/H/C/003772/P46/002).  
Since the study was already assessed by CHMP, only a shorter summary is provided in this report. An 
evaluation of the results from study P010, together with results from study P034 and P035, are made in 
light of this application for extension of indications. 
Included subjects received a single age-based intravenous (IV) dose of C/T as a 60 (±10)-minute (min) 
infusion. The doses were subject to change (up to a maximum of 30 mg/kg ceftolozane and 15 mg/kg 
tazobactam, not to exceed a fixed dose of 1.5 g C/T) based upon interim analysis of PK and safety data. 
Trial design including interim analysis is shown in Figure 2.

Treatment groups and actual treatment received are shown in Table 10. Among the inclusion criteria was 
estimated renal function where Groups 1 through 4 needed CrCL ≥80 mL/min/1.73m2, Group 5 needed 
CrCL ≥50 mL/min/1.73m2 and Group 6 needed CrCL ≥20 mL/min/1.73m2. CrCL estimated in the clinical 
trials was calculated by the Bedside Schwartz equation. In addition, in Groups 1 through 5, patients with 
height or weight outside of the 5th to 95th percentile was excluded.

A summary of ceftolozane and tazobactam plasma PK parameters in Group 1-6 is presented below in 
Table 11 and in Table 12 respectively.  
Not enough data points were available for an accurate assessment of tazobactam metabolite (M1) PK 
parameters. The arithmetic mean tazobactam plasma concentration-time profiles showed an increase in 
tazobactam M1 concentrations with time, which peaked at approximately 4 hours post start of infusion of 
C/T. Thus, the terminal elimination phase was not captured within the 6-hour PK sampling time and AUC 
(0-∞) could not be determined for most subjects. Two subjects had pre-dose tazobactam M1 
concentrations.

Administration of Single IV Doses of C/T to Group 1-6 Subjects, Presented as GM and 95% CI (PK 
Population) 
The CHMP considered that the aim of the dose selection in study P010 was to achieve comparable 
exposures to those calculated for adult patients with cIAI and AP/cUTI. For ceftolozane, an AUC target of 
130-175 μg*h/mL was used, which covers the range of AUCs reported in adult healthy volunteer, in 
patients with AP/cUTI and in patients with cIAI (130, 158 and 175 μg*h/mL respectively). Hence, the 
selected exposure target for ceftolozane seems appropriate. An AUC target of 24 μg*h/mL was chosen for 
the interim analyses of tazobactam.  
The ceftolozane geometric mean AUC0-∞ ranged from 99.4 to 202 µg*h/mL across Groups 1-6. Following 
the interim analysis in Group 3, the dose was increased from 18/9 mg/kg to 30/15 mg/kg, an increase of 
1.7-fold, which resulted in an increase in the geometric mean AUC0-∞ of approximately 1.9-fold in Group 
3, suggesting that the PK of ceftolozane is approximately dose-proportional. 
The ceftolozane PK parameters were generally comparable across Groups 1-4, but the ceftolozane and 
tazobactam CL appeared to be lower in subjects aged birth to <3 months (Groups 5 and 6). Ceftolozane 
and tazobactam geometric mean Vss also trended lower with decreasing age. After accounting for weight, 
the ceftolozane geometric mean Vss and CL was comparable across most age groups with a slight trend 
in increased Vss in subjects aged birth (7 days postnatal) to <3 months (Groups 5 and 6 subjects) and a 
lower weight corrected CL in patients in Group 6 with CrCL <50 mL/min/1.73m2 (these patients received 
Assessment report

a lower dose of C/T). The MAH points out that renal function matures through infancy with clearance 
values reaching adult values around the second year of life. Thus, renal clearance of drugs, including 
those that are governed by glomerular filtration and/or tubular secretion (as in the case of ceftolozane 
and tazobactam), increases with increasing gestational age and body weight. Therefore, the lower CL 
observed in infants and neonates is likely due to their immature renal function. This was supported by the 
CHMP.  
Two subjects in Group 6 had CrCL between 20 and 49 mL/min/1.73m2. They received a dose of 12 mg/kg 
ceftolozane and 6 mg/kg tazobactam to take into account the lower CrCL in these subjects. These 
patients had a geometric mean ceftolozane AUC0-∞ of 165 µg*h/mL, with individual measures 134 and 
204 µg*h/mL). See the section Paediatric patients with impaired renal function, for further assessment of 
C/T treatment in paediatric patients with reduced renal function.  
As was pointed out previously during the assessment of procedure EMEA/H/C/003772/P46/002, CHMP 
noted that in the final analysis for Group 2, geometric mean AUCs (0-∞) were below the AUC target 
range for both ceftolozane and tazobactam. In this group, the low geometric mean tazobactam AUC could 
be explained by incomplete PK sampling in 3 patients that resulted in the AUC not being calculated for 
these patients. In contrast, the PK samples for ceftolozane were sufficient for all 6 patients in this cohort.  
- Study P034 and P035 
A total of 228 participants were enrolled and randomized across the two Phase 2 studies (134 participants 
in P034 and 94 participants in P035). In these studies, the evaluation of PK of ceftolozane and 
tazobactam was only an exploratory objective. In the two studies, the paediatric patients were divided 
into five age groups, Group 1 (12 to <18 years), Group 2 (6 to <12 years), Group 3 (2 to <6 years), 
Group 4 (3 months to <2 years) and Group 5 (birth to <3 months). The PK data generated from the 
Phase 2 studies were integrated in the population-PK modelling and PTA analysis. 
Study P034 was a Phase 2, randomized, active comparator-controlled, multicenter, double-blind study 
evaluating the safety and efficacy of ceftolozane/tazobactam (C/T) versus meropenem (MERO) in 
paediatric participants from birth (defined as >32 weeks gestational age and ≥7 days postnatal) to <18 
years of age with cUTI, including pyelonephritis.  
Study P035 was a Phase 2, randomised, active comparator-controlled, multicenter, double-blind study 
conducted in paediatric participants from birth (defined as >32 weeks gestational age and ≥7 days 
postnatal) to <18 years of age with cIAI of sufficient severity requiring hospitalisation and treatment with 
intravenous (IV) antibiotics. In study P035, one patient was enrolled in Group 4 in the C/T arm but 
discontinued before the day of PK sample collection, hence no PK data are available from patients with 
cIAI in the age range 3 months to <2 years of age. One participant was enrolled for Group 5 in the C/T 
arm with estimated steady-state ceftolozane PK parameter values: AUC0-8=173 µg*h/mL; 
Ceoi=43.4 µg/mL; and with estimated tazobactam PK parameter values: AUC0-8=69.9 µg*h/mL; 
Ceoi=30.5 µg/mL. 
See Figure 12 and Figure 13 for study design and dose regimens and sections 4.4 and 4.5 for additional 
details of the studies, endpoints and included patients. In both the Phase 2 studies (P034 and P035), 
one of the exclusion criteria was CrCL <50 mL/min/1.73 m2. 
Population-PK 
Individual model-predicted exposures 
In the population-PK model, body weight, eGFR (as a renal function estimate), and age were identified as 
significant covariates for both compounds. Infection types (cUTI and cIAI) were identified as additional 
significant covariates for ceftolozane; but not for tazobactam.

The CHMP considered that, overall, the exposure of ceftolozane in study P034 and P035 estimated by 
the population-PK model are within the defined target exposure, although some trends were observed in 
PK measures that deviated from the adult population. The exposure measures are provided in the study 
description above but are shortly summarised below. 
AP/cUTI 
The estimated exposure of both ceftolozane and tazobactam (AUC0-8 and Ceoi) in paediatric AP/cUTI 
patients trended lower (except Group 1 both ceftolozane and tazobactam which were comparable and 
Group 5 tazobactam that had elevated exposure compared to adults) compared to that in adults with 
AP/cUTI. Of particular notice are the lower Ceoi and AUC 0-8 in patients from Group 3 and 4 in study 
P034.  
The patient population in study P034 includes both cUTI and pyelonephritis of sufficient severity requiring 
hospitalisation and treatment with intravenous (IV) antibiotics. The MAH did not present any specific 
analysis to investigate potential differences in PK between the AP and cUTI patients. However, there is no 
expected difference in pharmacokinetics between cUTI and AP based on adult PK data, and it was 
considered that the paediatric PK data is representative for both cUTI and AP.  
Assessment report  
EMA/644705/2022 
Page 30/127 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cIAI 
The estimated AUC0-8 of both ceftolozane and tazobactam in paediatric patients with cIAI also trended 
lower compared to adults with cIAI. While ceftolozane Ceoi was comparable to adult values, tazobactam 
values trended higher in paediatric patients.  
AP/cUTI and cIAI 
Although some trends were observed in the steady-state ceftolozane and tazobactam plasma PK 
parameter values estimated by population-PK modelling, the presented data are still within the range of 
observations in the adult participants with AP/cUTI and cIAI. Of note, there are few patients included in 
each age group, especially in the lower age groups which brings uncertainties to the estimates. Still, the 
provided data are considered sufficient in support of extension of indication to the paediatric AP/cUTI 
patients and cIAI patients ≥2 years.  
The graphical presentations provided in response to the request by the CHMP shows simulated 
ceftolozane exposures (AUC and Ceoi) mainly within the range observed for adult patients, slightly lower 
AUC for AP/cUTI patients between 6 months and 1 year. Similarly, the simulations of the tazobactam 
exposures (AUC and Ceoi) are mainly within the range observed for adult patients, but the Ceoi seems to 
be higher in the youngest patients with cIAI. Of importance, there only exists PK data from one single 
patient <1 year with cIAI, consequently the provided simulations need to be interpreted with caution. 
Extrapolation of PK to paediatric patients <2 years of age with cIAI  
Despite the lack of PK data from paediatric patients <2 years of age, the MAH argued that the proposed 
dosing regimens can be extended to these age groups in cIAI based on extrapolation from modelling and 
simulations. The MAH did not provide a thorough discussion concerning the scientific rationale for 
extrapolating PK from the AP/cUTI population <2 years of age to the cIAI population <2 years of age. 
According to the Addendum to the guideline on the evaluation of medicinal products indicated for 
treatment of bacterial infections to address paediatric-specific clinical data requirements 
(EMA/CHMP/187859/2017), it may not be necessary to obtain pharmacokinetic data from all age 
subgroups in which use is to be proposed. In some circumstances, modelling and simulation of adult data 
may be sufficient to support dosing recommendations for certain age subgroups (e.g., adolescent 
subjects). On the other hand, pharmacokinetic data will need to be generated in neonates in almost all 
cases owing to the rapid developmental changes in absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. 
Furthermore, according to the Guideline on the role of pharmacokinetics in the development of medicinal 
products in the paediatric population (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/147013/2004), pharmacokinetic information from 
one indication can be extrapolated to another indication if it can be assumed that the diseases and 
commonly used concomitant medications are not affecting the pharmacokinetics of the drug. In the 
submitted population-PK model, body weight, renal function (eGFR) and age were identified as significant 
covariates for ceftolozane and tazobactam, while infection types (cUTI, cIAI and NP) were identified as 
significant covariates for ceftolozane, but not for tazobactam. Of note, the expected difference in 
exposure between the two infection types are not large and does not lead to adjustments in the dosing 
regimen for adults or children. 
The single patient <3 months of age with cIAI had estimated exposures of ceftolozane comparable to the 
patients <3 months of age with AP/cUTI in study P034, while the estimated tazobactam exposures was 
higher. Of importance, this is an estimated/predicted measure from one single cIAI patient, the 
tazobactam exposure distribution in the AP/cUTI patients <3 months of age are wide, and the exposure 
measures from the patient with cIAI <3 months of age is only slightly higher than the highest estimated 
values in the AP/cUTI population (69.9 µg*h/mL vs. ~65 µg*h/mL). The observed concentration 
measurements (Ceoi) in the single patient <3 months of age is comparable with the range of observations 
collected from AP/cUTI patients <3 months of age (cIAI; 29.8 (ceftolozane) and 7.12 (tazobactam), 
Assessment report

AP/cUTI; 23.7-70.4 (ceftolozane) and 4.13-21.5 (tazobactam)). The single patient <3 months of age in 
study P035 had estimated ceftolozane AUC higher than the estimated geometric mean AUC in older 
paediatric cIAI patients (≥2 years) and adults, while Ceoi was comparable. The estimated exposure of 
tazobactam in the single patient <3 months of age was approximately twice the estimated geometric 
mean exposure observed in older children and adults with cIAI. Still, the estimated measures of AUC and 
Ceoi for the patient <3 months of age with cIAI were within the range of values observed in adults with 
cIAI. As discussed in the section model qualification, the credibility of the tazobactam model is low, 
particularly for the lowest age ranges (<3 months for AP/cUTI and <2 years for cIAI). The model 
overpredicts the tazobactam exposures, most prominently at the end of the dosing interval. Even so, 
considering the target of fraction of time above 1mg/mL at 20%, the observed exposure data indicate 
that patients are above this limit. Due to the limited PK data available, it is difficult to draw any clear 
conclusions on the comparison between the cIAI and AP/cUTI populations <3 months of age.  
Based on the totality of the data presented, although very limited, the CHMP supported that the proposed 
dosing regimens can be extended to the age groups <2 years with cIAI based on extrapolation from the 
modelling and simulations.  
NP (Nosocomial Pneumonia) 
It was noticed that the MAH provided a report on modelling and simulation concerning dose selection in 
paediatric NP patients (including HAP/VAP) in the submitted dossier. The analyses described in the report 
focuses on population-PK modelling for C/T in paediatric patients with confirmed or suspected gram-
negative infections enrolled in Study CXA-PEDS-13-08 (P010) and simulations to support dose selection 
for evaluation in paediatric patients with NP. The NP population PK model have not been further assessed 
as the NP indication is not part of this application. Of note, the approved dose for the NP indication in the 
adult population is twice that of cIAI and AP/cUTI. According to the paediatric investigational plan (EMA-
001142-PIP02), a study investigating PK, tolerability, and safety of C/T in children from birth to <18 
years of age with NP is to be completed by July 2023.

Paediatric patients with impaired or immature renal function 
In adult AP/cUTI and cIAI patients, ceftolozane  dose  normalized  geometric  mean  AUC  increased  up  to 
1.26-fold,  2.5-fold and 5-fold in subjects with CrCL 51-80 mL/min, 30-50mL/min, and 15- 29 mL/min, 
respectively, compared to healthy subjects with normal renal function. The respective tazobactam dose 
normalized geometric mean AUC increased approximately up to 1.3-fold, 2-fold, and 4-fold. Dosage 
adjustment is required to maintain similar systemic ceftolozane and tazobactam exposures to those with 
normal renal function.   
Published data suggest that renal function, including glomerular filtration rate and tubular secretion, 
matures with child growth(Zhang et al. 2019). In paediatric AP/cUTI and cIAI patients, maturation of 
renal function and increase in kidney size with child growth affect the PK of ceftolozane and tazobactam. 
According to the covariate analysis, both eGFR and maturation factors were found to affect ceftolozane 
and tazobactam PK. According to the MAH, there is no clinical experience in paediatric patients with eGFR 
<50 mL/min/1.73 m2 to inform dose adjustment recommendation. 
Two patients with CrCL <50 mL/min/1.73 m2 (27.69 mL/min/1.73m2 and 34.12 mL/min/1.73m2) were 
included in the Phase 1 study (P010), they were dosed 12mg/kg and 8mg/kg C/T and had a geometric 
mean AUC0-∞ of 165 µg*h/mL (with individual measures 134 and 204 µg*h/mL). In study P035, one 
patient in the age range 12 to <18 years with CrCL in the range of ≥30 to <50 mL/min/1.73m2 was 
included. According to the MAH, the patient was dosed 1.5 g C/T, and had ceftolozane AUC of 129 
µg*h/mL and Cmax of 57.7 µg/mL, tazobactam AUC of 27.2 µg*h/mL and Cmax of 14.5 µg/mL (estimated

using the population PK models). A summary of eGFR for paediatric patients less than/equal to 2 years 
old and greater than 2 years old is shown in Table 15.

- Paediatric patients from 2 years of age with impaired renal function 
No dosing recommendations was provided in the submitted dossier for paediatric patients with impaired 
renal function, despite the renal elimination pathways for both ceftolozane and tazobactam. On request 
from the CHMP, the MAH conducted additional simulations using the submitted population PK models of 
ceftolozane and tazobactam to include additional recommended dose adjustments in paediatric patients 
with moderate and severe renal impairment. As the influence of renal maturation function on ceftolozane 
and tazobactam PK is expected to be small for paediatric population older than 2 years of age, it was 
considered feasible to use modelling-based extrapolation to propose dosing regimen for paediatric 
patients older than 2 years of age with renal impairment, if assuming that the renal impairment 
categorization in adult patients applies.  
The CHMP raised questions in relation to the proposed dosing regimens proposed for paediatric patients 2 
years and older. The Committee noticed that the submitted simulations of ceftolozane exposures in 
moderate and severe renal impairment indicated that the paediatric model for ceftolozane did not 
adequately describe the influence of renal function. Based on the CHMP remarks, the MAH conducted a 
thorough review of the submitted population pharmacokinetic (PK) model(s) (Ref. 5.3.5.3: 082HY8), 
including covariate selection as summarized in the appendix 2 assessment of the applicant’s 2nd response 
to request for supplementary information. The underlying demographics across the paediatric population 
were evaluated and compared to adults (described by separate population PK models) and guided model 
assessments. As a result, alternative models were explored with re-evaluations of exposure metrics and 
probability of target attainment (PTA) from the selected models conducted.  
In general, and consistently with the CHMP’s observations, the MAH confirmed that the current 
ceftolozane model appears to be over-parameterized where any ability to resolve an effect of eGFR is 
limited. In contrast to the adult datasets, a very limited fraction (≤ 5%) of paediatric patients over 2 
years of age had an eGFR ≤ 90 mL/min/1.73m2 and could not support the estimation of a meaningful 
relationship between ceftolozane and eGFR; this also applies to tazobactam. This results in a discrepancy 
between the exponents of the eGFR power model estimated in the paediatric (0.11) and adult (0.704) 
models. Based upon further model evaluation, only the effects of weight (fixed allometric scaling 
exponents of 0.75 for CL and intercompartmental clearance (Q) and 1.0 for central volume (Vc) and 
peripheral volume (Vp)) and a function describing renal maturation in paediatric patients ≤ 2 years as 
described in [Rhodin et al. 2009] appeared to be meaningful and identifiable on CL (ceftolozane and

tazobactam). The effect of eGFR on CL had no or minimal impact on the fit or predictive performance of 
the models and were removed in reduced models explored in this response. 
The proposed dosing adjustments in paediatric patients with moderate and severe renal impairment were 
informed by the negligible/minimal effects of eGFR in the paediatric model resulting in discordance 
between existing dose adjustments (for moderate and severe renal impairment) in adults. The submitted 
model and the reduced (refined) models explored in response to the CHMP questions continue to support 
dosing recommendations proposed in the SmPC in paediatric patients with normal renal function and mild 
renal impairment (eGFR > 50 mL/min/1.73m2), with estimates of exposure metrics (AUC and Ceoi) and 
PTA largely similar across models and no evidence of a systematic bias. As adequate characterization of 
ceftolozane (and tazobactam) remains credible in paediatric patients with an eGFR > 50 mL/min/1.73 
m2, the MAH suggested that no formal update to the current paediatric models (ceftolozane and 
tazobactam) are necessary at this time. Nor would a model update address the absence of an effect of 
eGFR applicable to a paediatric population, based upon the current PK data, to inform posology in 
moderate or severe renal impairment. 
According to the MAH, additional data in paediatric patients with nosocomial pneumonia (NP) are 
expected from an ongoing study (MK-7625A-036) with inclusion of patients from birth to < 3 months of 
age with an eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 and where additional experience in older children with an eGFR 
between 50 to 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 may be available to inform any effect of eGFR on ceftolozane (and 
tazobactam) clearance. Together with application and/or integration of existing adult data, including 
varying degrees of renal impairment, this is expected to mitigate the current limitations of the PK model 
and potentially support dosing recommendations in moderate and severe renal impairment in paediatric 
patients as described in Study #3 from EMEA-00114-PIP02-16. 
The MAH also stated that the full range of renal function values expected from birth (term/preterm) have 
not been covered in the analysis datasets due to exclusion of patients with eGFR ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 
from the clinical studies. This prevented the identification of any effect of renal function on PK variability 
beyond renal maturation and limited the predictive capabilities of the selected model in the setting of 
renal impairment or immaturity. Although dosing recommendations in patients with moderate and severe 
renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73m2) may be desirable, the MAH argued that, consistently with 
the initial submission of the paediatric extension of indication variation, no dosing recommendations in 
these subgroups regardless of age could be supported at this time and therefore the initially proposed 
SmPC dose adjustments for paediatric patients with moderate and severe renal impairment in the 
response to request for supplementary information were withdrawn by the MAH. However, dosing 
recommendations in paediatric patients, from birth to < 18 years of age, with an eGFR > 50 mL/min/1.73 
m2, is supported, as per Section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
- Paediatric patients <2 years of age with impaired or immature renal function 
While the population PK models were developed based on ceftolozane and tazobactam plasma 
concentration data collected in the paediatric studies, the covariate relationships with regard to eGFR in 
the models and its interplay with renal maturation function cannot be validated for children younger than 
2 years of age with eGFR ≤50 mL/min/1.73 m2, as patients in this category were excluded in the trials 
and thus no PK data are available. Furthermore, there were no adults with moderate or severe renal 
impairment (CrCL ≤50 mL/min) in the global Phase 3 cIAI/cUTI trials, no observed data in this category 
were available to compare with simulations based on eGFR. Thus, the MAH did not consider it appropriate 
to propose a dosing regimen based on extrapolation with modeling and simulation alone for children 
younger than 2 years of age with eGFR ≤50 mL/min/1.73 m2.

With regards to the suitability of the posology with a cut-off based on eGFR, the CHMP requested the MAH 
to discuss possible alternatives to the proposed posology including if the youngest paediatric patients 
should be recommended a lower dose based on age rather than estimated kidney function due to their 
immature kidney function and the known challenges in estimating kidney function in newborns. The MAH 
agreed in their response that renal function in newborns is affected by both gestational age as well as 
post-natal age with rapid increases seen in the first few post-natal weeks. Due to renal immaturity at 
birth the expected eGFR in the term newborn in the first week of life is expected to be 
~20mL/min/1.73m2 increasing to ~40-60 mL/min/1.73m2 in the 2-4 weeks of life. While the MAH agreed 
that the proposed eGFR cutoff of ≤50 mL/min/1.73 m2 may exclude a portion of neonates including 
preterm neonates from receiving ceftolozane/tazobactam, there will be a substantial proportion of 
neonates, especially term neonates older than 2 weeks post-natal that will have an eGFR >50 
mL/min/1.73 m2. This is supported by the fact that in P010 and P034 combined there were 5 neonatal 
participants (≤28 days old, range 13-28) all of whom had eGFR >50 mL/min/1.73m2 (range 56.0-90.5). 
- General Suitability of the posology with a cut-off based on eGFR 
The CHMP also noted that the MAH did not initially establish dose recommendations in paediatric patients 
below 18 years of age with eGFR ≤ 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 based on the argument that there is no clinical 
experience in paediatric patients with CrCL <50 mL/min/1.73 m2. Exclusion criteria in study P034 and 
P035 were moderate or severe impairment of renal function, defined as an estimated CrCL <50 
mL/min/1.73 m2 based on the Bedside Schwartz equation or requirement for peritoneal dialysis, 
hemodialysis, or hemofiltration. Considering that both ceftolozane and tazobactam are renally excreted, 
dosing recommendations in renal impairment is generally required.  
Low GFR is expected in new-born: children born at term is expected to have GFR of approximately 10-20 
mL/min/1.73m2 the first day of life, there after rising up to approximately 30-40 mL/min/1.73m2 after 
two weeks, reaching adult levels first at two years of age. In preterm neonates, the expected GFR is even 
lower than in children born at term and rises more slowly than in children born at term. Hence, this cutoff 
will most likely exclude a large proportion of the youngest patients born at term and possibly all the 
youngest preterm patients from treatment with C/T. Further, the estimation of GFR in paediatric patients 
is challenging, and the proposed posology with a cutoff based on CrCL/eGFR might not be well-suited for 
clinical practice. In the first request for supplementary information, the MAH was asked to discuss 
possible alternatives to the proposed posology including if the youngest paediatric patients should be 
recommended a lower dose based on age rather than estimated kidney function due to their immature 
renal function and the known challenges in estimating renal function in newborns. The MAH did provide a 
discussion for not changing the proposed posology; instead, they only recommended a dose regimen in 
children below 2 years of age with eGFR >50 mL/min/1.73 m2, and did not consider it appropriate to 
recommend a dosing regimen based on extrapolation with modelling and simulation alone for children 
younger than 2 years of age with eGFR ≤50 mL/min/1.73 m2. Further to CHMP concerns that the 
proposed posology, only with a cut-off based on CrCL/eGFR, would not be well-suited for clinical practice 
since the estimation of GFR in paediatric patients is challenging, additional data regarding the above 
mentioned eGFR cut-off was requested. 
The Committee agreed with the MAH that clinical experience in paediatric patients <18 years of age with 
eGFR ≤ 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 is limited, however some data was collected in paediatric patients with 
reduced renal function. The MAH was therefore requested to provide an overview of the available data 
from patients with CrCL <50 mL/min/1.73 m2, including information of actual doses received. In response 
to the first request for supplementary information, the MAH provided data from one 12 year-old patient, 
in study P035, that had CrCL <50 mL/min/1.73 m2 (baseline eGFR 46.2 mL/min/1.73 m2). The patient 
received the dose recommended for paediatric patients with CrCL/eGFR >50 mL/min/1.73 m2, 1 g

ceftolozane and 0.5 g tazobactam q8h. Ceftolozane AUC were approximately within the ceftolozane AUC 
target of 130 to 175 μg*h/mL, and tazobactam were in accordance tazobactam AUC seen in the cIAI 
population 12 to <18 years. The two paediatric patients <3 months of age in study P010 with CrCL <50 
mL/min/1.73 m2, received a lower dose to account for immature renal function and reduced CL of C/T; 
the two subjects had eGFR of 27.69 and 34.12 mL/min/1.73m2. They received half the dose, 12mg/kg 
and 8mg/kg C/T and had AUCs of 134 and 204 µg*h/mL, which is close to the target range, and within 
range observed in the population studied in P010. One of the two patients had especially high AUC 
measures of tazobactam, in the two subjects the AUC0-∞ was 37.5 and 161 µg*h/mL, while AUC0-last 
was 10.2 and 45.9 µg*h/mL. Concerning Cmax the values were 3.17 and 14.9 µg/mL, which is slightly 
lower or similar to the rest of the studied population in P010. On request from the CHMP, the MAH 
provided summaries of eGFR for paediatric patients ≤2 years of age and >2 years of age.   
- Paediatric patients from 2 years with impaired renal function 
The MAH provided dosing recommendations for paediatric patients with impaired renal function. Very 
limited C/T PK data are available for paediatric patients with moderate to severe renal impairment, only 
two patients with moderate renal impairment (whereas one of them with immature renal function) and 
one patient with severe renal impairment (neonate with immature renal function). Consequently, the 
proposed dosing recommendations in moderate and severe renal impairment were primarily based on 
adult PK data. Although not a validated assumption, it is considered reasonable to expect a similar 
relationship between eGFR/CrCL and C/T clearance in children (aged 2 years and older) and adults when 
accounting for body weight.  
The dosing regimen proposed by the MAH involved a 25% reduction of dose in moderate renal 
impairment (eGFR 30-50 mL/min/m2) and 40% reduction in severe renal impairment (eGFR 15-29 
mL/min/m2) for patients 2 to <18 years, which is not comparable to the corresponding dosing 
recommendation in adults where the dose is reduced by 50% in moderate renal impairment and 75% in 
severe renal impairment. Consequently, during the second request for supplementary information, the 
MAH was also requested to discuss the proposed paediatric dosing recommendations in paediatric 
patients with impaired renal function in the age range 2 to <18 years in the light of the knowledge 
established in the adult population with impaired renal function. The discrepancy between the adult and 
paediatric dosing recommendations with renal impairment added to the concern regarding the adequacy 
of the population PK model.  
Simulations of exposures and PTA analysis was provided for patients aged 2 to <18 years with both 
moderate and severe renal impairment. The simulated plots provided by the MAH indicated that the co-
variate for renal function had a very low impact on the exposures of ceftolozane; the predicted exposures 
were very similar for severe and moderately reduced renal function. Further the predicted exposure of 
non-adjusted doses of ceftolozane was within the adult range with normal dose, whereas the reduced 
dose to account for reduced renal function led to predicted exposure levels much below the adult levels 
for both moderate and severe renal function. The predictions for tazobactam, showed an impact of the 
co-variate for renal function; the predicted exposures are higher for severe as compared to moderate 
renal function and the exposures are higher than the adult’s exposure levels at normal dose.  
The MAH’s proposal for adjusted dosing recommendation in moderate/severe renal impairment were 
believed to be based on tazobactam exposures alone and the aspect that the PTA simulations even at a 
quite low exposure level of ceftolozane seemed adequate. The MAH did not discuss these aspects. As the 
impact of renal function on the PK of ceftolozane and tazobactam has been shown to be very similar in 
the adult data, this indicated that the paediatric model for ceftolozane did not adequately describe the 
influence of renal function (with the low value of the parameter estimate for the eGFR power model of 
Assessment report  
EMA/644705/2022 
Page 36/127 
 
 
 
 
 
 
0.11, it would appear that the predicted influence of renal impairment is too low). As a Bayesian 
modelling approach was taken; adjusting adult priors on the co-variate parameters combined with a 
paediatric dataset with very limited range of observed data on renal function, there is a risk that the co-
variate on renal function was overfit with the observed paediatric data and consequently lost predictive 
ability on the impact of renal function. In addition, the equation for clearance included body weight based 
allometric scaling, GFR power function and Rhodin maturation and these will all be highly correlated. The 
MAH was therefore requested to discuss the qualification of the ceftolozane model for predicting renal 
function and suggest steps to take to mitigate the issue and ensure that the model is credible and further 
to discuss the adequacy of including allometric scaling, the Rhodin maturation as well as a GFR power 
function on clearance.  
As requested by the CHMP, the MAH rediscussed the proposed paediatric dosing recommendations in 
paediatric patients aged 2 to <18 years of age with renal impairment in the light of the knowledge 
established in the adult population with impaired renal function and conducted an additional review of the 
submitted population pharmacokinetic (PK) model. In addition, the demographics across the underlying 
paediatric population were evaluated and compared to adults. Based on the additional review, the MAH 
confirmed that the population PK model submitted was not informative concerning renal function and 
withdrew the previously proposed dosing recommendations in paediatric patients >2 years of age with 
impaired renal function.  
- Paediatric patients <2 years of age with impaired or immature renal function 
After additional investigation and refinements of the submitted population PK model, it was clear that the 
model is not considered suitable for predicting dosing recommendations for paediatric patients <2 years 
of age with immature or impaired renal function. Considering the limitations in the data and the lack of a 
reliable population PK model, no dosing recommendations can be provided for paediatric patients <2 
years of age with reduced (moderate or severe) renal function at this time. Furthermore, it is 
acknowledged that no alternative to the currently proposed dosing recommendations can be provided for 
neonates with immature renal function and, consequently, alternatives to the proposed posology 
attempting to avoid the need for determination of eGFR in new-borns is not feasible at this time. A large 
proportion of the youngest patients born at term and possibly all the youngest preterm patients will not 
therefore be covered by this approach. The MAH confirmed that in the ongoing study MK-7625A-036, 
data are expected to emerge from patients from birth to <3 months of age with an eGFR ≥ 20 
mL/min/1.73 m2 and that additional experience in older children with an eGFR between 50 to 90 
mL/min/1.73 m2 may be available to inform any effect of eGFR on ceftolozane and tazobactam. The 
CHMP decided not to request more information at this stage. However, when the data in paediatric 
patient with reduced renal function are available it is expected that an application be submitted for a 
variation to include in sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC (and other sections as relevant) dosing 
recommendations to paediatric patients with AP/cUTI or cIAI with immature or impaired renal function, if 
supported by the data. When submitting this future variation, the MAH is recommended to present full 
results of updated/relevant population PK model(s). 
In the SmPC “from birth” is now defined as >32 weeks gestational age and ≥7 days postnatal, in both 
Sections 4.2 and 5.1, reflecting the population actually studied.
Assessment report  
EMA/644705/2022

In summary, the above issues were not further pursued at this time. The MAH is recommended to submit 
a variation application to support dosing recommendation in paediatric patients with reduced renal 
function as described above.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vivo data for Zerbaxa evaluated in previous procedures indicates that both ceftolozane and tazobactam 
are eliminated predominantly via renal excretion and are not substrates of CYPs. Thus, clinically relevant 
DDIs with inhibitors or inducers of CYPs are not expected. Ceftolozane and tazobactam were not 
substrates for P-gp or BCRP, and tazobactam is not a substrate for OCT2. Tazobactam is a known 
substrate for OAT1 and OAT3. Coadministration of tazobactam with the OAT1/OAT3 inhibitor probenecid, 
has been shown to prolong the tazobactam t1/2 by 71%. Coadministration of C/T with drugs that inhibit 
OAT1 and/or OAT3 may increase tazobactam plasma concentrations. 
Based on in vitro data, and a clinical study in adults (P030), C/T is unlikely to perpetrate DDIs related to 
CYPs or membrane drug transporters. 
According to the MAH, the low DDI risk profile based on in vitro studies and clinical data in adults can be 
extended to paediatric population based on the paediatric exposure distribution and safety profile. 
The CHMP noted that no new DDI studies were provided in support of this application. Data from previous 
procedures indicate a low risk of DDIs during C/T treatment, and it is reasonable that the low DDI 
potential observed in adults can be extended to the paediatric population. In the two paediatric Phase 2 
studies (P034 and P035) submitted for the current application based on the low risk of DDIs related with 
C/T, no further assessment of concomitant treatment in the two clinical studies (P034 and P035) have 
been made. 
4.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
The microbiology profile of C/T was extensively described in the original MAA and is reflected in the 
approved prescribing information for Zerbaxa.  
C/T is a β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination with activity against P. aeruginosa, including drug-
resistant strains, and other common gram-negative pathogens. Ceftolozane belongs to the cephalosporin 
class of antibacterial drugs but is less susceptible to hydrolysis by AmpC β-lactamases than other 
antibiotics in this class. The combination of ceftolozane with β-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam, which is a 
potent inhibitor of most class A and some class C β-lactamases, improves the coverage of ceftolozane to 
include ESBL-producing Enterobacterales.  
The spectrum of activity for ceftolozane includes many clinically relevant gram-negative respiratory 
pathogens, including Enterobacterales such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae as well as 
Pseudomenas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae.  
Susceptibility testing 
Broth microdilution susceptibility testing of C/T was performed following Clinical and Laboratory 
Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution methodology with a fixed 4-μg/mL concentration of 
tazobactam and increasing doubling dilutions of ceftolozane.

- Baseline Pathogens 
In study P034, 95 participants (C/T + MERO) were included in the mMITT population. The most common 
baseline qualifying gram-negative uropathogens were E. coli (74.6%), Klebsiella pneumonia (8.5%), and 
P. aeruginosa (7.0%). Among the 88 participants with Enterobacterales, 4 (3 in the C/T and 1 in the 
MERO treatment arms) were ESBL-positive. All 4 of the ESBL-positive isolates were E. coli. P. aeruginosa 
was isolated from 7 (7.4%) participants. AmpC-overexpression was not detected in any participants with 
P. aeruginosa. 
In study P035, 91 participants (C/T+MTZ and MERO) were included in the MITT population. The most 
common gram-negative pathogens were E. coli (67.1%), P. aeruginosa (27.1%), and Bacteroides fragilis 
(18.6%). Among all 60 participants with Enterobacterales, 9 (15%) were ESBL-positive. P. aeruginosa 
was isolated from 25 (27.5%) participants and was the second most prevalent pathogen. AmpC-
overexpression was detected in 1 (4%) of the participants with P. aeruginosa.  
- MIC frequency distributions of P034 and P035 isolates compared to surveillance isolates 
Global surveillance of C/T in vitro activity against P. aeruginosa and Enterobacterales was conducted by 
IHMA Laboratories through SMART in the United States and Europe. During studies, P034 and P035, all 
aerobic and anaerobic pathogens were tested at a central laboratory, JMI Laboratories (North Liberty, 
Iowa United States). At JMI Laboratories, each isolate was identified, and susceptibility testing was 
performed by broth microdilution according to CLSI M07 (2018) guidelines. 
The CHMP acknowledged that C/T appears to demonstrate potent in vitro activity against 
Enterobacterales and P. aeruginosa isolates collected globally from paediatric patients (2017-2019), 
regardless of infection site. The overall distribution of C/T MICs among the P. aeruginosa clinical trial 
isolates from study P034 and P035 was similar to that of the surveillance study isolates in both the US 
and EU. The Enterobacterales modal C/T MIC from the surveillance studies seems to be somewhat higher 
than what is found in the clinical studies. Since this is an application where efficacy data mainly are

extrapolated from adult data to paediatric patients, the surveillance data and MIC distributions is 
considered more of a descriptive part of the application and was not further assessed. 
- PK/PD indices and targets from non-clinical data 
No new pharmacodynamics or PK/PD studies were performed to support the paediatric indication in cUTI 
(including pyelonephritis), or cIAI. The pharmacodynamics or PK/PD studies conducted previously was 
summarized in the original marketing application for adult patients with AP/cUTI and cIAI and the 
supplemental marketing application for adult patients with HAP/VAP. Data from neutropenic thigh 
infection models in mice that supports the PK/PD indices and target values for ceftolozane and 
tazobactam are summarized below. 
The ceftolozane PK/PD index that correlated with in vivo ceftolozane efficacy is time above MIC as a 
fraction of the dosing interval that plasma concentrations remain above the minimum inhibitory 
concentration (%T>MIC). The mean (median) %T>MIC across the 8 P. aeruginosa and Enterobacterales 
strains based on total drug concentration associated with bacteriostasis and 1-log kill were 25.2 (24.8) 
and 31.5 (32.2), respectively. As ceftolozane plasma protein binding in mice is <10% and as no notable 
impact of serum on MIC was observed in in vitro studies, no conversion to free fraction was applied to 
these PK/PD targets. Based on these results, the %fT>MIC of 30% was selected as the ceftolozane PK/PD 
target for probability of target attainment (PTA) analysis. 
Based on data from neutropenic mouse thigh infection models, the PK/PD index of tazobactam that 
correlated with efficacy is time as a fraction of the dosing interval that free plasma concentrations remain 
above a threshold concentration of 1 µg/mL (%fT>CT). In this study, 6 bacterial strains (2 K. 
pneumoniae and 4 E. coli) were used to infect mice. Infected mice were treated with ceftolozane doses 
that achieved the ceftolozane PK/PD target of 30% fT>MIC, in conjunction with different tazobactam q2h 
dosing regimens in order to determine the PK/PD target value of tazobactam. 
The CHMP noted that no new in vitro studies had been submitted. There are no expected differences in 
the mechanism of action of C/T based on age as the Gram-negative causative pathogens are similar in 
adults and children. Joint PK/PD targets in line with the PK/PD targets used to assess PTA in adults with 
AP/cUTI, cIAI and HAP/VAP, have been used (30% fT>MIC for ceftolozane and 20 %fT> 1 µg/mL for 
tazobactam), which is acceptable.  
4.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
The population-PK model was used to generate individual model-predicted exposures in paediatric 
subjects with AP/cUTI and cIAI and to simulate PTA at the targets and MIC breakpoints for the pathogens 
of interest. 
- Selection of Phase 2 dose 
The C/T dosage regimens evaluated in the paediatric Phase 2 studies were selected based on the criteria 
that the projected distributions of ceftolozane and tazobactam plasma exposures (AUC and Ceoi) in 
paediatric patients would not exceed those in adult AP/cUTI and cIAI patients and that the projected 
ceftolozane PTA of achieving at least 30% fT>MIC = 4 µg/mL would be ≥90%. 
- Simulation of exposure and PTA analyses following Phase 2 studies 
The final paediatric ceftolozane and tazobactam population-PK models were used in Monte Carlo 
simulations to assess plasma joint ceftolozane and tazobactam PTA at the dosing regimens evaluated in 
P034 and P035.

infusion 
•  Children from birth to <12 years, 30 mg/kg C/T (20 mg/kg ceftolozane / 10 mg/kg tazobactam) 
q8h by 1-hour IV infusion 
Additional simulations were conducted to assess joint ceftolozane and tazobactam PTA at simplified 
dosing regimens using a weight cut-off of 50 kg: 
•  Children ≥50 kg, 1.5 g C/T (1 g ceftolozane/0.5 g tazobactam) q8h by 1-hour IV infusion 
•  Children <50 kg, 30 mg/kg C/T (20 mg/kg ceftolozane / 10 mg/kg tazobactam) q8h by 1-hour IV 
infusion 
As infection types were identified as significant covariates of ceftolozane PK, separate PTA assessments 
were conducted for AP/cUTI and cIAI.  
In the PTA assessments, 2000 paediatric subjects for each of the 5 age groups (12 to <18 years; 6 to 
<12 years; 2 to <6 years; 3 months to <2 years; birth to <3 months) were randomly sampled from two 
virtual paediatric population databases. The first paediatric database included virtual paediatric patients 
for children ≥3 months. This virtual population database (n = 100,000, with 25,000 per group for groups 
1 to 4) was constructed using the variance-covariance relationship among age, body weight, height, and 
eGFR from paediatric participants in trials in antibacterial and antifungal programs conducted by the MAH. 
For children 0 to <3 months, a second virtual population database (n = 2400) was constructed using 
available data for body weight and height distributions by sex and age subgroup from the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention data tables, and the distributions for eGFR based on age derived from 
Schwartz et al. 2007 and Heilbron et al. 1991. For this group, a lower bound of eGFR (20 mL/min/1.73 
m2) was used to be consistent with the physiological limit. These two databases of virtual patients were 
combined and sampled (n=2000 per group) to create the simulated population for PTA simulations. 
The %fT>MIC of 30% for ceftolozane and 20% fT>CT of 1µg/mL for tazobactam were selected as the 
PK/PD targets for the joint PTA analyses. In the paediatric AP/cUTI and cIAI population receiving the 
proposed simplified dosing regimen, the C/T joint PTA was >94% over the MIC range of 0.015 to 4 µg/mL 
and >85% at 8 µg/mL across all age groups. While, in the paediatric AP/cUTI and cIAI population 
receiving the clinically evaluated dosing regimen, the C/T joint PTA was >93% over the MIC range of 
0.015 to 4 µg/mL and >85% at 8 µg/mL across all age groups. According to the MAH, the data support 
that participants infected with P. aeruginosa (MIC ≤4 µg/mL) or Enterobacterales (MIC ≤2 µg/mL) can be 
adequately treated with the proposed C/T dosing regimens. 
A tabular summary of the simulated Day 1 joint C/T plasma PTA in paediatric AP/cUTI and cIAI patients 
at the proposed dose is presented in Table 18 and Table 19, respectively. In Figure 3 and Figure 4, 
steady-state joint C/T plasma PTA in paediatric patients with AP/cUTI and cIAI across age groups, are 
shown. The joint PTA curves are overlaid on a histogram illustrating the 2017 – 2019 surveillance data 
from the US and the EU, and the MIC distribution for P. aeruginosa isolates and Enterobacterales isolates 
from P034 (Figure 3) and P035 (Figure 4).  
Based on the MIC distributions from the surveillance studies, 95% (US), and 93% (EU) of P. aeruginosa 
isolates have C/T MIC ≤4 µg/mL and 97.5% (US), and 87.6% (EU) of Enterobacterales isolates have C/T 
MIC ≤2 µg/mL. Therefore, according to the MAH, the totality of the data suggests that >90% or greater 
of P. aeruginosa clinical isolates and ~90% or greater of Enterobacterales clinical isolates could be 
adequately treated at the recommended clinical C/T doses.

- Simulation of exposure and PTA analyses for paediatric patients with renal impairment

The population-PK models of ceftolozane and tazobactam, which were used to inform the dose and dosing 
strategy for paediatric AP/cUTI and cIAI patients, were used to perform additional simulations for dosing 
recommendation in paediatric patients with renal impairment category (moderate and severe), on request 
from the CHMP. Various scenarios of adjustment of dosing regimens for moderate and severe renal 
impairment were explored using modelling and simulation to select the optimal regimens to meet the 
criteria outlined in Table 20.  
Table 20: Scenarios of Dose Adjustment for Paediatric cUTI and cIAI Patients with Moderate and Severe 
Renal Impairment.  
Further to additional questions by the CHMP, the MAH withdrew the proposals for dosing 
recommendations in paediatric patients aged 2 to <18 years of age with moderate or severe renal 
impairment (see section Special populations – Paediatric patients with impaired or immature renal 
function). 
The CHMP considered that the C/T dosage regimens evaluated in the paediatric Phase 2 studies were 
selected based on the criteria that ceftolozane and tazobactam plasma exposures (AUC and Ceoi) in 
paediatric patients would not exceed those in adult AP/cUTI and cIAI patients, and that the projected C/T 
joint PTA would be ≥90%. Even though the exposure of ceftolozane and tazobactam trended lower in 
some age groups compared to that observed in adults, all paediatric subgroups achieved acceptable PTAs 
of ≥94% over the MIC range of 0.015 to 4 µg/mL at the proposed dosing recommendations using the 
same joint PK/PD targets as employed in the original MAA for adult cIAI and AP/cUTI indications. The 
MAH also assessed the joint C/T PTA at the dosing regimens evaluated in P034 and P035, and similar 
joint PTAs of >93% over the MIC range of 0.015 to 4 µg/mL were observed. Based on the joint PTA 
analysis, the proposed dosing regimen seems overall appropriate. As stated by the MAH, the proposed 
dosing regimen will account for children in Group 1 with a body weight <50 kg, which in the dosing 
regimens evaluated in the clinical studies (P034 and P035) received a fixed dose of 1g/0.5g C/T.  
In the adult patients the joint PTA for C/T was >97%, which is slightly higher than what is modelled in 
the paediatric population. In general, throughout the submitted application, the MAH has described the 
paediatric data acceptably.  
4.3.5.  Dose response studies 
Exposure-efficacy analyses 
Exposure-response (ER) analysis were conducted to assess the potential relationship between individual 
ceftolozane plasma PK/PD target (%fT>MIC, where MIC was the highest MIC for the identified organism) 
and tazobactam plasma PK/PD target (%fT>1 µg/mL), and secondary efficacy endpoints: clinical success

rate and per-participant microbiological success rate at the end of IV (EOIV) end of therapy (EOT) and 
test of cure (TOC) visit in P034 and P035. 
- Dataset 
For P034, 97 of 100 subjects in the C/T treatment group completed the study. Participants in the 
Microbiological Modified Intent-to-Treat (mMITT) population (n=71) who received C/T and whose PK were 
characterized in the Population-PK models were used in the analysis for both clinical and microbiological 
responses (n=65) at the TOC visit and the EOT visit. The mMITT population was a subset of randomised 
participants who received any amount of study treatment and had at least 1 acceptable causative 
uropathogen identified from a study-qualifying baseline urine culture (a baseline study-qualifying urine 
culture had to contain 1 and not more than 2 gram-negative bacterial isolates at ≥105 CFU/mL each). A 
majority of participants in the mMITT population received oral step-down antibacterial medication 
(70.4%). For subjects who received only IV study treatment and were not switched to oral step-down 
therapy, the EOIV (end of IV treatment) assessment served as the EOT assessment, and these subjects 
did not have a separate EOT assessment. Subjects who were switched to oral step-down therapy had 
both an EOIV and EOT assessment. 
For P035, participants in the modified intent to treat (MITT) population (n=70) who received C/T and 
whose PK were characterized in the Population-PK models were used in the analysis for clinical response 
(N=55) at the TOC visit and EOT visit). The MITT population (n=70) consisted of all randomised 
participants who received any amount of study treatment. Participants in the mMITT population (n=63) 
who received C/T and whose PK were characterized in the Population-PK models were used in the analysis 
for microbiological response (N=55 at the TOC visit and EOT visit). In the MITT population 37 out of 70 
(50%) received oral step-down antibacterial medication. 
- Results AP/cUTI 
In the exposure-efficacy dataset for paediatric Phase 2 study in AP/cUTI (P034), individual values of 
ceftolozane PK/PD index (%fT>MIC) were 100% in all paediatric participants with clinical cure or 
observed failure at TOC (Figure 5). In the same dataset, the individual values of tazobactam PK/PD index 
(%fT>1 μg/mL) in paediatric participants were >20%, in those with clinical cure or observed failure at 
TOC. Therefore, the MAH stated that there was no apparent trend in the exposure measures for either 
ceftolozane or tazobactam with clinical response at TOC in paediatric participants with AP/cUTI in P034.

fT>MIC, and 11 of which had fT>MIC ranged from ~14% to ~92%. Of the participants with 100% 
fT>MIC, 35 achieved clinical cure at TOC (95%); of the participants with 0% fT>MIC, 6 achieved clinical 
cure at TOC (75%); and of the participants with fT>MIC between 14% and 92%, 9 achieved clinical cure 
at TOC (82%). Like AP/cUTI, no interpretable trend between either efficacy endpoint or exposure

measures of ceftolozane and tazobactam was identified at TOC in paediatric participants with cIAI in 
P035. 
The exploratory graphical analysis indicated that all paediatric cIAI participants with fT>MIC below the 
ceftolozane PK/PD target (30%), except one, at the highest MIC breakpoint for ceftolozane (MIC > 4 
μg/mL) and most of these participants achieved clinical cure at TOC (Figure 8). The individual %fT>1 
μg/mL values for tazobactam in the same dataset were >20% for all but one paediatric participant, 
irrespective of clinical cure or observed failure at TOC.

In the exposure-efficacy dataset for the paediatric Phase 2 study in cIAI (P035), there was no apparent

paediatric participants with cIAI (Figure 9). Exposure-efficacy analyses using other efficacy endpoints 
(per-participant microbiology response at EOIV) for paediatric cIAI patients (Figure 10) yielded results 
consistent with those described above.

Paediatric cIAI (P035). All MICs collected refers to the highest MIC of all pathogens isolated from the

Exposure-efficacy analyses using other efficacy endpoints for paediatric AP/cUTI and cIAI (clinical 
response at EOT, per-participant microbiology response at TOC and EOT) yielded results consistent with 
those described above. Taken together, the MAH states that, the exploratory analyses supported that the 
concentrations of ceftolozane and tazobactam attained at the paediatric dosing regimens evaluated in 
P034 and P035 are at the flat regions of the exposure-response relationship. 
The CHMP noted that exposure-response analyses were conducted to check for possible association 
between individual ceftolozane plasma PK/PD target and tazobactam plasma PK/PD target and secondary 
efficacy endpoints. The endpoints used in the exposure response analysis is clinical success rate and per-
participant microbiological success rate at the EOT and TOC visit in P034 and P035. Since these 
endpoints do not solely reflect the response to C/T, but also the response to the oral step-down antibiotic 
therapy (the majority of participants in the mMITT population (which consisted of 71 patients) received 
oral step-down antibacterial medication (70.4%)), the MAH was requested to perform the explorative 
exposure response analysis again, with EOIV as endpoint. The answer showed no apparent trend in the 
exposure measures for either ceftolozane (%fT>MIC) or tazobactam (%fT>1 μg/mL) with clinical 
response or per-participant microbiological responses at EOIV in paediatric participants with AP/cUTI or 
cIAI. The concentrations of ceftolozane and tazobactam attained at the paediatric dosing regimens 
evaluated in P034 and P035 are likely at the flat regions of the exposure-response relationship.   
Exposure-safety analyses 
The planned exposure-safety analyses were not conducted as no drug-related TEAEs met the incidence 
rate threshold of 20%, and no events of clinical interest were identified. 
4.3.6.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The MAH applied to extend the adult cUTI, AP and cIAI indications to children and adolescents from birth 
to <18 years.  
In accordance with the Addendum to the guideline on the evaluation of medicinal products indicated for 
treatment of bacterial infections to address paediatric-specific clinical data requirements 
(EMA/CHMP/187859/2017), extrapolation of efficacy to the paediatric populations could be made 
provided similar exposures (and similar safety profile) to those in adults. The guideline outlines that it 
may not be necessary to obtain pharmacokinetic data from all age subgroups in which use is to be

proposed. In some circumstances, modelling and simulation of adult data may be sufficient to support 
dosing recommendations for certain age subgroups (e.g., adolescent subjects). On other hand, 
pharmacokinetic data will need to be generated in neonates in almost all cases owing to the rapid 
developmental changes in absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion.  
The variation application is supported by one phase 1 (P010: P010MK7625A) and two phase 2 studies 
(P034: P034MK7625A, P035: P035MK7625A) as well as PK and PK/PD modelling. 
Pharmacokinetics 
- Bioanalytical methods 
The analytical methods submitted to support the new phase 1 and 2 clinical studies have been adequately 
validated in previous procedures in accordance with the EMA bioanalytical guideline 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1). The analysis of PK samples from the phase 1 and phase 2 
studies are acceptable.  
In previous Zerbaxa procedures, a relatively high proportion of tazobactam plasma concentration 
measures were BLQ. This is also the case in the 3 clinical studies included to support the current 
application. This hampered the population-PK modelling and the PTA simulations. However, since most of 
the BLQ samples were collected either pre-dose or at 6-7 hours after end of infusion, and the target 
exposure of tazobactam is 20% fT>CT of 1µg/mL, the available dataset was considered sufficient for the 
PK assessment.  
- Modelling and simulation 
To support dosing recommendations in the new target population, population-PK models describing C/T 
PK in adults have been modified and updated with available paediatric PK data from the three clinical 
studies to predict exposure in children <18 years old using a Bayesian approach. Separate models were 
developed for ceftolozane and tazobactam, as in adults. The regulatory impact of the models is 
considered moderate to high as there is clinical data in paediatric patients available for validation 
activities of the models, but the data is sparse and not fully covering all factors that are known to 
influence PK exposure (age, weight, type of infection, renal function). The limitations in the observed data 
impact the ability to validate the model predictions at low weight, low renal function and for the cIAI 
indication. Further, a high proportion of the tazobactam samples were below the LOQ. In the initial 
dossier in support of this procedure, the respective model evaluations indicated reasonable fit for the 
ceftolozane model and model mis-specifications for tazobactam. In response to consequent CHMP 
questions, the MAH provided pcVPCs for the tazobactam model, as well as graphical presentations of the 
exposure metrics AUC and Ceoi versus body weight and age on continuous scales for the full paediatric 
populations with additional separate plot focused on the children 0 – 1 year of age. The newly provided 
overall pcVPC indicates no major mis-specification in the model, and overall, the additional presentations 
submitted indicate that the tazobactam population-PK model fit to the paediatric data reasonably well, 
also at the lower age range. The model is considered however of low reliability, particularly for the lowest 
age ranges (below 3 months for AP/cUTI and below 2 years for cIAI). Limited clinical data exists from 
paediatric patients with CrCL <50 mL/min/1.73m2, and the paediatric population PK-model for 
ceftolozane did not adequately describe the influence of renal function. Consequently, no dosing 
recommendations could be provided for paediatric patients with immature or impaired renal function as 
part of this variation.

cIAI and AP/cUTI 
In study P010 the aim of the dose selection was to achieve comparable exposures to those calculated for 
adult patients with cIAI and AP/cUTI. The selected exposure target for ceftolozane covers the range of 
AUCs reported in healthy adults, adult AP/cUTI and adult cIAI patients and seems appropriate. The 
ceftolozane PK parameters were generally comparable across Groups 1-4 in study P010, but the 
ceftolozane and tazobactam CL appeared to be lower in subjects aged birth to <3 months (Groups 5 and 
6). After accounting for weight, the ceftolozane CL was comparable across most age groups with a lower 
weight corrected CL in patients in Group 6 with CrCL <50 mL/min/1.73m2, these patients also received a 
lower dose of C/T. Hence, the lower CL observed in infants and neonates is likely due to their immature 
renal function.  
Overall, the exposure of ceftolozane in study P034 and P035 estimated by the population-PK model are 
within the defined target exposure. Although some trends are observed in the steady-state ceftolozane 
and tazobactam plasma PK parameter values estimated by population-PK modelling, the presented data 
are still within the range of observations in the adult participants with AP/cUTI and cIAI. Of note, there 
are few patients included in each age group, especially in the lower age groups which brings uncertainties 
to the estimates. Still, the provided data are considered sufficient in support of extension of indication to 
the paediatric AP/cUTI patients and cIAI patients ≥2 years. The patient population in study P034 includes 
both cUTI and pyelonephritis of sufficient severity requiring hospitalisation and treatment with 
intravenous (IV) antibiotics. The MAH did not present any specific analysis to investigate potential 
differences in PK between the AP and cUTI patients. However, there is no expected difference in 
pharmacokinetics between cUTI and AP based on adult PK data, and it is considered that the paediatric 
PK data is representative for both cUTI and AP. 
Concerning cIAI patients <2 years of age, PK data is only available for one single patient (age group birth 
to <3 months). According to the Guideline on the role of pharmacokinetics in the development of 
medicinal products in the paediatric population (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/147013/2004), pharmacokinetic 
information from one indication can be extrapolated to another indication if it can be assumed that the 
diseases and commonly used concomitant medications are not affecting the pharmacokinetics of the 
drug. In the adult population-PK models, body weight, renal function (eGFR) and age were identified as 
significant covariates for ceftolozane and tazobactam, while infection types (cUTI, cIAI and NP) were 
identified as significant covariates for ceftolozane, but not for tazobactam. Of note, the expected 
difference in exposure between the two infection types are not large and does not lead to adjustments in 
the dosing regimen for adults or children.  
The single patient <3 months of age with cIAI had estimated exposures of ceftolozane comparable to the 
patients <3 months of age with AP/cUTI in study P034, while the estimated tazobactam exposures was 
higher. Of importance, this is an estimated measure from one single cIAI patient, the tazobactam 
exposure distribution in the AP/cUTI patients <3 months of age are wide, and the exposure measures 
from the patient with cIAI <3 months of age is only slightly higher than the highest estimated values in 
the AP/cUTI population (69.9 µg*h/mL vs. ~65 µg*h/mL). Further, the estimated measures of AUC and 
Ceoi for the patient <3 months of age with cIAI are within the range of values observed in adults with 
cIAI. In addition, as discussed in the section model qualification, the credibility of the tazobactam model 
is low, particularly for the lowest age ranges (<3 months for AP/cUTI and <2 years for cIAI). The model 
overpredicts the tazobactam exposures, most prominently at the end of the dosing interval. Even so, 
considering the target of fraction of time above 1mg/mL at 20%, the observed exposure data indicate 
that patients are above this limit. Due to the limited PK data available, it is difficult to draw any clear 
conclusions on the comparison between the cIAI and AP/cUTI populations <2 years of age.  
Assessment report  
EMA/644705/2022 
Page 50/127 
 
 
 
 
 
However, based on the totality of the data presented, albeit limited, it is supported that the proposed 
dosing regimens can be extended to the age groups <2 years with cIAI based on extrapolation from the 
modelling and simulations. 
- Reduced renal function 
One exclusion criterion in study P034 and P035 were moderate or severe impairment of renal function, 
defined as an estimated CrCL <50 mL/min/1.73 m2 based on the Bedside Schwartz equation or 
requirement for peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, or hemofiltration. No dose recommendations in 
paediatric patients below 18 years of age with eGFR ≤ 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 was initially established. 
Considering that the ceftolozane and tazobactam both are renally excreted, dosing recommendations in 
renal impairment is generally required.  
Considering the low GFR expected in new-born (children born at term is expected to have GFR of 
approximately 10-20 mL/min/1.73m2 the first day of life, thereafter rising up to approximately 30-40 
mL/min/1.73m2 after two weeks, reaching adult levels first at two years of age. In preterm neonates, the 
expected GFR is even lower than in children born at term and rises more slowly than in children born at 
term. Hence, this cut-off will most likely exclude a large proportion of the youngest patients born at term 
and possibly all the youngest preterm patients from treatment with C/T. Further, the estimation of GFR in 
paediatric patients is challenging, and the proposed posology with a cut-off based on CrCL/eGFR might 
not be well-suited for clinical practice.  
After additional investigation and refinements of the submitted population PK model, it emerged that the 
model is not considered suitable for predicting dosing recommendations for paediatric patients 
above/below 2 years of age with immature or impaired renal function. Considering the limitations in the 
data and the lack of a reliable population PK model, no dosing recommendations could be provided for 
paediatric patients with reduced/immature renal function at the time of this procedure. The MAH 
confirmed that the ongoing study MK-7625A-036, is expected to yield data from patients from birth to <3 
months of age with an eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 and further that additional experience in older children 
with an eGFR between 50 to 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 may be available to inform any effect of eGFR on 
ceftolozane and tazobactam. When the data in paediatric patients with reduced renal function will be 
available it is expected that an application be submitted for a variation to include in sections 4.2 and 5.2 
of the SmPC (and other sections as relevant) dosing recommendations to paediatric patients with AP/cUTI 
or cIAI with immature or impaired renal function, if supported by the data. To support this variation, the 
MAH is recommended to submit full results of updated/relevant population PK model(s).  
In the SmPC “from birth” is now defined as >32 weeks gestational age and ≥7 days postnatal, in both 
Section 4.2 and 5.1, reflecting the population actually studied.   
- Drug-drug interactions 
No new DDI studies have been provided in support of the current application. Data from previous 
procedures indicates a low risk of DDIs during C/T treatment, and it is reasonable that the low DDI 
potential observed in adults can be extended to the paediatric population. In the two paediatric Phase 2 
studies (P034 and P035) submitted for the current application based on the low risk of DDIs related with 
C/T, no further assessment of concomitant treatment in the two clinical studies (P034 and P035) have 
been made. 
Pharmacodynamics and PK/PD modelling 
C/T appears to demonstrate potent in vitro activity against Enterobacterales and P. aeruginosa isolates 
collected globally from paediatric patients (2017-2019), regardless of infection site. The overall 
Assessment report  
EMA/644705/2022 
Page 51/127 
 
 
 
 
 
 
distribution of C/T MICs among the P. aeruginosa clinical trial isolates from study P034 and P035 was 
similar to that of the surveillance study isolates in both the US and EU. The Enterobacterales modal C/T 
MIC from the surveillance studies seems to be somewhat higher than what is found in the clinical studies. 
Since this is an application where efficacy data mainly are extrapolated from adult data to paediatric 
patients, the surveillance data and MIC distributions is considered more of a descriptive part of the 
application and has not been further assessed. 
No new in vitro studies were submitted. There are no expected differences in the mechanism of action of 
C/T based on age as the Gram-negative causative pathogens are similar in adults and children. Joint 
PK/PD targets in line with the PK/PD targets used to assess PTA in adults (AP/cUTI, cIAI and NP), have 
been used (30% fT>MIC for ceftolozane and 20 %fT> 1 µg/mL for tazobactam), which is acceptable. 
Although there are uncertainties whether the tazobactam target of 20% fT>CT 1 µg/mL should have been 
more conservative, due to concerns whether the tazobactam dose is sufficient to protect ceftolozane from 
betalactamases produced by Enterobacterales. This was an issue both in the initial procedure 
(AP/cUTI/cIAI) and in the extension of the adult indication to include NP. The issue has not been further 
pursued in this procedure but is highlighted due to the importance of the awareness of the uncertainties 
that underlies the results from the joint PTA analysis (see below) which in turn supports the dosing 
rationale provided by the MAH. 
The C/T dosage regimens evaluated in the paediatric Phase 2 studies were selected based on the criteria 
that ceftolozane and tazobactam plasma exposures (AUC and Ceoi) in paediatric patients would not 
exceed those in adult AP/cUTI and cIAI patients, and that the projected C/T joint PTA would be ≥90%. 
Even though the exposure of ceftolozane and tazobactam was slightly lower in some age groups 
compared to that observed in adults, all paediatric subgroups achieved acceptable PTAs of ≥94% over the 
MIC range of 0.015 to 4 µg/mL at the proposed dosing recommendations using the same joint PK/PD 
targets as for the adult cIAI, AP/cUTI and NP indications. The MAH did also assess the joint C/T PTA at 
the dosing regimens evaluated in P034 and P035, and similar joint PTAs of >93% over the MIC range of 
0.015 to 4 µg/mL were observed. Based on the joint PTA analysis, the proposed dosing regimen seems 
overall appropriate. Compared to the dosing regimen evaluated in study P034 and P035, the proposed 
dosing regimen will account for children in Group 1 with a body weight <50 kg, which were given a fixed 
dose, similar to the adult population, in the clinical studies.  
The tazobactam PK/PD target of 20 %fT> 1 µg/mL is not well founded, however, the concern regarding 
the chosen PK/PD target has not been further pursued in the current application.  
- Exposure-response analysis 
Exposure-response (ER) analysis were conducted to assess the potential relationship between individual 
ceftolozane plasma PK/PD target and tazobactam plasma PK/PD target, and the secondary efficacy 
endpoints in study P034 and P035. The endpoints initially used in the exposure response analysis is 
clinical success rate and per-participant microbiological success rate at the EOT and TOC visit in P034 
and P035. Since these endpoints will not solely reflect the response to C/T, but also the response to the 
oral step-down antibiotic therapy (the majority of participants in the mMITT population received oral 
step-down antibacterial medication, 70.4%), the MAH was requested to perform the explorative exposure 
response analysis again with EOIV as endpoint. The re-analysis showed no apparent trend in the 
exposure measures for either ceftolozane (%fT>MIC) or tazobactam (%fT>1 μg/mL) with clinical 
response or per-participant microbiological responses at EOIV in paediatric participants with AP/cUTI or 
cIAI. The concentrations of ceftolozane and tazobactam attained at the paediatric dosing regimens 
evaluated in P034 and P035 are likely at the flat regions of the exposure-response relationship.

4.3.7.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the totality of the data allows for concluding that the proposed dosing recommendations are 
adequate for both ceftolozane and tazobactam for the majority of the paediatric patients and that the 
exposures are sufficiently similar to allow extrapolation of safety and efficacy from adults for cIAI, AP and 
cUTI infections in paediatric patients with eGFR >50 mL/min/1.73m2. This is reflected in the SmPC 
approved with this procedure. 
Of note, with the current dosing recommendations for Zerbaxa, a proportion of the youngest patients 
born at term and possibly all the youngest preterm patients will not be covered.  
4.4.  Clinical efficacy in paediatric AP and cUTI 
4.4.1.  Main study 
P034MK7625A (abbreviated P034) – AP/cUTI 
Clinical study to evaluate safety, tolerability and efficacy of ceftolozane and tazobactam, compared with 
meropenem in paediatric patients from birth to less than 18 years of age with acute pyelonephritis (AP) 
and complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs). 
Methods 
P034 was a Phase 2 randomised (3:1), active comparator-controlled, multicentre and double-blind study 
conducted in paediatric participants from birth (defined as >32 weeks gestational age and ≥7 days 
postnatal) to <18 years of age with cUTI, including pyelonephritis of sufficient severity requiring 
hospitalisation and treatment with intravenous (IV) antibiotics. Its study design is shown in the figure 
below.

The CHMP considered that selection criteria reflect a patient population with ongoing acute infections of 
the urinary tract, including acute pyelonephritis (AP), evaluated as being complicated, serious and require 
hospitalisation for treatment with IV therapy. The selected criteria were considered by the Committee 
acceptable and in accordance with the patient criteria specified for UTI in the CHMP’s “Addendum to the 
guideline on the evaluation of medicinal products indicated for treatment of bacterial infections 
(EMA/CHMP/351889/2013)”. 
Treatments 
Paediatric participants from 12 to <18 years of age with cUTI received the adult fixed dose of 1.5 g C/T 
(1 g ceftolozane and 0.5 g tazobactam); children <12 years of age, including neonates, received a 
weight-based dosing regimen of 30 mg/kg C/T (20 mg/kg ceftolozane and 10 mg/kg tazobactam) that did 
not exceed the adult fixed dose of 1.5 g C/T (1 g ceftolozane and 0.5 g tazobactam). 
The dose of meropenem was 20 mg/kg (maximum 1 g/dose) for all age groups. However, due to that 
some literature supports a higher meropenem dosage (up to 30 mg/kg every 8 hours) for participants 14 
days to <3 months of age, meropenem dosing up to 30 mg/kg every 8 hours could be used for 
participants 14 days to <3 months of age at the investigator’s discretion.  
Both ceftolozane/tazobactam and meropenem were to be dosed every 8 hours (±1 hour) after the 
previous infusion. 
Each dose of ceftolozane/tazobactam was administered as a 60-minute infusion. To ensure blinding, each 
dose of meropenem was also administered as a 60-minute (±10 minutes) infusion (versus the 30-minute 
infusion as approved in Member States) to match the duration of infusion of ceftolozane/tazobactam. 
After receiving at least 9 doses of double-blind IV study treatment, participants could be switched to 
open-label, standard-of-care, oral step-down therapy at the investigator’s discretion. The total duration of 
study treatment (IV only or IV + oral) was a minimum of 7 days and a maximum of 14 days. 
The CHMP noted that the MAH chose meropenem (which is approved in Europe in the treatment of cUTI 
in adults and children from 3 months and above) as comparator. Meropenem is a broad-spectrum 
antibiotic and should preferably be reserved for use in severe, multidrug-resistant and complicated 
infections. However, the Committee acknowledged that there is increasing resistance towards narrow-
spectrum antibiotics worldwide, and thus the use of meropenem might be justified in some cases also for 
cUTI.   
Assessment report  
EMA/644705/2022 
Page 56/127 
 
 
 
 
 
The MAH’s view that the use of the same comparator in the two trials P034 and P035 would allow for a 
larger sized safety database by pooling the data from these two trials was also understood, especially 
considering that safety was the primary endpoint for these studies. 
The chosen doses for meropenem from 3 months to < 18 years is in accordance with what is previously 
approved. The safety and efficacy of meropenem in children under 3 months of age have not been 
established and the optimal dose regimen has not been identified. However, the off-label dose used in the 
study (20 mg/kg with the possibility to increase to 30mg/kg at the investigator’s discretion) seems to be 
in line with data from current available publications (Fasugba et al, 2015; Cohen-Wolkowiez et al, 2012). 
In the Initial MAA for Zerbaxa, the active comparator in the Phase 3 trials of ceftolozane/tazobactam in 
adults with cUTI (CXA-cUTI-10-04 [MK-7625A-005] and CXA-cUTI-10-05 [MK-7625A-006]), was a 
fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin). However, the MAH pointed out that fluoroquinolones may not be 
appropriate as comparators in the paediatric population due to concerns about increased musculoskeletal 
AEs in paediatric patients who receive fluoroquinolones compared with other classes of antibiotics 
(Bradley and Jackson, 2011). In addition, rising rates of fluoroquinolone resistance among common 
uropathogens have rendered this class of antibacterial agents a questionable choice for initial empiric 
therapy in certain parts of the world (Wagenlehner et al, 2015; Hanna-Wakim et al, 2015; Fasugba et al, 
2015). This was agreed by the Committee. 
The EAU/ European Society for Paediatric Urology (ESPU) guidelines for UTI in children recommend that 
parenteral antibiotic therapy should be given until the child is afebrile, before switching to and continuing 
on oral antibiotics for additional 7-14 days (Stein et al. 2015). In the majority of patients with UTI, 
normalisation of body temperature can be expected within 24-48 hours after start of therapy. Hence, 
both the timing of the optional switch from parenteral to oral antibiotics from the fourth day after 
treatment initiation, and the recommended total duration of IV and oral treatment of 7-14 days, are 
considered acceptable. Recommended antibiotic or antibiotic class options for step-down therapy by the 
MAH were: β-lactam/BLI combinations, cephalosporins, quinolones, nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim, or 
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The oral treatment options for switching are all frequently used oral 
antibacterial agents known to be effective for treatment of paediatric UTIs.  
The doses chosen for ceftolozane/tazobactam were based on population PK models, exposure data and 
PTA criteria. 
Objectives 
Primary objective 
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of C/T compared with that of MERO. 
Secondary objectives 
1.  To evaluate the efficacy of C/T compared with that of MERO with respect to clinical response at 
the EOT and TOC Visits 
2.  To evaluate the efficacy of C/T compared with that of MERO with respect to per-participant 
microbiological response at the EOT and TOC Visits 
Outcomes/endpoints

To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ceftolozane/tazobactam in paediatric subjects (based on the 
APaT population). 
Secondary endpoints (efficacy) 
1.  Clinical success rate at the EOT and TOC Visits, defined as the proportion of participants in the 
analysis population who have a clinical response of cure. 
2.  Per-participant microbiological eradication rate at the EOT and TOC Visits, defined as the 
proportion of participants in the analysis population who have an overall outcome of 
microbiological eradication. 
The CHMP noted that efficacy measure was defined as secondary endpoints in this study and evaluation 
of efficacy was based on descriptive statistics. According to the Draft guideline EMA/CHMP/187859/2017 
“Addendum to guideline on the evaluation of medicinal products indicated for treatment of bacterial 
infections to address paediatric-specific clinical data requirements”, it is considered appropriate to 
extrapolate efficacy observed in adults to paediatric patients with AP/cUTI provided similar exposure is 
achieved in the paediatric population across different age subgroups. In addition, sufficient safety data 
with the intended dose regimen have to be collected in the paediatric population, which is defined as a 
primary endpoint in this study. Thus, the primary and secondary endpoints of this study were considered 
acceptable by the Committee. 
Clinical outcome categories 
cUTI = complicated urinary tract infection; EOIV = End of IV Treatment; EOT = End of Treatment; IV = intravenous; TOC = Test of 
Cure 
a Clinical success rate was defined at the EOT and TOC visits as the proportion of participants in the analysis population who had a 
clinical response of “cure.” 
b The clinical success rate at the EOIV visit was defined as the proportion of participants in the analysis population who had a clinical 
response of “cure” or “partial improvement.” The definition for clinical success at the EOIV visit included “partial improvement” to 
accommodate those participants with partial improvement who were switched to oral step-down therapy at this time point. For 
participants who received IV study treatment only (without optional oral step-down therapy), a separate assessment was not performed 
at the EOT Visit; the EOIV visit served as the EOT Visit. 
Microbiological outcome categories

CFU = colony-forming units  
The per-pathogen microbiological outcome will be determined for each uropathogen isolated by the Sponsor from a baseline study-
qualifying culture. In order for the participant to have a per-participant microbiological response of eradication, each baseline pathogen 
must have had a microbiological response of eradication. Eradication will be considered a favorable microbiological response. 
Sample size 
This was an estimation trial; no formal statistical testing was to be performed for the efficacy or safety 
endpoints. Due to enrolment challenges the protocol was amended which led to a lower total enrolment 
than originally planned (i.e., 240 participants). The amendment was accepted by the PDCO. A total of 228 
participants were enrolled across both studies, i.e., 134 participants in P034 and 94 participants in P035.  
Randomisation 
Treatment randomisation was to be stratified across the following 5 age groups: 
• Group 1: Ages 12 to <18 years 
• Group 2: Ages 6 to <12 years 
• Group 3: Ages 2 to <6 years 
• Group 4: Ages 3 months to <2 years 
• Group 5: Ages birth (defined as >32 weeks gestational age and ≥7 days postnatal) to <3 months 
Blinding (masking) 
A double-blinding technique with in-house blinding was to be used.  
Statistical methods 
There were no prespecified statistical hypotheses for this trial. Secondary efficacy endpoints were 
included to provide point estimates of the efficacy of each treatment regimen; the study was not powered 
for formal hypothesis testing of between treatment group comparisons. 
Descriptive summaries were provided for each of the primary and secondary variables. In general, 
summaries were presented by cohort, treatment group and overall, for treatment group across all 
cohorts. The Safety analysis set was used for summaries and listings. Clinical response outcomes were 
summarised by cohort, treatment group and overall, for each treatment in the mMITT, CE and ME 
analysis sets (defined below).

Safety analysis population: the APaT (=All Participants as Treated) population consisted of all randomised 
participants who received any amount of study treatment. This population was used for the analysis of 
safety data.  
Efficacy analyses were based on the microbiological modified intent-to-treat (mMITT), clinically evaluable 
(CE) and microbiologically evaluable (ME) populations. 
Definitions of efficacy analysis populations in P034 in AP/cUTI 
•  mMITT: the mMITT population served as the primary population for the analyses of clinical 
response and microbiological eradication rate. This population was a subset of randomised 
participants who received any amount of study treatment and had at least 1 acceptable causative 
uropathogen identified from a study-qualifying baseline urine culture (a baseline study-qualifying 
urine culture had to contain 1 and not more than 2 gram-negative bacterial isolates at ≥105 
CFU/mL each).  
•  CE: the CE population served as the secondary population for the analysis of clinical response 
data in this study. This population was a subset of the mMITT population who adhered to study 
procedures, did not have a significant protocol deviation impacting efficacy assessment, and 
received a minimum amount of study therapy. Participants with an indeterminate clinical outcome 
were excluded from the CE population.  
•  ME: the ME population served as the secondary population for the analysis of microbiological data 
in this study. This population was a subset of the CE population who had an interpretable urine 
culture at the visit of interest within the visit window. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 143 participants were screened and 134 were randomised (101 in the C/T group and 33 in the 
MERO group). All non-randomised participants were screen failures.

Numbers analysed 
Table 22: Summary of analysis populations - all randomised participants – Study P034 
The most common reason for exclusion from all populations (mMITT and therefore consequently also in 
CE and ME) was “did not have at least 1 qualifying baseline uropathogen”. This included no culture taken, 
a negative culture or no growth at baseline, or sub-threshold growth of a qualifying pathogen. 
In total 28.4% of the patients were excluded for this reason from the mMITT population.  
It is noted that in the CE population at TOC, 17.8% in the C/T group vs. 12.1% in the MERO group were 
excluded due to “confounding antibacterial post-treatment”.  
A majority of the treated participants in both treatment groups completed IV study medication (69/100, 
69.0% in the C/T group vs. 24/33, 72.7% in the MERO group). The most common reason for 
discontinuation of IV study medication was lack of qualifying event (i.e., lack of a study-qualifying 
baseline urine culture) in both groups (27/100, 27.0% in the C/T group and 8/33, 24.2% in the MERO 
group). 
In both treatment groups, of those participants who completed IV study medication, most switched to 
oral step-down therapy and all of these patients completed the study. 
Recruitment 
First patient visit: 26 April 2018, last patient visit: 03 December 2020, database lock date: 22 January 
2021. The study was conducted at 28 study sites in the following 8 countries (number of patients 
randomised): Greece (36 patients), Hungary (22 patients), Mexico (9 patients), Poland (17 patients), 
Russia (8 patients), Turkey (14 patients), Ukraine (22 patients) and the US (6 patients).

Protocol deviations 
Important protocol deviations were reported for 29 (29.0%) participants in the C/T treatment group and 
7 (21.2%) in the MERO treatment group.  
No important protocol deviations were classified as serious GCP compliance issues.  
It is noted that for 10% of the patients in the C/T group vs. none in the MERO group, no urine culture 
was obtained where required by protocol.

The CHMP considered that demographic and baseline characteristics were relatively well balanced 
between the treatment groups. 
Overall, most of the patients was predominantly white, European, females with a median age of 3.8 years 
in the C/T group and 3.08 years in the MERO group and with normal renal function. 
Assessment report  
EMA/644705/2022 
Page 65/127 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Of note, the majority of patients were diagnosed with pyelonephritis at baseline; 80.2% in the C/T group 
vs. 72.7% in the MERO group. Overall, a higher proportion of the patients in the C/T group had cUTI 
complicating factors compared to the patients in the MERO group. 
Baseline microbiology 
In total, 98.6% in the C/T group and 95.8% in the MERO group had one study qualifying baseline 
pathogen identified from urine cultures, thereby encompassing the mMITT population. 
The most common baseline qualifying gram-negative uropathogens were Escherichia coli (C/T: 74.6%; 
MERO: 87.5%), Klebsiella pneumonia (8.5%; 4.2%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.0%; 8.3%). 
Nearly all participants’ infections at baseline were monomicrobial (C/T: 98.6%: MERO: 95.8%). 
Overall, most baseline isolates tested were reported to be susceptible to C/T and MERO. For C/T there 
was one isolate of Serratia marcescens with intermediate susceptibility while for MERO 2 isolates; an E 
coli and a K pneumoniae were resistant. 
Concomitant antibiotic medications 
In the mMITT population, between the first dose of IV study medication and the EOT visit, no participants 
in either treatment group received any doses of concomitant non-study antibiotic therapy (excluding a 
protocol-allowed single dose of prophylactic antibiotics). 
Between the first dose of IV study medication and the TOC visit, 25.4% (18/71) of participants in the C/T 
treatment group and 16.7% (4/24) in the MERO group, received at least one dose of concomitant 
antibiotic therapy; this included participants who received protocol-allowed antibiotic prophylaxis after the 
EOT visit, based on site-level standard of care for participants at increased risk of recurrent cUTI. 
According to the MAH, only one patient each in the C/T group and the MERO group was excluded from the 
CE population due to “concomitant antibacterial violation”. Only 1 patient (in the C/T group) was excluded 
from the CE population due to “prior antibacterial violation”. However, 18/71 patients from the C/T group 
and 4/24 from the MERO group were excluded (CE population at TOC) due to “confounding antibacterial 
post-treatment”. 
The CHMP noted that participants who received non-study antibiotics that were stopped on the same date 
as the first dose of IV study medication or started on the same date as the EOT or TOC visit date (for 
which a start or stop time for the non-study antibiotic was not recorded), were not included as having 
received concomitant antibiotics. With this approach, it cannot be excluded that the non-study antibiotics 
might have had an effect on the study treatment for these patients. However, considering that the 
efficacy should be extrapolated from adults, this issue was not further pursued in the context of efficacy. 
Extent of exposure 
The median (range) number of IV treatment doses was comparable between participants in the C/T (13.5 
[1.0 – 41.0]) and MERO (14 [3.0-29.0]) treatment groups. 
The median (range) duration of IV treatment was comparable between participants in the C/T (4.5 [0.3 to 
13.7] days) and MERO (4.6 [1.0 to 9.7] days) treatment groups. The majority of participants in the C/T 
(55.0%) received IV treatment for >3 to ≤7 days while in the MERO the majority received IV treatment 
for ≥ 1 to ≤ 3 days (39.4%) - data not shown. It is stated by the MAH though that only 2 participants 
received <9 doses of IV treatment due to 1 discontinuation due to an AE and 1 discontinuation due to 
withdrawal by parent/guardian. 
Assessment report  
EMA/644705/2022 
Page 66/127 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The median (range) duration of overall treatment (i.e., IV only or IV + oral) was generally comparable 
between participants in the C/T (9.0 [0.3 to 14.2] days) and MERO (9.3 [1.0 to 14.6] days) treatment 
groups. 
For those participants who switched to oral step-down treatment (C/T: 51/101 [50.5%]; MERO: 20/33 
[60.6%]), the median (range) duration of oral treatment was comparable between participants in the C/T 
(6.3 [1.0 to 9.6] days) and MERO (6.2 [4.0 to 9.8] days) treatment groups. The most common oral step-
down treatments (>10% in either treatment group) were cefixime, amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium, 
and cefuroxime. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Compliance with the overall treatment regimen (both IV and oral step-down) in the mMITT population 
was high in both treatment groups, with all participants being >90% compliant. Median overall treatment 
compliance was 100.0% in both the C/T and MERO groups. 
Clinical success rates were high and comparable between both treatment groups at both the EOT visit and 
the TOC visit in the mMITT population, see table below. 
Table 24: Clinical response by visit - mMITT population – Study P034 
The CHMP noted that in the mMITT population at TOC, 63/71 patients (88.7%) in the C/T group and 
23/24 patients (95.8%) in the MERO group had a favourable clinical response. It was also noted that 
although the clinical success rates in the mMITT population at the TOC visit was generally high, it was 
lower in C/T group compared to MERO group. Clinical success rates at the EOT visit were generally 
consistent with those reported at the TOC visit. In the mMITT population at the EOIV visit, 67/71 patients 
(94.4%) in the C/T group and 24/24 patients (100%) in the MERO group had a favourable clinical 
response. Of note, the majority of the patients at the EOIV visit had only a partial improvement (50/71, 
70.4% in the C/T arm vs. 20/24, 83.3% in the MERO group). Thus, these patients did not need further IV 
treatment with either C/T or MERO, but additional oral step-down therapy was still required. The 
definition for clinical success at the EOIV visit included “partial improvement” to accommodate those 
participants with partial improvement who were switched to oral step-down therapy at this time point. 
The clinical response rates in the individual age-cohorts were in general consistent with that observed in 
the overall study population.  
Assessment report  
EMA/644705/2022 
Page 67/127 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Committee additionally noted that the lowest clinical response rates were reported in the age group 6 
-< 12 years (this was also the case at EOT – data not shown). 
The clinical success rate at EOIV, EOT and TOC in the CE population was also high and comparable 
between treatment groups (at TOC: C/T: 44/48 patients, 91.7% vs. 16/17 patients, 94.1% in the MERO 
group) – data not shown. 
Of note, the efficacy results at the TOC visit will not solely reflect the effect of C/T or MERO, but also the 
effect from the oral step-down antibiotic therapy. In the P034 study, it was 51/100 patients in the C/T 
group and 20/33 patients in the MERO group (safety analysis population) who received oral step-down 
antibiotic treatment. However, it has to be kept in mind that for this application, it is the PK and safety 
data, which are critical for the final opinion. As previously mentioned, the use of oral step-down antibiotic 
treatment is considered acceptable, however, regarding the safety evaluation, it might hamper the 
assessment of possible drug-related AEs (please refer to the safety part of this Assessment Report). 
Concerning the PK analyses, these will not be affected as blood was collected from all subjects while they 
still received IV study treatment. However, in order to better reflect the results achieved after treatment 
with only ceftolozane/tazobactam, the results for the exploratory efficacy endpoint clinical success at the 
EOIV visit, have also been included. It has to be emphasized though that, as mentioned above, the main 
proportion of the patients in each arm only had partial improvement and were not assessed as cured 
solely by the IV antibiotic treatment. 
Study P034 was descriptive in nature and not powered for inferential testing as the intention was to 
provide descriptive statistics only. Based on the 3:1 randomisation, meaningful interpretation of direct 
comparisons is not possible. Consequently, no further evaluation or pursue of issues regarding the 
efficacy results will be made. The basis for approval of this variation lies on the PK and safety data, not 
efficacy. 
Table 25: Per-participant microbiological outcome by visit - mMITT population – Study P034 
The CHMP noted that per-participant microbiological eradication rates at the EOT visit were generally 
consistent with those reported at the TOC visit. 
In the mMITT population at EOIV, 68/71 patients (95.8%) in the C/T group vs. 24/24 patients (100%) in 
the MERO group had microbiological success (i.e., eradication). 
The clinical response rates in the individual age-cohorts were in general consistent with that observed in 
the overall study population (data not shown). 
Assessment report  
EMA/644705/2022 
Page 68/127 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The per-participant microbiological eradication rates at both at EOT and TOC in the ME population were 
generally consistent with those reported in the mMITT populations (at TOC: 40/44 patients, 90.9% in the 
C/T group vs. 15/17 patients, 88.2% in the MERO group). 
Emergent infections 
No participants in either treatment group had a superinfection. Three (4.2%) participants (all in the C/T 
group) had at least 1 new infection. One (1.4%) participant had a new infection of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 
and 2 (2.8%) participants had a new infection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 
4.5.   Clinical efficacy in paediatric cIAI 
4.5.1.  Main study 
P035MK7625A (abbreviated P035) – cIAI 
Clinical study to evaluate safety, tolerability and efficacy of ceftolozane and tazobactam when given in 
combination with metronidazole, compared with meropenem in paediatric patients from birth to less than 
18 years of age with complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs). 
Methods 
Study P035 was a Phase 2, randomised (3:1), active comparator-controlled, multicentre and double-blind 
study conducted in paediatric participants from birth (defined as >32 weeks gestational age and ≥7 days 
postnatal) to <18 years of age with cIAI of sufficient severity requiring hospitalisation and treatment with 
intravenous (IV) antibiotics. The study design of study P035 is shown in the figure below.

<18 years of age. 
2. Had to require IV antibacterial therapy for the treatment of presumed or documented cIAI as 
demonstrated by either: 
Operative diagnosis (laparotomy, laparoscopy or percutaneous drainage) of cIAI, defined as evidence of 
infection within the abdominal cavity extending beyond the hollow viscus of origin into the peritoneal 
space as demonstrated by either abscess formation or peritonitis.

a) Clinical evidence of cIAI as indicated by one or more systemic signs or symptoms that accompany cIAI, 
such as fever, leukocytosis, hypotension, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, anorexia, abdominal mass on 
clinical examination, or altered mental status. 
b) Radiographic evidence consistent with intra-abdominal abcess or peritonitis. 
3. Had to have an operative procedure for the current diagnosis and management of cIAI planned or

were exempt from this inclusion criterion and were not required to have surgery planned or completed in 
order to be eligible for enrolment.) 
Main exclusion criteria 
1. Had received potentially therapeutic antibacterial therapy (e.g., with gram-negative activity) for a 
duration of more than 24 hours during the 48 hours preceding the first dose of study treatment, unless 
the participant was considered to be failing antibiotic therapy for cIAI. 
NOTE: A participant who was considered to be failing a previous antibiotic regimen was required to meet 
all of the following criteria: 
a. Had received the systemic antibacterial treatment for at least 48 hours 
b. Had clinical and operative or radiographic findings clearly indicating ongoing infection 
c. Had planned operative intervention no more than 24 hours after the first dose of study 
treatment 
d. Had not received any further non-study antibiotics post-operatively 
2. Had any of the following conditions, current devices, or procedures as noted in the protocol: 
a. Intractable cIAI that the Investigator anticipated would require more than 14 days of study 
treatment 
b. Abdominal wall abscess 
c. Small bowel obstruction 
d. Ischemic bowel disease without perforation 
e. Traumatic bowel perforation with surgery within 12 hours of perforation 
f. Perforation of gastroduodenal ulcers requiring surgery within 24 hours of perforation (these 
were considered situations of peritoneal soiling before the infection had become established)

extension beyond the gallbladder wall) 
h. Acute suppurative cholangitis 
i. Infected necrotizing pancreatitis 
j. Pancreatic abscess

OR ≥2× ULN) 
Assessment report  
EMA/644705/2022 
Page 71/127 
 
 
 
 
 
5. Was receiving or expected to receive immunosuppressive agents, probenecid, valproic acid, disulfiram, 
ergot derivatives, or non-study systemic (IV or oral) antibacterial treatments 
NOTE: Subjects who required empiric enterococcal coverage for the index cIAI may receive 
concomitant therapy with an enterococcal antibiotic with activity limited to gram-positive 
coverage (e.g., vancomycin, daptomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid). One dose of prophylactic 
antibiotic with gram-negative activity is allowed. 
Subjects who required empiric antifungal coverage for the index cIAI may receive concomitant 
antifungal coverage with an azole, echinocandin, or polyene antifungal as chosen by the 
investigator based on local standard of care. 
6. Had an immunocompromising condition or receipt of immunosuppressive therapy. 
The CHMP considered that, according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, it can be concluded that 
patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections are enrolled as the required infections will lead to 
infectious processes proceeding beyond the organ that is the source of the infection. Simple appendicitis 
is not explicitly mentioned in the exclusion criteria. However, it would be covered by the general term 
“Suspected uncomplicated intra-abdominal infection”. Of note, originally the protocol (dated March 2017) 
had a requirement that the maximum percentage of patients enrolled with complicated appendicitis 
should be 60%. Subsequently, the MAH wanted to remove this requirement, but the PDCO recommended 
retaining a limit of 90% (April 2019). However, in the last modification of the studies, the MAH again 
expressed the wish to delete this requirement entirely (Amendment 3, September 2020). Despite the 
MAH’s efforts to enrich the study population for other cIAI diagnoses, it turned out to be difficult to recruit 
non-appendicitis subjects. On this occasion the removal was accepted by the PDCO (see also below, 
under “Conduct of the study”). 
Overall, the included types of intra-abdominal infections could be categorised as infections that are 
neither so limited that just surgery would be curative, nor so complicated that several additional 
confounding factors would affect curation. 
Generally, the treatment options suggested to cover Enterococcus, lack activity against Gram-negative 
pathogens and are therefore not expected to impact efficacy results. 
Treatments 
Please refer to “Treatments” for Study P034 above. 
The difference from Study P034 was that subjects in the ceftolozane/tazobactam arm received adjunctive 
therapy with IV metronidazole. The addition of metronidazole in combination with ceftolozane/tazobactam 
ensured coverage of intra-abdominal infections caused by anaerobic bacteria. 
The dose of metronidazole was 10 mg/kg (maximum 1.5 g/day for all age groups apart from the age 
group birth to < 3 months. Data on the PK and ideal dosing of metronidazole in paediatric patients are 
limited, especially for paediatric patients less than 1 month of age. As a result, dosing recommendations 
are highly variable without an accepted standard. Suggested dosing recommendations for subjects <1 
month old outlined in the protocol were based on one of the more commonly used dosing schedules 
(Cohen-Wolkowiez et al, 2012). However, to allow for potential variations in metronidazole dosing 
between different sites participating in this trial, the protocol allowed for the use of site - specific 
standard-of-care dosing in subjects <1 month of age.  
The total duration of study treatment (IV only or IV + oral) was a minimum of 5 days and a maximum of 
14 days. 
Assessment report  
EMA/644705/2022 
Page 72/127 
 
 
 
 
 
The CHMP considered that metronidazole was added for anaerobic coverage, in line with clinical 
recommendations. The chosen doses for the youngest children were, overall, in line with what is 
commonly recommended. 
The doses chosen for ceftolozane/tazobactam were based on population PK models, exposure data and 
PTA criteria, please refer to the clinical pharmacology section for more details. 
The proposed treatment duration of 5-14 days and the option to switch to oral therapy is generally in line 
with current IDSA guideline 2010 and World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines 2017 for 
management of intra-abdominal infections. These guidelines state that patients with cIAI require 4 to 7-
day courses of antibiotic therapy, either as oral or parenteral treatment. Switch from parenteral therapy 
to oral therapy is recommended after at least three days as long as they are clinically improving, 
according to pre-defined objective criteria. In the current study, clinical improvement at EOIV was 
defined, and had to be fulfilled before allowing a switch to oral therapy. Thus, the strategy of switching 
from IV to oral treatment to complete a short course of therapy is considered acceptable. 
Options for step-down therapy recommended by the MAH were: β-lactam/BLI combination; second- or 
third-generation cephalosporin in combination with MTZ; quinolone (if ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin then 
used in combination with MTZ) which was acceptable to the CHMP.

Clinical outcome categories 
cIAI = complicated intra-abdominal infection; EOIV = End of IV Treatment; EOT = End of Treatment; IAI=intra-abdominal infection; IV 
= intravenous; TOC = Test of Cure 
a Clinical success rate was defined at the EOT and TOC visits as the proportion of participants in the analysis population who had a 
clinical response of “cure.” 
B The clinical success rate at the EOIV visit was defined as the proportion of participants in the analysis population who had a clinical 
response of “cure” or “partial improvement.” The definition for clinical success at the EOIV visit included “partial improvement” to 
accommodate those participants with partial improvement who were switched to oral step-down therapy at this time point. For 
participants who received IV study treatment only (without optional oral step-down therapy), a separate assessment was not performed 
at the EOT visit; the EOIV visit served as the EOT visit.

a The per-pathogen microbiological outcome was determined for each baseline infecting pathogen isolated by the Sponsor. 
B Eradication or presumed eradication was considered favorable microbiological responses. In order for the participant to have a 
favorable overall microbiological response (i.e., eradication or presumed eradication), it was required that each baseline pathogen have 
a favorable microbiological outcome.

Analysis sets 
Safety analysis population – also called the All Participants as Treated (APaT) population: consisted of all 
randomised participants who received any amount of study treatment.  
Efficacy analyses were based on the modified intent-to treat (MITT), microbiological modified intent-to -
treat (mMITT), clinically evaluable (CE) and microbiologically evaluable (ME) populations. 
Definitions of efficacy analysis populations in P035 in cIAI 
•  MITT: the MITT population consisted of all randomised participants who received any amount of 
study treatment. Participants were categorised based on the IV study treatment that participants 
were randomised to, irrespective of what treatment they actually received. 
•  mMITT: the mMITT population was the subset of participants in the MITT population who had at 
least 1 pathogen identified from the baseline intra-abdominal culture, regardless of susceptibility 
to study treatment. 
•  CE: the CE population served as the secondary population for the analysis of clinical response 
data in this study. It was a subset of participants in the MITT population who adhered to trial 
procedures, did not have any significant protocol deviations impacting efficacy assessment and 
received a minimum number of study therapy, and had an evaluable clinical outcome at the visit 
of interest (EOT, TOC, and EOIV; an interpretable culture was not required at the visit of interest. 
All participants’ eligibility status was reviewed and determined in a blinded manner prior to final

database lock. Participants with an indeterminate clinical outcome were excluded from the CE 
population. 
•  ME: the ME population served as the secondary population for the analysis of microbiological data 
in this study. It was the subset of participants in the CE population who had at least 1 causative 
pathogen identified from the baseline intra-abdominal culture, regardless of susceptibility to study 
treatment, at the visit of interest (EOT, TOC and EOIV). 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 98 participants were screened and 94 were randomised (n=71 in the C/T+MTZ group and n=23 
in the MERO group). The majority of non-randomised participants were screen failures.  
Table 26: Disposition of participants – All randomised participants – Study P035 
The CHMP acknowledged that the majority of patients were enrolled in the older age cohorts. Of note, 
there was no patients in the age group 4 (3 months -< 2 years) and 5 (birth to < 3 months) in the MERO 
group and only 1 in each of these age groups in the C/T+MTZ group. The prevalence of cIAI is low in 
children under 6 years of age. Furthermore, in line with CHMP Addendum guideline on the evaluation of 
medicinal products indicated for treatment of bacterial infections to address paediatric-specific clinical 
data requirements, efficacy results presented in the initial marketing authorisation application for adults 
in the cIAI indication can be extrapolated to the paediatric population provided similar exposure. In 
addition, the efficacy results observed in the youngest children with AP/cUTI could be extrapolated to the 
same age cohorts for children with cIAI as these two infectious diseases are expected to have similar 
pathophysiology.

Numbers analysed 
Table 27: Summary of analysis populations – All Randomised Participants – Study P035 
The most common reason for exclusion from the CE population for the C/T+MTZ group was “no clinical 
efficacy assessment or only indeterminate clinical assessments” (4 patients, 5.6% at the EOIV, 6 
patients, 8.5% at the EOT and TOC visits) and “prior antibacterial violation” (5 patients, 7% for EOIV, 
EOT and TOC visits). Exclusions due to “concomitant antibacterial violation” comprised only 1 participant 
in all of the visits EOIV, EOT and TOC in the C/T+MTZ group. In the MERO group no patients were 
excluded due to “prior (or concomitant) antibacterial violation” and in regards to other reasons for 
exclusion it mainly affected only one patient.  
Most of the treated participants in both treatment groups completed IV study medication (65/70, 92.9% 
in the C/T+MTZ group vs. 20/21, 95.2% in the MERO group). The most common reason for 
discontinuation of IV study medication was adverse events (n=2) in the C/T+MTZ group. These AEs were 
pneumonia in one patient, and pneumonia and abdominal sepsis in the second patient. None of the Aes 
leading to discontinuation were considered by the investigator to be drug-related, please refer to the 
Safety part of this Assessment Report for more information. No participant in the MERO group 
discontinued IV study medication (i.e., 1 participant in the MERO treatment group was incorrectly 
recorded as having discontinued due to “other” reason; this subject completed IV study therapy and was 
included in efficacy assessments). 
In both treatment groups, of those participants who completed IV study medication, most switched to 
oral step-down therapy. All who switched to oral step-down therapy, apart from 1 participant in the 
C/T+MTZ group who discontinued due to lack of efficacy, completed the study. 
Of note, no patients in the age group 3 months to < 2 years completed treatment (the one patient in the 
C/T+MTZ group who received treatment discontinued due to physician decision), and there was only one 
patient completing the treatment in the age group birth to < 3 months (in the C/T+MTZ group).  
Recruitment 
First participant first visit was 03 April 2018, last participant last visit was 16 March 2020, and database 
lock date was 22 January 2021. 
Twenty-seven (27) centers in 11 countries randomised and enrolled participants into the study (number 
of patients randomised): Brazil (1), Hungary (11), Lithuania (8), Malaysia (3), Mexico (16), Russia (7), 
South Africa (6), Spain (10), Turkey (2), Ukraine (12) and the US (18).

Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
The original protocol, dated 21-MAR-2017, was amended 3 times. Main changes in the planned conduct of 
the study implemented by protocol amendment(s) are shown below. 
The CHMP noted that all the amendments were implemented after the first subject first visit. 
Amendment 1: In Ukraine, meropenem is not approved for use in children < 3 months of age and 
metronidazole is not approved for use in children < 2 years of age, therefore in this country enrolment 
was limited to subjects > 2 years old. 
Amendment 2: enrolment targets for age groups 3-5 were applied across studies P034 (AP/cUTI) and 
P035 (cIAI) and thus patients from both studies would be pooled for the safety analysis. The PDCO 
agreed with the proposal of a pooled safety analysis in order to overcome the limitation imposed by the 
scarce number of young children with cIAI. However, it was pointed out that sufficient patients with cIAI 
should be included as cIAI can be of a more severe nature than AP/cUTI. 
Furthermore, Amendment 2 also comprised an increase of the maximum percentage of patients enrolled 
with complicated appendicitis from 60% to 90%. This change was also approved by the PDCO.  
Amendment 3: the sample size of the two studies P034 and P035 were reduced due to recruitment 
difficulties in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. The MAH stated that the data gathered in the 222 
subjects (originally planned sample size was 240, with 120 patients in each study) enrolled to date 
represented a robust database with which to analyse the primary endpoint of safety. It was also pointed 
out that pursuing further enrolment to the planned 240 subjects would substantially delay the finalising of 
the studies without any appreciable improvement in the ability of the study to achieve the goals of 
assessing the safety, PK and efficacy.  
In addition, the MAH wanted to delete the requirement in study P035 that at least 10% of patients 
evaluable for primary analysis must have a diagnosis other than acute complicated appendicitis. 
The PDCO acknowledged the MAH’s arguments regarding recruitment issues due to COVID-19. 
Furthermore, the Committee concluded that the proposed reduced overall number of patients likely was 
acceptable and sufficient to draw conclusions on safety in the paediatric population. Moreover, in light of 
the already reduced patient numbers the PDCO also tended to agree with the requested deletion of the 
requirement that at least 10% of patients in study P035 must have a diagnosis other than acute 
complicated appendicitis. It was acknowledged that recruiting these patients were difficult and the MAH 
had made reasonable efforts to boost recruitment.

Protocol deviations 
Important protocol deviations were reported for 22 (31.4%) participants in the C/T+MTZ group, and 7 
(33.3%) participants in the MERO group. 
No important protocol deviations were classified as a serious GCP compliance issue.

The CHMP noted that, for some of the demographic and baseline characteristics, there were imbalances 
between the two treatment groups. The proportion of males was for instance much higher in the C/T+ 
MTZ group (67.6%) than in the MERO group (34.8%). 
Overall, the majority of the patients was predominantly white, European, males with a median age of 8.2 
years in the C/T+MTZ group and 8.5 years in the MERO group and had normal renal function. Only 1 
patient in each of the two age groups 3 months - < 2 years and birth - < 3 months was included in the 
study, and both was in the C/T+MTZ group.  
Almost all patients in both treatment arms had a baseline diagnosis of complicated appendicitis (in total 
65 patients [91.5%] in the C/T+MTZ arm vs. 22 patients [95.7%] in the MERO arm). However, as 
previously mentioned, this was accepted by the PDCO (please refer to the section above “Conduct of the 
study”). In total there were 6 participants (all in the C/T+MTZ group) enrolled with a diagnosis of other 
Assessment report  
EMA/644705/2022 
Page 82/127 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cIAI (3 with intra-abdominal abscess, 2 with diffuse peritonitis, and 1 with perforated jejunum/ileum and 
diffuse peritonitis). 
Only 2 patients in total (both in the C/T+MTZ group) had bacteraemia at baseline. 
Baseline microbiology 
The most common gram-negative pathogens (C/T+MTZ; MERO) were Escherichia coli (47 [67.1%]; 13 
[61.9%]), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19 [27.1%]; 6 [28.6%]), and Bacteroides fragilis (13 [18.6%]; 4 
[19.0%]). Both study treatments were active against all isolates of these 3 organisms. 
The CHMP considered that the pathogens isolated at baseline reflect the pattern of pathogens most 
commonly detected for intra-abdominal infections.  
Overall, there were no baseline isolates tested that were reported as being non-susceptible to either of 
the study drugs received. 
Concomitant antibiotic medications 
Between the first dose of IV study medication and the EOT visit, 1 participant in the C/T+MTZ group 
(none in the MERO group) received concomitant non-study antibiotic therapy (excluding a protocol-
allowed single dose of prophylactic antibiotics); this participant received both cefotaxime sodium and 
MTZ. 
Between the first dose of IV study medication and the TOC visit, 2 participants in the C/T+MTZ group and 
1 participant in the MERO group received at least 1 dose of concomitant antibiotic therapy; this included 
participants who received protocol-allowed antibiotic prophylaxis after the EOT visit. 
In the view of the MAH, only one patient in the C/T+MTZ group (and none in the MERO group) was 
excluded from the CE population due to “concomitant antibacterial violation”. Regarding “prior 
antibacterial violation”, it was 5 patients in the C/T+MTZ group (vs. none in the MERO group) that were 
excluded. One patient from each of the two study arms was excluded due to “confounding antibacterial 
post-treatment” (at TOC).  
The CHMP noted that participants who received non-study antibiotics that were stopped on the same date 
as the first dose of IV study medication or started on the same date as the EOT or TOC visit date (for 
which a start or stop time for the non-study antibiotic was not recorded), were not included as having 
received concomitant antibiotics. With this approach, it cannot be excluded that the non-study antibiotics 
might have had an effect on the study treatment for these patients. However, considering that the 
efficacy should be extrapolated from adults, this issue was not further pursued in the context of efficacy. 
Extent of exposure 
The median (range) number of IV treatment doses was comparable between participants in the C/T+MTZ 
(19 [0.5-42.0]) and MERO (18 [7.0-26.0]) treatment groups. 
The median (range) duration of IV treatment was comparable between participants in the C/T+MTZ (6.3 
[0.3 to 14.0] days) and MERO (6.0 [2.3 to 8.8] days) treatment groups, with the majority of participants 
in both the C/T+MTZ (55.7%) and MERO (71.4%) groups receiving IV treatment for >3 to ≤7 days (for 
the latter: data not shown). 
Assessment report  
EMA/644705/2022 
Page 83/127 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The median (range) duration of overall treatment (i.e., IV only or IV + oral) was generally comparable 
between participants in the C/T+MTZ (10.0 [0.3 to 18.3] days) and MERO (8.0 [4.3 to 14.8] days) 
treatment groups. 
For those participants who switched to oral step-down treatment (C/T+MTZ: 35/70 [50%]; MERO: 12/21 
[57%]), the median (range) duration of oral treatment was comparable between participants in the 
C/T+MTZ (6.3 [0.5 to 10.0] days) and MERO (5.2 [1.3 to 10.1] days) treatment groups. The most 
common oral step-down treatments (>10% in either treatment group) were metronidazole, 
amoxicillin/clavulanate, and ciprofloxacin. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Compliance with the overall treatment regimen (both IV and oral step-down) in the MITT population was 
high in both treatment groups with only 1 participant in the study being ≤80% compliant with the overall 
treatment.  
Table 29: Clinical response by visit – MITT population – Study P035 
The CHMP noted that in the MITT population at TOC, 56/70 patients (80.0%) in the C/T+MTZ group and 
21/21 patients (100.0%) in the MERO group had a favourable clinical response. Clinical success rates at 
the EOT visit were consistent with those reported at the TOC visit. It is noted that the clinical response 
rates were lower in the C/T+MTZ group compared to the MERO group. The MAH attributed that to the fact 
that the difference in clinical success may have been driven in part by a particularly high cure rate in the 
MERO group rather than by a lower than-expected efficacy in the C/T+MTZ group. The clinical response 
rates in the C/T+MTZ group were comparable to those in the MITT population for the pivotal Phase 3 
study in adults (submitted in connection with the application for marketing authorisation for Zerbaxa), 
which demonstrated the non-inferiority of C/T+MTZ to MERO in adult participants with cIAI (C/T+MTZ: 
83.0%; MERO: 87.3%). In addition, the MAH pointed out that in the C/T+MTZ group of the MITT 
population, 6 of the 14 clinical failures were indeterminate responses (e.g., participant was lost to follow-
up or a clinical assessment was unable to be made for other reasons); in this intention-to-treat 
population, these participants were considered failures. The MAH’s points were acknowledged by the 
Committee. 
As for the AP/cUTI-study (P034) the efficacy results at the TOC visit will not solely reflect the effect of 
C/T+MTZ or MERO, but also the effect from the oral step-down antibiotic therapy. In the P035 (cIAI) 
Assessment report  
EMA/644705/2022 
Page 84/127 
 
 
 
 
 
 
study, it was 35/70 patients in the C/T+MTZ group and 12/21 patients in the MERO group (safety 
analysis population) who received oral step-down antibiotic treatment. However, it is noted that data 
from the MITT population at the EOIV visit showed high clinical responses in both treatment groups 
(61/70 patients [87.1%] in the C/T+MTZ group vs. 21/21 patients [100.0%] in the MERO group had a 
favourable clinical response). Of note though, the main part of the patients in both arms had partial 
improvement (35/70 patients, 50% in the C/T+MTZ arm vs. 12/21 patients, 57.1% in the MERO arm) 
meaning that these patients were not cured but required further oral step-down therapy. 
Furthermore, as this study was descriptive in nature, it was not powered for inferential testing and was 
intended to provide descriptive statistics only. Based on the 3:1 randomisation, meaningful interpretation 
of direct comparisons is not possible. Consequently, no further issues regarding the efficacy results were 
pursued. The basis for approval of this variation relies on the PK and safety data, not efficacy. 
Clinical success rates by age group (in groups with >1 participant) were generally consistent with the 
overall clinical success rates by treatment group, i.e., between treatment groups, within each age group, 
and across age groups.  
Table 30: Clinical response at TOC visit – CE population – Study P035 
In the CE population at TOC, 52/58 patients (89.7%) in the C/T+MTZ group and 19/19 patients (100.0%) 
in the MERO group had a favourable clinical response. 
The clinical success rates at the EOT and EOIV visits in the CE population were consistent with those 
reported at the TOC visit (data not shown).  
The same pattern as observed for the MITT population was seen, the clinical success rates were high, but 
lower in the C/T + MTZ group compared to in the MERO group. 
The clinical response rates in the individual cohorts were in general consistent with that observed in the 
overall study population (data not shown). 
In the mMITT population at TOC, the microbiological success rates were also lower in the C/T+MTZ group 
compared to the MERO group as, 53/63 patients (84.1%) in the C/T+MTZ group vs. 19/19 patients 
(100.0%) in the MERO group, had microbiological success. The microbiological success rates at the EOT 
visit were consistent with those reported at the TOC visit. At the EOIV visit the microbiological success 
rates were 57/63, 90.5% in the C/T+MTZ arm vs. 19/19, 100% in the MERO arm. 
The microbiological response rates in the individual cohorts were in general consistent with that observed 
in the overall study population (data not shown). 
Most microbiological outcomes were presumed eradicated based on clinical response, showing a similar 
pattern to the per-patient clinical response for the pathogens isolated. For cIAI, it is not unexpected that 
the microbiological eradication rates are mostly based on presumptions.

The microbiological response rates in the ME population were in general consistent with that observed in 
the mMITT population (data not shown).  
Emergent infections 
In the C/T+MTZ group, 1 participant had a superinfection (P. aeruginosa), and 1 participant had a new 
infection (Klebsiella pneumoniae). No participants in the MERO group had a superinfection or new 
infection.

Title: A Phase 2, Randomised, Active Comparator-Controlled, Multicenter, Double-Blind Clinical Trial to Study the 
Safety and Efficacy of Ceftolozane/Tazobactam (MK‑7625A) Versus Meropenem in Paediatric Subjects with 
Complicated Urinary Tract Infection, Including Pyelonephritis 
Study identifier 
Protocol Number: P034 (MK‑7625A-034) 
IND: 104,490 
EudraCT: 2016-004153-32 
Design 
This was a Phase 2 randomised, active comparator-controlled, multicenter, double-blind study 
evaluating the safety and efficacy of ceftolozane/tazobactam (C/T) versus meropenem (MERO) in 
paediatric participants from birth to <18 years of age with complicated urinary tract infection 
(cUTI), including pyelonephritis. 
Eligible participants in P034 were randomised in a 3:1 ratio to receive intravenous (IV) C/T or 
MERO, respectively, with stratification by age group: 
Group 1 (Ages 12 to <18 years): 
Ceftolozane 1 g and tazobactam 0.5 g IV every 8 hours OR 
MERO 20 m g/kg (maximum of 1 g/dose) IV every 8 hours 
Group 2 (Ages 6 to <12 years): 
Ceftolozane 20 mg/kg and tazobactam 10 mg/kg (maximum ceftolozane 1 g and tazobactam 
0.5 g/dose) IV every 8 hours OR 
MERO 20 mg/kg (maximum of 1 g/dose) IV every 8 hours 
Group 3 (Ages 2 to <6 years): 
Ceftolozane 20 mg/kg and tazobactam 10 mg/kg (maximum ceftolozane 1 g and tazobactam 
0.5 g/dose) IV every 8 hours OR 
MERO 20 mg/kg (maximum of 1 g/dose) IV every 8 hours 
Group 4 (Ages 3 months to <2 years): 
Ceftolozane 20 mg/kg and tazobactam 10 mg/kg (maximum ceftolozane 1 g and tazobactam 
Assessment report

Page 86/127 
 
 
 
 
 
 
0.5 g/dose) IV every 8 hours OR 
MERO 20 mg/kg (maximum of 1 g/dose) IV every 8 hours 
Group 5 (Ages birth [>32 weeks gestational age and ≥7 days postnatal] to <3 months): 
Ceftolozane 20 mg/kg and tazobactam 10 mg/kg (maximum ceftolozane 1 g and tazobactam 
0.5 g/dose) IV every 8 hours OR 
MERO 20 mg/kg (maximum of 1 g/dose) IV every 8 hours 
After receiving at least 9 doses of double-blind IV study treatment, participants in either treatment 
arm may have switched to open-label, standard-of-care oral step-down antibiotic therapy at the 
investigator’s discretion. Oral step-down therapy was considered study treatment. 
Recommendations for oral step-down therapy were BL/BLI combination, cephalosporin, 
quinolone, nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. 
Design 
The total duration of study treatment (IV only or IV + oral) was a minimum of 7 days and a 
maximum of 14 days. 
Duration of main phase: 
After a screening phase of up to 48 hours, each participant 
received study treatment (IV only or IV + oral) for a minimum of 
7 to a maximum of 14 days. After the end of treatment (EOT), 
each participant entered a follow-up phase consisting of a Test of 
Cure (TOC) Visit 5 to 9 days after the last dose of study 
treatment and a Last Follow-up (LFU) Visit 28 to 35 days after 
the last dose of study treatment. 
Of note: efficacy data beyond the TOC visit were not collected in 
these paediatric studies.

Results and Analysis 
Analysis description 
A 2-sided 95% CI based on the Miettinen and Nurminen method (1985) (M&N) and 
stratified by age group was provided to evaluate the treatment differences for (1) clinical 
success at the EOT and TOC Visits and (2) per-participant microbiological eradication at 
the EOT and TOC Visits. There was no efficacy hypothesis testing in this estimation study. 
Analysis population and 
time point description 
Efficacy analyses of data in this study were based on 3 efficacy analysis populations 
defined as: 
•  Microbiological modified intent-to-treat (mMITT): subset of randomized 
participants who received any amount of study treatment and had at least 1 
acceptable causative uropathogen identified from a study-qualifying baseline urine 
culture. Participants were categorized based on the IV study treatment to which 
they were randomized, irrespective of what they actually received. 
•  Clinically evaluable (CE): subset of the mMITT population who adhered to study 
procedures, did not have any significant protocol deviations impacting efficacy 
assessment, and received a minimum amount of study therapy. An interpretable 
urine culture was not required at the visit of interest and all participants had an 
evaluable clinical outcome at the visit of interest. All participants’ eligibility status 
were reviewed and determined in a blinded manner before final database lock. 
•  Microbiologically evaluable (ME): subset of the CE population who had an 
interpretable urine culture at the visit of interest within the visit window.

Design 
This was a Phase 2 randomised, active comparator-controlled, multicenter, double-blind study 
evaluating the safety and efficacy of C/T plus metronidazole (MTZ) versus MERO plus placebo in 
paediatric participants from birth to <18 years of age with complicated intra-abdominal infection 
(cIAI). 
Eligible participants were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive IV C/T plus MTZ or comparator 
(MERO+placebo) treatment arm administered as a 60-minute (±10 minutes) infusion as follows: 
Group 1 (Ages 12 to <18 years): 
Ceftolozane 1 g and tazobactam 0.5 g IV every 8 hours and metronidazole 10 mg/kg IV every 8 
hours (maximum dose 1.5 g/day) 
OR 
MERO 20 mg/kg (maximum of 1 g/dose) IV every 8 hours and placebo for metronidazole IV every 
8 hours 
Group 2 (Ages 6 to <12 years): 
Ceftolozane 20 mg/kg and tazobactam 10 mg/kg (maximum ceftolozane 1 g and tazobactam 
0.5 g/dose) IV every 8 hours and metronidazole 10 mg/kg IV every 8 hours (maximum dose 
1.5 g/day) 
OR 
MERO 20 mg/kg (maximum of 1 g/dose) IV every 8 hours and placebo for metronidazole IV every 
8 hours 
Group 3 (Ages 2 to <6 years): 
Ceftolozane 20 mg/kg and tazobactam 10 mg/kg (maximum ceftolozane 1 g and tazobactam 
0.5 g/dose) IV every 8 hours and metronidazole 10 mg/kg IV every 8 hours (maximum dose 
1.5 g/day) 
OR 
MERO 20 mg/kg (maximum of 1 g/dose) IV every 8 hours and placebo for metronidazole IV every 
8 hours 
Group 4 (Ages 3 months to <2 years): 
Ceftolozane 20 mg/kg and tazobactam 10 mg/kg (maximum ceftolozane 1 g and tazobactam 
0.5 g/dose) IV every 8 hours and metronidazole 10 mg/kg IV every 8 hours (maximum dose 
1.5 g/day) 
OR 
MERO 20 mg/kg (maximum of 1 g/dose) IV every 8 hours and placebo for metronidazole IV every 
8 hours 
Group 5 (Ages birth [>32 weeks gestational age and ≥7 days postnatal] to <3 months): 
Ceftolozane 20 mg/kg and tazobactam 10 mg/kg (maximum ceftolozane 1 g and tazobactam 
0.5 g/dose) IV every 8 hours and metronidazole IV every 8 to 12 hours (for details, please refer to 
the description of Study P035 under the Efficacy part of the Assessment Report). 
OR 
MERO 20 mg/kg (maximum of 1 g/dose) IV every 8 hours and placebo for metronidazole IV every 
8 hours. 
After receiving at least 9 doses of double-blind IV study treatment, participants in either treatment 
arm may have switched to open-label, standard-of-care oral step-down antibiotic therapy at the 
investigator’s discretion. Oral step-down therapy was considered study treatment. 
Recommendations for oral step-down therapy were BL/BLI combinations, 2. Or 3. Generation 
cephalosporin in combination with metronidazole or quinolone (ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin 
should be used in combination with metronidazole).

The total duration of study treatment (IV only or IV + oral) is a minimum of 5 days and a maximum 
of 14 days. 
Duration of main phase: 
After a screening phase of up to 48 hours, each participant received 
study treatment (IV only or IV + oral) for a minimum of 5 days to a 
maximum of 14 days. After the EOT, each participant entered a 
follow-up phase consisting of a TOC Visit 7 to 14 days after the last 
dose of study treatment and a LFU Visit 21 to 28 days after the last 
dose of study treatment. 
Of note: efficacy data beyond the TOC visit were not collected in 
these paediatric studies.

Results and Analysis 
Analysis description 
A 2-sided 95% CI based on the M&N method and stratified by age group was provided to evaluate 
(1) the treatment differences for clinical success at the EOT and TOC Visits and (2) per-participant 
microbiological eradication at the EOT and TOC Visits. 
Analysis population 
and time point 
description 
Efficacy analyses of data in this study were based on 4 analysis populations defined as: 
•  Modified intent-to-treat (MITT): all randomized participants who received any amount of 
study treatment. Participants were categorized based on the IV study treatment to which 
participants were randomized, irrespective of what treatment they received. 
•  mMITT: subset of participants in the MITT population who had at least 1 pathogen 
identified from the baseline intra-abdominal culture, regardless of susceptibility to study 
treatment. 
•  CE: subset of participants in the MITT population who adhered to study procedures, did not 
have any significant protocol deviations impacting efficacy assessment, and received a 
minimum amount of study therapy, and had a clinical outcome at the visit of interest; an 
interpretable culture was not required at the visit of interest. All participants’ eligibility 
status were reviewed and determined in a blinded manner before final database lock. 
•  ME: subset of participants in the CE population who had at least 1 causative pathogen 
identified from the baseline intra-abdominal culture.

4.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
This application is intended to broaden the approved indications of Zerbaxa (ceftolozane/tazobactam) for 
adults: acute pyelonephritis (AP), complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) and complicated intra-
abdominal infections (cIAI), to include paediatric population from birth (defined as >32 weeks gestational 
age and ≥7 days postnatal) to <18 years of age.  
According to draft “Addendum to the guideline on the evaluation of medicinal products indicated for 
treatment of bacterial infections to address paediatric-specific clinical data requirements 
(EMA/187859/2017)”, no appropriately powered efficacy study is requested in the paediatric population. 
Efficacy can be extrapolated from data in adults provided that similar exposure of ceftolozane/tazobactam 
is achieved and a sufficiently amount of safety data is collected in the paediatric age groups. It is 
therefore the safety and PK data that are critical to the final outcome of this assessment. 
Consequently, the efficacy data described below in this submission are only descriptive and this is 
considered acceptable. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The MAH conducted two phase 2 studies that aimed to include children from birth to less than 18 years of 
age with cIAI (study P035) and AP/cUTI (study P034). The studies were double-blind, randomised, 
multicentre and active-controlled studies, in which efficacy was defined as a secondary objective, and 
hence were not powered to determine efficacy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/644705/2022 
Page 93/127 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
Participants were randomised 3:1 and stratified by 5 age groups (12 to < 18 years, 6 to < 12 years, 2 to 
< 6 years, 3 months to < 2 years and birth to < 3 months) to receive double-blind IV 
ceftolozane/tazobactam (C/T) ± metronidazole (MTZ) or meropenem (MERO) for at least 9 doses (~3 
days), after which participants in either group could be switched to open-label, standard-of-care oral 
step-down antibiotic therapy at the investigator’s discretion. 
The proposed treatment duration (5-14 days for cIAI and 7-14 days for AP/cUTI) and the option to switch 
to oral therapy, is generally in line with current guidance (IDSA guideline 2010 and World Society of 
Emergency Surgery guidelines 2017 for management of intra-abdominal infections and The EAU/ 
European Society for Paediatric Urology guidelines for UTI in children). 
Dose. Paediatric participants from 12 to <18 years of age with cIAI and AP/cUTI received the adult fixed 
dose of 1.5 g C/T (1 g ceftolozane and 0.5 g tazobactam); children <12 years of age, including neonates, 
received a weight-based dosing regimen of 30 mg/kg C/T (20 mg/kg ceftolozane and 10 mg/kg 
tazobactam) that did not exceed the adult fixed dose of 1.5 g C/T (1 g ceftolozane and 0.5 g 
tazobactam). 
Comparator. Meropenem was chosen as comparator in both studies. While meropenem is approved in 
Europe for treating paediatric patients (i.e., ≥ 3 months of age) in both indications, it is a broad-spectrum 
antibiotic and should thus preferably be reserved for use in severe, multidrug-resistant and complicated 
infections. Notwithstanding this, it is acknowledged that there is increasing resistance towards narrow-
spectrum antibiotics worldwide, and hence the use of meropenem might be justified in some cases also 
for cUTI (cIAI can be of a more severe nature than cUTI). The MAH’s viewpoint that the use of the same 
comparator in the two trials P034 and P035 would allow for a larger sized safety database by pooling the 
data from these two trials was acceptable to the CHMP, especially considering that safety was the primary 
endpoint for these studies.  
For paediatric patients under 3 months of age, safety and efficacy data of meropenem are limited, and 
the optimal dose regimen for this age group has not been identified. However, the off-label dose used in 
the studies (20 mg/kg with the possibility to increase to 30mg/kg at the investigator’s discretion) seems 
to be in line with data from current available publications (Fasugba et al, 2015; Cohen-Wolkowiez et al, 
2012). 
For cIAI metronidazole was added to the treatment with C/T for anaerobic coverage, and this is in line 
with clinical recommendations. Data on the PK and ideal dosing of metronidazole in paediatric patients 
are limited, especially for paediatric patients less than 1 month of age, however, the chosen doses for the 
youngest children seem, overall, in line with what is commonly recommended. 
Sample size/statistical methods. There were no prespecified statistical hypotheses for this trial. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints were included to provide point estimates of the efficacy of each treatment 
regimen; the study was not powered for formal hypothesis testing of between treatment group 
comparisons. 
A combined sample size of 240 participants was originally planned to be enrolled across the two studies. 
However, due to enrolment challenges in reaching age group, disease state, and/or country-level 
enrolment targets, and increased recruitment issues due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Sponsor 
amended the protocols to lower the target sample size with a total of 228 participants enrolled across 
both studies, i.e., a total of 134 participants in P034 and a total of 94 participants in P035. This change 
was accepted by the PDCO. Considering that the ratio was 3:1 to C/T vs. meropenem, this meant that 
101 vs. 33 patients were randomised, respectively, in the P034 trial and 71 vs. 23 patients, respectively, 
in the P035 trial.  
Assessment report  
EMA/644705/2022 
Page 94/127 
 
 
 
 
 
Protocol amendments. In addition to the reduction of the pooled sample size (see above under 
“Sample size/statistical methods”), the most important amendment was the change in Study P035 from 
an initial limit stating that maximum 60% of the enrolled patients should be diagnosed with acute 
complicated appendicitis to an increased limit of maximum of 90%, i.e., the MAH wanted to delete the 
requirement of any limit, but at the time, PDCO demanded that, in line with other PIPs covering the same 
indication, a limit of no more than 90% of the patients should have other diagnoses than complicated 
appendicitis should enforced. However, later the MAH again put forward a wish to delete the whole 
requirement. This time it was accepted by the PDCO, and the Committee acknowledged that recruiting 
these patients was difficult and that the MAH had made reasonable efforts to boost recruitment. The 
prevalence of cIAI was generally low in children under 6 years of age.   
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
- Complicated urinary tract infections including acute pyelonephritis (Study P034) 
Of 143 enrolled patients, 134 were randomised in a 3:1 ratio to receive C/T or MERO and 133 patients 
received treatment. The demographic and baseline characteristics were mainly balanced between the two 
groups. European subjects were adequately represented; predominantly Whites were included, around 
64% females with median age ca. 3.8 years in the C/T group. Most patients were diagnosed with 
pyelonephritis in both groups (80.2% in the C/T group vs. 72.7% in the MERO group). The most common 
cUTI complicating factors were recurrent UTI (40.6% in the C/T group and 30.3% in the MERO group) 
and congenital abnormality of the urogenital tract (31.7% in the C/T group vs. 24.2% in the MERO 
group).   
The paediatric age groups which received C/T were as follows: 12 to <18 years (n= 15), 6 to < 12 years 
(n= 24), 2 to < 6 years (n= 22), 3 months to < 2 years (n= 24) and birth to < 3 months (n=15).  
The most common baseline qualifying gram-negative uropathogens were Escherichia coli (C/T: 74.6%; 
MERO: 87.5%), Klebsiella pneumonia (8.5%; 4.2%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.0%; 8.3%). 
According to the MAH, no patients in either study group received concomitant non-study antibiotic 
therapy between the first dose of IV study medication and the EOT visit. However, between the first dose 
of IV study medication and the TOC visit, 25.4% (18/71) of participants in the C/T treatment group and 
16.7% (4/24) in the MERO group, received at least one dose of concomitant antibiotic therapy. This 
included participants who received protocol-allowed antibiotic prophylaxis after the EOT visit, based on 
site-level standard of care for participants at increased risk of recurrent cUTI. 
Most randomised participants in the C/T (97/101, 96.0%) treatment group and all in the MERO (33/33, 
100.0%) treatment group completed the study. Four (4.0%) patients in the C/T group discontinued the 
study vs. none in the MERO group.  
The main analysis set for the efficacy analyses was the microbiological modified intent-to-treat population 
(mMITT), which consisted of all randomised participants who received any amount of study treatment and 
had at least 1 acceptable causative uropathogen identified from a study-qualifying baseline urine culture. 
The most common reason for exclusion from the mMITT population was “did not have at least 1 qualifying 
baseline uropathogen”. In total 28.4% of the patients was excluded for this reason. 
The microbiological eradication rates were 84.5% (60/71) in the C/T treatment arm and 87.5% (21/24) 
in the MERO arm in the mMITT population at TOC. 
Clinical cure rates were 88.7% (63/71) in the C/T treatment arm and 95.8% (23/24) in the MERO arm in 
the mMITT population at TOC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/644705/2022 
Page 95/127 
 
 
 
 
 
In the microbiologically evaluable (ME) population, the microbiological eradication rates were 90.9% 
(40/44) in the C/T treatment arm and 88.2% (15/17) in the MERO arm at TOC. 
- Complicated intra-abdominal infection (Study P035) 
Of 98 enrolled patients, 94 were randomised in a 3:1 ratio to receive C/T + MTZ or MERO and 91 
received treatment. The demographic and baseline characteristics were mainly balanced between the two 
groups. European subjects were adequately represented; predominantly Whites were included, ca. 68% 
males with median age 8.2 years in the C/T+MTZ group. In total, it was only 6 patients (all in the 
C/T+MTZ group) enrolled with diagnoses of other cIAI than complicated appendicitis.  
The number of patients in the various paediatric age groups who received C/T+MTZ were as follows: 12 
to <18 years (n= 16), 6 to < 12 years (n=30), 2 to < 6 years (n= 22), 3 months to < 2 years (n=1) and 
birth to < 3 months (n=1).  Of note, only 1 patient was included in each of the two youngest age cohorts, 
and of these two, only one (in the age group birth – to < 3 months) completed the study. However, the 
efficacy results presented in the initial MA application for the adult cIAI indication can be extrapolated to 
the paediatric population provided similar exposure of ceftolozane/tazobactam. In addition, efficacy 
observed in the youngest AP/cUTI children could be extrapolated to the same age cohorts for the cIAI 
patients as these two infectious diseases are expected to have similar pathophysiology. 
A high proportion of the randomised patients completed the trial (94% in the C/T+MTZ arm vs. 87% in 
the MERO arm). According to the MAH, very few patients in both study arms received concomitant non-
study antibiotic therapy between the first dose of IV study medication and the EOT visit and the TOC visit 
(maximum 2 patients).  
The main analysis set for the efficacy analyses was the modified intent-to-treat population (MITT), which 
consisted of all randomised participants who received any amount of study treatment. Clinical cure rates 
were 80.0% (56/70 patients) in the C/T+MTZ treatment arm and 100.0% (21/21 patients) in the MERO 
arm in the MITT population at TOC. 
In the clinically evaluable (CE) population, the cure rates were 89.7% (52/58) in the C/T+MTZ arm and 
100.0% (19/19) in the MERO arm at TOC.  
In the microbiological modified intent-to-treat (mMITT) population at TOC, 53/63 patients (84.1%) in the 
C/T+MTZ group vs. 19/19 patients (100.0%) in the MERO group, had microbiological success (i.e., as 
usual for cIAI most microbiological outcomes were presumed eradicated based on clinical response). 
It is noted that the rates were lower in the C/T+MTZ group compared to the MERO group. The MAH refers 
to that the difference in clinical success may have been driven in part by a particularly high cure rate in 
the MERO group rather than by a lower than expected efficacy in the C/T+MTZ group. The clinical 
response rates in the C/T+MTZ group were comparable to those in the MITT population for the pivotal 
Phase 3 study in adults (submitted in connection with the application for marketing authorisation for 
Zerbaxa), which demonstrated the non-inferiority of C/T+MTZ to MERO in adult participants with cIAI 
(C/T+MTZ: 83.0%; MERO: 87.3%). In addition, the MAH points out that in the C/T+MTZ group of the 
MITT population, 6 of the 14 clinical failures were indeterminate responses; in this intention-to-treat 
population, these participants were considered failures. The MAH’s points are acknowledged. 
Furthermore, as this study was descriptive in nature, it was not powered for inferential testing and was 
intended to provide descriptive statistics only. Based on the 3:1 randomisation, meaningful interpretation 
of direct comparisons is not possible. Consequently, no further issues regarding these efficacy results will 
be discussed. 
Of note for both studies: the efficacy results at the TOC visit will not solely reflect the effect of C/T or 
MERO, but also the effect from the oral step-down antibiotic therapy. In the P034 study, it was 51/100 
patients in the C/T group and 20/33 patients in the MERO group who received oral step-down antibiotic

treatment while in the P035 study it was 35/70 patients in the C/T+MTZ group and 12/21 patients in the 
MERO group (safety analysis population). Notwithstanding this, it is noticed that the results of the 
exploratory efficacy endpoint clinical success at the EOIV (end of IV treatment) visit showed high 
response rates in both treatment groups in both studies. It should be taken into account though that a 
large proportion of the patients in both arms in both studies was only partially improved. This implies that 
they were not in need of further IV antibiotic treatment for their infection, but additional treatment in the 
form of oral step-down therapy was still required. It is acknowledged that there are some uncertainties 
with regards to the use of oral step-down antibiotic therapy in these studies (e.g., variations in type of 
oral agent chosen by the investigator, duration of treatment). However, this issue was not further 
pursued considering that the efficacy data are not critical for this application. Furthermore, the choice of 
oral agents will also be dependent on the susceptibility of specific antibiotics, as well as the availability of 
the agents, in different countries and regions.  
4.5.3.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
Overall, available efficacy data from paediatric patients are limited, and for children < 3 months of age 
with cIAI, there was only 1 patient who completed the treatment (belonging to the age group birth to < 3 
months in the C/T+MTZ group).  
Although the available data do not seem to deviate in any major way from the adult efficacy data, they 
are not intended for providing any sound evidence in support of efficacy and/or adequacy of the proposed 
dose regimen. The efficacy of ceftolozane/tazobactam is expected to be similar in children, given that 
available PK data indicate similar exposures in children and adults. Thus, the basis for approval of this 
variation lies on the PK and safety data, not efficacy. 
4.6.   Clinical safety 
Safety data presented in this application for the paediatric indication extension  
This safety assessment summarizes the safety findings from 2 completed Phase 2 studies (P034 and 
P035) and 1 completed Phase 1 study (P010, mentioned above), which is submitted in support for the 
extension of indication application for the use of ceftolozane/tazobactam (C/T; also known as MK-7625A) 
in complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI), including pyelonephritis, and complicated intra-abdominal 
infections (cIAI) indications in paediatric participants from birth (defined as >32 weeks gestational age 
and ≥7 days postnatal) to <18 years of age. These three studies randomized 271 paediatric participants 
<18 years of age across 73 clinical study sites in 20 countries, of which 207 paediatric participants 
received at least 1 dose of C/T in the 3 paediatric studies.  
Study MK-7625A-010 (P010 or CXA-PEDS-13-08, described above); Phase 1, non-comparative, open-
label study to characterize the pharmacokinetics of a single intravenous dose of ceftolozane/tazobactam 
in paediatric patients receiving standard of care antibiotic therapy for proven or suspected gram-negative 
infection or for peri-operative prophylaxis) was submitted as an Article 46 application. Overall, 43 
patients were enrolled, of which 37 were treated with C/T. CHMP review was completed in January 2018.  
The present application for extension of indication to include children presents a summary of pooled 
safety data from these two Phase 2 paediatric studies: 
•  Study MK-7625A-034 (P034): A Phase 2, Randomized, Active Comparator-Controlled, 
Multicenter, Double-Blind Clinical Trial to Study the Safety and Efficacy of 
Ceftolozane/Tazobactam (MK-7625A) Versus Meropenem in Paediatric Subjects with Complicated 
Urinary Tract Infection, Including Pyelonephritis 
Assessment report  
EMA/644705/2022 
Page 97/127 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Study MK 7625A-035 (P035): A Phase 2, Randomized, Active Comparator-Controlled, 
Multicenter, Double-Blind Clinical Trial to Study the Safety and Efficacy of 
Ceftolozane/Tazobactam (MK-7625A) Plus Metronidazole Versus Meropenem in Paediatric 
Subjects with Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infection 
The primary endpoint for both studies was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of C/T plus MTZ 
compared with that of MERO.  
Paediatric participants from 12 to <18 years of age with cIAI and AP/cUTI received the adult fixed dose of 
1.5 g C/T (1 g ceftolozane and 0.5 g tazobactam); children <12 years of age, including neonates, 
received a weight-based dosing regimen of 30 mg/kg C/T (20 mg/kg ceftolozane and 10 mg/kg 
tazobactam) that did not exceed the adult fixed dose of 1.5 g C/T (1 g ceftolozane and 0.5 g 
tazobactam). 
According to Draft guideline EMA/187859/2017 “Addendum to guideline on the evaluation of medicinal 
products indicated for treatment of bacterial infections to address paediatric-specific clinical data 
requirements”, no appropriately powered efficacy studies are requested in the paediatric population as 
efficacy can be extrapolated from adults provided that similar exposure is achieved in the paediatric 
population. Furthermore, sufficient safety data have to be generated with the intended dose regimen in 
the paediatric population. In both the paediatric phase 2 studies submitted to support the indication 
extensions, safety and tolerability are primary endpoint, while pharmacokinetic and efficacy variables are 
secondary. In addition, one phase 1 study was submitted.  
This CHMP safety assessment is based on 2 completed Phase 2 paediatric studies (P034 and P035) in the 
indications AP/cUTI and cIAI, and 1 completed Phase 1 study (P010). These clinical studies represent 
data from 207 paediatric participants who received at least 1 dose of C/T in the 3 paediatric studies, 
including 170 participants in the multi-dose Phase 2 studies (100 and 70 in the studies P034 and P035, 
respectively), and 37 participants in the single-dose study P010. It is indeed a limited safety database, 
but acceptable in this setting in the paediatric population. This safety evaluation presents a summary of 
the safety data and emphasises the pooled safety data from the two phase 2 studies which concerns the 
target population, regarding age, therapeutic indication and duration of treatment. Details from the 
individual studies are presented when applicable.  
4.6.1.  Patient exposure 
Overall Safety Evaluation Plan 
An overview is provided of the safety profile of ceftolozane/tazobactam (C/T, also known as MK-7625A) 
for the treatment of paediatric participants, from birth (defined as >32 weeks gestational age and ≥7 days 
postnatal) to <18 years of age, with cUTI (including pyelonephritis), or cIAI.  
Safety data from 3 clinical studies are provided; 2 completed Phase 2 studies (MK-7625A-034 and 
MK-7625A-035, hereafter referred to as P034 and P035), and a completed Phase 1 PK study (MK-7625A-
010, hereafter referred to as P010). Safety data from P034 and P035 were integrated as both studies 
used a blinded study design, enrolled an acutely ill paediatric population, and used meropenem (MERO) 
as the comparator. Data from P010 were not integrated with P034 and P035, and are presented 
separately, as the open-label, single dose study design could have led to bias making interpretation of the 
pooled data challenging.

The evaluation of safety and tolerability of C/T compared with meropenem (MERO) in paediatric 
participants was the primary objective for the studies P034 and P035. Key design features are presented 
in the table below.  
In P034 and P035, paediatric participants 12 to <18 years of age with AP/cUTI and cIAI received the 
adult fixed dose of 1.5 g C/T (1 g ceftolozane and 0.5 g tazobactam); participants <12 years of age, 
including neonates, received a weight-based dosing regimen of 30 mg/kg C/T (20 mg/kg ceftolozane and 
10 mg/kg tazobactam) that did not exceed the adult fixed dose of 1.5 g C/T.  
For both studies, paediatric participants were divided according to 5 age groups:  
Age Groups: 
•  Group 1: 12 to <18 years  
•  Group 2: 6 to <12 years 
•  Group 3: 2 to <6 years 
•  Group 4: 3 months to <2 years 
•  Group 5: birth to <3 months 
Eligible participants were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive intravenous (IV) C/T (±MTZ) or 
MERO (± placebo), respectively, with stratification by age group, see tables below:

Study P010 was a Phase 1 open-label study to characterize the PK of a single IV dose of C/T in paediatric 
participants receiving standard of care antibiotic therapy for proven or suspected gram-negative infection 
or for peri-operative prophylaxis. Six age groups were assessed: 
• Group 1: ≥12 to <18 years (n=6) 
• Group 2: ≥7 to <12 years (n=6) 
• Group 3: ≥2 to <7 years (n=6) 
• Group 4: ≥3 months to <2 years (n=6) 
• Group 5: Birth (>32 weeks gestation, 7 days postnatal) to <3 months (n=7) 
• Group 6: Birth (≤32 weeks gestation, 7 days postnatal) to <3 months (n=6) 
This latter study is previously reviewed (procedure no. EMEA/H/C/003772/P46/002).  
Overall Extent of Exposure 
Disposition of Participants 
Phase 2 Studies (P034, P035, and Integrated Data) 
Overall, the disposition of participants was generally comparable between study treatment groups. 
Nearly all randomized participants received at least 1 dose of study treatment and the majority of treated 
participants completed the study. Four participants were randomized but not treated (2 from each 
treatment group). The most common reason for discontinuation of IV study medication was lack of 
qualifying event (i.e. lack of a study-qualifying baseline urine culture; C/T: 15.9%; MERO: 14.8%), all in 
the P034 study. In total 3 patients discontinued due to AEs, all on C/T (2 patients in P035, one in P034), 
please refer to section 4.6.7. Discontinuation due to adverse events for details. All but 1 participant (in 
the C/T+MTZ group of P035) who switched to oral step-down therapy completed the study.  
Phase 1 Study (P010) 
Thirty-seven (37) of the 43 enrolled participants (86.0%) received study treatment and completed the 
study.  
Duration of Exposure 
Safety data includes data from 207 paediatric participants who received at least 1 dose of C/T in 
3 studies. Of these, 170 were in the multidose Phase 2 studies (P034 and P035) and 37 were in the single 
dose Phase 1 study (P010). 
Phase 2 Studies (P034, P035, and Integrated Data) 
Overall, in the ApaT population, the median duration of exposure was generally comparable between 
treatment groups (C/T was 5.4 days [range: 0.3 to 14.0 days], and MERO was 5.0 days [range: 1.0 to 
9.7]), see table below. Study treatment duration for IV therapy, was shorter in P034 compared with 
P035, because a larger proportion of participants discontinued from study treatment due to no qualifying 
pathogen. 
In total, over half of the participants in both treatment groups (C/T: 86/170; MERO: 32/54) received oral 
step-down antibacterial medication with a median duration of 6.3 days (range: 0.5 to 10.0 days) in the 
C/T group and 5.8 days (range: 1.3 to 10.1 days) in the MERO group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/644705/2022 
Page 101/127 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The most common oral step-down antibiotic treatments (>10% in either treatment group, among all 
ApaT participants) were cefixime (C/T: 14.0%; MERO: 24.2%) in P034, and metronidazole (C/T: 22.9%; 
MERO: 23.8%), amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium (C/T: 21.4%; MERO: 9.5%), and ciprofloxacin (C/T: 
12.9%; MERO: 19.0%) in P035.  
Table 35: 3 Study Treatment Exposure All Participants as Treated Population 
Phase 1 Study (P010) 
Thirty-seven (37) participants received a single IV dose of study treatment.  
The CHMP noted that the safety analysis population for each of the 3 studies was the ApaT population 
consisting of all randomized participants who received any amount of study treatment anda includes data 
from 207 paediatric participants who received at least 1 dose of C/T. Of these, 170 were in the multidose 
Phase 2 studies (100 in P034 and 70 in P035) and 37 were in the single dose Phase 1 study P010. 
Overall, in the Phase 2 Studies (P034, P035), the disposition of participants was generally comparable 
between study treatment groups. It should be noted that there were less children in the youngest age 
group, and only one (1) patient in each of group 4 and 5 (birth to <2 years of age) in the cIAI study 
Assessment report  
EMA/644705/2022

(P035). However, this might be due to the condition of cIAI being less common at very young age and 
therefore difficult to recruit patients, and is hence, considered acceptable.  
With regard to duration of IV therapy, overall in the ApaT population, the median duration of exposure 
was generally comparable between treatment groups (C/T was 5.4 days [range: 0.3 to 14.0 days], and 
MERO was 5.0 days [range: 1.0 to 9.7]). Study treatment duration for IV therapy was, however, shorter 
in the AP/cUTI study (P034) compared with cIAI (P035), because a larger proportion of participants 
discontinued from study treatment due to no qualifying pathogen in the P034 study.  
It should also be noted that the majority of patients in both treatment groups (C/T: 86/170; MERO: 
32/54) received concomitant antibiotics; so-called oral step-down antibacterial medication, with a median 
duration of 6.3 days in the C/T group and 5.8 days in the MERO group. This approach was considered 
acceptable, albeit making the assessment of possible relationship to drug more difficult.  
Demographic and Other Characteristics of Study Population 
Phase 2 Studies (P034, P035, and Integrated Data) 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were generally comparable between treatment groups and 
consistent with those for paediatric participants with the study participants’ baseline diagnoses. 
The median age of participants was 6.01 years (range: 0.06 [23 days] to 17.56) in the C/T group and 
5.82 years (range: 0.03 [10 days] to 17.8) in the MERO group. Notably, median ages were higher in the 
P035 study than in the P034 study; cIAI is less common in younger children in comparison to AP/cUTI, 
thus P035 enrolled fewer Group 4 and 5 (birth to <2 years of age) participants. 
• The majority of participants were female, white, not Hispanic or Latino, and from Europe. 
• The majority of participants had a baseline diagnosis of pyelonephritis in P034; and complicated 
appendicitis in P035. 
• Few participants from either study had bacteremia at baseline. 
• Few participants from either study were identified by the investigator as having failed prior antibacterial 
therapy, though the majority of participants had used prior antibiotics. 
Overall, the majority of participants from both treatment groups received prior and concomitant non-
antibiotic medications, and prior non-study antibiotics. 
Overall, between the first dose of IV study medication and the EOT visit, 1 participant in each treatment 
group received a dose of concomitant non-study antibiotic therapy (excluding a protocol-allowed single 
dose of prophylactic antibiotics). 
Between the first dose of IV study medication and the TOC visit, 12.4% of participants in the C/T group 
and 11.1% in the MERO group, received at least 1 dose of concomitant non-study antibiotic therapy. Most 
of these were P034 participants who received protocol-allowed antibiotic prophylaxis after the EOT visit, 
based on site-level standard of care for participants at increased risk of recurrent cUTI. 
Participants who received non-study antibiotics that were stopped on the same date as the first dose of IV 
study medication or started on the same date as the EOT or TOC visit date (for which a start or stop time 
for the non-study antibiotic was not recorded), were not included as having received concomitant non-
study antibiotics.  
Compliance with the overall treatment regimen (both IV and oral step-down) was high in both treatment 
groups in P034 and P035.  
Assessment report

Phase 1 Study (P010) 
Nineteen (51.4%) participants were male and 18 (48.6%) were female, and the majority of participants 
(67.6%) were white. Most participants (97.3%) were receiving antibiotics for a proven or suspected 
gram-negative bacterial infection. 
4.6.2.  Adverse events  
Overview of Adverse Events 
The overall incidence of Aes (all-causality and drug-related), SAEs, and Aes leading to discontinuation, 
was comparable between the C/T and MERO treatment groups. 
The majority of participants experienced an AE; most of these were not considered by the investigator to 
be related to study treatment. There was a low incidence of SAEs, Aes leading to discontinuation, and 
SAEs leading to discontinuation. There were no drug-related SAEs, Aes leading to death, or 
discontinuations due to drug-related Aes, see overview table below. 
Table 36: Analysis of Adverse Event Summary All Participants as Treated Population Studies MK-7625A-
034 and MK-7625A-035 Combined 
The AE summary profile was generally comparable between P034 and P035 studies for both C/T and 
MERO groups with the exceptions of the incidences of Aes and SAEs which were higher in the C/T+MTZ 
group for P035 compared with the MERO group for P035; however, the incidence of drug-related Aes was 
similar between treatment groups in both studies, see table below 
Table 37: Adverse Event Summary All Participants as Treated Population 
Assessment report  
EMA/644705/2022 
Page 104/127 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The CHMP noted that the majority of participants experienced an AE. In total 115/170 (67.6%) patients 
in the C/T arm and 33/54 (61.1%) in the MERO treatment arm experienced one or more Aes, of which 
15.9% and 14.8% were considered to be related to study treatment by the investigator. In the C/T 
group, 11 (6.7%) patients experienced SAEs, compared to 2 patients (3.7%) in the MERO group. 
However, none of these SAEs were considered related to treatment.  
Three (3) patients in the C/T treatment arm vs. none in the MERO arm discontinued treatment due to 
Aes, however none were considered treatment-related. There were no drug-related SAEs, Aes leading to 
death, or discontinuations due to drug-related Aes. 
The incidences of Aes and SAEs which were higher in the C/T+MTZ group for P035 compared with the 
corresponding MERO group; however, the incidence of drug-related Aes was similar between treatment 
groups in both studies.  
Common Adverse Events 
Most Frequently Reported Adverse Events 
The incidence of individual reported Aes was generally comparable between treatment groups. 
Overall, the most frequently reported Aes (>5%) were diarrhoea (11.2%), pyrexia (8.8%), 
thrombocytosis (7.6%), and AST increased (5.3%) in the C/T group, and diarrhoea (14.8%), 
thrombocytosis, pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, and urinary tract infection (each 7.4%), and AST increased and 
ALT increased (each 5.6%) in the MERO group, see table below.

Overall, the Committee noted that the most frequently reported Aes (>5%) were diarrhoea (11.2%), 
pyrexia (8.8%), thrombocytosis (7.6%), and AST increased (5.3%) in the C/T group, these are all known 
ADRs with Zerbaxa. For the MERO group the most frequently reported Aes (>5%) were diarrhoea 
(14.8%), thrombocytosis, pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, and urinary tract infection (each 7.4%), and AST 
increased and ALT increased (each 5.6%).  
The SOCs where Aes were reported most frequently (≥20% in the C/T arm): Gastrointestinal disorders 
(25.3% in the C/T arm vs. 24.1% in the MERO arm), Blood and lymphatic system disorders (20.0% vs. 
11.1%), and Infections and infestations (20.0% vs. 29.6%). 
Drug-related Adverse Events 
Overall, the incidence of Aes considered as drug-related by the investigator was generally comparable 
between both treatment groups (C/T: 15.9%; MERO: 14.8%). The most frequently reported drug-related 
Aes (>2% of participants) were diarrhoea (C/T: 4.1%; MERO: 7.4%), AST increased (C/T: 3.5%; MERO: 
3.7%), and ALT increased (C/T: 2.9%; MERO: 1.9%), see table below. 
No Aes related to oral step-down treatment were reported.

Table 39: Participants With Drug-Related Adverse Events (Incidence > 0% in One or More Treatment 
Groups) All Participants as Treated Population 
Overall, the incidence of Aes considered as drug-related by the investigator was considered by the 
Committee comparable between both treatment groups (C/T: 15.9%; MERO: 14.8%), corresponding to 
27 vs. 8 patients, respectively.  
The most frequently reported drug-related Aes (>1%) were neutropenia (C/T 1.8%; MERO: 0%), 
diarrhoea (C/T: 4.1%; MERO: 7.4%), AST increased (C/T: 3.5%; MERO: 3.7%), and ALT increased (C/T: 
2.9%; MERO: 1.9%), blood alkaline phosphatase increased (C/T: 1.2%; MERO: 0%), increased appetite 
(C/T: 1.8%; MERO: 0%), and dysgeusia (C/T: 1.2%; MERO: 0%). All but three of these ADRs are well

known for Zerbaxa for the adult population, but neutropenia, increased appetite and dysgeusia seems to 
be new ADRs for this product. All the ADRs presented here are reflected in the proposed SmPC in a 
separate table concerning paediatric safety data. However, a separate table was not acceptable. The MAH 
was requested to consider merging the adverse reactions (from the proposed paediatric table) into a 
single table, i.e. insert new ADRs into the already approved table based on adult safety data. In case of 
paediatric-specific frequencies or adverse reactions, this was indicated by footnotes, as already performed 
for the specific therapeutic indications for adults. However, after assessing MAH’s proposal for 
modifications, the CHMP reconsidered the request. The MAH was therefore asked to reinsert the approved 
version of the table (which is based on adult data). In addition, to keep in with the paediatric data and 
with reference to the SmPC guideline, a paediatric sub-section was recommended to be included below 
the table. 
Any co-medication use will hamper the safety evaluation of C/T treatment in the children. The majority of 
paediatric patients in both studies did receive both prior and/or concomitant medications, including non-
antibiotics and antibiotics. This issue was not discussed by the MAH. However, based on data provided, 
and presence of many different medications, any trend would be difficult to see, reason for which the 
issue was not pursued. 
Adverse Events by Maximum Intensity 
Most Aes were generally mild to moderate and comparable between both treatment groups. The 
individual Aes within each intensity category were also generally comparable between both treatment 
groups. 
The incidence of severe Aes was low for both treatment groups (C/T: 5.9%; MERO: 1.9%). No severe AE 
was reported in >2 participants. The most commonly reported severe Aes (>1% of participants), were 
neutropenia (1.2%) in the C/T group, and hypertension (1.9%) in the MERO group.  
Events of Clinical Interest (ECIs) 
No predefined ECIs of elevated liver enzymes meeting specific DILI criteria or events of overdose of C/T 
were reported in P034 or P035. 
Analysis of Adverse Events by Organ System or Syndrome 
Select Aes of hypersensitivity, severe skin reaction, Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD), 
renal impairment, and hemolysis were reviewed, as they are potentially associated with the β-lactam 
antibiotic class. No Aes of hypersensitivity, severe skin reactions, or CDAD, were reported in P034 or 
P035. 
Adverse Events of Acute Renal Failure 
Based on the SMQ of Acute Renal Failure, there was 1 AE of oliguria reported in the C/T+MTZ group in 
P035. The event was non-serious, not considered related to study treatment, resolved, and the 
participant did not discontinue study treatment. 
Although not considered part of the SMQ of Acute Renal Failure, an AE of exacerbation of chronic kidney 
disease occurred in a participant in the C/T group in P034 which caused the participant to discontinue 
study treatment. The event was non-serious, not considered related to study treatment, and resolved. 
Adverse Events of Hemolytic Disorders 
Based on the SMQ of Hemolytic Disorders, there was 1 AE of transfusion reaction reported in the C/T 
+MTZ group in P035. The participant had a negative Coombs’ test at screening and a positive Coombs’ 
test at EOIV. The event was non-serious, did not cause the participant to discontinue study treatment, 
and was not considered related to study treatment.

Phase 1 Study (P010) 
In P010, 11 participants (29.7%) experienced at least 1 AE and all Aes were either mild or moderate in 
intensity. Three participants (8.1%) experienced SAEs; 2 participants (5.4%) experienced drug-related 
Aes. No severe Aes, deaths, or Aes leading to discontinuation of study treatment were reported. 
Anemia, diarrhea, and hypokalemia were the only Aes reported for >1 participant (n=2 each). 
Specific SAEs that occurred were: pneumonia, infective pulmonary exacerbation of cystic fibrosis, and 
device-related sepsis. Each of the SAEs began several days after study treatment administration and 
were considered by the investigator to be unrelated to study treatment. 
Specific drug-related Aes that occurred were: 1 dizziness (1 participant), bradycardia and tachycardia (1 
participant). Each of the drug-related Aes were mild in severity and resolved. 
There were no events indicative of hypersensitivity reactions or hemolytic disorders, or any events 
involving Clostridiodes difficile. 
The CHMP noted that most Aes were generally mild to moderate and comparable between both treatment 
groups. The incidence of severe Aes was 5.9% (10 pts) for the C/T arm and 1.9% (1 patient) for the 
MERO arm, which corresponds to 10 patients vs. 1 patient in the treatment groups, respectively. No 
severe AE was reported in >2 participants. The most commonly reported severe Aes were neutropenia 
(1.2%, 2 patients) in the C/T group, and hypertension (1.9%, one patient) in the MERO group.  
Within the Renal and urinary disorders SOC, renal impairment and renal failure are already stated ADR 
for Zerbaxa based on adult safety data (Zerbaxa SmPC). With regards to Acute Renal Failure or the 
associated SOC, there was 1 AE of oliguria reported in the C/T+MTZ group in P035 and one AE of 
exacerbation of chronic kidney disease that occurred in a participant in the C/T group in P034. None of 
these non-serious events was considered related to treatment by the investigator.  
In study P010, specific drug-related Aes that occurred were: 1 dizziness (1 participant), bradycardia and 
tachycardia (1 participant). Each of the drug-related Aes were mild in severity and resolved.  
4.6.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
No deaths were reported in P034 or P035. 
Serious Adverse Events 
The overall incidence of SAEs was low for the treatment groups (C/T: 6.5% vs. MERO: 3.7%, i.e. 
11 patients vs. 2 patients, respectively). The most frequently reported SAEs (>1%) were pneumonia 
(2 patients, 1.2%) in the C/T group, and pyrexia and hypertension (both 1.9%) in the MERO group. All 
SAEs resolved except for 1 (hypertension), which resolved with sequelae. No SAEs were considered to be 
related to study treatment.  
The Committee noted that the overall incidence of SAEs was somewhat higher in the C/T group (6.5%, 11 
pts) than in the MERO group (3.7%, 2 pts). Of the 11 patients with SAEs in the C/T group, SAEs were 
reported in 3 patients in P034 (all within the SOC Infections and infestations), and in 8 patients in P035 
(4 in each of the SOCs Infections and infestations, and Gastrointestinal disorder). The most frequently 
reported SAEs (>1%) were pneumonia (1.2%, i.e. in two patients) in the C/T group, and pyrexia and 
hypertension (both 1.9%, i.e. one patient each) in the MERO group.  
No SAEs were considered to be related to study treatment.

4.6.4.  Laboratory findings  
Clinical laboratory evaluations 
Phase 2 Studies (P034, P035, and Integrated Data) 
Mean changes from baseline over time were generally comparable between the treatment groups for 
clinical chemistry and hematology. No clinically meaningful changes from baseline over time in any 
laboratory parameters were observed. 
The proportion of participants with post-baseline hematology and chemistry measurements that worsened 
from baseline was generally comparable between treatment groups. 
Few participants from either treatment group had elevated liver function test results. The data show no 
DILI and no pattern of elevated liver function tests. Most of the elevations occurred at screening or during 
follow-up and appeared to be transient in nature. 
Seroconversion of direct Coombs’ test from negative to positive is a known side effect of β-lactam 
exposure. A higher proportion of participants in the C/T group compared to the MERO group 
seroconverted from a negative result at baseline to a positive direct Coombs’ test result at EOIV. No Aes 
or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of drug-induced hemolytic anemia were reported for these 
participants.  
In clinical studies, there was no evidence of haemolysis in patients who developed a positive direct 
Coombs test in any treatment group (Zerbaxa SmPC). Based on the SMQ of Hemolytic Disorders, there 
was 1 AE of transfusion reaction reported in the C/T +MTZ group in P035, and this participant had a 
negative Coombs’ test at screening and a positive Coombs’ test at EOIV. This event was non-serious and 
not considered related to treatment.  
The CHMP considered that Coombs test positive are already identified as an ADR for Zerbaxa, and there is 
text in section 4.4 and 4.8 of the Zerbaxa SmPC describing this in more detail; “The development of a 
positive direct antiglobulin test (DAGT) may occur during treatment with ceftolozane/tazobactam (see 
section 4.8). In clinical studies, there was no evidence of haemolysis in patients who developed a positive 
DAGT on treatment.”  
Phase 1 Study (P010) 
No participants had abnormal liver function test results that met the criteria for closely monitored events. 
In general, small mean changes in chemistry and hematology parameters from Baseline to Day 2 were 
observed in all dosage groups. 
One participant from Group 2 with a negative baseline Coombs’ test had a positive test result on Day 2. 
This participant did not experience an AE of anemia but had an SAE of cystic fibrosis pulmonary 
exacerbation that began on Study Day 4. From Baseline to Day 2, no other participant experienced a shift 
from negative to positive in direct Coombs’ test results. 
Vital signs, physical findings, and other observations related to safety  
Phase 2 Studies (P034, P035, and Integrated Data) 
There were no clinically meaningful findings in the vital signs measurements. The mean changes in heart 
rate, respiratory rate, temperature and systolic and diastolic blood pressure from baseline across 
scheduled visits were small and generally comparable between both treatment groups. 
Phase 1 Study (P010) 
Assessment report  
EMA/644705/2022 
Page 110/127 
 
 
 
 
 
In general, mean changes in vital signs from Baseline to Day 1 (post-dose) and Day 2 were observed in 
all dosage groups, including Groups 5 and 6. For any vital sign value not in the expected range, 
investigators had to confirm or update the value to ensure it was accurate. From Baseline to Day 1, no 
clinically significant shifts in ECG parameters were observed in the dosage groups. 
4.6.5.  Safety in special populations  
Intrinsic Factors 
The incidence of Aes by the intrinsic factors of age and gender for the integrated P034 and P035 studies 
are provided below. Intrinsic factors of renal function, body weight, or race/ethnicity were not assessed. 
Age 
The incidences of AE summary measures by age group were generally comparable between the C/T and 
MERO treatment groups, se table below. 
Table 40: Adverse Event Summary By Age group All Participants as Treated Population Studies 
MK-7625A-034 and MK-7625A-035 Combined 
There were no clinically meaningful differences identified in patterns of specific Aes or AE intensity 
between treatment groups in the incidences of Aes within age categories. These results are consistent 
with those in the overall population. 
As shown in the table above, the distribution of treatment-emergent Aes is given for different age cohorts 
or categories (group 1-5). For the integrated population (P034+P035), the frequency of Aes (participants 
Assessment report  
EMA/644705/2022 
Page 111/127 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with one or more Aes) in general is either similar or ~10% difference within each age group; for the age 
cohorts, these frequencies are given (C/T vs. MERO), from oldest to youngest: group 1 (71.0% vs. 
70.0%), group 2 (72.2% vs. 58.8%), group 3 (65.9% vs. 57.1%), group 4 (60.0% vs. 71.4%) and group 
5 (62.5% vs. 50.0%). No apparent trends can be found. Having in mind that the age groups are 
constituted of a quite small number of paediatric patents, especially in the MERO groups (randomisation 
for C/T:MERO is 3:1), the frequency will inherently be uncertain and must be interpreted with caution.  
When looking at the treatment-related Aes and age cohorts, the Aes considered related to Zerbaxa 
treatment and hence, of most importance, the numbers are even more uncertain. Number of patients 
with events out of total number of patients within each age group are as follows: (C/T vs. MERO), from 
oldest to youngest: group 1 (4/31 vs. 0/10 patients), group 2 (13/54 vs. 2/17), group 3 (3/44 vs. 2/14), 
group 4 (3/25 vs. 3/7) and group 5 (4/16 vs. 1/6).  
As stated by the MAH, there were no clinically meaningful differences identified in patterns of specific Aes 
or AE intensity between treatment groups in the incidences of Aes within age categories. The CHMP 
considered these results consistent with those in the overall population. 
Gender 
The incidences of AE summary measures by gender were generally comparable between the C/T and 
MERO treatment groups. 
There were no clinically meaningful differences identified in patterns of specific Aes or AE intensity 
between treatment groups in the incidences of Aes within the gender categories. These results are 
consistent with those in the overall population. 
Extrinsic Factors 
Geographic Region 
The incidences of AE summary measures by geographic region were generally comparable between the 
C/T and MERO treatment groups. Higher incidences of Aes (in both treatment groups) and SAEs (in the 
C/T group) were reported for participants in North America compared with Europe; however, within these 
regions, the incidence of Aes was comparable between the C/T and MERO treatment groups. 
There were no clinically meaningful differences identified in patterns of specific Aes or AE intensity 
between treatment groups in the incidences of Aes by geographic region. These results are consistent 
with those in the overall population.  
The CHMP noted that there were no clinically meaningful differences identified in patterns of specific Aes 
or AE intensity between treatment groups in the incidences of Aes within age or gender categories or by 
geographic region. These results are consistent with those in the overall population. 
4.6.6.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions  
No new DDI studies were provided in support of this application. Therefore, Aes by drug interaction were 
not evaluated. The CHMP however considered that data assessed in previous Zerbaxa procedures indicate 
a low risk of DDIs during C/T treatment, and it is reasonable that the low DDI potential observed in adults 
can be extended to the paediatric population. 
4.6.7.  Discontinuation due to adverse events  
Adverse Events Leading to Study Drug Discontinuation 
Assessment report  
EMA/644705/2022 
Page 112/127 
 
 
 
 
 
Three participants (1.8%), all from the C/T group, discontinued study treatment due to an AE. None of 
the Aes leading to discontinuation were considered by the investigator to be drug-related. 
In P034, one participant discontinued due to chronic kidney disease. In P035, 1 participant discontinued 
due to pneumonia, and 1 participant discontinued due to pneumonia and abdominal sepsis.  
The CHMP noted that, in total, 3 patients (1.8%) in the C/T treatment arm discontinued drug due to an 
AE (chronic kidney disease, pneumonia, pneumonia and abdominal sepsis). None of these were 
considered related to treatment by the investigator. 
4.6.8.  Post marketing experience  
Ceftolozane/tazobactam (C/T) was first approved in the United States on 19-DEC-2014 (international 
birth date) and has been approved in adults in 76 countries as of 19-DEC-2020. There are no records of 
any registration being revoked or withdrawn for safety reasons. 
Based on the above calculations, the estimated cumulative number of patients through 19-DEC-2020 
exposed to ceftolozane and tazobactam for all indications was within the range of 63,286 to 443,004 
patients, depending on the indication and duration of treatment. 
The Applicant’s safety database was queried for valid, spontaneous and non-interventional study reports 
of C/T from 19-DEC-2014 to 19-DEC-2020.  
A total of 2,178 reports containing 3,754 events were identified. By number of events, the 3 most 
commonly affected SOCs were: Injury, poisoning and procedural complications; General disorders and 
administration site conditions; and Infections and infestations. 
Of the 2,178 reports, 55 reports or cases concerned paediatric patients (4 non-interventional study 
reports and 51 spontaneous). The 55 reports contained 117 events: 12 (10%) were considered serious 
and 105 (90%) were non-serious. Of the 55 reports, 16 were female patients, 10 were male patients, and 
29 were of unidentified gender. The median age was 11 years (range: 91 days-17 years). The 3 most 
commonly reported current conditions were: hospitalization (n=15), Pseudomonas infection (n=13), and 
pneumonia (n=9). 
By number of events, the 3 most commonly affected SOCs in paediatric reports were: Injury, poisoning 
and procedural complications (55 cases including 77 events); General disorders and administration site 
conditions (13 cases, 13 events); and Infections and infestations (4 cases, 6 events). 
• The Injury, poisoning and procedural complications SOC contained 77 (66%) of all events: All events 
were non-serious. By number of events (n, % of all events), the 3 most common PTs in this SOC were: 
off-label use (n=26, 22%), product use issue (n=21, 18%) and product use in unapproved indication 
(n=20, 17%), reflecting unapproved use in paediatric patients. 
• The General disorders and administration site conditions SOC contained 13 events (11%): 2 were 
considered serious and 11 non-serious. By number of events (n, % of all events), the 2 most common 
PTs in this SOC were no adverse event (n=5, 4%) and drug effective for unapproved indication (n=2, 
2%). All other events were reported once. 
• The Infections and infestations SOC contained 6 events (5%), all of which were considered serious. By 
number of events (n, % of all events), the most commonly reported PT in this SOC was pathogen 
resistance (n=3, 3%). All other events were reported once. 
Of the 117 events, 12 events were considered serious. The 12 events occurred within 8 reports and were 
listed as the following PTs: pathogen resistance (n=3), bone operation (n=1), osteomyelitis (n=1), 
dehiscence (n=1), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (n=1), Pseudomonas infection (n=1), 
Assessment report  
EMA/644705/2022 
Page 113/127 
 
 
 
 
 
Clostridioides difficile infection (n=1), diarrhea (n=1), neutropenia (n=1), and hepatocellular injury 
(n=1). 
The Aes by age group (<2 years, ≥2 to <6 years, ≥6 to <12 years, ≥12 to <18 years) were similar. 
An analysis of the post marketing data did not identify any safety issues in paediatric patients. Based on 
this analysis, the safety profile in paediatric patients is consistent with the overall safety profile. 
Of the 2,178 reports of C/T from 19-DEC-2014 to 19-DEC-2020 (including 3,754 events), 55 reports 
concerned paediatric patients (4 non-interventional study reports and 51 spontaneous). The 55 reports 
contained 117 events: 12 (10%) were considered serious and 105 (90%) were non-serious. Of the 117 
events, 12 events were considered serious. The 12 events occurred within 8 reports and were listed as 
the following PTs: pathogen resistance (n=3), bone operation (n=1), osteomyelitis (n=1), dehiscence 
(n=1), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (n=1), Pseudomonas infection (n=1), Clostridioides difficile 
infection (n=1), diarrhea (n=1), neutropenia (n=1), and hepatocellular injury (n=1). 
It can be agreed by the MAH that reported events are consistent with the known safety profile of C/T; no 
new risks have been identified in the post marketing setting in paediatric patients.  
4.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety analysis of the pooled phase 2 paediatric studies in cUTI (including pyelonephritis) and cIAI (in 
combination with MTZ) comprising 170 paediatric patients from birth to <18 years of age exposed to 
intravenous ceftolozane/tazobactam has been conducted. All randomised patients who received any 
amount of IV study therapy (C/T±MTZ) were included. In addition, data from a Phase 1 study (P010) to 
characterize the PK of a single IV dose of C/T in 37 paediatric patients, was submitted for support (The 
P010 study was submitted as an Article 46 application, and CHMP review was completed in January 
2018). The safety analysis population for each of the 3 studies was the ApaT population consisting of all 
randomized participants who received any amount of study treatment.  
Dose: Paediatric participants from 12 to <18 years of age with cIAI and AP/cUTI received the adult fixed 
dose of 1.5 g C/T (1 g ceftolozane and 0.5 g tazobactam); children <12 years of age, including neonates, 
received a weight-based dosing regimen of 30 mg/kg C/T (20 mg/kg ceftolozane and 10 mg/kg 
tazobactam) that did not exceed the adult fixed dose of 1.5 g C/T (1 g ceftolozane and 0.5 g 
tazobactam). 
Overall, in the Phase 2 Studies (studies P034 and P035), the disposition of participants was generally 
comparable between 5 age groups (12 to < 18 years, 6 to < 12 years, 2 to < 6 years, 3 months to < 2 
years and birth to < 3 months). It should be noted that there were less children in the youngest age 
group, and only one (1) patient in each of group 4 and 5 (birth to <2 years of age) in the cIAI study 
(P035), which might be due to the condition of cIAI being less common at very young age. 
With regard to duration of IV therapy, overall in the APaT population, the median duration of exposure 
was generally comparable between treatment groups (C/T was 5.4 days [range: 0.3 to 14.0 days], and 
MERO was 5.0 days [range: 1.0 to 9.7]). Study treatment duration for IV therapy was, however, shorter 
in the AP/cUTI study (P034) compared with cIAI (P035), because a larger proportion of participants 
discontinued from study treatment due to no qualifying pathogen in the P034 study. Concomitant 
medications were in widespread use, and the majority of patients in both treatment groups (C/T: 86/170; 
MERO: 32/54) received prior or concomitant medications; including oral step-down antibacterial 
medication. This was considered acceptable, although may hamper the assessment of possible association 
of AEs to the medicinal product.  
Assessment report  
EMA/644705/2022 
Page 114/127 
 
 
 
 
 
The majority of participants in P034+P035 experienced AEs: 115/170 (67.6%) patients in the C/T arm 
and 33/54 (61.1%) in the MERO arm. The AE summary profile was generally comparable between the 
P034 and P035 studies for both the C/T and MERO groups, with the exceptions of the incidences of AEs 
and SAEs in P035, which were higher in the C/T+MTZ group compared with the MERO group. In the 
C/T+MTZ group in P035, AEs and SAEs were distributed over a variety of preferred terms and SOCs 
without clustering to suggest a specific safety signal. With regard to the different age cohorts, there is no 
apparent trend regarding AE frequency, however, the numbers of participants are very small when 
dividing into age subsets. The incidence of individual reported AEs was generally comparable between 
treatment groups. Overall, the most frequently reported AEs (>5%) were diarrhoea (11.2%), pyrexia 
(8.8%), thrombocytosis (7.6%), and AST increased (5.3%) in the C/T group, all known ADRs with 
Zerbaxa. In comparison, the most frequently reported AEs (>5%) were diarrhea (14.8%), 
thrombocytosis, pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, and urinary tract infection (each 7.4%), and AST increased and 
ALT increased (each 5.6%) in the MERO group. 
Overall, the incidence of AEs considered as drug-related by the investigator was generally comparable 
between both treatment groups (C/T: 15.9% (27 pts); MERO: 14.8% (8 pts)). The most frequently 
reported drug-related AEs (>1%) were neutropenia (C/T 1.8%; MERO: 0%), diarrhoea (C/T: 4.1%; 
MERO: 7.4%), AST increased (C/T: 3.5%; MERO: 3.7%), and ALT increased (C/T: 2.9%; MERO: 1.9%), 
blood alkaline phosphatase increased (C/T: 1.2%; MERO: 0%), increased appetite (C/T: 1.8%; MERO: 
0%), and dysgeusia (C/T: 1.2%; MERO: 0%). All but three of these ADRs are well known for Zerbaxa for 
the adult population; neutropenia, increased appetite and dysgeusia seems to be new ADRs for this 
product. After reconsideration, the MAH is asked to reinsert the approved version of the table of ADRs 
(based on adult data) rather than merging paediatric data into it. In addition, to keep in with the 
paediatric data and with reference to the SmPC guideline, a paediatric sub-section is suggested to be 
included below this table. 
Most AEs were generally mild to moderate and comparable between both treatment groups. The incidence 
of severe AEs for the treatment groups were C/T: 5.9% and for MERO: 1.9%. No severe AE was reported 
in >2 participants. The most commonly reported severe AEs were neutropenia (1.2%, 2 patients) in the 
C/T group, and hypertension (1.9%, 1 patient) in the MERO group.  
No deaths were reported in P034 or P035. There was a low incidence of SAEs for the treatment groups, 
however, it is noted that the overall incidence of serious adverse events in studies 034 and 035 
(combined) was higher in the C/T group; 11 (6.7%) patients experienced SAEs, compared to 2 patients 
(3.7%) in the MERO group. Among the 13 total SAEs that were reported, 4 occurred while participants 
were receiving IV therapy; the remainder occurred either during oral step-down therapy or during the 
post treatment follow-up period. All SAEs resolved except for 1 (hypertension), which resolved with 
sequelae. However, none of these SAEs was considered related to treatment. Three (3) patients in the 
C/T treatment arm vs. none in the MERO arm discontinued treatment due to AEs, of which none 
considered treatment-related. In summary, there were no drug-related SAEs, AEs leading to death, or 
discontinuations due to drug-related AEs. 
The incidences of AEs and SAEs which were higher in the C/T+MTZ group compared with the MERO group 
in P035 (cIAI); however, the incidence of drug-related AEs was similar between treatment groups in both 
studies.  
No predefined Events of Clinical Interest (ECIs) of elevated liver enzymes meeting specific DILI criteria or 
events of overdose of C/T were reported in P034 or P035. 
Select AEs of hypersensitivity, severe skin reaction, Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD), 
renal impairment, and hemolysis were reviewed, as they are potentially associated with the β-lactam 
antibiotic class. No AEs of hypersensitivity, severe skin reactions, or CDAD, were reported in P034 or 
Assessment report  
EMA/644705/2022 
Page 115/127 
 
 
 
 
 
P035. However, these are uncommon reactions and would not be expected to occur in this small number 
of patients treated. With regard to Acute Renal Failure or Renal and urinary disorders SOC in general, 
there was 1 AE of oliguria reported in the C/T+MTZ group in P035 and an AE of exacerbation of chronic 
kidney disease occurred in a participant in the C/T group in P034. However, none of the two (both non-
serious) events was considered related to treatment. In addition, one AE of hemolysis (transfusion 
reaction) was reported (see below). 
Seroconversion of direct Coombs’ test from negative to positive is a known side effect of β-lactam 
exposure, and the development of a positive direct Coombs test may occur during treatment with 
Zerbaxa. In clinical studies, there was no evidence of haemolysis in patients who developed a positive 
direct Coombs test in any treatment group (see Zerbaxa SmPC). A higher proportion of participants in the 
C/T group compared to the MERO group seroconverted from a negative result at baseline to a positive 
direct Coombs’ test result at EOIV. No AEs or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of drug-induced 
hemolytic anemia were reported for these participants. Based on the SMQ of Hemolytic Disorders, there 
was 1 AE of transfusion reaction reported in the C/T +MTZ group in P035, and this participant had a 
negative Coombs’ test at screening and a positive Coombs’ test at EOIV. This event was non-serious and 
not considered related to treatment.  
There were no clinically meaningful differences identified in patterns of specific AEs or AE intensity 
between treatment groups in the incidences of AEs within age or gender categories or by geographic 
region. These results are consistent with those in the overall population.  
Specific drug-related AEs that occurred in the single-dose study P010 were: 1 dizziness (1 participant), 
bradycardia and tachycardia (1 participant). Each of the drug-related AEs were mild in severity and 
resolved. 
The clinical development program is unlikely to detect certain types of adverse reactions such as rare 
adverse reactions, adverse reactions with a long latency, or those caused by prolonged exposure. 
However, based on the known safety profile of cephalosporins/beta-lactamase inhibitors with extensive 
use in the paediatric populations, a different safety profile for ceftolozane/tazobactam in patients < 18 
years old compared with adults is not anticipated. Notwithstanding this, three new ADR were reported for 
C/T in the AP/cUTI and cIAI pooled paediatric population; neutropenia, increased appetite and dysgeusia, 
which are considered manageable and not concerning. Besides these ADRs, no new safety concerns were 
observed in the paediatric studies in AP/cUTI or cIAI, or from post-marketing data.  
4.6.10.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Safety analysis of the pooled phase 2 paediatric studies in cUTI, AP and cIAI (in combination with MTZ) 
comprising 170 paediatric patients from birth to <18 years of age exposed to intravenous ceftolozane-
tazobactam has been conducted. All randomised patients who received any amount of IV study therapy 
(C/T±MTZ) were included. About two thirds (115 patients, 67.6%) of the patients treated with C/T±MTZ 
experienced Aes, of which 27 patients (15.9%) had Aes that were considered treatment related.  
The overall safety profile in paediatric patients seems to be in line with the expected safety profile for C/T 
in adults, however three new ADRs are reported in the paediatric population (neutropenia, increased 
appetite and dysgeusia), which are considered manageable. Besides these, no new safety issues have 
been identified in the two studies performed. However, the data on safety is limited based on the small 
number of patients included. In particular safety data from patients <2 years of age with serious cIAIs 
are limited. Routine Pharmacovigilance measures, such as PSUR reporting, are expected to generate the 
safety follow-up. 
It is concluded that the submitted clinical data provides overall clinical evidence that C/T has an 
Assessment report

acceptable safety profile for use in paediatric patients from birth to <18 years of age with cUTI, AP and 
cIAI.

In community and hospital settings, UTIs are among the most common infections encountered in 
paediatric patients [Ref. 5.4: 04L9BT, 047LSV, 045QPR]. The epidemiology of UTI during childhood varies 
by age, gender, geographic region and other factors [Ref. 5.4: 044G96]. The incidence of UTI is highest 
in the first year of life for all children (1%) but decreases among boys after infancy [Ref. 5.4: 06CXBN].  
In the US, paediatric UTIs account for over 1 million annual office visits, and 500,000 emergency 
department (ED) visits. Nearly 50,000 children are hospitalized annually with a UTI, representing ~1.8% 
of all paediatric hospitalizations [Ref. 5.4: 05Q0Y9]. A population-based study from Scandinavia reported 
a cumulative UTI incidence rate of 7.8% for girls [Ref. 5.4: 06CX9L] by the age of 7 years, In Sweden, a 
retrospective population-based study investigated the incidence rate of first-time symptomatic UTI in 
children under 6 years of age. The cumulative incidence rate of UTI was 3 times greater in girls (6.6%) 
than boys (1.8%) [Ref. 5.4: 06CXC2]. Literature on complicated paediatric UTI is limited. 
The main existing treatment options: 
(…) 
In paediatric patients, fluoroquinolones are generally avoided due to their association with    
musculoskeletal toxicity including tendinopathies [Ref. 5.4: 03V6FR], further limiting treatment options. 
Resistance to aminopenicillins and first generation cephalosporins limit their utility as empiric treatments. 
Assessment report  
EMA/644705/2022 
Page 117/127 
 
 
 
 
 
Second or third generation cephalosporins are recommended empiric treatment options [Ref. 5.4: 
04L9R3].  
Antibiotic resistance in paediatric patients with cUTI is attributed to recurrent infection, instrumentation, 
and exposure to multiple courses of antibiotics [Ref. 5.4: 044QP8]. 
Natural history of the indicated condition in the population, including mortality and morbidity: 
(…) 
UTIs in paediatric patients are associated with significantly higher morbidity and more severe long-term 
sequelae, including impaired renal function and progression to end-stage renal disease, in comparison to 
UTIs in adult patients [Ref. 5.4: 03V6FR]. Renal scarring represents the most significant difference in 
disease pathophysiology between the adult and paediatric populations; paediatric patients younger than 2 
years of age are more likely to be predisposed to renal damage, given their developmental stage. 
Sequelae associated with renal scarring can include hypertension, proteinuria, renal damage, and chronic 
renal failure, which may necessitate dialysis treatment in adulthood [Ref. 5.4: 04L9R3]. 
Across all paediatric age groups, E. coli is the most common cause of UTI, followed by Klebsiella spp., 
Proteus mirabilis, other Enterobacterales, Enterococcus spp., P. aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus 
saprophyticus [Ref. 5.4: 04L9BV, 04L9RH]. Uncomplicated UTIs are most commonly caused by E. coli, 
whereas a broader range of microorganisms may be responsible for cUTIs [Ref. 5.4: 044QP8, 04L9RC].  
Furthermore, cUTIs are associated with an increased likelihood of drug resistance in the infecting 
microorganisms, which can further complicate treatment and lead to high mortality rates [Ref. 5.4: 
044QP8]. In a retrospective study (2008-2009) conducted in Turkey of 344 paediatric outpatients 
diagnosed with UTI due to E coli and Klebsiella, ESBL-producing bacteria was isolated from 148 (43%) of 
these patients who all had at least 1 episode of pyelonephritis[Ref. 5.4: 05NG4F]. 
Complicated Intraabdominal Infections (cIAIs) 
Incidence: 
(…) 
Data from the US and EU has shown that appendicitis is overwhelmingly the most common cause of 
paediatric cIAIs, with an annual incidence rate ranging from 1-6/10,000 children for 0-4 years to 19-
28/10,000 for children younger than 14 years, and accounts for ~90% of paediatric cIAIs in children from 
1 month to 15 years old[Ref. 5.4: 04474R, 06D2GN]. Complicated appendicitis due to a gangrenous or 
perforated appendix accounts for ~25,000 paediatric hospital admissions annually in the US and is more 
common in younger children; 57%, 87% and 100% of such cases occurring in children <6 years old, <5 
years and < 1 year respectively [Ref. 5.4: 04LGYL, 05Q0XX] 
Demographics of the population and risk factors for the disease: 
(…) 
In paediatric patients cIAI, characterized by extension of infection from an abdominal organ into the 
peritoneal space, is associated with a variety of causes including intussusception, volvulus, Necrotizing 
Enterocolitis (NEC), trauma, post-surgical complication and appendicitis [Ref. 5.4: 03RBW3]. In neonates, 
NEC, an inflammatory bowel necrosis that generally prents within the first 2 weeks of life and affects the 
terminal ileum, is the most common cause of cIAI [Ref. 5.4: 04LF78]. 
The main existing treatment options:

(…) 
For paediatric patients, the commonly recommended antibiotic options for empiric therapy of suspected 
or confirmed cIAI include carbapenems (imipenem/cilastatin or meropenem), piperacillin/tazobactam, 
ticarcillin/clavulanate, or an extended spectrum cephalosporin (cefotoxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, or 
cefepime) with metronidazole [Ref. 5.4: 044GPV].

(…) 
To support local registration, several additional studies have been completed in support of the adult cUTI 
and cIAI indications.  These include: 2 Phase 3 open-label, noncomparative, local registration studies of 
ceftolozane and tazobactam for treatment of cUTI and cIAI which enrolled a total of 214 Japanese 
subjects, and 1 Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, active comparator-controlled local registration study of 
ceftolozane and tazobactam for treatment of cIAI in Chinese subjects.  A total of 268 subjects were 
randomized in the Chinese Phase 3 cIAI study 1:1 to receive ceftolozane and tazobactam 1.5 g every 8 
hours or meropenem 1 g every 8 hours; all subjects received study drug. 
The paediatric development program for ceftolozane/tazobactam includes a paediatric PK and safety trial 
of ceftolozane/tazobactam, a n d   two randomized, double-blind, active comparator-controlled Phase 2 
studies in paediatric patients with cUTI or cIAI.  CXA-PEDS-13-08 (MK-7625A-010) was a Phase 1, 
multicenter, single-dose, noncomparative, open-label trial of age- and weight-based dosing of 
ceftolozane/tazobactam up to 1.5 g IV in 36 subjects. Neonates, infants, young children, and adolescents 
were enrolled in 6 age groups to receive a single IV dose of ceftolozane/tazobactam. MK-7625A-034 and 
MK-7625A-035 were two randomized, double-blind, active comparator-controlled Phase 2 studies 
completed in paediatric patients with cUTI or cIAI which enrolled patients from birth (defined as ≥7 days 
postnatal) to <18 years of age. The paediatric Phase 2 cUTI study (MK-7625A-034) included 134 subjects 
randomized 3:1 across 5 age groups to receive ceftolozane/tazobactam either 1.5 g (participants ≥12 
years of age) or 20 mg/kg ceftolozane and 10 mg/kg tazobactam (max 1.5 g, participants <12 years of 
age) every 8 hours, or meropenem 20 mg/kg (maximum 1.0 g, all age groups) every 8 hours; 133 
subjects received study drug. The paediatric Phase 2 cIAI study (MK-7625A-035) included 94 subjects 
randomized 3:1 across 5 age groups to receive ceftolozane/tazobactam plus metronidazole either 1.5 g ( 
participants ≥12 years of age) or 20 mg/kg ceftolozane and 10 mg/kg tazobactam (max 1.5 g, 
participants <12 years of age) plus metronidazole 10 mg/kg every 8 hours, or meropenem 20 mg/kg 
(maximum 1.0 g, all age groups) plus placebo every 8 hours; 91 subjects received study drug. Both 
paediatric Phase 2 studies were multinational, including sites in North and South America, Eastern and 
Western Europe, Asia, and South Africa.  
The current clinical development program for ceftolozane and tazobactam includes one ongoing clinical 
study, a Phase 1, open-label, non-comparative study of ceftolozane/tazobactam in paediatric subjects 
with NP. 
The tables related to duration of exposure, age group and gender, dose, ethnic origin were updated to

7.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
7.1.  Therapeutic Context 
7.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The MAH has applied for an extension of indication to broaden the current indications of Zerbaxa to 
include treatment of paediatric patients from birth to <18 years with the following infectious diseases:  
- Complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI)  
- Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI)  
- Acute pyelonephritis (AP) 
7.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
cIAI - available therapies 
According to IDSA guideline 2017, selection of specific antimicrobial therapy for paediatric patients with 
cIAI should be based on considerations of the origin of infection (community vs health care), severity of 
illness, and safety of the antimicrobial agents in specific paediatric age groups. 
Acceptable broad-spectrum antimicrobial regimens for paediatric patients with cIAI include an 
aminoglycoside-based regimen, a carbapenem (imipenem, meropenem, or ertapenem), a β-lactam/β-
lactamase-inhibitor combination (piperacillin-tazobactam or ticarcillin-clavulanate), or an advanced-
generation cephalosporin (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, or cefepime) with metronidazole. 
AP/cUTI - available therapies 
The EAU/ESPU guidelines 2015 for UTI in children recommend therapy with an antimicrobial regimen for 
paediatric AP/cUTI patients, such as an aminoglycoside with or without amoxicillin, or a second or third 
generation cephalosporin, or an extended-spectrum penicillin with or without an aminoglycoside. The 
most frequently used agents for treatment of paediatric UTI are parenteral cephalosporins (e.g., 
cefotaxime, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone) or oral cephalosporins (such as cefexime and cefuroxime axetil), 
trimethoprim and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, ampicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, 
piperacillin, aminoglycosides (i.e., tobramycin and gentamycin), ciprofloxacin, and nitrofurantoin. The 
dosing regimen selected should be based on local resistance data and urine culture results. 
Unmet medical need 
Infections due to resistant Gram-negative bacteria are increasingly common in paediatric patients. Few 
antibiotics with activity against ESBL and carbapenemase producing Gram-negative bacteria are currently 
available. Furthermore, only a few antibacterial agents have had their safety and efficacy carefully 
evaluated in paediatric patients. Hence, there is an undisputable medical need for further treatment 
options for the paediatric patient population.

Assessment report  
EMA/644705/2022

Clinical phase 2 study to evaluate safety, tolerability and efficacy of ceftolozane/tazobactam (C/T) when 
given in combination with metronidazole (MTZ), compared with meropenem (MERO), in children from 
birth to less than 18 years of age with complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs). 
Of the 98 enrolled patients, 94 were randomised in a 3:1 ratio to receive C/T + MTZ or MERO and 91 
received treatment (70 were treated in the C/T+MTZ group and 21 were treated in the MERO group). 
The paediatric age groups who received C/T+MTZ were as follows: 12 to <18 years (n= 16), 6 to < 12 
years (n=30), 2 to < 6 years (n= 22), 3 months to < 2 years (n=1) and birth to < 3 months (n=1).  
P034MK7625A (P034) – AP/cUTI 
Clinical phase 2 study to evaluate safety, tolerability and efficacy of ceftolozane/tazobactam (C/T) 
compared to meropenem (MERO) in children from birth to less than 18 years of age with AP and cUTIs. 
Of the 143 enrolled patients, 134 were randomised in a 3:1 ratio to receive C/T or MERO and 133 
patients received treatment (100 were treated in the C/T group and 33 were treated in the MERO group). 
The paediatric age groups who received C/T were as follows: 12 to <18 years (n= 15), 6 to < 12 years 
(n= 24), 2 to < 6 years (n= 22), 3 months to < 2 years (n= 24) and birth to < 3 months (n=15).  
7.2.  Favourable effects 
Efficacy measures were defined as secondary endpoints in the Phase 2 studies and evaluation of efficacy 
was based on descriptive statistics only. Extrapolation of efficacy against an infectious disease from adults 
to paediatric patients is possible based on similar pathophysiology of the infectious disease and a 
spectrum of activity of the antibacterial agent that includes pathogens relevant across the target age 
groups. This situation applies to the majority of infectious diseases that occur both in adults and in one or 
more paediatric age sub-groups, including 
•  Complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI) 
•  Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) 
•  Acute pyelonephritis (AP). 
cIAI indication 
Clinical cure rates were 80.0% (56/70) in the C/T+MTZ treatment arm and 100.0% (21/21) in the MERO 
arm in the MITT population at TOC. 
In the CE population, the cure rates were 89.7% (52/58) in the C/T+MTZ arm and 100.0% (19/19) in the 
MERO arm at TOC. 
cUTI and AP indication 
Clinical cure rates were 88.7% (63/71) in the C/T treatment arm and 95.8% (23/24) in the MERO arm in 
the mMITT population at TOC. 
The per-participant microbiological eradication rates were 84.5% (60/71) in the C/T treatment arm and 
87.5% (21/24) in the MERO arm in the mMITT population at TOC. 
In the ME population, the per-participant microbiological eradication rates were 90.9% (40/44) in the C/T 
treatment arm and 88.2% (15/17) in the MERO arm at TOC.

For all indications, the response rates for C/T±MTZ at the EOIV visit were in line with the response rates 
reported at the EOT and TOC visits. For the EOIV visit the main proportion of patients were partially 
improved reflecting that they were not in need of further IV antibiotic treatment for their infection, but 
additional treatment in the form of oral step-down therapy was still required. 
PK data was collected in the paediatric population in two Phase 2 studies (P034 and P035) and one 
Phase 1 study (P010). Comparable PK of ceftolozane and tazobactam in paediatric patients to adults was 
demonstrated for most patient groups, using a population-PK modelling approach based on sparse 
sampling in the three studies and PTA simulations. Although some trends are observed in the steady-
state ceftolozane and tazobactam plasma PK parameter values, the presented data are within the range 
of observations in the adults with cUTI, AP and cIAI. 
7.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The primary objective of the two phase 2 studies was to evaluate safety and tolerability of 
ceftolozane/tazobactam ± metronidazole. Hence, the studies were not powered for a statistical analysis of 
efficacy. 
Updated population-PK analyses (082HY8) were conducted to assess the PK of C/T in paediatric patients 
and to support the proposed paediatric dose recommendations as well as to support the PK bridging for 
extrapolation of efficacy and safety. Clinical PK data in paediatric patients with AP, cUTI and cIAI is 
available for validation of the paediatric population-PK models, but the data is sparse and not fully 
covering all factors that are known to influence PK exposure (age, weight, type of infection, renal 
function). During the initial assessment, the respective model evaluations indicated reasonable fit for the 
ceftolozane model and model misspecifications for tazobactam. Newly provided graphical presentations 
indicates no major misspecification in the tazobactam model, and overall, the additional presentations 
submitted, indicates that the tazobactam population-PK model fit to the paediatric data reasonably well, 
also at the lower age range. Still the model is considered as of low credibility, particularly for the lowest 
age ranges (below 3 months for AP/cUTI and below 2 years for cIAI). Limited clinical data exists from 
paediatric patients with CrCL <50 mL/min/1.73m2, and the paediatric population PK-model for 
ceftolozane did not adequately describe the influence of renal function. Consequently, no dosing 
recommendations could be provided for paediatric patients with AP, cUTI or cIAI with immature renal 
function or moderate/severe renal impairment (eGFR ≤50 mL/min/1.73 m2) with this procedure. A 
population-PK model has been submitted to support dose selection for paediatric NP patients at a higher 
dose compared to AP, cUTI and cIAI. 
At the dose regimens clinically tested in study P034 and P035, some trends were observed in PK 
measures that deviated from the adult population. The estimated exposure of both ceftolozane and 
tazobactam (AUC0-8 and Ceoi) in paediatric AP- and cUTI patients trended lower (except Group 1 (12 to 
<18 years) where both ceftolozane and tazobactam were comparable, and Group 5 (birth to <3 months 
where elevated exposure of tazobactam was observed) compared to that in adults with AP and cUTI. The 
estimated AUC0-8 of both ceftolozane and tazobactam in paediatric patients with cIAI also trended lower 
compared to adults with cIAI. While ceftolozane Ceoi was comparable to adult values, tazobactam values 
trended higher in paediatric patients. There are few patients included in the lower age groups which 
brings uncertainties to the estimates. No PK data from cIAI patients <2 years were included in the 
population-PK dataset on which the exposure and PTA predictions were based.  
The PTA simulations, using the joint PK/PD target, demonstrated joint PTA achievement of >90% at the 
dose regimen clinically tested in study P034 and P035, and at the proposed dose regimens, for all 
paediatric subgroups with cIAI, AP and cUTI. The credibility of the tazobactam population-PK model is 
low, particularly for the lowest age ranges (<3 months for AP/cUTI and <2 years for cIAI), where the 
Assessment report  
EMA/644705/2022 
Page 123/127 
 
 
 
 
 
model overpredicts the tazobactam exposures. This impacts the derived exposure metrics, and the PTA 
simulations will likely be overestimated. Even so, considering the tazobactam target of fraction of time 
above 1mg/mL at 20%, the observed exposure data indicate that patients are above this limit. 
7.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The majority of participants in P034+P035 experienced AEs: 115/170 (67.6%) patients in the C/T arm 
and 33/54 (61.1%) in the MERO arm. The incidence of individual reported AEs was generally comparable 
between treatment groups. Overall, the most frequently reported AEs (>5%) were diarrhoea (11.2%), 
pyrexia (8.8%), thrombocytosis (7.6%), and AST increased (5.3%) in the C/T group, all known ADRs 
with Zerbaxa. 
Overall,  the  incidence  of  AEs  considered  as  drug-related  by  the  investigator  was  generally  comparable 
between both treatment groups (C/T: 15.9% (27 pts) MERO: 14.8% (8 pts)). The most frequently reported 
drug-related AEs (>1%) were neutropenia (C/T 1.8%), diarrhoea (C/T: 4.1%), AST increased (C/T: 3.5%), 
and  ALT  increased  (C/T:  2.9%),  blood  alkaline  phosphatase  increased  (C/T:  1.2%),  increased  appetite 
(C/T: 1.8%), and dysgeusia (C/T: 1.2%). Three (3) new ADR were reported in the paediatric population in 
AP/cUTI and cIAI; neutropenia, increased appetite and dysgeusia, which are proposed added to the SmPC 
section 4.8. 
Most AEs were generally mild to moderate and comparable between both treatment groups. The incidence 
of severe AEs was 5.9% for C/T arm. No severe AE was reported in >2 participants. The most commonly 
reported severe AE were neutropenia (1.2%, 2 patients) in the C/T group.  
No deaths were reported in P034 or P035. In the C/T group, 11 (6.7%) patients experienced SAEs. 
However, none of these SAEs was considered related to treatment. Three (3) patients in the C/T 
treatment arm discontinued treatment due to AEs, of which none considered treatment-related.  
The incidences of AEs and SAEs which were higher in the C/T+MTZ group compared with the MERO group 
in P035 (cIAI); however, the incidence of drug-related AEs was similar between treatment groups in both 
studies. 
No predefined Events of Clinical Interest (ECIs) of elevated liver enzymes meeting specific DILI criteria or 
events of overdose of C/T were reported in P034 or P035. 
Select AEs of hypersensitivity, severe skin reaction, Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD), 
renal impairment, and hemolysis were reviewed, as they are potentially associated with the β-lactam 
antibiotic class. No AEs of hypersensitivity, severe skin reactions, or CDAD, were reported in P034 or 
P035. With regard to Acute Renal Failure or Renal and urinary disorders SOC in general, there was 1 AE 
of oliguria reported in the C/T+MTZ group in P035 and an AE of exacerbation of chronic kidney disease 
occurred in a participant in the C/T group in P034. However, none of these two non-serious events was 
considered related to treatment. 
Based on the SMQ of Hemolytic Disorders, there was 1 AE of transfusion reaction reported in the C/T 
+MTZ group in P035, and this participant had a negative Coombs’ test at screening and a positive 
Coombs’ test at EOIV. This event was non-serious and not considered related to treatment.  
Seroconversion of direct Coombs’ test from negative to positive is a known side effect of β-lactam exposure. 
A higher proportion of participants in the C/T group compared to the MERO group seroconverted from a 
negative  result  at  baseline  to  a  positive  direct  Coombs’  test  result  at  EOIV.  No  AEs  or  laboratory 
abnormalities suggestive of drug-induced hemolytic anemia were, however, reported for these participants. 
As  mentioned,  three  (3)  new  ADR  were  reported  in  the  paediatric  population  in  AP/cUTI  and  cIAI; 
Assessment report  
EMA/644705/2022 
Page 124/127 
 
 
 
 
 
 
neutropenia, increased appetite and dysgeusia. Besides these ADRs, no new safety concerns were observed 
in the paediatric studies in AP/cUTI or cIAI, or from post-marketing data.  
7.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The clinical development programme is unlikely to detect certain types of adverse reactions such as rare 
adverse reactions and adverse reactions with a long latency. Overall, the number of children included is 
limited and can only contribute to detect common AEs.  
With regard to the different age cohorts, there is no apparent trend regarding AE frequency, however, the 
numbers of participants are very small when dividing into age subsets, so any differences must be 
interpreted with caution. 
Few details regarding safety data collection are found in the documentation, and the documentation is to a 
less degree critical.  
The  paediatric  safety  data  are  to  a  small  degree  compared  to  adult  data  in  the  documentation  by  the 
applicant. This hampers the comparison and hence, evaluation of, the new data with the already approved 
safety database. 
Any  co-medication  use  hampers  the  safety  evaluation  of  C/T  treatment  in  the  children,  which  was  not 
discussed by the MAH. 
As only two children below the age of 2 years old were recruited into the paediatric cIAI study (both in 
C/T+MTZ arm) submitted in the present application, i.e. one child >3 months and up to 2 years of age 
and one child below 3 months of age, there is an uncertainty with respect to the risk of exposing the 
youngest children with cIAI to C/T. Dosing recommendations and safety in children with moderate and 
severe renal impairment were lacking, which is reflected in SmPC section 4.2. It is expected that a 
variation application is submitted when data from the ongoing study MK-7625A-036 become available, 
to include in section 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC (and other sections as relevant) dosing recommendations to 
paediatric patients with AP, cUTI or cIAI with reduced renal function, if supported by the data. To support 
this variation the MAH is recommended to submit full results of updated/relevant population PK model(s). 
7.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
7.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Assuming that similar PK exposure to adults should lead to similar response to ceftolozane and tazobactam, 
a population PK modelling approach was employed to identify appropriate doses of ceftolozane/tazobactam 
to be used in paediatric patients <18 years of age. Therefore, the extension of the proposed indications to 
the paediatric patients depends on the adequacy of the proposed dose regimens in different age subgroups 
based on the comparability of PK to adults and whether the paediatric safety profile is acceptable. 
Acceptable similarity of PK in paediatric patients to adults was demonstrated for most patient groups, using 
population-PK  modelling  and  PTA  simulations.  It  is  reassuring  that  acceptable  joint  PTAs  of  >90%  were 
achieved at the proposed dose regimens using the same joint PK/PD target as that employed in the original 
MAA for adults. This was shown for all paediatric subgroups with cIAI, AP and cUTI. The low credibility of 
the tazobactam population-PK model impacts and brings uncertainties to the PTA simulations, which will 
likely be overestimated. Even so, considering the tazobactam target of fraction of time above 1µg/mL at 
20%, the observed exposure data indicate that patients are above this limit.

Few  patients  are  included  in  the  lower  age  groups  which  brings  uncertainties  to  the  estimates  in  these 
groups. No PK data from cIAI patients <2 years were included in the population-PK dataset on which the 
exposure and PTA predictions were based. 
Since ceftolozane and tazobactam both are renally excreted, dosing recommendations in renal impairment 
is generally required. Considering the low GFR expected in new-born and preterm neonates, the proposed 
eGFR cutoff will most likely exclude a large proportion of the youngest patients born at term and possibly 
all the youngest preterm patients from treatment with C/T. Consequent to the limitations in the collected 
paediatric data with regards to representing the expected range of renal functions and the lack of a reliable 
paediatric population PK model for renal impairment, dosing recommendations for paediatric patients with 
reduced or immature renal function cannot be provided at this time. 
Safety and tolerability of the fixed combination of C/T are the primary objectives in both paediatric studies 
of patients with cIAI, AP and cUTI. The overall safety profile in paediatric patients seems to be in line with 
the  expected  safety  profile  for  C/T  in  adults,  however  three  new  ADRs  are  reported  in  the  paediatric 
population  (neutropenia,  increased  appetite  and  dysgeusia),  which  are  considered  manageable.  Besides 
these, no new safety issues have been identified in the two paediatric studies performed. The data on safety 
is, however, limited based on the small number of patients included, in particular is safety in patients <2 
years of age with cIAIs limited. The safety in children with moderate and severe renal impairment could 
not be evaluated. 
According to Draft guideline EMA/187859/2017 “Addendum to guideline on the evaluation of medicinal 
products indicated for treatment of bacterial infections to address paediatric-specific clinical data 
requirements”, no appropriately powered efficacy studies are required in the paediatric population as 
efficacy can be extrapolated from adults provided similar exposure is achieved in the paediatric 
population. 
7.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The data on safety is limited based on the small number of patients included. However, based on the 
known safety profile of cephalosporins/beta-lactamase inhibitors with extensive use in the paediatric 
populations, a different safety profile for ceftolozane/tazobactam in patients < 18 years old compared 
with adults is not anticipated. 
The totality of the data allows for concluding that the proposed dosing recommendations are adequate for 
both ceftolozane and tazobactam for the majority of the paediatric patients and that the exposures are 
sufficiently similar to allow extrapolation of safety and efficacy from adults for cIAI, AP and cUTI 
infections in paediatric patients with eGFR >50 mL/min/1.73m2. Routine Pharmacovigilance measures, 
such as PSUR reporting, are expected to generate safety follow-up. 
The clinical safety data provides overall clinical evidence that C/T has an acceptable safety profile for use 
in paediatric patients from birth to <18 years of age with cUTI, AP and cIAI.

a different safety profile for ceftolozane/tazobactam in patients < 18 years old compared with adults is not

The totality of the data allows for concluding that the proposed dosing recommendations are adequate for

The  overall  B/R  of  Zerbaxa  is  considered  positive  for  the  extension  of  indication  to  broaden  the  current 
indications  to  include  treatment  of  paediatric  patients  with  cIAIs,  AP  and  cUTIs  with  eGFR  >50 
mL/min/1.73m2.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
Biogen Netherlands B.V. submitted on 9 March 2020 extensions of the marketing authorisation. 
Extension application to introduce a new pharmaceutical form (solution for injection), associated with a new 
strength (150 mg) and a new route of administration (subcutaneous use). The Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
(version 26.1) is updated accordingly. 
The  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  applied  for  an  addition  of  a  new  strength,  addition  of  a  new 
pharmaceutical form and an addition of a new route of administration. 
The MAH applied for the following indication for Tysabri 150mg solution for injection: 
TYSABRI  is  indicated  as  single  disease  modifying  therapy  in  adults  with  highly  active  relapsing  remitting 
multiple sclerosis (RRMS) for the following patient groups: 
• 
Patients with highly active disease activity despite a full and adequate course of treatment with at least 
one disease modifying therapy (DMT) (for exceptions and information about washout periods see sections 
4.4 and 5.1)  
or 
• 
Patients with rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis defined by 2 or more disabling 
relapses  in  one  year,  and  with  1  or  more  Gadolinium  enhancing  (Gad+)  lesions  on  brain  Magnetic 
Resonance Imaging (MRI) or a significant increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 and Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, (2)

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Natalizumab is a recombinant, humanised, anti-α4 integrin antibody and belongs to the therapeutic class of 
monoclonal  antibodies.  Natalizumab  300  mg  IV  (Tysabri)  is  currently  approved  as  a  single  DMT  for  the 
treatment  of  adult  patients  with  highly  active  RRMS.  The  approved  pharmaceutical  form  is  a  300 mg 
concentrate for solution for infusion. The infusion is to be administered over approximately 1 hour and patients 
are  to  be  observed  during  the  infusion  and  for  1 hour  after  the  completion  of  the  infusion  for  signs  and 
symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/102816/2021 
Page 8/78 
  
  
An alternative subcutaneous (SC) route of administration for natalizumab could provide additional benefit to 
patients  and  physicians,  since  SC  administration  is  considered  a  more  convenient  means  of  administration 
because it reduces the amount of time required at each treatment visit. The SC route may also be a cost-saving 
method of administration when compared with the IV route for patients, hospitals, and clinics, as reduced time 
and resources are required. 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system 
(CNS) that is characterised by inflammation, demyelination, and oligodendrocyte and neuronal loss.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
MS is one of the  most common progressive neurological diseases of adults worldwide [Collaborators 2019]. 
The disease usually begins between the ages of 20 and 40 and is twice as common in women as in men. There 
is increasing incidence and prevalence of MS in both developed and developing countries 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The cause of MS is unknown but the most striking pathogenic mechanism in MS is the immune system's attack 
and  destruction  of  the  body's  own  myelin  sheath.  Many  cells  and  molecules  of  the  immune  system—likely 
unleashed  by  T-cell  activation—participate  in  demyelination.  The  entire  cascade  of  immune  system  events 
eventually culminates in myelin destruction. The key features of this cascade are not fully understood, including 
the precise ordering of events, the antigens targeted by T cells, and the contributions of B lymphocytes, or B 
cells, and other cells of the immune system. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
The majority of MS patients (approximately 85%) present with subacute relapses or attacks, with symptoms 
and  signs  referable  to  the  CNS.The  relapse/attack  is  followed  by  a  complete  or  partial  remission/return  to 
normal,  only  to  be  followed  at  a  future  date  by  another  relapse  usually  in  a  different  CNS  location,  thus 
presenting  as  RRMS.  The  first  such  attack  is  referred  to  as  a  clinically  isolated  syndrome.  Some  patients 
(approximately 15%) present with a gradually progressive course, without an initial well-defined attack. This 
is termed primary progressive MS. Most of these patients present with features of a spinal cord syndrome. 
The diagnostic criteria for MS have been continuously evolved and include MRI with intravenous (IV) contrast 
agent containing gadolinium, lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid examination, physical examinations, and 
electrophysiological tests. 
2.1.5.  Management 
MS management includes treatment of acute relapses with high-dose steroids, DMTs, including injectables like 
interferons, glatiramer acetate, oral DMTs (teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, ozanimod, siponimod, 
cladribine),  and  infusions  (e.g.,  natalizumab,  alemtuzumab,  ocrelizumab,  mitoxantrone),  as  well  as 
symptomatic treatments for managing MS symptoms (e.g., bladder problems, fatigue, spasticity).

About the product 
Natalizumab (Tysabri) is a recombinant, humanised, anti-α4 integrin monoclonal antibody.  
Natalizumab is a selective adhesion-molecule inhibitor and binds to the α4 subunit of human integrins, which 
is highly expressed on the surface of all leukocytes, with the exception of neutrophils. Specifically, natalizumab 
binds to the α4β1 integrin, blocking the interaction with its cognate receptor, vascular cell adhesion molecule-
1 (VCAM-1), and ligands, osteopontin, and an alternatively spliced domain of fibronectin connecting segment 
1. Natalizumab also blocks the interaction of α4β7 integrin with the mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule  
1  (MAdCAM). Disruption of these  molecular interactions prevents transmigration of mononuclear leukocytes 
across the endothelium into inflamed parenchymal tissue.  
A further mechanism of action of natalizumab may be to suppress ongoing inflammatory reactions in diseased 
tissues by inhibiting the interaction of α4-expressing leukocytes with their ligands in the extracellular matrix 
and  on  parenchymal  cells.  As  such,  natalizumab  may  act  to  suppress  inflammatory  activity  present  at  the 
disease site and inhibit further recruitment of immune cells into inflamed tissues. 
Natalizumab IV received Marketing Authorisation in the EU on 27 June 2006. 
A line extension is being submitted to add a new route of administration for Tysabri (natalizumab). Currently, 
Tysabri is supplied as 300 mg natalizumab in 15 mL glass vials for IV infusion. For patient convenience, the 
MAH seeks approval for an additional route of administration, SC injection. The SC presentation will also be 
used to administer 300 mg of natalizumab and will be supplied as two 150 mg/mL pre-filled syringes, each 
containing 1 mL. The excipient formulation for Tysabri by IV infusion and SC use is the same qualitatively and 
meets the same quality standards. The only difference being the amount of excipients. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
In January 2020, a pre-submission meeting was held with PEI (Rapporteur) and the Applicant presented the 
available clinical and quality data package to support submission of the extension application. 
No central scientific advice has been received for this procedure.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Tysabri is currently authorised as a 15 mL concentrate for solution for infusion in a vial, corresponding to a 
strength  of  300  mg  (concentration  of  20  mg/mL)  (EU/1/06/346/001).  The  purpose  of  this  line  extension 
application is to add: 
- A new strength - 150 mg; 
- A new pharmaceutical form - solution for injection in pre-filled syringe (PFS); 
- A new route of administration - subcutaneous use (SC).  
The pack size consists of two PFSs per carton, each containing 1 mL of solution. The qualitative composition in 
excipients  in  the  SC  formulation  remains  the  same:  sodium  phosphate,  monobasic  monohydrate,  sodium 
phosphate dibasic heptahydrate, sodium chloride, polysorbate 80 and water for injections.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation 
Description of the manufacturing process  
The  active  substance,  also  referred  to  as  Natalizumab-SC  (solution  for  injection)  or  Natalizumab-IV 
(concentrate for solution for infusion), is manufactured at Biogen Inc, 5000 Davis Drive, Research Triangle Park 
(RTP), NC 27709-4627, USA and Biogen (Denmark) Manufacturing ApS, Biogen Allé 1, DK-3400 Hillerød (HIL), 
Denmark. The sites are EU GMP compliant.  
Information  regarding  the  manufacturing  process  and  process  controls  for  the  shared  portions  of  the 
natalizumab active substance manufacturing process is provided in the approved natalizumab-IV dossier. The 
new manufacturing steps including process hold times are described in the present submission.  
The information provided is adequate.  
Control of materials 
With regards to raw materials, solution media and cell banks, the applicant refers to information registered for 
the natalizumab-IV process. In addition, information on the filters used is provided. This is acceptable. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Critical in-process controls (CIPCs), critical in-process tests (CIPTs), in-process tests (IPTs), in-process controls 
(IPC)  and  controlled  parameters  (CP)  along  with  their  action  limits  or  in-process  specifications  for  the 
natalizumab-SC process are presented and considered acceptable.  
Process validation 
Process validation has been completed for the commercial manufacture of natalizumab-SC active substance. 
Specific studies supporting this validation included process consistency validation of and formulation/dispensing 
processes, hold time validation for process intermediates. 
Process  consistency  validation  was  based  on  manufacture  of  3  consecutive  large-scale  active  substance 
batches. During the manufacture of the three consistency batches all acceptance criteria were met, indicating 
that the process performs consistently.  
With  regard  to  intermediates,  hold  times  for  feed,  retentate  and  formulated  active  substance  have  been 
evaluated. For both the large-scale and the small-scale study, samples met their acceptance criteria at all time-
points evaluated. Based on this study, hold times for the active substance intermediates introduced with the 
new process are considered sufficiently validated. 
At large-scale, the controlled parameters and CIPCs and CIPTs were met. Furthermore, active substance from 
large scale and small scale met the active substance release specifications. Although use of more than 1 batch 
would  have  provided  a  broader  database,  the  results  show  that  the  active  substance  meets  all  release 
specifications. This is considered sufficient.  
Process  validation  was  based  on  the  successful  manufacture  of  3  consecutive  process  verification  batches. 
Results provided for CP, CIPC, IPC, CIPT and IPT show that the 3 batches comply with the required action limits 
and/or specifications.  
Qualification of active substance shipping is based on data from natalizumab-IV shipping qualification. This is 
acceptable,  since  the  transport  containers  used  for  natalizumab-SC  active  substance  are  also  used  for 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/102816/2021 
Page 11/78 
  
  
natalizumab-IV active substance and transport by refrigerated truck or air transport applies to both processes, 
natalizumab-IV and natalizumab-SC. In addition, adequate product quality prior to shipment (natalizumab-SC 
active substance)  and after shipment (natalizumab-SC finished product)  was  demonstrated based on active 
substance and finished product batch release data, indicating that active substance transport has no impact on 
product quality. Furthermore, the applicant will test the active substance according to standard prior to launch 
of the product. This is acceptable. 
Manufacturing process development 
Throughout  development,  natalizumab-SC  active  substance  had  been  manufactured  according  to  different 
processes and different manufacturing sites.  
Comparability of natalizumab-SC active substance manufactured was evaluated. The 3 process verification 
active substance batches manufactured were compared to natalizumab-SC batches from process 
manufactured at the RTP site, and commercial natalizumab-IV active substance. Based on release tests and 
additional characterisation studies, comparability of natalizumab-SC from process active substance is 
considered sufficiently demonstrated. 
Characterisation 
As the newly proposed active substance manufacturing process is an extension of the currently approved active 
substance manufacturing process, reference is made to the approved dossier regarding characterisation of the 
active substance and process-related impurities. This is acceptable.  
Results  for  product-related  impurities  (for  3  active  substance  batches)  were  presented  with  the  current 
submission  and  fall  well  within  the  range  of  batches  from  the  commercial  process.  The  impurity  level  in 
natalizumab-SC active substance batches is sufficiently low and within the range of commercial natalizumab-
IV active substance. 
Specification,  analytical  procedures,  reference  standards,  batch  analysis,  and 
container closure  
Specifications for natalizumab-SC active substance include control of identity, purity and impurities, biological 
activity and other general tests. 
 A complete set of specifications, analytical methods, method validation and batch analysis has been provided. 
 With regard to bioburden, the limit for TAMC (total aerobic microbial count) and TYMC (total yeast and moulds 
combined)  is  acceptable.  Overall,  the  specifications  for  natalizumab-SC  active  substance  are  considered 
acceptable. Adequate justification for the specifications is provided. 
Analytical methods 
Analytical  methods  for  testing  of  natalizumab-SC  are  briefly  described.  The  methods  used  are  the  same  as 
those used for commercial natalizumab-IV; where appropriate the SC active substance is diluted to 20 mg/mL 
(as the IV presentation). All methods are considered adequately validated. 
Batch analysis 
Batch release data are provided for 7 natalizumab-SC active substance batches manufactured at RTP (4 from 
process  and  3  process  consistency  batches)  and  3  process  consistency  batches  manufactured.  All  batches 
comply well with the specifications.

Reference materials 
Natalizumab-SC utilises the same reference standard as natalizumab-IV. 
Container closure system 
The natalizumab-SC active substance is stored in containers. The containers are the same as containers that 
were historically used for the natalizumab-IV active substance, specifically with the container closure referred 
to  as  “container  closure  #2”  (CCL#2).  Reference  to  the  approved  information  for  natalizumab-IV  active 
substance is accepted. 
Stability 
A shelf life of 24 months when stored at (2˚C - 8˚C) is claimed for natalizumab-SC active substance. 
Stability of natalizumab-SC active substance was evaluated in accordance with ICH Q5C. Primary stability data 
are provided for 3 batches (process verification batches for process manufactured at Biogen RTP) at long-term 
storage  condition  of  5±3°C.  In  addition,  stability  is  being  evaluated  for  the  3  process  verification  active 
substance batches manufactured. For these batches, data under accelerated conditions was provided. 
Active substance stability was assessed based on analytical methods that are also used for active substance 
release  testing,  end-of-shelf-life  acceptance  criteria  are  the  same  as  for  release,  with  two  exceptions.  The 
justifications provided are acceptable. 
The main change in natalizumab quality attributes that occurred upon storage under long-term condition is an 
increase in lower pI isoforms. This is well known from natalizumab IV. Nevertheless, at 24 months the release 
criterion for low pI isoform was still met. Under accelerated storage conditions, a faster increase in lower pI 
isoform was observed. This finding was consistent across the batches.  
The available stability data adequately support the proposed shelf life for natalizumab-SC active substance of 
24 months at (2˚C - 8˚C). 
The applicant committed to place at least one representative production batch of active substance on stability 
per year, if manufactured. This commitment is acknowledged. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development 
Description and composition of the dosage form 
Natalizumab-SC finished product is a sterile, aqueous formulation for SC administration in a PFS, with a pack 
size of two PFSs per carton.  
The PFS contains 1 mL of solution and is made of glass (Type I) with a coated with and thermoplastic rigid 
needle shield. A 27-gauge needle is pre-affixed to the syringe. Each PFS has a needle guard system that will 
automatically cover the exposed needle when the plunger is fully depressed.  
Natalizumab is formulated with the following excipients: sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate, sodium 
phosphate dibasic heptahydrate, sodium chloride, polysorbate 80 and water for injections. 
There is no overage.

Pharmaceutical development 
Formulation development 
The  formulation  of  natalizumab  SC  is  similar  to  that  of  natalizumab  IV.  The  SC  formulation  has  a  higher 
concentration of the active substance and contains the same excipients as the IV at the same concentrations, 
except for a higher concentration of one of the excipients.  
Robustness  of  the  chosen  formulation  was  evaluated  in  design  of  experiments  (DoEs)  that  varied  protein 
concentration,  content,  and  pH  of  the  formulation  and  assessed  natalizumab  stability  under  long-term, 
accelerated and stress conditions. Based on the results of the robustness study, natalizumab when formulated 
at 150 mg/mL can be expected to be stable upon storage at 5°C. 
Manufacturing process development 
Process characterisation was performed through a combination of scale-down and at-scale studies. The studies 
are considered adequate.  
Subsequently, a risk-based approach was used to define a final process control strategy, assigning criticality 
and acceptable ranges and limits for all process controls as described in section P.3.4.  
Overall, the approach is considered adequate. 
In accordance with ICH Q3D, risk assessment for elemental impurities was made. Based on the assessment, 
the limit of elemental impurities in the finished product is well below the permitted daily exposures and further 
controls are not required.  
Furthermore,  process  I  used  clinical  active  substance  while  process  II  used  active  substance  manufactured 
according to the proposed commercial process.  
The  comparability  of  finished  product  process  I  and  process  II  was  assessed  based  on  release  testing  and 
additional characterisation for selected physicochemical attributes. For comparative stability reference is made 
to section 3.2.P.8 Stability. The extent of testing is considered adequate. Comparability criteria are adequately 
justified  and  accepted.  Based  on  the  data  submitted,  finished  product  process  I  and  II  are  considered 
comparable. 
Container closure system 
The  container  closure  system  was  discussed.  An  extractables  study  was  performed  on  product-contacting 
materials and identified extractable compounds above the analytical evaluation threshold limits. Therefore, a 
subsequent leachables study was performed. This study did not identify leachables above the reporting limit at 
up to 60 months of storage at long-term and accelerated temperature. Based on a toxicological risk assessment, 
there are no concerns with regard to patients safety.   
Container performance was evaluated for the finished product (PFS assembled with plunger rod, finger flange 
and needle guard) and for the naked PFS under long-term (5°C) and accelerated (25°C) storage conditions. 
Testing on the assembled PFS  was more extensive.  Testing on the naked syringe  was performed.  The data 
indicate that the PFS remains functional for a period of 24 months under long-term storage condition.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacturing process 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/102816/2021 
Page 14/78 
  
  
Natalizumab-SC finished product manufacturers and the respective responsibilities have been listed. Assembly 
of the PFS with the needle safety device is performed. The finished product manufacturing process is a standard 
process. An overall process flow diagram has been provided.  The information on the  manufacturing process 
and  process  controls  is  satisfactory.  Information  on  controls  of  critical  steps  is  provided  and  considered 
adequate. 
Process validation 
Process  validation  at  was  performed  based  on  process  performance  consistency  for  4  finished  product  lots 
covering the anticipated range for batch size. This is endorsed. For each of the process performance consistency 
runs, all results for key and controlled parameters and (critical) in-process controls and tests conformed to the 
pre-defined acceptance criteria and were consistent across lots. Results from additional non-routine process 
characterisation  met  all  requirements.  Based  on  these  data,  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  natalizumab-SC 
finished product manufacturing process performs consistently.  
Manufacturing  process  and  hold  times  were  adequately  validated  in  challenge  studies  extending  hold  times 
beyond the maximum time.  
Container closure integrity was demonstrated for a sufficient number of syringes from each consistency batch. 
The aseptic filling process was adequately validated by media fills using process parameters that encompass 
those used during normal production.  
Filter  validation  studies  were  conducted to  demonstrate  that  the  sterilising  filter  performs  acceptably  under 
defined manufacturing process conditions. All results met their pre-defined acceptance criteria confirming that 
the sterilising filter is compatible with the product stream and produces a sterile filtrate. 
Sterilisation  of  the  primary  container  closure  system  (syringe  and  stopper)  is  performed  by  the  supplier. 
Adequacy  of  the  sterilisation  process  is  supported  by  representative  certificates  of  analysis  for  syringe  and 
stopper. 
Shipping validation was briefly summarised with regard to transport of natalizumab-SC PFS and transport of 
the  finished  goods.  For  temperature  control  of  transport,  reference  is  made  to  validation  of  temperature-
controlled trucks and shipping containers used is for transport of natalizumab-IV. This is acceptable. In addition, 
evaluation according to standard will be performed. This is endorsed.  
Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis 
Specifications for natalizumab-SC finished product include control of identity, purity and impurities, biological 
activity and other general tests. 
Testing  is  performed  on  the  unlabelled,  unassembled  PFS.  The  final  release  testing  of  the  natalizumab-SC 
finished product in the PFS assembled with plunger rod, finger flange and needle safety device must meet the 
test requirements of the visual inspection of functionality.  
The panel of release tests is in line with ICH Q6B. However, measures for functionality of the PFS were missing 
and the applicant was asked to include them as part of the release and stability specification for natalizumab-
SC finished product. In response to the request, the applicant provided a detailed justification as to why they 
consider that these tests are not necessary. Additional data were provided to support this justification.  It is 
therefore  considered  acceptable  not  to  include  testing  as  part  of  the  natalizumab-SC  finished  product 
specifications. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/102816/2021 
Page 15/78 
  
  
The  submitted  data  for  PFS  functionality  throughout  finished  product  shelf-life  is  supportive,  however,  the 
overall base is rather limited (i.e. batch stored under long-term condition). This is acknowledged. Given that 
results from the batch indicate that PFS functionality will be maintained, it is currently acceptable not to include 
it as part of the natalizumab-SC finished product stability specifications. 
The acceptance criteria for release and stability testing are considered adequate. However, the applicant was 
requested during the procedure to tighten the shelf-life specification for an acceptance criterion.  
The  information  provided  on  characterisation  of  impurities  is  considered  sufficient.  No  new  impurities  are 
formed during the finished product manufacture. 
The justifications for the individual finished product specifications as provided are considered acceptable.  
Analytical methods 
Analytical procedures which are also used for the active substance are discussed in the relevant sections of the 
dossier  (S.4.2  and  S.4.3).  Procedures  that  are  specific  for  finished  product  are  compendial  and  sufficiently 
described and verified. In addition, information on testing is provided. 
Batch analysis 
A list of natalizumab-SC finished product batches manufactured so far is provided. All natalizumab-SC finished 
product batches comply with the specifications in place at the time of testing and also comply with the proposed 
commercial  specifications.  Given  that  PFS  functionality  has  not  been  tested  routinely,  information  on  these 
parameters is not presented here. 
Reference materials 
Natalizumab-SC utilises the same reference standard as natalizumab-IV. 
Container closure system 
The container closure system for finished product is adequately described for both the primary closure system, 
i.e.  the  naked  PFS,  and  the  non-drug  contacting  secondary  containers  (finger  flange,  plunger  rod,  needle 
guard).  Representative  certificates  for  both  primary  and  secondary  container  closure  system  were  provided 
from the vendor.  
The long-term stability studies and the container closure integrity studies demonstrate the compatibility of the 
finished  product  solution with  the primary  container  closure  system  and  the ability  of  the  container  closure 
system to protect the finished product solution from microbial contamination. 
Stability of the product 
The applicant proposes a shelf-life of 2 years for natalizumab-SC finished product when stored at (2˚C - 8˚C).  
Considering the totality of the submitted finished product stability data and taking into account that formulation 
and container closure system is the same for the batches from the developmental and primary stability study, 
the proposed finished product shelf-life of 2 years at 5 ± 3°C in the outer carton can be accepted. 
The PFS can be kept in the original packaging for up to 24 hours at room temperature (up to 25o C). The PFS 
must not be returned to refrigeration.  
Adequate data demonstrating PFS functionality upon storage throughout the shelf-life was lacking. The only 
information provided on performance of the PFS is provided in section 3.2.P.2.4. In response to the concern 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/102816/2021 
Page 16/78 
  
  
raised, the applicant has provided additional information. For this batch, PFS functionality was demonstrated 
for the entire finished product shelf-life period.  
Post approval change management protocol (PACMP)  
The scope of this PACMP is to enable approval of additional purification suites for the natalizumab-SC active 
substance manufacturing process in order to ensure supply chain continuity. The scope of this PACMP is limited 
to  facilities  that  are  currently  approved  to  manufacture  commercially  licensed  Tysabri  IV  infusion  active 
substance.  
The proposed strategy for process validation is similar to the validation performed at the manufacturing site, 
except for example hold-time validation for process intermediates. Omission of these validation activities can 
be accepted based on the data available from the process validation at the manufacturing site.  
The proposed comparability test panel for release and additional characterisation testing is acceptable. 
The PACMP is considered acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
There are no changes to the adventitious agents safety evaluation.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The pharmaceutical development, manufacturing process and controls are based on the currently authorised 
300 mg concentrate for solution for infusion in a vial.  
The manufacturing process of the finished product has been satisfactorily described and validated. The quality 
of the finished product is controlled by adequate test methods and specifications. 
No major objection was identified, and the applicant has adequately addressed the  issues raised during the 
procedure. 
The  overall  quality  documentation  provided  in  this  line  extension  application  is  considered  adequate  and 
complies with existing guidelines. 
Two Recommendations have been agreed. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The overall quality of Tysabri 150 mg solution for injection is considered acceptable when used in accordance 
with the conditions defined in the SmPC. 
From a quality point of view, this line extension application is considered acceptable. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP 
recommends two points for investigation.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology 
There were no non-clinical pharmacology studies conducted to support the SC administration of natalizumab. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of different formulations of natalizumab upon SC administration were evaluated in 
the context of a nonclinical local tolerance study in non-human primates (see toxicology below). 
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
Local tolerance 
The non-clinical toxicology programme to support SC administration of natalizumab consisted of a single good 
laboratory practice (GLP) local tolerance study. 
The  objective  of  the  study  (P00002-05-01)  was  to  evaluate  PK  profiles,  bioavailability,  anti-natalizumab 
antibody formation, and local tolerability following administration of natalizumab by IV, SC, or intramuscular 
(IM) injection in non-human primates.  
Cynomolgus monkeys (3/sex/group) were administered test articles were as follows: natalizumab, 20 mg/ml 
commercial formulation (BG00002-B) administered as a single IV dose of 30 mg on day 1; natalizumab 150 
mg/ml liquid formulation (BG00002-D) administered at 150 mg SC or IM on days 1 and 36; natalizumab 120 
mg/ml lyophilised formulation, administered at 120 mg SC or IM on days 1 and 36.  
The PK profiles of the high-concentration liquid and lyophilized test articles were assessed through Day 36 of 
the study. Injection site biopsies were performed on animals in the SC and IM dose groups on Day 39 of the 
study for histopathologic assessment of signs of local tolerability. 
There were no test article-related effects on clinical signs, food consumption or bodyweight (BW) associated 
with  commercial  natalizumab  administered  by  IV  injection  or  high-concentration  liquid  or  lyophilized 
natalizumab administered by SC and IM injection. 
Increases in peripheral blood lymphocytes, and to a lesser extent eosinophils, basophils, and unclassified cells, 
compared  to  pre-study  (baseline)  values  were  noted  in  all  groups;  these  increases  were  regarded  as  an 
expected pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of the test article. Duration of this effect was longer in animals receiving 
120 or 150 mg compared to those receiving 30 mg. 
Mean  time  to  reach  maximum  serum  concentration  values  (Tmax)  was  achieved  immediately  after  IV 
administration, and delayed, but more rapidly following IM than SC injection for the high-concentration test 
articles.  Mean  maximum  serum  concentration  values  (Cmax)  values  were  less  than  dose  proportional  across 
routes when compared to the commercial IV dose group but were consistent for the test articles administered 
extravascularly. The mean values for half-life (t½) were comparable across all dose groups irrespective of the 
route of administration. Both mean area-under-the-concentration-time-curve from time zero to the last time 
point (AUClast) and area-under-the-concentration-time-curve from time zero to infinity (AUCinf) were greater 
than dose proportional in the SC and IM dose groups, indicating 100% relative bioavailability and consistency 
following extravascular administration. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/102816/2021 
Page 18/78 
  
  
Saturation of α4-integrin peaked on Day 1 and returned to predose levels by Day 22 IV injection; saturation 
peaked between Days 1 and 8 in the SC and IM dose groups and remained above predose levels through Day 
36. Some dose-dependency was observed, given that mean α 4-integrin saturation was greater in the liquid 
high-concentration SC and IM dose groups compared to lyophilized SC and IM dose groups beginning on Day 
15. 
Immunogenicity was relatively consistent across all dose groups and did not appear to be greater following SC 
or IM dosing when compared to the IV route. 
Local  injection  site  reactions  (ISRs)  included  slight  to  severe  erythema  consistent  with  procedure-related 
bruising, primarily in the IV dose group, and very slight to severe edema in individual animals after the second 
IM  dose  of  either  the  high-concentration  or  lyophilized  test  article.  Histopathological  evaluation  of  biopsy 
samples  from  SC  and  IM  injection  sites  3  days  after  the  second  dose  on  Day  36  revealed  minor  changes, 
including focal degeneration and/or focal necrosis of the subcutaneous or muscular tissue. Animals that received 
the lyophilized test article via SC or IM injection had only slightly more severe local histopathological changes 
than those receiving the high-concentration test article. Overall, changes at the injection site following SC and 
IM administration of the high-concentration liquid and lyophilized formulations were not regarded as adverse. 
In summary, the liquid high-concentration and lyophilized high-concentration natalizumab was well tolerated 
following SC or IM injection in cynomolgus monkeys; both produced anticipated increases in peripheral blood 
lymphocyte counts that were comparable to, but of slightly greater persistence than, those observed following 
a single 30 mg IV dose at the commercial formulation. Local ISR were limited to procedure-related erythema; 
edema typically followed the second IM dose of either the liquid or lyophilized test articles, with minor local 
histological focal changes being associated with both routes of extravascular administration. 
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Natalizumab is a humanised IgG4 antibody, a protein consisting of natural amino acids, the use of which will 
not alter the concentration or distribution of the substance in the environments. Therefore, natalizumab is not 
expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In  order  to  support  the  SC  route  of  administration  the  Applicant  submitted  a  GLP  local  tolerance  study  in 
cynomolgus monkeys. 
The  study  evaluated  two  different  routes  of  extravascular  injection  (SC  and  IM)  in  comparison  to  IV 
administration.  Natalizumab  was  well  tolerated  in  all  groups.  Regardless  of  the  route of  administration,  the 
main findings were related to the PD effect of natalizumab with a longer duration in animals treated with a high 
dose. Local ISR at the SC injection sites were limited to procedure-related erythema and edema and minor 
focal histological changes and are considered non-adverse. 
The study assessed tolerability to two different natalizumab high-dose formulations (liquid and lyophilised) in 
comparison to the commercial IV formulation. It is noted that none of the high-dose formulations represents 
the  currently  proposed  natalizumab-SC  DP  formulation.  Given  that  the  currently  proposed  natalizumab-SC 
formulation  uses  the  same  excipients  as  the  commercial  natalizumab-IV  formulation,  and  there  is  already 
clinical  experience  with  the  current  natalizumab-SC  formulation,  further  non-clinical  assessment  of  local 
tolerability of the natalizumab-SC presentation is not warranted.

2.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Together with the non-clinical programme as reviewed at the time of marketing authorisation application (MAA), 
the non-clinical study submitted with the present application is considered adequate and sufficient to support 
SC administration of natalizumab. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with good clinical practices (GCP) as claimed by the Applicant. 
The Applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
•  Tabular overview of clinical studies 
In order to support the 300 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) SC regimen as an alternative to the currently approved

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Overview studies 
The  PK,  PD,  (α4  integrin  saturation,  sVCAM  receptor  measurement,  lymphocyte  count,  and  lymphocyte 
subsets), and immunogenicity of natalizumab following SC administration were evaluated in a completed Phase 
1 study (Study 101MS102 [DELIVER]) in participants with RRMS or secondary progressive MS (SPMS). This 
study  is  two-parted,  Part  I  accounts  for  a  single  dose  intensive  PK/PD  phase,  Part  II  for  repeated-dose 
treatment (period of 6 months). 
Trough natalizumab samples have been collected from a completed randomised, blinded Phase 2 study (Study 
101MS206 [REFINE]), where safety, tolerability, and efficacy of IV and SC was explored in participants with 
RRMS over a 72-week period. 
Study 101MS102 
Approximately 60 natalizumab-treated subjects from  Groups A, B, C, D, and  E  of Study 101MS102 were to 
participate in the lymphocyte subset sub study to assess the effect of natalizumab on blood levels of lymphocyte 
subsets,  including  CD34+  cells.  Blood  and  urine  samples  were  stored  for  possible  future  John  Cunningham 
Virus(JCV)-related research.  
Study 101MS206 
Participants had previously received IV natalizumab for at least 12 months and were randomised to receive 
natalizumab 300 mg IV Q4W, IV Q12W (every 12 weeks), SC Q4W, or SC Q12W or natalizumab 150 mg IV or 
SC Q12W for up to 60 weeks. 
Summary of PK data and data analysis 
Study 101MS102 
The PK profile of each dose of natalizumab was assessed by determining the serum concentration-time profiles 
of natalizumab given by the IV, SC, and IM routes of administration from serum samples taken prior to and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/102816/2021 
Page 21/78 
  
  
 
 
over the 56-day period during Part I. Samples were taken predose, at 4, 24, 48, 72, 96 hours postdose and 7, 
14, 21, 28, 35, 42, and 56 days post dose. Additional sample collections during Part II allowed assessments of 
drug accumulation with each dose (weeks 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, and 32). 
A total of 1229 samples were measured for natalizumab. The concentration of natalizumab in serum was to be 
determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The ELISA assay is based upon the binding 
of natalizumab to an immobilized monoclonal antibody (12C4) that binds to the VLA-4 binding domain. This 
complex is then detected with labelled anti-human IgG4-AP. Samples with concentrations below the lower limit 
of quantification (LLOQ) (0.500 ug/mL) were reported as below the limit of quantitation (BLQ). 
Of those, 159 (12.9%) samples were reported as BLQ. Sixty-six of these BLQ samples were collected pre-dose 
and were assigned a value of zero. An additional 25 BLQ samples were collected in some subjects during times 
when anti-natalizumab antibodies were positive. All remaining BLQ data were assigned as “missing” for the PK 
analyses. 
Non-compartment analysis was used to determine Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-last, AUCinf, volume of distribution (Vd) or 
apparent volume of distribution (V/F), clearance (CL) or apparent clearance (CL/F), and t½, as appropriate. 
Absolute bioavailability after SC administration was also calculated using the ratios of AUC corrected for dose 
by each route of administration. 
Study 101MS206 
A validated sandwich ELISA method was used for PK measurements. A total of 1311 PK human samples from 
289  study  subjects  were  analysed  in  a  total  of  70  assay  runs  for  the  determination  of  natalizumab 
concentration. Samples were collected at Day 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, and Day 56 after the Week 48 dose of study 
treatment. 
The  working  range  of  the  assay  was  between  0.500  μg/mL  (LLOQ),  and  32.0  μg/mL  (upper  Limit  of 
quantification (ULOQ)). Samples that returned  values above this range were diluted into range with  pooled 
normal human serum and retested in the assay. Samples in which levels of natalizumab could not be quantified 
were reported as BLQ. 
Natalizumab concentrations from samples collected every 3 months were summarised by treatment arm with 
summary statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, and range). PK analyses were performed on the PK 
population. Of the 289 randomized subjects who  received at least 1 dose  of  study treatment, 273 subjects 
were included in the PK population. 
In total, 162 participants received at least 1 SC dose of natalizumab of different regimens in both studies. 26 
participants were enrolled in Study 101MS102 (Cohorts B and D) and 136 participants in Study 101MS206. Of 
these 162 participants, 53 received a 300 mg dose (Q12W), and 38 received a 150 mg dose (Q12W) and 71 
patients (n=26; 101MS102 and n=45; 101MS206) received 300 mg SC (Q4W).  
Bioanalytics 
An overview of the bioanalytical methods used throughout clinical development of natalizumab was provided. 
Natalizumab  concentration  in  human  serum  was  assessed  by  ELISA.  Based  on  the  bioanalytical  reports 
submitted, the assay performance can be considered acceptable for both studies. Incurred sample re-analysis 
was  only  performed  for  study  101MS206  and  not  for  study  101MS102.  This  could  be  accepted,  given  that 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/102816/2021 
Page 22/78 
  
  
incurred sample re-analysis was not a regulatory requisite in EU at the time when sample analysis for 101MS102 
was performed. 
Validation  reports  for  the  validation  of  PD  assays  were  submitted  for  2  analytical  methods  used  in  study 
101MS206, i.e. the flow cytometry assay "Alpha-4 Expression/Saturation and VCAM-1 binding Assay" and the 
sandwich  ELISA  to  measure  soluble  VCAM-1  (sVCAM-1)  in  human  serum.  Both  methods  were  considered 
adequately validated. Upon request, information on the validation for the PD methods used in study 101MS102 
was  provided  by  the  Applicant.  The  Alpha4  saturation  assay  was  qualified;  the  sVCAM-1  assay  was  a 
commercially  available  assay.  The  provided  performance  reports  demonstrate  that  the  assays  performed 
satisfactorily during analysis of samples from study 101MS102.  
The  presence  of  antibodies  to  natalizumab  in  human  serum  (ADA)  was  assessed  using  an  ELISA.  The  test 
strategy was based on a screening assay and a subsequent confirmatory assay. The ADA method was validated 
for use by Focus Diagnostics in 2006. The assay could be considered validated with regard to intra- and inter-
assay precision, robustness and inter-laboratory comparability. However, the validation approach is not fully in 
line with current recommendations on assessment of immunogenicity. E.g. information on assay sensitivity, 
drug tolerance, matrix effect or a possible impact of ADA on natalizumab efficacy were missing. Upon request, 
the  Applicant  clarified  that  the  assay  used  for  detection  of  ADA  in  studies  101MS102  and  101MS106  is  a 
modified version of the ELISA method used to support MAA. The method had been developed at Biogen and 
validated at Focus. Sensitivity of the assay was 500 ng/ml, selectivity for matrix interference had been inferred 
from the original ADA assay, based on similarities between assay formats and critical reagents used. This could 
be accepted.  
Absorption  
Absorption is well captured due to dense sampling and allowed the estimation of bioavailability based on direct 
AUC comparison (50-70%). From population PK (popPK) updated with SC PK data, bioavailability was estimated 
to 82.1%, and an absorption rate constant was estimated to be 0.0111 1/hr. PopPK derived bioavailability of 
the  SC  formulation  is  supported  by  exposure  simulations  and  comparison  with  PK  observations.  Mean  Cmax 
values  after  SC  dosing  were  33%  to  36.7%  of  the  values  achieved  following  IV  administration  of  300  mg 
natalizumab. After the absorption phase, IV and SC PK profiles appear comparable. 
Bioequivalence 
Two bioequivalence studies have been completed (Study C-1805 and Study C-1806) indicating PK comparability 
of  the  manufactured  products  (BG00002-A,  BG00002-B).  In  the  clinical  studies  to  support  the  filing  of 
natalizumab SC, formulations BG00002-E, BG00002-D, and BG00002-H have been used.  
Distribution 
Mean Vd in Study 101MS102 was calculated to 3.456 ± 1.4041 L following 300 mg SC Q4W.  Mean volume 
slightly exceeds the one following IV route of administration in this study (mean:  2.327 ± 0.9598 L). Median 
steady-state Vd was estimated to 5.58L 95% Confidence Interval (CI) (5.27-5.92 L).

Elimination 
Natalizumab is catabolized by general protein degradation processes. It is eliminated by catabolism into amino 
acids in the lysosomal system; typical small-molecule metabolic pathways are not expected to contribute to its 
clearance indicating a reduced potential for direct drug-drug interactions via Cytochromes P450 enzymes. 
The  Phase  1  study  (Study  101MS102)  indicated  that  the  elimination  t½  is  similar  between  both  routes  of 
administrations in patient group RRMS: 300 mg IV 272.5 ± 84.7h; 300 mg SC 291.4 ± 72.9h. Data was limited 
to 672h. In SPMS patients, t½ was observed to be slightly higher: 386.08 ± 91.805h. The estimated median 
t½ by popPK was 26.8 days. Variability of t½ in terms of the 2.5th and the 97.5th percentile based on popPK 
ranges from 11.6 to 46.2 days. 
Mean CL/F was calculated to be 12.1± 3.90 ml/h after SC 300mg in SPMS patients and 16.4 ± 7.03 ml/h after 
SC 300 mg in RRMS patients. After IV 300mg, mean CL were calculated to be 10.2 ml/h in SPMS patients and 
9.3 ml/h in RRMS patients. Population median estimate for linear CL was 6.21 mL/h with 95%CI (5.60-6.70 
mL/h). 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality 
In Study 101MS206, doses of 300 mg and 150 mg have been tested following Q4W and Q12W dosing regimens. 
Due  to  the  high  percentage  of  BLQ  samples  following  Q12W  dosing  intervals,  no  conclusion  on  dose 
proportionality could be drawn based on the available data set.  
Simulations  of  mean  trough  levels  at  steady  state  based  on  the  updated  popPK  model  indicated  an  overall 
dose-proportional increase in exposure (trough level) with dose over the range from 300 mg to 450 mg SC. 
Time dependency 
101MS102 
After SC administration of 300 mg natalizumab, Cmax values reached by approximately 1 week.  The mean Cmax 
after 300 mg SC administration in SPMS participants was 41.2 μg/mL (range 22.0 to 66.4 μg/mL); in RRMS 
participants at the same dose, the Cmax was 35.4 μg/mL (range 22.0 to 47.8 μg/mL).  
The mean Cmax following SC administration in both populations was lower than that for the 300 mg IV arm in 
the corresponding populations. For SPMS patients, mean Cmax after IV dosing was 112.1 μg/mL (range 59.2 to 
156.0 μg/mL, and for RRMS patients mean Cmax after IV dosing was 107.1 μg/mL (range 78.9 to 164.0 μg/mL). 
Mean Cmax values after SC dosing were 33% to 36.7% of the values achieved following IV administration of 
300 mg natalizumab. 
The mean AUCinf after a single 300 mg SC dose in observed in SPMS participants was 27,431.9 μg*h/mL (range 
15,009 to 45,904 μg*h/mL).  In RRMS participants, mean AUCinf was 21,449.7 μg*h/mL (range 9,893 to 36,836 
μg*h/mL). 
Mean  natalizumab  trough  concentrations  collected  prior  to  each  dose  during  Part  II  show  accumulation 
occurring with each successive dose, which was comparable between the routes of administration. Steady state 
is indicated to be reached within 16-32 weeks post dose.

Study 101MS206 
Trough levels collected every three months showed that SC level is continuously below the IV trough levels of 
natalizumab following 300 mg Q4W but overall at the level of steady state from pre-treatment (300 mg Q4W 
IV). The achieved exposure ranges in terms of steady-state trough concentration (Ctrough_ss) of both routes of 
administration are highly overlapping. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Inter-individual variability (IIV) of PK parameter (Cl, Vd, absorption rate constant Ka) was assessed using popPK 
modelling. IIV was moderate to high for Ka. 
Bioavailability varied between non-compartmental analysis (50%-70%) and popPK analysis (82%) 
Overall, variability for PK parameters after SC administration did not appear any greater than IV  dosing. PK 
profiles  after  IV  and  SC  administration  of  natalizumab  (Study  101MS102)  indicated  no  major  deviation  of 
natalizumab disposition in participants with different patient population RRMS and SPMS. 
Special populations 
No  further  analysis  with  respect  to  PK  in  special  populations  has  been  conducted  in  the  context  of  this 
procedure. Covariates on PK were tested during the model update of popPK including IV and SC data. 
The  final  popPK  model  of  natalizumab  included  3  effects  that  were  statistically  significant  in  the  covariate 
selection: Formulation on CL (Phase II formulations used in earlier IV studies LNZRSH-A and LNZRSH-B versus 
all other formulation), BW effect on CL, BW effect of V2. The effect of ADA on CL was added to the base model 
before covariate selection. CL increased by approximately 2.17-fold for the Phase 2 formulations. CL and V2 
increased as BW increased. CL was 2.54-fold higher for participants who were positive for ADA compared with 
those who were not. 
Exposure simulation results showed - regardless of pre-treatment to steady state following 300 mg Q4W IV - 
a decrease in Ctrough_ss values with BW (from 30 mg/l to about 18 mg/l) that is expected due to the fix dose 
regimens.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Natalizumab is a recombinant, humanised, anti-α4 integrin antibody derived from a monoclonal antibody raised 
against  human  α4  integrin.  The  α4  subunit  of  human  integrins  is  highly  expressed  on  the  surface  of  all 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/102816/2021 
Page 25/78 
  
  
leukocytes, with the exception of neutrophils. Specifically, natalizumab binds to the α4β1 integrin, blocking the 
interaction with its cognate receptor, VCAM-1, and ligands, osteopontin, and an alternatively spliced domain of 
fibronectin connecting segment 1. 
Natalizumab also blocks the interaction of α4β7 integrin with the mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1. 
This  prevents  transmigration  of  mononuclear  leukocytes  across  the  endothelium  into  inflamed  parenchymal 
tissue. A further mechanism of action of natalizumab may be to suppress ongoing inflammatory reactions in 
diseased tissues by inhibiting the interaction of α4-expressing leukocytes with their ligands in the extracellular 
matrix and on parenchymal cells. This way, natalizumab may act to suppress inflammatory activity present at 
the disease site leading to the inhibition of further recruitment of immune cells into inflamed tissues. 
PK and PD simulations based on a natalizumab population PK/PD model connecting serum natalizumab levels 
with α4-Integrin Saturation support the rationale for the SC dose of 300 mg Q4W. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
Natalizumab binds specifically to the α4 integrins being expressed on the surface of certain peripheral blood 
leukocytes, thereby disrupting the interaction of integrins with endogenous receptors like VCAM-1 and MAdCAM 
on  endothelial  cells.  The blockade  leads  in  turn to  increased  peripheral  cell  counts  of  those  leukocytes  that 
express α4 integrins. 
In Study 101MS02, α4-integrin saturation, sVCAM serum concentration, lymphocyte count measurements and 
lymphocyte subsets have been measured as PD marker/endpoints.  
In Study 101MS266, PD endpoints measured were α4-integrin saturation and CD49d expression. 
The  choice  of  PD  marker  were  deemed  reasonable  to  compare  PD  effects  from  IV  and  SC  formulation  and 
dosing. 
Study 101MS102 
Overall, data from 101MS102  indicated no major deviations between IV and SC profiles with respect to the 
here presented PD endpoints. Of note, although PK Ctrough levels from 84 day and later were lower following SC 
administration of natalizumab, integrin saturation is observed to be higher (Day 84 – Day 168) or equal (> 
Day 168) compared to mean IV observations. 
Mean integrin saturation was 90.0% or greater within 24 hours after the administration of either IV or SC doses 
and  remained  elevated,  with  mean  values  at  or  above  80.0%,  for  up  to  4  weeks  (672.0  h)  after  dosing. 
Saturation began to decline at about 6 weeks, with the mean saturation between 30.0% and 60.0% by 8 weeks 
following natalizumab administration for all treatment arms.  
Mean sVCAM observed minimum % saturation/nadir value (Rmin) was 220.4 ng/mL (range 143 to 333 ng/mL) 
for SPMS participants and 205.6 ng/mL (range 157 to 300 ng/mL) for RRMS patients, respectively, following 
SC administration of natalizumab. This translated into -59.81% (range -66.7% to -49.2%) and -58.36% (range 
-66.0% to  -46.0%) change from  baseline  for SPMS  and  RRMS participants, respectively. The mean time to 
reach the nadir after SC administration was 20.2 days (range 3.9 to 57.0 days) for SPMS and 12.6 (range 7.0 
to 28.0 days) for RRMS. Mean sVCAM Rmin was 232.1 ng/mL (range 129 to 386 ng/mL) for SPMS participants 
and 209.6 ng/mL (range 113 to 336 ng/mL) for RRMS participants following IV administration of natalizumab. 
This translates into -55.77% (range -65.5% to -35.3%) and -57.29% (range -62.6% to -47.7%) change from 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/102816/2021 
Page 26/78 
  
  
baseline for both patient subgroups, respectively. The mean time to reach the nadir after IV administration was 
15.6 days (range 3.0 to 42.1 days) and 7.7 days (range 3.0 to 14.1 days) for SPMS and RRMS participants, 
respectively  reflecting  a  reduction  in  sVCAM  as  a  feedback  response  to  the  reduced  number  of  α4-integrin 
receptors available to interact with sVCAM. 
Lymphocyte subsets evaluation after a single dose and at Week 32 after multiple dosing of natalizumab showed 
an increase in absolute cell counts was observed in total leukocytes , monocytes, and dendritic cells, as well as 
all lymphocyte subsets examined (CD4+ T, CD8+ T, NK cells, B cells, and CD34+ HPCs), for both the IV and 
SC groups, however characterized with a high inter-patient variability. 
A slight effect of route of natalizumab administration could be observed for monocytes count over time. Mean 
% change from baseline was 20-30% higher in the IV subgroup. 
Study 101MS206 
Predose α4-integrin saturation measurements at Baseline were in the range of 78.2% to 81.8% for all treatment 
arms  of  Study  101MS206.  Throughout  the  randomised  treatment  period,  a  high  mean  trough  α4-  integrin 
saturation was maintained for all participants in the 300 mg SC or IV Q4W treatment arms, ranging from 76.8% 
to  83.1%.  This  indicated  that  difference  in  mean  Ctrough  values  following  300  mg  Q4W  IV  and  SC  were  not 
translated into differences in integrin saturation levels. 
Similarly,  the  measurement  of  CD49d  expression  (based  on  measurement  of  mean  fluorescence  intensity 
[MFI]) was similar at baseline but increased by the week 12 Visit and remained elevated during the randomised 
treatment period for all Q12W treatment arms. In contrast, measurement of CD49d expression was consistent 
with baseline through the week 60 Visit for the IV and SC Q4W treatment arms (median range 300 mg IV Q4W, 
220.0 to 231.0 MFI; 300 mg SC Q4W, 211.0 to 241.5 MFI). 
Lymphocyte subsets including CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, total B cells [CD19+], memory B cells 
[CD19+/CD38-/CD27+(CD19+)], and natural killer cells [NK; CD3- /CD16+CD56+] were evaluated over time. 
During the randomised treatment period, results from the 300 mg Q4W SC arm indicated no significant changes 
in absolute numbers and percentage of lymphocyte subsets in comparison with the 300 mg IV Q4W arm.  
Immunogenicity 
Study 101MS102  
The percentage of patients who transiently developed ADA was slightly higher in the SC group (23%) compared 
to  the  IV  treatment  group  (15%).  Of  note,  one  participant  in  the  SC  treatment  arm  who  was  persistently 
positive for ADA development was withdrawn from the study. 
Study 101MS206 
None of the participants was tested positive for ADA in the natalizumab 300 mg IV Q4W or 300 mg SC Q4W 
arms during the randomised treatment period.  
The influence of ADAs on the PK of IV natalizumab was evaluated during a parallel type II variation for updating 
popPK  analysis.  The  influence  was  substantial  (persistent  ADAs  lead  to  a  2.5  fold  increase  in  CL)  and  is 
adequately described in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) of both the IV and SC formulation. Of 
note, ADA influence on CL (IV formulation) was originally estimated to a 2.9 fold increase, which is deemed 
comparable, although non-linear clearance has been newly integrated in the popPK model by update.   
The Applicant tried to investigate the influence of ADAs on PK/PD and efficacy in participants of SC studies. 
Given the small sample sizes involved, firm conclusions regarding the impact of transient or persistent ADA 
Assessment report

Page 27/78 
  
  
development on the PK/PD and efficacy of SC natalizumab could not be drawn. This was endorsed. Besides, 
frequency of ADAs appeared not be higher after SC vs. IV administration. Thus, it could be agreed that guidance 
and recommendations regarding ADA vigilance provided in the SmPC for the SC formulation are appropriate. 
Secondary pharmacology 
In anti-JCV antibody positive patients, extended interval dosing (EID) of natalizumab (average dosing interval 
of  approximately  6  weeks  [Q6W])  was  suggested  to  be  associated  with  a  lower  Progressive  Multifocal 
Leukoencephalopathy (PML) risk compared to approved dosing interval of 4 weeks (SmPC, Section 4.4).  
For the SC route of administration, the association between risk of PML and the dosing interval is unknown. 
Population PK/PD 
A popPK/α4 integrin model was developed using IV and SC clinical data, describing the relationship between 
natalizumab binding and α4-integrin saturation using a model exhibiting sigmoidal behaviour of the maximum 
observed biologic effect (Emax). Based on this model, the concentration at 50% of maximum observed biologic 
effect  (EC50)  is  estimated to  be  2.51  mg/L,  the  concentration  at  80%  of  maximum  observed biologic  effect 
(EC80) is estimated to 10 mg/L. In terms of PD parameters, formulation effect on Emax and Hill coefficient was 
estimated for 2 formulation groupings, 1. LNZRSH-B, BG00002-D, BG00002-H and 2. LNZRSH-A, BG00002-A, 
BG00002-B, relative to the commercial formulation, BG00002-E.  
The final PD model indicated that the binding of natalizumab to α4 integrin was affected by age and natalizumab 
formulation  (phase  II  formulations  used  in  earlier  IV  studies  LNZRSH-A  and  LNZRSH-B  versus  all  other 
formulation). Younger participants tended to have different binding characteristics relative to older participants, 
expressed by the model-estimated parameters Emax and Hill coefficient. These simulations indicated that the 
impact of age on α4-integrin saturation is expected to be minimal. No dose adjustment is recommended based 
on age for natalizumab. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
PK results from Study 101MS102 and Study 101MS206 indicated that, due to the absorption process, exposure 
after 300 mg Q4W SC was markedly lower than after 300 mg Q4W IV in terms of Cmax, AUC and slightly but 
consistently  reduced  in  terms  of  mean  Ctrough  levels  whereas  comparable  integrin  saturation  and  PD  effects 
were observed in both groups. In contrast, PD results following the SC route of administration of natalizumab 
showed similar target engagement level and subsequent PD  response,  as measured  by  α4-integrin binding, 
CD49d expression, sVCAM levels, and lymphocyte counts. This suggested that the high peaks in natalizumab 
concentration following IV dosing might not be required for certain PD effects.  
Simulations based on natalizumab PK/α4 integrin model with a different dosing regimen ranging from 300 mg 
to 450 mg SC Q4W indicated that administering natalizumab 300 mg Q4W SC will result comparable Ctrough 
(slightly below the exposure range following 300 mg Q4W IV). Given the established PK/PD relationship, the 
highly  overlapping  PK  exposure  range  will  result  in  comparable  α4  integrin  levels  to  those  of  the  clinically 
approved 300 mg Q4W IV administration. Large increases in serum concentrations >10 mg/L (= EC80 level) 
will  result  in  only  marginal  changes  in  α4-integrin  binding.  Thus,  a  reduction  in  Cmax  by  70%  following  SC 
administration compared with IV did not result in a proportional drop in α4-integrin binding. In addition, the 
lowest observed Cmax (22 mg/L) after the 300 mg SC dose of natalizumab is still more than twice the EC80. 
Exposure simulations using the updated popPK model indicated that overall, 83% - 93% of participants in each 
BW category (<59 kg, 60-79 kg, 80-99 kg, >100 kg) are predicted to reach Ctrough_ss above the EC80 level of 
10 mg/L.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
With respect to bioanalytical methods used, data on qualification/validation of the PD methods used in studies 
101MS102 and 101MS206 were considered acceptable. The validation approach for the ADA assay is not fully 
in line with current recommendations on assessment of immunogenicity. Nevertheless, based on the additional 
information provided, the assay could be considered suitable.   
Discrepancies between non-compartmental analysis and popPK analysis were detected, especially with respect 
to  bioavailability  after  SC  administration.  PopPK  derived  bioavailability  (82%)  of  the  SC  formulation  was 
supported by exposure simulations and comparison with PK observations. 
Although  visual  predictive  checks  stratified  by  route  of  administration  were  of  acceptable  quality,  covariate 
effects such as ADA formation on PK, impact of BW or formulation on PK (including F) could not be fully assessed 
due to the limited amount and time scale of SC data and imbalanced data resulting from the respective routes 
of administration. However, a thorough description of Ctrough levels is deemed necessary to liaise PK with PD 
(integrin saturation) and probable safety concerns. 
The influence of ADAs on the PK of IV natalizumab was evaluated during a parallel type II variation for updating 
popPK  analysis.  The  influence  was  substantial  (persistent  ADAs  lead  to  a  2.5  fold  increase  in  CL)  and  is 
adequately  described  in  the  SmPC  of  both  the  IV  and  SC  formulation.  Of  note,  ADA  influence  on  CL  (IV 
formulation) was originally estimated to a 2.9 fold increase, which is deemed comparable, although non-linear 
clearance has been newly integrated in the popPK model by update.   
The Applicant tried to investigate the influence of ADAs on PK/PD and efficacy in participants of SC studies. 
Given the small sample sizes involved, firm conclusions regarding the impact of transient or persistent ADA 
development on the PK/PD and efficacy of SC natalizumab could not be drawn. This was endorsed. Besides, 
frequency of ADAs appeared not be higher after SC vs. IV administration. Thus, it could be agreed that guidance 
and recommendations regarding ADA vigilance provided in the SmPC for the SC formulation are appropriate. 
Given the uncertainty in PK after SC administration of 300 mg natalizumab and known PK characteristics (non-
linear CL, BW effect on PK) some other concerns have been raised and supporting simulations were requested 
with  respect  to  PK  and  PK/PD  of  natalizumab.  Summary  statistics  and  simulation  results  indicated  overall 
comparable Ctrough_ss values after 300 mg Q4W dosing IV and SC, respectively, regardless of pre-treatment to 
steady state following 300 mg Q4W IV. 
Exposure simulations based on the updated popPK model  assuming the 300 mg Q4W SC regimen showed a 
decrease  in  Ctrough_ss  values  with  BW  (from  30  mg/l  to  about  18  mg/l)  that  is expected  due  to  the  fix  dose 
regimens. Differences between the BW categories in achieved steady state level did not translate into major 
differences in α4-integrin level saturation (overall 82%-85%). This is plausible as given the expected level of 
Ctrough_ss, overall, 83-93% of participants in each BW category (<59 kg, 60-79 kg, 80-99 kg, >100 kg) were 
predicted to have Ctrough above the EC80 level of 10 mg/L. 
Simulated Ctrough_ss reached following an EID of Q6W were however significantly lower (median Ctrough_ss ~ 6 
mg/l) compared to Q4W dosing which were  about 3-  to 4 fold higher. PK/PD  predictions indicated that this 
translates into lower percentage in median integrin saturation (~70-73%) compared to Q4W dosing. Overall, 
SC  exposure  and  response  following  300  mg  Q6W  SC  was  predicted  to  be  slightly  lower  comparted  to  IV 
administration of 300 mg natalizumab Q6W at steady state but highly overlapping. Stratification by BW groups 
indicated a decrease in Ctrough_ss from about 10 mg/l to 5 mg/l. Accordingly, this translated into lower integrin 
saturation levels (median: 65-75%). More explicitly, the majority of patients of all BW groups were expected 
not to reach the EC80 level of 10 mg/l, even at the lowest BW category (60%) but increasing with BW (up to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/102816/2021 
Page 29/78 
  
  
88%). Based on the current data, no conclusion on reduced or maintained efficacy following EID (Q6W) could 
be drawn. Clinical relevance is investigated in Study 101MS329. 
The provided simulation results however showed an increase in Ctrough with BW (>100 kg) compared to the BW 
group 80-99kg which is not plausible due to the fix dosing regimen. The Appliant was asked to discuss this 
finding,  taking  the  characteristics  of  the  simulated  patient  population  and  identified  covariates  on  PK  into 
account. In response, the Applicant clarified that the former virtual population for simulations consisted of a 
non-uniform distribution of sample size across weight categories causing the finding of concern. PK simulations 
were adapted assuming a uniform distribution (1000 patients for each BW group <59 kg, 60-79 kg, 80-99 kg, 
>100 kg). In comparison to the former analysis (day 120 simulations following an adjustment to sample size) 
a clear influence of BW on exposure reached at steady state became apparent. The percentages of participants 
with  Ctrough_ss  <  10  mg/L  for  each  BW  group  after  SC  and  IV  administration  were  provided  and  resulted  in 
comparable values. In patients weighing 80 to 99 kg, the predicted percentage of patients with Ctrough_ss < 10 
mg/L is 14.5% and 14.4% following SC and IV administration, respectively. As expected, due to the impact of 
BW  on  PK,  the  predicted  percentages  increase  in  patients  at  BW  >100  kg  (SC:  26.4%;  IV:  25.5%)  again 
regardless of the mode of administration.  
Predicted degree of corresponding α4-integrin saturation assuming a uniform distribution (1000 patients for 
each BW group <59 kg, 60-79 kg, 80-99 kg, >100 kg), again, was overall comparable between weight groups. 
Median saturation at Ctrough [%] ranged from 80 to about 85 %, indicating that differences in Ctrough levels at 
steady state have no pivotal effect on saturation levels achieved.   
Some other concerns have been raised for clarification with respect to the formulations used, immunogenicity 
data and presentation of PK and PD data. From this, an adequate presentation of PD data over time with a 
measure  of  variability  was  requested  (Studies  101MS102  and  101MS206).  The  respective  graphical 
representations  provided  showing  PD  results  over  time  following  SC  and  IV  treatment  indicate  overall 
comparability between modes of administration 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  PK  data  package  is  deemed  overall  sufficient  to  describe  single  dose  and  multiple  dose  PK  after  SC 
administration of 300 mg natalizumab.  
PK and several PD markers were measured in SC and IV arms of 101MS102 and 101MS206 to directly compare 
the  PD  following  300  mg  Q4W  IV  or  SC.  Overall,  PD  and  PK/PD  results  following  300  mg  Q4W  showed 
comparability of the SC and IV route of administration. PopPK and PK/PD modelling support the selected dose 
of 300 mg for SC administration using the Q4W dosing regimen.

Methods 
In order to support the 300 mg Q4W SC regimen as an alternative to the currently approved 300 mg Q4W IV 
route of administration, the Applicant presented efficacy data from 2 clinical studies:  
- 
- 
the phase I study 101MS102 (DELIVER) Table 3 
the phase II study 101MS206 (REFINE) Table 4 
In these studies, a total of 71 patients were exposed to the 300 mg natalizumab Q4W SC regimen. In addition, 
53 were exposed to 300 mg Q12W SC, and 38 were exposed to 150 mg Q12W SC. A total of 81 patients were 
exposed to the standard dosing regimen of 300 mg Q4W IV. 52 patients received 300 mg Q12W IV, and 47 
received 150 mg Q12W IV.  
Study 101MS102 
This  was  a  randomized,  open-label,  dose-ranging  study  to  evaluate  the  PK  and  initial  safety  of  SC  and  IM 
natalizumab in subjects with MS. The study was conducted at twelve investigational sites in the US. 
The Applicant stated that study 101MS102 was primarily designed to evaluate the safety, PK, and PD properties 
of natalizumab and was not powered to detect any differences between the IV and SC routes of administration 
in  either  the  SPMS  or  RRMS  population  or  within  the  study  populations  over  time.  Therefore,  no  definitive 
conclusions could be drawn regarding efficacy; however, some general inferences were made.

Study 101MS206 
This study was a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, blinded, prospective, parallel-group study evaluating the 
safety, tolerability, and efficacy of multiple regimens of natalizumab over a 72-week period in patients with 
RRMS who had previously received IV natalizumab for at least 12 months. The primary endpoint for this study

Patients with SPMS and RRMS, aged 18 to 65 years who were natalizumab naïve were eligible to participate. 
In addition, the following criteria had to be met: 
• 
Patients for Groups A, B, C, and F must have had a diagnosis of SPMS, as defined by Lublin and Reingold 
[Lublin and Reingold 1996], but without superimposed relapses. This condition required the presence of 
continuous clinical disease worsening over a period of at least 3 months. Must have had a baseline EDSS 
score between 2.5 and 6.5, inclusive.

For Groups D and E Must have had a diagnosis of a relapsing form of MS and fall within the therapeutic 
indication stated in the locally approved label for Tysabri. Must have a baseline EDSS score between 0.0 
and 6.5, inclusive. 
Study 101MS206 
Patients with RRMS, aged 18 to 55 years, who were pre-treated with natalizumab for a minimum of 12 months 
were eligible to participate. In addition, the following criteria had to be met: 
• 
• 
Free of MS relapse, as determined by the enrolling Investigator, for 12 months prior to randomization.  
In the 12 months prior to the initiation of natalizumab, subject must have experienced a minimal level of 
disease activity as defined by: ≥2 documented clinical relapses OR 1 relapse and documented MRI activity, 
defined by the presence of at least 1 Gd+ lesion on MRI, unrelated to the relapse. 
Treatments 
Study 101MS102 
The study evaluated five treatment groups. Each group received 300 mg per dose, either IV or SC. The groups 
were treated in part I at baseline (day 0) and then every 4 weeks from weeks 8 to 28.

Table 5: Natalizumab Treatment Groups in Study 101MS102 
For  subjects  in  the  natalizumab  treatment  groups  (Groups  A,  B,  C,  D,  and  E),  the  study  period  between 
Screening and  Week 32 was divided into 2  parts: an 8 week, Single Dose, Intensive PK/PD Phase  (Part I), 
followed  by  a  Repeated-Dose  Treatment  Extension  phase  in  which  subjects  received  natalizumab  once  per 
month for 6 months (Part II). During Part II, subjects were to continue to receive the same natalizumab dose 
and route that was assigned to them in Part I of the study. Natalizumab was to be administered monthly (at 
weeks 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28) for 6 months. 
Study 101MS206 
The  study  explored  dosing  with  natalizumab  by  SC  and  IV  routes.  Subjects  were  screened  at  a  regularly 
scheduled natalizumab dose visit and enrolled at their next monthly visit if they met all inclusion criteria.  Within 
1 month after receiving their most recent infusion of natalizumab, eligible subjects were randomly assigned to 
1 of 6 dosing regimens and initiated the first dose of study treatment.

Objectives 
Both studies were not primarily designed and powered for a direct comparison of the 300 mg Q4W SC vs. the 
300 mg Q4W IV regimen. 
Study 101MS102 
The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  compare  the  PK  and  PD  of  single  SC  and  IM  doses  of  300  mg 
natalizumab to IV administration of 300 mg natalizumab in MS subjects. 
Secondary objectives included the following: 
• 
• 
• 
To investigate the safety, tolerability, and PK of repeated natalizumab doses administered SC and IM.  
To investigate the immunogenicity of repeated natalizumab doses administered SC and IM.  
To explore proof of concept within the SPMS population using change from baseline in:  Expanded Disability 
Status Scale (EDSS), Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite  (MSFC) Scale, Symbol Digit Modalities Test 
(SDMT), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) to measure quality of life, and Visual Function Test (VFT); and  brain 
MRI measures including: number of new or newly enlarging T2  hyperintense lesions, number of new T1 
hypointense lesions, number of new Gd+ lesions, whole-brain atrophy, magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), 
and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).   
• 
To  observe  the  effect  of  natalizumab  administered  IV  and  SC  on  brain  MRI  measures  in  subjects  with 
relapsing forms of MS.  
Study 101MS206 
The primary objective of this study was to explore the effects of multiple regimens of natalizumab on disease 
activity and safety in subjects with RRMS.

Additional objectives of this study were as follows:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
To characterize and compare PK/PD profiles across multiple dose regimens of natalizumab.  
To characterize effects on secondary brain MRI measures.  
To evaluate potential laboratory markers of immune function and trafficking across the treatment regimens. 
To assess the safety and tolerability across multiple dose regimens. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Study 101MS102 
The primary endpoints of this PK study did not include an efficacy measure.  
Efficacy  data  were  evaluated  as  exploratory  endpoints  only.  Analyses  were  conducted  to  assess  potential 
benefits of natalizumab therapy by various routes (IV,  IM, SC) of administration in patients with  SPMS and 
RMS. These efficacy measures included EDSS, MSFC, SDMT, VAS, VFT, and brain MRI measures (Table 6). 
Study 101MS206 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the cumulative number of CUA lesions. 
Additional/exploratory clinical efficacy endpoints included the following: 
•  Number and Volume of Gd+ Lesions 
•  Number of New or Newly Enlarging T2 Hyperintense  
• 
• 
• 
• 
Proportion of Subjects Relapsing and ARR Over 60-Week Treatment Period

Sample size 
Study 101MS102 
No formal sample size calculation was carried out for this study. A sample of 12 subjects per dosing group was 
considered sufficient to characterize the PK profile of the different natalizumab routes. 
Study 101MS206 
This study was exploratory in nature, and sample size was not based on statistical considerations. Based on 
MRI data from previous studies with natalizumab and simulations, and assuming a 10% dropout rate, a sample 
size of 50 subjects per group was anticipated to provide an approximately 80% power to detect a trend for 
difference between the standard regimen and an alternative regimen with 50% loss-of efficacy as compared 
with the standard regimen at a 1-sided 0.1 level of significance.  
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Study 101MS102 
A total of 52 SPMS subjects were randomized at an approximate ratio of 2:2:2:1 to receive a single IV, SC, or 
IM dose of 300 mg natalizumab (Groups A [16 subjects], B [14 subjects], and C [15 subjects], respectively), 
or to receive a reference treatment (Group F [7 subjects]). 
Once enrollment for Groups A, B, C, and F was completed, 24 subjects with relapsing MS were to be randomized 
at a ratio of 1:1 into Group D (300 mg SC [12 subjects]) or Group E (300 mg IV [12 subjects]). 
Study 101MS102 was an open-label study. 
Study 101MS206 
This was a randomized, blinded study. All study staff (with the exception of the unblinded site pharmacist for 
IV infusions), subjects, and the sponsor were blinded to natalizumab dose but not to route of administration.  
In order to minimize the risk of unblinding, the examining neurologist was required to be blinded to both, dose 
and route of administration. 
Statistical methods 
Study 101MS102 
Efficacy analyses were performed to explore different routes of administration (IV, IM, and SC) in participants 
with  SPMS  and  RRMS.  Efficacy  endpoints  were  summarised  over  time  using  descriptive  statistics.  All  the 
statistical analyses in this study were descriptive. There was no imputation used for missing data.

Study 101MS206 
The modified intention to treat (mITT) population, defined by the Applicant as all randomised participants who 
received at least 1 dose of study treatment and had at least 1 efficacy assessment used for all efficacy analyses. 
Subjects who had statistical protocol deviations as listed below were excluded from the mITT population. 
Efficacy endpoints were summarised by presenting summary statistics for continuous and count variables, or 
frequency distributions for categorical variables. All statistical analyses for efficacy in this study were descriptive 
in  nature;  therefore,  no  formal  comparisons  and  no  adjustments  for  multiple  comparisons/multiplicity  were 
made. No interim analysis was conducted for the study. 
Statistical  protocol  deviations  were  deviations  that  could  lead  to  biased  endpoint  measurements.  Subjects 
incurring any of the following statistical protocol deviations could be excluded from the efficacy and PD analyses. 
Statistical protocol deviations included the following:  
Positive results for anti-natalizumab antibodies at screening 
• 
•  Administration of an incorrect investigational product during the study 
•  Diagnosis of PML 
• 
Lack of compliance with treatment (defined as not receiving 2 or more consecutive doses) 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the cumulative number of CUA lesions. Missing data were imputed using the 
mean number of new active lesions by treatment arm and visit except data from treatment arms that were 
closed prematurely. Data from arms that were closed prematurely were not included, since a large proportion 
of  the  data  would  have  had  to  be  imputed.  In  addition,  data  were  summarised  by  treatment  arm  without 
imputation.  
The number and change from  baseline in the  number and the volume of Gd+ lesions, new or  enlarging  T2 
hyperintense  lesions, and new, nonenhancing T1  hypointense  lesions were summarized by treatment group 
and timepoint. 
Only protocol-defined relapses (as identified by the Investigator) during the randomized treatment period were 
included.  In  this  regard,  clinical  relapses  were  defined  by  new  or  recurrent  neurological  symptoms  not 
associated with fever or infection, having a minimum duration of 24 hours and including the following: 
•  An increase of ≥ 1 grade in ≥ 2 functional scales of the EDSS, or  
•  An increase of ≥ 2 grades in ≥ 1 functional scale of the EDSS, or 
•  An increase ≥ 1 EDSS if the previous EDSS was ≤ 5.5, or an increase of ≥ 0.5 if the previous EDSS 
was ≥ 6 (an increase of ≥ 1.5 in the EDSS if previous EDSS was equal to 0). 
The AAR for each treatment group was calculated as the total number of relapses experienced in the group 
divided by the total number of days in the randomized period for the group, and the ratio was multiplied by 
365.25. In addition, the subject level ARR was calculated as the number of relapses for that subject divided by 
the number of days the subject participated in the randomized period, and the ratio was multiplied by 365.25.  
Sustained disability progression was defined as follows: at least a 1.5-point increase on the EDSS from baseline 
(Day 0) EDSS = 0 that was sustained for 12 weeks (± 5 days), at least a 1.0-point increase on the EDSS from 
a baseline EDSS score of ≥1.0 and ≤5.5 that was sustained for 12 weeks (± 5 days), and at least a 0.5-point 
increase on the EDSS from a baseline EDSS score of ≥6 that was sustained for 12 weeks (± 5 days). 
The proportion of subjects who had a relapse, who had disability progression, who met MRI rescue criteria, and 
who received rescue therapy were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.

Results 
Participant flow 
Study 101MS102 
A total of 76 natalizumab-naïve participants were randomized, hereof 52 patients with SPMS and 24 with RMS 
as displayed in Figure 2.  
Figure 2: Overview of subject disposition in Study 101MS102 
SPMS: Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis; RRMS: Relapsing Remitting; IV: intravenous; SC: Subcutaneous 
Study 101MS206 
A total of 290 RMS participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to the 6 treatment arms. A total of 289 
participants  received  at  least  1  dose  of  study  treatment,  and  the  efficacy  analyses  were  performed  in  277 
randomized participants. Of the 290 participants, 54 were randomized to the 300 mg IV Q4W, and 45 were 
randomized to the 300 mg SC Q4W. 
Of 290 subjects, 117 (40%) discontinued randomized treatment due to the premature closure of the 4 Q12W 
treatment arms:  300 mg IV Q12W: 20 of 52 subjects (38%); 300 mg SC Q12W: 36 of 54 subjects (67%); 
150 mg IV Q12W: 33 of 47 subjects (70%); 150 mg SC Q12W: 28 of 38 subjects (74%) (Figure 3). A majority 
of the 117 subjects who discontinued the randomized treatment due to arm closures did not withdraw from the 
study and entered the open-label natalizumab treatment period. Thirty-nine of 191 subjects (20.4%) in the 4 
closed treatment arms received rescue therapy with open-label natalizumab treatment: 13 subjects in the 300 
mg IV Q12W arm, 10 subjects in the 300 mg SC Q12W arm, 8 subjects in the 150 mg IV Q12W arm, and 8 
subjects in the 150 mg SC Q12W arm.    
Across  all  6  treatment  arms,  12  of  290  subjects  (4%)  withdrew  consent,  and  3  of  290  subjects  (1%) 
discontinued the study due to the Investigator’s decision (Figure 3). There was 1 death in the 300 mg SC Q12W 
arm  (Figure  3).  5  of  290  subjects  (2%)  were  administered  incorrect  study  treatment  and  discontinued  the

study (Figure 3); however, an additional 6 subjects were identified to have received at least 1 dose of incorrect 
study  treatment  during  data  reconciliation  phase  of  the  study.  Overall,  11  of  290  subjects  (3.8%)  were 
administered incorrect study treatment and were excluded from the efficacy analyses.    
Overall, 237 randomized subjects (82%) from across the 6 treatment arms entered the open-label follow-up 
period and were administered 300 mg IV Q4W.  The subjects who entered the open-label natalizumab treatment 
included those who discontinued randomized treatment period because of closure of the four Q12W treatment 
arms and chose to receive open-label natalizumab rather than withdraw from the study.    
Nineteen subjects (6%) discontinued the open-label natalizumab treatment: 7 subjects withdrew consent, 6 
subjects discontinued because of other reasons, 5 subjects were discontinued by the Investigator, and 1 subject 
discontinued due to an AE (Figure 3).

Conduct of the study 
Study 101MS102 
Protocol 101MS102 was amended 5 times (21 Aug 2007; 17 Sept 2007; 10 Jun 2008; 13 Nov 2009; 09 Apr 
2010). Here, we provide an overview of main changes including the amendments:  
•  Amendments in the clinical and MRI endpoints including the addition of SDMT and VAS to the protocol 
(No 1 and 3).  
•  Revision  of  the  patient  population  for  Groups  D  and  E  from  subjects  with  SPMS  to  subjects  with 
relapsing  forms  of  MS  because  relapsing  patients  are  an  anticipated  patient  population  for  use  of 
natalizumab administered by SC injection (No 4). 
•  Update the protocol to reflect that SC administration has been selected for use in the extension phase 
of the study based on the review of the preliminary data and that only 300 mg doses of natalizumab 
were to be compared (No 4).  
•  Revision of the requirements for anti-natalizumab antibody testing (No 4). 
The most common major protocol deviations were study drug administration (12 subjects), missed assessments 
(6 subjects), and ICF/PHI issues (5 subjects). 
Study 101MS206 
Protocol  101MS206  was  amended  3  times  (03  Mar  2011,  28  Feb  2012  and  16  Nov  2012)  to  add  a 
pharmacogenomic analysis to evaluate individual susceptibility or resistance to develop PML (No 1), align safety 
information  (No.2)  and  frequency  of  anti-JCV  antibody  testing  (No.3)  to  the  current  recommendations  for 
Tysabri.   
As per protocol deviation, twelve participants were excluded from the efficacy set due to an administration of 
an incorrect investigational product during the study (n=11) or PML diagnosis (n=1).

Treatment groups were balanced within subject populations with respect to age and height. Gender and race 
reflected the MS population, which is primarily female (35 [67%] subjects for SPMS subjects [Groups A, B, C, 
and  F]  and  16  [70%]  subjects  for  relapsing  MS  subjects  [Groups  D  and  E]);  and  predominantly  white  (49 
[94%] subjects for SPMS subjects and 21 [91%] subjects for relapsing MS subjects). 
With regard to relapse history, there were notable differences between the 2 subject populations. For the SPMS 
population (Groups A, B, C, and F) the mean number of relapses within the 3 years prior to study entry was 
0.7 with 29 (56%) subjects having no relapses and 15 (29%) having 1 relapse. The occurrence of relapses 
across the SPMS treatment groups within 3 years and 12 months prior to study entry was variable with Group 
B having the greatest number of subjects with no relapses (11  [79%]  subjects) and Group  F the fewest (3 
[43%] subjects) during the past 3 years. The mean time since the most recent relapse was 69.45 months with 
a median of 55.45 months (range 2.8 months to 348.0 months). The longest mean time since the most recent 
relapse was for Group B (93.40 months) and the shortest was Group A (56.71 months).    
For the relapsing MS population (Groups D and E) the mean number of relapses within the 3 years prior to 
study entry was 1.9 with 6 (26%) subjects having 1 relapse, 7 (30%) having 2 relapses and 5 (22%) having 
3 relapses.  The occurrence of relapses across the Groups D and E within 3 years and 12 months prior to study 
entry was similar. The mean time since the most recent relapse was 21.0 months, much shorter than that for 
the SPMS population.    
Study 101MS206 
Of 290 enrolled subjects, 204 (70%) were female, ranging 63% (24 of 38 subjects in the 150 mg SC Q12W 
arm) to 76% (41 of 54 subjects in the 300 mg SC Q12W arm).    
The overall median (min, max) age was 38.0 years (19 years, 56 years); 1 subject (<1%) was in the age range 
of 18 to 19 years; 48 subjects (17%) were in the age range of 20 to 29 years; 117 subjects (40%) were in the 
age range of 30 to 39 years; 95 subjects (33%) were in the age range of 40 to 49 years; and 29 subjects 
(10%) were in the age range of 50 to 56 years. The median (min, max) BW was 66.70 kg (45.0 kg, 142.0 kg).   
The predominant race represented in the study was White (233 subjects [80.0%]). Twenty percent of subjects 
(57) did not report their race. All geographic areas represented were in Europe.    
The  baseline  mean  EDSS  scores  ranged  from  2.54  to  2.99  across  the  6  natalizumab  treatment  arms.  The 
baseline individual EDSS scores ranged from 0.0 to 6.5: 0.0 (3% of subjects), 1.0 (9% of subjects), 1.5 (14% 
of subjects), 2.0 (17% of subjects), 2.5 (12% of subjects), 3.0 (7% of subjects), 3.5 (12% of subjects), 4.0 
(11% of subjects), 4.5 (3% of subjects), 5.0 (3% of subjects), 5.5 (4% of subjects), 6.0 (3% of subjects), and 
6.5 (<1% of subjects).    
Baseline  MRI  parameters,  Gd+  lesion  count  and  volume,  T2  lesion  volume,  and  non-Gd+  T1  lesion  volume 
(mean, median) were similar across the 6 treatment arms in the 288 out of 290 enrolled subjects. The screening 
MRI data indicated that none of the subjects in any of the 6 treatment arms had Gd+ lesions. The total mean 
(median) T2 lesion volume was 11.3 (7.7), while the total mean (median) Gd- T1 lesion volume was 4.4 (2.4).    
The mean number of relapses in the 12 to 24 months prior to natalizumab initiation was similar, ranging from 
0.9 to 1.5 across the 6 treatment arms.  Of 290 subjects, 49 (17%) had ≥3 relapses, 46 (16%) had 2 relapses, 
and 94 (32%) had 1 relapse 12 to 24 months prior to natalizumab initiation. The mean number of relapses 
since initiation of natalizumab was similar, ranging from 0.2 to 0.7 across the 6 treatment arms.  Nine of 290 
subjects (3%) had ≥3 relapses. Four of 290 subjects (1%) experienced their most recent relapse ≤1 year prior 
to enrollment: 2 subjects in the 300 mg IV Q4W arm, 1 subject in the 300 mg SC Q12W arm, and 1 subject in 
the 150 mg IV Q12W arm. The mean number of years since the most recent relapse after natalizumab initiation 
Assessment report

was similar across all the treatment arms, ranging from 1.02 years in the 300 mg SC Q4W arm to 1.88 years 
in the 150 mg IV Q12W arm. The total mean number of Gd+ lesions on MRI scan in the year prior to natalizumab 
initiation was 2.3 for the entire study population; the mean numbers across all the treatment arms was similar 
(the mean number for 300 mg IV Q4W arm was 1.5; other mean numbers ranged from 2.2 to 3.0). The median 
number of Gd+ lesions was similar, ranging from 1.0 to 1.5 across the 6 treatment arms.    
The mean EDSS score prior to natalizumab initiation was similar across all the treatment arms, ranging from 
2.72  to  3.16  (median  scores  ranged  from  2.5  to  3.0).  The  mean  baseline  value  was  similar  across  all  the 
treatment arms, ranging from 2.54 to 2.99 (median scores ranged from 2.5 to 3.0).    
Prior MS therapy in subjects randomized to the 6 treatment arms was generally representative of the overall 
population of patients with RRMS and was generally well balanced among the treatment groups.  Prior to study 
entry, mean duration of natalizumab use across all the treatment arms was 3.0 years, ranging from 2.7 to 3.2 
years. The median number of prior natalizumab infusions across the treatment groups ranged from 25.0 to

Study 101MS102 
For Parts I and II (from baseline through Week 32), the efficacy population was defined as all subjects who 
had  at least 1 post-baseline assessment of the efficacy parameters to  be  analysed. Additionally, if subjects 
received less than 5 doses of natalizumab or were persistently ADA positive then they were excluded from the 
efficacy population. 
A total of 76 natalizumab-naïve participants were randomized, hereof 52 patients with SPMS and 24 with RMS 
Based on above criteria, 9 subjects were excluded from the efficacy analyses (2 from group A; 1 from group 
B;  2  from  group  C;  3  from  group  D  and  1  from  group  E).  Then,  efficacy  evaluable  population  included  14 
participants in group A, 13 participants in group B, 9 participants in group D and 10 participants in group E.  
During the procedure, the Applicant clarified that the primary efficacy analysis set was the per protocol set 
Study 101MS206 
As presented in above section, mITT population as defined by the Applicant included all randomised participants 
without protocol deviations listed in statistical methods who received at least 1 dose of study treatment, had 
at least 1 efficacy assessment  
Out of the 290 randomised participants, 289 received at least 1 dose of study treatment. Twelve participants 
were excluded from the efficacy set due to an administration of an incorrect investigational product during the 
study (n=11) or PML diagnosis (n=1). Therefore, 277 participants were included in the efficacy population.  
Outcomes and estimation 
Study 101MS102 
Overall,  both  SPMS  and  RRMS  participants  were  mostly  stable  during  the  study  and  no  clear  differences  in 
During  Study  101MS102,  3  SPMS  participants  in  the  IV  treatment  arm  and  2  RRMS  participants  in  the  SC 
treatment arm had an MS relapse in Parts I and II. There were no MS relapses in SPMS participants in the SC

treatment  arm  or  in  RRMS  participants  in  the  IV  treatment  arm.  One  participant  had  an  MS  relapse  in  the 
Follow-Up Treatment Extension Phase with participants with MS.  
EDSS scores were observed between participants treated with the IV and SC formulations (Table 7). 
Except for an increase in T25FW in the SPMS IV group, no difference in MSFC scores was observed between 
participants receiving natalizumab by the SC or IV route of administration for the SPMS and RRMS populations 
over the time periods (Table 8).  
The performance of SMDT and VAS at baseline was better for RRMS than for SPMS groups. With the exception 
of  a  deterioration  for  VAS  performance  reported  for  group  A  over  the  study  period,  a  trend  towards  an 
improvement  was  observed  for  both  tests  for  RRMS  and  SPMS  IV  and  SC  groups.  For  VFTs,  no  substantial 
changes were observed over time for groups A, B, D and E.  
No new Gd+ lesions were identified over time irrespective of route of administration. The number of patients 
with new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions was low (2 in group A, 3 in groups B, D and E), and no 
clear differences were found between the IV or SC treatment arms in patients with RRMS and SPMP.

Primary MRI-endpoint 
Cumulative Number of CUA Lesions   
The primary efficacy endpoint was the cumulative number of new CUA lesions since baseline based on brain 
MRI scans at Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60. 
During the randomized treatment period, CUA lesions were detected by the Week 12 Visit (Table 9) in the four 
Q12W treatment arms. The increase in MRI activity in a large proportion of subjects in the four Q12W treatment 
arms led to premature closure of these arms by the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee.    
The total mean number of combined unique active lesions since baseline during the randomized period in the 
natalizumab 300 mg SC Q4W treatment arm (0.02) was comparable to that in the 300 mg IV Q4W arm (0.23) 
(Table 9).

Number and Volume of Gd+ Lesions 
The MRI data indicated that all subjects were free of Gd+ lesions at Screening.  
The change from baseline in the number and volume of Gd+ lesions during the 60-week randomized treatment 
period was comparable in the two Q4W treatment arms:  300 mg IV Q4W arm: mean number of Gd+ lesions 
0.00, mean volume of Gd+ lesions 0.0000; and 300 mg SC Q4W: mean number of Gd+ lesions: 0.03; mean 
volume of Gd+ lesions: 0.0018.

However, during the randomized treatment period, new Gd+ lesions was detected in some subjects by Week 
12 in the four Q12W treatment arms, with the mean number of Gd+ lesions  ranging from 0.07 to 0.59. The 
number of Gd+ lesions detected increased through study visits at Week 24 (mean number ranging from 0.66 
to 6.00) and Week 36 (mean number ranging from 0.91 to 5.56). The number of subjects analysed in the four 
Q12W treatment arms decreased over time because of the number of subjects requiring rescue therapy and 
eventually  because  of  closure  of  the 4  treatment  arms.  An  increase in the  volume of  Gd+  lesions  was also 
detected by Week 12 in the 4 closed treatment arms.    
Number and Volume of New or Newly Enlarging T2 Hyperintense  
The mean numbers of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions detected in the two Q4W treatment arms 
were comparable at each visit during the randomized treatment period; the mean number of lesions by Week 
60 in both arms was 0.03. The mean T2 hyperintense lesion volume across the 2 open treatment arms did not 
vary from baseline. 
New or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions were detected by Week 12 in all four Q12W treatment arms, 
with the mean number of lesions ranging from 0.07 to 0.61. The number of detected lesions increased through 
Week 24 and Week 36. The number of evaluable subjects in these 4 treatment arms decreased as they met 
rescue criteria, subsequently leading to closure of these arms.    
Proportion of Subjects Relapsing and ARR Over 60- Week Treatment Period   
During the randomized treatment period, approximately 14% of subjects in the mITT population had at least 
1 protocol-defined relapse, as identified by the Investigator.  
In total there were 40 relapses across all 6 treatment arms: 300 mg IV Q4W: 4 relapses (1 per subject); 300 
mg SC Q4W:  4 relapses (1 per subject); 300 mg IV Q12W: 8 relapses (1 per subject); 300 mg SC Q12W: 10 
relapses  (1  per  subject);  150  mg  IV  Q12W:  11  relapses  (9  subjects  with  1  relapse  each,  1  subject  with  2 
relapses); 150 mg SC Q12W: 3 relapses (1 per subject).    
The unadjusted ARR in the two Q4W arms was comparable: 300 mg IV Q4W arm: 0.07; 300 mg SC Q4W: 
0.08. The subject-level mean ARR in the two Q4W arms were as follows: 300 mg IV Q4W arm: 0.07 and 300 
mg SC Q4W arm: 0.24. Although each of the Q4W arms had 4 relapses (1 relapse per subject), 1 subject in 
the 300 mg SC Q4W arm had a relapse by Day 42 followed by rescue on Day 57 of the randomized treatment 
period, which led to a higher subject-level mean relapse rate than in the 300 mg IV Q4W treatment arm.   
Time to First Protocol-Defined Relapse by Week 60  
Based on the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the time to first protocol-defined relapse by treatment arm (Figure 4), 
the  proportions  of  subjects  with  protocol-defined  relapses  at  the  Week  60  Visit  in  the  two  Q4W  arms  was 
comparable: 300 mg IV Q4W arm: 7.8%; and 300 mg SC Q4W: 9.1%.    
The proportions of subjects with protocol-defined relapses at the Week 60 Visit in the four Q12W treatment 
arms were as follows: 300 mg IV Q12W: 21.2%; 300 mg SC Q12W: 23.2%; 150 mg IV Q12W: 58.8%; and 
150 mg SC Q12W: 21.4%.

Figure 4: Kaplan-Meier analysis of time to first protocol-defined relapse by treatment arm.  
Proportion of Subjects Requiring Rescue Treatment  
Overall, 90 of 277 subjects (32%) in the mITT population met the rescue criteria during the randomized period.  
Of 277 subjects, 39 (14%) had a protocol-defined relapse, 41 (15%) had an MRI meeting Gd+ rescue criteria, 
23  (8%)  had  an  MRI  meeting  T2  hyperintense  lesion  rescue  criteria,  and  9  (3%)  had  a  sustained  EDSS 
progression that met rescue criteria. Note: participants can meet more than one criterion.  
The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the  proportion of subjects requiring  rescue with natalizumab by the Week  60 
Visit in the 300 mg SC Q4W arm was 2.3% (Figure 5). No subjects were rescued in the 300 mg IV Q4W arm.    
The  Kaplan-Meier  estimates  of  the  proportion  of  subjects  requiring  rescue  treatment  with  open-label 
natalizumab by the Week 60 Visit in the four Q12W treatment arms were: 300 mg IV Q12W arm: 33.9 %; 300 
mg SC Q12W: 27.7%; 150 mg IV Q12W: 53.3%: and 150 mg SC Q12W: 45.2%.

Time to First MRI That Met Rescue Criteria by Week 60  
The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the proportion of subjects who met the MRI rescue criteria at the Week 60 Visit 
was 2.0% in the 300 mg IV Q4W arm; no subjects in the 300 mg SC Q4W arm had an MRI that met the rescue 
criterion during the randomized treatment period.    
Based on the Kaplan-Meier estimate, the proportions of subjects that met the MRI rescue criteria by the Week 
60  Visit  in  the  four  Q12W  treatment  arms  were  as  follows:  300  mg  IV  Q12W:  43.5%;  300  mg  SC  Q12W: 
48.6%; 150 mg IV Q12W: 52.8%; and 150 mg SC Q12W: 70.3%. The 150 mg SC Q12W arm was the first one 
to be closed because of a clinically meaningful number of subjects who met the MRI rescue criteria as compared 
with the standard natalizumab dosing arm (300 mg IV Q4W).    
Change in EDSS From Baseline Through Week 60  
The mean change in the EDSS score from baseline through Week 60 was stable and comparable in the two 
Q4W treatment arms: -0.16 for the 300 mg IV Q4W arm and -0.04 for the 300 mg SC Q4W arm.    
There  was  little  change  in  the  mean  EDSS  score  over  time  during  the  randomized  period  for  the  subjects 
remaining in the four Q12W treatment arms.

Sustained EDSS Progression at Week 60  
The small proportion of subjects who showed sustained EDSS progression by Week 60 was comparable in the 
two Q4W arms: 5.9% in the 300 mg IV Q4W arm and 4.8% in the 300 mg SC Q4W arm.    
In the four Q12W treatment arms, the number of evaluable subjects decreased over time. As a result, of the 
small number of subjects remaining in these arms through Week 60, no subject demonstrated sustained EDSS 
progression.   
Change in Subject Assessed Well-Being (VAS) From Baseline Through Week 60  
The mean VAS scores ranged from 69.1 to 77.8 across all 6 treatment arms during the randomized treatment 
period;  in  general,  mean  VAS  scores  were  lower  (lower  quality  of  life)  than  the  baseline  value  across  all 
treatment arms.    
The  mean  (median)  change  from  baseline  in  the  VAS  score  at  Week  60  was  comparable  in  the  two  Q4W 
treatment arms: 300 mg IV Q4W: -4.1 (-3.0); 300 mg SC Q4W: -4.5 (-3.0).    
Change in SDMT From Baseline Through Week 60  
During the randomized treatment period, the mean SDMT scores at baseline across all treatment arms ranged 
from 42.9 to 47.4.    
In the two Q4W treatment arms, the mean change in the SDMT score from baseline to the Week 60 Visit was 
comparable and indicated a higher score on the SDMT: +6.3 in the 300 mg IV Q4W arm and +6.8 in the 300 
mg SC Q4W arm.    
The SDMT scores for the four Q12W treatment arms varied because as the treatment arms closed prematurely 
and the number of evaluable subjects in these arms decreased through Week 60.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In  order  to  support  the  SC  route  of  administration  the  Applicant  presented  data  from  two  clinical  studies: 
101MS102 and 101MS2016.  
The  population  analysed  in  the  two  studies  included  RRMS  and  SPMS  patients.  Regarding  RRMS  patients, 
patients included in Study 101MS102 had a diagnosis of a relapsing form of MS and fall within the therapeutic 
indication stated in the locally approved label  for Tysabri with a baseline EDSS score  between  0.0 and 6.5, 
Assessment report

Page 50/78 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
inclusive.  Regarding  RRMS  patients,  patients  included  in  Study  101MS2016  had  received  previously  IV 
natalizumab  for  at  least  12  months  and  were  free  from  relapse  for  12  months  prior  to  randomization.  This 
information was specified in section 5.1 of SmPC. Overall, based on the patient selection criteria, the analysed 
populations were considered sufficiently sensitive and representative for the target population.  
The choice of endpoints (e.g. EDSS, ARR, MRI lesions) was in  line with Guideline on clinical investigation of 
medicinal products for the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis (EMA/CHMP/771815/2011, Rev. 2). 
Study 101MS102 was an open-label study, which was primarily designed to evaluate the safety, PK, and PD 
properties  of  natalizumab.  It  was  not  powered  to  detect  any  differences  between  the  IV  and  SC  routes  of 
administration in either the SPMS or RRMS population or within the study populations over time. Moreover, 
efficacy endpoints in study 101MS102 were only exploratory. This limitation has been reflected in section 5.1 
of the SmPC.  
Study 101MS206 was a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, blinded, prospective, parallel-group study evaluating 
the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of multiple regimens of natalizumab over a 72-week period in patients with 
RRMS who had previously received IV natalizumab for at least 12 months and who were free of MS relapse for 
12 months prior to randomization.  The rational for Study 101MS206 was to explore whether the efficacy of 
natalizumab treatment could be maintained with longer treatment intervals. The dosing intervals were chosen 
based on the observation that efficacy was maintained for 12 weeks despite treatment interruption in patients 
who previously were stable on natalizumab 300 mg IV Q4W. In order to provide information on the potential 
utility of dosing regimens associated with lower overall natalizumab exposure levels, this study explored the 
safety, tolerability, and clinical effects of 2  lower-dose  regimens administered  Q12W that were predicted to 
provide a range of α4 integrin binding metrics throughout the dosing interval. The study explored both SC and 
IV  routes  of  administration,  but  it  was  also  not  primarily  designed  to  compare  the  efficacy  of  IV  vs  SC 
administration. The primary endpoint for this study was the cumulative number of CUA MRI lesions (detectable 
new Gad+ lesions and new or newly enlarging T2  hyperintense lesions). Although both studies included SC 
formulation arms, they were originally not designed to demonstrate equivalence in clinical efficacy of the 300 
mg SC Q4W regimen compared to the approved 300 mg IV Q4W regimen and were hence not powered for 
such comparison. This resulted in relatively low number of patients exposed to the target 300 mg SC regimen 
that could compromise the overall evidence for the non-inferiority of the SC regimen. This limitation has been 
reflected in the section 5.1 of the SmPC  
Study 101MS102 was an open-label study. In the light of the original trial objectives this could be acceptable. 
However, given the role the study on the comparison of IV and SC administration in this MA extension, this 
could not be considered optimal. A blinded approach would have been highly preferable to minimize bias. Study 
101MS206 was blinded for treatment but not for route of administration. In the light of minimizing bias in the 
comparison of IV and SC, blinding patients and study site staff also to the route of administration might have 
been  preferable.  However,  double-injections  (IV+SC)  in  order  to  maintain  blinding  to  the  route  of 
administration would have increased patient burden. This must be weighed against the possible advantages of 
complete  blinding.  Since  the  examining  neurologist  was  required  to  be  blinded  to  both,  dose  and  route  of 
administration, the influence on efficacy assessments may be considered negligible for efficacy analyses.  
With  regard  to  statistics,  it  must  be  noted  that  all  analyses  were  defined  post-hoc.  This  was  considered 
problematic. Additionally, only mean values according to administration were provided. No differences in means 
were given and the uncertainty of estimates as e.g. given by CIs was also not provided. This was not endorsed. 
Moreover, the primary analyses were conducted in a mITT set excluding protocol deviations which might affect 
statistical analyses. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/102816/2021 
Page 51/78 
  
  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Efficacy results were highly comparable between the  Q4W IV and SC groups of both studies. Only few new 
active Gad+ lesions and new or enlarging T2-hyperintense lesions occurred in Q4W IV and SC patients. The 
absolute numbers of lesions was also highly similar. A highly similar efficacy was also found for all secondary 
efficacy measures, including time-to-first relapse, change in EDSS, and change in SDMT. 
However, as discussed before, these findings have to be handled with caution, given that the analyses were 
not powered for such direct comparison of the two alternative (IV vs. SC) 300 mg Q4W regimens and may 
therefore not be sufficiently sensitive to conclude on the efficacy of the alternative SC treatment regimen.  
Additional information was requested with regard to specific differences of the data of the mITT set provided, 
compared to a proper PP population, which would be considered most sensitive to observe differences of the 
routes of administration. The Applicant provided additional data on the two analyses sets. However, it was not 
completely clarified whether additional patients to the one who experienced PML might have deviated from the 
protocol  and  should  have  been  excluded  from  the  per  protocol  set.  Albeit  some  remaining  uncertainties 
regarding differences of the mITT and the PP population, this issue was not pursuit further, given the general 
trend of improved efficacy in the SC group. 
Additional  analyses  were  also  requested  with  regard  to  means  and  CIs  per  route  of  administration  and 
differences between routes of administration including confidence intervals. The question was only incompletely 
answered by the MAH as data for study 101MS102 were only provided as tabular listings of descriptive statistics, 
and since data on key secondary endpoints were not provided for study 101MS206. However, given the trend 
to superior efficacy in SC as compared to IV, the provided data provides sufficient reassurance of a non-inferior 
efficacy for SC. In this light, further discussions would be overall beneficial but were suspended. The issue was 
therefore  not  further  pursued,  and  it  was  concluded  that  the  overall  clinical  database,  especially  if  read  in 
conjunction with the PK/PD analyses,  argues for a non-inferior efficacy of the natalizumab 300 mg SC Q4W 
regimen compared to the 300 mg IV Q4W regimen. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The lack of prospectively planned phase III studies and respective efficacy analyses as well as the only small 
patient number treated with the target dose and regimen of 300 mg SC Q4SW could compromise the overall 
evidence for the non-inferiority of the SC regimen.  
Upon request, the Applicant provided additional data and analyses on the two analyses sets as well as additional 
data  including  means  and  CI  per  route  of  administration  and  differences  between  routes  of  administration 
including CI. The responses were critically assessed. Overall, albeit some shortcomings of the additional data 
presented, it is concluded that the overall clinical database argues for a non-inferior efficacy of the natalizumab 
300 mg SC Q4W regimen compared to the 300 mg IV Q4W regimen.

Natalizumab 300 mg Q12W for 60 weeks 
Natalizumab 150 mg Q12W for 60 weeks 
IV: intravenous; SC: Subcutaneous; Q4W: every four weeks; Q12W: every twelve weeks.  
Participants in the treatment groups receiving natalizumab 300 mg or 150 mg at a dosing interval of Q12W 
had clinically relevant increases in MS disease activity that met the predefined rescue criteria compared with 
the standard natalizumab dosing group (300 mg IV Q4W). Hence, per DSMC advice, the four Q12W treatment 
groups were prematurely discontinued during the randomised treatment period. 
Adverse events 
Common AEs by severity 
The incidence of AEs was similar in the SC and IV and most AEs were mild or moderate (Table 13, Table 14 
and Table 15).

Infections 
Infections that are known to have a causal association with natalizumab are PML and herpes infections. 
Study 101MS102 
Overall, infections were reported in 12 participants (46%) in the SC group and in 14 participants (52%) in 
the IV group during Parts I and II (Table 16). There were no reports of PML or herpes infections. 
There  was  no  specific  pattern  in  the  events  in  reference  to  a  particular  infection  in  the  body.  Urinary  tract 
infections (UTIs) were the most commonly  reported  events (11  participants [20.8%] overall; 6 participants 
[23%] and 5 participants [18.5%] in the SC and IV groups, respectively). The other infections reported in more

than  1  participant  overall  were  nasopharyngitis  (5  participants  [9%]),  influenza  (3  participants  [6%]),  and 
candidiasis, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), gastroenteritis, laryngitis, pharyngitis, and vulvovaginal 
mycotic infection (2 participants [4%] each). In Parts I and II, 2 participants in the reference treatment group 
had infections: 1 participant had influenza, and 1 participant had an URTI. None of the infections were serious 
(SAE) in any treatment group (Table 16). 
In the Follow-Up Treatment Extension Phase, 20 participants (53%) overall reported infections. The incidence 
of infections was slightly higher in the Follow-Up Treatment Extension Phase, although the reported AEs were 
similar  to  those  in  Parts  I  and  II.  Infections  occurring  in  more  than  2  participants  overall  were  URTI  (5 
participants  [13%]),  UTI  (5  participants  [13%]),  herpes  zoster  (3  participants  [8%]),  and  sinusitis  (3 
participants [8%]) (Table 16).

Study 101MS206 
A total of 131 participants (45%) had infections during the study. The most commonly reported infections (≥ 
5%  of  participants)  were  nasopharyngitis  (17%),  UTI  (9%),  and  influenza  (6%).  The  other  AEs  included 
pharyngitis, bronchitis, herpes zoster, and herpes virus infection.  
•  There were 5 participants who reported  5  SAEs of  infections including one natalizumab-associated PML 
case  in  a  patient  with  anti-JCV  antibody  positive  who  already  received  Natalizumab  for  more  than  24 
months.  
Immunogenicity and Incidence of Anti-Natalizumab Antibody Formation 
In  accordance  with  the  Agency’s  guidance,  Studies  101MS102  and  101MS206  evaluated  immunogenic 
responsiveness using semi-quantitative ELISA testing in natalizumab-naïve participants and participants who 
had received previous natalizumab treatment, respectively. 
Assessment report

In the clinical studies, in all indications, approximately 10% of those tested had a positive anti-natalizumab 
antibody (ADA) titre at least once: approximately 6% of participants had persistently positive titres and the 
remaining  4%  had  transient  ADA.  Persistent  ADA  are  associated  with  a  decrease  in  the  effectiveness  of 
natalizumab and an increased incidence of hypersensitivity reactions and infusion-related reactions.

Study 101MS206 
Immunogenic  responsiveness  was  assessed  in  this study  with  a  larger  randomised  and  blinded  sample  size 
(290 enrolled participants). This study was conducted over a 72-week period to collect data for the comparison 
of the effect of immunogenicity following IV and SC administration of natalizumab. The occurrence of serum 
ADA was analysed at Screening and immediately prior to natalizumab infusion at Weeks 12, 24, 36, and 48 
and at the Week 60 Visit. 
None of the 288 participants tested were positive for ADA at screening. No participants tested positive for ADAs 
in  the  300  mg  IV  Q4W  or  300  mg  SC  Q4W  groups  throughout  the  randomised  treatment  period.  Two 
participants (1 in the 300 mg IV Q12W group and 1 in the 150 mg IV Q12W group) tested positive results for 
ADA at Week 12 and Week 24, respectively, and were later confirmed to be persistently positive through Week 
60 and through Week 36 (and an unscheduled visit), respectively. Neither of these participants had documented 
hypersensitivity or efficacy-related AEs relating to ADA (Table 18).

1 One subject did not have a screening anti-natalizumab result (0/52) but tested negative at all subsequent timepoints (always negative 
53/53). 
Hypersensitivity Reactions 
Based  on  safety  data  from  clinical  studies  and  postmarketing  exposure  the  incidence  of  hypersensitivity 
reactions in patients treated with natalizumab monotherapy is approximately 4%, with reactions classified as 
serious and systemic (e.g., anaphylaxis) occurring at an incidence of < 1%. 
Study 101MS102 
Only 1 participant (4%) (IV group) had a hypersensitivity reaction (urticaria of moderate severity) in Parts I 
and II (Table 19). During the Follow-Up Treatment Extension Phase, another participant had an AE that was 
determined to be a drug hypersensitivity reaction, which was moderate in severity and considered not related 
to study treatment. This participant had received natalizumab IV during Parts I and II and received 1 further 
dose of natalizumab without incident. 
Study 101MS206 
Hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 3 participants including a case of mild urticaria (300mg SC Q4W), a case 
of  moderate  dermatitis  and  mild  hypersensitivity  (300mg  SC  Q4W)  and  another  participant  with  drug 
hypersensitivity (allergic drug to another medical product) (300mg IV Q4W)  (Table  19). Only the moderate 
dermatitis was considered related to study treatment. Upon analysis of the reported hypersensitivity reactions, 
the events occurred within the same day of receiving natalizumab and within the first 5 infusions. However, 
there  was  insufficient  information  regarding  the  time  to  onset  of  the  events  after  receiving  natalizumab  to 
enable further comment. 
Injection and Infusion Reactions Assessments 
Study 101MS102 
Infusion reactions were defined as AEs occurring within 2 hours after the start of a natalizumab IV infusion. 
Injection reactions were defined as AEs occurring within 1 hour after a natalizumab SC injection. 
Infusion reactions (IV) 
Assessment report

In Parts I and II, 7 participants (26%) in the IV group reported events occurring within 2 hours after the start 
of a natalizumab infusion. These events were ataxia, contusion, infusion site erythema (moderate), infusion 
site  pain  (moderate),  infusion  site  pruritus  (moderate),  headache,  loss  of  proprioception,  and  urticaria 
(moderate)  (Table  19).  No  AEs  occurred  in  more  than  1  participant.  None  of  these  events  were  severe  or 
serious or resulted in the discontinuation of study treatment, with the exception of the AE of urticaria, which 
was  assessed  as  moderate  in  severity  but  resulted  in  the  participant  being  withdrawn  from  the  study.  No 
infusion reactions were reported during the Follow-Up Treatment Extension Phase. 
Injection reactions (SC) 
In Parts I and II, for the SC group, the AEs that occurred within 1 hour of the SC injection in 4 participants 
(15%)  were  injection  site pain,  decreased  blood  potassium,  headache,  and  menorrhagia  (Table  19).  In the 
Follow-Up Treatment Extension Phase, injection site reactions occurred in 6 participants (16%) and included 
dystonia, folliculitis, gait disturbance, hypertonic bladder, irritability, muscle spasticity, tachycardia, and UTI. 
None of the AEs that occurred in the Follow-Up Treatment Extension Phase were recurrences of the AEs reported 
in Parts I and II. None of these events were serious or resulted in the discontinuation of study treatment.  
Study 101MS206 
Treatment  administration  reactions  were  defined  as  AEs  that  occurred  within  2  hours  after  natalizumab 
administration (either IV or SC) or on the same day as an AE for which the start time was missing.  
Infusion reaction (IV) 
In 3 IV treatment groups, 8 participants (15%) in the 300 mg Q4W group, 8 participants (15%) in the 300 mg 
Q12W group, and 8 participants (17%) in the 150 mg Q12W group had infusion reactions. The majority were 
mild in severity and considered not related to study treatment (Table 19). Only 1 severe infusion reaction was 
reported but was considered not related to study treatment. 
Injection reaction (SC) 
In 3 SC treatment groups, 11 participants (24%) in the 300 mg Q4W group, 11 participants  (21%) in the 300 
mg Q12W group, and 8 participants (21%) in the 150 mg Q12W group had injection reactions (Table 19). The 
majority were mild in severity and considered related to study treatment.

NOTE 1: Numbers in parentheses are percentages. 2: A subject was counted only once within each system organ class/preferred term. 3: The 
safety population is defined as all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in the randomized treatment period and have at least 1 
post-baseline assessment of any safety parameter. 4: For Study 101MS102, data are from Part I and II only. For Study 101MS206 data are 
from the randomized treatment period only.          
MS relapse 
In studies 101MS102 and 101MS206, MS relapses reported as AEs were either protocol-defined or nonprotocol-
defined (see definition on protocol-defined on Clinical efficacy statistical methods section).  
Study 101MS102 
In this study, five participants out of the 54 participants in the safety set had a relapse (all protocol-defined) 
(one relapse per participant) including 2 relapses in the SC group (time to first relapse 0-8 weeks and 8-16 
weeks) and 3 relapses om the IV group (time to first relapse: 0-8 weeks, 8-16 weeks and 16-24 weeks).  In 
the Follow-Up Treatment Extension Phase, one participant out of the 38 who entered the extension phase had 
a relapse.  
Study 101MS206 
During the randomised treatment period, a total of 63 participants (22%) across all treatment groups had at 
least 1 AE of MS relapse (protocol-defined and nonprotocol-defined):  
•  8 participants (15%) in the 300 mg IV Q4W group [4 with protocol-defined relapses] 
•  7 participants (16%) in the 300 mg SC Q4W group [4 with protocol-defined relapses] 
•  13 participants (25%) in the 300 mg IV Q12W group [8 with protocol-defined relapses] 
•  17 participants (32%) in the 300 mg SC Q12W group [10 with protocol-defined relapses] 
•  13 participants (28%) in the 150 mg IV Q12W group [10 with protocol-defined relapses] 
•  5 participants (13%) in the 150 mg SC Q12W group [3 with protocol-defined relapses] 
Based on severity/intensity: 
•  26 participants (9%) had a mild MS relapse 
•  35 participants (12%) had a moderate MS relapse 
•  2 participants (< 1%) had a severe MS relapse 
A total of 22 participants prematurely discontinued randomised treatment because they had a MS relapse; 18 
of these participants were rescued with open-label natalizumab. Seven of the 22 events of MS relapse remained 
unresolved.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
There  were  2  deaths  reported  in  Studies  101MS102  and  101MS206  (one  per  study),  both  assessed  as  not 
related to study treatment by the Investigators. 
Other serious adverse events 
Study 101MS102 
No SAEs were reported for any participant  in  the SC group during Parts I and  II.  SAEs were reported for  2 
participants (7%) in the IV group; neither SAE was considered treatment-related.  
In  the  Follow-Up  Treatment  Extension  Phase,  SAEs  were  reported  for  6  participants  (16%)  overall:  3 
participants (11%) who were in the IV group and 3 participants (12%) who were in the SC group in Parts I and 
II. None of the SAEs were considered treatment-related. 
Study 101MS206 
During the randomised treatment period, 23 of 289 participants (8%) had an SAE. The 23 participants reported 
27 SAEs. Most SAEs (19 of 27 SAEs [70%]) were considered not related to natalizumab. A total of 6 serious 
MS relapse events were reported. These SAEs were reported more frequently in the 300 mg IV Q4W group 
compared  with  the  300  mg  SC  Q4W  group,  although  the  majority  of  SAEs  (79%)  in  the  IV  group  were 
considered not related to natalizumab. 
Laboratory findings 
Study 101MS102 
Haematology Results 
Overall, all treatment groups had shifts to either high or low values for a number of haematology parameters. 
However, there were few clinically significant changes. The majority of participants who had shifts to high or 
low values had normal values at baseline. 
Shifts  to  high  values  were  recorded  for  white  blood  cells  (WBC)  and  lymphocyte  counts.  However,  only    1 
participant in the SC group had a change of sufficient clinical significance to be regarded as an AE: increased 
lymphocyte count that was assessed as mild in severity. 
Blood Chemistry Results 
Overall, all treatment groups had shifts to either high or low values for a number of blood chemistry parameters. 
Although there were few clinically significant changes, 2 participants in the IV group and 1 participant in the 
SC group had changes of sufficient clinical significance to be regarded as AEs. The 2 participants in the IV group 
had AEs of decreased blood sodium (1 mild and 1 moderate in severity). One participant in the SC group had 
an AE of decreased blood potassium (mild in severity). 
Urinalysis Results 
Few abnormalities were noted, but none of them were considered clinically significant by the Investigator.

Haematology Results 
Since the participants in this study were on a 300 mg Q4W dosing regimen of natalizumab for the 12 months 
prior to enrolling in the study, the mean and median values for each haematology parameter at baseline were 
similar across the treatment groups. 
During the randomised treatment period, the shift in WBC counts to high values was similar in the two Q4W 
treatment groups: 5 of 44 participants (11%) in the 300 mg IV Q4W group and 3 of 38 participants (8%) in 
the 300 mg SC Q4W group. The lymphocyte count and percent shift from baseline to high values were also 
similar in the 300 mg IV Q4W and 300 mg SC Q4W groups. For the red blood counts, 9% of participants in the 
300 mg IV Q4W group and 6% of participants in the 300 mg SC Q4W group had a shift from baseline to low 
values. For haemoglobin count, 8% of participants in the 300 mg IV Q4W group and 3% of participants in  the 
300 mg SC Q4W group had a shift from baseline to low values. 
A  few  clinically  significant  haematology  changes  were  reported  as  AEs  (SOC:  Blood  and  lymphatic  system 
disorders): 
•  Anaemia (4% of participants in the 150 mg IV Q12W group) 
• 
• 
• 
Iron deficiency anaemia (2% of participants in the 300 mg IV Q4W group) 
Leucocytosis (3% of participants in the 150 mg SC Q12W group) 
Thrombocytopenia (2% of participants in the 300 mg IV Q12W group) 
One participant in the 150 mg IV Q12W group had a moderate AE of abnormal laboratory test. 
Blood Chemistry Results 
The mean and median values for each parameter at the Baseline and Week 60 Visits were similar and within 
the normal range across the treatment groups. Shifts to low or high blood chemistry values were observed for 
most  of  the  parameters;  however,  no  abnormal  pattern  was  observed  for  any  of  the  blood  chemistry 
parameters.  
During the randomised treatment period, the shift from baseline for the liver enzymes (aspartate transaminase 
and alanine transaminase) was towards high values; however, these shifts were not considered AEs. The shifts 
to high blood glucose values were observed across all treatment arms, and the number of participants with 
shifts to high glucose values was similar in the 2 Q4W groups: 7 of 47 participants (15%) in the 300 mg IV 
Q4W group and 6 of 37 participants (16%) in the 300 mg SC Q4W group. Prolonged exposure to corticosteroids 
(used for the treatment of MS symptoms) is known to increase blood glucose levels [Liu 2013]. A shift to low 
blood glucose values was also reported across all treatment groups.  
Urinalysis Results 
Urinalysis was not done in this study.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Study 101MS102 
In Parts I and II, no participants were discontinued from the SC groups due to AEs. In the IV group, 1 participant 
discontinued and later withdrew from the study due to an AE of urticaria that was considered related to study 
treatment. One participant in the SC group became pregnant and was no longer permitted to participate in the 
study. 
In  the  SC  group, one  participant  was  withdrawn  from  the  study  after  6  doses  of  study treatment  for  being 
persistently positive for ADA. Similarly, another participant in the IV group was withdrawn from the study after 
4 doses of study treatment for being positive for ADA; however, this participant did not meet the criteria for 
being persistently positive for ADA. 
In the Follow-Up Treatment Extension Phase, 1 participant in the IV group was withdrawn from the study due 
to healthy issues unrelated with the study and finally died.  
Study 101MS206 
The  most  common  reasons  for  discontinuation  in  the  300  mg  IV  Q4W  treatment  group  were  withdrawal  of 
consent  (6  participants),  AEs  (3  participants),  and  other  reasons  (2  participants).  Among  the  10  of  45 
participants  (22%)  who  prematurely  discontinued  randomised  treatment  in  the  300  mg  SC  Q4W  treatment 
group,  the  most  common  reasons  for  discontinuation  were  AEs  (3  participants),  withdrawal  of  consent  (2 
participants), Investigator decision (2 participants), rescue with open-label natalizumab infusion (1 participant), 
and other reasons (2 participants). The proportion of participants who discontinued the randomised treatment 
period  in  the  300  mg  SC  Q4W  treatment  group  (22%)  was  similar  to  the  proportion  of  participants  who 
discontinued the randomised treatment period in the 300 mg IV Q4W treatment group (20%). 
During the randomised treatment period, 32 participants discontinued study treatment due to AEs. Of these, 
22  participants  discontinued  from  the  randomised  treatment  period  prematurely  because  they  had  an  MS 
relapse,  and  18  of  these  were  rescued  with  open-label  natalizumab.  Seven  of  the  22  events  of  MS  relapse 
remained unresolved. 
Ten participants had events other than MS relapse that led to the discontinuation of randomised treatment. 
The  reasons  included  PML,  gait  disturbance,  MRI  inflammatory  activity,  neoplasia,  intestinal  perforation, 
epileptic seizures/epilepsy and coma. With the exception of case of PML (300mg IV Q4W) and the case of coma 
(300 mg SC Q4W) all other events were considered not related to study treatment. Except for the case of coma 
and epilepsy (150 mg IV Q12W), all events were resolved.  
Post marketing experience 
Based  on the  marketing  data,  the estimated  worldwide  patient exposure  to  natalizumab  IV  is  88,168  PY  of 
treatment in the current reporting interval (8 August 2018 to 7 August 2019) and 752,162 PY cumulatively 
since launch. An evaluation of the postmarketing experience for natalizumab IV is provided in the PSUR (PSUR 
34, data cut-off 7 August 2019).

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The most obvious shortcoming of the two studies is the only small number of patients who were treated with 
the target dose and regimen of 300 mg natalizumab SC Q4W. This leads to limitations in the validity of data.  
However, both administration regimens were tolerated and no relevant differences in the type and incidence 
of AEs and SAEs between the SC and IV route of administration were found. The most commonly reported 
disorders were infections and infestations (nasopharyngitis, UTI, and influence), nervous system disorders (MS 
relapse,  headache,  and  paraesthesia),  gastrointestinal  disorders  (diarrhoea,  nausea,  and  vomiting), 
musculoskeletal disorders (back pain, pain in extremity, and arthralgia), general disorders and administration 
site  conditions  (fatigue,  injections  site  pain,  pyrexia),  and  psychiatric  disorders  (depression,  insomnia,  and 
anxiety). Overall, AEs reported were consistent with AEs commonly reported in natalizumab trials and in the 
post-marketing setting.  
There were no specific patterns in the occurrence of SAEs that would suggest a difference between the SC and 
IV routes of natalizumab administration. 
There  was  no  clinically  meaningful  increase  in  potentially  immune-mediated  AEs,  such  as  hypersensitivity 
reactions and, for the SC route of administration compared with the IV route. There were few hypersensitivity 
reactions. Most events were of mild to moderate severity and were localized (e.g., urticaria, dermatitis). The 
incidence was not increased with SC administration and was in the range what was seen in natalizumab phase 
III studies exploring the 300 mg IV Q4W regimen. Nevertheless, this was based on few number of patients so 
the following statement has been added to section 4.8 of the SmPC “Hypersensitivity reactions usually occurred 
within  one  hour  after  completion  of  the  subcutaneous  injections.  The  number  of  patients  analysed  in  the 
DELIVER and REFINE studies was low (see sections 5.2 and 5.1, respectively)”. 
The number of ADA was slightly higher in patients in the SC groups. Upon request, the frequencies and absolute 
numbers of patients with ADA for the SC route of administration were included in section 4.8 of the SmPC for 
subjects persistently positive and for subjects in whom antibodies were detected only on one occasion.  Also, 
with regard to infusion/injection reactions, the number of events was slighter higher in the SC group in study 
101MS206.  During  the  procedure,  section  4.2  of  the  SmPC  was  updated  to  reflect  that  “patients  are  to  be 
observed during the subcutaneous injections and for at least 1 hour after for signs and symptoms of injection 
reactions including hypersensitivity. For the first 6 doses, patients should be observed during the injection and 
for 1 hour after for signs and symptoms of injection reactions including hypersensitivity.  After that, regardless 
of the route of administration, the 1-hour post-injection observation time may be reduced or removed according 
to  clinical  judgement  if  the  patients  have  not  experienced  any  injection  reactions”.  However,  the  types  of 
reactions  classified  as  injection  reactions  were  quite  variable  and  not  in  all  cases  the  reported  AEs  could 
plausibly  be  related  to  the  administration  of  natalizumab.  Moreover,  in  study  101MS102  the  incidence  of 
injection  reactions  after  SC  administration  was  lower  than  the  incidence  of  infusion  reactions  following  IV 
administration. Hence, across trials, the incidence of infusion/injection reactions following the IV vs. the SC 
route was highly similar. However, due to the only small numbers analysed, the immunogenicity potential of 
subcutaneously  administered  Tysabri  (anti-natalizumab  antibody  formation  resulting  in  a  potential  adverse 
clinical  consequence  of  serious  hypersensitivity  reactions,  including  anaphylaxis)  is  currently  incompletely 
characterized and hence added as missing information in the RMP. In this regard, the Applicant committed to 
evaluate this aspect through a new post-authorisation safety study (PASS) category 3 (see section 2.7).  
There was one case of PML in the 300 mg IV Q4W treatment group in study 101MS206, and no case of PML in 
the SC groups. However, patient numbers were too small to draw any conclusion about the PML risk with SC 
administration of natalizumab. EID that have been identified as effective in mitigating the PML risk associated

with IV administration of natalizumab have not been evaluated for the SC route. In this respect, the Applicant 
was requested to provide additional modelling and simulations. These analyses demonstrated that EID Ctrough_ss 
and α4-integrin saturation are unlikely to differ significantly between the IV and SC routes of administration. 
Based  on  these  analyses,  the  Applicant  concluded  that  the  effects  of  EID,  irrespective  of  the  route  of 
administration, would be similar for established PML risk factors. However, as long as the absolute risk of PML 
with the SC route has not been established, it is not possible to draw clear conclusions whether this risk would 
be lowered through an extension of the SC dosing interval. The question could therefore not finally be answered, 
and additional data need to be collected. This should be done through patient registries. No recommendation 
regarding EID could yet be made for patients treated via the SC route. Upon request, the Applicant agreed to 
include clear information to the SmPC and to the educational materials in order to state that the information 
on EID and the decrease in PML risk is currently based on IV data only and may not be extrapolated to the SC 
route.    The  inclusion  of  a  clear  statement  in  both,  SmPC  and  educational  materials,  was  found  deemed 
necessary since the potential of EID for lowering the risk of PML has not been established yet, while on the 
other  hand,  the  efficacy  of  EID  has  also  not  been  established.  Without  specific  language  on  this  lack  of 
information  for  the  SC  treatment  regimen,  treating  physicians  may  tend  to  treat  patients  with  an  SC  EID 
regimen, although the benefit of such an extension is questionable while on the other hand there still is some 
risk for a reduced efficacy with EID. Consequently, the following warning is added to section 4.4 in the SmPC 
“The  decrease  in  PML  risk  is  based  on  data  from  intravenous  route  of  administration.  No  clinical  data  are 
available  on  either  the  safety  or  efficacy  of  this  extended  interval  dosing  with  subcutaneous  route  of 
administration” while the following statement can be found in section 5.1 of the SmPC: “No clinical data are 
available  on  either  the  safety  or  efficacy  of  this  extended  interval  dosing  with  the  subcutaneous  route  of 
administration”. 
During the procedure, the Applicant agrees to amend the NOVA study protocol in order to further study safety 
and efficacy of an EID SC treatment regimen. The SC and IV periods of the crossover will each be of 24-week 
duration, and trough PK/PD will be collected prior to each dose in the cross-over period in order to allow for 
direct  observations  of  steady  state  PK/PD  following  IV  an  d  SC  doses  administered  Q6W  with  comparisons 
between routes of administration utilising within patient controls. This approach was endorsed. 
During  the  procedure,  the  Applicant  proposed  to  amend  the  section  4.2  of  the  Tysabri  (subcutaneous  use) 
SmPC as follows “Therapy is to be initiated and continuously supervised by specialised physicians experienced 
in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological conditions, in centres with timely access to MRI. Administration 
is to be performed by a healthcare professional and patients monitored for early signs and symptoms of PML”. 
Interpreted as that this proposal allows flexibility to administer Tysabri not only in specialized centers but also 
in other medical settings, this proposal was agreed by the CHMP. Indeed, the key aspect is that patients treated 
with Tysabri are very closely monitored and examined for signs and symptoms of PML by a neurologist who is 
experienced in this field (e.g in a specialized center or in another medical setting as for example in an infusion 
center), at least prior to each infusion/injection, in order to detect such signs as early as possible and be able 
to introduce effective therapy.  
The section 4.2 of the Tysabri subcutaneous SmPC was amended to include the statement that “home treatment 
is not recommended” At-home treatment would considerably reduce the number of contacts between a patient 
and his/her treating neurologist. Close monitoring through a neurologist experienced in the treatment of MS is 
considered key in reducing the risk of PML. This can be accepted.  
There were no apparent clinically meaningful differences observed in laboratory parameters and in vital signs 
between the SC and IV routes of administration.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
In studies 101MS102 and 101MS206, both administration regimens have been well tolerated and no relevant 
differences in the type and incidence of AEs and SAEs have been found.  
Although immune-mediated AEs may be a potential concern with SC administration, there was no meaningful 
increase in hypersensitivity events and the occurrence of persistent ADA, for the SC route of administration 
compared with the IV route. However, due to the only small numbers analysed, the immunogenicity potential 
of subcutaneously administered Tysabri is currently incompletely characterized and hence added as missing 
information in the RMP. 
As discussed above, information on EID and the decrease in PML risk is currently based on IV data only and 
may not be extrapolated to the SC route and therefore, no recommendation regarding EID can be made for 
patients treated via the SC route. This information was clearly stated in the SmPC (sections 4.4 and 5.1) and 
in the educational material.  
Despite the lack  on data on EID  and  immunogenicity potential of subcutaneously  administered Tysabri, the 
overall  safety  data  derived  from  101MS102  and  101MS206  argued  for  an  acceptable  safety  and  tolerability 
profile of the new formulation.  
Note: With regard to the additional monitoring list, the EMA proposed the removal of Tysabri from the additional 
monitoring  list.  The  current  ongoing  PASS,  as  well  as  the  new  PASS  proposed  in  this  extension  of  MA,  are 
category  3  studies  and  the  criteria  concerning  the  mandatory  inclusion  in  the  list  is  for  imposed  PASS.  No 
criterion for additional monitoring (mandatory scope) applies to Tysabri.  Therefore, the PRAC  agreed to the 
proposal  to  remove  Tysabri  from  the  additional  monitoring  list.  The  MAH  has  implemented  the  requested 
change, see PI.

2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the Applicant 
show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of 
the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(3) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Tysabri (natalizumab) is removed from the additional 
monitoring list as a it does not fulfil any of the criterion for additional monitoring (mandatory scope).   
Therefore, the statement that this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow 
quick identification of new safety information, preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle, is removed 
from the SmPC and the package leaflet. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
MS is a chronic autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorder of the CNS that is characterised by inflammation, 
demyelination, and oligodendrocyte and neuronal loss. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Natalizumab IV received Marketing Authorisation in the EU on 27 June 2006 as a DMT for treatment of RRMS. 
From its original approval in the US in 2004 through 31 July 2019, 198,646 individuals have been treated with 
natalizumab worldwide, with a cumulative exposure of 752,162 person-years.  
The  Applicant  states  that  an  alternative  SC  route  of  administration  for  natalizumab  will  provide  additional 
benefit to patients and physicians. The SC route represents a more convenient means of administration because 
it reduces the amount of time required at each treatment visit. There is evidence from other medical conditions 
and indications that patients prefer SC to IV administration based on convenience [Falanga 2019; Pivot 2013; 
Santus 2019] and quality of life measures [Syrios 2018]. The SC route is also identified as a cost-saving method 
of administration when compared with the IV route for patients, hospitals, and clinics, as reduced time and 
resources are required [Farolfi 2017; Lopez-Vivanco 2017; Olsen 2018].

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
In order to support the 300 mg Q4W SC regimen as an alternative to the currently approved 300 mg Q4W IV 
route of administration, the Applicant presented efficacy data from 2 clinical studies:  
•  Study 101MS102 (DELIVER) was a phase 1, randomized, open-label, dose-ranging study to evaluate the 
PK,  PD  and  safety  of  single  SC  and  IM  doses  of  300  mg  natalizumab  to  IV  administration  of  300  mg 
natalizumab in subjects with RRMS and SPMS. Efficacy was only a secondary aim for this study. Patients 
with RRMS had a baseline EDSS score between 0.0 and 6.5, inclusive and had to fall within the therapeutic 
indication stated in the locally approved label for Tysabri.  
•  Study 101MS206 (REFINE) was a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, blinded, prospective, parallel-group 
study evaluating the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of multiple regimens of natalizumab over a 72-week 
period in patients with RRMS who had previously received IV natalizumab for at least 12 months and were 
free of MS relapse for 12 months prior to randomization.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Since its initial approval in 2006, Tysabri IV has become a well-established treatment option for patients with 
highly active MS. 
Efficacy as monotherapy has been evaluated in one randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study lasting 
2 years (AFFIRM study) in RRMS patients who had experienced at least 1 clinical relapse during the year prior 
to entry and had an EDSS score between 0 and 5. Median age was 37 years, with a median disease duration 
of  5  years.  The  patients  were  randomised  with  a  2:1  ratio  to  receive  Tysabri  300  mg  (n=627)  or  placebo 
(n=315) Q4W for up to 30 infusions. Neurological evaluations were performed every 12 weeks and at times of 
suspected relapse. MRI evaluations for T1-weighted Gad+ lesions and T2-hyperintense lesions were performed 
annually.  
In the sub-group of patients indicated for treatment of rapidly evolving RRMS (patients with 2 or more relapses 
and 1 or more Gad+ lesion), the ARR was 0.282 in the Tysabri treated group (n=148) and 1.455 in the placebo 
group  (n=61)  (p  <0.001).  Hazard  ratio  for  disability  progression  was  0.36  (95%  CI:  0.17,  0.76)  p=0.008. 
These results were obtained from a post hoc analysis and should be interpreted cautiously. No information on 
the severity of the relapses before inclusion of patients in the study is available.  
Interim analysis of results (as of May 2015) from the ongoing TOP, a phase 4, multicentre, single-arm study 
(n=5,770)  demonstrated  that  patients  switching  from  beta  interferon  (n=3,255)  or  glatiramer  acetate 
(n=1,384) to Tysabri showed a sustained, significant decrease in ARR (p<0.0001). Mean EDSS scores remained 
stable over 5 years. Consistent with efficacy results observed for patients switching from  beta interferon or 
glatiramer acetate to Tysabri, for patients switching from fingolimod (n=147) to Tysabri, a significant decrease 
in  ARR  was  observed,  which  remained  stable  over  2  years,  and  mean  EDSS  scores  remained  similar  from 
baseline  to  Year  2.  The  limited  sample  size  and  shorter  duration  of  Tysabri  exposure  for  this  subgroup  of 
patients should be considered when interpreting these data. 
The efficacy and safety of Tysabri for SC administration was assessed in a randomised, blinded, parallel-group, 
phase 2 study (Study 101MS206 (REFINE)) exploring the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of multiple regimens 
of natalizumab (300 mg IV Q4W, 300 mg SC Q4W, 300 mg IV Q12W, 300 mg SC Q12W, 150 mg IV Q12W and 
150 mg SC Q12W) in adult subjects (n=290) with RMS conducted over a 60 week period. The primary endpoint 
of this study was the cumulative number of CUA MRI lesions (sum of new Gad+ lesions on brain MRI and new 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/102816/2021 
Page 72/78 
  
  
or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions not associated with Gad+ on T1 weighted scans). The mean CUA 
for the 300 mg SC Q4W k arm was low (0.02) and comparable to the 300 mg IV Q4W arm (0.23). The CUA in 
the  Q12W  treatment  arms  was  significantly  higher  than  the  Q4W  treatment  arms  resulting  in  the  early 
discontinuation of the Q12W arms. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The application is based on data from the two clinical studies 101MS102 and 101MS2016. These studies were 
not prospectively planned as comparability studies for the 300 mg SC vs the 300 mg IV treatment regimen and 
were hence not powered for that direct comparison. This results in a relatively small RRMS population treated 
with the target dose of 300 mg Tysabri SC. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall,  AEs  reported  were  consistent  with  AEs  commonly  reported  in  natalizumab  trials  and  in  the  post-
marketing setting. There were no specific patterns in the occurrence of SAEs that would suggest a difference 
between the SC and IV routes of natalizumab administration. With regard to infusion/injection reactions, the 
number of events was slighter higher in the SC group in study 101MS206 and ISR of mild/moderate severity 
were observed and would be a known risk. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Some level of uncertainty results from the relatively low number of patients treated with the target dose of 300 
mg SC. While it is not expected that adverse events related to Tysabri’s mode of action (most importantly PML) 
will be increased with a SC treatment regimen, the risk for immunogenicity could potentially be increased by 
administration via the SC route.No clear signal on an increased risk for immunogenicity has been detected so 
far but clinical data on the development of ADA is limited.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Based on results from studies 101MS102 and 101MS206 the clinical efficacy of subcutaneously administered 
Tysabri 300 mg given every 4 weeks is highly comparable to the approved IV regimen. The beneficial effects 
observed (reduction in newly active MR lesions, reduction in progression of disability, reduction in ARR) are 
considered highly relevant. 
The adverse effects observed are comparable with what is known for the established IV regimen. Due to the 
number of cases, no conclusions about the PML risk with SC administration could be draw. EID that have been 
identified as effective in mitigating the PML risk associated with IV administration of natalizumab have not been 
evaluated for the SC route so no recommendation for EID SC could be provided. The incidence of ADA with SC 
injection  is  considered  not  sufficiently  characterized  yet  and  should  therefore  be  subject  to  further 
investigations. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Tysabri IV has been established as a highly efficacious treatment for RRMS. Based on currently available data, 
and considering PK/PD analyses, the efficacy of 300 mg Tysabri SC Q4W is considered highly comparable to 
the approved IV regimen.  
The most important risk with Tysabri treatment is the occurrence of PML. Due to the rarity of the disease, no 
cases have been observed in patients treated via the SC route. More importantly, no recommendation regarding 
EID could be made for patients treated via the SC route. Specific statements were included in the SmPC and 
educational  material  to  clearly  communicate  that  the  information  on  EID  and  the  decrease  in  PML  risk  is 
currently based on IV data only and may not be extrapolated to the SC route. Due to the only small numbers 
analysed,  the  immunogenicity  potential  of  SC  administered  Tysabri  including  ADA  formation  and 
hypersensibility AEs was incompletely characterized and hence added as missing information in the RMP and 
will be further characterised in a PASS category 3 study. 
Based on these data, the benefit-risk of 300 mg Tysabri SC Q4W is considered positive.

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Tysabri 150 mg/ml solution for injection for SC administration is positive.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, efficacy and safety, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk  balance  of,  Tysabri  150mg,  solution  for  injection  in  pre-filled  syringe,  subcutaneous  use  is 
favourable in the following indication: 
TYSABRI  is  indicated  as  single  disease  modifying  therapy  in  adults  with  highly  active  relapsing  remitting 
multiple sclerosis (RRMS) for the following patient groups: 
• 
Patients with highly active disease activity despite a full and adequate course of treatment with at least 
one disease modifying therapy (DMT) (for exceptions and information about washout periods see sections 
4.4 and 5.1)  
or 
• 
Patients with rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis defined by 2 or more disabling 
relapses  in  one  year,  and  with  1  or  more  Gadolinium  enhancing  lesions  on  brain  Magnetic  Resonance 
Imaging (MRI) or a significant increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the marketing authorisation for Tysabri subject to the 
following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The Applicant shall perform the required  pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the  
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of 
the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Based on how patients treated  with Tysabri are currently monitored at national level, the MAH shall discuss 
and agree with the National Competent Authorities measures to enhance further this monitoring (e.g. registries, 
post-marketing surveillance studies) as appropriate. The MAH shall implement agreed measures for monitoring 
within a time frame agreed with the National Competent Authorities. 
The educational programme is aimed at educating healthcare professionals and patients/carers of the potential 
and  risk  factors  for  the  development  of  PML,  its  diagnosis  and  treatment,  and  the  identification  and 
management of possible sequelae. 
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where Tysabri is marketed, all healthcare professionals and 
patients/carers  who  are  expected  to  prescribe/use  Tysabri  have  access  to/are  provided  with  the  following 
educational materials: 
• 
Physician educational materials: 
˗  Summary of Product Characteristics  
˗  Physician Information and Management Guidelines 
• 
Patient information pack: 
˗  Package Leaflet 
˗  Patient Alert Card 
˗  Treatment initiation and treatment continuation forms 
˗  Treatment discontinuation form 
These educational materials shall contain the following key elements: 
Physician Information and Management Guidelines: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/102816/2021 
Page 76/78 
  
  
•  Background information on the increased risk of atypical/opportunistic infections, in particular PML, which 
may  occur  with  Tysabri  therapy,  including  a  detailed  discussion  of  data  (including  epidemiology, 
aetiology, and pathology) pertaining to the development of PML in Tysabri-treated patients.  
• 
Information relating to the identification of risk factors for Tysabri-associated PML, including details of 
the PML risk estimates algorithm summarising PML risk by risk factor (anti-John Cunningham virus [JCV] 
antibody status, prior IS use, and duration of treatment [by year of treatment]), and stratification of this 
risk by index value when applicable. 
•  Information on extending the dosing interval for PML risk mitigation, including a reminder of the 
approved dosing schedule. The decrease in PML risk is based on data from IV route of administration. No 
clinical  data  are  available  on  either  the  safety  or  efficacy  of  dosing  every  6  weeks  with  SC  route  of 
administration. 
• 
Inclusion  of  monitoring  guidance  for  MRI  and  anti-JCV  antibody  based  on  PML  risk,  including 
recommended timing, protocols, and interpretation of results. 
•  Detail  regarding  the  diagnosis  of  PML,  including  principals,  clinical  assessment  (including  MRI  and 
laboratory testing), and differentiation between PML and MS. 
•  Management recommendations in the event of cases of suspected PML, including considerations on the 
the  effectiveness  of  Plasma  Exchange  (PLEX)  treatment  and  the  management  of  associated  Immune-
reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). 
•  Detail on the prognosis on PML, including information on improved outcomes observed in asymptomatic 
PML cases.  
•  A reminder that irrespective of the presence or absence of PML risk factors, heightened clinical vigilance 
for  PML  should  be  maintained  in  all  patients  treated  with  Tysabri  and  for  6  months  following 
discontinuation of therapy. 
•  A  statement  that  all  data  available  to  characterise  PML  risk  are  from  the  IV  route  of  administration. 
Considering the similar PD profiles, the same PML risk and relevant risk factors are assumed for different 
routes of administration. 
•  A reminder on the need to discuss the benefit-risk profile of Tysabri treatment with the patient, and the 
requirement to provide the patient information pack.  
Patient alert card:  
•  Reminder to patients to show the card to any doctor and/or caregiver involved with their treatment, and 
to keep the card with them for 6 months after the last dose of Tysabri treatment.  
•  Reminder to patients to read the package leaflet carefully before starting Tysabri, and not to start Tysabri 
if there is a serious problem with their immune system. 
•  Reminder to patients no to take any other long-term medicines for MS while receiving Tysabri. 
•  A description of PML, potential symptoms and management of PML. 
•  A reminder of where to report side effects. 
•  Details of the patient, treating doctor and date Tysabri was started. 
Treatment initiation and treatment continuation forms: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/102816/2021

• 
Information on PML and IRIS, including the risk of developing PML during Tysabri treatment stratified by 
prior treatment with immunosuppressants and JCV infection.  
•  Confirmation that the doctor has discussed the risks of PML and the risk of IRIS if treatment is discontinued 
following suspicion of PML, and confirmation of patient understanding of the risks of PML and that they 
have received a copy of the treatment initiation form and a patient alert card.  
•  Patient details and prescriber name. 
The treatment continuation form should contain the elements of the treatment initiation form and, in addition, 
a statement that the risks of PML increase with duration of treatment and that treatment beyond 24 months 
carries additional risk. 
Treatment discontinuation form  
• 
• 
• 
Information for the patient that PML has been reported up to 6 months after stopping  Tysabri, and to 
therefore keep the patient alert card with them after treatment discontinuation.  
Reminder of PML symptoms, and when MRI imaging may be warranted. 
Reporting of side effects.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Product  
Edurant 25 mg film-coated tablets contain rilpivirine hydrochloride equivalent to 25 mg rilpivirine (RPV). 
RPV,  a  diarylpyrimidine  derivate  is  a  non-nucleoside  reverse  transcriptase  inhibitor  (NNRTI)  of  human 
immunodeficiency  virus  type  1  (HIV-1).  Edurant  was  licensed  in  EU  on  28  November  2011.  Edurant,  in 
combination  with  other  antiretroviral  medicinal  products, 
is 
indicated 
for  the  treatment  of 
human-immunodeficiency-virus-type-1  (HIV-1)  infection  in  antiretroviral-treatment-naïve  adult  patients 
with a viral load ≤ 100,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml. The dosing regimen for adults is 25 mg taken qd with a 
meal.  
Rilpivirine as part of a fixed-dose combination tablet is also approved in several countries, including the EU, 
as Complera/Eviplera (emtricitabine (200 mg), rilpivirine (25 mg) and tenofovir disoproxil (245 mg)). 
Scope of Application / Problem statement 
The data submitted in this application are the results from the Week 48 analysis of the C213 clinical trial. The 
MAH  aims  to  extent  the  current  indication  of  RPV  to  also  include  HIV-1  infected  ARV  treatment-naïve 
paediatric  patients  12  to  less  than  18  years  of  age  with  a  viral  load  ≤100,000  copies/mL  at  start  of 
treatment.  
An updated RMP (version 6.0) is enclosed to support this application. In addition to the updated paediatric 
information, the RMP has also been updated with the following information: 
- Section SVII.4.2. (Important Identified and Potential interactions) of the RMP has been updated to include 
information on the interaction of RPV with telaprevir (as submitted to EMA in procedure 
EMEA/H/C/002264/II/002). 
- The Pharmacovigilance Plan of the RMP has been updated to indicate that the results of the 
EDURANT/EVIPLERA Health Care Professional Survey (PASS) have been submitted to the Agency (procedure 
EMEA/H/C/002264/II/15). This submission was made in order to fulfill the Post-Authorization Measure 
(PAM) MEA 011.3 - HCP survey (PASS). The results of the survey are described in the RMP. 
- As requested by EMA on 20 January 2015 (EMA/43598/2015), the Pharmacovigilance Plan of the RMP 
(Section III.1) also has been updated to state that the data of the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry Interim 
Reports will be submitted together with the PSUR. 
- The MAH no longer considers ‘Drug-drug interactions’ as ‘missing information’. The RMP has been updated 
accordingly. 
- The MAH introduced a revised due date for the submission of the results of the TMC114HIV3015 study. The 
study is currently ongoing but additional subjects need to be recruited to study the pharmacokinetics of RPV 
in at least 12 HIV-1 infected pregnant women. Submission of the final trial study report (data from the RPV 
cohort) is planned in 4Q2016.

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
An  updated  ERA  is  not  required  as  this  extension  of  indication  is  not  expected  to  impact  the  total 
environmental exposure.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trial was performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The MAH claims that the C213 study, included in this submission, was conducted and reported in accordance 
with the ethical principles originating in the Declaration of Helsinki and in accordance with ICH Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP) guidelines, applicable regulatory requirements, and in compliance with the protocol. 
One site in South Africa was closed during the study following an inspection by the South African Medicines 
Control Council (local health authority), which identified GCP non-compliance. Four patients were enrolled at 
this site. Ongoing patients were transferred to another site. To evaluate whether the GCP non-compliance at 
site ZA00168 affected the results of the study, sensitivity analysis was performed excluding the data from 
this site for the primary efficacy endpoint, and for safety. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
ARV  treatment-naïve,  HIV-1  infected  adolescents  aged  ≥12  to  <18  years,  and  weighing  ≥32  kg  were 
included in this study. Pharmacokinetics of RPV was evaluated over a 48-week treatment period (see for 
further study details section 2.4 of this report). 
For measurement of rilpivirine plasma concentrations, a previous validated liquid 
chromatography  with  tandem  mass-spectrometry  [LS-MS/MS]  method  (BA1674)  was  applied  over  a 
calibration concentration range of 1 – 2000 ng/ml and showing a good accuracy and precision. Within–study 
results showed that accuracy was within normal run criteria. 
Part  1  of  the  study  (consisting  of  Part  1a  and  Part  1b)  was  designed  to  evaluate  the  steady-state 
pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and the short-term safety and antiviral activity of RPV 25 mg qd.  
In Part 1a, a group of 11 patients was enrolled, 4 patients in the age group ≥12 to <15 years and 7 patients 
in the age group ≥15 to <18 years. At Week 2, when these first 11 patients had been treated for at least 2 
weeks  or  discontinued  earlier,  an  analysis  of  RPV  pharmacokinetics  together  with  short-term  safety  and 
antiviral activity was performed, which was reviewed by an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC). 
Based on these Week 2 interim data the IDMC agreed for these patients to continue treatment with RPV 25 
mg qd and their background regimen. 
Part 1 of the study was for various reasons expanded to include another 14 patients (Part 1b), 8 patients in 
the age group ≥12 to <15 years and 6 patients in the age group ≥15 to <18 years, amounting to a total of 
25. At Week 4, when these additional 14 patients had been treated for at least 4 weeks or discontinued 
earlier, another Part 1 analysis was performed, which was evaluated by the IDMC before the start of Part 2 
of the study.

Page 7/34 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Full 24-hour pharmacokinetic profiles were determined at Week 2 (Part 1a) or at Week 4 (Part 1b) for 23 of 
the 25 patients included in Part 1 of the study (2 patients in Part 1 discontinued before any pharmacokinetic 
assessments were done). The results are shown in table PK 1. 
Table  PK  1.    Pharmacokinetic  parameters  of  RPV  after  multiple  dose  administration  of  RPV  25  mg  qd  in 
adolescents  (part  1)  in  comparison  with  pharmacokinetic  parameters  observed  in  adults  (pooled  data  of 
study TMC278-C209 and C215). 
In comparison to adults, the ratio of the least squares (LS) means for adolescents/adults was close to 100% 
for the different RPV PK parameters (see table PK 2). AUC24h, Ctrough, Cmin and Cmax were all within the 
range to conclude comparability in RPV pharmacokinetics between adults and adolescents (geometric mean 
ratio of >0.80 and <1.25).

Table PK 2. Steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of RPV after multiple dose administration of RPV 25 
mg qd in adolescents (study Part 1) and in adults (pooled data of TMC278-C209/C215 PK substudies). 
Based upon these data, next to short-term safety and efficacy data, patients continued their treatment with 
RPV 25 mg qd for Part 2. Here, sparse samples for the determination of RPV plasma concentrations were 
gathered in all patients at Week 2 (except Part 1a patients), Week 4 (except Part 1b patients), Week 8, Week 
12, Week 24 and Week 48. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC24h and Ctrough) of RPV for all patients were determined by means of 
empirical Bayes’ estimation using a population pharmacokinetic model previously developed for adults, and 
adjusted for adolescents using the intensive and sparse pharmacokinetic sampling data from the current 
study. In summary, the population pharmacokinetic model that best describes the pharmacokinetics of RPV 
when given as 25 mg qd with a meal in adolescents was (similar to adults) a 2-compartment disposition 
model  in  which  absorption  was  described  by  a  lag  time  followed  by  a  sequential  zero-  and  first-order 
absorption process. The population pharmacokinetic analysis did not necessitate a change to the structural 
fixed  parameters  of  the  previously  established  RPV  population  pharmacokinetic  model,  but  included  a 
modification of the random parameters with the addition of an inter-occasion variability on clearance. As 
such,  individual  pharmacokinetic  parameter  estimates  were  derived  for  each  visit  with  pharmacokinetic 
sampling.

The AUC24h (2391 ± 991 ng.h/ml) and Ctrough (84 ± 39 ng/ml) in adolescents at week 48 were similar to 
those obtained in adults (AUC24h: 2397 ± 1032 ng.h/ml; Cmax 80 ± 37 ng/ml) (see table PK 3). 
Table PK 3. Summary statistics of individual population pharmacokinetic model-derived parameters of RPV 
25 mg qd in adolescents and adults (Week 48 Analysis). 
Effect of age 
There was no clear relation between the RPV pharmacokinetics and age as a continuous variable and no 
relevant difference by age category (≥12 to <15 years and ≥15 to <18 years), with ranges of 
pharmacokinetic parameters overlapping between categories. This was also confirmed in the graphical 
evaluation of potential covariates in the population pharmacokinetic analysis for C213, where age was not 
found to impact the RPV apparent oral clearance (CL/F) or apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F). In 
addition, these results are in line with the data in adults, where no age effect was observed (see figure PK 1 
next page).

Figure PK 1. RPV pharmacokinetics (AUC24h) by age (left figure) and age category (right figure) in 
adolescents (C213) and adults (C209/C215). 
Effect of gender 
Twenty (55.6%) of the patients in C213 were female, and 16 (44.4%) were male. In adolescents in C213, 
there was no clinically relevant difference by gender, with ranges overlapping between males and females. 
This is in line with the data observed in adults. 
Effect of body weight 
The median (range) bodyweight at screening for patients in C213 was 45.2 (33 - 93) kg. Bodyweight did not 
impact the RPV pharmacokinetics in adolescent patients, across the bodyweight range in C213 (33 – 93 kg). 
This was also confirmed in the graphical evaluation of potential covariates in the population pharmacokinetic 
analysis for C213, where bodyweight was not found to impact the RPV CL/F or Vd/F. These results are similar 
for the RPV pharmacokinetics in adults, across a wider bodyweight (see figure PK 2).

range (36.2 - 200.9 kg). 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The results at week 48 showed that pharmacokinetics at week 24 and 48 were comparable. Moreover, week 
48 data showed that AUC24h and Ctrough were comparable to those in adults. These data support the 
efficacy of RPV 25 qd in adolescents.  In adolescents no effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of RPV were 
seen. This is in line with what previous was observed for adults, in the age range of the Phase 3 studies.  
No clinical relevant effect of gender or body weight was observed in adolescents.  
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
AUC24h and Ctrough values were comparable to those observed in adults, which in principle supports the 
efficacy of RPV 25 qd also in adolescents. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main study 
Study TMC278-TiDP38-C213: A Phase II, open-label, single arm trial to evaluate the 
pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and antiviral activity of TMC278 in antiretroviral-naïve 
HIV-1 infected adolescents aged 12 to <18 years (EudraCT: 2008-001696-30). 
Methods 
The design of the study C213 is shown in Figure 1.

a To ensure that the duration between baseline and the review by the IDMC for subjects in Part 1a of the study was kept as short as 
possible, investigators were to identify eligible subjects in advance. Recruitment was to be started when the majority of the sites had the 
necessary documentation and approvals in place and were therefore considered activated for enrollment. 
For Part 1b of the study, recruitment could start at the individual sites as soon as the necessary documentation and approvals were in place, 
and was closed once the required number of subjects was recruited. Study sites were informed in advance regarding stop of recruitment. 
b For Part 1a of the study, at least 5 subjects in the age group ≥12 to <15 years and at least 5 subjects in the age group ≥15 to <18 years 
were to be recruited (simultaneously). Part 1a included 11 subjects, 4 subjects in the age group ≥12 to <15 years and 7 subjects in the age 
group 15 to <18 years. In Part 1b of the study, approximately 12 subjects (in order to have at least 10 evaluable subjects at Week 4) were 
to be enrolled, aiming at an equal distribution of subjects between the two age groups (i.e., subjects 12 to <15 years and subjects ≥15 to 
<18 years). Part 1b of the study included 14 subjects, 8 subjects in the age group 12 to <15 years and 6 subjects in the age group ≥ 15 
to <18 years. 
c Investigator-selected with a choice limited to zidovudine (AZT), abacavir (ABC), or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) in combination 
with lamivudine (3TC) or emtricitabine (FTC), given as the co-formulation or as the separate components. 
d Subjects included in Part 1 of the study continued their ART regimen and the study during this review period. 
e In case the study would have been stopped after Part 1, a sample was to be analyzed in real time for the determination of HIV-1 genotype 
(as long as the plasma viral load was sufficiently high to allow the HIV-1 genotype to be determined), in order to assist in the selection of 
Assessment report  
EMA/742847/2015

a new ART. When determination of HIV-1 genotype on this sample would not have been possible due to a too low plasma viral load, the new 
ART would have been based on the screening HIV-1 genotyping result. 
f In case the results of Part 1 of the study would have shown a safety concern as deemed by the IDMC, which could have been avoided by 
a lower RPV exposure. 
g Analysis would have been done when these subjects would have been treated for 4 weeks (+/- 1 week) with the weight-adjusted dose. 
h Because no dose switch was required, Part 2 of the study could start immediately after the positive IDMC evaluation of the results of Part 
1 of the study. In case a dose switch would have been required, Part 2 of the study would have started after re-evaluation by the IDMC of 
the analysis when subjects would have been treated for 4 weeks (+/- 1 week) with the weight-adjusted dose. 
i The screening period could be prolonged to maximum 8 weeks in order to allow plasma viral load and CD4+ cell count to be assessed 
before continuing with the other screening assessments. After obtaining informed consent, samples were taken for determination of plasma 
viral load and CD4+ cell count. If plasma viral load results met the inclusion criteria and the investigator considered initiation of ART 
appropriate (taking into account current treatment guidelines, including CD4+ cell count and the subject’s clinical situation), the subject 
returned within 2 weeks after availability of these results, for the remainder of the screening procedures. If plasma viral load results did not 
meet the inclusion criteria, the subject was considered a screen failure. 
Study participants 
The study population consisted of boys and girls, aged ≥12 to <18 years, weighing ≥32 kg, with 
documented chronic HIV-1 infection who were treatment naïve at screening. Patients’ HIV-1 plasma viral 
load at screening was ≥500 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL but ≤100,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL for Part 1b and Part 
2 of the study. For Part 1a, patients with a screening viral load ≥ 5,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL were allowed.  
Main exclusion criteria were: NNRTI resistance at screening or from historical data available in the source 
documents; any currently active Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) defining illness; any active 
clinically significant disease; Risk factors for QTc prolongation.  
Treatments 
The  ART  regimen  consisted  of  RPV  25  mg  qd,  in  combination  with  2  NRTIs  (zidovudine  (AZT),  abacavir 
(ABC), or tenofovir disoproxyl fumarate (TDF) in combination with lamivudine (3TC) or emtricitabine (FTC), 
whichever was approved and marketed). The NRTIs were selected by the investigator.  
Switching to alternative NRTIs was allowed for some predefined toxicities. The use of ABC needed to be 
preceded by a negative HLA-B*5701-test. 
Objectives 
The objectives of Part 1 of this study were: 
- 
- 
to evaluate the steady-state pharmacokinetics of RPV 25 mg qd in patients aged ≥12 to <18 years; 
to evaluate short-term safety and antiviral activity of RPV in this age group. 
The objectives of Part 2 of this study were: 
- 
- 
- 
-

The efficacy parameters for this study that were tabulated, analyzed descriptively (eg, n, mean, 
SD, minimum, median, maximum) and presented graphically include: 
Proportion of subjects with plasma viral load <50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL at Week 24 and Week 48. 
The changes from baseline in the log10 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL values by analysis time point. 
The changes in plasma viral load from baseline by subgroups (≤100,000 and >100,000 HIV-1 RNA 
copies/mL). 
Proportion of subjects with a plasma viral load <50 and <400 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL at all-time points, and 
time to achieve these. 
Proportion of subjects with a decrease from baseline in plasma viral load of 1.0 log10 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL 
at Week 12 
Time to loss of virologic response. 
The change from baseline in CD4+ cell count (absolute and %) was the immunology parameter, which was 
presented by analysis time point and by subgroups (≤100,000 and >100,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL). 
Immunologic Change:  
The change from baseline in CD4+ cell count (absolute and %) was the immunology parameter, which 
was presented by analysis time point and by subgroups (≤100,000 and >100,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL). 
Resistance Determinations:  
Relevant changes in the viral phenotype and genotype (emerging mutations, incidence of mutations, 
subjects with post-baseline genotypic data by emerging resistance-associated mutations [RAMs] and by 
phenotypic resistance and cross-resistance) were tabulated and analysed descriptively particularly for 
subjects with virologic failure (VF). 
Safety: Only treatment-emergent events are described in the results.

None.   
Results 
Participant flow 
36 patients were enrolled. Of these 36 patients, 24 (66.7%) patients were ongoing at the Week 48 analysis 
cut-off date (12 June 2014), while 8 (22.2%) patients prematurely discontinued the study prior to that time. 
Four (11.1%) patients completed the study at Week 48 and did not continue in the post Week 48 extensions. 
Among the 8 patients who prematurely discontinued, 6/36 (16.7%) patients reached a virologic endpoint, 1 
(2.8%) subject had been dosed despite the presence of an exclusionary NNRTI RAM at screening (protocol

deviation) and was therefore discontinued after 7 days of dosing, and another subject was diagnosed with 
pulmonary tuberculosis during the study and was withdrawn from the study before the Week 48 analysis 
cut-off date as per withdrawal criteria.  
Conduct of the study 
Major protocol deviations were observed for 3 (8.3%) patients, table below. One patient entered the study 
despite the presence of an exclusionary NNRTI RAM at screening and was discontinued after 7 days. The 
major protocol deviations reported for the other 2 patients were related to lack of RPV intake and/or intake 
without food.   
Table E1: Protocol deviations 
One site in South Africa was closed during the study following an inspection by the South African Medicines 
Control Council (local health authority), which identified GCP non-compliance. Four patients were enrolled at 
this site. Ongoing patients were transferred to another site. To evaluate whether the GCP non-compliance at 
site ZA00168 affected the results of the study, sensitivity analysis was performed excluding the data from 
this site for the primary efficacy endpoint, and for safety.  
Adherence to RPV treatment was assessed by pill count and by questionnaires. Based on pill count, the mean 
RPV treatment adherence until Week 48 was 97.5% (4.80).  
The majority of patients, 28/36 (77.8%), had an adherence of >95% to RPV treatment at Week 48, while 
8/36 (22.2%) patients had an adherence of <95% to RPV treatment at Week 48. All patients had a mean 
adherence of at least 80%. 
Baseline data 
Patients were enrolled and treated at sites in the following countries: South Africa (3 sites), India (1 site), 
Thailand (1 site), USA (1 site), Uganda (1 site). 
The majority of patients were black or African American (32/36 [88.9%] patients), 20/36 (55.6%) were 
female. There were 18 (50.0%) patients in each of the following age categories: ≥12 to <15 years and ≥15 
to <18 years. 
The majority of patients were infected with HIV-1 clade C (23/36 [63.9%] patients), followed by clade A1 
(9/36 [25.0%] patients). The combination of NRTIs most frequently used together with RPV was FTC/TDF 
(24/36 [66.7%] subjects). TDF/3TC was used by 8/36 (22.2%) subjects and AZT/3TC was used by 4/36 
(11.1%) subjects. See next table for more details.

Resistance determination 
Baseline resistance 
For all 36 patients, genotypic data were available at baseline and/or screening. One subject carrying V179T 
at  screening  and  baseline  was  enrolled  in  error.  This  subject  discontinued  the  study  at  Week  1  for  this 
reason, and was identified as VF in the Week 48 TLOVR efficacy analysis. 
A total of 8/36 (22.2%) patients carried at least 1 NNRTI RAM at (pre-) baseline. These were V179I (n=7) 
(non-exclusionary) and V179T (n=1) (as indicated above). None of the patients carried RPV RAMs or NRTI 
RAMs at baseline. 
Analysis of virologic failures 
Of  the  20  patients  with  post-baseline  genotypic  data,  8  patients  experienced  VF  in  the  first  48  weeks 
according to the TLOVR imputation (4 patients ‘never suppressed’ and 4 patients ‘rebounder’), 2 patients 
discontinued due to other reasons than VF (1 due to an AE and 1 due to other reasons), and 10 patients were 
responders  at  Week  48.  Of  these  10  responders  at  Week  48,  4  patients  experienced  VF  (TLOVR;  all 
‘rebounder’)  after  their  Week  48  visit  (before  the  cut-off  for  the  Week  48  analysis),  while  6  patients 
remained responders.  
The next table shows the emergence of resistance in the mentioned 20 patients, for who paired data was 
available.

Study TMC278-TiDP38-C213 (EudraCT: 2008-001696-30) 
Study C213 is an ongoing Phase 2, open-label, single arm study to evaluate the 
pharmacokinetics, safety/tolerability and efficacy of RPV (TMC278) 25 mg qd in 
combination with an investigator-selected background regimen containing 2 
NRTIs in ARV treatment-naïve, HIV-1 infected adolescents aged 12 to <18 
years and weighing ≥32 kg. The study is being conducted at multiple sites in 
different countries. 
Part 1 of the study (consisting of Part 1a and Part 1b) was designed to evaluate 
the steady-state pharmacokinetic profile and the short-term safety/tolerability 
and antiviral activity of RPV 25 mg qd when administered in combination with 
an investigator-selected background regimen of 2 NRTIs. The allowed ARV 
background regimen consisted of AZT, ABC or TDF in combination with 3TC or 
FTC. Part 2 of the study evaluated long-term safety/tolerability, efficacy, and 
pharmacokinetics of RPV in combination with an investigator-selected 
background regimen of 2 NRTIs. 
Antiretroviral treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected subjects, aged ≥12 to <18 years, 
with a VL ≥5,000 copies/mL could be included in Part 1a of the study. However, 
by amendment III (29 June 2011), in Part 1b and Part 2 recruitment was 
limited to subjects with a VL of ≥500 copies/mL but ≤100,000 copies/mL 
(further to the observed effect of baseline VL on virologic outcome in adults and 
in line with the current approved indication in adults in most regions/countries 
including the EU). 
Subjects who experienced and were expected to continue experiencing clinical 
benefit from RPV and their background regimen comprising 2 NRTIs at the end 
of the initial 48-week treatment period, had the option to continue their ARV 
treatment (ie, RPV + 2 investigator-selected NRTIs) through this study for an 
additional 4 years in a post Week 48 treatment extension period. During this 
extension period, safety and efficacy of RPV will be evaluated.

To evaluate the short and long term safety and 
tolerability of RPV when administered as 25 mg 
qd in patients aged 12 to <18 years  
PK parameters for RPV were determined based 
on intensive sampling at Week 2 or Week 4 in a 
subset of subjects (Part 1, n=23) and sparse 
sampling over the 48 week treatment period in 
all subjects (Part 2, n=36). In Part 1, a 
non-compartmental PK analysis identified a 
RPV dose in adolescents that resulted in similar 
RPV exposures as in adults. In Part 2, the RPV 
PK was explored by means of population PK 
analysis.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Similar drug exposure was shown in adolescents as in adult, which is the main requirement for inferring 
antiretroviral efficacy in any paediatric population. The 48-week efficacy results demonstrate that RPV 25 
mg qd, in combination with an investigator-selected background regimen of 2 NRTIs, is efficacious in 
adolescents, ≥12 to <18 years of age. The percentage Responder, both at Week 24 and at Week 48, is in line 
with results for other antiretrovirals in adolescents.  Similar as in adults, the proportion of virologic 
responders in adolescents was clearly higher in patients with a baseline viral load ≤100,000 copies/mL 
(22/28 [78.6%]) than in the patients with a baseline viral load >100,000 copies/mL (4/8 [50%]). This is 
already incorporated in the SmPC as Edurant is currently indicated for the treatment of 
human-immunodeficiency-virus-type-1 (HIV-1) infection in antiretroviral-treatment- naïve adult patients 
with a viral load ≤ 100,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml. A similar restriction will be applied to adolescents.  
Although efficacy in adolescents was overall acceptable, the number of youngsters having virological failure, 
and with resistance development to both the NNRTI and NRTI class within a year of therapy, is of concern 
based on available data.  In 6 out of 8 patients with VF, the development of NNRTI-RAMs was observed (i.e. 
in 6 out of a total of 36 patients).  At least 1 NRTI-RAM was observed at the same time point in 4 out of 5 
patients. The proportion of patients ending up with resistance within 1 year of therapy is worrying.  
Adherence to treatment is of paramount importance when using a regimen of rilpivirine with 2NRTI. The 
PENTA paediatric HIV treatment guideline discusses well known adherence issues among adolescents, in 
relation to the differing barriers to resistance of different antiretroviral regimens (Bamford et al, HIV 
Medicine 2015).  Based on such considerations, it is imperative that the SmPC section 4.4 emphasises the 
need to assess the likelihood of acceptable treatment adherence prior to prescribing rilpivirine to 
adolescents. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, the overall efficacy in adolescents was acceptable, with 72.2% of patients reaching viral load <50 
copies/mL at week 48, and CD4+ cells increasing substantially (mean increase of 201.2 cells at week 48). 
However, the resistance data are worrying and the MAH was asked to propose a text for section 4.4., 
emphasizing the need to assess the likelihood of acceptable treatment adherence in adolescents, prior to 
prescribing rilpivirine.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
In  non-clinical  studies  in  rats  and  dogs,  changes  in  adrenal  hormones  and  histopathology  have  been 
observed. In those studies, RPV appears to interfere with steroid biosynthesis, leading to decreases in serum 
cortisol and increases in serum progesterone and 17-OH-progesterone and as a result to increases in serum 
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Endocrine monitoring was therefore included in the safety monitoring 
of all RPV studies conducted thus far. To date, no significant effects on adrenal or thyroid function were 
observed in any study with RPV in adults. 
In theory, some concerns in adolescents could be raised by these non-clinical findings: the possibility of 
partial adrenal insufficiency, virilisation in girls due to 21-hydroxylase inhibition and precocious puberty due 
to ovarian stimulation in girls. If adolescent girls who have not reached puberty yet would sexually mature 
more rapidly as a result of treatment with RPV, the main effect would be the earlier occurrence of menarche. 
More importantly, in case significant inhibition of cortisol synthesis would occur, androgen production might 
increase. In adolescent girls, this could result in masculinization and blunted growth. In adolescent boys, 
due to increased levels of testosterone, growth might also be impaired. Therefore, in this study, growth was 
to be followed regularly and evaluated consistently using standardized growth charts. Sexual maturation 
was to be evaluated according to Tanner stages. Finally, hormone testing was to be performed, including 
measurements  of  serum  testosterone,  follicle  stimulating  hormone  (FSH),  luteinizing  hormone  (LH), 
cortisol,  progesterone,  androstenedione,  aldosterone,  dehydroepiandrosterone  sulfate  (DHEAS),  and 
17-OH-progesterone. 
Patient exposure 
At the time of cut-off for the Week 48 analysis of C213, 24 (66.7%) subjects were ongoing and the mean 
(standard deviation [SD]) and median (range) duration of exposure to RPV 25 mg qd was 71.6 (43.09) and 
63.50 (1.0-179.0) weeks, respectively. The total patient years of RPV exposure was 49.40 and half of the 
subjects had reached the Week 64 visit at the time of this analysis. 
Adverse events /serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
For 35 (97.2%) patients at least 1 AE was reported, for 13 (36.1%) of these patients an AE was considered 
treatment-related. In most patients, AEs were of grade 1-2 in severity. At least 1 grade 3-4 AE was reported 
in a total of 7 (19.4%) patients. One (2.8%) subject had at least 1 AE for which treatment was stopped.  
There was no signal for unknown safety issues: the safety profile in adolescents was is in line with the known 
safety profile in adults.

Table S1. Safety profile in study C213 compared to safety in pooled Phase 3 studies  
Depression was reported more often in adolescents (19.4%) compared  to adults (4.1% in the Phase  III 
controlled  trials  ECHO  and  THRIVE).  One  patient  had  a  suicide  attempt  (considered  not  related  by  the 
investigator).  
For  a  total  of  13  (36.1%)  subjects,  treatment-related  AEs  were  reported;  the  most  frequently  reported 
events were somnolence in 5 (13.9%) subjects and blood cortisol decreased. Although the adverse event 
(AE) “blood cortisol decreased”, was reported in 7/36 (19.4%) adolescent subjects, analysis provided by the 
MAH shows that these AEs were not  associated with treatment-emergent abnormal laboratory findings of 
basal or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-stimulated blood cortisol. For no subjects with the AE “blood 
cortisol  decreased”,  the  AEs  “somnolence”  or  “depression”  were  reported.  Additionally,  the  AEs 
“somnolence”  and  “depression”  were  generally  not  associated  with  treatment-emergent  abnormal 
laboratory findings of basal or ACTH-stimulated cortisol. Therefore these AEs are not considered signs and 
symptoms of adrenal insufficiency. Furthermore, no AE “adrenal insufficiency” was reported.   
None  of  the  SAEs  reported  in  C213  were  considered  treatment-related,  except  for  grade  2  SAE 
hypersensitivity (“probably related” according to the investigator).  
There were no deaths in the study. 
One  subject  discontinued  study  drugs  due  to  an  AE  (pulmonary  tuberculosis,  mandatory  withdrawal 
criterion). 
Laboratory findings 
There were no signals for different patterns of common lab chemistry in adolescents, as compared to in adult 
patients. 
With regards to adrenal safety, there were no consistent mean or median changes from baseline in basal 
cortisol, 17-hydroxyprogesterone and aldosterone levels over the first 48 weeks of treatment. The majority 
of  patients  achieved  ACTH  stimulated  cortisol  values  above  the  cut-off  of  500  nmol/L.  However,  blood 
cortisol decreased was reported as a grade 1 AE in 7 (19.4%) patients. The AE was considered possibly 
related to RPV in 3 (8.3%) patients, doubtfully related to RPV in 2 (5.6%) patients and doubtfully related to 
ARV  background  regimen  in  2  (5.6%)  patients  by  the  investigator  (association  refuted  by  MAH  -  see 
discussion above). 
At the Week 48 analysis cut-off date, the AE had resolved in all but one of these patients, who also had an 
abnormal ACTH stimulation test since baseline.

Mean and median androstenedione, DHEAS, FSH, LH, progesterone and testosterone values were visually 
inspected for trends over time; mean and median changes from baseline were generally small and variable 
in direction.  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  safety  profile  in  adolescents  in  general  is  in  line  with  the  known  safety  profile  in  adults.  However, 
depression  is  reported  more  often  in  adolescents  (19.4%)  compared  to  adults  (4.1%  in  the  Phase  III 
controlled trials ECHO and THRIVE). It is likely that this high rate of depression is due to the population 
under study (HIV-infected adolescents).  A direct association with RPV did not emerge from additional data 
provided by the MAH. Hence, routine risk minimization measures (‘blood cortisol decreased’, ‘depression’ 
and ‘insomnia’ in section 4.8 of the SmPC) are considered sufficient. 
RPV did not seem to have an effect on growth, as a mean increase in height of 2.6 cm was observed during 
the 48 weeks study period.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The Week 48 safety data of study C213 demonstrated that RPV, administrated at 25 mg qd, in combination 
with an investigator-selected background regimen of 2 NRTIs, was generally safe and well tolerated in 
adolescents aged ≥12 to < 18 years.

The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Currently,  Edurant,  in  combination  with  other  antiretroviral  medicinal  products,  is  indicated  for  the 
treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in antiretroviral treatment-naïve adult 
patients with a viral load ≤ 100,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml. The MAH submitted a type II variation to extend 
the indication to include treatment of ARV treatment-naïve paediatric patients aged 12 to <18 years of age, 
on the basis of a single arm, open-label study performed in 36 patients. 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The  pharmacokinetic  parameters  analysed  showed  that  AUC24h  and  Ctrough  were  comparable  between 
adolescents and adults. As a consequence, no differences in efficacy are expected between adolescents and 
adults.  An  overall  72%  of  patients  (26/36)  reached  viral  load  <50  copies/mL  at  week  48.  As  expected, 
patients starting treatment with a viral load ≤ 100,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml (approved indication for RPV) 
achieved better virologic responses 22/28 (78.6%).  
The safety profile of RPV in adolescents was overall comparable to the known safety profile in adults, which 
is considered favourable. RPV did not appear to affect pubertal development or growth in the adolescents 
included in the study.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Efficacy results in adolescents were slightly lower compared  to those observed in adults, likely linked to 
sub-optimal  adherence.  Potential  treatment  adherence  issues  should  be  considered  prior  to  start  RPV 
antiretroviral treatment in adolescents due to the risk for development of resistance, which is adequately 
reflected in the product information. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The proportion of patients with virological failure over 48 weeks is substantial (8/36), and in these cases de 
novo resistance to both the NNRTI- and NRTI-class was frequently observed; such class resistance was seen 
in 6/8 and 4/8 respectively.  
AEs were frequently reported, and approximately 1/3 of the AEs observed were considered as treatment 
related. However, no new safety issues were identified in the adolescent patient population. 
Depression was more frequently observed in adolescents (19.4%) compared to adults (4.1% in the Phase 3 
controlled trials).  
In non-clinical studies in rats and dogs, RPV appeared to interfere with steroid biosynthesis. In the present

study in adolescents, blood cortisol decreased was reported in 7/36 (19.4%) of patients, compared with 
15/686 (2.2%) of patients in the adult pooled Phase 3 studies.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Depression  was  more  frequently  reported  in  adolescents  compared  to  adults.  This  is  likely  linked  to  the 
population under study (HIV-1 infected adolescents) being already at higher risk.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
For extension of the indication to adolescents it is important to show that drug exposure in adolescents is 
similar to adults.  
With regard to unfavourable effects, the development of resistance associated mutations are important, as 
these may also impact 2nd line ARV treatment options. Moreover, as the target population are adolescents, 
potential effects on pubertal development or growth are also of importance.  
Benefit-risk balance 
The  pharmacokinetic  parameters  PK  analysed  showed  comparable  exposure  in  adolescents  and  adults, 
which is  further  supported  by  the  efficacy  data.  Potential  treatment  adherence  issues  should  considered 
prior to start RPV antiretroviral treatment due to the risk for development of resistance.  
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
Rilpivirine is generally efficacious and very well tolerated. However, contrary to the case with several other 
modern antiretrovirals, the dose and subsequent exposure chosen for rilpivirine does not yield exposures 
very far above what is necessary for durable antiviral suppression, when used in combination with 2 NRTIs. 
This is illustrated, e.g., by the lower efficacy in patients with high viral load, which prompted a restriction of 
the indication to patients with <100,000 copies per mL, as well as by the fact that an exposure-response 
relation was seen in phase III studies (see Edurant EPAR). Furthermore, rilpivirine requires intake with food 
in order to achieve adequate bioavailability. Also, the clinical consequences of this relatively small margin to 
underexposure are aggravated by the low barrier to resistance of the regimen in question, where resistance 
relevant to both the NNRTI and the NRTI class is generally selected on failure. 
Thus, an adequate response to rilpivirine requires a very high adherence to the regimen as such, as well as 
to recommendations on intake with food. Suboptimal adherence carries a high risk for loss of important 
future treatment options. It is generally accepted that adolescents in general, as well as HIV-infected 
adolescents, are challenging to treat successfully due to adherence problems.  Due to the loss of important 
treatment options that may thus be incurred, a positive B/R for the sought, adolescent indication is not 
self-evident. Appropriate use in adolescents requires careful selection of patients deemed or demonstrated 
by treatment history to show high adherence levels. This issue has been adequately solved in response to 
the request for supplementary information (RSI) by including a statement in section 4.4. of the SmPC that 
“Only adolescents deemed likely to have good adherence to antiretroviral therapy should be treated with 
rilpivirine, as suboptimal adherence can lead to development of resistance and the loss of future treatment 
options.”

undertaken to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety/ tolerability, and efficacy of rilpivirine 25 mg qd in 
combination with an investigator-selected background regimen containing two nucleoside (nucleotide) 
reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in this adolescent population. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 
4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated and the Package Leaflet has been updated 
accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the contact details of the local 
representative in Denmark in the Package Leaflet. A revised RMP version 6.1 was agreed during the 
procedure. 
The requested group of variations proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, 
Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

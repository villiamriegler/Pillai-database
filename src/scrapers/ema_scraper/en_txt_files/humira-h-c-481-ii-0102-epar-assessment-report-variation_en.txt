2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
20 September 2012 
15 November 2012 
02 January 2013 
17 January 2013 
JIA is an autoimmune disease with a complex genetic predisposition with onset occurring in children 
under the age of 16 years. It is the most common rheumatic disease of childhood and an important 
cause of disability in children with an incidence of 15 per 100,000. In North American and European 
populations, it is 2.5 times more common in females than in males. 
The onset of JIA is characterized by three primary modes: pauciarticular (<5 joints) – the most 
frequent mode, observed in 50% of patients, polyarticular (≥5 joints) – observed in 30% of patients 
and systemic arthritis (≥1 joint with fever and rash) – observed in 10% to 20% of patients. 
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the usual first line treatment for JIA as they are 
considered to be the least toxic agents in children. NSAIDs provide symptomatic relief but are not 
considered to be disease-modifying. Methotrexate (MTX) is considered to have an acceptable level of 
toxicity relative to its efficacy; most children do respond to MTX therapy; however, disease remission 
is rare. With MTX, the onset of response can range from 3 to 6 months, although many patients show 
an earlier response. However, many children have a disease relapse after the withdrawal of MTX, even 
after achieving a robust clinical response. 
Other types of traditional medications commonly used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adults are 
less preferable for use in pediatric patients. Cytotoxic drugs may have unacceptable risk in children 
because of their immunosuppressive and mutagenic properties. Systemic and intra-articular 
corticosteroids promote susceptibility to infections, osteoporosis and growth disturbance and have not 
been shown to be disease modifying in children with JIA. 
Humira contains adalimumab, a recombinant, fully human immunoglobulin (IgG1) monoclonal antibody 
that binds specifically and with high affinity to the soluble and transmembrane forms of tumor necrosis 
factor (TNF)-α and inhibits the binding of TNF-α to its receptors. 
Humira is currently approved in the EU for the following indication for JIA: Humira in combination with 
methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, in 
children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years who have had an inadequate response to one or more 
disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Humira can be given as monotherapy in case of 
Humira

intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate. Humira 
has not been studied in children aged less than 4 year.  
Humira is also indicated for treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA), active 
and progressive psoriatic arthritis (PsA), severe active ankylosing spondylitis (AS), Axial 
spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS, severe active Crohn’s disease (CD), moderate to 
severe active ulcerative colitis (UC) and moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis (Ps).  
Data used for the initial approval for JIA in children and adolescents aged 4-17 years were from the 
Study DE038. As part of a Pediatric Investigation Plan, the MAH conducted Study M10-444 to 
investigate adalimumab treatment in children with JIA who are 2 to <4 years of age or ≥4 years of age 
weighing <15 kg.  
The purpose of this variation is to extend the indication for Humira for the treatment of paediatric 
subjects with active polyarticular JIA from 4 to 17 years to 2 to 17 years of age. The recommended 
dose of adalimumab for this younger patient population is 24 mg/m2 body surface area (BSA), 
administered every other week (eow) (same as that currently approved for patients 4 to 12 years of 
age). In support of this variation, the MAH has submitted the results of clinical study M10-444.   
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A single Phase 3b study, Study M10-444, was conducted to support the indication extension to treat 
paediatric subjects with active polyarticular JIA who are 2 to <4 years of age. Study M10-444 is 
ongoing. Data on safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics from this study were presented, and put in 
context with available clinical data particularly from the clinical study DE038 that supported the use of 
adalimumab in JIA patients aged 4-17 years. The application initially contained data from Study M10-
444 up to Week 24 and subsequent data for any subjects who continued past Week 24 at the time of 
the interim database lock (09 September 2011, the last subject's Week 24 visit). During the procedure 
the MAH provided an interim safety analysis (data cut-off 24 May 2012) up to Week 60. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.   
2.3.2.  Clinical pharmacology aspects 
The clinical pharmacology and immunogenicity of adalimumab have been well characterized in healthy 
adult subjects as well as in adult subjects with RA, PsA, AS, CD and Ps. These data have been provided 
in previous submissions. Additional analytical studies were included in this variation because the assay 
methods for serum adalimumab and anti-adalimumab antibody (AAA) were modified for Study  
M10-444.

2.3.2.1.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Analytical methods 
Adalimumab in serum 
Serum adalimumab was assayed by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) discussed 
in the previous submission for the JIA indication. A specific and sensitive assay was developed to 
measure adalimumab concentrations in serum for the human pharmacokinetic (PK) studies. A total of 
52 human serum samples from Study M10-444 were received and 47 samples were analysed.  
Anti-adalimumab antibodies in serum 
Serum AAA was assayed by means of ELISA discussed in the previous submission for the RA indication. 
The AAA assay was re-validated. Study M10-444 was assayed for serum AAA using the new 
re-validation method. The re-validation parameters were summarized. 
Study procedures 
Study M10-444 included in total 32 children 2 to <4 years old or age 4 and above weighing less than 
15 kg with JIA. Plasma concentration data and immunogenicity data were available from 15 subjects. 
Eleven of these 15 subjects were also treated with MTX. The administered dose of adalimumab was 
24 mg/m2 BSA up to a total dose of 20 mg adalimumab administered every other week (eow) as a 
single dose via subcutaneous injection. Trough serum samples for analysis of adalimumab and AAA 
were drawn at Baseline, at Week 12 and 24 or at Early Termination (ET). 
The PK of adalimumab in Study M10-444 was also compared with data from the previous study 
(Study DE038) in children 4 to 17 years of age with JIA, receiving adalimumab at a dose or 24 mg/m2. 
In Study DE038, the subjects were stratified as MTX-treated or non-MTX-treated prior to study 
enrollment. PK data were obtained from the open-label lead-in (OL LI) phase of the study, which 
included 16 weeks of treatment   
2.3.2.2.  Results 
Demographics of the subjects included in the new study, M10-444, are shown in Table 1. Eleven of the 
15 subjects received concomitant MTX.  
Table 1 
Baseline demographic summary for subjects in study M10-444 
Of the 171 subjects enrolled in the OL LI phase of the previous study, DE038, the mean age was 11.3 
years (range of 4 to 17 years). The mean weight was 42.2 kg (range of 13 to 99 kg). The mean BSA 
was 1.28 m2 (range of 0.57 to 2.16 m2). The majority (79.0%) of subjects was female and 95.3%

were White. The number of subjects on MTX ranged between 82 and 36 over week 0 to 16 and 
subjects without MTX ranged between 82 and 29.  
Trough serum levels of adalimumab 
Mean serum adalimumab trough concentrations in Study M10-444 were approximately 6 to 8 μg/mL at 
Week 12 and Week 24 in subjects who were 2 to <4 year olds and ≥4 year olds but body weight 
<15 kg. Steady state appeared to have been reached by week 12. The mean serum adalimumab 
concentrations at steady-state were observed to be higher in subjects who received concomitant 
methotrexate (MTX) compared to the non-MTX stratum.

Comparison of Study M10-444 and Study DE038 
Study DE038 was a multicenter, Phase 3, randomized, stratified, double-blind, parallel-group study in 
children (ages of 4 to 17 years) with JIA. The subjects were stratified as MTX-treated or non-MTX-
treated prior to study enrollment. Subjects in the MTX group were treated concomitantly with MTX 
during the study.  Subjects who were in the non-MTX group were either naïve to MTX or had been 
withdrawn from MTX at least 2 weeks prior to study drug administration and were not treated 
concomitantly with MTX during the study. The study consisted of a 16-week open-label lead-in followed 
by a 32-week double-blind phase with a subsequent open-label extension (OLE) period. A total of 171 
subjects were enrolled in the open-label lead-in phase and 133 subjects were randomized and dosed in 
the double-blind phase of Study DE038. Summary statistics of adalimumab concentrations during the 
open-label lead-in phase in Study DE038 are presented in Table 3.

Mean steady-state adalimumab serum concentrations in Study M10-444 (Week 24) appeared to be 
similar to those observed in Study DE038 (Week 16). It has been observed that concomitant MTX use 
results in higher serum adalimumab concentrations. While MTX administration was controlled during 
Study DE038, this was not the case for subjects who received MTX during Study M10-444.  It is 
possible that subjects received MTX, but were not currently on a stable dose. 
Anti-adalimumab antibodies 
In Study DE038, there were 19 AAA positive (AAA+) subjects (11.1%, 19/171) during open-label 
phase. Among them, 4 (4.7%, 4/85) subjects were with concomitant MTX and 15 (17.4%, 15/86) 
subjects were without MTX. In Study M10-444, one subject became AAA+ by Week 24. Among 15 
subjects who had pharmacokinetic samples analyzed, the AAA+ rate was 6.67% (1/15). Overall, the 
number of subjects who developed AAA was too small (N = 1) to make definitive conclusions regarding 
the effect of AAA on safety or efficacy in pediatric subjects with JIA. Based on DE038 no increased 
adverse events were reported in subjects who were AAA+.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology and immunogenicity of adalimumab have been well characterized in healthy 
adult subjects as well as in adult subjects with RA, PsA, AS, CD and Ps. Assay methods for serum 
adalimumab and AAA were modified for Study M10-444. The modified analysis methods are considered 
adequately validated. Thirty-two subjects were enrolled in this study and fifteen of them provided 
serum samples for PK analysis. The age and weight ranges in subjects included in the PK analysis of 
study M10-444 were 2.0-4.2 years and 11.0-16.0 kg, respectively. The weight range appears to 
reasonably well cover the normal weight range for this age group. The mean serum adalimumab 
trough concentrations achieved a steady-state of approximately 6 to 8 μg/mL at Week 12 and Week 24 
in subjects treated with adalimumab 24 mg/m2 BSA eow dosing. The mean serum adalimumab 
concentrations at steady-state were observed to be higher in subjects who received concomitant MTX 
compared to the non-MTX stratum. However, due to the small number of subjects and large variability 
in the MTX arm as well as uncontrolled MTX use in those subjects, no firm conclusions can be made 
based on these data. 
The PK of adalimumab in Study M10-444 was compared to a previous study (Study DE038) in children 
(4 to 17 years of age) with JIA. Based on a between-study comparison no differences was observed in 
mean steady state serum adalimumab concentrations between children 4-17 years (Week 16) and 
children 2-4 years old (Week 24) after a dose of 24 mg/m2 eow. Adalimumab serum concentrations in 
the MTX stratum tended to be higher than the non-MTX group, which is consistent for both studies 
(Study DE038 and Study M10-444). 
As the number of children was limited in both studies, plots showing individual plasma concentration 
data vs. age and body surface area, respectively, were provided by the MAH at the request of the 
CHMP in order to confirm the suitability of the dose throughout the BSA range. Comparisons of 
individual trough serum adalimumab concentrations over the body weight (kg) and body surface area 
(BSA) (m2) were provided for Study DE038 and Study M10-444. Adalimumab exposure based on 24 
mg/m2 dosing in paediatric JIA subjects (up to a maximum dose of 40 mg and 20 mg eow in Study 
DE038 and Study M10-444, respectively) was similar between the 2 studies. 
Based on this data the CHMP concluded that there are no trends suggesting different serum 
concentrations over the studied weight and BSA ranges at administration of the BSA-adjusted dose  
(24 mg/m2 eow). Thus, although the data in this age group is limited, pharmacokinetics can be 
considered supportive of using the same dose to the smaller children as that previously approved for 
children from 4 years. 
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, based on the PK findings, the mean steady-state adalimumab concentrations appear to be 
similar in JIA subjects in Study M10-444 (2 to <4 years of age and subjects 4 years of age and above 
who weighed <15 kg) versus JIA subjects in Study DE038 (4 to 17 years of age) over the studied 
weight and BSA ranges at administration of the BSA-adjusted dose (24 mg/m2 eow). Thus, 
pharmacokinetics can be considered supportive of using the same dose to the smaller children as that 
previously approved for children from 4 years.

Methods 
This was an open-label (OL) multicenter study for subjects 2 to <4 years and subjects ≥ 4 years and 
weighing <15 kg diagnosed with moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA or polyarticular course 
JIA, per International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) criteria, treated in a clinical 
setting with adalimumab. 
All subjects had a screening visit, baseline visit and visits at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24. Visits 
beyond Week 24 occurred every 12 weeks for those subjects who continued in the study. Serum 
samples were collected for PK analyses (including AAA analysis). 
At the completion of 24 weeks in the United States, subjects could continue in the study until reaching 
the age of 4 and ≥15 kg. At the completion of 24 weeks in the European Union (EU), subjects could 
continue for a maximum of 1 year after reaching age 4 and ≥15 kg (to allow transition to an 
appropriate treatment). 
•  Study participants 
The main enrollment eligibility criteria required that subjects be 2 to <4 years of age, or ≥4 and 
weighing <15 kg and have a disease diagnosis of moderately to severely active (defined as arthritis 
affecting ≥ 5 joints at the time of treatment initiation) of polyarticular JIA or polyarticular course JIA. 
This corresponded to the ILAR categories of polyarticular RF+ disease, polyarticular RF– disease and 
extended oligoarthritis disease. For subjects in the EU, subject must have previously failed, had an 
insufficient response to, or been intolerant to ≥ 1 disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD). 
Major exclusion criteria included prior exposure to any other biologic therapy and infection requiring 
treatment with intravenous anti-infectives within 30 days prior to Baseline visit or oral anti-infectives 
within 14 days prior to the Baseline visit. 
Major exclusion criteria included: 
•  Subject had prior exposure to natalizumab, efalizumab or any other biologic therapy, such as 
abatacept. Any previous use of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents, including etanercept, 
infliximab, certolizumab pegol, golimumab and adalimumab was also prohibited. 
•  Infection(s) requiring treatment with intravenous anti-infectives within 30 days prior to Baseline 
visit or oral anti-infectives within 14 days prior to the Baseline visit. 
•  Subject had undergone joint surgery within the 2 months preceding the Screening visit (at joints to 
be assessed within the study). 
•  Subject had a previous diagnosis of a condition that could cause arthritis other than polyarticular 
JIA. 
•  Subject had a history of an allergic reaction or significant sensitivity to constituents of the 
adalimumab. 
•  Subject had been treated with any investigational drug of chemical or biologic nature (e.g. 
anakinra or rituximab) within a minimum of 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever was longer) of the 
drug prior to Baseline visit. If these biologics were approved, they would continue to be excluded. 
•  Subject had a poorly controlled medical condition, such as uncontrolled diabetes, unstable heart 
disease, recent cerebrovascular accident (CVA), seizure disorder and any other condition which, in 
the opinion of the Investigator, would put the subject at risk by participation in the study.

•  Subject had a history of clinically significant hematologic disorder (e.g. severe anemia, leukopenia, 
thrombocytopenia, clotting), renal or liver disease (e.g. fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatitis), or active 
gastroenteric ulcer. 
•  Subject had history of moderate to severe congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association 
class III or IV), recent CVA or thrombotic event and any other condition which, in the opinion of 
the Investigator, would have put the subject at risk by participation in the protocol. 
•  Evidence of dysplasia or history of malignancy (including lymphoma or leukemia). 
•  History of demyelinating disease (including myletis) or neurologic symptoms suggestive of central 
nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disease. 
•  History of invasive fungal infection (e.g. listeriosis, histoplasmosis), active viral disorders, human 
immunodeficiency virus infection. 
•  Treatments 
Adalimumab was administered SC by parent or designee eow at approximately the same time of day. 
The recommended dose of adalimumab for subjects with polyarticular JIA, aged 2 to 4 years old and 
those aged 4 and above weighing <15 kg, is 24 mg/m2 BSA up to a total dose of 20 mg adalimumab 
administered eow as a single dose via SC injection. The volume for injection was based on the 
subject's height and weight as outlined in Table 5. 
Table 5 
Adalimumab total body dose in milliliters (mL) of 50 mg/mL injectable 
solution (for all subjects) 
Baseline measurements of the subject's height and weight were used to determine the subject's dose 
of adalimumab. At the Week 12 visit, another determination of the subject's height and weight was 
made to determine the subject's dose of adalimumab. If a dose adjustment was required, it was done 
at each of the scheduled study visits, i.e. Week 12, Week 24 and every 12 weeks thereafter until the 
subjects reached age 4 and ≥15 kg. In the event that a subject fell in the middle of 2 ranges, the 
higher of the 2 dose volumes was to be utilized in order to ensure an efficacious dose. For example, if 
body weight was 14 kg and height was 81 cm, dose volume was 0.3 mL.

Study design schematic 
* Subjects were treated for 24 weeks regardless of age or weight. In the US, at the completion of 24 weeks subjects could continue 
in the study until reaching the age of 4 and ≥ 15 kg. In the EU at the completion of 24 weeks, subjects could continue for a 
maximum of 1 year after reaching age 4 and ≥ 15 kg (to allow transition to an appropriate treatment). 
•  Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of adalimumab in subjects 2 to <4 years 
of age and subjects age 4 and above weighing <15 kg with moderately to severely active polyarticular 
JIA or polyarticular course JIA. The secondary objectives of this study were to collect PK data and to 
evaluate the effectiveness of adalimumab in these subjects. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary study endpoint, measured over the course of the study, was the incidence of SAEs and 
AEs in polyarticular JIA subjects 2 to <4 years old and subjects ≥4 years weighing < 15 kg. 
Secondary endpoints, measured over the course of study, included collection of PK data, change from 
Baseline in laboratory findings, the individual indicators of effectiveness and the proportion of subjects 
with Pediatric American College of Rheumatology (PedACR)30/50/70/90 responses. 
PedACR 30/50/70/90 responses are defined as follows: ≥30/50/70/90% improvement in ≥ 3 of the 6 
JIA core set variables and ≥ 30% worsening in not more than 1 of the 6 JIA core set criteria. The 6 JIA 
criteria are: 
- 
- 
PGA of subject's disease activity (100 mm VAS) 
Parent's global assessment of subject's disease activity (100 mm VAS) 
-  Number of active joints (joints with swelling not due to deformity or joints with limitation of 
passive motion (LOM) and with pain on passive motion (POM), tenderness or both) 
-  Number of joints with LOM 
-  DICHAQ 
-  CRP 
Information to evaluate the effectiveness of adalimumab was collected from the subject's parent and 
from the study physician. Effectiveness data were collected with clinical assessments, beginning with 
the baseline visit (physical function of the Disability Index of Childhood Health Assessment 
Questionnaire [DICHAQ], Parent's Global Assessment of Subject's Overall Disease Activity, Parent's 
assessment of pain, Physician's Global Assessment [PGA] of disease activity, joint assessments, C-
reactive protein [CRP] and the Child's Health Questionnaire [CHQ-PF50].

•  Sample size 
The proposed sample size for this study was approximately 30 subjects. Due to the low incidence and 
prevalence of JIA in subjects 2 to <4 years old, the size of the study was chosen based on expected 
availability of eligible subjects to be enrolled in a 3-year time frame. 
•  Randomisation 
All subjects received adalimumab. Subjects were assigned a subject number. The subject number was 
used for identification throughout the study. 
•  Blinding (masking) 
This was an OL study; blinding was not performed. 
•  Statistical methods 
The primary and secondary variables (including both safety and effectiveness) were to be analyzed for 
the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, defined as all subjects who were enrolled and received ≥1 dose of 
adalimumab. 
No statistical analysis has been performed to report the results of the efficacy and safety of this study. 
Descriptive statistics has been provided. These include the number of observations, mean, standard 
deviation, median, minimum and maximum for continuous variables and counts and percentages for 
discrete variables. To account for missing data, NRI and LOCF imputation approach have been used up 
to Week 24. NRI and LOCF approach have not been used for data beyond Week 24 as it may not be 
appropriate for imputing long term efficacy data, as some subject may reach the age/weight criteria to 
complete the study sooner than some other subjects. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were summarized. The number of observations, mean, 
standard deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum were summarized for continuous variables; 
discrete variables were to be summarized via counts and percentages. 
The following demographic and Baseline characteristics were summarized: age, sex, race/ethnicity, 
duration of JIA, severity of JIA (as measured by Physician and Parent Global Assessments, CHQ-PF50, 
DICHAQ), onset type JIA (oligoarticular, polyarticular, or systemic) body weight and height (including 
parent's height), prior therapies for JIA, concomitant JIA medications, co-morbid conditions and 
adalimumab dosage and exposure duration. 
The number and percentage of subjects who discontinued from treatment were summarized, overall 
and by reason for discontinuation. Duration of treatment was to be summarized. Medical history was 
presented by count and percentage of subjects broken down by body system and diagnosis.

Prior medications are shown in Table 9. Most subjects had previously taken MTX to treat their JIA, with 
fewer subjects reporting prior use of corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs). A majority of subjects (29 subjects, 90.6%) had received a non-RA medication prior to 
enrolment into the study. The most frequently reported prior medications (≥4 subjects) were standard 
childhood vaccines including the Hepatitis B vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine, as well as folic acid 
and paracetamol.

Concomitant medications 
During the study, most subjects used concomitant MTX to treat their JIA, with fewer reporting use of 
corticosteroids or NSAIDs. Other than adalimumab study drug, no other biologic was used during this 
study, consistent with the protocol requirements. A majority of subjects (30 subjects, 93.8%) took a 
non-JIA medication during the study. The most frequently reported concomitant medications (≥4 
subjects) were standard childhood vaccines, folic acid, paracetamol and amoxicillin.

•  Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Endpoints 
The primary objective of this study was assessment of safety. No primary efficacy endpoint was 
defined. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Efficacy endpoints, measured over the course of study, included the individual indicators of 
effectiveness and the proportion of subjects with Paediatric American College of Rheumatology 
(PedACR)30/50/70/90 responses. 
PedACR Response 
At Week 12 and Week 24, PedACR30 response was achieved by 93.5% and 90.0% of subjects, 
respectively, using the analysis of observed data. The proportions of subjects with PedACR50/70/90 at 
Week 12 and Week 24 were 90.3%/61.3%/38.7% and 83.3%/73.3%/36.7%, respectively. Results 
were similar for the last observation carried forward (LOCF) analysis and slightly lower for the non-
responder imputation analysis (NRI) analysis. 
Observed data past Week 24 demonstrate that the majority of subjects at these study visits had a 
PedACR30/50/70 response and many had a PedACR90 response; however, the numbers of subjects 
with data from Week 60 onward were small as not all subjects have had the opportunity to complete 
through Week 60 and the study is still ongoing.

number of subjects for either observed or imputed methods. 
Because the PedACR response requires improvement in a minimum of 3 of 6 of the JIA core set 
variables and worsening in not more than 1 of the 6 JIA core set variables, it is important to examine 
each of the core set variables individually. Each of the JIA core set variables demonstrated clinically 
meaningful reductions in disease activity at both Weeks 12 and 24 (Table 12). Specifically, joint 
swelling, pain and tenderness were reduced and limitation of motion was decreased after adalimumab 
treatment.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The MAH submitted this variation to extend the indication of adalimumab to a target population of 
patients 2 to 4 years old, with a disease diagnosis of moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA or 
polyarticular course JIA that have previously failed, had an insufficient response to, or been intolerant 
to ≥1 DMARD. To support the application a single, still ongoing, multicenter open label study across 5 
countries has been conducted: study M010-444. The study provides data from patients treated with 
adalimumab 24 mg/m2 (BSA) up to a total dose of 20 mg eow, through Week 24 and subsequent data 
for any subjects who had continued past 24 Week. The study had a primary objective of safety, and PK 
and efficacy outcomes (mainly PedACR responses) were secondary objectives.  
A total 32 subjects were enrolled in the study (four of the subjects were 4 years or older, but weighed 
<15 kg, in line with the inclusion criteria). This number is limited but considering the rarity of the 
disease and data already available for older age categories, the sample size of this study is considered 
agreeable. Another limitation of the study design is the lack of a control arm. However, considering the 
age-range from 2 to 4 years and the difficulties in carrying out a randomised controlled trial due to the 
rarity of the disease, the choice of an open label study as the pivotal study for this application is 
considered acceptable. 
The onset types, per ILAR criteria, for the subjects enrolled in Study M10-444 were presented along 
with sex and anti-nuclear antibody+ (ANA) status. The majority of subjects (65.6%) had polyarticular 
arthritis (20 were RF- and 1 was RF+) followed by 25.0% of subjects with extended oligoarthritis. 
Furthermore, 2 subjects with systemic arthritis and 1 subject with undifferentiated arthritis were 
enrolled. Mean AJC at baseline was 9.8 joints (range 1 to 36). Out of the 32 subject enrolled, 3 did not 
meet this the inclusion criterion #2 requiring that subjects have a diagnosis of moderately to severely 
active polyarticular or polyarticular-course JIA defined as ≥5 joints affected with arthritis at the time of 
treatment initiation per ILAR criteria. This criterion was binding; however, the enrollment of these 
subjects did not negatively impact the integrity of the study data. During the procedure the MAH 
clarified that protocol inclusion criterion #8 required that subjects in the EU have previously failed, 
have had an insufficient response, or have been intolerant to ≥1 DMARD. All subjects enrolled in the 
EU have met this criterion. The 7 subjects who did not meet this criterion were subjects from the US, 
where prior DMARD treatment is not required. The MAH also clarified that dose changes for 
concomitant corticosteroid treatment were not specified in the protocol. This was acknowledged by the 
CHMP due to the compassionate nature of this study. 
Subjects were followed for at least 24 months, thereafter subjects could continue until they reached 
age 4 and >15 kg in the Americas. EU subjects could continue in the study for up to one year 
thereafter. One subject discontinued the study before Week 24.   
Efficacy data and additional analyses  
The results presented clearly support a positive effect of adalimumab treatment in the sought 
indication. In terms of PedACR, the majority of subjects achieved PedACR30 (93.5%) and PedACR50 
response (90.3%) by Week 12 and maintained response at Week 24; PedACR30 (90.0%) and 
PedACR50 response (83.3%). Furthermore, more than half of all subjects (61.3%) achieved PedACR70 
at Week 12 and almost three-quarters of all subjects achieved a PedACR70 response by Week 24 
(73.3%). Results were similar for the LOCF analysis and slightly lower for the NRI analysis. Each of the 
JIA core set variables demonstrated clinically meaningful reductions in disease activity at both Weeks 
12 and 24. The CHQ-PF50 showed also improvements.

A longer term efficacy data could have provided a clearer estimate of the treatment effect, considering 
also the open label setting. However; taking into account the efficacy data gathered in the age 
category 4-12 years old and the positive PK results showing similar PK profiles of adalimumab in 
children from 2 to 4 years and in children above 4 years, an extrapolation of efficacy to the younger 
cohort of patients is considered possible and this reinforces the results of the pivotal trial. Overall, the 
efficacy data from this study is considered sufficient to demonstrate the effect of adalimumab in the 2-
4 years old JIA population.  
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The MAH submitted a single, open label study (M10-444), with a primary objective of safety, and PK 
and efficacy outcomes (mainly PedACR responses) as secondary objectives, to support the extension of 
indication of adalimumab in the paediatric population aged 2-4 years with active polyarticular course 
JIA that have had an inadequate response, or have been intolerant to at least 1 DMARD. The study 
package is considered acceptable acknowledging the particular setting. Results from study M10-444, 
showed efficacy of adalimumab in the paediatric population 2-4 years of age based on PedACR 
response as well as clinically meaningful reductions in disease activity measured with the JIA core set 
variables. Furthermore, given the availability of efficacy data gathered in the age category 4-12 years 
old and the positive PK results showing similar PK profiles of adalimumab in children from 2 to 4 years 
of age and in children above 4 years of age, extrapolation of efficacy to the younger cohort of patients 
is considered possible; this reinforces the results of the pivotal trial.  
In conclusion, bearing in mind the results obtained in the previous study in older paediatric patients, 
the data provided by the MAH in this application are considered sufficient to demonstrate the efficacy 
of adalimumab in the target population aged from 2 to 4 years with active polyarticular course JIA that 
have had an inadequate response, or have been intolerant to at least 1 DMARD. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The primary study endpoint, measured over the course of the study, was the incidence of serious 
adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events (AEs) in polyarticular JIA subjects age 2 to <4 years old 
and subjects age ≥4 years weighing <15 kg. Secondary endpoints included collection of PK data and 
the change from baseline in laboratory findings. PK blood draws were obtained only from those who 
consented to this procedure. Safety analyses were to be carried out using the ITT population, defined 
as all subjects who were enrolled and received ≥ 1 dose of adalimumab. Treatment-emergent AEs 
(TEAEs) were defined as AEs that began either on or after the first dose of the adalimumab and up to 
within 70 days after the last dose of adalimumab if subjects terminated the study. 
Because the mechanism of action of TNF antagonists, including adalimumab, is inhibition of an 
immunologically active cytokine, episodes of infections, malignancies, central nervous system (CNS) 
demyelinating disease, immunologic reactions and lupus-like illness were specifically evaluated as AEs 
of special interest. Congestive heart failure (CHF) has also been an event specifically examined in 
studies with TNF antagonists and was also evaluated as an AE of special interest. 
For selected parameters, a listing of all subjects with any laboratory determination meeting Common 
Toxicity Criteria (CTC) of Grade 3 or higher were provided. Shift tables for changes from Baseline 
according to the normal range were provided for laboratory variables.

•  Patient exposure 
A total of 32 subjects were enrolled and all subjects received ≥1 dose of adalimumab (ITT population). 
Mean exposure to adalimumab was 299.1 days (SD = 129.84; median = 266.0). All subjects received 
at least 57 days of adalimumab treatment, with a maximum exposure to adalimumab of 679 days at 
the time of the interim database lock (09 September 2011). During the procedure the MAH provided 
further exposure data (data cut-off 24 May 2012) up to Week 60 (see discussion on clinical safety).

Most subjects (84.4%) reported ≥1 TEAE. Most TEAEs were considered by the investigator to be not 
related or probably not related to adalimumab. TEAEs considered by the investigator as possibly or 
probably related to adalimumab occurred in 8 subjects (25.0%). Five subjects had possibly related 
events (1 case each of ear infection, laryngitis, pneumonia, viral pharyngitis, and upper respiratory 
tract congestion [2 events in 1 subject], and pyrexia [2 subjects]). Four subjects had probably related 
events (1 case each of injection site reaction, injection site pain, cystitis and rash); 1 of these subjects 
also had a TEAE (rash) considered possibly related to adalimumab. None of the at least possibly 
related TEAEs experienced by these subjects were severe. 
Most subjects experienced TEAEs that were mild to moderate in severity; 4 subjects experienced a 
severe TEAE (1 case each of uveitis, otitis media, diabetes mellitus and arthritis). All of these events 
were considered by the Investigator as not related or probably not related to adalimumab. One subject, 
who had a severe TEAE of diabetes mellitus, did not have a history of diabetes, but had a family 
history of type 2 diabetes. This event was considered serious because it required hospitalization; the 
event was considered by the investigator as probably not related to study drug.

•  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Five subjects (15.6%) reported a serious TEAE. All of the serious events were considered not related or 
probably not related to adalimumab by the investigator. All were mild or moderate in severity with the 
exception of diabetes mellitus, which was severe. No subjects prematurely discontinued from the study 
due to a serious TEAE.

a.  Due to young age, the patient's dental care required general anesthesia to be safely administered in the hospital. 
No death occurred through the cutoff date (09 September 2011) in Study M10-444. 
AEs of special interest, including episodes of infections, malignancies, CNS demyelinating disease, 
immunologic reactions, lupus-like illness and CHF, were specifically evaluated because the mechanism 
of action of TNF antagonists. The only reports of TEAEs of special interest were infections (serious and 
nonserious) and injection site-related TEAEs. 
Infections 
Treatment-emergent infections occurred in 22 subjects (68.8%). Of the most frequently reported 
infections (≥5% of subjects), nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis and 
gastroenteritis were reported by the most subjects. Most infections were mild or moderate in severity; 
1 subject had a severe event (otitis media). All subjects who had an infection had events that were 
considered by the Investigator as not related or probably not related to study drug with the exception 
of 3 subjects. These 3 subjects had events that were considered to be possibly or probably related by 
the investigator (cystitis, ear infection, laryngitis, pneumonia, viral pharyngitis [possibly related]). 
Three subjects had infections that were serious (1 case each of dental caries, gastroenteritis rotavirus 
and varicella). All were considered not related to adalimumab by the investigator and were mild or 
moderate in severity. 
Through the cutoff date (09 September 2011) no subject prematurely discontinued from the study as a 
result of an infection.

Injection site reaction-related TEAEs 
Treatment-emergent injection site reaction-related events occurred in 2 subjects (1 case each of 
injection site pain and injection site reaction). Both events were mild in severity. Both subjects saw 
resolution of their events and continued in the study. 
•  Laboratory findings 
Clinical laboratory evaluations 
Hematology and clinical chemistry parameters generally showed clinically non-significant changes from 
Baseline and Week 12 and Week 24. 
Hematology parameters that showed both shifts from high or normal to low and from low or normal to 
high for individual subjects at the last available evaluation included hemoglobin, hematocrit, 
neutrophils and eosinophils. Hematology parameters that showed shifts from low or normal to high for 
individual subjects included lymphocytes (13 of 22 subjects), platelets (5 of 18 subjects), monocytes 
(2 of 30 subjects) and white blood cell counts (2 of 30 subjects).  
Clinical chemistry parameters that showed shifts from low or normal to high for >1 subject included 
calcium (5 of 26 subjects), glucose (5 of 29 subjects), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (2 of 28 
subjects), cholesterol (2 of 15 subjects), CRP (2 of 18 subjects) and triglycerides (2 of 30 subjects). 
In total, 4 subjects had potentially clinically significant laboratory abnormalities: 
•  One subject had a hematology value of CTC grade ≥3 prior to study drug administration. This 
subject had normal values during treatment on Day 85 and Day 169  
•  One subject had a serum glucose value of CTC grade ≥3 during treatment. An AE of diabetes 
mellitus was reported on Day 272; this event was considered by the investigator to be probably 
not related to adalimumab and severe in intensity. 
• 
Two subjects, both of whom received MTX during the study, had liver function test values that 
were considered potentially clinically significant. One was a case of elevated AST and ALT before 
drug administration; both values normalized during treatment. The other case had a transient ALT 
and AST elevation on day 252, ALT normalized at the following visit, AST slightly elevated but 
declined. Bilirubin and ALP were normal. 
•  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No subjects prematurely discontinued from the study due to a TEAE. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety analyses were carried out using the ITT population, defined as all subjects who were enrolled 
and received ≥1 dose of ADA. Treatment-emergent AEs, SAEs and AEs were reported. Infections, 
malignancies, central nervous system demyelinating disease, immunologic reactions and lupus-like 
illness were specifically evaluated as AEs of special interest. Pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, upper 
respiratory tract infection and cough were reported as TEAEs in more than 5% of patients. During the 
first 24 weeks, infections (serious and non serious) and injection site-related TEAEs were the only 
reports of TEAEs of special interest. Infections are of a special concern in this population of small 
children. Infections were generally considered by the investigator as not related or probably not related 
to study drug with the exception of few cases. Three subjects had infections classified as serious 
(dental caries, gastroenteritis rotavirus, varicella), considered not related to adalimumab by the 
Humira 
Assessment report  
EMA/76107/2013 
Page 27/33 
 
 
investigator, mild or moderate in severity. No subject prematurely discontinued from the study as a 
result of an infection and no death was reported through the cutoff date of the interim report. Injection 
related AEs occurred in 2 patients and were mild and transient. Five subjects experienced an SAE. Of 
the 5 SAEs, all were mild or moderate in severity. One was diabetes mellitus, 2 virus infections, 1 
worsening of studied disease and 1 dental caries, which needed general anesthesia. No subjects 
prematurely discontinued from the study due to a serious TEAE. Clinical laboratory evaluations were 
performed and 4 subjects had potentially clinically significant laboratory abnormalities, none of which 
raise a new safety concern. Amongst the laboratory abnormalities there were 5 cases of increased 
calcium presented. The MAH clarified that the severity was in all cases mild and provided 
corresponding data from the study DE038. Data showed that there does not seem to be a higher 
frequency of hypercalcemia in children 2-4 y in association with adalimumab, than in older children. 
There are no biologic mechanisms known that would raise the suspicion that adalimumab was the 
cause, thus this finding is not considered to be a safety issue related to adalimumab. 
Although the safety profile of adalimumab presented at Week 24 is considered acceptable and in line 
with the known safety profile in the paediatric older age category, the short follow up period (24 
weeks) and limited patient number (30 patients) were raised by the CHMP. In response to this point 
the MAH provided an interim safety analysis (data cut-off 24 May 2012) up to Week 60 for Study M10-
444. With this update the mean exposure to adalimumab increased to 428.1 days (about 60 weeks) 
and the median exposure was 426.0 days. A majority of subjects (21/32; 65.6%) had ≥391 days 
(more than 1 year) of exposure to adalimumab during the study and 9 out of 32 (28%) reached at 
least 18 months of exposure. The longest observation for subjects with JIA, who entered the study 
between 2 and 4 y, is 679 days. A comparison of adalimumab safety profile up to week 24 and week 
60 has been reported on ITT population. Comparative safety data showed an overall similar safety 
profile with an acceptable and expected increase in TEAEs. As expected with a longer duration on-
study there was a very slight increase in the number of subjects who reported TEAEs up to Week 60; 
however, the exposure-adjusted rate of TEAEs was comparable between Week 24 and Week 60. No 
SAE or death was reported. In the timeframe 24-60 weeks, one subject experienced a TEAE, namely 
JIA flare, leading to discontinuation of study drug. This TEAE should account for a lack of efficacy. A 
slight increase in upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngitis, rhinorrhea, rhinitis, otitis media, 
bronchitis and cough was detected. This trend is expected considering the increased exposure to study 
drug. Among TEAEs reported at week 60 are 4 TEAEs (no cases where reported at week 24) classified 
as rheumatoid arthritis preferred term. These cases should be considered as JIA flares and thus 
considered as lack of efficacy cases. Overall, results up to week 60 on TEAEs were similar to those up 
to week 24. Most of TEAEs up to 60 week were mild or moderate in severity. When severe TEAEs are 
considered, one additional case at week 60 was reported (rheumatoid arthritis) when compared to 
those reported up to week 24 (4 cases: uveitis, otitis media, diabetes mellitus and arthritis).  
Furthermore, the MAH provided comparison between the safety results from Study DE038 and Study 
M10-444 in order to strengthen the results of Study M10-444. Overall, the safety results from Study 
M10-444 were similar to those observed in Study DE038 (pivotal clinical study supporting the 
application for JIA 4-17 years) and demonstrated that adalimumab is generally well-tolerated in 
children with JIA. The comparison of safety data from study M10-444 (32 patients aged from 2 to 4 
years) with those from study DE038 (171 patients >4 years old), showed a slight lower frequency of 
TEAEs in the 2-4 year of age category (any TEAE 91% vs 98%, SAEs 16% vs 27%, with the exception 
of the serious infection TEAEs that accounts respectively for 9% vs 6%). In summary, TEAEs observed 
in children 2 to <4 y were similar regarding type and frequency to TEAEs observed in children 4 to 
17 y. Additionally, no new and/or unexpected safety concerns were identified in children 2 to <4 y.

Taking into account these additional data, the safety data from study M10-444 up to week 60 are 
considered in line with the known safety profile of adalimumab in JIA. No new safety signal has been 
identified.  
To ensure further broadening of the knowledge about the safety profile, the CHMP required that a long-
term observation of adalimumab treatment in children within this age range should be performed. This 
is to monitor AEs of special interest as infections, CNS demyelinating disease, malignancies, lupus like 
syndrome and others through a registry recording data for at least 10 years of observation. The MAH 
addressed this request by including the relevant subset of patients 2 to 4 years in the JIA Registry 
already in place (study P10-262 as described in the RMP), extending the inclusion criteria and the 
timeframe of observations. Subjects from Studies M10-444 and DE038 have the option to roll over into 
the P10-262 registry. Since 01 June 2012, 11 patients rolled over from Study DE038 and 9 rolled over 
from Study M10-444. As per the current registry protocol, safety data collected through Year 5 focuses 
on the collection of AEs of special interest. Starting at Year 6, patients will be followed annually for 
SAEs, congestive heart failure, and malignancies through Year10. The protocol will be amended to 
collect the AEs of special interest throughout the 10-year observation period. The JIA registry will also 
bring information on treatment interruptions in this added children population as the registry 
effectiveness and safety variables are also collected during adalimumab treatment interruption. The 
impact of treatment interruptions (≥70 days) on safety and effectiveness will be evaluated for the next 
interim analysis. Patients being prescribed and treated with MTX per the local label will be considered a 
reference group. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Adalimumab was generally well tolerated during the study M10-444. The most common AEs were 
pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection and cough.The AE pattern in this study does 
not differ from the known safety profile of adalimumab in JIA patients. No new safety signal has been 
identified in the results presented. In the study M10-444, AEs of special interest for adalimumab have 
been monitored and no safety signal has been detected. The only reports of TEAEs of special interest 
were infections (serious and nonserious) and injections site related TEAES.  
Adalimumab has a well characterised safety profile in several authorised indications, including active 
polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, in children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years who have had 
an inadequate response to one or more DMARDs. Data submitted in this application confirm the known 
safety profile observed with the approved indication in the older paediatric population. Overall, the 
safety profile of adalimumab in the treatment of active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in 
children aged 2 to 4 years appears to be similar with the one known in polyarticular JIA in children and 
adolescent aged 4 to 17 years and in other approved indications. 
Further data will become available to further characterise the long term safety and effectiveness of 
adalimumab in the treatment of active polyarticular JIA, in children aged 2 to 4 years from the JIA 
registry P10-262. This includes safety data concerning episodic treatment in JIA. The next interim 
update is expected in August 2013 as detailed in the RMP.

information. 
Children of 2 to 4 y will be included in the ongoing JIA registry, Study P10-262 as described in the 
RMP. The protocol will be amended to collect the AEs of special interest throughout the 10-year 
observation period for these subjects. This will complement the safety experience gained from 
spontaneous post-marketing AE reporting for children ≥2 years of age on adalimumab.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Changes were also made to the PI to 
bring it in line with the current QRD template, which were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The submission is based on a single, open label multicenter study (M10-444) to support the extension 
of indication of adalimumab in the paediatric population aged 2-4 years with active polyarticular course 
JIA that have had an inadequate response, or have been intolerant to at least 1 DMARD. The studied 
dose was 24 mg/m2 BSA up to a total dose of 20 mg adalimumab administered eow as a single dose 
via SC injection. The currently approved dose for children 4-12 year is 24 mg/m2 body BSA up to a 
total dose of 40 mg adalimumab eow. Serum concentration data were available from 15 children. The 
mean serum trough concentrations in the new study were comparable with steady state concentrations 
seen in a previous study in children >4 years and weighing >15 kg (study DE038). Plots of individual 
plasma concentrations from the two studies vs. weight and body surface area, respectively, stratified 
for MTX treatment indicated no trend in data and the individual serum concentrations appear to be 
similarly distributed over the studied weight and BSA ranges at administration of the BSA-adjusted 
dose (24 mg/m2 eow). Thus, although the pharmacokinetic data in this age group 2 to <4 years is 
limited, pharmacokinetic data are considered supportive of using the same dose to the smaller children 
as that previously approved for children from 4 years. 
Results from study M10-444 showed efficacy of adalimumab in the paediatric population of the claimed 
indication: at Week 12 and Week 24, PedACR30 response was achieved by 93.5% and 90.0% of 
subjects, respectively. At Week 12 and Week 24, PedACR50 response was achieved by 90.3% and 
83.3% of subjects, respectively. Therefore; the majority of subjects achieved PedACR30 and PedACR50 
response by Week 12 and maintained response at Week 24. Furthermore, more than half of all 
subjects (61.3%) achieved PedACR70 at Week 12 and almost three-quarters of all subjects achieved a 
PedACR70 response by Week 24 (73.3%). Each of the JIA core set variables demonstrated clinically 
meaningful reductions in disease activity at both Weeks 12 and 24. Week 24 is the time point at which 
efficacy was demonstrated in the previous controlled study with adalimumab in children older than 4 
years of age. Furthermore, given the availability of efficacy data gathered in the age category 4-12 
years old (study DE038) and the positive PK results showing similar PK profiles of adalimumab in 
children from 2 to 4 years of age and in children above 4 years of age, extrapolation of efficacy to the 
younger cohort of patients is considered possible; this reinforces the results of the pivotal trial.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
To further characterise the long term effect treatment in the 2-4 years old this population will be 
included in the currently ongoing JIA registry P10-262 studying the 4-17 years population. This also 
includes data concerning episodic treatment in JIA. The impact of treatment interruptions (≥70 days) 
on safety and effectiveness will be evaluated for the next interim analysis (August 2013 as detailed in 
the RMP).

Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Adalimumab was generally well tolerated during the study M10-444. The most common AE was pyrexia, 
nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection and cough.The AE pattern in this study does not 
differ from the known safety profile of adalimumab. No new safety signal has been identified in the 
results presented. AEs of special interest for adalimumab have been monitored and no safety signal 
has been detected. All SAEs were mild or moderate in severity with the exception of diabetes mellitus, 
which was severe. Furthermore, the safety profile in this young age group appeared in line with the 
safety profile in older children based on comparison of data from studies M10-444 (2-4 years) and 
DE038 (4-17 years). Infections are of a special concern in this population of small children. It is 
important to note that through the cutoff date of the interim report, no subject prematurely 
discontinued from the study as a result of an infection. To further support the safety profile presented 
at Week 24 the MAH provided an updated interim safety analysis (data cut-off 24 May 2012) up to 
Week 60 for Study M10-444. Comparative safety data showed an overall similar safety profile with an 
exposure-adjusted rate of TEAEs comparable between Week 24 and Week 60. Comparison between the 
safety results from Study DE038 (pivotal clinical study supporting the application for JIA 4-17 years) 
and Study M10-444 showed that the safety results observed were similar between the 2 studies. 
Safety data up to week 60 are considered in line with the known safety profile of adalimumab in JIA. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Given the limited sample size and open label design of study M10-444 the CHMP required during the 
procedure that a long-term observation of adalimumab treatment in children below 4 years of age or 
<15 kg should be ensured through a registry recording data for at least 10 years of observation. This 
was agreed by the MAH by including the relevant subset of patients in the currently ongoing JIA 
registry: study P10-262 (as described in the RMP) by extending the inclusion criteria and the 
timeframe of observations. This registry will allow further characterisation of the long term safety of 
adalimumab treatment in children below 4 years of age; including safety data concerning episodic 
treatment. Interim data from the registry is provided on a yearly basis until August 2020. The next 
interim report is expected in August 2013 as detailed in the RMP.  
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Adalimumab has been used for treating paediatric patients with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis from 4 to 17 years. Uncontrolled disease may create longstanding and severe disability also in 
the very young children population below 4 years old. Results from study M10-444 showed that 
treatment with adalimumab dosed at 24 mg/m² body surface area up to a maximum single dose of 
20 mg conferred a clinical benefit to the patients. These data are considered valuable and of clinical 
relevance. 
The safety profile of adalimumab was adequately characterised and no new treatment-related AE or 
safety signal was identified from the data submitted. Safety data up to week 60 are considered in line 
with the known safety profile of adalimumab in JIA. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The efficacy results presented clearly support a positive effect of adalimumab treatment. The majority 
of subjects achieved PedACR30 (93.5%) and PedACR50 responses (90.3%) by Week 12 and 
Humira 
Assessment report

maintained these responses at Week 24 (≥83.3%). More than half of all subjects (61.3%) achieved a 
PedACR70 response at Week 12, and almost three-quarters of all subjects achieved a PedACR70 
response by Week 24 (73.3%). Data from ACR JIA core set variables demonstrated that adalimumab 
treatment was associated with reductions in joint swelling, pain, and tenderness, as well as in 
limitation of motion. 
The safety of adalimumab treatment has been well characterized in the adult RA and JIA population. 
Safety data obtained in this paediatric adalimumab trial (2-4 years) are consistent with prior paediatric 
JIA studies with patients aged 4 to 17 years. No new safety signal has been identified in the results 
presented. 
Updated safety data from the ongoing study up to week 60 are considered in line with the known 
safety profile of adalimumab in JIA. To further characterise the long term adalimumab effect, children 
aged 2-4 years will be included in the ongoing JIA registry Study P10-262, which will also provide 
information on the impact of treatment interruptions (≥70 days) on safety and effectiveness. 
In conclusion, based on the available efficacy and safety data presented, the benefit risk balance of 
adalimumab is considered positive for the treatment of active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, 
in children and adolescents aged 2 to 17 years who have had an inadequate response to one or more 
disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). 
4.  Recommendations 
The application for the extension of indication for the treatment of paediatric subjects with active 
polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) from 4 to 17 years of age to 2 to 17 years of age is 
approvable since the major objection and the other concerns have all been resolved. 
Final Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
C.1.6 a) 
Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of 
II 
an approved one 
Extension of indication for the treatment of paediatric subjects with active polyarticular juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis (JIA) from 4 to 17 years of age to 2 to 17 years of age. As a consequence of this 
new indication, sections 4.1, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package leaflet is 
updated in accordance. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the SmPC and Package Leaflet. 
Paediatric data 
The CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of study M10-444 subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan PIP P/63/2011 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of 
Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

Extension of indication to include first-line combination treatment with avelumab and axitinib in adult 
patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC) for Bavencio; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 
4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, 
section 4.2 of the SmPC is updated in order to introduce a switch of the avelumab dosing regimen from 10 
mg/kg every two weeks (weight-based) to a flat dose of 800 mg every two weeks, both for the newly 
proposed indication aRCC and the already existing indication of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). The MAH 
also took the opportunity to implement some editorial changes in the Product information. An updated 
RMP version 1.7 has been submitted, as well.  
The requested group of variations proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, 
Annex II, Labelling and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Bavencio was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/15/1590 on 14 December 2015. Bavencio 
was designated as an orphan medicinal product in the following indication: Treatment of Merkel cell 
carcinoma.  
The new indication, which is the subject of this application, does not fall within any orphan designation. 
According to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council on 
orphan medicinal products, it is not possible to combine an orphan indication and a non-orphan indication 
in the same marketing authorisation. Consequently, the MAH has committed to request the withdrawal of 
the orphan designation from the Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products within 2 days after the 
receipt of the CHMP opinion. Should the MAH not request the withdrawal of the orphan designation within 
the said deadline, nor request re-examination in accordance with Article 16(4) of Commission Regulation 
(EC) No. 1234/2008, the validation of this variation application becomes automatically null and void with 
retroactive effect.

847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication. 
Protocol assistance 
Protocol assistance has been obtained from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Committee for 
Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). The protocol assistance pertained to clinical aspects of the 
dossier regarding the design of Study B9991003.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
19 September 2019 
Avelumab (Bavencio) is a human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against 
programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), which is expressed by tumor cells, as well as by a number of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/550625/2019  
Page 7/105 
 
 
 
 
immune cell types. Avelumab binds to PD-L1 and blocks the interaction between PD-L1 and its receptors 
programmed death 1 (PD-1) and B7.1. This removes the suppressive effects of PD-L1 on anti-tumor 
CD8+ T-cells, resulting in the restoration of a cytotoxic T-cell response.  In vitro, avelumab is capable of 
stimulating antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against PD-L1 positive tumour cells.   
Avelumab is being developed jointly by Pfizer Inc. and Merck KGaA/EMD Serono; both companies are 
sponsoring clinical studies investigating the safety and efficacy of avelumab in the treatment of various 
tumour types.  Pfizer is the Sponsor of clinical investigations of avelumab in combination with axitinib in 
the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). 
Renal cell carcinoma, originating in the proximal convoluted tubule, comprises 90-95% of all kidney and 
renal pelvis cancers and amounts to approximately 3% of all malignant tumours in adults. Roughly only 
half of the patients are symptomatic at debut, the rest being chance imaging findings, which explains the 
high rate of advanced and metastatic disease at diagnosis (about 30% of presentations are mRCC). The 
clear-cell histology is present in over 90% of patients.   
The treatment of aRCC relies on patient allocation to a prognostic risk group (favourable, intermediate or 
poor) at diagnosis. Two models, the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and the Heng 
model (also known as IMDC, International Metastatic RCC database), are widely used.  
The MSKCC model was based on the results of clinical trials involving 463 patients with metastatic RCC 
who were treated with IFN-α. Multivariate analysis revealed that independent prognostic factors for a 
poor outcome included an interval from diagnosis to treatment of less than 1 year, a Karnofsky 
performance status (KPS) below 80 %, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels >1.5 times the upper 
limit of normal (ULN), corrected serum calcium levels above the ULN, and serum hemoglobin levels below 
the lower limit of normal. The MSKCC criteria were validated by an independent group at the Cleveland 
Clinic; the validation was based on data derived from 353 patients enrolled onto clinical trials involving 
immunotherapy. The Heng model (IMDC) based on findings in 645 patients with metastatic RCC (all of 
whom were naive to anti-VEGF therapy) who were treated with sunitinib, sorafenib, or bevacizumab plus 
IFN-α; this model validates components of the MSKCC model, but also includes platelet and neutrophil 
counts. Patients who score 0 are classified as favourable risk; 1-2 as intermediate risk; and 3-6 as poor 
risk. For the favourable risk group, the 2-year OS is approximately 75%, while for the poor-risk patients 
is only 7%. 
According to the 2019 ESMO guideline for the first-line treatment of clear cell renal carcinoma, in 
favourable-risk patients, sunitinib, pazopanib and bevacizumab plus interferon remain the standard of 
care. Tivozanib is another standard of care when available. In intermediate and poor risk patients, the 
combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab is the new standard of care, followed by cabozantinib, 
sunitinib, pazopanib, tivozanib and bevacizumab plus interferon. In poor-risk patients, nivolumab and 
ipilimumab is the new standard of care with cabozantinib sunitinib, pazopanib and temsirolimus that can 
be used. 
The currently applied indication for avelumab is: “Bavencio in combination with axitinib is indicated for 
the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC)”. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP.

2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Avelumab is a protein, which is expected to be metabolised in the body and biodegrade in the 
environment. Thus, according to the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal 
Products for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), avelumab is exempt from the submission of an 
Environmental Risk Assessment as the product and excipients do not expect to pose a significant risk to 
the environment.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The clinical pharmacology analyses in this application encompass two components:   
1. 
To support the dosing regimen in the aRCC population, clinical pharmacology analyses included 
avelumab and axitinib pharmacokinetic (PK) data as well as avelumab ADA data from the patients in the 
Phase 1b Study B9991002 and the pivotal Phase 3 Study B9991003.   
2. 
To support the flat dose justification in mMCC, pooled PK and safety data from three studies in 
patients with various tumour types were included in the analyses: Studies EMR100070-001, 
EMR100070-002 and EMR100070-003. Efficacy data for patients with mMCC (from Part A of study 
EMR100070-003) were also included to support the flat dose switch in mMCC.

Pharmacokinetic properties of avelumab 
A full characterisation of the avelumab PK properties was provided in the original market authorisation 
application (EMEA/H/C/4338). A summary of the avelumab PK characteristics is provided below. 
Absorption 
Bavencio is for intravenous infusion only. 
Distribution 
The volumes of the central and peripheral compartments, according to a population PK analysis, were 
2.84 L and 1.21 L in the typical subject, respectively. The geometric mean Vss (calculated from individual 
V1 and V2 parameter values) for a subject receiving 10 mg/kg was 4.72 L. 
Elimination 
Following IV administration of a 10 mg/kg dose the mean clearance determined by non-compartmental 
analysis was 0.36 mL/h/kg. The corresponding mean half-life was 95 h (~4 days). From a population PK 
analysis the estimated t½ was approximately 6 days in subjects receiving 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The dose-normalized Cmax and AUC0-336hr after first dose were approximately similar across 3 to 20 mg/kg. 
Ctrough increased proportionally with doses between 10 to 20 mg/kg, but more than proportionally for 
doses between 1 to 10 mg/kg. 
Pharmacokinetic analyses for the aRCC indication 
The clinical studies providing clinical pharmacology data for the aRCC indication are summarised in the 
table above (Table 1). 
Methods 
Bioanalytical methods 
The avelumab PK bioanalytical methods used to support this application for subjects with aRCC are 
identical to those in the original mMCC submission. 
Avelumab Anti-Drug Antibodies (Homogenous bridging assay)  
The new ADA method is a homogenous ECL assay, Pfizer Validation No. B9997001, Merck Serono study 
number 15-GR077-V0, Amendment 2, “The Validation of an ECL Assay for the Detection of Anti-Drug 
Antibodies against MSB0010718C (Anti-PD-L1) in Human Serum”.  This new assay is updated from the 
original assay due to a new vendor and assay optimization. In comparison to the previous step-wise 
bridging ADA assay, the new ADA assay is a homogenous bridging assay that possesses lower screening 
and confirmatory cut points and has better relative sensitivity. A comparison of the previous and new 
assay is depicted in table 2 below.  No samples from B9991002 and B9991003 were analyzed using the

Avelumab 
Pharmacokinetic analysis 
Summary statistics of avelumab Ctrough and Cmax were provided for individual studies B9991002, 
B9991003, and EMR100070-001. A population pharmacokinetic (popPK) analysis across studies was 
conducted to characterise the PK of avelumab in the aRCC population. The popPK analysis is further 
described below. 
Population PK analysis 
The popPK analysis of avelumab in combination with axitinib was based on the previous pooled popPK 
dataset and analysis of avelumab monotherapy in patients with solid tumours (Population 
pharmacokinetic evaluation of clinical trials EMR100070-001, EMR100070-002 and EMR100070-003 
(revised), previously submitted), using the base structural component of the monotherapy avelumab 
popPK model. The previous popPK model was a two-compartment linear model incorporating a 
time-dependent change in avelumab clearance (CL) and included pooled data from 1827 patients with 14 
different tumour types across 3 earlier clinical studies. The previous analysis dataset included 52 total 
patients with aRCC, with 32 treated in the first-line and 20 in the second-line setting. Visual predictive 
checks from the previously submitted avelumab popPK model, including time-dependent CL, is provided 
in Figure 1. Individual empirical Bayes estimates of avelumab PK parameters were generated for the 
treatment-naïve aRCC analysis population from this popPK model, and subsequently used for deriving 
both single-dose and steady-state exposure metrics of Ctrough, Cmax, and AUC.

state [Population pharmacokinetic evaluation of clinical trials EMR100070-001, 
EMR100070-002 and EMR100070-003 (revised)] 
Traditional covariate screening was not conducted, as covariate effects have been characterized in the 
general solid tumour population, although aRCC study specific covariate effects such as ADA and PD-L1 ≥ 
1% status (dichotomous, yes/no) were graphically explored to evaluate their potential influence on 
avelumab PK. However, the only covariate effects retained from the previous PK model were body weight 
on CL and V1. 
Model adequacy and goodness of fit plots were assessed including scatterplots of observed concentrations 
versus population and individual predicted concentration, and scatterplots of conditional weighted 
residuals versus population predictions and versus time after dose.  The characterization of avelumab 
popPK in treatment-naïve patients with aRCC receiving combination treatment of avelumab plus axitinib 
was performed using NONMEM version 7.3 (ICON Development Solutions, Dublin, Ireland), and 
post-processing was conducted using R version 3.4.1. 
Data handling 
Observations with conditional weighted residuals value exceeding 4 were permanently excluded from the 
analysis. The handling and extent of samples below limit of quantification is not reported. 
Data in aRCC patient population 
The analysis dataset for popPK analysis contained dosing, serum avelumab concentration information, 
and various demographic and treatment information for a total of 2315 patients receiving avelumab; 
1827 patients were from the avelumab monotherapy solid tumour popPK dataset and 488 patients were 
from current studies B9991002 (n=54) and B9991003 (Arm A) (n=434) in which avelumab was 
administered in combination with axitinib to patients with aRCC. In total there were 14,032 PK records 
with measurable avelumab concentration, 3,206 of which were from the aRCC analysis population treated 
in combination with axitinib. A summary of the demographic factors and laboratory values in the present 
dataset are presented in Table 3 and Table 4. A graph presenting observed avelumab concentrations in 
the aRCC analysis population is presented in Figure 2.

time-dependent clearance of avelumab, with fixed effect of baseline body weight on CL (baseline 
clearance), V1, V2 and Q, with estimation of the exponents on CL, V1 and V2. No other covariate effects 
were included in the model. Both additive and proportional residual error were included. IIV was 
incorporated as an exponential effect and was estimated as an OMEGA BLOCK on CL, V1 and V2; IIV was 
also estimated on Imax. Final parameter estimates, and goodness-of-fit diagnostics are presented in

Simulations for flat-dose justification 
Previously reported population PK models (EMEA/H/C/4338), PK CYCLE (based on first cycle data only) 
and PK SS (based on data across all cycles), including all detected covariate relationships, were used to 
simulate exposures for weight-based dosing and flat dosing regimens. Various PK exposure metrics, e.g. 
maximum serum concentrations (Cmax), minimum serum concentrations (Cmin), area under the serum 
concentration-time curve (AUC) after single dose and at steady state, were simulated for both dosing 
scenarios and summarized across the entire weight range and by quartiles of weight. 
Population PK models used in the simulations are based on PK data collected from 1827 subjects where 
the median weight was 70.6 kg (range: 30.4 – 204 kg) (see Figure 5). To account for model and 
parameter uncertainty, two hundred sets of population parameters were sampled from a multivariate 
normal (MVN) distribution with mean sets to final vector of population parameter estimate and 
variance-covariance matrix estimated from the final respective PK CYCLE and PK SS models. To account 
for between patient variability, for each of the 200 sampled population parameters, 500 sets of 
inter-subject’s variability parameters were sampled from multivariate normal (MVN) distribution of 
individual random effects with mean zero (0) and variance-covariance matrix measuring interindividual 
variability, resulting in 100,000 sets of random effect parameter. One hundred thousand simulated 
subjects were then resampled from the n=1827 PK data set, with all covariates present in the final model 
retained at the subject level, except for tumour type mMCC, which was randomly assigned to 50,000 
subjects out of the 100,000 simulated subjects. Set of covariates were then randomly assigned to one of 
the 100,000 individual random effect. The last step consisted in computing the patient simulated 
parameter set using the corresponding resampled population parameter, the individual covariates and 
random effects according to the model. Thereafter, 5000 subjects were randomly sampled from the pool 
of 50,000 subjects with assigned tumour type mMCC and 5000 subjects were randomly sampled from the 
other simulated 50,000 subjects with solid tumours. 
For the PK CYCLE model, closed-form solution for a linear 2-compartment model was used to calculate 
AUCtau, Cmin and Cmax. For the PK SS model simulations were used to derive the same exposure metrics.

According to the population PK analysis total systemic CL for the treatment-naïve aRCC population was 
estimated to be 0.0269 L/h [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.0262-0.0275]. This value is comparable to 
the popPK analysis of solid tumours where the geometric mean of individual CL predictions, at 
steady-state, were 0.0266 L/h and 0.0202 L/h for the total population and mMCC, respectively. For the 
aRCC population, the decrease in avelumab clearance over time is 9.9% and is within the range 
previously characterized in solid tumour populations. For comparison, the estimated mean maximal 
reduction from baseline CL was 32% in the mMCC population and 28% in the head and neck population.

In total, 14,299 avelumab serum concentrations were collected after the first dose of avelumab treatment 
and used in the NONMEM run for the aRCC popPK model (excluding records commented out for various 
reasons); of these 14,299 records, 505 (3.5%) were BLOQ. In accordance with the methodology 
implemented in the original popPK report for monotherapy, samples BLOQ were excluded from analysis 
by ignoring these data rows in the NONMEM control stream. A total of 44 PK records (0.3%, from 
monotherapy and aRCC studies) were deemed outliers (as defined by |CWRES| ≥ 4). These outliers were 
commented out with "COUT" in the NONMEM comment column and excluded from the final NONMEM run. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Effect of Avelumab on Axitinib Pharmacokinetics 
In Study B9991002, axitinib exposures were similar following co-administration of multiple oral doses of 
axitinib (5 mg BID) with multiple IV doses of avelumab (10 mg/kg Q2W; Cycle 4 Day 1) and following 
administration of axitinib alone (Lead-in Day 7).  Standard plasma PK parameters for axitinib were 
estimated using non-compartmental analysis.  For axitinib, PK parameters included: Cmax, time to first 
maximum plasma concentration (Tmax), AUCtau, terminal half-life (t1/2), oral plasma clearance (CL/F), 
and apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F).

The geometric mean ratios for axitinib dose-normalized AUClast, AUCtau, and Cmax ranged from 0.77 to 
0.91, with 90% CIs overlapping and including 1, indicating similar exposures following co-administration 
of avelumab with axitinib versus axitinib alone (Table 6).

and given in combination with axitinib as visualized in the graph below, where the ETA value represents

Immunogenicity 
Across the aRCC pooled population, the treatment-induced ADA incidence was 14.6%.  This incidence is 
higher in comparison to the avelumab monotherapy setting where the treatment-induced ADA was 
initially reported as 5.9% in a pooled population of patients with various solid tumours.  This increase in 
incidence is likely due to a new, more sensitive and drug tolerant assay that was employed for the 
analysis of ADA in the aRCC population.  No clinically meaningful impact of ADA on the PK or safety of 
avelumab was observed (see Figure 8).

The exposure-efficacy data were evaluated using time-to-event analyses where the available data was fit 
to a survival function. Covariates of interest, including exposure metrics, on survival were evaluated 
using univariate and multivariate analyses to determine the full and final model. The exposure metrics 
were derived using the aRCC population PK model. Covariates to be tested were: patient demographics, 
laboratory parameters, and disease-related values (including the aRCC-specific Heng and Memorial 
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center [MSKCC] prognostic factors). 
The final model included a log-normal baseline hazard function, avelumab exposure (Cmin), and Heng 
prognostic criteria. The final parameter estimates are described in the table 7 below.

aRCC: Exposure-Response Analysis for Safety 
The exposure-safety analyses used data from 488 treatment-naïve patients with aRCC treated with 10 
mg/kg IV avelumab Q2W in combination with axitinib in Studies B9991002 and B9991003. A summary of 
demographics and laboratory values  is presented in Table 3 and  Table 4. 
In the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) dataset for safety analyses, all AE grades were derived 
using the NCI CTCAE version 4.03 definitions, as reported in the clinical database. The binary safety 
endpoints ultimately evaluated were the following: 
• Treatment-emergent AEs of Grade ≥3 
• Treatment-emergent immune-related AEs (irAEs) of any grade 
• Infusion-related reactions (IRRs) of any grade 
For each type of adverse event, patients were classified as "AE" (experiencing the AE at least once during 
the reporting period of the study) or "non-AE" (not experiencing the AE). For exposure-safety analyses, 
exposure metrics were derived using the treatment-naive aRCC popPK model. Single-dose and 
steady-state exposure metrics were evaluated for a relationship with safety endpoints.  
A base model was developed for each of the safety endpoints using binomial logistic regression with a 
logit link function. The most significant avelumab exposure metric, as determined using the model 
deviance, was selected for incorporation into each respective base model. Covariates that were 
considered for the E-R analysis of safety included demographic characteristics, disease status and 
baseline laboratory values, baseline PD-L1 status, treatment duration, and immunogenicity status (ADA, 
ever positive). Potential collinearity among covariates was assessed, and if correlated, then only one of 
the covariates was tested. The characterization of avelumab E-R for safety was performed using R version 
3.4.1 and implementing the glm(family="binomial") functions in R. 
Treatment-emergent AEs of Grade ≥3 
In the final model for TEAEs Grade ≥3, the only significant factor was the avelumab exposure metric in 
the form of trough concentration after single dose (Ctrough, sd). While the probability of TEAEs Grade ≥3 
was associated in a negative direction with exposure, the relationship is shallow, and according to the 
applicant, is not considered meaningful. The final parameter estimates are described in Table 8 below.

Table 8 Exposure-response final model results (TEAEs Grade ≥3) 
Treatment-emergent irAEs of any grade 
The probability of irAEs was associated in a positive direction with maximum observed concentration after 
single dose (Cmax, sd). The final model also included the effect of race (categorical) and concomitant use of 
systemic corticosteroids. The final parameter estimates are presented in Table 9. As the White population 
represented > 75%, this is the reference group; Asian race was the second most common at 
approximately 15%. The remaining races had very low numbers of patients and thus were not statistically 
significantly different from the reference (White) group due to insufficient data.  As concomitant systemic 
corticosteroid use, although significantly associated with irAE, is confounded with the endpoint itself (ie, 
patients experiencing irAE may be treated with corticosteroids), this covariate was not interpreted 
further.

Infusion-related reactions of any grade  
The final model for any grade IRRs contained an effect of race (categorical) and baseline body weight, in 
addition to Ctrough, sd. The probability of IRRs was associated in a negative direction with exposure, and 
according to the applicant, is not considered meaningful. The final model parameters are presented in

patients with solid tumours with weight-based and flat-dosing regimens are shown below (Figure 12) in 
the form of boxplots for AUC at steady state (AUCtau, ss) and Ctrough at steady state (Ctrough, ss).  Overall, the

Q2W flat-dosing regimen.

model results in solid tumour monotherapy population as performed in flat-dosing report (Modeling and Simulation

Overlap in the distribution of exposures for all exposure metrics was observed in the treatment-naïve 
aRCC analysis population (studies B9991002 and B9991003) to the referenced scenarios of 1) simulated 
exposures in the avelumab clinical database for the 10 mg/kg IV Q2W dosing regimen, and 2) simulated 
exposures for the 800 mg IV Q2W flat-dosing regimen.  As similar exposures were observed between the 
800 mg IV Q2W flat-dosing regimen and the 10 mg/kg IV Q2W regimen in the treatment-naïve aRCC 
population and the mMCC and UC population, the collective information provides evidence that the 
proposed 800 mg Q2W flat-dosing regimen is expected to maintain the benefit-risk ratio for avelumab 
when used in combination with axitinib in treatment-naïve patients with aRCC.

To further support the flat-dose regimen, previously reported exposure-safety relationships 
(EMEA/H/C/4338) in the mMCC patient population were used to compare the two dosing regimens (flat 
and weight based) in relation to safety. The simulated exposures, with both dosing regimens, were used 
to drive the safety responses, and the outcomes were subsequently compared. 
The simulations show for the highest body weight quartile a decrease in the risk of irAEs with the flat 800 
mg dosing regimen as compared to the weight-based regimen. For subjects in the lowest body weight 
quartile, an increase in the mean probability of irAEs is apparent for the flat 800 mg dosing regimen 
versus the weight-based regimen (14.3% vs 10%, respectively). The probability of IRR does not change 
with exposure and, therefore, there is no difference in the probability of IRR for the two dosing regimens. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The avelumab PK bioanalytical methods used to support this application for subjects with aRCC are 
identical to those in the original mMCC submission. The new ADA ECL assay has been validated for the 
screening, confirmation, and titration of avelumab antibodies in human serum. Samples from studies 
B9991002 and B9991003 were analysed using the homogenous ECL assay. Given that avelumab is a 
human IgG monoclonal antibody, the homogenous bridging is endorsed and the higher selectivity is 
expected. The drug tolerance is accepted at Ctrough values (majority of Ctrough <100 µg/mL). 
The avelumab PK in aRCC was mainly evaluated through population PK. A previously submitted avelumab 
PK model (in the initial mMCC submission), based on several solid tumour indications, served as the basis 
of the popPK analysis in the aRCC population. This approach is accepted. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/550625/2019  
Page 33/105 
 
 
 
 
 
The results from the popPK analysis indicate that the avelumab PK in the aRCC population is similar to 
previously studied solid tumour patient populations. Furthermore, patient population specific covariates, 
ADA and PD-L1 status, does not seem to have a relevant effect on avelumab PK in the aRCC population. 
PK samples below limit of quantification were excluded from the analysis and this is acceptable since the 
number of samples excluded 505 (3.5%) is not considered to influence the model development. 
Furthermore, only 44 PK samples were identified as outliers and hence excluded from the analysis which 
is also acceptable. 
The observed time to PFS (Figure 11) indicates that there could be relationship between avelumab 
exposure and efficacy. However, it is important to note that several factors may limit the interpretation of 
the E-R modelling results, such as the range of data used in the E-R analysis was limited to a single dose 
level (10 mg/kg IV Q2W), and an imbalance of baseline disease covariates across exposure quartiles. 
Therefore, while avelumab single-dose trough concentration and Heng criteria, a known prognostic factor 
in the aRCC population, were identified as influential predictors of PFS, data suggest that an interaction 
exists between baseline disease covariates and exposure, and hence the exposure-PFS relationship for 
the aRCC population should be interpreted with caution. 
Models for all three safety endpoints showed relatively shallow relationships between exposure and safety 
events. The negative association with exposure estimated for TEAEs Grade ≥3 and any grade IRRs 
suggesting lower probability of AEs at higher exposure is likely confounded by multiple factors, including 
disease burden, infusion interruptions, or treatment delays. Furthermore, PK sample collection schedule 
(mostly collection at Ctrough) limited the avelumab exposure information available in cases of infusion 
interruptions. In all models, ADA status and PD-L1 status were tested as covariates, but they were not 
significant for any safety endpoint and thus no association was detected. As there are limitations to the 
exposure-safety analysis, such as confounding factors and one dose level the exposure-safety 
relationships should be interpreted with caution. 
The flat-dose justification is mainly based on the simulated comparison between the expected exposure 
range given the 10 mg/kg dose of the 800 mg flat-dose. This approach is endorsed, and the objective is 
to ensure that the newly proposed flat-dose regimen results in a similar exposure range as the 10 mg/kg 
dosing regimen with the underlying assumption that the avelumab safety and efficacy profile remain the 
same. 
For the mMCC indication an adequate simulation approach has been reported. Overall, the simulation 
results display a similar exposure range between the two dosing regimens. As expected, the weight 
relation is reversed, namely that the low weight subjects experience the highest exposure and the high 
weight subjects experience the lowest exposure levels. However, as presented in Figure 13, Table 10 and 
Table 11, the expected exposure for the low weight patients, given the 800 mg dose, does not exceed the 
exposure for the 10 mg/kg dose for the high weight patients. Overall, the expected exposure range for 
the 800 mg Q2W flat-dose is within the previously approved 10 mg/kg dose exposure range for the mMCC 
population.

-  Current or previous use of glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressants within 7 days prior to 
randomization 
Treatments 
Patients received avelumab in combination with axitinib or sunitinib monotherapy, as follows: 
- 
- 
Arm A: avelumab 10 mg/kg intravenous (IV) every two weeks (Q2W) in a 6-week cycle + axitinib 
5 mg orally (PO) twice a day (BID). 
Arm B: Sunitinib PO 50 mg once a day (QD) on a schedule of 4 weeks on treatment followed by 
2 weeks off treatment (schedule 4/2).  
The avelumab dose was based on the patient’s weight in kilograms and all patients should have been 
weighed within 3 days prior to dosing for every cycle. Avelumab dose reduction for toxicity management 
was not permitted; however, next cycle administration may have been omitted due to persisting toxicity. 
To mitigate infusion-related reactions (IRRs), premedication with an antihistamine and with paracetamol 
(acetaminophen) administered approximately 30 to 60 minutes prior to each dose of avelumab was 
mandatory.  
The study treatment was continued until objective disease progression as assessed by BICR, 
unacceptable toxicity, death, patient refusal, or patient loss to follow up. Antitumour activity was 
assessed by radiologic imaging (BICR) conducted at screening and every 6w until PD, regardless of 
initiation of subsequent therapy, for 18 mo post-randomization; then every 12w. 
Treatment after radiologic disease progression 
If radiologic imaging showed disease progression as assessed by BICR, the tumour assessment should 
have been repeated at least 4 weeks later in absence of clinical deterioration to confirm PD.  
Patients were to receive study treatment while waiting for confirmation of PD in absence of clinical 
deterioration, as defined by the following criteria: 
- 
- 
Absence of clinical signs and symptoms (including worsening of laboratory values) 
No decline in ECOG performance status 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/550625/2019  
Page 36/105 
 
 
 
- 
- 
Absence of rapid progression of disease by radiographic imaging 
Absence of progressive tumour at critical anatomical sites (eg, cord compression) requiring 
urgent alternative medical intervention 
If repeat imaging no longer showed PD but rather CR, PR or SD, treatment might be continued/resumed. 
If the repeat imaging confirmed PD by BICR assessment, study treatment was to be discontinued unless 
the patient was experiencing clinical benefit. This treatment included single-agent avelumab, 
single-agent axitinib, or avelumab in combination with axitinib in Arm A, or sunitinib monotherapy in Arm 
B (crossover between treatment arms was not permitted). Patients who stopped avelumab after initial 
clinical benefit while on treatment and then experienced radiologic disease progression confirmed by 
BICR thereafter were eligible for retreatment with avelumab at the discretion of the investigator if 1) no 
cancer treatment was administered other than axitinib since the last dose of avelumab; 2) the patient did 
not meet the safety withdrawal criteria. 
Objectives 
Study B9991003 was originally designed to demonstrate that avelumab in combination with axitinib is 
superior to sunitinib monotherapy in prolonging PFS in the first-line treatment of patients with aRCC 
irrespective of PD-L1 expression status. The B9991003 study protocol was amended in June 2017 
(amendment 5), based on ¨emerging data from Study B9991002¨ and other studies with PD-1/PD-L1 
check-point inhibitors suggesting that patients with PD-L1-positive tumours may have an increased 
probability of responding to treatment as compared to patients with tumours that are PD-L1-negative.  
The revised primary objective of the study was to demonstrate that avelumab in combination with axitinib 
is superior to sunitinib monotherapy in prolonging PFS or OS in the first line treatment of patients with 
aRCC with PD-L1-positive tumours. The associated primary endpoints were PFS based on blinded 
independent central review (BICR) assessment per RECIST v1.1 for patients with PD-L1-positive 
tumours, and OS for patients with PD-L1-positive tumours. 
Key secondary objectives were to demonstrate that avelumab in combination with axitinib is superior to 
sunitinib monotherapy in prolonging PFS by BICR or OS in the first line treatment of patients with aRCC 
irrespective of PD-L1 expression. Other secondary endpoints included objective response (OR) , PFS by 
investigator, PFS on next-line therapy (PFS2), time to response (TTR), duration of response (DoR) and 
safety

biomarker-negative subgroups. 
PD-L1 positive tumors were defined as those tumors with PD-L1 staining of any intensity in 
tumor-associated immune cells covering ≥1% of tumor area by Ventana PD-L1 (SP263). 
Sample size 
Assumptions used to determine the sample size:  
- 
the median PFS for patients receiving sunitinib is 11 months (Sutent SmPC) and the mPFS for 
patients receiving avelumab in combination with axitinib is 16.9 months for PD-L1 positive patients and 
15.7 months for patients unselected for PD-L1 expression; this corresponds to a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.65 
and 0.7, respectively, under the exponential model assumption; 
- 
the median OS for patients receiving sunitinib is 26.4 months (Sutent SPC) and the median OS for 
patients receiving avelumab in combination with axitinib is 37.7 months for PDL1 positive patients and 
35.2 months for patients unselected for PD-L1 expression; this corresponds to a HR of 0.7 and 0.75, 
respectively, under the exponential model assumption; 
- 
- 
- 
PFS drop-out rate of approximately 15% and OS drop-out rate of approximately 5%; 
70% of the randomized patients are PD-L1 positive; 
non-uniform patient accrual accomplished over a 21 month’ period. 
The expected median PFS for in the control arm was 11 months (Sutent SPC). Based on 336 PFS events, 
the study had at least 90% power to detect a HR of 0.65 for PFS in PD-L1 positive patients at α=0.004 
(one-sided); irrespective of PD-L1 expression 490 PFS events had at least 90% power to detect a HR of 
0.70 at α=0.004 (one-sided). The expected median OS in the control arm was 26.4 months. Based on 368 
OS death events, the study had at least 90% power to detect HR of 0.7 in PD-L1 positive patients at 
α=0.021 (one-sided); irrespective of PD-L1 expression 534 OS events were used for the power 
calculation. The power in this step depends on the results of the previous steps in the multiple testing 
procedure. The sample size of approximately 830 patients allows an assessment of PFS and OS in patients 
unselected for PD-L1 expression. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either avelumab + axitinib or sunitinib. A web-based 
Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system was used for the randomisation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/550625/2019  
Page 38/105 
 
 
 
The randomization was stratified by ECOG PS (0 vs 1) and region (United States vs Canada/Western 
Europe vs the rest of the world). Crossover was not permitted. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was open label. 
Statistical methods 
Efficacy variables 
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the 
first documentation of PD or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. 
PFS (months) = [date of event or censoring–date of randomization+1]/30.4375 
Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from date of randomization to the date of death due to any 
cause. Patients last known to be alive will be censored at date of last contact.   
OS (months) = [date of death or censoring–date of randomization+1]/30.4375 
Analysis sets 
The primary analyses for PFS and OS are performed on the subset of patients with PD-L1+tumours.  The 
associated analysis sets will be subsets of the analysis sets defined below, restricted to the PD-L1+ 
population. 
Full Analysis Set  
The full analysis set (FAS) includes all randomized patients.  Patients are classified according to the study 
treatment assigned at randomization.  
Safety Analysis Set  
The safety analysis set includes all patients who receive at least one dose of study drug. Patients are 
classified according to the study treatment assigned at randomization unless the incorrect treatment(s) 
was/were received throughout the dosing period in which case patients were classified according to the 
first study treatment received.  
Per-protocol analysis set  
Per protocol (PP) analysis set is a subset of the FAS and includes patients who do not meet any of the 
following criteria that could impact the key objectives of the study.  Patients who meet any of the 
following criteria were excluded from the PP analysis set.  
• 
• 
Patient did not receive at least one dose of the randomized study treatment;  
Applicable only for PFS: Patient without a tumour assessment ≥6 weeks after randomization 
(unless PD by BICR or death is observed before that time in which case the patient were not excluded 
from the PP analysis set);  
• 
• 
• 
Applicable only for PFS: Patient without measurable disease at baseline by BICR;  
ECOG status> 1;  
Any prior therapies as defined by the exclusion criterion 1 of the study protocol:  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/550625/2019  
Page 39/105 
 
 
 
  
o 
o 
Prior systemic therapy directed at advanced or metastatic RCC.  
Prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy for RCC if disease progression or relapse has 
occurred during or within 12 months after the last dose of treatment. 
o 
Prior immunotherapy with IL-2, IFN-alpha, or anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, 
anti-CD137, or anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody (including 
ipilimumab), or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or immune 
checkpoint pathways.  
o 
Prior therapy with axitinib and/or sunitinib as well as any prior therapies with other VEGF 
pathway inhibitors.  
Of note, the protocol only requires that patients have measurable disease at baseline as per investigator 
assessment. However, since PFS by BICR is a primary endpoint, “patients without measurable disease at 
baseline by BICR” will be used as a criterion to exclude patients from the PP analysis set for the sensitivity 
analysis of the PFS by BICR endpoint.   
PK analysis sets 
The PK concentration analysis set is a subset of the safety analysis set and includes patients who have at 
least one post-dose concentration measurement above the lower limit of quantitation (LLQ) for avelumab 
or axitinib.  
The PK parameter analysis set is a subset of the safety analysis set and includes patients who have at 
least one of the PK parameters of interest for avelumab or axitinib.  
Biomarker analysis set  
The biomarker analysis set for biomarkers that are measured only at screening is a subset of the safety 
analysis set and includes patients who have at least one screening biomarker assessment.  
The biomarker analysis set for biomarkers that are measured sequentially is a subset of the safety 
analysis set and includes patients who have at least one baseline and one on treatment biomarker 
assessment for the same marker. Analysis sets will be defined separately for blood-based and tumour 
tissue-based biomarkers.  
Immunogenicity analysis set  
The immunogenicity analysis set is a subset of the safety analysis set and includes patients who have at 
least one ADA/nAb sample collected for avelumab in Arm A.  
PRO analysis set  
The PRO analysis set includes all randomized patients (FAS). 
Analysis methods 
The primary efficacy analysis compares the PFS time based on BICR assessment between the 
experimental arm and the control arm and was performed using a 1-sided stratified log-rank test. The 
primary analysis of OS compared the OS time between the experimental arm and the control arm, and 
was performed using a 1-sided stratified log-rank test 
PFS and OS time associated with each treatment arm will be summarized using the Kaplan-Meier method 
and displayed graphically where appropriate. Confidence intervals (CIs) for the 25th, 50th and 75th 
percentiles will be reported. The Cox proportional hazards model will be fitted to compute the treatment 
hazard ratio and the corresponding CI. In order to account for the group sequential design in this study, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/550625/2019  
Page 40/105 
 
 
 
the repeated CI (RCI) method, will be used to construct the 2-sided RCIs for the hazard ratio at the 
interim and the final analyses of PFS. 
In addition, the unadjusted 95% CIs for the hazard ratio will also be reported at the interim and the final 
analyses for PFS. 
PFS2, defined as the time from randomization to discontinuation of next-line treatment, second objective 
disease progression, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, will be summarized by treatment 
arm using Kaplan-Meier methodology and displayed graphically, where appropriate. The median PFS2 
and 95% CI for the median will be provided for each treatment arm. 
Covariates 
The primary analyses of PFS and OS for patients with PD-L1 positive tumours, as well as the secondary 
analyses of PFS and OS for patients unselected for PD-L1 expression were stratified by these 
randomization stratification factors: ECOG PS (0 vs 1) and region (United States vs Canada/Western 
Europe vs the rest of the world). 
Subgroups 
The following subgroups were analysed:

Missing data 
PFS data were censored on the date of the last adequate tumour assessment for patients who did not 
have an event (PD or death), for patients who started new anti-cancer treatment prior to an event, or for 
patients with an event after two or more missing tumour assessments. Patients who did not have a 
baseline tumour assessment or who did not have any post-baseline tumour assessments were censored 
on the day of randomization, with a duration of 1 day, unless death occurred on or before the time of the 
second planned tumour assessment in which case the death was considered an event. 
Sensitivity analyses 
All sensitivity analyses were performed for patients with PD-L1 positive tumours and for patients 
irrespective of PD-L1 expression.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/550625/2019  
Page 41/105 
 
 
 
The following sensitivity analyses were performed to explore the robustness of the primary analysis 
results. The sensitivity analyses repeated the primary analysis (p-value, HR and 95% CIs) with the 
modifications below:  
• 
PFS based on BICR assessment and counting all PD and deaths as events regardless of missing 
assessments or timing of the event  
• 
• 
• 
PFS based on BICR assessment on the PP analysis set for PFS 
PFS based on BICR assessment using an unstratified analysis  
PFS based on BICR assessment using strata derived according to eCRF data instead of those 
entered in IRT  
• 
• 
PFS based on BICR assessment modifying the censoring rules to consider all deaths as events  
PFS based on BICR assessment modifying the censoring rules with initiation of subsequent 
anti-cancer therapies not used as a censoring reason. 
Multiplicity and interim analyses 
Four hypotheses were tested. The overall type I-error was maintained at or below 1-sided 0.025 by 
allocating α=0.004 (α1) to the PFS comparison in patients with PD-L1-positive tumours and by allocating 
α=0.021 (α2) to the OS comparison in patients with PD-L1-positive tumours. 
The submitted data is based on interim analysis 2 (IA2). A maximum of 4 distinct analyses cutoffs were 
planned in the study: 
- 
at the time when approximately 235 PFS events (70% of the expected 336 events) by BICR 
assessment had occurred in patients with PD-L1-positive tumours, and all patients had been randomized 
in the study (IA for PFS and IA1 for OS); from now on referred to as IA1 (cutoff June 2018) 
- 
at the time when 336 PFS events by BICR assessment had occurred in patients with 
PD-L1-positive tumours, and the last patient randomized in the study had been followed for at least 12 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/550625/2019  
Page 42/105 
 
 
 
 
 
 
months after randomization (primary analysis for PFS and IA2 for OS); from now on referred to as IA2 
(cutoff January 2019) 
- 
- 
15 months after the primary analysis for PFS (IA3 for OS);     
at the time when 368 deaths had occurred in patients with PD-L1-positive tumours (primary 
analysis for OS). 
For the primary PFS comparison, 336 PFS events by BICR assessment for patients with PD-L1 positive 
tumours were required to have at least 90% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.65 using a 1 sided 
log-rank test at a significance level of 0.004, and a 2-look group sequential design with Lan-DeMets 
(O’Brien-Fleming) α-spending function to determine the efficacy boundary and a Gamma Family (-15) 
β-spending function to determine the non-binding futility boundary. 
The efficacy and futility boundaries derived based on the observed number of events at the time of IA2 
(Table 1).  If the study continued to final analysis, the p-value that to be used to declare statistical 
significance at the final analysis for each endpoint was to be based on the actual number of events 
documented at the cutoff date for the final analysis, the α already spent at the IA, and the gatekeeping 
testing strategy.

[1] Derived from tumor assessment CRF pages. [2] Derived from BICR data. 
[3] Measurable disease at baseline flag changed between IA1 and IA2 due to global review by BICR conducted as per BICR 
charter for the following patients:  
     B9991003 1086 10861003 (avelumab + axitinib; PD-L1 negative) from ‘measurable’ to ‘not measurable’ 
     B9991003 1155 11551004 and B9991003 1170 11701004 (avelumab + axitinib; PD-L1 positive) from ‘not measurable’

     B9991003 1008 10081006 and B9991003 1159 11591006 (sunitinib; PD-L1 positive) from ‘not measurable’ to 
‘measurable’ 
[4] MSKCC prognostic criteria for patient B9991003 1060 10601007 (sunitinib, PD-L1 negative) changed between IA1 and 
IA2 from Poor to Intermediate due to a database correction in LDH normal range.

Study B9991002 
a Phase 1b, open-label, multicenter, dose-finding, and dose expansion study of the combination of 
avelumab with axitinib in treatment-naïve patients with aRCC conducted at 14 centers in the United 
States (US), United Kingdom (UK), and Japan.  
The primary objective of Study B9991002 was to assess the safety and tolerability of avelumab in 
combination with axitinib in patients with previously untreated aRCC in order to estimate the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) and select the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D).

In the 55 aRCC patients, 60% had an objective response (CR+PR) and a DCR of 78% at a median follow 
up of 22.3 months. 
Study EMR100070-001 
JAVELIN SOLID: a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation study of avelumab with consecutive parallel 
group expansion in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) 
cancer, metastatic breast cancer (MBC), colorectal cancer (CRC), castrate-resistant prostate cancer 
(CRPC), melanoma, ovarian cancer, head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC), adrenocortical 
carcinoma (ACC), mesothelioma, UC, and RCC. The study had a standard dose escalation “3+3” cohort 
design for DLT.  The study consisted of a dose escalation phase (completed) and an expansion Phase 
(ongoing).   
Tested doses in the escalation Phase included avelumab 1, 3, 10, and 20 mg/kg once Q2W, and 10 mg/kg 
weekly.  The dose chosen for the expansion cohorts was 10 mg/kg Q2W, based on safety, PK and target 
occupancy. 
A total of 82 patients with metastatic RCC were enrolled: 62 in first-line and 20 in second-line setting.  
The patients who experienced a confirmed CR could be treated for a max. of 24 mo.  
PD-L1 testing: Ventana PD-L1 (SP263). Data cutoff: April 2018

Study A4061051 
Study A4061051 was a 2-arm, randomized, open-label, multicenter Phase 3 study of axitinib versus 
sorafenib in patients with mRCC, with two parts: 
First-line part: 2-arm, randomized, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
axitinib 5 mg PO BID versus sorafenib 400 mg PO BID in treatment-naïve patients with mRCC.   
Second-line part: investigated the efficacy and safety of axitinib versus sorafenib in Asian patients with 
mRCC whose disease had progressed on 1 prior systemic first-line therapy for metastatic disease 
containing sunitinib, cytokines, or both.   
Patients aged ≥18 years with histologically or cytologically confirmed mRCC with a component of clear 
cell subtype and ECOG PS of 0 or 1 were eligible to be enrolled in the study.  
Between 2010 and 2012, 288 treatment-naïve patients were randomized in a ratio of 2:1 to receive either 
axitinib 5 mg BID or sorafenib 400 mg BID, in cycles of 4 weeks duration. 
The primary objective of the first-line portion of the study was to compare the PFS (IRC) of 
treatment-naïve patients with mRCC receiving axitinib versus sorafenib. The secondary efficacy 
objectives were OS, ORR, DoR.

Results: Final OS data, cutoff December 2014  
In the overall population, HR was 0.995 in favor of axitinib. The mOS was 21.7 (18.0, 31.7) for axitinib 
and 23.3 (18.1, 33.2) for sorafenib arms. In patients with ECOG 0 at baseline, HR was 0.81 in favor of 
axitinib. mOS was 41.2 (29.2, NE) for axitinib and 31.9 (18.1, NE) months for sorafenib arms. In patients 
with ECOG 1 at baseline, HR was 1.203 in favor of sorafenib. mOS was 14.2 (9.4, 18.1) for axitinib and 
19.8 (12.3, 25.8) months for sorafenib arms. 
Comparison of Studies EMR100070-001, A4061051 and B9991003 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
A type II variation for a new indication for avelumab (in combination with axitinib) for the first-line 
treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma had been submitted by the MAH based on the IA2 results of 
the pivotal study B9991003 (JAVELIN Renal 101).  
Supporting efficacy data derive from study B9991002, a dose-finding trial to evaluate safety and PK-PD 
of avelumab in combination with axitinib in previously untreated aRCC.  
Two additional studies intended to assess the contribution of each agent to the combination have been 
submitted: study EMR100070-001 (avelumab for treatment naïve aRCC, ongoing); and A4061051 
(axitinib vs sorafenib in treatment naïve mRCC, completed). 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal study B9991003 is an ongoing phase 3, randomized, open label study of avelumab in 
combination with axitinib vs sunitinib monotherapy in the first-line treatment of advanced renal cell 
carcinoma (aRCC). 
Eligible patients (irrespective of PD-L1 expression) had previously untreated advanced renal-cell 
carcinoma with a clear-cell component. Additional key inclusion criteria were the presence of at least one 
measurable lesion according to RECIST 1.1; age of 18 or older; ECOG performance-status score of 0 or 1;

a fresh or archival tumour specimen; and adequate renal, cardiac, and hepatic function. Patients across 
all Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma 
Database Consortium (IMDC or Heng) prognostic risk groups were included. Key exclusion criteria were 
active central nervous system metastases, autoimmune disease, and current or previous use of 
glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressants within 7 days before randomization. 
The pivotal study was originally designed to demonstrate that avelumab in combination with axitinib is 
superior to sunitinib monotherapy in prolonging PFS in the first-line treatment of patients with aRCC 
irrespective of PD-L1 expression status, but the protocol was amended in June 2017 to demonstrate that 
avelumab in combination with axitinib is superior to sunitinib monotherapy in prolonging PFS or OS in the 
first line treatment of patients with aRCC with PD-L1-positive tumours. The sought indication is aRCC 
(irrespective of PD-L1 expression).  
A total of 1155 patients were screened, of which 886 were randomized 1:1 to receive avelumab 10 mg/kg 
intravenous (IV) every two weeks (Q2W) in a 6-week cycle + axitinib 5 mg orally (PO) twice a day (BID) 
or sunitinib PO 50 mg once a day (QD) on a schedule of 4 weeks on treatment followed by 2 weeks off 
treatment (schedule 4/2) until objective disease progression as assessed by BICR, unacceptable toxicity, 
death, patient refusal, or patient loss to follow up. The avelumab dose was based on the patient’s weight; 
the flat avelumab dose regimen is part of the current variation. The randomization was stratified by ECOG 
(0 vs 1) and by geographic region. Cross-over was not permitted. Around 21% of patients in each arm 
belonged to favourable MSKCC / Heng prognostic risk groups, while 61% were classified as intermediate 
risk, indicative of real-world distribution of the prognostic risk factors. In all, 560 PD-L1 positive patients 
were enrolled in the pivotal trial (270 vs 290); PD-L1 expression remains unknown for 74 patients, 40 
patients in the experimental arm and 34 in the control arm. PD-L1 positive tumours were defined as those 
tumours with PD-L1 staining of any intensity in tumour-associated immune cells covering ≥1% of tumour 
area by Ventana PD-L1 (SP263).. Tumour assessment was performed by CT or MRI at baseline, every 6 
weeks after randomization for the first 18 months and every 12 weeks after confirmed disease 
progression. 
The overarching issue regarding study design remains the choice of combination partner for avelumab 
(axitinib) and of a different comparator (sunitinib) in the pivotal trial, followed by the isolation of the 
contribution of each component to the observed effect. The former was discussed with the MAH in 2015 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/668906/2015). The latter was brought into light (mainly) by the 2018 EMA approval 
of nivolumab plus ipilimumab for the first-line treatment of adult patients with intermediate / poor-risk 
aRCC. In an effort to characterize the contribution of each component, the MAH submitted data from 
study EMR100070-001, concerning avelumab monotherapy in 62 previously untreated mRCC patients; 
and study A4061051, comparing PFS and OS of treatment-naïve patients with mRCC receiving axitinib 
versus sorafenib. While, in the absence of randomized studies with a factorial design, there is some 
uncertainty on the quantitative contribution of each agent, the provided data are indicative of a 
substantial increase in sum pharmacodynamic activity (ORR) when avelumab and axitinib are combined. 
This conclusion is supported by data on other combinations of VGEF-targeting TKI and PD-(L)1 targeting 
agents. In summary data are sufficient to justify the contribution of each agent to sum efficacy. 
To date, sunitinib is a preferred choice in favourable risk patients; and a recommended therapy in 
intermediate/poor risk patients, when nivolumab plus ipilimumab or cabozantinib are not available / 
cannot be administered. Axitinib monotherapy lacked acceptance as a comparator in the frontline setting 
as early as 2015, as acknowledged during central scientific advice; its use is confined to relapse after 
sunitinib or a cytokine. Sunitinib is therefore considered an adequate comparator in the frontline aRCC 
setting.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The efficacy data correspond to the primary analysis for PFS and IA2 for OS (cutoff date January 2019). 
At IA2 all patients had a minimum duration of follow-up of 13 months, or had died, had withdrawn 
consent or had been lost to follow-up prior to 13 months. 
PFS 
In all, 487 progression events have been observed by January 2019, of which 309 in PD-L1 positive 
patients. In the whole study population (irrespective of PD-L1 expression), the main reason for censoring 
was ongoing without event (34.4 in the experimental arm vs 19.1% in the control arm), start of new 
anti-cancer therapy (7 vs 15.1%) and withdrawal of consent (3.6 vs 3.8%).  
The mPFS (experimental arm vs control) was 13.3 vs 8 months, HR 0.69 (0.57;0.83; 1-sided p <0.0001), 
irrespective of PD-L1 expression; 13.8 vs 7, HR 0.62 (0.49; 0.78, 1-sided p <0.0001, in PD-L1 positive 
patients; and 12.5 vs 8.7, HR 0.87 (0.62; 1.22), in PD-L1 negative patients. Notably, the study was not 
powered to show a PFS improvement in the PD-L1 negative subgroup, comprising 28.4% of the trial 
population. As PD-L1 expression has not been a strong predictor of response in relevant trials, this should 
not be considered for a restriction of the indication.  
PFS subgroup analyses: the PFS benefit for the combination therapy is observed across pre-specified 
subgroups, including PD-L1 expression and MSKCC and Heng (IMDC) risk groups. In the favourable 
prognostic risk group, the event rate is approximately 37% in the experimental arm and 44% in the 
control arm, with HR of 0.73 (0.47; 1.13) for MSKCC and 0.63 (0.40; 0.99) for Heng, data considered 
sufficient to assume benefit even in this patient subgroup.  
OS  
A total of 238 deaths were observed by the IA2 cutoff, 145 (39.4% 145/368) in the PD-L1+ group and 
238 (44.6% 238/534) in the whole population. Irrespective of PD-L1 expression, the OS maturity was 
20.4% for the experimental arm and 24.2% for the control arm in January 2019. In patients irrespective 
of PD-L1 expression, the median duration of OS follow-up was approximately 19 months for both arms. 
The IA2 OS point estimates favour avelumab in combination axitinib compared to sunitinib: 0.8 (0.62; 
1.03, 1-sided p 0.0392) irrespective of PD-L1 expression (FAS); 0.83 (0.60;1.15, 1-sided p 0.1301) in 
PD-L1 positive patients; and 0.79 (0.48;1.28, no p value calculated) for PD-L1 negative patients. 
However, the OS results are immature and statistical significance has not been reached. This constitutes 
an uncertainty regarding the long-term benefit. As the next submission of OS data is scheduled for May 
2020 (i.e. 15 months after the primary analysis for PFS), the uncertainty concerning the maturity of OS 
is noted, but will not be pursued, considering moreover the tolerable safety profile of the 
avelumab+axitinib combination and the positive PFS2 data. 
OS subgroup analyses: the main IA2 efficacy outcomes by MSKCC / Heng prognostic criteria and by PD-L1 
expression have been provided and support the effect of avelumab+axitinib in the population described in 
the indication.   
Response 
- 
BOR: Approximately 50% of outcomes in the experimental arm are partial responses: 48.6% in 
the whole population, 50.4% in the PD-L1+ subgroup and 47.7% in the PD-L1- subgroup. The 
correspondent PR rates for sunitinib are 25.2%, 24.8% and 27.5%, respectively (the best 
responses for sunitinib are mainly stable disease). Outcomes as disease progression are 
numerically higher for sunitinib, with the exception of PD-L1 negative subgroup (2.5% lower than 
avelumab+axitinib).   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/550625/2019  
Page 65/105 
 
 
 
-  ORR: The objective responses favour the experiment arm, 52.5 vs 27.3% irrespective of PD-L1 
expression, 55.9 vs 27.2% for PD-L1 positive and 49.2 vs 29.2% for PD-L1 negative patients.  
PFS2: Less patients had a PFS2 event in the combination arm (n=133, 30%) compared to the control arm 
(n=192, 43.2%). PFS2 was longer in all patients irrespective of PD-L1 expression and there seems to be 
no detrimental impact of first-line treatment with the combination of avelumab and axitinib on 
subsequent benefit from second-line treatments. The PFS2 outcomes support the latest OS data. As 
expected, a marked use of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as next therapy in the control arm (35.8% vs 7.5%) was 
noted. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Avelumab in combination with axitinib has shown improved PFS compared to sunitinib in previously 
untreated advanced clear-cell RCC patients. Results are statistically significant in the patients with PD-L1 
positive tumours, with a trend towards increased PFS in the PD-L1 negative subgroup. In the favourable 
prognostic risk group, the event rate and the precision of point estimates are considered sufficient to 
assume benefit even in this patient subgroup. These efficacy outcomes are supported by ORR and PFS2. 
However, the OS results are immature and statistical significance has not been reached, which 
constitutes an uncertainty regarding the long-term benefit. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
This type II variation seeks approval for avelumab in combination with axitinib for the first-line treatment 
of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC). 
The use of avelumab in combination with axitinib for the treatment of patients with aRCC is evaluated by 
the results of Study B9991003 (an international, multicenter, randomized, Phase 3 study of avelumab in 
combination with axitinib n=434 vs sunitinib n=439, in the first-line treatment of aRCC). 
In study B9991002 (an open-label, dose-finding, dose-expansion Phase 1b study) 54 patients were 
treated with avelumab in combination with axitinib and 1 patient received axitinib only. These results 
were pooled with the results from study B9991003 to a total of 489 treatment naïve patients with aRCC 
who received at least one dose of study drug when treated with avelumab 10 mg/kg intravenously (IV) 
every 2 weeks (Q2W) in combination with axitinib 5 mg orally (PO) twice daily (BID). 
In addition, safety data from the Pooled Safety Population treated with avelumab monotherapy from 
Studies EMR100070-001 and EMR100070-003 (N=1738) included in the original marketing authorization 
application (MAA) have been provided. The median duration of treatment with avelumab monotherapy in 
the Pooled Safety Population was much shorter than that reported in the Pooled aRCC Population (12 
weeks and 37.9 weeks, respectively).

Adverse events  
Table 7  Summary of Adverse Events During the On-Treatment Period 
In the Pooled aRCC Population during the on-treatment period, TEAEs and treatment related TEAEs led to 
discontinuation of any study drug in 112 (22.9%) and 91 (18.6%) patients, respectively.                                               
The most frequently reported TEAEs leading to discontinuation of any study drug (≥2% of patients) were 
Alanine aminotransferase increased (4.3%) and Aspartate aminotransferase increased (2.7%). No other 
TEAE leading to discontinuation of any study drug was reported in >2% of patients. In the Pooled aRCC

population, TEAEs and treatment-related TEAEs leading to discontinuation of avelumab were reported in 
94 (19.2%) and 73 (14.9%) patients, respectively.  
TEAEs in the Cardiac Disorders SOC that led to avelumab treatment discontinuation were reported in 
1.4% of the patients, with Myocarditis being the only event reported in more than 1 patient (0.6% of 
patients versus 0.4% of patients for axitinib and 0% of patients for sunitinib).

Definition of irAE in the study: AE onset was from the time of first study drug administration through 
90 days after last dose of study drug. AE required treatment with corticosteroids or other 
immunosuppressant therapy or (for endocrinopathies only) hormonal therapy.  
There was no clear other explanation than immune-mediated aetiology and/or there was a 
histopathology/biopsy consistent with an immune-mediated mechanism. All cases identified were 
assessed medically and a final decision was made on whether the AE was an irAE or not.

The medical history of the two patients with fatal myocarditis;  
One patient’s medical history did not include any condition relevant for cardiovascular risk. In Study 
B9991002, cardiac biomarkers and LVEF were not routinely measured. The patient received 2 avelumab 
infusions and myocarditis had a fulminant course with death on Study Day 27. No steroids were given to 
treat myocarditis, and diagnosis was confirmed by autopsy. 
The other patient’s medical history (relevant for cardiovascular risk) included prior atrial fibrillation and 
ongoing hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. At the onset of myocarditis, the patient had received 2 
infusions of avelumab and high levels of troponin were reported. The patient was treated with steroids 
and passed away due to fatal myocarditis on Study Day 50. Myocarditis was diagnosed based on clinical 
criteria. 
Based on the limited cases, no particular factors have been identified in the medical history which could 
explain the fatal outcome.

Table 17 Pancreatitis- frequency and severity 
A summary of findings in the medical history of the patients who experienced fatal pancreatitis in Study 
B9991003 is presented below: 
- For one patient with RCC metastatic to the surrenalectomy cavity and lung, the reported medical history 
included ongoing polycythaemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, adrenal insufficiency, dyspnoea, tachycardia 
and contrast media allergy. BMI was 34.34 kg/m2. 
- For the other patient, with RCC metastatic to lung and liver, the reported medical history included prior 
cholecystectomy and ongoing hyperlipidaemia, gastrooesophageal reflux disease, osteoarthritis, varicose 
vein, hypertension, and depressed mood. BMI was 38.38 kg/m2. 
Based on available data, the clinical factors potentially increasing the risk of complications or death due 
to acute pancreatitis common to the 2 patients were metastatic RCC, age > 60 years, and BMI > 30 
kg/m2. However, the sample size is very small so it is difficult to draw a conclusion from these 
observations.

Safety in special populations 
No patients less than 18 years of age were included in the study.  
Data were examined for the effects of age, gender, race, and ethnicity on avelumab, axitinib, and 
sunitinib exposure and safety. No meaningful differences among these groups were observed. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Avelumab is eliminated by intracellular lysosomal proteolytic degradation throughout the entire body and 
therefore is not expected to be affected by small molecule drugs that are cytochrome P450 (CYP450) 
enzyme modulators or by transporter modulators. 
Discontinuation of therapy  
Table 25 Reason for discontinuation of therapy at time of data cut-off 
In the Pooled aRCC population treated with avelumab in combination with axitinib, TEAEs associated with 
permanent discontinuation of any drug were reported for 22.9% patients and TEAEa leading to 
discontinuation of all study drugs were reported in 7.2% patients. 
Post marketing experience 
The first PSUR for avelumab covered the 6-month interval of 23 September 2017 through 22 March 
2018.The approximate post-authorization exposure to avelumab was 563 patient-years during this PSUR 
reporting period and 671 patient-years cumulatively. No new safety signals were identified during this 
reporting period. Safety data received from clinical trials and post marketing sources were generally 
consistent with the identified and potential risks for avelumab. The second PSUR for avelumab covered 
the 6-month interval of 23 March 2018 through 22 September 2018. The approximate post-authorization 
exposure to avelumab was 373 patient-years during this PSUR reporting period and  1044 patient-years 
cumulatively. On 05 October 2018, EMA notified Merck KGaA of a signal of pancreatitis with avelumab. 
Merck KGaA performed a review of all available data and considered the signal of pancreatitis validated. 
The product information and RMP were updated to include the risk of pancreatitis.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety analyses are primarily based on safety data from 489 patients with treatment-naïve aRCC who 
received at least one dose of study drug when treated with avelumab 10 mg/kg intravenously twice a 
week in combination with axitinib 5 mg per os twice a day (=pooled aRCC population including 55 patients 
from a phase 1 study and 434 patients from the pivotal study, randomised, same inclusions criteria in 
both studies). 
Data from 2 clinical studies of monotherapy avelumab and axitinib in treatment-naïve patients with aRCC 
are also included in order to assess the individual agent`s contribution to the safety profile, in addition to 
safety data from the pooled safety population treated with avelumab monotherapy from study EMR 
100070-001 and EMR 100070-003 (N=1738) used in the original marketing authorisation. 
The safety data base is of an acceptable magnitude for identifying the safety profile of avelumab in 
combination with axitinib at least in the short-term perspective. 
The median treatment duration with avelumab was 37.9 weeks and with a dose intensity of 92.3% and 
with axitinib 39.9 weeks and the relative dose intensity was 88.4%. The median treatment duration in the 
randomization arm with sunitinib was 31.7 weeks and dose intensity 83.9%. In the context of exposure 
the tolerability of avelumab was reasonable. 
Almost all patients experienced at least one TEAE and quite a high proportion was Grade ≥3 TEAE´s 
(71.6% in the pooled aRCC population combination arm and 71.5% in the sunitinib arm), and serious 
TEAEs were reported in 35.4% in the pooled aRCC population and 28.7% in the sunitinib arm. 
Discontinuation of Avelumab due to treatment-related TEAEs were noted in 14.9% and subjects with 
treatment-related TEAEs leading to discontinuation of all study drugs in 3.3%. Which support an 
acceptable tolerability and that the TEAEs are in general manageable. 
The most common (>20% of patients) TEAEs in the pooled aRCC Population were (in decreasing rate) 
Diarrhoea, Hypertension, Fatigue, Nausea, Palmar-plantar erythro-dysesthesia (PPE) syndrome, 
Dysphonia, Decreased appetite, Hypothyroidism, Cough, Stomatitis, Headache, Arthralgia and 
Dyspnoea. 
The most common Grade≥ 3 TEAEs (>5% of patients) were (in decreasing rate) Hypertension, Diarrhoea, 
PPE syndrome and alanine aminotransferase increased.  
The safety profile of the combination arm in the pooled aRCC study was mostly consistent with those of 
avelumab and axitinib monotherapy, with some exceptions: 
Diarrhoea which is a known adverse reaction for both avelumab (18.9%) and axitinib (49.7%) was 
reported a higher frequency (62.8%) in the combination arm from the pooled aRCC study. The frequency 
of Grade ≥3 Diarrhoea was similar to axitinib monotherapy but higher than avelumab monotherapy. The 
Median time tor resolution of diarrhoea of any grade was 20.0 days and median time to resolution of 
Grade >=3 was 6 days. Hospitalization due to diarrhoea was reported in 2.3% of patients.Hypertension 
is a known adverse reaction for axitinib and was of the same frequency in the combination arm (49.3) as 
for axitinib monotherapy (48.7).A higher frequency of Grade ≥3 Hypertension was reported in the 
combination arm as compared to axitinib alone (26.0% vs 13.8%) this seems to be a result of using 
different criteria for adverse events (NCI CTCAE).  
The frequency of hypothyroidism, known as an adverse reaction in avelumab monotherapy (6.4%) and 
axitinib monotherapy (20.6%), was reported higher for the combination treatment (25.2%) than for 
monotherapy. The Grade ≥3 frequency was low both for the combination treatment and for the 
monotherapy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/550625/2019  
Page 87/105 
 
 
 
Alanine aminotransferase increased, a known adverse reaction for both avelumab and axitinib was 
reported at a higher frequency for the combination treatment than for each agent as monotherapy. The 
same was observed for Grade ≥3 events. 
Three cases of myocarditis were reported in the Pooled aRCC Population, one had a fulminant course with 
a fatal outcome that never received any treatment. The other two received high-dose Prednisolone, one 
died during steroid treatment and the other one recovered.  
In addition, the cardiac clinical events committee (CCEC) identified 2 cases of “myocarditis-probable” and 
2 cases of “myocarditis-possible” in the combination arm in the aRCC population of study B9991003. One 
case of “myocarditis-possible” was also identified in the sunitinib arm. This has been reflected in SmPC 
and PL. 
Two cases of fatal immune- related pancreatitis were reported in the combination arm. Fatal events of 
pancreatitis have not been previously reported with avelumab. Pancreatitis is a known adverse reaction 
for immune checkpoint inhibitors. Amylase and lipase increased are known reactions for axitinib. This has 
been reflected in SmPC and PL. 
The irAE profile observed with avelumab in combination with axitinib appears to be generally consistent 
with what was observed with avelumab alone, with the exceptions of thyroid disorders, hepatitis and 
pancreatitis. 
The most common irAE`s in the Pooled aRCC Population were Hypothyroidism, Alanine aminotransferase 
increased, Hyperthyroidism, Aspartate aminotransferase increased, blood thyroid stimulating hormone 
increased, and rash. 
IRRs that are life-threatening have been reported for avelumab in clinical trials. Thus, premedication with 
an antihistamine and paracetamol administered 30-60 minutes prior to each dose of avelumab was 
mandatory in the aRCC combination study. In the pooled aRCC population 28.4 % of the patients had 
events identified as IRRs. There was no grade 4 or fatal IRRs most AEs were of low grade. The first IRR 
occurred in the majority of patients at infusion 1 (21.1%) or infusion 2 (7.5%). All IRRs had resolved as 
of data cut-off. 
There was a low incidence of antidrug antibodies (ADAs) in the Pooled aRCC Population, which did not 
appear to impact safety. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of avelumab in combination with axitinib appears fairly consistent with the known safety 
profile of avelumab monotherapy however not previously identified cases of pancreatitis including fatal 
events were reported (see SmPC). In addition, there were three cases of myocarditis including two fatal 
events (see SmPC). 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

updated. Particularly, new warnings with regard to Immune related pancreatitis, Immune related 
myocarditis and Hepatotoxicity have been added to the product information. The Package Leaflet has 
been updated accordingly.  
In addition, sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated with regard to the switch from 
weight-based to flat dose. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the package leaflet are minimal and do 
not require user consultation with target patient groups. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Bavencio in combination with axitinib is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with 
advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The treatment of aRCC relies on patient allocation to a prognostic risk group (favourable, intermediate or 
poor) at diagnosis. Two models, MSKCC and Heng (IMDC), are widely used.  
According to the 2019 ESMO guideline for the first-line treatment of clear cell renal carcinoma, in 
favourable-risk patients, sunitinib, pazopanib and bevacizumab plus interferon remain the standard of 
care. Tivozanib is another standard of care when available. In intermediate and poor risk patients, the 
combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab is the new standard of care, followed by cabozantinib, 
sunitinib, pazopanib, tivozanib and bevacizumab plus interferon. In poor-risk patients, nivolumab and 
ipilimumab is the new standard of care with cabozantinib sunitinib, pazopanib and temsirolimus that can 
be used 
Recently, the combination of pembrolizumab with axitinib was approved for the first line treatment of 
advanced or metastatic RCC. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The application is based upon the interim analysis (IA2) of pivotal study B9991003 (JAVELIN Renal 101), 
a phase 3, randomized, open-label study of avelumab in combination with axitinib vs sunitinib 
monotherapy in the first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma, with January 2019 as data 
cutoff.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
A statistically significant benefit in PFS (BICR) has been observed for avelumab + axitinib compared to 
sunitinib: HR 0.62 (0.49; 0.78; 1-sided p <0.0001) for PD-L1 positive patients and 0.69 (0.57; 0.83, 
1-sided p <0.0001) for irrespective of PD-L1 expression group. The PFS benefit for the combination 
therapy was observed across pre-specified subgroups, including MSKCC and Heng (IMDC) risk groups. In 
the favourable prognostic risk group, the event rate is approximately 37% in the experimental arm and 
44% in the control arm, with HR of 0.73 (0.47; 1.13) for MSKCC and 0.63 (0.40; 0.99) for Heng, with data 
considered sufficient to assume benefit even in this patient subgroup. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The PFS in patients with PD-L1 negative tumours had a HR of 0.87 (0.62; 1.22). However, the study is not 
powered to show effect in the PD-L1 negative subgroup (which comprises 36.8% of the trial population) 
and does not lead to a restriction of the indication.  
OS point estimates favour avelumab in combination with axitinib compared to sunitinib. However, the OS 
results are immature (irrespective of PD-L1 expression, the OS maturity by arm was 20% for the 
experimental arm and 24% for the control arm in January 2019) and statistical significance has not been 
reached. The uncertainty concerning the maturity of OS is noted. However, a detrimental effect on OS is 
shown to be unlikely. 
While the additive effect of axitinib and avelumab have been shown based on a substantial increase in 
ORR over the individual agents, this is based on cross study comparisons. Thus, the additive effect has 
been shown in a qualitative sense, but there is no precise quantification of the contribution of each agent. 
However, available data are considered sufficient to justify the contribution of each agent to the overall 
activity of the proposed regimen.. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects  
The median treatment duration with avelumab was 37.9 weeks with a dose intensity 92.3% and with 
axitinib it was 39.9 weeks and the relative dose intensity was 88.4%. The median treatment duration in 
the control arm with sunitinib was 31.7 weeks and dose intensity 83.9%. 
Almost all patients experienced at least one TEAE and quite a high proportion was Grade ≥3 TEAE´s, 71.6 
% in the pooled aRCC population combination arm and 71.5% in the sunitinib arm. Serious TEAEs were 
reported in 35.4% in the pooled aRCC population treated with the combination and 28.7% in the sunitinib 
arm.  In the pooled aRCC population treated with the combination, TEAEs associated with permanent 
discontinuation of any drug were reported for 22.9% patients and TEAEs leading to discontinuation of all 
study drugs were reported in 7.2% patients. 
The most common (>20% of patients) TEAEs in the pooled aRCC Population were (in decreasing rate) 
Diarrhoea, Hypertension, Fatigue, Nausea, Palmar-plantar erythro-dysesthesia (PPE) syndrome, 
Dysphonia, Decreased appetite, Hypothyroidism, Cough, Stomatitis, Headache, Arthralgia and 
Dyspnoea. 
The most common Grade≥ 3 TEAEs (5% of patients) were (in decreasing rate) Hypertension, Diarrhoea, 
PPE syndrome and alanine aminotransferase increased.  
Diarrhoea which is a known adverse reaction for both avelumab (18.9%) and axitinib (49.7%) was 
reported with a higher frequency (62.8%) in the combination arm from the pooled aRCC study. The 
frequency of Grade ≥3 Diarrhoea was similar to axitinib monotherapy but higher than avelumab 
monotherapy. Median time to resolution of diarrhoea of any grade was 20.0 days (range 1.0 to 784+) and

median time to resolution of Grade>=3 diarrhoea of any grade was 20.0 days (range 1.0 to 31.0+) in the 
pooled safety population, hospitalization due to diarrhoea was reported in 2.3% of patients who 
experienced diarrhoea.  
Hypertension is a known adverse reaction for axitinib and was reported at the same frequency in the 
combination arm (49.3) as for axitinib monotherapy (48.7). A higher frequency of Grade ≥3 Hypertension 
was reported in the combination arm as compared to axitinib alone (26.0% vs 13.8%) this seems to be 
a result of using different criteria for adverse events (NCI CTCAE). 
The frequency of hypothyroidism, known as an adverse reaction in avelumab monotherapy (6.4%) and 
axitinib monotherapy (20.6%), was reported higher for the combination treatment (25.2%) than for 
avelumab/axitinib monotherapy. The Grade ≥3 frequency was low both for the combination treatment and 
for the monotherapy. 
Alanine aminotransferase increase, a known adverse reaction for both avelumab and axitinib, was 
reported at a higher frequency for the combination treatment than for each agent as monotherapy. The 
same was observed for Grade ≥3 events. 
Three cases of immune-related myocarditis were reported in the Pooled aRCC Population, one had a 
fulminant course with a fatal outcome that never received any treatment. The other two received 
high-dose Prednisolone, one died during steroid treatment and the other one recovered. 
Two cases of fatal immune- related pancreatitis were reported in the combination arm. Fatal events of 
pancreatitis have not been previously reported with avelumab monotherapy. Amylase and lipase increase 
are known reactions for axitinib (Inlyta SmPC 4.8). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Long-term safety data is not available. This will be addressed through further monitoring and 
characterization of long-term avelumab treatment in the ongoing clinical trials (see RMP).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
A benefit in PFS has been shown, as well as a trend towards increased OS. The PFS gain is consistent 
across PD-L1 expression and prognostic risk group strata. This is sufficient to define clinical benefit in the 
first line treatment of RCC.  
Avelumab in combination with axitinib has shown improved PFS compared to sunitinib in previously 
untreated advanced clear-cell RCC patients. Result are statistically significant in the patients with PD-L1 
positive tumours, with a trend towards increased PFS in the PD-L1 negative subgroup. Also in the 
favourable prognostic risk group, the event rate and the precision of point estimates are considered 
sufficient to assume a positive B/R. These efficacy outcomes are supported by ORR and PFS2. However, 
the OS results are immature and statistical significance has not been reached, which constitutes an 
uncertainty regarding the scope of clinical benefit.

Safety analyses are primarily based on safety data from 489 patients with treatment-naïve aRCC who 
received at least one dose of study drug when treated with avelumab 10 mg/kg intravenously twice a 
week in combination with axitinib 5 mg per os twice a day (=pooled aRCC population). The safety data 
base is of an acceptable magnitude for identifying the safety profile of avelumab in combination with 
axitinib, though long-term data are missing. 
The safety profile of avelumab in combination with axitinib is fairly consistent with the known safety 
profile of avemulab even though some adverse effects were more common with the combination therapy 
and there were fatal cases of myocarditis and pancreatitis. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
A benefit in PFS has been shown, as well as a trend towards increased OS. The PFS gain is consistent 
across PD-L1 expression and prognostic risk group strata. This is sufficient to define clinical benefit in the 
first line treatment of RCC. The safety profile of avelumab in combination with axitinib is fairly consistent 
with the known safety profile of avelumab and considered acceptable in this new indication. Therefore, 
the benefits of the combination treatment are considered to outweigh the risks. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Exposure comparisons between 10 mg/kg dosing and a flat 800 mg dose based on simulations from 
population PK models are the justification for the change of the posology to flat-dosing for the previously 
approved mMCC indication as well as for the treatment of aRCC patients. The benefit-risk balance for the 
800 mg Q2W flat-dose posology is considered unchanged compared to the 10 mg/kg Q2W posology since 
the flat-dose exposure range is comparable to the weight-based dosing exposure range. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Bavencio is positive.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
AMGLIDIA is indicated for the treatment of neonatal diabetes mellitus, for use in newborns, infants 
and children. 
Sulphonylureas like AMGLIDIA have been shown to be effective in patients with mutations in the 
genes coding for the β-cell ATP-sensitive potassium channel and chromosome 6q24-related transient 
neonatal diabetes mellitus. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Glibenclamide suspension therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the treatment of 
patients with very early onset diabetes. 
Prescription instructions 
Care should be taken when prescribing and administering AMGLIDIA to avoid dosing errors due to 
confusion between milligram (mg) and millilitre (mL). It should be ensured that the proper dose and 
strength are communicated and dispensed.  
Posology 
To avoid exceeding sodium benzoate acceptable daily dose, AMGLIDIA daily dose should not exceed 
1 mL/kg/day. As a consequence, AMGLIDIA 0.6 mg/mL should not be used for posology higher than 
0.6 mg/kg/day. 
To limit exposure to sodium benzoate and with respect to the mode of delivery (1 mL and 5 mL oral 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
syringes), it is not recommended to use the AMGLIDIA 0.6 mg/mL strength for posologies higher 
than the ones described below:

In any other cases, AMGLIDIA 6 mg/mL should be preferred. 
AMGLIDIA therapy should be initiated at 0.2 mg/kg per day in two divided doses before feeding 
(including bottle feeding) and increased by 0.2 mg/kg/day until insulin independence is achieved. 
Since AMGLIDIA is administered with an oral syringe graduated in mL, the calculated daily dose 
should be expressed in mL by the physician explicitly stating the strength to be used. 
The syringe will be chosen (1 mL or 5 mL) based on the volume in mL to be administered for each 
dose, as prescribed by the physician. The 5 mL syringe has to be used for volumes greater than 1 mL. 
The nearest volume to the calculated one should be used. 
Patients should be closely monitored by their treating physician during the titration phase. 
Inpatient treatment introduction 
AMGLIDIA should be introduced at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg/day, in two administrations. Basal and bolus 
insulin should be administered on Day 1. On Day 2, if administered sub-cutaneously, basal insulin can 
be removed. If on insulin pump, basal rate of insulin pump should be reduced by 50% and should be 
further reduced in accordance with capillary blood-glucose measurements. Throughout the transfer 
period, bolus insulin or insulin pump boluses should be administered with meals as required to 
maintain reasonable glycemic control. From Day 2 until the end of the titration phase, if capillary 
blood glucose is ≥7 mmol/L, AMGLIDIA should be increased by 0.2 mg/kg/day. If capillary blood 
glucose is < 7 mmol/L, AMGLIDIA should not be increased and pre-meal insulin boluses should be 
reduced by 50%. 
Pre-breakfast glucose may be very slow to fall. Pre-lunch or pre-evening meal glucose values fall 
more rapidly and are generally a better marker of response to AMGLIDIA. 
The same protocol should be repeated every day until insulin independence is achieved. As soon as 
insulin is discontinued, the dose of AMGLIDIA is adjusted according to capillary blood glucose. 
For patients still under insulin at day 6, the dose of AMGLIDIA should be maintained for at least 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4 weeks. This may be done as an outpatient. 
Patients can be discharged when no longer requiring insulin treatment, when stable on a combination 
of AMGLIDIA and insulin or when stable on insulin alone. 
Outpatient treatment introduction 
AMGLIDIA should be introduced at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg/day in two administrations and the dose 
should be progressively increased each week by 0.2 mg/kg/day. 
As the dose is increased, it is usually possible to reduce and then stop the insulin dose. 
From week 2 onward, if capillary blood glucose is ≥7 mmol/L AMGLIDIA should be increased by 
0.2 mg/kg/day and insulin should be reduced. If capillary blood glucose is < 7 mmol/L insulin should 
be reduced. 
If blood-glucose value increases after insulin reduction, AMGLIDIA should be increased by 
0.2 mg/kg/day. Insulin reduction should be done using the pre-meal glucose. 
The same protocol should be repeated every week until insulin independence is achieved. As soon as 
insulin is discontinued, the dose of AMGLIDIA is adjusted according to capillary blood glucose. 
If at the end of a 5 to 6-week period, there is no evidence of a response with insulin doses similar to 
those at starting, administration of doses up to 2 mg/kg/day for a week may be tried (in rare cases, it 
has taken 4 months to wean off insulin completely). 
If there is a clear reduction in insulin requirement at this dose of 2 mg/kg/day (reduction in insulin to 
at least 60% of pre-AMGLIDIA dose), then it is worth continuing a higher dose of AMGLIDIA over a 
prolonged period of time in selected cases. 
Dose adjustments and long-term management 
As shown in the literature and in the clinical studies performed with glibenclamide, the average daily 
dose is expected to be around 0.2 to 0.5 mg/kg/day in most of the patients suffering from neonatal 
diabetes. Higher doses have occasionally been observed and doses up to 2.8 mg/kg/day have been 
successfully given without adverse reactions, according to literature. In case of a partial response on 
lower doses, as shown by reduced insulin requirements, a further dose increase up to 2.8 mg/kg/day 
may be tried in selected cases. 
In some children glycemic control can be better achieved when glibenclamide is administered 3 times 
or 4 times daily. 
If no improvement is seen (unchanged insulin dose, similar glycaemic control and no improvement in 
neurology), AMGLIDIA should be discontinued. 
During titration period patients’ capillary blood-glucose concentration should continue to be 
monitored four times a day and at bedtime, as insulin requirements may continue to fall, or 
AMGLIDIA may need to be titrated. Once steady state is reached, capillary blood glucose does no 
longer need to be daily monitored except in clinical situations at risk of metabolic unbalance (see 
below). In all cases, HbA1c must be monitored every three months. 
Sometimes, blood-glucose concentration will fall even though the patient is on a fixed dose of 
AMGLIDIA. Therefore, to avoid hypoglycaemia, consideration should be given to reducing the dose 
of AMGLIDIA or stopping treatment. 
Reduction of AMGLIDIA dose should be anticipated by the treating physician and certainly if the 
glucose values are going below 4 mmol/L (72 mg/dL). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It may be necessary to adjust the dose of AMGLIDIA in patients suffering from intercurrent 
infections, trauma, shock or anaesthesia: 
− 
− 
− 
For major surgery, insulin therapy should replace AMGLIDIA; 
Hepatic or renal dysfunction may require a reduction in dose; 
In exceptional situations of stress (e.g. trauma, surgery, febrile infections), blood-glucose 
regulation may deteriorate, and a temporary change to insulin may be necessary to maintain 
good metabolic control. 
Patients occasionally may have very high glucose values, i.e. > 20 mmol/L (> 360 mg/dL). In some 
cases these high glucose values seem to settle with the normal dose of AMGLIDIA. However, close 
monitoring of blood-glucose is required in all cases (please also refer to recommendations given under 
the heading “dose omission” further below) and adequate measures to restore euglycaemia (e. g. 
application of a third daily AMGLIDIA dose or insulin) must be taken. 
Bioequivalence with tablets 
AMGLIDIA is not bioequivalent with (crushed) tablets containing the same amount of glibenclamide. 
Available data are described in section 5.2. 
Missed dose  
If a dose is missed, there is a risk of hyperglycaemia. Blood-glucose level must be checked 
immediately and AMGLIDIA must be taken as soon as possible. If the blood-glucose level exceeds 
16.5 mmol/L, the presence of ketonuria or ketonaemia must also be checked. If ketone bodies are 
present, an insulin injection must be given rapidly to restore the metabolic situation. The attending 
specialist should then be contacted. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
Dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. In those patients, 
treatment should be started at the lowest dose levels and should be strictly followed, to avoid 
hypoglycaemic reactions (see section 4.4). For severe renal impairment see section 4.3. 
Hepatic impairment 
Dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. In those patients, 
treatment should be started at the lowest dose levels and should be strictly followed, to avoid 
hypoglycaemic reactions (see section 4.4). For severe hepatic impairment see section 4.3. 
Elderly 
Safety and efficacy of AMGLIDIA in elderly patients have not been established since the medicinal 
product is indicated in the paediatric population. 
At risk patients 
In malnourished patients or those displaying a marked change in their general condition, or whose 
calorie intake is irregular, and in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function, treatment should be 
started at the lowest dose levels and should be strictly followed, to avoid hypoglycaemic reactions (see 
section 4.4). 
Method of administration 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This medicinal product is administered orally as a “ready for-use” oral suspension using a graduated 
oral syringe. It is administered directly into the child's mouth. The bottle does not need to be shaken 
before administration. 
Since no interaction study between glibenclamide and milk has been performed, and despite absence 
of food effect on glibenclamide absorption, recommendation is given to administer the suspension 15 
minutes before child’s milk feeding. 
Only the oral syringe included in the outer carton should be used. 
Depending on the volume to be administered orally, there are two types of oral syringes, graduated up 
to 1 mL or up to 5 mL. Each syringe is included in a specific pack size. The appropriate syringe (1 mL 
or 5 mL), included in a specific AMGLIDIA pack size, will be prescribed by the physician based on 
the volume to be administered for each dose. 
The two syringes, respectively included in two different pack sizes for each strength, are clearly 
distinguishable: 1 mL oral syringe is thin and small while 5 mL syringe is thick and long. 
The dose to be administered is obtained by drawing the plunger back as far as the scale marking for 
the dose determined for each child. The dose in mL per administration and the number of 
administrations per day have to carefully follow the medical prescription. 
Administration through a feeding tube should be avoided. 
For instructions of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
This medicinal product is contraindicated in the following cases: 
− 
hypersensitivity to the active substance, other sulphonylureas or sulphonamides or to any of the 
excipients listed in section 6.1;in patients with ketoacidosis, continuous intravenous insulin 
injection and intravenous infusion of physiologic sodium chloride solution remains the 
benchmark treatment. 
in patients with porphyria; 
in patients taking bosentan (see section 4.5) 
in patients with severe renal impairment 
in patients with severe hepatic impairment 
− 
− 
− 
− 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Special care should be taken when calculating the dose. Before each administration, it should be 
verified that the correct strength and syringe are used (see section 4.2). 
Glibenclamide should not be used in patients with insulin-dependent type 1 diabetes mellitus with 
evidence of auto-immune destruction of beta cells. 
Patients with G6PD enzyme deficiency 
In patients carrying a G6PD enzyme deficiency, cases of acute haemolytic anaemia have been reported 
with glibenclamide. It should therefore not be prescribed for these patients, and the use of an 
alternative treatment is strongly recommended, if available. If there is no alternative, the decision for 
each patient must consider the danger of haemolysis and the potential benefit expected from the 
treatment. If it is necessary to prescribe this medicinal product, screening should be conducted for the 
occurrence of any haemolysis. 
Ketoacidosis 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Neonatal  diabetes  is  a  life-threatening  and  chronically  debilitating  condition  due  to  hyperglycemia, 
which includes symptoms such like thirst, frequent urination, and dehydration. In severe cases this is 
associated with ketoacidosis which can led to death. Glibenclamide should not be used to treate this life-
threatening condition. Continuous intravenous insulin injection and intravenous infusion of physiologic 
sodium chloride solution remains the benchmark treatment. 
Hypoglycaemia 
Hypoglycaemia can occur under treatment with hypoglycaemic sulphonamides. This can sometimes 
be severe and prolonged. Hospitalisation may then prove necessary and glucose may have to be 
administered for several days. 
Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting 
In some patients, there may be an initial diarrhoea when the dose of glibenclamide suspension is 
increased but it settles if the dose is maintained. 
In case of nausea glycaemia seems to be maintained and insulin does not need to be re-introduced until 
the patient is able to take the glibenclamide suspension. 
If there is major vomiting, a fast-acting insulin should be used to treat the patient until vomiting stops. 
If there is minor vomiting, an antivomiting medicinal product should be given and treatment with 
glibenclamide can be continued. 
Biological analyses 
Blood-glucose should be monitored periodically throughout treatment with glibenclamide. If the 
blood-glucose level exceeds 16.5 mmol/L, the presence of ketonuria or ketonaemia must also be 
checked. If ketone bodies are present, an insulin injection must be given rapidly to restore the 
metabolic situation. 
The glycosylated haemoglobin level should be measured every three months to assess the child’s 
metabolic equilibrium. 
Renal impairment 
Patients with renal impairment should be monitored periodically during treatment due to the increased 
risk of hypoglycaemia. Dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment 
(refer to section 4.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
Patients with hepatic impairment should be monitored periodically during treatment due to the 
increased risk of hypoglycaemia. Dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate 
hepatic impairment (refer to section 4.2). 
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains 2.8 mg of sodium per mL oral suspension, equivalent to 0.1% of the 
WHO recommended daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. To be taken into consideration by patients 
on a controlled sodium diet. 
Benzoic acid and benzoates (sodium benzoate) 
This medicinal product contains 5 mg benzoate salt in each mL oral suspension. 
Increase in bilirubinaemia following its displacement from albumin may increase neonatal jaundice 
which may develop into kernicterus (non-conjugated bilirubin deposits in the brain tissue). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No interaction studies have been performed for the two oral suspensions of glibenclamide (0.6 mg/mL 
and 6 mg/mL). 
Hypoglycaemia may occur when taking other medicinal products. 
Highly protein-bound medicinal products, which may also potentiate the hypoglycaemic action of 
glibenclamide due to glibenclamide displacement from plasma proteins, include oral anticoagulants, 
phenytoin, salicylates and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. 
Weakening of the blood-glucose-lowering effect and, thus, raised blood-glucose levels may occur 
when taking other medicinal products. 
Under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, 
guanethidine, and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation to hypoglycaemia may be 
reduced or absent. The symptoms of hypoglycaemia may also be milder or absent where 
hypoglycaemia develops gradually or where there is autonomic neuropathy. 
In very rare cases, an intolerance to alcohol may occur. Both acute and chronic alcohol intake, or 
excessive alcohol ingestion by people who drink occasionally, may attenuate the hypoglycaemic effect 
of glibenclamide or dangerously potentiate it by delaying its metabolic inactivation. Disulfiram-like 
reactions have occurred very rarely following the concomitant use of alcohol and glibenclamide. 
Glibenclamide may increase ciclosporin plasma concentration and potentially lead to its increased 
toxicity. Monitoring and dose adjustment of ciclosporin are therefore recommended when both 
medicinal products are co-administered. 
Colesevelam binds to glibenclamide and reduces glibenclamide absorption from the gastrointestinal 
tract. No interaction was observed when glibenclamide was taken at least 4 hours before colesevelam. 
Therefore, glibenclamide should be administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
General aspects 
AMGLIDIA is indicated for the treatment of neonatal diabetes in newborns, infants and children.  
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential planning a pregnancy should be switched from oral glibenclamide to 
insulin. Glibenclamide should not be given during pregnancy. 
Pregnancy 
Based on a limited amount of published data, the use of glibenclamide during the first trimester does 
not seem to cause an increase in congenital malformations. With respect to the second and third 
trimester published data did not find fetotoxic effects. 
Animal studies do not indicate a teratogenic potential. 
Glibenclamide crosses the placenta mostly in small amounts; however, transfer is highly variable 
among patients. 
In pregnant women insulin is recommended for blood sugar control. Breast-feeding 
Published data from 11 glibenclamide-treated mothers indicate that glibenclamide is not excreted in 
human milk and hypoglycaemia in the breast-fed newborns was not reported. Breast-feeding seems to 
be compatible, but as a precautious measure monitoring of the fully breast-fed infant’s blood sugar 
level is advisable. 
Fertility 
Clinical data are not available. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Glibenclamide has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines since it may increase 
the risk of hypoglycaemia. This may not be relevant for the target population. However, reduced 
alertness may also be of concern when participating in road traffic (e.g. cycling) or in play (e.g. 
skateboarding). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequent adverse reactions are hypoglycaemia, transitory diarrhoea and abdominal pain. The 
most serious adverse reaction is hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4). 
Overall, the safety profile of glibenclamide is in line with the safety profile of others sulfonylureas. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions reported with glibenclamide (oral suspension or crushed tablets) in children, in the 
frame of treatment of neonatal diabetes are listed below by system organ class and frequency 
grouping. Frequencies are defined as:  
Very common (≥ 1/10);  
Common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10);  
Uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100);  
Rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000);  
Very rare (< 1/10,000);  
not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).  
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
The following adverse reactions have been observed in a clinical study (Neogli study) and during the 
extension phase. This was a phase II, single-centre, prospective, open-label, non-randomised study. 
After enrolment, patients continued taking their usual doses of glibenclamide tablets for 1 month. Ten 
patients were switched to glibenclamide oral suspension and treatment with oral suspension continued 
for 3 months. 
Hypoglycaemia 
Two cases of severe hypoglycaemia were observed, which were considered related to the medicinal 
product. Symptomatic measures were taken and the situation resolved in the two cases. 
Transitory diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pain and dyspepsia 
Two children had abdominal pain (one with transient diarrhoea and vomiting during the same episode) 
that were considered related to the medicinal product. Symptomatic measures were taken and the 
medicinal product continued and the situation resolved in the two cases. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
One child had dyspepsia, which was considered related to the medicinal product. Symptomatic 
measures were taken and the situation resolved. 
Neutropenia and transitory increased transaminases 
One child had punctually low leucocytes level, but close to the normal range (neutrophils 
1.3×103/microliter for a lower limit of normal of 1.5×103/microliter). 
The same child had a transient and minimal ASAT 73 IU/L, and ALAT 42 IU/L increased (normal 
range below 60 and 40 respectively). These resolved subsequently. 
Skin disorders 
One child experienced isolated skin rash. 
The following other adverse reaction has been collected from post marketing sources.  
Eye disorders 
One child experienced filmy vision: Visual disturbances can be due to fluid moving into and out of the 
eye due to high blood sugar levels.  
The following adverse effects have been observed in adult patients treated with other products 
containing glibenclamide. These adverse effects have been not observed with AMGLIDIA but may 
occur:  
Eye disorders  
Transient visual disturbances (blurred vision or accommodation disorder) have been reported, 
especially early in treatment without glycaemic variation. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
In isolated cases photosensitivity may occur. 
Skin rash, pruritus, urticaria, allergic skin reaction, bullous eruptions, exfoliative dermatitis and 
erythema multiforme have occasionally been reported in adults. 
Immune system disorders 
Anaphylactic reaction including dyspnoea, hypotension and shock have been reported. 
Blood disorders 
Blood affections have been observed, generally reversible when treatment stops. 
Hypereosinophilia, leucopenia, mild or severe thrombocytopenia have been reported, which can lead 
to purpura. Rare cases of agranulocytosis, haemolytic anaemia, bone marrow aplasia and pancytopenia 
have also been reported. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overdose of sulphonamides can result in hypoglycaemia. 
The symptoms of moderate hypoglycaemia, without loss of consciousness or neurological signs, must 
be completely corrected by taking sugar, adjusting the dose and/or changing dietary behaviour. Close 
monitoring of blood-glucose by the patient’s family must be continued until the family and the 
physician, if he/she had to be contacted, are certain that the patient is out of danger. 
Severe hypoglycaemic reactions, with coma, convulsions or other neurological disorders are possible 
and are medical emergencies requiring immediate treatment as soon as the cause is diagnosed or 
suspected before immediately admitting the patient to hospital. 
If a hypoglycaemic coma is diagnosed or suspected, the patient should quickly receive an intravenous 
injection of concentrated glucose solution (0.5 g/kg body weight as a 30% glucose solution). This must 
be followed by continuous infusion of more dilute glucose solution (10%) at the rate needed to 
maintain blood-glucose above 100 mg/dL (100 mg/dL = 5.5 mmol/L). Patients must be closely 
monitored for at least 48 hours and, depending on the patient's condition at this time, the physician 
will decide if additional monitoring is necessary. 
Plasma clearance of glibenclamide may be prolonged in patients suffering from liver disease. Due to 
strong binding of glibenclamide to proteins, dialysis is of no benefit to the patient.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, sulphonylureas, ATC code: A10BB01  
Mechanism of action 
Sulphonylureas  act on pancreatic beta-cells by inhibiting ATP-sensitive potassium channels. The 
mechanisms of action proposed for this effect include stimulation of insulin release by beta-cells of the 
pancreas. 
The minimum active concentration for the effect is considered to be 30-50  ng/mL glibenclamide.  
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Glibenclamide, a second-generation, short half-life sulphonylurea, is a hypoglycaemic agent that 
reduces blood-glucose by stimulating insulin release by the pancreas; this effect depends on the 
presence of active beta-cells or beta-cells made active by glibenclamide in the pancreatic islets in 
certain cases of neonatal diabetes. 
Stimulation of insulin secretion by glibenclamide in response to a meal is of major significance. 
Administering glibenclamide to a diabetic enhances the post-prandial insulinotropic response. 
Post-prandial responses involving secretion of insulin and peptide-C continue to be enhanced after at 
least 6 months of treatment and even over many years in the case of neonatal diabetes by potassium 
channel disorders. 
Glibenclamide has been shown to be effective in patients with mutations in the genes coding for the 
β-cell ATP-sensitive potassium channel and chromosome 6q24-related transient neonatal diabetes 
mellitus. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Treatment using sulphonylureas in neonatal diabetes linked to potassium channel disorders is 
supported by published studies showing measurable improvements in glycaemic control and 
suggesting neuro-psychomotor and neuro-psychological deficiencies, which are greater in younger 
patients. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
From data published in the literature, treatment with sulfonylurea is reported to be successful in 
approximately 90% of the patients with neonatal diabetes associated with K-ATP channel mutations. 
The average dose reported in the literature (clinical studies and case reports) is of approximately 
0.5mg/kg/day. When limited to clinical studies or prospective data collections only, the average dose 
decreases to 0.2 to 0.3 mg/kg/day. Higher doses have occasionally been reported in the literature with 
doses as high as 2.8 mg/kg/day without undesirable effects and with full transfer off insulin. 
In a phase II, single-centre, prospective, open-label, non-randomised study, acceptability, efficiency 
and tolerance of the switch from crushed tablets to glibenclamide suspension were measured. Ten 
patients (7 boys/3 girls) with KCNJ11 mutation, with median age 2.7 years (0.3 to 16.2) and median 
duration of glibenclamide therapy 2.3 years (6 days to 11.3 years) were treated. 
Daily doses ranged from 0.1 to 0.8 mg/kg for glibenclamide tablets (median dose, 0.3 mg/kg) and 
from 0.1 to 0.6 mg/kg for oral suspension (median 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg/day over the study period) given 
in 2 to 4 administration per day). 
After switching from glibenclamide tablets to glibenclamide suspension, there was no significant 
change in glycaemic control as evidenced from the similar serum HbA1c (6.5 vs 6.1% at Visits M0 
and M4, respectively; p=0.076) and fructosamine (283.4 vs 271.2 µmol/L at Visits M0 and M4, 
respectively; p=0.55) mean concentrations. 
None of patients experienced deterioration in glycaemic control, defined as an increase of HbA1c by 
> 0.5% and exceeding 5.6% in patients with baseline HbA1c ≤ 5.6% or an increase of HbA1c by 
> 0.5% in patients with baseline HbA1c > 5.6%. 
A large international long-term term study of treatment for neonatal diabetes due to KCNJ11 
mutations is ongoing and results were reported in 81 patients of the 90 patients originally included 
with a median [interquartile range] follow-up duration of 10.2 years [9.3-10.8 years]. Transfer to 
sulfonylureas occurred in childhood with a median [IQR] at transfer of 4.8 years [1.7 – 11.4 years]. 
Seventy-five patients (93%) remained on sulphonylurea alone at most recent follow-up and 6/81(7%) 
were on sulphonylurea and daily insulin. In patients on sulphonylurea alone, blood glucose control has 
been improved after transfer to sulfonylureas with median [IQR] HbA1c of 5.9% [5.4-6.5%] at 1 year 
vs 8.0 % [7.2-9.2 %] before transfer (p < 0.0001), and remained very well controlled after 10 years 
with a median [IQR] HbA1c of 6.4% [5.9-7.2 %]. 
The median [IQR] dose of sulfonylurea fell over the follow-up with a median [IQR] dose of 
0.30 mg/kg/day [0.14-0.53] mg/kg/day at one year and of 0.23 mg/kg/day [0.12-0.41 mg/kg/day] at 10 
years,  p=0.03).  There  were  no  reported  episodes  of  severe  hypoglycaemia.  Adverse  reactions 
(diarrhoea/nausea/reduced  appetite/abdominal  pain)  were  reported  in  10/81(12%);  these  were 
transient, and no patients discontinued sulphonylurea as a result. Microvascular complications were 
reported in 7/81(9%) patients; there were no macrovascular complications. Patients with complications 
were older at age of transfer to sulfonylurea than those without complications (median age at transfer: 
20.5  v  4.1  years,  p=0.0005).  Oral  glucose  tolerance  tests  and  intravenous  glucose  tolerance  tests 
revealed good insulin response to glucose and maintained incretin effect after ten years. 
Evidence  exists  that  administration  of  glibenclamide  might  improve  some  neurological  deficits  in 
patients with neonatal-onset diabetes due to KCNJ11 or ABCC8 mutations like epilepsy, motor function 
and hypotonia, by a mechanism independent from insulin secretion.  
Earlier treatment initiation might be associated with greater benefits. 
5.2 
Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
After oral administration, glibenclamide is absorbed rapidly and induces its effect within 2.5 hours 
with a duration of up to 15 hours, although the elimination half-life is 5 to 10 hours. The food effect on 
the speed or the level of absorption of glibenclamide oral suspension has not been investigated. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bioavailability studies have demonstrated that nonmicronised tablets provide serum glibenclamide 
concentrations that are not bioequivalent to those from micronised tablets. 
Head to head comparative pharmacokinetic data following the application of glibenclamide suspension 
and micronised tablets are not available. The conversion rate between micronised tablets and the 
suspension has not been established. 
A comparative study of relative bioavailability between two suspensions of glibenclamide oral 
suspensions (0.6 mg/mL and 6 mg/mL) and crushed glibenclamide tablets (Daonil 5 mg) showed that 
when glibenclamide oral suspensions were administered, peak plasma concentrations of glibenclamide 
are reached 0.5 hours earlier than that observed with the crushed Daonil tablet (median value after 
administration is 2.5 hours compared to 3 hours). The values for maximum plasma concentrations 
(Cmax) were similar for the two suspensions (201.71 ± 71.43 ng/mL for the 6 mg/mL suspension and 
206.93 ± 67.33 ng/mL for the 0.6 mg/mL suspension). These values were approx. 40% greater than 
those obtained for the crushed tablet (148.34 ± 46.74 ng/mL). 
The exposures were respectively similar for the two glibenclamide oral suspensions, and greater than 
those observed after administration of crushed Daonil tablets. The relative bioavailability was 121.6% 
for the 0.6 mg/mL suspension and 114.1% for the 6 mg/mL suspension compared to the crushed 
Daonil tablets. 
Population pharmacokinetic approach was used to compare steady state concentrations following 
0.9 mg twice daily in children with body weights between 10 – 30 kg and 1.25 mg twice daily in 
adults. The plasma glibenclamide levels in the simulated paediatric population were approximately 
30%-60% lower than the adult levels. With smaller bodyweight the concentration increased but 
exceeded the adult plasma levels in minimal extents only for poor metabolizers. 
Distribution 
Glibenclamide is strongly bound to plasma albumin (99%), which may account for certain drug 
interactions, but is not easily detached by acidic medicinal products. 
Biotransformation and elimination 
Glibenclamide is completely metabolised by the liver into 3 inactive metabolites excreted via bile 
(60%) and urine (40%); elimination is complete in 45 to 72 hours. Clinical studies appear to suggest 
that CYP2C9 contributes significantly to glibenclamide metabolism in vivo. 
Liver failure reduces the metabolism of glibenclamide and therefore significantly slows down its 
elimination.Biliary excretion of the metabolites increases in the event of kidney failure, proportionally 
to the severity of the change in renal function. Kidney failure does not affect its elimination as long as 
creatinine clearance remains above 30 ml/min. 
The elimination half-lives were similar for the two suspensions (almost 8 hours) and a little shorter 
than those observed with the crushed Daonil tablets. 
5.3 
Preclinical safety data 
In repeated dose toxicity studies with oral administration of high doses of glibenclamide, effects on 
pancreatic beta-cells were observed (enlargement of the islets of Langerhans with irregularly 
configured islets and reduction in pancreatic β-cell granulation in rats at doses of ≥ 30 mg/kg/day, 
beta-cell exhaustion as indicated by depletion of insulin-containing granules in rabbits at doses of 
100 mg/kg/day).

AMGLIDIA is a suspension to be administered with a provided oral syringe graduated in mL. 
Healthcare professionals or patients should never use another syringe than the one provided in 
the box to avoid dosing errors which could result in serious harm. 
AMGLIDIA is available in four different boxes corresponding to four different pack sizes (four 
different strengths): 
One box for the 0.6 mg/mL strength with one 1 mL syringe: yellow colour for outer carton and 
reverse type yellow colour for label 
One box for the 0.6 mg/mL strength with one 5 mL syringe: yellow colour for outer carton and 
reverse type yellow colour for label 
One box for the 6 mg/mL strength with one syringe of 1 mL: purple colour for outer carton and 
reverse type purple colour for label 
One box for the 6 mg/mL strength with one syringe of 5 mL: purple colour for outer carton and 
reverse type purple colour for label 
The choice of the AMGLIDIA strength should be defined according to the prescribed posology 
and the patient’s body weight. 
The AMGLIDIA 0.6 mg/mL strength should not be used for posology higher than 
0.6 mg/kg/day to limit the exposure to the sodium benzoate excipient. Please read the posology 
and method of administration in the SmPC attached to this prescriber’s guide. 
Choice of the syringe to be used: 
After the total daily dose and the strength to be used have been defined, the frequency of the 
daily administration should be pointed out and the corresponding volume per administration 
should be calculated. 
Depending on the volume calculated per administration: 
If the volume per administration is 1 mL or below, the 1 mL syringe should be prescribed; 
If the volume per administration is more than 1 mL, the 5 mL syringe should be prescribed. 
The prescription should state the calculated daily dose in mL, the strength of AMGLIDIA to be 
used, the number of administrations over which the daily dose is divided, as well as the volume 
in mL to be administered for each dose and the size of the syringe to be used. 
Patients and/or their caretakers should be explained that: 
They are prescribed a dose of AMGLIDIA in mL according to their body weight. This dose is to 
be administrated with a provided oral syringe graduated in mL. 
There are 2 pack sizes for a same strength: one with a syringe of 1mL and one with a syringe of 
5 mL. 
Patients or their caretakers should be reminded to use the correct syringe as stated in their 
prescription. 
If the patient is prescribed a different pack size, the prescriber should highlight to the patient the 
packaging differences between the different pack sizes (focus on colour differentiation, warning 
statements on carton, thickness and length of the provided syringe).

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What AMGLIDIA is and what it is used for 
Amglidia contains the active substance called glibenclamide which belongs to a group of medicines 
called sulphonylureas used for lowering blood sugar (blood-glucose). 
Amglidia is used in newborns, infants and children to treat diabetes that occurs at birth (known as 
neonatal diabetes mellitus). Neonatal diabetes is a disease where the child’s body does not release 
enough insulin to control the level of blood sugar; Amglidia is used only in patients who still have 
some ability to make insulin. 
Sulphonylureas like glibenclamide have been shown to be effective in certain genetic mutations 
responsible for the genesis of neonatal diabetes. 
This medicine is an oral suspension, to be taken by mouth, which is a more convenient treatment for 
newborns and children compared to regular injections of insulin. 
You must talk to a doctor if your child does not feel better or if he/she feels worse after a few days. 
2.  What you need to know before you give AMGLIDIA  
Do not give AMGLIDIA 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
if your child is allergic to glibenclamide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). 
if your child has ketoacidosis (high blood levels of acid substances called ketones). 
if your child suffers from porphyria (inability to break down body chemicals called 
porphyrins). 
if your child is treated with bosentan, e.g. a medicine used to treat problems of blood 
circulation. 
if your child suffers from severe renal dysfunction.  
if your child suffers from severe liver dysfunction 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before your child is given Amglidia. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Your child’s blood sugar levels may become too low (hypoglycaemia) after taking Amglidia. Tell the 
doctor  if  your  child  is  pale,  sweating,  has  irregular  heart  rhythm  or  seems  disoriented,  confused  or 
unresponsive. See also section 4. Too low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia). 
Ask your doctor to determine at which frequency capillary blood sugar should be checked. 
G6PD  is  an  enzyme  evolved  in  sugar  metabolism.  If  your  child  carries  a  G6PD  enzyme  deficiency, 
he/she  may  experiment  an  abnormal  breakdown  of  red  blood  cells  (acute  haemolytic  anaemia)  after 
taking Amglidia. 
Tell the doctor if you know that your child is affected by G6PD deficiency and contact him/her if you 
notice that your child is pale as compared to usually. 
Tell your doctor if your child suffers from renal or liver disorders. 
Your child may experience diarrhoea when the dose of glibenclamide suspension is increased but it 
will be transitory if the dose is maintained. 
Your child may experience nausea. If your child is able to take the glibenclamide suspension, do not 
stop the treatment.  
Talk to your doctor if your child experienced vomiting, the doctor may decide to treat your child with 
insulin until vomiting stops in case of major vomiting.  
The doctor may also decide to treat your child with an anti-vomiting medicine in case of minor 
vomiting. In this case, Amglidia will be continue.  
Children and adolescents 
Amglidia is to be used for newborns, infants and children.

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
AMGLIDIA with alcohol 
Both acute and chronic alcohol intake may reduce the sugar lowering effect of glibenclamide or 
dangerously potentiate it by delaying its breakdown in the body. Nausea, vomiting, flushing, dizziness, 
headache, chest and abdominal discomfort, and general hangover-like symptoms among others have 
occurred following the concomitant use of alcohol and glibenclamide. Concomitant use of alcohol and 
glibenclamide should be avoided. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
This medicine may only be used for the treatment of neonatal diabetes in newborns, infants and 
children. 
This medicine is not intended to be used in pregnant women and patients planning a pregnancy should 
inform their doctor. It is recommended that such patients change treatment to insulin. 
Breast-feeding seems to be compatible, but as a precautious measure monitoring of the fully breast-fed 
infant’s blood sugar level is advisable. 
Talk to your doctor about the best way to control your blood sugar in case of pregnancy. 
Driving and using machines 
Glibenclamide may increase the risk of low blood sugar and therefore have a moderate influence on 
the ability to drive, to take part in road traffic otherwise or use machines. 
You or your child should avoid activities requiring balance (for example, cycling or skateboarding) 
and driving or using machines if you or your child fee dizzy, tired or unwell. 
AMGLIDIA contains sodium  
This medicine contains 2.80 mg of sodium per mL, equivalent to 0.1% of the WHO recommended 
daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. To be taken into consideration by patients who have been 
advised to follow a  low salt (sodium) diet. 
AMGLIDIA contains benzoate salt 
This medicine contains 5 mg benzoate salt in each mL oral suspension. Benzoate salt may increase 
jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes) in newborn babies (up to 4 weeks old). 
3.  How to give AMGLIDIA 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Dose 
Glibenclamide therapy should be started by a doctor experienced in the treatment of patients with very 
early onset diabetes. 
The dose of Amglidia depends on your child’s body weight, and will be calculated by the doctor as an 
amount (volume) in mL oral suspension to be measured with the oral syringe (either an 1 mL or a 
5 mL syringe) supplied with the medicine. Your doctor will prescribe the specific pack size and 
strength including the particular syringe you should use. Do not use any other syringe to administer 
Amglidia. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is important you do not adjust yourself the doses of either Amglidia or insulin, unless specifically 
directed to do so by your child’s doctor. 
Make sure that you use correct strength of the medicine and the appropriate oral syringe prescribed by 
your doctor to avoid accidental administration of too high or too low amounts. 
The starting dose of Amglidia is 0.2 mg of glibenclamide for each kilogram (kg) of body weight daily, 
divided in two doses of 0.1 mg/kg. As the dose is increased, it is usually possible to reduce and then 
stop the dose of insulin the patient is already receiving. 
Higher doses of mglidiacan be given as needed and administered in up to four intakes per day based 
on blood-glucose monitoring, as per titration recommendations given by the referring doctor. 
In case of minor vomiting, an antivomiting medicine will be prescribed by your doctor and Amglidia 
can be continued. 
As generally recommended in such situations, if vomiting occurs less than 30 minutes following 
administration of Amglidia, a new dose can be given. If vomiting occurs more than 30 minutes 
following administration of Amglidia, no new dose should be given. Always ask your child’s doctor 
for advice in such circumstances. 
In case of major vomiting, ketonaemia and ketonuria should be closely monitored by the treating 
doctor. The doctor may start insulin therapy again, when ketonaemia or ketonuria were found to be 
responsible for the major vomiting. In case of inability of food or beverage intake, the child should go 
to emergency department to get an insulin and glucose perfusion until vomiting stops. 
Method of administration 
Always give the medicine 15 minutes before feeding. 
The medicine should be given at the same times each day. 
In case of milk feeding, recommendation is given to administer the suspension 15 minutes before 
child’s milk feeding. 
This medicine is a ready-for-use oral suspension to be given with a marked oral syringe. Only the oral 
syringe included in the carton should be used. 
The 1 mL syringe is thin and small and graduated in steps of 0.05 mL. The 5 mL syringe is thick and 
long and graduated in steps of 0.1 mL. 
Instructions for use 
The dose is measured by drawing the plunger of the syringe back until it reaches the marking for the 
dose the doctor has prescribed for your child. The dose in mL per administration and the number of 
administrations per day have to carefully follow the medical prescription. 
While the child is awake, position the child in half-sitting position in the hollow of your arm, with the 
child’s head resting on your arm. 
Slip about the first 1 cm of the syringe into the child’s mouth and place it against the inside cheek; Let 
the child suck. If the child does not suck, slowly press the plunger of the syringe so that the suspension 
trickles into the mouth. 
Do not lay the child down directly after administration. It is recommended to wait for the child has 
swallowed the medicine before reverting back to lying position.

Insert the adaptor firmly into the bottle while holding the bottle the right way up. 
Replace the screw cap on the bottle with the adaptor. 
Retighten the screw cap to push the adaptor well into the bottle. 
For each administration 
The bottle does not need to be shaken before administration. The medicine is 
administered as a ready-for-use oral suspension to be given using a specific marked 
syringe. 
Open the bottle by unscrewing the child-resistant closure while pressing downwards (figure 1). 
Holding the bottle the right way up, insert the syringe firmly into the adaptor fitted to the bottle 
(figure 2). 
Turn the bottle with the syringe upside down (figure 3). 
Draw back the plunger to obtain the desired volume (figure 4A). Then push the plunger to 
remove as many air bubbles as possible from the syringe (figure 4B). Finally, draw back the 
plunger until graduation corresponding to the prescribed dose in ml (figure 4C). 
Note: if air gets into the syringe, empty the syringe into the bottle and start the procedure again. 
Turn the bottle with the syringe into its upright position. 
Remove the syringe from the adaptor. Put the syringe into the child mouth and push the plunger 
to slowly administer the medicine into the mouth. 
Close the bottle by tightening the screw cap well on top of the adaptor. 
The bottle must be closed after each use and stored for a maximum of 30 days. 
The syringe must be rinsed thoroughly with water, wiped dry after each use and replaced back 
into the medicine’s carton. The oral syringe in the carton should be used only with this 
medicine. 
If you give more AMGLIDIA to your child than you should 
See your doctor, nurse or your hospital pharmacist immediately. 
There is a risk of hypoglycaemia. You should check capillary blood sugar of your child and follow the 
instructions described in section 4. 
If you forget to give AMGLIDIA 
If you forget to give Amglidia, there is a risk of high blood sugar. 
You must check your child’s blood sugar (capillary blood sugar) and give Amglidia as soon as you 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
realise you have forgotten to use it. If your child’s capillary blood sugar exceeds 3 g/L (or 300 mg/dL 
or 16.5 mmol/L), check for the presence of ketonuria with a finger stick or urine stick tests according 
to your child’s doctor recommendations. If ketonuria is detected, you must inject insulin immediately 
according to the procedure defined beforehand with your child’s doctor and contact him/her or his/her 
team for advice. 
Do not give a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you stop giving AMGLIDIA 
There is a risk of high blood sugar. 
You should check your child’s blood sugar (capillary blood sugar). Diabetes symptoms may reappear 
and may lead to a serious disturbance of the body’s metabolism with high blood levels of ketones 
(ketoacidosis), dehydration and disturbance of the balance of acids in the body. You should therefore 
never stop the medicine without checking with the doctor looking after your child. Seek advice from 
your doctor. 
You will be requested to bring back remaining Amglidia oral suspension to your doctor at each 
consultation. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask the doctor of your child or 
pharmacist.

Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Serious side effects 
Too low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) (very common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people) 
If you take Amglidia, you are at risk of getting too low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia). The signs of too 
low blood sugar may include: 
- 
- 
shaking, sweating, feeling very anxious or confused, fast heart beat 
excessive hunger, headache 
If your child starts to become pale, sweating, has irregular heart rhythm or seems disoriented, confused 
or unresponsive, these may be signs that the child’s blood sugar is too low ; you should first solve the 
situation as explained below and you should then talk to your child’s doctor to adapt Amglidia’s dose. 
The risk of low blood sugar is increased if the medicine is not taken with a meal, is taken with alcohol, 
or if combined with certain medicines(see section 2 Other medicines and Amglidia). Such low blood 
sugar should be managed by taking sugar by mouth followed by a snack or meal. If very low blood 
sugar occurs that affects consciousness, emergency services should be called and an intravenous 
glucose injection performed. After such a severe episode of hypoglycaemia, the child and family 
should see the child’s doctor to check the appropriateness of the dose of glibenclamide suspension. 
Eye disorders (common: may affect up to 1 in 10 people): 
- 
Filmy vision in case of high blood glucose levels (hyperglycaemia) 
Gastro intestinal disorders (very common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people): 
- 
- 
- 
Transitory diarrhoea 
Abdominal (belly) pain 
Vomiting 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
Stomach ache (Dyspepsia) 
Teeth problems (common: may affect up to 1 in 10 people): 
- 
Tooth discolouration. 
Skin disorders (very common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people): 
- 
Skin rash  
Abnormal blood test results (very common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people) 
Laboratory blood tests may show changes in blood cells (decrease in white blood cells: neutropenia) 
and effects on liver function (brief increase in enzymes called transaminases). 
Other side effects: 
Some other side effects have been observed in adults treated with other medicinal products containing 
glibenclamide. The following side effects have not been observed with Amglidia. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Allergic reactions: which may be serious in isolated cases, including difficulties to breath, low 
blood pressure and shock If your child presents any of these symptoms, you should immediately 
go to the nearest emergency department 
Skin rash: itching, nettle rash (urticarial), allergic skin reaction, blistering of the skin, skin 
inflammation. 
Increase in sensitivity of the skin to sunlight 
Transient visual disturbances. 
Other laboratory blood tests changes: increased levels of the white blood cells called eosinophils 
(hypereosinophilia), mild to severe decrease in blood components called platelets 
(thrombocytopenia), which can lead to subcutaneous bleeding (purpura). 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you notice any of the listed side effects:

1.  What AMGLIDIA is and what it is used for 
Amglidia contains the active substance called glibenclamide which belongs to a group of medicines 
called sulphonylureas used for lowering blood sugar (blood-glucose). 
Amglidia is used in newborns, infants and children to treat diabetes that occurs at birth (known as 
neonatal diabetes mellitus). Neonatal diabetes is a disease where the child’s body does not release 
enough insulin to control the level of blood sugar; Amglidia is used only in patients who still have 
some ability to make insulin. 
Sulphonylureas like glibenclamide have been shown to be effective in certain genetic mutations 
responsible for the genesis of neonatal diabetes. 
This medicine is an oral suspension, to be taken by mouth, which is a more convenient treatment for 
newborns and children compared to regular injections of insulin. 
You must talk to a doctor if your child does not feel better or if he/she feels worse after a few days. 
2.  What you need to know before you give AMGLIDIA Do not give AMGLIDIA 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
if your child is allergic to glibenclamide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). 
if your child has ketoacidosis (high blood levels of acid substances called ketones). 
if your child suffers from porphyria (inability to break down body chemicals called 
porphyrins). 
if your child is treated with bosentan, e.g. a medicine used to treat problems of blood 
circulation. 
if your child suffers from severe renal dysfunction. 
if your child suffers from severe liver dysfunction. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before your child is given Amglidia. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Your child’s blood sugar levels may become too low (hypoglycaemia) after taking Amglidia. Tell the 
doctor  if  your  child  is  pale,  sweating,  has  irregular  heart  rhythm  or  seems  disoriented,  confused  or 
unresponsive. See also section 4. Too low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia). 
Ask your doctor to determine at which frequency capillary blood sugar should be checked. 
G6PD  is  an  enzyme  evolved  in  sugar  metabolism.  If  your  child  carries  a  G6PD  enzyme  deficiency, 
he/she  may  experiment  an  abnormal  breakdown  of  red  blood  cells  (acute  haemolytic  anaemia)  after 
taking Amglidia. 
Tell the doctor if you know that your child is affected by G6PD deficiency and contact him/her if you 
notice that your child is pale as compared to usually. 
Tell your doctor if your child suffers from renal or liver disorders. 
Your child may experience diarrhoea when the dose of glibenclamide suspension is increased but it 
will be transitory if the dose is maintained. 
Your child may experience nausea. If your child is able to take the glibenclamide suspension, do not 
stop the treatment.  
Talk to your doctor if your child experienced vomiting, the doctor may decide to treat your child with 
insulin until vomiting stops in case of major vomiting.  
The doctor may also decide to treat your child with an anti-vomiting medicine in case of minor 
vomiting. In this case, Amglidia will be continue.  
Children and adolescents 
Amglidia is to be used for newborns, infants and children.

AMGLIDIA with alcohol 
Both acute and chronic alcohol intake may reduce the sugar lowering effect of glibenclamide or 
dangerously potentiate it by delaying its breakdown in the body. Nausea, vomiting, flushing, dizziness, 
headache, chest and abdominal discomfort, and general hangover-like symptoms among others have 
occurred following the concomitant use of alcohol and glibenclamide. Concomitant use of alcohol and 
glibenclamide should be avoided. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
This medicine may only be used for the treatment of neonatal diabetes in newborns, infants and 
children. 
This medicine is not intended to be used in pregnant women and patients planning a pregnancy should 
inform their doctor. It is recommended that such patients change treatment to insulin. 
Breast-feeding seems to be compatible, but as a precautious measure monitoring of the fully breast-fed 
infant’s blood sugar level is advisable. 
Talk to your doctor about the best way to control your blood sugar in case of pregnancy. 
Driving and using machines 
Glibenclamide may increase the risk of low blood sugar and therefore have a moderate influence on 
the ability to drive, to take part in road traffic otherwise or use machines. 
You or your child should avoid activities requiring balance (for example, cycling or skateboarding) 
and driving or using machines if you or your child fee dizzy, tired, or unwell. 
AMGLIDIA contains sodium  
This medicine contains 2.80 mg of sodium per mL, equivalent to 0.1% of the WHO recommended 
daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. To be taken into consideration by patients who have been 
advised to follow a low salt (sodium) diet. 
AMGLIDIA contains benzoate salt 
This medicine contains 5 mg benzoate salt in each mL oral suspension. Benzoate salt may increase 
jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes) in newborn babies (up to 4 weeks old). 
3.  How to give AMGLIDIA 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Dose 
Glibenclamide therapy should be started by a doctor experienced in the treatment of patients with very 
early onset diabetes. 
The dose of Amglidia depends on your child’s body weight, and will be calculated by the doctor as an 
amount (volume) in mL of oral suspension to be measured with the oral syringe (either an 1 mL or a 
5 mL syringe) supplied with the medicine. Your doctor will prescribe the specific pack size and 
strength including the particular syringe you should use. Do not use any other syringe to administer 
Amglidia. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is important you do not adjust yourself the doses of either Amglidia or insulin, unless specifically 
directed to do so by your child’s doctor. 
Make sure that you use correct strength of the medicine and the appropriate oral syringe prescribed by 
your doctor to avoid accidental administration of too high or too low amounts. 
The starting dose of Amglidia is 0.2 mg of glibenclamide for each kilogram (kg) of body weight daily, 
divided in two doses of 0.1 mg/kg. As the dose is increased, it is usually possible to reduce and then 
stop the dose of insulin the patient is already receiving. 
Higher doses of Amglidia can be given as needed and administered in up to four intakes per day, based 
on blood-glucose monitoring, as per titration recommendations given by the referring doctor. 
In case of minor vomiting, an antivomiting medicine will be prescribed by your doctor and Amglidia 
can be continued. 
As generally recommended in such situations, if vomiting occurs less than 30 minutes following 
administration of Amglidia, a new dose can be given. If vomiting occurs more than 30 minutes 
following administration of Amglidia, no new dose should be given. Always ask your child’s doctor 
for advice in such circumstances. 
In case of major vomiting, ketonaemia and ketonuria should be closely monitored by the treating 
doctor. The doctor may start insulin therapy again, when ketonaemia or ketonuria were found to be 
responsible for the major vomiting. In case of inability of food or beverage intake, the child should go 
to emergency department to get an insulin and glucose perfusion until vomiting stops. 
Method of administration 
Always give the medicine before feeding. 
The medicine should be given at the same time each day. 
In case of milk feeding, recommendation is given to administer the suspension 15 minutes before 
child’s milk feeding. 
This medicine is a ready-for-use oral suspension to be given with a marked oral syringe. Only the oral 
syringe included in the carton should be used. 
The 1 mL syringe is thin and small and graduated in steps of 0.05 mL. The 5 mL syringe is thick and 
long and graduated in steps of 0.1 mL. 
Instructions for use 
The dose is measured by drawing the plunger of the syringe back until it reaches the marking for the 
dose the doctor has prescribed for your child. The dose in mL per administration and the number of 
administrations per day have to carefully follow the medical prescription. 
While the child is awake, position the child in half-sitting position in the hollow of your arm, with the 
child’s head resting on your arm. 
Slip about the first 1 cm of the syringe into the child’s mouth and place it against the inside cheek; Let 
the child suck. If the child does not suck, slowly press the plunger of the syringe so that the suspension 
trickles into the mouth. 
Do not lay the child down directly after administration. It is recommended to wait for the child has 
swallowed the medicine before reverting back to lying position.

For each administration 
1. 
The bottle does not need to be shaken before administration. The medicine is 
administered as a ready-for-use oral suspension to be given using a specific marked 
syringe. 
Open the bottle by unscrewing the child-resistant closure while pressing downwards (figure 1). 
Holding the bottle the right way up, insert the syringe firmly into the adaptor fitted to the bottle 
(figure 2). 
Turn the bottle with the syringe upside down (figure 3). 
Draw back the plunger to obtain the desired volume (figure 4A). Then push the plunger to 
remove as many air bubbles as possible from the syringe (figure 4B). Finally, draw back the 
plunger until graduation corresponding to the prescribed dose in mL (figure 4C). 
Note: if air gets into the syringe, empty the syringe into the bottle and start the procedure again. 
Turn the bottle with the syringe into its upright position. 
Remove the syringe from the adaptor. Put the syringe into the child mouth and push the plunger 
to slowly administer the medicine into the mouth. 
Close the bottle by tightening the screw cap well on top of the adaptor. 
The bottle must be closed after each use and stored for a maximum of 30 days. 
The syringe must be rinsed thoroughly with water, wiped dry after each use and 
replaced back into the medicine’s carton. The oral syringe in the carton should be used 
only with this medicine.

9. 
If you give more AMGLIDIA to your child than you should 
See your doctor, nurse or your hospital pharmacist immediately. 
There is a risk of hypoglycaemia. You should check capillary blood sugar of your child and follow the 
instructions described in section 4. 
If you forget to give AMGLIDIA 
If you forget to give Amglidia, there is a risk of high blood sugar. 
You must check your child’s blood sugar (capillary blood sugar) and give Amglidia as soon as you 
realise you have forgotten to use it. If your child’s capillary blood sugar exceeds 3 g/L (or 300 mg/dL 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
or 16.5 mmol/L), check for the presence of ketonuria with a finger stick or urine stick tests according 
to your child’s doctor recommendations. If ketonuria is detected, you must inject insulin immediately 
according to the procedure defined beforehand with your child’s doctor and contact him/her or his/her 
team for advice. 
Do not give a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you stop giving AMGLIDIA 
There is a risk of high blood sugar. 
You should check your child’s blood sugar (capillary blood sugar). Diabetes symptoms may reappear 
and may lead to a serious disturbance of the body’s metabolism with high blood levels of ketones 
(ketoacidosis), dehydration and disturbance of the balance of acids in the body. You should therefore 
never stop the medicine without checking with the doctor looking after your child. Seek advice from 
your doctor. 
You will be requested to bring back remaining Amglidia oral suspension to your doctor at each 
consultation. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask the doctor of your child or 
pharmacist. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Serious side effects 
Too low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) (very common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people) 
If you take Amglidia, you are at risk of getting too low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia). The signs of too 
low blood sugar may include: 
- 
- 
shaking, sweating, feeling very anxious or confused, fast heart beat 
excessive hunger, headache 
If your child starts to become pale, sweating, has irregular heart rhythm or seems disoriented, confused 
or unresponsive, these may be signs that the child’s blood sugar is too low; you should first solve the 
situation as explained below and you should then talk to your child’s doctor to adapt Amglidia’s dose. 
The risk of low blood sugar is increased if the medicine is not taken with a meal, is taken with alcohol, 
or if combined with certain medicines (see section 2 Other medicines and Amglidia). Such low blood 
sugar should be managed by taking sugar by mouth followed by a snack or meal. If very low blood 
sugar occurs that affects consciousness, emergency services should be called and an intravenous 
glucose injection performed. After such a severe episode of hypoglycaemia, the child and family 
should see the child’s doctor to check the appropriateness of the dose of glibenclamide suspension. 
Eye disorders (common: may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
- 
Filmy vision in case of high blood glucose levels (hyperglycaemia) 
Gastro intestinal disorders (very common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people) 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Transitory diarrhoea 
Abdominal (belly) pain 
Vomiting 
Stomach ache (Dyspepsia) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Teeth problems (common: may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
- 
Tooth discolouration. 
Skin disorders (very common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people) 
- 
Skin rash  
Abnormal blood test results (very common: may affect more than 1 in 10 people) 
Laboratory blood tests may show changes in blood cells (decrease in white blood cells: neutropenia) 
and effects on liver function (brief increase in enzymes called transaminases). 
Other side effects: 
Some other side effects have been observed in adults treated with other medicinal products containing 
glibenclamide. The following side effects have not been observed with Amglidia. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Allergic reactions: which may be serious in isolated cases, including difficulties to breath, low 
blood pressure and shock. If your child presents any of these symptoms, you should 
immediately go to the nearest emergency department. 
Skin rash: itching, nettle rash (urticarial), allergic skin reaction, blistering of the skin, skin 
inflammation. 
Increase in sensitivity of the skin to sunlight. 
Transient visual disturbances. 
Other laboratory blood tests changes: increased levels of the white blood cells called eosinophils 
(hypereosinophilia), mild to severe decrease in blood components called platelets 
(thrombocytopenia) which can lead to subcutaneous bleeding (purpura). 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you notice any of the listed side effects: 
Reporting of side effects

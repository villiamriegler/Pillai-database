1. 
Introduction 
Restless Legs Syndrome is best described as a neurological sensory-motor disorder characterized by 
four  essential  diagnostic  criteria  defined  by  the  International  Restless  Legs  Syndrome  Study  Group 
(IRLSSG) in 1995 and updated in 2003.  
Patients report an irresistible leg movement that is often accompanied by creeping sensations deep in 
the limbs. The symptoms of RLS are not confined to the legs, but can also occur in the upper limbs. 
The majority of symptoms of RLS occur in the evening and at night. Lying down in bed is associated 
with  increased  paresthesia  and  an  irresistible  urge  to  move,  often  accompanied  by  periodic  limb 
movements which interfere with sleep onset and with consolidation of sleep. 
Restless  Legs  Syndrome  is  one  of  the  most  frequent  neurological  diseases,  with  an  estimated 
prevalence of 7% to 11% of the general population. 
Neupro (rotigotine) is indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of early-stage idiopathic 
Parkinson’s disease (PD) as monotherapy (i.e. without levodopa) or in combination with levodopa, i.e. 
over the course of the disease, through to late stages when the effect of levodopa wears off or becomes 
inconsistent and fluctuations of the therapeutic effect occur (end of dose or ‘on-off’ fluctuations).  
Rotigotine is a non-ergolinic dopamine agonist. It has a high in vitro affinity for all dopamine receptor 
subtypes which is particularly high for the D3 receptor, about 10-fold less for the D2 and about 100-
fold  less  for  the  D1  receptor.  It  also  has  high  intrinsic  (agonistic)  activity  on  all  dopamine  receptor 
subtypes which, again, is particularly high for the D3 subtype.  
The currently approved formulations are presented as 10 cm2, 20 cm2, 30 cm2and 40 cm2 transdermal 
patches containing respectively 4.5 mg, 9.0 mg, 13.5 mg and 18.0 mg of rotigotine, and designed to 
release respectively 2 mg, 4 mg, 6 mg and 8 mg of rotigotine per 24 hours. 
This variation refers to an extension of the therapeutic indication to include ‘symptomatic treatment of 
moderate to severe idiopathic Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) in adults’. 
In  the  proposed  extension  of  indication,  the  starting  dose  is  1  mg/24  hours,  thus  introducing  new 
dosage  of  rotigotine.  Depending  on  the  individual  patient  response,  the  dose  may  be  increased  in 
weekly increments of 1 mg/24 hours to a maximal dose of 3 mg/24 hours.  
An  extension  application  is  therefore  submitted  in  parallel  to  add  2  new  strengths  1mg/24  h  and 
3mg/24  h  of  rotigotine  (EMEA/H/C/626/X/20).  These  formulations  are  presented  as  5cm2,  15  cm2 
transdermal patches containing respectively 2.25mg and 6.75 mg of rotigotine and designed to release 
respectively 1mg and 3 mg of rotigotine per 24 hours. 
2.   Non clinical  aspects 
The pharmacokinetic and toxicological results from animal studies, supportive of the approved patches 
have  been  previously  assessed  at  the  time  of  the  initial  application  for  Neupro.  The  dose  of  18  mg  
(40 cm2 patch size, i.e 8 mg/24h), maximum therapeutic dose observed for the early stage Parkinson 
patients,  was  used  as  basis  to  calculate  the  safety  margins  of  rotigotine.  An  update  of  these 
calculations  was  made  at  the  time  of  the  application  to  extend  the  indication  to  the  advanced  stage 
Parkinson patients (EMEA/H/C/626/II/03). 
Within this variation application, a new calculation of the toxicological safety margins (see Table 1) is 
provided for the proposed maximum human dose of 6.75 mg for the treatment of RLS based on the 
mean  maximum  rotigotine  plasma  concentration  (i.e  0.58  ng/mL)  and  mean  AUC  value  (10.62 
h.ng/mL). 
2
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 1 Safety ratios at No-Observed-Effect Levels (NOELs) and Cmax and AUC in human 
plasma at the maximum therapeutic dose 
At  doses  above  the  NOEL,  the  most  prominent  systemic  effects,  such  as  effects  on  food/water 
consumption and body weight, are mainly related to the pharmacodynamic, dopamine agonistic effects 
in  healthy  animals  and/or  the  well-known  influence  of  dopamine  agonists  on  sex  hormone  (e.g. 
prolactin) secretion. 
Overall, rotigotine did not result in any target organ toxicity. With respect to the toxicological data and 
relevant non-clinical findings, the CHMP concluded that the safety ratios compared to the maximum 
intended dose in RLS patients (3 mg) were acceptable. 
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The submitted ERA included a phase II tier A analysis where the MAH concluded that no additional 
risk for the aquatic environment will result from the additional environmental exposure to rotigotine 
due to treatment of RLS patients because the trigger limits of PEC:PNEC ratios will not be exceeded 
as  the  maximum  intended  dose  for  RLS  (6.75  mg)  is  lower  than  those  previously  approved  for 
treatment of early and advanced PD patients (18 and 36 mg).  
However, the CHMP requested the MAH to further evaluate the impact occurring on the penetration 
factor (Fpen) by extending the indication to RLS  patients and on all subsequent ERA consequences 
(PECsurfacewater, PECsoil and PEC:PNEC ratios).  
Based  on  the  available  data,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  the  risk  for  the  aquatic  compartment  was 
acceptable,  given  that the calculated  PEC/PNEC  ratio  was  0.35.  However, the CHMP  requested  the 
MAH to complete the assessment of the soil compartment and to further address the calculation of the 
penetration  factor  (Fpen)  refinement  as  part  of  a  follow-up  measure.  The  CHMP  also  requested  a 
bioconcentration study in fish for which the MAH committed to. 
3. 
Clinical  aspects 
The  clinical  development  program  to  support  the  extension  of  indication  of  Neupro  to  symptomatic 
treatment of moderate to severe idiopathic RLS consisted of 8 clinical trials (see Table 2). 
The clinical trials were conducted in accordance with GCP as stated by the MAH.

Study SP666 was a proof of concept trial. Studies SP709 and SP710 were phase II trials and studies 
SP790, SP791, SP792, SP793 and SP794 were phase III trials.  
Furthermore,  additional  pharmacokinetic  and  pharmacodynamic  studies  (SP871,  SP651,  SP864, 
SP861  and  SP862)  have  been  conducted  to  evaluate  the  influence  of  the  application  site  on  the 
bioavailability of rotigotine, the potential electrocardiographic effects of rotigotine transdermal system 
and the interactions with oral contraceptives (fixed combination of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel) 
and CYP2C19 inhibitor (omeprazole). 
Pharmacokinetics 
•  Absorption 
Studies SP651 (18 mg/40 cm² single patch versus 2  x 9 mg/20 cm² patches) and SP871 (6.75 mg/15 
cm²  single  patch  versus  4.5  mg/10  cm²  +  2.25  mg/5  cm²  patches)  were  performed  to  compare  the 
relative  bioavailability  of  one  patch  versus  two  patches  of  the  same  total  dose,  at  6  different 
application sites. 
Study SP871, SP651 
Study design 
These studies were 2-way crossover trials to investigate the relative bioavailability of administration 
of one rotigotine patch compared to combined administration of two patches of the same total dose. 
The secondary objective was to characterise the influence of application site on the bioavailability of 
rotigotine at steady state.  
Study SP651 (with the 18 mg dose) was performed in patients with advanced PD, and study SP871 in 
healthy subjects, using a 6.75 mg dose.

Subjects  were  brought  in  steady  state  with  single  patches  for  the  bioequivalence  part  of  the  study. 
Then, for 6 following days, patches were applied in a cross-over design (Days 21 and 22) in which 
subjects  received  one  and  two  patches  and  application  sites  were  varied  (shoulder,  upper  arm, 
abdomen, flank, hip, and thigh). Blood samples were drawn at baseline, and 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, and 20h 
after patch application. 
Results 
Plasma  exposure  after  either  two  patches  or  one  patch  of  the  same  total  dose  was  similar  in  both 
studies.  The  90%  CI  of  the  AUC0-24h,ss  ratio  was  90.5-100.5  (SP871),  and  93.7-105.7  (SP651), 
indicating bioequivalence.  
Plasma exposure is the lowest after application on thigh/abdomen, and the highest after application on 
the shoulders. 
• 
Interaction studies 
Study SP861 
Study design 
This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, multiple-dose trial, performed to 
investigate  the  interaction  with  a  fixed  combination  of  ethinylestradiol  and  levonorgestrel  (oral 
contraceptive) in 36 healthy young females.  
Following  a  2-month  Run-In  Period  on  oral  hormonal  contraception,  subjects  received  either 
rotigotine patch (Treatment A) or placebo patch (Treatment B) for 2 treatment periods. Each period 
lasted  28  days  during  which  patch  medication  was  administered  on  Days  1  to  13,  and  the  oral 
contraceptive on Day 1-21, followed by a pill-free week. Rotigotine patch dose was uptitrated from 
4.5 mg to 6.75 mg within 3 days.  
Plasma levels of rotigotine, ethinylestradiol + levonorgestrel were measured at Day 1 (pre-dose) and 
Day  13.  Serum  levels  of  intrinsic  hormones  [estradiol  (ES),  luteinizing  hormone  (LH),  and  follicle 
stimulating hormone (FSH)] were collected at Day 10, Day 13, and Day 14 before administration of 
trial medication, and intrinsic progesterone and estradiol were measured at Day 19, Day 20, and Day 
21 before administration of the oral hormonal contraceptive.  
Results 
All subjects completed the study.  
Rotigotine had no significant effect on plasma levels of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel.  
The  administration  of  rotigotine  patches  had  no  influence  on  contraceptive  activity  of  the  fixed 
combination of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel as the progesterone levels remained low after either 
placebo or rotigotine treatment (<1.3 ng/mL during Day 19 to Day 21). Moreover, ES, FSH and LH 
levels were low and similar for placebo and rotigotine treatment-arms, indicating that ovulation was 
unlikely to occur.

SP862 
Study design 
This  was  an  open-label  sequential  trial,  performed  to  investigate  the  interaction  with  omeprazole 
(CYP2C19 inhibitor). 
Rotigotine  patches  were  administered  for  14  days.  Subjects  were  up-titrated  to  9.0mg/day  (20cm2) 
within 3 days and remained on that dose until Day 12. Subjects received omeprazole capsules (40mg) 
once daily in the mornings of Days 7 - 12. At Day 13-14, rotigotine was down-titrated. Samples were 
drawn at Day 6 and 12, in a time frame of 24 hrs.  
Results 
Fifty-four  healthy  males  (all  extensive  metabolizers  for  CYP2C19)  enrolled  in  this  trial;  Fourteen 
subjects  were  withdrawn  because  of  manufacturing  defects  of  the  patches,  and  2  subjects  withdrew 
due to AEs [orthostatic hypotension (probably related) and hepatic enzyme increment (not related)]. 
PK data were available for 37 subjects.  
There were no relevant changes in plasma concentrations of rotigotine (neither conjugated nor free) or 
the N-desalkyl metabolites.  
•  Dose – response 
The dose-exposure relationship is linear for dose range between 1.125-9 mg (0.5-4 mg/24h, nominal 
dose).  
There was no clear dose-response relationship, as there is a considerable overlap of plasma 
concentrations achieved after the different dose levels.  
•  Discussion on pharmacokinetics 
From the pharmacokinetic (PK) data  obtained in several Phase II and Phase III studies performed in 
RLS patients, the plasma exposure in RLS was similar as reported before in PD patients (who are in 
general older) and young healthy volunteers, confirming that PK of rotigotine is not largely influenced 
by  differences  in  age,  gender  and  body  weight.  There  was  no  clear  dose-response  relationship  for 
efficacy in RLS treatment in the recommended dosing regimen. 
Though  CYP2C19  is  a  relevant  pathway  in-vitro,  inhibition  of  this  pathway  did  not  lead  to  clinical 
relevant changes in rotigotine exposure in-vivo when administered concomitantly with omeprazole.  
Rotigotine  had  no  significant  effect  on  PK  of  ingredients  of  the  contraceptive  pill  (in  this  case 
ethinylestradiol  0.03  mg  +  levonorgestrel  0.15  mg),  and  neither  on  the  contraceptive  activity  on  the 
intrinsic hormones, and this form of contraception can be safely used in combination with rotigotine.  
Results from a pooled analysis of three studies where the effect of application site on plasma exposure 
was studied, confirmed earlier conclusions that the exposure could vary significantly from day-to-day 
when changing application site, and that exposure is the lowest at abdomen and thighs.  
A  linear  plasma  exposure-dose  relationship  has  been  established  for  dose  range  0.5-4  mg/24h  thus 
including the proposed dosage of 1mg/24h and 3 mg/24h.

Pharmacodynamics 
•  Study SP864  
Study design 
SP864 was a double-blind, randomized, placebo- and positive-controlled, parallel-group trial to assess 
the potential electrocardiographic effects of rotigotine transdermal system up to 54.0 mg/day.  
The study was performed in 130 male and female patients with advanced-stage idiopathic Parkinson’s 
disease who were assigned to receive treatment with either rotigotine patch at doses from 9.0 mg/day 
to 54.0 mg/day or placebo patch.  
In  addition,  within the  placebo  group, subjects  were randomized  to the sequence  of receiving  either 
placebo saline intravenous (iv) solution or moxifloxacin iv solution (positive control) on Day 32 and 
39 in a crossover design (50% of subjects in the placebo group received positive control on Day 32 
[Sequence 1] the other 50% on Day 39 [Sequence 2]). This treatment was in addition to treatment with 
the placebo patch. All subjects in the rotigotine treatment group received placebo saline iv solution on 
both Day 32 and Day 39.  
Based  on  the  24-hour  continuous  drug  delivery  system,  ECGs  were  recorded  during  day  and  night 
time, starting on Days -3, -2, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42, and were followed by daytime serial 12-lead ECG 
recordings  on  Days  -2,  -1,  15,  22,  29,  36  and  43.  Daytime  serial  12-lead  ECG  recordings  without 
preceding overnight recordings were recorded on Days 32 and 39. Blood samples for determination of 
rotigotine concentrations in plasma were drawn on Days 14/15, 21/22, 28/29, 35/36 and 42/43. Safety 
and tolerability were assessed throughout the trial. 
Primary  endpoints 
The primary electrocardiographic endpoints were: 
- QTc comparison of rotigotine vs. placebo (parallel-group comparison).  
- QTc comparison of positive control vs. placebo (cross-over comparison). 
Results 
Moxifloxacin,  the  positive  control,  prolonged  QTc  as  expected.  There  was  no  evidence  of  an 
association  between  rotigotine  treatment  (up  to  54.0  mg/day)  and  QTc  prolongation.  Exposure  to 
rotigotine was proportional to the dose administered and in accordance with previous trials. There was 
no correlation between the plasma concentrations of unconjugated rotigotine and changes in QTc. Up 
to 54.0 mg/day of rotigotine was shown to be safe and well tolerated after administration over 52 days 
in male and female subjects with Parkinson’s disease. 
Overall,  this  study  was  well  designed  and  showed  no  prolongation  of  the  QTc  after  treatment  with 
rotigotine up to 54 mg/day.  
Clinical efficacy 
Eight clinical trials were performed to assess the safety and efficacy of rotigotine in patients with RLS. 
Idiopathic  RLS  was  diagnosed  using  the  International  Restless  Legs  Syndrome  Study  Group 
(IRLSSG) criteria.  
In total 1309 subjects with RLS were treated with rotigotine. In the clinical studies the IRLS and/or the 
CGI  Item  1  were  used  as  primary  efficacy  assessment  and  to  define  the  primary  endpoints.  These 
scales  are  internationally  recognized.  Studies  SP790  and  SP792  are  considered  the  main  efficacy 
studies. 
7
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  following  10  items  were  assessed  on  the  IRLS  (International  Restless  Leg  Syndrome)  scale:  1. 
Global  severity  rating  of  RLS  in  legs  and  arms;  2.  Urge  to  move;  3.  Relief  by  walking;  4.  Sleep 
disturbances  due to  RLS; 5.  Fatigue and somnolence  due  to  RLS  during  the  day;  6.  Global  severity 
rating of RLS; 7. Frequency of symptoms; 8. Severity of symptoms during an average day (24 hours), 
if present; 9. Impact of symptoms on daytime activities (family, home setting, contacts to friends, job); 
10. Impact of symptoms on mood (anger, dejection, sadness, anxiousness, irritation).  
In  all  items,  scores  ranged  from  0  (not  present)  to  4  (severe).  A  sum  score  across  all  10  items  was 
calculated for analysis which varied between 0 (no RLS symptoms present) to 40 (maximum severity 
in all symptoms). 
The  following  ranges  were  used  to  determine  severity  categories:  0=none,  1  to  10=mild,  11  to 
20=moderate, 21 to 30=severe, 31 to 40=very severe.  
Scores  for  CGI  (Clinical  Global  Impression)  Item  1  range  from  0  to  7  as  follows:  0=not  assessed, 
1=normal, not ill at all, 2=borderline ill, 3=mildly ill, 4=moderately ill, 5=markedly ill, 6=severely ill, 
7=among the most extremely ill.

METHODS 
Objectives 
The main objectives of the two phase II studies were to show proof-of-concept and analyze the dose-
response relationship of rotigotine in subjects with advanced stage of idiopathic RLS (study SP666) 
8
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and  to  investigate  the  efficacy  of  five  different  dosages  of  rotigotine  in  RLS  patients  (dose  finding 
study SP709). 
Study design 
Multicentre, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled, parallel design studies. 
Study Participants  
Study SP666  
Patients  had  to  have  an  initial  response  to  previous  dopaminergic  treatment  for  RLS  or  had  no 
previous dopaminergic treatment. Subject had to have a minimum score ≥ 5 in the sum score of the 
IRLSSG rating scale at the first visit under L-dopa treatment or a minimum score ≥ 10  in untreated 
subjects.  At  visit  2,  after  completion  of  a  wash  out  period  when  pre-treated  and  before  start  of 
treatment with trial medication, all subject scored ≥ 10 in the sum score of the IRLS scale (indicating 
moderate to severe RLS). In addition, all subject showed daytime symptoms of restless legs as defined 
by a score ≥ 3 in the scale ‘severity of RLS during the day’ at the first and at the second visit.  
Study SP709 
Subjects had to have a minimum score ≥ 15  (indicating moderate to severe RLS) in the sum score of 
the IRLSSG rating scale at baseline. Patients had no previous treatment for RLS or the subject was not 
well-controlled  with  current  or  previous  therapy.  However,  previous  treated  patients  had  responded 
previously,  according  to  medical  history  information,  to  L-dopa  therapy  and/or  treatment  with  a 
dopamine agonist (if pre-treated). Subjects were excluded from the trial if they had secondary RLS; a 
history of sleep disturbances; other central nervous diseases and any other psychotropic medications; 
previous treatment with dopamine agonists within a period of 4 weeks prior to enrolment 
Treatment study arms 
In study SP666 (four study arms), subjects were up titrated to a fixed dose of 1.125, 2.25, or 4.5 mg 
rotigotine or received placebo treatment. 
In study SP709 (six study arms), subjects were up titrated to a fixed dose of 1.125 mg, 2.25 mg, 4.5 
mg,  6.75  mg  or  9  mg  rotigotine  or to  placebo treatment.  Subjects  who  were treated for  RLS  had  to 
complete a wash out period of 7 days. 
Primary endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was absolute change in the IRLS sum score from baseline to the end of 
the maintenance period (difference). 
RESULTS 
In study SP666, 63 male and female patients (mean age 58.3±8.8, range 37-74) with idiopathic RLS 
participated in the study. 
In study SP709, 341 male and female patients (mean age 58.3±8.8, range 37-74) with idiopathic RLS 
participated in the study. 
Rotigotine has a linear relationship between dose and unconjugated rotigotine plasma concentrations 
in  patients  with  idiopathic  restless  legs  syndrome.  There  were  no  differences  between  different  age 
groups (≤65 years and ≥65 years). Results are presented in Tables 4, 5 and 6:

Results of study SP666 showed a dose-response relationship of rotigotine in comparison to placebo, i.e 
with increasing dose there was a greater decrease on the IRLSSG. The proposed doses (up to 6.75 mg) 
showed a statistically significant improvement. 
•  Main studies 
Studies SP790 and SP792 
METHODS 
Objectives 
The  main  objective  of  the  studies  SP790  and  SP792 was  to  assess the  efficacy  of  rotigotine  for  the 
treatment of RLS.  
Study design 
Both studies were multi-centre, randomized, placebo-controlled and double-blind with parallel groups.  
Study Participants  
Males and females were included in these trials. Idiopathic RLS was diagnosed using the International 
Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG).  
10
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients  had  to  have  an  initial  response  to  previous  dopaminergic  treatment  for  RLS  or  had  no 
previous  dopaminergic  treatment.  At  baseline,  that  is  after  the  run-in  period,  subject  had  to  have  a 
score of ≥15 on the IRLSSG (indicating moderate to severe RLS). In addition, at baseline patients had 
to  have  a  score  ≥4  points  on  the  Clinical  Global  Impressions  Item  1  assessment  (indicating  at  least 
moderately ill) at baseline. Subjects were excluded from the trial if they had secondary RLS, a history 
of sleep disturbances or other central nervous diseases. 
The  following  concomitant  medications/treatments  were  not  permitted  during  the  course  of  these 
trials:  neuroleptics,  hypnotics,  antidepressants,  anxiolytics,  benzodiazepines,  anticonvulsive  therapy, 
inhibitors,  sedative 
L-dopa,  budipine,  dopamine  agonists,  opioids,  MAO-inhibitors,  COMT 
antihistamines, dopamine antagonist antiemetics (except domperidone) and psycho stimulatory drugs.  
Treatment study arms 
Study SP790 was performed in Europe and consisted of four study arms: rotigotine 2.25 mg, rotigotine 
4.5 mg, rotigotine 6.75 mg and placebo.  
Study  SP792  had  almost  the  same  study  design  as  study  SP790;  with the inclusion  of  an  additional 
study arm of rotigotine 1.125 mg/day.   
A 7-day run-in period was followed by a 3 weeks titration period. Back titration was allowed once in 
the titration period in case of AEs suspected to be related to dopaminergic stimulation. Hereafter, a 6 
months maintenance period followed.  At the end of the trial a 7 days taper off period was scheduled. 
Subjects  were  randomized  centrally  by  an  interactive  response  system  (IVRS).  Subjects  were 
randomized  in  a  ratio  1:1:1:1  (active:placebo)  ratio  for  study  SP790  and  in  a  ratio  of  1:1:1:1:1 
(active:placebo) for study SP792. Subjects and investigators were blinded to trial medication and dose. 
Rotigotine  and  placebo-matched  patches  and  their  accompanying  packaging  were  identical  in 
appearance. 
Sample size 
For the IRLS sum score and the CGI, a 2-group t-test with a 0.025 1-sided significance level will have 
92%  power  to  detect  superiority  of  rotigotine  over  placebo,  assuming  a  difference  in  means  of  5.0 
points  towards  rotigotine  and  that  the  common  standard  deviation  is  10.0,  when  the  sample  size  in 
each group is 95 subjects.  
The  power  to  demonstrate  superiority  of  rotigotine  6.75mg  vs.  placebo  at  the  first  step  of  the 
hierarchical analyses then is at least 85%. The conditional power at each following step will also be 
85% if the step is reached. Consequently, the overall power of the trial to demonstrate superiority of 
all  3  rotigotine  doses  (6.75,  4.5,  and  2.25mg/day  rotigotine)  vs.  placebo  will  result  in  at  least  61%. 
Study  SP790  showed  that  approximately  3%  of  randomized  subjects  could  not  be  used  for  the 
analysis. Therefore, a sample size of 100 subjects in each group should be randomized, to ensure that 
95 subjects per treatment group are valid for the analyses.  
Statistical methods 
The  different  rotigotine  doses  were  compared  with  placebo  to  demonstrate  superior  efficacy  on  the 
IRLS and the GCI Item 1 score. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed for the changes 
from baseline to end of the maintenance period with dose level or placebo as the main factor, baseline 
as a covariate. The reports contain descriptive statistics, 95% confidence intervals, and p-values.  
Primary endpoints 
Primary clinical endpoints were the absolute change from baseline to end of the maintenance period in 
the IRLS sum score and the CGI Item 1 (severity of illness score). For the IRLS sum score, a decrease 
of  4  points  (indicating  improvement)  was  considered  clinically  relevant  after  a  6-months  treatment 
period.  
11
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Secondary endpoints 
Secondary endpoints were: IRLS responders (defined as a subject with a decrease of ≥50% in IRLS 
sum score from baseline at the end of the maintenance period), CGI Item 1 responders (defined as a 
subject with a decrease of ≥50% in CGI Item 1 at the end of the maintenance period), changes in CGI 
Items  2  and 3  (continuous)  during  the  maintenance  period,  change  from  baseline  in  RLS-6  Rating 
Scales at the end of the maintenance period, and the Global Subject Rating of Efficacy. 
RESULTS 
Recruitment/participant flow/number analysed 
The flow charts (Figures 1 and 2) give a summary of subject disposition of studies SP790 and SP792. 
The main reason for discontinuation was adverse events. 6 % of placebo-treated subjects and 18% of 
all  rotigotine-treated  subjects  with  RLS  had  an  adverse  event  that  led  to  discontinuation  of  trial 
medication.

Baseline data 
Study SP790 
The mean age of subjects in the safety set was 57.6 years; with the majority (66%) of subjects <65 
years  old.  The  majority  of  subjects  were  female  (placebo:  69%  subjects,  2.25mg  rotigotine:  73% 
subjects, 4.5mg rotigotine: 76% subjects, 6.75mg rotigotine: 73% subjects), and 99% of subjects were 
white. There were no notable differences in demographic characteristics between the safety set and the 
full analysis set and the per protocol set.  
In the safety set, the mean number of years since subjects were diagnosed with RLS was 3.1 years. 
Overall,  28%  of  subjects  were  considered  de  novo  (defined  as  not  having  received  any  RLS 
medication in the last 3 years). For subjects who were pre-treated, the mean number of years since the 
start  of  RLS  drug  therapy  was  3.7  years.  There  were  no  differences  across  treatment  groups  with 
respect to RLS diagnosis information in either the safety set and the full analysis set. At baseline, the 
mean IRLS sum score was 28.1 for subjects in the placebo group, and ranged from 28.0 to 28.2 across 
the rotigotine treatment groups. At baseline, the mean CGI Item 1 (severity of illness) score was 5.0 
for subjects in the placebo group, and ranged from 5.0 to 5.1 across the rotigotine treatment groups. 
Overall,  there  were  no  important  differences  between  treatment  groups  in  the  severity  of  disease  at 
baseline.  
Overall, 76% of subjects had concomitant disease present at screening. The most concomitant diseases 
were vascular disorders (32% overall), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (23% overall), 
and  metabolism  and  nutrition  disorders  (18%  overall).  A  similar  proportion  of  subjects  in  each 
treatment group had concomitant diseases in the musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders and 
the metabolism and nutrition disorders. A higher proportion of subjects in the placebo group compared 
to the rotigotine treatment groups reported a concomitant disease in the vascular disorders (placebo: 
42%  subjects,  2.25mg  rotigotine:  30%  subjects,  4.5mg  rotigotine:  32%  subjects,  6.75mg  rotigotine: 
21% subjects). Within the vascular disorders, the most commonly reported disease was hypertension.  
Study SP792 
The  mean  age  of  subjects  was  52.3  years;  with  the  majority  (84%)  of  subjects  <65  years  old.  
The majority of subjects were female (placebo: 57% subjects, 1.125mg/day rotigotine: 62% subjects, 
2.25mg/day rotigotine: 57% subjects, 4.5mg/day rotigotine: 65% subjects, 6.75mg/day rotigotine: 63% 
subjects), and 94% of subjects were white. 
The mean number of years since subjects were diagnosed with RLS was 2.1 years. Overall, 64% of 
subjects were considered de novo (defined as not having received any RLS medication in the previous 
3  years).  For  subjects  who  were  pre-treated,  the  mean  number  of  years  since  the  start  of  RLS  drug 
therapy  was  4.1  years.  There  were  no  clinically  relevant  differences  across  treatment  groups  with 
respect to RLS diagnosis information in either the safety set or the full analysis set. The baseline IRLS 
13
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
sum scores were similar across treatment groups, ranging from 23.1 to 23.6 (severe). The majority of 
subjects  were  considered  moderately  ill  and  markedly  ill  based  on  CGI  Item  1  (severity  of  illness) 
scores at baseline, with mean scores of 4.6 to 4.7 across all treatment groups.  Overall, there were no 
important differences between treatment groups in the severity of disease at Baseline.  
Overall, 87% of the  subjects in the safety set had concomitant disease present at screening. The most 
common  concomitant  diseases  were  musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders  (37%  overall), 
nervous system disorders (31% overall), gastrointestinal disorders (27% overall), and immune system 
disorders (26% overall). The distribution of concomitant diseases was similar across treatment groups. 
Hypertension was the concomitant disease most often reported (20%) at screening.

•  Supportive study – SP794 
The objective of study SP794 was to demonstrate that rotigotine is effective in subjects with idiopathic 
RLS  based  on  the  Periodic  Limb  Movement  Index  (PLMI  =  PLMs/total  time  in  bed  [TIB])  as 
measured  by  polysomnography  (PSG).  Subjects  had  to  have  at  baseline  an  IRLS  score  ≥15,  a  CGI 
Item 1 score ≥4 and have a PLMI if ≥15 based on PSG.  
Study design 
Phase  3,  multicenter,  double-blind,  randomized,  placebo  controlled,  2-arm  parallel-group  trial  in 
subjects with idiopathic RLS.  
Subjects  were  enrolled  and  randomized  to  receive  placebo  or  rotigotine  in  a  2:1  fashion.  A  run-in 
period was required for subjects who had previously received RLS therapy or prohibited concomitant 
medications. Subjects were up-titrated weekly in 2.25mg/day increments to their optimal dose, with a 
maximum  dose  of  rotigotine  6.75mg/placebo.  Dose  adjustments  were  not  allowed  during  the 
maintenance period.  
Sleep lab measurements were performed in the 2 consecutive nights prior to baseline and prior to the 
end of maintenance. Primary endpoint was the reduction of the PLMI at the end of the maintenance 
period compared to baseline. Secondary endpoints were: PLMSAI (Periodic Limb Movements during 
Sleep  Arousal  Index;  PLMs  during  sleep  with  arousals/total  sleep  time),  sleep  efficiency  [%;  sleep 
time/total time in bed (TIB)], IRLS sum score, CGI Item 1 (severity of illness), and Medical Outcome 
Study (MOS) Sleep Scale-Adequacy Subscale.

At  the  end  of  the  maintenance  period,  rotigotine-treated  subjects  had  16%  of  their  baseline  PLMI 
value present while placebo-treated subjects had 73% of their baseline PLMI values present. Results in 
the Per Protocol Set (PPS) were consistent with the results of the primary analysis.  
26%  of  the  rotigotine  treated  subjects  had  a  IRLS  score  of  0  at  the  end  of  the  maintenance  period, 
reflecting that they did not have symptoms of RLS. None of the patients in the placebo group had a 
score of 0 at the end of the maintenance period.

Clinical safety 
A total of 1432 subjects with RLS (1309 subjects treated with rotigotine) were included in the safety 
analysis.  All  subjects  receiving  at  least  one  dose  of  trial  medication  (rotigotine  or  placebo)  were 
included in the safety analyses.  
Patient exposure 
Rotigotine exposure exceeded 6 months for most subjects: 6 to 12 months (23%), 1 to 2 years (31%), 
and >2 years (15%). The maximum duration of exposure was 1327 days (~3.5 years). The maximum 
dose  of  longest  duration  was  4  mg/24h.  The  majority  of  subjects  were  exposed  to  mean  rotigotine 
doses ranging from 1 to <2 (41%) or 2 to <3 mg/24h (32%) followed by 0.5 to <1 (18%) and 3 to <4 
mg/24h (10%). For most subjects the dose of longest duration was either rotigotine 2 (29%), 1 (25%), 
or 3 mg/24h (23%). 
Adverse events 
In  a  pooled  analysis  of  studies  SP790  and  SP792,  68%  of  placebo-treated  subjects  and  83%  of  all 
rotigotine-treated subjects with RLS had at least one adverse event.  
The  adverse  events  with  the  highest  incidence  in  rotigotine-treated  subjects  was  application  and 
instillation  site  reactions  (34%),  nausea  (19%),  headache  (17%),  and  asthenic  conditions  (11%).  In 
rotigotine-treated  subjects,  all  occurrences  of  application  and  instillation  site  reactions  and  most 
occurrences of nausea, asthenic conditions, somnolence, and dizziness were regarded as related to trial 
medication  by  the  investigators.  Most  adverse  events  were  mild  or  moderate  in  intensity  and  dose 
related. 
Application  and instillation  site  reaction  occurred  in  34%  in  rotigotine  treated subjects  compared  to 
4%  in  placebo.  Among  all  rotigotine-treated  subjects,  the  incidence  of  nausea  was  notably  higher 
during the titration period compared with the maintenance period. This effect was observed across all 
doses of rotigotine.  
In  contrast,  the  incidence of  application  and  instillation  site  reactions  was lower  during  the  titration 
period compared with the maintenance period. In all rotigotine-treated subjects, median time to first 
onset of nausea was 8 days, and median time to first onset of application and instillation site reaction 
was 58 days. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
A total of 20/1309 (1.5%) rotigotine-treated subjects had at least one SAE assessed by the investigator 
as  drug  related.  The  most  frequent  drug-related  SAEs  were  application  and  instillation  site  reaction 
(n=6, <1%), nausea (n=2, <1%), syncope (n=2, <1%), and sleep attacks (n=2, <1%). No other specific 
drug-related SAE was observed in >1 subject.

Table 13: All drug-related serious adverse events occurring in rotigotine-treated subjects 
There  was  one  death  among  subjects  participating  in the  RLS  program.  The  patient  suffered from  a 
aortic  disorder  followed  by  ventricular  hypertrophy 
to  aortic  valve  replacement.  
The investigator assessed the aortic disorder as unlikely related and the remaining events as not related 
to the rotigotine medication.

Laboratory findings 
Small increases in liver function parameters and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were observed in subjects 
treated with rotigotine compared to subjects treated with placebo. 
The only chemistry-related adverse event reported by ≥1% of subjects in the total rotigotine group was 
hypercholesterolemia (1%).  
Discontinuation due to AES 
Six  percent  of  placebo-treated  subjects  and  18%  of  all  rotigotine-treated  subjects  with  RLS  had  a 
adverse  event  that  led  to  discontinuation  of  trial  medication.  Among  rotigotine-treated  subjects,  the 
overall incidence of discontinuation of trial medication due to a adverse event was 9%, 16%, 18%, and 
25% in the 0.5 mg/24h, 1 mg/24h, 2 mg/24h, and 3 mg/24h randomized dose groups, respectively.

The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application,  is  of  the  opinion  that  no 
additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information. 
5.   Overall conclusions and benefit-risk assessment 
The  clinical  efficacy  of  rotigotine  for the  treatment  of  moderate to severe  RLS was  assessed  in  two 
pivotal  studies  (SP790  and  SP792).  The  rotigotine  doses  used  in  these  studies  correspond  to  the 
proposed doses (from 1 to 3 mg/24h) in the SPC. The IRLS scale and the CGI type 1 score were used 
as clinical efficacy endpoints. Both scales are internationally recognised to study treatment effects in 
patients with RLS. Both studies demonstrated a comparable clinically significant improvement of RLS 
on the IRLS and the CGI Item 1 score. The responder analysis confirmed the clinical relevance of the 
effect. Moreover, the effect is maintained over a six months period (see figures 3 and 4 ). 
In terms of safety, no new concerns emerged in the RLS population in comparison to the safety profile 
of rotigotine in PD population. The maximum dose for the treatment of PD is much higher (16mg/24h) 
than for the treatment of RLS (3 mg/24h). 
Application  site  reactions,  nausea,  asthenia,  headache  and  somnolence  were  reported  in  higher 
frequencies with rotigotine than with placebo. Since RLS patients are possibly more active and surely 
less  bradykinetic  than  PD  patients,  somnolence  and  asthenia  can  be  of  concern  for  this  population. 
Satisfactory responses were provided by the MAH to these concerns and information in the SPC/PL 
has been reflected, as appropriate. 
Although  an  absence  of  augmentation  and  rebound  following  discontinuation  was  shown  with  the 
available  short  term  data,  these  effects  cannot  be  ruled  out  with  the  use  of  dopamine  agonists.  
The CHMP therefore requested a plan to study augmentation and rebound more extensively, to which 
the MAH committed to.  
In  conclusion,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  benefit  risk  assessment  of  Neupro  in  the  proposed 
indication ‘symptomatic treatment of moderate to severe idiopathic Restless Legs Syndrome in adults.’ 
is positive and recommended the variation to the Marketing Authorisation.

Conclusions 
On  24  April  2008,  the  CHMP  considered  this  Type  II  variation  to  be  acceptable  and  agreed  on  the 
amendments  to  be  introduced  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics,  Annex  II,  Labelling  and 
Package Leaflet.

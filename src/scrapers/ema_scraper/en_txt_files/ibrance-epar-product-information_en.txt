CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
IBRANCE is indicated for the treatment of hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth 
factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer: 
- 
- 
in combination with an aromatase inhibitor;  
in combination with fulvestrant in women who have received prior endocrine therapy (see 
section 5.1). 
In pre- or perimenopausal women, the endocrine therapy should be combined with a luteinizing 
hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with IBRANCE should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of 
anticancer medicinal products. 
Posology 
The recommended dose is 125 mg of palbociclib once daily for 21 consecutive days followed by 
7 days off treatment (Schedule 3/1) to comprise a complete cycle of 28 days. The treatment with 
IBRANCE should be continued as long as the patient is deriving clinical benefit from therapy or until 
unacceptable toxicity occurs. 
When coadministered with palbociclib, the aromatase inhibitor should be administered according to 
the dose schedule reported in the Summary of Product Characteristics. Treatment of 
pre/perimenopausal women with the combination of palbociclib plus an aromatase inhibitor should 
always be combined with an LHRH agonist (see section 4.4).  
When coadministered with palbociclib, the recommended dose of fulvestrant is 500 mg administered 
intramuscularly on Days 1, 15, 29, and once monthly thereafter. Please refer to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics of fulvestrant. Prior to the start of treatment with the combination of 
palbociclib plus fulvestrant, and throughout its duration, pre/perimenopausal women should be treated 
with LHRH agonists according to local clinical practice. 
Patients should be encouraged to take their dose at approximately the same time each day. If the 
patient vomits or misses a dose, an additional dose should not be taken that day. The next prescribed 
dose should be taken at the usual time. 
Dose adjustments 
Dose modification of IBRANCE is recommended based on individual safety and tolerability. 
Management of some adverse reactions may require temporary dose interruptions/delays, and/or dose 
reductions, or permanent discontinuation as per dose reduction schedules provided in Tables 1, 2, and 
3 (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).

Special populations 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment of IBRANCE is necessary in patients ≥ 65 years of age (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment of IBRANCE is required for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh classes A and B). For patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C), the 
recommended dose of IBRANCE is 75 mg once daily on Schedule 3/1 (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment of IBRANCE is required for patients with mild, moderate or severe renal 
impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCl] ≥ 15 mL/min). Insufficient data are available in patients 
requiring haemodialysis to provide any dose adjustment recommendation in this patient population 
(see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of IBRANCE in children and adolescents < 18 years of age have not been 
established. No data are available. 
Method of administration  
IBRANCE is for oral use. It should be taken with food, preferably a meal to ensure consistent 
palbociclib exposure (see section 5.2). Palbociclib should not be taken with grapefruit or grapefruit 
juice (see section 4.5). 
IBRANCE capsules should be swallowed whole (should not be chewed, crushed, or opened prior to 
swallowing). No capsule should be ingested if it is broken, cracked, or otherwise not intact. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  
Use of preparations containing St. John’s Wort (see section 4.5). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Pre/perimenopausal women 
Ovarian ablation or suppression with an LHRH agonist is mandatory when pre/perimenopausal 
women are administered IBRANCE in combination with an aromatase inhibitor, due to the mechanism 
of action of aromatase inhibitors. Palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant in pre/perimenopausal 
women has only been studied in combination with an LHRH agonist. 
Critical visceral disease 
The efficacy and safety of palbociclib have not been studied in patients with critical visceral disease 
(see section 5.1). 
Haematological disorders 
Dose interruption, dose reduction, or delay in starting treatment cycles is recommended for patients 
who develop Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. Appropriate monitoring should be performed (see sections 4.2 
and 4.8).

Interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis 
Severe, life-threatening, or fatal ILD and/or pneumonitis can occur in patients treated with IBRANCE 
when taken in combination with endocrine therapy. 
Across clinical studies (PALOMA-1, PALOMA-2, PALOMA-3), 1.4% of IBRANCE-treated patients 
had ILD/pneumonitis of any grade, 0.1% had Grade 3, and no Grade 4 or fatal cases were reported. 
Additional cases of ILD/pneumonitis have been observed in the post-marketing setting, with fatalities 
reported (see section 4.8). 
Patients should be monitored for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g. hypoxia, 
cough, dyspnoea). In patients who have new or worsening respiratory symptoms and are suspected to 
have developed ILD/pneumonitis, IBRANCE should be immediately interrupted and the patient 
should be evaluated. IBRANCE should be permanently discontinued in patients with severe ILD or 
pneumonitis (see section 4.2).  
Infections 
Since IBRANCE has myelosuppressive properties, it may predispose patients to infections. 
Infections have been reported at a higher rate in patients treated with IBRANCE in randomised 
clinical studies compared to patients treated in the respective comparator arm. Grade 3 and Grade 4 
infections occurred respectively in 5.6% and 0.9% of patients treated with IBRANCE in any 
combination (see section 4.8). 
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection and treated as medically appropriate 
(see section 4.2). 
Physicians should inform patients to promptly report any episodes of fever. 
Venous thromboembolism  
Venous thromboembolic events were reported in patients treated with IBRANCE (see section 4.8). 
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary 
embolism, and treated as medically appropriate.  
Hepatic impairment 
IBRANCE should be administered with caution to patients with moderate or severe hepatic 
impairment, with close monitoring of signs of toxicity (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
IBRANCE should be administered with caution to patients with moderate or severe renal impairment, 
with close monitoring of signs of toxicity (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Concomitant treatment with inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 
Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 may lead to increased toxicity (see section 4.5). Concomitant use of 
strong CYP3A inhibitors during treatment with palbociclib should be avoided. Coadministration 
should only be considered after careful evaluation of the potential benefits and risks. If 
coadministration with a strong CYP3A inhibitor is unavoidable, reduce the IBRANCE dose to 75 mg 
once daily. When the strong inhibitor is discontinued, the dose of IBRANCE should be increased 
(after 3-5 half-lives of the inhibitor) to the dose used prior to the initiation of the strong CYP3A 
inhibitor (see section 4.5). 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Coadministration of CYP3A inducers may lead to decreased palbociclib exposure and consequently a 
risk for lack of efficacy. Therefore, concomitant use of palbociclib with strong CYP3A4 inducers 
should be avoided. No dose adjustments are required for coadministration of palbociclib with 
moderate CYP3A inducers (see section 4.5). 
Women of childbearing potential or their partners  
Women of childbearing potential or their male partners must use a highly effective method of 
contraception while taking IBRANCE (see section 4.6). 
Lactose 
This medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose 
intolerance, total lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal 
product. 
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per capsule, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Palbociclib is primarily metabolised by CYP3A and sulphotransferase (SULT) enzyme SULT2A1. 
In vivo, palbociclib is a weak, time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A. 
Effects of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of palbociclib 
Effect of CYP3A inhibitors 
Coadministration of multiple 200 mg doses of itraconazole with a single 125 mg palbociclib dose 
increased palbociclib total exposure (AUCinf) and the peak concentration (Cmax) by approximately 87% 
and 34%, respectively, relative to a single 125 mg palbociclib dose given alone.  
The concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors including, but not limited to: clarithromycin, 
indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, 
saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, voriconazole, and grapefruit or grapefruit juice, should be 
avoided (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
No dose adjustments are needed for mild and moderate CYP3A inhibitors. 
Effect of CYP3A inducers 
Coadministration of multiple 600 mg doses of rifampin with a single 125 mg palbociclib dose 
decreased palbociclib AUCinf and Cmax by 85% and 70%, respectively, relative to a single 125 mg 
palbociclib dose given alone. 
The concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers including, but not limited to: carbamazepine, 
enzalutamide, phenytoin, rifampin, and St. John’s Wort should be avoided (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
Coadministration of multiple 400 mg daily doses of modafinil, a moderate CYP3A inducer, with a 
single 125 mg IBRANCE dose decreased palbociclib AUCinf and Cmax by 32% and 11%, respectively, 
relative to a single 125 mg IBRANCE dose given alone. No dose adjustments are required for 
moderate CYP3A inducers (see section 4.4). 
Effect of acid reducing agents  
Under fed conditions (intake of a moderate-fat meal), coadministration of multiple doses of the proton 
pump inhibitor (PPI) rabeprazole with a single dose of 125 mg IBRANCE decreased palbociclib Cmax 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
by 41%, but had limited impact on AUCinf (13% decrease) compared with a single dose of 125 mg 
IBRANCE administered alone. 
Under fasting conditions, the coadministration of multiple doses of the PPI rabeprazole with a single 
dose of 125 mg IBRANCE decreased palbociclib AUCinf and Cmax by 62% and 80%, respectively. 
Therefore, IBRANCE should be taken with food, preferably a meal (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).  
Given the reduced effect on gastric pH of H2-receptor antagonists and local antacids compared to 
PPIs, no clinically relevant effect of H2-receptor antagonists or local antacids on palbociclib exposure 
is expected when palbociclib is taken with food. 
Effects of palbociclib on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products 
Palbociclib is a weak, time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A following daily 125 mg dosing at steady 
state. Coadministration of multiple doses of palbociclib with midazolam increased the midazolam 
AUCinf and Cmax values by 61% and 37%, respectively, as compared with administration of midazolam 
alone.  
The dose of sensitive CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., alfentanil, cyclosporine, 
dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, everolimus, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, and tacrolimus) 
may need to be reduced when coadministered with IBRANCE as IBRANCE may increase their 
exposure.  
Drug-drug interaction between palbociclib and letrozole  
Data from the drug-drug interaction (DDI) evaluation portion of a clinical study in patients with breast 
cancer showed that there was no drug interaction between palbociclib and letrozole when the 
2 medicinal products were coadministered.  
Effect of tamoxifen on palbociclib exposure 
Data from a DDI study in healthy male subjects indicated that palbociclib exposures were comparable 
when a single dose of palbociclib was coadministered with multiple doses of tamoxifen and when 
palbociclib was given alone. 
Drug-drug interaction between palbociclib and fulvestrant  
Data from a clinical study in patients with breast cancer showed that there was no clinically relevant 
drug interaction between palbociclib and fulvestrant when the two medicinal products were 
coadministered. 
Drug-drug interaction between palbociclib and oral contraceptives 
DDI studies of palbociclib with oral contraceptives have not been conducted (see section 4.6). 
In vitro studies with transporters  
Based on in vitro data, palbociclib is predicted to inhibit intestinal P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast 
cancer resistance protein (BCRP) mediated transport. Therefore, administration of palbociclib with 
medicinal products that are substrates of P-gp (e.g., digoxin, dabigatran, colchicine) or BCRP (e.g., 
pravastatin, rosuvastatin, sulfasalazine) may increase their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions.  
Based on in vitro data, palbociclib may inhibit the uptake transporter organic cationic transporter 
OCT1 and then may increase the exposure of medical product substrates of this transporter 
(e.g., metformin).

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females 
Females of childbearing potential who are receiving this medicinal product, or their male partners 
should use adequate contraceptive methods (e.g., double-barrier contraception) during therapy and for 
at least 3 weeks or 14 weeks after completing therapy for females and males, respectively (see 
section 4.5). 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of palbociclib in pregnant women. Studies in 
animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). IBRANCE is not recommended during 
pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. 
Breast-feeding 
No studies have been conducted in humans or animals to assess the effect of palbociclib on milk 
production, its presence in breast milk, or its effects on the breast-fed child. It is unknown whether 
palbociclib is excreted in human milk. Patients receiving palbociclib should not breast-feed. 
Fertility 
There were no effects on oestrous cycle (female rats) or mating and fertility in rats (male or female) in 
non-clinical reproductive studies. However, no clinical data have been obtained on fertility in humans. 
Based on male reproductive organ findings (seminiferous tubule degeneration in testis, epididymal 
hypospermia, lower sperm motility and density, and decreased prostate secretion) in nonclinical safety 
studies, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with palbociclib (see section 5.3). Thus, men 
may consider sperm preservation prior to beginning therapy with IBRANCE. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
IBRANCE has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, IBRANCE may 
cause fatigue and patients should exercise caution when driving or using machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The overall safety profile of IBRANCE is based on pooled data from 872 patients who received 
palbociclib in combination with endocrine therapy (N=527 in combination with letrozole and N=345 
in combination with fulvestrant) in randomised clinical studies in HR-positive, HER2-negative 
advanced or metastatic breast cancer. 
The most common (≥ 20%) adverse reactions of any grade reported in patients receiving palbociclib in 
randomised clinical studies were neutropenia, infections, leukopenia, fatigue, nausea, stomatitis, 
anaemia, diarrhoea, alopecia and thrombocytopenia. The most common (≥ 2%) Grade ≥ 3 adverse 
reactions of palbociclib were neutropenia, leukopenia, infections, anaemia, aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST) increased, fatigue, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased. 
Dose reductions or dose modifications due to any adverse reaction occurred in 38.4% of patients 
receiving IBRANCE in randomised clinical studies regardless of the combination. 
Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 5.2% of patients receiving 
IBRANCE in randomised clinical studies regardless of the combination.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Overall, neutropenia of any grade was reported in 716 (82.1%) patients receiving IBRANCE 
regardless of the combination, with Grade 3 neutropenia being reported in 500 (57.3%) patients, and 
Grade 4 neutropenia being reported in 97 (11.1 %) patients (see Table 4). 
The median time to first episode of any grade neutropenia was 15 days (12-700 days) and the median 
duration of Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia was 7 days across 3 randomised clinical studies. 
Febrile neutropenia has been reported in 0.9% of patients receiving IBRANCE in combination with 
fulvestrant and in 1.7% of patients receiving palbociclib in combination with letrozole. 
Febrile neutropenia has been reported in about 2% of patients exposed to IBRANCE across the overall 
clinical programme.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In the event of a palbociclib overdose, both gastrointestinal (e.g., nausea, vomiting) and 
haematological (e.g., neutropenia) toxicity may occur and general supportive care should be provided.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01EF01. 
Mechanism of action 
Palbociclib is a highly selective, reversible inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 4 and 6. 
Cyclin D1 and CDK4/6 are downstream of multiple signalling pathways which lead to cellular 
proliferation. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Through inhibition of CDK4/6, palbociclib reduced cellular proliferation by blocking progression of 
the cell from G1 into S phase of the cell cycle. Testing of palbociclib in a panel of molecularly 
profiled breast cancer cell lines revealed high activity against luminal breast cancers, particularly 
ER-positive breast cancers. In the cell lines tested, the loss of retinoblastoma (Rb) was associated with 
loss of palbociclib activity. However, in a follow-up study with fresh tumour samples, no relation 
between RB1 expression and tumour response was observed. Similarly, no relation was observed 
when studying the response to palbociclib in in vivo models with patient-derived xenografts (PDX 
models). Available clinical data are reported in the clinical efficacy and safety section (see 
section 5.1).  
Cardiac electrophysiology 
The effect of palbociclib on the QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) interval was evaluated using 
time matched electrocardiogram (ECG) evaluating the change from baseline and corresponding 
pharmacokinetic data in 77 patients with advanced breast cancer. Palbociclib did not prolong the QTc 
to any clinically relevant extent at the recommended dose of 125 mg daily (Schedule 3/1). 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Randomised Phase 3 Study PALOMA-2: IBRANCE in combination with letrozole  
The efficacy of palbociclib in combination with letrozole versus letrozole plus placebo was evaluated 
in an international, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre study 
conducted in women with ER-positive, HER2-negative locally advanced breast cancer not amenable 
to resection or radiation therapy with curative intent or metastatic breast cancer who had not received 
prior systemic treatment for their advanced disease.

A total of 666 postmenopausal women were randomised 2:1 to the palbociclib plus letrozole arm or 
placebo plus letrozole arm and were stratified by site of disease (visceral versus nonvisceral), 
disease-free interval from the end of (neo)adjuvant treatment to disease recurrence (de novo metastatic 
versus ≤ 12 months versus > 12 months), and by the type of prior (neo)adjuvant anticancer therapies 
(prior hormonal therapy versus no prior hormonal therapy). Patients with advanced symptomatic, 
visceral spread, that were at risk of life-threatening complications in the short term (including patients 
with massive uncontrolled effusions [pleural, pericardial, peritoneal], pulmonary lymphangitis, and 
over 50% liver involvement), were not eligible for enrolment into the study.  
Patients continued to receive assigned treatment until objective disease progression, symptomatic 
deterioration, unacceptable toxicity, death, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurred first. 
Crossover between treatment arms was not allowed. 
Patients were well matched for baseline demographics and prognostic characteristics between the 
palbociclib plus letrozole arm and the placebo plus letrozole arm. The median age of patients enrolled 
in this study was 62 years (range 28-89), 48.3% of patients had received chemotherapy and 56.3% had 
received antihormonal therapy in the (neo)adjuvant setting prior to their diagnosis of advanced breast 
cancer while 37.2% of patients had received no prior systemic therapy in the (neo)adjuvant setting. 
The majority of patients (97.4%) had metastatic disease at baseline, 23.6% of patients had bone-only 
disease, and 49.2% of patients had visceral disease. 
The primary endpoint of the study was progression-free survival (PFS) evaluated according to 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) v1.1, as assessed by investigator. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included objective response (OR), clinical benefit response (CBR), 
safety, and change in quality of life (QoL).  
At the data cutoff date of 26-February-2016, the study met its primary objective of improving PFS. 
The observed hazard ratio (HR) was 0.576 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.46, 0.72) in favour of 
palbociclib plus letrozole, with a stratified log-rank test 1-sided p-value of < 0.000001. An updated 
analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints was performed after an additional 15 months of 
follow up (data cutoff date: 31-May-2017). A total of 405 PFS events were observed; 245 events 
(55.2%) in the palbociclib plus letrozole arm and 160 (72.1%) in the comparator arm respectively. 
Table 6 shows the efficacy results based on the primary and the updated analyses from the 
PALOMA-2 study, as assessed by the investigator and by the independent review.

A series of prespecified subgroup PFS analyses was performed based on prognostic factors and 
baseline characteristics to investigate the internal consistency of treatment effect. A reduction in the 
risk of disease progression or death in favour of the palbociclib plus letrozole arm was observed in all 
individual patient subgroups defined by stratification factors and baseline characteristics in the 
primary and in the updated analysis.  
Based on the 31-May-2017 data cutoff date, this reduction in risk continued to be observed in the 
following subgroups: (1) patients with either visceral metastases (HR of 0.62 [95% CI: 0.47, 0.81], 
median progression-free survival [mPFS] 19.3 months versus 12.3 months) or without visceral 
metastases (HR of 0.50 [95% CI: 0.37, 0.67], mPFS 35.9 months versus 17.0 months) and (2) patients 
with either bone only disease (HR of 0.41 [95% CI: 0.26, 0.63], mPFS 36.2 months versus 
11.2 months) or without bone-only disease (HR of 0.62 [95% CI: 0.50, 0.78], mPFS 24.2 months 
versus 14.5 months). Similarly, a reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in the 
palbociclib plus letrozole arm was observed in 512 patients whose tumour tested positive for Rb 
protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (HR of 0.543 [95% CI: 0.433, 0.681], mPFS 
27.4 months versus 13.7 months). For the 51 patients IHC negative for Rb expression, the difference 
between treatment arms was not statistically significant (HR of 0.868 [95% CI: 0.424, 1.777], mPFS 
23.2 versus 18.5 months) for the palbociclib plus letrozole arm versus the placebo plus letrozole arm, 
respectively. 
Additional efficacy measures (OR and time to response [TTR]) assessed in the sub-groups of patients 
with or without visceral disease based on the 31-May-2017 updated cutoff date are displayed in

Randomised Phase 3 Study PALOMA-3: IBRANCE in combination with fulvestrant  
The efficacy of palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant versus fulvestrant plus placebo was 
evaluated in an international, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, multicentre study conducted in 
women with HR-positive, HER2-negative locally advanced breast cancer not amenable to resection or 
radiation therapy with curative intent or metastatic breast cancer, regardless of their menopausal 
status, whose disease progressed after prior endocrine therapy in the (neo)adjuvant or metastatic 
setting. 
A total of 521 pre/peri- and postmenopausal women who had progressed on or within 12 months from 
completion of adjuvant endocrine therapy or on or within 1 month from prior endocrine therapy for 
advanced disease, were randomised 2:1 to palbociclib plus fulvestrant or placebo plus fulvestrant and 
stratified by documented sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy, menopausal status at study entry 
(pre/peri- versus postmenopausal), and presence of visceral metastases. Pre/perimenopausal women 
received the LHRH agonist goserelin. Patients with advanced/metastatic, symptomatic, visceral 
spread, that were at risk of life-threatening complications in the short term (including patients with 
massive uncontrolled effusions [pleural, pericardial, peritoneal], pulmonary lymphangitis, and over 
50% liver involvement), were not eligible for enrolment into the study. 
Patients continued to receive assigned treatment until objective disease progression, symptomatic 
deterioration, unacceptable toxicity, death, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurred first. 
Crossover between treatment arms was not allowed.  
Patients were well matched for baseline demographics and prognostic characteristics between the 
palbociclib plus fulvestrant arm and the placebo plus fulvestrant arm. The median age of patients 
enrolled in this study was 57 years (range 29, 88). In each treatment arm the majority of patients were 
White, had documented sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy, and were postmenopausal. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Approximately 20% of patients were pre/perimenopausal. All patients had received prior systemic 
therapy and most patients in each treatment arm had received a previous chemotherapy regimen for 
their primary diagnosis. More than half (62%) had an ECOG PS of 0, 60% had visceral metastases, 
and 60% had received more than 1 prior hormonal regimen for their primary diagnosis. 
The primary endpoint of the study was investigator-assessed PFS evaluated according to RECIST 1.1. 
Supportive PFS analyses were based on an Independent Central Radiology Review. Secondary 
endpoints included OR, CBR, OS, safety, and time-to-deterioration (TTD) in pain endpoint.  
The study met its primary endpoint of prolonging investigator-assessed PFS at the interim analysis 
conducted on 82% of the planned PFS events; the results crossed the prespecified Haybittle-Peto 
efficacy boundary (α=0.00135), demonstrating a statistically significant prolongation in PFS and a 
clinically meaningful treatment effect. A more mature update of efficacy data is reported in Table 9. 
After a median follow-up time of 45 months, the final OS analysis was performed based on 310 events 
(60% of randomised patients). A 6.9-month difference in median OS in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant 
arm compared with the placebo plus fulvestrant arm was observed; this result was not statistically 
significant at the prespecified significance level of 0.0235 (1-sided). In the placebo plus fulvestrant 
arm, 15.5% of randomised patients received palbociclib and other CDK inhibitors as post progression 
subsequent treatments. 
The results from the investigator-assessed PFS and final OS data from PALOMA-3 study are 
presented in Table 9. The relevant Kaplan-Meier plots are shown in Figures 3 and 4, respectively.

A reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant arm was 
observed in all individual patient subgroups defined by stratification factors and baseline 
characteristics. This was evident for pre/perimenopausal women (HR of 0.46 [95% CI: 0.28, 0.75]) 
and postmenopausal women (HR of 0.52 [95% CI: 0.40, 0.66]) and patients with visceral site of 
metastatic disease (HR of 0.50 [95% CI: 0.38, 0.65]) and non-visceral site of metastatic disease (HR of 
0.48 [95% CI: 0.33, 0.71]). Benefit was also observed regardless of lines of prior therapy in the 
metastatic setting, whether 0 (HR of 0.59 [95% CI: 0.37, 0.93]), 1 (HR of 0.46 [95% CI: 0.32,

Patient-reported symptoms were assessed using the European Organisation for Research and 
Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 and its Breast Cancer Module 
(EORTC QLQ-BR23). A total of 335 patients in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant arm and 166 patients 
in the fulvestrant only arm completed the questionnaire at baseline and at least 1 postbaseline visit. 
Time-to-Deterioration was prespecified as time between baseline and first occurrence of ≥ 10 points 
increase from baseline in pain symptom scores. Addition of palbociclib to fulvestrant resulted in a 
symptom benefit by significantly delaying time-to-deterioration in pain symptom compared with 
placebo plus fulvestrant (median 8.0 months versus 2.8 months; HR of 0.64 [95% CI: 0.49, 0.85]; 
p< 0.001).   
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
IBRANCE in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of breast carcinoma (see 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics of palbociclib were characterised in patients with solid tumours including 
advanced breast cancer and in healthy volunteers. 
Absorption 
The mean Cmax of palbociclib is generally observed between 6 to 12 hours following oral 
administration. The mean absolute bioavailability of palbociclib after an oral 125 mg dose is 46%. In 
the dosing range of 25 mg to 225 mg, the area under the curve (AUC) and Cmax increase proportionally 
with dose in general. Steady state was achieved within 8 days following repeated once daily dosing. 
With repeated once daily administration, palbociclib accumulates with a median accumulation ratio of 
2.4 (range 1.5-4.2). 
Food effect 
Palbociclib absorption and exposure were very low in approximately 13% of the population under the 
fasted condition. Food intake increased the palbociclib exposure in this small subset of the population, 
but did not alter palbociclib exposure in the rest of the population to a clinically relevant extent. 
Compared to palbociclib given under overnight fasted conditions, the AUCinf and Cmax of palbociclib 
increased by 21% and 38% when given with high-fat food, by 12% and 27% when given with low-fat 
food, and by 13% and 24% when moderate-fat food was given 1 hour before and 2 hours after 
palbociclib dosing. In addition, food intake significantly reduced the intersubject and intrasubject 
variability of palbociclib exposure. Based on these results, palbociclib should be taken with food (see 
section 4.2). 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
Binding of palbociclib to human plasma proteins in vitro was ~85%, with no concentration 
dependence. The mean fraction unbound (fu) of palbociclib in human plasma in vivo increased 
incrementally with worsening hepatic function. There was no obvious trend in the mean palbociclib fu 
in human plasma in vivo with worsening renal function. In vitro, the uptake of palbociclib into human 
hepatocytes occurred mainly via passive diffusion. Palbociclib is not a substrate of OATP1B1 or 
OATP1B3. 
Biotransformation 
In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that palbociclib undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism in 
humans. Following oral administration of a single 125 mg dose of [14C]palbociclib to humans, the 
major primary metabolic pathways for palbociclib involved oxidation and sulphonation, with acylation 
and glucuronidation contributing as minor pathways. Palbociclib was the major circulating 
drug-derived entity in plasma.  
The majority of the material was excreted as metabolites. In faeces, the sulfamic acid conjugate of 
palbociclib was the major drug-related component, accounting for 25.8% of the administered dose. 
In vitro studies with human hepatocytes, liver cytosolic and S9 fractions, and recombinant 
sulphotransferase (SULT) enzymes indicated that CYP3A and SULT2A1 are mainly involved in the 
metabolism of palbociclib. 
Elimination 
The geometric mean apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of palbociclib was 63 L/h, and the mean plasma 
elimination half-life was 28.8 hours in patients with advanced breast cancer. In 6 healthy male subjects 
given a single oral dose of [14C]palbociclib, a median of 92% of the total administered radioactive 
dose was recovered in 15 days; faeces (74% of dose) was the major route of excretion, with 17% of 
the dose recovered in urine. Excretion of unchanged palbociclib in faeces and urine was 2% and 7% of 
the administered dose, respectively. 
In vitro, palbociclib is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6, and is not an 
inducer of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, and 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. 
In vitro evaluations indicate that palbociclib has low potential to inhibit the activities of organic anion 
transporter (OAT)1, OAT3, organic cation transporter (OCT)2, organic anion transporting polypeptide 
(OATP)1B1, OATP1B3, and bile salt export pump (BSEP) at clinically relevant concentrations.  
Special populations 
Age, gender, and body weight 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 183 patients with cancer (50 male and 133 female 
patients, age ranging from 22 to 89 years, and body weight ranging from 38 to 123 kg), gender had no 
effect on the exposure of palbociclib, and age and body weight had no clinically important effect on 
the exposure of palbociclib. 
Paediatric population 
Pharmacokinetics of palbociclib has not been evaluated in patients < 18 years of age. 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic impairment 
Data from a pharmacokinetic study in subjects with varying degrees of hepatic function indicate that 
palbociclib unbound exposure (unbound AUCinf) decreased by 17% in subjects with mild hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh class A), and increased by 34% and 77% in subjects with moderate 
(Child-Pugh class B) and severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment, respectively, relative to 
subjects with normal hepatic function. Peak palbociclib unbound exposure (unbound Cmax) was 
increased by 7%, 38% and 72% for mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment, respectively, 
relative to subjects with normal hepatic function. In addition, based on a population pharmacokinetic 
analysis that included 183 patients with advanced cancer, where 40 patients had mild hepatic 
impairment based on National Cancer Institute (NCI) classification (total bilirubin ≤ Upper Limit of 
Normal (ULN) and Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) > ULN, or total bilirubin > 1.0 to 1.5 × ULN 
and any AST), mild hepatic impairment had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of palbociclib. 
Renal impairment 
Data from a pharmacokinetic study in subjects with varying degrees of renal function indicate that 
total palbociclib exposure (AUCinf) increased by 39%, 42%, and 31% with mild 
(60 mL/min ≤ CrCl < 90 mL/min), moderate (30 mL/min ≤ CrCl < 60 mL/min), and severe 
(CrCl < 30 mL/min) renal impairment, respectively, relative to subjects with normal 
(CrCl ≥ 90 mL/min) renal function. Peak palbociclib exposure (Cmax) was increased by 17%, 12%, and 
15% for mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively, relative to subjects with normal 
renal function. In addition, based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis that included 183 patients 
with advanced cancer, where 73 patients had mild renal impairment and 29 patients had moderate 
renal impairment, mild and moderate renal impairment had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of 
palbociclib. The pharmacokinetics of palbociclib have not been studied in patients requiring 
haemodialysis. 
Ethnicity 
In a pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers, palbociclib AUCinf and Cmax values were 30% and 
35% higher, respectively, in Japanese subjects compared with non-Asian subjects after a single oral 
dose. However, this finding was not reproduced consistently in subsequent studies in Japanese or 
Asian breast cancer patients after multiple dosing. Based on an analysis of the cumulative 
pharmacokinetic, safety, and efficacy data across Asian and non-Asian populations, no dose 
adjustment based on Asian race is considered necessary. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
The primary target organ findings following single and/or repeat dosing included 
haematolymphopoietic and male reproductive organ effects in rats and dogs, and effects on bone and 
actively growing incisors in rats only. These systemic toxicities were generally observed at clinically 
relevant exposures based on AUC. Partial to full reversal of effects on the hematolymphopoietic, male 
reproductive systems, and incisor teeth were established, whereas the bone effect was not reversed 
following a 12-week nondosing period. In addition, cardiovascular effects (QTc prolongation, 
decreased heart rate, and increased RR interval and systolic blood pressure) were identified in 
telemetered dogs at ≥ 4 times human clinical exposure based on Cmax.  
Carcinogenicity 
Palbociclib was assessed for carcinogenicity in a 6-month transgenic mouse study and in a 2-year rat 
study. Palbociclib was negative for carcinogenicity in transgenic mice at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day 
(No Observed Effect Level [NOEL] approximately 11 times human clinical exposure based on AUC). 
Palbociclib-related neoplastic finding in rats included an increased incidence of microglial cell 
tumours in the central nervous system of males at 30 mg/kg/day; there were no neoplastic findings in 
female rats at any dose up to 200 mg/kg/day. The NOEL for palbociclib-related carcinogenicity effects 
was 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 2 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC) and 
200 mg/kg/day (approximately 4 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC) in males and 
females, respectively. The relevance of the male rat neoplastic finding to humans is unknown. 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Genotoxicity 
Palbociclib was not mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay and did not induce 
structural chromosomal aberrations in the in vitro human lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay. 
Palbociclib induced micronuclei via an aneugenic mechanism in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells in vitro 
and in the bone marrow of male rats at doses ≥ 100 mg/kg/day. The exposure of animals at the no 
observed effect level for aneugenicity was approximately 7 times human clinical exposure based on 
AUC. 
Impairment of fertility 
Palbociclib did not affect mating or fertility in female rats at any dose tested up to 300 mg/kg/day 
(approximately 3 times human clinical exposure based on AUC), and no adverse effects were 
observed in female reproductive tissues in repeat-dose toxicity studies up to 300 mg/kg/day in the rat 
and 3 mg/kg/day in the dog (approximately 5 and 3 times human clinical exposure based on AUC, 
respectively).  
Palbociclib is considered to have the potential to impair reproductive function and fertility in male 
humans based on non-clinical findings in rats and dogs. Palbociclib-related findings in the testis, 
epididymis, prostate, and seminal vesicle included decreased organ weight, atrophy or degeneration, 
hypospermia, intratubular cellular debris, lower sperm motility and density, and decreased secretion. 
These findings were observed in rats and/or dogs at exposures ≥ 9 times or subtherapeutic compared to 
human clinical exposure based on AUC, respectively. Partial reversibility of male reproductive organ 
effects was observed in the rat and dog following a 4- and 12-week nondosing period, respectively. 
Despite these male reproductive organ findings, there were no effects on mating or fertility in male 
rats at projected exposure levels 13 times human clinical exposure based on AUC. 
Developmental toxicity 
Palbociclib is a reversible inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6, which are both involved in 
regulating the cell cycle. It may therefore have risk of foetal harm if used during pregnancy. 
Palbociclib was foetotoxic in pregnant animals. An increased incidence of a skeletal variation 
(increased incidence of a rib present at the seventh cervical vertebra) at ≥ 100 mg/kg/day was observed 
in rats. Reduced foetal body weights were observed at a maternally toxic dose of 300 mg/kg/day in 
rats (3 times human clinical exposure based on AUC), and an increased incidence of skeletal 
variations, including small phalanges in the forelimb was observed at a maternally toxic dose of 
20 mg/kg/day in rabbits (4 times human clinical exposure based on AUC). Actual foetal exposure and 
cross-placenta transfer have not been examined.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
IBRANCE is indicated for the treatment of hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth 
factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer: 
- 
- 
in combination with an aromatase inhibitor;  
in combination with fulvestrant in women who have received prior endocrine therapy (see 
section 5.1). 
In pre- or perimenopausal women, the endocrine therapy should be combined with a luteinizing 
hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with IBRANCE should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of 
anticancer medicinal products. 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Posology 
The recommended dose is 125 mg of palbociclib once daily for 21 consecutive days followed by 
7 days off treatment (Schedule 3/1) to comprise a complete cycle of 28 days. The treatment with 
IBRANCE should be continued as long as the patient is deriving clinical benefit from therapy or until 
unacceptable toxicity occurs. 
When coadministered with palbociclib, the aromatase inhibitor should be administered according to 
the dose schedule reported in the Summary of Product Characteristics. Treatment of 
pre/perimenopausal women with the combination of palbociclib plus an aromatase inhibitor should 
always be combined with an LHRH agonist (see section 4.4).  
When coadministered with palbociclib, the recommended dose of fulvestrant is 500 mg administered 
intramuscularly on Days 1, 15, 29, and once monthly thereafter. Please refer to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics of fulvestrant. Prior to the start of treatment with the combination of 
palbociclib plus fulvestrant, and throughout its duration, pre/perimenopausal women should be treated 
with LHRH agonists according to local clinical practice. 
Patients should be encouraged to take their dose at approximately the same time each day. If the 
patient vomits or misses a dose, an additional dose should not be taken that day. The next prescribed 
dose should be taken at the usual time. 
Dose adjustments 
Dose modification of IBRANCE is recommended based on individual safety and tolerability. 
Management of some adverse reactions may require temporary dose interruptions/delays, and/or dose 
reductions, or permanent discontinuation as per dose reduction schedules provided in Tables 1, 2, and 
3 (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).

Complete blood count should be monitored prior to the start of IBRANCE therapy and at the 
beginning of each cycle, as well as on Day 15 of the first 2 cycles, and as clinically indicated. 
For patients who experience a maximum of Grade 1 or 2 neutropenia in the first 6 cycles, complete 
blood counts for subsequent cycles should be monitored every 3 months, prior to the beginning of a 
cycle and as clinically indicated. 
Absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) of ≥ 1,000/mm3 and platelet counts of ≥ 50,000/mm3 are 
recommended to receive IBRANCE.

IBRANCE should be permanently discontinued in patients with severe interstitial lung disease 
(ILD)/pneumonitis (see section 4.4).  
Special populations 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment of IBRANCE is necessary in patients ≥ 65 years of age (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment of IBRANCE is required for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh classes A and B). For patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C), the 
recommended dose of IBRANCE is 75 mg once daily on Schedule 3/1 (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment of IBRANCE is required for patients with mild, moderate or severe renal 
impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCl] ≥ 15 mL/min). Insufficient data are available in patients 
requiring haemodialysis to provide any dose adjustment recommendation in this patient population 
(see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of IBRANCE in children and adolescents < 18 years of age have not been 
established. No data are available. 
Method of administration  
IBRANCE is for oral use. The tablets may be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). Palbociclib 
should not be taken with grapefruit or grapefruit juice (see section 4.5). 
IBRANCE tablets should be swallowed whole (should not be chewed, crushed, or split prior to 
swallowing). No tablet should be ingested if it is broken, cracked, or otherwise not intact. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  
Use of preparations containing St. John’s Wort (see section 4.5). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Pre/perimenopausal women 
Ovarian ablation or suppression with an LHRH agonist is mandatory when pre/perimenopausal 
women are administered IBRANCE in combination with an aromatase inhibitor, due to the mechanism 
of action of aromatase inhibitors. Palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant in pre/perimenopausal 
women has only been studied in combination with an LHRH agonist. 
Critical visceral disease 
The efficacy and safety of palbociclib have not been studied in patients with critical visceral disease 
(see section 5.1). 
Haematological disorders 
Dose interruption, dose reduction, or delay in starting treatment cycles is recommended for patients 
who develop Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. Appropriate monitoring should be performed (see sections 4.2 
and 4.8). 
Interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis 
Severe, life-threatening, or fatal ILD and/or pneumonitis can occur in patients treated with IBRANCE 
when taken in combination with endocrine therapy. 
Across clinical studies (PALOMA-1, PALOMA-2, PALOMA-3), 1.4% of IBRANCE-treated patients 
had ILD/pneumonitis of any grade, 0.1% had Grade 3, and no Grade 4 or fatal cases were reported. 
Additional cases of ILD/pneumonitis have been observed in the post-marketing setting, with fatalities 
reported (see section 4.8). 
Patients should be monitored for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g. hypoxia, 
cough, dyspnoea). In patients who have new or worsening respiratory symptoms and are suspected to 
have developed ILD/pneumonitis, IBRANCE should be immediately interrupted and the patient 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
should be evaluated. IBRANCE should be permanently discontinued in patients with severe ILD or 
pneumonitis (see section 4.2).  
Infections 
Since IBRANCE has myelosuppressive properties, it may predispose patients to infections. 
Infections have been reported at a higher rate in patients treated with IBRANCE in randomised 
clinical studies compared to patients treated in the respective comparator arm. Grade 3 and Grade 4 
infections occurred respectively in 5.6% and 0.9% of patients treated with IBRANCE in any 
combination (see section 4.8). 
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection and treated as medically appropriate 
(see section 4.2). 
Physicians should inform patients to promptly report any episodes of fever. 
Venous thromboembolism  
Venous thromboembolic events were reported in patients treated with IBRANCE (see section 4.8). 
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary 
embolism, and treated as medically appropriate.  
Hepatic impairment 
IBRANCE should be administered with caution to patients with moderate or severe hepatic 
impairment, with close monitoring of signs of toxicity (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
IBRANCE should be administered with caution to patients with moderate or severe renal impairment, 
with close monitoring of signs of toxicity (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Concomitant treatment with inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 
Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 may lead to increased toxicity (see section 4.5). Concomitant use of 
strong CYP3A inhibitors during treatment with palbociclib should be avoided. Coadministration 
should only be considered after careful evaluation of the potential benefits and risks. If 
coadministration with a strong CYP3A inhibitor is unavoidable, reduce the IBRANCE dose to 75 mg 
once daily. When the strong inhibitor is discontinued, the dose of IBRANCE should be increased 
(after 3-5 half-lives of the inhibitor) to the dose used prior to the initiation of the strong CYP3A 
inhibitor (see section 4.5). 
Coadministration of CYP3A inducers may lead to decreased palbociclib exposure and consequently a 
risk for lack of efficacy. Therefore, concomitant use of palbociclib with strong CYP3A4 inducers 
should be avoided. No dose adjustments are required for coadministration of palbociclib with 
moderate CYP3A inducers (see section 4.5). 
Women of childbearing potential or their partners  
Women of childbearing potential or their male partners must use a highly effective method of 
contraception while taking IBRANCE (see section 4.6). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Palbociclib is primarily metabolised by CYP3A and sulphotransferase (SULT) enzyme SULT2A1. 
In vivo, palbociclib is a weak, time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A.

Effects of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of palbociclib 
Effect of CYP3A inhibitors 
Coadministration of multiple 200 mg doses of itraconazole with a single 125 mg palbociclib dose 
increased palbociclib total exposure (AUCinf) and the peak concentration (Cmax) by approximately 87% 
and 34%, respectively, relative to a single 125 mg palbociclib dose given alone.  
The concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors including, but not limited to: clarithromycin, 
indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, 
saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, voriconazole, and grapefruit or grapefruit juice, should be 
avoided (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
No dose adjustments are needed for mild and moderate CYP3A inhibitors. 
Effect of CYP3A inducers 
Coadministration of multiple 600 mg doses of rifampin with a single 125 mg palbociclib dose 
decreased palbociclib AUCinf and Cmax by 85% and 70%, respectively, relative to a single 125 mg 
palbociclib dose given alone. 
The concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers including, but not limited to: carbamazepine, 
enzalutamide, phenytoin, rifampin, and St. John’s Wort should be avoided (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
Coadministration of multiple 400 mg daily doses of modafinil, a moderate CYP3A inducer, with a 
single 125 mg IBRANCE dose decreased palbociclib AUCinf and Cmax by 32% and 11%, respectively, 
relative to a single 125 mg IBRANCE dose given alone. No dose adjustments are required for 
moderate CYP3A inducers (see section 4.4). 
Effect of acid reducing agents  
Coadministration of multiple doses of the PPI rabeprazole with a single 125 mg IBRANCE tablet 
under fasted conditions had no effect on the rate and extent of absorption of palbociclib when 
compared to a single 125 mg IBRANCE tablet administered alone.   
Given the reduced effect on gastric pH of H2-receptor antagonists and local antacids compared to 
PPIs, no clinically relevant effect of H2-receptor antagonists or local antacids on palbociclib exposure 
is expected. 
Effects of palbociclib on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products 
Palbociclib is a weak, time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A following daily 125 mg dosing at steady 
state. Coadministration of multiple doses of palbociclib with midazolam increased the midazolam 
AUCinf and Cmax values by 61% and 37%, respectively, as compared with administration of midazolam 
alone.  
The dose of sensitive CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., alfentanil, cyclosporine, 
dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, everolimus, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, and tacrolimus) 
may need to be reduced when coadministered with IBRANCE as IBRANCE may increase their 
exposure.  
Drug-drug interaction between palbociclib and letrozole  
Data from the drug-drug interaction (DDI) evaluation portion of a clinical study in patients with breast 
cancer showed that there was no drug interaction between palbociclib and letrozole when the 
2 medicinal products were coadministered.  
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Effect of tamoxifen on palbociclib exposure 
Data from a DDI study in healthy male subjects indicated that palbociclib exposures were comparable 
when a single dose of palbociclib was coadministered with multiple doses of tamoxifen and when 
palbociclib was given alone. 
Drug-drug interaction between palbociclib and fulvestrant  
Data from a clinical study in patients with breast cancer showed that there was no clinically relevant 
drug interaction between palbociclib and fulvestrant when the two medicinal products were 
coadministered. 
Drug-drug interaction between palbociclib and oral contraceptives 
DDI studies of palbociclib with oral contraceptives have not been conducted (see section 4.6). 
In vitro studies with transporters  
Based on in vitro data, palbociclib is predicted to inhibit intestinal P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast 
cancer resistance protein (BCRP) mediated transport. Therefore, administration of palbociclib with 
medicinal products that are substrates of P-gp (e.g., digoxin, dabigatran, colchicine) or BCRP (e.g., 
pravastatin, rosuvastatin, sulfasalazine) may increase their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions.  
Based on in vitro data, palbociclib may inhibit the uptake transporter organic cationic transporter 
OCT1 and then may increase the exposure of medical product substrates of this transporter 
(e.g., metformin). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females 
Females of childbearing potential who are receiving this medicinal product, or their male partners 
should use adequate contraceptive methods (e.g., double-barrier contraception) during therapy and for 
at least 3 weeks or 14 weeks after completing therapy for females and males, respectively (see 
section 4.5). 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of palbociclib in pregnant women. Studies in 
animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). IBRANCE is not recommended during 
pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. 
Breast-feeding 
No studies have been conducted in humans or animals to assess the effect of palbociclib on milk 
production, its presence in breast milk, or its effects on the breast-fed child. It is unknown whether 
palbociclib is excreted in human milk. Patients receiving palbociclib should not breast-feed. 
Fertility 
There were no effects on oestrous cycle (female rats) or mating and fertility in rats (male or female) in 
non-clinical reproductive studies. However, no clinical data have been obtained on fertility in humans. 
Based on male reproductive organ findings (seminiferous tubule degeneration in testis, epididymal 
hypospermia, lower sperm motility and density, and decreased prostate secretion) in non-clinical 
safety studies, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with palbociclib (see section 5.3). 
Thus, men may consider sperm preservation prior to beginning therapy with IBRANCE.

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
IBRANCE has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, IBRANCE may 
cause fatigue and patients should exercise caution when driving or using machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The overall safety profile of IBRANCE is based on pooled data from 872 patients who received 
palbociclib in combination with endocrine therapy (N=527 in combination with letrozole and N=345 
in combination with fulvestrant) in randomised clinical studies in HR-positive, HER2-negative 
advanced or metastatic breast cancer. 
The most common (≥ 20%) adverse reactions of any grade reported in patients receiving palbociclib in 
randomised clinical studies were neutropenia, infections, leukopenia, fatigue, nausea, stomatitis, 
anaemia, diarrhoea, alopecia and thrombocytopenia. The most common (≥ 2%) Grade ≥ 3 adverse 
reactions of palbociclib were neutropenia, leukopenia, infections, anaemia, aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST) increased, fatigue, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased. 
Dose reductions or dose modifications due to any adverse reaction occurred in 38.4% of patients 
receiving IBRANCE in randomised clinical studies regardless of the combination. 
Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 5.2% of patients receiving 
IBRANCE in randomised clinical studies regardless of the combination. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Table 4 reports the adverse reactions from the pooled dataset of 3 randomised studies. The median 
duration of palbociclib treatment across the pooled dataset at the time of the final OS analysis was 
14.8 months. 
Table 5 reports the laboratory abnormalities observed in pooled datasets from 3 randomised studies. 
The adverse reactions are listed by system organ class and frequency category. Frequency categories 
are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), and uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to 
< 1/100). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing 
seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Overall, neutropenia of any grade was reported in 716 (82.1%) patients receiving IBRANCE 
regardless of the combination, with Grade 3 neutropenia being reported in 500 (57.3%) patients, and 
Grade 4 neutropenia being reported in 97 (11.1 %) patients (see Table 4). 
The median time to first episode of any grade neutropenia was 15 days (12-700 days) and the median 
duration of Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia was 7 days across 3 randomised clinical studies. 
Febrile neutropenia has been reported in 0.9% of patients receiving IBRANCE in combination with 
fulvestrant and in 1.7% of patients receiving palbociclib in combination with letrozole. 
Febrile neutropenia has been reported in about 2% of patients exposed to IBRANCE across the overall 
clinical programme.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In the event of a palbociclib overdose, both gastrointestinal (e.g., nausea, vomiting) and 
haematological (e.g., neutropenia) toxicity may occur and general supportive care should be provided. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01EF01. 
Mechanism of action 
Palbociclib is a highly selective, reversible inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 4 and 6. 
Cyclin D1 and CDK4/6 are downstream of multiple signalling pathways which lead to cellular 
proliferation. 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Through inhibition of CDK4/6, palbociclib reduced cellular proliferation by blocking progression of 
the cell from G1 into S phase of the cell cycle. Testing of palbociclib in a panel of molecularly 
profiled breast cancer cell lines revealed high activity against luminal breast cancers, particularly 
ER-positive breast cancers. In the cell lines tested, the loss of retinoblastoma (Rb) was associated with 
loss of palbociclib activity. However, in a follow-up study with fresh tumour samples, no relation 
between RB1 expression and tumour response was observed. Similarly, no relation was observed 
when studying the response to palbociclib in in vivo models with patient-derived xenografts (PDX 
models). Available clinical data are reported in the clinical efficacy and safety section (see 
section 5.1).  
Cardiac electrophysiology 
The effect of palbociclib on the QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) interval was evaluated using 
time matched electrocardiogram (ECG) evaluating the change from baseline and corresponding 
pharmacokinetic data in 77 patients with advanced breast cancer. Palbociclib did not prolong the QTc 
to any clinically relevant extent at the recommended dose of 125 mg daily (Schedule 3/1). 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Randomised Phase 3 Study PALOMA-2: IBRANCE in combination with letrozole  
The efficacy of palbociclib in combination with letrozole versus letrozole plus placebo was evaluated 
in an international, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre study 
conducted in women with ER-positive, HER2-negative locally advanced breast cancer not amenable 
to resection or radiation therapy with curative intent or metastatic breast cancer who had not received 
prior systemic treatment for their advanced disease. 
A total of 666 postmenopausal women were randomised 2:1 to the palbociclib plus letrozole arm or 
placebo plus letrozole arm and were stratified by site of disease (visceral versus nonvisceral), 
disease-free interval from the end of (neo)adjuvant treatment to disease recurrence (de novo metastatic 
versus ≤ 12 months versus > 12 months), and by the type of prior (neo)adjuvant anticancer therapies 
(prior hormonal therapy versus no prior hormonal therapy). Patients with advanced symptomatic, 
visceral spread, that were at risk of life-threatening complications in the short term (including patients 
with massive uncontrolled effusions [pleural, pericardial, peritoneal], pulmonary lymphangitis, and 
over 50% liver involvement), were not eligible for enrolment into the study.  
Patients continued to receive assigned treatment until objective disease progression, symptomatic 
deterioration, unacceptable toxicity, death, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurred first. 
Crossover between treatment arms was not allowed. 
Patients were well matched for baseline demographics and prognostic characteristics between the 
palbociclib plus letrozole arm and the placebo plus letrozole arm. The median age of patients enrolled 
in this study was 62 years (range 28-89), 48.3% of patients had received chemotherapy and 56.3% had 
received antihormonal therapy in the (neo)adjuvant setting prior to their diagnosis of advanced breast 
cancer while 37.2% of patients had received no prior systemic therapy in the (neo)adjuvant setting. 
The majority of patients (97.4%) had metastatic disease at baseline, 23.6% of patients had bone-only 
disease, and 49.2% of patients had visceral disease. 
The primary endpoint of the study was progression-free survival (PFS) evaluated according to 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) v1.1, as assessed by investigator. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included objective response (OR), clinical benefit response (CBR), 
safety, and change in quality of life (QoL).  
At the data cutoff date of 26-February-2016, the study met its primary objective of improving PFS. 
The observed hazard ratio (HR) was 0.576 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.46, 0.72) in favour of 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
palbociclib plus letrozole, with a stratified log-rank test 1-sided p-value of < 0.000001. An updated 
analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints was performed after an additional 15 months of 
follow up (data cutoff date: 31-May-2017). A total of 405 PFS events were observed; 245 events 
(55.2%) in the palbociclib plus letrozole arm and 160 (72.1%) in the comparator arm respectively. 
Table 6 shows the efficacy results based on the primary and the updated analyses from the 
PALOMA-2 study, as assessed by the investigator and by the independent review.

PAL=palbociclib; LET=letrozole; PBO=placebo. 
A series of prespecified subgroup PFS analyses was performed based on prognostic factors and 
baseline characteristics to investigate the internal consistency of treatment effect. A reduction in the 
risk of disease progression or death in favour of the palbociclib plus letrozole arm was observed in all 
individual patient subgroups defined by stratification factors and baseline characteristics in the 
primary and in the updated analysis.  
Based on the 31-May-2017 data cutoff date, this reduction in risk continued to be observed in the 
following subgroups: (1) patients with either visceral metastases (HR of 0.62 [95% CI: 0.47, 0.81], 
median progression-free survival [mPFS] 19.3 months versus 12.3 months) or without visceral 
metastases (HR of 0.50 [95% CI: 0.37, 0.67], mPFS 35.9 months versus 17.0 months) and (2) patients 
with either bone only disease (HR of 0.41 [95% CI: 0.26, 0.63], mPFS 36.2 months versus 
11.2 months) or without bone-only disease (HR of 0.62 [95% CI: 0.50, 0.78], mPFS 24.2 months 
versus 14.5 months). Similarly, a reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in the 
palbociclib plus letrozole arm was observed in 512 patients whose tumour tested positive for Rb 
protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (HR of 0.543 [95% CI: 0.433, 0.681], mPFS 
27.4 months versus 13.7 months). For the 51 patients IHC negative for Rb expression, the difference 
between treatment arms was not statistically significant (HR of 0.868 [95% CI: 0.424, 1.777], mPFS 
23.2 versus 18.5 months) for the palbociclib plus letrozole arm versus the placebo plus letrozole arm, 
respectively. 
Additional efficacy measures (OR and time to response [TTR]) assessed in the sub-groups of patients 
with or without visceral disease based on the 31-May-2017 updated cutoff date are displayed in

Randomised Phase 3 Study PALOMA-3: IBRANCE in combination with fulvestrant  
The efficacy of palbociclib in combination with fulvestrant versus fulvestrant plus placebo was 
evaluated in an international, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, multicentre study conducted in 
women with HR-positive, HER2-negative locally advanced breast cancer not amenable to resection or 
radiation therapy with curative intent or metastatic breast cancer, regardless of their menopausal 
status, whose disease progressed after prior endocrine therapy in the (neo)adjuvant or metastatic 
setting. 
A total of 521 pre/peri- and postmenopausal women who had progressed on or within 12 months from 
completion of adjuvant endocrine therapy or on or within 1 month from prior endocrine therapy for 
advanced disease, were randomised 2:1 to palbociclib plus fulvestrant or placebo plus fulvestrant and 
stratified by documented sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy, menopausal status at study entry 
(pre/peri- versus postmenopausal), and presence of visceral metastases. Pre/perimenopausal women 
received the LHRH agonist goserelin. Patients with advanced/metastatic, symptomatic, visceral 
spread, that were at risk of life-threatening complications in the short term (including patients with 
massive uncontrolled effusions [pleural, pericardial, peritoneal], pulmonary lymphangitis, and over 
50% liver involvement), were not eligible for enrolment into the study. 
Patients continued to receive assigned treatment until objective disease progression, symptomatic 
deterioration, unacceptable toxicity, death, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurred first. 
Crossover between treatment arms was not allowed.  
Patients were well matched for baseline demographics and prognostic characteristics between the 
palbociclib plus fulvestrant arm and the placebo plus fulvestrant arm. The median age of patients 
enrolled in this study was 57 years (range 29, 88). In each treatment arm the majority of patients were 
White, had documented sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy, and were postmenopausal. 
Approximately 20% of patients were pre/perimenopausal. All patients had received prior systemic 
therapy and most patients in each treatment arm had received a previous chemotherapy regimen for 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
their primary diagnosis. More than half (62%) had an ECOG PS of 0, 60% had visceral metastases, 
and 60% had received more than 1 prior hormonal regimen for their primary diagnosis. 
The primary endpoint of the study was investigator-assessed PFS evaluated according to RECIST 1.1. 
Supportive PFS analyses were based on an Independent Central Radiology Review. Secondary 
endpoints included OR, CBR, OS, safety, and time-to-deterioration (TTD) in pain endpoint.  
The study met its primary endpoint of prolonging investigator-assessed PFS at the interim analysis 
conducted on 82% of the planned PFS events; the results crossed the prespecified Haybittle-Peto 
efficacy boundary (α=0.00135), demonstrating a statistically significant prolongation in PFS and a 
clinically meaningful treatment effect.  
A more mature update of efficacy data is reported in Table 9. 
After a median follow-up time of 45 months, the final OS analysis was performed based on 310 events 
(60% of randomised patients). A 6.9-month difference in median OS in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant 
arm compared with the placebo plus fulvestrant arm was observed; this result was not statistically 
significant at the prespecified significance level of 0.0235 (1-sided). In the placebo plus fulvestrant 
arm, 15.5% of randomised patients received palbociclib and other CDK inhibitors as post progression 
subsequent treatments. 
The results from the investigator-assessed PFS and final OS data from PALOMA-3 study are 
presented in Table 9. The relevant Kaplan-Meier plots are shown in Figures 3 and 4, respectively.

A reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant arm was 
observed in all individual patient subgroups defined by stratification factors and baseline 
characteristics. This was evident for pre/perimenopausal women (HR of 0.46 [95% CI: 0.28, 0.75]) 
and postmenopausal women (HR of 0.52 [95% CI: 0.40, 0.66]) and patients with visceral site of 
metastatic disease (HR of 0.50 [95% CI: 0.38, 0.65]) and non-visceral site of metastatic disease (HR of 
0.48 [95% CI: 0.33, 0.71]). Benefit was also observed regardless of lines of prior therapy in the 
metastatic setting, whether 0 (HR of 0.59 [95% CI: 0.37, 0.93]), 1 (HR of 0.46 [95% CI: 0.32,

Patient-reported symptoms were assessed using the European Organisation for Research and 
Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 and its Breast Cancer Module 
(EORTC QLQ-BR23). A total of 335 patients in the palbociclib plus fulvestrant arm and 166 patients 
in the fulvestrant only arm completed the questionnaire at baseline and at least 1 postbaseline visit. 
Time-to-Deterioration was prespecified as time between baseline and first occurrence of ≥ 10 points 
increase from baseline in pain symptom scores. Addition of palbociclib to fulvestrant resulted in a 
symptom benefit by significantly delaying time-to-deterioration in pain symptom compared with 
placebo plus fulvestrant (median 8.0 months versus 2.8 months; HR of 0.64 [95% CI: 0.49, 0.85]; 
p< 0.001).   
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
IBRANCE in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of breast carcinoma (see 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics of palbociclib were characterised in patients with solid tumours including 
advanced breast cancer and in healthy volunteers. 
Absorption 
The Cmax of palbociclib is generally observed between 4 to 12 hours (time to reach maximum 
concentration [Tmax]) following oral administration of IBRANCE tablets. The mean absolute 
bioavailability of palbociclib after an oral 125 mg dose is 46%. In the dosing range of 25 mg to 
225 mg, the area under the curve (AUC) and Cmax increase proportionally with dose in general. Steady 
state was achieved within 8 days following repeated once daily dosing. With repeated once daily 
administration, palbociclib accumulates with a median accumulation ratio of 2.4 (range 1.5-4.2). 
Food effect 
The AUCinf and Cmax of palbociclib increased by 22% and 26%, respectively, when IBRANCE tablets 
were given with a high-fat, high-calorie meal (approximately 800 to 1,000 calories with 150, 250, and 
500 to 600 calories from protein, carbohydrate, and fat, respectively), and by 9% and 10%, 
respectively, when IBRANCE tablets were given with a moderate fat, standard-calorie meal 
(approximately 500 to 700 calories with 75 to 105, 250 to 350, and 175 to 245 calories from protein, 
carbohydrate, and fat, respectively), compared to IBRANCE tablets given under overnight fasted 
conditions. Based on these results, palbociclib tablets may be taken with or without food.  
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
Binding of palbociclib to human plasma proteins in vitro was ~85%, with no concentration 
dependence. The mean fraction unbound (fu) of palbociclib in human plasma in vivo increased 
incrementally with worsening hepatic function. There was no obvious trend in the mean palbociclib fu 
in human plasma in vivo with worsening renal function. In vitro, the uptake of palbociclib into human 
hepatocytes occurred mainly via passive diffusion. Palbociclib is not a substrate of OATP1B1 or 
OATP1B3. 
Biotransformation 
In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that palbociclib undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism in 
humans. Following oral administration of a single 125 mg dose of [14C]palbociclib to humans, the 
major primary metabolic pathways for palbociclib involved oxidation and sulphonation, with acylation 
and glucuronidation contributing as minor pathways. Palbociclib was the major circulating 
drug-derived entity in plasma.  
The majority of the material was excreted as metabolites. In faeces, the sulfamic acid conjugate of 
palbociclib was the major drug-related component, accounting for 25.8% of the administered dose. 
In vitro studies with human hepatocytes, liver cytosolic and S9 fractions, and recombinant 
sulphotransferase (SULT) enzymes indicated that CYP3A and SULT2A1 are mainly involved in the 
metabolism of palbociclib. 
Elimination 
The geometric mean apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of palbociclib was 63 L/h, and the mean plasma 
elimination half-life was 28.8 hours in patients with advanced breast cancer. In 6 healthy male subjects 
given a single oral dose of [14C]palbociclib, a median of 92% of the total administered radioactive 
dose was recovered in 15 days; faeces (74% of dose) was the major route of excretion, with 17% of 
the dose recovered in urine. Excretion of unchanged palbociclib in faeces and urine was 2% and 7% of 
the administered dose, respectively. 
In vitro, palbociclib is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6, and is not an 
inducer of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, and 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. 
In vitro evaluations indicate that palbociclib has low potential to inhibit the activities of organic anion 
transporter (OAT)1, OAT3, organic cation transporter (OCT)2, organic anion transporting polypeptide 
(OATP)1B1, OATP1B3, and bile salt export pump (BSEP) at clinically relevant concentrations.  
Special populations 
Age, gender, and body weight 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 183 patients with cancer (50 male and 133 female 
patients, age ranging from 22 to 89 years, and body weight ranging from 38 to 123 kg), gender had no 
effect on the exposure of palbociclib, and age and body weight had no clinically important effect on 
the exposure of palbociclib. 
Paediatric population 
Pharmacokinetics of palbociclib has not been evaluated in patients < 18 years of age. 
Hepatic impairment 
Data from a pharmacokinetic study in subjects with varying degrees of hepatic function indicate that 
palbociclib unbound exposure (unbound AUCinf) decreased by 17% in subjects with mild hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh class A), and increased by 34% and 77% in subjects with moderate 
(Child-Pugh class B) and severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment, respectively, relative to 
subjects with normal hepatic function. Peak palbociclib unbound exposure (unbound Cmax) was 
increased by 7%, 38% and 72% for mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment, respectively, 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
relative to subjects with normal hepatic function. In addition, based on a population pharmacokinetic 
analysis that included 183 patients with advanced cancer, where 40 patients had mild hepatic 
impairment based on National Cancer Institute (NCI) classification (total bilirubin ≤ Upper Limit of 
Normal (ULN) and Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) > ULN, or total bilirubin > 1.0 to 1.5 × ULN 
and any AST), mild hepatic impairment had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of palbociclib. 
Renal impairment 
Data from a pharmacokinetic study in subjects with varying degrees of renal function indicate that 
total palbociclib exposure (AUCinf) increased by 39%, 42%, and 31% with mild 
(60 mL/min ≤ CrCl < 90 mL/min), moderate (30 mL/min ≤ CrCl < 60 mL/min), and severe 
(CrCl < 30 mL/min) renal impairment, respectively, relative to subjects with normal 
(CrCl ≥ 90 mL/min) renal function. Peak palbociclib exposure (Cmax) was increased by 17%, 12%, and 
15% for mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively, relative to subjects with normal 
renal function. In addition, based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis that included 183 patients 
with advanced cancer, where 73 patients had mild renal impairment and 29 patients had moderate 
renal impairment, mild and moderate renal impairment had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of 
palbociclib. The pharmacokinetics of palbociclib have not been studied in patients requiring 
haemodialysis. 
Ethnicity 
In a pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers, palbociclib AUCinf and Cmax values were 30% and 
35% higher, respectively, in Japanese subjects compared with non-Asian subjects after a single oral 
dose. However, this finding was not reproduced consistently in subsequent studies in Japanese or 
Asian breast cancer patients after multiple dosing. Based on an analysis of the cumulative 
pharmacokinetic, safety, and efficacy data across Asian and non-Asian populations, no dose 
adjustment based on Asian race is considered necessary. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
The primary target organ findings following single and/or repeat dosing included 
haematolymphopoietic and male reproductive organ effects in rats and dogs, and effects on bone and 
actively growing incisors in rats only. These systemic toxicities were generally observed at clinically 
relevant exposures based on AUC. Partial to full reversal of effects on the hematolymphopoietic, male 
reproductive systems, and incisor teeth were established, whereas the bone effect was not reversed 
following a 12-week nondosing period. In addition, cardiovascular effects (QTc prolongation, 
decreased heart rate, and increased RR interval and systolic blood pressure) were identified in 
telemetered dogs at ≥ 4 times human clinical exposure based on Cmax.  
Carcinogenicity 
Palbociclib was assessed for carcinogenicity in a 6-month transgenic mouse study and in a 2-year rat 
study. Palbociclib was negative for carcinogenicity in transgenic mice at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day 
(No Observed Effect Level [NOEL] approximately 11 times human clinical exposure based on AUC). 
Palbociclib-related neoplastic finding in rats included an increased incidence of microglial cell 
tumours in the central nervous system of males at 30 mg/kg/day; there were no neoplastic findings in 
female rats at any dose up to 200 mg/kg/day. The NOEL for palbociclib-related carcinogenicity effects 
was 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 2 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC) and 
200 mg/kg/day (approximately 4 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC) in males and 
females, respectively. The relevance of the male rat neoplastic finding to humans is unknown. 
Genotoxicity 
Palbociclib was not mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay and did not induce 
structural chromosomal aberrations in the in vitro human lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay. 
Palbociclib induced micronuclei via an aneugenic mechanism in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells in vitro 
and in the bone marrow of male rats at doses ≥ 100 mg/kg/day. The exposure of animals at the no 
44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
observed effect level for aneugenicity was approximately 7 times human clinical exposure based on 
AUC. 
Impairment of fertility 
Palbociclib did not affect mating or fertility in female rats at any dose tested up to 300 mg/kg/day 
(approximately 3 times human clinical exposure based on AUC), and no adverse effects were 
observed in female reproductive tissues in repeat-dose toxicity studies up to 300 mg/kg/day in the rat 
and 3 mg/kg/day in the dog (approximately 5 and 3 times human clinical exposure based on AUC, 
respectively).  
Palbociclib is considered to have the potential to impair reproductive function and fertility in male 
humans based on non-clinical findings in rats and dogs. Palbociclib-related findings in the testis, 
epididymis, prostate, and seminal vesicle included decreased organ weight, atrophy or degeneration, 
hypospermia, intratubular cellular debris, lower sperm motility and density, and decreased secretion. 
These findings were observed in rats and/or dogs at exposures ≥ 9 times or subtherapeutic compared to 
human clinical exposure based on AUC, respectively. Partial reversibility of male reproductive organ 
effects was observed in the rat and dog following a 4- and 12-week nondosing period, respectively. 
Despite these male reproductive organ findings, there were no effects on mating or fertility in male 
rats at projected exposure levels 13 times human clinical exposure based on AUC. 
Developmental toxicity 
Palbociclib is a reversible inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6, which are both involved in 
regulating the cell cycle. It may therefore have risk of foetal harm if used during pregnancy. 
Palbociclib was foetotoxic in pregnant animals. An increased incidence of a skeletal variation 
(increased incidence of a rib present at the seventh cervical vertebra) at ≥ 100 mg/kg/day was observed 
in rats. Reduced foetal body weights were observed at a maternally toxic dose of 300 mg/kg/day in 
rats (3 times human clinical exposure based on AUC), and an increased incidence of skeletal 
variations, including small phalanges in the forelimb was observed at a maternally toxic dose of 
20 mg/kg/day in rabbits (4 times human clinical exposure based on AUC). Actual foetal exposure and 
cross-placenta transfer have not been examined.

This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them,

2.  What you need to know before you take IBRANCE 
3.  How to take IBRANCE 
4.  Possible side effects 
5.  How to store IBRANCE 
6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What IBRANCE is and what it is used for 
IBRANCE is an anticancer medicine containing the active substance palbociclib.  
Palbociclib works by blocking proteins called cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6, which regulate cell 
growth and division. Blocking these proteins can slow down growth of cancer cells and delay the 
progression of your cancer.  
IBRANCE is used to treat patients with certain types of breast cancer (hormone receptor-positive, 
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative) which have spread beyond the original tumour 
and/or to other organs. It is given together with aromatase inhibitors or fulvestrant, which are used as 
hormonal anticancer therapies. 
2.  What you need to know before you take IBRANCE  
Do not take IBRANCE 
- 
- 
if you are allergic to palbociclib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).  
use of preparations containing St. John’s Wort, an herbal product used to treat mild depression 
and anxiety, should be avoided while you are taking IBRANCE. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking IBRANCE. 
IBRANCE may reduce the number of your white blood cells and weaken your immune system. 
Therefore, you may be at greater risk of getting an infection while you are taking IBRANCE. 
95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you experience signs or symptoms of an infection, such as 
chills or fever. 
You will have regular blood tests during treatment to check whether IBRANCE affects your blood 
cells (white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets).  
IBRANCE may cause blood clots in the veins. Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you experience 
signs or symptoms of blood clots in the veins such as pain or stiffness, swelling and redness in the 
affected leg (or arm), chest pain, shortness of breath or lightheadedness. 
IBRANCE may cause severe or life-threatening inflammation of the lungs during treatment that can 
lead to death. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any new or worsening symptoms 
including: 
•  difficulty breathing or shortness of breath 
•  dry cough  
• 
chest pain 
Children and adolescents 
IBRANCE is not to be used in children or adolescents (under 18 years of age). 
Other medicines and IBRANCE 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines. IBRANCE may affect the way some other medicines work. 
In particular, the following may increase the risk of side effects with IBRANCE: 
•  Lopinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, telaprevir, and saquinavir used to treat HIV 
infection/AIDS. 
•  Clarithromycin and telithromycin antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections.

1.  What IBRANCE is and what it is used for 
IBRANCE is an anticancer medicine containing the active substance palbociclib.  
Palbociclib works by blocking proteins called cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6, which regulate cell 
growth and division. Blocking these proteins can slow down growth of cancer cells and delay the 
progression of your cancer.  
IBRANCE is used to treat patients with certain types of breast cancer (hormone receptor-positive, 
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative) which have spread beyond the original tumour 
and/or to other organs. It is given together with aromatase inhibitors or fulvestrant, which are used as 
hormonal anticancer therapies. 
2.  What you need to know before you take IBRANCE

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for palbociclib, the scientific 
conclusions of the CHMP are as follows: 
In view of available data on venous thromboembolism from the literature, clinical trials, spontaneous 
reports including 531 cases with a close temporal relationship, and in view of a possible class effect 
for CDK4/6 inhibitors, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between palbociclib and venous 
tromboembolism is at least a reasonable possibility.  
Furthermore, in view of available data on Palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (PPES) from 
clinical trial(s), the literature, spontaneous reports including in some cases a close temporal 
relationship, a positive de-challenge and/or re-challenge and in view of a plausible mechanism of 
action, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between palbociclib and PPES is at least a reasonable 
possibility.  
The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing palbociclib should be 
amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s)  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for palbociclib the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product containing palbociclib is unchanged subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.

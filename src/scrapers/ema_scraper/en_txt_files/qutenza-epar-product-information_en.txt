4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Qutenza is indicated for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain in adults either alone or in 
combination with other medicinal products for the treatment of pain.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
The Qutenza cutaneous patch should be applied by a physician or by a health care professional under 
the supervision of a physician.
Posology
The cutaneous patch should be applied to the most painful skin areas (using up to a maximum of 
4 patches). The painful area should be determined by the physician or by a health care professional 
and marked on the skin. Qutenza must be applied to intact, non-irritated, dry skin, and allowed to 
remain in place for 30 minutes for the feet (e.g. HIV-associated neuropathy, painful diabetic peripheral 
neuropathy) and 60 minutes for other locations (e.g. postherpetic neuralgia).
Qutenza treatments may be repeated every 90 days, as warranted by the persistence or return of pain.
Re-treatment after less than 90 days can be considered for individual patients only after a careful 
assessment by the physician (see also section 5.1). A minimum interval of 60 days between treatments 
is to be observed.
It is recommended to treat sufficiently long and to reassess effectiveness on a case-by-case basis after 
3 treatments.
The treatment area may be pre-treated with a topical anaesthetic or the patient may be administered an 
oral analgesic prior to application of Qutenza to reduce potential application related discomfort. The 
2
topical anaesthetic should be applied to cover the entire Qutenza treatment area and surrounding 1 to 
2 cm. Topical anaesthetics should be removed prior to applying Qutenza and the skin washed and 
dried thoroughly.
Renal and/or hepatic impairment
No dose adjustment is required for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of Qutenza in children from birth to 18 years has not been established. No data 
are available.
Method of administration
Cutaneous use only.
Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product
It is advisable to administer Qutenza in a well ventilated treatment area.
Nitrile gloves should be worn at all times while handling Qutenza and cleaning treatment areas. Latex 
gloves should NOT be worn as they do not provide adequate protection. Use of a mask and protective 
glasses is recommended, particularly during application and removal of the patch.
These precautions should be taken to avoid unintentional contact with the patches or other materials 
that have come in contact with the treated areas. This may result in transient erythema and burning 
sensation (with mucous membranes being particularly susceptible), eye pain, eye and throat irritation 
and cough. 
Patches should not be held near eyes or mucous membranes.
If necessary, hairs in the affected area should be clipped to promote patch adherence (do not shave). 
The treatment area(s) should be gently washed with soap and water. Following hair removal and 
washing, the skin should be thoroughly dried.
Instructions for use
Qutenza is a single use patch and can be cut to match the size and shape of the treatment area. Qutenza 
should be cut prior to removal of the release liner. The release liner should NOT be removed until just 
prior to application. There is a diagonal cut in the release liner to aid in its removal. A section of the 
release liner should be peeled and folded and the adhesive side of the printed patch placed on the 
treatment area. The patch should be held in place. The release liner should slowly and carefully be 
peeled from underneath with one hand while the patch should simultaneously be smoothed onto the 
skin with the other to ensure that there is complete contact between the patch and the skin, with no air 
bubbles and no moisture.
When treating feet, Qutenza patches can be wrapped around the dorsal, lateral and plantar surfaces of 
each foot to completely cover the treatment area.
To ensure Qutenza maintains contact to the treatment area, stretchable socks or rolled gauze may be 
used.
The Qutenza patches should be removed gently and slowly by rolling them inward to minimize the 
risk of aerosolisation of capsaicin. After removal of Qutenza, cleansing gel should be applied liberally 
to the treatment area and left on for at least one minute. Cleansing gel should be wiped off with dry 
gauze to remove any remaining capsaicin from the skin. After the cleansing gel has been wiped off, 
the area should be gently washed with soap and water.
3
Patients experiencing pain during and after patch application should be provided with supportive 
treatment (see section 4.4)
For instructions on handling and disposal of the treatment materials see section 6.6.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Dermal assessment
Qutenza must be used only on dry, intact (unbroken) skin and not on the face, above the hairline of the 
scalp, and/or in proximity to mucous membranes. In patients with painful diabetic peripheral 
neuropathy, a careful visual examination of the feet should be undertaken prior to each application of 
Qutenza and at subsequent clinic visits to detect skin lesions related to underlying neuropathy and
vascular insufficiency.
Sensory function
Reductions in sensory function have been reported following administration of Qutenza. Decreases in 
sensory functions are generally minor and temporary (including to thermal and sharp stimuli), 
however, a single case of persistent hypoesthesia has been reported in clinical studies in painful 
diabetic neuropathy. For this case a relationship with Qutenza could not be excluded. Caution should 
be exercised in patients with reduced sensation in the feet and in those at increased risk for such 
changes in sensory function. All patients with pre-existing sensory deficits should be clinically 
assessed for signs of sensory loss to prior to each application of Qutenza. If sensory loss is detected or 
worsens, Qutenza treatment should be reconsidered.
Monitoring and management of application site reactions
Application site reactions, such as transient local applications site burning, pain, erythema and pruritus 
are common or very common. In addition, there have been reported cases of burns, including second-
and third-degree burns, in patients treated with capsaicin patches (see section 4.8). In patients 
reporting severe pain, the patch should be removed and the skin examined for chemical burn.
Unintended exposure
Unintended exposure to capsaicin may cause irritation of eyes, mucous membranes, respiratory tract, 
and skin in patients and healthcare professionals. Healthcare professionals should ensure that the 
recommended protective measures as outlined in Section 4.2 are applied appropriately.
If Qutenza comes in contact with skin not intended to be treated, cleansing gel should be applied for 
one minute and wiped off with dry gauze to remove any remaining capsaicin from the skin surface.  
After the cleansing gel has been wiped off, the area should be gently washed with soap and water. If 
capsaicin comes in contact with eyes or mucous membranes, these should be flushed or rinsed with
cold water. If irritation of airways, eyes, or mucous membranes occurs, the affected individual should 
leave theQutenza treatment area. Appropriate medical care should be provided if shortness of breath 
develops. If respiratory irritation (see also Section 4.8) worsens or does not resolve, the affected 
individual should carefully consider being re-exposed to Qutenza.
Increase in blood pressure
As a result of treatment-related increases in pain, transient increases in blood pressure (on average 
< 8.0 mm Hg) may occur during and shortly after the Qutenza treatment. Blood pressure should be 
monitored during the treatment procedure. For patients with unstable or poorly controlled hypertension 
4
or a history of cardiovascular disease, the risk of adverse cardiovascular events due to the potential 
stress of the procedure should be considered prior to initiating Qutenza treatment. Particular attention 
should be given to diabetic patients with comorbidities of coronary artery disease, hypertension and 
cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy.
Treatment-related discomfort
Patients experiencing pain during and after patch application should be provided with supportive 
treatment such as local cooling (such as a cool compress) or oral analgesics.
Cleansing gel
The cleansing gel for Qutenza contains butylhydroxyanisole, which may cause local skin reactions 
(e.g. contact dermatitis) or irritation of the eyes and mucous membranes.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No formal interaction studies with other medicinal products have been performed as only transient low 
levels of systemic absorption have been shown to occur with Qutenza.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of capsaicin in pregnant women. 
Based on human pharmacokinetics, which show transient, low systemic exposure to capsaicin, the 
likelihood that Qutenza increases the risk of developmental abnormalities when given to pregnant 
women is very low. However, caution should be exercised when prescribing to pregnant women.
Breast-feeding
It is unknown whether capsaicin/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available 
pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of capsaicin/metabolites in milk 
(for details see 5.3).
A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded.
Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Qutenza.
Fertility
There is no data in humans available on fertility. A reproductive toxicology study in rats showed a 
reduction in the number and percent of motile sperm and the number of pregnancies (see section 5.3). 
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Qutenza has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The most commonly reported adverse reactions were transient local application site burning, pain, 
erythema and pruritus.

Description of selected adverse reactions
6
Adverse reactions were transient, self limiting and usually mild to moderate in intensity. In controlled 
trials, the discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 2.0% for patients receiving Qutenza and 
0.9% for patients receiving control.
Temporary, minor changes in heat detection (1°C to 2°C) and sharp sensations were detected at the 
Qutenza application site in clinical trials with healthy volunteers.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
No case of overdose has been reported. Qutenza is required to be administered by a physician or under 
the supervision of a physician. Therefore, overdosing is unlikely to occur. Overdose may be associated 
with severe application site reactions, e.g. application site pain, application site erythema, application 
site pruritus. In case of suspected overdose, the patches should be removed gently, cleansing gel 
should be applied for one minute and then wiped off with dry gauze and the area should be gently 
washed with soap and water. Supportive measures should be taken as clinically needed. There is no 
antidote to capsaicin.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Anaesthetics, other local anaesthetics, ATC code: N01BX04
Mechanism of action
Capsaicin, or 6-nonenamide, N-[(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl) methyl]-8-methyl, (6E), is a highly 
selective agonist for the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 receptor (TRPV1). The initial effect of 
capsaicin is the activation of TRPV1-expressing cutaneous nociceptors, which results in pungency and 
erythema due to the release of vasoactive neuropeptides.
Pharmacodynamic effects
Following capsaicin exposure, cutaneous nociceptors become less sensitive to a variety of stimuli. 
These later-stage effects of capsaicin are frequently referred to as “desensitization” and are thought to 
underlie the pain relief. Sensations from non TRPV1-expressing cutaneous nerves are expected to 
remain unaltered, including the ability to detect mechanical and vibratory stimuli. Capsaicin-induced 
alterations in cutaneous nociceptors are reversible and it has been reported and observed that normal 
function (the detection of noxious sensations) returns within weeks in healthy volunteers.
Clinical efficacy and safety
Efficacy of a single 30-minute application of Qutenza to the feet has been shown in controlled clinical 
trials of 12 weeks duration conducted in patients with painful Human Imunodeficiency Virus –
Associated Neuropathy (HIV-AN) and painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (pDPN). Efficacy of a 
single 60-minute application of Qutenza to locations other than the feet has been shown in controlled 
clinical trials of 12 weeks duration conducted in patients with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). The 
average pain reduction after single application of Qutenza compared to baseline at week 2 to12 across 
the pivotal trials ranged between -22.8 % and -32.3%, compared to a range of -10.7% to -25.0% for 
the control patches Responder rates (response defined as a 30% decrease in average pain score from 
7
baseline) ranged between 34% and 47%, compared to a range of 18% to 36% for the control patches. 
These results were statistically significant versus low dose capsaicin (PHN and HIV-AN) or placebo 
(pDPN). Pain reduction was observed at week 1 in PHN, week 2 in HIV-AN and week 3 in pDPN. For 
all three aetiologies efficacy was maintained throughout the 12-week study period.
Consistent and reproducible efficacy and tolerability was demonstrated with repeated treatments 
during a 52-week period in two clinical trials (STRIDE and PACE). In these two trials, one in pDPN 
patients (PACE) and one in patients with HIV-AN, Post Traumatic Nerve Injury (PNI) and PHN
(STRIDE), the mean time (Standard Deviation) to retreatment was 68.4 (23.31) and 107 (43.58) days 
respectively. In these trials 25% of patients had a retreatment time shorter than 61.5 and 78.8 days 
respectively and 25% of patients had a retreatment time longer than 64.6 and 118.7 days respectively.
A frequency increase of up to approximately 5% of known application site reactions, such as pain and 
burning sensation, was reported in patients retreated with Qutenza earlier than 90 days. 
The safety profile of Qutenza in diabetic patients was consistent with that seen in the non-diabetic 
population. 
Qutenza has been shown to be effective when used alone or when used in combination with systemic 
medicinal products for neuropathic pain.
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
The capsaicin contained in Qutenza is intended for delivery into the skin. In vitro data (active 
substance dissolution and skin permeation assays) demonstrate that the rate of release of capsaicin 
from Qutenza is linear during the application time. Based on in vitro studies, approximately 1% of 
capsaicin is estimated to be absorbed into the epidermal and dermal layers of skin during one-hour 
applications. As the amount of capsaicin released from the patch per hour is proportional to the surface 
area of application, this amounts to an estimated total maximum possible dose for a 1000 cm2 area of 
application of approximately 7 mg. Assuming 1000 cm2 of patch area delivers approximately 1% of 
capsaicin from the patch to a 60 kg person, the maximum potential exposure to capsaicin is 
approximately 0.12 mg/kg, once every 3 months.
According to the EC Scientific Committee on Food, the average European oral intake of capsaicin is 
1.5 mg/day (0.025 mg/kg/day for a 60 kg person) and the highest dietary exposure is 25 to 200 mg/day 
(up to 3.3 mg/kg/day for a 60 kg person).
Pharmacokinetic data in humans showed transient, low (< 5 ng/ml) systemic exposure to capsaicin in 
about one third of PHN patients, in 3% of patients with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy and in 
no HIV-AN patients following 60-minute applications of Qutenza. No data are available following 
30-minute treatments. In general, the proportions of PHN patients with systemic exposure to capsaicin 
increased with larger treatment areas and with longer treatment durations. The highest concentration of 
capsaicin detected in patients treated for 60 minutes was 4.6 ng/mL, which occurred immediately after 
Qutenza removal. Most quantifiable levels were observed at the time of Qutenza removal, with a clear 
trend towards disappearance by 3 to 6 hours after Qutenza removal. No detectable levels of 
metabolites were observed in any subject.
A population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients treated for 60 and 90 minutes indicated that 
capsaicin levels in plasma peaked around 20 minutes after Qutenza removal and declined very rapidly, 
with a mean elimination half-life of about 130 minutes.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, single-dose toxicity, and repeated-dose toxicity.
8
Genotoxicity studies performed with capsaicin show a weak mutagenic response in the mouse 
lymphoma assay and negative responses in the Ames, mouse micronucleus and chromosomal 
aberrationin human peripheral blood lymphocytes assays.
A carcinogenicity study performed in mice indicates that capsaicin is not carcinogenic.
A reproductive toxicology study conducted in rats showed a statistically significant reduction in the 
number and percent of motile sperms in rats treated 3 hours/day beginning 28 days before 
cohabitation, through cohabitation and continuing through the day before sacrifice. Although neither 
statistically significant nor dose dependent, the Fertility Index and the number of pregnancies per 
number of rats in cohabitation were reduced in all capsaicin-treated groups.
A teratology study conducted in rabbits did not show any potential for embryofetal toxicity. Delays in 
skeletal ossification (reductions in ossified metatarsals) were observed in a rat teratology study at dose 
levels higher than human therapeutic levels; the significance of this finding for humans is unknown. 
Peri- and post-natal toxicology studies, conducted in rats do not show potential for reproductive 
toxicity. Lactating rats exposed to Qutenza daily for 3 hours showed measurable levels of capsaicin in 
the mothers’ milk.
A mild sensitization was seen in a cutaneous sensitization study with guinea pigs.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What Qutenza is and what it is used for
Qutenza contains capsaicin and belongs to a group of medicines called anaesthetics. 
Qutenza is indicated for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain in adults either alone or in 
combination with other medicines for the treatment of pain.
Qutenza is used to relieve pain in people who have nerve pain due to damaged nerves in the skin. 
Damaged nerves in your skin may occur as a result of a variety of diseases such as shingles, HIV 
infection, diabetes, certain medicines and other conditions. You may experience pain relief between 1 
and 3 weeks after treatment.
2. What you need to know before Qutenza is used
Do not use Qutenza

if you are allergic to capsaicin (also present in chili peppers) or any other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6).
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor before using Qutenza
Do not use Qutenza on any part of your head or face.
Do not use Qutenza on broken skin or open wounds.
Do not touch Qutenza or other materials that have come in contact with the treated areas as it may 
cause burning and stinging. Do not touch your eyes, mouth or other sensitive areas as it may cause 
irritation and pain. If this happens, flush or rinse with cold water. Sniffing or inhaling close to the 
Qutenza patches may cause coughing, throat irritation or sneezing.
It is usual for the skin to sting or become red and burn during and after Qutenza treatment for a short 
while. Because of the pain, your blood pressure may go up and therefore, your doctor will measure 
24
your blood pressure several times during your treatment. If you experience a lot of pain, your doctor 
will apply local cooling or give you medicine for pain. If you experience very severe pain, ask your 
doctor to remove the patch. 
Generally small, short-term changes in the ability to feel when something is hot or sharp have been 
seen after use of capsaicin.
If you have unstable or poorly controlled high blood pressure or had heart problems, your doctor will 
consider the risk of side effects to your heart or blood pressure due to the potential stress of the 
procedure before treating you with Qutenza.
Children and adolescents
Qutenza is not recommended for treatment in patients under 18 years of age.
Other medicines and Qutenza
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. Qutenza acts 
locally on your skin and is not expected to influence other medicines.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
Qutenza should be used with caution if you are pregnant. You should discontinue breastfeeding before 
treatment with Qutenza is started. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or 
are planning to have a baby ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine.
Driving and using machines
There are no studies of the effects of Qutenza on the ability to drive and use machines. When using 
Qutenza, only very small amounts of the active substance may be present in the blood stream for a 
very short time. Therefore, Qutenza is unlikely to have any direct effects on your ability to concentrate
or your ability to drive or use machinery.
Cleansing gel for Qutenza contains butylhydroxyanisole
The cleansing gel for Qutenza contains butylhydroxyanisole which may cause local skin reactions (e.g. 
contact dermatitis), or irritation of the eyes and mucous membranes.
3.
How to use Qutenza
Qutenza should only be applied by your doctor or by a nurse under the supervision of your doctor.
No more than 4 patches should be used at the same time.
Qutenza is for use on your skin.
Your doctor or nurse will mark the most painful areas on your skin with a pen or marker.
Before placing the Qutenza patches on the skin, the treatment area(s) will be washed with soap and 
water and dried. Hair in treatment areas will be clipped.
Before placing the Qutenza patches on the skin, your doctor or nurse may apply a numbing gel or 
cream or give you an oral pain medicine to reduce potential stinging. The gel or cream should be 
removed prior to applying Qutenza and the skin washed and dried thoroughly.
25
Your doctor or nurse may wear gloves, and sometimes a mask and protective glasses, while handling
the Qutenza patches. Do not sniff or inhale close to the Qutenza patches as this may cause coughing or 
sneezing. 
Qutenza may be cut into smaller pieces to fit the treatment area. Your doctor or nurse will remove the 
patches after 30 minutes if you’re being treated for nerve pain on your feet or 60 minutes if you’re 
being treated for nerve pain on other parts of your body.
It may take between 1 to 3 weeks before you experience pain relief with Qutenza. If after that time you 
still have a lot of pain, please talk to your doctor.
Qutenza therapy may be repeated at 90-day intervals, if necessary. If you experience insufficient pain 
relief or pain returns earlier, please consult your doctor.
You may be given pain medicines to take for the pain you experience with Qutenza therapy.
It is common for the skin to sting or become red and burn during Qutenza treatment.
Disposable socks may be worn on top of the Qutenza patches if your feet are being treated.
Sometimes your doctor or nurse may put a bandage on top of the Qutenza patch to keep the patch 
firmly on your skin.
Do not attempt to remove the patch yourself. Your doctor or nurse will remove it for you.
At the end of the Qutenza treatment your doctor or nurse will clean the treated skin with cleansing gel 
from a tube supplied with the kit. Cleansing gel will be left on your skin for one minute and then 
wiped off to remove any remaining medicine that may be left on your skin after treatment. After the 
cleansing gel has been wiped off, the area will be gently washed with soap and water.
Do not touch the patch with your hands.
Do not touch your eyes, mouth or other sensitive areas. If you accidentally touch the Qutenza patch 
or treated skin before cleansing gel is applied it may burn and/or sting. Call your doctor immediately.
Do not take Qutenza patches away from the clinic.
Do not use Qutenza patches at home.
If Qutenza is used longer than it should
Overdosing is unlikely to occur. However, if Qutenza is applied longer than it should you might 
experience severe application site reactions like pain, redness and itching.
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist

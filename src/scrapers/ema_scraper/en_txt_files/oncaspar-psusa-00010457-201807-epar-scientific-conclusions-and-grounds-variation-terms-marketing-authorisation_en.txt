Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for pegaspargase (centrally authorised 
product), the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Cumulatively there were 62 reports of gamma-glutamyl transferase increased. Of the 62 events, 54 cases 
were considered related (of which 21 were from clinical trials) and 8 were considered not related. Based on 
the presented data and given the known liver toxicity associated with Oncaspar, the adverse event 
‘increased Gamma-glutamyl transferase’ should be added to the product information.  
Section 4.4 of the SmPC already states that “It is strongly recommended that every time Oncaspar is 
administered to a patient, the name and lot number of the product are recorded in order to link the patient 
and the lot of the product”. This information should also be included in the Package Leaflet. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for pegaspargase (centrally authorised product) the CHMP is of 
the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing pegaspargase (centrally 
authorised product) is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

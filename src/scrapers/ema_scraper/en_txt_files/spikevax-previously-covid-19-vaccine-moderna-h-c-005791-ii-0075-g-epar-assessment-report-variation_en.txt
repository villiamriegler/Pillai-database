2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
COVID-19 is the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV2. The virus first emerged as a 
human pathogen in Wuhan province in China and has spread world-wide causing a pandemic. The WHO 
declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic in March 2020. The virus infects the airways and causes 
a broad spectrum of respiratory infection from asymptomatic infection to Severe Acute Respiratory 
Syndrome (SARS). 
The SARS-CoV-2 virus has repeatedly evolved and appeared in several variants causing new waves of 
infection. The variants have so far shown cross-reactivity with the original strain, which was the base for 
the currently approved vaccines. However, there is a concern that presently circulating virus variants are 
less cross-reactive with the original strain. The variant causing the latest waves of disease at the time of 
this application has been the Omicron variant, with several subvariants beginning with BA.1. Currently 
BA.5 is dominating in the EU. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Spikevax (also referred to COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna or mRNA-1273) is a vaccine developed for 
prevention of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2. It is based on nucleoside-modified mRNA encoding for 
the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein of the prototype Wuhan-Hu-1 virus isolate. The SARS-CoV-2 
S-protein is modified with 2 proline substitutions within the heptad repeat 1 domain (S-2P) to stabilise 
the spike protein into a prefusion conformation. The mRNA is encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNP). 
Spikevax has received conditional marketing authorisation in the EU according to Art. 14-a of Regulation 
(EC) No 726/2004. Following Emergency Use Authorization of mRNA-1273, the phase 3 trial protocol 
(COronavirus Vaccine Efficacy [COVE]; mRNA-1273-P301) was amended (23 December 2020) from the 
observer-blind part of the study to an open-label part that is ongoing. 
Spikevax is currently indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in 
individuals 6 years of age and older (conditional marketing authorisation on 06-01-2021).  
Spikevax is administered as a course of two 100 µg doses to individuals 12 years of age and older and to 
children 6 through 11 years of age as a course of two 50 µg doses, which is half of the primary dose for 
individuals 12 years and older. A third dose of Spikevax may be given at least 28 days after the second 
dose to individuals 12 years of age and older (100 µg) and children 6 through 11 years (50 µg) who are 
severely immunocompromised. 
A booster dose of Spikevax at a dose of 50 µg mRNA-1273 given at least 3 months after completion of 
the primary series has been approved for adults 18 years of age and older and for adolescents aged 12 to 
<18 years. 
Due to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants the MAH has developed modified, variant-matched 
bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccines that contain equal amounts of two mRNAs that encode for the Spike 
protein of the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan-Hu-1) and antigenically divergent variants of concern, each 
encapsulated into individual LNPs, and co-formulated into a single drug product. 
Assessment report  
EMA/896245/2022 
Page 7/191 
 
 
 
 
The inclusion of both the original and the variant spikes in the vaccine are intended to broaden immunity 
as significantly as possible. To that end, inclusion of the Wuhan spike is intended for reactivation and 
boosting of memory immune cell populations, increasing immunity that was previously present. Inclusion 
of the variant spike, which has novel epitopes present primarily on the receptor binding site (RBD) and 
the N-terminal domain (NTD), is intended to engage new naïve immune populations and to elicit new 
memory responses.  
The purpose of this submission is to request an amendment to expand booster vaccination for individuals 
≥12 years of age to permit the use of the variant-modified bivalent mRNA-1273.214 (Original + Omicron) 
vaccine, 50 µg dose, for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2. 
The dosing regimen is proposed to be an interval of at least 3 months following a primary series or 
previous booster dose with Spikevax or another authorised/approved COVID-19 vaccine. 
The MAH provided results from study P205 in order to infer vaccine efficacy from immunogenicity 
endpoints. Study mRNA-1273-P205 is an ongoing open label Phase 2/3 study with multiple, sequentially-
enrolled cohorts to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of variant-modified booster candidate 
vaccines. This submission includes the Day 29 interim results analysing the safety and immunogenicity of 
the mRNA-1273.214 50 µg booster vaccine as well as supportive safety and immunogenicity data of the 
Day 181 interim analysis results of the mRNA-1273.211 50 µg booster vaccine. The mRNA-1273.211 Day 
181 interim analysis also includes Day 29 immunogenicity data. 
Study P205 Part G evaluated the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of 50 µg of mRNA 1273.214 
when administered as a second booster dose in adults who previously received 2 doses of 100 µg mRNA-
1273 as a primary series and a single booster dose of 50 µg mRNA-1273.  
Study P205 Part F (cohort 2) evaluated the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of 50 µg of mRNA-
1273 when administered as a second booster dose in adults who previously received 2 doses of 100 µg 
mRNA-1273 as a primary series and a single booster dose of 50 µg mRNA-1273. P205 Part F (cohort 2) 
serves as the within-study, non-contemporaneous comparator group for the P205 Part G in the 
comparison between the two booster vaccines, mRNA-1273.214 and mRNA-1273, when administered as 
second booster doses. The mRNA-1273.214 bivalent vaccine safety and immunogenicity data are 
summarised as the primary data in this submission.  
Study P205 Part A evaluated the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of the mRNA-1273.211 50 µg 
when administered as a first booster dose in adults who previously received 2 doses of mRNA-1273 as a 
primary series. 
Note: In his submission, the MAH expressed the strength of the bivalent formulation as 0.1 mg/mL. This 
was not considered acceptable by the CHMP. The MAH was requested to express the strength to reflect 
each of the active substances. Therefore, the approved strength of the product is: (50 micrograms/50 
micrograms)/mL. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
With this group of variations, the MAH proposes the authorisation of a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine, 
consisting of mRNA encoding the parental Wuhan strain and mRNA encoding the Omicron BA.1 variant in 
two presentations: 5 dose and 10 dose multidose vials. Additionally, changes were submitted to reflect 
adaptations in the manufacturing process, change in storage conditions, to change the identity test, to 
include a new manufacturing kit line (Kit 8) at Moderna TX, two alternative manufacturing sites for the 
bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 finished product (Patheon Italia S.p.A. and Recipharm Monts) and the 
introduction of a new purity test. The purity assay is changed from an RP-HPLC to an RP-IP-HPLC 
method. 
Assessment report  
EMA/896245/2022 
Page 8/191 
 
 
 
 
To note, in his original submission the MAH expressed the strength of the bivalent product presentations 
applied for in this variation as 0.1 mg/mL. This figure reflects the sum of the quantity of the two active 
substances it contains (elasomeran and imelasomeran). This was not considered acceptable by the CHMP, 
and the MAH was requested to change it to (50 micrograms/50 micrograms)/mL to reflect both active 
substances. As a result, throughout this report the strength of the product is referred to as 0.1 mg/mL 
and (50 micrograms/50 micrograms)/mL. However, the approved strength for the two multidose vial 
presentations for the bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 variant authorised within this procedure 
(EU/1/20/1507/004and EU/1/20/1507/005) is: (50 micrograms/50 micrograms)/mL. 
The main scope of this variation is B.I.a.6.a (Type II): Addition of a new strain (Omicron BA.1) resulting 
in two new Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 (25 μg elasomeran / 25 μg imelasomeran per dose) 
(50 micrograms/50 micrograms)/mL dispersion for injection presentations. The text below corresponds to 
the assessment of this scope. 
The format of the assessment of the additional scopes submitted simultaneously within this variation 
application follows the standard variation/ RSI/ assessment format. The final overall conclusion of the 
main change (addition of new strain) and additional scopes is presented at the end of the report. 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as a dispersion for injection containing 50 micrograms/mL of 
elasomeran and 50 micrograms/mL of imelasomeran as active substance, embedded in lipid 
nanoparticles.  
Elasomeran is a single-stranded, 5’-capped messenger RNA (mRNA) produced using a cell-free in vitro 
transcription from the corresponding DNA templates, encoding the viral spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 
(Original).  
Imelasomeran is a single-stranded, 5’-capped messenger RNA (mRNA) produced using a cell-free in vitro 
transcription from the corresponding DNA templates, encoding the viral spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 
(Omicron BA.1). 
Other ingredients are: SM-102 (heptadecan-9-yl 8-{(2-hydroxyethyl)[6-oxo-6-
(undecyloxy)hexyl]amino}octanoate), cholesterol, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC, 
1,2-Dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000 (PEG2000- DMG), trometamol, 
trometamol hydrochloride, acetic acid, sodium acetate trihydrate, sucrose and water for injections 
The product is available in two presentations with fill volumes of 3.2 mL or 6.3 mL in type 1 glass or 
type 1 equivalent glass or cyclic olefin polymer with inner barrier coating multidose vials with a stopper 
(chlorobutyl rubber) and a blue flip-off plastic cap with seal (aluminium seal), containing 5 or 10 doses, 
respectively. Pack size: 10 vials. 
2.2.2.  Active substance: elasomeran 
The active substance elasomeran (also known as CX-024414) is already approved in the existing 
Spikevax conditional marketing authorisation. Several changes to the information related to elasomeran 
were included within this variation application, e.g. change in purity method (from RP-HPLC to RP-IP-
HPLC), extension of the storage period, change of the storage conditions, tightening of the bioburden in-
process limits. These changes are described below under the section ‘additional scopes’.

2.2.3.  Active substance: imelasomeran 
General information  
To introduce the bivalent vaccine the MAH submitted data to support implementation of the Omicron 
variant mRNA (CX-031302) manufacture. 
The generic name of CX-031302 is imelasomeran and it encodes for the pre-fusion stabilised Spike 
protein of 2019-novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) B.1.1.529 Omicron Variant. 
B.1.1.529 has multiple mutations in the S-protein including several that increase the likelihood of 
transmissibility and cause a reduction in susceptibility to neutralisation. The mutations in the S-2P protein 
of the B.1.1.529 variant encoded by CX-031302 include the following: A67V, Δ69-70, T95I, G142D/Δ143-
145, Δ211/L212I, ins214EPE, G339D, 
S371L, S373P, S375F, K417N, N440K, G446S, S477N, T478K, E484A, Q493R, G496S, Q498R, N501Y, 
Y505H, T547K, D614G, H655Y, N679K, P681H, N764K, D796Y, N856K, Q954H, N969K, and L981F. The 
MAH has designed mRNA-1273.529 containing CX-031302 which encodes for the S-2P of B.1.1.529. 
CX-031302 mRNA is chemically identical to naturally-occurring mammalian mRNA with the exception of 
the uridine nucleoside normally present in mammalian mRNA. This is fully replaced with N1-
methylpseudouridine, a naturally-occurring pyrimidine base present in mammalian tRNAs. This nucleoside 
is included in the CX-031302 mRNA in place of the normal uridine base to minimise the indiscriminate 
recognition of CX-031302 mRNA by pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) receptors (e.g., Toll-
like receptors). The molecular sequence of CX- 031302, including the 5′ cap, the 5′ untranslated region 
(UTR), the Open Reading Frame (ORF), the 3′ UTR, and the 3′ polyA tail, is provided. 
The amino acid sequence alignment between the Prototype (the construct for the currently approved 
product) and B.1.1.529 S-2P is also presented; with the differences highlighted. 
The corresponding mRNA sequence alignment between CX-024414 (Prototype) and CX-031302 
(B.1.1.529) is also presented; with the differences highlighted. 
The information provided is considered adequate. 
Manufacture  
Manufacturers 
No new active substance manufacturing sites have been introduced with this submission. However, unlike 
CX-024414 (the active substance for the currently approved product), CX-031302 will not be 
manufactured at Lonza Biologics, Inc., US. 
The GMP compliance of these sites has been previously confirmed.  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls  
The manufacturing process and process controls are the same as currently approved for the manufacture 
of elasomeran, including the additional changes included within this variation application described below 
under the section ‘additional scopes’ which apply to both active substances.

Control of materials  
Raw materials: 
No changes compared to the CX-024414 raw material. 
Starting material: 
The starting materials in the manufacture of CX-031302 mRNA are the linearised plasmid template and 
the nucleotides ATP, CTP, GTP, N1-Me-ΨTP. The nucleotides are the same nucleotides as used for 
manufacture of CX-024414 mRNA. 
Linearised Plasmid Template: 
A unique linearised DNA plasmid template specific for CX-031302 mRNA was manufactured at 
ModernaTX, Inc. (Norwood, MA, USA). The features of the plasmid template specific for CX-031302 mRNA 
are consistent with CX-024414 mRNA, with the exception of the specific sequence of the coding region. 
The full plasmid DNA sequence and the plasmid map are provided. The host cell line used for manufacture 
of PL-028274 for CX-031302 mRNA is the same as described for CX-024414 mRNA. 
The cell banking system is two-tiered, including a master cell bank (MCB) and a working cell bank (WCB). 
The manufacturers involved in cell bank production are listed. Manufacture and testing of MCB and WCB 
was conducted as for the original CX-024414 containing plasmid. 
Release results for MCB and WCB are provided including for culture purity, lytic and lysogenic 
bacteriophages, viability, marker retention, strain identity (for MCB only), plasmid identify, plasmid 
integrity and plasmid copy number. The analytical procedures used to perform release are also described. 
Qualification of MCB and WCB have also been described. 
The MCB and WCB stability protocol and all available data are provided. The test methods and acceptance 
criteria are the same as for release testing. All available data show compliance to specification.  
The CX-031302 mRNA plasmid, PL-028274, is manufactured for CX-031302 mRNA using the same 
procedure as described for CX-024414 mRNA. The same approach to characterisation testing and 
kanamycin risk assessment described for CX- 024414 mRNA was taken for CX-031302 mRNA.  
The specification for the linearised plasmid includes: appearance, concentration, plasmid identity, %linear 
plasmid, residual genomic DBA, residual RBNA, residual protein, bacterial endotoxin and bioburden. 
The final filtered bulk long-term storage condition for the linearised plasmid is -20°C ± 5°C, with a formal 
shelf-life of three years. 
A shelf life of 3 years under long-term storage condition of -20°C ± 5°C is requested for the linearised 
plasmid based on the prototype vaccine and supported by limited data collected in an on-going stability 
study that have been initiated linearised plasmid. Considering that no changes are included in the 
manufacturing process of the DNA template as compared to the original variant, the shelf-life is 
considered sufficiently supported by the original data.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates  
The control of critical steps and intermediates are the same as currently approved for the manufacture of 
elasomeran. 
Process validation and/or evaluation  
For manufacture of this and all future variants which use a manufacturing process and control strategy 
equivalent (except for specific variant sequence) to the prototype mRNA-1273, the MAH proposes to 
produce one confirmatory process verification lot to demonstrate process consistency per site per the 
requirements specified in the Process Validation Master Plan. The introduction of CX-031302 mRNA also 
included the qualification of an additional identical Train 8 (see relevant scope under the section 
Assessment report  
EMA/896245/2022 
Page 11/191 
 
 
 
 
 
‘additional scopes’) and enabling Train 8 for prototype mRNA-1273 and all variants using a mRNA-1273 
equivalent process and control strategy at Moderna Norwood. The MAH has successfully completed 
process verification of the CX-031302 mRNA manufacturing process as a means of demonstrating that 
the commercial-scale manufacturing process is capable of consistently delivering quality product. 
The process performance qualification (PPQ) verification has generated data at commercial scale to 
support and complement laboratory-scale studies. This can be accepted since the manufacturing process 
is identical to that used for the original variant with some changes described and justified under the 
section ‘additional scopes’. 
Manufacturing process development  
The development of additional mRNA-1273 vaccines was initiated by the MAH in response to the 
emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Sequences for mRNA-1273 vaccines are designed based 
upon the prefusion-stabilised two-proline (S-2P) encoding sequence for CX-024414 mRNA. Changes 
relative to this sequence are made only to incorporate the specific mutations of the variant S protein 
sequence encoded by the sequence of the specific mRNA-1273 RNA. The manufacturing process and 
analytical control strategies established for the CX-024414 mRNA are applied directly to all mRNA-1273 
RNAs.  
Subsequent process characterisation beyond that described for CX-024414 was performed for mRNA-
1273 RNAs, using the same scale down models used in CX-024414 mRNA process characterisation, with 
the intent of verifying the applicability of the process description and process control strategy defined in 
Section 3.2.S.2.2 {mRNA-1273 RNA} and Section 3.2.S.2.4 {mRNA-1273 RNA}, respectively, to all 
mRNA-1273 RNAs. 
The critical process parameters (CPPs) and critical in process controls (CIPCs) for the mRNA-1273 RNA 
manufacturing process are provided. CPPs and the CIPC are consistent for all mRNA-1273 RNAs, including 
CX-024414 mRNA. 
A comparability study between CX-024414 to CX-031302 was conducted.  
The following three elements were included in the comparability study: 
• Evaluation of process performance with respect to critical process parameters (CPPs) and 
in-process controls (IPCs). 
• Statistical evaluation of comparability of release testing results. 
• Statistical evaluation of selected extended characterisation results.  
The mRNA sequence was the only change represented in this comparability exercise. All CIPC and IPC 
results met the acceptable ranges. Release results met both specification and comparability acceptance 
criteria and extended characterisation results met the comparability expected ranges established from 
development, clinical, Scale A, preliminary Scale B, and Scale B CX-024414 data. Therefore, the results 
from the commercial Scale B (75 L in vitro transcription -IVT- scale) PPQ lot of CX-031302 manufactured 
at Lonza (Visp, Switzerland) demonstrated that the manufacturing processes and quality attributes were 
comparable.  
Characterisation  
The structure and physicochemical properties of CX-031302 mRNA were studied using a variety of 
techniques applicable to mRNAs, including: determination of UV extinction coefficient, circular dichroism 
Assessment report  
EMA/896245/2022 
Page 12/191 
 
 
 
 
spectrum, reverse transcription followed by Sanger di-deoxynucleotide sequencing, oligonucleotide 
mapping, N1-methyl-pseudouridine (N1-MeΨU) ID and content, cap identity, Poly A tail length and 
dispersity, sequence homogeneity of the CX-031302 mRNA coding region, melting profile by Differential 
Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). 
Process impurities were evaluated. These included double stranded RNA (dsRNA) and residual protein. 
There are no new impurities as compared to parental mRNA. 
The characterisation of the new mRNA CX-031302 is considered acceptable 
Specification 
The specification for imelasomeran is presented and contains tests for appearance, identity (reverse 
transcription/Sanger sequencing), total RNA content (UV), purity (RP- IP-HPLC), product related 
impurities (RP-IP-HPLC), % 5’- Capped (RP-HPLC), % Poly(A) tailed RNA (RP-HPLC), pH (Ph. Eur.), 
bacterial endotoxin (Ph. Eur.) and bioburden (Ph. Eur.). 
The proposed specification for imelasomeran is identical to the specification for elasomeran and is 
considered adequate. The analytical methods used for release testing of CX-031302 and prototype CX-
024414 are identical with the exception of the identity method, since this is the only method that is 
sequence-specific. Confirmation of mRNA Sequence by RT-PCR and Sanger Sequencing has been 
validated and shown to be suitable for the purpose of determining the mRNA identity of CX-031302. The 
validation characteristics evaluated were specificity and intermediate precision. 
To note, a new analytical procedure for determination of purity (RP-IP-HPLC) was introduced within this 
variation application (see section ‘additional scopes’). During the evaluation the CHMP raised a Major 
Objection due to a shift in purity values obtained with the new method and the MAH proposal to keep the 
existing acceptance criteria. To address this concern, the MAH adapted the finished product release and 
end of shelf life specification to account for this shift. Nonetheless, the MAH is recommended to reassess 
the need to adjust the purity specification limits at the level of the active substance (REC10). 
Batch results are presented for two PPQ commercial scale batches from each manufacturer. All batches 
met the specification acceptance criteria in place at the time of release and confirm consistency of the 
manufacturing process. 
Reference standards of materials 
The reference material as described for elasomeran serves as the reference material for imelasomeran. 
During the review a question was raised to ask the MAH to clarify this. The MAH indicated that the RNA 
reference material is used as a system suitability standard for several release tests and is also used as a 
reference standard for measurement of total RNA content. As a system suitability standard, this material 
is used to assess the system suitability of the analytical testing, for example the consistency of retention 
time or peak area response in an HPLC-UV method.  
Since the mRNA-1273 RNAs all have similar lengths, they have very similar molar extinction coefficients. 
For example, the calculated sequence-corrected coefficient for CX-031302 mRNA (33.99 μg/mL) and 
CX-024414 mRNA (34.01 μg/mL) are within 0.06% of each other. Thus, the use of a single RNA 
standard is suitable for total RNA content measurement across different variant mRNA-1273 materials. 
The justification presented is acceptable.

Container closure system  
The container closure system is the same as for the currently approved active substance, elasomeran. 
Stability  
An initial shelf-life of 36 months is proposed for CX-031302 mRNA material stored in the commercial 
container closure system (gamma irradiated, single-use storage bags), when stored at the 
recommended long-term storage condition of -60°C to -90°C. 
The CX-031302 registration stability program was executed according to ICH Q1A (R2), Stability Testing 
of new Drug Substances and Products, and ICH Q5C, Stability Testing of Biotechnological/Biological 
Products.  
The CX-031302 mRNA is stored at -60 to -90°C, after an optional interim storage at -15 to 25°C of 
maximum 3 months.  
The properties of CX-031302 mRNA with respect to the attributes that affect product potency have been 
systematically and thoroughly assessed. These attributes include fidelity of the RNA sequence including 
cap, tail, and open reading frame and integrity of the RNA. Direct measurements of those attributes 
have been established and are included in the routine release panel for CX-031302 mRNA. The stability 
of CX-031302 mRNA will be evaluated against a broad set of stability data and modelling data 
encompassing both CX-024414 mRNA registration lots and additional variant RNAs associated with the 
mRNA-1273 program. 
As discussed at the time of the CMA, the product quality attribute expected to change most during the 
manufacture and distribution of the product is mRNA purity, which represents the fraction of intact 
mRNA. The degradation of RNA in the product has been extensively studied by applying a sensitive 
chromatographic assay to assess the formation of RNA degradants. The principal route of degradation 
for RNA is hydrolytic chain scission to species that elute prior to the main peak (RNA fragments). mRNA 
purity correlates with protein levels measured in the in vitro relative protein expression assay. Direct 
measurement of RNA degradation utilising the RNA purity assay by RP-HPLC is precise, accurate and the 
most stability-indicating measure of product activity. The MAH indicated that the stability profiles for all 
the stability-indicating attributes are being evaluated and monitored but purity is the primary 
determinant of shelf-life, since it is the most stability-indicating attribute. 
The shelf-life has been justified from a purity statistical model. The lots used in the purity modelling 
analysis were manufactured using a development process, small-scale Personalised Vaccine Unit (PVU) 
scale process, the initial Scale B process, and the Scale B process. Modelling included data from 
development lots from additional variant RNAs to incorporate sequence differences into the statistical 
model.  
Stability and characterisation studies were designed to evaluate product stability under various stressed 
and long-term storage conditions. All lots were manufactured using the commercial manufacturing 
process. Stability samples were stored at -60°C to -90°C (data up to 24 months available), -20 ± 5°C 
(data up to 24 months available) -and 5 ± 3°C (data up to 3 months available) in containers made of 
the same materials as the commercial closure system. In the initial submission the MAH provided limited 
stability data and did not justify the mRNA characteristics to justify the comparability between the 
different mRNAs and this raised a major objection. In response the MAH provided 24 month stability 
data at -60°C to -90°C and described the characteristics of the CX-027367 mRNA that is used in the 
supportive stability study at-60°C to -90°C. This is acceptable. 
Size-based RNA purity and polyA tailed RNA, as determined by reverse-phase high-performance liquid 
Assessment report  
EMA/896245/2022

chromatography (RP-HPLC), were demonstrated to be stability indicating. 
A stability study was also initiated for CX-031302 mRNA manufactured at ModernaTX, Inc. (Norwood, 
MA) (refer to the section ‘additional scopes’). Additional confirmatory stability studies for the proposed 
long term storage condition for CX-031302 mRNA have been included. These studies are currently 
ongoing. 
The claimed shelf-life is considered sufficiently justified based on data from the original variant and 
modelling results. The modelling confirmed similar degradation rates for CX-024414 mRNA and variant 
RNA supporting the same shelf life for CX-024414 and CX-031302 mRNA. These results therefore 
support the proposed shelf-life of 36 months for CX-031302 mRNA when stored at -60°C to -90°C. 
The MAH is recommended to submit the confirmatory stability data when available (REC3). 
2.2.4.  Finished product  
Description and composition of the drug product  
The bivalent vaccine finished product Original/ Omicron BA.1 is a white to off-white sterile dispersion 
for injection in a preservative-free buffer containing 20 mM Trometamol (Tris), 2.1 mM acetate, 87 g/L 
sucrose at pH 7.5 for intramuscular administration.  
The mRNA-1273.214 bivalent vaccine combines two mRNA sequences (equal mass) encoding for the 
pre-fusion stabilised Spike glycoprotein of: 
• the prototype Wuhan-Hu-1 2019-novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) (as mRNA CX-024414), and 
• the B.1.1.529 (Omicron) Variant-of-Concern (as mRNA CX-031302) 
The finished product (also referred to as mRNA-1273.214) is an mRNA- lipid nanoparticle (LNP) 
dispersion that contains the two mRNAs (CX-024414 and CX-031302) that encode for the pre-fusion 
stabilised Spike glycoproteins described above, and four lipids which act as protectants and carriers of 
the mRNA: SM-102 (a custom-manufactured, ionisable lipid), cholesterol, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-
phosphocholine (DSPC) and 1, 2-dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000 
(PEG2000-DMG). 
The qualitative and quantitative composition of the product, including amounts per vial, function and 
quality standard applicable to each component, was provided. Each 0.50 mL dose of the vaccine contains 
25 micrograms of each active substance. 
All excipients except the lipid excipients SM-102, DSPC and PEG2000-DMG and trometamol-HCl comply to 
Ph. Eur. grade. The excipients are the same as used in the currently approved formulations of Spikevax 
(EU/1/20/1507/001-003). 
The container closure system is a type 1 glass or type 1 equivalent glass or cyclic olefin polymer (with 
inner barrier coating) multidose vial with a stopper (chlorobutyl rubber) and a blue flip-off plastic cap with 
seal (aluminium seal). It is the same container closure system as for the prototype vaccine (0.2 mg/mL: 
EU/1/20/1507/001). 
Pharmaceutical development  
This type II-variation introduces a bivalent finished product of Spikevax that is a preservative-free, sterile 
dispersion of RNA-containing lipid nanoparticles in an aqueous cryoprotectant buffer for intramuscular

administration. The bivalent finished product contains a 1:1 ratio of the original and Omicron BA.1 variant 
strains at a concentration of (50 micrograms/50 micrograms)/mL. 
Briefly, the bivalent Original/ Omicron BA/.1 finished product is manufactured by pooling mRNA-1273 
LNP-B (containing mRNA CX-024414) and mRNA-1273.529 LNP-B (containing mRNA CX-031302), 
followed by a dilution with a dilution buffer containing 20 mM Tris and 87 mg/mL sucrose, pH 7.5.  
The mRNA-1273.214 FP shares the same compositional platform as the authorised 0.1 mg/mL 
formulation ((EU/1/20/1507/002-003). Therefore, all aspects of Spikevax 0.1 mg/mL development can be 
extrapolated to the bivalent mRNA-1273.214 DP. 
The Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) of Spikevax, which is generally applicable to all strengths of the 
finished product is presented.  
No changes have been made compared to the QTPP for the original vaccine.  
According to the MAH, no change in physicochemical properties, processability and stability is expected 
for the bivalent vaccine compared to the 0.1 mg/mL formulation. This is agreed to. 
In accordance with ICH Q9, a systematic assessment of the potential risk to mRNA-1273.214 finished 
product quality was performed with respect to the manufacturing process.  
CX-024414 mRNA loaded LNP intermediate (referred to by the MAH as mRNA-1273 LNP-B) 
This is the same intermediate used to prepare the 0.1 mg/mL formulation ((EU/1/20/1507/002-003).  
CX-031302 mRNA loaded LNP intermediate (referred to by the MAH as mRNA-1273.529 LNP-B) 
The only difference between mRNA-1273.529 LNP-B and mRNA-1273 LNP-B is the mRNA sequence. 
mRNA-1273.529 LNP-B is produced in a 200 g nominal batch size, according to the same manufacturing 
process described for mRNA-1273 LNP-B. 
Process characterisation beyond those conducted for previous formulations, was performed for multiple 
mRNA-1273 LNPs, including mRNA-1273.529 LNP-B. 
The CPPs for the mRNA-1273.529 LNP-B manufacturing process are provided in Table 10. No CIPCs were 
identified for the mRNA-1273.529 LNP-B manufacturing process. 
Across process characterisation studies including multiple mRNA-1273 LNPs, relationships between the 
studied process parameters and the evaluated CQAs were consistent, and any risk to product quality 
resulting from change in sequence is not expected based on the observed results. The control strategy 
verification approach confirmed the applicability of a consistent set of critical process parameter 
designations and corresponding proven acceptable ranges (PARs) from the prototype mRNA-1273 LNP to 
mRNA-1273.529 LNP-B. 
A conducted failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) concluded that due to the commonality, the 
mRNA-1273 LNP manufacturing process and process control strategy is applicable to mRNA-1273.529 
LNP. Specifically, this includes the classification of process parameter criticality and the CQAs determined 
to be impacted by variations in critical process parameters. Leveraging prior process characterisation 
knowledge established for the prototype mRNA-1273, a streamlined approach focused on process control 
strategy verification for process steps where critical process parameters were identified for the prototype 
mRNA-1273 LNP. 
Process characterisation and control strategy verification studies for mRNA-1273.529 LNP-B (Omicron) 
employed the same scale down model developed and assessed for suitability as part of the prototype 
mRNA-1273 LNP process characterisation.

A development history, lot genealogy and usage of mRNA-1273.529 LNP-B finished product intermediate 
has been provided. 
Comparability of mRNA-1273.529 LNP-B versus mRNA-1273 LNP-B 
The following three elements were included in the comparability study: 
1. Evaluation of process performance with respect to critical process parameters (CPPs) and 
in-process controls (IPCs). 
2. Statistical evaluation of comparability of release testing results. 
3. Statistical evaluation of extended analytical characterisation testing results. 
All IPC results met the acceptable ranges. Release results met both specification and comparability 
acceptance criteria and extended characterisation results met the comparability expected ranges 
established, demonstrating comparability for all manufacturing sites (Moderna TX, Lonza Visp and Rovi 
Granada).  
Finished product (referred to by the MAH as mRNA-1273.214) 
The mRNA-1273.214 Drug Product is manufactured by combining two mRNA-LNP finished product 
intermediates (mRNA-1273 LNP-B and mRNA-1273.529 LNP-B and further dilution.  
Based on the demonstrated control of RNA content in the mRNA-LNP established through the extensive 
manufacturing history of the mRNA-1273 prototype vaccine, a process control strategy employing direct 
gravimetric combination of the mRNA-1273 LNP-B and mRNA.1273.529 LNP-B followed by dilution based 
on the nominal mRNA-LNP RNA concentration of 0.82 mg/mL has been defined. This was supported by a 
Monte Carlo statistical model and the RNA content data from release of 682 mRNA-1273 LNP commercial 
batch certificates of analysis across three manufacturing sites (Moderna MTC-S, Lonza Portsmouth, and 
Lonza Visp). 
Pooling and dilution operations have been adequately characterised and validated, demonstrating the 
ability to apply the existing validated manufacturing process parameters from the original vaccine to the 
bivalent drug product giving a homogeneous drug product with the desired quality attributes 
Characterisation of the clarification / bioburden reduction filtration and sterile filtration operations and the 
conditioning freeze step are the same as for the mRNA-1273 prototype vaccine. 
A science-based approach was used to identify CQAs, CPPs and CIPC to inform process design studies, 
and to establish the manufacturing control strategy for the finished product. The proposed CQAs for the 
finished product are listed in the specifications section.  
A FMEA was performed to identify potential failure modes for the manufacturing process and to evaluate 
the impact these failures might have on product quality and/or process performance. 
Proven acceptable Ranges (PARs) for CPPs were characterised using a science- and risk-based approach 
that leveraged current process understanding and historical knowledge from platform unit operations for 
similar products. 
The studies were designed to mitigate potential risks for CPPs identified during the FMEA and establish 
PARs for the associated process parameters to maintain CQAs. 
A development history, lot genealogy and usage of the bivalent vaccine has been provided. 
The changes in the manufacturing process implemented to support the bivalent finished product 
manufacturing have been discussed. They include changes in mRNA sequence, pooling of LNPs and 
filtration (combination of batch filtration processed to reduce risk of filter fouling).

Comparability of mRNA-1273.214 versus mRNA-1273 FP (prototype vaccine). 
The pooling of mRNA-1273 LNP-B (containing mRNA CX-024414) and mRNA-1273.529 LNP-B (containing 
mRNA CX-031302) and blending step to produce a bivalent finished product and implementation of 3X 
filtration are represented in this comparability exercise. 
The following two elements were included in the comparability study: 
o  Evaluation of process performance with respect to CPPs and IPCs 
o  Statistical evaluation of comparability of release testing results. 
Extended analytical characterisation and forced degradation testing were not performed for mRNA-
1273.214 DP as part of comparability studies since the mRNA-1273 finished product characteristics are 
the same as the mRNA-1273 LNP finished product intermediates. Therefore, the extended 
characterisation results for mRNA-1273 LNPs finished product intermediate are considered representative 
of mRNA-1273 finished product. This approach was used in the development of the authorised 
formulations and is considered acceptable. The complete comparability methodology and statistical 
analysis have been described. All CIPC and IPC results met the acceptable ranges and release results met 
both specification and comparability acceptance criteria established from development, clinical, Scale A, 
and Scale B mRNA-1273 FP data for all the manufacturing sites (vial line 3 at Catalent, Rota line at 
Recipharm, Dara and Marchesini Lines at Rovi SSRR and the Xtrema Line at Patheon Monza). 
The LNP, finished product formulations and processes have remained the same throughout development 
of the original vaccine except for necessary changes to the scale as development progressed from initial 
clinical supplies to commercial manufacture and, changes related to the mRNA-loaded LNP intermediate 
mRNA-1273 LNP-B made for the 0.1 mg/mL formulation. 
Comparability has previously been acceptably demonstrated between clinical and commercial scale 
original finished product, between various manufacturing sites via comprehensive studies including both 
release testing and extended characterisation testing. Due to the application of the same formulation, 
manufacturing process and the use of the same manufacturing sites as the original finished product, 
extensive prior experience is leveraged. It is found acceptable and sufficient that comparability has been 
established between the bivalent vaccine finished product to the original finished product based on an 
evaluation of release testing results against the acceptance criteria in the finished product specification. 
For the bivalent vaccine, batch analysis data are provided in section 3.2.P.5.4 for 3 PPQ batches from 
each finished product manufacturing site (Catalent, Indiana; Patheon, Monza; Rovi, San Sebastian de los 
Reyes; and Recipharm, Monts). All these batches met the specification acceptance criteria in place at the 
time of testing. This is found acceptable. 
The control strategy for bivalent finished product is based upon the control strategy for the prototype 
vaccine. 
All quality attributes and controls described for the original vaccine are still applicable to the bivalent 
finished product. In addition, the weight ratio of pooled LNP is introduced as CIPC specific to the bivalent 
finished product to ensure that an appropriate amount of LNP of each type (containing CX-024414 or CX-
03130 has been pooled).  
No new information has been provided on microbiological attributes and compatibility studies claiming 
that the data provided for the prototype vaccine applies to the bivalent product. This is acceptable. 
In conclusion, the information provided on the pharmaceutical development of the bivalent vaccine is 
found sufficient and acceptable.

Manufacture  
The manufacturing process consists of preparation of mRNA loaded-LNP finished product intermediates, 
dilution buffer preparation, LNP thawing, LNP pooling, dilution, clarification/bioburden reduction filtration, 
sterile filtration, aseptic filling, stoppering and capping.  
mRNA loaded LNP intermediate containing mRNA CX-024414 (referred to by the MAH as mRNA-1273 
LNP-B) 
The manufacturing process is identical to the one used for the 0.1 mg/mL strength. 
mRNA loaded LNP intermediate containing mRNA CX-031302 (referred to by the MAH as mRNA-1273.529 
LNP-B) 
mRNA-1273.529 LNP-B are produced in a 200 g nominal batch size, according to the same manufacturing 
process and in-process controls described for mRNA-1273 LNP-B. The only difference between these 
finished product intermediates is the mRNA sequence loaded. 
Since the same mRNA manufacturing process and equivalent control strategy is used (mRNA sequence 
specific control elements); one single Process Verification / Comparability batch was performed to 
introduce the mRNA-1273 LNP manufacturing at each site. All PPQ verification lot release testing results 
encompassing all CQAs, met the predefined acceptance criteria demonstrating consistent, robust and 
well-controlled process performance and product quality. 
Qualification of all process hold times was performed independently from PPQ verification. 
Finished product 
The finished product is manufactured at the manufacturing sites, and using the same platform 
manufacturing process, as currently approved for Spikevax 0.2 mg/mL and 0.1 mg/mL in vials, namely 
Catalent, Rovi, and Recipharm, with the addition of Patheon, Monza which is a new manufacturing site 
being introduced within this variation application (see section on additional scopes). The GMP compliance 
of these sites has been confirmed. 
As described above, there are no changes in the manufacturing process with respect to the existing 0.1 
mg/mL formulation except for the pooling of the two mRNA-loaded LNP finished product intermediates 
containing either CX-024414 or CX-031302), with the addition of an IPC to achieve equal mass of the two 
RNA sequences by controlling the weights of mRNA-1273 LNP-B and mRNA- 1273.529 LNP-B pooled and 
adjustment of the dilution step to the target concentration of 0.1 mg/mL (sum of both mRNAs). The 
diluted bulk product solution is mixed to obtain a homogeneous solution. The updated process parameters 
and controls for the dilution step for bivalent mRNA-1273.214 finished product have been described. 
The manufacturing process is described for all four sites separately.  
As for the existing 0.1 mg/mL formulation, two alternative manufacturing process flows have been 
designed for mRNA-1273.214 DP.  
Similar controls during manufacture and similar hold times are applied for both original and bivalent 
finished product. The manufacturing process is considered sufficiently described including acceptable in-
process controls (IPCs) and hold times. 
The batch formula for the manufacture of mRNA-1273.214 DP at Rovi, Catalent, Patheon (Monza) and 
Recipharm is provided. 
Process validation has been performed for the four finished product manufacturing sites.

Upon request from the CHMP, the final Time out of Refrigeration (TOR) and Cumulative Process Duration 
(CPD) supported by the PPQ exercise for each site up to the manufacture of the commercial labelled 
finished product were provided, except for Catalent and Recipharm which will be provided by September 
2022 and October 2022, respectively (REC5). 
The homogeneity of the diluted mRNA-1273.214 FP was evaluated with respect to osmolality, pH, and 
RNA concentration to qualify a mixing duration of 20 to 30 minutes. All of the data were within 
acceptance criteria and mRNA content shows no significant variation from top, middle, and bottom 
samples, confirming the suitability of the established process parameters.  
The homogeneity of filled vials was evaluated by testing one vial from the beginning, middle, and end of 
the filling and visual inspection processes for RNA content, RNA ratio, mRNA purity, particle size and 
polydispersity, and RNA encapsulation. The results demonstrate consistent process performance.

Product specification 
mRNA-1273 LNP-B 
The following attributes have been included in the specification for mRNA-1273 LNP-B: appearance, 
mRNA identity by reverse transcription/Sanger sequencing, total RNA content by anion exchange 
chromatography, purity and product-related impurities by RP-HPLC, % RNA encapsulation by absorbance 
assay, mean particle size and polydispersity by DLS, lipid identity by UPLC-CAD (SM-102, cholesterol, 
DSPC, PEG2000-DMG), lipid content by UPLC-CAD (SM-102, cholesterol, DSPC, PEG2000- DMG), lipid 
impurities by UPLC-CAD (% individual impurities and sum of impurities), pH, osmolality, bacterial 
endotoxins (Ph. Eur. 2.6.14, kinetic chromogenic method) and bioburden (Ph. Eur. 2.6.12). 
This section is similar to the registered information for the 0.1 mg/mL formulation, but has been updated 
with the following information (see additional scopes): 
• Replacement of the RP-HPLC method for purity and related impurities with a new RP-IP-HPLC  
• The new specification for Product-related Impurities 
• To provide the new name for the Absorbance-based Assay used to assess the % RNA Encapsulation 
mRNA-1273.529 LNP-B 
The specifications proposed for the newly introduced mRNA-1273.529 LNP are identical to the 
specifications applied to the prototype mRNA-1273 LNP-B, and only the analytical method used for 
identity testing is newly developed to unequivocally identify the mRNA-1273.529 LNP-B variant sequence. 
A validation summary of the method has been presented. 
As described above, a new RP-IP-HPLC test method is also being introduced for control of both mRNA-
1273 LNP-B and mRNA-1273.529 LNP-B. The specifications were updated as a consequence to this 
change (see additional scopes). 
Batch analysis data from all the manufacturing sites have been provided. 
Finished product 
The proposed finished product release specification for the bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 vaccine is 
provided. It includes tests for appearance (visual), total RNA content by anion exchange chromatography, 
mRNA identity and mRNA ratio by RP-HPLC, purity and product-related impurities by RP-IP-HPLC, % RNA 
encapsulation by by absorbance assay, in vitro translation (methionine labelling), lipid identification by 
HPLC-CAD (SM-102, cholesterol, DSPC, PEG2000-DMG), lipid content by HPLC-CAD (SM-102, cholesterol, 
DSPC, PEG2000-DMG), lipid impurities by HPLC-CAD (% individual impurities and sum of impurities), 
particle size and polydispersity by DLS, pH , osmolality , particulate matter , container content (USP), 
bacterial endotoxin (Ph. Eur. 2.6.14, kinetic chromogenic method), sterility (Ph. Eur. 2.6.1) and container 
closure integrity (stability only).

The specification for the bivalent vaccine is based on the specification for the prototype formulation.  
A test for identity and RNA ratio have been added to ensure that the intended content of each individual 
mRNA is present in the finished product. Since the total RNA content method measures total RNA and 
cannot distinguish RNA from different mRNA sequences, a measurement of the ratio of the two RNA 
components present in the finished is needed to ensure that each component is present at the intended 
level. Together, control of total RNA content and RNA ratio ensure that each finished product batch 
contains the intended dose of the individual RNA components. During the review the MAH was asked to 
clarify whether the RNA ratio method is specific to intact RNA or whether RNA fragments or adducts will 
also contribute to the result. The MAH clarified that RNA ratio determination is based on total RNA but 
argues that because of the high consistency of the purity of batches produced, only slight differences 
will occur. The explanation is only partially supported as average purity results do not rule out single 
batch combination with higher purity differences however, the issue will not be further pursued since the 
level of RNA fragments and RNA lipid adducts are controlled at release for each mRNA-LNP used in the 
manufacture of the mRNA-1273.214 DP. 
mRNA-1273.214 FP is first digested with primer-guided RNase H, which targets a specific sequence within 
the open reading frame (ORF) of the RNAs present in the finished product. This digestion results in short 
RNA oligonucleotides, that are specific to each individual mRNA-1273 RNA component present in the 
finished product (14 nucleotides for CX-031302 mRNA and 21 nucleotides for CX-024414 mRNA 
comprising the mRNA-1273.214 finished product). As such, a bivalent finished product would result in two 
unique oligonucleotides after RNase H digestion. The resulting RNA oligos are separated by ion-pairing 
reversed phase chromatography and detected online by UV. A detailed validation summary has been 
presented. The method was shown to be specific, accurate, precise, and linear for the determination of 
RNA ratio.  
As indicated in the imelasomeran active substance section, a new analytical procedure for determination 
of purity (RP-IP-HPLC) has been introduced within this variation application (see section ‘additional 
scopes’) to replace the existing RP-HPLC method. The validation characteristics evaluated were system 
suitability, specificity, linearity, accuracy; precision, range, robustness, determination of the detection 
and the quantitation limits and stability of standard and sample preparation solutions. Validation results 
are acceptable. A bridging study was performed to demonstrate comparable results with both RNA purity 
methods. Results showed higher purity values with the new method, specially at the level of the finished 
product. This change in method resulted in the revision of the assay specification limits for release and for 
end of shelf life to account for the higher results consistently produced by the new method as requested 
by CHMP (MO). Nonetheless, the MAH is recommended to reassess the need to adjust the purity 
specification limits at the level of elasomeran active substance and finished product intermediates 
(REC10). 
During the review it was noticed that the in vitro translation test is not specific for the two different 
mRNAs. Since this is only a qualitative test that demonstrates the production of a protein of the expected 
size in vitro, it was raised that there is no proof of functionality of both mRNAs if the test is conducted at 
the finished product level. The in vitro translation test should be performed at the level of the mRNA-LNP 
intermediates as well, unless potency of both mRNA-LNPs in the final product can be demonstrated 
otherwise (Major Objection). In response, the MAH indicated that they have utilised in vitro relative 
protein expression (IVRPE) to quantitatively confirm the intended protein expression level of each 
monovalent LNP comprising the mRNA-1273.214 finished product. Two IVRPE assays are implemented as 
characterisation tests with optimised method parameters and product-specific reference standards to 
assess the protein expression of both mRNA-1273-B LNP and mRNA-1273.529 LNP-B, as part of analytical 
comparability. A strong correlation between protein expression as measured by IVRPE as well as in-vivo 
immunogenicity to total RNA content and purity has been shown. On the basis of this strong correlation, 
the protein expression of the monovalent LNP can be assured when RNA content and purity are well

controlled within their respective specification limits. The mRNA-1273.214 finished product manufacturing 
process consists of thaw and pooling of mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.529 LNPs, dilution, and mixing prior 
to sterile filtration and fill steps. Thus, protein expression is expected to remain consistent from 
monovalent LNPs to the bivalent finished product.  
Spikevax is currently controlled using the In-Vitro Translation (IVT) assay as part of the finished product 
specification. The In-Vitro Relative Protein Expression (IVRPE) assay is not part of the routine Quality 
Control testing, but rather a characterisation assay as part of analytical comparability. The MAH has 
committed to work on the required implementation of the IVT assay at the mRNA-LNPs stage and submit 
the proposed change in Control Strategy by End of December 2022 (REC1). This is acceptable given the 
strong correlation between RNA content / purity and in vivo immunogenicity. 
The impurity profile of mRNA-1273.214 finished product is the same as that of the mRNA- 
1273LNP/mRNA-1273.529 LNP-B. With the exception of potential extractables/leachables, no additional 
impurities are anticipated to formed or be introduced during mRNA-1273.214 finished product 
manufacturing. An evaluation of potential extractables and leachables from manufacturing components 
and container closure systems used in the mRNA-1273 FP manufacturing process at all manufacturing 
sites has been presented. Of the compounds characterised, none were identified as cohort of concern, 
cohort of very high concern, or potent mutagens. 
Batch analysis data from 3 GMP batches of the bivalent finished product from each of the proposed 
finished product manufacturing sites (Catalent, Patheon, Rovi and Recipharm) have been presented 
together with their Certificates of Analysis (CoAs) as far as available. All results met the release 
specifications. Results are pending for purity and product-related impurities. The dossier should be 
updated, and the final CoA should be provided when the complete data are available, in early September 
2022 (REC4). This is acceptable since the comparability exercise supports extrapolation of the mRNA-
1273 FP data to mRNA-1273.214 in the meantime. 
Stability of the product 
mRNA-1273 LNP and mRNA-1273.529 LNP-B 
An initial shelf life of 12 months is proposed for mRNA-1273 LNP and mRNA-1273.529 LNP material 
stored in the commercial container closure system, when stored at the recommended long-term storage 
condition of -60°C to -90°C. 
Stability data from 30 mRNA-1273 LNP lots, 7 mRNA-1273 LNP-B lots and three additional stability 
modelling lots are available. Data have been collected for up to 18 months at -60⁰C to -90 ⁰C and 12 
months at 5±3⁰C. 
Three mRNA-1273.529 LNP registration stability batches have been established and stored at -60⁰C to -
90 ⁰C for up to 3 months and 5±3⁰C for up to 2 months. Stability samples were stored in a scaled-down 
container closure system (50-mL Aramus bag). All results from samples stored at -60⁰C to -90 ⁰C met 
the specification limits. 
Samples were tested for appearance, pH, particle size, polydispersity, RNA content, % RNA 
encapsulation, purity (RE-HPLC), product related impurities (RP-HPLC), lipid content and lipid impurities, 
bacterial endotoxin, lipid identification, identity (Sanger sequencing), osmolality and bioburden. 
The scaled down bag is representative of the storage container used for commercial manufacture with the 
same product contact surfaces. Based on the sample volume and size of the scaled-down container, the 
surface area:volume ratio is considered worst case in the stability studies.

Degradation rates for purity of mRNA-1273 LNP and mRNA-1273.529 LNP were estimated for two storage 
temperatures using the stability study results available. 
These results support the proposed shelf life of 12 months for both mRNA-1273 LNP and mRNA-1273.529 
LNP.  
Finished product 
The proposed shelf-life for the bivalent vaccine finished product is the same as for the prototype vaccine:  
9 months at -50ºC to -15ºC. 
After removal from the freezer, the unopened vaccine vial may be stored refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C, 
protected from light, for a maximum of 30 days. Within this period, up to 12 hours may be used for 
transportation at 2°C to 8°C (see SmPC section 6.4). 
Chemical and physical stability has also been demonstrated for unopened vaccine vials when stored for 
12 months at -50°C to -15°C provided that once thawed and stored at 2°C to 8°C, protected from light, 
the unopened vial will be used up within a maximum of 14 days (instead of 30 days, when stored at -
50ºC to -15ºC for 9 months). 
The proposed shelf-life is based on the shelf-life for the prototype vaccine and the stability model 
developed. 
This is agreed since the mRNA-1273 associated variant vaccine sequences include only the changes 
relative to the CX- 024414 mRNA sequence required to incorporate the specific mutations of the variant S 
protein sequence. The RNA length is highly conserved between the prototype mRNA-1273 vaccine and 
mRNA1273 associated variant vaccines. As an example, the RNAs comprising mRNA-1273.214 finished 
product are within 9 nucleotides of each other relative to a total length of approximately 4000 
nucleotides. It is concluded that the extensive data available in the stability program and shelf-life 
assessment for the prototype mRNA-1273 vaccine is directly applicable to mRNA-1273 associated variant 
vaccines. Due to the application of the same formulation, manufacturing process and the use of the same 
manufacturing sites as the prototype vaccine, extensive prior experience is leveraged for the bivalent 
finished product and comparability has been proven. 
Stability from 3 PPQ batches manufactured at Patheon Monza, 1 PPQ batch manufactured at Catalent, 
Bloomington and one clinical batch from Moderna, TX stored for up to 3 months at -60°C to -60°C ± 5°C, 
for up to 3 months at-5°C ± 3°C and/or for up to 3 weeks at 25°C ± 5°C have been presented. Samples 
were tested for appearance, total RNA content, mRNA identity, purity, product-related impurities, %RNA 
encapsulation, in vitro translation, lipid identification, lipid content, lipid impurities, particle size, 
polydispersity, pH, particulate matter, container closure integrity test and bacterial endotoxin. 
All results were within the specification limits and support the proposed shelf-life. 
In conclusion, the proposed shelf-life for the bivalent vaccine is agreed: 9 months when stored at the 
recommended long-term storage condition of -50°C to -15 °C. After removal from the freezer, the 
unopened vaccine vial may be stored refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C, protected from light, for a maximum of 
30 days. Within this period, up to 12 hours may be used for transportation at 2°C to 8°C. 
Chemical and physical stability has also been demonstrated for unopened vaccine vials when stored for 
12 months at -50°C to -15°C provided that once thawed and stored at 2°C to 8°C, protected from light, 
the unopened vial will be used up within a maximum of 14 days (instead of 30 days, when stored at -
50ºC to -15ºC for 9 months). 
Once thawed, the vaccine should not be re-frozen.

The unopened vaccine may be stored at 8°C to 25°C up to 24 hours after removal from refrigerated 
conditions.  
This is in-line with the wording in section 6.3 in the SmPC.

The results of the CPP, PP, critical and non-critical IPC and release testing of the CX-031302 mRNA 
process verification batches were within the specifications and the prior defined acceptance criteria. Based 
on the outcome of the process verification exercise, the CX-031302 mRNA manufacturing process has 
been successfully verified at Moderna Norwood and Lonza Visp. 
CHMP comment: 
The process verification including 1 batch for the Moderna Norwood site produced in the new Kit 8 and 1 
batch from Lonza Visp was successfully conducted. Therefore, the manufacture of CX-031302 at Moderna 
Norwood (including Kit 8) and Lonza Visp at 75 l IVT scale is considered acceptable. 
Manufacturing process development: 
Comparability studies: 
All CIPC and IPC results met the acceptable ranges. Release results met both specification and 
comparability acceptance criteria and extended characterisation results met the comparability expected 
ranges established from development, clinical, Scale A, preliminary Scale B, and Scale B CX-024414 
mRNA data. Therefore, the results from the Scale B (75 L IVT scale) PPQ lots of CX-031302 mRNA 
manufactured at ModernaTX (Norwood, MA) and Lonza (Visp, Switzerland) demonstrated that the pre-
change and post-change manufacturing processes and quality attributes were comparable. 
CHMP comment:  
The comparability data clearly indicates that the quality of the CX-031302 mRNA is comparable to the 
quality of the parental CX-024414 mRNA, as all testing is within the comparability acceptance criteria.  
Elucidation of Structure and Other Characteristics: 
The structure, physicochemical properties of CX-031302 mRNA, were studied using a variety of 
techniques applicable to mRNAs. Unless otherwise indicated, data were generated from GMP lot 
84112C0702. The data generated from these analyses confirm the physico- chemical structure of CX-
031302 mRNA. 
Process impurities: 
Double Stranded RNA (dsRNA): 
Double stranded RNA (dsRNA) can potentially be formed during in vitro transcription. dsRNA can be 
recognised by receptors in the innate immune system, leading to production of immune-stimulatory 
cytokines. The innate immune responses of CX-031302 mRNA were assessed by a double stranded RNA 
(dsRNA) ELISA.  
Residual Protein: 
Residual protein was tested by a sandwich pAb ELISA method. 
CHMP comment: 
The characterisation of the new mRNA CX-031302 is considered acceptable.

Impurities: 
No new impurities as compared to parental mRNA. 
Specification: 
No change in specifications compared to CX-024414. 
Analytical procedures: 
The analytical methods used for release testing of CX-031302 and prototype CX-024414 are identical with 
the exception of the identity method, since this is the only method that is sequence-specific. 
Validation of analytical procedures: 
Confirmation of mRNA Sequence by RT-PCR and Sanger Sequencing has been validated and shown to be 
suitable for the purpose of determining the mRNA identity of CX-031302. The validation characteristic 
evaluated was specificity and intermediate precision. 
Specificity: 
To assess specificity, CX-031302 (mRNA-1273.529 RNA) was prepared and analysed once per SOP-1019. 
Testing was performed by one analyst and tested on the ABI 3500xL Genetic Analyzer. 
SeqScape software was used to assemble and compare the sequencing data for each sample type to the 
corresponding reference sequence listed below. There must be two-fold coverage on each DNA strand, 
except near the ends of the RT-PCR product, where four-fold coverage was provided on a single DNA 
strand.  
Additionally, each test article was also aligned against the incorrect reference sequence. The CX-031302 
(mRNA-1273.529 RNA) test article was aligned to the CX-024414 (mRNA-1273 RNA) reference sequence.

Stability: 
Additional scope: 
Type II: To extend the storage period of the biological active substance CX-024414 from 9 
months to 36 months when stored at long-term storage condition of -60°C to -90°C, not in 
accordance with an approved stability protocol. 
and  
Type II: To change the storage conditions of the biological active substance CX-244141 from 
{-20°C ± 5°C/Ambient RH} to {-60°C to -90°C}, when stability studies have not been 
performed in accordance with a currently approved stability protocol. 
Stability summary and conclusion: 
The CX-031302 registration stability program was executed according to ICH Q1A (R2), Stability Testing 
of new Drug Substances and Products, and ICH Q5C, Stability Testing of Biotechnological/Biological 
Products. An initial shelf life of 36 months is proposed for CX-031302 mRNA material stored in the 
commercial container closure system, when stored at the recommended long-term storage condition of -
60°C to -90°C. 
The properties of CX-031302 mRNA with respect to the attributes that affect product potency have been 
systematically and thoroughly assessed. These attributes include fidelity of the RNA sequence including 
cap, tail, and open reading frame, and integrity of the RNA. Direct measurements of those attributes have 
been established and are included in the routine release panel for CX-031302 mRNA. The stability of CX-

031302 mRNA will be evaluated against a broad set of stability data and modelling encompassing both 
CX-024414 mRNA registration lots and additional variant RNAs associated with the mRNA-1273 program. 
The product quality attribute expected to change most during the manufacturing and distribution of the 
product is mRNA purity, which represents the fraction of intact mRNA. The degradation of RNA in the 
product has been extensively studied by applying a sensitive chromatographic assay to assess the 
formation of RNA degradants. The principal route of degradation for RNA is hydrolytic chain scission to 
species that elute prior to the main peak (RNA fragments). mRNA purity correlates with protein levels 
measured in the in vitro relative protein expression assay. Direct measurement of RNA degradation 
utilising the RNA purity assay by RP-HPLC is precise, accurate, and the most stability-indicating measure 
of product activity. 
The degradation rates can be determined from the purity analysis over different stability time points. 
Based on the stochastic nature of the degradation mechanism, there is a dependence on the rate of 
degradation on RNA size (length). Since CX-024414 and CX-031302 mRNAs have approximately the 
same overall length (~4,000 nt), a similar rate of degradation is expected across these different 
sequences. 
Stability modelling results: 
Degradation rates for RNA purity were estimated for 3 different storage temperatures using the stability 
study results available for CX-024414 registration and variant RNA lots as of May 10, 2022. The rates 
along with their 95% confidence intervals are summarised in Table 4. These rates are expressed as a 
percentage of initial purity lost in the next month, not as a decrease in purity percentage units. For 
example, a 10% loss per month for 70% purity results in 63% after 1 month, since 10% of 70% purity is 
7 purity percentage units lost. The longest timepoint available for purity was 24 months at -60°C to -
90°C. The statistical models are based on first-order kinetics. The degradation rate for RNA purity stored 
at -60°C to -90°C is not significantly different from zero. The modelling confirmed similar degradation 
rates for CX-024414 mRNA and variant RNA supporting the same shelf life for CX-024414 and CX-031302 
mRNA. These results support a proposed shelf life of 36 months for CX-031302 mRNA when stored at -
60°C to -90°C per ICH guidelines.

CHMP comment: 
The shelf-life claim of 36 month at -60°C to -90°C is not acceptable. So far, the data provided for the 
stability model only includes 1 batch (DH-06126, CX-027367) that was stored at -60°C to -90°C for 12 
months. The MAH is asked to either provide more data or adapt the shelf life claim according to the data 
available. Furthermore, the MAH is asked to provide information on the mRNA CX-027367 characteristics 
to justify the comparability of this mRNA with CX-024414 and CX-031302.  
It is understood that the CX-031302 mRNA will be stored only at -60°C to -90°C for long-term storage. 
Therefore, the MAH is asked to justify why the supporting CX-031302 PPQ lot is not placed at -60°C to -
90°C but at -20 ± 5°C.

The MAH is asked to justify why the PPQ lot produced at Lonza Visp is not mentioned as supporting 
stability study (Table 1) and no stability protocols are included in the document.  
The MAH is asked to provide the batch data of the additional CX-031302 batches included in the stability 
studies (4011422007 and 4011822002). 
Post approval stability protocol and stability commitment: 
No additional post-approval protocol is provided. 
Stability data: 
1 month stability data of the CX-031302 was provided. 
CHMP comment: 
In this section Table 2 indicates a batch (MTDS20002) that was stored for 24 months at -60°C to - 90°C 
however the data was not provided and needs to be submitted. 
Type IA: To change an approved stability protocol of the active substance mRNA-1273 RNA to 
decrease from {-20°C ± 5°C/Ambient RH} to {-60°C to -90°C)}. 
Some aspects of these variations are already discussed in conjunction with the introduction of mRNA-
031302. However, also additional documents in the dossier of the original mRNA CX-024414 are affected. 
In section 3.2.S.2.2 the storage of the AS is described as follows.  
CX-024414 mRNA is stored at -60 to -90°C, after an optional interim storage temperature at -15 to -
25°C, in containers as defined in Section 3.2.S.6 {CX-024414 – Lonza Visp}. 
In section 3.2.S.6 however the document is still referring to storage at -15°C to -25°C. 
The MAH proposed to change the post approval stability protocol from -20°C to ±5°C to -60 to -90°C. 
However, the 10 L, 20 L, and 60 L IVT scale, CX-024414 mRNA lots manufactured at the US sites are still 
stored at -15 to -25°C. 
CHMP comment: 
The MAH is asked to provide an updated section 3.2.S.6 that includes the new storage temperature of -60 
to -90°C and adapt the suitability assessment of the container closure system.  
The MAH needs to clearly define the length of the optional interim storage at -15 to -25°C indicated in 
section S.2.2, and the proposal needs to be justified with stability data and included in the shelf-life 
claim. 
In the stability summary it is mentioned that the long-term storage moving on will be -60°C to -90°C for 
CX-024414, however in the present proposed document it is stated that 10 L, 20 L, and 60 L IVT scale, 
CX-024414 mRNA lots manufactured at the US sites are still stored at -15 to -25°C. This needs to be 
clarified and the section adapted accordingly (as well as all potentially affected section like S.2.2) 
The post approval stability commitment is now only for storage at -60°C to -90°C. However, the 10 L, 20 
L, and 60 L IVT scale, CX-024414 mRNA lots manufactured at the US sites are still stored at -15 to -
25°C. Therefore, the MAH is asked to retain also the -15 to -25°C storage conditions in the post approval 
commitment.

CHMP comment:  
The addition of the in-process controls filter integrity test is considered acceptable 
Type IB: Minor changes in the manufacturing process of the CX-024414 to the chromatography 
column in MC1 (already used at Norwood, US) at Lonza Visp as alternative to pre-packed 
chromatography column with diameter of 45.7 cm (Repligen). To use the chromatography 
column packed in-house used for the oligo dT chromatography process steps that is currently 
used at Moderna Norwood, is introduced at Lonza Visp, for the manufacturing of CX-024414. 
The chromatography column Packing in MC1 is already approved and used for Norwood. Lonza uses an 
equivalent one and will start to use the chromatography column Packing in MC1 as alternative to the pre-
packed chromatography column with diameter of 45.7 cm for the bivalent vaccine. The information is 
included in Table 6 in section S.2.2 Description of the Manufacturing Process and Process Controls {CX-
024414 – Lonza Visp} for the 75 l scale. 
CHMP comment: 
The introduction of the chromatography column at Lonza is considered acceptable, as this column is 
already used for CX-024414 production at the Moderna Norwood site.

Type II: To change the manufacturing process of the biological/immunological active 
substance CX-031302 to introduce a new manufacturing kit line  at (US) ModernaTX, Inc, MA, 
USA facility for mRNA-1273 RNA. 
Changes are described and validation data provided. Batch analysis data are also provided.  
CHMP comments  
All issues were appropriately addressed. 
Type II: To replace the current Purity and Product-related Impurities test procedure (RP-
HPLC) with an improved RP-IP-HPLC test for the CX-024414 used in the manufacturing 
process of the active substance CX-024414 and consequentially, due to the replacement of the 
analytical method, to change the “Product related impurities” specification limit for the active 
substance (CX-024414) used in the manufacturing process of the active substance DS CX-
024414 from < 30% pre-main peak to ≤ 30% RNA Fragments. There are editorial changes to 
remove the reference numbers of the methods from the Sections on CX-024414 specification 
that will be included in the end of the list. 
It is intended to replace the current reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) 
method by an improved reverse-phase ion pair high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-IP-HPLC) 
method to assess RNA purity in the mRNA-1273 RNAs CX- 024414 and CX-031302, mRNA-1273 LNP and 
mRNA-1273 Drug Product test samples. 
Separation of the RNA fragments and main peak (intact full length mRNA) for the previous RP-HPLC 
method was performed using the tangent line function within Chromeleon software. The x-intercept of the 
tangent line marked the vertical splitting of the RNA fragment peak and the main peak. The tangent line 
method was employed to improve integration consistency for chromatograms. 
The improved RP-IP HPLC method provides improved separation between RNA fragments and intact full-
length mRNA. This level of separation improvement comes from the systemic chemistry of mobile phases, 
column, and HPLC chromatographic configurations. The splitting of RNA fragments from the main peak is 
more easily identified based on the observed valley or local minimum. The clear separation results in 
more precise integration. The improved resolution achieved provides more consistent and accurate 
classification of peak areas into fragments and main peak.

to SOP numbers, and to provide the new name for the Absorbance-based Assay used to assess the % 
RNA Encapsulation. 
Method validation: 
Method validation is presented in validation report QC-MVR-0025 and applies to mRNA-1273 RNAs (CX- 
024414 and CX-031302), mRNA-1273 LNP and mRNA-1273 Drug Product. Refer to QC-MVR-0025 for 
details of the initial and supplemental validation results. The validation characteristics evaluated were: 
system suitability, specificity, linearity, accuracy; precision, range, robustness, determination of the 
detection and the quantitation limits and stability of standard and sample preparation solutions.  
Bridging study: 
A bridging study has been performed in order to demonstrate comparable results with both RNA purity 
methods. The bridging report QC-OTH-0801 is provided in section 3.2.P.5.6 Justification of Specifications 
{mRNA-1273 Injection}. This bridging study report presents the mRNA-1273 analytical results generated 
using improved Reversed Phase Ion-Pair (RP-IP) HPLC method (SOP-1142) for the analysis of mRNA 
purity, as compared to the current method (SOP-0996). 
Testing of the test articles listed were performed on both SOP-0996 and SOP-1142. Both methods were 
performed concurrently on the same day. The same vial of reference standard CX-024414, lot number 
DH-03180.1 was used to prepare standards for each method.  
Reported values by each method are presented in the bridging report QC-OTH-0801.  
Based on method validation and bridging study of both methods, revised acceptance criteria for mRNA 
Purity and Product-related Impurities is proposed. 
CHMP comment:  
RNA Purity is a release test for mRNA-1273 RNAs, mRNA-1273 LNP and mRNA-1273 Drug Product. A RP-
IP-HPLC has been introduced as new method to substitute the current RP-HPLC test. The method has 
been fully validated using adequate validation parameters. The validation report has been provided. The 
relevant dossier sections have been updated accordingly to include method description and method 
validation (Sections 3.2.S.4.2 Analytical Procedures (for both mRNA and mRNA-LNP), 3.2.P.4.2 Analytical 
Procedures, 3.2.S.4.3 Validation of Analytical Procedures (for both mRNA and mRNA-LNP) and 3.2.P.4.3 
Validation of Analytical Procedures).  
A bridging study has been performed to compare results obtained with both methods using mRNA, 
mRNA-LNP and DP samples. This study demonstrated that values obtained with the new method are 
higher. This is especially the case for DP samples. With the new method, an improved separation between 
RNA fragments and full-length mRNA can be achieved. This results in a more precise integration and 
areas that have been (falsely) defined as impurities are now added to the main peak that represent the 
intact RNA. Despite this observation, the specification limits for RNA purity have not been adjusted. 
Specifications must be revised in order to maintain the current, clinically justified, RNA purity range (MO). 
The MAH’s proposal to remove the SOP numbers from the product specification was not considered 
acceptable, and he was requested to include them back.

3.  Assessment of the responses to the request for 
supplementary information 
3.1.  Major objections 
CX-031302: 
1.  The shelf life claim of 36 months at -60°C to -90°C is not acceptable. So far, the data provided 
for the stability model only includes 1 batch (DH-06126, CX-027367) that was stored at -60°C to 
-90°C for 12 months. The MAH is asked to either provide more data or adapt the shelf life claim 
according to the data available. Furthermore, the MAH is asked to provide information on the 
mRNA CX-027367 characteristics to justify the comparability of this mRNA with CX-024414 and 
CX-031302. 
MAH’s response: Justification for the shelf-life for the CX-031302 is supported by the cumulative 
stability data acquired for the CX-024414 and associated variants. The primary shelf-life-limiting attribute 
for mRNA drug substance is RNA purity. For different RNA sequences formulated and processed similarly, 
the purity loss rate depends mainly on sequence length. The length of CX-024414 and associated variants 
is very similar, with overall length approximately 4000 nucleotides, varying within a 20-nucleotide range. 
RNA purity degradation for CX-031302 is expected to be very similar to purity degradation rates for CX-
024414 on this basis. 
There is no significant loss of purity for storage at -70°C; the estimated loss rate for RNA Purity is 0.0% 
per month. One study with 7 time points to 24 months is available at -70°C. The estimated shelf life for 
CX-024414 following the standard ICH approach is greater than 60 (5 years) for storage at (-60 to -90 
°C). A 36-month shelf life for CX-024414 mRNA and CX-031302 when stored at -70°C is proposed, 
limited to no more than 12 months beyond the longest time point tested (24 months). 
The main size purity degradation pathways of RNAs are hydrolysis, transesterification, and oxidation. All 
these pathways require the presence of reactive species (acids, bases, or oxidising species) at the 
reaction site. At -70 °C the CX-031302 and CX-024414 are expected to be below the glass transition 
temperature (Tg). When stored below the Tg, the chain mobility of macromolecular species, such as RNA, 
is essentially zero, therefore significantly suppressing the transesterification degradation pathway. 
Similarly, at -70 °C, the mobility of the reactive species (required for hydrolysis or oxidation reactions) is 
significantly restricted, and therefore size purity degradation rates are expected to be reduced. 
CX-027367 is the mRNA encoding the S protein sequence of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 (Beta) variant, 
incorporating the S-2P mutation. Relative to CX-024414, the spike protein encoded by CX-027367 
includes the following mutations: L18F-D80A-D215G-L242-244del-R246I-K417N-E484KN501Y-D614G-
A701V. The CX-023767 mRNA sequence was designed relative to the CX-024414 sequence, with changes 
introduced to match the B.1.351 variant-specific mutations. CX-027367 has a total length of 4092 
nucleotides; the lengths of CX-024414 and CX-031302 are 4101 nucleotides, and 4092 nucleotides, 
respectively. 
Assessment of the response: The MAH provided 24-month stability data for a batch of CX-0124414 
stored at -60°C to -90°C and described the characteristics of the CX-027367 mRNA that is used in the 
supportive stability study with 12 month data at -60°C to -90°C available. 
Issue solved.

Drug product: 
2.  The bridging study demonstrates that the new purity method consistently produces results that 
are higher compared to the current method. This is especially the case for the Drug Product (up 
to 6%), but also for mRNA and mRNA-LNPs. The purity specifications should be adjusted 
accordingly to reflect the current, clinically justified specifications. 
MAH’s response: 
The stability and release acceptance criteria for RNA purity and fragments are based on the minimum 
purity required to ensure efficacy throughout shelf life.  
Data on RNA fragments and RNA lipid adducts differences are provided  
The MAH agrees to provisionally adjusting the mRNA purity release specification for drug product tested 
using the improved method (SOP-1142) to account for the observed offset between purity methods. Side-
by-side testing of 20 GMP DP lots will be conducted to assess the magnitude of the offset between 
methods in real-world representative release laboratory testing. Please refer to the revised Section 
3.2.P.5.1 Specification(s) {mRNA-1273.214 – 0.10 mg/mL} reflecting the updated release purity limit for 
mRNA-1273.214 DP. The provisionally revised Justification of Specification section will be updated 
accordingly and provided with the closing sequence for this procedure. 
The adjustment will be reviewed and revised as supported by this updated dataset comparing results 
from SOP-0996 and SOP-1142 for GMP release testing. The MAH will review the release and End of Shelf 
Life (EOSL) specifications based on the results of these comparisons, additional stability data, to confirm 
the magnitude of the shift remains within the bounds that have been analysed to date. A revised 
justification of specification will be provided by the end of October 2022, leveraging additional 
comparative data between SOP-0996 and SOP-1142. 
The specification limits applied to the mRNA-1273 prototype DP (including both 0.2mg/mL and 0.1mg/mL 
strengths, in vial and pre-filled syringe presentations), remain unchanged, as the currently approved 
analytical method (SOP-0996) is retained for the prototype product. This is reflected in the current 
version of the Specifications sections, provided with this response. 
The MAH would like to clarify that the current specifications are based on safety and efficacy 
considerations. We acknowledge that the introduction of the improved purity assay for CX-031302 mRNA, 
mRNA-1273.529 LNP and mRNA-1273.214 DP has not followed a traditional approach and provide some 
additional context for introducing the new purity test for the bivalent components along with rationale for 
maintaining the current specifications. We also commit to providing additional comparative test results for 
the current and improved methods to confirm that the purity method change has no impact on patient 
safety or efficacy. 
The MAH additionally confirmed to change the end of shelf life limits. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response: The MAH agreed that the release and end of shelf life 
specifications will be adapted according to the assay induced shift in purity results. The final revised 
documents were provided. 
Conclusion: Issue solved. 
3.  The in vitro translation test that is performed as release test on the DP, is not able to distinguish 
between the two different mRNAs. Thus, there is no proof of functionality for both mRNAs if the 
test is done on the DP level. The in vitro translation test should be performed on the level of the 
mRNA-LNP intermediates as well unless functionality of both mRNA-LNPs in the final product can 
be demonstrated otherwise.

MAH’s response The MAH has utilised in vitro relative protein expression (IVRPE) to quantitatively 
confirm the intended protein expression level of each LNP comprising the mRNA-1273.214 drug product.  
The MAH provides study data to demonstrate correlation between IVRPE and in-vivo immunogenicity of 
drug product  
Immunogenicity was assessed after one and two injections of mRNA-1273 in mice by measurement of 
serum SARS-CoV-2 S2P spike binding antibody titers in the qualified enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA).  
The MAH provides relationship data for in vivo immunogenicity and purity results. The MAH provides 
comparison datasets and correlation models to measure the relationship between titer and IVRPE  
Assessment of MAH’s response: The control of functionality of each mRNA entering the composition of 
the mRNA-1273.214 DP at the mRNA-LNP stage should be controlled. 
Conclusion: Issue not solved.  
MAH’s 2nd response: The MAH acknowledges the CHMP’s comments and commits to improve the control 
of functionality of each mRNA entering the composition of the mRNA-1273.214 DP at the mRNA-LNP 
stage. 
Spikevax is currently controlled using the In-Vitro Translation (IVT) assay as part of the Drug Product 
(DP) specification. The In-Vitro Relative Protein Expression (IVRPE) assay is not part of the routine 
Quality Control testing, but rather a characterisation assay as part of analytical comparability. IVRPE will 
remain as part of analytical comparability at the mRNA-LNPs stage to support bivalent vaccine 
development with any process, scale, and site introduction. The MAH commits to work on the required 
implementation of the IVT assay at the mRNA-LNPs stage and submit the proposed change in Control 
Strategy by End of December 2022. 
Assessment of MAH’s 2nd response: The MAH commits to submit work on the required implementation 
of the IVT assay at the mRNA-LNPs stage and submit the proposed change in Control Strategy by End of 
December 2022. 
Conclusion: Issue solved with recommendation (REC1).

3.2.S.1.2 
4.  The MAH is asked to clearly indicate which mutations of the B.1.1.529 variant were included in 
the CX-031302 mRNA. So far it is only stated which mutations the B.1.1.529 variant itself might 
contain.  
MAH’s response 
The B.1.1.529 or Omicron variant emerged in South Africa and is currently circulating globally and was 
designated as a Variant of Concern on November 26, 2021. Specific additional details are provided.  
Assessment of the response: The MAH provided the requested information. However, this information 
should be included in section S.1.2 and submitted.

2nd response of the MAH: The MAH provides with this response document a revised version of section 
3.2.S.1.2 Structure {CX-031302} which integrates the elements previously provided in response to 
question Q2 (Round #3), related to mutations of the B.1.1.529 variant included in the CX-031302 mRNA. 
Assessment of the 2nd response: The MAH provided the requested information in the respective 
document. 
Issue solved. 
5.  The MAH is required to provide further clarification on specific aspects of the CX-031302 structure 
and alignment of the description/ colour coding with the figure.   
Assessment of the response: The MAH commits to align the description and color-coding of CX-024414 
at the next opportunity. 
Issue solved. 
6.  It is understood that the CX-031302 mRNA will be stored only at -60°C to -90°C for long-term 
storage. Therefore, the MAH is asked to justify why the supporting CX-031302 PPQ lot is not 
placed at -60°C to -90°C but at -20 ± 5°C.  
MAH’s response: The MAH confirms that the proposed long term storage condition for the CX-031302 
material is -60°C to -90°C. The supporting CX-031302 PPQ lot presented was stored at -20°C±5°C which 
is the storage conditions currently approved for the prototype CX-024414 and, as such, the condition 
applicable to CX material at the time of manufacturing. 
An additional batch of CX-031302 has been placed on stability at –60°C to 90°C storage condition to 
support the proposed long term storage condition. 
Assessment of the response: The MAH explained that the change in storage condition was made after 
the PPQ storage was started. 
Issue solved. 
7.  The MAH is asked to justify why the PPQ lot produced at Lonza Visp is not mentioned as 
supporting stability study (Table 1) and no stability protocols are included in the document.  
MAH’s response: Section 3.2.S.7.1 Stability Summary and Conclusions {CX-031302} was updated and 
is provided with this response. 
Assessment of the response: Table 1 still requires update. 
Issue not solved. 
2nd response of the MAH: Table 1 of section 3.2.S.7.1 Stability Summary and Conclusions {CX-
031302}-EU-EMA describes stability study that was initiated to support the introduction of production 
process train 8 at Moderna TX, Inc (Norwood, MA, USA). Only batch 4011422002 from Moderna TX, Inc 
(Norwood, MA, USA) was executed in this context. 
The stability studies conducted on Lonza Visp PPQ batch 4011822001 to support the introduction of the 
new CX-031302 material is described in section S.7.1, Table 3. Stability protocols for both batches are 
detailed in the 3.2.S.7.1 Stability Summary and Conclusions {CX-031302}-EU-EMA section: 4011422002 
(Table 5 and Table 6) and 4011822001 (Table 12 and Table 13). The section is re-submitted.

Assessment of the 2nd response: The MAH explained why the batch was not included in Table1 and 
included it in Table 3. However, Table 3 is titled “CX-031302 mRNA -60°C to -90°C Stability Lots” and the 
PPQ batch 4011822001 is not even stored at -60°C to -90°C. Therefore, inclusion of the batch in Table 3 
should be clarified. 
Issue not solved. 
3rd response of the MAH: The MAH renamed the table. 
Assessment of the 3rd response:  
Issue solved. 
8.  The MAH is asked to provide the batch data of the additional CX-031302 batches included in the 
stability studies (4011422007 and 4011822002). 
MAH’s response: Section 3.2.S.7.1 Stability Summary and Conclusions {CX-031302} was updated 
accordingly and is provided with this response. 
Assessment of the response: The answer is not completely understood. The MAH was asked to provide 
the batch data of 4011422007 and 4011822002 in an updated section S.4.4. 
Issue not solved. 
2nd response of the MAH: Please find attached a revised version of section 3.2.S.4.4 Batch Analyses 
{CX-031302} including batches analysis data for 4011422007 and 4011822002. 
Assessment of the 2nd response: The MAH included the batch data in the respective dossier section. 
Issue solved. 
3.2.S.7.3 
9.  In section S.7.3 Table 2 indicates a batch (MTDS20002) that was stored for 24 month at -60°C to 
- 90°C however the data was not provided and needs to be submitted. 
MAH’s response: The 24 months stability data for the batch MTDS20002 stored at -60°C to -90°C are 
provided with this response (refer to Section 3.2.S.7.3 Stability Data {CX-024414}, Table 54). 
Assessment of the response: The MAH provided the requested information.

10. The MAH is asked to provide an updated section 3.2.S.6 that includes the new storage 
temperature of -60 to -90°C and adapt the suitability assessment of the container closure 
system. 
MAH’s response: The MAH provided the updated the Section 3.2.S.6. The container closure system 
suitability assessment was updated considering the new storage temperature of -90°C to -60°C. 
Assessment of the response: The MAH provided an updated section.

11. The MAH needs to clearly define the length of the optional interim storage at -15 to -25°C 
indicated in section S.2.2, and the proposal needs to be justified with stability data and included 
in the shelf life claim. 
MAH’s response. 
The MAH provides further clarification on interim storage durations.  
Assessment of the response 
The MAH is asked to provide further updated sections.  
Issue not solved  
2nd response of the MAH: The MAH acknowledges the CHMP’s request and provides following updated 
sections including an optional interim storage duration of up to 3 months (90 days) at -15°C to 25°C:

3.2.S.7.1/2 
12. In the stability summary it is mentioned that the long term storage moving on will be -60°C to -
90°C for CX-024414, however in the present proposed document it is stated that 10 L, 20 L, and 
60 L IVT scale, CX-024414 mRNA lots manufactured at the US sites are still stored at -15 to -
25°C. This need to be clarified and the section adapted accordingly (as well as all potentially 
affected section like S.2.2)  
MAH’s response: The MAH would like to clarify that the batches currently included in the ongoing 
stability studies remain stored at the initial long term storage temperature of -25°C to -15°C. The MAH 
has not applied for this change for the material manufactured at the 10L, 20L and 60L IVT scales, since 
only the 75L IVT scale is currently used for routine commercial manufacturing. 
In the event that a batch will need to be manufactured at any of the smaller scales, the storage 
conditions of -90°C to -60°C, if approved, will apply. 
Assessment of the response: The MAH clarified that so far as only 75l IVT is manufactured right now. 
In case of foreseen production of smaller scales, a variation will be submitted. 
Issue solved.

13. The post approval stability commitment is now only for storage at -60°C to -90°C. However, the 
10 L, 20 L, and 60 L IVT scale, CX-024414 mRNA lots manufactured at the US sites are still 
stored at -15 to -25°C. Therefore, the MAH is asked to retain also the -15 to -25°C storage 
conditions in the post approval commitment. 
MAH’s response: See answer to question 12. 
Assessment of the response: The answer to question 12 clarifies the storage conditions that will be 
applied to 10 L, 20 L and 60 L batches if produced again. 
Issue solved. 
Drug product intermediates: 
14. The MAH should provide information on the IPCs for the drug product intermediate.  
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The MAH provided information on the IPCs for the drug product intermediate and to reflect the current 
specifications in Module 3 of the dossier, manufacturing information  
Assessment of the response 
Module 3 has been updated with the required information. 
The question is resolved.  
mRNA-1273 LNP 
15. It remains unclear whether 3.2.S.4.2 Analytical Procedures {mRNA-1273 LNP} has been updated 
as intended. A detailed comparison between the updated and the current version should be 
provided. 
Summary of the MAH responses: 
The MAH confirms that the latest submitted version of Section 3.2.S.4.2 Analytical Procedures {mRNA-
1273 LNP} has been updated as intended and provides a detailed comparison (redline document) 
between the current version, that was submitted with the Line extension procedure X064, and the 
proposed updated version included in this procedure. 
In the redline document (refer to document 3.2.S.4.2 Analytical Procedures {mRNA-1273 LNP} v10 
redline), the text added with this variation appears in red, while the removed parts appear as 
strikethrough. 
Section 3.2.S.4.2 Analytical Procedures {mRNA-1273 LNP} is also attached to this response, including the 
correction to reflect the SOP update in Table 1. 
Assessment of the responses: 
The question has been raised since it has been stated in the reviewer’s guide that new name for the 
Absorbance-based Assay used to assess the % RNA Encapsulation has been introduced 3.2.S.4.2 
Analytical Procedures {mRNA-1273 LNP}. However, the wording has not been consistently used for 
mRNA-1273 LNP and mRNA-1273.529. The MAH is asked to review the submitted documents. In the case 
that besides the name change any other changes will be implemented a detailed comparison between the 
updated and the current version as submitted with the response to the 1st CMC LoQ should be provided.

Summary of the MAH responses to outstanding issue: 
Please find with the submission a revised version of section 3.2.S.4.2 Analytical Procedures {mRNA-1273 
LNP - ROW}, submitted with the responses to the 1st round of CMC questions dated 03 August 2022. The 
analytical method name was aligned to “absorbance-based assay”, as described initially in the reviewer’s 
guide, and as presented for the mRNA-1273.529 LNP material. The MAH confirms that there is no change 
to the method itself, and the same method is used for the analysis of both mRNA-1273 LNP and mRNA-
1273.529 LNP materials. 
Assessment of responses to outstanding issue: 
The dossier has been updated as requested.  
The question is resolved. 
16. Apparently, incorrect method IDs are provided for purity testing in Section 3.2.S.4.2 (Table 2) 
and 3.2.S.4.3 (Tables 1-3). The dossier should be updated accordingly. 
Summary of the MAH responses to outstanding issue: 
Section 3.2.S.4.2 was updated as part of response to the 1st round of CMC questions to include the 
references to the analytical method SOPs (or method IDs), as requested by the Agency 
Please refer to the Section 3.2.S.4.2, Table 1, submitted with the responses to the 1st LOQs for the 
correct version of the Section (Note: Table 2 of Section 3.2.S.4.2 relates to instruments, equipment and 
reagents for the identity test). 
An updated Section 3.2.S.4.3 Validation of Analytical Procedures {mRNA-1273 LNP - ROW} is provided 
here to reflect the correct reference to method IDs (Table 1), method transfer report (Table 2) and 
method validation report (Table 3) for the purity test. 
Assessment of responses to outstanding issue: 
The MAH provided the updated documents. 
The question is resolved. 
mRNA-1273.529 LNP 
17. Section 3.2.S.2.4 refers to the respective section for 1273 LNP-B, and according to the document 
the manufacturing process and controls are identical. However, during manufacture of the PPQ 
batches apparently a reduced set of controls has been applied. It is unclear which parameters and 
controls apply – a clarification is requested, and the dossier should be updated accordingly, if 
necessary. 
Summary of the MAH responses to outstanding issue: 
The following microbial control strategy elements are currently applicable for the manufacture of the 
mRNA-1273 LNP-B: 
• Post-use sanitisation of the mixing skid 
• Pre-filtration bioburden and endotoxin testing of the mixed product 
• Clarification (0.2 μm terminal filter) of the mixed product & filter integrity testing 
The pre-use sanitisation controls previously listed in 3.2.S.2.4 {mRNA-1273 LNP}-US [Seq 0247] and 
Section 3.2.S.2.4 {mRNA-1273 LNP}-Lonza Visp [Seq 0342] are now moved under site cleaning

validation requirements. Post use cleaning is always performed, while pre-use cleaning is performed 
depending on the established clean hold time and actual durations between batches. 
The microbial controls for water and CX-024414 presented in current Section 3.2.S.2.4 {mRNA-1273 
LNP}-US [Seq 0247] and Section 3.2.S.2.4 {mRNA-1273 LNP}-Lonza Visp [Seq 0342] were determined 
to be redundant to the description of control of quality of water described in the site-specific Sections 
3.2.A.1 and the specifications for CX-024414 mRNA in Section 3.2.S.4.1 {CX-024414} [Seq 0254]; they 
were consequently removed from the recently submitted Section 3.2.S.2.4 {mRNA-1273 LNP}-Rovi 
Granada [Seq 0237]. 
Description of microbial testing performed after post-use sanitisation of the skid testing was also 
determined to be an element of cleaning procedure and cleaning validation rather than process-specific 
microbial control, and therefore beyond the scope of the Section 3.2.S.2.4, and was removed from 
Section 3.2.S.2.4 in recent introductions. 
These redundant details will be removed from the current Section 3.2.S.2.4 {mRNA-1273 LNP}-US [Seq 
0247] and Section 3.2.S.2.4 {mRNA-1273 LNP}-Lonza Visp [Seq 0342] to align the content of the 
3.2.S.2.4 sections as an editorial update at the next opportunity. 
Assessment of responses to outstanding issue: 
The MAH clarified that several controls were moved to site cleaning requirements as these are not 
considered process-specific specific. The approach is deemed acceptable. The MAH will remove the 
redundant information in the dossier section with the next opportunity. 
The question is resolved. 
18. Section 3.2.S.5 incorrectly refers to CX-024414 (instead of CX-031302) and should be corrected 
accordingly. 
Summary of the MAH responses to outstanding issue: 
The MAH clarifies that the reference is correct with the following rationale. RNA reference material is used 
as a system suitability standard for several release tests and is also used as a reference standard for 
measurement of total RNA content. With the development of mRNA-1273 variant mRNA such as CX-
031302, and related variant mRNA-1273 LNP and DP materials, CX-024414 RNA reference material will 
be used to support testing of mRNA-1273 variant RNA, LNP, and DP materials. As a system suitability 
standard, this material is used to assess the system suitability of the analytical testing, for example the 
consistency of retention time or peak area response in an HPLC-UV method. In this application of the 
reference material, it is justified to use a qualified reference material with a different mRNA sequence 
from the test sample to assess system suitability, i.e., the use of prototype CX-024414 mRNA reference 
material to support the testing of variant CX-031302 mRNA or mRNA-1273.529 LNP. 
Similarly, the prototype reference material can be used to quantitate total RNA content for variant LNP 
and DP test samples. Since the mRNA-1273 RNAs all have similar lengths, they have very similar molar 
extinction coefficients. For example, the calculated sequence-corrected coefficient for CX-031302 mRNA 
(33.99 μg/mL) and CX-024414 mRNA (34.01 μg/mL) are within 0.06% of each other. Thus, the use of a 
single RNA standard is suitable for total RNA content measurement across different variant mRNA-1273 
materials. 
The MAH agrees that in cases where an attribute is measured by comparison of a test sample against a 
comparator, a qualified reference standard should be used. Most of the analytical test methods used for 
testing release and stability of CX-031302 do not require this type of comparison to report results and 
therefore do not utilise product-specific reference standards. 
Assessment report  
EMA/896245/2022 
Page 42/191 
 
 
 
 
 
- For Total RNA content testing, the reference material is used as the calibrator against which samples are 
compared to obtain the total RNA content values; a sequence-specific reference standard is not required 
for this assay. 
- Sanger sequencing test methods are used to confirm identity for both mRNA-1273 RNA and LNP. These 
test methods can experimentally measure the nucleotide sequence of specific regions of the RNA. Test 
results are compared against the theoretical mRNA sequence to confirm identity of the test sample. Since 
the data reporting is using a theoretical mRNA sequence and not compared against the reference material 
sequence, a product-specific reference standard is not utilised for these test methods. In this case, the 
mRNA reference material is used as a positive control for the test method and serves as a system 
suitability standard. 
- Assays such as %PolyA tailed variants, use a relative measurement of a specific peak of interest (such 
as a PolyA tail peak) relative to a total peak area within the same test sample to report results. The 
measurement of purity and product-related impurities by ion pairing reversed-phase chromatography 
uses a similar approach, where the purity and impurity peaks are measured in relation to the total peak 
area within a sample chromatogram. In both cases, a product-specific reference standard is not needed 
to measure the attributes of interest. To assess the system performance parameters such as peak area or 
retention time consistency within the run as system suitability, any standard that chromatographs 
similarly to the analyte of interest can be used, and a product-specific reference standard is not 
necessarily needed. In the case of the RP IP HPLC purity method, a single mRNA standard (CX-024414) is 
used to assess system suitability. 
- For in vitro translation (IVT) for protein expression testing, after the mRNA test sample is translated 
into protein and labelled, it is separated on a gel and then compared against a protein molecular weight 
ladder standard to determine size. Its size is not compared against that of the mRNA reference material 
tested on the same gel. In this case, the mRNA reference material is used as a positive control for the 
test method and serves as a system suitability standard. 
Assessment of responses to outstanding issue: 
The MAH justified the use of CX-024414 as RNA reference material. 
The question is resolved. 
19. The process qualification summary document in section S.2.5 refers only to the Moderna Norwood 
and Lonza Visp mRNA-1273.529 LNP-B PPQ batches, but not to the PPQ batch manufactured at 
Rovi Granada. This should be clarified. In addition, the document title should be changed from 
“3.2.S.2.5 Process Validation and/or Evaluation {mRNA-1273 LNPs-B}” to “3.2.S.2.5 Process 
Validation and/or Evaluation {mRNA-1273.529 LNP-B}” and references in the summary document 
to other sections should be reviewed and revised as appropriate. 
Summary of the MAH responses: 
The MAH acknowledges the comment and provides a new version of the Section 3.2.S.2.5 Process 
Validation and/or Evaluation {mRNA-1273.529 LNP-B}, updated with the data from Rovi Granada and 
revised nomenclature for mRNA-1237.529 LNP-B material. 
Assessment of the responses: 
Module 3 has been updated as requested.  
The question is resolved. 
20. A formal comparability protocol is presented in 3.2.S.2.6 (of note, the protocol seems to be 
duplicated). The comparability acceptance criteria for purity/mRNA-related impurities seem to be 
Assessment report  
EMA/896245/2022 
Page 43/191 
 
 
 
 
based on the current RP-HPLC method (Table 11, 13, and 14). However, due to the off-set/no 
determination of IG2, results obtained by the proposed new RP-IP-HPLC method are not directly 
comparable to results obtained by the current method. The comparability criteria should be 
updated accordingly. 
Summary of the MAH responses to outstanding issue: 
The formal comparability protocol lists impurity ranges that include impurity groups associated with the 
current RP-HPLC test method (SOP-0996) reporting as the method continues to be used for release 
testing of CX-024414 mRNA and mRNA-1273 LNP-B. With global approval of the purity method change to 
SOP-1142, the protocol will be updated to completely align with SOP-1142 impurity reporting. 
Specification limits for purity and impurities associated with both purity methods (SOP-0996 and SOP-
1142) are identical. When establishing the comparability criteria for purity and impurities by SOP-0996, 
tolerance interval analysis of a dataset of representative clinical and commercial lots distributed beyond 
the lower purity specification limit and upper impurity specification limits. 
Thus, the established comparability criteria are closely aligned with the lower purity specification limit and 
upper impurity specification limits for SOP-0996. With the same specification limits being applied for SOP-
1142, the currently established comparability criteria can still be applied to data generated using SOP-
1142 to demonstrate comparability. 
Assessment of responses to outstanding issue: 
The MAH approach to maintain the comparability ranges until global approval of the purity method 
change is acceptable. However, the MAH´s position that the comparability criteria based on data 
originating from method SOP-0996 can still be applied to results obtained with method SOP-1142 is not 
endorsed. For future comparability studies, the comparability criteria for mRNA purity/impurities should 
be updated accordingly in line with the specification limits for mRNA purity/impurity.  
The question is resolved with recommendation (REC8).  
21. The loss rates/CI reported in Tables 5 and 7 of Section 3.2.S.7.1 slightly differ – a clarification is 
requested. In addition, the stability programmes differ between Moderna, Rovi, and Lonza – a 
justification is requested. 
Summary of the MAH responses to outstanding issue: 
Please find attached a revised version of section 3.2.S.7.1 Stability Summary and Conclusions mRNA-
1273.529 LNP-B EU. For clarity, the title of Table 5 has been corrected to clarify it covers both -70°C and 
5°C storage temperatures. The results presented have been updated with the latest stability modelling 
results and are now in line with Table 7. Table 7 provided the correct degradation rates for mRNA-1273 
LNP at -70°C and 5°C as established based on the latest data available in May 2022. The complete 
subsection 3.2.S.7.1.1 “Stability Modelling Results” has been revised to integrate the latest statistical 
analysis performed in May 2022 (data from a previous analysis dated December 2021 remained). 
Different stability protocols have been established for the registration batches from each site, on the basis 
of the knowledge cumulated at the time each protocol was established. The stability protocols being 
designed for the post approval stability studies and stability commitments will result from the same 
extensive stability data evaluation; stability protocols are being progressively harmonised across sites in 
terms of testing frequency and testing panel. 
The cumulated knowledge of product degradation profile allowed the MAH to reduce the testing frequency 
for some of the quality attributes in the stability studies. The shelf life limiting attribute is mandatory at 
Assessment report  
EMA/896245/2022 
Page 44/191 
 
 
 
 
 
each time point, instead PH, RNA content, % RNA encapsulation, lipids content and lipid impurities testing 
frequency has been reduced. The protocol in Table 11 is the new standard harmonised protocol, revised 
based on the extensive stability data available and will be implemented going forward for each new 
mRNA-1273 LNP-B stability studies. The protocols in Table-9 and Table-10 represent pre harmonisation 
stability programs for mRNA-1273 LNP-B stability studies. 
Assessment of responses to outstanding issue: 
The MAH provided the corrected documents and provided a clarification for the different stability 
programs. 
The question is resolved.  
22. The MAH states that mRNA purity is the stability limiting attribute; however, for two 
development lots Lot DH-06191.1 and DH-06191.2) after 12 months storage at -60°C to -90°C, 
OOS results are obtained for %encapsulation. This observation should be further discussed by 
the MAH. 
Summary of the MAH responses to outstanding issue: 
As shown in section 3.2.S.7.3 Stability Data {mRNA-1273 LNP – ROW}, % encapsulation is stable over 
an extended time (at least 18 months demonstrated for several lots) when mRNA-1273 LNP is stored 
at -70°C. 
The lower than expected %encapsulation values for development lots DH-06191.1 and DH-06191.2 
were observed after a freezer unit where the materials were chambered, was re-located to a new 
laboratory. Testing of original retains of this material stored in a different freezer unit at -70°C for > 
12 months resulted in %encapsulation > 90% for both lots. Thus, the stability vials likely had 
undergone an unintended destabilisation (for example, an uncontrolled thaw and refreeze over 
extended duration) during the freezer re-location and the material was compromised. This arm of the 
stability study will be halted with no further data generated. 
Assessment of responses to outstanding issue: 
The MAH provided the justification for the OOS for % encapsulation which was due to the re-location of 
the freezer unit the samples were stored in. 
The question is resolved. 
23. Section 3.2.S.7.3 for mRNA-1273.529 LNP should be updated. The heading of this section 
changes from page 5 on. ‘mRNA-1273 LNP’ should be replaced in text and tables by ‘mRNA-
1273.529 LNP’ where applicable. 
Summary of the MAH responses: 
The MAH is providing an updated Section 3.2.S.7.3 for mRNA-1273.529 LNP, including the correction of 
the headings. 
Assessment of the responses: 
Module 3 has been updated as requested.

Summary of the MAH responses: 
Please find attached to this response document a listing of all major deviations and OOS results observed 
in the stability program for mRNA-1273 LNP, mRNA-1273.529 LNP and other Stability Modelling Lots. No 
major deviation potentially impacting the Stability Model Exercise was identified. 
Assessment of the responses: 
Documentation has been provided as requested.  
The question is resolved. 
Drug product: 
mRNA 1273 DP injection 
25. Section 3.2.P.1 lists only the composition of 0.1 mg/mL, 3.2 mL product; the description of the 
composition of the 0.2 mg/mL, 6.4 mL product is missing and should be added. 
Summary of the MAH responses to outstanding issue: 
Section 3.2.P.1 Description and Composition of the Drug Product {mRNA-1273.214 DP - 0.10 mg/mL} 
[Seq 0337] was issued upon EMA recommendation to only submit information specific to the bivalent 
mRNA-1273.214 DP product version. It covers the description of the 0.10 mg/mL presentation 
composition for 3.2 mL and 6.3 mL fill volumes. 
The bivalent mRNA-1273.214 DP product version will not be manufactured at the 0.20 mg/mL strength. 
As a consequence, the composition of the monovalent specific presentations described as part of the 
Spikevax platform 3.2.P.1 Description and Composition of the Drug Product {mRNA-1273 DP - ROW} 
[Seq 0334], was not reported in the new mRNA-1273.214 specific section version. 
Assessment of responses to outstanding issue: 
The MAH clarified that the bivalent vaccine will only be produced at 0.10 mg/ml. However, the question 
relates to module DP mRNA-1273, injection that describes the current monovalent mRNA-1273 DP. The 
0.2 mg/mL strength should be described in this module. An update with the closing sequence is 
acceptable. 
The question is resolved with recommendation (REC9). 
Manufacturing process development 
26. Some release test results (purity and product-related impurities) are pending for all DP 
manufacturing sites and should be provided.  
Summary of MAH’s response: 
The purity and product-related impurities results collected during PPQ on the Unlabeled mRNA-1273.214 
DP intermediate are presented in section 3.2.P.2.3 Manufacturing Process Development {mRNA-
1273.214} for each manufacturing site: 
- Catalent – As part of interim characterisation testing in Table 27. 
- Recipharm – As part of interim characterisation testing in Table 31.

and product-related impurities data collected on the Unlabeled DP intermediate. Purity being the shelf-life 
indicating parameter, it is tested during routine operation after thawing and labelling / packaging 
activities. (These activities were not yet completed at time of submission). The final CoA is issued after 
purity testing of the labelled DP (LDP), supporting release of the Labelled mRNA-1273.214 DP batches. 
The MAH provided information on commercial label and pack activities. Section 3.2.P.5.4 Batch Analyses 
{mRNA-1273.214} will be updated with final release results from all sites in Early September 2022. 
Assessment of MAH’s response: 
The MAH has provided final CoAs for Catalent, Rovi and two Monza batches. Thus, the final CoA for the 
Recipharma PPQ lots and 1 Monza lot are missing. The MAH states that final CoAs will be available by end 
of August 2022 and section 3.2.P.5.4 Batch Analyses {mRNA-1273.214} will be updated in early 
September 2022. 
Conclusion: Issue solved. Remaining CoA and updated section 3.2.P.5.4 Batch Analyses {mRNA-
1273.214} will be provided in early September 2022 (REC4). 
27. Final results for the CPP TOR/CPD should be provided for all DP manufacturing sites. 
Summary of MAH’s response: 
The final Time out of Refrigeration (TOR) and Cumulative Process Duration (CPD) supported by the PPQ 
exercise for each site up to the manufacture of the commercial labelled mRNA- 1273.214 DP batches 
(LDP) are provided. For the Catalent and Recipharm sites, the final PPQ report covering final TOR and 
CPD up to the LDP stage are not yet available (Refer to Item 12). 
Assessment of MAH’s response: 
TOR/CPD results have been provided for Rovi and Monza batches. The MAH commits to providing the 
TOR/CPD results from Catalent and Recipharm by September 2022 and October 2022, respectively. 
Conclusion: Issue solved. Outstanding TOR/CPD results will be provided in September/October 2022 
(REC5). 
28. The comparability reports are missing and should be provided. 
Summary of MAH’s response 
The overall mRNA-1273.214 comparability report DS-IND-0143 covering all four sites (Catalent, 
Recipharm, Rovi, Patheon Monza) is provided with this response. Please note that the report also includes 
the results obtained for the site Patheon Greenville, that is not registered in EU (as not relevant for EU 
market supply), and therefore not presented in Section 3.2.P.2.3. 
Assessment of MAH’s response: 
The comparability report DS-IND-0143 has been provided. 
Conclusion: Issue solved.

Summary of the MAH responses to outstanding issue: 
Please find attached revised versions of the following P.3.3 sections with a revised description of the 
mRNA-LNPs pooling step: 
- 3.2.P.3.3 Description of Manufacturing Process and Process Controls {Catalent - mRNA-1273.214} - 
See 3.2.P.3.3.1.1 LNP Pooling 
- 3.2.P.3.3 Description of Manufacturing Process and Process Controls {Rovi -mRNA-1273.214} - See 
3.2.P.3.3.2.1 LNP Pooling 
The same description of the LNP pooling step than provided for the Patheon Monza and Recipharm sites 
have been incorporated. 
The Critical In-Process Control (CIPC) for weight ratio was already described in the IPC tables (Table 2 for 
Catalent and Rovi; Table 3; Table 2 for Recipharm and Patheon Monza). 
Assessment of responses to outstanding issue: 
The MAH provided more detailed descriptions of the pooling step. 
The question is resolved. 
30. It is unclear why filtration pressure has been removed from the table of clarification process 
parameters (Table 9, 3.2.P.3.3 Description of Manufacturing Process and Process Controls 
{Recipharm – mRNA-1273.214}), although the legend indicates that this parameter is still 
controlled. The table should be revised accordingly. The same is true for Monza site. 
Summary of MAH’s response: 
The MAH would like to highlight that all IPCs are now described together in Table 3 of Sections 3.2.P.3.3 
{mRNA-1273.214 - Recipharm} and 3.2.P.3.3 {mRNA-1273.214 - TFS Monza}. It is confirmed that 
filtration pressure is still listed as an IPC for the clarification filtration step for both sites. 
Assessment of MAH’s response: 
The MAH has clarified that filtration pressure during the clarification step is controlled as IPC at 
Recipharm and Monza. This measure was listed both as process parameter and IPC before. Now 
clarification filtration pressure is consistently defined as IPC for all sites and has been removed from the 
lists of process parameters. 
Conclusion: Issue solved. 
31. Flowrate, filtration pressure and duration of filtration have been removed from the list of sterile 
filtration process parameters (Table 10 of Section 3.2.P.3.3 Description of Manufacturing Process 
and Process Controls {Recipharm – mRNA-1273.214}), as compared to the 0.2 mg/ml process, 
although the text indicates that parameters are maintained. The table should be revised 
accordingly. The same parameters should also be included in the respective table for Monza site. 
Also for Monza, the description in the text indicates that filtration duration and filtration pressure 
are controlled.  
Summary of MAH’s response: 
The MAH would like to highlight that all IPCs are now described together in Table 3 of Sections 3.2.P.3.3 
{mRNA-1273.214 - Recipharm} and 3.2.P.3.3 {mRNA-1273.214 – TFS Monza}. 
With regards to Recipharm, the following evolution can be noted and compared to the 0.20

• 
Filtration pressure limit for Sterile Filtration remains a CIPC and is listed in Table 3 of Section 
3.2.P.3.3. The limit is unchanged. 
The corresponding parameter is also listed in Table 3 of Section 3.2.P.3.3 for TFS Monza.

media fill, whichever is shorter. The duration is set at maximum for Recipharm and the parameter has 
been added in Table 10 of Section 3.2.P.3.3. 
The corresponding parameter (maximum 36 h for each filtration line) has also been added to Table 10 
of Section 3.2.P.3.3 for TFS Monza. Actual durations for this process step are summarised below. 
The filtration flux parameter for sterile filtration (Table 10 of Section 3.2.P.3.3) has been removed 
since it is not relevant for sites performing filtration with on-line filling. The filtration is governed by 
the (vial) fill rate and is not a directly controlled process parameter. As part of process fit, the MAH 
verifies that at the maximum fill rate on the line, the flow-rate is below the stated flux limit. 
The MAH provided information on the flow rate used on various manufacturing lines. 
Assessment of MAH’s response: 
The MAH has clarified that Filtration pressure during Sterile Filtration is controlled as CIPC. The filtration 
process duration has been added to the list of process parameters for Monza and Recipharm. It is 
acceptable that the filtration flux has been removed as process parameter for sites performing filtration 
with on-line filling. 
Conclusion: Issue solved. 
32. In the process validation report for Monza, a high number of process parameters and critical 
process parameters is listed for the different manufacturing steps. This is not consistent with the 
PP given in section 3.2.P.3.3. and the CPP given in section 3.2.P.3.4. This should be clarified. 
Summary of MAH’s response 
The MAH has implemented a consistent set of CPPs and CIPCs (presented in Section 3.2.P.3.4) across all 
manufacturing sites. Individual manufacturing sites have different definitions for CPPs as governed by 
their specific strategies to achieve control over operational and business risks. Thus, at the site level, 
additional controls may be implemented, where relevant, for operational needs based on site specific 
SOPs and control systems.  
TFS Monza operationally defines multiple CPPs in each manufacturing step to ensure successful execution 
and control. All parameters that are controlled are CPPs. The MAH uses a stricter definition for CPPs – 
failure of which has risk impact on batch quality. The combination of IPCs (including CIPCs) with defined 
PPs and CPPs ensures that the batch quality is maintained. These have been consistently defined and 
used by the MAH across global manufacturing sites. Adapting these to each site would result in highly 
inconsistent control strategy, since as stated above, each site has their own definitions as well as 
terminology. In all cases, parameters with potential to impact to batch quality are controlled as CPPs or 
CIPCs and have resulted in consistent drug product quality over more than a 1000 drug product batches 
at 7 fill-finish manufacturing sites across the globe. 
Assessment of MAH’s response: 
The MAH explains that in addition to the CPPs and CIPCs that are consistently defined for all DP 
manufacturing sites, each site has its specific control strategy that might include further controls. It is 
further clarified that the definition of a CPP is different between the MAH and Monza manufacturing site. 
It is considered confusing that in the process validation report different CPPs and PPs are defined than in 
the associated dossier parts. In addition, the definition of a CPP should generally be the same for all sites 
however, this can be accepted.

Conclusion: Issue solved. 
33. To avoid misunderstanding, table 3 in section 3.2.P.3.3 Description of Manufacturing Process and 
Process Controls {Rovi – mRNA-1273.214} should be updated to include all process parameters 
for this step, not only the changed parameters. It is expected that buffer charge, buffer transfer 
rate and process temperature are maintained as process parameters for the dilution step. 
Summary of MAH’s response: 
The Section 3.2.P.3.3 Description of Manufacturing Process and Process Controls {Rovi – mRNA-
1273.214} has been revised accordingly and is provided with this submission. 
Assessment of MAH’s response: 
Table 3 in section 3.2.P.3.3 Description of Manufacturing Process and Process Controls {Rovi – mRNA-
1273.214} has been revised as requested. 
Conclusion: Issue solved. 
34. All process parameters for the DP dilution/mixing steps at Catalent should be given in section 
3.2.P.3.3. Only buffer charge is currently indicated as (critical) process parameter here. It is 
expected that the process parameters used in the monovalent vaccine (mixing speed, mixing 
duration, process temperature, buffer transfer rate) at this steps will be maintained. 
Summary of MAH’s response 
The Section 3.2.P.3.3 Description of Manufacturing Process and Process Controls {Catalent – mRNA-
1273.214} has been revised accordingly and is provided with this submission. 
Assessment of MAH’s response: 
Section 3.2.P.3.3 Description of Manufacturing Process and Process Controls {Catalent – mRNA-
1273.214} has been revised as requested. 
Conclusion: Issue solved. 
35. In section P.3.3.it is stated for the optional interim storage step that the thaw duration is qualified 
during process qualification. The thaw durations should be updated in the dossier for all sites. In 
addition, the maximum interims storage time should be indicated in the process description for all 
sites. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The vial thaw durations have been qualified and were summarised. The corresponding process description 
are provided for all sites in the corresponding 3.2.P.3.3 sections. 
Conclusion.  
The CHMP requests an update to relevant dossier sections to further define vial thaw durations.  Issue not 
solved.  
MAH’s 2nd response:

assigned maximum duration of 6 months interim storage is detailed in section 3.2.P.3.3.2.12 “Vial 
Interim Storage”. 
Assessment of the MAH’s 2nd response: The MAH defined the maximum duration of interim hold time 
and provided the updated documents. 
Conclusion: Issue solved. 
Process validation: 
36. Three consecutive PPQ lots have been manufactured at Catalent vial line 3 according to the 
modified process. The MAH should clarify whether other lines are also intended to manufacture 
the bivalent vaccine. 
Summary of MAH’s response 
The MAH confirms that qualification data will be provided to support Catalent Line 1 and Flexible filler line 
before manufacturing of the bivalent vaccine on these lines.  
Assessment of MAH’s response: 
The MAH has confirmed that qualification data will be provided to support Catalent Line 1 and Flexible 
filler line before manufacturing of the bivalent vaccine on these lines. 
Conclusion: Issue solved. 
37. In section 3.2.P.3.5 Process Validation and/or Evaluation {Rovi-Variant}, Table 7 shows not “Total 
Reject Rate (%)” as indicated, but the absolute number of rejected vials. This should be 
corrected. 
Summary of MAH’s response 
The MAH confirms that Table 7 in Section 3.2.P.3.5 {mRNA-1273.214 DP – Rovi SSRR} present the actual 
count of vials rejected and not the % as stated in the column header. The updated Table is provided 
below. The corrected Section is provided with this submission. 
Assessment of MAH’s response: 
The table has been corrected. 
Conclusion: Issue solved. 
38. The final PPQ reports for all DP manufacturing sites should be provided when available. 
Summary of MAH’s response: 
The final PPQ reports covering complete manufacturing operations up to the Labelled Drug Product /LDP) 
step at each site are made available. 
Assessment of MAH’s response: 
PPQ reports have been provided for Rovi and Monza. The final PPQ reports for Catalent and Recipharm 
will be provide in September and October 2022.

Conclusion: Issue solved. Outstanding PPQ reports will be provided in September and October 2022 
(REC6). 
39. In contrast to the other DP manufacturing sites, at Recipharm only one lot has been included in a 
dilution mixing study that demonstrates similar pH, osmolality and mRNA content at the bottom, 
middle and top of the vessel after specific mixing times. Since the mixing procedure has been 
changed at Recipharm, control of homogeneity including mRNA-LNP ratio would have been 
expected for all three PPQ lots. Although homogeneity is further shown by analysing the ratio of 
the two different mRNA-LNPs during begin, middle and end of filling and inspection for all PPQ 
batches, further proof of homogeneity after mixing should be provided. 
Summary of MAH’s response: 
In the mRNA-1273.214 DP process validation, no mixing was intended on the pooled LNPs prior to 
dilution step for mRNA-1273.214 process. Mixing was performed only after dilution, using same mixing 
speed and mixing duration as for the mRNA-1273 process already validated for the 0.20 mg/mL product 
(Section 3.2.P.3.3). 
In Recipharm, Monts, pooling, dilution and mixing of mRNA-1273.214 DP solution can be performed in 
one of the four equivalent (1000-L) vessels. During this PPQ campaign, a mixing homogeneity study was 
performed with sampling from top, middle and bottom of vessel during compounding of PPQ batch 
223033 using a specified vessel to confirm and demonstrate the mixing homogeneity which was 
previously validated. This was limited to one batch to restrict open-vessel interventions required for 
sampling which adds significant bioburden risk to the compounded solution. 
Furthermore, homogeneity of the diluted solution after mixing is supported using the RNA ratio results 
from the PPQ characterisation sample “23-PPQ” and RNA content results from PPQ characterisation 
sample “22-PPQ”. 
These results will be included in the final PPQ report. 
The additional results summarised above, in combination with the earlier conducted mixing homogeneity 
study, confirm the ability to achieve a homogeneous bulk after dilution using the parameters listed in 
Table 8, Section 3.2.P.3.3 {mRNA-1273.214 - Recipharm}. 
Assessment of MAH’s response: 
The MAH is of the opinion that including only 1 batch in the mixing study at Recipharm was sufficient 
because the aim was to confirm and demonstrate the mixing homogeneity which was previously 
validated. This is not fully agreed since the mixing procedure has been changed and the LNP pooling 
mixing step has been omitted. However, the MAH provides further data to demonstrate homogeneity 
after the dilution step. This data supports homogeneity however, samples have not been taken from 
different places of the mixing vessel. Nevertheless, taken into account the data from samples taken at 
begin, middle and end of filling, this is accepted. 
Conclusion: Issue solved. 
40. During process validation at Monza, an OOS result for filling homogeneity was observed. This 
deviation was caused by a non-correct installation of the filter housing. In the report, it is stated 
that other parameters were in the expected range, only mRNA content at different filling stages 
was affected. Since homogeneity is not routinely analysed, the MAH should clarify how it can be 
excluded that non-correct filter installation leads to an unnoticed inhomogeneity of mRNA content 
during filling. 
Assessment report  
EMA/896245/2022 
Page 52/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Summary of MAH’s response 
The MAH wants to clarify that the filling homogeneity results were not OOS against release acceptance 
criterion for RNA content. During process validation at TFS, Monza, a bulk homogeneity study was 
performed on the final bulk solution in order to demonstrate homogeneity of the dispersion throughout 
the compounding tank. Samples were collected from top, middle and bottom of the compounding tank 
after mixing and demonstrated adequacy of the mixing speed and duration. 
However, during demonstration of Filling Homogeneity on batch MV10001/1, results out of the CMO 
internal equivalency critierion were obtained for the total RNA content for the End samples. An 
investigation was initiated and concluded that these results could be linked to incorrect assembly of the 
filters in the sterile filtration line. The MAH provided information on the RNA content and the CAPAs 
defined to prevent non correct installations of machinery. 
The operational result of the incorrect assembly was an increase of the pressure on the sterilisation filter. 
The incorrectly assembled filter caused reversal of flow (outlet to inlet) in the filter. This led to a rapid 
increase in filtration pressure. However, it must be noted that the controls installed to detect the increase 
in pressure functioned as intended and the filtration pressure alarm limit (1.3 bar) was not exceeded. The 
(differential) filtration pressure is monitored continuously during the manufacturing operations. Pressure 
transmitters, connected to the SCADA system, are installed on the stainless-steel line upstream and 
downstream of each sterilising filter with alarms. An excursion beyond the filtration pressure acceptance 
criteria would lead to a stop of the operations and a filter change-out. 
Thus, the CAPAs already implemented along with the active pressure monitoring system significantly 
reduces the risk for this failure mode for inhomogeneity or for it to go undetected during routine 
operations. 
Assessment of MAH’s response: 
The implemented CAPAs to reduce the risk of incorrect filter installation are deemed sufficient. 
Conclusion: Issue solved. 
Control of drug product:  
41. The MAH should clarify whether the RNA ratio method is specific to intact RNA or whether RNA 
fragments or adducts will also contribute to the result. In the latter case, it should be justified 
how an equal amount of functional RNA can be ensured when mRNA-LNPs with different purities 
are used for formulation of the DP. 
Summary of the MAH responses to outstanding issue: 
The MAH clarifies that the RNA ratio is determined based on total RNA, including intact mRNA, RNA 
fragments and RNA lipid adducts, this is consistent with total RNA content determination. The level of 
RNA fragments and RNA lipid adducts are controlled at release for each mRNA-LNP used in the 
manufacture of the mRNA-1273.214 DP. 
The proportion of intact RNA for the mRNA-LNPs components might be slightly different depending on 
their individual purities at release, but the rate of purity loss is expected to be similar for each 
component. The ratio of functional RNAs in the DP is not guaranteed to be identical for all components, 
but will be limited to a relatively narrow range by the in-process controls on Weight of LNPs pooled, the 
LNP incoming release purity, the similarity of purity loss rates per component, as well as the 
specifications on (Total) RNA Ratio in the final product. 
Additionally, the MAH has performed the following assessment of the mRNA release purity from 728 
mRNA-1273 LNP commercial batches across three manufacturing sites (Moderna Norwood, MA, Lonza 
Assessment report  
EMA/896245/2022 
Page 53/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Portsmouth, NH, and Lonza Visp, Switzerland) to determine the process capability of each site as well as 
understand site-to-site differences. A statistical summary is provided in Table 1. The results 
demonstrate a high degree of consistency for purity across the manufacturing history, further 
supporting the conclusion above.  
Assessment of responses to outstanding issue: 
The MAH clarified that RNA ratio determination is based on total RNA but argues that because of the 
high consistency of the purity of batches produced only slight differences will occur.  
The question is resolved. 
42. The dossier should be updated with final DP batch analysis results and the final CoA for the PPQ 
lots from the four DP manufacturing sites should be provided when the complete data is available. 
Summary of MAH’s response 
Already addressed in response to Q27. 
The question is resolved. 
43. In section 3.2.P.5.5 Characterisation of Impurities {mRNA 1273.214-Patheon (Monza)}, the MAH 
refers to “Section 3.2.P.3.5 {mRNA 1273.214 – Patheon (Monza)} – Ext-0820)” regarding sterile 
filter leachables. However, leachables are not addressed in this section/report. The MAH should 
provide the relevant information for sterile filter leachables including a risk assessment for the 
unknown esters. 
Summary of the MAH responses to outstanding issue: 
The MAH notes that the filter extractables and their toxicology assessment was provided in Section 
3.2.P.5.5 – Patheon (Monza). However, EXT-0820 was incorrectly referred to for filter leachables. An 
updated section 3.2.P.5.5 Characterisation of Impurities {mRNA-1273.214-Patheon (Monza)} is 
provided without the incorrect cross-reference raising confusion (See revised section 3.2.P.5.5.1). 
As noted in the P.5.5 section, a formal Toxicology assessment of unknown esters is not possible when 
the structure as well as concentration is not known. These structures (= extractables) were detected in 
an extraction study under worst-case conditions. The amounts of any such substances appearing as 
leachables is expected to be lower in practice. 
The Sartorius Sartopore 2 XLG filters are commonly used for manufacture of parenteral products. In 
light of their usage for large batch sizes and for a product dosed in small volumes over a limited number 
of doses, the filters are considered suitable for use. 
Assessment of responses to outstanding issue: 
The MAH stated that the cross-reference was removed. However, it is still included in section 
3.2.P.5.5.1.3.1.2 in the provided document. Therefore, the MAH is asked again to provide the report of 
the leachable study conducted by Sartorius Validation Services. The explanation concerning the 
unknown esters is acceptable.  
The question is not resolved. 
Summary of the MAH 2nd responses to outstanding issue: The MAH acknowledges the comment. 
The report is provided in attachment to this response.

Assessment of 2nd responses to outstanding issue: The MAH provided the requested document. 
However, the section 3.2.P.5.5 should be resubmitted with the correct cross-reference to this report in 
section 3.2.P.5.5.1.3.1.2 with the closing sequence. 
The question resolved with recommendation (REC7). 
44. The programme for annual requalification of PRM/WRM lot D009222001 should be provided and 
Section 3.2.P.6 updated accordingly 
Summary of the MAH responses to outstanding issue: 
The primary/working reference material (PRM/WRM) lot D00922001 will be requalified annually as per 
internal SOP. Section 3.2.P.6 Reference Standards {mRNA 1273.214} has been updated accordingly; 
see section 3.2.P.6, Page 2, last paragraph. 
Assessment of responses to outstanding issue: 
The MAH provided the updated document. 
The question is resolved. 
Stability: 
45. As stated in the CHMP scientific advice from July 2022, the reduction to only one single stability 
verification batch will only be acceptable when enough data from several batches is available that 
demonstrates that number and sequence of RNAs has no influence on stability. In section 
3.2.P.8.1 Stability Summary and Conclusion {mRNA-1273.214}, the MAH states that “Stability 
studies representing similarly formulated lots of mRNA-1273, mRNA-1273.211 and mRNA 
1273.351 are available for comparison” and indeed stability data is provided for such lots in 
3.2.P.8.3. However, no RNA degradation slopes are presented for these lots, so it is unclear how 
this data should justify comparable stability behaviour of the variant vaccines. In addition, there 
is no information provided for the variants: strain, RNA length, concentration, etc. is unknown. 
The MAH should provide more information on the variant vaccine DP lots used for demonstrating 
comparable stability and present the RNA degradation slopes in comparison to the slopes 
calculated for the prototype vaccine. 
Summary of the MAH responses to outstanding issue: 
Please find attached the updated stability report DPAD-00880 version 5.0 which integrates the latest 
stability data available for the calculation of the RNA degradation rates. The similarity of RNA 
degradation slopes was assessed in this updated comprehensive evaluation using all stability study 
results available for Drug Product as of May 25, 2022. 81 development and GMP lots were studied at six 
different storage temperatures, although not all lots were studied at all six temperatures.  
Assessment of responses to outstanding issue: 
The MAH provided an updated stability report including RNA degradation slopes. However, no further 
data on the variants used as supportive data was provided. 
The question is not resolved.

Summary of the MAH 2nd responses to outstanding issue: Supportive data from stability studies for 
development and clinical lots mRNA-1273.214 are described in Sections 3.2.P.8.1 and 3.2.P.8.3; 
development and clinical stability data from additional mRNA-1273 variant vaccines are also provided, 
including: mRNA-1273.351 (Beta), mRNA-1273.617.2 (Delta), mRNA-1273.529 (Omicron BA.1), mRNA-
1273.211 (Prototype + Beta), and mRNA-1273.213 (Beta + Delta). These bracket mRNA-1273 RNA 
sequence lengths between 4092 and 4101 nucleotides and concentrations between 0.1 and 0.5 mg/mL.  
Assessment of 2nd responses to outstanding issue: The MAH provided the requested information. 
The question is resolved. 
46. It was stated in the CHMP scientific advice from July 2022 that “the MAH’s proposal to assign the 
shelf-life claims from the prototype mRNA 1273 vaccine to mRNA-1273 associated variant 
vaccines might be acceptable provided that accelerated data is available that confirms 
comparable stability behaviour.” For one PPQ lot from Catalent, stability data at 25°C is available. 
In addition, for a developmental mRNA-1273.214 Drug Product Lot (DHM-82829) stability data at 
5°C and 25°C is provided. However, these results have not been used for calculating RNA 
degradation slopes, so no conclusion on comparability is possible. The MAH should demonstrate 
that the RNA degradation rates at accelerated temperature for the mRNA-1273.214 Drug Product 
lots are comparable to the prototype degradation rates to support the proposed shelf life. 
Summary of the MAH responses to outstanding issue:

48. The stability model uses RNA purity as a measure of DP stability. The method for measuring RNA 
purity has been changed and it has been noted that the results for DP samples are about 5% 
higher when the new method is used (see assessment of the introduction of the new method for 
determination of RNA impurity). Therefore, calculation of degradation slopes should be based only 
on values obtained from one of the methods, not from mixed results. The MAH should confirm 
that this is the case. 
Summary of the MAH responses to outstanding issue: 
The purity method employed to obtain each result used in stability modelling is tracked and accounted 
for in the calculation of degradation slopes. Purity results for most stability studies have been obtained 
with only the original method (SOP-0996) or only the new method (SOP-1142), and these degradation 
slopes are based only on values obtained from one of the methods. However, there are a limited 
number of stability studies with early time points obtained using the original purity method, and later 
time points obtained using the new method. 
In order to evaluate all available data, instead of omitting results obtained with mixed methods, two 
approaches are used to account for the different purity methods: 
- First, degradation rates (slopes) obtained with the two methods are compared using an Analysis of 
Covariance (ANCOVA) statistical model to assess for poolability of slopes across purity methods. 
- Second, when results from the two methods are included in a unified overall model, additional terms 
are added to the ANCOVA model to assess the potential difference in initial purity due to method and 
the potential difference in purity slope due to method.  
This modelling approach permits an overall assessment using all available data, rather than excluding 
some results because of the method improvement introduced during certain stability studies. 
Assessment of responses to outstanding issue: 
The MAH explained that additional terms to the statistical model were introduced to account for the 
different purity methods used. 
The question is resolved. 
General issues: 
49. Removal of reference to SOP numbers in the specifications is not acceptable. These references 
should be re-established for all components of Spikevax.

4.  Non-clinical aspects 
4.1.  Pharmacology 
4.1.1.  Brief summary 
mRNA-1273 encodes the S protein of the Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate of SARS-CoV-2, whereas mRNA-1273.529 
encodes the S protein of the SARS-CoV-2 BA.1 variant (Omicron). In addition, both vaccines include two 
proline mutations to stabilise the S protein into the pre-fusion conformation (S2P). Non-clinical bivalent 
mRNA-1273.214 was a 1:1 bench side mix of mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.529. 
All vaccines were formulated into a mixture of four lipids: SM
102, cholesterol, DSPC and PEG2000
DMG.  
The MAH conducted four non-GLP compliant primary pharmacodynamics studies to demonstrate the 
‑
‑
immunogenicity and efficacy of mRNA-1273, mRNA-1273.529 and mRNA-1273.214. Three of these 
studies were conducted in mice and one study were conducted in non-human primates (NHPs). In all 
studies, the vaccines were administered intramuscularly (IM), which is the intended administration route 
in human. 
The preclinical mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.529 drug products used in these studies were mRNA 
formulations prepared with the same method as the Good Manufacturing Practice mRNA-1273 and mRNA-
1273.529 clinical drug products. 
4.1.2.  Primary pharmacodynamics 
Study MOD-5019: Evaluation of Immunogenicity and Antigen-Reactive B Cell Responses of 
Omicron-Matched mRNA Vaccine Boosters in Mice 
Study design: 
The immunogenicity and antigen-reactive B cell responses of mRNA-1273, mRNA-1273.529 and mRNA-
1273.214 were analysed. Eight female BALB/c mice per group were administered intramuscularly with 
three or four mRNA vaccine doses. 
Animals of the 3-dose regimen (group 1-4) were administered 0.25 µg mRNA-1273 on Day 1 and Day 22. 
At Day 50, these mice were boosted with 0.25 µg of mRNA-1273, mRNA-1273.529, or mRNA-1273.214. 
Animals who received the 4-dose regimen (group 5-8) were administered 0.25 µg mRNA-1273 on Day 1 
and Day 22. At Day 50 and Day 78, these mice were boosted with 0.25 µg of mRNA-1273 or mRNA-
1273.529. Mice boosted with mRNA-1273.214 were not included in the 4-dose regimen part of this study. 
Animals of Groups 1 (3 dose-regimen) and 5 (4 dose regimen) received phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 
control article on the same dosing schedule as the active groups.

Table 1: Study Design for Study MOD-5019 
To analyse the vaccine immunogenicity, blood was collected from all animals on Day 21 (before Dose 2), 
Day 36 (2 weeks after Dose 2), and Day 49 (before Dose 3). Blood was also collected from animals of the 
3-dose regimen on Day 64 (2 weeks after Dose 3) and from animals of the 4-dose regimen on Day 93 (2 
weeks after Dose 4).  
Serum samples were analysed for stabilised Wuhan-Hu-1 spike protein-specific (S-2P) or BA.1 spike 
protein-specific (S-2P.529) IgG antibody responses via an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).  
Neutralising antibody responses against Wuhan-Hu-1 spike-protein (D614G), BA.1 spike protein and BA.2 
spike protein were analysed by a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based pseudovirus neutralisation 
(PSVN) assay. 
Mice who received the 3-dose regimen were euthanised on Day 64, and mice who received the 4-dose 
regimen were euthanised on Day 93. Spleen and lymph nodes of the study animals were harvested for 
antigen-reactive B cell analysis.  
Results of the 3-dose regime: 
Figure 1: Binding Antibody Responses in BALB/c Mice After Dose 3 
One dose of mRNA-1273 induced low Spike protein (SP)-specific IgG antibody titres in most mice (96 - 
644 GMT). The SP-specific IgG antibody titres increased after a second dose of mRNA-1273 and SP-
specific antibody responses could be detected in all mRNA-1273 vaccinated animals (9132 - 19479 GMT).  
Assessment report  
EMA/896245/2022 
Page 61/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2 weeks after a booster dose of mRNA-1273 (group 2), the SP-specific IgG antibody titre increased even 
more (43817 GMT). Minimal higher GMT of SP-specific IgG antibodies were detected 2 weeks after a 
booster dose of mRNA-1273.529 (group 3, 53846 GMT) and mRNA-1273.214 (group 4, 92445 GMT). 
However, it has to be considered that the SP-specific IgG antibody titres after the primary vaccine series 
with mRNA-1273 were already higher in group 3 and 4 than in group 2 mice. 
In a S-2P.529-specific ELISA, Omicron spike protein (S-2P 529)-specific IgG antibody responses did not 
differ remarkably in animals boosted with mRNA-1273 (4857 GMT), mRNA-1273.529 (15620 GMT) or 
mRNA-1273.214 (16697 GMT). The different boosters induced an S2P.529-specific IgG antibody titre 
slightly low than for Wuhan Spike-specific IgG antibodies. Similar to the Wuhan Spike protein titres, the 
GMT were higher in mice boosted with one of the both BA.1 specific vaccine candidates compared to 
mice, which were boosted with mRNA-1273. Also for these results, the already higher Wuhan SP IgG 
antibody titre in group 3 and 4 mice might have an impact on the Omicron-specific IgG antibody titre.

On Day 49 after two mRNA-1273 doses, all animals showed S-2P Wuhan-Hu-1-specific neutralising 
antibody titre at an infection dose (ID50) of 635 GMT. At this time point, before the booster vaccination, 
the BA.1 and BA.2 specific neutralising antibodies were below the quantification limit (LLOQ).  
Figure 3: Neutralizing Antibody Responses in BALB/c Mike Before Dose 3 
After a booster (3rd) dose with mRNA-1273, mice showed an increased Wuhan S-2P specific neutralising 
antibody titre (2385 GMT) but only very low neutralising antibody titres against BA.1 (30 GMT) and BA.2 
(62 GMT), which were below and shortly above the LLOQ, respectively. Animals boosted with mRNA-
1273.529 showed increased Wuhan S-2P specific neutralising antibody titre (855 GMT) compared to mice 
of the primary vaccine regime (2x mRNA-1273), but the titre was slightly lower than for the mRNA-1273 
boosted mice. Furthermore, the neutralising antibody titre against BA.1 was only slightly higher (70 GMT) 
and against BA.2 was similar (64 GMT) as compared to mRNA-1273 boosted animals. Animals boosted 
with mRNA-1273.214 showed increased Wuhan S-2P neutralising antibody (4459 GMT), which were 
higher than in mRNA-1273-boosted mice, and higher titres of neutralising antibodies against BA.1 (154 
GMT) and BA.2 (157 GMT).  
Overall, the neutralising antibody titres against BA.1 and BA.2 were still very low in Omicron-specific 
vaccine boosted mice.

Figure 4: Frequencies of S-2P and S-P.529 and Cross-Reactive (WT+.529+) B Cells in Iliac Lymph Nodes 
in Mice 2 Weeks After Boost (Dose 3) With mRNA-1273 or BA.1-Matched mRNA Vaccines 
2 weeks post-dose on Day 64, spike protein antigen-specific B cell responses were observed in iliac lymph 
nodes of mice boosted with mRNA-1273, mRNA-1273.529 or mRNA-1273.214. For this study, pooled 
lymph nodes were analysed. The frequencies of antigen-reactive B cells are expressed as a percentage of 
all IgD- and IgM- class-switched B cells.  
Similar high frequencies of Wuhan-Hu-1 S-2P D6146G-specific B cells were observed in all three booster 
groups. Similar, but lower frequencies of cross-reactive B cells were also observed in all three booster 
groups.  
Omicron-matched S-2P.529-specific B cell frequencies were detected in iliac lymph nodes of mice boosted 
with mRNA-1273.529 or mRNA-1273.214 (3.04% and 4.48%, respectively) but were not observed in 
mice boosted with mRNA-1273 (0.052%). It has to be noted, that the detected S-2P.529-specific B-cell 
frequencies were significantly lower than the Wuhan-specific B-cell frequencies in mRNA-1273.529 and

mRNA-1273.214 boosted mice. Furthermore, high frequencies of cross-reactive B cells were observed in 
all 3 booster groups. Especially, mRNA-1273.214 boosted mice showed significant high cross-reactive B-
cells (mRNA-1273: 3.18%, mRNA-1273.529: 4.61%, mRNA-1273.214: 7.79%).

Spleens were processed by individual mouse and isolated cells were probed with recombinant Wuhan S-
2P and Omicron S-2P.529 proteins. The frequencies of antigen-reactive B cells are expressed as a 
percentage of all IgD- and IgM-class-switched B cells.

In the spleen, minimal Wuhan and Omicron-matched S2P antigen-specific B cell responses were observed 
across all groups (<1%). In addition, cross-reactive B-cells frequencies were also very low across all 
groups (<0.5%). These results indicate that antigen-reactive B cells were not in the systemic circulation. 
The MAH explains that this result is likely due to the low dose of mRNA vaccine. 
Results of the four dose regime: 
Figure 6: Binding Antibody Responses in BALB/c Mice After Dose 4 
High IgG binding antibody titres against Wuhan S-2P and Omicron S-2P.529 proteins were detected after 
a 2-dose primary series with mRNA-1273 and 1x and 2x boosting with mRNA-1273 or mRNA-1273.529 
compared to PBS control.  
4 weeks after the first booster (Day 77), mRNA-1273 or mRNA-1273.529 induced an increased Wuhan 
S2P-specific IgG antibody response compared to GMTs after the 2nd vaccine dose (Day 36). Overall, the 
GMTs of all vaccine groups were similar. Furthermore, a notable increase in Wuhan S-2P IgG GMTs were 
not noted after the 4th dose (Day 93) across all booster groups, which might be due to the high levels of 
pre-existing immunity in these mice at this time point according to the MAH. 
Assessment report  
EMA/896245/2022

Similar results were observed for Omicron S2P.529-specific IgG binding antibody titre. The GMT for 
Omicron S2P.529-specific IgG binding antibody were slightly lower than the GMT for Wuhan S2P-specific 
IgG binding antibody across all groups. In general, a 4th vaccine dose did not increase the GMT compared 
to a 3rd vaccine dose. However, it has to be noted that the Omicron S2P-specific GMT was higher in mice 
boosted with 2x mRNA-1273.529 (14311 GMT) than in mice boosted with 2x mRNA-1273 (7304 GMT) 
and 1x mRNA-1273 + 1x mRNA-1273.529 (6314 GMT). Nevertheless, it should be also considered that 
the GMT after the primary vaccine series was higher in group 6 animals (2x mRNA-1273.529) than in 
group 7 (2x mRNA-1273) and 8 animals (1x mRNA-1273 + 1x mRNA-1273). 
mRNA-1273.214 as a booster was not analysed in this 4-dose vaccine regime study. 
Figure 7: Neutralizing Antibody Responses in BALB/c Mice After Dose 4 
2 weeks after the 4th dose, the D614G neutralising antibody response was increased in 4x mRNA-1273 
(5387 GMT) vaccinated mice compared to 2x or 3x mRNA-1273 vaccinated mice. In addition, the BA.1 
and BA.2 neutralising antibody responses were also slightly increased (73 and 120 GMT) compared to the 
Assessment report  
EMA/896245/2022

2x and 3x dose neutralising antibody titres. Nevertheless, the BA.1 and BA.2 neutralising antibody titres 
in 4x mRNA-1273 vaccinated mice were still very low. 
In mice boosted 2x with mRNA-1273.529, the D614G neutralising antibody response (1177 GMT) was 
only minimal increased compared to the neutralising titres post-2nd and post-3rd dose, and was slightly 
lower than for 4x mRNA-1273 vaccinated mice. In contrast, BA.1 and BA.2 neutralising antibody titres 
were significantly increased after the 2nd mRNA-1273.529 booster dose (1761 GMT and 935 GMT) and 
reached comparable high titres than for D614G in this group. The MAH suggested that the Omicron-
specific memory B cells measured after the first booster dose of mRNA-1273.529 responded to the 
second booster dose of mRNA-1273.529, resulting in a significant increase in neutralising antibodies 
against BA.1 and BA.2. 
In mice boosted 1x with mRNA-1273.529, the D614G neutralising antibody response (2134 GMT) was 
similar high than post-3x mRNA-1273. BA.1 and BA.2 neutralising antibody titres were increased after the 
4th dose with mRNA-1273.529 boost (140 GMT and 123 GMT) and showed similar high levels. 
Nevertheless, the Omicron-specific neutralising antibody titres in this group were still low and significantly 
smaller than in the mice boosted 2x with mRNA-1273.529. 
In the study report, the MAH mentioned that the antigen-reactive B cell responses on Day 93 (after 4 
doses) were similar to those on Day 64 (after 3 doses). Thus, Day 93 results were not submitted with this 
study data. 
The MAH concluded that a single Omicron-matched booster (Dose 3) might be not enough to increase 
significantly Omicron-specific neutralisation antibody titres. However, it is driving the production of 
Omicron antigen-reactive B cells, which would be available to respond rapidly to subsequent vaccination 
with mRNA-1273.529. This was observed by the significantly increase in BA.1 and BA.2 neutralisation 
antibody titres after a second booster dose with mRNA-1273.529. 
CHMP comment 
3-dose regime:  
One booster of Omicron-specific SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, monovalent mRNA-1273.529 and bivalent mRNA-
1273.214, induced similar high Wuhan 1 and BA.1 SP-specific IgG antibody titres. Mice vaccinated with 
2x mRNA-1273 and boosted 1x with mRNA-1273.214 showed the highest neutralising antibody titres 
against Wuhan-1, BA.1 and BA.2 SARS-CoV-2 variants compared to booster with mRNA-1273.529 or 
mRNA-1273. However, the neutralising antibody titres against BA.1 and BA.2 were relative low after 1 
booster dose, even for Omicron specific vaccines. mRNA-1273.529 and mRNA-1273.214 induced antigen-
reactive B cells to S-2P.529 in the draining lymph nodes, while boosting with mRNA-1273 did not. All 3 
vaccines show antigen-reactive B-cells to Wuhan S-2P and cross-reactive B-cells in lymph nodes. 
However, minimal antigen-specific B cell responses (< 1%) were observed across all groups in spleen.  
4-dose regime: 
The Wuhan-1 and BA.1 SP-specific IgG antibody titre showed similar levels after the 4th vaccine dose than 
after the 3rd dose in all vaccine groups. Neutralising antibody titres against BA.1 and BA.2 were 
significantly increased after 2x booster doses of mRNA-1273.529. 1 booster dose of mRNA-1273.529 
showed only little increase of neutralising antibody titre compared to 4x mRNA-1273. In addition, 
neutralising antibody titre against Wuhan-1 SP did not remarkably changed after 4th dose and was similar 
than after 3rd dose. The B-cell response after 4th dose data were not shown. The MAH mentioned that 
data are similar than after 3rd dose 
Assessment report

In general, the Omicron-specific IgG binding antibody titre was slightly lower than the Wuhan-specific 
titre in all vaccine groups. Furthermore, one booster dose with a Omicron-matched vaccine (mRNA-
1273.529 or mRNA-1273.214) induce high IgG titres against the Wuhan and Omicron spike protein, but 
they were not significant higher compared to the parent vaccine mRNA-1273. Furthermore, the Omicron-
specific neutralising titres were relative low in the Omicron-matched vaccine boostered mice. However, a 
2nd booster dose with mRNA-1273.529 induced high neutralising antibodies against BA.1 and BA.2. These 
data suggest, that similar results are expected for a 2nd booster dose of mRNA-1273.214. However, this 
vaccine variant was not tested for a 4-dose regime. In addition, one booster with an Omicron-matched 
vaccine induced memory B-cells in lymph nodes against Wuhan and Omicron, as well as cross-reactive B-
cells.

Serum samples were collected from all animals before the 2nd Dose (Day 21) and 2 weeks after the 2nd 
Dose (Day 36). Spike protein-specific IgG antibody titres were analysed by ELISA and neutralisation

Figure 8: Binding Antibody Responses in BALB/c Mice After Primary Series 
Similar mean Wuhan-1 S2P-specific IgG antibody titres were measured for all three mRNA vaccines, 3 
weeks after the 1st vaccine dose. However, two animals of the mRNA-1277.529 group showed only low 
S2P-specific IgG titre at the quantification limit. A 2nd dose of one of these three vaccines enhanced the 
IgG antibody response and all three vaccines reached similar high titres (7679 – 10416 GMT).  
After the 1st vaccine dose, Omicron-matched S2P.529-specific IgG antibody titre was under the 
quantification level in almost all animals in all groups. A 2nd vaccine dose increased remarkably the 
S2P.529-specific IgG antibody responses in all vaccinated animals (1076 – 4388 GMT). The mRNA-
1273.529 vaccinated mice showed a slightly higher titre (4388 GMT) than the mice of the other two 
groups.  
Overall, the S2P.529-specific IgG antibody titres were slightly lower than S2P-specific IgG antibody titres 
after the 2nd vaccine dose in all groups.

Figure 9: Neutralizing Antibody Responses in BALB/c Mice After Primary Series (Day 36) 
2 weeks after the second dose, the GMT of serum neutralising antibody responses against Wuhan D614G 
were significantly higher in mRNA-1273 vaccinated mice (7035 GMT) compared with mRNA-1273.529 (40 
GMT) or mRNA-1273.214 (1452) vaccinated mice. Nevertheless, mRNA-1273.214 showed robust 
neutralisation antibody response against Wuhan D614G.  
As expected, serum neutralising antibody responses against BA.1 or BA.2 were higher in mice vaccinated 
mRNA-1273.529 (1146 and 269 GMT) or mRNA-1273.214 (915 and 410 GMT) compared with mRNA-
1273 (87 and 66 GMT). Overall, mRNA-1273.214 provided the widest neutralisation coverage across the 
evaluated SARS-CoV-2 variants. 
CHMP comment 
Two primary doses of mRNA-1273, mRNA-1273.529 or mRNA-1273.214 induce robust Wuhan-1 and 
Omicron SP-specific IgG antibody titres in mice. However, the IgG antibody titres against Omicron SP 
were lower than Wuhan-1 SP-specific IgG titre for all three vaccines. 
As expected, two doses of mRNA-1273 vaccine induced high neutralising antibody titre against Wuhan-1 
spike protein, but only very low BA.1- and BA.2-specific titres. mRNA-1273.529 vaccine showed robust 
titre for BA.1 and BA.2 but only low for Wuhan. mRNA-1273.214 vaccine showed high titre for Wuhan, 
BA.1 and BA.2. 
N-terminal domain- and RBD-specific antibody titres were not analysed in this study. 
Together with the data of study MOD-5019 (Omicron-matched booster), these data show that one dose of 
mRNA-1273.529 or mRNA-1273.214 might be not sufficient to induce robust neutralising antibody

responses against Omicron variants BA.1 and BA.2. Nevertheless, immunogenicity data obtained from 
mice cannot be translated directly to human. 
Study WASHU-01-MOD-5020: 
The immunogenicity and protection against viral challenge was evaluated for different dose 
concentrations of mRNA-1273 and BA.1-matched booster vaccines. 
The test articles in this study were 0.1 μg, 0.25 μg, 1 μg, or 5 μg of mRNA-1273, and 0.1 μg or 1 μg 
mRNA-1273.529 administered as a 2-dose primary series regimen (with or without a boost of mRNA-
1273, mRNA-1273.529, control mRNA, or PBS). A non-translating mRNA (0.1 μg, 0.25 μg, or 5 μg control 
mRNA [UNFIX-01]) or PBS was used as a negative control. 
WASHU-K18MOD7AB (cohort 1) and WASHU-K18MOD3/4 (cohort 2) studies 
Study design 
In cohort 1, seven weeks old K18-hACE2 female mice were injected with 2 intramuscular doses of 0.1 µg 
or 5 µg mRNA-1273 or non-translating mRNA-control 3 weeks apart. Blood was collected on Day 42 to 
measure the IgG antibody responses against Wuhan-1 and BA.1-speific Spike and RBD by ELISA and 
neutralising antibodies were measured by FRNT. Five weeks after the second dose, mice were challenged 
intranasally with 104 FFU of Wuhan-1 D614G or BA.1 SARS-CoV-2 variants. 6 days post-infection, mice 
were sacrificed and nasal wash, nasal turbinates and lung samples were harvested for virological, 
immunological, and pathological analysis. 
In cohort 2, the effects of an mRNA-1273 booster dose on antibody responses and protection against 
BA.1 was evaluated in 7-week old K18-hACE2 female mice. The mice received 2 IM injections of 0.25 µg 
or 5 µg mRNA-1273 or mRNA-control 3 weeks apart (primary series). 17 to 19 weeks after the second 
dose, mice were boosted with 1 µg mRNA-1273 or mRNA-control. Blood samples were collected before 
the boost dose and at 4 weeks post-boost dose (before challenge), and samples were analysed for serum 
neutralising antibodies by FRNT. Four weeks after the boost dose, mice were challenged intranasally with 
104 FFU of BA.1. 6 days post-infection, mice were euthanised and tissues (nasal wash, nasal turbinates, 
and lung) were harvested for virological analysis.

Results 
Figure 10: Antibody Responses of mRNA Vaccines in K18-hACE2 Mice 
In cohort 1 K18-hACE2 mice, two doses of mRNA-1273 vaccine induced high Wuhan-1 and BA.1 Spike- 
and RBD-specific binding IgG antibody responses. mRNA-1273 showed dose-dependent increase of serum 
IgG antibody titres. In the 0.1 µg mRNA-1273 group, the IgG titres were about 10-fold lower than those 
in the 5 µg mRNA-1273 group. In both mRNA-1273 dose groups, the Wuhan-1 S- and RBD-specific IgG 
titres were higher than those observed against BA.1. In addition, serum neutralising antibody responses 
against both Wuhan-1 D614G and BA.1 could be detected after two doses of 5 µg mRNA-1273. For mice 
that received 0.1 µg of mRNA-1273, only moderate high neutralising antibody titres against Wuhan-1 
D614G were observed. Neutralising antibody titre against BA.1 were very low and similar to control mRNA 
mice. Overall, the serum neutralising activity against BA.1 was lower in both mRNA-1273 dose groups 
when compared with Wuhan-1 D614G-specific neutralising antibody titres.

Figure 11: Protection Against SARS-CoV-2 Infection After mRNA Vaccination in K18-hACE2 Mice 
Five weeks after the completion of the primary vaccination series with 0.1 µg or 5 µg mRNA-1273, mice 
were challenged with 104 FFU Wuhan-1 D614G or BA.1. 6 days post infection, no weight loss was 
observed in 0.1 µg or 5 µg mRNA-1273 group mice. However, also the BA.1 challenged control mice did 
not reduced their body weight. Overall, 6 days post-infection, the control mice showed also lower viral 
load after BA.1 challenge than after Wuhan-1 D614G challenge, indicating a lower infection character of 
BA.1 in mice. The nasal washes, nasal turbinates and lung of 5 µg mRNA-1273-vaccinated mice showed 
significantly reduced viral load of Wuhan-1 D614G and BA.1. The 0.1 µg mRNA-1273 group showed also 
reduced viral load, but the viral load reduction compared to the negative control was less.  
After the Wuhan-1 D614G- or BA.1-challenge, the viral load in the nasal wash was about 103 copies/mL in 
both mRNA-1273 dose groups. The viral load in the nasal turbinates was even lower in the 5 µg mRNA-
1273 group at about 101 copies/mL after Wuhan-1 D614G- and BA.1-challenge. In the 0.1 µg mRNA-
1273 vaccinated mice, the Wuhan-1 D614G- and BA.1 viral load in nasal turbinates was at 103 and 102 
copies/mL, respectively. The viral load in lung of 5 µg mRNA-1273 vaccinated mice was at 101.5

copies/mL after Wuhan-1 D614G challenge and at 102 copies/mL after BA.1 challenge. In 0.1 µg group 
mice, the viral load reduction in lung was only slightly lower than in the control mice and showed viral 
loads at 10³ copies/mL after Wuhan-1 D614G challenge and 106 copies/mL after BA.1 challenge. 
Serum neutralising antibody titres were inversely correlated with the viral load in the lung for BA.1, 
where the burden of infection generally decreased as the neutralising antibody titres increased. Thus, the 
highest levels of infection were observed in the BA.1-challenged mice with low neutralising antibody titres 
after vaccination with 0.1 µg mRNA-1273, and the lowest levels of infection were observed in the BA.1-
challenged mice with high neutralising antibody titres after vaccination with 5 µg mRNA-1273. For 
Wuhan-1 D614G, similar results were shown, but without a clear correlation between vaccine dose, 
neutralisation antibody and level of infection. 
Figure 12: mRNA Vaccine Protection Against Disease in K18-hACE2 Transgenic Mice 
6 days after challenge with 104 FFU Wuhan-1 D614G or BA.1, cytokine and chemokine responses in lung 
homogenates were evaluated in mice, which received a 2-dose primary series of mRNA-1273 or mRNA 
negative control. In the control group, Wuhan-1 D614G or BA.1 infection resulted in an increased 
inflammatory response, as indicated by increased expression of several pro-inflammatory cytokines and 
chemokines in lung, including G-CSF, GM-CSF, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, CXCL1, CXCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL2, 
CCL4 and TNF-α.

In the 5 µg mRNA-1273 group, the inflammatory response was reduced compared to controls for both 
Wuhan-1 D614G or BA.1 infection. In addition, mice that received 0.1 µg mRNA-1273 showed low levels 
of cytokines and chemokines after Wuhan-1 D614G challenge. However, no protection was observed in 
these mice challenged with BA.1, where levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the lung 
were similar to those observed in the mRNA control group. 
In mice immunised with mRNA negative control and challenged with Wuhan-1 D614G, histological 
analysis of lung sections showed immune cell infiltration, alveolar space consolidation, vascular 
congestion and interstitial oedema, indicating severe pneumonia. However, mRNA negative control mice 
showed less focal airspace consolidation and immune cell infiltration in lung after BA.1 challenge.  
Mice immunised with 0.1 µg or 5 µg mRNA-1273 did not develop lung pathology after challenge with 
Wuhan-1 D614G and findings were consistent with SARS-CoV-2 uninfected mock animals. After challenge 
with BA.1, 5 µg mRNA-1273 protected against mild pathological changes associated with infection. 
Protection against BA.1 was not observed in mice that received 0.1 µg mRNA-1273, where lung pathology 
findings were similar to those observed in the mRNA control group, with patchy immune cell infiltration, 
airway space thickening, and mild alveolar congestion.

Figure 13: A Booster Dose of mRNA-1273 Enhances Neutralizing Antibody Responses and Confers 
Protection in K18-hACE2 Mice 
17 to 19 weeks after a 2-dose primary series of 0.25 µg or 5 µg mRNA vaccines immunisation in cohort 2 
mice, blood was collected before animals were boosted with 1 µg mRNA-1273 or a control. 
Consistent with the results from cohort 1, pre-boost neutralising antibody titres against Wuhan-1 D614G 
and BA.1 were significant lower in mice immunised with 0.25 µg mRNA-1273 when compared with mice 
immunised with 5 µg mRNA-1273. In addition, the serum neutralising antibody activity was lower against 
BA.1 compared to Wuhan-1 D614G SARS-CoV-2 variant in both mRNA-1273 dose groups. This difference 
was even statistically significant in the 5 µg mRNA-1273 dose group. However, 2 of 4 mice vaccinated 
with 0.25 µg mRNA-1273 showed very low neutralising activity against BA.1, at the lower detection limit.  
One month after boosting with 1 µg mRNA-1273, serum neutralising titres increased against both Wuhan-
1 D614G and BA.1. However, neutralising antibody titres against BA.1 were lower compared with those

observed against Wuhan-1 D614G. Overall, the neutralising antibody titre increased dose-dependent and 
were higher in the 5 µg dose group compared to the 0.25 µg dose group. 
Four weeks after boosting with 1 µg mRNA-1273 or control, mice were challenged with BA.1 and viral 
load was measured in the upper and lower respiratory tract. In mice vaccinated with 0.25 µg or 5 µg 
mRNA-1273 in primary series, and boosted with mRNA-1273, viral load was significantly lower than in the 
mRNA control groups. In the 5 µg mRNA-1273 group, very low BA.1 viral RNA was detected in the nasal 
wash (mean 10³ copies/mL) or nasal turbinates (mean 101.5 copies/mL, 5 of 8 mice), and low levels of 
BA.1 were observed in the lung (mean 102.5 copies/mL).  
In the 0.25 µg mRNA-1273 group, low levels of BA.1 were observed in the nasal wash (1 of 4 mice), 
nasal turbinates (3 of 4 mice), and lung (4 of 4 mice). Overall, evaluation of viral load 6 days post-
infection showed that boosting with 1 µg mRNA-1273 improves neutralising antibody response and 
reduces BA.1 viral load in the upper and lower respiratory tract. 
CHMP comment 
K18-hACE2 mice: 
Cohort 1: 
In line with previous data, 2 doses of mRNA-1273 induce dose-dependent high IgG antibody titres against 
Wuhan and BA.1 spike protein and RBD. In addition, only two high doses of mRNA-1273 induces high 
neutralising antibody response. As expected, the neutralising antibody titre against BA.1 was lower than 
against Wuhan-1 Spike protein. 
Furthermore, 2 doses of mRNA-1273 reduce dose-dependently D614G and BA.1 infection in nasal wash, 
nasal turbinates and lung. In general, BA.1 challenge caused lower viral load than D614G infection in 
vaccinated and control mice. Thus, BA.1 is less infectious than Wuhan-1 SARS-CoV-2 in mice. For 
analysis of viral load in the different tissues, different limits of quantification were set. However, the 
analysis was performed by the same q-RT-PCR method for all tissue samples. The MAH this with the 
different amount of sample for each tissue. After Wuhan and BA.1 challenge, pro-inflammatory cytokines 
and chemokine levels were not increased after high dose mRNA-1273 vaccination compared to control. In 
addition, the low dose of mRNA-1273 shows similar low levels of proinflammatory markers after Wuhan 
infection, but high inflammatory markers after BA.1 infection. Moreover, histopathology of lung tissue 
from vaccinated mice showed reduced inflammation in both dose groups. 
Cohort 2: 
In mice pre-boost and post-boost with mRNA-1273, a dose-dependent increase of neutralising antibody 
titre for BA.1 and Wuhan-1 was observed. However, neutralising antibody titres were lower for BA.1 than 
for Wuhan-1. In general, the titres were higher after booster (3rd dose) compared to pre-boost levels. 
After challenge with BA.1 SARS-CoV-2, a dose-dependent reduction of viral load was observed in nasal 
wash, nasal turbinate and lung. However, the higher dose (5 µg mRNA-1273) protects fully in the upper 
respiratory tract and reduced significant the viral load in the lung. The lower vaccine dose showed only 
partially protection against BA.1 in the upper and lower respiratory tract.  
Overall, three doses of 5 µg mRNA-1273 seem to induce a robust immunogenicity and protection against 
Wuhan-1 and BA.1 SARS-CoV-2 infection in young K18-hACE2 mice. However, this study has some 
limitations. The group sizes were very small, especially for cohort 2. Also, an Omicron-matched vaccine 
was not analysed.

Study design 
6- to 8-week old female BALB/c mice received 0.1 µg or 1 µg of mRNA-1273, mRNA-1273.529 or PBS 
approximately 3 weeks apart. Blood was collected on Day 21 (before 2nd dose) and at Day 36 (2 week 
after 2nd dose), and samples were collected to measure IgG antibody responses against Spike protein-
specific for Wuhan-1 and BA.1 and RBD-specific for Wuhan-1, BA.1, B.1.351 and B.1.617.2 by ELISA and 
neutralising antibodies by VSV-based PSVN assay. For the neutralisation antibody assay, only the 1 µg 
dose groups were evaluated. To evaluate the response to T-cells to peptide pools, spleens were collected 
from 1 µg dose groups on Day 36. T-cell responses were measured in splenocytes, restimulated with two 
separate peptide pools that together encompass the peptide library of the Wuhan-1 S protein. Antigen-
specific CD4+ T-cell cytokine responses (IFN-γ, IL-2, TNF-α, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) and CD8+ T-cell 
cytokine responses (CD107a, IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α) were assessed using intracellular cytokine staining.

Figure 14: Antibody Responses in BALB/c Mice After Immunization with mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.529 
Vaccines 
After the first dose (Day 21) in mice that received 1 µg of mRNA-1273, Wuhan-1 S-specific IgG antibody 
titres were higher than those against BA.1 spike protein. In contrast, Wuhan-1 and BA.1 Spike-specific 
IgG antibody titres were similar after vaccination with 1 µg of mRNA-1273.529. At 0.1 µg of either 
mRNA-1273 or mRNA-1273.529 vaccine, IgG antibody titres against both Wuhan-1 and BA.1 Spike 
protein were very low, near the LOD. 2 weeks after the second dose (Day 36), the IgG antibody titres 
increased against Wuhan-1 and BA.1 Spike protein in all groups. 1 µg mRNA-1273 produced higher IgG 
antibody titres against Wuhan-1 S compared to BA.1 S, and 1 µg mRNA-1273.529 produced similar high 
IgG antibody titres against Wuhan-1 and BA.1 S. It has to be noted, that the BA.1 S-specific IgG antibody 
titre was higher in mRNA-1273.529 vaccinated mice than in mRNA-1273 vaccinated mice. 2 doses of 0.1 
µg mRNA-1273.529 resulted in higher IgG antibody titres against BA.1 Spike compared to Wuhan-1. In 
addition, 2 doses of 1 µg mRNA-1273 or mRNA-1273.529 produced similar IgG titres against Wuhan-1 
RBD, B.1.351 RBD, and B.1.617.2 RBD. However, BA.1 RBD-specific titres were slightly higher in mice 
vaccinated with 1 µg mRNA-1273.529 compared to those vaccinated with 1 µg mRNA-1273. 
Serum neutralising antibody responses were observed against Wuhan-1 D614G after a 2-dose primary 
series of 1 µg mRNA-1273, and slightly lower neutralising antibody titres observed against B.1.351 or 
B.1.617.2. In contrast, the serum neutralising activity was significantly reduced against the BA.1 and 
BA.1.1 compared with Wuhan-1 D614G in these animals. Mice immunised with 2 doses of 1 µg mRNA-
1273.529 showed high neutralisation antibody titres against BA.1 and BA.1.1, but only low titres against

Wuhan-1 D614G, B.1.351, and B.1.617.2, with only few animals with detectable neutralising antibody 
titres. Overall, these data suggest that a primary series with mRNA-1273.529, a BA.1 matched vaccine, 
induces robust neutralising activity against BA.1 and BA.1.1, but not against other previous SARS-Co V-2 
variants.

2 weeks after the second dose, CD4+ T-cell and CD8+ T-cell cytokine production to Wuhan-1 S 
glycoprotein were similar in mice dosed with 1 µg mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.529. In general, very low 
CD4+ T-cell levels were measured. Low levels of IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α could be detected, but almost no 
IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. Thus, these data indicate a slight shift to a Th1-skewed CD4+ T-cell response. In 
addition, moderate levels of CD107a and IFN-γ producing CD8+ T-cells were detected in pool 1 spike 
proteins from both vaccinated mice. In contrast, almost no CD8+ T-cell cytokines were measured. 
CHMP comment 
Dose-dependent increase of BA.1 and Wuhan-1 Spike-specific IgG antibody response after 1st and 2nd 
dose of mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.529. After the 2nd vaccine dose, the Spike-specific IgG antibody 
titres were even increased, similar to previous studies. After the 2nd dose, mRNA-1273.529 showed 
similar high Wuhan-1, but slightly higher BA.1 Spike-specific IgG titres compared to mRNA-1273. In 
addition, 2 doses of 1 µg mRNA-1273 or mRNA-1273.529 induce robust RBD-specific IgG responses 
against Wuhan-1, BA.1 (Omicron), B.1.351 (Beta) and B.1.617.2 (Delta). The antibody titres were similar 
high in both vaccine groups, except for Omicron where mRNA-1273.529 induced a slightly higher 
antibody response. 
The neutralising antibody titres differed remarkably between mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.529 
vaccinated mice. 2 doses of 1 µg mRNA-1273 induced robust neutralising antibody titres only against

Wuhan-1, Beta and Delta variants. In contrast, mRNA-1273.529 induces robust neutralising antibody 
titres only against the two Omicron variants BA.1 and BA.1.1. 
In general, the Wuhan S-specific T-cell response was similar in mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.529 
vaccinated mice. Low CD4+ T-cell response was observed in both groups. In addition, moderate CD107a 
and IFN-γ CD8+ T-cell responses were detected. However, the T-cell response against Omicron S-protein 
or another VoC was not analysed. 
WASHU-129MOD5/6 study (cohort 4): 
Study design 
7-week old female 129S2 mice received 0.25 µg or 5 µg of noncoding mRNA (negative control) or mRNA-
1273 on Day 0 and Day 21. 10 to 11 weeks after the second dose, mice were boosted homologous or 
heterologous with 1 µg of mRNA control, mRNA-1273, or mRNA-1273.529. Blood was collected before the 
booster dose and at 3 to 4 weeks post-boost dose to assess neutralising antibodies against Wuhan-1 
D614G and BA.1 by FRNT. 3 or 4 days after the post-boost blood collection, mice were challenged with 
105 FFU of Wuhan-1 N501Y/D614G or BA.1 intranasally.  
Table 5: Treatment Regimen for WASHU-129MOD5/6: 129S2 Mice 
The Wuhan-1 N501Y/D614G variant was used because the substitution of N501Y enables engagement of 
murine angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and productive infection of conventional strains of laboratory 
mice. Mice were euthanised 3 days post-infection, and tissues of nasal wash, nasal turbinates, and lung 
were harvested for virological, cytokine, and chemokine analysis.

induced slightly higher neutralising antibody response against Wuhan-1 N501Y/D614G compared to 
mRNA-1273.529 booster. The BA.2-specific neutralising antibody titre increased slightly higher in mRNA-
1273.529 than in mRNA-1273 boosted mice. However, boosting with mRNA-1273.529 induced higher 
neutralising antibody titres against BA.1, but not in mRNA-1273-boosted mice.  
Figure 17: Booster Doses of mRNA-1273 or mRNA-1273.529 Enhance Protection Against BA.1 Infection in 
129S2 Mice 
3 days after infection with 105 FFU Wuhan-1 N501Y/D614G or BA.1, the viral BA.1 RNA levels in the 
upper and lower respiratory tracts in mice vaccinated with the control mRNA were significantly lower than 
those observed after Wuhan-1 N501Y/D614G infection, indicating a lower pathogenicity of BA.1 in mice. 
In mice primed with mRNA-1273 and boosted with mRNA-1273 or mRNA-1273.529, the Wuhan-1 
N501Y/D614G and BA.1 viral load was significantly reduced in nasal wash, nasal turbinates and lungs 
compared to mRNA control, in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast to the high dose (5 µg), mice 
primed with the low dose (0.25 µg) of mRNA-1273 and boosted with mRNA-1273 showed less protection 
against BA.1 in the lung and nasal turbinates compared to 0.25 µg mRNA-1273.529 boosted mice.

Interestingly, mice primed with 5 µg mRNA-1273 but without booster showed comparable protection 
against Wuhan-1 N501Y/D614G than mice that got boosted with mRNA-1273 or mRNA-1273.529.  
After Wuhan-1 N501Y/D614G challenge, mice primed with mRNA-1273 and boosted with either mRNA-
1273 or mRNA-1273.529 had lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines compared with 
mice that received 3 doses of control mRNA. Also, vaccinated mice without additional booster showed 
reduced cytokine and chemokine levels. 
After BA.1 challenge, mice immunised with 5 µg mRNA-1273 and boosted with mRNA-1273 or mRNA-
1273.529 or without additional booster showed reduced levels of chemokines and cytokines compared to 
the negative control mice. Furthermore, the BA.1-induced inflammatory response in mice primed with 
0.25 µg mRNA-1273 without booster was similar to the response in negative control mice. In addition, 
lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were observed in mice primed with 0.25 µg 
mRNA and boosted with mRNA-1273.529 compared to those boosted with mRNA-1273. 
CHMP comment 
An increase of Wuhan- and Omicron-specific neutralising antibody titre was observed in mice when 
boosted with mRNA-1273 or mRNA-1273.529 (3rd dose). As expected, the BA.1 and BA.2 neutralising 
antibody titres were slightly higher in mRNA-1273.529 booster mice, and the Wuhan-specific neutralising 
antibody titre were slightly higher in mRNA-1273.  
After challenge with Wuhan or BA.1 SARS-CoV-2, pro-inflammatory markers and viral loads in the upper 
and lower respiratory tract were reduced in all vaccinated mice. In addition, the mice vaccinated with 
control mRNA showed lower viral load and slightly lower levels of pro-inflammatory marker after BA.1 
infection than after Wuhan-1 infection. Thus, the Omicron variant seems to be less infectious in mice than 
the Wuhan variant. Similar results were seen in humans. 
Overall, mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.529 booster show similar good protection against Wuhan-1 and 
BA.1 infection. Also, the levels of pro-inflammatory markers were lower in boosted mice than in non-
boosted or control mice. 3 days after challenge with the Wuhan variant, the viral loads in nasal wash, 
nasal turbinates and lung tissue were slightly above the lower detection limit in both booster groups. 
However, the viral load in nasal turbinates and lung tissue were slightly higher in both booster groups 
after BA.1 infection. The viral load in nasal wash after BA.1 infection was as low as after the Wuhan 
infection. 
The dose concentration of the primary vaccination series seems to be important for a robust neutralising 
antibody titre, reduced viral load and decreased levels of pro-inflammatory markers. Mice, who were 
primed with a high vaccine dose, show higher neutralising antibody titre and better protection against 
SARS-CoV-2 variants. This effect was even observed after the booster vaccination. The booster 
vaccination was always 1 µg mRNA.

Booster Regimen in a Rhesus Macaque SARS-CoV-2 Omicron Challenge Model 
Study design 
The study was conducted in 16 Indian-origin rhesus macaques (3 female and 13 male; 4 to 8 years old). 
Eight animals were immunised intramuscular with 100 µg mRNA-1273 at Week 0 and Week 4, 
administered in 1 mL/dose into the right quadricep. At Week 41, the eight animals were split into groups 
of 4 and boosted with 50 µg mRNA-1273 or 50 µg mRNA-1273.529. In addition, eight naïve animals of 
the control group were immunised with 50 µg control non-translating mRNA (UNFIX-01) at the time of

boost (week 41). Macaques were challenged at Week 45 (4 weeks after the booster) with a total dose of 
1 × 106 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron. The viral inoculum was administered as 7.5 × 105 PFU in 3 mL 
intratracheal and 2.5 × 105 PFU in 1 mL intranasal in a volume of 0.5 mL distributed evenly into each 
nostril.

Sera were collected pre-boost (Week 6 and Week 41) and post-boost (Week 43) and were assessed for 
total IgG antibody response to variant SARS-CoV-2 S- and receptor-binding domain (RBD)-derived 
antigens (Wuhan-1 D614G, B.1.351, B.1.617.2 and B.1.1.529). The binding antibody responses were 
measured by mean square displacement (MSD) V-Plex. Neutralising antibodies were measured for 
Wuhan-1 D614G, B.1.351, B.1.617.2, and B.1.1.529 by a live virus assay and a lentiviral pseudovirus 
neutralisation assay. In addition, the antibody avidity for Wuhan-1 and Omicron was measured over time 
following immunisation. Moreover, nasal washes and BAL fluid were collected at pre-boost at Week 8, 
Week 39, and post-boost at Week 43 to assess upper and lower airway mucosal antibody response. The 
IgG binding antibody response was measured by ELISA and the neutralisation capacity of the produced 
antibodies was evaluated by an ACE2 receptor inhibition assay, which was used as a surrogate for 
antibody function. 
Furthermore, B-cell binding to S-2P was measured at Week 6, Week 41, and Week 43. To further explore 
the effect of boosting on anamnestic B-cell responses, the activation status of S-binding memory B-cells 
was phenotyped. In addition, T-cell responses were measured. 
Four weeks after administration of either boost, animals were challenged with 1 × 106 PFU via both IT 
and IN routes. Two days after challenge, oral swabs were collected. BAL fluid was collected 2, 4, and 8

days after challenge. Nasal swabs were collected 1, 2, 4, and 8 days after challenge. In addition, SARS-
CoV-2 sgRNA copy numbers were measured to determine the extent of viral replication. To assess lung 
pathology in the NHPs, 2 of the animals of each group were euthanised 7 to 9 days after the Omicron 
challenge, and lung tissue was processed for histopathology and immunohistochemistry.  
Results 
Figure 19: Serum Antibody Responses Following mRNA-1273 Primary Series and Boost 
2 weeks after the second dose of the primary vaccine regimen, S- and RBD-specific IgG antibody titres 
were measured in serum by MSD V-Plex. Overall, the S-specific IgG antibody titres against SARS-CoV-2 
Wuhan-1, Beta, Delta and Omicron were higher than the RBD-specific IgG antibody titres against those 
variants. In addition, the S and RBD-specific IgG antibody titres against all tested SARS-CoV-2 variants 
decreased markedly by week 41 before boosting. 2 weeks after boosting with mRNA-1273 or mRNA-
1273.529, S- and RBD-specific IgG binding antibody titres increased for all SARS-CoV-2 variants and titre 
levels were similar to the titre levels at week 6. For both S- and RBD-specific IgG antibody titres, the 
vaccines induced the highest titres against SARS-CoV-2 variant Wuhan-1 followed by Delta, then Beta 
and lowest titre level for Omicron. For both S- and RBD-specific IgG binding antibody titres, the titre

levels of all four SARS-CoV-2 variants were slightly lower in mRNA-1273.529 boosted animals than in 
mRNA-1273 boosted animals. 
Similar to the IgG binding antibody titre levels, neutralising antibody titres were highest to Wuhan-1 
D614G followed by Delta, then Beta, then Omicron variant when measured by live virus neutralisation 
assay and lentiviral pseudovirus neutralisation assay after the 2 mRNA-1273 doses of the primary vaccine 
regime. Also, the neutralising antibody titres against all tested SARS-CoV-2 variants decreased 
significantly by Week 41. The measured neutralising antibody titres of Omicron were slightly lower when 
tested by the live virus neutralisation assay and measured neutralising antibody titres of Beta were 
slightly higher when tested by the live virus neutralisation assay. Following a boost with mRNA-1273 or 
mRNA-1273.529, neutralising antibody titres to Wuhan-1 D614G and Delta increased and were similar to 
those measured at Week 6. Neutralising antibody titres to Beta and Omicron variants were even higher 
than they had been measured at Week 6.  
Serum antibody avidity following immunisation was measured over time for Wuhan-1 and Omicron 
variants to assess whether the increased neutralising titres after the boost could be attributed to antibody 
maturation. Antibody avidity to Wuhan-1 and Omicron Spike-2P significantly increased from Week 6 (2 
weeks after the 2nd mRNA-1273 dose) to Week 40. Antibody avidity to Omicron Spike-2P increased faster 
than to Wuhan-1. After the boost with mRNA-1273 or mRNA-1273.529, the antibody avidity to Wuhan-1 
was slightly higher compared to Omicron.

Figure 20: Mucosal Antibody Response to Boosting with mRNA-1273 or mRNA-1273.529 
The upper and lower airway mucosal S-specific IgG antibody responses were analysed by MSD V-Plex 
after two doses of mRNA-1273 (primary vaccine regimen) and after boosting with mRNA-1273 or mRNA-
1273.529. Overall, S-specific IgG antibody titres against all SARS-CoV-2 variants were slightly higher in 
nasal wash compared to bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. Similar to the serum IgG antibody titre, the 
titres decreased significantly after the primary vaccine series until week 39. After boosting with mRNA-
1273 or mRNA-1273.529, the mucosal IgG antibody titre increased for all SARS-CoV-2 variants. In 
general, BAL fluid and nasal wash S-specific IgG antibody titres were highest in Wuhan-1, then slightly 
lower in Delta, then Beta, and finally Omicron, after the primary vaccine series and after boosting. After 
boosting, the mucosal IgG antibody titres did not differ remarkably between mRNA-1273 and mRNA-
1273.529 booster. 
An ACE2 inhibition assay was applied, which was used as a surrogate for neutralisation capacity of the 
vaccines. BAL fluid expressed 25% to 50% median ACE2 binding inhibition for all variants at Week 8, 
except for Omicron S-2P, in which binding inhibition was low to undetectable. There was a remarkable

decrease in ACE2 binding inhibition for all variants by Week 39, followed by an increase after either the 
mRNA-1273 or mRNA-1273.529 boost. Despite an increase in ACE2 inhibition of Omicron S-2P following 
the boost, it was still lower than all the other variants. In nasal wash samples, the ACE2 binding inhibition 
was similar than for BAL fluid at week 8, but very low to undetectable at Week 39. After administration of 
either boost, there was an increase in ACE2 S-2P binding inhibition across all variants, but slightly lower 
for Omicron. After boosting with either mRNA vaccine, the ACE2 binding inhibition in BAL and nasal wash 
was higher than the initial peak after the primary vaccine series at Week 8. 
Figure 21: Memory B-Cell Specificities Following Immunization and Boosting 
B-cell binding was measured using different SARS-CoV-2 variants to assess mobilisation of cross-reactive 
memory B-cells. At Week 6, Wuhan-1-specific and Wuhan-1/Omicron-cross-reactive S-2P-specific 
memory B-cell responses were detected. However, the total S-specific memory B-cell compartment

decreased significantly by Week 41. At Week 43, an expansion of the total S-specific memory B-cell 
compartment (similar to that observed at Week 6) was observed following either boost.  
After boosting with mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.529, the majority of S-2P–specific memory B-cells were 
dual-specific for Wuhan-1 and Omicron. In addition, high Wuhan-1 specific memory B-cells were detected 
in mRNA-1273 boosted animals. In contrast, only very low amount of Omicron-specific and Wuhan-1-
specific memory B-cells were detected in mRNA-1273.529 boosted animals. 
Furthermore, vaccination with mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.529 induced only low Delta and Beta specific 
S-2P-specific memory B-cell responses in the NHPs. 
Figure 22: Expansion of Cross-Reactive S-2P-Specific Memory B-Cells Following Boosting 
To further explore the effect of boosting on anamnestic B-cell responses, the activation status of S-
binding memory B-cells was phenotyped. Wuhan-1 S-2P– and/or Omicron S-2P-binding memory B-cells 
predominantly had an activated memory phenotype immediately after both the second and third doses.

At week 41 prior to booster dose, the relative amount of resting memory B-cells and CD27-resting 
memory B-cells increased.  
Figure 23: Both mRNA-1273 or mRNA-1273.529 Boost T-Cell Responses to S Peptides 
Two doses of mRNA-1273 caused low Th1 and high Tfh CD40L and Tfh IL21 levels in blood samples of 
NHPs. In addition, low levels of CD8+ T-cell response was observed in two vaccinated animals. However, 
one animal showed already detectable CD8+ T-cell levels prior vaccination (week 0). Overall, the T-cell 
responses significantly decreased until week 41 (before booster). Administration of mRNA-1273 or mRNA-
1273.529 boost significantly increased Tfh responses. In addition, mRNA-1273 booster increased the Th1-
response in all four animals and CD8+ T-cell response in two animals. 
In BAL fluid, Th1 and CD8+ T-cell responses were detected at Week 8, which decreased to extreme low 
T-cell levels at Week 39 (pre-boost). At week 43, these T-cell responses were increased with either the 
mRNA-1273 or the mRNA-1273.529 boost (Week 43).  
There was little to no response from Th2 T-cells in BAL fluid or blood samples after the primary mRNA-
1273 vaccine series or after the booster with mRNA-1273 or mRNA-1273.529.

Figure 24: Boosting Provides Equivalent Protection in the Lungs Against Omicron Challenge 
Four weeks after administration of either boost, NHPs were challenged with 1x106 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 
Omicron both IT and IN. After the challenge, BAL fluid, nasal swabs and oral swabs were collected and 
the extent of viral replication was measured by copy numbers of SARS-CoV-2 sgRNA using q-RT-PCR. 
Control NHPs had high sgRNA copy numbers (10E6 copies/mL) in BAL fluid at Day 2 post-infection, which 
decreased over time (10E4 copies/ml on Day 8). In addition, sgRNA copy numbers were also detected in 
nasal swabs (Day1 to Day8) and oral swabs of control animals (Day 2). In BAL fluid, vaccinated NHPs had 
mean copy numbers of 3×102 and 2×102 sgRNA copies/mL for the mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.529 
cohorts on Day 2, respectively. In addition, sgRNA was detected in nasal swabs of all vaccinated NHPs on 
Day 1 and Day 2, in one mRNA-1273 and two mRNA-1273.529 boosted NHPS on Day 4, and in oral 
swabs of one mRNA-1273 boosted animal on Day 2. All vaccinated NHPs had undetectable levels of 
sgRNA in BAL by Day 4 and in nasal swabs by Day 8 post-infection. 
In TCID50 assay, no virus was detected in the BAL fluid of any vaccinated NHPs, while almost all control 
NHPs had detectable virus on Day 2 and Day 4 post-infection. One mRNA-1273 boosted NHP had 
detectable virus load in the nasal swab on Day 2. In the unvaccinated control animals, 2 out of 8 NHPs on 
Day 2 and 3 out of 8 NHPs on Day 4 had detectable virus in the nose.

Figure 25: Viral Antigen and Pathology in the Lungs After Challenge 
Following Omicron challenge, two NHPs from each of the vaccinated groups and four NHPs from the 
control group were euthanised on Day 8. Variable amounts of nucleocapsid antigen were detected in the 
lungs of two control NHPs. Viral antigen was often associated with the alveolar capillaries and occasional 
nearby immune cells. In contrast, there was no evidence of viral antigen in the lung samples of any 
vaccinated NHP. 
Animals from both boost groups exhibited histopathologic alterations that were classified as minimal to 
mild or mild to moderate. Inflammation was characterised by mild and patchy expansion of alveolar 
capillaries, generalised alveolar capillary hypercellularity, mild and regional type II pneumocyte 
hyperplasia, and (less frequently) scattered collections of immune cells within some alveolar spaces.  
Control NHPs had moderate to severe pathology. Lung sections from controls included moderate and 
often diffuse alveolar capillary expansion, diffuse hypercellularity, moderate type II pneumocyte 
hyperplasia, and multiple areas of perivascular cellular infiltration (cuffing).

CHMP comment 
For this study, Indian rhesus macaques vaccinated with mRNA-1273 or Omicron-matched mRNA-
1273.529 booster were analysed for immunogenicity and efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection. 
This animal model is known for susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and is thus a suitable model for 
challenge studies. However, the animal sexes were not equal distributed with only 3 female and 13 male 
rhesus macaques in total. In addition, the age distribution was wide with 4 to 8 years old animals. 
Furthermore, the groups size was small with 4 animals per vaccine group and only 2 animals per vaccine 
group were histo-pathologically analysed after the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron challenge. Thus, no meaningful 
statistic evaluation of the results could be made. 
For this study, a dose schedule comparable to the recommended clinical dose schedule with this vaccine 
was applied (primary vaccination regime 4 weeks apart, booster vaccination about 10 months after 1st 
dose). Furthermore, the vaccines were administered via the recommended human route and the human 
vaccine doses were used (100 µg mRNA for primary series, 50 µg for booster). However, mRNA-1273.214 
was not analysed as booster, although, this vaccine variant is the article for this approval. 
This study showed that one mRNA-1273.529 booster vaccination is not superior to one mRNA.1273 
booster vaccination in NHP regarding immunogenicity. Both booster vaccine candidates induced similar 
high serum and mucosal S- and RGB-specific IgG antibody titres and neutralising antibody responses. 
Both were highest effective against the Wuhan-1 variant, then Delta, then Beta and then Omicron. 
Many Wuhan/Omicron cross-reactive memory B-cells were detected after mRNA-1273 and mRNA-
1273.529 booster vaccination. In addition, high amount of Wuhan-specific memory B-cells were detected 
in mRNA-1273 and slightly less in mRNA-1273.529 boosted NHPs. As expected, only little amount of 
Omicron-specific memory B-cells were detected in mRNA-1273 boosted cells. However, the amount of 
Omicron-specific memory B-cells were even smaller in mRNA-1273.529 boosted cells. Further analysis 
showed, that activated memory cells were the predominant phenotype after booster with either vaccine.  
Furthermore, both booster vaccines induced comparable T-cell responses in NHPs. They both showed 
similar Tfh CD40L+ and Tfh IL21+ activation in PBMC. But, mRNA-1273.529 induced slightly lower Th1 
and CD8+ T-cell responses than mRNA-1273 in blood cells. However, mRNA-1273.529 induced slightly 
higher Th1 and CD8+ T-cell responses than mRNA-1273 in BAL. In addition, Th2 T-cell response was not 
induced by either vaccine, not in PBMC nor in BAL fluid. Overall, the vaccine-inducted T-cell response was 
relatively low after booster with mRNA-1273 or mRNA-1273.529. These data are in line with the data 
from the initial MAA of Spikevax (mRNA-1273). 
Both boosters showed similar, partly protection from SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection. The viral titre in BAL 
and nasal swabs of vaccinated NHPs were at the lower detection limit in contrast to control animals that 
showed detectable viral titres. Furthermore, viral sgRNA in BAL was only detected on Day 2 in both 
vaccinated groups, in nasal swabs from Day 1 to Day 4, and in oral swabs only in one mRNA-1273 
boosted animal. The histopathology of lung tissue showed similar results. The two analysed NHPs per 
vaccine group showed no viral antigen in lung tissue, but minimal to mild inflammation in lung tissue was 
observed in both vaccine groups. Thus, one booster dose of either vaccine showed comparable efficacy 
with partly protection from SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection. Therefore, no superior in efficacy against 
Omicron infection was shown for one booster dose of mRNA-1273.529 in NHPs. 
4.1.3.  CHMP’s overall conclusions on pharmacology 
The MAH conducted several pharmacodynamics studies with Omicron-matched mRNA vaccines in mice 
and one study in rhesus macaques. All studies were non-GLP compliant, which is accepted. In these 
studies, the MAH analysed the immunogenicity of the monovalent Omicron-matched vaccine mRNA-
Assessment report

1273.529 and the bivalent Omicron-matched vaccine mRNA-1273.214 and compered them with the 
parent vaccine mRNA-1273. In addition, the efficacy of these vaccines was evaluated by challenging mice 
or NHPs with Wuhan or BA.1 SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
mRNA-1273, mRNA-1273.529 and mRNA-1273.214 could demonstrate robust Spike protein-specific IgG 
antibody responses against different SARS-CoV-2 variants (Wuhan-1, Omicron (BA.1, BA.2, BA.1.1), Beta 
and/or Delta) in blood. In one BALB/c mice and one NHP study, it could be also shown that mRNA-1273 
and mRNA-1273.529 induce RBD-specific IgG antibody responses against Wuhan-1, Omicron BA.1, Beta 
and Delta SARS-CoV-2. However, the Omicron IgG titre was slightly lower in both vaccine groups 
compared to the titre of the other variants. Moreover, mRNA-1273, mRNA-1273.529 and mRNA-1273.214 
induced neutralising antibody titres against several SARS-CoV-2 variants but differed remarkably in their 
specificity. The bivalent Omicron-matched vaccine mRNA-1273.214 showed neutralising antibody titres 
against Wuhan-1 and the two Omicron variants BA.1 and BA.2 in mice (Beta and Delta were not tested). 
The monovalent Omicron-matched vaccine mRNA-1273.529 showed neutralising antibody titres against 
BA.1, BA.1.1 and BA.2, but only very low levels against Wuhan, Beta and Delta in mice. However, in 
NHPs, one booster dose of mRNA-1273.529 could induce moderate neutralising antibody responses 
against Wuhan, Delta, Beta and Omicron. mRNA-1273 showed neutralising antibody titres against Wuhan, 
Delta and Beta in mice, and Wuhan, Omicron, Delta and Beta in NHPs. In mice, neutralising antibody 
titres were generally low after one (booster) dose but reached robust levels after a second dose of the 
vaccine variant. In NHPs, one booster dose already induced stronger neutralising antibody titres.  
All vaccine variants induced only low T-cell responses in mice and NHPs. In addition, one booster dose of 
an Omicron-matched vaccine did not induce significant memory B-cell activation in mice and NHP lymph 
nodes. However, increased levels of Wuhan-specific memory B-cells were observed after a booster dose 
with mRNA-1273 in mice and NHPs. A second booster dose with mRNA-1273.529 in BALB/c mice did also 
not increase the Omicron-specific memory B-cell level in mice. This result might be also due to too low 
amount of booster vaccine (0.25 µg). 
mRNA-1273 and/or mRNA-1273.529 vaccinated mice and NHPs showed partly protection against Wuhan 
or Omicron SARS-CoV-2 infection. The viral load was significantly reduced in the upper and lower 
respiratory tract of the vaccinated study animals compared to the negative control animals. In addition, 
pro-inflammatory markers and inflammation in lung tissue were reduced in the vaccinated animals. 
However, significant differences in efficacy against Wuhan or Omicron infection were not observed in mice 
and NHPs. 
Overall, the submitted pharmacodynamics data package is sufficient for the type II variation of Spikevax 
regarding bivalent Omicron-matched Spikevax mRNA-1273.214. However, the studies had some 
limitations. Most of the immunogenicity studies and all challenge studies were not conducted with mRNA-
1273.214. Instead, the parent vaccine mRNA-1273 was compared with the monovalent Omicron-matched 
vaccine mRNA-1273.529. This can be accepted since mRNA-1273.214 is a 1:1 mix of mRNA-1273 and 
mRNA-1273.529. Thus, significant pharmacodynamics differences are not expected, especially not for 
protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants infections (which were not tested with mRNA-1273.214). In 
addition, challenge studies were conducted only with Wuhan-1 and Omicron BA.1. Challenge studies with 
other SARS-CoV-2 VoCs were not conducted, e.g. with Omicron BA.5 or Delta. Another limitation was that 
only females were used for the mice pharmacodynamics studies. It might be possible that male mice 
would show a different immunogenicity reaction. Regarding to the significant differences of spike-specific 
IgG antibody responses in female and male rats of the repeat-dose toxicity study, it can be assumed that 
the mRNA-1273-induced immune responses differs generally between female and male rodents. Any 
conclusion about sex-based differences in immunogenicity of mRNA-1273 in NHPs cannot be drawn 
because the sexes were not equally distributed in this study.

4.2.1.  Pharmacokinetic studies 
One non-GLP compliant biodistribution study with mRNA-1647 in SD rats has been conducted. This study 
has been assessed already for the initial MAA of Spikevax (mRNA-1273). Here, the MAH submitted an

In brief, the tissue distribution of mRNA-1647 was analysed in this study, when given one dose of 100 µg 
by intramuscular injection to male SD rats. In addition, the toxicokinetic characteristics of mRNA-1647 
were determined. 
Results 
Mean plasma concentrations of mRNA-1647 were quantifiable up to 24 hours. All six mRNA-1647 
constructs, gB, gH, gL, UL130, UL131A, and UL128 levels measured in plasma and tissues demonstrated 
nearly identical pharmacokinetic behaviour. The highest mRNA-1647 exposure was observed in muscle 
(i.e. site of injection), followed by proximal (popliteal) lymph nodes, axillary distal lymph nodes and 
spleen, suggesting the mRNA-1647 distribution to the circulation by lymph flow. All other tissues tested, 
except for kidney and eye, have demonstrated exposures comparable or below that measured in plasma. 
Exposure observed for the eye was only slightly higher than that in plasma while no mRNA-1647 
constructs were detected at any time point in the kidney.  
Concentrations of mRNA-1647 were quantifiable in the majority of tissues examined and in plasma at the 
first time point collected (i.e. 2 hours post-dose) and peak concentrations were reached between 2 and 
24 hours post-dose in tissues with exposures above that of plasma. The t1/2 of mRNA-1647 was reliably 
estimated in muscle (i.e. site of injection), proximal popliteal and axillary distal lymph nodes and spleen 
with average values for all construct t1/2 of 14.9, 34.8, 31.1, and 63.0 hours, respectively. 
The average for all constructs, mRNA-1647 tissue-to-plasma AUC(0-t) ratios for highly exposed tissues 
were 1010 (not 939, as written in the previous version of this study report), 201, 62.8, and 13.4 for 
muscle (i.e. injection site), the lymph nodes (proximal popliteal and axillary distal) and spleen, 
respectively.

4.2.3.  Metabolism 
Specific metabolism studies with mRNA-1273 or mRNA-1273 variant vaccines have not been conducted. 
However, the metabolism and elimination of the amino-lipid component SM-102 in mRNA-1273 have 
been examined in vivo (Study QV-0236-DA-RE) and in vitro (Study NCS-BA- 2022-010). 
Study NCS-BA-2022-010: Identification and profiling of metabolites of SM-102 in Rat, Monkey 
and Human Hepatocytes 
Study design 
The purpose of this non-GLP compliant study was to evaluate the metabolism of SM-102 in cryopreserved 
primary hepatocytes prepared from 6 male Sprague-Dawley rat, 5 male cynomolgus monkey and 5 
female and 5 male humans, and to qualitatively characterise the in vitro metabolism of SM-102 following 
incubation of SM-102-containing LNPs with hepatocytes from these species. 10 µM of SM-102 was used 
as final concentration in this metabolism study. 
The metabolite profiling was performed by Liquid chromatography–high resolution mass spectrometry. 
Chromatographic and mass spectral data were collected at 0h, 4h and 24h and were compared to the 
corresponding control samples. SM-102 was incubated with denatured hepatocytes to identify potential 
metabolism-related components, such as interfering signals or chemical degradation products.  
Results 
Table 8: Summary of Metabolite Profiling of SM-102 in Human, Rat and NHP Hepatocytes 
SM-102 and 5 metabolites (M1, M3, M4, M6 and M7) were detected by UPLC-MS/MS in human and NHP 
hepatocytes that were incubated with 10 µM of SM-102-containing LNPs. 4 metabolites (M1, M4, M6 and 
M7) were detected in rat hepatocytes incubated with 10 µM SM-102-containing LNPs, but metabolite M3 
was not detected in rat hepatocytes. In general, the Extracted Ion Chromatograms for all the metabolite 
signals were higher in rat and NHP hepatocytes compared to the signals in human hepatocytes. SM-102 
metabolites were formed by ester hydrolysis, ester hydrolysis with beta-oxidation chain shortening or N-
dealkylation followed by ester hydrolysis. No human-specific metabolites were detected.

Study QV-0236-DA-RE: Metabolite Profile and Identification of SM-102 in Rat Plasma, Urine 
and Bile Following IV Infusion of SM-102 containing Lipid Nanoparticles to Male Sprague 
Dawley Rats 
Study design 
In this non-GLP compliant study, complete SM-102 was quantified and metabolites of SM-102 were 
identified in plasma, bile and urine samples from Sprague Dawley rats (n=3). The metabolites were 
analysed by LC-HRMS and SM-102 was quantified by LC/MS/MS. 
The metabolite profile of SM-102 was obtained in rat plasma, urine and bile at various time points (2h, 6h 
and 24h) after intravenous administration of an SM-102-containing LNP to bile duct cannulated rats. To 
achieve this, m/z derived from the predicted metabolites [M+H] were used to extract the ion 
chromatograms. 
Results 
In addition to the unchanged SM-102, 12 metabolites were observed in rats after intravenous 
administration of SM-102.

Metabolism of SM-102 in rats occurs primarily by hydrolysis of the ester groups followed by β-oxidation of 
the resulting aliphatic acidic linkers. Additionally, low abundance oxidative metabolites of ester-
hydrolysed SM-102 fragments were detected. 
Table 10: Summary of Parent SM102 in Plasma, Urine and Bile 
High levels of complete SM-102 were found in plasma at 2 hours (mean 22,500 ng/mL), which declined to 
42 ng/mL by 24 hours. Similarly, bile had the highest levels of SM-102 detected at 2 hours (3,140 
ng/mL), which declined to 291 ng/mL by 24 hours. In contrast, SM102 could not be detected in urine 
samples at any time point. 
Table 11: Metabolites of SM102 in Plasma 
Unchanged SM-102 was the dominant chemical species in plasma at all tested time points. Furthermore, 
eight metabolites appeared in plasma from 2 to 6 h including multiple species of ester-hydrolysed, β-
oxidised and hydroxylated metabolites. By 24h post-dose, unchanged SM-102, one mono acidic ester 
hydrolysis metabolite (M7), diacidic ester hydrolysis metabolite (M4), and their corresponding β-oxidation

products (M3 and M6) were also detected. In addition, N-dealkylation of the straight chain ester linker of 
SM-102 (M5) was detected. In general, all metabolite concentrations in plasma declined over time. 
Table 12: Metabolites of SM-102 in Urine Pools 
Beside of parent SM-102, four metabolites could be detected in the urine including diacids (M2-M4) and a 
monoacidic secondary amine (M1). These metabolites are relatively more hydrophilic and have in general 
a lower molecular weight compared to those found in bile and plasma samples. In general, the metabolite 
concentration did not change remarkably over time.

Table 13: Metabolites of SM-102 in Bile 
Unchanged SM-102 and twelve metabolites were identified in the bile. In addition to those metabolites 
found in urine and plasma, multiple step β-oxidation products (M2, M3, M6, M9, M10), β-oxidation +GSH 
conjugation product (M12) and hydroxylated metabolites (M8, M9, M10, and M11) were detected. In 
general, the metabolite concentration declined slightly over time. 
CHMP comment 
Both metabolism pharmacokinetic studies were non-GLP. The in vitro study in rat, NHPs and human 
hepatocytes showed that SM-102 metabolites were formed mainly by ester hydrolysis, ester hydrolysis 
with β-oxidation chain shortening or N-dealkylation followed by ester hydrolysis. In this study, no human-
specific metabolites were detected.  
The in vivo study in rats showed that complete SM-102 was the dominant species in plasma. The SM-102 
concentration declined significantly over time. SM-102 was also found in the bile, which declined slightly 
over time. However, only traces of SM-102 were found in urine. In addition, primary metabolites in 
plasma were formed by ester hydrolysis and/or β-oxidation, which were cleared via both the renal and 
hepatic routes of elimination. In urine and bile, relative high metabolite concentrations were still 
detectable after 24 hours. 
4.2.4.  CHMP’s overall conclusions on pharmacokinetics 
The MAH conducted two non-GLP pharmacokinetic studies to evaluate the metabolism of SM-102, which 
is included in the LNP-formulation of Spikevax mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.529. SM-102 was already 
approved in the EU as ingredient of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine Spikevax. The conducted pharmacokinetic 
studies showed that no human-specific metabolites were detected. In addition, the detected metabolites 
declined in plasma over time and were cleared by the renal or hepatic route. 
In addition, the MAH submitted an amendment of the biodistribution study 5002121 with mRNA-1647. 
Mainly, editorial changes and correction of data were made.  
Assessment report  
EMA/896245/2022 
Page 103/191 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, the pharmacokinetic data package is acceptable. Because mRNA-1273.214 is based on the same 
mRNA vaccine-platform and LNP-formulation than mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1647, no additional 
pharmacokinetic studies with mRNA-1273.214 are needed. 
4.3.  Toxicology 
4.3.1.  Repeat-dose toxicity 
Study 2308-245: 8-week Toxicity Study of mRNA-1273 Following Intramuscular Injection in 
Rats with a 2-Week Recovery Period  
Study design 
The safety of mRNA-1273 was assessed in a GLP-compliant repeat-dose toxicity study. In this study, 7 
weeks old Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were vaccinated intramuscularly with three doses of mRNA-1273 at 
a dose level of 40 µg/dose with a volume of 0.2 mL/dose. As control, 20 mM Tris buffer with 8% (w/v) 
sucrose was used. The dose formulations of mRNA-1273 were within specifications, which were confirmed 
by a GLP-compliant ion exchange high performance liquid chromatography analysis. The MAH chose SD 
rats as an animal model because they are commonly used for toxicity evaluation of various classes of 
chemicals and a large historical database of these animal models is available. The animals were divided 
into two groups: group 1 rats were injected with the control article and group 2 rata were injected with 
mRNA-1273. mRNA-1273 or the control article were administered on Day 1, Day 29 and Day 57. The 
doses were administered into the left quadriceps on Day 1, right quadriceps on Day 29 and left biceps 
femoris muscle on Day 57. The administration route, intramuscular, was the intended human clinical 
route. In each group, 10 rats/sex were analysed and euthanised one day after the last vaccination 
(terminal euthanasia, Day 58) and 5 rats/sex were analysed and euthanised after a 2 week-recovery 
period (recovery euthanasia, Day 72). 
Results 
The animals were checked for mortality and general cage side observation was conducted at least twice 
daily. After initiation of dosing, one control male was found dead on Day 1 and was replaced with an 
alternate male. The cause of the death was undetermined because the animal had no previous clinical 
signs or indications of distress. This dead control animal was not pathologically analysed because the MAH 
considered this case as incidental. Another male control animal was found dead on Day 60. This animal 
was analysed pathologically, but the cause of death remained undefined as the animal showed no 
previous clinical signs or indications of distress. Nevertheless, this death was considered as not vaccine-
related. 
A general clinical observation was done once daily, where the animals were observed within their cages 
and a detailed clinical observation was done during the acclimation period, prior to randomisation on Day 
1, and weekly thereafter throughout the study on dosing days. For a detailed clinical observation, the 
animals were removed from the cage. The animals were observed on skin, fur, eyes, ears, nose, oral 
cavity, thorax, abdomen, external genitalia, limbs and feet, respiratory and circulatory effects, autonomic 
effects such as salivation, nervous system effects including tremors, convulsions, reactivity to handling

and unusual behaviour. No mRNA-1273-related clinical findings were observed. Only few transient clinical 
findings were detected, which were not dose-responsive and were considered incidental and/or commonly 
seen within this animal strain, age and species. 
For local toxicity analysis, the injection sites were observed for erythema and oedema pre-dose, 24 and 
72 hours post-dose and weekly on non-dosing weeks. Oedema were observed at injection sites in the left 
and right hind limb in all mRNA-1273 vaccinated animals at approximately 24 hours post-dose, which 
recovered within 2-4 days after injection. In addition, two male mRNA-1273 vaccinated animals showed 
transient erythema at the injection site on the left hind limb on Day 58. 
The individual body weights were collected at receipt, prior to randomisation (Day -1), and once weekly 
during the study. The body weight changes were calculated for all animals between each weighting 
interval and for the entire dosing and recovery period. The food consumption was also calculated weekly. 
mRNA-1273-related body weight and body weight gain effects were not observed as well as no vaccine 
related effects on food consumption. The ophthalmology was analysed pre-treatment and prior to each 
scheduled necropsy. mRNA-1273-related ophthalmologic changes were not observed during this study. 
The rectal body temperature was measured prior to each dose, and 6 and 24 hours post each dose. No 
mRNA-1273-related body temperature changes were observed. 
The clinical pathology evaluation was conducted prior to scheduled terminal (Day 58) or recovery 
necropsy (Day 72). Haematology, coagulation marker, clinical chemistry and different acute phase 
proteins were analysed in the study animals. 
After the last vaccine injection on Day 58, white blood cells were increased in mRNA-1273-vaccinated 
males (1.47-fold) and females (1.42-fold). In particular, neutrophils (males: 4.46-fold, females: 5.29-
fold), eosinophils (males: 2.08-fold, females: 3.82-fold), basophils (males: 2.03-fold, females: 1.48-fold) 
and large unstained cells (males: 3.14-fold, females: 3.16-fold) were increased in the mRNA-1273-
vaccinated animals. In addition, lymphocytes (males: 0.85-fold, females: 0.8-fold), reticulocytes (males: 
0.7-fold, females: 0.8-fold) and platelets (males: 0.81-fold) were decreased in mRNA-1273-vaccinated 
animals. Most of these changes were transient and were not observed after the recovery period. 
However, eosinophils were still increased (males: 1.9-fold, females: 2.12-fold) at Day 72, but showed a 
trend to recovery. Also, lymphocyte counts in males were still slightly reduced (0.88-fold) after the 
recovery period. 
One day after the 3rd mRNA-1273 dose, fibrinogen was markedly increased in vaccinated males (2.62-
fold) and females (3.49-fold). In addition, prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time 
were increased in vaccinated females (PT: 1.06-fold, APTT: 1.31-fold). All coagulation changes were 
transient and resolved within the recovery period. 
At the terminal collection on Day 58, albumin (males: 0.96-fold, females: 0.88-fold) and albumin/globulin 
ratio (males: 0.76-fold, females: 0.75-fold) were slightly transiently decreased in mRNA-1273 vaccinated 
animals. Furthermore, globulin was slightly increased in mRNA-1273 vaccinated males (1.25-fold) and 
females (1.18-fold). In addition, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were 
increased in mRNA-1273 vaccinated females (AST: 1.37-fold, ALT: 2.26-fold), which were resolved at the 
end of the recovery period. In contrast, mRNA-1273 vaccinated males showed normal AST and ALT levels 
at Day 58 but increased levels at the end of the recovery period (AST: 1.3-fold, ALT: 1.88-fold). These 
findings in males were incidential and the increased AST and ALT levels were found in a single male. 
Moreover, urea nitrogen and creatinine were slightly increased in mRNA-1273-vaccinated males (UREAN: 
1.15-fold, CREAT: 1.19-fold). Urea was still slightly increased in males after the recovery period (1.15-
fold), but creatinine levels were normal in vaccinated males after the recovery period. 
Different acute phase proteins were analysed in the study animals. At the terminal collection, alpha-2-
macroglobulin was markedly increased in mRNA-1273 vaccinated males (78.99-fold) and females (36.71-
Assessment report  
EMA/896245/2022 
Page 105/191 
 
 
 
 
fold). After the recovery periode, the mean of alpha-2-macroglobulin was less increased in males (5.71-
fold) and females (1.72-fold) due to still markedly increased levels in two males and two females of the 
mRNA-1273 group. However, two control males and two control females of the recovery group showed 
also increased alpha-2-macroglobulin levels. In addition, mRNA-1273 vaccinated males (9.84-fold) and 
females (8.95-fold) showed increased alpha-1-acid glycoprotein levels at Day 58. This finding were 
transient and were resolved after the recovery period. Moreover, C-reactive protein levels were increased 
in males at the terminal collection (2.67-fold) and after the recovery period (2.26-fold). However, the 
CRP levels were very heterogenic in mRNA-1273 and control animals of the main and the recovery study. 
The immunogenicity of mRNA-1273 vaccine was analysed in an ELISA with serum samples of control and 
mRNA-1273 vaccinated rats. The serum IgG antibody analysis was not GLP-compliant. This assay should 
show the IgG antibody response against the SARS-CoV-2 pre-fusion stabilised Spike Protein (S2P) 
antigen. The samples were collected on Day 1 pre-dose, and on Day 58 and Day 72 prior to necropsy. 
After three doses of 40 µg mRNA-1273, vaccinated rats showed a strong IgG antibody titre against the 
S2P antigen in vaccinated rats on Day 58 prior termination (males: 90,130.4 antibody units/mL, females: 
271,604.2 antibody units/mL) and on Day 72 at the end of recovery (males: 270,963.8 antibody 
units/mL, females: 700,298.6 antibody units/mL). At Day72, the antibody titres were even higher. 
However, the IgG antibody titres on Day 58 and on Day 72 were significantly higher in females than in 
males. The antibody titres of the control animals were under the detection limit.  
After scheduled euthanasia on Day 58 and Day 72, an autopsy of the study animals was conducted 
including gross pathology, organ weight analysis and microscopic pathology. 
At Day 58 (terminal euthanasia), dark discoloration in the left gastrocnemius muscle adjacent to the 
injection site were observed in two mRNA-1273 vaccinated males that were considered as vaccine related 
by the MAH. However, similar finding were also observed in one control female. Other observed gross 
findings were considered as incidental, commonly observed in this strain and age of rats and/or were 
observed in control and vaccinated rats of this study. In the recovery euthanasia animals, no mRNA-
1273-related gross findings were observed. 
In the terminal euthanasia animals, slightly increased liver weights (males: 1.1-fold absolute, females: 
1.2-fold absolute) and spleen weights (males: 1.2-fold absolute, females: 1.3-fold absolute) were 
measured, which affected the absolute weight as well as relative to body and brain weight. In addition, 
adrenal gland weight was slightly increased in vaccinated males (1.16-fold absolute) and prostate gland 
was slightly increased in males (1.12-fold absolute). In vaccinated females of the main study group, the 
heart weight was slightly increased (1.14-fold absolute) and the ovary weight was increased (1.32-fold 
absolute). The latter finding was due to one female which heart weight was significantly increased. In the 
recovery animals, increased liver, spleen, adrenal gland, prostate gland and heart weights were not 
observed in the vaccinated animals. However, the absolute thymus weight in vaccinated males was 1.9-
fold increased due to a single male, which showed a significant heavier thymus. In addition, the 
thyroid/parathyroid weight was slightly decreased in recovery males (0.85-fold absolute) and females 
(0.83-fold absolute). Moreover, the uterus/cervix weight was slightly decreased in recovery females 
(0.79-fold, absolute). 
In terminal euthanasia animals, minimal increased haematopoietic cells were observed in the bone 
marrow of vaccinated females, minimal to moderate increased cellularity and minimal neutrophilic 
infiltration in iliac and inguinal lymph nodes of vaccinated males and females with a higher incidence and 
more severe of increased cellularity in iliac lymph nodes in males. In addition, minimal to moderate mixed 
and mononuclear cell inflammation were observed in the fascia of the sciatic nerve of vaccinated males 
and females. Moderate mixed cell inflammation was observed in the myofiber and fascia of the left 
gastrocnemius muscle of two vaccinated males and minimal haemorrhage in the left gastrocnemius 
muscle of one vaccinated male. Mixed cell inflammation at the injection sites were observed in vaccinated

males and females, which were minimal to mild in the 1st injection site and mild to marked in the 3rd 
injection site. In addition, minimal to moderate haemorrhage was observed in the 3rd injection site of 1 
male and 2 females of the vaccinated group. Furthermore, in the heart, minimal to mild mixed cell 
inflammation were observed in 2 vaccinated males and 1 control male, as well as minimal mononuclear 
cell infiltration in 3 vaccinated males, 2 control males and 1 vaccinated female. In addition, minimal 
haemorrhage was observed in the lung of 3 vaccinated males. One female was observed with a minimal 
necrosis in the liver on Day 58 and minimal to mild mononuclear cell infiltrations were observed in livers 
of females of mRNA-1273 and control group on Day 58. 
After the recovery, one vaccinated female showed still minimal increased cellularity in the iliac lymph 
node. Four vaccinated females and one control male showed minimal mononuclear cell infiltration and 
fascia at the sciatic nerve. Four vaccinated females and one vaccinated male showed minimal to mild 
mononuclear cell infiltration at the third injection site. Overall, the microscopic findings were significantly 
reduced in the recovery animals, which showed full or partly recovery of the findings observed at terminal 
euthanasia on Day 58.  
CHMP comment 
In this GLP-compliant repeat-dose toxicity study, rats were vaccinated intramuscularly 3x with 40 µg 
mRNA-1273. The intramuscular administration route was the same than the human administration route. 
Also, the formulation and concentration of the vaccine was comparable to the human vaccine formulation. 
However, the administered dose level was lower than the maximum human dose. The human adult dose 
level of mRNA-1273 is 100 µg for the primary vaccine series (2x doses) and 50 µg for the booster 
vaccination. The MAH justified the lower administered dose levels because 40 µg/dose in 0.2mL is the 
maximum injectable dose for this animal model. This justification can be accepted because the 
administered dose in the animal model exceeds already the dose:body weight ratio in rats (0.3 kg) 
compare to human (50 kg). 
The selected animal model, SD rats, is acceptable due to a large historical data set and the number of 
animals per group is adequate. 
The number of administered mRNA-1273 doses (3 doses) to rats can be accepted since this number of 
doses (2x primary series mRNA-1273 + 1x booster mRNA-1273) is recommended for most healthy 
adults. However, also a 4th dose of mRNA-1273 is already accepted for human use. It has to be noted, 
that mRNA-1273 is already approved in several countries, including in the EU, and clinical studies did not 
indicate significant severe toxicity issues.  
Toxicity study with the bivalent Omicron mRNA-1273.214 or the monovalent mRNA-1273.529 vaccine 
have been not conducted. This is accepted, because both Omicron variant vaccines are based on the 
same vaccine platform as the parent vaccine mRNA-1273 including the same composition of lipid 
nanoparticles. Thus, a significant difference in toxicity aspects is not expected.  
Acceptable local toxicity was shown. Oedema were observed at the injection sites in all mRNA-1273 
vaccinated animals, which recovered within few days. Erythema was only observed in two vaccinated 
males at the 3rd injection site. These findings indicate an acute inflammation and is commonly observed 
after vaccination.  
The local toxicity signs are in line with laboratory and pathological findings in the mRNA-1273 vaccinated 
animals. Increased white blood cell types, increased fibrinogen, decreased albumin/globulin ratio and 
increased acute phase protein concentrations are signs of an inflammatory response. Secondary to the 
inflammation response, the reticulocyte counts were decreased in the terminal euthanasia animals. In 
addition, necropsy of the vaccinated animals showed minimal to moderate inflammation at the injection

Page 107/191 
 
 
 
 
sites. Most of these findings were transient and not observed in the recovery animals. However, 
eosinophils were still slightly increased and minimal inflammation at the 3rd injection site of few animals 
were observed, indicating a subchronic inflammation. Moreover, lower lymphocytes counts were observed 
in vaccinated animals on Day 58. This might be stress-related. 
In addition, some vaccinated animals showed minimal haemorrhage at the injection sites or organs. 
These findings might be associated with minimal decreased platelets, increased prothrombin time and 
increased activated partial thromboplastin time. However, these findings were mainly observed in the 
terminal euthanasia group and not in the recovery group indicating a transient condition. 
The acute phase protein alpha-2-macroglobulin was markedly increased in mRNA-1273 vaccinated males 
and females, which is probably a sign of acute inflammation. After the recovery periode, alpha-2-
macroglobulin was less increased in males and females due to still markedly increased levels in two males 
and two females of the mRNA-1273 group. The increased alpha-2-macroglobulin concentrations in the 
recovery animals were considered vaccine related by the MAH. However, two control males and two 
control females of the recovery group showed also increased alpha-2-macroglobulin levels. Thus, the 
increased alpha-2-macroglobulin concentrations in the recovery animals are rather incidential findings or 
signs of general stress and probably not mRNA-1273-related.  
In vaccinated females, increased AST and ALT concentrations were observed at terminal analysis on Day 
58. In contrast, vaccinated males showed normal AST and ALT levels at the terminal analysis but 
increased concentrations after the recovery period. These findings might be associated with the increased 
liver weights in the vaccinated animals on Day 58 necropsy. However, severe pathological findings were 
not observed in the liver of these animals. Only one female had a minimal necrosis on Day 58 necropsy 
and minimal to mild mononuclear cell infiltrations were observed in livers of females of mRNA-1273 and 
control group on Day 58 necropsy. 
Furthermore, minimal to moderate increased cellularity was observed in iliac and inguinal lymph nodes in 
both sexes of vaccinated animals on Day 58 necropsy. These findings were resolved after the recovery, 
except in one female, which still showed minimal increased cellularity in the iliac lymph node. The 
findings in the lymph nodes might be associated with the increased spleen weight of vaccinated animals 
on Day 58 necropsy. These results are signs of an activated immune response typically observed after 
vaccination. 
The MAH could also demonstrate strong immunogenicity of 3 doses mRNA-1273 in rats. However, the 
S2P-specific IgG antibody titres on Day 58 and Day 72 were higher in females than in males indicating a 
stronger immune response in females. 
4.3.2.  CHMP’s overall conclusions on toxicology 
Overall, mRNA-1273 was well tolerated in rats and no severe or unexpected vaccine-related mortalities, 
clinical signs, severe changes in body weight or pathological findings were observed. All observed findings 
recovered fully or showed signs of improvement. 
Overall, the toxicity data package is acceptable. Because mRNA-1273.214 is based on the same mRNA 
vaccine-platform and LNP-formulation than mRNA-1273, and it is assumed that toxicity findings are 
primary based on the LNPs, no additional toxicity studies with mRNA-1273.214 are needed.  
In non-clinical pharmacodynamic studies in mice and NHPs, bivalent mRNA-1273.214 and monovalent 
mRNA-1273.529 Omicron-matched SARS-CoV-2 vaccines show sufficient immunogenicity against several 
VoC of SARS-CoV-2, including IgG binding antibody and neutralising antibody responses. In addition, one 
booster dose of mRNA-1273.529 shows protective effects against Wuhan and Omicron BA.1 infection by 
reducing significantly the viral load in the upper and lower respiratory tract of mice and NHPs. 
Assessment report

Furthermore, a repeat-dose toxicity study with mRNA-1273 and two pharmacokinetic studies with SM-102 
in rats showed no severe findings.  
From a non-clinical perspective, mRNA-1273.214 is considered approvable.

Sample size (Part G) 
The target enrolment was to be approximately 375 participants. It was assumed that 20% of participants 
were to be excluded from the PP Set for Immunogenicity – SARS-CoV-2 negative. With approximately 
300 participants in Part G and 300 participants in Part F, Cohort 2 in the PP Set for Immunogenicity and 
SARS-CoV-2 negative, there is approximately 71% global power to demonstrate the primary 
immunogenicity objectives with alpha of 0.025 (2-sided) at each time point (Day 29 and Day 91). The 
assumptions were: 
• 
• 
• 
the true GMR against the variant (B.1.1.529) is 1.5 
the true GMR against ancestral SARS-CoV-2 is 1 
the standard deviation of the log-transformed titre is 1.5 
The non-inferiority margin for GMR was set to 0.67.  
• 
the true SRR against B.1.1.529 as a second booster dose is 90% regardless of vaccine, i.e., SSR 
difference is 0 
The non-inferiority margin for SRR difference was set to -10%.  
Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
The study was a single arm multi-cohort open-label study; no randomisation or blinding was performed. 
Statistical hypotheses and multiplicity control (Part G) 
50 μg mRNA-1273.214 as the second booster dose was to be compared to 50 μg mRNA-1273 as the 
second booster dose (active control arm in Part F, Cohort 2). For the primary objective on immune 
response, there were 8 hypotheses in total. Four hypotheses were to be tested at Day 29: 
A.  H1
1: 50 μg mRNA-1273.214, as a second booster dose, against the variant B.1.1.529 is non-
inferior to the second booster dose of (50 μg) mRNA-1273 against B.1.1.529 based on the GMT 
ratio at Day 29 with a non-inferiority margin of 1.5. 
B.  H1
2: 50 μg mRNA-1273.214, as a second booster dose, against the variant B.1.1.529 is non-
inferior to the second booster dose of (50 μg) mRNA-1273 against B.1.1.529 based on the 
difference in SRR at Day 29 with a non-inferiority margin of 10%.  
C.  H1
3: 50 μg mRNA-1273.214, as a second booster dose, against ancestral SARS-CoV-2 is non-
inferior to the second booster dose of (50 μg) mRNA-1273 against ancestral SARSCoV-2 based on 
the GMT ratio at Day 29 with a non-inferiority margin of 1.5.

D.  H1
4: 50 μg mRNA-1273.214, as a second booster dose, against the variant B.1.1.529 is 
superior to the second booster dose of (50 μg) mRNA-1273 against B.1.1.529 based on the GMT 
ratio at Day 29. 
Analogously, these four hypotheses (labelled as H1
5 to H1
8) were to be tested at Day 91 in the same 
order. 
For the primary immunogenicity objective, an alpha of 0.05 (two-sided) was to be allocated to the two 
time points (Day 29 and Day 91). Day 29 and Day 91 each were to have an alpha of 0.025 (two-sided) 
for hypotheses testing. The primary immunogenicity objective was to be considered met if non-inferiority 
against B.1.1.529 based on GMR, SRR difference, and non-inferiority against ancestral SARS-CoV-2 based 
on GMR were demonstrated either at Day 29 or Day 91. 
The following figure depicts the hypotheses testing strategy. 
For the key secondary immunogenicity objective, there were 2 hypotheses to be tested (Day 29 and 
analogously at Day 91 (H1
10) will each have alpha of 0.025 [two-sided] for hypotheses testing): 
E.  H1
9: 50 μg mRNA-1273.214, as a second booster dose, against ancestral SARS-CoV-2 is non-
inferior to the booster dose of (50 μg) mRNA-1273 against ancestral SARS-CoV-2 based on the 
difference in SRR at Day 29 with a non-inferiority margin of 10%. 
Analysis sets: 
The analysis sets are described in the table below; the same definitions across Parts A (1, 2), B, C, D, F, 
and G were to apply when applicable.

Primary immunogenicity analyses  
The 50 μg mRNA-1273.214 booster dose (second booster dose) from Part G was to be assessed with 
respect to mRNA-1273 booster dose (second booster dose) from Part F, Cohort 2. The analysis methods 
described in Part F Cohort 1 were to be used for Part G as well. Essentially the following analyses were 
defined:  
An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model was to be used to assess the difference in immune response 
with antibody titers at Day 29 post-booster as dependent variable, and treatment group age group (< 65, 
≥ 65 years) and pre-booster antibody titer level as independent variables. The GMT was to be estimated 
by the geometric least squares mean (GLSM) from the model and its corresponding 95% was to be 
provided for each group. The GMR (ratio of GMTs) was to be estimated by the ratio of GLSM from the 
model together with the corresponding 95% CIs. Non-inferiority in GMR was to be considered 
demonstrated if the lower bound of the 97.5% of the GMR was ≥ 0.67 based on the non-inferiority 
margin of 1.5. If the lower bound of the CI was > 1 superiority was considered to be demonstrated. 
The number and percentage (rate) of participants achieving sero-response at Day 29 was to be 
summarised with 95% CI calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method for each group. The difference of

Page 111/191 
 
 
 
 
 
SRR between treatment groups was to be calculated with 95% CI based on Miettinen-Nurminen method. 
Non-inferiority in SRR was to be considered demonstrated if the lower bound of the 97.5% of the SRR 
difference was > -10% based on the non-inferiority margin of 10%. 
Other Immunogenicity Analyses 
SARS-CoV-2-specific bAb and nAb were to be assessed at multiple time points. For each of the antibodies 
of interest, e.g., levels of SARS-CoV-2–specific bAb and SARS-CoV-2-specific nAb, the GMT or level with 
corresponding 95% CI at each time point, and global mean fold rise (GMFR) of post-baseline/baseline 
titres or levels with corresponding 95% CI at each post-baseline time point was to be provided for each 
arm. The 95% CIs were to be calculated based on the t-distribution of the log-transformed values then 
back-transformed to the original scale for presentation.  
Subgroup analyses 
Immunogenicity was to be assessed in the following subgroups: 
•  Age (18 to < 65, and ≥ 65 years) 
•  Sex (female, male) 
•  Baseline/pre-booster SARS-CoV-2 status (negative, positive) if there is enough number of pre-
booster positives  
•  Race and ethnicity group (non-Hispanic White, communities of colour) 
Safety may be assessed for the same subgroups. 
Interim and final analyses 
Interim analyses were to be conducted based on safety and immunogenicity data collected through Day 
29. The interim analyses were potentially to be conducted either after all participants in G had completed 
their Day 29 visit assessments, and/or after subsequent time-point visits (Day 91). The final analysis of 
all endpoints was planned to be performed after all participants have completed all planned study 
procedures. The final CSR is planned to include full analyses of all safety and immunogenicity through 
Day 366 (Month 12). 
CHMP comment 
Sample size 
While the assumptions for the individual analyses are understood, the global power cannot be 
reproduced. It is noted that the CV or the average titre (log(μ)), which would usually be needed for 
sample size planning was not provided but only the expected GMR and standard deviation (log(σ)). In 
fact, the log(σ) value seems to be rather low and hence increases the power. Given that this is a planning 
issue and other assumptions might have been made, this not considered an issue of relevance for this 
procedure. 
Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
The MAH did not plan for any protective measures such as central (blinded) assessment of samples or a 
firewall to reduce bias and to avoid data driven decisions within an ongoing study. This is not considered 
state-of-the-art. The lack of randomisation complicates the interpretation of effectiveness data. 
Statistical Hypothesis and Multiplicity Control 
The provided multiple testing approach equally splits the significance level between time points (Day 29 
and Day 91). At each analysis time point 4 hypotheses were tested in a pre-defined order. It is 
understood that the first three NI-hypothesis (H1 to H3 and H5 to H7, respectively) were considered as co-
primary, i.e., the study would only be considered successful if all these null hypotheses were rejected at 
Assessment report  
EMA/896245/2022 
Page 112/191 
 
 
 
 
least at one visit. The additional superiority hypothesis for Omicron (B.1.1.529) was tested in a 
hierarchical fashion if the other hypothesis were rejected. This is methodologically acceptable and 
endorsed.  
It is noted, however, that this testing approach was only introduced late with Amendment 6. Given 
additional information provided upon request, the modification is considered acceptable and well justified 
(see Conduct of Study for more details).  
Analysis sets 
The analysis sets are overall endorsed. They lack clarity and their role is not always clear, though. For 
example, it is not fully clear what the difference the PPSI-neg and the PPS for efficacy is. For the sake of 
this procedure this is however not of key relevance. 
Primary immunogenicity analyses 
The primary analysis model for GMR was based on an ANCOVA model adjusting for age group and pre-
booster Ab-titre (of the assay corresponding to the outcome of interest). Titres were log-transformed in 
the model and results were back-transformed to the original scale, which is endorsed. This can be seen 
from the sample size considerations and the actual analyses but was not specified in the primary analysis 
methods (which is not endorsed). Titres between Part F, Cohort 2 (second booster with mRNA-1273) 
were used as comparator for Part G. This is endorsed.  
SRR and SRR differences were computed without adjustment. This is not optimal in this study design but 
acceptable given the minor role of SRR as compared to GMT/GMR. 
The NI-margins (1.5 or analogously 0.67 for GMR, and -10% for SRR) are acceptable. Subsequent 
superiority testing for Omicron specific Abs is considered of high relevance and hence endorsed as well. 
Lack of definition of the primary endpoints / estimands 
It is noted that nowhere in the protocol the primary endpoints were well-defined. It is not clear based on 
which assay and at which cut-off the primary immunogenicity hypotheses were to be tested. Only in 
Cohort A.1 it was stated that “Pseudotyped virus neutralising antibody will be used as the basis to assess 
non-inferiority in immune response. The assays that will be used to assess the immune response to 
vaccination will be described in the SAP.” No corresponding definition was made for any other cohort. 
Whether PsVNA50 or PsVNA80 was planned to be used as primary was defined nowhere. The SAP lacks 
the promised description of assays to be used.  
In the presented Clinical Overview, ID50 nAb titres as measured by the PsVNA with were used. As there 
are other assays (e.g. the MSD multiplex for bAbs), and other cut-offs (ID80 for PsVNA) this might have 
been a data driven choice. It seems that after the fact this is not an issue as results seem well aligned. 
However, at the planning stage this potentially increases flexibility and the chance to win (in any of the 
endpoints). This hence might inflate the type 1 error. Overall, given the results and endpoints in previous 
procedures the issue is considered minor at this stage. A better planning and pre-specification is strongly 
advised for future trials, though.  
Subgroup analyses 
Subgroups age, sex, baseline SARS-CoV-2 status and race/ethnicity as pre-specified in the protocol are 
considered acceptable. Results in the key subgroups age and SARS-CoV-2 status were provided. Results 
for sex as well as race/ethnicity were provided upon request.

Conduct of study (key changes) 
•  Arm F was first introduced with Amendment 4 (04 Jan 2022). At that time the mRNA-1273 arm 
in Cohort 2 was not yet included but two doses (50 and 100μg) of mRNA-1273.529 were to be 
studied as either first (cohort 1) or second booster (cohort 2; making it 4 arms altogether).  
•  With Amendment 5 (10 Feb 2022) the higher dose of 100μg in both cohorts of Arm F was 
removed, the mRNA-1273 arm in Cohort 2 and Part G were added. 
•  With Amendment 6 (17 Mar 2022) the statistical testing approach for Part G was modified by 
moving the GMT superiority hypothesis from the second to the fourth place in the hierarchy and 
by adding a non-inferiority hypothesis for SRR as second hypothesis instead. The same 
hypotheses were newly added for Day 91 and alpha was equally split between Day 29 and Day 
91.  
•  Amendment 7 (26 Apr 2022) introduced a new Subpart A.2 (second booster dose with mRNA-
1273.214 after a booster dose with mRNA-1273.211), which is not of interest to the current 
procedure.  
CHMP comment 
Upon request all protocols starting with the first relevant Amendment 4 and all SAP versions were 
provided allowing a better understanding of the changes in the ongoing study. 
It is noted that the modification of the hierarchy in primary hypothesis was made quite late with 
Amendment 6 (17 Mar 2022) in an open label study and given that the data cut-off (27 Apr 2022) 
was only shortly after these changes. The MAH further provided the number of subjects enrolled, with 
Day 29 visit and with available immunogenicity data by the date of PA6 upon request (see Table 
below). This data shows that the changes are apparently not data driven and hence acceptable.  
The addition of primary endpoints at Day 91 was justified upon request with accumulating data from a 
related (first) booster cohort using a Beta-containing bivalent vaccine candidate (mRNA-1273.211) 
which showed enhanced nAb persistence against various strains (Beta, Omicron, Delta and the 
ancestral virus). As this would indeed be considered as a clinically relevant benefit per se the inclusion 
of a later time point to the primary endpoints is well understood. Overall, the changes to the hierarchy 
and regarding multiplicity adjustment are understood and acceptable.

mRNA-1273.214 50 μg (P205 Part G) Compared with mRNA-1273 50 μg (P205 Part F) 
The primary immunogenicity objective of Study mRNA-1273 P205 Part G was to compare the 
immunogenicity of mRNA-1273.214 50 μg when administered as a second booster dose (in adults who 
previously received the 2-dose primary mRNA-1273 100 μg vaccine series and a booster dose of 50 μg 
mRNA-1273) to the immunogenicity of mRNA-1273 50 μg as the second booster (in adults who previously 
received the 2-dose primary mRNA-1273 100 μg vaccine series and a booster dose of 50 μg mRNA-1273) 
in Study P205 Part F, Cohort 2.  
In the primary analysis set (PPSI-Neg), the observed GMT (95% CI) against Omicron GMTs pre-booster 
were 298.1 (258.8, 343.5) and increased to 2372.4 (2070.6, 2718.2) at 28 days after the booster dose 
for mRNA-1273.214 and geometric mean fold rise GMFR (95% CI) for the GMTs at 28 days after the 
booster compared to pre booster was 8.0 (7.2, 8.8). In comparison, the GMT (95% CIs) was 1473.5 
(1270.8, 1708.4) in the mRNA-1273 at 28 days after the booster dose and GMFR (95% CI) was 4.4 (4.0, 
5.0). The observed GMT (95% CI) against ancestral pre-booster were 1266.7 (1120.2, 1432.5) and 
increased to 5977.3 (5321.9, 6713.3) at 28 days after the booster dose for mRNA-1273.214 and GMFR 
Assessment report

Page 115/191 
 
 
 
 
(95% CI) for the GMTs at 28 days after the booster compared to pre-booster was 4.7 (4.4, 5.1). In 
comparison, the GMT (95% Cis was 5649.3 (5056.8, 6311.2) in the mRNA-1273 group at 28 days after 
the booster dose and GMFR (95% CI) was 3.7 (3.4, 4.0).  
In the primary analysis set (PPSI - Neg), estimated neutralising antibody GMTs (95% CI) against 
ancestral SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) adjusted for pre-booster titer and age group were 6422.3 (5990.1, 
6885.7) and 5286.6 (4887.1, 5718.9) 28 days after the mRNA-1273.214 and mRNA 1273 booster doses, 
respectively, and the GMR (97.5% CI) was 1.22 (1.08, 1.37), meeting the pre specified criterion for non-
inferiority (lower bound of CI ≥0.67) (Table 10).  
The Omicron SRRs (95% CI) were 100% (98.9, 100) and 99.2% (97.2, 99.9), 28 days after the mRNA-
1273.214 and mRNA-1273 booster doses, respectively, and the SRR difference (97.5% CI) was 1.5% (-
1.1, 4.0) meeting the non-inferiority criterion (lower bound of CI >-10%).  
The neutralising antibody GMTs (95% CI) against Omicron were 2479.9 (2264.5, 2715.8) and 1421.2 
(1283.0, 1574.4) 28 days following the mRNA 1273.214 and mRNA-1273 booster doses, respectively, 
and the GMR (97.5% CI) was 1.75 (1.49, 2.04) met the pre-specified superiority criterion (lower bound of 
CI >1).  
Therefore, all primary immunogenicity endpoints were met based on the pre-specified testing sequence. 
The SRR (95% CI) against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) was 100% (98.9, 100 and 98.6, 100) 28 
days after the mRNA 1273.214 and mRNA-1273 booster doses, respectively, with an SRR difference of 0. 
Therefore, the key secondary immunogenicity objective was also met (Table 14).

A sensitivity analysis which excluded participants who had SARS-CoV-2 infection after the booster dose 
and up to Day 29 was also performed and the results were consistent with the primary analysis. A 
supportive immunogenicity analysis was also performed taking into account all participants regardless of 
evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (PPSI population regardless of SARS CoV-2 infection status at 
pre-booster baseline) and results were consistent with the primary immunogenicity analysis (Table 52). 
The GMR and SRR difference results are summarised below. 
• Ancestral SARS-CoV-2 (D614G): The Day 29 GMR for mRNA1273.214 50 μg booster dose versus the 
mRNA-1273 50 μg booster dose was 1.237 (97.5% CI: 1.117, 1.369) (lower bound CI >1). The 
estimated SRR difference 50 μg mRNA-1273.214 booster dose and the mRNA-1273 50 μg booster dose 
against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 was 0% (97.5% CI: cannot be calculated) at Day 29. 
• Omicron: The Day 29 GMR for mRNA-1273.214 50 μg booster dose versus the mRNA-1273 50 μg 
booster dose was 1.781 (97.5% CI: 1.557, 2.037), (lower bound CI >1). The estimated SRR difference 
50 μg mRNA-1273.214 booster dose and the mRNA-1273 50 μg booster dose against the Omicron variant 
was 1.2% (97.5% CI: -1.3, 3.7) at Day 29 (lower bound of CI > -10%).

and mRNA-1273 50 μg Administered as Second Booster Doses – Per-Protocol Immunogenicity Set 
(Participants with and without prior SARS-Cov-2 Infection) (Supportive Analysis) 
In addition, a pre-planned subgroup immunogenicity analysis was also performed to assess the 
consistency of the immunogenicity results in participants with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection at 
pre-booster (Table 12). Based on this subgroup analysis, results in participants with SARS-CoV-2 
infection prior to the booster vaccination are consistent with the immunogenicity results of the primary 
analysis in that mRNA-1273.214 elicited higher neutralising antibody responses compared to mRNA-1273. 
The GMR and SRR difference results are summarised below. 
• Ancestral SARS-CoV-2 (D614G): The Day 29 GMR for mRNA1273.214 50 μg booster dose versus the 
mRNA-1273 50 μg booster dose was 1.272 (97.5% CI: 1.070, 1.512). The estimated SRR difference 50

Addendum A: Immunogenicity Comparison of mRNA-1273.214 50 μg with mRNA-1273 50 μg 
Against the Omicron Subvariants BA.4, BA.5 
The purpose of this addendum is to provide updated information on the neutralising antibody response 
against the Omicron subvariants BA.4, BA.5 elicited by the Omicron BA.1-containing bivalent vaccine 
mRNA-1273.214 50 μg (study mRNA-P205 part G) and by mRNA-1273 50 μg (mRNA-P205 part F, cohort 
2) and to perform a GMR-based comparison of the antibody response between the two groups. The

Overview - .214 M2.5, Section 2.5.5.2.1.1.2; included the neutralising antibody titers only after the 
mRNA-1273.214 booster dose (and not after the mRNA-1273 booster dose) because the antibody results 
for the mRNA-1273 were not available at the time the overview was prepared. The Omicron subvariants 
BA.4, BA.5 have currently become the dominant circulating subvariants in multiple geographies.  
Based on the results provided in the addendum: 
i. mRNA-1273.214 50 μg elicited superior neutralising antibody responses against the Omicron 
subvariants BA.4, BA.5 compared to mRNA-1273 50 μg (nominal alpha of 0.05). 
ii. The BA.4, BA.5 neutralising antibody response was consistently higher in the mRNA-1273.214 group 
compared to the mRNA-1273 group in participants with and without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
iii. The BA.4, BA.5 neutralising antibody response was consistent across age groups, 18-65 years old and

Overall, the results in the Overview - .214 M2.5 and in the addendum indicate that the bivalent Omicron 
BA.1-containing vaccine mRNA-1273.214 50 μg elicits superior neutralising antibody responses against 
Omicron BA.1 and BA.4, BA.5, compared to mRNA-1273 50 μg, regardless of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection 
and across age groups. Table A presents the summary of the observed neutralising antibody GMTs and 
GMFRs against the Omicron BA.4, BA.5 for participants who received either the mRNA-1273.214 50 μg 
booster vaccine (part G) or mRNA-1273 50 μg booster vaccine (part F) as a second booster dose (4th 
dose). All participants previously received 2 doses of mRNA-1273 100 μg as the primary series vaccine 
followed by the booster dose of mRNA-1273 50 μg dose as the 1st booster vaccine) in the PPSI, PPSI – 
Neg, and PPSI – Pos populations. In the primary analysis set (PPSI – Neg, reflecting participants without 
prior SARS-CoV-2 infection), the observed GMTs (95% CI) against Omicron BA.4, BA5 GMTs (95% CI) 
pre-booster were 115.6 (98.5, 135.6) and increased to 727.4 (632.8, 836.1) at 28 days after the booster 
dose for mRNA-1273.214 with a GMFR (95% CI) of 6.3 (5.7, 6.9). The GMTs (95% CIs) were 139.7 
(119.5, 163.3) pre-booster and 492.1 (431.1, 561.9) in the mRNA-1273 at 28 days after the booster 
dose and GMFR (95% CI) was 3.5 (3.2, 3.9). The GMR (95% CI) for the comparison of mRNA-1273.214 
50 μg booster dose with the mRNA-1273 50 μg booster dose was 1.69 (1.51, 1.90) with the lower bound 
of the CI > 1. In the PPSI – Pos population (reflecting participants with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection), the 
pre-booster GMTs (95% CI) against Omicron BA.4, BA.5 subvariant were 719.5 (531.6, 973.9) which 
increased to 2337.4 (1825.5, 2992.9) 28 days after the mRNA-1273.214 booster dose with a GMFR (95% 
CI) of 3.2 (2.8, 3.8). The GMTs (95% CIs) were 609.1 (448.1, 828.1) pre-booster and 1270.8 (987.3, 
1635.8) in the mRNA-1273 group at 28 days after the booster dose and GMFR (95% CI) was 2.1 (1.8, 
2.4). The GMR (95% CI) for the comparison of mRNA-1273.214 50 μg booster dose with the mRNA-1273 
50 μg booster dose was 1.60 (1.34, 1.91) with a lower bound of the CI > 1. 
Lastly, in the PPSI population (participants with and without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection), the pre-booster 
GMT (95% CI) against Omicron BA.4, BA.5 subvariant was 172.7 (147.4, 202.3) which increased to 940.6 
(826.3, 1070.6) 28 days after the mRNA-1273.214 booster dose with a GMFR (95% CI) of 5.4 (5.0, 5.9). 
The GMTs (95% CIs) were 209.3 (179.5, 244.1) pre-booster and 645.4 (570.1, 730.6) in the mRNA-1273 
group at 28 days after the booster dose and GMFR (95% CI) was 3.1 (2.8, 3.3). The GMR (95% CI) for 
the comparison of mRNA-1273.214 50 μg booster dose with the mRNA-1273 50 μg booster dose was 
1.68 (1.52, 1.84) with a lower bound of the CI > 1.

Therefore, in all participants, regardless of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, mRNA-1273.214 50 μg elicited 
superior neutralising antibody responses against the Omicron subvariants BA.4, BA.5 compared to mRNA 
1273 50 μg (nominal alpha of 0.05). The MAH claims that results were also consistent across age groups, 
18-65 years old and above 65 years.

CHMP comment: 
Of note, the Clinical Overview 2.5.3 Overview of Clinical Pharmacology, p. 36 reads: “The Omicron BA.4 
and BA.5 sub-lineages were chosen for the development of a research-grade pseudovirus neutralisation 
assay using a spike-pseudotyped virus designated BA.4/BA.5 given that the BA.4 and BA.5 sub lineages 
have an identical spike sequence. The assay was performed in a manner consistent with the BA.1 
pseudovirus neutralisation assay. However, range, dilutional linearity, precision and limits of 
quantification have yet to be determined.” Upon request the MAH confirmed that PsVNAs against delta 
variant and Omicron variants were not validated at the time of testing but were considered to be qualified 
“fit-for-purpose”. As a general rule, providing results from assays that are not validated for the purpose 
of a MAA is not acceptable. Given the short timelines for generation of results against Omicron variants 
BA.4, BA.5 together with prior experience with the validated PsVNA against D614G, results from the 
PsVNA against Omicron variants can be considered acceptable for the time being. The MAH is requested 
to provide the PsVNA validation reports for Omicron variants BA.1 and BA.4, BA.5 once available. The 
reports are expected to be signed prior to further analyses for Day 91 interim analysis. (REC)

In all these population settings booster vaccination with mRNA-1273.214 results in higher nAB GMTs 
against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain and Omicron variants BA.1 and BA.4, BA.5 compared to booster 
vaccination with mRNA-1273. 
nAB GMTs after booster vaccination with mRNA-1273.214 are lower for BA.1 and again lower against 
BA.4, BA.5 as compared to nAB GMTs against ancestral SARS-CoV-2. Booster vaccination with mRNA-
1273.214 efficiently elicits nAB GMTs against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2, however, it is rather unexpected 
that mRNA-1273.214 elicits higher nAB GMTs against ancestral SARS-CoV-2 as compared to booster 
vaccination with mRNA-1273. 
The figure below depicts the results provided for nAB GMTs at Baseline and on Day 29 in the age groups 
≥18 to <65 years of age as compared to ≥65 years of age (PPIS-neg). There are no sub-group (age) 
results available on nAB GMTs against variant Omicron BA.4, BA.5 after vaccination with mRNA-1273.

There is a tendency of higher nAB GMTs in the elderly population ≥65 years of age. This is rather 
unexpected and difficult to interpret, but might be at least partly explainable by the fact that also the 
baseline titers are somewhat higher in elderly. Most importantly, these results confirm that also in the 
elderly population a very good immune response increase is induced by the 2nd booster dose. 
The figure below illustrates the observed GMTs by race in the PPIS-negative.

(additional tables provided by the MAH upon request). 
In PPIS-negative the pattern of nAB GMTs is overall comparable throughout all sub-groups. Vaccination 
with mRNA-1273.214 and mRNA-1273 increases the nAB GMTs against ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and variant 
Omicron BA.1 in all sub-groups as compared to baseline GMTs. In all sub-groups in the PPIS-negative 
nAB GMTs after vaccination with mRNA-1273.214 were higher as compared to GMTs after vaccination 
with mRNA-1273. The PPIS-negative excludes the influence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection on the nAB 
GMTs.  
The pattern of nAB GMTs in PPIS-all (results not provided in a figure) is basically comparable in White, 
Hispanic or Latino, and Not Hispanic or Latino groups. In the group of Black subjects and the group of 
Other the nAB GMTs after vaccination with mRNA-1273 are higher compared to nAB GMTs after 
vaccination with mRNA-1273.214. The numbers of subjects in these groups were rather small (N=30; 
N=26 and N=22; N=25, respectively) and prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 would have significant impact 
on the nAB GMTs in these small groups which may account for these differences. Therefore, results from 
analysis of PPIS-negative is considered more meaningful for a sub-group analysis. 
The figure below shows the observed nAB GMTs in PPIS-neg by sex.

Data source: t140201012508, table 14.2.1.1.25.8 
Vaccination with mRNA-1273.214 or mRNA-1273 elicits an increase in nAB GMTs in both sub-groups, 
male and female. In female the pattern of nAB GMTs after vaccination with mRNA-1273.214 or mRNA-
1273 is as expected, with higher nAB GMTs after vaccination with mRNA-1273.214. Vaccination with 
mRNA-1273 results in higher nAB GMTs on Day 29 in male compared to nABs after vaccination with 
mRNA-1273.214 (red arrow). Results from the PPIS-negative are shown which excludes an influence on 
prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. The numbers of the sub-groups are not obviously too small (N=145 vs. 
N=126). The CIs are largely overlapping for nAB GMTs on Day 29 in male (GM Level 6144.836; 95% CI 
5081.693; 7430.401 vs. GM Level 6616.689; 95% CI 5618.470; 7792.260), indicating a comparable 
capacity in eliciting nAB GMTs by any of the vaccines. While this concerns the question on non-inferiority 
of mRNA-1273.214 against ancestral SARS-CoV-2 in male population this is not considered an issue. 
Nonetheless, it would have been expected to be discussed by the MAH. 
The figure below depicts the observed Geometric Mean Fold Ratios (GMFRs) pre-booster vs. Day 29 post 
booster vaccination, and Geometric Mean Ratios between vaccinations with mRNA-1273.214 vs. mRNA-
1273 for the different PPISs.

nAB GMTs and corresponding GMFRs are consistently higher after vaccination with mRNA-1273.214 as 
compared to vaccination with mRNA-1273 against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain and Omicron variants 
BA.1 and BA.4, BA.5. Values for GMFRs depend on the baseline values and therefore the nominal 
reduction of GMFRs from PPIS-neg > PPIS-all > PPIS-pos is expected. 
The primary definition of seroresponse is defined as ≥ 4 × LLOQ for those with pre-dose 1 of primary 
series baseline < LLOQ; ≥ 4-foldrise for those with pre-dose 1 of primary series baseline ≥ LLOQ. For 
Part F Cohort 2 and Part G, seroresponse rate (SRR) are based on the primary definition when comparing 
with the mRNA-1273 primary series. Therefore, seroresponse is considered for those subjects who have a 
GMT of ≥ 4 x LLOQ in this interim analysis. This definition is not appropriate for the characterisation of a 
booster vaccination and resulting SRR positivity cannot be considered clinically meaningful. 
In summary, provided results indicate that the bivalent Omicron BA.1-containing vaccine mRNA-1273.214 
50 μg elicits superior neutralising antibody responses against Omicron BA.1 and BA.4, BA.5, compared to 
mRNA-1273 50 μg, regardless of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
Exploratory Immunogenicity Analyses 
Observed Neutralising Antibody Titers for Beta and Delta Variants on First 50 Participants 
An exploratory immunogenicity analysis to assess neutralisation against the Beta and Delta variants was 
performed based on the first 50 enrolled participants in each group (mRNA-1273.214 50 μg in Study 
P205 Part G and mRNA-1273 50 μg in P205 Part F). Only 50 participants were included without selection 
of representativeness to the whole population in order to expedite the availability of the data. The 
exploratory summary results are shown for a subset of the group of participants without evidence of prior 
SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=33 for mRNA-1273.214 50 μg, n=40 for mRNA-1273 50 μg) at pre-booster

(Table 55) and for all 50 participants regardless of SARS-CoV-2 infection status at pre-booster (Table 56). 
The booster of 50 μg of mRNA-1273.214 elicited a neutralising antibody response against these two 
variants that are not contained in the vaccine. While the pre-booster titers for Beta and Delta were lower 
for the mRNA-1273.214 compared to mRNA-1273 in the group of participants without evidence of prior 
SARS-CoV-2 infection, the MAH claims that the post-booster titers between the two vaccines are 
comparable (overlapping confidence intervals), and the GMFR was numerically higher in the mRNA-
1273.214 group versus the mRNA-1273 arm. The whole cohorts were able to be tested for multiple 
variants in the MSD assay because the multiplex nature of this assay allowed a higher throughput and 
more timely data availability.  
The MAH explains that these exploratory analysis results (Beta, Delta) are to be interpreted with caution 
due to the small group of participants and differences in pre-booster titer in Beta and Delta between two 
treatment groups. This small dataset was intended to provide directional information.

Protocol Immunogenicity Set) (Exploratory Analysis) 
CHMP comment: 
In P205 part F and part G binding antibody titers against different variants (ancestral, Alpha, Beta, Delta, 
Gamma and Omicron) have been analysed for the per-protocol immunogenicity set while neutralising 
antibodies against variants Beta and Delta have been analysed in samples from <50 subjects. The results 
are controversial in particular for variant Delta. The MAH was asked if additional analyses are planned on 
neutralising antibodies against variants Beta and Delta. 
MAH response: The MAH would like to clarify that testing against the Beta and Delta variant in small 
groups (mRNA-1273.214: n=33; mRNA-1273, n=40) was intended to confirm neutralisation by mRNA-
1273.214 against these two variants and these results were not intended for comparisons between 
groups. The pre-booster titers of these two small groups are different. Specifically, the mRNA-1273 group 
pre-booster titers are numerically higher (Beta: x2.38 higher [694 vs. 291]; Delta: x1.82 higher [716 vs. 
393]), and given that there is a strong correlation between pre-booster and Day 29 titers, it is not 
suitable to directly compare the Day 29 titers for the mRNA-1273 and the mRNA-1273.214 groups. In 
sum, no conclusions can be drawn from the small group exploratory neutralising antibody data for Beta 
and Delta. We are unable to accommodate full cohort testing for mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.214 for in 
the Beta and Delta PsVNA assays due to the relatively low throughput of the assay. Testing for Omicron 
BA. 4/5 (provided already) and Omicron BA 2.75 (in development) in PsVNA have been prioritised 
instead. The testing of the full cohorts using the multi-plex MSD assay which includes Beta, Delta as well 
as Alpha and Gamma is tended to provide assurance about the benefit of mRNA-1273.214 across 
variants. 
It is understood that due to the nature of the PsVNA there are capacity constraints and analysis of 
currently circulating VOCs such as Omicron BA.2.75 shall be prioritised. This explanation and ranking is 
endorsed. It is noted that vaccination with both mRNA.1273 and mRNA-1273.214 does elicit nABs against 
SARS-CoV-2 variants Beta and Delta. The extent to which nABs against variants Beta and Delta are

elicited remains unknown from this analysis but would roughly be expected to be in the same range due 
to overlapping CIs.

Delta, Gamma, and Omicron after the mRNA-1273.214 50 μg and mRNA-1273 50 μg Second 
Booster Doses Variants 
An immunogenicity analysis was performed based on binding antibody data after the mRNA-1273.214 50 
μg and mRNA-1273 50 μg second booster doses (Day 29) from the full cohorts to evaluate the binding 
antibody response against multiple variants, including variants that are not contained in the mRNA 
1273.214 booster vaccine (Alpha, Gamma, Beta, and Delta). The results indicate that mRNA-1273.214 
elicited a broad binding antibody response against multiple variants. mRNA-1273.214 booster elicited a 
higher antibody response compared to mRNA-1273 booster.

mRNA-1273.214 50 μg and mRNA-1273 50 μg against the ancestral SARS-Cov-2, Alpha, Beta, Delta, 
Gamma and Omicron for all participants regardless of evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (per 
protocol immunogenicity set regardless of participants being SARS-CoV-2 positive or negative at pre 
booster). The following summarises the GMR results shown in Table 17: 
•  Ancestral SARS-CoV-2: The Day 29 GMR for mRNA1273.214 50 μg booster dose versus the 
mRNA1273 50 μg booster dose was 1.138 (95% CI: 1.068, 1.213). 
•  Alpha: The Day 29 GMR for mRNA1273.214 50 μg booster dose versus the mRNA1273 50 μg 
booster dose was 1.165 (95% CI: 1.093, 1.241). 
•  Beta: The Day 29 GMR for mRNA1273.214 50 μg booster dose versus the mRNA1273 50 μg 
booster dose was 1.142 (95% CI: 1.071, 1.217). 
•  Delta: The Day 29 GMR for mRNA1273.214 50 μg booster dose versus the mRNA1273 50 μg 
booster dose was 1.095 (95% CI: 1.031, 1.163). 
•  Gamma: The Day 29 GMR for mRNA1273.214 50 μg booster dose versus the mRNA1273 50 μg 
booster dose was 1.160 (95% CI: 1.087, 1.238). 
•  Omicron: The Day 29 GMR for mRNA1273.214 50 μg booster dose versus the mRNA1273 50 μg 
booster dose was 1.232 (95% CI: 1.149, 1.321). 
mRNA-1273.214 50 μg booster dose met superiority at Day 29, compared to mRNA-1273 50 μg, based 
on GMR (lower bound 95% CI >1) at nominal alpha of 0.05 for all variants tested. An analysis with 
binding antibody immunogenicity was also performed with participants with no evidence of prior SARS 
CoV-2 infection at pre-booster and the results were consistent with the analysis performed with all 
participants (regardless of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection) (Table 58).

mRNA-1273.211 50 μg (P205 Part A) Compared to mRNA-1273 50 μg (P201 Part B) 
While the MAH is seeking authorisation of the bivalent Omicron-containing booster vaccine mRNA 
1273.214 50 μg, the immunogenicity results of the Beta-containing bivalent booster vaccine mRNA 
1273.211 50 μg are summarised in this section as supportive information. The mRNA-1273.211 results 
also show that a bivalent booster vaccine that retains the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mRNA 
sequence and also includes the spike protein of a divergent variant can induce an enhanced and durable 
neutralising antibody response, compared to the booster vaccine mRNA-1273.  
As previously described in Section 2.5.1.5, of the Clinical Overview the primary immunogenicity objective 
of Study mRNA-1273 P205 Part A was to compare the immunogenicity results of mRNA-1273.211 as the 
first booster dose (administered to adults who previously received the 2-dose primary mRNA-1273 
vaccine series) to the immunogenicity induced after a 2-dose primary series of mRNA-1273 in Study 
P301; these results are presented in Module 5.3.5.1 Study P205 Part A Interim Analysis Report.  
In addition, a pre-specified immunogenicity objective was to compare the antibody response of the 50 μg 
mRNA-1273.211 booster vaccine (P205 Part A) to the antibody response of the 50 μg mRNA-1273 
booster vaccine (external comparator group from study mRNA-1273-P201 Part B). The following sections 
summarise this booster-to-booster comparison.  
Based on the results from P205 Part A described in this section, the neutralising antibody response 
elicited by the mRNA-1273.211 50 μg booster vaccine against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and the Beta,

Omicron and Delta variants was superior compared to that after the mRNA-1273 50 μg booster dose, 28 
days as well as 181 days after administration of the booster dose (nominal alpha of 0.05). 
CHMP comment: 
Given the overall lower nAB GMTs against variants Omicron BA.1 and Omicron BA.4, BA.5 as compared to 
ancestral SARS-CoV-2 nAB GMTs, investigating the durability of the immune response is of particular 
value. In this respect, results from P205 Part A (bivalent original / Beta variant vaccine mRNA-1273.211) 
can be considered supportive. The upcoming interim analysis on Day 91 for study P205 Parts F and G is 
considered essential to address durability of the response after vaccination with mRNA-1273.214 and 
shall be submitted immediately upon availability.

Summary of Seroresponse Rate Differences to Ancestral SARS-CoV-2, Beta, Delta, and Omicron 
Variants 
The SRR difference between the two booster vaccines (50 μg mRNA-1273.211 from Study P205 Part A 
versus 50 μg mRNA-1273 from Study P201 Part B) was estimated using stratified Miettinen-Nurminen 
method adjusted for age groups. As noted in Section 2.5.3, the SRR for the Delta variant are not included 
because the Delta assay is fit-for-purpose at present. The analysis was performed against ancestral, Beta,

and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 and the results are summarised in Table 20. The following summarises the 
results: 
•  Beta: The estimated SRR difference between the 50 μg mRNA-1273.211 booster dose and mRNA-
1273 50 μg booster dose against the Beta variant was -1.2% (95% CI: -4.0, 1.7) at Day 29 and 
14.5% (95% CI: 6.9, 22.2) at Day 181. The mRNA-1273.211 50 μg booster dose met non-
inferiority at Day 29 (lower bound of 95% CI > -10% to ≤ 0), and met superiority at Day 181 
(lower bound of 95% CI > 0), at nominal alpha of 0.05. 
•  Ancestral SARS-CoV-2: The estimated SRR difference 50 μg mRNA-1273.211 booster dose and 
the mRNA-1273 50 μg booster dose against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 was 0.0% (95% CI: -2.5, 
2.6) at Day 29 and 0.8% (95% CI: -2.7, 4.3) at Day 181. The mRNA-1273.211 50 μg booster

CHMP comment: 
PsVNA nAB GMTs after vaccination with the bivalent vaccine mRNA-1273.211 was compared to GMTs 
after vaccination with mRNA-1273 as a 1st booster dose. Vaccination with mRNA-1273.211 showed 
superiority over vaccination with mRNA-1273 based on GMRs for all variants tested (see results as 
provided above). The figure below depicts the PsVNA nAB observed GMTs against ancestral SARS-CoV-2 
as well as against variants Beta, Delta and Omicron BA.1.

SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Symptomatic Infection 
SARS-CoV-2 Incidence Rates After the mRNA-1273.214 and mRNA-1273 Booster Vaccines 
Summary of symptomatic (per primary and per secondary case definition) and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-
2 infections are provided. Infections were counted starting 14 days after the booster doses (mRNA-
1273.214 50 μg, mRNA-1273 50 μg) through the follow-up time of this interim analysis (Table 21).  
The P205 study was not designed to evaluate booster vaccine effectiveness and occurrence of infections 
after the booster doses reflects the epidemiological environment in the US where Omicron proportion of 
isolates predominated between March through April 2022 with the majority of the isolates being BA1.1 in 
early March transitioning to BA.2 in early April and subsequently identifying BA2.12.1 comprising 50% of 
isolates by end of April.  
In the mRNA-1273.214 50 μg booster dose group, with a median of 43 days of follow-up duration, 11 
participants (3.2%) had SARS-CoV-2 infection starting at least 14 days after the 50 μg booster dose. 
Among the 11 participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 4 participants (1.2%) met the primary case 
definition of COVID-19 and 5 participants (1.5%) met the secondary case definition of COVID-19. The 
remaining 6 participants (1.8%) had an asymptomatic infection. The exposure adjusted incidence rate for

SARS-CoV-2 infection was 5.4 per 1000 person weeks, 1.9 per 1000 person-weeks for the primary case 
definition of COVID- 19, 2.4 per 1000 person-weeks for the secondary case definition of COVID-19, and 
2.9 per 1000 person-weeks for asymptomatic SARS-CoV 2 infection. Among participants in the mRNA-
1273.214 50 μg group who met the primary and/or secondary case definition of COVID-19, onset day 
ranged from Day 7 to Day 36. No participants with COVID-19 had an emergency room visit or 
hospitalisation due to the COVID-19 event.  
In the mRNA 1273 50 μg booster dose group, with a median of 57 days of follow-up duration, 5 
participants (1.9%) had SARS-CoV-2 infection starting at least 14 days after the 50 μg booster dose. 
Among the 5 participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 1 participant (0.4%) met both the primary case 
definition of COVID-19 and the secondary case definition of COVID-19 36 days after the booster dose. 
The remaining 4 participants had an asymptomatic infection (Listing 16.2.6.3.1.2.8). The exposure 
adjusted incidence rate for SARS-CoV-2 infection was 2.3 per 1000 person-weeks, 0.5 per 1000 person-
weeks for both primary and secondary case definition of COVID-19, and 1.8 per 1000 person-weeks for 
asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. No participants with COVID-19 had an emergency room visit or 
hospitalisation due to the COVID-19 event.

Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 infections, symptomatic or verified by testing, after the mRNA- 1273.211 50 μg 
booster dose are shown in Table 22. With the median follow-up time of 245 days, in the mRNA-1273.211 
50 μg booster dose group, 37 participants (12.5%) had SARS-CoV-2 infection starting at least 14 days 
after the 50 μg booster dose. Among the 37 participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 22 participants 
(7.4%) met the primary case definition of COVID-19 and 26 participants (8.8%) met the secondary case 
definition of COVID-19. Among participants in the mRNA-1273.211 50 μg group who met the primary 
and/or secondary case definition of COVID-19, onset day ranged from Day 201 to Day 246, with the 
exception of 1 participant who had Day 119 onset.

Table 26: Summary of COVID-19 Infections – Part A (Per-Protocol Efficacy Set) 
CHMP comment: 
Incidence rates after vaccination with mRNA-1273.214 or mRNA-1273 need to be considered descriptive 
as study P205 was not designed to assess efficacy. In addition, P205 Part F and Part G have not been 
enrolled at the same time and as a consequence the viral landscape of SARS-CoV-2 might have been 
different according to prevalent strains. SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred in both treatment arms with a 
higher occurrence after vaccination with mRNA-1273.214. However, none of the infected participants had 
an ER visit or hospitalisation, indicating protection from severe disease after both, vaccination with 
mRNA-1273.214 and mRNA-1273. 
Vaccination with mRNA-1273.214 and mRNA-1273 elicits an increase in nAB GMTs against ancestral 
SARS-CoV-2 and Omicron variants BA.1 and BA.4, BA.5. It was noted before that nAB GMTs against 
variants Omicron BA.1 and Omicron BA.4, BA.5 are overall lower as compared to nAB GMTs against 
ancestral SARS-CoV-2. It is of value to assess the durability of these nAB GMTs in a Day 91 analysis. 
However, not only antibody mediated immunity but also T-cell mediated immunity was intended to be 
assessed as an exploratory objective as “to characterise the cellular immune response of mRNA-1273.214 
as a booster against SARS-CoV-2 and other variants by T-cell (and B-cell) response after the mRNA-
1273.214 booster”. The T-cell response has not been characterised in this interim analysis but results on 
T-cell mediated immunity are expected for Day 91 analysis. 
A further exploratory objective was to evaluate the genetic and/or phenotypic relationships of isolated 
SARS-CoV-2 strains to the vaccine sequence by characterising “the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence of 
viral isolates and compare with the vaccine sequence, and to characterise the immune responses to 
vaccine breakthrough isolates”. These analyses are also expected for Day 91 interim analysis. (REC)

5.3.  Discussion 
Study design and methods 
Study P205 serves as pivotal study for the bivalent vaccine mRNA-1273.214. The study is an open-label, 
multi-cohort study. At the time of assessment, it consisted of 7 parts (A to G), whereof 2 parts were 
further structured in subparts (Part A.1 and A.2; Part F Cohort 1 and Cohort 2). Part D of the study was 
not further disclosed. The study was planned to enrol subjects to investigate the effect of different 
booster vaccine candidates (mRNA.1273.211 [bivalent original/Beta] or mRNA-1273.214 [bivalent 
original/Omicron] or mRNA-1273 [monovalent original]) either as first or second booster. For each 
part/cohort it was planned to enrol from 300 to 584 subjects depending on the objectives. 
The study was not blinded and no protective measures such as firewalls or independent monitoring 
committees were established to reduce possible bias, to avoid data-driven decision making, and to 
enhance the conduct of study. While data-driven decision making is well placed in an exploratory trial it 
might be a possible issue in a confirmatory trial. Hence the study design is not considered optimal but 
acceptable in the current situation with the need for quick adaptions, often guided by information from 
outside the trial. 
To establish immunogenicity (and efficacy) in the current type 2 variation, only subjects vaccinated with 
the original vaccine mRNA-1273 as second booster in Part F, Cohort 2 and subjects vaccinated with the 
bivalent booster candidate mRNA-1273.214 were in Part G were of relevance. No type 1 error control 
over the different parts and cohorts within parts was in place. Again, this is not considered optimal but 
acceptable for a pragmatic study conduct in the given situation with the prime aim to implement an 
optimised adapted vaccine in response to the challenges posed by the evolving SARS-CoV-2 variant 
strains. 
Immunogenicity was measured with two different assays (PsVNA for neutralising antibodies and MSD 
multiplex for binding antibodies). It is noted that for the cohorts of interest, it was not pre-specified which 
assay was to be considered primary. Only for cohort A.1 it was stated that “pseudotyped virus 
neutralising antibody will be used as the basis to assess non-inferiority in immune response”. 
Furthermore, for PsVNA two different measures (ID50 and ID80) were presented. It was not pre-specified 
which of the two was considered for the primary immunogenicity analyses. The lack of pre-specification 
leaves room for post-hoc choices and might in general increase the type 1 error and bias. Post hoc, there 
was apparently no need to choose the endpoints of interest as all endpoints were well aligned. 
Furthermore, it is noted that the chosen primary assay PsVNA50 was also used in previous applications. 
Nonetheless, better pre-specification is strongly advised to avoid issues in less clear-cut situations. 
Multiplicity within Part G was controlled over 4 hypotheses (three of which were non-inferiority 
hypotheses and one superiority hypothesis) both at Day 29 and Day 91, respectively. The chosen 
hypotheses and the multiplicity control within Part G were well justified and are supported. It was noted 
during the assessment that the final choice of primary endpoints and the multiplicity adjustment (NI-
testing for SRR at Day 29 and testing of the same hypotheses at the Day 91 visit under type 1 error 
control were added) were made very late with Amendment 6 (17 Mar 2022). Given that the study was an 
open label study and given that the data cut-off (27 Apr 2022) was only shortly after these changes, this 
might have been problematic. The MAH clarified that the rationale for the inclusion of Day 91 as part of 
the multiple testing approach was triggered by external data of the bivalent vaccine candidate (mRNA-
1273.211 targeted against Beta-variant and ancestral strain), which showed enhanced nAb persistence 
against various strains (Beta, Omicron, Delta and the ancestral virus). Furthermore, only 29 participants 
in Part F, Cohort 2 had reached the 29 Day visit by the time of the change and no immunogenicity data 
was available for any of the two cohorts. Overall, the primary analysis models, statistical methods and 
study design for immunogenicity are endorsed. 
Assessment report

For supportive efficacy data, the study design is considered problematic as subjects vaccinated with 
mRNA-1273 in Part F, Cohort 2 were enrolled prior to subjects in Part G. Given the dynamic nature of the 
pandemic (regarding incidence rates as well as circulating variant strains) this results in difficulties in 
interpreting the derived VE estimates. As these data are only considered supportive, this is not deemed a 
major issue. Nevertheless, concurrently enrolled or even randomised cohorts would be preferred. 
Results 
The PsVNAs against SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant and Omicron variants were not validated at the time of 
analysis but were considered to be qualified “fit-for-purpose”. In section 2.5.3 Overview of Clinical 
Pharmacology in the Clinical Overview the MAH states that the BA.4, BA.5 PsVNA “was performed in a 
manner consistent with the BA.1 pseudovirus neutralisation assay”. Though providing results from non-
validated assays for the purpose of a MAA is basically not acceptable, results from the PsVNA against 
Omicron variants can be accepted for this procedure, given the short timelines for generation of 
serological results against Omicron variants BA.4, BA.5, in addition to prior experience with the validated 
PsVNA against D614G. However, the MAH is requested to provide the PsVNA validation reports for 
Omicron variants BA.1 and BA.4, BA.5 once available. Validation of these assays is expected to be 
completed prior to further analyses for Day 91 interim analysis. 
Key results such as comparison of age groups, race and sex are presented only in raw format in 
accessory tables.  
mRNA-1273.214 compared with mRNA-1273 as a (second) booster 
(Second) booster vaccination with bivalent mRNA-1273.214 50 μg met the pre-specified criterion for non-
inferiority against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain and elicited superior neutralising antibody responses 
against Omicron variants BA.1 and BA.4, BA.5 compared to booster vaccination with mRNA-1273.  
Booster vaccination with mRNA-1273.214 (25 µg Original + 25 µg Omicron) efficiently elicits even higher 
nAB GMTs against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 as compared to booster vaccination with mRNA-1273 (50 µg 
Original). 
Neutralising antibody GMTs after (second) booster vaccination with both, mRNA-1273.214 or mRNA-
1273, are lower against BA.1 and again lower against BA.4, BA.5 as compared to nAB GMTs against 
ancestral SARS-CoV-2.  
Sub-group analysis for age 
There is a tendency of higher nAB GMTs in the elderly population ≥65 years of age as compared to nAB 
GMTs in adults ≥18 to <65 years of age. This is rather unexpected and difficult to interpret but might be 
at least partly explainable by the fact that also the baseline titres are somewhat higher in elderly. Most 
importantly, these results confirm that also in the elderly population a very good immune response 
increase is induced by the 2nd booster dose. 
Sub-group analysis for race 
Vaccination with mRNA-1273.214 and mRNA-1273 increases the nAB GMTs against ancestral SARS-CoV-2 
and variant Omicron BA.1 in all sub-groups irrespective of race as compared to baseline GMTs. In all sub-
groups in the PPIS-negative nAB GMTs after vaccination with mRNA-1273.214 were higher as compared 
to GMTs after vaccination with mRNA-1273. In PPIS-negative the pattern of nAB GMTs is overall 
comparable throughout all sub-groups for race. The PPIS-negative excludes the influence of prior SARS-
CoV-2 infection on the nAB GMTs which may confound results in the PPIS-all sub-group analysis for race.  
Sub-group analysis for sex 
Assessment report  
EMA/896245/2022

Vaccination with mRNA-1273.214 or mRNA-1273 elicits an increase in nAB GMTs in both sub-groups, 
male and female. In female the pattern of nAB GMTs after vaccination with mRNA-1273.214 or mRNA-
1273 is as expected, with higher nAB GMTs after vaccination with mRNA-1273.214. Vaccination with 
mRNA-1273 results in higher nAB GMTs on Day 29 in male compared to nABs after vaccination with 
mRNA-1273.214. Results from the PPIS-negative are shown which excludes an influence on prior SARS-
CoV-2 infection. The numbers of the sub-groups are not obviously too small (N=145 vs. N=126). The CIs 
are largely overlapping for nAB GMTs on Day 29 in male (GM Level 6144.836; 95% CI 5081.693; 
7430.401 vs. GM Level 6616.689; 95% CI 5618.470; 7792.260), indicating a comparable capacity in 
eliciting nAB GMTs by any of the vaccines. While this concerns the question on non-inferiority of mRNA-
1273.214 against ancestral SARS-CoV-2 in male population this is not considered an issue. Nonetheless, 
it would have been expected to be discussed by the MAH. 
Geometric Mean Titer (GMT) and Geometric Mean Fold Rise (GMFR) comparison 
nAB GMTs and corresponding GMFRs are consistently higher after booster vaccination with mRNA-
1273.214 as compared to vaccination with mRNA-1273 against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain and 
Omicron variants BA.1 and BA.4, BA.5. Values for GMFRs depend on the baseline values and therefore 
the nominal reduction of GMFRs from PPIS-neg > PPIS-all > PPIS-pos can be expected. 
Seroresponse rates (SRRs) 
The primary definition of seroresponse is defined as ≥ 4 × LLOQ for those with pre-dose 1 of primary 
series baseline < LLOQ; ≥ 4-foldrise for those with pre-dose 1 of primary series baseline ≥ LLOQ. For 
Part F Cohort 2 and Part G, SRRs are based on the primary definition when comparing with the mRNA-
1273 primary series. Therefore, seroresponse is considered for those subjects who reach a GMT of ≥ 4 x 
LLOQ or a ≥ 4-foldrise from primary series baseline GMT value in this interim analysis. This definition is 
not appropriate for the characterisation of a booster vaccination and resulting SRR values cannot be 
considered clinically meaningful. This does not impact the assessment as superiority of mRNA-1273.214 
based on neutralising antibody responses is shown. 
Neutralising / binding ABs against SARS-CoV-2 variants 
Neutralising antibodies against variants Beta and Delta have been analysed in samples from <50 subjects 
per group. The results are controversial in particular for variant Delta. It is understood that due to the 
nature of the PsVNA there are capacity constraints and analysis of currently circulating VOCs such as 
Omicron BA.2.75 shall be prioritised. In particular as SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants are currently the 
predominantly circulating variants this explanation and ranking is endorsed, and immunogenicity results 
against variants Beta and Delta do not impact the assessment.  
It is noted that vaccination with both mRNA.1273 and mRNA-1273.214 does elicit nABs against SARS-
CoV-2 variants Beta and Delta. However, the extent to which nABs against variants Beta and Delta are 
elicited remains unknown from this analysis but would roughly be expected to be in the same range due 
to overlapping CIs. 
In the analysis of binding antibodies mRNA-1273.214 50 μg booster dose met superiority at Day 29, 
compared to mRNA-1273 50 μg, based on GMRs for all variants tested, regardless of prior SARS-CoV-2 
infection. 
SARS-CoV-2 infection after vaccination with mRNA-1273.214 and mRNA-1273 
Incidence rates after 2nd booster vaccination with mRNA-1273.214 or mRNA-1273 need to be considered 
descriptive as study P205 was not designed to assess efficacy. In addition, P205 Part F and Part G have 
not been enrolled in parallel and as a consequence the viral landscape of SARS-CoV-2 variants might 
have been different with regards to prevalent strains.  
Assessment report  
EMA/896245/2022 
Page 143/191 
 
 
 
 
SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred in both treatment arms with a higher incidence after vaccination with 
mRNA-1273.214. However, none of the infected participants had an ER visit or hospitalisation, indicating 
protection from severe disease after vaccination with both, mRNA-1273.214 or mRNA-1273.  
Out of 11 cases in mRNA-1273.214 vaccinated participants 5 have sequencing data available that 
demonstrate variant Omicron BA.2 infection, in line with the prevalence of Omicron BA.2 at that time. No 
sequencing data are presently available for cases in the mRNA-1273 vaccinated group (according to MAH 
responses to FDA RFI, 04-Aug-2022). 
First booster vaccination in comparison of mRNA-1273.211 (original/Beta) with mRNA-1273 
PsVNA nAB GMTs after 1st booster dose vaccination with the bivalent vaccine mRNA-1273.211 was 
compared to GMTs after vaccination with mRNA-1273. Vaccination with mRNA-1273.211 showed 
superiority over vaccination with mRNA-1273 based on GMRs for all variants tested (Beta, Delta and 
Omicron BA.1).  
Also, the PsVNA nAB GMTs remain relatively higher on Day 181 after 1st booster vaccination with mRNA-
1273.211 as compared to mRNA-1273, indicating not only a broadening of the immune response after 1st 
booster vaccination with bivalent vaccine mRNA-1273.211 but also associated increase in the B-cell 
mediated durability of the immune response. 
In summary, provided results indicate that the bivalent Omicron BA.1-containing vaccine mRNA-1273.214 
50 μg elicits superior neutralising antibody responses against Omicron BA.1 and BA.4, BA.5, compared to 
mRNA-1273 50 μg, regardless of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.  
The MAH is seeking approval for the bivalent mRNA-1273.214 (original / Omicron) as a 1st or 2nd booster 
immunisation to prevent from COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in adolescents and adults aged 12 years 
of age and older. Study P205 has enrolled adults ≥18 years of age and older. The MAH has received 
authorisation earlier for the use of original mRNA-1273 50 µg as a 1st booster vaccination in adolescent 
≥12 to 17 years of age and in adults ≥18 years of age and older. Authorisation was granted based on 
immunobridging between adolescents ≥12 to 17 years of age compared to young adults ≥18 to 25 years 
of age. As there is no obvious scientific reason to assume that basic immunogenicity characteristics would 
be significantly different for the immunobridging approach applied for the approval of the mRNA-1273 
booster dose in adolescent this is considered valid also for mRNA-1273.214. 
Notably, bivalent mRNA-1273.211 50 µg (original / Beta) was compared to mRNA-1273 as a 1st booster 
dose after the primary vaccination series, indicating efficient increase in neutralising antibodies against 
ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and variant Beta, and a broadening of the immune response to other variants.  
Vaccination with mRNA-1273.214 and mRNA-1273 elicits an increase in nAB GMTs against ancestral 
SARS-CoV-2 and Omicron variants BA.1 and BA.4, BA.5. It was noted earlier that nAB GMTs against 
variants Omicron BA.1 and Omicron BA.4, BA.5 are overall lower as compared to nAB GMTs against 
ancestral SARS-CoV-2. Results from P205 Part A (bivalent original / Beta variant vaccine mRNA-
1273.211) can be considered supportive in terms of durability of the immune response until day 181. 
Nevertheless, the upcoming interim analysis on Day 91 for study P205 Parts F and G is considered 
essential to specifically address durability of the response after vaccination with mRNA-1273.214.  
Taken together, the indication for bivalent mRNA-1273.214 50 µg (original / Omicron) as a 1st or 2nd 
booster dose after the primary vaccination series is deemed acceptable based on the totality of 
serological evidence evaluating different vaccination regimens.  
However, not only antibody mediated immunity but also T-cell mediated immunity was intended to be 
investigated as an exploratory objective “to characterise the cellular immune response of mRNA-
1273.214 as a booster against SARS-CoV-2 and other variants by T-cell (and B-cell) response after the

mRNA-1273.214 booster”. The T-cell response has not been characterised in this interim analysis but 
results on T-cell mediated immunity are expected for Day 91 analysis. 
A further exploratory objective was to evaluate the genetic and/or phenotypic relationships of isolated 
SARS-CoV-2 strains to the vaccine sequence by characterising “the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence of 
viral isolates and compare with the vaccine sequence, and to characterise the immune responses to 
vaccine breakthrough isolates”. These analyses are also expected for Day 91 interim analysis.  
6.  Clinical Safety aspects 
Introduction  
In response to the continued emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants and the associated morbidity and 
mortality, the MAH has developed a modified, variant-matched bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccine that 
contain equal amounts of two mRNAs that encode for the Spike protein of the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 
(Wuhan-Hu-1) and the antigenically divergent variant Omicron BA.1, in combination named mRNA-
1273.214.  
Study mRNA-1273-P205 is an ongoing open label Phase 2/3 study with multiple, sequentially enrolled 
cohorts to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of variant-modified booster candidate vaccines.  
This current procedure summarises the safety and immunogenicity data of mRNA-1273.214 50 µg given 
as a second booster dose at least 3 months after a first booster dose of mRNA-1273 50 µg (Study mRNA-
1273-P205 Part G) and also includes supportive data from the mRNA-1273.211 booster vaccine (a Beta-
containing bivalent formulation given as first booster dose in Study mRNA-1273-P205 Part A). This 
submission includes the Day 29 interim results analysing the safety and immunogenicity of the mRNA-
1273.214 50 μg booster vaccine as well as supportive safety and immunogenicity data of the Day 181 
interim analysis results mRNA-1273.211 50 μg booster vaccine.  
MAH intends with this submission to seek authorisation for the mRNA-1273.214 Omicron-containing 
booster vaccine and to show its ability to elicit superior and broader antibody responses, compared to the 
current booster vaccine, and therefore it is likely to confer enhanced protection against COVID-19.  
The MAH defined the safety set Analysis: The Safety Set consists of all participants who receive IP and 
will be used for all analyses of safety except for the solicited ARs. Participants will be included in the 
study arm corresponding to the dose of IP that they actually received.  
The data snapshot for P205 Part G (mRNA-1273.214 50) and P205 Part F (mRNA-1273 50 µg) is 27 April 
2022. The data snapshot for P205 Part A (mRNA-1273.211) is 02 Feb 2022.

they had received the primary series and the first booster dose of mRNA-1273 and other 240 participants 
(54.9%) had received the primary series and the first booster dose under the EUA in the United States. 
The median follow-up time was 43 days. Of the 437 participants who received the mRNA-1273.214 50 µg 
booster dose, 2 of them discontinued from the study (withdrawal of consent by participant). 
In the mRNA-1273 50 µg booster dose group, 377 participants received the booster dose. Of these, 264 
participants (70.0%) enrolled from study P301 where they had received the primary series and the first 
booster dose of mRNA-1273 and 113 participants (30.0%) had received the primary series and the first 
booster dose under the EUA in the United States. The median follow-up time was 57 days (range 51 to 66 
days). No participant discontinued the study by the data cut-off date. Table 27 summarises Participants

Participant Disposition duration of follow-up  
At the time of data snapshot, in the P205 Part A mRNA-1273.211 50 µg booster dose group, 300 
participants received the booster dose. These participants were enrolled from the study P301 with a 
median follow up of 264.0 days, after the second dose of the primary series. The median follow-up time 
from mRNA-1273.211 50 µg booster dose injection was 245.0 days and 10 participants (3.3%) 
discontinued from the study.  
In the mRNA-1273 50 µg booster dose group (P201 part B), 171 participants received the booster dose 
and they were enrolled from 28 January 2021 until 02 April 2021. The median duration of follow-up after 
the booster dose was 174.5 days and for 3 participants was < 56 days. Of the 171 participants in total, 5 
participants (2.9%) discontinued from the study. Table 29 summarises Participants Disposition in P205

CHMP comments:  
P205 Part G and P205 Part F: The safety sets include data respectively: 437 participants from the 
mRNA-1273.214 50 µg booster dose group (P205 Part G) and 377 participants from the mRNA-1273 50 
µg booster dose group (P205 Part F). The demographic and baseline characteristics were similar 
between the 2 groups. There were more females than males, respectively 59% females in part G and 
50.7% in Part F. More than 80% of study subjects were White across the groups.  
The median age was 60.0 years, respectively 60.2% participants were ≥ 18 and < 65 years and 39.8% 
participants were ≥ 65 years of age for both Part G and Part F. The majority of the participants were 
SARS-CoV-2 seronegative at baseline, respectively 77.8% in Part G and 70.8% in Part F.  
In the mRNA-1273.214 50 µg the median follow-up time was 43 days, and in the mRNA-1273 50 µg 
booster group 57 days. The data snapshot applying for this procedure is 27 April 2022.  
Information was asked on the 2 participants who discontinued the study in the mRNA- 1273.214 50 µg 
booster dose group, grouped as ‘other’ at Table 1 and for both the discontinuation reasons did not 
include adverse events. One subject withdrew from study due to not wanting to have blood drawn and 
the other subject was unable to attend scheduled visits due to work schedule.  
It has been noticed that in the MAH’s position the following recruitment windows have been mentioned: 
In the mRNA-1273.214 50 µg booster dose group from the participants enrolled from 18 Feb 2021 to 8 
Mar 2022. In the mRNA-1273 50 µg booster dose group from the participants enrolled from 8-23 March 
2022. 
The data cut-off for both Part G and Part F is 27 April 2022. Considering that the median follow-up is 
considerably longer in the mRNA-1273 group (57 days), compared to the mRNA-1273.214 group (43 
days), it seems that the recruitment windows were mixed up in the MAH’s position (i.e., the 
participants who received mRNA-1273.214 were recruited during the later time window). 
P205 Part A and P201 Part B: The other safety analysis sets include 300 participants from the mRNA-
1273.211 50 µg booster dose group (P205 Part A) and 171 participants from the mRNA-1273 50 µg 
booster dose group (P201 Part B). More females than males were enrolled in both parts.  
In the P205 part A, the median age was 51.0 years, and 20.7% were ≥ 65 years of age. The majority 
of the participants were SARS-CoV-2 seronegative at baseline, with 98.7% participants.  
For part A, the median follow-up duration was 264.0 days, after the second dose of the primary series 
and 245.0 days for the booster dose injection. For part B, the median duration of follow-up after the 
booster dose was 174.5 days. The safety data cut-off is 02 Feb 2022.  
Adverse events 
The safety assessments for study P205 parts G, F and A were done by following the solicited local and 
systemic ARs during the 7-day follow-up period after vaccination. The unsolicited AEs were evaluated 
during the 28-day follow-up period after vaccination. The assessment included any AE reported by the 
participant that is not specified as a solicited AR in the protocol or is specified as a solicited AR but starts 
outside the protocol-defined period for reporting solicited ARs (ie, 7 days after vaccination). All the SAEs, 
MAAEs, AEs leading to withdrawal and AESIs were collected throughout the study. For the mRNA-
1273.214 50 µg booster dose group (Part G) and the mRNA-1273 50 µg booster dose group (Part F), 
solicited AR data and an overview of unsolicited AE data were also summarised by subgroups based on 
Assessment report

pre-booster baseline SARS-CoV-2 status (positive or negative) to assess whether there were 
reactogenicity or safety concerns for individuals with prior infection. 
Solicited adverse reactions 
The MAH defined the Solicited Safety Set Analysis as following:  
The Solicited Safety Set consists of all participants who receive IP and contribute any solicited AR data.  
It will be used for the analyses of solicited ARs. Participants will be included in the study arm 
corresponding to the dose of IP that they actually received. 
Solicited local ARs assessed included injection site pain, injection site erythema (redness), injection site 
swelling/induration (hardness), and axillary (underarm) swelling or tenderness ipsilateral to the side of 
the injection. Solicited systemic ARs assessed were headache, fatigue, myalgia (muscle aches all over the 
body), arthralgia (joint aches in several joints), nausea/vomiting, chills, and fever (oral temperature). 
Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical 
Trials (DHHS 2007) was used for the severity grading of solicited ARs occurred automatically based on 
participant entry into the eDiary. Any solicited AR that was ongoing beyond Day 7 was to be reported in 
the eDiary until it resolved. The ARs captured in the eDiary within 7 days after injection for mRNA-
1273.214 given as a second booster (Part G) were compared with mRNA-1273 given as a second booster 
(Part F).  
1. Solicited Adverse Reactions in mRNA-127.214 50 µg (P205 Part G) and mRNA-1273 50 µg 
(P205 Part F) 
Solicited local ARs 
In the mRNA-1273.214 50 µg booster dose group (Part G), most participants (79.4%) had at least one 
solicited local AR. The most common solicited local AR after booster dose was pain in 77.3% participants, 
followed by axillary swelling or tenderness (17.4%). The majority of solicited local ARs were Grade 1 in 
(66.6%) participants and (3.4%) participants had a Grade 3 local AR, the most commonly reported was 
erythema (2.1%). There were no Grade 4 local ARs. Local ARs were transient; the median duration was 
2.0 days (range 1 to 10 days). There was noticed a higher incidence of any erythema (redness) reported 
in 6.9% participants in the mRNA-1273.214 50 µg booster dose group (Part G) compared to the mRNA-
1273 50 µg booster dose group (Part F).  
In the mRNA-1273 50 µg booster dose group (Part F), most participants (79.5%) had at least 1 solicited 
local AR. Pain was the most common solicited local AR after the booster dose in 76.6% participants, 
followed by axillary swelling or tenderness (15.4%). The majority of solicited local ARs were Grade 1 
(68.1%) and (13.4%) Grade 3 local AR, the most commonly reported was swelling (1.4%) participants. 
No Grade 4 solicited local ARs were reported. Local ARs were transient; the median duration was 2.0 days 
(range 1 to 22 days).

Solicited systemic ARs 
In the mRNA-1273.214 50 µg booster dose group (Part G), most participants (70.3%) had at least one 
solicited systemic AR. The most common systemic AR after the booster dose was fatigue (54.9%), 
followed by headache (43.9%), myalgia (39.6%), and arthralgia (31.1%). The majority of solicited 
systemic ARs were Grade 1 (38.2%) followed by Grade 2 (26.5%). Twenty-four participants  
(5.5%) had a Grade 3 systemic AR and the most commonly reported was fatigue (3.4%). No Grade 4 
solicited systemic ARs were reported. The median duration of systemic ARs was 2.0 days (range 1 to 21 
days).  
In the mRNA-1273 50 µg booster dose group (Part F), most participants (66.1%) had at least one 
solicited systemic AR. The most common systemic AR after the booster dose was fatigue (51.4%) 
participants, followed by headache (41.1%), myalgia (38.6%), and arthralgia (31.7%). The majority of 
solicited systemic ARs were Grade 1 with 35.3% of participants, followed by Grade 2 (26.2%). Sixteen 
participants (4.6%) had a Grade 3 systemic AR and the most commonly reported was myalgia (3.7%). 
No Grade 4 solicited systemic ARs were reported. The median duration of systemic ARs was 2.0 days 
(range 1 to 13 days).  
The summary for local and systemic reactions in both Part G and Part F is provided in Table 30, 
highlighted are the differences noted among the two groups and the Grade 3 events:

CHMP comment:  
Safety was evaluated by collecting solicited local and systemic adverse events for 7 days after each 
injections using an e-diary and monitoring unsolicited AEs for 28 days after each injection. AE of 
special interest, SAE and AE leading to discontinuation were collected throughout the study.  
The data snapshot applying for this procedure is 27 April 2022. 
As the duration of follow up is limited to 43 days in the mRNA-1273.214 50 µg booster dose group, the 
MAH has been required to provide further safety analyses providing information on SAEs, AESIs and 
MAAEs with a later cut-off. In the response provided MAH has not performed further safety analyses 
beyond the data-cut timepoint in the Day 29 interim analysis of study P205 part G (43 days of follow-
up time), but MAH is planning a day 91 interim analysis and the MAH will have report of the day 91 
interim analysis by 31 December 2022. It is concluded that the reactogenicity of mRNA-1273.214 50 
µg as booster dose is covered sufficiently with a short term follow up of 43 days. However, the MAH is 
requested to provide an interim CSR, including a comprehensive safety analysis with a later cut-off for 
the mRNA-1273.214 50 µg booster dose group, once the data of the Day 91 interim analysis are 
available. 
Solicited Adverse Events 
The overall incidence of solicited local reactions was comparable between the mRNA-1273.214 50 µg 
booster dose group (Part G) and the mRNA-1273 50 µg booster dose group (Part F), accordingly 
79.4% vs. 79.5%.  
However, regarding the local reactions, it has been observed slightly higher reactogenicity in the 
mRNA-1273.214 50 µg booster dose group (Part G) vs. the mRNA-1273 50 µg booster dose group 
(Part F). The most common local ARs for both groups: were “any pain” with 77.3% vs. 76.6%, followed 
by “any axillary swelling or tenderness” with 17.4% vs 15.4%.  
Assessment report

The highest differences were noticed regarding any erythema (redness) reported in 30/437 participants 
(6.9%) in the mRNA-1273.214 50 µg booster dose group (Part G) and in 13/ 351 participants (3.7%) 
in the mRNA-1273 50 µg booster dose group (Part F). While any swelling (hardness) was comparable 
between the two groups with 6.9 % vs 6.6%.  
The majority of solicited local ARs were mild- to- moderate (Grade 1-2) for both groups.  
Regarding the Grade 3 local ARs, same frequency has been observed in the two groups with (3.4%), 
however “erythema” was the most common Grade 3 local AR for P205 Part G with (2.1%) versus 
(0.6%) for P205 Part F. MAH has provided information on the Grade 3 erythema events (n=9) in the 
mRNA-1273.214 50 and they did have a duration from 1-5 days and reported as resolved.  
No grade 4 events were reported in both Groups. After the booster injection, the median duration of 
solicited local ARs was 2 days.  
The incidence of solicited systemic reactions was slightly higher in the mRNA-1273.214 50 µg booster 
dose group (Part G) compared to the mRNA-1273 50 µg booster dose group (Part F), accordingly 
70.3% and 66.1%. The most common systemic AR after the booster dose for both groups accordingly 
were: fatigue (54.9% vs 51.4%), followed by headache (43.9% vs 41.1%), myalgia (39.6% vs 
38.6%), and arthralgia (31.1% vs 31.7%). The majority of the systemic ARs in both groups were mild-
to- moderate (Grade 1 -2) and they were comparable between the two groups. Grade 3 events were in 
higher frequency in the mRNA-1273.214 50 µg booster dose (5.5%) compared to (4.6%) in the mRNA-
1273 50 µg booster dose group, the most common Grade 3 event reported in the Part G was fatigue 
(3.4 % vs 3.1%) while in Part F was myalgia (3.7% vs 2.3%) compared to the Part G. No Grade 4 
events were reported in both groups. The median duration of systemic ARs for both groups was 2.0 
days. 
The MAH has been requested to provide information on the duration of the various grade 3 AE local 
and systemic in the mRNA-1273.214 50 μg booster dose group (Part G). MAH response: In total there 
were reported 58 Grade 3 local and systemic solicited ARs in 35 participants, none of them were 
considered SAEs. The mean duration was 1.6 days, and the median duration was 1 day, with the 
duration ranging from 1.0 to 14.0 days. 
Table 31: Summary of Duration (Days) on Grade 3 Local and Systemic Solicited Adverse Reaction 
The most frequently reported were: fatigue (n=16; duration range: 1 to 14 day), followed by myalgia 
(n=10; duration: all 1 day), erythema (n=9; duration range: 1 to 5 days), headache (n=6; duration: 
all 1 day), swelling (n=5; duration range 1 to 4 days), and pain (n=4; duration: all 1 day) and 
arthralgia (n=4; duration: all 1 day). The remaining grade 3 / severe solicited ARs of axillary swelling 
or tenderness, fever, nausea/vomiting and chills were each reported once, and the duration was 1 day 
for all events.

Table 32: Summary of Case Counts of Grade 3 Local and Systemic Solicited Adverse Reactions by 
Duration 
One solicited AR of grade 3 / severe fatigue occurred in a 40-49 year old female and had a duration of 
14 days; this event was not medically attended and resolved without treatment. The majority of the 
remaining 15 grade 3 / severe solicited ARs of fatigue had a duration of 1 day (n=12) followed by 2 
days (n=3). 
MAH has been asked to provide an analysis regarding the status of solicited ARs the mRNA-1273.214 
50 µg booster dose group (Part G) that persisted beyond 7 days after vaccination. The results provided 
show that of the 28 solicited ARs in 21 participants occurred within 7 days of vaccination and persisted 
beyond Day 7 post vaccination. None of the events were serious and they all resolved and only one 
event was medically attended (event of fatigue from Study Day 2 to Study Day 13). The most 
frequently reported solicited AR that persisted beyond Day 7 were fatigue (n=9) followed by arthralgia 
(n=6), headache (n=5), injection site pain (n=3) and myalgia (n=2). The remaining events of injection 
site swelling/induration, injection site erythema and axillary swelling or tenderness were reported once 
each. No safety concerns have been identified. 
Table 33: Summary of Duration (Days) for Solicited ARs Persisted Beyond 7 Days after Vacccination 
Solicited Adverse Reactions by Pre-booster SARS-CoV-2 Status 
Solicited Safety Set in the mRNA-1273 50 µg booster dose group (Part G) based on the pre-booster 
baseline SARS-CoV-2 status included 96/437 participants (22.0%) with a positive pre-booster SARS-CoV-
2 status and 340/437 participants (77.8%) with a negative pre-booster SARS-CoV-2 status (1 participant 
had missing status). In summary, the frequency of solicited local ARs was comparable among participants 
with a positive versus participants with a negative pre-booster SARS-CoV-2 status (77.1% versus 
80.0%). The frequency of solicited systemic ARs was also comparable among the participants in both 
groups, accordingly with 65.6% versus 71.8%. The frequency of Grade 3 solicited local ARs was similar 
among these two groups respectively, 1/96 participants (1.0%) with positive pre-booster SARS-CoV-2

status and 14/340 participants (4.1%) with negative pre-booster SARS-CoV-2 status. This similarity 
applied also for the Grade 3 systemic ARs between the 2 groups, accordingly (5.2%) vs (5.6%) 
participants. 
In the mRNA-1273 50 µg booster dose group (Part F) there were included 92/351 participants (26.2%) 
participants with a positive pre-booster SARS-CoV-2 status and 250/351 participants (71.2%) with a 
negative status (9 participants had missing status). The frequency of solicited local ARs were similar in 
the two groups, with 79.3% among the participants with positive status and 80.0% among participants 
with a negative pre-booster SARS-CoV-2 status. The frequency of solicited systemic ARs was comparable 
between the 2 groups respectively, 62.0% vs. 68.4%. Grade 3 local ARs had a similar frequency among 
participants of the 2 groups, respectively (3.3%) and (3.6%). Grade 3 systemic ARs were similar in 
participants with positive pre-booster SARS-CoV-2 status (1/92 [1.1%]) and participants with negative 
pre-booster SARS-CoV-2 status (15/250 [6.0%]). Table 34 summaries the solicited ARs according to Pre-
booster SARS-CoV-2 Status after 2nd-Booster Dose in P205 Part G and Part F.

CHMP comments:  
The monitoring of the safety and reactogenicity of mRNA-1273.214 50 µg summarised by subgroups 
based on pre-booster baseline SARS-CoV-2 status (positive or negative) for P205 Part G showed no 
safety concerns between participants with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to the booster dose. 
The incidence of the solicited ARs was comparable among the two parts of the study (Part G and Part 
F), regardless the SARS-CoV-2 status on pre-booster baseline.  
In summary, safety and reactogenicity of mRNA-1273.214 50 μg was consistent between participants 
with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to the booster dose. 
Solicited Adverse Reactions in mRNA-1273.211 50 µg (P205 Part A) 
Solicited Local ARs 
In the mRNA- 1273.211 50 µg booster dose group, most participants (85.2%) had at least 1 solicited 
local AR. Pain was the most commonly reported local AR (84.9%) followed by axillary swelling or 
tenderness (24.8%). The majority of solicited local ARs were Grade 1 (68.8%). Eight participants (2.7%) 
had a Grade 3 solicited local AR and pain was the most commonly reported (1.7%). The median duration 
of local ARs was 3.0 days (range 1 to 24 days). 
Solicited Systemic ARs 
In the mRNA-1273.211 50 µg booster dose group, most participants (75.8%) had at least 1 solicited 
systemic AR. The most commonly reported systemic ARs were fatigue (64.4%) followed by headache 
(50.7%) and myalgia (49.0%). The majority of solicited systemic ARs were Grade 1 (35.2%) and Grade 2 
(32.2%). Twenty-five participants (8.4%) had a Grade 3 solicited systemic AR and the most commonly 
reported was fatigue (6.4%). There were no Grade 4 solicited systemic ARs. The median duration of 
systemic ARs was 2.0 days (range 1 to 39 days). Table 35 describes the solicited ARs in P205 Part A.

CHMP comments:  
The incidence of solicited local reactions in P205 Part A was 85.2%, with the pain reported as most 
common (84.9%). The majority of the local solicited ARs were Grade 1(68.8%) and Grade 2 (13.8%). 
The Grade 3 events had a frequency of (2.7%) with Pain reported as most common (1.7%).  
The incidence of solicited systemic reactions in participants P205 Part A was (75.8%), with fatigue 
(64.4%) reported as most common. The majority of the events were Grade 1-Grade 2 (35.2%-32.2%). 
The frequency of the Grade 3 events was (8.4%), with fatigue (6.4%) reported as most common. 
According to the overall incidence of local and systemic adverse events it seems that the reactogenicity 
of the bivalent mRNA-1273.211 given as a 1st booster dose appears similar with the ancestral mRNA-
1273.  
Based in the Clinical Protocol in Part A.2 of Study P205, a second booster dose of 50 µg mRNA-
1273.214 is to be administrated in about 300 participants who received mRNA-1273.211 50 µg as a 
first booster dose in Part A.1. There are no safety data available at this time.

The unsolicited AEs experienced within 28 days (Day 1 through Day 29) after injection for 50 µg mRNA-
1273.214 given as a second booster (Part G) were comparable with 50 µg mRNA-1273 given as a second 
booster (Part F). The median follow-up was 43 days for Part G and median of 57 days for Part F.  
(P205 Part G) 
In the mRNA-1273.214 50 µg booster dose group (Part G), within 28 days after vaccination there were no 
fatal events and 0.5% participants had SAEs; both SAEs (prostate cancer and traumatic fracture) were 
considered to be unrelated to study vaccination by the investigator. 9.8% participants had at least one 
MAAE, of whom 2 participants (0.5%) had an MAAE that was considered by the investigator to be related 
to study vaccination (fatigue and dermatitis). No participants had TEAEs leading to study discontinuation.  
In the mRNA.214 50 µg booster dose (Part G), the unsolicited TEAEs within 28 days, regardless of 
relationship to study vaccination, were reported in 18.5% participants. Of those, 5.7% participants had a 
TEAE that was assessed by the investigator as related to study vaccination. The most frequently reported 
TEAEs considered by investigators to be related to vaccination were: fatigue (2.1%), arthralgia (1.4%), 
and headache (1.4%), and all other treatment-related TEAEs were reported in < 1.0% of participants. 
One participant experienced a severe TEAE that was considered related to vaccination: a 40-49 year old 
female had non-serious severe fatigue that began on Day 1 and continued until Day 14; the event was 
not medically attended. Up to the data cut-off date (27 Apr 2022), one additional SAE occurred in the 
mRNA-1273.214 50 µg booster dose group (nephrolithiasis; considered unrelated to vaccination by the 
investigator). As of the data cut-off, there were no fatal events or study discontinuations due to AEs.  
(P205 Part F) 
In the mRNA-1273 50 µg group (Part F) within 28 days after vaccination, there were no fatal events and 
0.3% participants had an SAE; the SAE (spinal osteoarthritis) was assessed by the investigator as 
unrelated to study vaccination. At least one MAAE was reported for 13.8% participants, of whom 0.5% 
had an MAAE that was considered by the investigator to be related to study vaccination (hypertension 
and urticaria). No participants had TEAEs leading to study discontinuation.  
In the mRNA-1273 50 µg booster dose (Part F), the unsolicited TEAEs within 28 days, regardless of 
relationship to study vaccination were reported in 20.7% participants. Of those, 5.8% participants had a 
TEAE that was assessed by the investigator as related to study vaccination, and the most frequently TEAs 
reported were: fatigue (2.9%), arthralgia (1.6%), and myalgia (1.6%). Two participants experienced 
severe TEAEs that were considered related to vaccination and were not medically attended: a 30-39 year 
old male with history of chronic fatigue had non-serious severe fatigue that began on Day 2 and resolved 
on Day 8 and occurred concurrently with an unsolicited AE of moderate asthma (verbatim: asthma 
exacerbation) that was assessed by the Investigator as not related to vaccination; and a 40-49 year old 
male had non-serious severe myalgia that began on Day 7 and resolved on Day 8. As of the data cut-off, 
there were no fatal events or study discontinuations due to AEs. One additional MAAE was considered 
related to vaccination by the investigator occurred in the mRNA-1273 50 µg booster dose group (back 
pain). The summary of the unsolicited ARs for both parts is described in Table 36:

CHMP comments:  
The incidence of unsolicited TEAs regardless of relationship with study vaccination within to 28 days 
were lower in the mRNA-1273.214 50 µg booster dose group (Part G) compared to mRNA-1273 50 µg 
group (Part F), accordingly 18.5% vs. 20.7%. There were 2 SAEs in the first group and 1 SAEs in the 
second group (which are going to be analysed in the SAEs section). 
 The same applies for the unsolicited TEAS related to the study vaccination, slightly lower in the mRNA-
1273.214 50 µg booster dose group (Part G) compared to mRNA-1273 50 µg group (Part F), 
respectively 5.7% vs. 5.8%. Regarding the medically- attended events related to the study IP the 
incidence was the same between the two groups with 0.5%. The most two commons TEAS related to 
the study vaccination for both 2 groups were respectively: fatigue (2.1% vs 2.9) and arthralgia (1.4 vs 
1.6 %). No fatal cases and no discontinuation of the study was due to an AE.

Unsolicited Adverse Events by Pre-booster SARS 
In the safety Set there were included in the mRNA-1273 50 µg booster dose group (Part G) 22.0% 
participants with a positive pre-booster SARS-CoV-2 status and 77.8% participants with a negative pre-
booster SARS-CoV-2 status (1 participant with missing status). The incidence of all unsolicited TEAEs was 
comparable in participants with positive pre-booster SARS-CoV-2 status (13.5%) and participants with 
negative pre-booster SARS-CoV-2 status (20.0%). The incidence of SAEs, MAAEs, and Grade 3 or higher 
TEAEs was similar between the two groups. In the mRNA-1273 50 µg booster dose group (Part F), 26.8% 
participants had positive pre-booster SARS-CoV-2 status and 70.8% participants had a negative pre-
booster SARS-CoV-2 status (9 participants with missing status). The incidence of all unsolicited TEAES 
was comparable between the two groups respectively 16.8% in the positive group and 22.1% in the 
negative pre-booster SARS-CoV-2 status. There were no safety concerns or differences identified in SAEs, 
MAAEs, and severe TEAEs based on pre-booster status. 
Unsolicited Adverse Events mRNA-1273.211 50 µg (P205 Part A) 
In the mRNA-1273.211 50 µg booster dose group (Part A) within 28 days after vaccination, there were no 
fatal events and no SAEs were reported. At least one MAAE was reported for 7.0%, participants, of whom 
one participant (0.3%) had an MAAE that was assessed by the investigator as related to the study 
vaccination (arthralgia). No participants had TEAEs leading to study discontinuation. 
Unsolicited TEAEs within 28 days after the mRNA-1273.211 50 µg booster dose (Part A), in total were 
reported in 21.0% participants. Of those, 9.0% participants had a TEAE that was assessed by the 
investigator as related to study vaccination. The most commonly reported unsolicited TEAEs within the 28 
days were fatigue (3.3%); arthralgia (1.7%); myalgia and injection site lymphadenopathy (1.3%); and 
rhinovirus infection and headache (1.0%). One participant (0.3%) had a severe TEAE of fatigue that was 
considered by the investigator to be related to vaccination. Table 37 describes a summary of the 
unsolicited TEAEs in P205 Part A.

Table 38: Summary of Unsolicited TEAEs up to 28 Days After the Injection – Study P205 Part A (Safety 
Set), source Table 27, clinical overview  
The summary of unsolicited TEAEs up to the data cut-off date (02 Feb 2022) included a total of 1.3 % 
participants in the mRNA-1273.211 50 µg booster dose group had an SAE, 51.0% participants had an 
MAAE, 1.3% participants had a Grade 3 or higher TEAE. One participant (0.3%) in the mRNA-1273 50 µg 
booster dose group had a fatal TEAE that was assessed by the investigator as not related to the study 
vaccination (myocardial infarction). The median follow-up time after the mRNA-1273.211 booster dose 
was 245 days. 
Deaths  
No deaths were reported in either the 50 µg mRNA-1273.214 booster dose group (P205 Part G) or the 50 
µg mRNA-1273 booster dose group (P205 Part F). 
One death was reported in the 50 µg mRNA-1273.211 booster dose group (Part A) 159 days after 
vaccination. A ≥60 year old male with a medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, 
hyperlipidaemia, and severe obesity had a fatal myocardial infarction 159 days after receiving the mRNA-
1273.211 50 µg booster dose. The investigator assessed the event as not related to mRNA-1273.211 and 
the MAH agreed with this assessment.  
CHMP comments:

A of the study. The participant received the booster injection in the left arm on Study Day 1. The 
participant’s pre-booster SARS-CoV-2 status was negative. The medical history included: 
gastroesophageal reflux disease, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, severe obesity, and Type 2 diabetes 
with the ongoing concomitant medications at the time of the event included: aspirin, omeprazole, 
simvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, metoprolol, Ozempic, Invokana, metformin, pioglitazone, 
and Januvia. 158 days after the booster dose, the participant experienced a Grade 5 serious adverse 
event (SAE) of myocardial infarction, meeting the SAE criteria of death. 158 days after the booster 
dose of the participant fell and became unresponsive. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed 
until EMS arrived. Upon arrival to the hospital, the participant was intubated but the event of 
myocardial infarction was fatal and the participant died on the same day. The participant never had a 
stable rhythm and the blood sugar was 182. The cause of death was myocardial infarction and an 
autopsy was not performed. The investigator assessed the event of myocardial infarction to be not 
related to the IP. It is agreed with the investigator judgement that the event is not related to the study 
IP and the assessment of relatedness might have been confounded by participant’s underlying 
cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities.  
Other Serious Adverse Events 
In the mRNA-1273.214 50 µg booster dose group (Part G), 2 participants (0.5%) had one SAE 
each within 28 days of the booster dose and both SAEs were assessed as not related to 
vaccination by the Investigator. The first case was a ≥60 year old female hospitalised on Study Day 14 
due to a severe traumatic pelvic fracture. The second event was a ≥60 year old male diagnosed with 
moderate prostate cancer on Study Day 2, with elevated prostate-specific antigen level 6 weeks prior to 
receipt of the booster dose and an enlarged prostate and underwent a biopsy 2 days prior to receiving the 
booster dose, confirming the diagnosis of prostate cancer. At the time of the data cut-off, both events 
were ongoing. There was an SAE beyond 28 days after the booster dose, a ≥60 male was hospitalised 
due to severe nephrolithiasis on Study Day 44 and the event resolved on Study Day 55. The Investigator 
assessed the event as not related to vaccination. 
In the mRNA-1273 50 µg booster dose group (Part F), 1 participant had an SAE within 28 days of the 
booster dose. A ≥60 year old female with a medical history of osteoarthritis had severe spinal 
osteoarthritis (verbatim: worsening lumbar osteoarthritis) on Study Day 9. The participant was 
hospitalised on Study Day 44 and underwent lumbar fusion, and the event resolved on Study Day 49. The 
Investigator assessed the event as not related to vaccination. No SAE were reported beyond 28 days from 
the booster, as of the data cut-off date (27 April 2022). A summary is provided in the table below for 
P205 Part G and Part F.

In the mRNA-1273.211 50 µg booster dose group (Part A), there were no SAEs up to 28 days 
after the booster dose. Four participants (1.3%) had 5 SAEs after Day 28 and through 
the data cut-off date; One participant had SAEs of dehydration and hypotension concurrently, and the 
remaining SAEs from 3 different participants included myocardial infarction (fatal event), peripheral 
arterial occlusive disease, and cholelithiasis. None of the SAEs were considered treatment related by the 
Investigator or MAH. The median follow-up time after the mRNA 1273.211 booster dose was 245 days. A

CHMP comments:  
As of the data cut-off date (27 April 2022) the most SAEs were reported until D28 after booster 
vaccination and can be considered as not related to the study IP.  
In the mRNA-1273.214 50 µg booster dose group (Part G), there were 3 SAEs in total, 2 SAEs reported 
within 28 days and 1 SAE reported beyond 28 days; a severe traumatic pelvic fracture on a ≥60 year 
old female hospitalised on D14 and the second SAE was a prostate cancer on D2. It is agreed upon 
with the investigator assessment for both cases not to be related with the Study IP.  
A Grade 3/SAE was reported beyond 28 days (43 days after the booster dose), on a ≥60 year old male 
as nephrolithiasis. The participant had ongoing medical conditions (including hypertension, 
hypothyroidism, water retention) and concomitant medications reported included lisinopril, 
levothyroxine, gabapentin, vitamin B complex, and Lasix). The participant developed kidney stones and 
was hospitalised, treatment in hospital included tamsulosin (Flomax), ibuprofen, hydrocodone 
acetaminophen (opioid/analgesic), Dilaudid (hydromorphone), and oxybutynin. Participant underwent 
right percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement; left ureteroscopy and an attempted cystoscopy with 
left ureteral stent. Patient was discharged five days after hospital admission and had a worsening 
nephrolithiasis six days after and being discharged again.  
Updated information was requested and provided from MAH: The event resolved nine days after the 
event onset on Study Day 55. Since the data cut-off, and as of 27 Jul 2022, the site confirmed the 
event was considered ongoing as the kidney stone had not passed. The site will continue to monitor 
this event, which was assessed as not related to vaccination by the investigator and it is agreed upon.

In the mRNA-1273 50 µg booster dose group (Part F) the SAE of spinal osteoarthritis on D9 after the 
booster dose is reported on a ≥60 year old female with previous medical conditions and concomitant 
medications. It is agreed upon with the investigator assessment not to be related with the study IP. 
Medically-Attended ARs and Vaccine Related ARs 
P205 Part G 
In the mRNA-1273.214 50 µg booster dose group (Part G) up to the data cut-off were reported in total 74 
MAAEs, in 13.3% participants and from them 52 MAAEs (9.8% participants) were reported within 28 days 
after the booster dose. In summary, the most commonly reported MAAEs (for more than 1 participant), 
were: COVID-19 (1.8%), upper respiratory tract infection (1.4%) and coronavirus infection (non-COVID; 
0.9%). 2 MAAE were also SAEs (traumatic fracture and prostate cancer) reported within 28 days and one 
SAE (nephrolithiasis) beyond 28 days. There have been 2 non-serious MAAEs in 2 participants assessed 
as related to vaccination by the Investigator as follows: An event of moderate fatigue in a ≥60 year old 
female with a relevant medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and iron deficiency. The 
event had a self-limiting reactogenicity with a duration from D2 to D13 of the study. The other event was 
a mild dermatitis (verbatim: unspecified dermatitis, with the duration from D7 to day D19 of the study 
and the treatment included oral and topical diphenhydramine hydrochloride. One MAAE was also reported 
as a SAE and it is described in the respective section.  
P205 Part F 
In the mRNA-1273 50 µg booster dose group (Part F) up to the data cut-off were reported in total 104 
MAAEs, in 22.5% participants and from them 56 MAAEs (13.8% participants) were reported within 28 
days after the booster dose. In total, the most commonly reported were: upper respiratory tract infection 
(4.0%), followed by coronavirus infection (2.4%). Two non-serious MAAEs in 2 participants within 28 
days were assessed as related to vaccination by the Investigator: one event of mild hypertension 
(verbatim: high blood pressure without diagnosis of hypertension) in a 50-59 year old female, with no 
relevant medical history had mild hypertension starting on Study Day 13. The event worsened as a 
moderate MAAE of hypertension, no longer assessed as related to Study IP on D30 and the treatment 
included amlodipine. The other event was a mild urticarial (verbatim: generalised urticaria), reported in a 
30-39 year old female with no relevant medical history, with a duration from D18- D22 and treatment 
oral diphenhydramine hydrochloride. One of the MAAEs with onset beyond 28 days from the booster dose 
was assessed as related to vaccination by the Investigator was an event of mild back pain (verbatim: 
worsening of chronic back pain) reported in a 50-59 year old female with a medical history of chronic 
back pain started on Study Day 33. At the time of the data cut-off, the event was ongoing.  
P205 Part A 
In the mRNA-1273.211 50 µg booster dose group (Part A) up to the data cut-off were reported in total 
268 MAAEs in 51.0% participants and from them 22 MAAEs (7.0% participants) were within 28 days after 
the booster dose. The most commonly reported MAAEs were COVID-19 (12.3%); rhinovirus infection

(3.0%), viral infection (2.7%), urinary tract infection (2.3%), hypertension (2.3%), sinusitis (2.0%), and 
anxiety (2.0%). One participant had an MAAE that was assessed by the investigator as related to the 
study IP, a grade 2 event of arthralgia started from D3-D16 and also a reactivation beyond 28 Days. The 
median follow-up time after the mRNA-1273.211 booster dose was 245 days. 
CHMP comments: The follow up period for P205 Part G study and P205 Part F study as described 
above was 43 days. The total number of MAAE reported for Part G was 74 and mostly of them were 
manifested within 28 days (52 out of 74). 
The number of MAAE for P205 Part F was 104 and 56 of them were reported within 28 days. It is 
observed that for the same follow up period the number of MAAEs was lower in the Omicron bivalent 
booster dose group compared to the original Spikevax dose group. The cases have been assessed and 
described in the respective sections throughout the text and it is agreed with the investigator 
judgement on the ARs study related vaccine. Additional information has been provided from MAH 
regarding the nephrolithiasis event. The follow up period was longer for the P205 Part A with a median 
of 245 days, however the number of MAAEs reported within 28 days was relatively low with 22 out of 
268 in total.  
The comparison of unsolicited AEs and the Study IP related ARs in the mRNA-1273 and 
mRNA-1273.214 groups did not raise any new safety concerns. 
Comparison with Study 201 Part B, a 50 µg first booster of mRNA-1273 after mRNA-1273 
primary series 
In study 201 Part B, a 50 µg first booster dose of mRNA-1273 after mRNA-1273 primary series was 
administered in 330 participants The most common solicited local AR after the 50 µg boost dose was pain 
(86.3%). Any erythema was reported in 5.5% participants. Most solicited local ARs were grade 1 to grade 
2 in severity. Pain was the most commonly reported grade 3 local AR in P201 Part B and no grade 4 
solicited local ARs were reported. The most common systemic ARs were: headache (57.4%), fatigue, 
myalgia (muscle aches all over the body), arthralgia (aching in several joints), nausea/vomiting, fever, 
and chills. No grade 4 solicited systemic ARs were reported.  
CHMP comments:  
Reactogenicity results of mRNA-1273.214 50 μg as a second booster were comparable with the results 
for the mRNA-1273, given as a 50 µg first booster dose after mRNA-1273 primary series, in 330 
participants enrolled in study 201 part B.  
Discontinuation From IP or Study Participation 
No participants in either the mRNA-1273.214 group or the mRNA-1273 group discontinued due to a 
Treatment related adverse event (TEAE). In Study P205 Part A, no participants who received mRNA-
1273.211 50 µg discontinued due to a TEAE.

Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Analysis of AESIs has been performed using investigator assessment of events at the time of reporting, 
based on programmed summaries of reported AEs based on SMQs, and based on PTs consistent with the 
CDC working case definitions for myocarditis and pericarditis (CMQ).A priority list of AESIs relevant to the 
development of COVID-19 vaccines was created by the Brighton Collaboration (Law 2020) and was 
included in the Study P205 protocol (Appendix 4, Section 10.4).  
Investigator-Assessed AESIs in mRNA-1273.214 50 µg (P205 Part G) and mRNA-1273 50 µg 
(P205 Part F)  
Up to the data cut-off date, no participants in the mRNA-1273.214 50 µg booster dose group (Part G) had 
an investigator-assessed AESI. In the mRNA-1273 50 µg booster dose group (Part F), 1/377 participants 
(0.3%) had an investigator-assessed AESI. There was reported a moderate non-serious irregular heart 
rate (verbatim: unspecified irregular heartbeat) on a ≥60 year old male, on Day 17 after the mRNA1273 
50 µg booster dose. Medical history included hypertension, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia, 
osteoarthritis, prostate cancer, and seasonal allergy. The event had not resolved and no diagnosis has 
been made available and the assessed the event as not related to study vaccination. Information has 
been asked regarding the event of the unspecified irregular heartbeat.  
In the mRNA-1273.211 50 µg (P205 Part A), there were no investigator-assessed AESIs up to 28 days 
after the mRNA-1273.211 50 µg booster dose but one participant (0.3%) had an investigator-assessed 
AESI of fatal acute myocardial infarction on Study Day 159, considered by the investigator to be 
unrelated to vaccination.  
CHMP comments:  
The event of the unspecified irregular heartbeat has not been resolved and no final diagnoses have 
been made available until the data cut-off. Upon request information has been obtained on the  
 event of the ‘unspecified irregular heartbeat’ on Day 17 after the mRNA1273 50 µg booster dose. The 
site updated the event term from irregular heart rate to supraventricular tachycardia following 
diagnosis by a cardiologist. The participant had commenced treatment with Pradaxa around three 
months earlier (reported as ongoing) and at the time when this application was submitted for 
assessment the participant was awaiting treatment with intravenous adenosine for cardioversion 
followed by cardiac ablation. The event of supraventricular tachycardia was reported as non-serious 
and moderate in intensity, and the Investigator assessed the event as not related to vaccination. It is 
agreed upon, however close monitoring is recommended until all the procedures have been performed.  
The AESI of fatal acute myocardial infarction is described in the section of deaths. 
Events of clinical interest based on the narrow and the narrow and broad hypersensitivity 
standard Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities queries (SMQs) of Hypersensitivity 
The SMQ analyses (narrow and broad scope) of AEs within 28 days of the booster in all three parts was 
done for the list of diagnoses: ischemic heart disease, cardiac failure, cardiomyopathy, embolic and 
thrombotic events, CNS vascular disorders, hearing and vestibular disorders, convulsions, demyelination,

hematopoietic cytopenias, peripheral neuropathy, thrombophlebitis, or vasculitis. Table 40 provides a 
summary of these cases.

(Narrow Scope) — 2nd Booster. Dose: mRNA-1273.214, mRNA-1273, source Table 14.3.1.22.2.1.8 
Study P205 Part G 
In the mRNA-1273.214 50 µg booster dose group (Part G) within 28 days after vaccination, no events 
were captured in the SMQs (narrow and broad scope) for the above mentioned diagnoses. Cases with PTs 
identified by SMQs were medically reviewed and addressed as follows: 
Cardiac arrhythmia SMQ: Moderate Tachycardia event, on a 50-59 year old female with a medical history 
of obesity, start on D7 and resolved the same day and assessed as unrelated to the study IP and of 
unknown aetiology.  
Assessment report

Hypersensitivity SMQ: Nonserious mild Dermatitis, on a 50-59 year old female, with a duration from D7-
D19 and was assessed by the investigator as related to vaccination. A nonserious event of mild urticaria 
(also reported under angioedema SMQ) on a ≥60 year old male, with a duration from D2 to Day 34, not 
medically attended and assessed by the investigator as related to vaccination. A case of contact 
dermatitis (Day7) and a case of macular rash on study Day 5, both events assessed as unrelated to the 
study IP by the investigator. 
Arthritis SMQ: A moderate Rheumatoid arthritis on a ≥60 year old female, on Study Day 27 and on the 
same day the participant underwent excision of rheumatoid nodules of her hand. The medical history 
included bilateral osteoarthritis of the hands, myocardial infarction, and hypothyroidism. The event was 
ongoing as of the data cut-off and was assessed by the investigator as unrelated to vaccination.  
No new events were reported captured in SMQs beyond 28 days up to the cut-off data.  
Study P205 Part F 
In the mRNA-1273 50 µg group (Part F) within 28 days after vaccination, no events were captured for the 
SMQs (narrow and broad scope). Cases of interest following medical review and considered as unrelated 
to the study IP were: Irregular heart rate; peripheral oedema; urticarial event on a 50-59 year old 
female; asthma; contact dermatitis (2 participants); eczema and muscular weakness. One event of 
nonserious MAAE of mild urticarial, on a 30-39 year old female has been assessed as related to 
vaccination by the investigator. Cases considered of interest beyond 28 days were: cardiac failure, 
arthritis, anaemia and hypoesthesia. They were all assessed as unrelated to the study IP by the 
investigator, and it is agreed upon.  
Study P205 Part A 
In the mRNA-1273.211 50 µg booster dose group (Part A) within 28 days after vaccination, no events 
were captured for the SMQs (narrow and broad scope) for the list of diagnoses mentioned above. Some 
events of clinical interest were: Supraventricular tachycardia (1 participant) and Dyspnoea (1 participant) 
and they were assessed as not related to the study vaccine and it is agreed upon. There were not 
reported events of clinical interest beyond 28 days up to the data cut-off (median of 245 days).  
CHMP comment:  
As of the data cut-off no cases of anaphylaxis or severe hypersensitivity reaction were reported. For 
the listed diagnoses under the SMQ analyses (narrow and broad scope) of AEs there were no 
imbalances found between the parts of the Study 205.  
The cases identified by SMQs for the Study P205 Part G for each of the diagnoses mentioned above 
were observed each in 1/437= 0.2 % participants and did not identify any new safety concerns. It is 
agreed upon the cases assessed as non-related to the study IP. Regarding the events assessed as 
Study IP related they include: One event of mild dermatitis (verbatim: unspecified dermatitis [both 
palms and (L) pinky toe]) on a 50-59 year old female, with the duration from on Day 7- Day 19 and 
treatment included oral and topical diphenhydramine hydrochloride. The event of mild urticaria on a

≥60 year old male, with the duration from Day 2- Day 34, not medically attended, was considered by 
the investigator to be related to vaccination, and it is agreed upon.  
Upon request the full narrative and causality assessment has been provided for the event of 
‘Tachycardia’ captured in the Cardiac Arrhythmia SMQ Assessment in a 50-59 year old female 
participant who received mRNA-1273.214 (Part G). The participant, a 50-59 year old female, received 
a second booster dose of 50 ug mRNA-1273.214, medical history include chronic diseases and 
concomitant medications. On Study Day 5, the participant developed non-serious grade 2 / moderate 
symptomatic COVID-19 characterised by chills, cough, fatigue headache, sore throat, congestion and a 
runny nose. On the same day, treatment for the COVID-19 infection included oral dextromethorphan 
10 mg; paracetamol 325 mg; phenylephrine 5 mg. Two days later, on Study Day 7, the participant 
experienced non-serious grade 2 / moderate tachycardia (reported verbatim: tachycardia [unknown 
aetiology]) that was self-limiting and resolved the same day. On the same day, treatment for the 
COVID-19 infection ended and on Study Day 37, the symptomatic COVID-19 infection was considered 
fully resolved. The Investigator assessed the event of tachycardia as not related to vaccination and it is 
agreed upon, most likely it was confounded by the concurrent symptomatic COVID-19 infection and 
treatment with phenylephrine.  
In the Study P205 Part F the cases identified by SMQs for the above mentioned diagnoses were 
observed each in 1/377 = 0.3% participants with the exception of urticarial which has been observed 
in 2 participants (0.5%). One of the urticarial events (verbatim: generalised urticaria) was assessed as 
related to the study vaccination, an event of mild urticaria on a 30-39 year old female with no relevant 
medical history, with the onset on Study Day 18 and the event resolved 4 days later (Study Day 22). 
Treatment included oral diphenhydramine hydrochloride and the event resolved 4 days later (Study 
Day 22). 
No events assessed related to the study vaccination have been reported in the Study P205 Part A 
for the list of diagnoses mentioned above. There were 2 reported events of clinical interest: 
Supraventricular tachycardia on a 50-59 year old (Study Day 9) (verbatim: worsening of SVT non-
sustained). Treatment included metoprolol and was resolved 3 days later. The event was an MAAE and 
was reported as resolved with sequelae 3 days later. This event was also captured in the CMQ 
of myocarditis and pericarditis. It is agreed with the investigator assessment for the event as not 
related to vaccination. The other event of dyspnoea on a 50-59 year old male (Study Day 8), with an 
unknown aetiology was self-resolved 2 days later, no medical treatment was provided and it was 
assessed as not related to the study IP.  
The follow up duration of 43 days for both parts G and F is considered relatively short however no 
safety concern have been raised and the results reassure the acceptable reactogenicity profile of 
mRNA-1273.214, when administered 3 months following a booster dose of mRNA-1273 after 
completion of a primary series. This is adequately addressed in the Risk Section of the CTP. 
Myocarditis and Pericarditis Events Enhanced Assessment Using CMQ  
The CMQ analysis did not identify any cases fulfilling the CDC working case definition for probable or 
confirmed cases of acute myocarditis or acute pericarditis in P205 Parts G, F, and A. 
Assessment report  
EMA/896245/2022 
Page 174/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No additional events of potential myocarditis or pericarditis were identified with the CMQ that had not 
already been captured in the SMQ analyses in the mRNA-1273.214 50 µg (Part G); mRNA-1273 50 µg 
(Part F) booster dose groups or in the mRNA-1273.211 50 µg (Part A) booster dose group. 
Pregnancy  
No pregnancies were reported in the mRNA-1273.214 50 µg booster dose group (P205 Part G) or in the 
mRNA-1273 50 µg booster dose group (P205 Part F) up to the data cut-off.  
Also, no pregnancies were reported in the mRNA-1273.211 50 µg booster dose group (P205 Part A) up to 
the data cut-off. 
Post-marketing experience 
Safety Data for Dose 3 and Dose 4 
Cumulatively as of 15 Apr 2022, a total of 1,091,443,760 doses of mRNA-1273 had been delivered to 88 
countries, and an estimated total of 633,071,724 doses of mRNA-1273 had been administered, including 
an estimated 126,556,471 doses administered that were Dose 3 or a subsequent dose. Up to the data 
cut-off, the MAH has received 531,696 cases including 2,1014,965 events reported after any dose. The 
MAH reported to having received 42,226 cases (124,242 events) reported after Dose 3 or Dose 4 of 
mRNA-1273. There were 41,625 cases (122,901 events) reported after Dose 3 and 607 cases (1,341 
events) after Dose 4. Of the cumulatively reported Dose 3 and Dose 4 cases, 11,926 cases were 
medically confirmed, 15,551 cases were serious, and 361 cases had fatal outcomes. The majority of cases 
were reported in females (64.4%) compared to males (31.0%, 13,089) with the mean age of 49.2 years 
(SD: 16.2; median: 48.0 years).  
CHMP comment: The MAH has explained that the post-marketing global safety database does not 
fully distinguish between a third 100-µg dose, indicated for immunocompromised individuals in some 
settings, and a 50-µg booster dose for immunocompetent individuals. Dose 4 may refer to the first 50 
µg booster dose for immunocompromised individuals or may refer to the second booster for 
immunocompetent individuals.  
Myocarditis and Pericarditis in Individuals Receiving a Third Dose 
Cumulatively as of 15 Apr 2022, there were reported 431 events of myocarditis and pericarditis, 
respectively 283 events of myocarditis and 148 events of pericarditis following a third dose of mRNA-
1273. The cases involved 272 males (65.9%) and 140 females (33.9%), with a mean age of 42.9 years 
and a median age of 40 years. The time to onset from vaccination was less than 7 days for 69.1% of the 
events. A summary of the observed events of Myocarditis after any dose are given in Table 41:

Table 42: Observed Versus Expected Analyses of Myocarditis, Cases Occurring within 7 Days of a Known 
Dose, Cumulative Through April 2022*, source table 30, Clinical Overview 
CHMP comments:  
The events of myocarditis and pericarditis occurring in a time period within 7 days after any dose are 
more frequent in males compare to females. The myocarditis rates are higher after dose 2 compared to 
dose 1 and they continue to be lower following dose 3 compared with dose 2 for almost all the age 
strata. The age group at the highest risk belong to age strata of 12 to 39 years of age; the highest 
observed vs expected ratio was reported in the age group 18-24 years old and accordingly the ratio is 
1.82% post Dose 1; 8.79% post Dose 2 and 1.43% post Dose 3. However, it is agreed with MAH that 
the post-marketing data for dose 3 are limited and estimates may change as the demographic 
characteristics of dose 3 recipients change over time. 
The reporting rates for myocarditis are given for a time frame of 7 days post any dose. This is 
considered relatively short and analyses of myocarditis cases should take an extended time frame of at 
least 30 days into account. However, the MAH in previous responses has explained that the 7 days post 
dose analysis is based on all the evaluations conducted by health authorities, research organisations, 
Assessment report

as well as information from the MAH’s safety database that have identified the 0-7 days as the greatest 
risk interval to experienced vaccine related myocarditis or pericarditis events. Analysis conducted by 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) utilising the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) as of 
15 January 2022, showed an increased risk for myocarditis and pericarditis observed after both dose 1 
and dose 2 of Spikevax in the 0–7-day risk interval, with a greater risk following dose 2 (ACIP 2022). 
The MAH has reported the number of myocarditis and pericarditis following dose 3 but there was no 
information on these events following dose 4. Upon request data were provided and cumulative as of 
18 July 2022, there have been 7 reports of myocarditis after receiving a dose 4 of Spikevax, 5 males 
and 2 females. All the reports were considered serious (SAEs). Median age for these reports was 75 
years old (min: 40/ max: 81), with a time onset from 1 day to 102 days. All cases are from the 
European Economic Area. WHO-UMC causality assessment has been used and two cases were 
considered unlikely related to the vaccine due to associated comorbidities that provide a more plausible 
explanation for the occurrence of the events. The other 5 cases were considered assessable due to the 
lack on important information including any laboratory or diagnostic results. A brief summary of the 
cases is described: A pericarditis event reported in a >70 year old man with other co morbidities and 
on current medications. A myocarditis events in a >70 year old female, with no information on 
previous medical history or on going medications, considered as recovered with sequelae. A pericarditis 
event in a >80 year old male with co-morbidities and current medications; a pericarditis in a >70 year 
old male; a pericarditis in a 40-49 year old female and a myocarditis event in a 40-49 year old male. 
The information is submitted from MAH as an Excel format with the above respective cases. The cases 
were assessable at the time of data submission however, close monitoring and follow up information is 
recommended. 
Laboratory findings 
No scheduled laboratory assessments for safety were implemented in the study.  
Safety in special populations 
No data were available regarding the use of mRNA-1273.214 50 in pregnant women and there were no 
pregnancies reported in Study P205 in Part G, Part F and Part A.  
Regarding the Pre-booster SARS- CoV-2 Status, it was observed that reactogenicity for mRNA-1273.214 
50 μg given as a second booster (Part G) was overall similar to that observed with the mRNA-1273 
booster vaccination 50 μg given as a second booster, regardless of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection before the 
booster dose.  
The mRNA-1273.214 has been studied in individuals 
18 years of age.

Study mRNA-1273-P205 is an ongoing open label Phase 2/3 study with multiple, sequentially-enrolled 
cohorts to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of variant-modified booster candidate vaccines. The 
part included in this submission are P205 Part G, Part F and Part A.  
This submission intends to seek authorisation for the mRNA-1273.214 Omicron-containing bivalent 
vaccine and to show its ability to elicit superior and broader antibody responses, compared to the current 
monovalent booster vaccine mRNA-1273, and therefore it is likely to confer enhanced protection against 
COVID-19.  
The data snapshot for P205 Part G (mRNA-1273.214 50) and P205 Part F (mRNA-1273 50 µg) is 27 April 
2022. The data snapshot for P205 Part A (mRNA-1273.211) is 02 Feb 2022.  
The safety data base comprises safety and immunogenicity data from subjects summarised below:  
The 50 μg mRNA-1273.214 (P205 Part G) given as a second booster dose in 437 subjects, administered 
with a median of 136 days after a first booster dose of mRNA-1273 50 μg and a median follow-up 
duration of 43 days. (P205 Part G) 
Comparative data for the 50 μg mRNA-1273 given as a second booster in 377 subjects, administered with 
a median of 134 days after a first booster dose of mRNA-1273 50 μg and a median follow-up duration of 
57 days. (P205 Part F) 
Supplemented data from the bivalent 50 μg mRNA-1273.211 vaccine given as a first booster in 300 
subjects, administered with a median of 264 days after the second dose of the primary series and with a 
median follow-up duration of 245 days. (P205 Part A) 
The safety assessments for study P205 parts G, F and A consisted in the observation of the solicited local 
and systemic adverse events during the 7-day follow-up period after vaccination. The unsolicited adverse 
events were monitored during the 28-day follow-up period after vaccination. This has included any AE 
reported by the participant that is not specified as a solicited AR in the protocol or is specified as a 
solicited AR but starts outside the protocol-defined period for reporting solicited ARs (ie, 7 days after 
vaccination). The SAEs, MAAEs, AEs leading to withdrawal and AESIs were collected throughout the 
study. The solicited adverse events and an overview of unsolicited AE data were summarised by 
subgroups based on pre-booster baseline SARS-CoV-2 status (positive or negative) for the mRNA-
1273.214 50 μg booster dose group (Part G) and the mRNA-1273 50 μg booster dose group (Part F).  
Demography and baseline characteristics 
Demography and baseline characteristics were balanced between the Part G and Part F of the P205 study. 
This has also applied for the P205 Part A. There were more females than males, respectively 59% females 
in part G and 50.7% in Part F. More than 80% of study subjects were White across the groups. The 
median age was 60.0 years, respectively 60.2% participants were ≥ 18 and < 65 years and 39.8% 
participants were ≥ 65 years of age for both Part G and Part F. The majority of the participants were 
SARS-CoV-2 seronegative at baseline, respectively 77.8% in Part G and 70.8% in Part F.  
In the P205 Part A there were enrolled more females (55.7%), the median age was 51.0 years, and 
20.7% were ≥ 65 years of age. The majority of the participants were SARS-CoV-2 seronegative at 
baseline, with 98.7% participants.  
Local and systemic reactogenicity 
The incidence of solicited local reactions is comparable between the mRNA-1273.214 50 µg booster dose 
group (Part G) and the mRNA-1273 50 µg booster dose group (Part F), accordingly 79.4% vs. 79.5%.  
Assessment report  
EMA/896245/2022 
Page 178/191 
 
 
 
 
 
However, if comparison is done between each solicited local reaction, it has been observed slightly higher 
reactogenicity in the mRNA-1273.214 50 µg booster dose group (Part G) vs. the mRNA-1273 50 µg 
booster dose group (Part F). The most common local ARs for both groups: were “any pain” with 77.3% 
vs. 76.6%, followed by “any axillary swelling or tenderness” with 17.4% vs 15.4%. The highest 
differences were noticed regarding any erythema (redness) reported in 30/437 participants (6.9%) in the 
mRNA-1273.214 50 µg booster dose group (Part G) and in 13/ 351 participants (3.7%) in the mRNA-
1273 50 µg booster dose group (Part F).  
The majority of solicited local ARs were mild- to- moderate (Grade 1-2) for both groups.  
Regarding the Grade 3 local ARs, same frequency has been observed in the two groups with (3.4%), 
however “erythema” was the most common Grade 3 local AR for P205 Part G with 2.1% versus 0.6% for 
P205 Part F. MAH has provided information on the Grade 3 erythema events (n=9) in the mRNA-
1273.214 50 and they did have a duration from 1-5 days. No grade 4 events were reported in both 
Groups. After the booster injection, the median duration of solicited local ARs was 2 days. The slightly 
higher rate of erythema after booster vaccination with mRNA-1273.214 is deemed acceptable and does 
not trigger concerns about the reactogenicity profile of the bivalent vaccine. 
The incidence of solicited systemic reactions was slightly higher in the mRNA-1273.214 50 µg booster 
dose group (Part G) compared to the mRNA-1273 50 µg booster dose group (Part F), accordingly 70.3% 
and 66.1%. The most common systemic AR after the booster dose for both groups accordingly were: 
fatigue (54.9% vs 51.4%), followed by headache (43.9% vs 41.1%), myalgia (39.6% vs 38.6%), and 
arthralgia (31.1% vs 31.7%). The majority of the systemic ARs in both groups were mild-to- moderate 
(Grade 1 -2) and they were comparable between the two groups. Grade 3 events were in higher 
frequency in the mRNA-1273.214 50 µg booster dose (5.5%) compared to (4.6%) in the mRNA-1273 50 
µg booster dose group, the most common Grade 3 event reported in the Part G was fatigue (3.4 % vs 
3.1%) while in Part F was myalgia (3.7% vs 2.3%). 
Regarding grade 3 AE local and systemic in the mRNA-1273.214 50 μg booster dose group (Part G): 
there were 58 Grade 3 local and systemic solicited ARs reported in 35 participants, none of them were 
considered SAEs. The most frequently reported were: fatigue (n=16; duration range: 1 to 14 day), 
followed by myalgia (n=10; duration: all 1 day), erythema (n=9; duration range: 1 to 5 days), headache 
(n=6; duration: all 1 day), swelling (n=5; duration range 1 to 4 days), and pain (n=4; duration: all 1 
day) and arthralgia (n=4; duration: all 1 day). The remaining grade 3 / severe solicited ARs of axillary 
swelling or tenderness, fever, nausea/vomiting and chills were each reported once, and the duration was 
1 day for all events.  
The 28 solicited ARs in 21 participants occurred within 7 days of vaccination and persisted beyond Day 7 
post vaccination. None of the events were serious and they all resolved and only one event was medically 
attended (event of fatigue from Study Day 2 to Study Day 13). The most frequently reported solicited AR 
that persisted beyond Day 7 were fatigue (n=9) followed by arthralgia (n=6), headache (n=5), injection 
site pain (n=3) and myalgia (n=2). The remaining events of injection site swelling/induration, injection 
site erythema and axillary swelling or tenderness were reported once each. No safety concerns have been 
identified. It is concluded that the reactogenicity between groups G (mRNA-1273.214) and F (mRNA-
1273) is comparable. There seems to be a trend towards slightly higher incidences for systemic ADRs or 
Assessment report  
EMA/896245/2022

regarding the local ADR of erythema. However, it is these differences are not clinically relevant and do 
not trigger safety concerns.  
Unsolicited AEs 
Unsolicited adverse events regardless of the relationship to vaccination up to 28 days after the second 
booster doses were reported in 18.5% of participants in the mRNA-1273.214 and 20.7% in the m 
RNA-1273 groups. It is observed that it was slightly lower in the mRNA-1273.214 booster group dose. 
The incidences of AEs considered related to the study vaccination by the investigator were comparable 
between the two booster groups, respectively 5.7% in the mRNA-1273.214 group and 5.8% in the 
mRNA-1273 group. In the mRNA-1273.214 group, 2 (0.5%) participants each experienced two serious 
adverse events (SAEs, prostate cancer and traumatic fracture) and 1 (0.3%) participant in the mRNA-
1273 group reported an SAE of spinal osteoarthritis within 28 days of the booster dose; none were 
assessed by the investigator to be related to study vaccination. Medically-attended adverse events 
(MAAEs) were 9.8% in the mRNA-1273.214 and 13.8% in the mRNA-1273 groups up to 28 days after 
vaccination. Regarding some of the unsolicited events additional information has been required and 
provided adequately from MAH.  
It is concluded that the reactogenicity of mRNA-1273.214 50 µg as booster dose is covered sufficiently 
with a short term follow up of more than a month (6 weeks). However, the MAH is requested to provide 
an interim CSR, including a comprehensive safety analysis with a later cut-off for the mRNA-1273.214 50 
µg booster dose group, once the data of the Day 91 interim analysis are available. 
Serious Adverse Events  
In the mRNA-1273.214 50 µg booster dose group (Part G), there were 3 SAEs reported in total, 2 events 
within 28 days and one event beyond 28 days as following: one severe traumatic pelvic fracture on a ≥60  
year old female hospitalised on D14, and the second SAE was a prostate cancer. For both these events is 
agreed upon with the investigator assessment not to be related with the Study IP. 
 A Grade 3/SAE was reported beyond 28 days on a ≥60 year old male as nephrolithiasis. The participant 
had ongoing medical conditions and concomitant medications and developed kidney stones and was 
hospitalised, treatment in hospital included tamsulosin (Flomax), ibuprofen, hydrocodone acetaminophen 
(opioid/analgesic), Dilaudid (hydromorphone), and oxybutynin. Participant underwent right percutaneous 
nephrostomy tube placement; left ureteroscopy and an attempted cystoscopy with left ureteral stent. 
Patient was discharged five days after hospital admission and had a worsening nephrolithiasis five days 
later and being discharged again. The event resolved nine days after the event onset on Study Day 55. 
Since the data cut-off, and as of 27 Jul 2022, the site confirmed the event was considered ongoing as the 
kidney stone had not passed. The site will continue to monitor this event, which was assessed as not 
related to vaccination by the investigator ad it is agreed upon.  
In the mRNA-1273 50 µg booster dose group (Part F), 1 participant had an SAE within 28 days of the 
booster dose, an event of lumbar osteoarthritis on Study Day 9. It is agreed upon that the investigator 
Assessment report  
EMA/896245/2022 
Page 180/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
judgement that the event was not related to vaccination. No SAE were reported beyond 28 days in part F 
of the study.  
In the mRNA-1273.211 50 µg booster dose group (Part A), there were no SAEs up to 28 days while 5 
SAEs have been reported in 4 participants after Day 28 and through the data cut-off date. The events 
included 1 event of dehydration and hypotension concurrently, one event of myocardial infarction (fatal 
event), 1 SAE as peripheral arterial occlusive disease, and 1 SAE of cholelithiasis. None of the SAEs were 
considered treatment related by the Investigator or MAH and it is agreed upon.  
Deaths  
No deaths were reported in either the 50 µg mRNA-1273.214 booster dose group (P205 Part G) or the 50 
µg mRNA-1273 booster dose group (P205 Part F). 
One death was reported in the 50 µg mRNA-1273.211 booster dose group (Part A) 159 days after 
vaccination. A ≥60 year old male with a medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, 
hyperlipidaemia, and severe obesity had a fatal myocardial infarction 159 days after receiving the mRNA-
1273.211 50 µg booster dose. The investigator assessed the event as not related to mRNA-1273.211. It 
is agreed with the investigator judgement that the event is not related to the study IP and the 
assessment of relatedness might have been confounded by participant’s underlying cardiovascular and 
metabolic comorbidities. 
Medically-Attended ARs and Vaccine Related ARs 
In the P205 Part G study the number of MAAEs within 28 days was 52 out of a total of 74 and the most 
common reported were: COVID-19 (1.1%) and upper respiratory tract infection (1.1%) followed by 
coronavirus infection (non-COVID-19/0.7%), procedural pain (0.7%), and fatigue (0.5%). The Two non-
serious MAAEs in 2 participants assessed as related to the Study IP by the Investigator were an event of 
moderate fatigue on Study Day 2- Day 13 in a ≥60 year old female with a relevant medical history of 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and iron deficiency. The other event was a mild dermatitis on Day 
Study 7- 19. The Treatment included oral and topical diphenhydramine hydrochloride. There was event of 
nephrolithiasis beyond 28 days is described in the sections of serious adverse events.  
In P205 Part F, the number of MAAEs reported within and beyond 28 days was almost comparable, 
respectively 56 and 48, with a total number of 104 MAAEs. The most common reported were: Upper 
respiratory tract infection (2.4%), followed by coronavirus infection (2.1%), urinary tract infection 
(0.8%), hypertension (0.8%), rhinovirus infection (0.5%), and urticaria (0.5%). Two non-serious  
MAAEs in 2 participants within 28 days were assessed as related to Study IP and were one event of mild 
hypertension and the other an event of generalised urticaria, with a duration from D18- D22 and 
treatment oral diphenhydramine hydrochloride. One MAAEs with onset beyond 28 days, was an event of 
worsening of chronic back pain, at the time of the data cut-off, the event was ongoing.  
In the mRNA-1273.211 50 µg booster dose group (Part A) up to the data cut-off were reported in total 
268 MAAEs and from them 22 MAAEs were within 28 days after the booster dose. The most commonly 
reported MAAEs were COVID-19 (12.3%); rhinovirus infection (3.0%), viral infection (2.7%), urinary 
tract infection (2.3%), hypertension (2.3%), sinusitis (2.0%), and anxiety (2.0%). One participant had 
Assessment report  
EMA/896245/2022 
Page 181/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
an MAAE that was assessed by the investigator as related to the study IP, a grade 2 event of arthralgia 
started from D3-D16 and also a reactivation beyond 28 Days.  
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Up to the data cut-off date, no participants in the mRNA-1273.214 50 µg booster dose group (Part G) had 
an investigator-assessed AESI.  
In the mRNA-1273 50 µg booster dose group (Part F), 1/377 participants (0.3%) had an investigator-
assessed AESI. There was reported a moderate non-serious irregular heart rate (verbatim: unspecified 
irregular heartbeat) on a ≥60 year old male, on Day 17 after the mRNA1273 50 µg booster dose, with a 
relevant medical history including hypertension, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia, osteoarthritis, 
prostate cancer, and seasonal allergy. Upon request information has been submitted by the MAH and the 
event term was updated to supraventricular tachycardia following diagnosis by a cardiologist. At the time 
when this application was submitted for assessment the participant was awaiting treatment with 
intravenous adenosine for cardioversion followed by cardiac ablation. The event of supraventricular 
tachycardia was reported as non-serious and moderate in intensity, and the Investigator assessed the 
event as not related to vaccination. It is agreed upon, however close monitoring is recommended until all 
the procedures have been performed. 
In the mRNA-1273.211 50 µg (P205 Part A), there were no investigator-assessed AESIs up to 28 days 
after the mRNA-1273.211 50 µg booster dose but one participant (0.3%) had an investigator-assessed 
AESI of fatal acute myocardial infarction on Study Day 159, considered by the investigator to be 
unrelated to vaccination and described accordingly in the section of SAEs and deaths.  
SMQ Hypersensitivity, Narrow and Broad Scope:  
In Study 205 Part G, regarding the events assessed as Study IP related they include one event of mild 
dermatitis, with the duration from on Day 7- Day 19 and treatment included oral and topical 
diphenhydramine hydrochloride. Another event of mild urticarial, from Day 2- Day 34, not medically 
attended, was considered by the investigator to be related to vaccination, and it is agreed upon.  
Hypersensitivity is already included in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Cardiac Arrhythmia SMQ: Upon request, information has been provided for the event of ‘Tachycardia’ 
captured in the Cardiac Arrhythmia SMQ Assessment in a 50-59 year old female participant who received 
mRNA-1273.214 (Part G). The participant, a 50-59 year old female, received a second booster dose of 50 
ug mRNA-1273.214, medical history includes chronic diseases and concomitant medications. On Study 
Day 5, the participant developed non-serious grade 2 / moderate symptomatic COVID-19 characterised 
by chills, cough, fatigue headache, sore throat, congestion and a runny nose. On the same day, 
treatment for the COVID-19 infection included oral dextromethorphan 10 mg; paracetamol 325 mg; 
phenylephrine 5 mg. Two days later, on Study Day 7, the participant experienced non-serious grade 2 / 
moderate tachycardia (reported verbatim: tachycardia [unknown aetiology]) that was self-limiting and 
resolved the same day. On the same day, treatment for the COVID-19 infection ended and on Study Day 
37, the symptomatic COVID-19 infection was considered fully resolved. The Investigator assessed the 
event of tachycardia as not related to vaccination and it is agreed upon, most likely it was confounded by 
the concurrent symptomatic COVID-19 infection and treatment with phenylephrine.  
Assessment report  
EMA/896245/2022 
Page 182/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Upon request information has been provided on the ‘unspecified irregular heartbeat’ on Day 17 after the 
mRNA1273 50 µg booster dose. The site updated the event term from irregular heart rate to 
supraventricular tachycardia following diagnosis by a cardiologist. The participant had commenced 
treatment with Pradaxa approximately three months earlier (reported as ongoing) and at the time when 
this application was submitted for assessment the participant was awaiting treatment with intravenous 
adenosine for cardioversion followed by cardiac ablation. The event of supraventricular tachycardia was 
reported as non-serious and moderate in intensity, and the Investigator assessed the event as not related 
to vaccination. It is agreed upon, however close monitoring is recommended until all the procedures have 
been performed. 
No imbalance with regard to the SMQ Cardiomyopathy (Narrow and Broad Scope) has been identified in 
the two parts G and F, and the additional information has been adequately submitted from MAH. 
However, as the duration of follow up has been limited to 43 days in the mRNA-1273.214 50 µg booster 
dose group, MAH has been asked for a further safety analysis providing information on SAEs, AESIs and 
MAAEs with a later cut-off. MAH has not performed further safety analyses beyond the data-cut timepoint 
in the Day 29 interim analysis of study P205 part G (43 days of follow-up time), but MAH is planning a 
day 91 interim analysis and the MAH will have report of the day 91 interim analysis by 31 December 
2022. 
Therefore, it is concluded that the reactogenicity of mRNA-1273.214 50 µg as booster dose is covered 
sufficiently with a short term follow up of 43 days. 
Evaluation of myo-and pericarditis 
The CMQ analysis did not identify any cases fulfilling the CDC working case definition for probable or 
confirmed cases of acute myocarditis or acute pericarditis in P205 Parts G, F, and A. 
No additional events of potential myocarditis or pericarditis were identified with the CMQ that had not 
already been captured in the SMQ analyses in the mRNA-1273.214 50 µg (Part G); mRNA-1273 50 µg 
(Part F) booster dose groups or in the mRNA-1273.211 50 µg (Part A) booster dose group. 
The Myocarditis and Pericarditis in Individuals Receiving a Third Dose/ Post-marketing 
experience 
Cumulatively as of 15 Apr 2022, there were reported 283 events of myocarditis and 148 events of 
pericarditis following a third dose of mRNA-1273. The cases involved 272 males (65.9%) and 140 females 
(33.9%), with a mean age of 42.9 years and a median age of 40 years. The time to onset from 
vaccination was less than 7 days for 69.1% of the events.  
Upon request, data were provided on the number of myocarditis and pericarditis following dose 4. 
Cumulative as of 18 July 2022, there have been 7 reports of myocarditis after receiving a dose 4 of 
Spikevax, 5 males and 2 females. All the reports were considered serious (SAEs). Median age for these 
reports was 75 years old (min: 40/ max: 81), with a time onset from 1 day to 102 days. All cases are 
from the European Economic Area. WHO-UMC causality assessment has been used and two cases were 
considered unlikely related to the vaccine due to associated comorbidities that provide a more plausible 
explanation for the occurrence of the events. The other 5 cases were considered not assessable due to 
the lack on important information including any laboratory or diagnostic results. Close monitoring is 
Assessment report  
EMA/896245/2022 
Page 183/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommended, and MAH had implemented an enhanced surveillance on the events of myocarditis and 
pericarditis after vaccination with mRNA based COVID-19 vaccines.  
Discontinuations  
No participants in either the mRNA-1273.214 group or the mRNA-1273 group discontinued due to a 
Treatment related adverse event (TEAE). Regarding the 2 participants who discontinued the study in the 
mRNA- 1273.214 50 µg booster dose group, for both the discontinuation reasons did not include adverse 
events. This applied also in Study P205 Part A, where no participants who received mRNA-1273.211 50 
µg discontinued due to a TEAE.  
6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
In conclusion, based on the evaluation of all safety-related data reveals that the clinical safety profile of 
mRNA-1273.214 50 μg when administered as second booster dose is comparable to that of the currently 
approved monovalent booster vaccine mRNA-1273 50 μg (Wuhan-Hu-1). Slightly higher incidences of 
local and systemic adverse events were observed, when comparing mRNA-1273.214 50 μg administered 
as second booster to mRNA-1273 50 μg given as booster dose. All these adverse events fully resolved 
after several days. However, these minor differences are not clinically relevant and are not considered to 
have a significant impact on the safety profile of mRNA-1273.214 when compared to that of mRNA-1273. 
The safety set included 437 participants in Study P205 in Part G and 377 participants in Part F.  
Safety and reactogenicity of mRNA-1273.214 50 μg was consistent between participants with and without 
SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to the booster dose. 
Data from the long-term (up to Day 181) safety follow up of the Beta-containing bivalent vaccine (mRNA-
1273.211) has also been evaluated as an estimate for mRNA-1273.214 bivalent vaccine safety. No new 
safety signals or concerns have been observed to date with this bivalent vaccine. No new safety signals 
were identified during trial P205 in the Part G, Part F and Part A until the respective data cut-off.  
The safety short term follow-up was up to 43 days for the Study P205 Part G and Part F, with a cut-off 
date April 27, 2022. The MAH is planning a day 91 interim analysis and the MAH will have report of the 
day 91 interim analysis by 31 December 2022. 
It is concluded that the reactogenicity of mRNA-1273.214 50 µg as booster dose is covered sufficiently 
with a short term follow up of more than a month and that no concerns are emerging from the available 
data set regarding the safety profile of this bivalent vaccine. 
6.3.  Clinical recommendations 
The MAH provided a commitment to comply with the following clinical recommendations: 
Immunogenicity 
The MAH should provide the PsVNA validation reports for Omicron variants BA.1 and BA.4/BA.5 once 
available. Validation of these assays is expected to be completed prior to further analyses for Day 91 
interim analysis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/896245/2022 
Page 184/191 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The MAH should provide results on T-cell mediated immunity, as well as analyses of the genetic and/or 
phenotypic relationships of isolated SARS-CoV-2 strains to the vaccine sequence by characterising “the 
SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence of viral isolates and compare with the vaccine sequence, and to 
characterise the immune responses to vaccine breakthrough isolates” for the Day 91 interim analysis. 
Safety 
The MAH should provide an interim CSR, including a comprehensive safety analysis with a later cut-off for 
the mRNA-1273.214 50 µg booster dose group, once the data of the Day 91 interim analysis are 
available. 
7.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version 4.2 with this application. The (main) proposed RMP changes 
were the following: 
Summary of significant changes in this RMP:  
Compared to the previously approved Spikevax European Union (EU) RMP version 4.0, this RMP version 
4.2 has been updated: 
•

has been insufficient to meet study objectives, and further challenges are expected given limited 
use of Spikevax in individuals <30 years of age in some European countries. Data concerning 
safety in pregnancy will be obtained based on the ongoing mRNA-1273-P905 study in Europe and 
the new secondary database study in the US (mRNA-1273-P919).

8.  Update to the Product Information 
As a result of this group of variation, the SmPC, Labelling and the Package Leaflet have been updated 
(see Attachment 1). 
8.1.1.  Labelling exemptions 
The following exemptions from labelling requirements have been granted on the basis of Article 63.3 of 
Directive 2001/83/EC. In addition, the derogations granted should be seen in the context of the 
flexibilities described in the Questions and Answers on labelling flexibilities for COVID-19 vaccines 
(EMA/689080/2020 rev.1, from 16 December 2020) document which aims at facilitating the preparedness 
work of COVID-19 vaccine developers and the associated logistics of early printing packaging activities. 
The ultimate goal is to facilitate the large scale and rapid deployment of COVID-19 vaccines for EU 
citizens within the existing legal framework. 
Labelling exemptions 
Outer and immediate labelling (from start of supply to end of October 2022). 
All EU Member States have agreed to grant a temporary exemption for the use of the 120-200 initial PPQ 
batches with a “temporary labelling”. The exemption is granted until end of October 2022. These 
exemptions are justified on the necessity to label batches ahead of time.

9.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit-risk balance 
The MAH has developed a modified bivalent vaccine mRNA-1273.214 (Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron 
BA.1) which contains 25 µg each of mRNA encoding the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 spike sequence and the 
Omicron BA.1 spike sequence in response to the continued emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants. With the 
present variation procedure, the MAH is seeking approval for mRNA-1273.214 to be used as 1st or 2nd 
booster vaccine in adolescents and adults ≥12 years of age and older at least 3 months following a 
primary series or previous booster dose with Spikevax or another authorised mRNA based or adenoviral 
Assessment report

vectored COVID-19 vaccine. In support of this claim, the MAH has submitted data from clinical trials 
addressing the immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity. 
Vaccine efficacy is inferred from immunological endpoints, mostly titres of neutralising antibodies. No 
efficacy/effectiveness studies have been conducted in support of the present variation procedure. Results 
from study P205 Part F and Part G are presented for comparison of neutralising antibody titres after 2nd 
booster vaccinations with either bivalent mRNA-1273.214 or monovalent mRNA-1273. Neutralising 
antibody titres against the ancestral (Wuhan-Hu-1) strain and SARS-CoV-2 variants Omicron BA.1 and 
BA.4, BA.5 are compared, as well as the geometric mean fold rise and geometric mean ratio. Statistical 
analysis of the results on Day 29 supported superiority in eliciting neutralising antibody responses after 
2nd booster vaccination with the bivalent mRNA-1273.214 vs. original mRNA-1273. ELISA results on 
binding antibodies against ancestral SARS-CoV-2 S-protein and SARS-CoV-2 variants supports the 
broadening of the immune response after vaccination with mRNA.1273.214.  
The MAH presented supporting immunogenicity data on 1st booster vaccination from study P205. In study 
P205 Part A another bivalent vaccine mRNA-1273.211 (Original + Beta) 50 µg was used as a 1st booster 
vaccination. A booster-to-booster comparison of neutralising antibody results after 1st booster vaccination 
with mRNA-1273.211 vs. mRNA-1273 from study P201 Part B is presented. Statistical analysis of the 
results supported superiority in eliciting neutralising antibody responses after 1st booster vaccination with 
the bivalent mRNA-1273.211 vs. original mRNA-1273 on Day 29 and Day 181. 
Incidence rates of COVID-19 after 2nd booster vaccination with mRNA-1273.214 or mRNA-1273 need to 
be considered descriptive as study P205 was not designed to assess efficacy. In addition, P205 Part F and 
Part G have not been enrolled in parallel and as a consequence the viral landscape of SARS-CoV-2 
variants might have been different with regards to prevalent strains.  
SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred in both treatment arms with a higher incidence after vaccination with 
mRNA-1273.214. However, none of the infected participants had an ER visit or hospitalisation. Out of 11 
cases in mRNA-1273.214 vaccinated participants 5 have sequencing data available that demonstrate 
variant Omicron BA.2 infection, in line with the prevalence of Omicron BA.2 at that time. No sequencing 
data are presently available for cases in the mRNA-1273 vaccinated group. 
The MAH is seeking approval for the bivalent mRNA-1273.214 (Original + Omicron) as a 1st or 2nd booster 
immunisation to prevent from COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in adolescents and adults aged 12 years 
of age and older. Study P205 has enrolled adults ≥18 years of age and older. 
The MAH has previously received authorisation for the use of the original mRNA-1273 50 µg as a 1st 
booster vaccination in adolescent ≥12 to 17 years of age and in adults ≥18 years of age and older. 
Authorisation was granted based on immunobridging between adolescents ≥12 to 17 years of age 
compared to young adults ≥18 to 25 years of age. As there is no obvious scientific reason to assume that 
basic immunogenicity characteristics would be significantly different for the immunobridging approach 
applied for the approval of the mRNA-1273 booster dose in adolescents this is considered valid also for 
mRNA-1273.214. 
Bivalent mRNA-1273.211 50 µg (Original + Beta) was compared to mRNA-1273 as a 1st booster dose 
after the primary vaccination series, indicating efficient increase in neutralising antibodies against 
ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and variant Beta, and a broadening of the immune response to other variants.  
The safety set included 437 participants in Study P205 in Part G and 377 participants in Part F.  
The evaluation of all safety-related data reveals that the clinical safety profile of mRNA-1273.214 50 μg 
when administered as second booster dose is comparable to that of the currently approved monovalent 
booster vaccine mRNA-1273 50 μg (Wuhan-Hu-1). Slightly higher incidences of local and systemic 
adverse events were observed, when comparing mRNA-1273.214 50 μg administered as second booster 
Assessment report  
EMA/896245/2022 
Page 187/191 
 
 
 
 
to mRNA-1273 50 μg given as booster dose. All these adverse events fully resolved after several days. 
However, these minor differences are not clinically relevant and are not considered to have a significant 
impact on the safety profile of mRNA-1273.214 when compared to that of mRNA-1273.  
Data from the long-term (up to Day 181) safety follow up of a Beta-containing bivalent vaccine (mRNA-
1273.211) has also been evaluated as a supportive for mRNA-1273.214 bivalent vaccine safety. No new 
safety signals or concerns have been observed to date with this bivalent vaccine. 
Taken together, the indication for bivalent mRNA-1273.214 50 µg (Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron 
BA.1) as a 1st or 2nd booster dose after the primary vaccination series is deemed acceptable based on the 
totality of the serological evidence evaluating different vaccination regimens.  
Based on review of the immunogenicity and safety data of mRNA-1273.214, the benefit-risk profile of 
mRNA-1273.214 50 μg as regards the clinical aspects is considered favourable, independently of the 
information requested via recommendations. 
The MAH will continue to closely monitor and characterise the safety profile of modified vaccines in clinical 
studies and via post-authorisation pharmacovigilance activities. 
The MAH has provided a commitment to comply with a number of quality and clinical recommendations 
(see sections 4.3 and 7.3). 
The benefit-risk balance is considered positive in the applied indication.

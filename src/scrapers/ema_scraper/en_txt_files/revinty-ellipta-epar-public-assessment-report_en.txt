2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Asthma is a chronic pulmonary disease characterized by airway inflammation, bronchoconstriction and 
increased  airway  responsiveness  [Global  Initiative  in  Asthma  (GINA)  Guideline,  2011]  affecting  1%-
18%  of  the  population  across  different  countries.  The  mortality,  morbidity  and  costs  associated  with 
asthma  are  substantial.  Inhaled  corticosteroids  (ICS)  are  considered  the  most  effective  anti-
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/175905/2014 
Page 6/23 
 
  
  
inflammatory treatments for all severities of persistent asthma [GINA Guideline, 2011], resulting in a 
control  of  asthma  symptoms,  improvement  in  quality  of  life  and  lung  function  and  reduction  in  the 
frequency  and  severity  of  asthma  exacerbations.  Add-on  therapy  with  inhaled  LABA  is  preferred  to 
increasing the dose of ICS to achieve asthma control, and is associated with improvement in symptom 
scores,  decreases in  nocturnal  asthma  symptoms,  improvement in  lung  function  and  reduction of  the 
number  of  asthma  exacerbations.  Without  concomitant  ICS  inhaled  LABA  may  be  associated  with 
increased  risk  of  serious  asthma-related  events  (including  hospitalisation,  intubation  and  death),  and 
therefore inhaled LABA therapy should not be used as monotherapy in asthma [GINA Guideline, 2011]. 
Chronic  Obstructive  Pulmonary  Disease  (COPD)  is  a  common  disease  that  accounts  for  5%  of  deaths 
globally  [World  Health  Organisation  (WHO)  2012].  As  a  leading  cause  of  morbidity  and  mortality 
worldwide,  COPD  produces  a  substantial,  and  growing,  economic  and  social  burden  [GOLD,  2011]. 
COPD  is  characterised  by  persistent,  usually  progressive,  airflow  limitation  associated  with  an 
enhanced  inflammatory  response  in  the  airways  and  the  lungs.  Exacerbations  and  comorbidities 
contribute  to  the  overall  severity  [Global  Initiative  for  Obstructive  Lung  Disease  (GOLD),  2011].  An 
exacerbation  is  an  acute  event  characterised  by  a  worsening  of  the  symptoms  of  COPD  that  require 
treatment  with  oral  corticosteroids  and/or  antibiotics  (moderate  exacerbations)  or  that  require  an  in-
patient  hospitalization  (severe  exacerbations).  The  goals  of  pharmacologic  therapy  in  COPD  are  the 
reduction  in  symptoms  and  in  the  frequency  and  severity  of  exacerbations,  and  the  improvement  of 
health  status  and  exercise  tolerance  [GOLD,  2011].  Bronchodilators,  such  as  long-acting  beta2 
agonists (LABA), are key to improving lung function and managing symptoms in COPD. In patients not 
adequately controlled with a LABA, the addition of a ICS usually leads to reductions in the frequency of 
exacerbations,  improves  symptoms  and  quality  of  life  and  produces  small  improvements  in  lung 
function [GOLD, 2011].  
About the product 
Revinty Ellipta Ellipta 92 µg/22 µg & 184 µg/22 µg inhalation powder is a pre-dispensed multi dose dry 
powder  for  oral  inhalation.  The  active  ingredients  are  fluticasone  furoate  (FF)  and  Vilanterol  (VI)  (as 
trifenatate). FF is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with potent anti-inflammatory activity, while 
VI is a selective long-acting, beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA).  
The  novel  dry  powder  inhaler  (NDPI),  called  Ellipta,  incorporates  two  blister  strips,  one  containing  a 
blend  of  micronised  FF  and  lactose  monohydrate  and  the  other  containing  a  blend  of  micronised  VI, 
lactose monohydrate and magnesium stearate. Upon actuation, the inhaler delivers the contents of one 
blister containing FF blend and one blister containing VI blend.  
Revinty  Ellipta  is  a  novel  ICS/LABA  fixed  dose  combination  for  oral  inhalation  administered  from  a 
Novel  Dry  Powder  Inhaler  (NDPI).  It  contains  fluticasone  furoate  (FF;  GW685698X),  an  ICS,  and 
vilanterol  (VI;  vilanterol  trifenatate;  GW642444M),  an  inhaled  LABA.  Neither  FF  nor  VI  is  currently 
available as an individual component for oral inhalation However, FF is the active substance in Avamys, 
an intranasal corticosteroid authorised via the Centralised Procedure. 
The Applicant applied for the following two indications:  
Asthma 
Revinty Ellipta is indicated for the regular treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents aged 12 years 
and  older  where  use  of  a  combination  medicinal  product  (long-acting  beta2-agonist  and  inhaled 
corticosteroid) is appropriate: 
• 
patients  not  adequately  controlled  with  inhaled  corticosteroids  and  'as  needed'  inhaled  short 
acting beta2-agonists. 
COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/175905/2014 
Page 7/23 
 
  
  
Revinty  Ellipta  is  indicated  for  the  symptomatic  treatment  of  adults  with  COPD  with  a  FEV1<70% 
predicted  normal  (post-bronchodilator)  with  an  exacerbation  history  despite  regular  bronchodilator 
therapy.  
In asthma, the posology requested is one inhalation of Revinty Ellipta 92 μg/22 μg once daily (OD). If 
patients  are  inadequately  controlled  on  Revinty  Ellipta  92 mcg/22 μg  OD,  the  dose  of  Revinty  Ellipta 
184 μg/22 μg should be considered.  
In COPD, the posology requested is one inhalation of Revinty Ellipta 92 mcg/22 μg OD. Revinty Ellipta 
184 μg/22 mcg  is  not  recommended in  COPD,  due  to  lack  of  superior  efficacy  compared  to  the  lower 
dose, and increase in risk of pneumonia and other adverse events. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
Since  this  application  is  an  informed  consent  of  the  Relvar  Ellipta  application,  the  quality  data  in 
support  of  the  Revinty  Ellipta  application  are  identical  to  the  up-to-date  quality  data  of  the  Relvar 
Ellipta dossier, which has been assessed and approved. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
No  non-clinical  data  have  been  submitted  in  the  Revinty  Ellipta  dossier,  since  this  application  is  an 
informed consent of the Relvar Ellipta application: the non-clinical data in support of the Revinty Ellipta 
application  are  identical  to  the  up-to-date  non-clinical  data  of  the  Relvar  Ellipta  dossier,  which  have 
been assessed and approved. 
2.3.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An  environmental  Risk  Assessment(ERA)  has  been  provided,  which  is  identical  to  the  one  that  was 
submitted for Relvar Ellipta.  
The  ERA  was  prepared  in  compliance  with  the  Guideline  on  the  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  of 
Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00). The two active substances fluticasone 
furoate  and  vilanterol  have  been  assessed  separately.  Predicted  environmental  concentrations  were 
significantly below the threshold value of 0.01 μL, indicating that no a Phase II – Tier A is needed for 
both active substances. 
Fluticasone furoate (GW685698) 
A  Phase  I  environmental  risk  assessment  was  performed  to  evaluate  potential  environmental  risks  of 
fluticasone  furoate.  The  log  Kow  was  determined  according  to  study  OECD  117  with  a  value  of  2.61. 
Based on the log Kow value being below 3, fluticasone furoate is not expected to be a bio-accumulative 
substance.  The  environmental  exposure  assessment  was  estimated  according  to  the  formula  for  the 
calculation of the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC):

PECsurfacewater is 0.001 µg/L.  
The PECsurfacewater is below 0.01 μg/L, and thus a phase II assessment is not necessary.  
Fluticasone  furoate  is  a  glucocorticoid,  hence  it  should  be  considered  as  a  potential  endocrine 
disruptor.  Therefore  the  potential  endocrine  activity  of  this  compound  should  be  investigated.  In  the 
context of the obligation of the Applicant to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following point to be addressed: 
•  An OECD 210 modified extended early life-stage study in fish using fluticasone furoate should 
be conducted to complete the Environmental Risk Assessment. Once the results are available, 
the Environmental Risk Assessment should be updated accordingly. 
The  results  from  this  additional  study  were  not  considered  required  by  the  Committee  before  the 
adoption of the positive CHMP opinion and it is confirmed that these applications comply with Article 6 
of Regulation 726/2004 having regard to the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83.

2.7.  User consultation 
A  justification  for  not  performing  a  full  user  consultation  with  target  patient  groups  on  the  package 
leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The Applicant provided the report on the results from the user consultation done for Relvar Ellipta. The 
CHMP considered it acceptable to refer to the user consultation done for Relvar Ellipta as the package 
leaflet  is  identical  and  no  separate  user  testing  for  this  informed  consent  application  is  considered 
necessary.  
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
The  application  has  been  submitted  in  accordance  with  Article  10c  of  Directive  2001/83/EC  as 
amended (Informed consent Application) under automatic access to the centralised procedure. 
Revinty Ellipta is identical to Relvar Ellipta previously approved by the CHMP. The quality, non-clinical, 
efficacy  and  safety  data  for  Revinty  Ellipta  is  therefore  considered  satisfactorily  and  the  benefit-risk 
profile for Revinty Ellipta is positive.

Divergent Position 
The undersigned members of CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s opinion recommending the granting 
of a Marketing Authorisation for Revinty Ellipta for the following indications:  
Asthma Indication:  
Revinty Ellipta is indicated in the regular treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents aged 12 years 
and older, where use of a combination product (long-acting beta2-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid) is 
appropriate: 
• 
patients  not  adequately  controlled  with  inhaled  corticosteroids  and  “as  needed”  inhaled  short 
acting beta2-agonists. 
COPD Indication:  
Revinty  Ellipta  is  indicated  for  symptomatic  treatment  of  adults  with  COPD  with  a  FEV1  <70% 
predicted  normal  (post-bronchodilator)  with  an  exacerbation  history  despite  regular  bronchodilator 
therapy.  
The reasons for divergent opinion were as follows: 
In  asthma,  the  superiority  of  the  fixed  dose  combination  (FDC)  to  the  mono  components  on 
bronchodilatory  effect  and  symptomatic  improvement  has  not  been  sufficiently  demonstrated 
(Guideline  on  Fixed  Combination  Medicinal  Products  (CPMP/EWP/240/95  Rev.  1)).  None  of  the  mono 
components  have  been  previously  approved  for  the  treatment  of  asthma,  and  non-inferiority  of  the 
FDC  compared  with  established  LABA/ICS  FDC  therapies,  or  superiority  of  the  FDC  compared  with 
established LABA or ICS mono therapies in asthma has not been proven.  
Regarding the COPD indication, no clear symptomatic benefit of the FDC versus placebo was apparent 
on  dyspnoea  scores,  and  the  chosen  active  comparator  (VI)  for  the  exacerbation  studies  is  not 
considered optimal as it is not an authorised LABA for the treatment of patients with COPD. Therefore, 
the magnitude of the symptomatic effect (dyspnoea, exacerbations) of the FDC in COPD is uncertain. 
The issue is hampered by the lack of comparisons with established COPD therapies.  
In relation to safety issues, the risk of pneumonia seems to be a common and serious adverse event, 
with 6 fatal cases of pneumonia observed in the COPD studies, which are of special concern. This risk 
cannot be fully characterized due to methodological limitations of the clinical studies with regard to the 
assessment of pneumonia.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for trabectedin, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
As infusion site reactions and tissue necrosis are known events, the PRAC considered that it is 
important to highlight more clearly to health care professionals that the use of central venous 
access is strongly recommended, which is further explained in section 4.4 of the SmPC. Hence, the 
SmPC wording in section 4.2 should also include a reference to section 4.4 and not only to section 
6.6.  
Therefore, in view of available data regarding infusion site reactions and tissue necrosis the PRAC 
considered that changes to the product information were warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for trabectedin the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product containing trabectedin is favourable subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisations should be varied.

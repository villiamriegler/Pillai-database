the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
and PL 
Fampyra in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity. 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

the Enhance study (218MS305) conducted in 636 subjects 
SmPC sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, Annex II and Package 
Leaflet based on the clinical study ENHANCE and to 
the SmPC section 4.6 based on the data from the 
FOLLOW pregnancy registry. The RMP (version 11) 
has been updated accordingly. In addition, the 
Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the 
opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD 
template version 10.0. Finally, the CHMP 
recommends the granting of a marketing 
authorisation no longer subject to specific 
obligations. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
double-blind treatment was 24 weeks with a 2 week post–
treatment follow-up. The primary endpoint was 
improvement in walking ability, measured as the proportion 
of patients achieving a mean improvement of ≥ 8 points 
from baseline MSWS-12 score over 24 weeks.  In this study 
there was a statistically significant treatment difference, 
with a greater proportion of Fampyra treated patients 
demonstrating an improvement in walking ability, 
compared to placebo-controlled patients (relative risk of 
1.38 (95% CI:  [1.06, 1.70]).  Improvements generally 
appeared within 2 to 4 weeks of initiation of treatment, and 
disappeared within 2 weeks of treatment cessation. Based 
on the results of the study it was agreed that specific 
obligation has been fulfilled, and therefore it is deleted from 
the Annex II. 
Furthermore, the MAH submitted results of the pregnancy 
registry FOLLOW which was terminated early due to lack of

to add information regarding hypersensitivity 
reactions (including anaphylaxis) and the respective 
warnings and precautions relevant to the prescriber. 
The Package Leaflet was proposed to be updated in 
accordance. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update 
the list of local representatives in the Package 
Leaflet. 
Furthermore, the PI was brought in line with the 
latest QRD template version 9.0. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
in the post-marketing setting, including the cases of 
anaphylaxis, and was of the view that a causal relationship 
between fampridine administration and hypersensitivity 
(allergic reaction) cannot be excluded. Overall, the CHMP 
concluded that hypersensitivity should be added to section 
4.8 of the SmPC and the respective warnings and 
precautions relevant to the prescriber should be introduced 
in section 4.4. The following text was introduced to the 
Package Leaflet:  
“If you experience one or more of the following 
hypersensitivity symptoms: swollen face, mouth, lips, 
throat or tongue, reddening or itching of the skin, chest 
tightness and breathing problems stop taking Fampyra and 
see your doctor immediately”.

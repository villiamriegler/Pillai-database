2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Cutaneous melanoma is the most aggressive form of all skin cancers, with approximately 132,000 
new cases and approximately 37,000 disease-related deaths worldwide each year. Historically, the 
median survival time for subjects with stage IV melanoma was approximately 6 months with 26% 
of subjects alive at 1-year (1). The estimated 5-year survival rate was <10%, with median 
Progression Free Survival (PFS) of 1.7 months (2). 
For decades, cytotoxic chemo- and immunotherapy have been the mainstays of systemic therapy 
for unresectable melanoma. However, the response rate of chemotherapy is low (approximately 
10%), and only few melanoma patients achieve a more durable tumour control (3). For metastatic 
disease, dacarbazine (dimethyl triazene imidazole carboxamide or DTIC) was the first approved 
treatment for metastatic melanoma with observed responses ranging from 10 to 12%, median PFS 
of approximately 1.5 months, and median Overall Survival (OS) of 6.4 months (4). 
The therapeutic landscape for the treatment of metastatic melanoma has recently changed 
significantly with the regulatory approval of two new active agents, ipilimumab and vemurafenib. 
Ipilimumab was granted a marketing authorisation for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or 
metastatic) melanoma in adults who have received prior therapy as it improved median OS 
compared to gp10.  Vemurafenib was granted a marketing authorisation for the treatment of adult 
patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma based on the 
improved median OS and PFS compared to dacarbazine. 
About the product 
The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway is a critical proliferation pathway in many human cancers. This 
pathway can be constitutively activated by alterations in specific proteins, including BRAF, which 
phosphorylates MEK1 and MEK2 on two regulatory serine residues. BRAF mutations have been 
identified at a high frequency in specific cancers, including approximately 30 to 60% of melanoma  
(5,6). BRAF V600E mutation is the most common (~80 to 90%) (7) followed by V600K (~10 to 
20%). A number of rare substitutions also occur including V600D, V600G, V600M and V600R. 
Dabrafenib is an inhibitor of RAF kinases. Oncogenic mutations in BRAF lead to constitutive 
activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Dabrafenib inhibits BRAF kinases with activating 
codon 600 mutations. 
Dabrafenib showed suppression of a downstream pharmacodynamic biomarker (phosphorylated 
ERK) and inhibited cell growth of BRAF V600 mutant melanoma cell lines, in vitro and in animal 
models. In subjects with BRAF V600 mutation positive melanoma, administration of dabrafenib 
resulted in inhibition of tumour phosphorylated ERK relative to baseline. 
The Applicant applied for the indication: ‘‘Dabrafenib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients 
with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation’’. 
The CHMP adopted a positive opinion for the following indication: 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/242419/2013 
Page 8/95 
 
  
  
 
‘‘Dabrafenib is indicated in monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or 
metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation’’. 
Dabrafenib is administered orally and it is available as 50 mg and 75 mg capsules. The 
recommended dose of dabrafenib is 150 mg (two capsules of 75 mg) twice daily (corresponding to 
a total daily dose of 300 mg). Dabrafenib should be taken at least one hour before, or at least 2 
hours after a meal, and leaving an interval of approximately 12 hours between doses. Dabrafenib 
should be taken at similar times every day to increase patient compliance. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Tafinlar is presented as hypromellose capsules containing either 50 mg or 75 mg dabrafenib as 
active substance, which corresponds to 59.25 mg and 88.88 mg dabrafenib mesylate, respectively 
per capsule.  
Other ingredients are: microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate and colloidal silicon dioxide. 
The capsule shell consists of hypromellose, red iron oxide, titanium dioxide. The printing ink 
contains shellac, black iron oxide, n-butyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, propylene glycol and 
ammonium hydroxide. The list of excipients can be found in section 6.1. of the SmPC. 
The capsules of the two strengths can be distinguished by size, color and identifying codes. The 
product is packaged in HDPE bottles with PP closures and contains a silica desiccant.  
2.2.2.  Active  substance 
Dabrafenib mesylate is a white to slightly coloured powder, it is not hygroscopic and is practically 
insoluble in aqueous media at pH 4-8 and only very slightly soluble at pH 1. The active substance 
meets the criteria for Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) Class II (low solubility and high 
permeability). Dabrafenib mesylate converts to its free base in aqueous media. The chemical name 
of dabrafenib mesylate is: 
N-{3-[5-(2-Amino-4-pyrimidinyl)-2-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-1,3-thiazol-4-yl]-2-fluorophenyl}-2,6-dif
luorobenzene sulfonamide, methanesulfonate salt. It has the following structural formula: 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/242419/2013 
Page 9/95 
 
 
  
  
 
Dabrafenib mesylate has no chiral centers and hence exhibits no stereoisomerism. Polymorphism 
has been observed for dabrafenib mesylate and the crystalline form (Form 1) is used to 
manufacture the medicinal product in view of its solubility and stability. The ASMF procedure has 
not been used for this marketing authorisation application and there is no monograph for 
dabrafenib in the European Pharmacopoeia. 
Manufacture 
Dabrafenib mesylate is supplied by one manufacturer. The synthesis consists of four stages, three 
of which involve the breaking and/or formation of covalent bonds. The fourth stage is the salt 
formation, followed by a micronization step. Dabrafenib mesylate is micronized to achieve the 
desired particle size distribution. This is important for the bioavailability of the medicinal product. 
Sufficient information has been provided on the manufacturing process development. The critical 
steps have been identified and proven acceptable ranges have been established for the critical and 
non-critical process parameters in all four stages of the manufacturing process. A risk assessment 
(FMEA) has been performed to identify the critical process parameters and proven acceptable 
ranges (PARs) have been set The PARs were established at laboratory and pilot scale but this was 
considered acceptable for operation at commercial scale because the processes are scale 
independent.  
Adequate specifications and control methods for intermediates, starting materials and reagents 
have been presented and adequate in-process controls are in place. The proposed starting 
materials are well defined and have acceptable specifications. Batch analysis data have been 
provided for six production scale batches and demonstrate that the active ingredient can be 
manufactured reproducibly. 
Elucidation of the chemical structure of dabrafenib mesylate is supported by the synthetic route and 
has been verified through spectroscopic measurements and elemental analysis. The crystal and 
molecular structure of dabrafenib mesylate Form 1 has been determined by three-dimensional 
single crystal X-ray diffraction measurements. The formation of and potential carry-over of 
genotoxic compounds to the final drug substance have been adequately addressed. None of the 
genotoxic impurities will be carried over to the drug substance at levels exceeding the threshold of 
toxicological concern. 
Dabrafenib mesylate is packaged in LDPE bags. The specifications for the LDPE bags are appropriate 
for this active substance. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance, identity (IR), assay (HPLC, 98.0 
– 102.0%), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), residue on ignition, 
sulphated ash and particle size (laser diffraction). The analytical methods used have been 
adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/242419/2013 
Page 10/95 
 
  
  
 
Some of the tests are performed on the non-micronized substance, others on the micronized 
substance. It has been shown that micronization of the dabrafenib mesylate has no effect on the 
drug related impurities, so it is acceptable to perform the analysis on either non-micronized or 
micronized drug substance.  
The identity is determined by IR spectroscopy which has been shown specific and can discriminate 
between the dabrafenib free base, dabrafenib mesylate, dabrafenib mesylate hydrate, and other 
polymorphs of dabrafenib, at least for the pure substances. A justification has been provided for not 
including a test for heavy metals and for microbiological quality in the drug substance specification.  
Batch analysis data have been provided for six production-scale batches of dabrafenib mesylate, 
which were manufactured according to the proposed commercial route at the commercial site and 
tested by the proposed commercial methods. Three of the batches were micronized. The results are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. The proposed specifications for the 
drug substance are adequately justified and supported by batch analysis data and stability data. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/242419/2013 
Page 11/95 
 
  
  
 
Stability 
Stability studies have been initiated according to the ICH guidelines on three production scale 
batches of micronized dabrafenib mesylate manufactured according to the proposed commercial 
process and stored in a package representative of the commercial package. Six months of 
accelerated (40ºC/75%RH) and twelve months of long term (25ºC/60%RH) stability data have 
been provided. No significant change has been observed in any of the parameters studied, all 
results were within the proposed specifications. One of the primary batches has also been included 
in a photo-stability study according to ICH Q1B. Forced degradation studies have also been 
performed on dabrafenib mesylate in the solid state and in solution.   
The following parameters were tested: appearance, drug content, drug related impurities, water 
content and particle size. The analytical methods used were the same as for release or equivalent, 
and are stability indicating. 
The stability results indicate that the drug substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical development 
The aim of the development was to achieve an immediate release dosage form of dabrafenib for oral 
administration. Two strengths have been developed, containing 50 mg and 75 mg dabrafenib (as 
free base), respectively. The pharmaceutical development contains some QbD elements. The 
quality target product profile (QTPP) was defined as an immediate release dosage form, which can 
be swallowed easily, allows flexible dose adjustments for patients, that meets compendial and other 
relevant quality standards, and is packaged protected from moisture. 
The critical quality attributes (CQA) of the product which may have impact on the efficacy and 
safety of the drug product have been defined as description, identification and content of active 
substance, drug related impurities, uniformity of dosage units, dissolution, particle size, capsule 
description and capsule moisture. The particle size of the drug substance is a CQA because of its 
potential impact on bioavailability. A test for the particle size is included in the drug substance 
specifications.  
In early clinical development, low doses (1 mg, 5 mg) of dabrafenib capsules were used and hence 
the particle size of the drug substance was considered to be critical with regard to content 
uniformity, and therefore the dabrafenib mesylate was micronized. Later, when higher doses (50 
mg and 75 mg) were developed, micronization was maintained because there were then no 
pharmacokinetic data which supported the use of non-micronized substance. Initially, hard gelatine 
capsules were used for the formulation but due to a decreasing dissolution rate during stability, it 
was decided to develop Tafinlar in hypromellose capsules with lower moisture content. 
Hypromellose capsules with a composition identical to the one proposed for marketing have been 
used for the Phase 3 clinical studies.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/242419/2013 
Page 12/95 
 
  
  
 
The manufacturing process development has been described in sufficient detail. The objective was 
to formulate a simple blend that would be suitable for capsule filling using either gravity fed manual 
filling or a dosator type encapsulation machine. The applicant has applied relationship matrices, 
Input Process Output (IPO) diagrams and Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) to establish the 
process parameters and attributes that have the greatest impact on drug product quality and to 
develop an adequate control strategy. Critical process parameters and CQAs have been adequately 
identified. 
Standard excipients have been selected for the capsule formulation: microcrystalline cellulose 
(diluent), magnesium stearate (lubricant) and colloidal silicon dioxide (glidant). The capsule shell 
consists of hypromellose (capsule matrix), red iron oxide (colourant), titanium dioxide (opacifier) 
and printing ink. The printing ink contains shellac, black iron oxide, n-butyl alcohol, isopropyl 
alcohol, propylene glycol and ammonium hydroxide. Tafinlar does not contain excipients which 
require a special warning in section 2 of the SmPC.  
The capsules are packaged in white HDPE bottles with plastic closures. A desiccant canister is 
included in the bottles. The HDPE bottle complies with the Ph.Eur. (for polyolefins) and the plastic 
packaging material complies with the Commission Regulation (EU) No. 10/2011 for plastic 
materials intended to come into contact with food. The container closure system is adequate to 
support the stability and use of the product. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. Shellac, used in the printing ink 
on the capsules, is derived from insects which are not covered by BSE/TSE regulations. Magnesium 
stearate is of vegetable origin.  
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process of Tafinlar is considered to be a standard process. The main steps 
include: i) powder blending, ii) low shear lubrication and iii) capsule filling. The encapsulation has 
been identified as a critical step. A detailed description of the manufacturing process has been 
provided and adequate in-process controls are in place. The in-process controls include a test for 
the mean capsule fill weight, individual capsule fill weight, length of closed capsule, and capsule 
appearance. No intermediates are involved in the manufacturing process. The manufacturing 
process has been validated on 10 and 19 commercial scale batches of 50 mg and 75 mg capsules, 
respectively, according to the proposed commercial manufacturing process. The results 
demonstrate that the process is capable to reproducibly produce the finished product of the 
intended quality.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/242419/2013 
Page 13/95 
 
  
  
 
Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications include appropriate tests for appearance, 
identity (HPLC, UV), assay (95.0% - 105.0% of label claim by HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (by 
weight variation, Ph.Eur.), impurities (HPLC), dissolution (UV) and microbial limits. The tests for 
impurities and microbial limits are performed at shelf-life only. 
No test for water content is proposed and this is considered acceptable since moisture is controlled 
by the capsule shells and the product is packaged with a desiccant canister. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of 3 production scale batches have been presented for each strength. Up to 12 months 
stability data produced under long term conditions (25ºC/60%RH) and up to 6 months data under 
accelerated conditions (40ºC/75%RH) have been provided, according to the ICH guideline. The 
batches were packaged in the commercial package with desiccant and were manufactured by the 
commercial process. 
The following parameters were tested in the stability studies: appearance, dabrafenib content, drug 
related impurities, dissolution, water content and microbiological quality. The same methods as 
used for release testing are used for stability testing.  
Photo-stability stress testing was performed for one batch of each strength, in line with the ICH Q1B 
guideline. No significant change in the parameters studied was observed after light exposure of the 
dabrafenib capsules. 
Furthermore, the 50 mg and 75 mg capsules have also been subjected to some forced degradation 
in order to identify potential degradation products. The stressed conditions are: heat, heat and 
humidity, UV exposure and fluorescent light exposure. The capsules were analysed for related 
substances by HPLC after the forced degradation treatment and the analytical method 
demonstrated to be stability indicating.  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life and as stated in the SmPC are acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product 
has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency 
and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion 
that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were no unresolved quality issues having an impact on the

2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro studies – potency, mechanism of action and selectivity 
The in vitro activity of dabrafenib was evaluated utilizing a baculovirus or transient mammalian 
expression system to produce wildtype (WT) human BRAF and CRAF, as well as BRAFV600E, 
BRAFV600K and BRAFV600D mutant full length active enzymes or truncated constitutively active 
human CRAF. Dabrafenib inhibited human wildtype BRAF and CRAF enzymes with IC50 values of 
3.2 and 5.0 nM, respectively, as well as the mutant forms BRAFV600E, BRAFV600K and BRAFV600D, 
having IC50 values of 0.65, 0.5 and 1.84 nM, respectively.

The IC50 values for dabrafenib for WT BRAF orthologues from human, monkey, dog and rat were 
4.8, 4.1, 4.3 and 4.0 nM, respectively, demonstrating similar activity against nonclinical species 
and supported the use of rats and dogs as the species for toxicology studies.  Other analyses 
showed that dabrafenib is a time-dependent, reversible inhibitor of WT BRAF and BRAFV600E 
enzymes, and is an ATP competitive inhibitor of WT BRAF and CRAF and BRAFV600E.  Three active 
dabrafenib metabolites have been identified, with two metabolites (desmethyl-dabrafenib and 
hydroxy-dabrafenib) demonstrating potent inhibition of WT BRAF and CRAF and mutant BRAF 
kinases, and one metabolite (carboxy-dabrafenib) showing reduced activity against these enzymes 
(13- to 47-fold).  The dabrafenib metabolites also showed similar activities against rat, dog and 
monkey WT BRAF compared to their respective values on the human orthologue (Table 1).

Treatment of ES-2 ovarian carcinoma cells, containing BRAFV600E mutant, with dabrafenib for 1 hour 
resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease in pERK and pMEK, with no change in total ERK and 
MEK protein levels (data not shown). Treatment of various BRAFV600E cell lines with dabrafenib 
resulted in potent inhibition of pERK, including the melanoma cell lines A375PF11s and SK-MEL-28, 
but not in cell lines containing WT BRAF or mutated RAS proteins, using in-cell Western, Western 
blot assays or ELISA assays (data not shown). 
The IC50 values for inhibition of ERK phosphorylation and inhibition of cell proliferation in SK-MEL-28 
melanoma cells by dabrafenib were comparable (Tables 2 and 3). The 3 metabolites 
(hydroxy-dabrafenib (M7), desmethyl-dabrafenib (M8), and carboxy-dabrafenib (M4)   were also 
examined.  Whereas hydroxy-dabrafenib and desmethyl-dabrafenib had similar potency as 
dabrafenib, carboxy-dabrafenib was 17-fold less potent in inhibition of ERK phosphorylation, and 
37-fold less potent in inhibition of cell proliferation (Table 2).  
Table 02 Cellular pERK Inhibition by Dabrafenib and Metabolites 
Table 03 Antiproliferative Activity of Dabrafenib and Metabolites is Specific to Activated BRAF 
Mutant Cell Lines 
In HCT116, a human colon carcinoma cell line containing mutated RAS, dabrafenib and 
hydroxy-dabrafenib did not show anti-proliferative activity, and dabrafenib and its 3 metabolites  
were also unable to inhibit HN5 tumour cells (head and neck squamous carcinoma)  with WT BRAF 
and RAS. 
The duration and reversibility of pERK inhibition in SK-MEL-28 cells were investigated after 
compound removal following treatment with dabrafenib (300 nM, 33-fold the pERK IC50) for 2 hours.  
The inhibition of pERK formation persisted for 4 hours with complete recovery by 6 hours 
post-compound removal. 
The ability of dabrafenib to inhibit proliferation of >110 human tumour cell lines, each with 
confirmed BRAF mutational status, was evaluated in a 3 day growth assay.  Sensitivity to 
dabrafenib significantly correlated with the presence of BRAFV600E with 16 out of 18 cell lines with 
IC50s <100 nM containing BRAFV600E .  Furthermore, dabrafenib inhibited proliferation of 73% of the 
BRAFV600E containing cell lines, but generally showed little to no activity against all other cancer cell 
lines tested.  Thirteen out of 15 BRAFV600E, 4 out of 5 BRAFV600K and 1 out of 1 BRAFV600D melanoma 
cell lines were sensitive to cell growth inhibition by dabrafenib (IC50 <1 µM) (data not shown).

Yancovitz et al. reported that in any given tumour, the relative frequency of the BRAF V600E 
mutation ranged from 0% (indicating wildtype) to 48.3% for one patient tumour, whereas in 
another case the range was 4.9%-81.2%. 
The reversibility of cell growth arrest was shown in SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells following treatment 
with dabrafenib and removal of the compound allowing regrowth after re-plating.  The cells showed 
noticeable regrowth after 3 and 4 days, indicating that sustained compound presence might be 
required for prolonged tumour growth inhibition. 
In SK-MEL-28 and A375PF11s human melanoma cell lines containing the BRAFV600E mutation, 
dabrafenib treatment was able to induce a concentration-dependent G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and 
some apoptosis.  In contrast, HN5, a head and neck squamous carcinoma cell line containing 
wildtype BRAF and RAS, as well as normal human fibroblast cells, were not susceptible to either 
significant G0/G1 arrest or the induction of apoptosis, reflecting the previously observed lack of 
sensitivity of these cells to dabrafenib in the cell growth assays. In conclusion, dabrafenib potently 
decreased pERK through inhibition of BRAF mutant kinases and was a selective inhibitor of BRAF 
mutant cancer cell proliferation. 
In additional studies mechanisms involved in development of resistance and combinations to treat 
and delay the emergence of resistance were investigated. The BRAFV600E melanoma cell line 
A375PF11s or the BRAFV600K melanoma cell line YUSIT-1 were exposed to increasing concentrations 
of dabrafenib and a drug-resistant population was selected.  Clones were isolated that were 35-fold 
less sensitive or insensitive to cell growth inhibition by dabrafenib.  Genetic characterization of the 
resistant clones identified an in-frame deletion in MEK1 (MEK1K59del) or NRAS mutation (NRASQ61K 
and/or NRASA146T) with and without MEK1P387S in the BRAFV600E background and NRASQ61K in the 
BRAFV600K background.  In the resistant clones dabrafenib reduced phosphorylation of MEK; 
however, it did not decrease phosphorylation of either ERK or S6P, or the levels of cyclin D1 protein.  
Combined inhibition of both BRAF and MEK kinases with dabrafenib and trametinib (a MEK inhibitor) 
effectively suppressed signalling and gene expression related to an activated RAF-MEK-ERK 
pathway, thereby reducing cell proliferation in a similar manner as observed in dabrafenib-treated 
parental cells. Further studies showed that cell lines containing mutant BRAF and that were PTEN 
null were less efficiently growth inhibited by dabrafenib than cell lines that were PTEN WT. PTEN null 
cell lines had higher basal phosphorylation of Akt than cells that were PTEN WT, and treatment with 
dabrafenib increased Akt phosphorylation in PTEN null cell lines. In PTEN null cell lines, the 
combination of dabrafenib and a PI3K/mTor inhibitor was more effective than the combination of 
dabrafenib and the MEK inhibitor.   
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
A study was conducted to investigate potential off-target activity of dabrafenib against a broad 
panel of proteins. In this study, dabrafenib (concentrations up to 5 µM) was tested in vitro against 
a variety of proteins which include fourteen 7-transmembrane receptors, two enzymes, seven ion 
channels, four kinases and three transporter molecules.  Dabrafenib had no inhibiting or activating 
effect on the majority of proteins tested in these assays (XC50 >5 µM).  Dabrafenib showed 
moderate potency (0.3-3.2 μM) against the α2C-adrenergic receptor (EC50 >0.3 µM) and inhibition 
of LCK (IC50 >0.6 µM), GSK3β (IC50 >0.8 µM) and Aurora B kinases (IC50 >3.2 µM).  All activities 
against these proteins were at least 100-fold less potent than against BRAF enzymes.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted with different forms of dabrafenib. Micronized 
dabrafenib mesylate is the form intended for human use. However, the majority of nonclinical 
studies were conducted with the micronized dabrafenib free base, as a stable suspension 
formulation of the mesylate salt was not available.  
Absorption and systemic bioavailability was studied in male rats, mice, dogs, and monkeys.  
Dabrafenib had moderate blood clearance in the mouse (43.5 % of liver blood flow), rat (32 % of 
liver blood flow) and monkey (50 % of liver blood flow) and low blood clearance in the dog (12 % 
of liver blood flow). Steady state volume of distribution was low to moderate in all species (0.6-1.4 
times total body water). Bioavailability ranged from 46 % in monkeys to 70% in mice, 77% in rats, 
and 82% in dogs following low oral doses. Terminal half-life was 0.3h in mouse and monkeys, 0.7h 
in rats and 2.8h in dogs. 
In rats administered 5 or 10 mg/kg dabrafenib (micronized anhydrate/Form 2) as a single oral dose, 
showed that systemic exposure (plasma AUC and Cmax) was unchanged following a 2-fold increase 
in dose. Following administration of micronized dabrafenib mesylate in 0.5% HPMC (stable 
suspension formulation) at 20 mg/kg, for a 2-fold increase in dose there was a >4-fold and >10-fold 
increase in AUC and Cmax, respectively, as compared to the 10 mg/kg dose of dabrafenib 
administered as a suspension. 
In bile duct cannulated (BDC) rats, oral absorption of 14C-dabrafenib was 35.7% based on the total 
radioactivity eliminated in urine and bile.  
In an oral dose range toxicity study, male and female rats (3/sex/group) received oral doses of 
dabrafenib mesylate at 20, 200, 400 or 600 mg/kg. Plasma samples were collected for the first 24 
hours after dosing, and showed less than proportional increase in mean dabrafenib exposure.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/242419/2013 
Page 21/95 
 
 
  
  
 
In dogs, micronized dabrafenib (Form 2) was administered in oral suspension at a dose level of 5 
mg/kg or 10 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg in gelatine capsules, and dabrafenib mesylate was administered at 
a dose of 10 mg/kg in gelatine capsules or in suspension.  Exposure levels were higher when the 
mesylate form was administered, and the suspension resulted in higher exposure than capsules. 
In mice, the plasma toxicokinetics of dabrafenib, hydroxy-dabrafenib, carboxy-dabrafenib and 
desmethyl-dabrafenib were determined following oral repeat dosing of dabrafenib at 100, 300 and 
1000 mg/kg/day for 14 days. Systemic exposure (AUC and Cmax) to dabrafenib was similar in 
males and females at each dose and increased less than dose-proportionally. Systemic exposure to 
hydroxy-dabrafenib was approximately equal to dabrafenib in the females and ~0.5X in males, 
while systemic exposure to carboxy-dabrafenib and desmethyl-dabrafenib was notably greater 
than dabrafenib at each dose. 
For evaluation of potential penetration of circulating metabolites into select tissues (i.e., brain, 
liver, kidney and xenograft tumor), a pharmacokinetic/tissue distribution (PK/TD) study was 
conducted as part of a repeat dose pharmacodynamic (PD) study in the mouse.  In mice bearing 
A375pF11s xenograft tumors, exposure (AUC0-t) to hydroxy-dabrafenib was lower than dabrafenib 
in all tissue homogenates tested, except for liver in which hydroxy-dabrafenib exposure was 
approximately 2-fold higher than dabrafenib.  Matrix –assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) 
imaging mass spectrometry (IMS)  of 2 hour mouse livers revealed that dabrafenib and 
hydroxy-dabrafenib were distributed throughout the liver, while carboxy-dabrafenib and 
desmethyl-dabrafenib were confined to the bile duct regions.  MALDI-IMS analysis of 2 hour kidney 
tissue illustrated that carboxy-dabrafenib was localized to the medulla, while desmethyl-dabrafenib 
was predominantly in the cortex, possibly a reflection of the differences in polarity between 
carboxy-dabrafenib (hydrophilic) and desmethyl-dabrafenib (lipophilic). The levels of dabrafenib, 
carboxy-dabrafenib and hydroxy-dabrafenib in xenograft tumor homogenate were consistently 
lower than those in plasma, whereas levels of desmethyl-dabrafenib were higher in xenograft tumor 
than in plasma, although its formation upon sample processing could not be ruled out. Dabrafenib, 
hydroxy-dabrafenib, carboxy-dabrafenib and desmethyl-dabrafenib were detected in plasma, but 
only dabrafenib, carboxy-dabrafenib and desmethyl-dabrafenib were detected in brain tissue 
homogenate (including CSF).  The brain/plasma AUC0-t ratios for dabrafenib, carboxy-dabrafenib 
and desmethyl-dabrafenib were 0.02, 0.009 and 0.3, respectively, based on total concentrations or 
4.25, 0.14 and 36 after correcting for protein binding, suggesting that after repeat dosing, 
desmethyl-dabrafenib and to a lesser extent dabrafenib may penetrate intact brain tissue.  This is 
consistent with the positive PD activity observed in the mouse brain tissue as assessed by changes 
in pERK/tERK levels following repeat dosing. 
In a single dose quantitative whole body autoradiography (QWBA) study in partially pigmented rats, 
14C-dabrafenib-associated radioactivity was widely distributed into tissues, and most tissue 
concentrations were lower than those observed in blood.  In blood and most tissues, the highest 
concentration of radioactivity was observed at 4 hours post dose.  Radioactivity in the brain was 
below the limit of quantification (BLQ) at all time points, and there was no selective association of 
radioactivity with melanin containing tissues.  By 3 days post dose the radioactivity in most tissues 
was BLQ, with the exception of the adrenal cortex, kidney and liver which were all BLQ at 35 days.

In a positron emission tomography study in the pig, after a single dose of 18F-dabrafenib, consistent 
with the results in the rat, there was no evidence for brain penetration of drug-related material 
(DRM), including the circulating metabolites (hydroxy-dabrafenib and carboxy-dabrafenib) which 
were detected in this study. 
In vitro, dabrafenib was highly bound to plasma proteins (≥98.4%) in mouse, rat, dog, monkey and 
human, and had minimal association with blood cells (blood to plasma concentration ratios ranged 
from 0.49 to 0.63).  A similar blood:plasma ratio was found in vivo in.  Dabrafenib was stable in the 
blood after a 2 hour incubation at 37°C. Hydroxy-dabrafenib, carboxy-dabrafenib and 
desmethyl-dabrafenib were all highly bound to plasma proteins (≥94.9%, ≥93.3% and ≥99.2%, 
respectively) in all species tested and  had minimal association with blood cells (blood to plasma 
concentration ratios ranged from 0.45 to 0.71).  In human plasma, dabrafenib, 
hydroxy-dabrafenib, carboxy-dabrafenib and desmethyl-dabrafenib were 99.7, 96.3, 99.5 and 
99.9% bound to plasma proteins, respectively.  The blood to plasma concentration ratio for 
dabrafenib in human was 0.54. 
In vitro, dabrafenib, hydroxy-dabrafenib and desmethyl-dabrafenib were substrates of human 
P-glycoprotein (Pgp) while carboxy-dabrafenib was not.  Dabrafenib (only compound tested) was a 
substrate of murine breast cancer resistance protein 1 (Bcrp1) in vitro and showed high intrinsic 
apparent permeability (415 nm/sec in Bcrp-MDCK cells).  
The in vitro permeability of dabrafenib at pH 7.4 and 5.5 exceeded that of the high permeability 
reference marker labetalol.  Therefore, dabrafenib is classified as a highly permeable compound, 
according to the Biopharmaceutics Classification System. 
The metabolism of 20 µM [14C]-dabrafenib was investigated in studies in vitro using hepatocytes 
from male mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys, female rabbits, and male and female humans.  While 
most metabolites observed in human hepatocytes were also observed in at least one preclinical 
species, four conjugated metabolites were not. There were also some minor differences between 
hepatocytes from different human beings with respect to these conjugated metabolites. With the 
exception of desmethyl-dabrafenib, which was not detected in dog hepatocytes, the main 
metabolites hydroxy-dabrafenib, carboxy-dabrafenib and desmethyl-dabrafenib were detected in 
all species. Direct glucuronidation of dabrafenib was observed in rat, dog and rabbit. Many 
preclinical species also exhibited unique metabolites not observed in hepatocytes from any other 
species. Monkey hepatocytes contained six, and dog produced two unique products of oxidation or 
oxidation/glucuronidation. Rabbit hepatocytes contained two unique metabolites (products of 
oxidation and oxidation with sulfation), while rat exhibited a product of oxidation, defluorination, 
and glutathione conjugation not observed in any other species.  
In vitro studies using cDNA expressed enzymes and human liver microsomes with specific CYP 
inhibitors showed that dabrafenib was metabolized to hydroxy-dabrafenib mainly by CYP2C8 and 
CYP3A4, while hydroxy- and desmethyl-dabrafenib were further oxidized mainly by CYP3A4.

In vivo, single oral dose metabolism studies were conducted using [14C] dabrafenib in female nude 
mice (30 mg/kg), intact male and female rats and male bile duct cannulated rats (10 mg/kg), and 
male and female dogs (10 mg/kg).  The metabolic profiles obtained for dabrafenib in circulation 
were qualitatively similar in all species studied, in that the majority of the drug-related material was 
present as dabrafenib and 3 pharmacologically active metabolites, hydroxy dabrafenib, 
carboxy-dabrafenib and desmethyl-dabrafenib. At 2 hours following a single dose of 
[14C]-dabrafenib, carboxy-dabrafenib was the major component in mouse plasma. This 
represented more than 50 % of plasma radioactivity from 2 hours post-dose, with Cmax of 4.5 µg/ml 
and AUC of 34 µg.h/ml. Hydroxy-dabrafenib, desmethyl-dabrafenib, and dabrafenib were detected 
through 12 hours post-dose.  
In rats, hydroxy-dabrafenib was the predominant radiolabelled component in plasma, accounting 
for 50-80 % of plasma radioactivity at all time points studied. In addition, dabrafenib and 
carboxy-dabrafenib were present, while desmethyl-dabrafenib was a minor plasma component 
(<5% of plasma radioactivity). Rat liver extracts showed similar profiles to those in plasma, except 
that desmethyl-dabrafenib was not observed in liver.  
In dogs, the predominant radiolabelled component in plasma was dabrafenib, while 
hydroxy-dabrafenib was a notable component (>10 %). Carboxy-dabrafenib and 
desmethyl-dabrafenib were minor components of dog plasma only observed at later time points. 
Following a single dose of [14C]-dabrafenib in humans, dabrafenib was the major component in 
human plasma at 2 hours, and by 10 hours post dose carboxy-dabrafenib was the major 
drug-related component in human plasma. 
The excretion balance of 14C-dabrafenib was investigated in rats and dogs. In intact rats, fecal 
excretion was the major route of elimination, accounting for means of 92.9% and 90.2% of the 
administered dose in males and females, respectively; mean urinary elimination accounted for 
<3.1% of the dose. Fecal excretion was the predominant route of elimination of 
14C-dabrafenib-related material in dogs, accounting for mean recoveries of 101% and 103% of the 
dose in males and females, respectively; urinary excretion accounted for means of <1% of the dose 
in both genders.

Repeat dose toxicity 
The toxicity of repeated oral gavage doses of dabrafenib has been assessed in rats (at doses up to 
200 mg/kg/day for up to 13 weeks), dogs (doses up to 50 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks; doses up to 20 
mg/kg/day for 13 weeks) and in mice (doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks). Results of 
single-dose toxicity studies are summarised in table 6.

Genotoxicity 
Dabrafenib has been evaluated for genotoxic potential in vitro and in vivo. The mutagenic potential 
of dabrafenib has been assessed in the standard Ames test and in mammalian cells in the mouse 
lymphoma assay. The in vivo clastogenic potential of orally administered dabrafenib has been 
assessed in rats using the micronucleus test. In all studies, dabrafenib was not mutagenic in either 
in vitro or in vivo test systems (data not shown). 
Carcinogenicity 
No studies were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Reproduction Toxicity 
An overview of the reproductive and developmental toxicity studies is presented in Table 7. The 
pivotal juvenile toxicity study which was ongoing at the time of submission, was performed as part 
of the Paediatric Investigation Plan agreed upon by the EMA in January 2012.

Local Tolerance  
The intended route of dabrafenib administration in patients with unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation is oral. Local tolerance studies have been performed with 
dabrafenib drug substance for worker health and safety purposes only (data not shown).  
Other toxicity studies 
Phototoxicity 
In a neutral red uptake phototoxicity test, Balb/c 3T3 mouse fibroblasts cells treated with 
dabrafenib mesylate (micronized, 0.316 to 316 μg/mL) both in the presence and absence of UV-A 
light resulted in a decrease in cell survival. Cytotoxicity was observed at the highest three 
concentrations analyzed in the absence of UV-A (31.6 to 316 μg/mL) and all concentrations 
analyzed in the presence of UV-A (0.316 to 316 μg/mL). The IC50 value of dabrafenib in the 
absence of UV-A was 26.076 μg/mL. However, in the presence of UV-A, the IC50 value of 
dabrafenib could not be reliably calculated and is thus <0.316 μg/mL (the lowest concentration 
evaluated in the assay). The PIF (photo irritation factor) value was >83, indicating the test article 
was phototoxic.

In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for further investigation to be addressed: 
The MAH should perform an OECD 106 adsorption study for soils for dabrafenib and submit the 
results of this study with accompanying reports and a revised environmental risk assessment (with 
recalculated PEC for sediment and the RQ).

Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Dabrafenib is a selective inhibitor of human RAF kinases with activity against WT CRAF, BRAF and 
BRAFV600E/D/K.  Dabrafenib showed similar activity with BRAF from human, rat, dog and 
cynomolgus monkey. Oral doses of dabrafenib produced significant tumour growth inhibition in 
mice bearing BRAFV600E mutant human tumour xenografts.   
In biochemical assays, dabrafenib showed a higher affinity for the mutated BRAF variants (V600E, 
V600D, V600K) as compared to wildtype BRAF. However, the difference is relatively small 
(<8-fold). The activity against tumours with mutated BRAF is not due to this slightly higher activity 
but due to the fact that the mutations lead to constitutive activation of the enzyme and the tumour 
growth will be highly dependent on this activity. In tumours with wildtype BRAF, the enzyme does 
not play such essential role. It was also clear from the presented data that tumour cells with 
mutated BRAF may become resistant to dabrafenib due to the presence of mutations in other 
kinases such as MEK1 and MEK2. 
The most common activating mutation in BRAF is the V600E (valine to glutamic acid) which has 
been clearly shown to be associated with sensitivity to dabrafenib. Other activating mutations, 
which occur less common, are the V600K and V600D. The applicant presented data on several cell 
lines carrying the V600K which are sensitive to dabrafenib, but only one cell line with V600D 
(WM115) was also sensitive to dabrafenib. From a pharmacological viewpoint it could be considered 
that tumours with V600E, V600K and V600D are equally sensitive to dabrafenib due to the similar 
enzyme inhibition and the fact that all mutations are associated with constitutive activation of BRAF.  
There were no dabrafenib-related acute neurobehavioral or respiratory effects in rats given single 
oral doses up to 200 mg/kg/day. Cardiovascular effects were observed in two species (increased 
heart rate in rat and dog and decrease in PR interval duration in dog). These findings should be 
taken into consideration when discussing the overall cardiovascular safey of the product (see 
Toxicology section). Inibition of hERG was observed at high concentrations with large multiples to 
clinical exposure and there were no arrhythmic effects in the dog. No toxicokinetics was performed 
in the dog cardiovascular study. Estimation of exposure in the dog cardiovascular safety study was 
done from toxicokinetics data in a 4 week study. These data show that exposures up to 5x clinical 
exposure were achieved in absence of ECG abnormalities 
Regarding pharmacokinetics the applicant has presented appropriate data on absorption in animal 
species. Bioavailabiliy was high in all species. In vitro, dabrafenib and its metabolites hydroxy-, 
carboxy- and desmethyl-dabrafenib were highly bound to plasma proteins in nonclinical species and 
humans. The main human metabolites, hydroxy-dabrafenib, carboxy-dabrafenib and 
desmethyl-dabrafenib, are found in nonclinical species, however with quantitative differences. 
Exposure margins in repeat dose toxicity studies were determined and are discussed further below. 
Excretion in urine is clearly higher in humans (23%) than in toxicology species (≤ 3.1%). The main 
metabolite in urine is carboxy-dabrafenib which shows some pharmacological activity. There is a 
theoretical possibility for toxicity to the kidney and the urinary tract due to the urinary excretion, 
which was observed in the toxicology studies (see discussion below).  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/242419/2013 
Page 34/95 
 
  
  
 
Cardiovascular pathology has been observed on toxicology studies ranging from 7 days to 13 weeks 
duration in rats and dogs over a broad range of exposures. The same structural findings were not 
observed in subsequent studies of longer duration, but cardiovascular pathology was consistently 
observed. In dogs, the findings were principally characterized by coronary arterial 
degeneration/necrosis and/or haemorrhage, cardiac atrioventricular valve 
hypertrophy/haemorrhage and atrial fibrovascular proliferation (≥ 2 times clinical exposure based 
on AUC). In rats, an increased incidence of hepatic arterial degeneration and spontaneous 
cardiomyocyte degeneration with inflammation (spontaneous cardiomyopathy) were observed 
(≥ 0.5 times clinical exposure). Bronchoalveolar inflammation of the lungs was observed in several 
dogs at ≥ 20 mg/kg/day (≥ 9 times human clinical exposure based on AUC) and was associated 
with shallow and/or laboured breathing. 
In repeat dose studies, mild to marked reversible decreases in reticulocyte counts and decreased 
red cell mass was noted in dogs. In rats, decreased red cell mass were observed in female rats 
without corresponding microscopic findings in the bone marrow. Minimal to marked lymphoid 
depletion with reduced thymus weights were observed in dogs. 
Carcinogenicity studies with dabrafenib have not been conducted and are not considered necessary 
to support the use of dabrafenib for the current indication (BRAF V600 mutant positive advanced or 
metastatic melanoma) with short life expectancy. Dabrafenib was not mutagenic or clastogenic 
using in vitro tests in bacteria and cultured mammalian cells, and an in vivo rodent micronucleus 
assay. 
In combined female fertility, early embryonic and embryofetal development studies in rats numbers 
of ovarian corpora lutea were reduced in pregnant females at 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 
3 times human clinical exposure based on AUC), but there were no effects on estrous cycle, mating 
or fertility indices. Developmental toxicity including embryo-lethality and ventricular septal defects 
were seen at 300 mg/kg/day, and delayed skeletal development and reduced fetal body weight at 
≥ 20 mg/kg/day (≥ 0.5 times human clinical exposure based on AUC). Male fertility studies with 
dabrafenib have not been conducted. However, in repeat dose studies, testicular 
degeneration/depletion was seen in rats and dogs (≥ 0.2 times the human clinical exposure based 
on AUC). Testicular changes in rat and dog were still present following a 4-week recovery period. 
Dabrafenib should not be administered to pregnant women unless the potential benefit to the 
mother outweighs the possible risk to the foetus. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking 
dabrafenib, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the foetus. 
In a juvenile toxicity study in rats, effects on growth, renal toxicity, testicular toxicity and earlier 
vaginal opening were observed. Juvenile rats showed higher levels of carboxy-dabrafenib. These 
data are compatible with the possibility that renal clearance of this metabolite is associated with 
renal toxicity, and that this potential toxicity would not be readily detected in adult animals. Renal 
toxicity has been observed clinically and the SmPC includes information on it. No further nonclinical 
investigations are warranted to study the potential renal toxicity of carboxy- dabrafenib. 
Dabrafenib was phototoxic in an in vitro mouse fibroblast 3T3 Neutral Red Uptake (NRU) assay. The 
nonclinical photoxicity findings are mentioned in the SmPC.

Dabrafenib is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. However the CHMP concluded that the 
MAH should perform an OECD 106 adsorption study for soils for dabrafenib and submit the results 
of this study with accompanying reports and a revised environmental risk assessment (with 
recalculated PEC for sediment and the RQ). 
2.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical studies submitted for the marketing authorisation application for dabrafenib were 
considered adequate and acceptable for the assessment of non-clinical aspects for the product 
dabrafenib.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The Applicant applied for the indication ‘‘Dabrafenib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients 
with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation’’. 
The recommended dose of dabrafenib is 150 mg (two 75 mg capsules) twice daily (corresponding to 
a total daily dose of 300 mg). Dabrafenib should be taken at least one hour before, or at least 2 
hours after a meal, leaving an interval of approximately 12 hours between doses. Dabrafenib should 
be taken at similar times every day to increase patient compliance. 
The Applicant received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on clinical efficacy and safety related to the 
pivotal study BREAK-3. In the Scientific Advice procedure the CHMP concurred that the proposed 
study design, target population, primary endpoint and the safety database would be adequate to 
support a Marketing Authorisation Application.  Regarding the selected dose the CHMP considered 
that the proposed dose could be considered acceptable however it was recommended that it might 
be relevant to consider evaluating the highest tolerable dose. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
A total of 9 clinical studies with pharmacokinetic (PK) data were submitted (Table 10), with 766 
subjects receiving dabrafenib, including five studies in patients with BRAF mutant solid tumours 
(BRF113463, BRF113479, BRF113468, BRF112680, BRF113771), and five studies in patients with 
BRAF mutation-positive melanoma (BRF112680, BRF113220, BRF113710, BRF113929, 
BRF113683). Both women and men were included in the studies, the majority (96 %) of the 
subjects were Caucasian.  
Population pharmacokinetic analysis (2011N113667) and pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic 
analysis (2011N120468) were made using data from four of the studies (BRF112680, BRF113710, 
BRF113929 and BRF113683).

The plasma concentrations of dabrafenib and its three metabolites, hydroxy-dabrafenib (M7), 
carboxy-dabrafenib (M4) and desmethyl-dabrafenib (M8) were determined using two different ultra 
high pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) methods coupled with tandem mass spectrometric 
(MS/MS) detection. In addition, a validated accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) method was used 
to determine [14C] dabrafenib concentrations in plasma. As part of the clinical pharmacology DDI 
and drug combination studies, concentrations of midazolam, dexamethasone, and trametinib were 
assayed in plasma using validated methods. Concentrations of dabrafenib and its three metabolites 
were measured in urine for exploratory purposes. 
Absorption  
Dabrafenib mesylate is very slightly soluble at pH 1 and practically insoluble in the pH range 4-8 in 
aqueous media. Solubility in simulated gastric fluid (SGF, pH 1.2), fed state simulated intestinal 
fluid (FesSIF, pH 6.8) and fasted state simulated intestinal fluid (FasSIF, pH 6.2) was 43 µg/ml, 6.8 
µg/ml and 6.2 µg/ml, respectively. Dabrafenib solubility is pH-dependent, with decreasing solubility 
at increasing pH.  
Dabrafenib showed high in vitro permeability in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCKII) cells. Given 
the low solubility of dabrafenib, it may be classified as a BCS class II compound. Also the 
metabolites M7 and M8 were classified as high-permeability compounds while M4, which is more 
polar, showed low permeability.  
Absolute oral bioavailability of dabrafenib at a single 150 mg dose from the commercial formulation 
(HPMC capsule) was shown to be around 95% (90 % CI: 81%, 110 %). Dabrafenib exposure (Cmax 
and AUC) increased in a dose proportional manner between 12 and 300 mg following single-dose 
administration, but the increase was less than dose-proportional after repeat twice daily dosing. A 
decrease in exposure was observed with repeat dosing, likely due to induction of its own 
metabolism. Mean accumulation AUC Day 18/Day 1 ratios was 0.73. Following administration of 
150 mg twice daily, geometric mean Cmax, AUC(0-τ) and predose concentration (Cτ) were 
1478 ng/ml, 4341 ng*hr/ml and 26 ng/ml, respectively.

A preliminary evaluation of the effect of food on dabrafenib absorption after multiple doses was 
made in a subset of patients in study BRF112680. A moderate fat, moderate calorie meal showed no 
clinically meaningful changes in AUC following administration of repeat dose of dabrafenib gelatin 
capsules, with a mean ratio for AUCtau of 1.06 (90% CI: 0.668, 1.68). Cmax was lower when 
administered with food, with a mean ratio of 0.67 (90% CI: 0.40, 1.13).  
The effect of a high-fat meal on the absorption of dabrafenib after a single dose of the commercial 
HPMC capsule was evaluated in Cohort 2 in study BRF113468. Fourteen (14) subjects randomly 
received two different treatments in a cross-over fashion: Regimen C where single dose of 150 mg 
dabrafenib as 2x75 mg HPMC capsule, dosed after a 10 hr fast (Subjects remained fasted for 4 
hours after the dose) and regimen D where single dose of 150 mg dabrafenib as 2x75 mg HPMC 
capsule were taken within 30 minutes after start of eating a high-fat breakfast. Administration of 
dabrafenib HPMC capsules with a high-fat meal resulted in a mean 30% decrease in dabrafenib 
bioavailability (Cmax and AUC decreased by 51 % and 31 % respectively, relative to administration 
in a fasted state. Tmax was delayed from on average 2 hr to 6 hr, and t1/2 was prolonged from 8.4 
hr to 10.6 hr. 
Distribution 
The human plasma protein binding of dabrafenib and its pharmacologically active metabolites at 
three different concentrations was determined in vitro in pooled human plasma from 3 male donors, 
using equilibrium dialysis. Plasma protein binding was determined to be 99.6%, 99.5% and 99.9% 
for dabrafenib, carboxy-dabrafenib (M4) and desmethyl-dabrafenib (M8) respectively and 96.3% 
for hydroxy-dabrafenib (M7). There was no evidence of concentration dependent protein binding. 
Dabrafenib volume of distribution was estimated in the absolute bioavailability study, with an IV 
microdose of 50 μg [14C]-dabrafenib administered together with a single oral 150 mg dose of 
un-labelled dabrafenib. Dabrafenib had a Vdss of 45.5 L, consistent with total body water.  Vdss of 
the active metabolites was not determined.  
Dabrafenib was determined to be a substrate for Pgp and BCRP in vitro and the active metabolites 
M7 and M8 were shown to be substrates for Pgp in adequately performed studies using monolayers 
of MDR1- or (murine) bcrp-transfected MDCKII cell lines, respectively. M4, which is more polar than 
dabrafenib, M7 and M8, was not a Pgp substrate.  
Neither dabrafenib nor its 3 active metabolites were shown to be inhibitors of Pgp in vitro. 
Metabolism 
The metabolism of dabrafenib is primarily mediated by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 to form 
hydroxy-dabrafenib, which is further oxidized via CYP3A4 to form carboxy-dabrafenib. 
Carboxy-dabrafenib can be decarboxylated via a non-enzymatic process to form 
desmethyl-dabrafenib. Carboxy-dabrafenib is excreted in bile and urine. Desmethyl-dabrafenib 
may also be formed in the gut and reabsorbed. The geometric mean plasma half-life of dabrafenib, 
hydroxy-dabrafenib, carboxy-dabrafenib and desmethyl-dabrafenib was 8.4, 9.7, 20.9 and 22.2 
hours respectively. Mean metabolite to parent AUC ratios following repeat-dose administration 
were 0.9, 11 and 0.7 for hydroxy-, carboxy-, and desmethyl-dabrafenib, respectively.

Elimination 
The elimination of dabrafenib and its major metabolites has been characterised in a single dose 
mass-balance study and in several in vitro metabolism studies using human liver microsomes 
(HLM) and recombinant CYP enzymes. A total of 70% of the dose excreted in urine and faeces was 
structurally identified and quantified. In the mass-balance study (BRF113463) where four human 
subjects with BRAF mutation-positive solid tumours (3 M, 1 F) received a single oral dose of 
[14C]-dabrafenib as an oral suspension (95 mg free base, 80 μCi) in the fasted state. Plasma and 
excreta were collected at various times or intervals through 240 hours postdose. Mean total 
recovery in the mass-balance study was 94%, with 71% and 23% of the dose recovered in faeces 
and urine respectively.  
The geometric mean IV plasma clearance (CL) of dabrafenib was 12.0 L/hr.  Terminal half-life 
following an intravenous single microdose is 2.6 hours. Dabrafenib terminal half-life after a single 
dose is 8 hours due to absorption-limited elimination after oral administration (flip-flop 
pharmacokinetics). 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In a dose escalation study, pharmacokinetics of dabrafenib and its major metabolites were 
evaluated after single and repeated doses of 12 mg once daily (OD) up to 300 mg BID. This study 
was performed with the gelatin capsule.  
Following the administration of 150 mg BID, the AUC was 47% lower on Day 15 relative to Day 1.  
Indeed, a 2-fold mean increase in the 6-β-hydroxycortisol-to-cortisol urinary ratio, a marker of 
CYP3A4 activity, was observed after repeat dosing, suggesting induction of CYP3A4 by dabrafenib.  
Furthermore, dabrafenib exposure increased approximately linearly with dose after single doses, 
but less than dose-proportionally after repeated doses. On Day 15, a 2-fold increase in dose 
(150 mg BID vs. 300 mg BID) resulted in a 43% increase in dabrafenib AUC(tau) and no increase in 
Ctrough. As dose dependency was observed at multiple doses but not at single doses, the dose 
dependency is likely due to dose-dependent auto-induction rather than to solubility-limited 
absorption. 
Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, dabrafenib CL/F increases from about 12 L/hr 
after a single dose to about 35 L/hr at steady state. The time to steady state was estimated to be 
about 14 days and is dependent on half-life of the enzyme rather than half-life of dabrafenib and its 
metabolites. 
The most potent metabolite, hydroxy-dabrafenib (M7), showed similar pharmacokinetics as 
dabrafenib, with about 47% lower exposure on Day 15 as compared with Day 1. 
Carboxy-dabrafenib (M4) and desmethyl-dabrafenib (M8) have longer half-lives than dabrafenib, 
and accumulated with repeat dosing, but less than dose-proportionally. 
Due to the small increase in exposure at an increase in dose at the highest tested doses, a 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached in the dose-escalation study as dose escalation 
was stopped at 300 mg BID.

Special populations 
The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of dabrafenib has not been investigated in 
a clinical study.  In the population pharmacokinetic analysis, 233 (39.2%) subjects had mild (GFR 
60-<90 mL/min/1.73 m2) and 30 (5.0%) subjects had moderate (GFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2) renal 
impairment. The effect of GFR on dabrafenib CL/F was small (<6% for both categories) and not 
clinically relevant. In addition, mild and moderate renal impairment did not have a significant effect 
on dabrafenib metabolite concentrations. No data are available in subjects with severe renal 
impairment. 
The pharmacokinetics of dabrafenib has not been evaluated in subjects with hepatic impairment. In 
the  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis,  65  (10.9%)  subjects  were  categorized  as  having  mild 
hepatic impairment, and since only 3 (0.5%) subjects had moderate hepatic impairment they were 
grouped together with subjects with mild impairment. There were no subjects with severe hepatic 
impairment in the data set. The oral clearance and thus exposure to dabrafenib was not significantly 
different between subjects with mild hepatic impairment and subjects with normal hepatic function 
(4% difference). In addition, mild hepatic impairment did not have a significant effect on dabrafenib 
metabolite concentrations.  
In the population pharmacokinetic analysis weight was found to influence dabrafenib oral clearance 
(CL/F), oral volume of distribution (Vc/F) and apparent inter-compartmental clearance (Q/F). The 
predicted changes in exposure in a typical subject with low (50 kg) or high (140 kg) body weight as 
compared with a typical 80 kg subject was within 20% and thereby not considered clinically 
relevant. Body weight also affected the active metabolites M7 and M8 with <35% difference 
(inversely related relationship for M8) between each of the extremes and the typical value.  
In the population pharmacokinetic analysis, there was no significant effect of age on CL/F of 
dabrafenib or M7, while age ≥75 years (n=21 subjects) was a significant predictor of M4 and M8 
concentrations with a 41-42% greater exposure. Metabolite M8 is predicted to contribute less to the 
effect than dabrafenib and M7 (hydroxy-dabrafenib), respectively, and M4 (carboxy-dabrafenib) is 
suggested not to contribute.  
No studies have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of dabrafenib in paediatric 
patients. 
In the population pharmacokinetic analysis, dabrafenib CL/F was 9% lower (95% CI: 5%, 13%) in 
female subjects relative to male subjects, but this difference was not considered clinically 
meaningful. Sex had no significant influence on pharmacokinetics of the active metabolites. 
In the population PK analysis, only 9 (1.5%) subjects were not Caucasian, and only 21 (3.5%) 
subjects were Hispanic or Latino, therefore race and ethnicity covariates was not explored.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In study UH2008/00115/02 dabrafenib inhibited CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19 and 2D6 with calculated IC50 
values of >25, 10.9, 11, >25 µM, respectively. For CYP3A4, IC50s were 18.6 µM for testosterone 
and 15.6 µM for midazolam.  In study CD2009/00012/00 dabrafenib inhibited CYP2C8 and 3A4 
(atorvastatin, nifedipine) with calculated IC50 values of 8.2, 16 and 32 µM, respectively. 
Dabrafenib showed metabolism-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4 (nifedipine and midazolam) with 
2.1 and 4.2 fold decrease in IC50 value. The control inhibitor, troleandomycin showed a 12- and 
26-fold decrease in IC50 for nifedepine and midazolam respectively. In study 2010N110340 
dabrafenib inhibited CYP1A2, 2C9, and 2C19 with calculated IC50 values of 87 µM, 7.2 µM, and, 22 
µM, respectively. 
In vitro studies performed with dabrafenib metabolites showed that M7 inhibited CYP1A2, 2C9 and 
3A4 (midazolam) with calculated IC50 values of 83, 29 and 44 μM, respectively (Study 
2010N111279). Metabolite M4 did not inhibit CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4 at 
concentration up to 100 µM and did not show any metabolism dependent inhibition of any of the 
tested CYP isoforms (Study 2010N110991-00). The third metabolite, desmethyl-dabrafenib (M8) 
inhibited CYP2B6, 2C8, C9, 2C19 and 3A4 (midazolam, atorvastatin, nifedipine) with calculated IC50 
values of 78, 47, 6.3, 36, 17, 20 and 28 µM, respectively. For CYP3A4, desmethyl-dabrafenib 
showed metabolism-dependent inhibition with a decrease in IC50 value of 1.7 to 2.3 fold (Study 
2010N1112910-01). 
In study 2011N124750 the potential for increased exposure (AUC) of rosiglitazone (CYP2C8), 
warfarin (CYP2C9) or omeprazole (CYP2C19) if coadministered with dabrafenib, taking into account 
any contributing metabolites has been investigated. For dabrafenib the hepatic inlet concentration 
was estimated however, for the metabolites the unbound Cmax was used. The extrapolated increase 
in rosiglitazone, warfarin and omeprazole exposure (AUC) was estimated to be 1 ie indicating no 
interaction.  
Dabrafenib  was  also  shown  to  induce  human  CYP3A4  and  CYP2B6  in  hepatocytes  (Study 
CD2008/01428/00).  
Dabrafenib was shown to be an in vitro substrate for human P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and murine breast 
cancer  resistance  protein  1  (BCRP1)  efflux  transporters  in  vitro  (studies  UH2008/00115/02  and 
UD2010/00042/00).  The  oral  clinical bioavailability  of  dabrafenib  was  95%  (Study  BRF113479), 
indicating that these efflux transporters have minimal impact on bioavailability. Dabrafenib and its 
metabolites  were  not  inhibitors  of  Pgp  in  vitro  (studies  2009/00143/01  and  2011N119324-01). 
Dabrafenib and M8 and M7 were shown to be inhibitors of BCRP,  while M4 did not inhibit BCRP 
(Studies 2011N112849-00 and 2011N119323-00). 
Dabrafenib inhibited human OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 in vitro with calculated IC50 values of 1.4 μM 
and 4.7 μM, respectively (Study CD2009/00116). Metabolite M7 (0.1 to 100 μM) inhibited human 
OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 in vitro with calculated IC50 values of 4.3 μM and 23 μM, respectively. 
Metabolite M4 (0.1 to 100 μM) inhibited human OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 in vitro with calculated IC50 
values of 18 μM and 20 μM, respectively. Metabolie M8 (0.1 to 100 μM) inhibited human OATP1B1 
and OATP1B3 in vitro with calculated IC50 values of 0.83 μM and 4.3 μM, respectively (Studies 
2010N110986, 2010N110987 and 2010/00386/00).

Dabrafenib, M7 and M8 inhibited OAT1 with IC50 values of 6.9 µM, 29 µM and 10 µM, respectively.  
Dabrafenib and its three metabolites inhibited OAT3 with IC50 values of 3.4 µM, 7.3 µM, 9.0 µM and 
3.4 µM, respectively (Study 2012N131808 01).  
An in vivo study (BRF112680) with oral midazolam has been performed with repeated doses of 
dabrafenib. The study was performed with the gelatine capsule and not the final formulation, HPMC 
capsules. The gelatine capsule gives lower exposure (30%) than the HPMC capsule. The results 
showed a decrease in the exposure of a single dose of midazolam by 61% and 74% for Cmax and 
AUC, respectively.  
Study BRF113771 is an ongoing 4-part in vivo study (in 4 separate cohorts of subjects) designed to 
evaluate the effects of repeat dose dabrafenib on the single dose pharmacokinetics of warfarin, the 
effects of repeat dose oral ketoconazole and oral gemfibrozil on the repeat dose pharmacokinetics 
of dabrafenib and the repeat dose pharmacokinetics of dabrafenib in subjects with BRAF mutant 
solid tumors. Part A evaluates the effect of dabrafenib on S-warfarin, a CYP2C9 substrate. Parts B 
and C evaluate the effect of ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, and gemfibrozil, a CYP2C8 
inhibitor, on dabrafenib. Partial PK results are available from Part B. Seven out of 12 patients has 
completed part B. Administration of ketoconazole resulted in an increase in both Cmax and AUC for 
dabrafenib, with 26% and 57% respectively.  For the metabolites the increase on Cmax and AUC 
was as follows: 17% and 48% for M7, 54% and 61% for M8 for Cmax and AUC respectively and 
33% for M4 for both Cmax and AUC.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Tumour biopsies were collected in Study BRF112680 for immunohistochemistry staining analysis at 
baseline and 1 to 2 weeks of dosing in 8 evaluable subjects who received doses of 70 to 200 mg BID 
of dabrafenib. The median (range) decrease in pERK expression from baseline was 83.9% (38.0%, 
93.3%) in subjects with BRAF V600 mutation-positive metastatic melanoma, indicating inhibition of 
the enzymatic pathway. Six out of 8 subjects showed ≥80% inhibition of the pERK pathway. The 
relationship between systemic effective concentration and % pERK inhibition was characterized 
using a maximum response (Emax) model with 100% maximum inhibition and an IC50 of 134 ng/mL 
(95% CI: 92.7, 155). The percent change in pERK was predicted by total daily dose on the basis of 
the mean pre-dose concentrations (Cτ) observed on Day 15. A dose-related decrease in pERK was 
predicted with total daily doses <200 mg (100 mg BID) dabrafenib, with a plateau occurring beyond 
total daily doses of 200 mg. Administration of 150 mg BID was predicted to provide, on average, 
near maximum predicted inhibition of this target (approximately 80%) based on the Emax model.

FDG-PET imaging was performed at Screening and at Week 2 in a subset of subjects enrolled in the 
dose escalation part of FTIH study (BRF112680) following doses of 35 mg once daily up to 300 mg 
BID. A decrease in mean maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was observed in 53 out of 
56 subjects, with a median 60% decrease inSUVmax (percent change from baseline range -100% 
to +19%) across all doses. The decrease from baseline in sum of SUVmax (sum of the maximum 
uptake measured intarget lesions) was generally dose-related, except at 35 mg BID and 200 mg 
BID. The mean percent change from baseline ranged from -19 to -58% across the different cohorts. 
Decreases in FDG-PET uptake were related to the daily dose administered using aninhibitory Emax 
model. The median (95% bootstrap CI) total daily dose resulting in 50% of maximum response 
(ED50) was 214 mg (168, 312). There was no apparent benefit of a TID vs. a BID regimen. 
In terms of secondary pharmacology, an exposure-response analysis was conducted to determine 
the relationship between the independently manually-read QTc interval and time-matched plasma 
concentrations of dabrafenib using a nonlinear mixed effects model. Data were available from 108 
subjects (869 observations) receiving total daily doses of 12 mg to 600 mg dabrafenib in part 1 of 
study BRF112680 (gelatin capsules). Ten persons received 300 mg BID of gelatin capsules, the 
dose corresponding to the applied dosage of 150 mg BID of HPMC capsules. The predicted median 
changes in QTcP (QT duration corrected using an estimated population factor) at the maximum Cmax 
value with the recommended part 2 dose and at the highest dose administered (300 mg BID) were 
≤0.5 msec. Of note, one of two subjects in the all treated population in this study that had QTcF (QT 
duration corrected for heart rate by Fridericia’s formula) interval increases to ≥501 msec, was the 
same subject that erroneously received daily doses of 900 mg (300 mg TID, gelatin capsules) 
instead of 300 mg (100 mg TID) of dabrafenib throughout the PK sampling period.

The analysis was also conducted by examining the relationship between QTcP and each of the 
metabolites. The slope of the exposure-response relationship for QTcP and dabrafenib metabolites 
was positive for all three metabolites. Based on the geometric mean Cmax value observed at the 
recommended dose of 150 mg BID and at the highest dose administered in this study, 300 mg BID, 
the median change in QTcP was predicted to be ≤5.5 msec. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Based on exposure, relative potency, and pharmacokinetic properties, both hydroxy- and 
desmethyl-dabrafenib are likely to contribute to the clinical activity of dabrafenib; while the activity 
of carboxy-dabrafenib is not likely to be significant. In most pharmacokinetic studies, the three 
major metabolites were quantified as well as parent dabrafenib. The metabolism of dabrafenib and 
its metabolites, and the metabolite pharmacokinetics in plasma are considered sufficiently well 
characterised by in vitro studies, mass-balance data and other clinical pharmacology studies.  
Dabrafenib has low solubility and high permeability (BCS class II). As dabrafenib solubility is 
pH-dependent, its bioavailability might possibly be affected by concomitant administration of 
medicines such as proton pump inhibitors that increase gastric pH. Based on these theoretical 
considerations, the SmPC contains a warning that concomitant administration of dabrafenib with 
such medicines should be avoided. In addition, the CHMP requested the applicant to perform an in 
vivo study to investigate the interaction between pH-altering agents (e.g., proton pump inhibitor) 
and dabrafenib (the same cohort of subjects will be used to evaluate the effect of repeat dose of 
rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer on dabrafenib).This issue is covered in the RMP. 
The effect of food on dabrafenib was modest. With a high-fat meal, there was a 30% decrease in 
single-dose AUC. This food effect was detected as compared with a very long fast (10+4 hours) 
compared with the 2+1 hours fast recommended in clinical practice. A preliminary evaluation 
indicated that in clinical practice, the effect of a moderate-fat meal at steady state is negligible. 
However, the latter analysis was performed with the early gelatin capsule and the effect of a 
moderate-fat meal on the HPMC capsule is unknown. The SmPC recommends that dabrafenib 
should be administered at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after food, since this was the 
recommendation used in Phase III.  
The effect of bodyweight on total active moiety has not been predicted. However, given the overall 
variability, it is agreed that the effect of bodyweight is not clinically relevant.  
Dose adjustments in the elderly do therefore not seem to be necessary from a pharmacokinetic 
point of view. 
There are insufficient data to evaluate the potential effect of race on dabrafenib pharmacokinetics. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/242419/2013 
Page 45/95 
 
  
  
 
Studies in patients with hepatic or renal impairment are ongoing. The applicant is recommended to 
determine free fraction at a few time points in all patients in the normal function and severe 
dysfunction groups, respectively. If a significant effect on free fraction of dabrafenib is seen in 
patients with severe organ dysfunction, evaluation of free fraction in the moderate impairment and 
possibly mild impairment groups will be necessary, and therefore sampling should be planned 
accordingly. Awaiting the final study reports, the SmPC contains adequate warnings to reflect that 
dabrafenib should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment and in patients 
with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetic study in patients with renal or 
hepatic impairment is included in the RMP. 
Dabrafenib and its active metabolites appear to be primarily eliminated via metabolism (mainly 
CYP2C8 and 3A4 for dabrafenib, CYP3A4 for metabolites) but also to some extent via biliary 
excretion. Elimination of active moiety via the kidneys is negligible.  
Interim data from the study BRF113771 with the CYP3A4/Pgp inhibitor ketoconazole indicate a 
relatively modest effect on dabrafenib, M7 and M8 (about 60% increase in AUC). The applicant was 
recommended to submit the final results of the study which are expected to be available in 2Q2013. 
In addition, the SmPC contains relevant warnings for inhibitors and inducers of CYP2C8 and 3A4. 
Dabrafenib has been shown to induce its own metabolism and a study with midazolam showed that 
it is a strong inducer of CYP3A4. In vitro data indicated that dabrafenib may be an inducer via PXR 
as well as CAR, and, thus, transport proteins in addition to several phase I (CYPs) and phase II (e.g. 
UGTs) metabolising enzymes may be affected. This might have large implications on the use of 
concomitant drugs, which has been sufficiently addressed in the SmPC. 
Although the net effect of dabrafenib on CYP3A4 substrates appears to be induction at steady state, 
there is a risk of inhibition of CYP3A4 during the first days of treatment with dabrafenib, before full 
induction is obtained, as dabrafenib also appears to be a metabolism-dependent inhibitor of 
CYP3A4. The CHMP requested the applicant to perform a study in order to evaluate the effect of 
repeat dose of rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer on the repeat dose of dabrafenib. This study is 
included in the RMP. 
Furthermore, inhibition of OATP1B1/OATP1B3 by dabrafenib cannot be excluded and the applicant 
should perform an interaction study with an OATP1B1/OATP1B3 substrate, such as rosuvastatin. 
Until these data are available, the SmPC include relevant warnings. In addition, as dabrafenib is 
metabolised more than 25% the applicant will perform in vitro studies in order to further investigate 
if dabrafenib and its active metabolites are substrates for OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. These issues are 
covered in the RMP. 
The results of exposure/response analysis indicate that at the 150 mg BID dose, the majority of 
subjects are likely at the top of the exposure-response relationship (i.e. near Emax). No strong 
relationships between AEs and exposure, except for pyrexia, were evident. Due to auto-induction, 
increase in exposure was less than dose-linear, and in the dose escalation study, an MTD was not 
reached.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In general, the Applicant has sufficiently described the pharmacokinetics of dabrafenib. The 
pharmacodynamic effects of dabrafenib are well demonstrated in studies in both healthy subjects 
and the proposed target population.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Three studies were submitted in support of the use of dabrafenib in the claimed indication, i.e. 
treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation:  
Table 11 Development Program for Dabrafenib as Monotherapy in Metastatic Melanoma as of the 
Clinical Cut-off Dates for Each Study 
a. Randomized in error and did not receive treatment; included in ITT population but not the Safety Population.  
b. An allele-specific real-time PCR assay was utilized to specifically detect the BRAF V600E vs. V600K mutation. 
Dose response study 
Study BRF112680 
The  selected  dose  of  dabrafenib  (150  mg  BID)  for  further  phase  II  and  III  clinical  studies  was 
chosen based on results from Study BRF112680, which was a Phase I, open-label, multiple-dose, 
dose-escalation study that investigated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of 
dabrafenib in subjects with BRAF V600 mutation positive melanoma or other solid tumors.  
BRF112680 was a 2-part study in which Part 1 identified the recommended Part 2 dose using a 
dose-escalation procedure. Dose escalation was designed to proceed until target clinical activity or 
PD activity was observed, until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was reached, or until further 
dose escalation was predicted to not provide sufficient increase in exposure. The recommended 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/242419/2013 
Page 47/95 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
dose and regimen for Part 2 was selected based on the safety, PK, and pharmacodynamic (PD) 
profiles observed after the treatment of subjects with BRAF V600 mutation positive melanoma. 
Daily doses of 12 mg (12 mg once daily) to 600 mg (300 mg BID) in 10 cohorts in Part 1 were 
investigated (gelatin capsules). PD endpoints obtained in Part 1 included tumour biomarkers, 
fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography [FDG-PET], tumour size, and response rate. 
Part 2 explored further the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of the recommended dose (150 
mg BID) and a lower dose (50 mg BID) of dabrafenib in subjects with V600 BRAF mutation-positive 
tumours (gelatin capsules).  
The response rate (CR + PR) at Week 9 reported by the investigators for subjects in the 
Dose-Escalation Tumor Response Population in Part 1 of Study BRF112680 is presented in Table 12.  
Table  12  Investigator-assessed  Response  at  Week  9  for  the  Dose-Escalation  Tumor  Response 
Population in Part 1. 
The response rate was 55% (95% CI: 31.5, 76.9) in subjects with metastatic melanoma without 
untreated brain metastases and 40% (95% CI: 12.2, 73.8) in those with asymptomatic, untreated, 
brain metastases treated at 150 mg BID. The median PFS was 6.31 months (95% CI: 3.48, 10.81) 
in subjects without untreated brain metastases and 4.21 months (95% CI: 3.32, 5.26) in those with 
untreated brain metastases. 
Nine of 10 subjects with asymptomatic, untreated, brain metastases had a decrease in brain lesion 
size, and 4 of 10 subjects achieved complete resolution of all brain lesions. A decrease in the size of 
extracranial metastases was observed in all 9 subjects with responding brain lesions. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/242419/2013 
Page 48/95 
 
 
 
  
  
 
The response rate was 59% (95% CI: 32.9, 81.6) for subjects with V600E-mutation positive 
melanoma without untreated brain metastases treated with 150 mg BID dabrafenib and 17% (95% 
CI: 3.6, 41.4) for those treated with 50 mg BID. 
A total of 24 subjects (21%) experienced SAEs during the first 9 weeks of treatment in Part 1. The 
most common SAE was cutaneous SCC, which occurred in 9 subjects (8%). The incidence of SAEs 
in the first 9 weeks was highest at the 300 mg BID dose cohort (50%). The MTD was not reached 
in this study. In terms of safety, there were no discontinuations of study treatment or deaths due to 
AEs (fatal SAEs) in the study. 
2.5.1.  Main study 
BREAK-3 (BRF113683) 
This was a Phase III randomized, open-label study comparing dabrafenib to DTIC in previously 
untreated subjects with BRAF mutation positive advanced (Stage III) or metastatic (Stage IV) 
melanoma. The BREAK-3 study was conducted in 12 countries in the US, European Union, Canada, 
Russian Federation and Australia. 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Main inclusion criteria: 
• Histologically confirmed unresectable Stage III or metastatic (Stage IV) BRAF V600E mutation 
positive melanoma 
• Treatment naïve for advanced (unresectable Stage III)/metastatic disease (with exception of 
IL-2, surgery, and radiotherapy which were allowed) 
• Measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) in solid tumours  
• Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 0 or 1 
• Protocol specified criteria for adequate organ function. 
Main exclusion criteria: 
• Ocular or primary mucosal melanoma 
• Currently receiving anti-cancer therapy, or use of any investigational anti-cancer or other drug 
within 28 days of receipt of first dose of dabrafenib 
• Major surgery, radiotherapy, or immunotherapy within last 4 weeks 
• History of other malignancy. Subjects who had been disease-free for 5 years, or subjects with a 
history of completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer or successfully treated in situ carcinoma 
were eligible 
• History of human immunodeficiency virus infection or glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 
deficiency 
• Evidence of active central nervous system (CNS) disease or cardiac metastases 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/242419/2013

• Cardiac abnormalities, including: QTc ≥480 msec; history of acute coronary syndrome (including 
unstable angina), coronary angioplasty, stenting, or cardiac arrhythmias (except sinus arrhythmia) 
within past 24 weeks; New York Heart Association Class II-IV heart failure; or abnormal valve 
morphology documented by echocardiogram. 
Treatments 
Eligible subjects were randomized to receive oral dabrafenib 150 mg BID or intravenous DTIC 1000 
mg/m2 every 3 weeks (Figure x). Subjects were evaluated for disease progression at Week 6, Week 
12, Week 21, Week 30, Week 39, Week 48 and every 12 weeks thereafter.  Subjects continued on 
treatment until radiologic disease progression, death, the occurrence of an unacceptable adverse 
event (AE), or withdrawal from the study. 
Due to the open-label nature of the study, an independent radiology review, blinded to treatment 
assignment, was performed during the conduct of the trial. Subjects randomized to DTIC treatment 
were allowed to receive dabrafenib after initial radiologic progression was confirmed by 
independent review. Subjects were then followed for response, progression, survival, and further 
anti-cancer therapy while receiving dabrafenib, and for survival and further anti-cancer therapy 
after progression while on dabrafenib.

Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to establish the superiority of dabrafenib over DTIC with 
respect to Progression Free Survival (PFS) in subjects with advanced or metastatic BRAF V600E 
mutation positive melanoma. 
Secondary objectives included comparison of Overall Survival (OS) and Overall Response Rate 
(ORR) between treatment groups, assessment of duration of response, assessment of the best 
ORR and PFS of subjects in the DTIC treatment group after initial progression and subsequent 
crossover to dabrafenib, evaluation of the safety and tolerability of dabrafenib and evaluation of 
HRQOL status.

Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was PFS, defined as the time from randomization until the first date 
of either objective disease progression or death due to any cause. Disease progression was based 
on radiographic or photographic evidence, and assessments made by the investigator according to 
RECIST v1.1. 
The key secondary endpoints were the following: 
-OS, defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. 
-PFS2, defined for subjects randomized to the DTIC treatment group as the time to progression or 
death after cross-over to dabrafenib after initial progression on DTIC. 
-Overall Response Rate (ORR), defined as the percentage of subjects achieving either a Complete or 
Partial tumour Response (CR/PR). 
-ORR in subjects who cross over to dabrafenib after initial progression on DTIC. 
-Duration of response, for those subjects who show a complete or partial tumour response, defined 
as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until the first documented sign of disease 
progression or death due to any cause. 
-Duration of response in subjects who cross-over to dabrafenib after initial progression on DTIC. 
-Validation of BRAF mutation assay for regulatory approval and registration.  
Sample size 
The sample size was based on the hypothesized differences in PFS between the two treatment 
arms.  
In particular, the study had statistical power to detect a 67% reduction in risk of progression or 
death (corresponding to a hazard ratio of 0.33) in subjects who received dabrafenib (median PFS 
of 6 months) compared with subjects who receive DTIC (median PFS of 2 months. To show a 200% 
improvement in median PFS, the required number of PFS events to achieve statistical power of 
99.7% was 102. To achieve 102 events, it was estimated that the study should include 200 
subjects. At clinical cut-off 250 subjects had been enrolled in the study. These hypotheses were to 
be tested using a one-sided test for superiority with α=0.02. Two-sided confidence intervals with 
α=0.05 were used in the primary analysis. 
Randomisation 
Eligible subjects were randomized 3:1 to receive oral dabrafenib 150 mg BID or intravenous DTIC 
1000 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. Randomization was stratified according to disease staging at study 
entry (unresectable III+IVM1a+IVb vs. IVM1c).  
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study.

Statistical methods 
The primary endpoint was analysed using the stratified log-rank test, stratified for the 
randomisation factors. The following censoring rules applied: 
• If two or more scheduled assessments were missing or not evaluable followed by an assessment 
of PD, PFS was censored at the last adequate assessment prior to PD or death. 
• If anti-cancer therapy was started without evidence of documented disease progression or was 
started prior to documented progression, then PFS was censored at the date of the last radiological 
assessment that was no later than the date of initiation of anti-cancer therapy. If an assessment 
occurred on the same day as the start of new anti-cancer therapy, that assessment was used for 
censoring assuming that the assessment occurred prior to the administration of new anti-cancer 
therapy. The date of response at that assessment was used for censoring. 
• If a subject had only a baseline visit or did not have a date of radiological scan that was no later 
than the date of initiation of anti-cancer therapy, PFS was censored at the date of randomization. 
If a subject had not progressed or died, then PFS was censored at the date of the last adequate 
assessment, defined as an assessment at which the investigator-determined response was CR, PR, 
or SD. The date of response was used as the censoring date. 
No interim analysis of PFS was performed. 
Sensitivity analysis 
• Analysis including symptomatic progressions: In this analysis symptomatic progression was 
defined as a PFS event (rather than censoring at the time of symptomatic progression). 
• Ignoring extended loss to follow-up and start of new anticancer therapy.: In this analysis 
subjects who have neither progressed nor died were censored from the PFS analysis at the date of 
the last radiological scan assessed by the investigator, regardless of whether missing assessments 
or initiation of new anti-cancer therapy prior to documented progression. 
• Stepwise Cox Proportional Hazards Model Regression with Prognostic Factors as Covariates: 
Subjects are randomized and stratified for disease stage at screening (unresectable 
III+IVM1a+IVM1b vs. IVM1c). However, there are additional baseline and disease history factors 
that are well documented and are historically correlated with survival and, as such, are prognostic 
for the management of melanoma patients. The Cox proportional hazards model used a stepwise 
procedure in which the treatment remained in the model, disease stage was included as the 
stratification variable, and selected prognostic factors (age, sex, presence of visceral disease, 
baseline LDH, ECOG performance status, number of disease sites) were investigated using entry 
and removal significance levels of 0.05. 
• Post-hoc analysis - visit-based sensitivity analysis (potential effect of off-schedule assessments): 
In this analysis progression dates were set to the protocol-defined visit timepoints for on-schedule 
assessments (defined as ±7 days for the protocol-defined assessment schedule) or were set to the 
next visit timepoint if the assessment occurred off-schedule (outside of the visit window). The 
same rules were applied for censoring dates, except that the actual date of the assessment was 
used if the assessment occurred off-schedule. In the event of death, the actual date was used in 
the analysis.

Subgroup analysis 
PFS by subgroup was analysed according to number of metastatic disease sites (<3 or ≥3]), ECOG 
PS (=0 or ≥1), visceral disease (yes or no); baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) [≤ upper limit of 
normal (ULN) or >ULN]; age (<65 or ≥65); sex and disease stage (IVM1c or III, IVM1a and IVM1b).

Numbers analysed 
For the purpose of analysis, the following populations were defined: 
•  The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) (n=250) - all randomized subjects regardless of whether or not 
treatment was administered. This population was based on the treatment to which the 
subject was randomized.  
•  The Safety Population (n=246) - all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of 
study drug, and was based on the actual treatment received, if this differed from that to 
which the subject was randomized. 
•  The Crossover Population (n=28) - subjects who were randomized to the DTIC arm, and 
who elected at the point of disease progression to receive dabrafenib. Only subjects who 
received at least one dose of dabrafenib were included in the Crossover Population.

One subject in the dabrafenib ITT Population and 3 subjects in the DTIC ITT Population were 
excluded from the Safety Population since they did not receive any study treatment. Additionally, 1 
subject who was randomized to treatment with DTIC only received dabrafenib and is analyzed in the 
dabrafenib Safety Population.

Other secondary endpoints 
Health-related quality of life 
For the quality of life (QOL) assessment, both the European Organization for Research and 
Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC-QLQ-C30) and the EuroQol 5D 
(EQ-5D) questionnaires were administered to subjects at screening (before drug administration), 
Week 6, Week 12, Week 15, at disease progression, and at approximately 30 days (±7) after 
progression. At screening subjects in the two treatment arms showed comparable results of HRQOL 
as determined from both EORTCQLQ-C30 and EQ-5D (data not shown). 
Regarding EORTCQLQ-C30, overall global health status scores showed similar profiles between the 
two treatment arms. For functionality scales and symptom scales the results were also comparable 
between the two treatment arms. However, scores related to “role functioning”, “social functioning” 
and “fatigue” were markedly better in the dabrafenib arm than in the DTIC arm. For EQ-5D, upon 
progression there was an increase in the percentage of subjects in both arms reporting “some 
problem” or “extreme problem” with all dimensions of the EQ-5D relative to screening For both 
questionnaires, the number of assessments decreased throughout the study. Consequently, 
meaningful data does not exist after Week 15.

Study BREAK-2  
BREAK-2 was a single-arm, Phase II open-label study of metastatic melanoma in the BRAF V600E 
(primary) and BRAF V600K mutation positive populations. Key eligibility criteria included 
histologically confirmed metastatic melanoma (Stage IV) with BRAF (V600E and V600K) mutation, 
treatment-naïve or received prior systemic treatment in the metastatic setting and measurable 
disease according to RECIST (version 1.1), ECOG PS of 0 to 1. 
Subjects received dabrafenib 150 mg BID and continued on treatment until disease progression, 
death, or unacceptable AE. After discontinuation of the study treatment, subjects remained on the 
study for follow-up assessments and updates to other anticancer treatments received until death. 
The primary objective for this study was to assess the ORR, defined as the proportion of subjects 
with investigator-assessed complete responses (CR) and partial responses (PR), after treatment 
with the oral dabrafenib in subjects with BRAF V600E mutation positive metastatic melanoma.  
Results 
A total of 92 subjects were enrolled in the study: 76subjects with V600E mutation positive 
metastatic melanoma and 16 subjects with V600K mutation positive metastatic melanoma. 
The median age was 55.5 years, 53% of the subjects were male and the majority of subjects were 
white (99%). Most subjects (52%) had tumours in at least 3 organs, and the most common 
locations of disease were lymph nodes (61%), lung (47%), subcutaneous tissue (36%) and liver 
(34%). All subjects received some type of prior anti-cancer therapy including surgery, radiotherapy 
and other biologic, immune, hormonal or small molecule therapies. 
As of the data cut-off date, 6 subjects (7%) had withdrawn from the study and 29 subjects (32%) 
died. 
The key efficacy data is presented in Table 22.

Study BREAK-MB  
Study BREAK-MB was a global, multi-center, open-label, two-cohort, Phase II study designed to 
prospectively evaluate the activity of dabrafenib in subjects with histologically confirmed (Stage IV) 
BRAF-mutation positive (V600E or V600K) melanoma metastatic to the brain. Subjects were 
enrolled into Cohort A (subjects with no prior local therapy for brain metastasis) or Cohort B 
(subjects who had received prior local therapy for brain metastasis). 
All subjects in the study received twice daily dosing of 150 mg dabrafenib (oral HPMC capsules) until 
evidence of disease progression, death, or unacceptable AEs.  
The primary objective of the study was to assess the overall intracranial response rate (OIRR), 
defined as the proportion of subjects with confirmed complete or partial intracranial responses 
assessed by investigators in each of two cohorts of subjects with BRAF V600E mutation-positive 
metastatic melanoma to the brain treated with oral dabrafenib. 
Results 
A total of 172 subjects with V600 mutation-positive melanoma (V600E mutation: 139 subjects; 
V600K mutation: 33 subjects) were enrolled into the study (Cohort A: 89; Cohort B: 83) by 24 
investigators in 6 countries. 
The majority of subjects were <65 years old (82%), 70 % of the subjects were male, and all 
subjects were white. The majority of subjects (81%) across both cohorts had V600E 
mutation-positive melanoma, and slightly more than half (54%) had lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 
>upper limit of normal (ULN) at baseline. 
As of the clinical data cut-off date, 119 subjects had discontinued study treatment (Cohort A: 71%; 
Cohort B: 67%). The primary reason for discontinuation was disease progression (Cohort A: 69%; 
Cohort B: 55%). Overall, 14 (8%) subjects had withdrawn from the study. The most frequent 
reason for study withdrawal was withdrawal of consent. 
The key efficacy data is presented in Table 23.

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  BREAK-3  pivotal  study  was  appropriately  designed  with  respect  to  patient  population, 
comparator and study endpoints. There were no conventional dose-finding trials, but the rational 
for the selected dose is endorsed. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Results from the pivotal study revealed a median PFS of 5.1 months for the dabrafenib group and 
2.7 months for the DTIC group (HR: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.53; p<0.0001).  The benefit in PFS was 
much more pronounced in an updated analysis (cut-off of 25 June 2012), showing a median PFS of 
6.9 months for the dabrafenib group versus 2.7 months for the DTIC group (HR=0.37; 95% CI: 
0.24, 0.58; p<0.0001).   
The analysis of ORR (CR+PR) further supported the PFS data as there was a difference in ORR of 
35% in favour of dabrafenib compared to DTIC (95 % CI: 20.9, 48.7). In the updated OS analysis 
a trend in favour of dabrafenib is shown (HR=0.76, 95% CI: 0.48, 1.21). 
Evaluation  of  Quality  of  life  and  patient  reported  outcome  data  did  not  give  clear  indications  of 
improvement with dabrafenib over DTIC overall, although on certain items dabrafenib produced 
better  results  than  DTIC.  In  an  open  label  trial  evaluation  of  QoL  data  may  be  confounded  by 
investigators  and  patients  bias.  Consequently,  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  QoL  assessment  is 
considered limited.

The  two  phase  II  studies  provided  additional  support  concerning  the  anti-tumour  effect  of 
dabrafenib in subjects with BRAF V600 mutation: In BREAK-2, median PFS for subjects with BRAF 
V600E mutation was 6.3 months (95 % CI: 4.6, 7.7), and confirmed objective response was 59% 
(95 % CI: 48.2, 70.3). For subjects with BRAF V600K mutation median PFS was 4.5 months (95 % 
CI: 2.6, 6.2) and confirmed ORR was 13% (95 % CI: 0, 28.7). In BREAK-MB, the overall response 
rate in patients with BRAF V600E metastatic melanoma was 38 % (95 % CI: 26.8, 49.9) and 31% 
(95 5CI: 19.9, 43.4) for locally non-pretreated and pretreated patients, respectively. In patients 
with BRAF V600K mutation positive metastatic melanoma the response rate was 0 (95 % CI: 0, 
21.8)  and  28 %  (95 %  CI:  9.7,  53.5)  for  locally  non-pretreated  and  pretreated  patients, 
respectively. 
Patients with melanoma driven by BRAF mutations other than V600E were excluded from the 
confirmatory trial however based on the results from the supportive studies dabrafenid inhibited 
also BRAF with mutation V600K as well although the activity appears lower than in V600E tumours. 
Therefore, the CHMP concluded that there was enough evidence to support a broader indication of 
“V600 mutation” and not to restrict the indication to BRAF V600E patient population.  
It is important to note that there appears to be no benefit in patients which are BRAF WT. This is 
reflected in the SmPC under section 4.2:  “The efficacy and safety of dabrafenib have not been 
established in patients with wild-type BRAF melanoma therefore dabrafenib should not be used in 
patients with BRAF wild-type melanoma’’ and under section 5.1 of the SmPC where it is stated that 
‘‘Before  taking  dabrafenib,  patients  must  have  BRAF  V600  mutation-positive  tumour  status 
confirmed by a validated test. In the Phase II and III clinical trials, screening for eligibility required 
central testing for BRAF V600 mutation using a BRAF mutation assay conducted on the most recent 
tumour  sample  available.  Primary  tumour  or  tumour  from  a  metastatic  site  was  tested  with  an 
investigational use only assay (IUO). The IUO is an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
assay performed on DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour tissue. 
The assay was specifically designed to differentiate between the V600E and V600K mutations. Only 
subjects with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation positive tumors were eligible for study participation. 
Subsequently, all patient samples were re-tested using the bioMerieux (bMx) THxID BRAF validated 
assay, which has CE marking. The bMx THxID BRAF assay is an allele-specific PCR performed on 
DNA extracted from FFPE tumour tissue. The assay was designed to detect the BRAF V600E and 
V600K mutations with high sensitivity (down to 5 % V600E and V600K sequence in a background of 
wild-type sequence using DNA extracted from FFPE tissue). Non-clinical and clinical studies with 
retrospective bi-directional Sanger sequencing analyses have shown that the test also detects the 
less  common  BRAF  V600D  mutation  and  V600E/K601E  mutation  with  lower  sensitivity.  Of  the 
specimens from the non-clinical and clinical studies (n = 876) that were mutation positive by the

2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In conclusion, a clinically relevant effect of dabrafenib has been shown in the patients with 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation. Regarding the primary endpoint 
PFS, the magnitude of the observed effect (HR=0.37) is considered clinically significant.  Secondary 
efficacy endpoints also consistently showed antitumoral activity of clinical relevance of dafrafenib in 
this patient population. The PFS results were very consistent and robust in all sensitivity and 
subgroup analyses to support on overall favourable conclusion.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety analyses are based on data from an integrated safety population of 578 subjects with 
melanoma, treated with 150 mg BID dabrafenib monotherapy. The integrated safety population is 
merged from five clinical studies:  one pivotal phase 3 (BREAK-3) and four supportive studies 
(BREAK 2, BREAK-MB, BRF-113220 and BRF-112680). In addition, serious adverse events (SAEs) 
were evaluated across the five clinical studies, as well as studies BRF113771, BRF115252, 
BRF113928 and BRF114144.

Certain  AEs  which  were  identified  as  events  of  special  interest  because  of  their  presumed 
relationship to BRAF- or other kinase inhibitors observed in clinical or preclinical studies, or due to 
the discovery of these AEs in early studies of dabrafenib are described in some detail below. 
Pyrexia  
Pyrexia was reported in 28% of the patients in the pivotal study and in 27% in the integrated safety 
population; the events occurred rather early (median 3 weeks) and lasted less than 5 days. Most of 
the events were considered drug-related (64%). Six per cent of the events were grade 3 (no grade 
4), and 98% of the events were resolved. Thirty-four per cent of patients reported with pyrexia 
required dose interruption, and 16% needed dose reduction. 
In  1 %  of  patients  in  clinical  trials,  serious  non-infectious  febrile  events  were  defined  as  fever 
accompanied  by  severe  rigors,  dehydration,  hypotension  and/or  acute  renal  insufficiency  or 
pre-renal  origin  in  subjects  with  normal  baseline  renal  function.  The  onset  of  these  serious 
non-infectious febrile events was typically within the first month of therapy. Patients with serious 
non-infectious  febrile  events  responded  well  to  dose  interruption  and/or  dose  reduction  and 
supportive care.

Cutaneous SCC and keratoacanthomas 
In the integrated safety population a total of 52 (9%) of the subjects had a total of 89 events of 
cutaneous  squamous  cell  carcinomas  (cuSCC),  Bowen´s  disease  (“squamous  cell  carcinoma  in 
situ”)  or  keratoacanthoma.  Approximately  70%  of  events  occurred  within  the  first  12 weeks  of 
treatment with a median time to onset of 8 weeks. Ninety-six per cent of patients who developed 
cuSCC continued on treatment without dose modification. 
Treatment-emergent malignancies 
Three subjects with non-epithelial treatment-emergent malignancies (mycosis fungoides, AML, and 
myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS]) were identified. There was a reasonable possibility that the 
mycosis fungoides may have been caused by dabrafenib. Both AML and MDS have been assessed by 
the investigator as unrelated to dabrafenib.  
Basal cell carcinoma was reported in five patients (3%) in the pivotal study and in 13 subjects of the 
integrated safety population. 
Renal failure  
Overall,  four  subjects  (<1%)  in  the  integrated  dabrafenib  safety  population  experienced  AEs  of 
renal failure. Two subjects had events reported as serious. One SAE was considered related to study 
treatment. Three of the four events occurred during the first 12 weeks of treatment (median time 
to onset was five weeks). All events were managed with dabrafenib dose-modification. Observed 
cases  were  generally  associated  with  pyrexia  and  dehydration.    No  cases  of  renal  failure  were 
reported  in  the  pivotal  study.  Renal  failure  due  to  pyrexia-associated  pre-renal  azotaemia  or 
granulomatous nephritis was uncommon. In the pooled dabrafenib population, 6% subjects across 
studies experienced at least one increase in serum creatinine as compared with baseline, which was 
similar to the incidence in the pivotal study.  
Uveitis/Iritis 
Uveitis/Iritis has been reported in five cases in the integrated safety population (one case of iritis 
and  4  cases  of  uveitis).  Four  of  the  cases  were  considered  related  to  study  treatment  by  the 
investigator. The cases were manageable without permanent discontinuation of dabrafenib. In the 
pivotal study one case of iritis was reported. In total, eye disorders were reported in 9% of the 
patients in the integrated safety population, the most common events except uveitis were vision 
blurred (14 cases), dry eye (7 cases) and ocular hyperaemia (5 cases). 
Neutropenia 
In the integrated safety population, a total of six subjects (1%) experienced Grade 3 or Grade 4 
events of neutropenia. Five of these were considered study drug-related by the investigator, and all 
events were reported as resolved at study cut-off.    All events were confounded by prior and/or 
concurrent  treatment  with  other  drugs  known  to  cause  neutropenia.  None  of  the  events  were 
associated  with  febrile  neutropenia.  Two  subjects  had  pancytopenia  attributable  to  multiple 
ethiologies. Neutropenia was a common AE on DTIC, reported for 17% of subjects overall, and the 
majority of these cases (8 out of 10 subjects) were high-grade events.

Testicular toxicity  
Testicular toxicity was identified in preclinical studies characterized by seminferous tubule 
degeneration, spermatid depletion/retention and observed below human exposure. Two events of 
testicular pain and one case of testicular swelling were reported out of in total 30 events of 
“Reproductive system and breast disorders”. The most common reproductive events were 
menstrual irregularities, furthermore two cases of galactorrea/breast discharge and two cases of 
benign prostate hyperplasia were reported. 
Pancreatitis  
Two cases of pancreatitis were reported in the integrated safety population.  
Cardiac events 
Due  to  preclinical  data  of  potential  cardiac  valve  abnormalities  caused  by  dabrafenib,  ECG 
surveillance was performed in all clinical studies. Valvular abnormalities were therefore monitored 
as AEs of special interest. Cardiac abnormalities including valvular disorders were reported in total 
10% in the pivotal study.  Two cases of mitral valve incompetence, one case of mitral valve disease 
and one case of tricuspid valve disease was reported in three patients. One case was a worsening of 
previously existing valvular disease. In two cases the investigators considered a relationship with 
dabrafenib. In total cardiac disorders were reported in  8% of the patients in the integrated safety 
population,  the  most  common  events  being    tachycardia  (2%)  atrial  fibrillation  (2%)  and  
palpitations (2%).  
Abnormal ejection fraction 
In BREAK-3 an absolute reduction in LVEF of at least 10% from baseline and below the lower limit 
of normal (LLN), was observed in 2% of the subjects. In the DTIC arm no subjects were registered 
with these values. 
In the integrated safety population a total of 6 (1%) of the patients were observed with a decreased 
LVEF.  All these cases were Grade 2 in severity, except for one Grade 3 event in a subject with 
baseline ischemia and cardiomyopathy who did not meet protocol eligibility criteria. 
Arthralgia 
Arthralgia was reported very commonly in clinical trials with dabrafenib (25 %). These cases were 
mainly grade 1 and 2 in severity with grade 3 occurred uncommonly (< 1 %) and no grade 4 
occurrences were reported. 
QT-interval 
In  the  Break-3  study  no  subjects  in  either  arm  had  a  QTcB  value  greater  than  500  msec.  Six 
subjects (4%) in the dabrafenib arm and two subjects (5%) in the DTIC arm had a post baseline 
QTcB value greater than 480 msec, but less than 500 msec.   
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/242419/2013 
Page 75/95 
 
  
  
 
Most subjects in the integrated safety population (74%) maintained a machine-read QTcB <450 ms 
during study participation. Increases to >480 ms occurred in 2% of the subjects. One subject in the 
integrated  safety  population  experienced  a  QTcB > 500 ms.  Three  subjects  (2%)  in  the 
dabrafenib-arm  and  one  subject  (3%)  in  the  DTIC-arm  had  a  change  from  baseline  in  QTcB  of 
greater than 60 msec. The subjects in the dabrafenib arm with a change from baseline in QTcB of 
greater  than  60  msec  had  a  baseline  QTcB  less  than  400  msec  at  baseline  and  did  not  have  a 
post-baseline QTcB exceeding 480 msec.  Across dabrafenib studies, subjects who experienced an 
increase in QTcB of 31 to 60 ms or >60 ms were 16% and 3%, respectively.  
Based  on  an  exposure-QTc  analysis  performed  with  data  from  the  FTIH  study  BRF112680, 
dabrafenib concentrations showed no apparent potential to alter the manually read QTc interval. A 
similar exposure analysis with metabolite concentrations showed a positive slope with a maximum 
change  in  population-corrected  QTc  of  ≤5.5 msec  at  the  mean  maximum  observed  plasma 
concentration (Cmax) observed with 150 mg or 300 mg BID dabrafenib. 
Hypophosphataemia 
Hypophosphataemia has been reported commonly in clinical trials with dabrafenib (7%). 
Approximately half of these (4%) occurrences were Grade 3 in severity. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
At the time of clinical data cut-off for BREAK-3, 21 subjects (11%) randomized to dabrafenib and 9 
subjects (15%) randomized to DTIC had died (Table 30).  
All  deaths  were  attributed  to  the  disease  under  study,  with  the  exception  of  one  death  in  the 
dabrafenib arm in the BREAK-3 study and four deaths in the integrated safety population.

Laboratory findings 
In the pivotal study more haematologic abnormalities were reported in the DTIC group than in the 
dabrafenib group. In the dabrafenib group there was one patient (<1%) with grade 4 lymphopenia, 
6 patients (3%) with lymphopenia grade 3 and one patient (<1%) with grade 3 neutropenia. In the 
integrated safety population the frequencies was slightly higher than in the pivotal study.  
Neutropenia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia all occurred at a greater frequency and severity in 
DTIC-treated subjects as compared with those receiving dabrafenib (both in BREAK-3 and across 
dabrafenib studies). Febrile neutropenia was reported as an AE only in DTIC-treated subjects. 
The most common laboratory finding in the pivotal study were as follows: hyperglycemia in 50% of 
the patients (grade 3 in 12 patients [6%]), hypophosphatemia in 37% of the patients (grade 3 in 10 
patients [5%], grade 4 in one patient) increase in alkaline phosphatase in 19% of the patients (no 
grade 3-4), increase in ALT in 11% of the patients (grade 3 in 2 patients [1%], no grade 4), increase 
in AST in 8% of the patients (grade 3 in 1 patients [<1%], no grade 4), and hyponatremia in 8% of 
the patients (grade 3 in 4 patients [2%], no grade 4). In the integrated safety population the results 
were similar (hyperglycemia 48%, hypophospatemia 35%, ALP 22%, ALT 16%, AST 13%. The 
findings were similar in the DTIC with regards to hyperglycemia (43%) and increase in AST (8%) 
but with regards to hypophosphatemia the incidence was lower (14%) and for ALT the incidence 
was higher (22%). There were no cases fulfilling criteria for Hy´s law in either the pivotal study or 
in the integrated safety population. 
A summary of worse-case on-therapy increases in machine-read corrected QT interval on 
electrocardiogram with Bazett’s correction (QTcB) was performed using data from BREAK-3, 
BREAK-MB, and BREAK-2. No instance of QTcB >500 ms was observed and the proportion of 
subjects with QTcB prolongation of >60 ms was 3% in this safety population. An increase in QTcB 
of 31 – 60ms was observed in 16% of the patients. Furthermore in one subject in the FTIH study 
who received a total daily dose on of 900 mg by mistake a QTcF of 505 ms was reported. One case 
with QT >500 ms was noted in the safety update. 
Safety in special populations 
AEs  reported  more  frequently  in  older  subjects  (≥65)  as  compared  with  younger  (<65)  were 
hyperkeratosis (34% vs. 27%), fatigue (30% vs. 23%), skin papilloma (29% vs. 17%), chills (21% 
vs. 9%), constipation (16% vs. 7%), seborrheic keratosis (15% vs. 5%), peripheral oedema (13% 
vs. 5%), actinic keratosis (12% vs. 6%), weight decreased (10% vs. 4%), and dyspnoea (9% vs. 
4%). Conversely, an increased frequency of alopecia (21% vs. 14%) and PPE syndrome (15% vs. 
9%) were reported in subjects <65 years old as compared with ≥65 (data not shown). Thirty two 
subjects in the integrated safety population were ≥75 years old and only 3 subjects were >85 years 
old.  Based on these numbers, limited safety conclusions can be drawn.  
No important gender–related safety differences were detected in the integrated safety population. 
Overall, rates of AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to dose modifications were similar in both male and 
female  subgroups.  The  frequency  of  Grade  3  and  Grade  4  events  was  also  similar  between 
subgroups. There were 4 (2%) fatal SAEs in females and 1 (<1%) in males.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
There were no safety studies submitted for drug-drug interaction. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Five patients (3%) in the pivotal study and 10 patients (2%) in the integrated safety population had 
AEs leading to permanent discontinuations.

Not applicable. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The median treatment duration in patients receiving dabrafenib was 4.9 months in the pivotal 
BREAK-3 study, whereas median treatment duration was 4.6 months across all studies. Although 4 
patients in the integrated safety population were treated for more than one year, the data from 
patients using dabrafenib over a prolonged period is limited. Based on this, “long term safety’’ 
included as missing information in the RMP and cumulative annual safety listings and analyses will 
be provided by the applicant. 
The most frequently occurring ADRs (≥ 15 %) reported with dabrafenib were hyperkeratosis, 
headache, pyrexia, arthralgia, fatigue, nausea, papilloma, alopecia, rash and vomiting. 
The majority of the adverse events were of grade 1-2, the dose intensity is high, about 95%, and 
only 5 patients (3%) in the pivotal study and 10 patients (2%) in the integrated safety population 
discontinued treatment due to side effects indicating the treatment is tolerable in this setting.  
The most frequent SAEs in the dabrafenib group were cutaneous SCC (6%) and pyrexia (5 %). A 
total of 5 subjects in the integrated dabrafenib safety population experienced a Grade 5 SAE, none 
of which were attributed to study treatment.  
Pyrexia and PPES were two of the most common reasons for dose reductions/interruptions however 
neither pyrexia nor PPES led to definitive treatment discontinuations. The onset of these serious 
non-infectious febrile events was typically within the first month of therapy. There are different 
proposed mechanisms for pyrexia including CNS thermoregulation via PGE2, activation of 
inflammation via TLR, and cytokine increase which is the currently plausible mechanism. Patients 
with serious non-infectious febrile events responded well to dose interruption and/or dose reduction 
and supportive care. A relevant precaution was included in section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
Squamous epithelial carcinoma was reported in 6% and keratoacanthoma in 3% of the patients 
treated with dabrafenib arm in the pivotal study compared to no cases in the dacarbazine arm, skin 
neoplasms (squamous epithelial carcinoma (6%) and malignant melanomas (2%) were also 
reported as some the most common SAEs. Basal cell carcinomas were reported in 3% of the 
dabrafenib treated patients in the pivotal study compared to no DTIC treated patients. However 
these events did not lead to permanent treatment discontinuations. With examinations that could 
lead to excisions, these events are manageable. Relevant Information was included in the SmPC. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/242419/2013

There is a biological mechanism described in BRAF inhibition with a paradoxical RAS activation that 
can lead to an increase in squamous epithelial malignancies, this is relevant both in cutaneous 
squamous epithelial carcinomas but also for non-skin squamous epithelial carcinomas. There are 
indications that other malignancies such as malignant melanocytic tumours and also chronic 
myeloid leukaemias may also show accelerated growth. Cases of RAS-associated malignancies 
have been reported, both with another BRAF inhibitor (Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and 
non-cutaneous SCC of the head and neck) and with dabrafenib when administered in combination 
with the MEK inhibitor, trametinib (colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer). Further information will be 
collected in the adjuvant study BRF115532 (a phase III randomized double blinded study of 
dabrafenib in combination with trametinib versus two placebos in the adjuvant treatment of 
high-risk BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma after surgical resection).  A Phase III, 
randomized, double-blinded study comparing the combination of the BRAF inhibitor, dabrafenib and 
the MEK inhibitor, trametinib to dabrafenib and placebo as first-line therapy in subjects with 
unresectable (Stage IIIC) or metastatic (Stage IV) BRAF V600E/K mutationpositive cutaneous 
melanoma will also address this specific safety issue.  Appropriate wording in section 4.4 of the 
SmPC has been implemented. 
New primary melanomas have been reported in clinical trials with dabrafenib. Cases were managed 
with excision and did not require treatment modification. Monitoring for skin lesions should occur as 
described for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. 
The majority of cardiac events were reported in dabrafenib and not in DTIC treated patients. The 
imbalance in the group size and the length of treatment could be an explanation however as there 
also are preclinical findings this should be further addressed. Furthermore the impact of dabrafenib 
in reduced cardiac function is unkown as these patients were excluded from the studies. An ongoing 
QTc study (BRF113773) designed to evaluate the effect of repeat oral dosing of dabrafenib on 
cardiac repolarization in subjects with solid tumours will elucidate the risk of QTc prolongation. The 
study is included in the RMP and a relevant precaution was included in section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
Renal failure due to causes other than pyrexia-associated pre-renal azotaemia (e.g. granulomatous 
nephritis) was uncommon; however dabrafenib has not been studied in patients with baseline renal 
insufficiency. Caution should be used in this setting (see SmPC section 4.8). 
Five cases of uveitis/iritis were reported in the integrated safety population (one case of iritis and 4 
cases of uveitis). Patients should be routinely monitored for visual signs and symptoms (such as, 
change in vision, photophobia and eye pain) while on therapy (see SmPC section 4.4). 
The prevalence of photo-sensitivity in the dabrafenib safety population is low (2% overall) and the 
safety database is still small. Therefore a clinical relevance cannot be ruled out. However there are 
preclinical signs and due to the severity of this condition (patients may get burned in daylight) 
photosensitivity has been added as a potential risk in the RMP. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in 
the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
In total 125 patients in the integrated safety population were aged 65 or more, this is about 20% of 
the population about 6% were older than 75 years. About 40% were women in the integrated safety 
population.  No major differences with regards to sex or age were detected. Dabrafenib has been 
studied almost exclusively in Caucasians, consequently the information regarding safety in other 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/242419/2013 
Page 81/95 
 
  
  
 
populations is very limited. “Non-White population” has been included as missing information in the 
RMP. 
There is no specific treatment for an overdose of dabrafenib. If overdose occurs, the patient should 
be treated supportively with appropriate monitoring as necessary (see SmPC section 4.9). 
Dabrafenib has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. The clinical status of the 
patient and the adverse reaction profile of dabrafenib should be borne in mind when considering the 
patient's ability to perform tasks that require judgement, motor or cognitive skills. Patients should 
be made aware of the potential for fatigue and eye problems to affect these activities (see SmPC 
section 4.7). 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
In summary, the safety profile of dabrafenib seems consistent across the pooled safety population. 
The overall toxicity profile of dabrafenib seems acceptable and SAEs known to be related to 
dabrafenib treatment are mostly manageable.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
One pivotal trial (BREAK-3) was submitted in support of the efficacy of dabrafenib therapy in 
patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation. The superiority of 
darbafenib over DTIC was convincingly demonstrated in terms of the primary endpoint progression 
free survival.  Median PFS was 6.9 months in the dabrafenib group and 2.7 months in the DTIC 
group (HR 0.37).This effect was further substantiated by results in the secondary efficacy endpoints: 
overall response rate was significantly greater in dabrafenib treated patients compared to the DTIC 
group (59% vs. 24%) and in the updated OS analysis a trend in favour of dabrafenib is shown 
(HR=0.76, 95% CI: 0.48, 1.21). 
The two phase II studies provided additional support concerning the anti-tumour effect of 
dabrafenib in subjects with BRAF V600 mutation: In BREAK-2, confirmed objective response was 
59% and 13% for subjects with BRAF V600E and BRAF V600K mutation, respectively. In 
BREAK-MB, the overall response rate in patients with BRAF V600E metastatic melanoma was 38 % 
and 31% for locally non-pretreated and pretreated patients, respectively. In patients with BRAF 
V600K mutation positive metastatic melanoma the response rate was 28 % for pre-treated 
patients. 
With respect to assays used for the detection of V600 mutations during drug development, 
sufficient data have been submitted to support the credibility of assay results, this also in relation 
to the CE marked THxID BRAF assay. 
Treatment effect on PFS was consistently favourable across all subgroups (number of metastatic 
disease sites, ECOG PS, visceral disease; baseline lactate dehydrogenase; sex and disease stage).  
The efficacy results in terms of PFS and ORR are similar to the authorized vemurafenib (BRAF V600 
inhibitor) based on indirect comparisons. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Patients with melanoma driven by BRAF mutations other than V600E were excluded from the 
confirmatory trial and with respect to patients with the 600K mutation in single arm studies the 
activity appears lower than in V600E tumours. This has been reflected adequately in section 5.1 of 
the SmPC. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The most common events were hyperkeratosis, headache, pyrexia, arthralgia, fatigue, nausea, 
papilloma, alopecia, rash and vomiting. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/242419/2013 
Page 92/95 
 
  
  
 
About 10% of all patients developed cutaneous squamous epithelial cell carcinoma, 
keratoacanthoma and Bowen´s disease which both are low grade squamous epithelial carcinomas. 
There could also a risk for other solid and haematologic malignancies; two cases with verified RAS 
mutations are reported. The most frequent SAEs in the dabrafenib group were cutaneous SCC (8%) 
and pyrexia (5%). A total of 5 subjects in the integrated dabrafenib safety population experienced 
a Grade 5 SAE, none of which were attributed to study treatment. There are uncommon adverse 
events that are of concern such as uveitis/ iritis, pancreatitis, panniculitis and renal failure. The 
majority of these events also seem to be class related. 
Dabrafenib is a strong inducer of drug-metabolising enzymes. It may therefore decrease the plasma 
concentrations and thereby potentially the efficacy of many medicines. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Long term data is missing, with regards to other squamous epithelial and other malignancies apart 
from cutaneous SCC. Since a mechanism of paradoxical RAS activation is identified and there are 
clinical reports of both solid tumours and haematologic malignancies further information and 
follow-up on long-term treatment is needed in general, but for malignancies in particular.  This 
additional information to be provided is included in the RMP and appropriate wording has been 
implemented in section 4.4 of the SmPC. Furthermore there are two on-going studies to address 
this safety issue and cumulative semi-annual reports for non-cutaneous malignancies will be 
provided by the applicant.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The pivotal study has shown a clinically relevant effect of dabrafenib for PFS and thus, a clinical 
benefit has been convincingly demonstrated. The CHMP considers that the clinical benefit is 
relevant to the proposed indication. 
The adverse events reported were adequately described and were considered acceptable. 
Cutaneous squamous epithelial malignancies are clinically manageable, other events of concern 
although relatively uncommon like pancreatitis and renal failure could be managed with relevant 
pharmacovigilance measures to limit the clinical effects. The possible increase of other 
malignancies will be followed in clinical studies and safety updates. The overall toxicity profile of 
dabrafenib seems acceptable and SAEs known to be related to dabrafenib treatment are mostly 
manageable. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Overall, the efficacy of dabrafenib has been demonstrated. The adverse event profile of dabrafenib 
seems acceptable and generally manageable. The benefit-risk balance for dabrafenib for the 
treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation is considered 
positive. The favourable effects outweigh the negative effects of Tafinlar.

4.  Recommendations 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Tafinlar in the treatment of unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of 
the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (See Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Conditions and requirements of the Marketing Authorisation  
• 
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this 
product within 6 months following authorisation. Subsequently, the marketing authorisation 
holder shall submit periodic safety update reports for this product in accordance with the 
requirements set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 
107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal 
product 
• 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required  pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in 
the  agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed  
subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
• 
•

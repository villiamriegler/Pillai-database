SmPC, 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
Labelling and 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
PL 
Amglidia in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity.

Update of section 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC to 
04/07/2019 
03/09/2019 
SmPC and PL 
Update based on recently published literature, the ISPAD 
reconcile posology instructions with the actual use of 
the product in clinical practice in order to avoid 
overdosing, to harmonise sections related to “Dosage 
adjustments and long-term treatment management” 
and remove reference to the off-label use of crushed 
tablets. This update is based on recently published 
literature, the ISPAD consensus guideline, and in line 
with the NEOGLI CSR. 
In addition, the applicant took the opportunity to 
make editorial corrections. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
consensus guideline, and in line with the NEOGLI Clinical 
Study Report.  
The SmPC section 4.2 has been updated to reconcile 
posology instructions with the actual use of the product in 
clinical practice and to improve clarity and readability. The 
segment “Dosage adjustments and long-term 
management” is initiated by a new paragraph summarising 
information on observed average daily doses. In the 
recommendation for blood glucose and HbA1c monitoring 
after insulin discontinuation it was added that, once insulin 
independence is achieved and steady state of glibenclamide 
is reached, capillary blood glucose does no longer need to 
be daily monitored except in clinical situations at risk of 
metabolic unbalance. In all cases, HbA1c must be 
monitored every three months. Reference to the off-label 
use of crushed tablets was removed.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The  applicant  Celgene  Europe  BV  (*)  submitted  on  29  June  2020  an  application  for  marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Breyanzi, through the centralised procedure 
falling within the Article 3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the 
centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 15 December 2016. 
Breyanzi, was designated as an orphan medicinal product: 
• 
• 
• 
EU/3/17/1890  on  17  Jul  2017  in  the  following  condition:  Treatment  of  diffuse  large  B-cell 
lymphoma 
EU/3/18/2018 on 25 May 2018 in the following condition: Treatment of follicular lymphoma 
EU/3/18/2099  on  19  Nov  2018  in  the  following  condition:  Treatment  of  primary  mediastinal 
large-B-cell lymphoma. 
Following  the  CHMP  positive  opinion on this  marketing  authorisation  and  at the  time  of  review  of  the 
orphan  designations  by  the  Committee  for  Orphan  Medicinal  Products  (COMP),  this  product  was 
withdrawn from the Community Register of designated orphan medicinal products on 20 February 2022 
on request of the sponsor. The relevant orphan designations withdrawal assessment report can be found 
under 
the 
‘Assessment 
history’ 
tab 
on 
the 
Agency’s 
website: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/breyanzi 
The applicant applied for the following indication: Breyanzi is indicated for the treatment of adult patients 
with  relapsed  or  refractory  large  B-cell  lymphoma  including  diffuse  large  B-cell  lymphoma  (DLBCL), 
primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) and follicular lymphoma grade 3B (FL3B) after at 
least two prior therapies. 
(*)  during the procedure the  applicant  has  changed from  Celgene  Europe  BV  to  Bristol-Myers  Squibb 
Pharma EEIG. Relevant documents for the change of applicant have been provided, validated and agreed. 
1.2.  Legal basis, dossier content 
The legal basis for this application refers to: 
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated that 
the following two active substances, which are covered by the single INN lisocabtagene maraleucel, were 
to be considered new active substances: 
•  CD19-directed genetically modified autologous cell-based product consisting of purified CD8+ T 
cells (“CD8+ cells”) 
•  CD19-directed genetically modified autologous cell-based product consisting of purified CD4+ T 
cells (“CD4+ cells”) 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical 
and  clinical  data  based  on  applicants’  own  tests  and  studies  and/or  bibliographic  literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies) 
Breyanzi is presented as a combination pack of two separate pharmaceutical forms, each with a different 
active  substance  (CD8+  cells,  CD4+  cells).  The  two  individual  active  substances  act  as  the  different 
components  of  the  medicinal  product  (henceforth  referred  as  CD4+  cell  component  and  CD8+  cell 
component). Further details on the qualitative and quantitative composition of the product can be found 
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022  
Page 10/252 
 
 
 
 
in the quality section of this report. 
1.3.  Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) PIP 
(P/0198/2019) on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At  the  time  of  submission  of  the  application,  the  PIP  (P/0198/2019)  was  not  yet  completed  as  some 
measures were deferred 
1.4.  Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
1.4.1.  Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products. 
1.5.  Applicant’s request(s) for consideration 
1.5.1.  Accelerated assessment 
The applicant requested accelerated assessment in accordance to Article 14 (9) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004. 
1.5.2.  New active substance status 
The applicant requested the two active substances described above, which are covered by the single INN 
lisocabtagene maraleucel and contained in the above medicinal product, to be considered as new active 
substances,  as  the  applicant  claims  that  they  are  not  a  constituent  of  a  medicinal  product  previously 
authorised within the European Union. 
1.6.  PRIME 
Breyanzi  was  granted  eligibility  to  PRIME  on  15  Dec  2016  in  the  following  indication:  treatment  of 
relapsed / refractory aggressive large B-cell Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL). 
Eligibility to PRIME was granted at the time in view of the following: 
•  Based on the discussion and data presented by the applicant, the request for PRIME was considered 
for the population for which data has been presented, ie relapsed / refractory diffuse large  B-cell 
lymphoma (DLBCL). 
•  Despite overall improvement in DLBCL outcomes after frontline therapy with R-CHOP, approximately 
30-40% of patients will not respond to initial therapy or will eventually relapse and the unmet medical 
need in DLBCL is therefore agreed. 
• 
The proposed mechanism of action of CAR T cells and presented in vitro and in vivo data are relevant 
and supportive. 
•  Clinical results available to date showed high ORR of 85% (17/20), a CR rate of 55% (11/20), and 
a  PR  rate  of  30%  (6/20).  These  results  are  further  supported  by  follow-up  data  (3  months  in  8 
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022  
Page 11/252 
 
 
 
patients and >6 months in 3 patients). The most significant toxicities observed in adult subjects who 
have received CAR T cells have been cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity. 
A kick-off meeting was held on 18 Apr 2017. The objective of the meeting was to discuss the development 
programme  and  regulatory  strategy  for  the  product.  The  applicant  was  recommended  to  address  the 
following key issues through relevant regulatory procedures:  
Points  for  future  CHMP  Scientific  Advice:  Include  discussion  on  the  development  options  and 
differentiation (e.g. non-similarity) aspects in using EGFRt for in vivo ablation of CAR-T cells. 
Points for future CHMP Scientific Advice: Include the ERA in MAA including free viral particles. 
Points 
for 
future  CHMP  Scientific  Advice:  Include  data  driven  evidence 
to  demonstrate 
benefit/differentiation  of  unique  defined  product  composition.  Discuss  data  collection  on  feasibility  of 
HSCT after CAR-T therapy with CAR-T as bridging treatment prior to allo-transplantation. 
• 
Planning of post-authorisation aspects: long-term follow-up: considerations on type of registry and 
possible challenges 
The Rapporteur reminded of the importance of long-term safety data in this hopefully curative setting 
and acknowledged the Company’s plans.  
The  Rapporteur  raised  concerns  on  the  planned  registry,  which  is  on  a  voluntary  basis  and  therefore 
cannot ensure that all patients would be enrolled. 
The Rapporteur recommended a common platform to be used by all CAR-T products that will be marketed 
to collect as much safety as possible and avoid loss of patient follow-up. 
EMA would like CAR-T sponsors to work together, and may host a joint meeting with sponsors in the 
future. 
Points  for  future  Rapporteur’s  discussion:  Include  the  pros  and  cons  for  LTFU  platform  across  CAR-T 
products and attendance at discussion forum for LTFU common platform. 
•  Historical  control:  need  for  inclusion  of  patients  representative  of  EU  setting  and  statistical 
considerations 
Overall proposal for systematic review is acceptable, however NICE guideline should be used and the 
following details would need to be discussed in Scientific Advice: 
•  Clarification on endpoints (ORR vs time to event) 
• 
For  time  to  event  endpoints,  different  starting  time  points  from  different  studies 
need to be taken into account in statistical analysis to ensure unbiased comparison 
•  Need  to  pre-specify  selection  of  covariates  for  the  propensity  score  model  to 
minimise bias (selection bias and information bias) 
•  Need to pre-specify analysis to avoid cherry picking. 
Recommendation was made to follow the NICE guidelines for indirect comparison. 
Points for future CHMP Scientific Advice: Include the systematic literature review process, methodology 
and pre-specify analyses as per the points mentioned above. 
Points  for  CHMP  Protocol  Assistance: Include  data-driven  evidence  to  demonstrate  non  similarity  and 
significant benefit.

1.7.  Scientific advice  
The  applicant  received  scientific  advice  on  the  development  relevant  for  the  indication  subject  to  the 
present application. 
The scientific advice pertained to the following quality, non-clinical and clinical aspects: 
-  The  lentiviral  vector  microbial  control  strategy  as  well  as  the  lentiviral  vector  comparability  plan  to 
demonstrate comparability between different vector suppliers; the change in analytical method for the 
enumeration of CAR expressing cells resulting in a change in the dose calculation; the proposed Process 
Performance  Qualification  strategy  to  demonstrate  process  control  and  consistency  of  the  finished 
product; 
-  the  proposed  data-driven  evidence  to  demonstrate  benefit/differentiation  of  unique  defined  product 
composition and non-similarity demonstration strategy; 
- the strategy for demonstrating comparability between the different versions of finished product; the 
proposed post-approval mycoplasma surveillance programme;   
-  the  process  characterisation  strategy  based  on  the  risk-based  approach;  the  approach  to  perform 
cellular composition characterisation of the leukapheresis material, and cellular composition and memory 
T-cell characterisation of the cryopreserved selected T-cells; the strategy to establish the commercial 
finished product specification based on the current potential critical quality attributes; the product and 
process-related impurities strategy; the manufacturing process performance qualification strategy; the 
viral safety testing strategies; 
- the adequacy of the nonclinical development package to support MAA; the non-similarity strategy and 
specifically the suitability of the non-clinical proof-of-concept study for the EGFRt structural component 
of JCAR017 to demonstrate non-similarity versus authorised products in the same indication; 
- the clinical pharmacology development plan; the justification for the target therapeutic dose, the clinical 
data package to provide robust evidence for the demonstration of a favourable benefit-risk for a full MA; 
the proposal to submit long-term findings regarding both safety and efficacy (at least 12 months) during 
the MAA procedure, and how to present the clinical data in the MAA dossier; 
- the data sources (Real World Evidence and Systematic Literature Review) for external control and the 
associated  statistical  analysis  methods  to  support  comparative  evidence  for  MA;  the  long-term  post-
marketing data collection strategy, i.e. through a post-approval study as part of the Risk Management 
Plan (RMP) and in line with EMA report on CAR T-cell therapy registries; 
- the clinical development plan in DLBCL, PMBCL and FL to support the discussion of significant benefit 
over existing therapies at the time of marketing authorisation, to maintain orphan status; 
- the designs of the pivotal studies TRANSCEND NHL-001 and TRANSCEND World to support a MAA, in 
particular, the inclusion/exclusion criteria, the clinical data and pooling strategy; the duration of follow 
up at time of MAA submission and during MAA review; the statistical approach for the historical control

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Breyanzi is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma (DLBCL), primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) and follicular lymphoma 
grade 3B (FL3B), after two or more lines of systemic therapy. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Non-Hodgkin lymphomas comprise a heterogeneous group of malignancies with several histological and 
molecular subtypes. Approximately 80% to 85% of all NHL cases are categorised as B-cell lymphomas, 
which include both aggressive (ie, rapidly growing) and indolent (ie, slow growing) forms. Diffuse large 
B-cell lymphomas represent the most common NHL subtype worldwide, accounting for at least 30% of 
all adult NHL cases (Chao, 2013) and 37% of B-cell lymphomas worldwide (Hunt, 2008; Martelli, 2013).  
Between 2011 and 2012, the annual age-adjusted incidence rates of DLBCL were between 3 to 4 per 
100,000  persons  in  Europe  and  6.9  per  100,000  persons  in  the  US  (Teras,  2016;  Tilly,  2015;  Sant, 
2010). Incidence varies by ethnicity, with Caucasian Americans having higher rates than Blacks, Asians, 
and  American  Indian  or  Alaska  Natives,  in  order  of  decreasing  incidence  (Morton,  2006;  Shirley  MH, 
2013).  The  incidence  of  DLBCL  is  known  to  increase  with  age,  with  approximately  half  of  all  cases 
occurring  in  adults  aged  ≥  65  years  (median  age  67  years)  (Howlader,  2019).  DLBCL  not  otherwise 
specified (NOS) can occur as de novo disease and can also arise as a transformation from other indolent 
forms of B-cell lymphoma including follicular lymphoma (FL), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), small 
lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia (WM), and marginal zone lymphoma 
(MZL).  
Relative  to  DLBCL,  other  large  B-cell  lymphoma  subtypes  are  less  common.  Primary  large  B  cell 
lymphoma of the mediastinum (PMBCL) and FL3B comprise 3% and 1% of all NHL cases, respectively 
Assessment report

(Mottok, 2019; Dreyling, 2016; NCCN, 2019; Salaverria, 2011; Swerdlow, 2016; Vitolo, 2016). These 
subtypes represent an important subgroup of the R/R large B-cell lymphoma population and are typically 
grouped with and treated in the same way as DLBCL. Estimated incidence in the EU is 3.8/100,000/year 
and is increasing with age (Sant, 2010; Tilly, 2015). 
Secondary CNS lymphoma refers to cases where there is secondary CNS involvement from DLBCL, 
which have an especially poor prognosis (Tilly, 2015). Secondary CNS lymphoma is an infrequent but 
almost always fatal complication of lymphomas. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features and pathogenesis 
The  molecular  pathogenesis  of  DLBCL  is  a  complex,  multistep  process  leading  to  the  replication  of  a 
malignant clone of germinal or post-germinal B cell origin. While some steps in this pathway have been 
elucidated, many remain unknown. 
•  DLBCL is a heterogeneous clinicopathologic entity that includes tumours derived from germinal 
centre B cells or post-germinal centre B cells (also called activated B cells); 
• 
• 
Tumour cells in DLBCL generally express pan B cell antigens (CD19, CD20, CD22, CD79a). The 
majority has genetic abnormalities, but there is no single cytogenetic change that is typical or 
diagnostic. 
The  majority  of  DLBCL  tumours  demonstrates  translocations  or  mutations  that  result  in  the 
increased expression of the B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) gene. Overexpression of BCL6 leads to 
downregulation of target genes, including the TP53 tumour suppressor gene, which prevents the 
cells from undergoing apoptosis in response to DNA damage; 
•  Up to 20% of DLBCL demonstrate mutations or deletions of the TP53 tumour suppressor gene. 
In addition, TP53 transcription is at least partially controlled by the BCL6 gene. Downregulation 
of TP53 expression or expression of mutant p53 products results in a loss of the normal growth-
limiting activities of this gene. Newer data suggest negative prognostic impact of p53 mutations 
or deletions in DLBCL (Schiefer, 2015). 
•  Other mechanisms important in the pathogenesis of a minority of DLBCL include aberrant somatic 
hypermutation, BCL2 activation, and MYC overexpression, evasion of host immunity, and altered 
tumour cell motility/trafficking; 
• 
Primary large B cell lymphoma of the mediastinum (PMBL) is a variant of DLBCL arising in the 
mediastinum from the thymic (medullary) B cell. The pathogenesis of PMBL is largely unknown, 
but may be more similar to that of classical Hodgkin lymphoma than that of DLBCL, and appears 
to involve activation of JAK-STAT and NF-KB signaling as well as acquisition of genetic lesions 
that allow the tumour cells to escape from immune surveillance. 
A specific high-risk group is High-Grade Lymphoma (HGL) with concurrent chromosomal 
rearrangements of MYC and the anti-apoptotic oncogene BCL2 and/or BCL6, referred to as double-hit 
lymphoma (DHL) or triple-hit lymphoma (THL). The 2016 revision of the WHO classification for 
lymphoma has included these lymphomas, which occur in <10% of cases of DLBCL, into a new 
category of lymphoma, termed HGL with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements (Swerdlow, 
2016). Double-hit lymphomas represent approximately 5% of de novo cases of DLBCL with very poor 
OS of ≤ 12 months when treated with R-CHOP (Camicia, 2015).

2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Patients  with  DLBCL  typically  present  with  a  rapidly  enlarging  symptomatic  mass,  most  usually  nodal 
enlargement in the neck or abdomen, or, in the case of primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma, the 
mediastinum,  but  may  present  as  a  mass  lesion  anywhere  in  the  body.  Extranodal  involvement  is 
common among those presenting with stage I/II disease [Hui D, 2010]. Systemic "B" symptoms (i.e., 
fever, weight loss, drenching night sweats) are observed in approximately 30 percent of patients, and 
the serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is elevated in over one-half (Armitage JO, 1998). Approximately 
60 percent of patients will present with advanced stage DLBCL (usually stage III or IV disease) while 40 
percent have more localised disease, usually defined as that which can be contained within one irradiation 
field (Armitage JO, 1998). The bone marrow is involved in up to 30 percent of cases, but may be of a 
discordant histologic type,  such  as  follicular  lymphoma  (Sehn  LH,  2011),  in  as  many  as  half  of  those 
cases. In up to 40 percent of cases, the disease arises in extranodal extramedullary tissues [Moller MB, 
2004]. The most common site of primary extranodal disease is the stomach/gastrointestinal tract, but 
the  disease  can  arise  in  virtually  any  tissue  (Alives A,  2002;  Munch-Petersen HD,  2015).  Conversely, 
primary  nodal  disease  may  secondarily  involve  the  liver,  kidneys,  lung,  bone  marrow,  and  central 
nervous  system.  DLBCL  also  can  be  locally  highly  invasive,  leading  to  compression  of  vessels  (eg, 
superior vena cava syndrome) or airways (eg, tracheo-bronchial compression), involvement of peripheral 
nerves, and destruction of bone (eg, cord compression), requiring urgent attention. DLBCL is an AIDS-
defining  malignancy.  When  compared  with  lymphoma  in  the  HIV-negative  population,  systemic 
lymphoma in the HIV-positive population has been associated with more frequent B symptoms (ie, fever, 
weight  loss,  night  sweats),  extranodal  disease,  involvement  of  unusual  locations  (eg,  body  cavity, 
rectum, soft tissue), and advanced stage at diagnosis. 
Pre-treatment  evaluation  determines  the  extent  of  the  disease  and  provides  information  about  the 
individual's comorbidities that are likely to affect treatment options. In addition to a history and physical 
examination, it is practice performing laboratory studies, unilateral bone marrow biopsy, and imaging 
(PET) in all patients. A molecular risk assessment should be performed in all cases to help determine 
prognosis  and  direct  therapy.  This  includes  both  an  evaluation  of  MYC,  BCL2,  and  BCL6  status  (by 
immunohistochemistry or fluorescence in situ hybridisation [FISH]) and an evaluation of cell of origin. 
Using this information, an individual case may be subclassified as one of the following: 
•  Germinal  centre  B  cell  (GCB)  DLBCL  –  Cases  with  GCB  DLBCL  without  MYC  and  BCL2  gene 
rearrangements. These patients have a relatively good prognosis following standard therapy with 
R-CHOP; 
•  Activated B cell (ABC) DLBCL or non-GCB DLBCL – Cases with non-GCB DLBCL, without double 
hit DLBCL, have high relapse rates and a poor prognosis following treatment with R-CHOP; 
•  Double hit DLBCL – Cases with MYC translocation plus gene rearrangement of BCL2, BCL6 (or 
both) have a poor prognosis with standard therapy; 
•  Double  expressor  DLBCL  –  There  are  limited  data  regarding  the  treatment  of  the  larger 
population  of  patients  with  double  expressor  DLBCL  (immunohistochemistry  identifies  co-
expression of MYC and BCL2, but gene rearrangements are not present or were not evaluated). 
2.1.5.  Management 
Following  current  standard  of  care  first-line  therapy  with  rituximab,  cyclophosphamide,  doxorubicin, 
vincristine,  prednisone  (R-CHOP)  immune-chemotherapy,  approximately  50%  to  60%  of  patients 
achieve a long-term response and will be cured of the disease (Tilly, 2015). The remainder of patients 
are either refractory to first-line treatment or relapse after a period of treatment response (Raut, 2014; 
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022  
Page 17/252 
 
 
 
Tilly, 2015). Early relapses (≤1 year) and late relapses (>5 years) may also occur, with incidence rates 
of 10-15 and 3%, respectively. The prognosis of patients with R/R DLBCL is poor, with a life expectancy 
of 12 months with currently available therapies; approximately 37% of DLBCL patients die within 5 years 
of  diagnosis  (Friedberg,  2011;  Howlader,  2019;  Raut,  2014).  High-dose  immunotherapy  followed  by 
autologous  stem  cell  transplantation  (ASCT) 
is  the  standard  treatment 
for  patients  with 
relapsed/refractory (RR) DLBCL that are <65 years and without major comorbidities; however, >60% of 
patients are ineligible for transplant, presenting a therapeutic challenge (Zhang J, 2018). The prognosis 
of  patients  who  fail  salvage  chemotherapy  and/or  ASCT  or  are  not  eligible  to  ASCT  due  to  age  or 
comorbidity, is unsatisfactory and durable responses with additional chemotherapy are anecdotical (Van 
Den Neste et al, 2017). 
Patients with large B-cell lymphoma whose disease progresses after 2 or more lines of systemic therapy 
are  unlikely  to  benefit  from  additional  chemoimmunotherapy  (Zelenetz,  2019).  A  variety  of 
chemotherapy-based and monoclonal antibody-based regimens have been explored as salvage regimens 
for patients with 3L+ large B-cell lymphoma, but none is considered standard of care. Regimens currently 
in use in this setting include rituximab alone or in combination with other agents, cytotoxic chemotherapy 
agents,  and  lenalidomide  (Chao,  2013).  In  a  study  of  the  most  commonly  used  salvage  regimens, 
bendamustine and rituximab (BR), in patients with R/R DLBCL after at least one prior therapy, an overall 
response  rate  (ORR)  of  45%  and  complete  response  (CR)  rate  of  15.5%  were  reported.  The  median 
duration of response (DOR) was 17.3 months and the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.6 
months (Vacirca, 2014). A retrospective analysis of pooled DLBCL patients whose disease was refractory 
to the last chemotherapy-containing regimen received, or relapsed within 12 months after auto-ASCT 
(SCHOLAR-1 study) demonstrated an ORR of 26%, a CR rate of 7%, and a median overall survival (OS) 
of 6.3 months (Crump, 2017). 
For  patients  who  have  chemoresistant  disease 
(i.e., 
inadequate 
response 
to  salvage 
chemoimmunotherapy)  or  relapse  after  autologous  transplant,  allogeneic  HCT  and  chimeric  antigen 
receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy are appropriate options. Allogeneic HCT can achieve durable responses 
but is associated with substantial treatment-related mortality and graft-versus-host disease. 
The  treatment  landscape  for  R/R  large  B-cell  lymphoma  recently  changed  with  the  marketing 
authorisation  of  2  CAR  T-cell  products,  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  (Yescarta®)  (Yescarta  Summary  of 
Product  Characteristics  [SmPC],  2020)  and  tisagenlecleucel  (Kymriah®)  (Kymriah  SmPC,  2020),  and 
conditional marketing authorisation of the CD79b-directed antibody-drug conjugate polatuzumab vedotin 
(Polivy™)  (Polivy  SmPC,  2020).  In  addition,  pixantrone  (Pixurvi®)  (Pixurvi  SmPC,  2020),  an 
anthraquinone-based  inhibitor  of  topoisomerase  II,  was  conditionally  authorised  initially  in  2012  then 
received  full  approval  in  2020  for  the  broad  indication  of  R/R  aggressive  B-cell  NHL.  CAR  T-cell 
treatments, in particular, have shown to induce long-lasting remissions in up to 30% - 50% of subjects, 
at the cost of a non-negligible toxicity (Locke, 2019; Schuster, 2019). However, the registrational studies 
for  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  and  tisagenlecleucel  did  not  allow  enrolment  of  patients  with  specific 
comorbidities  such  as  prior  allo-HSCT,  secondary  CNS  involvement  by  lymphoma,  and  reduced  renal 
function.  The  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  study  excluded  patients  with  an  immediate  need  for  anticancer 
therapy for disease control. Overall, these studies excluded patients who are part of a greater population 
with  unmet  medical  need.  Despite  these  new  products,  current  evidence  suggests  there  remains  a 
substantial unmet need for therapies that demonstrate a combination of compelling and durable efficacy 
with  favourable  safety  in  3L+  large  B-cell  lymphoma,  particularly  in  less  common  NHL  subtypes  (eg, 
PMBCL, DLBCL transformed from indolent lymphoma other than FL, and FL3B) and in other populations 
excluded or under-represented in the clinical studies of recently approved products. 
Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) is an aggressive B-cell lymphoma that represents 
2% to 3% of B-cell NHLs and 10% of LBCLs (Mottok, 2019; NCCN, 2019). It tends to occur in younger 
female  patients,  and  has  distinct  clinical  and  biological  presentations,  characterised  by  diffuse 
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022  
Page 18/252 
 
 
 
proliferation  of  medium  to  large  B-cells  associated with  sclerosis  (Liu,  2016;  Martelli,  2017).  Patients 
with PMBCL who do not respond to first-line therapy are treated similarly to those with R/R DLBCL (Vitolo, 
2016) and tend to have a poorer prognosis (Lees, 2019). 
Follicular lymphoma Grade 3B is considered an aggressive lymphoma with a clinical behavior similar to 
DLBCL and is generally treated according to the treatment recommendations for DLBCL (NCCN, 2019; 
Tilly, 2015; Dreyling, 2016; Dreyling, 2017). Currently, there are no products approved specifically for 
the treatment of patients with FL3B. 
Overall, the therapeutic strategies for FL3B and HGL with rearrangements of MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 
generally follow the treatment algorithm for DLBCL. Although recommendations have recently changed 
for first-line treatment of PMBCL (NCCN, 2019), salvage therapy for R/R PMBCL is treated similarly to 
R/R DLBCL. Patients who relapse or who do not respond to initial therapy are treated similarly to patients 
with R/R DLBCL (Vitolo, 2016). 
In summary, DLBCL patients who progress or who do not respond after 2 lines of treatment have a 
poor prognosis (Van Den Neste, 2016; van Imhoff, 2017). While the treatment landscape has changed 
with the approval of two CAR T-cell products, Yescarta and Kymriah, there remains an unmet need for 
therapies that have favorable benefit/risk profile in 3L+ LBCL, particularly in less common NHL 
subtypes and in other populations excluded from the registrational trials of the recently approved 
products. 
2.2.  About the product 
JCAR017 (lisocabtagene maraleucel/lisocabtagene maraleucel) is a CD19-directed genetically modified 
autologous  cellular  immunotherapy  consisting  of  purified  CD8-positive  and  CD4-positive  T  cells  in  a 
defined composition, that have been separately activated and transduced with a replication incompetent 
lentiviral vector encoding an anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). The CAR comprises an FMC63 
monoclonal  antibody-derived  single-chain  variable  fragment  (scFv),  immunoglobulin  G  (IgG)4  hinge 
region, CD28 transmembrane domain, 4-1BB (CD137) costimulatory domain, and CD3 zeta activation 
domain.  In  addition,  JCAR017  includes  a  non-functional  truncated  Epidermal  Growth  Factor  Receptor 
(EGFRt) that is co-expressed on the cell surface with the CD19-specific CAR. Although the EGFRt was 
mainly included as a cell surface protein for analytical detection of transfected T cells, it is also claimed 
to represent a potential target for the selective ablation of JCAR017 cells, which might prove useful in 
the  case  of  severe  late  adverse  drug  reactions  (e.g.  secondary  neoplasms  and/or  symptomatic, 
prolonged hypogammaglobulinaemia). 
JCAR017 is a T-cell product prepared from a patient’s T cells, which are purified from the product of a 
standard  leukapheresis  procedure.  The  purified  CD8+  and  CD4+  T  cells  are  separately  activated  and 
transduced with the replication-incompetent lentiviral vector containing the anti-CD19 CAR transgene. 
The  transduced  T  cells  are  expanded  in  cell  culture,  washed,  formulated  into  a  suspension,  and 
cryopreserved as separate CD8+ and CD4+ component vials that together constitute a single dose of 
JCAR017. The product is thawed prior to administration. 
The  JCAR017  formulation  contains  75%  (v/v)  Cryostor®  CS10  (containing  7.5%  dimethylsulfoxide 
([v/v]); 24% (v/v) Multiple Electrolytes for Injection, Type 1; and 1% (v/v) of 25% albumin (human). 
A single dose of JCAR017 contains a target of 100 x 106 (range 44-120 × 106) CAR-positive viable T cells 
consisting of a defined composition of CD8+ and CD4+ cell components: 
•  CD8+ cell component: Each vial contains 5.1-322 × 106 CAR-positive viable T cells in 4.6 mL 
(1.1-70 × 106 CAR-positive viable T cells/mL). 
Assessment report

•  CD4+ cell component: Each vial contains 5.1-322 × 106 CAR-positive viable T cells in 4.6 mL 
(1.1-70 × 106 CAR-positive viable T cells/mL). 
More than one vial of each of the CD8+ cell component and CD4+ cell component may be needed to 
achieve the dose of JCAR017. 
2.3.  Type of application and aspects on development 
The CHMP and CAT agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on the fact that JCAR017 (Breyanzi) for 
the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, PMBCL, and FL3B after at least 2 prior 
therapies  has  the  potential  to  address  the  unmet  medical  need  in  the  advanced  setting  of 
relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphomas and therefore can be considered of major interest from the 
point of view of public health, since based on the presented high-level data the availability of an anti-
CD19  CAR  T-cell  treatment  characterised  by  a  similar  efficacy  compared  to  the  currently  available 
products  (the  current  efficacy  standard  in  this  clinical  setting)  and  less  stringent  manufacturing 
prerequisites (patients with very low ALC counts could also be eligible) might improve patient access to 
a  such  a  survival,  potentially  curative,  extending  option.  Therefore,  the  request  for  accelerated 
assessment has been duly substantiated and is agreed.  
However,  during  the  assessment  the  CAT  and  CHMP  concluded  that  it  was  no  longer  appropriate  to 
pursue  accelerated  assessment,  as  following  the  initial  assessment  of  the  dossier  submitted  by  the 
applicant  the  Rapporteurs  identified  several  critical  issues  resulting  in  5  Quality  and  2  Clinical  major 
objections. The additional data requested to overcome the identified uncertainties and concerns entailed 
significant amendments and integrations of the initial dossier and required a deeper and more extensive 
data assessment than usually expected in later phases of review. Furthermore, during the assessment 
a  GMP  inspection  and  provision  of  a  GMP  certificate  were  considered  necessary  which  did  not  allow 
maintenance of the accelerated assessment timetable. 
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Breyanzi  (product  code  JCAR017)  is  an  autologous  cell  therapy  product  consisting  of  a  defined 
composition of purified CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, which have been separately activated and transduced 
with a replication incompetent lentiviral vector (LVV) encoding an anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor 
(CAR)  and  a  non-functional  truncated  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  (EGFRt).  The  latter  is  co-
expressed on the cell surface with the anti-CD19 CAR and can serve for a potential CAR T cell ablation 
system. 
The two finished product cell components (CD4+ and CD8+) are presented as dispersions for infusion. 
The  calculated  dose  volume  is  reported  on  the  Release  for  Infusion  (RFI)  certificate  provided  to  the 
clinical  sites  together  with  the  finished  product,  and  may  account  for  up  to  18.4  mL/component.  The 
target dose is 100x106 CAR-positive viable T cells (ranging from 44x106 to 120×106 cells), accounting 
for a target CD4+:CD8+ cell components’ ratio of 1:1 (ranging from 0.8 to 1.2).  
Other  ingredients  are  Cryostor  CS10,  sodium  chloride,  sodium  gluconate,  sodium  acetate  trihydrate, 
potassium  chloride,  magnesium  chloride,  human  albumin,  N-acetyl-DL-tryptophan,  caprylic  acid  and 
water for injections.

Breyanzi is supplied in cryopreservation vials made of cyclic olefin copolymer. Each 5 mL vial contains 
4.6 mL cell dispersion. 
The  CAR+  viable  T  cells  (CD8+  cell  component  or  CD4+  cell  component)  are  presented  in  individual 
cartons containing up to 4 vials of each component, depending upon the cryopreserved finished product 
CAR+  viable T cell concentration. The cartons of CD8+ cell component and CD4+ cell component are 
contained in a single outer carton. 
2.4.2.  Active Substances 
The section on the active substance is separated into two parts; part 1 for the lentiviral vector and part 
2 for the transduced cells. 
Unless otherwise specifically stated, the information on the transduced cells applies to both of the active 
substances, i.e., autologous CD8+ and CD4+ T cells transduced with a LVV to co-express an anti-CD19 
CAR and EGFRt. 
PART 1: LVV  
General Information (LVV) 
The LVV is the gene delivery vehicle for the CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) transgene. It 
is  a  third-generation  replication-incompetent  self-inactivating  (SIN)  vector  produced  using  design 
features in which the necessary viral genes are expressed from four separate plasmids that minimise the 
risk of replication competent lentivirus generation.  The vector system consists of the transfer plasmid, 
containing the CAR transgene, and three helper plasmids containing all the genes for viral packaging and 
delivery. 
In addition to capsid proteins and VSV-G pseudotyped envelope, the viral particles contain two copies of 
the RNA viral genome, that carries key viral elements necessary for LVV function, as well as sequences 
encoding a truncated form of the EGFR (EGFRt), which is intended to be co-expressed with the CD19-
specific CAR in the transduced T cells.  
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation (LVV) 
The facilities involved in manufacturing, testing and/or storage of the bulk lentiviral vector (BLV) and 
final filled lentiviral vector (FLV) are indicated in the dossier.  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The manufacture of the LVV starts with the thaw of a single vial of the working cell bank (WCB) and the 
cells  are  expanded  over  several  passages  The  cells  are  transiently  transfected  and  the  cell  culture 
supernatant containing the LVV is harvested and pooled into a common collection bag. Concerning the 
downstream process, the LVV undergoes a series of purification steps, and the clarified LVV supernatant 
is recovered, diluted with formulation buffer, and the resulting BLV is frozen. Subsequently, the frozen 
BLV is shipped to the FLV manufacturing site where it is filled into sterile vials.  
The  LVV  is  manufactured  under  aseptic  conditions  using  sterile  connections,  manifolds  and  closed 
systems. Any open manipulations are performed aseptically in an ISO 5 (Grade A) environment.  
Control of materials 
Generation of the Master Cell Bank (MCB) and WCBs has been adequately described. The overall testing 
strategy of for the cell banks is considered adequate

With  respect  to  the  plasmids,  adequate  information  and  acceptance  criteria  including  Certificates  of 
Compliance, TSE-BSE Statements and certificates of analysis (CoAs) for all four plasmid lots including 
release specifications for cell banks have been provided and are acceptable. 
Information on the raw materials, formulated media and buffers, and materials of contact used during 
the LVV manufacturing process, has been provided and adequate information on testing before release 
has been given.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The LVV manufacturing process has been described in sufficient detail, including flow charts and tables 
indicating the implemented in-process controls (IPCs), critical process parameters (CPPs) and non-critical 
process  parameters  (nCPPs)  along  with  the  relative  operating  ranges  and/or  acceptance  criteria.  The 
information provided is considered adequate. 
Process validation 
The BLV and FLV commercial manufacturing processes were validated. The process validation strategy 
for BLV and FLV consists in process design, process performance qualification (PPQ), continuous process 
verification (CPV), aseptic process validation, and shipping qualification in addition to BLV/FLV material 
qualification  and  validation  of  the  holding  conditions  of  buffers  and  media  used  in  the  manufacturing 
process. Adequate information on the WCB lot numbers and on the process parameters monitored during 
PPQ (CPPs, IPCs and nCPPs) has been provided. All quality attribute results met the specifications. All 
CPP results met the Proven Acceptable Ranges (PARs).  
The release results and the relative certificates of analysis (CoAs) have been provided. Aseptic process 
simulation (APS) was executed for BLV batches and for FLV batches and the information submitted is 
deemed acceptable. 
Validation studies on media and buffers formulated in advance for use in the BLV manufacturing process, 
were performed, to demonstrate that the solutions can be formulated adequately. Results from the buffer 
and  media  chemical  hold  studies  and  buffer  and  media  microbial  hold  studies  were  combined  to 
determine the expiry for the buffers and media used in the BLV manufacturing process. Mixing validation 
studies were performed using representative surrogate solutions to demonstrate that FLV processes can 
consistently produce homogeneous solutions. The approach described is overall acceptable.  
As regards BLV and FLV shipping validation, both studies were carried out with simulated product and 
transportation conditions, and all obtained results demonstrated that the shipping of BLV and FLV is a 
well-controlled part of the whole process. 
The list of parameters and attributes that will be monitored for the CPV programme have been provided.  
Manufacturing process development  
On  the  basis  of  quality  risk  management  principles,  vector  quality  attributes  were  evaluated  and 
categorised as critical quality attributes (CQAs) and non-CQAs based on the predicted severity of impact 
on the finished product safety and efficacy.  
The BLV and FLV were initially manufactured according to v1.0 manufacturing process, supporting clinical 
manufacturing  and  then  transferred  to  a  different  manufacturing  site,  and  implemented  as  v1.2 
manufacturing process. The comparability of the results obtained to support the site transfer has been 
shown.  
A summary of LVV method changes has been provided in a tabular format and the impact of the change 
of method on functional comparability has been sufficiently addressed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022  
Page 22/252 
 
 
 
A  prospective  comparability  assessment  evaluating  the  initial  versus  the  proposed  commercial 
manufacturing  process  is  described  by  the  applicant  and  includes  vector  analytical  and  functional 
comparability. The results show that the manufacturing processes are either consistent or showing an 
improvement for the commercial process.  
Characterisation 
Structural and functional characterisation of the LVV was performed using vector lots manufactured at 
all facilities used during the development.  
The integrity and identity of the CAR coding sequence has been confirmed. Vector function in T cells has 
been investigated. Data provided indicates a consistency in vector manufacturing. 
Vector process-related impurities are evaluated through a combination of release and characterisation 
testing. Data on the frequency of CAR+/EGFRt+ and on vector copy number (VCN) have been submitted 
as part of the LVV characterisation studies and considered satisfactory.  
Specification (LVV) 
The specifications for the unprocessed bulk vector harvest (BVH), the BLV and the FLV are provided and 
are considered acceptable. The specifications include general tests, identity, potency, purity / impurities, 
and safety related tests. 
Overall, the justifications provided are deemed sufficient to justify the current specifications set by the 
applicant. 
Analytical methods 
A description of the analytical methods used for release testing of the lentiviral vector has been provided 
and deemed acceptable. All non-compendial methods have been validated according to ICHQ2(R1). For 
the  compendial  methods,  no  formal  validation  is  required  but  suitability/verification  has  been 
demonstrated.  
Batch analysis 
The  batch  history  and  the  batch  data  of  BLV  and  FLV  lots  produced  have  been  provided  along  with 
information on the cell banks used to produce the vectors lots. This is considered sufficient.  
Reference materials 
There  are  no  reference  standards  for  the  LVV.  However,  a  vector  control  lot  that  has  been  fully 
characterised and is used as an assay control. 
Container closure system 
A  full  description  of  the  BLV  and  FLV  container  closure  system  have  been  provided  and  their 
appropriateness is justified.  
Stability (LVV) 
Long-term stability studies are ongoing and include multiple FLV lots. These studies incorporate batches 
from  each  manufacturing  site  and  are  being  conducted  with  primary  lots  manufactured  using  the 
proposed commercial manufacturing process and sites and supportive lots including material produced 
using  the  clinical  manufacturing  processes.  Stability  studies  were  evaluated  according  to  the 
specifications in place at the time of testing. 
Stressed stability studies were performed to demonstrate the stability indicating profile of the FLV.  
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022  
Page 23/252 
 
 
 
Based on the available stability data, a shelf life up to 12 months at -80°C ± 10°C is accepted for the 
FLV.  
PART 2: Autologous CD8+ and CD4+ T cells transduced with the LVV to express an anti-CD19 
CAR 
General Information (transduced cells) 
The assigned INN (lisocabtagene maraleucel) covers both active substances, i.e., the CD8+ and CD4+ 
T cells transduced with a LVV to express an anti-CD19 CAR. The company codes JCAR017 and liso-cel 
are also used by the applicant to describe the active substances/finished product.  
The active substances consist of purified human autologous CD8+ and CD4+ T cells transduced with a 
LVV containing an expression cassette for the anti-CD19 CAR and the EGFRt. The CAR construct (see 
below Figure 1) accounts for a single chain antibody fragment of murine origin derived from the mouse 
monoclonal anti-CD19 antibody FMC63, an extracellular spacer element of human origin, the CD28 as 
TM domain, the 4-1BB and CD3ζ as signaling domains. Reference is also made to the presence of the 
EGFRt on the CAR T cell surface.

Manufacture, process controls and characterisation (transduced cells) 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Selection  and  cryopreservation  of  CD8+  and  CD4+  cell  intermediates  is  carried  out  at  the  facility  in 
Germany.  The  cell  intermediates  are  then  shipped  to  the  Juno  Therapeutics  Inc.  Manufacturing  Plant 
(JuMP, USA), where the manufacture of the active substances and finished products takes place.  
The name, address and responsibilities of each site involved in the active substance manufacture have 
been  provided.  Appropriate  evidence  of  GMP  compliance  has  been  provided.  During  the  procedure  a 
major objection was raised due to the lack of valid EU GMP certificate for JuMP. Following an inspection, 
the relevant GMP certification was provided and the major objection is considered resolved. 
The  manufacturing  process  covers  unit  operations  that  start  with  leukapheresis  wash  and  includes 
selection, activation, transduction, expansion and harvest.  
CPPs, IPCs, and processing times have been presented with their associated targets or ranges. Sampling 
points for release testing have been included as well. In general, the aim of each unit operation has been 
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022  
Page 24/252 
 
 
 
 
 
addressed,  and  the  procedures  performed  within  each  unit  operation  has  been  adequately  described. 
Excess  cryopreserved  intermediates  may  be  generated,  which  would  be  forward  processed  in  the 
instance of a processing failure with the first bag.  
No reprocessing is allowed. 
Controls to monitor cell viability along the manufacturing process have been summarised. An explanation 
for the processing times stated in the unit operations has been provided.  
During the procedure a major objection was raised due to insufficient information and data confirming 
the suitability of the transduction unit operation. In response to the major objection evidence of suitable 
control of the transduction step has been provided. Nevertheless, the transduction step is considered as 
complex  and  there  is  currently  limited  experience.  Satisfactory  and  consistent  performance  of  the 
transduction  step  is  critical  to  active  substance/finished  product  quality  and  consequently  for  the 
benefit/risk profile of the product. Therefore, in order to further assess the consistency of product quality 
and clinical outcomes, the applicant should submit batch analysis and corresponding clinical safety and 
effectiveness data from a minimum of thirty (30) lots of Breyanzi finished product used to treat patients 
included in a non-interventional study based on secondary use of data from existing registries, according 
to an agreed protocol. Based on this data the applicant should also provide an evaluation on the need 
for  a  revision  of  the  finished  product  specifications.  Interim  reports  should  be  provided  after 
approximately 15 lots and any significant out of trend results should be reported immediately (Annex 
II condition, Due date: Final report by 31 December 2026). 
Based  on  the  information  received  and  the  commitment  to  provide  the  data  as  indicated  above,  the 
major objection was considered resolved. 
The description of microbial contamination controls within the manufacturing process has been provided. 
However,  during  the  procedure  a  major  objection  was  raised  in  relation  to  deficiencies  in  the 
microbiological  control  strategy.  In  response,  satisfactory  measures  have  been  implemented  by  the 
applicant to improve the microbiological control strategy. Sterility testing at the level of finished product 
release has also been adjusted to fully comply with Ph Eur 2.6.27. Consequently, the major objection 
was considered resolved. 
Control of materials 
The leukapheresis starting material is collected at qualified sites as described in the dossier. 
For  the  leukapheresis  starting  material  and  cryopreserved  material  (CMAT)  release  Ph.  Eur.  2.6.27 
compliant  sterility  testing  will  be  performed.  The  applicant  has  provided  validation  reports  for  the 
microbiological control of the leukapheresis starting material and the CMAT, which are suitable. 
The leukapheresis collection procedure has been sufficiently described.  
As requested, the applicant has established a release test panel for the leukapheresis starting material.  
The applicant has also provided the lists of tests performed for adventitious agents and confirmed the 
following points:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
patient screening and leukapheresis collection (procurement) adhere to national requirements 
of Member States;  
relevant epidemiological practices are adhered to;  
the testing for viral markers is performed by qualified laboratories;  
donor’s serum and or plasma is tested for adventitious agents as per directive 2006/17/EC;  
the adventitious agents’ tests are performed with EC-marked kits, as per directive 2006/17/EC.  
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022  
Page 25/252 
 
 
 
The applicant has detailed their strategy for the selection of the leukapheresis collection centres. The 
overall leukapheresis collection procedure will be performed according to written procedures as provided 
by  the  applicant.  In  addition,  leukapheresis  starting  material  testing  and  cell  processing  laboratories 
comply with EU Directives 2004/23/EC and all the daughter directives. Furthermore, periodic reviews of 
the apheresis centres are performed as well. The approach is overall sufficiently detailed and is endorsed.  
Media, buffer, and reagent preparations have been adequately described.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
With respect to the control of critical steps and intermediates, overall, the control strategy is presented 
in  an  acceptable  way.  CPPs  with  the  associated  acceptable  range  as  well  as  IPCs  with  corresponding 
acceptance  criteria/action  limits,  have  been  presented.  IPCs  mainly  focus  on  TNC.  Non-CPPs  and 
processing times have been described.   
The  cryopreserved  CD8+  and  CD4+  selected  materials  (CMAT)  are  identified  as  intermediates.  As 
requested, a minimum set of release specifications has been put forward for the intermediates. 
CD4+  and  CD8+  intermediates  stability  has  been  directly  and  indirectly  assessed  through  finished 
product manufacturing from intermediates stored for various timepoints. 
Process validation  
In  view  of  the  continuous  active  substance/finished  product  manufacturing  process,  the  process 
validation is described in the finished product section. 
Manufacturing process development 
In view of the continuous active substance/finished product manufacturing process, the manufacturing 
process development is described in the finished product section. 
Characterisation 
In terms of characterisation, an extensive set of studies were performed, covering the characterisation 
of 1) JCAR017 CAR structure and function, 2) JCAR017 phenotype and function, 3) JCAR017-associated 
mechanism  of  action,  4)  the  exploratory  correlative  analysis  between  JCAR017  quality  attributes  and 
clinical outcome in terms of efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics as reported in study 017001.  
Characterisation  data  has  been  collected  throughout  development.  Overall,  the  characterisation  data 
provided  show  homogeneity  between  the  two  cell  components  and  has  been  provided  for  a  relevant 
number of batches. 
Shared considerations were provided for the CD8+ and CD4+ active substances on the structural and 
functional characterisation of the CAR. The information provided, covering the CAR amino acid sequence, 
size and structure determination including primary structure as well as functional features of the CAR 
binding and activation domains, reassure about the CAR intended structure and functions.  
In terms of phenotypic and functional characterisation, the data suggests that the two cell components 
show a high degree of purity. The applicant has provided the requested information on the materials’ 
phenotypic composition.  
Extensive  characterisation  has  been  provided  also  in  terms  of  (VCN)/transduced  T  cell,  CAR  protein 
expression on the surface of cells and %CD3+CAR+.  
The claim of a consistent CAR expression/cell is supported by characterisation data.  
Data showing IFNγ secretion by the CD8+ and CD4+ cell components upon antigenic stimulation has 
been presented. During the procedure a major objection was however raised as the suitability of IFNγ 
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022  
Page 26/252 
 
 
 
secretion as potency assay was questioned. The IFNγ secretion has subsequently been justified as an 
acceptable surrogate marker for potency determination.  
With regard to the CD8+ cell component, it is acknowledged that no correlation has been found between 
the IFNγ secretion (or cytolytic activity) and the intended clinical outcome. However, this is an effect 
observed  nearly  for  all  such  complex  CAR  T  cell-based  products.  Therefore,  in  light  of  the  data  and 
justifications provided, the use of the IFNγ secretion assay can be supported as a surrogate potency test 
for release.   
Concerning  the  CD4+  cell  component,  the  applicant  has  evaluated  the  functional  profile  of  multiple 
cytokines that support the intended mechanism of action of the CD4+ cell component. The evaluation is 
based on correlative analysis data from a clinical study and recent published T cell literature.  
Consequently, the major objection was considered resolved. 
Characterisation  of  impurities  has  been  conducted.  All  lots  selected  for  testing  were  conforming  and 
manufactured with a commercially representative process. 
For  the  process-related  impurities,  the  data  or  considerations  provided  by  the applicant  are  assessed 
against exposure limits per dose.   
Adequate safety margins are in place for process-related impurities. 
The derivation of a permitted exposure for protamine sulphate is calculated from the therapeutic value 
of 50 mg/day, which is deemed acceptable. 
As far as the product-related impurities are concerned, the approach adopted by the applicant takes into 
account residual cell types. Overall, the approach is extensive and endorsed. It is recognised that the 
characterisation has been performed on a relevant number of batches. 
Short summaries of qualification reports for all impurities characterisation methods, has been provided.  
Impurity characterisation methods appear suitable for their intended use. 
Characterisation data has been extensively provided for study batches. However, differences have been 
noted between the US study 017001 vs the EU study BCM-001 results, which therefore has requested 
further insights on the quality standpoint. Comparison of quality attributes and correlations with efficacy 
response  were  provided  for  017001  vs  BCM-001  batches.  The  data  are  supportive  of  no  substantial 
differences between the two sets of batches from the quality standpoint.  
Specification (transduced cells) 
As  the  active  substance  cell  components  are  immediately  processed  to  finished  product,  the 
specifications  as  well  as  analytical  procedure,  validation  of  analytical  procedure,  batch  analysis, 
justification  of  specification,  and  container  closure  system  are  described  under  the  finished  product 
section.  
Stability (transduced cells) 
As  the  active  substance  cell  components  are  immediately  processed  to  finished  product,  no  active 
substance stability data have been submitted, which is acceptable.

2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development   
The  finished  product  consists  of  two  separate  autologous  cell  suspensions,  i.e.  1)  a  cryopreserved 
autologous CD8+ T (killer) CAR+ cell suspension and 2) a cryopreserved autologous CD4+ T (helper) 
cell suspension. The two cell component are presented in separate vials. The finished product is intended 
for intravenous administration.  
The finished product is composed of ≥5.1 x 106 anti-CD19 CAR+ viable T cells/vial (up to 4 vials/cell 
component),  CryoStor  CS10  (a  cryopreservative  solution  containing  10%  dimethylsulfoxide  (DMSO)), 
Multiple Electrolytes Injection Type I, and human albumin solution. The Multiple Electrolytes Injection, 
Type  I  contains  sodium  chloride,  sodium  gluconate,  sodium  acetate  trihydrate,  potassium  chloride, 
magnesium chloride, N-acetyl-DL-tryptophan, caprylic acid and water for injections.  
The  Albumin  (Human),  25%  Solution  Octapharma  is  an  EU  authorised  medicinal  product.  Multiple 
Electrolytes Injection, Type 1 is compliant with USP/Ph. Eur. For the CryoStor CS10, which is the only 
non-compendial excipient used in the finished product formulation, all the requested clarifications and 
information with respect to its quality for its intended use has been provided by the applicant which is 
deemed acceptable. 
The calculated dose volume is patient specific and is reported on the Release for Infusion (RFI) certificate 
provided to the clinical sites together with the finished product in the delivered package, and accounts 
for up to 18.4 mL/cell component. The target flat dose is 100x106 CAR+ viable T cells (range 44x106 - 
120×106 cells), accounting for a CD4:CD8 cell component target ratio of 1:1.  
The formulation development has been described.  
Manufacturing process development 
Across  the  product  development,  four  finished  product  manufacturing  process  versions  (v1-v4)  have 
been  used.  Process  v4  represents  the  commercial  process  and  commercial  site,  namely  Juno 
Manufacturing Plant (JuMP) (Bothell, WA, USA). The manufacturing process foreseen for the treatment 
of  EU  patients  in  the  commercial  setting  accounts  for  the  manufacture  of  the  CD4+  and  CD8+  cell 
intermediates at the facility in Germany and their subsequent shipment to JuMP for the finished product 
manufacture.  
Patients administered with finished product v1 were not included in the efficacy analysis set. Therefore, 
absence of a comparability exercise versus subsequent product versions is acceptable. Patients receiving 
finished product v2 are included in the efficacy analysis set. The applicant claims that no process changes 
were  associated  with  the  technology  transfer  that  had  the  potential  to  impact  CQAs;  therefore,  no 
prospective comparability was performed. This is endorsed.  
Implementation of manufacturing process v3 accounted for changes in the formulation. Therefore, the 
applicant conducted a process v2 versus process v3 retrospective comparability exercise. A conclusion 
of comparability is supported. Significant manufacturing changes have been introduced between process 
v3 and v4. Comparability has been addressed. Relevant shifts/differences are noted in both comparability 
studies for QAs for the v3 vs v4 finished product, yet compliant to the applicant’s established acceptance 
criteria,  i.e.,  release  specifications.  In  addition,  analysis  of  clinical  efficacy,  safety  and  PK  data  by 
manufacturing process versions shows consistent results across manufacturing process versions. It can 
be therefore concluded that, despite the relevant shifts observed the clinical performance of process v3 
vs v4 finished product can be considered overall comparable.  
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022  
Page 28/252 
 
 
 
In addition, it is concluded that sufficient data has been provided to support the CMAT manufacturing 
site in the EU commercial setting.  
Process characterisation 
As  far  as  process  characterisation  is  concerned,  a  process  parameter  risk  assessment  was  performed 
with the aim to identify parameters having a potential impact on relevant finished product and process 
performance attributes. This risk assessment was then used to prioritise evaluation of parameters and 
their impact on the relevant attributes within process characterisation studies.  
Overall,  it  can  be  agreed  with  the  applicant  that  process  characterisation  studies  showed  consistent 
production  of  finished  product  across  the  range  process  parameters  tested.  All  characterisation 
conditions  generated  finished  product  compliant  with  release  specifications,  providing  reassurance  on 
consistency of manufacture.  
The  main  elements  that  informed  the  commercial  process  control  strategy  are  represented  by  the 
classification  of  critical  raw  materials,  establishment  of  CQAs,  design  and  execution  of  process 
characterisation studies, and classification of process controls.  
Container closure system 
The  container  closure  system  consists  of  cryopreservation  vials  made  of  cyclic  olefin  copolymer.  The 
commercial container closure system complies with Ph. Eur. 3.2.2 Plastic Containers and Closures for 
Pharmaceutical Use.  
The product has been tested for its compatibility with the container closure system (vials), the syringe 
needle and the syringe used to withdraw the thawed product from the retrieval port, using conditions 
and preparation procedures representative to those used in clinical trials and proposed for commercial 
use.  According  to  the  data  provided,  it  can  be  agreed  that  1)  the  CD8+  and  CD4+  cell  components 
preserve their intended quality when held for 2 hours between 15°C and 25°C in 5 mL cryopreservation 
vials, 2) are compatible with a 20G needle. The applicant’s conclusions according to which the total time 
from the removal of the finished product from the LN2 shipper/freezer to the administration should not 
exceed 2h, is endorsed. The SmPC includes the following statement “once Breyanzi components have 
been drawn into syringes, proceed with administration as soon as possible”.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  names  and  addresses  of  the  facilities  involved  in  the  finished  product  manufacture  are  provided 
along  with  the  respective  responsibilities.  Upon  shipment  of  the  cryopreserved  CD4+  and  CD8+  cell 
intermediates from Germany (EU), the active substance/finished product manufacture, packaging as well 
as release and stability testing is performed at JuMP (USA). During the procedure a major objection was 
raised due to the lack of valid EU GMP certificate for JuMP. Following an inspection, the relevant GMP 
certification  has  now  been  provided  and  the  major  objection  is  considered  resolved.  QP 
release/certification in the EU is performed by Celgene Distribution B.V. in the Netherlands.  
The finished product manufacturing process encompasses harvest buffer exchange and formulation, fill, 
and  cryopreservation  of  finished  product.  The  manufacturing  process  is  continuous  and  transitioning 
from active substance to finished product manufacture occurs without any holding steps. 
CPPs have been defined for the above unit operations, while no IPCs have been established. Processing 
time have been set in the formulation, fill and cryopreservation unit operation.  
The  target  dose  volume  is  provided  by  the  applicant,  to  the  administration  site,  with  the  minimum 
number of finished product vials that are necessary to achieve the calculated dose volume. The applicant 
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022  
Page 29/252 
 
 
 
 
confirmed that Juno Therapeutics Inc., Manufacturing Plant (WA, USA) is responsible for the storage of 
excess finished product vials until the finished product has been administered to the patient.  
The  process  validation  strategy  includes  three  stages:  process  design,  process  qualification,  and 
continued process verification. The PPQ studies were considered appropriately designed. All acceptance 
criteria for the CPPs, IPCs and CQAs with acceptance criteria were met.  
To  account  for  variability,  the  PPQ  study  design  included  multiple  sources  of  cell  starting  material, 
multiple LVV manufacturers and multiple LVV lots.  
The selected tests and acceptance criteria established for cryopreserved material have been justified. 
Questions  raised  during  the  procedure  in  relation  to  the  process  validation  have  been  adequately 
addressed. Validation data demonstrates filter suitability for their intended use in a worst-case scenario.  
Extractable and leachable risk assessment, studies and conclusion are adequate.  
Appropriate shipping validation studies have been performed. 
Product specification 
In general, the proposed finished product specifications are reasonable and cover relevant CQAs. The 
quality  parameters  taken  into  account  for  each  cell  component  include  appearance,  identity,  purity, 
strength, potency and safety.  
The  release  specifications  for  the  container  closure  system  have  been  provided  and  are  deemed 
acceptable. 
During  the  procedure  a  major  objection  was  raised in  relation  to  the  lack  of  a  risk  evaluation  for  the 
potential presence of nitrosamine impurities. In response, the applicant confirmed that the risk of the 
presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product had been evaluated in accordance with the 
published  Art.  5(3)  Referral  on  Nitrosamines  (https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/referral/ 
nitrosamines-emea-h-a53-1490-assessment-report_en.pdf). The relevant documentation was provided 
as  requested.  The  risk  of  nitrosamine  impurities  is  considered  negligible  and  no  specific  controls  are 
considered necessary in this regard. The major objection was considered resolved. 
Analytical methods 
For  each  quality  attribute  tested  at  release,  the  applicant  has  provided  a  summary  of  the  analytical 
method and the corresponding analytical method validation report.  
Batch Analysis 
Batch analysis data for clinical lots manufactured throughout development has been provided. Results 
for multiple batches were submitted, covering the various manufacturing process versions and sites. The 
great majority of lots are within the specifications set at the time of production and comply also with the 
proposed commercial specifications. Batch analysis results show consistency of production well within 
the validated ranges.  
Stability of the product 
The  finished  product  lots  used  in  primary  and  supportive  stability  studies  are  representative  of  the 
commercial process and of the container closure system proposed for the commercial setting. 
The claimed shelf-life of 13 months at ≤-130°C in vapor phase of liquid nitrogen (LN2) is based on data 
for  both  CD8+  and  CD4+ cell  components.  The  stability  data  collected  support  the  13  months  expiry 
date proposed by the applicant. 
The testing panel applied for the stability studies is considered acceptable.

Based on the data provided, a shelf-life claim of 13 months at ≤-130°C is considered acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
TSE and viral safety aspects for the LVV and active substance/finished product, have been adequately 
addressed.  
In the context of the traceability aspects, the applicant declares that a full donor traceability system is 
in place for the human plasma-derived product used in the manufacture of the finished product.  
The  applicant  has  clarified  that  leukapheresis  product  from  patients  with  active  HIV  or  HCV  infection 
would not be accepted for product manufacture. This is controlled through the infectious diseases testing 
specification established for the CMAT. 
GMO 
Breyanzi  contains  autologous  genetically  modified  T  cells.  An  environmental  risk  assessment  in 
accordance with Directive 2001/18/EC has been presented with respect to the risk of release of GMO 
into the environment.  
Considering the overall information provided, it can be agreed that the environmental risk associated 
with Breyanzi can be considered negligible.   
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Breyanzi is a combination product composed of two active substances (autologous CD8+ and CD4+ T 
cells transduced with a lentiviral vector to express an anti-CD19 CAR).  
Information on development, manufacture and control has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The 
results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and  uniformity  of  important  product  quality 
characteristics,  and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the  conclusion  that  the  product  should  have  a  satisfactory 
performance in clinical use. 
Nonetheless, considering that 1) limited clinical experience has been gained with the proposed overall 
commercial manufacturing process and 2) consistent performance of the transduction step is critical to 
finished product quality, safety and efficacy, the applicant is requested to further assess the consistency 
of product quality and clinical outcomes by providing additional batch analysis and corresponding clinical 
safety and effectiveness data post-approval (see Annex II condition). 
A number of major objections were raised during the procedure: 
MO1 related to deficiencies in the microbiological control strategy. In response, the applicant provided 
satisfactory clarifications on the microbiological control strategy, and the sterility method was aligned 
with the Ph. Eur. as requested. Consequently, the major objection was considered resolved. 
MO2 related to the lack of a EU GMP certificate for the active substance/finished product manufacturing 
and  release/stability  testing  site  Juno  Therapeutics  Inc.  Following  an  inspection,  the  relevant  GMP 
certificate was provided and the major objection considered resolved.  
MO3 related to concerns around the suitability of the proposed transduction approach. Additional data 
and  justifications,  including  validation  data,  were  provided  in  response.  These  were  considered 
acceptable and considering also the commitment from the applicant to provide further data as outlined 
in the Annex II condition below, the major objection was considered resolved. 
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022

MO4 related to deficiencies in the data submitted to support the suitability for of the proposed potency 
test (IFN-γ secretion). It was acknowledged that IFNγ secretion is not an ideal potency assay, and that 
there is a lack of satisfactory correlation with efficacy. However, based on the additional justifications 
provided  by  the  applicant,  the  proposed  potency  assay  was  considered  acceptable  and  the  major 
objection resolved. 
MO5 related to the absence of a risk evaluation on potential nitrosamine impurities. Following submission 
of the requested documentation the major objection was considered resolved. The risk of nitrosamine 
impurities is considered negligible.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the clinical performance of the 
product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data have been presented to 
give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
The  CAT/CHMP  has  identified  the  following  measures  necessary  to  address  the  identified  quality 
developments issues that may have a potential impact on the safe and effective use of the medicinal 
product: 
In order to further assess the consistency of product quality and clinical outcomes, the MAH shall submit 
batch analysis and corresponding clinical safety and effectiveness data from a minimum of thirty (30) 
lots of Breyanzi finished product used to treat patients included in a non-interventional study based on 
secondary use of data from existing registries, according to an agreed protocol. Based on this data the 
MAH should also provide an evaluation on the need for a revision of the finished product specifications. 
Interim reports should be provided after approximately 15 lots and any significant out of trend results 
should be reported immediately (Annex II condition. Due date: Final report by 31 December 2026).  
At the time of the CAT/CHMP opinion, there were a number of unresolved quality issues which are not 
expected to have an impact on the benefit/risk ratio of the product. These points are put forward and 
agreed  as  recommendations  for  future  quality  development  (see  below  “Recommendations  for  future 
quality development”).  
The CHMP endorses the CAT assessment regarding the conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and 
biological aspects as described above. 
2.4.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CAT/CHMP recommended some points for further investigation including completing the characterisation 
and testing of the viral vector and the finished product. 
The  CHMP  endorses  the  CAT  assessment  regarding  the  recommendation(s)  for  future  quality 
development.

2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Pharmacology 
2.5.1.1.  Primary and secondary pharmacodynamic  
In vitro experiments to evaluate genomic integration profile of the self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vector 
encoding the CAR and the non-functional truncated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRt)transduced 
in Autologous CD4+ and CD 8+ T cells, demonstrated no preferential integration at loci associated with 
enhanced risk of transformation. 
The in vitro studies focus on the characterisation of JCAR017, in terms of affinity and specificity of the 
FMC63 scFv binding domain to CD19, the cytotoxic T cell killing of CD19 positive target cells, cytokine 
production  and  JCAR017  cell  proliferation.  JCAR017  FMC63  binding  domain  specific  interaction  with  a 
discontinuous epitope of human CD19 was reported. The specificity of JCAR017 binding to human CD19-
expressing target cells and the absence of species cross-reactivity was further demonstrated by a flow 
cytometry binding assay, that confirmed the absence of activity against CD19-expressing mouse cells. 
The rationale to choose CD19, expressed mainly on normal and malignant B-cells, as target for JCAR017 
was proved by a bioinformatics analysis on databases of human normal and tumour tissues, including 
haematological malignancies. 
The activation of JCAR017 upon human CD19-engagement was evaluated.  
The downstream 4-1BB and CD3ζ regions of the CAR construct were reported to undergo activation by 
co-culture of CAR mutant-expressing Jurkat reporter cells and CD19-expressing tumour cells. 
JCAR017 T cells were evaluated for proliferation, activation, cytokine production and acquisition of killing 
capability of target cells.  
Both  CD4+  cell  component  and  CD8+  cell  component  JCAR017  T  cells  were  reported  to  proliferate 
specifically in response to co-culture with several CD19-expressing cell lines, including FL and PMBCL-
derived cells, in terms of cytokine production (IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α) and up-modulation of CD69 and 
CD25 markers.  
A viability assay (RPT-001115) with anti-idiotypic stimulation of JCAR017 CD4 and/or CD8 cells showed 
that  the  combination  of  1:1  CD4+:CD8+  JCAR017  subsets  provided  a  benefit  to  total  cell  growth  as 
compared to CD8+ subset alone. This assay did not include other ratios besides the 1:1 ratio. In addition, 
the assay measured total viability in the 1:1 subgroup and did not discriminate between CD4 viability 
and CD8 viability when the 1:1 ratio was used.  
Cytolytic activity of JCAR017 T cells against a variety of CD19+ FL and PMBCL cell lines, upon co-culture 
with each target cell line, was also reported. Likewise, JCAR017 cells derived from NHL patients showed 
a high degree of specific cytolytic activity against CD19+ tumour cells, after 4-day culture.   
Regarding  the  characterisation  of  co-expression  of  CAR  and  EGFRt,  the  performed  flow  cytometry 
analysis confirmed this parameter.  
The  in  vivo  pharmacology  studies  were  performed  in  immune-deficient  NOD/SCID  IL-2Rγnull  mice 
engrafted i.v. with 5.0E+05 human CD19+ Raji Burkitt’s lymphoma cells engineered to express a red-
shifted  firefly  luciferase  (rFLuc)  transgene  and  green  fluorescent  protein  (GFP),  for  non  invasive 
assessment of disseminated lymphoma growth by in vivo bioluminescence imaging (study RPT-0433). 
The results demonstrated that JCAR017 cells, obtained from healthy and patient donors, were able to 
reduce tumour burden and increase mice survival, in a dose-dependent manner, through all the tested 
Assessment report

periods (0-100 days), in contrast with the control group (died by day 10-11). JCAR017 precommercial 
v3.0 and proposed commercial v4.0 processes evaluation in tumour-engrafted NOD/Scid mice showed 
antitumour efficacy of both products, in terms of tumour burden reduction and mice survival, in a dose 
dependent manner. However, it is important to note that differences between v3.0 and v4.0 processes 
in mice survival, mostly at medium and high doses, are reported as significant:

With  regard  to  JCAR017  PK  evaluation,  the  monitoring  over-time  of  circulating  CD8+  JCAR017  cells 
demonstrated that these cells, at the high dose, peaked at Day 8 whereas at the medium and low doses 
peaked  on  Day  14,  dependent  from  donors  and  manufacturing  processes.  Circulating  CD4+  JCAR017 
cells displayed a more variable trend across the manufacturing processes and donor sources. While high 
dose HD1 CD4+ JCAR017 v3.0 remained very high at all time-points, the v4.0 counterpart did not exhibit 
any expansion. Likewise, HD2 CD4+ JCAR017 v4.0 were very high at all time-points, but the v3.0 one 
did not expand at any time. In addition, both CD4+ JCAR017 v3.0 and v4.0 did not display almost any 
expansion at low and medium doses.  
To assess all the parameters and the efficacy of cetuximab treatment in depleting JCAR017 T Cells in 
vivo, a series of in vivo studies were performed by means of a Raji xenograft mouse model. The studies 
Raji-1806  and  Raji-1809  (RPT-001479)  were  undertaken  to  demonstrate  the  in  vivo  elimination  of 
JCAR017  after  cetuximab  administration  (0.25  or  0.125  mg/mouse),  by  assaying  the  elimination  or 
reduction in CAR T numbers in peripheral blood, spleen, or bone marrow (primary endpoints) as well as 
increased  tumour  burden  and  reduced  cetuximab-treated  animals’  survival  (secondary  endpoints).  In 
Raji-1806 study, CAR T cells (0.5E+06 for both CD4+ and CD8+) were found expanded within circulation 
and  were  detectable  within  lymphoid  tissues  on  Day  13  post  infusion.  Cetuximab  (0.5  mg/mouse, 
intraperitoneally) was administrated on Days 7, 9, 11, and 13 reducing significantly CAR T numbers in 
blood, spleen and bone marrow. This study was not suitable for evaluating tumour growth and survival 
parameters because no reduction in tumour burden was observed in 6 out of 8 JCAR107-treated mice, 
reflecting the low survival similar observed in JCAR017-not treated Raji xenograft mice.  The Raji-1809 
study demonstrated that cetuximab administered on Days 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, and 24 (starting at 
the peak time CAR T expansion) reduced significantly numbers of CAR T cells in blood and spleen but 
not  in  bone  marrow.  Conversely  to  the  previous  study,  this  report  showed  faster  tumour  growth  and 
reduction in numbers of JCAR017 in cetuximab-treated versus vehicle mice.  
PK data were gathered after single (Report CC-DISC-DMPK-3291 cetuximab administered at 5 mg or 20 
mg/kg IV or 20 mg/kg IP for the dose selection) or repeated (RPT-002100; cetuximab 0.125 or 0.25 
mg/Kg mouse, intravenously on different days) cetuximab administration.  
In RPT-002100, it is noted that reference clinical PK information for the cetuximab (i.e., mean steady-
state peak and through concentrations) are referenced from the FDA-approved SmPC (2019) or from 
the paper Luo FR et al, 2005, which does not provide updated information.  
Importantly,  the  analysis  of  cetuximab  PK  in  the  mouse  serum  (after  both  single  and  repeated  dose 
administration was supported by an ELISA with an assay range from 7.81 (LLOQ) to 1000 (ULOQ) ng/ml 
of Cetuximab (Report CC-DISC-DMPK-3415). As consequence, the performance of assays has implied 
the  study  sample  dilution  since  the  amount  of  cetuximab  found  in  the  mouse  serum  is  far  above  the 
assay  ULOQ.  The  results  show  that  the  dilution  factors  reported  in  report  RPT-002100  and  CC-DISC-
Assessment report

DMPK-3291 (i.e., ≤600), are outside the validated range of dilutions (i.e., 1:800 to 1:12,800 dilution) 
that was established in report CC-DISC-DMPK-3415 to address the ELISA assay dilution integrity. In this 
regard,  it  should  be noted  that the  dilution integrity  should  cover  the  dilution(s)  applied  to  the  study 
samples (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1 Corr. 2**).  
Overall, according to the results provided in study RPT-002100 report, the mouse PK data after the first 
(out  of  six)  administered  cetuximab  dose  may  be  considered  in  line  with  cetuximab  clinical  levels 
observed at the steady state. However, human steady state levels appear to be far below as compared 
to those observed in the mouse approaching the steady state (i.e., mouse PK data immediately prior to 
the final cetuximab dose), in correspondence of which assessment of cell ablation has been performed 
and data has been provided (i.e., day 21). Furthermore, ablation data has been provided at day 13 with 
no corresponding PK information, thus hampering the assessment of the data relevance. Of note, a trend 
of cell ablation in the mouse at earlier time points after cetuximab administration, including immediately 
prior to the administration of the second cetuximab dose, should be discussed possibly also taking also 
into account corresponding mouse cetuximab PK data.  
To perform the NC Study RPT-002100, the applicant set-up and validated a flow cytometry assay for the 
detection of human JCAR017 cells in mouse whole blood specimens. 
2.5.1.2.  Safety pharmacology programme 
The  autologous  cell-based  JCAR017  T  products  lack  species  cross-reactivity  thus  in  all  NC  studies 
performed  safety  pharmacology  was  deemed  not  practical  and  of  negligible  utility.  Overall,  no  safety 
pharmacology studies were conducted. 
2.5.1.3.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
NC studies to test drug interactions were performed to support future use in those patients that may 
require  adjunct  CAR  T  therapy  for  the  treatment  of  B-cell  lymphomas  in  association  with  cancer 
therapies.  
The  first  study  intended to  evaluate the  effects  of durvalumab,  an  anti-PD-L1  Ab  (20  μg/mL),  on the 
activation status of JCAR017 cells, supporting their association in a therapeutic regimen.  
BTKi  (ibrutinib  and  acalabrutinib)  were  evaluated  for  their  effects  on  in  vitro  JCAR017  function.  The 
results indicated no detrimental effects of both drugs on JCAR017 performance. 
The efficacy of JCAR017 in combination with Ibrutinib or Acalabrutinib was evaluated also in vivo in NOD-
SCID IL2Rγnull mice engrafted with 5 x 105 Nalm-6 Firefly Luciferase (FfLuc)-green fluorescent protein 
(GFP) lymphoblastic leukaemia cells. The results showed that the combination of JCAR017 with ibrutinib 
or acalabrutinib enhanced mice survival and was significantly more effective at expanding numbers of 
CAR-T cells and limiting numbers of tumour cells than treatment with JCAR017 alone. 
Studies  on  the  interactions  between  the  immunomodulatory  drugs  CC-122  and  lenalidomide  and 
JCAR017 seem to show strong donor-dependent effects in terms of immune parameters variability (e.g., 
cytokine production like IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α, or surface marker expression).  
In the experiment regarding the IDO1-specific inhibitor epacadostat, IDO1 expression in a tumour cell 
line was reported to be driven by JCAR017 via IFNγ secretion, resulting in tryptophan depletion, and in 
turn abrogation of CAR T-cell proliferation that could be restored by the addition of epacadostat.

2.5.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic studies 
Because  of  JCAR017  product  typology,  conventional  non-clinical  pharmacokinetic  studies  were  not 
conducted, which is appropriate. Nevertheless, the in vivo persistence of JCAR017 cells was investigated 
in the report RPT-0433, and PK data were discussed in section of primary pharmacodynamics in vivo 
studies. 
Absorption, metabolism, excretion 
JCAR017 is an autologous cell-based product administered by intravenous infusion. As such, absorption, 
metabolism, and excretion studies were not performed.   
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
The  lack  of  pharmacokinetic  drug  interactions  studies  is  justified,  given  the  autologous  human  cell 
therapy nature of JCAR017 and the lack of suitable nonclinical models. 
2.5.3.  Toxicology 
JCAR017 T product is an autologous T-cell based treatment characterised by the lack of species cross-
reactivity.  In  this  light,  traditional  toxicity,  including  single  and  repeat-dose  toxicity,  genotoxicity, 
carcinogenicity,  reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity,  and  local  tolerance  studies  were  deemed  of 
negligible utility and thus were not conducted. 
2.5.3.1.  Genotoxicity 
Genotoxicity  of  JCAR017  product  was  assessed  by  Genomic  mapping  of  lentiviral  integration  sites  in 
JCAR017 cryopreserved drug product. The results demonstrated that JCAR017 construct did not change 
the integration patter, which resulted similar to that of wildtype HIV-1, according to literature data.  
2.5.3.2.  Carcinogenicity 
Consistent with regulatory guidance under “Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals” (ICH 
S9,  2009)  carcinogenicity  studies  were  not  conducted.  However,  to  determine  carcinogenicity-linked 
parameters,  a  non-conventional  in  vitro  study  (8398350)  was  performed  to  assess  IL-2  independent 
CAR017 T cell proliferation by evaluation of cell counts and CAR T cell characterisation via flow cytometry.  
Taken  together,  the  applicant  provided  data  supporting  the  absence  of  a  carcinogenicity  potential  of 
JCAR017 T cells, since most samples in the absence of IL-2, after 60 days of culture, resulted below the 
LLOQ  for  cell  concentration.  However,  the  characteristics  of  the  JCAR017  cells  assessed  by 
immunophenotyping  (purity,  proliferation,  and  identity)  was  incomplete,  thus  it  is  not  possible  to 
conclude that purity and identity of JCAR017 T cells was comparable at Day 1 and Day 61. 
2.5.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Human cells are not able to proliferate in the environment and the applicant has sufficiently substantiated 
that no shedding is expected from patients. The risk for non-target people to come into contact with the 
product is negligible as assured by sufficient risk minimisation measures, i.e., administration in qualified 
centres,  appropriate  product  disposal,  instructions  on  handling  (including  use  of  individual  personal 
protective equipment by HCPs), recommendations regarding donation of cells/tissues/blood/organs from 
treated patients, chain of identity and custody in place. Furthermore, the applicant has demonstrated 
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022  
Page 36/252 
 
 
 
that  the  risk  of  RCL  generation  post-administration  is  negligible  and  that  presence  of  residual 
transduction competent LVV in JCAR017 is unlikely.  
Considering the overall applicant’s discussion, it can be agreed that the environmental risk associated 
with Breyanzy can be considered negligible.   
2.5.5.  Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
Due to the intrinsic specie-specific characteristics of cellular immunotherapy products, full non-clinical 
studies  have  not  been  possible.  In  particular,  suitable  animal  models  are  not  available  for  accurately 
assessing the non-clinical characteristics of a human cell-based product such as JCAR017. Therefore, the 
non-clinical studies were conducted to demonstrate the proof of principle of the therapy, and to identify 
the principal effects by in vitro assays and in vivo immunocompromised rodent models employing human 
tumour xenografts. 
The in vitro studies included in the dossier provide an appropriate characterisation of JCAR017, in terms 
of affinity and specificity of the FMC63 scFv binding domain to CD19, the cytotoxic T cell killing of CD19 
positive target cells, cytokine production and JCAR017 cell proliferation. 
The results support that JCAR017 is specific for human CD-19 binding and lacks species cross-reactivity, 
in particular towards mouse and non-human primate. A bioinformatics analysis confirmed the rationale 
to choose as target for JCAR017 CD19, expressed mainly on normal and malignant B-cells. Upon human 
CD19-engagement,  JCAR017  T  cells  were  reported  to  undergo  proliferation,  activation,  cytokine 
production (IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α) and acquisition of killing capability of target cells. 
The lack of conventional in vivo studies and the use of immune-deficient Raji Burkitt’s lymphoma-bearing 
NOD/SCID  IL-2Rγnull  mice  model  are  justified  and  appropriate  to  investigate  autologous  cell-based 
products. JCAR017 (precommercial [v3.0] and proposed commercial process [v4.0]) were assayed for 
antitumour activity, evaluated as tumour growth inhibition and mice survival enhancement, and for in 
vivo expansion. The reported data demonstrated that the potency of JCAR017 was dependent on dose 
and  donor  source  but  differences  in  antitumour  effects  were  observed  between  JCAR017  v3.0  e  v4.0 
manufactured from the same donor. Similarly, CD4+cell component and CD8+ cell component showed 
variability for in vivo expansion in a donor- dose- and manufacturing process-dependent manner. While 
variance from donor to donor is expected, some donor variance between JCAR017 precommercial (v3.0) 
and commercial processes (v4.0) is reported in terms of mice survival and circulating cell numbers. 
JCAR017 lots utilised in Report RPT-001114 and Report RPT-001115 were manufactured using Process 
v4.0, the proposed commercial process. NC data in Report RPT-001115 do not provide knowledge on 
how each T cell subset (CD4+ cell component vs CD8+ cell component) was impacted by the combination 
of both (1:1) when an increased viable cell count was observed upon JCAR017 stimulation. Moreover, 
since only  the 1:1  ratio  was  tested  throughout  the non-clinical development, NC  data  cannot  provide 
support for other ratios observed in the clinic. 
In vivo studies were also undertaken to demonstrate the cetuximab capability to deplete JCAR017 cells. 
All these results support the cetuximab capability to deplete JCAR017 cells even if it should be considered 
that the cetuximab activity may be under-estimated in the Raji xenograft model lacking NK cells. This 
feature does not allow CAR-T antibody depletion via ADCC. Also, although the analysis of cetuximab PK 
in the mouse serum showed that cetuximab dose may be considered in line with cetuximab clinical levels 
observed  at  the  steady  state,  mouse  approaching  the  steady  state  (i.e.,  mouse  PK  data  immediately 
prior  to  the  final  cetuximab  dose,  when  cell  ablation  was  performed)-  displayed  very  high  levels  of 
cetuximab with respect to human steady state levels.

In  order  to  detect  JCAR017  cells  within  the  in  vivo  experiments,  the  set-up,  the  validation  and  the 
qualification of a flow cytometry assay were carried out. The assays resulted appropriately performed 
and permitted the identification of JCAR017 cells as CD3+EGFRt+, CD3+EGFRt+ID+ or CD3+ID+ cells, 
even  though  the  methodology  is  not  complete  in  all  parts.  An  additional  study  to  evaluate  antibody 
titrations, included in RPT-002100, supports that the used antibody volume did not affect the specificity 
of the flow cytometry panel and did not generate non-specific binding or fluorescent spillover as well as 
demonstrate that the FM2 control was suitable and comparable to individual FMO for anti-EGFR PE and 
anti-ID AF647 antibodies.  
Studies  related  to  pharmacodynamic  interactions  of  JCAR017  with  standard-of-care  therapeutics, 
including  programmed  cell  death  protein-1  ligand  antibody  (durvalumab),  immunomodulatory  drugs 
(CC-122  [investigational  drug]  and  lenalidomide  [Revlimid])  and  Bruton  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors 
(ibrutinib and acalabrutinib), were performed in vivo and in vitro. The provided data support the absence 
of detrimental effects of durvalumab, ibrutinib and acalabrutinib on JCAR017 performance. Regarding 
the  donor-dependent  effects  of  CC-122  and  lenalidomide  on  JCAR  products,  although  cytokine 
directionality is preserved, the increase of IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α production in some cases is very limited. 
In  addition,  although  changes  in  surface  marker  expression  may  support  potentiated  effector 
differentiation, low CD28 expression is recommended to be deeper investigated. As well, the induction 
of IDO in malignant B-cells cultured with JCAR products is recommended to be better elucidated. 
In  genotoxicity  studies,  the  applicant  demonstrated  that  JCAR017  construct  did  not  change  the 
integration patter similar to that of wildtype HIV-1. The advantage to use SIN-LTR construct relied on a 
low potential to activate neighbouring genes, thus abolishing the risk of insertion-mediated genotoxicity 
and oncogenic insertional transformation. Overall, the collected data support a very low likelihood for T 
cell transformation induced by lentiviral insertional mutagenesis. 
The carcinogenicity study, performed to assess IL-2 independent CAR017 T cell proliferation, excluded 
the prevalence of JCAR017 T cells with a malignant potential, supporting the absence of a carcinogenicity 
potential for JCAR017.  
Given  the  absence  of  a  relevant  animal  model  for  assessing  the  safety  of  JCAR017,  no  studies  were 
conducted  to  assess  potential  effects  of  JCAR017  on  fertility,  embryonic  development,  prenatal  and 
postnatal development, or juvenile development. 
Environmental risk associated with ide-cel is considered to be negligible. 
The CHMP endorse the CAT discussion on the non-clinical aspects as described above.  
2.5.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the studies provided in the non-clinical package are sufficient to demonstrate the key structural, 
phenotypic and functional characteristics of JCAR017.  
Specifically, primary pharmacodynamic studies provide adequate evidences on the affinity and specificity 
of  JCAR017  towards  CD19-target  cells  and  on  their  activation  in  terms  of  proliferation,  cytokine 
production and lysis of target cells as well as on JCAR017 antitumour effects. 
The  secondary  pharmacodynamic  studies  demonstrated  the  specie-specificity  of  JCAR017  and  the 
efficacy of their cetuximab-mediated ablation. 
From the toxicology point of view, the data sustained the lack of insertion-mediated genotoxicity and 
oncogenic insertional transformation as well as the absence of JCAR017 carcinogenicity potential. 
The CHMP endorse the CAT conclusions on the non clinical aspects as described above.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Clinical Pharmacology data on JCAR017 derived from studies 017001 and BCM-001. Study 017001 was 
conducted in US in adult patients with R/R B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and BCM-001 enrolled 
patients with aggressive B-cell NHL and was conducted in Europe and Japan to evaluate the feasibility 
of manufacturing JCAR017 drug product for delivery in Europe. 
Cellular kinetic parameters were determined in peripheral blood using non-compartmental methods. 
In study 017001, non-compartmental PK parameters such as Cmax (peak level of expansion), AUC0-28, 
and Tmax were calculated and summarised for subjects who had a PK measurement on Day 29 or later. 
PK values and persistence (qPCR and flow cytometry) were summarised by scheduled visit. Data were 
summarised by disease cohort (DLBCL, MCL) and dose regimen. 
In  study  BCM-001,  the  PK  study  endpoints  by  PCR  are  Cmax,  tmax,  and  AUC,  including  maximum 
expansion, expansion rate (defined as Cmax/Tmax) and duration of persistence of JCAR017 in peripheral 
blood.  The AUC calculated is the Area under the curve (AUC) from JCAR017 infusion through 28 days 
after infusion (i.e., from Day 1 to Day 29; (AUC0-28). By flow cytometry, the parameters are Cmax, 
tmax, and AUC, and persistence of JCAR017 in peripheral blood (up to 2 years after JCAR017 infusion).

A population pharmacokinetics (PK) modelling and simulation exercise of systemic JCAR017 transgene 
levels based on data from Study 017001 was performed to support the development of JCAR017. 
The objectives of this analysis were to develop a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model to characterise 
the kinetics of JCAR017 transgene to permit estimation of the systemic exposures to JCAR017; and to 
understand covariates that might influence JCAR017 kinetics in individual subjects. 
The population PK analysis was performed using data from subjects who were treated with a single dose 
of JCAR017 in Study 017001, excluding data from subjects who were on the 2-dose schedules and data 
after  retreatment  or  additional  cycles  in  subjects  who  were  on  single-dose  schedule  and  received 
retreatment or additional cycles of JCAR017.  
The PK data of JCAR017 from Study 017001 were analysed using a nonlinear-mixed effects modeling 
approach as implemented in NONMEM, version 7.3.0. 
The population PK model was developed in a stepwise manner, including base structural model selection, 
covariate analysis, and model evaluation with goodness-of-fit criteria, visual predictive checks, and the 
bootstrap re-sampling test for robustness.  
The final form of the structural model for JCAR017 transgene includes the four, classical phases of cellular 
growth: lag, growth, stationary, and decline (Madigan, 1997) and the addiction of a lag phase to the 
initial cellular expansion phase improved model fit. 
A total of 2.085 post-infusion PK observations were included in the Population PK Analysis Set. Of these, 
221  (10.6%)  were  below  the  limit  of  detection  (LOD)  and  were  flagged  as  missing.  This  primarily 
occurred in the extreme tail of the post-treatment times. 
Population-predicted (PRED) and individual-predicted (IPRE) JCAR017 transgene levels versus observed 
(DV) JCAR017 transgene levels for the structural model shows that there is an agreement for individual-
predicted versus individual observed values.  
The final popPK model included the following covariates: 1) Age on Cmax and Tdbl; 2) SPD per IRC prior 
to LDC on HLα; 3) Tocilizumab and/or corticosteroid use (for the treatment of CRS or iiNT) on Cmax and 
HLα;  4)  Manufacturing  process  version  (proposed  commercial  process  versus  original  and  pre-
commercial processes) on Tlag. 
No  formal  biopharmaceutics  studies  (including  bioavailability,  bioequivalence,  or  in  vitro-in  vivo 
correlation studies) and no clinical studies to evaluate the PK and tolerability in healthy subjects have 
been  conducted  because  JCAR017  is  a  genetically  modified  autologous  T-cell  immunotherapy  product 
being developed for subjects with large B-cell lymphoma. 
Traditional PK analyses are not relevant for this CAR T cell product and overall, the proposed strategy to 
describe cellular kinetics based on expansion and persistence is acceptable. 
Bioanalytical methods 
Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was employed either to quantify the presence 
of replication-competent virus (RCL) or the residual vector copy number (VCN) in CAR-T cells in patients 
at different times of treatment. 
The  expansion  and  persistence  of  the  two  CAR  T-Cells  (CD4+EGFRt+  and  CD8+EGFRt+)  and  CD19 
positive  B  Cells  in  patient  samples  was  also  evaluated  by  flow  cytometry  analysis.  Whole  blood  was 
harvested  with  ETDA  as  anticoagulant  and  cells  labelled  with  a  panel  of  fluorophore-conjugated 
antibodies to determine the relative percentage and absolute counts of the populations of interest.

The immunogenicity of the extracellular domain of JCAR017 was evaluated analyzing the INF-gamma 
released  from  T  cells,  by  an  interferon  (INF)  gamma  enzyme-linked  immunospot  assay,  and  the 
production of anti-therapeutic antibody (ATA). The formation of ATA against the extracellular domain of 
JCAR017  was  evaluated in  plasma  and  serum  by  an  ECL-based  immunoassay  in  studies  017001  and 
BCM-001. According to guidelines for the detection of ATA a multi-tiered approach for immunogenicity 
was considered which included a screening, a confirmatory assay, and a titre assay. 
Cytokine levels were analysed in patients receiving JCAR017 to address the severity of cytokine release 
syndrome (CRS) with sandwich immunoassays. 
Expansion and persistence (ADME) 
Expansion 
In study 17001, CAR T-cell expansion was observed across all dose levels tested (DL1S, DL2S, DL3S, 
with no clear relationship between administered dose and maximum observed concentration (Cmax) or 
AUC through 28 days after infusion (ie, from Day 1 to Day 29) (AUC0-28). After an additional cycle or 
retreatment Cmax and AUC0-28 appeared to be lower compared with those after the first dose (DL1D). 
Table 2. Pharmacokinetics Summary by Assigned Dose Regimen, DLBCL Cohort (qPCR PK 
Analysis Set, study 17001) 
In  study  BCM-001,  the  PK  study  endpoints  obtained  by  PCR  are  Cmax,  tmax,  and  AUC,  including 
maximum expansion, expansion rate (defined as Cmax/Tmax) and duration of persistence of JCAR017 
in  peripheral  blood.    The  cellular  kinetic  profile  shows  an  initial  rapid  expansion  (proliferation  and 
multiplication) phase achieving maximal expansion (Cmax) around Day 10. Cmax and AUC0-28d were 
66% and 33% higher respectively in cohort 3 (Japanese sites) relative to cohort 1, and a higher median 
Tmax of 12 days was observed in cohort 3.

Table 3. Summary of JCAR017 Transgene Pharmacokinetic Parameters by Cohort (qPCR PK 
Analysis Set) 
Data on cellular kinetic are available in the popPK model and showed that JCAR017 transgene levels are 
stable  for  approximately  3  days  after  dose  (Tlag  2.53  days  (60.2%  BSV),  followed  by  an  expansion 
lasting  approximately  7  days  where  the  JCAR017  transgene  levels  increase  approximately  100-fold, 
followed by two phases of declining JCAR017 transgene levels with alpha-phase (HLα) and beta-phase 
(HLß) half-life estimates of 5.07 (95.5% BSV) and 564 days, respectively. The fraction of peak JCAR017 
transgene  levels  appearing  in  the  beta-phase  (Fβ)  was  estimated  0.665%.  There  is  no  correlation 
between the dose administered and expansion of the cells and, moreover, a very high variability in the 
exposure parameters is shown.

Persistence 
Long-term  persistence  of  CAR+  T  cells  in  peripheral  blood  up  to  2  years  was  noted.  A  threshold  for 
expansion  or  persistence  that  correlates  with  response  or  response  duration  remains  to  be  identified 
even if long-term persistence provide evidence for durable efficacy.  
In Study 017001, the majority of subjects treated demonstrated long-term persistence of CAR+ T cells 
based on transgene detection in peripheral blood with 77% on Day 90 and with durable persistence of 
JCAR017 transgene for 45% of subjects up to 2 years after JCAR017 infusion (Day 730).  
Table 4. Persistence of JCAR017 Transgene by Dose Level, DLBCL Cohort (qPCR PK Analysis 
Set, study 17001) 
In Study BCM-001, in cohort 1, transgene persistence was observed in 95% of subjects on Day 29 and 
63% (5 of 8 subjects) on Day 90.  In cohort 3, persistence of JCAR017 transgene was observed in 100% 
of subjects (10 of 10 subjects) on Day 29 and 100% (7 of 7 subjects) on Day 90. 33% on day 180. No 
important difference in persistence was observed across cohorts through Day 90. 
Manufacturing process aspects 
JCAR017 manufacturing process suffered changes during the course of the development as well as the 
manufacturing of the viral vector. The proposed commercial manufacturing process version 4 (v4), was 
derived from iterative improvements and optimisation of the precommercial processes, designated v2 
and v3.  
The Clinical Outcomes Across Manufacturing Process Versions (CLOVER) analysis was performed on the 
DLBCL qPCR PK Set (DL1S and DL2S), in order to evaluate the impact of manufacturing process changes 
on clinical and PK outcomes. Key safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic (PK) outcomes were compared 
between  the  precommercial  processes  (v2  and  V3)  and  the  proposed  commercial  process  (v4).  In 
addition,  within  the  proposed  commercial  process,  the  clinical  and  PK  outcomes  data  for  subjects 
receiving v4 product manufactured with lentiviral vector from two different vector manufacturing sites 
(vector manufacturing processes v.1.0 and v.1.2 - see quality section above) were also compared. 
The persistence of JCAR017 transgene was one of the objectives in the CLOVER report in order to assess 
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022  
Page 43/252 
 
 
 
 
 
if differences occurred based on manufacturing process and vector manufacturing site. The persistence 
of JCAR017 transgene in the peripheral blood is defined as a transgene count greater than or equal to 
the limit of detection (LOD) of 5 copies per reaction. No definitive difference in persistence was observed 
between v2, v3 and v4 through Day 545. Persistence data with v4 were limited on Day 730 due to the 
shorter follow-up for v4 subjects. No definitive difference in persistence was observed between v4 vector 
manufacturing sites through Day 270. Comparisons of persistence data after Day 270 were limited due 
to the small number of subjects with available data for vector manufactured as v.1.2 as well as their 
shorter follow-up.  
Non-conforming products 
Of  the  344  subjects  in  the  DLBCL  Cohort  who  underwent  leukapheresis,  25  subjects  received 
nonconforming product and were not included in the DLBCL Cohort JCAR017-Treated Analysis Set. Nine 
(9) of these subjects were assigned to DL1S and 16 were assigned to DL2S. A nonconforming product 
was defined as any product wherein a cell component did not meet a release specification limit. However 
a nonconforming product was allowed to be released under the following conditions: 1) only specified 
attributes  that  were  out  of  specification  would  have  been  considered  for  an  “exception  release” 
recommendation  and  excluded  failures  due  to  any  product  safety  attribute;  2)  only  a  single  out-of-
specification attribute may have been considered for exception release, as long as it fell within the limits 
outlined within the JCAR017 PPDP; 3) agreement on the acceptable benefit-risk assessment. Ten (10) 
patients in Study 017001 received CD8+ cell component only, 3 received CD4+ cell component only, 12 
received both cell components with one cell component not meeting one of the following specifications: 
potency (5), purity (1), sterility (1), viability (5). In cases where the subject was treated with only one 
drug product cell component (CD8+ or CD4+ CAR+ T cells), they were infused with half of the assigned 
dose,  using  the  conforming  cell  component.  In  the  Study  BCM-001,  6  patients  received  both  non-
conforming cell components. 
Dose-proportionality 
The  relationship  between  log-transformed  cellular  kinetic  parameters  Cmax,  AUC0-28d,  and  total  cell 
JCAR0017 dose are explored using scatter plot and linear regression in the DOVER report (study 017001). 
In the phase 1 study 017001, JCAR017 was administered at 4 dose levels: DL1S=50 x 106 CAR+T cells, 
single dose regimen (N=45), DL2S= 100 x 106 CAR+T cells, single dose regimen (N=177), DL3S= 150 
x 106 CAR+T cells, single dose regimen (N=41) and DL1D= 50 x 106 CAR+T cells, 2 dose regimen (N=6). 
The second dose was administered 14 days after the first dose. No difference is shown in the exposure 
in terms of Cmax and AUC0-28 after administration of three different single dose levels.  
Considerable inter-subject variability in PK parameters was observed in both studies (see section below 
for the target population). As reported in the popPK the BSV (between subjects variability) for the Cmax 
was 93%. 
Time-dependency 
According to the SmPC, the product is intended for administration of a single one time dose only.  
In the report JCAR017-017001-ClinPharm, JCAR017 transgene PK parameters for the DLBCL Cohort after 
retreatment (N = 15) or an additional cycle (N = 7) are provided. In the 2-dose schedule (DL1D), the 
second dose did not provide a distinguishable increase in Cmax and AUC0-28 from the first dose. Cmax 
and AUC0-28 after an additional cycle or retreatment appeared to be lower compared with those after 
the first dose.  
Target population 
The proposed target population for Breyanzi treatment includes adult patients with relapsed or refractory 
large B-cell lymphoma including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), primary mediastinal large B-cell 
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022  
Page 44/252 
 
 
 
lymphoma (PMBCL) and follicular lymphoma grade 3B (FL3B) after at least two prior therapies. PK data 
is available for DLBCL cohort only in Study 017001 and for adult subjects with aggressive B-cell NHL 
enrolled in BCM-001 study.  
JCAR017 accounts for a combination pack including the CD4+ cell component and CD8+ cell component 
administered in sequence. The infusion foresees the administration of a 1:1 CD4+:CD8+ cell components 
ratio. 
The volume of each cell component to administer is calculated by dividing the target dose by the viable 
cell  concentration  (in  cell  per  ml)  and  the  transduction  frequency.  The  transduction  frequency  was 
reported  in  a  different  way  within  the  indirect  method  (based  on  surface  expression  of  EGFRt  as  a 
surrogate for CAR expression) and direct method (based on anti-idiotype antibody to directly measure 
surface  expression  of  CAR).  A  transition  to  measurement  of  transduction  frequency  with  direct  CAR 
detection was initiated within the proposed commercial manufacturing process (v4). 
The indirect method was used for all but 2 (261/263) subjects in study 017001. For the mentioned 2 
subjects,  the  direct  method  was  used.  Since  the  indirect  method  overestimate  the  transduction 
frequency, this results in a variability in the calculation of the administered dose used in study 017001 
compared to the dose calculated with the direct method. A dosing variance explanatory report (DOVER) 
was  performed  to  assess  the  clinical  impact  of  variability  of  administered  dose  and  CD4+:CD8+  cell 
components ratio using analyses that characterise relationships between key clinical efficacy and safety 
outcomes and PK parameters from Study 017001 and both the administered dose and the CD4+:CD8+ 
cell components ratio of JCAR017.  
The  administered  dose  in  245/263  subjects  in  study  017001  was  retrospectively  calculated  with  the 
transduction frequency measured with the direct method. This results in a median administered dose of 
50.1 × 10^6 CAR+ viable T cells (range: 43.9 × 106, 56.0 × 106) for DL1S, 91.1 × 106 CAR+ viable T 
cells (range: 45.3 × 106, 120.0 × 106) for DL2S, and 128.9 × 106 CAR+ viable T cells (range: 86.6 × 
106, 156.0 × 106) for DL3S. Consequently, the ratio CD4+:CD8+ was also recalculated and ranged from 
0.73 to 2.20, varying from the target of 1:1, although for 94% ranged between 0.73 and 1.3. In terms 
of PK parameters, the linear regression analyses showed a potential association between PK parameters 
and the CD4+:CD8+ ratio. However, a 0.2 increase in CD4+:CD8+ ratio would translate in a decrease 
of Cmax and AUC0-28 of just 23% and 22%.  
Special populations 
In  Study  017001  the  relationship  between  PK  parameters  (Cmax,  AUC0-28  and  Tmax)  and  baseline 
characteristics such as age, race, sex, body weight, BMI was evaluated in the DLBCL Cohort in the qPCR 
PK  analysis  set.  Gender,  race,  sex,  body  weight  and  BMI  did  not  demonstrate  to  have  a  significant 
relationship with the PK parameters.  
Study BMC-001 enrolled European and Japanese subjects administered with 100x10^6 CAR-T cells dose; 
although data are merely descriptive, the Cohort 2 (Japanese) showed median values of Cmax and AUC0-
28 higher than Cohort 1, but the Q1 and Q3 values are completely included in those of Cohort 1. 
According to the results based on the latest data (cut-off date: 19Jun2020 for both studies), patients 
aged 65-74 were 77 in Study 017001 and 17 in Study BCM001; patients aged 75-84 were 24 in Study 
017001 and 0 in BCM001; only one patient aged 85+ was enrolled in Study 017001. Patients <65 years 
old (N=145) had a 2.93-fold and 2.35-fold higher median Cmax and AUC0-28d, respectively, compared 
to patients ≥ 65 years old considering data from Study 017001. The SmPC was updated accordingly.  
Other baseline characteristics were evaluated to assess a possible relationship with JCAR017 PK. Subjects 
with a high baseline tumour burden (measured by the sum of product of the perpendicular diameters 
[SPD]  or  high  serum  lactate  dehydrogenase  [LDH;  ≥  500  U/L]  prior  to  the  start  of  lymphodepletion) 
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022

showed increase in some or all PK parameters. Subjects with an SPD per IRC prior to LDC of ≥ 50 cm2 
(N = 59) had a 2.46-fold and 2.88-fold higher median Cmax and AUC0-28, respectively, compared to 
subjects with an SPD per IRC prior to LDC of < 50 cm2 (N = 174). Subjects with an LDH prior to LDC of 
≥ 500 U/L (N = 47) showed a longer Tmax (14 vs 11 days) compared with subjects with < 500 U/L (N 
= 198).  
No dedicated studies were performed in impaired renal and hepatic subjects and it is acceptable due to 
the nature of the medicinal product. 
No data are available in children since the intended indication is only in adult patients. 
Drug-drug interactions 
No in vitro and in vivo studies were performed with JCAR017 due to the nature of the product. 
In Study 017001 the effect of tocilizumab and/or corticosteroid use for treatment of CRS or iiNT on PK 
parameters was evaluated.  
Subjects treated with tocilizumab (N = 47) had a 4.15-fold and 4.06-fold higher median Cmax and AUC0-
28, respectively, compared to subjects who did not receive tocilizumab (N = 198) (Cmax, 78,748.2 vs. 
18,963.5  copies/μg,  p  <  0.0001;  AUC0-28,  662,966.5  vs.  163,410.4  day*copies/μg,  p  <  0.0001). 
Median tmax of subjects with and without tocilizumab was 10.0 and 12.5 days, respectively (p = 0.2724). 
Subjects who received corticosteroids (N = 46) had a 4.39-fold and 3.90-fold higher median Cmax and 
AUC0-28, respectively, compared with subjects who did not receive corticosteroids (N = 199) (Cmax, 
85,563.5 vs. 19,481.9 copies/μg, p < 0.0001; AUC0-28, 647,537.1 vs. 166,162.7 day*copies/μg, p < 
0.0001). Median tmax of subjects with and without corticosteroids was 11.0 and 12.0 days, 
respectively (p = 0.6665). 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
JCAR017  is  a  CD19-directed  genetically  modified  autologous  cellular  immunotherapy  consisting  of 
purified CD8-positive and CD4-positive T cells.  
CAR binding to CD19 expressed on the cell surface of tumour and normal B cells induces activation and 
proliferation of CAR T cells, release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and cytotoxic killing of target cells. 
Biomarkers 
Pharmacodynamic  variables  including  soluble  biomarkers,  C-reactive  protein  (CRP),  ferritin,  B-cell 
aplasia (defined as CD19+ B-cells < 3% of peripheral blood lymphocytes) and serum immunoglobulins 
(Ig) were summarised descriptively. 
Soluble biomarkers 
In the study 017001, peripheral blood plasma samples were collected at different points. Plasma samples 
were  collected  prior  to lymphodepleting  chemotherapy  (LDC),  immediately  prior  to  JCAR017  infusion, 
and at various timepoints after JCAR017 infusion. Only the samples collected up to Day 29 were analysed 
in Clinical Pharmacology Report.  
A total of 41 soluble biomarkers were measured as an exploratory endpoint.  In Study 017001, soluble 
biomarkers  in  plasma,  such  as  interleukin-6  (IL-6),  IL-8,  IL-10,  macrophage  inflammatory  protein  1 
alpha  (MIP1alpha,  tumour  necrosis  factor  alpha  (TNF  alpha,  and  interferon  gamma  (IFN  gamma, 
generally peaked within 14 days after JCAR017 infusion and returned to baseline (defined as the last 
Assessment report

assessment  prior  to  JCAR017  infusion)  levels  within  28  days  after  infusion.  Peak  levels  of  11  soluble 
biomarkers were positively associated with Cmax and AUC0-28. 
CRP and Ferritin 
Serum CRP and ferritin are both acute phase reactants and the baseline values have been associated 
with increased risk of CRS and iiNT after JCAR017 administration (Siddiqi, 2017).  
C-reactive protein and ferritin were measured at the clinical laboratory at each clinical study centre. 
In the study 017001, serum CRP was elevated on Day 1 prior to infusion and decreased approximately 
80% within the first 28 days after infusion. Serum ferritin was elevated at baseline and levels remained 
relatively unchanged during the first 28 days after JCAR017 infusion. 
In  Study  BCM-001,  in  Cohort  1,  serum  CRP  was  elevated  on  Day  1  prior  to  infusion  and  decreased 
approximately 90% within the first 28 days after infusion. Similar observations were observed in Cohort 
3  within  the  first  21  days  after  JCAR017  infusion.  Serum  ferritin  was  elevated  at  baseline  and  levels 
remained relatively unchanged during the first 28 days after JCAR017 infusion for Cohort 1 and Cohort 
3 (CSR BCM-001, Section 11.6.3). 
B-Cell Aplasia 
B-cell aplasia was evident at baseline n 92% of the DLBCL Cohort with a single dose schedule in Study 
017001, in 98% of subjects on Day 29, in 93% on Day 90, in 86% on Day 180, and in 73% on Day 365, 
without a relevant difference among the different dose levels in Study 017001. 
In Cohort 1 of BCM-001, B-cell aplasia was evident in 93% at baseline, 100% on Day 29, in 100% on 
Day 90, in 86% on Day 180, and in 75% on Day 270.  
No apparent difference in B-cell aplasia was observed across studies. B-cell aplasia data in Study BCM-
001 were limited after Day 180 due to the median on-study follow-up time of 3.38 months. 
In  Study  017001,  hypogammaglobulinaemia  (ie,  immunoglobulin  G  [IgG]<500mg/dL)  was  present  in 
49% of the DLBCL Cohort with a single-dose schedule in the JCAR017 at baseline, in 58% on Day 29, 
and  in  61%  on  Day  365.  No  clear  difference  in  hypogammaglobulinaemia  was  observed  among  the 
different dose levels in Study 017001. In Cohort 1 of Study BCM-001, the percentage of subjects with 
hypogammaglobulinaemia was 56% at baseline, 65% on Day 29 and 63% on Day 180. 
Immunogenicity  
Formation of ATA to the extracellular domain of JCAR017 was evaluated in plasma samples for Study 
017001 using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. The same assay format was used for Study 
BCM-001 with serum as matrix. In both studies a multi-tiered approach was used to evaluate ATA that 
included a screening assay, a confirmatory assay, and a titre assay.  
In Study 017001 prevalence and incidence of ATA was 11% and 14%, respectively. 
There were no clear differences in the prevalence and incidence of ATA among the different dose levels. 
Cmax and AUC0-28 were higher in subjects who had pre-existing ATA compared with subjects who did 
not  have  pre-existing  ATA;  similarly,  Cmax  was  higher  for  subjects  who  had  treatment-induced  or 
treatment-boosted  ATA  compared  with  subjects  who  did  not  have  treatment-induced  or  treatment-
boosted ATA and the same trend although less pronounced was observed for AUC0-28. However, these 
PK parameters exhibited considerable inter-subject variability with a wide range of values and it should 
also consider that the number of subjects who had pre-existing ATA, treatment-induced or treatment-
boosted ATA, is smaller compared to subjects who did not have pre-existing ATA or subjects who did not 
have treatment-induced or treatment-boosted ATA.

There were no clear differences in efficacy and safety outcomes between subjects with or without pre-
existing ATA. Similarly, no clear differences in safety were observed between subjects with or without 
treatment-induced or treatment-boosted ATA.  
It  is  of  note  that  higher  ORR  and  CR  rate  were  observed  in  subjects  who  had  treatment-induced  or 
treatment-boosted ATA. 
The  presence of  ATAs  against  JCAR017 is  similar  between the pre-commercial  (v2  and  v3)  processes 
versus proposed commercial process (v4) and between vector manufacturing sites. 
Updated  immunogenicity  results  from  Studies  017001  and  BCM-001  based  on  longer  follow-up  data 
(data cut-off date: 19 Jun 2020), including the analyses to investigate the potential relationship between 
ATA status and efficacy, safety and PK in Study 017001 were submitted with Day120 LoQs responses 
and compared with the original results based on earlier cutoff date (data cut-off date: 12 Aug 2019 for 
Study 017001 and 13 Sep 2019 for Study BCM-001). Overall, treatment induced ATA (induced or boosted 
by the treatment) was low, and they were slightly higher in 017001 (15.6%) than in BCM-001 study 
(9.1%) at the DCO 19 Jun 2020. 
Expansion  parameters  (Cmax  and  AUC0-28)  based  on  qPCR  were  summarised  by  prevalence  and 
incidence of ATA in the DLBCL Cohort of Study 017001. The results were consistent with those in the 
original analyses COD: 12 Aug 2019). Patients who had pre-existing ATA had a higher Cmax (prevalence 
of ATA: transgene Cmax 44867.0 copies/µg, incidence of ATA: transgene Cmax 31172.5 copies/µg) and 
AUC0-28 (prevalence of ATA: transgene AUC0-28 403257.0 day*copies/µg; incidence of ATA: transgene 
AUC0-28 214156.2 day*copies/µg) (as determined by qPCR or flow cytometry) in study 017001 (DLBCL 
cohort).  
At  the  updated  COD,  there  was  no  apparent  relationship  between  the  incidence  of  ATAs  (treatment-
induced or treatment-boosted) and the Cmax and AUC0-28.  
For patients with treatment-induced antibodies, persistence data indicate a steeper decline after D28 in 
subjects who develop ATAs than in subjects who did not; similar results were observed using qPCR and 
flowcytometry. 
Replication-competent virus 
A replication-incompetent self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vector has been used (see quality and pre-
clinical part). Replication-competent lentivirus (RCL) testing was performed using qPCR to detect viral 
vector  envelope  sequences  on  DNA  obtained  by  a  peripheral  blood  draw.  Testing  for  RCL  used  an 
analytically-qualified qPCR-assay that was performed at a central laboratory. RCL in the blood was tested 
in 208 subjects for the DLBCL Cohort in the JCAR017-treated Analysis Set in the Study 017001, in 12 on 
Day 90 and 7 on Day 180 in Cohort 1 and in 5 on Day 90 and 3 on Day 180 in Cohort 3 of the Study 
BCM-001. No RCL has been detected in any of the tested samples. 
False Positive HIV Tests 
Treatment  with  lentiviral-derived  CAR  T  cells  has  been  reported  to  result  in  false  positive  human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) PCR nucleic acid amplification test results (Ariza-Heredia, 2017; Laetsch, 
2018). Lentiviral vectors, such as those used for manufacturing JCAR017, contain portions of the HIV 
viral  genome  that  are  integrated  into  the  genomes  of  cells  transfected  by  these  vectors.  Human 
immunodeficiency virus nucleic acid amplification tests and HIV viral load testing can be falsely positive 
and may not reflect true HIV infection. Such false positive screening tests can most often be resolved 
using  a  fourth  generation  HIV  screening  assay  that  detects  both  HIV-1  antibodies  and  p24  antigens. 
SmPC contains statement that treatment with lentiviral-derived CAR T cells has the potential to interfere 
with HIV serology testing.

Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic Relationships  
Relationships  between  PK  parameters  (log10  transformed  Cmax,  log10  transformed  AUC0-28,  and 
untransformed tmax) and baseline or peak levels of soluble biomarkers, CRP, and ferritin were evaluated 
in subjects in the DLBCL Cohort on a single-dose schedule in the qPCR PK Analysis Set. After adjustment 
for  multiplicity,  the  following  relationships  were  observed  at  the  p  <  0.05  level:  1)  AUC0-28  versus 
baseline transforming growth factor β3 (TGFβ3) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α ; 2) tmax versus 
baseline IL-5, IL-7, IL-15, and ferritin; 3) Cmax versus peak levels of IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-
10, IL-13, TNFα, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP) 1, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) 
1α, and MIP1β; 4) AUC0-28 versus peak levels of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 17 (CCL17), IFNγ, IL-2, 
IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-16, TNFα, MCP1, MIP1α,MIP1β, vascular cell adhesion molecule 
1 (VCAM1), and ferritin; 5) tmax versus peak levels of IL-7, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-
D, and ferritin. 
No relationships were observed with p < 0.05 between any baseline soluble biomarkers and Cmax. 
Pharmacokinetic-Efficacy Relationships  
All analyses were based on subjects for the DLBCL Cohort with a single-dose schedule that were in both 
the JCAR017-treated Efficacy Analysis Set and the qPCR PK Analysis Set. Efficacy variables examined for 
their relationship to JCAR017 PK parameters included BOR, DOR, and PFS per IRC.  
As  general  comment,  higher  Cmax  and  AUC0-28  were  associated  with  CR  and/or  PR  and  longer  PFS. 
Responders (N=179) had 3.55-fold and 2.72-fold higher median Cmax (p < 0.0001) and AUC0-28 (p < 
0.0001),  respectively,  than  non-responders  (N=53).  Median  tmax  of  responders  and  non-responders 
was 11.0 and 14.0 days, respectively. Complete responders (N=133) had 1.65-fold and 1.51-fold higher 
median  Cmax  (p=0.0175)  and  AUC0-28  (p=0.0707),  respectively,  than  non-complete  responders 
(N=99). Median tmax of complete responders and non-complete responders was 11.0 and 14.0 days, 
respectively.  A  unit  of  log10  increase  in  Cmax  and  AUC0-28  was  associated  with  a  25%  and  22% 
reduction in the hazard of relapse or death for DOR, respectively. A unit of log10 increase in Cmax and 
AUC0-28  was  associated  with  a  41%  and  38%  reduction  in  the  hazard  of  relapse  or  death  for  PFS, 
respectively. 
Pharmacokinetic-Safety Relationships  
Safety variables examined for their relationship to JCAR017 PK parameters included CRS and iiNT as well 
as tocilizumab and corticosteroids used to treat CRS or iiNT. All analyses were based on subjects in the 
DLBCL Cohort on a single-dose schedule that were in the qPCR PK Analysis Set. Higher Cmax and AUC0-
28 were associated with higher incidence of any grade CRS, any grade iiNT, Grade ≥ 3 iiNT, Grade ≥3 
infection and tocilizumab and/or corticosteroid usage for the treatment of CRS or iiNT.  Subjects with 
any  grade  CRS  (N=99)  had  2.29-fold  and  2.36-fold  higher  median  Cmax  (p  =  0.0003)  and  AUC0-28 
(p<0.001), respectively, than subjects without any grade CRS (N=146). The number of subjects with 
Grade≥3 CRS analysed in the qPCR PK Analysis Set was too small (N=5) to establish a relationship with 
PK.  Subjects with any grade iiNT (N=72) had a 3.34-fold and 3.77-fold higher median Cmax (p<0.001) 
and AUC0-28 (p<0.001), respectively, compared with subjects who did not have any grade iiNT (N=173).  
Subjects  with  Grade  ≥3  iiNT  (N=20)  had  a  5.04-and  5.92-fold  higher  median  Cmax  (p=0.0002)  and 
AUC0-28 (p<0.001), respectively, compared with subjects with Grade 0-2 iiNT (N=225).  Subjects with 
Grade ≥3 infection (N=18 for subjects treated at DL2S) had a 3.05-fold and 2.72-fold higher median 
Cmax and AUC0-28, respectively, compared with subjects with Grade 0-2 infection (N=150 for subjects 
treated at DL2S). As similar trend was observed for subjects treated at DL3S. For subjects treated at

DL1S  this  trend  was  not  observed,  however  sample  size  of  subjects  with  grade  ≥  3  infection  was 
considered too small (n = 3) to allow a definite conclusion. Subjects treated with tocilizumab (N=47) 
had  a  4.15-fold  and  4.06-fold  higher  median  Cmax  (p<0.001)  and  AUC0-28  (p<0.001),  respectively 
compared  with  subjects  who  did  not  receive  tocilizumab  (N=198).  Similarly,  subjects  who  received 
corticosteroids  (N=46)  had  a  4.39-fold  and  3.90-fold  higher  median  Cmax  (p<0.001)  and  AUC0-28 
(p<0.001), respectively, compared with subjects who did not receive corticosteroid (N=199 ). 
Pharmacodynamic-Efficacy Relationships  
Baseline and peak levels of 41 soluble biomarkers, CRP, and ferritin were evaluated for their possible 
relationship with BOR (responders vs. non-responders) in the DLBCL Cohort with a JCAR017 single-dose 
schedule of the JCAR017-treated Efficacy Analysis Set.  
Pharmacodynamic-Safety Relationships 
A total of 41 soluble biomarkers were evaluated for their possible relationship with CRS and iiNT in the 
DLBCL Cohort with a JCAR017 single-dose schedule of the JCAR017-treated. Baseline levels of ICAM1, 
IL-6, MIP1α, SAA1, and TNFα were associated with CRS. Baseline levels of ICAM1, IL-6, IL-10, MIP1α, 
SAA1, TNFα, and VCAM1 were associated with iiNT. Baseline levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and MIP1α were 
associated with Grade≥3 iiNT.  Subjects with any grade CRS (N = 110) had a 3.23-fold and 1.83-fold 
higher median baseline CRP and ferritin levels, respectively, compared with subjects who did not have 
CRS  (N  =  152)  (CRP,  53.9  vs.  16.7  mg/L,  p  =  0.0008;  ferritin,  745.5  vs.  406.6  μg/L,  p  =  0.0267).  
Subjects with any grade iiNT (N = 79) had a 3.01-fold and 1.85-fold higher median baseline CRP and 
ferritin levels, respectively, compared with subjects who did not have iiNT (N = 183) (CRP, 59.6 vs. 19.8 
mg/L, p=0.0068; ferritin, 782.0vs. 421.6 μg/L, p = 0.0584). Subjects with Grade ≥ 3 iiNT (N = 26) had 
a 2.91-fold and 3.32-fold higher median baseline CRP and ferritin levels, respectively, compared with 
subjects with Grade 0–2 iiNT (N = 236) (CRP, 68.4 vs. 23.5mg/L, p=0.0557; ferritin, 1521.5vs. 458.5 
μg/L, p = 0.0128) 
Mechanism of action 
Breyanzi is a CD19-directed genetically modified autologous cellular immunotherapy administered as a 
defined  composition  to  reduce  variability  in  CD8+  and  CD4+  T  cell  dose.  The  CAR  is  comprised  of  a 
murine FMC63 monoclonal antibody-derived single chain variable fragment (scFv), IgG4 hinge region, 
CD28 transmembrane domain, 4-1BB (CD137) costimulatory domain, and CD3 zeta activation domain. 
CD3 zeta signalling is critical for initiating T-cell activation and antitumour activity, while 4 - 1BB (CD137) 
signalling enhances the expansion and persistence of Breyanzi. 
CAR binding to CD19 expressed on the cell surface of tumour and normal B cells induces activation and 
proliferation of CAR T cells, release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and cytotoxic killing of target cells. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Bioanalytical methods 
Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was employed either to quantify the presence 
of replication-competent virus (RCL) or the residual vector copy number (VCN) in CAR-T cells in patients 
at different times of treatment. Overall, considering the heterogeneity of human samples, their limited 
availability  for  technical  replicates  and  the  outlier  criteria  applied  to  samples  falling  between  QC1  an 
LLOQ, the method was adequately validated.

The ISR was only performed for study 017001 samples. Only 3% of the number of samples have been 
reanalysed (instead of 5% min) and the concentration obtained by reanalysis are within 35% of their 
mean for at least 67% of the repeats instead of 30% as required in the guideline on bioanalytical method 
validation.  Although  the  results  are  not  in  accordance  with  the  EMA  Guideline,  this  issue  will  not  be 
pursued  considering  that  Breyanzi  is  not  plasma  protein  bound,  no  back  conversion  from  unknown 
metabolites is expected and no effect of sample inhomogeneity or concomitant medications is expected. 
Therefore, the method accuracy and precision can be confirmed without ISR. 
The  expansion  and  persistence  of  CAR  T-Cells  and  CD19  positive  B  Cells  in  patient  samples  was  also 
evaluated  by  flow  cytometry  analysis.  This  method  poses  particular  validation  challenges  due  to  the 
complexity of cellular measures, the lack of reference materials, and the fact that data are not derived 
from a calibration curve. Although analytical parameters met the acceptance criteria, some clarifications 
were  requested  regarding  the  impact  of  haemolyzed,  lipemic,  or  clotted  samples  and  additionally, 
interference  coming  from  protein-based  immunotherapies  targeting  cell  surface  molecules  on  flow 
cytometry selectivity/specificity. No validation was performed in this regard, but visual inspection was 
used to identify and exclude compromised samples. Since no significant difference is observed between 
PK  parameters  obtained  by  qPCR  and  flow  cytometry  analyses,  the  risk  of  relevant  interference  is 
considered limited.  
When the two methods for CAR-T measure are compared it is noted that CAR-T expansion measured 
with qPCR analysis and flow cytometry correlates only partially. Although peak values are reached at 12 
days for qPCR and 11 days for flow cytometry the persistence of transgene/CAR-T population is measured 
consistently only with qPCR. Flow cytometry analysis in study BCM-001 shows that effective expansion 
of CAR-T+ population is reached only partially, and many patients display CAR-T low values (LOD of 0.1 
cells/μL  of  blood  with  at  least  25  events)  at  11  days  which  drop  after  few  days,  as  compared  with 
published studies on CAR-T drug products (Demaret et al. Clinical cytometry 2020; Kalos et al. Sci Transl 
Med.  2011).  Differences  between  the  two  methods  rely  on  the  small  sample  size  and/or  on  different 
sensitivity for the qPCR and flow cytometry assays. Based on the fact that the trend of the two assays 
was  similar  and  that  pharmacokinetic  analyses  in  both  studies  017001  and  BCM-001  were  based 
principally  on  qPCR  for  transgene  expression,  which  is  more  reliable,  while  the  flow  cytometry 
assessments were used only as exploratory and supportive data, the data are considered validated. 
An interferon (INF) gamma enzyme-linked immunospot assay was used for the detection of INF-gamma 
producing  T-cells  in  response  to  the  extracellular  domain  (ECD)  of  JCAR017  in  order  to  test  its 
immunogenicity (Report JCAR017-dmpk-2949). Some problems were evidenced regarding the linearity 
of  the  assay,  nevertheless  the  evidenced  lack  of  linearity  is  not  considered  limiting  according  to  the 
following considerations: data provided show that patient samples exhibit very low or undetectable levels 
of  cytokine  release  from  a  single  cell;  cellular  immunogenicity  analysis  for  this  product  is  considered 
exploratory and not intended to support any interpretation of the clinical observations. 
The  formation  of  anti-therapeutic  antibody  (ATA)  against  the  extracellular  domain  of  JCAR017  was 
evaluated in plasma and serum by an ECL-based immunoassay in studies JCAR017 and BCM-001. The 
bioanalytical  methods  were  found  suitable  for  their  intended  use  for  most  aspects.  Further 
characterisation  data  for  the  positive  controls  used  (JCAR017  anti-idiotype  monoclonal  antibody  and 
affinity purified rabbit polyclonal anti-JCAR017 ECD antibody) were provided and clarified that different 
method for the characterisation of the affinities of the positive controls have been used due to the nature 
of the positive control (polyclonal Ab vs. monoclonal Ab). A dissociation constant (Kd) was determined 
for  JCAR017  anti-ID  monoclonal  antibody  (0.327  nM),  whereas,  given  that  the  rabbit  polyclonal  anti-
JCAR017 positive control contains multiple clones with varying specificities, an EC50 is considered more 
appropriate.  The  EC50  value  (0.37  nM)  is  an  average  of  the  different  clones  that  are  present  in  the 
polyclonal preparation.

It has been clarified that the median of the NC replicates (n=3) was used to calculate the PSCP to reduce 
the need for formal outlier evaluation.  
Long-term stability data for the positive control spiked at HPC and LPC have been provided. The vast 
majority of the study samples from studies 017001 and BCM-001 were covered by the provided data. It 
is agreed that long-term frozen storage stability evaluation of the surrogate PC is unnecessary. 
The applicant has further discussed the reliability of the cut points used for study sample analysis in the 
study JCAR017-BCM-001 and the false positive error rate is inside the recommended 2-11% range. 
The  method  for  cytokines  measurement  meets  the  criteria  for  precision,  accuracy,  dynamic  range, 
sensitivity, matrix effect, specificity and stability. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Following infusion, JCAR017 exhibited an initial expansion followed by a bi-exponential decline which is 
common for the different CAR T cells products currently available. The bi-phasic decay was identified by 
means of the transgene model, decay which can be missed with a non-compartmental approach using a 
short interval data (e.g. 28 days). It was observed that the AUC0-90 is only slightly higher than median 
AUC0-28 in Studies 017001 and BCM-001 (ration AUC0-90/AUC0-28= 1.24 and 1.14, respectively) and 
that further increases in AUC was not observed from AUC0-90 to AUC0-180 (ratio AUC0-180/AUC0-90 
=  1.04  in  Study  017001  and  1.02 in  Study  BCM001),  and  from  AUC0-180 to AUC0-270  (ratio  AUC0-
270/AUC0-180  =  1.01  in  Study  017001  and  1.02  in  Study  BCM001).  It  confirms  that  the  proposed 
exposure period (Days 1 – 29) captured sufficiently the cell expansion phase and adequately reflected 
the overall exposure.  
Only 3% (7/247) of subjects in Study 017001 and 2% (1/44) of subjects in Study BCM-001 had tmax 
longer  than  28  days.  Of  these  7  subjects  in  Study  017001,  4  subjects  had  tmax  of  29  days  and  one 
subject had tmax of 30 days. Thus, most subjects in both studies had tmax within the first month. The 
potential of a second peak of expansion after day 29 can be excluded based on the data available. The 
relationship  between  Cmax  and  efficacy  or  safety  endpoints  was  evaluated  in  Study  017001  and  the 
results included Cmax occurring after Day 29 and took them into consideration.  
Population PK analysis 
The  cellular  kinetics  model  report  is  only  explorative  and  considered  of  low  regulatory  impact.  The 
objectives were to characterise the kinetics of JCAR017 transgene to permit estimation of the systemic 
exposures to JCAR017 and to understand covariates that might influence JCAR017 kinetics in individual 
subjects. 
Population-predicted (PRED) and individual-predicted (IPRE) JCAR017 transgene levels versus observed 
(DV) JCAR017 transgene levels for the structural model shows that there is an agreement for individual-
predicted  versus  individual  observed  values.  However,  it  is  noted  that  this  is  not  completely  true  for 
population predicted versus individual observed values. This suggest that the model predictions are in 
agreement with those that it is observed in a single individual, but it could not be able to give a good 
prediction on the overall population. This can be due to the high variability in cell expansion between 
individuals. 
In the final model the population-predicted (PRED) and individual-predicted (IPRE) JCAR017 transgene 
levels  versus  observed  (DV)  JCAR017  transgene  levels  and  conditional  weighted  residuals  (CWRES) 
versus time after dose and population-predicted (PRED) showed a better agreement between the model 
predictions  and  observations  respect  to  the  basal  model  and  this  is  likely  due  to  the  introduction  of 
covariates into the model that partially contain the high inter-subject variability.

The final popPK model included several covariates as described above  
The modelling is adequately described and the proposed application are mostly related to exclusion of 
significant covariate effects on relevant PK parameters. For descriptive purposes, the steps described for 
model  building  and  evaluation  are  considered  overall  State  of  the  art  and  consistent  with  the 
requirements in the EMA guideline.  
The Visual Predictive Check indicate that the model adequately describes the clinical data, with only a 
tendence  to  slightly  under  predict  the  higher  concentration  of  JCAR017  transgene  at  later  time  point 
after  infusion.  The  effect  of  covariates  is  overall  well  contained  within  the  residual  between-subject 
variability. 
Manufacturing process aspects 
From a PK point of view, data from v2 and v3 process were compared to v4 data and, although v4 seems 
to show lower exposure in terms of Cmax and AUC0-28, the exposure ranges are largely overlapped and 
a large CV is observed. Further comparison of data from v3 process (without data from v2) to v4 data 
was conducted, supporting similar PK expansion and persistence parameters with overlapping IQR and 
ranges. Regarding the exposure reached in v4 process, with both vector manufacturing process v1.0 and 
v1.2,Cmax and AUC0-28 for v1.2are lower than with v1.0, but also in this case the variability is high, 
the number of subjects treated with v1.2were low and no conclusion can be drawn on the actual impact 
of the vector manufacturing process on JCAR017 exposure.  In study BCM-001, lower Cmax an AUC0-
28 was also observed with the commercial vector subgroup (N=7, Cmax 17201 copies/µg, median Tmax 
14  days  and  median  AUC0-28  108043  day*copies/µg)  compared  to  the  v1.2vector  subgroup  (N=29, 
Cmax 29275 copies/µg, Tmax 19 days and AUC0-28 265403 day*copies/µg ), but also in this case IQRs 
were overlapping and the sample sizes were very small, not allowing to make a definite conclusion on 
differences in PK parameters for product manufactured using different vectors. 
The available PK parameters with the commercial vector were also lower compared to the v1.0 vector 
(28817 copies/µg, 11 days and 244238 day*copies/µg).  
Comparison  between  PK  data  from  subjects  receiving  conforming  product  and  subjects  receiving  the 
nonconforming product, showed that mean Cmax and AUC0-28 for subject treated with nonconforming 
product  are  lower,  however  the  range  of  exposure  in  both  categories  are  very  large  and  overlapped. 
From  a  PK  point  of  view,  this  data  is  not  informative  to  point  out  a  difference  in  exposure  between 
subjects treated with conforming product and those treated with nonconforming product. 
Dose-proportionality 
Based on data available on 4 dose levels administered in Study 017001, no difference is shown in the 
exposure in terms of Cmax and AUC0-28 after administration of three different single dose levels. A high 
variability in Cmax and AUC0-28 is observed within each dose level. This high variability is linked to the 
capacity of JCAR017 to proliferate and no conclusion can be drawn on the dose-proportionality. Some 
subjects  (N=6)  were  administered  with  a  second  dose  after  14  days,  without  a  second  LDC,  and  the 
Cmax and AUC0-28 seems to be lower after the second dose, however due to low number of subjects 
and the high variability, it cannot be possible to clearly determine the effect of a second dose. Fifteen 
and seven subjects were retreated and had additional cycles; in this case subjects repeat the complete 
LDC.  In  these  subjects  JCAR017  median  Cmax  and  AUC0-28  are  lower  compared  to  the  single 
administration,  however  the  low  number of  subject  and  the unknown  burden  of  the  disease  prior the 
retreatment/additional cycle did not permit to draw conclusion on the effect of additional cycles. 
Considerable inter-subject variability in PK parameters was observed in both studies. As reported in the 
popPK the BSV (between subjects variability) for the Cmax was 93%.

For patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 
(DLBCL), primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) and follicular lymphoma grade 3B (FL3B) 
after at least two prior therapies, the proposed regimen is a single dose of Breyanzi contains a target of 
100 x 106 CAR-positive viable T cells (consisting of CD8+ cell component and CD4+ cell component), 
suspended  in  one  or  more  vials  of  each  cell  component.  JCAR017  accounts  for  a  combination  pack 
including the CD4+ cell component and CD8+ cell component administered in sequence. The infusion 
foresees the administration of a 1:1 CD4+:CD8+ cell components ratio. 
Based on DOVER data in study 017001 the recalculated by direct CAR detection ratio CD4+:CD8+ ranged 
from 0.73 to 2.20, varying from the target of 1:1. For 94% of patients the ratio ranged between 0.73 
and 1.3 and for 89% between 0.8 and 1.2. In terms of PK parameters, the retrospective linear regression 
analyses  showed  a  potential  association  between  PK  parameters  and  the  CD4+:CD8+  ratio.  A  0.2 
increase in CD4+:CD8+ ratio would translate in a decrease of Cmax and AUC0-28 of 24% and 22%. 
Although the high variability was observed in PK, it should be noted that similar retrospective analyses 
also showed a potential relationship between higher CD4+:CD8+ cell components ratio and a shorter 
DOR and PFS (see section Clinical Efficacy). Therefore, a more precisely defined range for the ratio of 
CD4+:CD8+ cells composition is considered of added value to optimise efficacy outcomes, although it 
should be noted that a wider range than the 1:1 target range do not translate in a significant effect on 
PK parameters. 
Special populations 
The Cmax and AUC0-28 showed a decrease with increasing age, however, as per product characteristics, 
there  is  a  high  variability.  This  trend  can  be  in  part  explained  by  the  physiological  decrease  in 
immunological responses in elderly. 
Interactions 
Based  on  qPCR  PK  analysis  set  (N=245),  the  applicant  analysed  the  effect  of  tocilizumab  and/or 
corticosteroid  administration  on  JCAR017  PK.  The  PK  analysis  did  not  distinguish  between  subjects 
receiving only tocilizumab from  subjects receiving only corticosteroids, therefore the net effect of the 
two  medicinal  products  on  JCAR  exposure  is  not  clear.  The  submitted  analysis  suggests  that  the 
administration of tocilizumab as well as the administration of corticosteroids increase the exposure of 
JCAR in term of Cmax (4.15-fold for tocilizumab and 4.39 for corticosteroids) and AUC0-28 (4.06 with 
tocilizumab and 3.90 with corticosteroids). These results should be carefully considered since the showed 
effect is biased by other factors impacting on the JCAR exposure. First of all, as reported in PD section 
of this AR, subjects with any grade CRS (N=99) had 2.29 and 2.36-fold higher median Cmax and AUC0-
28, respectively than subjects without any grade CRS (N=146).  
Moreover, also the tumour burden showed a significant effect on PK parameters. A higher burden of the 
disease at baseline increases the risk of CRS and consequently the possibility to be administered with 
tocilizumab  and/or  corticosteroids.  Therefore,  the  higher  exposure  seen  in  subjects  treated  with 
tocilizumab/corticosteroids is also influenced by other concomitants factors also having impact on JCAR 
PK parameters. A sound conclusion cannot be drawn on the actual effect of tocilizumab on JCAR017 PK 
and therefore no specific recommendations can be given in the SmPC section 5.2.  
Pharmacodynamic 
B-cell aplasia 
B-cell aplasia (ie, CD19+ B-cells <3% of peripheral blood lymphocytes), an on-target effect of anti-CD19 
CAR T-cell therapies, may be seen as CAR T cells persist long term, functioning as a surrogate marker 
of CAR T-cell persistence and activity.

Immunogenicity  
Due to the small number of subjects who had pre-existing ATA, treatment-induced or treatment-boosted 
ATA, it is not possible to consider the relationship between ATA status and efficacy, safety as conclusive.  
Overall, treatment induced ATA (induced or boosted by the treatment) was low, and they were slightly 
higher in 017001 (15.6%) than in BCM-001 study (9.1%) at the DCO 19 Jun 2020. 
It  is  difficult  to  interpret  how  ATAs  (regardless  of  knowledge  on  neutralizing  capacity)  would  impact 
clinical outcomes.   
The  cytokine  profile  (study  017001)  over  time  indicates  that  there  is  a  trend  toward  higher  cytokine 
levels  (IFN-γ)  in  patient  without  treatment-induced  ATA  or  treatment-boosted  ATA  during  treatment 
than patients who did not. The relevance of this data for PK/efficacy/safety outcomes is difficult to predict 
and overall relationship between cytokines change and outcomes are inconclusive. 
In the data provided with a data cut off of 19 June 2020, a pattern of lower ORR (55.6% vs 74.9%) and 
CR rate (44.4% vs 53.4%), but longer DOR was observed in subjects who had pre-existing ATA compared 
with subjects who did not have pre-existing ATA.  
A different pattern of higher ORR (95.0 % vs 69.9%) and CR rate (82.4% vs 47.6%) and longer DOR 
were observed in subjects who had treatment-induced or treatment-boosted ATA compared with subjects 
who did not have treatment-induced or treatment-boosted ATA.  
No apparent relationship between pre-existent ATA or treatment-induced/boosted ATAs and AESI was 
observed, but the data are currently very limited. 
Regarding  the  discussion  on  neutralizing  potential  of  ATAs,  given  the  absence  of  evidence  that  the 
emergence of ATA impacts exposure, safety, or efficacy, the late emergence of the ATA relative to the 
tmax, the lack of an endogenous counterpart, and the use as a single dose strategy, a NAb assay has 
not been implemented to date for liso-cel. However, as the relevance of the long-term kinetics of liso-
cel  persistence  becomes  clear,  the  applicant  will  explore  the  optimal  assay  format  for  NAb  assays  in 
future trials. 
In regard to the cellular immune responses to JCAR017, an interim bioanalytical Sample Analysis Report 
for interferon gamma ELISPOT (Cellular Immunogenicity) for JCAR017-BCM-001 study was provided. No 
further  validation  data  have  been  provided  for  the  interferon  (IFN)  gamma  enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent (ELISPOT) assay that detects T cells that are specific to the extracellular domain of liso-
cel  while  a  number  of  validation  issue  have  been  reported  in  the  D80  AR  (e.g.  a  high  intra-assay 
variability  for  the  D1637+JACR017-CAR-ECD  peptides  positive  control).  Given  that  the  cellular 
immunogenicity was an exploratory endpoint of study BCM-001, the issue is not pursued. 
In conclusion, there are no sufficiently informative data either on cellular immunogenicity or on potential 
neutralizing  activity  of  treatment-emergent  or  treatment-boosted  ATAs,  or  long-term  impact  of 
immunogenicity  on  clinical  endpoints.  The  overall  number  of  patients  with  detected  ATAs  is  low 
precluding meaningful analysis and conclusions cannot be drawn. Therefore, an uncertainty still remains 
regarding  the  impact  of  cellular  and  humoral  immunogenicity  (ATA)  on  the  PK,  efficacy  and  safety 
following initial treatment when for pre-existent ATA or treatment-induced/boosted ATAs, and in case of 
re-treatment. 
The studies in which immunogenicity will be further characterised are listed in Part IV (Plans for post-
authorisation efficacy studies) of the RMP, and include the ongoing studies 017001, JCAR017-BCM-001 
and JCAR017-BCM-003.

The applicant commits to explore the feasibility of developing a neutralizing antibody (NAb) assay and if 
successful to validate this assay. Up to then all ATA confirmed positive samples will be banked and will 
be Nab characterised in case a validated Nab assay has been established. Results of ATA status and Nab 
characterisation, as well as corresponding bioanalytical reports will then be included in/attached to the 
(amended) final clinical study reports of the corresponding studies. 
Depending  on  the  outcome,  the  applicant  is  expected  to  additionally  provide  an  updated  integrated 
analysis of the immunogenicity of Breyanzi (impact on PK, efficacy and safety) within one of the post-
approval  procedures  (e.g.,  with  final  clinical  study  reports,  when  submitted).  This  should  include  the 
validation report of the developed neutralizing antibody assay and the final bioanalytical reports including 
all the results of immunogenicity samples (in all immunogenicity assays). 
Pharmacokinetic-Safety Relationships  
It  is not  known  whether  activity  of  CAR-T  cells  could  be  affected by  immunosuppressive  mechanisms 
due to corticosteroids use or due to inhibition of IL-6 signalling as one the main inflammatory cytokines. 
Preclinical studies do not suggest that IL-6 is directly involved in CAR-T lysis of tumour cells (Singh et 
al, 2017). The impact of corticosteroids on early expansion is not excluded, as well as on persistence or 
durability of immune responses (Brudno et al, 2019). The applicant further discussed potential effect of 
tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids on JCAR017 activity by comparing response rates between subjects 
who received tocilizumab and/or corticosteroid for CRS or iiNT and those who did not (data cut-off date 
of 19 Jun 2020). Although response rates are slightly lower in the subset of patients who have received 
tocilizumab and/or corticosteroid for CRS or iiNT, 95% CIs were overlapping, indicating no significant 
difference.    With  regard  to  time-to-event  endpoints,  median  DOR,  PFS  and  OS  for  the  subgroup  of 
patients treated with tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids (8.0, 3.0 and 10.0 months, respectively) were 
shorter compared to the subgroup of patient which did not received tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids 
(20.5, 9.0 and 45.2 months, respectively). While for DOR  and OS, the 95% CIs for the median were 
overlapping, this was not the case for the 95% CIs for median PFS. However, K-M curves and 95%CIs 
for probability of continued DOR and PFS at 6 months up to 24 months and for probability of OS at 18 
months up to 24 months were overlapping and showed similar plateaus indicating long-term benefit for 
a proportion of the subjects. Further, subjects with higher tumour burden at baseline are more likely to 
develop  CRS  and  iiNT  and  thus  are  more  likely  to  be  treated  with  tocilizumab  and/or  corticosteroids. 
Such potential for selection was confirmed by comparing the baseline patient and disease characteristics 
between both groups. With no clinically meaningful differences in prior treatment history and baseline 
patient  characteristics,  there  were  clinically  meaningful  (≥  20%)  differences  in  baseline  disease 
characteristics, with an increased frequency of subjects with pre-LDC LDH ≥ 500 U/L, pre-LDC SPD ≥ 
50  cm2,  and  baseline  CRP  ≥  20  mg/L  in  the  treated  group  compared  with  the  not-treated  group, 
indicating  patients  in  the  treated  group  had  an  increased  tumour  burden  and  inflammatory  state.  An 
additional post-hoc analysis comparing efficacy outcomes of subjects with elevated markers of tumour 
burden (pre-LDC SPD ≥50 cm2, pre-LDC LDH ≥500 U/L) and inflammation (baseline CRP ≥ 20 mg/L) 
compared to those without, regardless of tocilizumab and/or corticosteroid use showed a similar trend 
to that seen in the treated versus not-treated subgroups, with numerically shorter median DOR and OS, 
indicating  that  the  potential  differences  observed  between  tocilizumab  and/or  corticosteroids  treated 
patients  is  likely  due  to  selection  bias  and  cannot  be  attributed  to  treatment  with  tocilizumab  and/or 
corticosteroids alone. 
Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic Relationships 
No differences were observed in peak or baseline levels of cytokines, known to be potentially associated 
with expansion or safety as described in literature (including median peak levels of INF-γ, IL-6, MIP-1β, 
IL-15 and TNF-α and baseline levels of IL-6 and TNF-α) between patients with Cmax or AUC0-28 above or 
below median. 
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022

Pharmacodynamic-Efficacy Relationships  
No soluble biomarkers were associated with BOR. Baseline and peak levels of CRP and ferritin were also 
not associated with BOR. 
Pharmacodynamic-Safety Relationships 
In all cases, the number of subjects with Grade ≥ 3 CRS analysed in the JCAR017-treated Analysis Set 
was too small (N=6) to draw clear conclusion of a relationship between PD biomarkers and Safety signals. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Considering  the  cellular  nature  of  JCAR017  and  the  expected  high  variability,  pharmacology  was  well 
characterised.  The  immunogenicity  will  be  further  characterised  in  the  ongoing  studies  017001, 
JCAR017-BCM-001 and JCAR017-BCM-003 that are listed in Part IV (Plans for post-authorisation efficacy 
studies) of the RMP. The applicant commits to explore the feasibility of developing a neutralizing antibody 
(NAb) assay, to validate this assay and to provide the results within the updated clinical study reports 
(including an updated integrated analysis of the immunogenicity). 
The CAT considers the following measures (recommendation) necessary to address the issues related 
to pharmacology: 
The applicant is recommended to investigate the feasibility of developing a neutralizing anti-body 
(NAb) assay, to validate this assay and to provide the results within the updated clinical study reports 
(including an updated integrated analysis of the immunogenicity). 
The CHMP endorse the CAT assessment regarding the conclusions on the Clinical pharmacology as 
described above.  
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Introduction

diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) and 
follicular lymphoma grade 3B (FL3B) after at least two prior therapies”.

To contextualise the results observed in uncontrolled trials 017001 and BCM-001 the applicant has also 
conducted  a  Systematic  Literature  Review  (SLR),  including  randomised  and  non-randomised  studies 
published between 01 Jan 2003 and 02 Dec 2019, and a global, non-interventional, retrospective, multi-
centre, observational study (NDS-NHL-001; n=407) evaluating efficacy outcomes of unselected patients 
with R/R large B-cell lymphoma treated in real-world (RW) clinical oncology settings. 
The efficacy and safety of JCAR017 in transplant-eligible patients with aggressive large B-cell 
lymphoma who have failed one prior line of systemic therapy is investigated in ongoing Phase 3 study 
JCAR017-BCM-003 (TRANSFORM). No data from study BCM-003 have been submitted in this 
application for MA. 
2.6.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Dosing recommendations were mainly based on results from Phase I Study 017001.  
Dosing assumptions and dose groups in study 017001  
The starting dose planned for Study 017001 (50 × 106 CAR+ T cells [DL-1]) was equivalent to 0.5 × 106 
CAR+ T cells/kg for a 100-kg adult and 1 × 106 CAR+ T cells/kg for a 50-kg adult. Study 017001 allowed 
for dose escalation to 2 higher dose levels (100 × 106 CAR+ T cells [DL2] and 150 × 106 CAR+ T cells 
[DL3]) if safety and efficacy data from the lower doses were acceptable. Dose de-escalation to 25 × 106 
CAR+ T cells was also available if the toxicity was unacceptable. Dosing started at DL1S, then proceeded 
to DL1D (2 doses of 50 × 106 CAR+ T cells given 14 days apart), DL2S (single dose of 100 × 106 CAR+ 
T cells), and DL3S (single dose of 150 × 106 CAR+ T cells). 
Dose finding results 
DL1S,  DL1D,  and  DL2S  met  the  safety threshold  as  per  the  modified  continual  reassessment  method 
(mCRM) algorithm and were considered likely efficacious by the criteria defined in the protocol (i.e. p[CR 
>0.25] > 0.9). Of the 139 subjects in the DLBCL Treated Set who were evaluable for DLTs, DLTs were 
noted in 9 subjects: 6 subjects received treatment at DL1S, 2 subjects at DL2S, and 1 subject at DL3S. 
DLTs occurring in more than one subject were encephalopathy (N=4; three of which were Grade 3 and 
had resolved, and the fourth of which was Grade 4 and not resolved at the time of death due to disease 
progression) and thrombocytopenia (N=2; both Grade 4, both with outcomes of recovering/resolving). 
One Grade 5 DLT was noted (an event of diffuse alveolar damage). 
There was no evidence of increased toxicity with DL2S compared to DL1S, the preliminary DOR observed 
with DL2S appeared to be longer and point estimates of CAR T-cell expansion appeared higher in DL2S.  
A target single dose of 100 × 106 CAR+ T cells (DL2S) was then selected for the DLBCL Cohort dose 
confirmation (DC) group. 
CD4+:CD8+ cell components ratio variability 
The protocol-defined target CD4+:CD8+ cell components ratio was 1:1 for all dose levels, and no other 
CD4+:CD8+ cell components ratios were prospectively tested. The volumes needed to achieve target 
dose and ratio were calculated using the indirect CAR detection method for all but 2 subjects. However, 
based on the administered dose retrospectively calculated using the direct CAR detection method, that 
Assessment report

Page 58/252 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
actual  ratio  varied:  the  median  CD4+:CD8+  cell  components  ratio  was  0.99  (range:  0.81,  1.20)  for 
DL1S, 1.01 (range: 0.73, 2.20) for DL2S, and 1.00 (range: 0.82, 1.60) for DL3S. The CD4+:CD8+ cell 
components ratio administered to approximately 94% of subjects in the DLBCL Cohort included in the 
JCAR017-treated Analysis Set was clustered within a range from 0.7 to 1.3. 
Dose recommendations  
Results of multivariable analysis 
No  clear  effect  of  manufacturing  process  version,  dose,  or  CD4+:CD8+  cell  components  ratio  was 
observed on clinical response endpoints, except for a potential association between higher CD4+:CD8+ 
cell  components  ratio  and  shorter  DOR  (for  a  0.2  increase  in  CD4+:CD8+  cell  components  ratio 
HR=1.266; 2-sided p-value=0.0155).  
Results of univariate analyses 
Efficacy  analyses  in  the  DLBCL  Treated  Analysis  Set  at  any  dose  level  (N=256)  showed  that  the 
administered dose of CAR+ viable T cells over the range studied had no relationship with best objective 
response  (BOR),  DOR  and  PFS.  Responses,  including  CRs,  were  seen  in  all  assigned  dose  regimens 
tested, and no evidence of a relationship between assigned dose regimen and depth of response was 
observed. 
With respect to safety, the logistic regression model showed a potential relationship between increased 
dose and a higher all-grade CRS rate. The OR for all-grade CRS in the logistic regression model was 1.01 
(95%CI  1.00,  1.02;  p=0.0705).  The estimated  probability  of  having  all-grade  CRS  over  administered 
doses from the logistic regression model was 0.33 (95%CI 0.24, 0.45), 0.44 (95%CI 0.38, 0.51) and 
0.56 (95%CI 0.40, 0.71) at cell doses of 50 x 106, 100 x 106, and 150 x 106, respectively. The finding 
from  the  logistic  regression  model  is  similar  to  the  CRS  incidence  summary  by  assigned  dose  levels 
where DL3S shows over 20% higher incidence of all-grade CRS relative to DL1S and DL2S (40% at DL1S, 
37% at DL2S and 63% at DL3S); this difference was limited to low-grade events as no such difference 
was observed for Grade ≥3 CRS events. Results of the logistic regression analysis did not show a clear 
relationship  between  administered  dose  and  all-grade  Investigator-identified  neurologic  toxicity  (iiNT, 
OR 1.01, 95%CI 0.99, 1.02; p=0.3085) or Grade ≥ 3 iiNT (OR 0.99, 95%CI 0.97, 1.00; p=0.1271). A 
potential relationship was also observed between increased dose and a higher Grade ≥3 infection rate. 
The odds ratio for having Grade ≥3 infection from the logistic regression model was 1.01 (95%CI 1.00, 
1.03). The estimated probability of having Grade ≥3 infection over administered doses from the logistic 
regression  model  is  0.073  (95%CI  0.035,  0.147),  0.138  (95%CI  0.099,  0.188),  and  0.244  (95%CI 
0.116, 0.444) at administered cell doses of 50 x 106, 100 x 106, and 150 x 106, respectively. This finding 
is similar to the incidence of Grade ≥3 infection TEAEs by assigned dose levels where DL1S was 8.9%, 
DL2S was 11.3%, and DL3S was 22.0%. 
Results of univariate CD4+:CD8+ ratio analyses 
Linear regression analysis indicated a potential association between PK parameters and the CD4+:CD8+ 
cell  components  ratio,  indicating  that  a  0.2  increase  in  the  CD4+:CD8+  cell  components  ratio  would 
decrease Cmax and AUC0-28 by 23% and 22%, respectively (see also the PK Section above). The 0.2 
increment in CD4+:CD8+ cell components ratio was chosen because it was felt to reflect a meaningful 
increment given the range of ratios administered during the trial.  
Logistic regression analysis was also performed to evaluate the relationship between CD4+:CD8+ cell 
components  ratio  and  the  probability  of  response.  The  odds  ratio  was  1.32  (95%CI  0.94,  2.01; 
p=0.1155),  indicating  no  clear  relationship  between  higher  CD4+:CD8+  cell  components  ratio  and 
probability of response.

The Cox proportional model showed that the DOR HR for a 0.2 increase in CD4+:CD8+ cell components 
ratio  was  1.307  (95%CI  1.089,  1.569;  p=0.0040),  indicating  a  potential  association  between  higher 
CD4+:CD8+ cell components ratio and shorter DOR. With respect to PFS, the HR for a 0.2 increase in 
CD4+:CD8+ cell components ratio was 1.173 (95%CI 1.001, 1.374; p=0.0486).  
With respect to safety, logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between 
CD4+:CD8+ cell components ratio and the probability of CRS, iiNT. Results indicated that there was no 
clear relationship between CD4+:CD8+ cell components ratio and the incidence of all-grade CRS (OR: 
1.10-, 95%CI 0.84, 1.45), all grade iiNT (OR: 1.24, 95%CI 0.93, 1.65), and grade ≥3 iiNT (OR: 1.29; 
95%CI 0.87, 1.81).  
Justification of Recommended Dose Range 
A  dose  range  of  44  to  120  ×  106  CAR+  T  cells  is  recommended  in  the  SmPC  to  reflect  the  clinical 
experience at assigned DL1 and DL2.  
In Study 017001, subjects were assigned to 3 discrete dose levels (DLs), yet within each DL the actual 
administered dose varied within a range (see Table below). 
Table 6. Assigned Dose Level and Administered Dose in Studies 017001 and BCM-001 
The efficacy and safety outcomes at the recommended dose range of 44 to 120 x 106 CAR+ T cells (i.e. 
at assigned DL1+DL2) were compared to efficacy and safety outcomes at the dose ranges that represent 
administered doses 20% above and below the target dose of assigned DL1 or DL2, the lower, mid, and 
upper boundaries of the recommended dose range, and the dose range of the total population assigned 
to DL1+DL2+DL3. 
The upper and lower limits of the recommended dose range (44 to 120 × 106 CAR+ T cells) were selected 
based on the following reasons: 
- Clinical efficacy and safety outcomes were consistent across the recommended dose range of 44 to 120 
x 106 CAR+ T cells at assigned DL1+DL2 and are similar to the clinical outcomes for the dose range of 
the total population (44 to 156 x 106 CAR+ T cells). 
- A numerically higher incidence of all-grade CRS, all-grade iiNT, and Grade ≥ 3 infection was observed 
at assigned DL3 (150 x 106 CAR+ T cells) when compared with lower assigned DLs, consistent with the 
results  from  the  retrospective  logistic  regression  modelling.  Therefore,  the  recommended  dose  range 
excludes subjects assigned to the highest administered doses (DL3) in Study 017001. 
Justification of Recommended CD4+:CD8+ cell components Ratio Range  
The  recommended  CD4+:CD8+  cell  components  ratio  for  JCAR017  is  1:1;  to  reflect  the  clinical 
experience in study 017001 a 0.8 – 1.2 CD4+:CD8+ cell components range was included in the product 
specifications. The upper and lower limits of the CD4+:CD8+ ratio range are justified for the following 
reasons: 
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022  
Page 60/252 
 
 
 
 
- Clinical efficacy and safety data for liso-cel at the recommended dose range 44 to 120 x 106 CAR+ T 
cells at assigned DL1+DL2 were consistent across the entire range of administered CD4+:CD8+ ratio 
range of 0.7 to 2.2.  
- Retrospective analyses of key clinical efficacy and safety outcomes versus administered CD4+:CD8+ 
cell  components  ratio  as  a  continuous  variable  demonstrated  that  there  was  no  clear  relationship 
between CD4+:CD8+ cell components ratio (range 0.7 to 2.2) and the majority of key clinical outcomes 
(BOR, incidence of CRS, and iiNT), yet associations could not be excluded between higher CD4+:CD8+ 
cell  components  ratio  and  shorter  DOR  and  PFS.  Information  on  CD4+:CD8+  cell  components  ratios 
<0.8 is limited. 
Lymphodepleting chemotherapy (LDC) 
Administration of JCAR017 was preceded by LDC with fludarabine (30 mg/m2) plus cyclophosphamide 
(300 mg/m2) (flu/cy) for 3 days. This regimen was selected to optimise cellular expansion, persistence, 
and antitumour activity of the CAR T cells, as well as to limit toxicity and retain antitumour activity. 
2.6.5.2.  Main study(ies) 
The efficacy of JCAR017 was investigated in Phase 1 study 017001 and Phase 2 study JCAR017-BCM-
001. 
Study 017001 
Study 017001 is an open-label, multicentre, multicohort, seamless design, Phase 1 study to determine 
the safety, antitumour activity, and PK of JCAR017 in adult subjects with R/R B-cell NHL. Study design 
is summarised in Figures below.

Figure 4: Study 017001 design (periods) 
Subjects  could  be  enrolled  in  one  of  the  following  2  disease-specific  cohorts:  the  diffuse  large  B-cell 
(DLBCL) and the mantle cell Lymphoma (MCL) Cohort. Data from the MCL Cohort are not part of this 
MAA. 
The study design included dose finding (DF), dose expansion (DE), and dose confirmation (DC) groups. 
Consistent  with  the  principles  of  seamless  oncology  trial  design  (Prowell,  2016)  for  therapies  with 
adequate  preliminary  evidence  of  a  promising  benefit-risk  profile,  a  DC  group  for  the  DLBCL  Cohort 
further assessed the safety and efficacy of JCAR017 at the recommended regimen.  
In Study 017001, subjects were treated with JCAR017 product manufactured using one of the 4 different 
manufacturing processes (version [v] 1, v2, v3, and v4), with v4 representing the proposed commercial 
process. After transition to v4, the LVV used to manufacture JCAR017 product was initially supplied as 
v.1.0, and then subsequently supplied as v.1.2 The LVV manufactured as v.1.0 was used for the majority 
of the JCAR017 clinical experience in study 017001. 
Study BCM-001 
Study BCM-001 is an open-label, single-arm, multicohort, multicentre, Phase 2 study to determine the 
efficacy  and  safety  of  JCAR017  (administered  as  a  single  dose  of  100  ×  106  CAR+  T  cells)  in  adult 
subjects with R/R aggressive B-cell NHL and to demonstrate the feasibility of manufacturing JCAR017 in 
Europe. As of the 13 Sep 2019 data cut-off date, the study was ongoing. The study design is summarised 
in Figures below:

Figure 5: Study BCM-001 design 
Figure 6: BCM-001 design (periods) 
Subjects could be enrolled into one of 6 cohorts, including the following 2 cohorts in DLBCL relapsed or 
refractory after at least 2 prior treatments (3L+ R/R DLBCL): Cohort 1 enrolling subjects in Europe 
(EU), and Cohort 3 enrolling subjects in Japan. No additional cohort had enrolled subjects as of the 13 
Sep 2019 data cut-off date. 
In Study BCM-001 JCAR017 was manufactured using the proposed commercial process (v4). The LVV 
used to manufacture JCAR017 product was initially supplied as v1.2, and later as the final commercial 
version transferred.

Treatments 
Leukapheresis 
Leukapheresis  was  performed  on  each  subject  to  collect  a  sufficient  quantity  of  peripheral  blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for the production of the JCAR017 investigational product. If JCAR017 could 
not be manufactured, the subject could have had additional leukaphereses: subjects were required to 
continue to meet eligibility requirements. 
Anticancer Treatments between Screening and Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy 
If  deemed  necessary  by  the  treating  physician,  anticancer  treatment  was  allowed  for  disease  control 
during JCAR017 manufacture (e.g., after screening while waiting for leukapheresis, or after leukapheresis 
and prior to LDC). The subject was required to continue to have PET-positive disease and meet eligibility 
criteria pertaining to adequate organ function, active infections, pregnancy, and washout of prior therapy 
before initiation of LDC. 
Criteria for Initiating Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy and JCAR017 Treatment 
In  study  017001,  as  of  Amendment  6,  subjects  could  not  receive  JCAR017  if  they  experienced  a 
significant worsening in clinical status compared with that during eligibility screening.  In case of delayed 
infusion because of clinical instability, LDC could be repeated if appropriate.  
In study BCM-001, as a result of the urgent safety measure in December 2018, neither LDC nor JCAR017 
treatment  should  have  been  administered  if  there  was  a  worsening  of  ECOG  PS  to  2,  rapid  clinical 
deterioration, or evidence of rapid PD. Subsequent to Protocol Amendment 2, subjects who were TNE 
may have had ECOG PS 2; however, subjects should have been clinically stable, recovered from prior 
toxicities,  and  not  have  evidence  of  rapid  PD  or  rapid  clinical  deterioration  prior  to  receiving  LDC  or 
JCAR017 infusion. 
Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy 
Subjects  were  treated  with  fludarabine  (30  mg/m2/day  for  3  days)  plus  cyclophosphamide  (300 
mg/m2/day  for  3  days)  prior  to  treatment  with  JCAR017.  Dose  reductions  of either/both  agents  were 
allowed at the discretion of the investigator and/or in compliance with approved labels for these products. 
Lymphodepleting chemotherapy could start 5 to 10 days prior to JCAR017 infusion.  
JCAR017 Premedication 
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022  
Page 66/252 
 
 
 
Subjects  were  premedicated  with  500  to  650  mg  acetaminophen  orally  (PO)  and  25  to  50  mg 
diphenhydramine  hydrochloride  or,  per  the  current  Product  Administration  Manual,  equivalent 
antihistamine (PO or IV) 30 to 60 minutes prior to JCAR017 administration. These medications were to 
have  been  repeated  every  6  hours  as  needed  based  on  the  Investigator’s  assessment  of  symptoms. 
Premedication with steroids was not allowed. 
JCAR017 Dose and Schedule 
In  study  017001  JCAR017  was  administered  according  to  the  dose  regimen  to  which  a  subject  was 
assigned. The dose levels (DLs) allowed in this study were: 
- DL-1: 25 × 106 CAR+ T cells 
- DL1: 50 × 106 CAR+ T cells (single-dose and 2-dose regimens [DL1S and DL1D, respectively]) 
- DL2: 100 × 106 CAR+ T cells (single-dose regimen only [DL2S]) 
- DL3: 150 × 106 CAR+ T cells (single dose regimen only [DL3S]) 
In the single-dose schedule, JCAR017 was given 2 to 7 days after completion of LDC.  
In study BCM-001 JCAR017 was administered as 100 × 106 CAR+ T cells on Day 1.  
JCAR017 Administration 
JCAR017 was administered as separate IV infusions that consisted of CD8+ CAR+ and CD4+  CAR+  T 
cells (JCAR017 CD8+ cell component administered first, followed by the JCAR017 CD4+ cell component). 
Subjects were monitored during and after each IV administration of JCAR017 components. JCAR017 was 
delivered in an outpatient setting at the investigator’s discretion.  
Recommended Supportive Care, Additional Treatment, and Monitoring 
Prophylactic  treatment/measures  were  strongly  recommended  for  subjects  at  risk  for  TLS,  per 
institutional  standard  of  care.  The  use  of  red  blood  cells  and  platelet  transfusions,  and/or  colony-
stimulating factors was permitted per institutional standard of care. The use of prophylactic or empiric 
anti-infective  agents  (e.g.,  trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole  for  pneumocystis  pneumonia  [PCP] 
prophylaxis,  broad  spectrum  antibiotics,  antifungals,  or  antiviral  agents  for  febrile  neutropenia)  was 
permitted per institutional standard of care. 
Steroids  at  therapeutic  doses  (>20  mg/day  of  prednisone  or  equivalent)  were  prohibited  until  lack  of 
response, subsequent therapy for lymphoma, or 1 year following JCAR017 treatment. Therapeutic doses 
were allowed in life-threatening situations and for other medical conditions when indicated, or after loss 
of detectable JCAR017 cells.

Quality of Life C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions health state classifier 
to  5  Levels  (EQ-5D-5L),  and  the  Functional  Assessment  of  Cancer  Therapy  –  Lymphoma  “Additional 
concerns” subscale (FACT-LymS) 
• 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint: Objective response rate (ORR) as the proportion of subjects with a BOR of 
either CR or PR per IRC assessment based on the Lugano 2014 criteria. The BOR was the best disease 
response recorded from the time of JCAR017 infusion until disease progression, end of study, the start 
of another anticancer therapy, or HSCT. In the IRC analysis, a non-PD was assigned as a BOR by the IRC 
when PET was not evaluable or not done for all the post-baseline assessment time points and the best 
response based on CT-staging evaluation was CR, PR or SD. In such a case, a subject was considered as 
a non-responder in the calculation of ORR. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints included the following: 
- CR rate (CRR), defined as the proportion of subjects with a BOR of CR per IRC assessment based on 
the Lugano 2014 criteria (Cheson, 2014) 
- DOR defined as the time from first response (CR or PR) to PD or death per IRC assessment based on 
the Lugano 2014 criteria.  
- PFS, defined as the time from first infusion of JCAR017 to PD, per IRC assessment based on the Lugano 
2014 criteria, or death 
- PFS ratio, defined as the ratio of PFS on the most recent line of therapy prior to JCAR017 to the PFS 
on  JCAR017  per  investigator  assessment  (study  017001  only).  The  PFS  on  JCAR017  was  based  on 
Investigator assessment. The PFS to the most recent line of therapy prior to JCAR017 was the time from 
the start date of the most recent line of therapy prior to JCAR017 to the date of disease progression or 
informed consent if date of progression was entirely missing 
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022  
Page 68/252 
 
 
 
 
- EFS, defined as the interval from the date of JCAR017 infusion to the earliest of the following events: 
death from any cause, PD per IRC assessment, or starting a new anticancer therapy (study BCM-001 
olny) 
- OS, defined as the time from treatment with JCAR017 to the date of death  
- Measurement of HRQoL changes as assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the EuroQol 5-dimensions 
5-levels (EQ-5D-5L, study 017001 only) or the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – Lymphoma 
“Additional Concerns” Subscale (FACT-LymS, study BCM-001 only).  
Efficacy assessments 
Based  on  the  Lugano  criteria,  radiographic  disease  assessments  by  PET  and/or  diagnostic  quality  CT 
scans were performed pre-treatment, after any anticancer therapy for disease control (if applicable), at 
the end of the treatment cycle, and approximately 1 (only in study BCM-001) 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 
months  following  the  last  dose  of  JCAR017  or  until  disease  progression  or  treatment  with  additional 
anticancer therapy. For subjects with secondary CNS involvement, brain MRI scans and repeated CSF 
assessments  were  performed  using  flow  cytometry.  Positron  emission  tomography  scans  were  not 
required after a subject achieved a CR unless PD was suspected on follow-up CT scan. Assessment of 
bone  marrow  involvement  by  lymphoma  was  by  PET  scan  only.  Disease  response  was  determined 
according  to  the  Cheson  (2014)  recommendations.  Treatment  decisions  and  assessment  of  the 
probability of CR for mCRM were performed using assessment of response as per the Investigator.  
• 
Sample size 
Study 017001 
Based  on  a  meta-analysis  using  random-effects  model  on  data  from  8  published  studies  of  NCCN 
recommended regimens for patients with R/R aggressive large B-cell NHL, the estimated ORR was 30% 
(95%CI 24 to 38) and CR is 19% (95%CI 13 to 26). For the primary analysis in Study 017001, based 
on the null hypothesis of ORR ≤40% and an alternative hypothesis of ORR >40% with the effect size of 
25% (ORR=65%), a sample size of 75 subjects in the PAS was to provide ~98% power to demonstrate 
statistical significance at a 1-sided significance level of 0.021 based on an exact test.  
For the efficacy endpoint of CR rate, based on the null hypothesis of CR rate ≤20% and an alternative 
hypothesis of CR rate >20% with the effect size of 20% (CR rate=40%), 75 subjects in the PAS was to 
provide ~96% power to demonstrate statistical significance at a 1-sided significance level of 0.021 based 
on an exact test. In chemorefractory patients predefined ORR rate of 30% and a CR rate of 10% were 
based on the retrospective SCHOLAR-1 study (Crump, 2017). 
The maximum planned sample size for the DF + DE phases was 174 subjects. The maximum planned 
sample size for the DF phase was 114 subjects. The planned sample size for a DC group was at least 
100 subjects to ensure at least 75 subjects in the PAS.  
Study BCM-001 
Determination  of  the  null  hypothesis  was  based  on  results  from  the  retrospective  SCHOLAR-1  study 
(Crump, 2017). 
Cohort 1: a sample size of 34 subjects treated with JCAR017 conforming product provided at least 90% 
power to reject the null hypothesis of response rate less than 40% assuming the target response rate of 
70% using an exact binomial test with an overall 2-sided significance level of 0.05 considering a formal 
interim analysis with the first 10 subjects treated with JCAR017 conforming product being followed for 
at least 3 months after JCAR017 infusion to test the superiority of JCAR017. The primary analysis for 
Cohort 1 was planned after at least 34 subjects treated with JCAR017 conforming product were treated

Study 017001 Efficacy Analysis sets 
Screened Set: all subjects who signed informed consent. 
Eligible Set: all subjects who signed informed consent and met all inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
Leukapheresed (Intent-to-treat - ITT) Set: all subjects who had signed informed consent, who met all 
inclusion/exclusion  criteria,  and  who  underwent  leukapheresis.  In  case  of  protocol  deviations  where 
subjects underwent leukapheresis without having met all inclusion/exclusion criteria, the subjects were 
still included in the Leukapheresed Set. 
Primary Analysis Set (PAS) for the DLBCL Cohort: subjects in the DF, DE, and DC groups who failed at 
least 2 therapies in the DLBCL Cohort with DLBCL NOS (de novo or tFL), or HGL with DLBCL histology, 
treated at the recommended regimen (DL2S). Subjects in the PAS must have had PET-positive disease 
present  before  JCAR017  administration  based  on  IRC  assessment.  The  diagnosis  per  investigator 
assessment  was  used  to  determine  inclusion  in  the  PAS.  This  set  was  used  for  the  primary  efficacy 
analysis. 
JCAR017-treated Analysis Set: all subjects who received at least 1 dose of JCAR017 cell product. In case 
a  subject  received  multiple  JCAR017  doses,  the  first  dose  of  JCAR017  should  have  been  conforming 
product,  which  met  specification  at  the  time  of  product  release.  The  DLBCL  Cohort  JCAR017-treated 
Analysis Set is defined the “DLBCL Treated Set.” 
JCAR017-treated Efficacy Analysis Set: the JCAR017-treated Efficacy Analysis Set included all subjects 
in  the  DLBCL  Cohort  and  JCAR017-treated  Analysis  Set  who  had  PET-positive  disease  present  before 
JCAR017 administration based on IRC assessment. The DLBCL Cohort JCAR017-treated Efficacy Analysis 
Set is referred as the “DLBCL Efficacy Set.” 
Per  Protocol  Analysis  Set  (PP):  a  subset  of  the  PAS,  including  subjects  who  were  compliant  with  the 
major requirements of the study protocol. The PP Analysis Set was used in sensitivity analyses of the 
primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Study BCM-001 Efficacy analysis set 
Screened Set: all subjects who signed informed consent. 
Enrolled  Set:  all  subjects  who  signed  informed  consent,  passed  all  eligibility  criteria,  and  underwent

Efficacy Evaluable Set: all subjects who received JCAR017 and who had a baseline assessment and at 
least one post-JCAR017 disease assessment. 
Efficacy Analyses (studies 017001 and BCM-001) 
For binary endpoints, such as ORR, the frequency distribution (n,%) was provided. The point estimate 
together with 2-sided exact 95% confidence interval (CI) were provided. For  time-to-event endpoints 
such as DOR, EFS, PFS, and OS, the Kaplan-Meier (KM) product limit method was used to estimate the 
survivorship function. Event rates at specific time points were estimated from the KM curves. Medians 
together with 2-sided 95% CI were calculated. 
ORR  and  CRR:  ORR  and  CRR  were  calculated  along  with  the  2-sided  95%  exact  Clopper-Pearson 
confidence intervals (CIs).  
DOR and PFS: the KM method was used to estimate the median DOR and PFS and the DOR/PFS rate at 
6, 12, 18, and 24 months along with the 95% CIs. Censoring reasons: completed the study, discontinued 
the study, received retreatment, received a new anticancer therapy, proceeded to HSCT, experienced an 
event after missing at least 2 consecutive scheduled disease assessments. 
OS: the OS analysis included all available survival information with long-term follow-up data. Data from 
surviving subjects were censored at the last time that the subject was known to be alive. The KM method 
was used to estimate the OS rate at Months 6, 12, 18, and 24, and the median OS along with the 95%CI. 
EFS (only for study BCM-001): the KM method was used to estimate the rate of EFS at Months 1, 3, 6, 
9, 12, 18, and 24, and Q1, median, and Q3 of EFS. Two-sided 95% CI for median was also provided. 
Health-Related Quality of Life 
The  EQ-5D-5L,  EORTC  QLQ-C30,  and  FACT-LymS  (only  in  study  BCM-001)  were  used  to  assess  the 
subject’s global health status, physical, social, emotional, and functional well-being as well as lymphoma-
related quality of life.  
In study 017001, PROs were evaluated in all subjects in the DLBCL Treated Set after implementation of 
Protocol Amendment 4. The main objectives were to examine 4 key prespecified domains (global health 
status,  physical  functioning,  fatigue,  and  pain;  selected  for  their  clinical  relevance  in  this  patient 
population) using the EORTC QLQ-C30. Exploratory objectives included use of the EQ-5D-5L to examine 
health utility index and EuroQol visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) scores. 
The EORTC QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D-5L were assessed at baseline, Day 29 (Month 1), Months 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 
18, 24/end of study, and at disease progression/relapse. Analyses up until Month 18 were included in 
this analysis, as <10 subjects responded to the questionnaires after that point. 
In study BCM-001 four domains from the EORTC QLQ-C30 (fatigue, physical, and cognitive functioning; 
and global health/QoL) and the FACT-LymS were analysed to assess the impact of JCAR017 treatment 
on HRQoL.  
The EORTC QLQ-C30 and FACT-LymS were assessed at screening and baseline (pre-treatment evaluation 
visit),  during  treatment  (Day  1  and  Day  29),  and  posttreatment  (Days  60,  90,  180,  and  270  post-
JCAR017  infusion).  The  results  were  analysable  up  until  Month  3,  as  <10  subjects  responded  to  the 
questionnaires after this time. 
EORTC  QLQ-C30:  A  predefined  change  of  at  least  10  points  on  the  scale  score  was  required  to  be 
considered clinically meaningful.  
EQ-5D-5L: A predefined change ranging from ≥0.08 to ≤-0.1 points on the scale score was required to 
be considered clinically meaningful (Pickard, 2007). 
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022  
Page 71/252 
 
 
 
 
FACT-LymS: The MID for the FACT-LymS score ranges from 3 to 5 points (Hlubocky, 2013). There are 
no established RDs for the FACT-LymS; therefore, the MID value of 3 (+3 for improvement and -3 for 
deterioration) will be used as both the MID and RD. 
Sensitivity Analyses 
Sensitivity analyses of primary and secondary efficacy endpoints in study 017001 were performed based 
on: (1) the Leukapheresed Set, (2) the PP Analysis Set and/or PP DLBCL Analysis Set, (3) the disease 
histology determined by central pathology review, (4) the response determined by Investigator. A subject 
in the Leukapheresed Set  who did not receive cell product was considered not evaluable (i.e., a non-
responder) for the sensitivity analysis of ORR and CR rate. 
Sensitivity  analyses  for  DOR,  PFS  and  EFS:  sensitivity  analyses  were  performed  in  study  017001  (1) 
without censoring HSCT and (2) in alignment with EMA guidelines (EMA, 2012), without censoring new 
anticancer therapy, HSCT and missing at least 2 consecutive scheduled disease assessments.  
Interim analysis 
Study 017001 
An  interim  analysis  (IA)  and  a  primary  analysis  based  on  the  PAS  were  planned.  The  one-sided 
significance  levels  for  the  interim  and  primary  analyses  were  0.01  and  0.021,  respectively,  using  the 
interpolated  spending  function.  The  overall  one-sided  type  I  error  was  0.025.  Since  the  IA  was  not 
performed, all the alpha was preserved for the primary analysis. 
Study BCM-001 
A  formal  IA  was  performed  with  the  first  10  subjects  in  Cohort  1  treated  with  JCAR017  conforming 
product being followed for at least 3 months to test the superiority of JCAR017. An interpolated spending 
function was used as efficacy boundary for the interim analysis with a significance level of 0.01. The IA 
did not reject the null hypothesis of ORR.

Seven subjects (6 in the DLBCL Cohort and 1 in the MCL Cohort) were screened and considered to have 
met eligibility criteria at leukapheresis by the Investigator, underwent leukapheresis, and continued in 
the  study,  but  were  found  later  to  have  not  met  entry  criteria  at  leukapheresis.  All  of  these  were 
considered protocol deviations. Subjects who were enrolled underwent leukapheresis as soon as possible 
thereafter.

Three subjects in the DLBCL Cohort, who  were successfully screened, did not undergo leukapheresis: 
one subject withdrew consent prior to leukapheresis, one subject died prior to leukapheresis, and one 
subject had not yet undergone leukapheresis at the time of the data cut-off. One additional subject who 
was  not  categorised  into  either  the  DLBCL  Cohort  or  the  MCL  Cohort,  was  successfully  screened, 
discontinued from the study prior to being assigned a cohort, and did not undergo leukapheresis. 
Updated analysis (data cut-off date of 19 Jun 2020) 
The updated analysis includes data from 1 additional subject treated with JCAR017 at DL2S.

Conduct of the study 
Study 017001 
As of the data cut-off date of 12 Aug 2019, 6 protocol amendments were filed during the conduct of the 
study. A summary of the main changes made in each amendment is provided below: 
Amendment 1 (24 Sep 2015) 
Provided  additional  information  for  additional  JCAR017  cycles  in  subjects  who  achieve  a  response 
following JCAR017 therapy (the option for additional cycles was removed with Amendment 6). 
Amendment 2 (14 Mar 2016) 
A second group of subjects could be enrolled and treated at a higher dose of JCAR017 (100 × 106 CAR+ 
T cells); the planned maximum sample size was increased from 70 to 90 subjects. 
Amendment 3 (29 Jun 2016) 
Allowed for a third, higher JCAR017 dose level (150 × 106 CAR+ T cells); allowed for expansion groups 
to be opened; made efficacy a primary endpoint rather than secondary; updated the sample size of the 
study and other statistical methods as a result of the above changes; specified that efficacy evaluations 
were to be performed both by the Investigator and by a central IRC; clarified that subjects with PMBCL 
were allowed; changed inclusion criteria to disallow second-line transplant-ineligible subjects; clarified 
the timing of pre-treatment PET and CT scans. 
Amendment 4 (05 Jan 2017) 
Defined  a  more  homogeneous  PAS  for  efficacy  analyses;  specified  that  the  study  should  continue 
enrolling  subjects  at  the  recommended  regimen  to  reach  a  sample  size  of  approximately  100  DLBCL 
Cohort subjects in the DC group to ensure at least 75 subjects in the PAS; clarified that all subjects in 
the  DLBCL  Cohort  must  have  relapsed  or  refractory  disease  after  at  least  2  lines  of  therapy  or  after 
autologous HSCT and clarified definition of DLBCL subjects with regard to then current WHO guidelines; 
allowed subjects with secondary CNS involvement and excluded subjects with CNS-only disease; clarified 
that subjects with transformed iNHL were allowed.  
Amendment 5 (14 Aug 2017) 
Allowed  for  more  than  1 dose  confirmation  group; excluded  further  enrolment  of  subjects  with  ECOG 
performance status of 2 at screening; updated PAS to exclude FL3B and DLBCL transformed from indolent 
histologies, as well as those with ECOG performance status of 2 or prior allo-HSCT. 
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022  
Page 75/252 
 
 
 
 
Amendment 6 (13 Apr 2018) 
Removed the possibility of additional cycles for subjects who responded to JCAR017 but did not achieve 
CR; added flexibility to enrolment numbers to ensure adequate enrolment for the PAS. 
Protocol deviations 
Among  all  enrolled  subjects  (which  includes  both  DLBCL  and  MCL  Cohorts),  there  were  a  total  of  14 
major protocol deviations, in particular: 7 subjects did not have confirmatory PET scans to demonstrate 
PET-positive disease following anticancer therapy for disease control received after screening; 1 subject 
had not received 2 prior treatments for the qualifying diagnosis of tFL (the subject had received 2 prior 
treatments  for  low-grade  lymphoma);  1  subject  was  enrolled  with  ECOG  performance  status  of  2  at 
screening;  1  subject  developed  CNS  involvement  by  NHL  between  leukapheresis  and  JCAR017 
(subsequently, the protocol was amended to allow subjects with secondary CNS lymphoma on study); 1 
subject had the MUGA scan used to determine eligibility of adequate organ function done 1 year out of 
window. 
Study BCM-001 
As of the data cut-off date of 13 Sep 2019, 2 protocol amendments were filed during the conduct of the 
study. A summary of the main changes made in each amendment is provided below: 
Amendment 1 (08 Jan 2018) 
Transformed  indolent  B-NHL  was  restricted  to  tFL;  definition  of  TNE  subjects  was  revised;  inclusion 
criterion for subjects with secondary DLBCL CNS involvement was revised. 
Amendment 2 (28 Dec 2018) 
Restricted enrolment to subjects with ECOG PS 0 to1, except for TNE subjects; exclusion criteria were 
added for subjects with vascular tumour invasion, DVT or PE within 3 months, and subjects with DVT/PE 
requiring  therapeutic  levels  of  anticoagulation.  Subjects  had  to  be  clinically  stable  prior  to  JCAR017 
infusion,  including  absence  of  active  infection,  absence  of  requirement  for  supplemental  oxygen  to 
sustain adequate oxygenation, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias, or hypotension requiring vasopressor 
support. Selection of subjects with primary or secondary CNS involvement was clarified: subjects were 
to be enrolled if the potential benefit outweighs the risk for the subject, as considered by the Investigator. 
Amendment 3 (21 Nov 2019) 
Additional details were provided for Cohorts 4 and 5. Cohort 6 (Richter’s syndrome) was removed. Cohort 
7 was added to explore the benefit/risk profile of JCAR017 outpatient treatment in Europe. Removed the 
DVT/PE/anticoagulation and vascular tumour invasion exclusion criteria as well as statements regarding 
stable disease/anticoagulation to be added to the LDC and Criteria for JCAR017 Treatment sections. 
Protocol deviations 
One  subject  in  Cohort  1  in  the  Screened  set  had  an  important  protocol  deviation;  this  subject  was 
retrospectively deemed not eligible after a biopsy at the time of disease relapse highlighted the presence 
of composite Hodgkin lymphoma/FL further confirmed to already be present at the time of study entry 
after a re-read of the baseline biopsy.

All leukapheresed set 
Study 017-001 
The DLBCL Leukapheresed Set had a median age of 62 years, with 141 of 344 subjects (41.0%) aged 
65  or  greater  and  33  of  344  subjects  (9.6%)  aged 75  or  greater.  Subjects  were  predominantly  male 
(222  of  344  subjects:  64.5%).  At  screening,  most  subjects  in  this  group  had  an  ECOG  performance 
status of 1 or 0, with 8 of 344 subjects (2.3%) having an ECOG performance status of 2. Approximately 
one-half of subjects had DLBCL NOS (165 of 344 subjects; 48.0%) followed by DLBCL transformed from 
FL  (83  of  344  subjects;  24.1%).  Additionally,  8  of  344  subjects  (2.3%)  had  CNS  involvement  by 
lymphoma at the time of infusion of JCAR017 or nonconforming product. The median time from diagnosis 
of the studied disease indication to first infusion of JCAR017 or nonconforming product was 19.2 months 
(range, 5 to 259 months). Most of the subjects (278 of 344; 80.8%) were refractory to their most recent 
prior treatment and 237 of 344 (68.9%) were chemorefractory. Fifty-eight of 344 subjects (16.9%) had 
a best prior response of PD or SD to any previous therapy, and 160 of 344 (46.5%) never achieved CR. 
Prior to LDC, 66 of 298 subjects (22.1%) had an LDH level ≥ 500 U/L and 82 of 281 subjects (29.2%) 
had  SPD  ≥  50  cm2.  The  median  number  of  prior  systemic  therapies  was  3.0  (range,  1  to  12).  One 
hundred  fifteen  of  344  subjects  (33.4%)  had  received  prior  HSCT.  Thirteen  of  344  subjects  (3.8%) 
received prior allogeneic stem cell transplant. 
Of 298 patients who underwent leukapheresis for whom Breyanzi was manufactured in the dose range 
of 44-120 × 106 CAR+ viable T cells, 229 patients received Breyanzi and 69 patients did not. The baseline

Overall Response Rate (ORR) and Complete Response Rate (CRR)  
Study 017001 (data cut-off 12 Apr 2019) 
The primary analysis, based on an earlier data cut-off date of 12 Apr 2019, showed that study 017001 
met its prespecified primary efficacy endpoint in the PAS by rejecting the null hypothesis of ORR (per 
IRC assessment) ≤ 40% (p <0.0001). It also met all key secondary efficacy endpoints including CR rate 
in the PAS, and ORR and CR rate in chemorefractory subjects in the PAS by rejecting the respective null 
hypotheses. 
Analyses in other datasets 
ORR per IRC assessment in the Leukapheresed Set for the DLBCL Cohort (ITT set) was 60.5% (95%CI 
55.1 - 65.7), and CR rate was 43.6% (95%CI 38.3 - 49.0). 
Table 12. Study 017001: Overall Response rate per IRC Assessment, DLBCL Efficacy Set and 
DLBCL Efficacy DL2S v4 Set 
In the DLBCL Efficacy Set, the median time to first CR or PR was 0.95 months (range: 0.7 to 8.9 months), 
and the median time to first CR was 0.95 months (range: 0.8 to 12.5 months). In the DLBCL Efficacy 
DL2S v4 Set, the median time to response to first CR or PR and also to first CR was the same as in the 
DLBCL Efficacy Set, although the range was narrower for time to first CR (range: 0.8 to 8.9 months). 
The ORR by Investigator in the DLBCL Efficacy Set  was similar to that using IRC assessment (73.0% 
[95%CI: 67.2 - 78.4]), as was the CR rate (52.0% [95%CI: 45.6 - 58.2]).  
Concordance  Between  IRC  and  Investigator  Assessments  in  the  DLBCL  Efficacy  Set,  defined  as  the 
number of responders from both IRC and investigator assessment plus the number of non-responders 
from  both  IRC  and  investigator  assessment,  divided  by  the  number  of  subjects  with  response 
assessments from both IRC and investigator assessment, was 90.2%.

Study BCM-001  
Data cutoff date 19 Jun 2020 
The ORR per IRC assessment in the Leukapheresed Set (ITT population) in Cohort 1 was 55.6% (95%CI 
49, 70.4), and a CR rate of 31.1% (95%CI 18.2 - 46.6). 
Table  13.  Sensitivity  Analysis  of Overall Response  Rate  Based on  IRC Assessment  (Efficacy 
Evaluable Set) 
The ORR per investigator assessment in Cohort 1 was 66.7% (95%CI 49, 81.4), and the CR rate was 
36.1% (95%CI 20.8 - 53.8). Concordance Between IRC and Investigator Assessments, defined as the 
number of responders from both IRC and investigator assessment plus the number of non-responders 
from both IRC and investigator assessment, divided by the number of subjects with responses from both 
IRC and investigator assessment, was 96.3%. 
Duration of Response (DOR), Progression-free Survival and Event-free Survival 
Study 017001 (data cut-off 12 Aug 2019) 
- DOR  
The median DOR follow-up for responders per IRC assessment (n=186) in the DLBCL Efficacy Set was 
16.4 months. At all timepoints, the most common reasons for censoring of responders were ongoing or 
completed the study. Among non-responders (n=70), all but 5 had progressed, died, or withdrawn from 
the study. In the DLBCL Efficacy DL2S v4 Set, for responders per IRC assessment (n=90), the median 
DOR follow-up was shorter (9.1 months). 
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022

In the DLBCL Efficacy Set, the median DOR by IRC was 16.8 months (95%CI 7.9-NR, see Table below). 
Table 14. Study 017001: Duration of Responses per IRC Assessment for Responders, DLBCL 
Efficacy Set and DLBCL Efficacy DL2S v4 Set 
Analysis of DOR by IRC using FDA censoring rules showed results consistent with the analysis using EMA 
censoring rules.  
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022

Median DOR by Investigator assessment using EMA censoring rules in the DLBCL Efficacy Set and DLBCL 
Efficacy DL2S v4 Set was shorter (9.2 months [95%CI 5.1 - NR] and 10.6 months [95%CI 5.3 - NR], 
respectively) when compared with median DOR based on IRC assessment using EMA censoring rules. 
This,  however,  was  consistent  with  analysis  of  DOR  in  the  DLBCL  Efficacy  Set  based  on  investigator 
assessment using FDA censoring rules, where the median DOR was 10.4 months (95%CI: 5.1 - NR). 
Analysis of DOR by BOR by Investigator in the DLBCL Efficacy Set and DLBCL Efficacy DL2S v4 Set using 
EMA censoring rules also yielded results that were similar compared to those based on IRC assessment 
using EMA censoring rules. 
Median DOR per IRC assessment (using EMA censoring rules) in the Leukapheresed Set for the DLBCL 
Cohort (ITT set) was 13.3 months (95%CI 6.6 - 21.1), with a median DOR follow-up of 16.7 months. 
After initial response, the probability of continued response at 6 and 12 months was 58.1% (95%CI 50.9 
- 64.6) and 50.2% (95%CI 43.0 - 57.0), respectively. 
- PFS 
In the DLBCL Efficacy Set, subjects had a median PFS by IRC of 6.0 months (95%CI: 3.3 - 9.0), with a 
median PFS follow-up of 17.5 months. The estimated PFS rate at 6 and 12 months was 50.0% (95%CI: 
43.6 - 56.1) and 38.4% (95%CI: 32.1- 44.6), respectively. 
 In the DLBCL Efficacy DL2S v4 Set, the median PFS was similar (5.9 months [95%CI: 3.0 - 10.0]), but 
the median PFS follow-up was shorter (12.3 months); the estimated PFS rates at 6 and 12 months were 
also similar. 
PFS per IRC assessment by BOR is summarised in figure below.

Figure 9. Study 017001: Progression-Free Survival per IRC Assessment by Best Overall 
Response, DLBCL Efficacy Set 
Analysis of PFS in the DLBCL  Efficacy Set and DLBCL Efficacy DL2S v4 Set based on IRC assessment 
using FDA censoring rules showed results consistent with the analysis using EMA censoring rules. 
Median PFS by investigator assessment using EMA censoring rules in the DLBCL Efficacy Set and DLBCL 
Efficacy DL2S v4 Set was shorter (3.9 months and 3.5 months, respectively) when compared with IRC 
assessment using EMA censoring rules, as were the estimated PFS rates at 6 months (42.5% and 44.1%, 
respectively)  and  12  months  (34.8%  and  36.9%,  respectively).  Median  PFS  based  on  investigator 
assessment using FDA censoring rules in the DLBCL Efficacy Set was also shorter (4.1 months) compared 
with IRC assessment using EMA censoring rules, as were estimated PFS rates at 6 months (43.4%) and 
12 months (36.3%). Analysis of PFS by BOR in the DLBCL Efficacy Set and DLBCL Efficacy DL2S v4 Set 
based  on  investigator  assessment  using  EMA  censoring  rules  also  yielded  results that  were  similar  to 
those based on IRC assessment using EMA censoring rules. 
Median PFS by IRC (using EMA censoring rules) in the Leukapheresed Set for the DLBCL Cohort (ITT set) 
was 4.8 months (95%CI 4.3 - 6.6), with a median PFS follow-up of 19.0 months. The PFS rate at 6 and 
12 months was 45.9% (95%CI 40.4 - 51.3) and 35.1% (95%CI 29.8 - 40.4). 
The median PFS ratio, defined as the ratio of PFS on the most recent line of therapy prior to JCAR017 to 
the  PFS  on  JCAR017  by  Investigator  assessment  was  0.65  in  the  DLBCL  Efficacy  Set  and  0.66  in the 
DLBCL Efficacy DL2S using EMA censoring rules. The PFS ratio using FDA censoring rules for the DLBCL 
Efficacy Set was consistent with that using EMA censoring rules.

Of 298 patients who underwent leukapheresis for whom Breyanzi was manufactured in the dose range 
of 44 120 × 106 CAR+ viable T cells, 229 patients received Breyanzi and 69 patients did not. The number 
of patients who were evaluable for efficacy was 216 (Efficacy set). 
Efficacy was assessed on the basis of the primary endpoint, overall response rate (ORR), and secondary 
endpoints which included complete response (CR) rate, duration of response (DOR) as determined by an 
independent  review  committee  (Table 23  and  Figure 18).  The  median  on-study  follow-up  time  was 
19.9 months (range 0.2 to 45.2 months).

The median time to response (CR or partial response [PR]) was 1.0 months (range: 0.7 to 8.9 months). 
The median time to CR was 1.0 months (range: 0.8 to 12.5 months). Response durations were longer in 
patients who achieved a CR, as compared to patients with a best response of PR.  
Six patients with secondary CNS lymphoma were treated and evaluable for efficacy in the 
017001  (TRANSCEND)  study.  Three  of  these  six  patients  achieved  a  CR;  2  of  3  patients  had  durable 
remissions of 23 months that remained ongoing at study completion. The safety profile of these patients 
with secondary CNS lymphoma was consistent with that observed in the overall population.  
In the Efficacy set, the ORR results within PMBCL and FL3B were 79% (11/14 patients) and 100% (4/4 
patients)  respectively.  CR  rates  were  50%  for  PMBCL  and  100%  for  FL3B.  The  safety  profile  was 
consistent across these subtypes.

Health-related Quality of Life 
Study 017001 
Among the 269 DLBCL Treated Set subjects in Study 017001, 181 subjects (67%) were evaluable for 
the EORTC QLQ-C30, herein defined as the PRO (EORTC QLQ-C30) Evaluable Population, and 186 (69%) 
were evaluable for the EQ-5D-5L, herein defined as the PRO (EQ-5D-5L) Evaluable Population.  
The  analysis  of  mean  changes  from  baseline  in  the  EORTC  QLQ-C30  analysis  showed  that  patients 
experienced  improvement  in  global  health  status  starting  from  Month  2  post-infusion,  and  in  fatigue 
(starting from Month 9 post-infusion). Other HRQoL domain scores remained stable up until Month 18. 
With respect to the EQ-5D-5L, at baseline, mean health index scores and EQ-VAS scores were 0.8 and 
68.3, respectively. Compliance rates, based on the PRO (EQ-5D-5L) Evaluable Population, were 65.6% 
of those who were in follow-up at Month 9 and 65.8% of those who were in follow-up at Month 18. Mean 
EQ-5D-5L health utility index scores decreased 1 month after JCAR017 infusion, which was followed by 
fluctuations in scores between Months 2 and 3, and then an improvement from Month 6 through Month 
18 compared with baseline. Mean EQ-VAS scores were higher from Month 1 through Month 18 compared 
with baseline. 
Study BCM-001 
Study subjects generally had comparable baseline scores in the primary domains of the EORTC QLQ-C30 
compared to the age- and gender-adjusted general population, except for the fatigue domain in which 
the study subjects were borderline meaningfully worse. Results from group-level analyses indicated that 
these domains were generally maintained over time following treatment with JCAR017, with a trend of 
improvement over the first 60 to 90 days. For the FACT-LymS, the results were generally similar to the 
primary domains of the EORTC QLQ-C30, with a clinically meaningful improvement observed at Day 60. 
A trend of small and gradual worsening after Day 90 was observed. It should be considered that data

Study 017001 Subgroup Analyses 
Analyses  were  performed  on  the  subgroups  pre-specified  in  the  Study  017001  SAP.  Additionally, 
subgroup  analyses  for  efficacy  were  performed  by  use  of  anticancer  therapy  for  disease  control  after 
screening, pre-LDC SPD (<50 cm2 vs ≥50 cm2 [per IRC]), pre-LDC LDH (<500 U/L vs ≥ 500 U/L), CRP 
at baseline (< 20 mg/L versus ≥20 mg/L), pre-leukapheresis ALC (<0.3 × 109/L versus ≥0.3 × 109/L), 
and ECOG PS prior to LDC (0 or 1 vs 2). Results are summarised in figures and tables below:

Secondary Central Nervous System Lymphoma at First Infusion 
Across  Studies  017001  and  BCM-001,  a  total  of  4  (57.1%)  out  of  7  efficacy-evaluable  subjects  with 
secondary CNS lymphoma prior to the first liso-cel infusion achieved a CR by IRC assessment. In Study 
017001, CR was observed in 3 of the 6 (50.0%) subjects with secondary CNS lymphoma included in the 
DLBCL Efficacy Set. Updated efficacy data demonstrated durable remission at 23 months in 2 (33.3%) 
of these subjects. For these 2 subjects, CR remains ongoing as of the data cut-off date of 19 Jun 2020. 
In Study BCM-001, the 1 subject with secondary CNS lymphoma also achieved CR per IRC assessment 
(DOR: 9.1 months). This subject experienced disease progression but was alive at the data cut-off date. 
Subjects with Prior Allogeneic Stem-cell Transplantation (HSCT) 
Seven of 256 subjects (2.7%) who were treated on Study 017001 had undergone prior allo-HSCT. Results 
in this specific subgroup are summarised in the table below.

Results in Large B-cell Lymphoma Subtypes 
With  the  updated  2016  WHO  classification,  DLBCL  NOS  is  now  defined  as  de  novo  DLBCL  and  DLBCL 
from  transformation  of  indolent  NHL.  In  addition,  the  former  group  of  double/triple  hit  lymphomas  is 
now  categorised  as  its  own  group:  high-grade  B-cell  lymphoma  MYC  and  BCL2  and/or  BCL6 
rearrangements (Swerdlow, 2016).  
Subgroup analyses of ORR, DOR, PFS, and OS per IRC assessment by LBCL subtypes are summarised in 
Tables and Figures below:

In the DLBCL Efficacy DL2S v4 Set, in subtypes with larger numbers of subjects, rates of response were 
consistent with those in the DLBCL Efficacy Set, with the exception of a lower CR rate in subjects with 
HGL  (n=18,  CR  rate  of  50%).  Subgroup  analyses  of  ORR,  DOR,  and  PFS  by  large  B-cell  lymphoma 
subtypes,  based  on  Investigator  assessment  were  also  consistent  with  the  analyses  based  on  IRC 
assessment. 
Updated subgroup analyses were provided for tiNHL (data cut-off 19 Jun 2020 and 04 Jan 2021) and 
PMBCL(data cut-off 19 Jun 2020) and are summarised in Tables below.

Data as of the 12 Aug 2019 cutoff. 
Subjects with Absolute Lymphocyte Count (ALC) Below 0.3 × 109/L Prior to Leukapheresis 
JCAR017 was successfully manufactured in 36 of the 45 (80%) subjects who had ALC <0.3 × 109/L prior 
leukapheresis  and  in  251  of  the  278  (90%)  subjects  who  had  ALC  ≥0.3  ×  109/L  prior  leukapheresis. 
Among the 269 subjects in the DLBCL Treated Set, 28 subjects had ALC <0.3 × 109/L (including 1 subject 
with <0.1 × 109/L) and 227 subjects had ALC ≥0.3 × 109/L; 14 subjects had an unknown status for ALC 
prior to leukapheresis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022  
Page 114/252 
 
 
 
 
Demographics characteristics were similar between subjects with ALC below and above 0.3 × 109/L prior 
leukapheresis. ORR and CRR results are summarised in the table below: 
Table 32. Study 017001, ALC Status Prior to Leukapheresis: Summary of Response rate per 
IRC Assessment, DLBCL Efficacy Set 
Median  DOR  was  5.3  months  (95%CI  1.6  -  NR)  in  subjects  with  ALC  <0.3  ×  109/L  and  20.2  months 
(95%CI 8.2 - NR) in subjects with ALC ≥0.3 × 109/L. Median PFS was 3.1 months (95%CI 1.8 - 11.4) 
and 6.7 months (95%CI 3.3 - 10.4), respectively, with 33.3% and 41.9% of subjects, respectively, free 
of progression at data cut-off date. The comparability of the results is limited due to the relatively small 
size of the ALC <0.3 × 109/L subset (n=27). 
Retreatment subgroup 
A total of 16 subjects in the DLBCL Treated Set received retreatment cycles with JCAR017 for PD following 
CR. The ORR per investigator assessment after retreatment cycles was 18.8% (95%CI 4.0 - 45.6), with 
a CR rate of 12.5% (95%CI 1.6 - 38.3). 
Study BCM-001 Subgroup Analyses 
Due to the small sample size, no formal subgroup analyses were performed. Preliminary results for ORR 
by IRC in Cohort 1 are summarised in Figures below.

Subjects with Follicular Lymphoma Grade 3B 
Overall,  8  subjects  in  Studies  017001  (n=4),  BCM-001  (n=2)  and  BCM-002  (n=2)  had  FL3B.  Clinical 
data were provided for the 6 subjects in Studies 017001 and BCM-001 with a data cutoff of 19 Jun 2020. 
For the 6 subjects diagnosed with FL3B by the investigators in Studies 017001 and BCM-001, additional 
histopathological data were obtained from the investigational sites that supported the diagnosis of FL3B 
as per WHO classification system in 4 subjects (Swerdlow, 2008; Swerdlow, 2017). For the remaining 2 
subjects, the diagnosis was based on pathologist’s conclusions and investigator’s clinical assessment. 
The  4  subjects  with  FL3B  in  Study  017001  were  45  to  71  years  of  age  with  3  subjects  female  and  1 
subject  male,  and  all  subjects  were  white.  One  subject  had  prior  HSCT,  and  no  subjects  received 
anticancer treatment for disease control. Median on-study follow-up time was 14.8 months (range 8.9 
to 24.0). The best response to any prior therapy was CR for 3 subjects and PR for 1 subject. Prior to 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy (LDC), no subjects had lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) ≥ 500 U/L and 1 
subject had sum of perpendicular diameters (SPD) ≥ 50 cm2. The 2 subjects from Study BCM-001 were 
48 years (female, white, Cohort 1) and 72 years of age (male, Asian, Cohort 3). Prior to LDC, neither of 
these subjects had LDH ≥ 500 U/L or ≥ 50 cm2. All 6 subjects with FL3B in both Studies 017001 and 
BCM-001 were refractory  to prior treatment, including 2 subjects receiving auto-haematopoietic stem 
cell transplant (HSCT). Subjects were European Cooperative Oncology Group performance score (ECOG) 
0 at screening. 
Updated efficacy data in subjects with FL3B (data cutoff 04 Jan 2021) are summarised in the table below.

Bridging Analysis Between Study 017001 and Study BCM-001 
Preliminary analyses suggested numerical differences in efficacy outcomes between studies 017001 and 
BCM-001 (see table below).

clinical relevance of this numerical difference in response rates between Study 017001 and Study BCM-
001 Cohort 1, an exploratory bridging analysis of response data from the studies was conducted. 
Methods 
The primary objective of this analysis was to compare the efficacy, defined as ORR and CR rate at Month 
1  and  Month  3  of  JCAR017-treated  subjects  in  Study  BCM-001  (Cohort  1)  and  Study  017001  (DLBCL 
Cohort) (Bridging Analysis Sets), adjusting for differences in key clinical factors. The secondary endpoints 
were DOR and PFS.  
Eligibility criteria in Study BCM-001 (Cohort 1) were similar to those in Study 017001. Since study BCM-
001 did not enrol subjects with tiNHL and PMBCL, these subsets were excluded from the Bridging Analysis 
Set, which eventually included all subjects who had received the JCAR017 cell product (manufactured 
using process v.4), in accordance with DP release specifications at a single dose of 100 x 106 CAR+ T 
cells, and had at least 1 month follow-up after their first infusion. 
The  variables  included  in  the  logistic  model  were  selected  as  they  identified  study  subjects  with  high 
tumour  burden  (SPD  and  LDH),  high  inflammatory  state  (CRP)  or  a  higher  risk  for  a  poor  treatment 
outcome  (increased  age,  higher  ECOG  PS,  more  prior  lines  of  treatment).  The  pre-lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy (LDC) visit was chosen as the timepoint for LDH, SPD, CRP, and ECOG PS measures. If 
pre-LDC  measures  were  not  available,  measures  before  Study  Day  1  (baseline)  or  at  screening  were 
used as the second and third choice, respectively. 
As requested by the CHMP, additional sensitivity analyses were performed as follows: 
- Model 1 adjusted for IPI components at screening such as number of extranodal sites ≥ 2, Ann Arbor 
disease stage > 2, age > 60 years, LDH > ULN, ECOG PS (0, 1, or 2), as well as bulky disease (longest 
target  lesion  ≥  10  cm),  relapsed  to  the  last  therapy,  number  of  prior  lines  of  therapy,  and  use  of 
anticancer therapy for disease control 
- Model 2 adjusted for IPI score > 2, bulky disease at screening, relapsed to the last therapy, number of 
prior lines of therapy, and use of anticancer therapy for disease control 
Logistic regression models, including the study indicator and the factors listed above as covariates, were 
fitted to ORR and CR rate outcomes at 1 and 3 months separately. One month and 3 months were chosen 
to control for length of follow-up, so there is no systematic bias introduced with longer timepoints where 
responses would have more chance to evolve. To mitigate the issue of small sample size of the BCM-001 
data, a Bayesian approach was used in addition to the classical logistic regression approach. The Bayesian 
approach was implemented with R-package Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) package (Martin, 2019) 
using a proper diffused prior with 0.0003 precision. For the Bayesian approach, the posterior distribution, 
posterior mean, median and 95% credible interval of rate differences (BCM-001 versus 017001 Bridging 
Analysis  Sets)  were  reported.  Trace  plots  for  each  parameter  in  each  model  were  checked.  For  the 
classical logistic regression approach, the rate difference estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
were calculated by Gcomputation as implemented in R-package Regression Standardization (Sjolander, 
2019). Standard logistic model outputs were also presented. 
Results 
Of the 40 subjects who received 100 x 106 CAR+ T cells drug product in Study BCM 001, 4 subjects who 
received nonconforming product were excluded from the D120 Bridging Analysis Set. Thus, 36 subjects 
from Cohort 1 of Study BCM-001 were included in the D120 Bridging Analysis Set. 
In  Study  017001,  150  of  the  257  subjects  in  the  DLBCL  Efficacy  Set  were  excluded  from  the  D120 
Bridging Analysis Set, including 87 subjects treated with dose regimens other than DL2S, 49 subjects

who received liso-cel manufactured with a process other than v4, 12 subjects with PMBCL, and 2 subjects 
with tiNHL. Thus, 107 subjects from Study 017001 were included in the D120 Bridging Analysis Set. 
The bridging analysis was performed using the data cutoff date of 19 Jun 2020 (corresponding to the 
BCM-001 Cohort 1 primary analysis). Baseline characteristics were similar across studies, except for the 
use of anticancer therapy  for disease control that was more frequent in Study BCM-001 compared to 
Study 017001 (75.0% versus 47.7%). 
Additional baseline disease characteristics, which were included in the adjustment Model 1 and Model 2: 
subjects from Study BCM-001 had a higher tumour  burden compared to subjects from Study 017001 
with a higher proportion of subjects with ≥ 2 extranodal sites (41.7% versus 27.1%), a higher proportion 
of  subjects  with  bulky  disease  (longest  target  diameter  ≥10  cm;  16.7%  versus  8.4%),  a  higher 
proportion of subjects with LDH >ULN (75.0% versus 53.3%), and a higher proportion of subjects with 
IPI >2 (50.0% versus 38.3%). 
Unadjusted response rates (ORR and CR rate) based on IRC assessment at Months 1 and 3 are presented 
in the table below for the primary and D120 Bridging Analyses.

After adjustment for the baseline factors with the Original Adjustment Model, the peak of distribution 
shifted to 0 for ORR and CR rate at Month 1. At Month 3, the peak of distribution is close to 0 both before 
and after the adjustment, demonstrating that the response rates were already similar between studies 
without  adjustment.  Adjustment  for  baseline  factors  improved  comparability  at  Month  1;  Month  3 
responses were similar even before adjustment. 
Sensitivity analyses using Bayesian logistic models 1 and 2 also improved comparability in the CR rate 
at Month 1 between the 2 studies, while the adjustment effect on the ORR rate at Month 1 was minimal. 
The ORR and CR rate at Month 3 were similar between the 2 studies, even prior to adjustment.

Duration of Response 
The Kaplan Meier (KM) estimate for median DOR in the Bridging Analysis Set was 8.67 months (95% CI: 
3.88, NR) for Study 017001 and 3.50 months (95% CI:2.33, NR) for Study BCM-001. Overall, adjustment 
using Models 1 and 2 minimally improved the comparability of the DOR rate between the 2 studies. In 
the  Intent-to-treat  (ITT)  Analysis  Set,  adjustment  using  these  models  minimally  improved  the 
comparability of the DOR rate between the 2 studies. 
Progression-free Survival

The KM estimate for median PFS in the Bridging Analysis Set was 4.99 months (95% CI: 3.02, 11.4) for 
Study 017001 and 3.25 months (95% CI: 2.99, 6.9) for Study BCM-001. Adjustment using these models 
slightly improved comparability of the PFS rate between the 2 studies. Overall, adjustment effect was 
minimal, similar to what was observed in the DOR analyses. In the ITT Analysis Set, adjustment using 
these models slightly improved the comparability of PFS rate between the 2 studies. 
Overall Survival 
The KM estimate for median OS in the Bridging Analysis Set was 19.88 months (95% CI: 9.0, NR) for 
Study 017001 and 18.56 months (95% CI: 6.28, NR) for Study BCM-001. The estimates of OS rates at 
all the specified timepoints were already similar between the 2 studies with overlapping CIs prior to the 
adjustment. In the ITT Analysis Set, the estimates of OS rates at all the specified timepoints were already 
similar between the 2 studies with overlapping CIs prior to the adjustment.

Methods 
The  SLR  was  performed  in  accordance  with  the  Cochrane  Handbook  for  Systematic  Reviews  of 
Interventions  and  reported  in  alignment  with  the  Preferred  Reporting  Items  for  Systematic  Literature 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Higgins JPT, 2011, Moher, 2009).  
The database search was restricted to the publication years 01 Jan 2003 through 02 Dec 2019 since the 
first trial for rituximab, the SOC in newly diagnosed large B-cell lymphomas, was published in 2002. The 
last updated was conducted on 02 Dec 2019. 
Potentially 
eligible 
studies  were 
screened 
by 
two 
independent 
reviewers.  Allowed 
interventions/comparators  included  single-agent  or  multiagent  chemotherapy,  chemoimmunotherapy, 
single-agent or multiagent immunotherapy, CAR T-cell therapies, allo-HSCT, auto-HSCT, best supportive 
care, placebo and no comparator. Studies had to have ≥25 patients by treatment arm (or ≥50 patients 
per  study).  Studies  had  to  be  conducted  in  one  or  more  of  the  following  countries:  Belgium,  the 
Netherlands, Switzerland, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the UK, 
the US, Japan, Australia, and Canada. 
Quality assessment checklists for either trials or observational studies were completed for each study 
using checklists recommended by NICE (2009). All  publications were assessed, except for conference 
proceedings, due to insufficient methodological data to assess study quality.

Figure 25. PRISMA Flow Diagram 
A  total  of  4  RCTs,  19  Phase  1  or  2  single-arm  trials,  and  22  observational  studies  (3  prospective,  19 
retrospective)  were identified  in  the literature  search.  Forty-two  studies  (93%)  included  patients  with 
DLBCL,  while  three  studies  (7%)  only  included  patients  with  PMBCL  (Armand,  2019,  Herrera,  2019, 
Zinzani, 2017). No studies exclusively enrolled patients with FL3B.  
Across  studies  that  only  enrolled  patients  with  DLBCL,  the  median  age  ranged  from  52  to  73  years. 
Twelve  studies  included  patients  with  PMBCL  and/or  FL3B  in  addition  to  DLBCL.  The  percentage  of 
patients with PMBCL in this SLR ranged from 1% to 13% of the study population. FL3B was reported in 
only 3 studies and represented 1% to 9% of the study population. In the three studies that exclusively 
enrolled patients with PMBCL, median age ranged from 33 to 35.5 years and the proportion of female 
participants was higher than in studies that enrolled patients with DLBCL (54% to 57%) (Armand, 2019, 
Herrera, 2019, Zinzani, 2017). 
Four studies included agents that have been approved in the EU for use in the 3L+ r/r DLBCL indication: 
axicabtagene  ciloleucel  (Locke,  2019),  tisagenlecleucel  (Schuster,  2019d),  polatuzumab  vedotin  plus 
bendamustine  and  rituximab  (Sehn,  2020),  and  pixantrone  dimaleate  (Pettengell,  2012,  Pettengell, 
2016). Of these trials, three only included patients with DLBCL, while ZUMA-1 (axicabtagene ciloleucel) 
also included patients with PMBCL (8% of study population). The median age of the study populations 
was slightly lower in the two studies that evaluated CAR T-cell therapies (56 to 58 years) than those 
evaluating pixantrone (60 years) or polatuzumab vedotin (67 years).  
Overall  response  rate,  CR,  and  partial  response  (PR)  were  reported  in  36  (80%),  34  (76%),  and  27 
(60%)  studies,  respectively.  Duration  of  response  was  reported  in  20  (44%)  studies.  Overall  survival

was reported by 35 (77%) studies and PFS was reported by 30 (67%) studies. Event-free survival was 
infrequently reported (5 studies, 11%). 
Three  major  categories  of  interventions  were  identified:  CAR  T-cell  therapies  (n=8  studies),  salvage 
therapy (n=32 studies), and HSCT (n=5 studies).  
CAR T-cell therapies 
Please, see the MAIC analysis below. 
Salvage therapies 
In  patients  with  DLBCL  of  unreported  subtypes,  ORRs  ranged  from  4.9%  to  59.5%  (Brown,  2018, 
Morschhauser, 2019), CR rates ranged from 0% to 32.8% (Brown, 2018, Kahl, 2019), and DOR ranged 
from 4.6 months to 20.1 months (Jurczak, 2018, Witzig, 2011). The DOR of 20.1 months was observed 
in a study of patients with DLBCL who received MOR208 monotherapy (tafasitamab), an investigational 
product. This study included some patients being treated in the 2L setting (34%), with 69% of patients 
being refractory to a prior rituximab regimen. In one study of patients with DLBCL NOS (n=56), the ORR 
of patients treated with polatuzumab vedotin plus bendamustine and rituximab (n=29) was 35%, and 
the CR rate 31% (Sehn, 2018). Duration of response was not reported. In the single study that reported 
on patients with DLBCL transformed from indolent NHL (n=88), although ORR was not reported, 42% of 
patients achieved CR with R-GemOx (Cazelles, 2019). Duration of response was not reported. In patients 
with DLBCL of unreported subtypes, median OS ranged from 4.4 months (Van Den Neste, 2016) to 20.1 
months  (Morschhauser,  2019),  median  PFS  ranged  from  1.9  months  (Palomba,  2019)  to  5.6  months 
(Morschhauser, 2019), and median follow-up time ranged from 7.5 months (Kahl, 2019) to 51 months 
(Zaja, 2018). Patients receiving polatuzumab vedotin with bendamustine and rituximab (n=29) had a 
median OS and median PFS of 11.5 months and 6.0 months, respectively. (Sehn, 2018). Another study 
reported on patients with DLBCL transformed from indolent NHL (n=88) and patients with no previous 
indolent  NHL  (n=108)  receiving  R-GemOx:  among  patients  with  DLBCL  transformed  from  previous 
indolent lymphoma, median OS was 21 months and median PFS was 3 months, compared to a median 
OS of 8 months and median PFS of 6 months in DLBCL patients without previous indolent NHL (Cazelles, 
2019). 
Two  studies  reported  response  outcomes  in  patients  with  PMBCL  (Armand,  2019,  Zinzani,  2019a). 
Treatment with nivolumab and brentuximab vedotin (n=30) was associated with an ORR of 73% and a 
CR rate of 37%, while median OS and PFS were not reached with a median follow-up time of 11.1 months 
(Zinzani, 2019a), and treatment with pembrolizumab (n=53) was associated with an ORR of 45% and a 
CR rate of 13%. Patients treated with pembrolizumab did not reach a median OS and had a median PFS 
of 5.5 months at a median follow-up of 12.5 months (Armand, 2019). Duration of response and median 
OS was not reached in either study. 
No study presented results specific to patients with FL3B. 
In  patients  with  a  median  of  two  prior  lines  of  therapy,  ORRs  and  CR  rates  ranged  from  3%  to  73% 
(Ansell, 2019, Zinzani, 2019a) and 0% to 37% (Ansell, 2019, Zinzani, 2019a), respectively. Duration of 
response  was  8.6  to  14.5  months  (Coiffier,  2016,  Zaja,  2018).  Objective  response  rates  reported  in 
studies of patients with a median of three prior lines of therapy were slightly lower (ORR, 4.9% to 59.5%) 
Complete response rates and DOR in studies of patients with a median of three prior lines of therapy 
were 0% to 32.8% (Brown, 2018, Kahl, 2019) and 4.8 to 13.4 months (Kahl, 2019, Morschhauser, 2019), 
respectively. Survival outcomes did not differ with increasing median prior lines of therapy. The range of 
median OS across studies was similar in studies of patients with a median of three prior lines of therapy 
(4.6 months to 10.09 months) (Kahl, 2019, Pettengell, 2016) and in those of patients with a median of 
two prior lines of therapy (3.4 months to 12.4 months) (Eyre, 2016, Sehn, 2020). The longest survival 
rates  were  observed  in  patients  who  received  pixantrone  (16.1  months)  (Pettengell,  2016)  and 
Assessment report

polatuzumab vedotin plus rituximab (20.1 months) (Morschhauser, 2019) after a median of three lines 
of therapy. Median PFS was also similar in studies of patients with a median 3 prior lines of therapy (1.41 
months to 6.3 months) (Ansell, 2019, Pettengell, 2016) and those with a median 2 prior lines of therapy 
(2 months to 9.5 months) (Eyre, 2016, Sehn, 2020). The longest reported median PFS were observed 
in studies of therapies approved for DLBCL (polatuzumab vedotin plus bendamustine and rituximab: 6.7 
months; pixantrone: 5.7 months) (Pettengell, 2012, Sehn, 2020). 
Comparison with CAR T-treated Populations in Real-world Setting in Europe 
To assess external validity of outcomes observed from Study 017001 and generalisability to the European 
target  population,  the  applicant  conducted  a  systematic  literature  review  (SLR)  to  identify  literature 
published on the treatment of CAR T- cell therapy in large B-cell lymphomas in the RW setting. The SLR 
searched MEDLINE and Embase via the Ovid platform up to 30 Nov 2020 and conference websites during 
2018 to 2020 in accordance with methods recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration’s Handbook for 
Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins, 2019). Results were reported according to the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines (Moher, 2009).  
Overall, 17 of the 87 identified publications reported RW CAR T use in Europe-only populations. These 
included a cohort (N = 116) from France (Vercellino, 2020) and another cohort (N = 183) from the UK 
(Kuhnl, 2020) which currently represent the largest published RW CAR T-treated populations in Europe. 
The French cohort included all consecutive patients with R/R DLBCL treated in 5 French Lymphoma Study 
Association  centres  between  June  2018  and  January  2020,  whereas  the  UK  cohort  included  patients 
treated  in  the  first  12  months  of  the  national  programme.  A  side-by-side  comparison  of  the  baseline 
demographic and disease characteristics of the UK and French RW cohorts versus Studies 017001 and 
BCM-001 is presented in the table below. The comparison is made based on the JCAR017-treated Set 
from both 017001 and BCM-001 studies to better align with the populations represented in the UK and 
French cohorts.

Indirect Treatment Comparison of CAR T-cell Therapies in Clinical Studies 
In  line  with  prior  Committee  for  Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use  (CHMP)  Scientific  Advice 
(EMEA/H/SA/3617/1/2017/ADT/PR/III),  the  applicant  performed  a  systematic  literature  review  (SLR) 
that was included in the MAA (SLR Report). The SLR was conducted for the search period of 01 Jan 2003 
to 02 Dec 2019 on the efficacy and safety of treatments for R/R LBCL in the 3L+ therapy. Study selection 
criteria  were  established  a  priori  to  inform  the  identification  of  relevant  clinical  studies.  Of  the  45 
identified studies (including salvage chemotherapy and CAR T-cell therapies), two pivotal studies led to 
the approval of CAR T-cell therapies in the EU: the ZUMA-1 trial (Locke, 2019) for axi-cel and the JULIET 
trial (Schuster, 2019) for tisagenlecleucel. A summary of datasets used in this analysis is shown in the 
table below.

Table 40. Summary of datasets Used for Matching -adjusted Indirect Treatment Comparisons 
Clinical factors, most commonly baseline patient characteristics (eg, demographics, disease status) but 
also related to trial protocol (eg, eligibility criteria, receipt of bridging therapy), were identified through 
a targeted literature search of evidence on clinical factors prognostic of outcomes in 3L+ R/R LBCL, an 
inspection of factors reported in the Study 017001, ZUMA-1 and JULIET, as well as clinical expert input. 
A panel of 5 external clinical experts was established to further guide the identification and rank-order 
of clinical factors based on relative importance. Furthermore, statistical analyses using Study 017001 
patient-level data were conducted to evaluate the strength of association of each clinical factor and each 
efficacy  outcome  and  clinical  factors  were  then  ranked  on  this  basis  (ie,  data-driven  rank).  Of  the 
statistical methods considered, random forest regression (Breiman, 2001) was chosen as the method to 
obtain  data-driven  rankings,  because  it  has  been  shown  to  demonstrate  superior  predictive  power 
compared to the other methods considered and has a natural metric for variable ranking.  
Results of Liso-cel versus Tisagenlecleucel are summarised in the table and figures below.

Efficacy results from MAICs in the ITT Population were consistent with those in infused patients. 
Adjusted  TEAEs  and  AESIs  in  infused  patients  showed  that  the  safety  profiles  between  liso-cel  and 
tisagenlecleucel were similar, with the exception of all-grade and Grade ≥ 3 CRS and Grade ≥ 3 prolonged 
cytopenia by laboratory assessment, the odds of which were statistically significantly lower for liso-cel 
(all-grade CRS: OR 0.52 [95% CI: 0.31, 0.87]; Grade ≥ 3 CRS: OR 0.10 [95% CI: 0.03, 0.31]; Grade 
≥ 3 prolonged cytopenia by laboratory assessment: OR: 0.43 [95% CI: 0.26, 0.73]). 
The results from MAICs of liso-cel versus axi-cel are summarised in the table and figures below.

Study  NDS-NHL-001  -  A  Global,  Non-Interventional,  Retrospective,  Multi-Center  Study  To 
Generate  Real-World  Evidence  Of  Treatment  Outcomes  In  Patients  With  R/R  Large  B-Cell 
Lymphoma (Third Line Of Therapy And Beyond) 
Methods 
Study  NDS-NHL-001  was  conducted  to  describe  treatment  patterns  and  evaluate  clinical  outcomes  in 
patients diagnosed with R/R LBCL since 2003 or later who were being treated in RW clinical oncology 
settings.  The  study  population  consists  of  subjects  who  had  received  prior  treatment  with  an 
anthracycline and rituximab (or another CD20-targeting agent), and who had started a subsequent line 
of therapy. 
Study design is summarised in the figure below. 
Figure 30. Study design, NDS-NHL-001 
The  acquired  real-world  data  (RWD)  were  integrated  and  harmonised  to  conform  to  a  standardised, 
common  data  model  (CDM)  for  the  analyses  detailed  herein.  Patients  from  this  study  are  hereafter 
referred to as RW patients. 
JCAR017-treated subjects who were included in the DBLCL Cohort JCAR017-treated Efficacy Analysis Set 
(i.e., DLBCL Efficacy Set) from Study 017001 were used for comparisons with the RW patients.  
A summary of the RW and Study 017001 analysis cohorts is provided in the table below. 
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022  
Page 140/252 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 43. Updated Analysis Cohorts 
The  index  date  for  the  RW  patients  in  the  primary  analysis  was  analytically  assigned  as  the  date  of 
initiation of the first qualifying LOT after previous exposure to an anthracycline and rituximab (or other 
CD20-targeting agent) and the completion of at least 2 prior LOTs (i.e. LOT3 or beyond). For subjects in 
Study 017001, the date of JCAR017 infusion was used as the index date. In the leukapheresed cohort 
and in the LDCC, the start dates of leukapheresis and LDC, respectively, were used as index dates. 
For the RW patient FUP was calculated starting from the index date and ending with the completion of a 
maximum  of  24  months  of  observation  (to  correspond  with  the  maximum  follow-up  time  in  Study 
017001), initiation of a subsequent LOT, HSCT, loss to follow-up (ie, date of last contact with the study 
site or date of last data in the study database), or death, whichever occurred first. 
Progression-free survival was defined as time from index date to first documentation of PD, relapse death 
due to any cause, or end of the 24-month FUP, whichever occurs first. Duration of response was defined 
as duration of time from first investigator assessed best response (of PR or better) to documented PD, 
relapse, death from any cause, or end of FUP, whichever occurs first. PFS and DOR were not censored at 
start of new therapy after index date. Overall survival was defined as the time from the index date to 
death  due  to  any  cause  or  end  of  the  24-month  FUP,  whichever  comes  first.  Patients  who  died  were 
considered as having events occurring on the date of death. Patients who were alive were censored on 
the last-known-alive date, the data cut-off date (if applicable) or the end of maximum 24-month FUP, 
whichever was earlier. Censoring did not occur at the time of HSCT or at initiation of the next LOT. For 
Study 017001, data up to the cut-off date of 12 Aug 2019 are included in the RWE analysis.  
As a conservative measure, the analysis allowed for as much as 15% overall missing data for covariates 
prognostic for the outcome (de Goeij, 2013; Dong, 2013; McNeish, 2017). The final PS model eventually 
included age, sex, months since diagnosis, number of prior LOTs per year since diagnosis to the index 
date,  best  response  to  any  prior  therapy,  relapsed  or  refractory  to  last  therapy,  prior  HSCT, 
chemorefractory or chemosensitive to last therapy, bulky disease and extranodal disease. In addition to 
these covariates, the PS model for patients with a first diagnosis of LBCL in 2010 or later also included 
disease histology and the PS model for patients with non-missing ECOG performance status also included 
disease histology, serum LDH, and active CNS involvement. 
Stabilised inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW) and matched-pair analysis were used as the 
primary analysis methods. To address the possible bias of RW cohorts towards longer survival outcomes 
by  being  indexed  at  an  earlier line  of therapy  compared  with  the  JTAC,  two main  sensitivity  analyses 
were performed: 
- Sensitivity analysis 1 (SA1) restricted the subjects in the JTAC to those with only 2 prior lines of therapy 
(JTAC-2L) and for whom JCAR017 infusion was third line. 
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022  
Page 141/252 
 
 
 
 
-  Sensitivity  analysis  2  (SA2)  matched  RW  patients  to  subjects  in  the  JTAC  with  a  similar  categorical 
distribution of prior lines of therapy. This method generated the stratified Analytic Comparator Cohort 
(sACC). 
The  primary  analysis  was  performed  using  the  Generalised  Linear  Model  and  the  Cox  Proportional 
Hazards (CPH) model for time to first event, with adjustment for confounding factors using PS produced 
with stabilised IPTW for each balanced imputed dataset.  
Blinded analysis was conducted for RW patients in the ACC. However, after analysts were unblinded to 
outcome  data,  it  was  found  that  15  patients  did  not  have  investigator  response  assessments  and  1 
patient had inconsistencies in the start and end dates of the qualifying LOT and thus, should have been 
excluded from the analyses. After excluding these 16 patients from the ACC, the resulting ACC of 407 
patients was used to generate PS and IPTWs. 
Results 
Comparison Between European and US Real-world Patients 
In general, demographic and baseline disease characteristics were similar between European and US RW 
patients. Comparisons between cohorts for IPI score and disease stage are limited due to the extent of 
missing data, particularly for US RW patients. Of note, European RW patients were slightly younger than 
patients from the US (median age: 58.0 years versus 64.0 years, with 10.6% being ≥ 75 years of age 
versus 20.2%, respectively), and a lower percentage of European RW patients was male compared to 
US  patients  (54.3%  versus  65.2%,  respectively).  A  higher  percentage of  European  RW  patients  were 
refractory to their last therapy compared with those from the US (94.7% versus 87.8%, respectively), 
with 29.8% of European RW patients having achieved a CR to any prior therapy compared with 36.2% 
of the US RW patients. Median LDH was higher in European RW patients compared to those from the US 
(447  U/L  versus  280  U/L,  respectively).  A  similar  percentage  of  European  and  US  RW  patients  had 
received  prior  HSCT  (7.4%  and  12.2%,  respectively)  and  had  bulky  disease  (18.1%  versus  22.0%, 
respectively). 
The unadjusted analysis suggested a numerically lower ORR in RW patients from Europe compared with 
RW patients from the US (33.0% [95% CI: 23.6, 43.4] versus 41.8% [95% CI: 36.0, 47.8], respectively. 
After median follow-up times of 7.5 months for European RW patients and 5.9 months for RW patients 
from the US, similar percentages of patients were alive (16.0% and 17.1%, respectively). The median 
unadjusted PFS was similar in RW patients from Europe and those from the US (3.1 months [95% CI: 
2.2, 4.0] and 2.3 months [95% CI: 2.0, 2.6], respectively).  
Median  follow-up  time  for  all  surviving  patients  was  longer  for  European  RW  patients  compared  with 
those from the US (24.0 months versus 18.3 months, respectively. At the end of the follow-up, 30.9% 
of the European RW patients were alive compared with 39.0% of RW patients from the US. The median 
unadjusted OS was 7.6 months (95% CI: 5.7, 11.7) for European RW patients and 8.0 months (95% CI: 
6.2, 10.4) for RW patients from the US. 
After balancing using stabilised IPTW, all selected baseline covariates were well balanced, and there were 
no statistically significant differences between European and US RW patients with respect to ORR, PFS 
or OS. These results suggest that European and US patients with 3L+ DLBCL treated in routine clinical 
practice have similar outcomes. 
Comparison between RW patients and patients in study 017001  
Generally,  the  demographics  and  baseline  characteristics  were  comparable  between  the  QCC  and  the 
JTAC (see table below).

Table 44: Study NDS-NHL-001: Covariate balance before and after balancing using stabilised 
IPTW of real-world and JCAR017-treated analysis cohorts 
A  higher  percentage  of  patients  in  the  QCC  were  refractory  to  their  last  prior  treatment  (i.e.,  LOT2) 
compared with subjects in the JTAC (88.9% versus 75.0%, respectively). 
The demographics, baseline disease characteristics, and prior treatments in the LKC and the LDCC were 
similar to those of the JTAC.  
Results  of  the primary  and  sensitivity  analyses  show  a  significantly  higher  response  rate  and  survival 
benefit in the JTAC compared with the ACC (see table below):

JCAR017-Treated Analysis Cohorts, Primary and Sensitivity Analysis 
Although DOR numerically favoured the JTAC over the ACC (HR <1), the comparison was not statistically 
significant (p=0.1514), most likely due to a relatively small proportion of responders in the ACC.  
The  results  of  the  sensitivity  analyses  adjusted  for  inverse  probability  of  treatment  weights  (IPTW) 
support the primary analysis.  
Median follow-up times for surviving subjects in the LKC and LDCC were 15.0 months and 14.4 months, 
respectively. Overall survival was significantly longer in the LKC compared with the ACC (16.6 months 
vs.  9.4  months;  HR=0.77;  95%CI  0.60-0.99;  p=0.0436).  Additionally,  consistent  with  the  primary 
analyses, median PFS was statistically significantly longer in the LKC compared with the ACC (4.6 months 
versus 2.2 months; HR=0.53; 95%CI 0.44-0.65; p<0.0001). 
Consistent results were observed across subgroups, including age, sex, and bridging therapy (i.e., use 
of anticancer therapy for disease control). 
In total, 323 of the 407 patients in the ACC had a first LBCL diagnosis in 2010 or later. Consistent with 
the primary analyses, the following were significantly higher in the JTAC compared with the RW patients 
with a first LBCL diagnosis in 2010 or later: ORR adjusted for stabilised IPTW (73.8% versus 47.7%; 
RR=1.5; 95%CI 1.2 - 2.0; p<0.0001); PFS (3.3 months vs 2.5 months; HR=0.64; 95%CI: 0.43 - 0.97; 
p = 0.0361) with median follow-up times of 10.6 months vs 6.1 months. The median OS in patients in 
the ACC with a first diagnosis in 2010 or later was numerically longer than that of the overall ACC (12.9 
months versus 9.4 months, respectively) In this analysis, OS  numerically favoured the JTAC over the

ACC, although the result did not reach statistical significance (20.5 versus 12.9 months; HR=0.76; 95% 
CI 0.51 - 1.15; p=0.1973). 
Comparison with Real-World CAR T Patients 
For  subgroup  analyses  of  RW  CAR  T  patients,  the  index  date  was  defined  as  the  date  of  CAR  T-cell 
infusion,  in  order  to  align with  the  index  date  for  the  JTAC.  A  summary  of  demographic  and  baseline 
disease  characteristics  for  RW  patients  who  received  CAR  T-cell  therapy  in  the  3L+  LBCL  multisource 
data asset and for those who met QCC eligibility criteria is presented in Table 46.  
Real-world patients in the QCC who received CAR Tcell therapy ranged in age from 20 years old to 81 
years old and approximately two-thirds were male. The majority of patients had a diagnosis of DLBCL 
not otherwise specified (NOS) and ECOG performance status of 1. The type of CAR T-cell therapy was 
unspecified for all but 2 patients who had received Yescarta (axi-cel). 
Table 46. Selected Demographics and Baseline Disease Characteristics for Real-world Patients 
with CAR T-cell Therapy 
The  insufficient  number  of  RW  patients  and  limited  follow-up  in  these  analyses  does  not  allow  for 
meaningful comparison of outcomes in the CAR T QCC and the JTAC. As such, no PS adjustments were 
made  prior  to  the  analysis  of  outcomes  and  no  formal  statistical  testing  was  conducted.  Unadjusted 
analyses for ORR, DOR, PFS, and OS are presented in the table below.

Table 47. Unadjusted Comparative Effectiveness Results for Real-world Patients with CAR T-
cell Therapy 
Given the potential population imbalances, unobserved confounding factors, and the differences in 
follow-up time between the CAR T QCC and the JTAC, these results must be interpreted with caution. 
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Studies 017001 and BCM-001 
Pivotal study 017001 included a dose-finding and an expansion Phase, and was planned according to an 
adaptive seamless design, with preliminary data from the dose-finding cohorts informing enrolment in 
larger expansion and “confirmation” cohorts. Such seamless approaches are theoretically characterised 
by a higher risk of overestimating the true clinical effect. As highlighted in previous scientific advice (SA) 
procedures, consistency of results across different JCAR017 studies is, therefore, of pivotal importance. 
Similar  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  were  adopted  in  studies  017001  and  BCM-001  to  select  an  adult 
patient  population  with  r/r  aggressive  mature  B-cell  lymphomas.  B-cell  lymphomas  with  a  large  cell 
histology (as defined in the 2016 updated WHO classification of lymphoid neoplasms) are a broad class 
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022  
Page 146/252 
 
 
 
 
 
of  lymphoproliferative  neoplasms  which  includes  conditions  characterised  by  distinct  clinical/biological 
features and prognosis: high heterogeneity was, therefore, anticipated.  
Histological  confirmation  of  diagnosis  was  required,  including  CD19  expression  for  subjects  who  had 
received  previous  CD19-targeted  therapies:  limited  data  is  currently  available  for  patients  with  prior 
CD19-directed therapy and confirmed CD19-positive relapse (n=12), whereas  no data is  available for 
patients with no detectable CD19 tumour expression after prior CD19-directed therapy. Local testing to 
confirm CD19 expression in patients treated previously with CD19-targeted therapy is recommended to 
inform the decision to proceed with JCAR017 treatment. Data on patients previously treated with CD19-
targeted therapy has been included in the SmPC Section 5.1, with additional information in Section 4.4, 
highlighting that clinical experience with JCAR017 in patients exposed to prior CD19-directed therapy is 
limited.  
Only patients who had prior therapy with anthracyclines and rituximab (or other CD20-targeted agents) 
and with relapsed or refractory disease after at least 2 lines of therapy or after auto-HSCT were eligible. 
Limited information was available for subjects who received JCAR017 after prior allogeneic HSCT and for 
subjects who underwent allogeneic HSCT following JCAR017: this is reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
The  dose  range  allowed  per  current  release  specifications  (44  to  120  x  106  CAR+  T  cells)  and 
recommended  in  SmPC  section  4.2  reflects  the  clinical  experience  as  observed  at  the  assigned  DL1 
(administered dose range: 44 – 104 x 106 CAR T cells) and DL2 (administered dose range: 45 – 120 x 
106 CAR T cells) in study 017001 and in study BCM-001 (administered dose range: 71 - 103 x 106 CAR 
T cells). Consistency of efficacy and safety was demonstrated across this dose range compared to the 
overall clinical experience with JCAR017 (DL1 + DL2 + DL3; administered dose range: 44 – 156 x 106 
CAR T cells). With regard to efficacy, in study 017001 95%CIs for ORR, CR rate, median DOR, PFS and 
OS  and  probability  of  continued  DOR,  PFS  and  OS  at  all  timepoints  from  6  up  to  24  months  were 
overlapping, although some variability in point estimates could be observed in the smaller subgroups 
(e.g. lower point estimates for ORR and CR rate in lower and upper bounds, lower point estimates for 
median PFS and OS at the upper bounds). K-M plots for DOR, PFS and OS for all subgroups were also 
overlapping, showing a similar profile evolving towards a plateau phase. Consistency of efficacy was also 
observed  between  the  ±  20%  of  assigned  DL2,  mid-range  of  recommended  dose  range  and 
recommended dose range subgroups in study BCM-001 (in the upper range group, there were too few 
subjects  to  make  meaningful  comparisons).  With  regard  to  safety,  subgroup  analyses  showed 
consistency  of  toxicity  across  the  recommended  dose  range.  In  study  017001  a  numerically  higher 
incidence  of  all-grade  CRS,  all-grade  iiNT,  and  Grade  ≥  3  infection  was  observed  at  assigned  DL3 
compared to the lower assigned dose levels (DL1 and DL2). This is consistent with retrospective logistic 
regression modelling which also suggested a potential relationship between increased administered dose 
and  increased  incidence  of  these  AEs.  Therefore,  the  recommended  dose  range  excludes  subjects 
assigned to DL3, which included subjects receiving the highest doses administered in Study 017001.  
The  available  data  support  pooling  of  results  across  manufacturing  process  versions  and  LVV 
manufacturers; given the very limited data (n=7) currently available with JCAR017 manufactured using 
the  LVV  in  its  final  commercial  version  for  the  EU  patients,  further  clinical  data  with  the  intended 
commercial product version/vector will be provided post-approval from the post-authorisation registry 
study BCM-005 (with at least 750 subjects anticipated to receive JCAR017 manufactured with this LVV) 
and in the ongoing study BCM-001 (with 24 subjects anticipated to receive JCAR017 manufactured with 
this LVV).  
JCAR017 is manufactured as two distinct CD4+ cell component and CD8+ cell component administered 
in a fixed 1:1 ratio; no other CD4+/CD8+ cell components ratio was prospectively investigated. However, 
due  to  overestimation  issues  with  the  indirect  CAR+  T-cell  quantification  technique,  patients  in  study 
017001 received products with CD4+/CD8+ cell components ratios comprised between 0.73 and 2.20. 
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022  
Page 147/252 
 
 
 
Multivariate  and  univariate  logistic  analyses  showed  that  a  0.2  increase  in  the  CD4+/CD8+  cell 
components ratio resulted in a 30% and 17% increase in the hazard for relapse or death in the DOR and 
PFS  analyses,  respectively.  This  finding  can  be  potentially  related  to  the  association  that  was  found 
between  PK  parameters  (Cmax  and  AUC0-28)  and  the  CD4+/CD8+  cell  components  ratio  (see  the 
Pharmacokinetics section). Efficacy and safety data were provided for the recommended dose range 44-
120 x 106 CAR+ T cells in subgroups stratified by CD4+:CD8+ cell components ratio (0.8-1.2 [n = 209] 
vs.  CD4+:CD8+  cell  components  ratio  >1.2  [n  =  19)].  No  meaningful  comparison  was  possible  with 
patients who received JCAR017 at a CD4+:CD8+ components ratio <0.8, as there was only 1 patient in 
this subgroup. ORR and CRR in the group with CD4+:CD8+ cell components ratio >1.2 were numerically 
higher compared to the group with CD4+:CD8+ cell components ratio between 0.8–1.2, 95%, yet CIs 
were overlapping. Some differences suggestive for less favourable DOR, PFS and OS could be observed 
for  the  group  that  received  a  CD4+:CD8+  cell  components  ratio  >1.2:  although  95%CIs  were 
overlapping, median DOR and median OS were shorter in this subgroup, and 95%CIs for probability of 
continued DOR and PFS at 24 months did not overlap; K-M plots for DOR, PFS and OS diverged over 
time and did not seem to evolve to the typical plateau phase that is observed for the group who received 
a CD4+:CD8+ cell components ratio between 0.8–1.2. These findings are consistent with the potential 
relationships between increasing CD4+:CD8+ cell components ratio and shorter DOR and PFS suggested 
by  retrospective  logistic  regression  modelling.  With  respect  to  safety,  the  available  data  stratified  by 
CD4+:CD8+  cell  components  ratio  do  not  indicate  any  relationship  with  the  majority  of  key  safety 
outcomes. Overall, although the sample size of the group who received a CD4+:CD8+ cell components 
ratio > 1.2 was reduced (especially at later timepoints), and the limits of the provided post-hoc analyses 
are recognised, the available data suggest that exerting a tighter control on the variability of the two 
JCAR017 product cell components ratio might be of relevance to preserve efficacy (see also the Quality 
AR). Therefore, a stringent 0.8-1.2 range for the CD4+/CD8+ cell components ratio has been included 
in the release specifications.  
JCAR017  was  only  investigated  in  single-arm  trials  (SATs).  In  principle,  randomised  trials  powered  to 
detect  superiority  in  terms  of  time-to-event  endpoints  are  required  to  assess  clinical  benefit  in  non-
Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs); however, when the clinical development of JCAR017 was planned, no proper 
active control could be identified in the target population. Moreover, aggressive lymphomas are rapidly 
progressive neoplasms, and evidence on the encouraging anti-CD19 CARTs activity in NHLs was already 
available  at  the  time,  so  it  can  be  recognised  that  placebo  or  cross-over  designs  could  have  been 
challenging from an ethical perspective.  
In line with the exploratory nature and single-arm design of studies 017001 and BCM-001, ORR by IRC, 
an  objective  measure  of  anti-tumour  activity,  was  selected  as  primary  endpoint.  Reduction  in  tumour 
mass provides, in fact, a less biased estimation of anti-tumour activity in single-arm trials, yet the clinical 
relevance of ORR in aggressive lymphomas is limited, since sub-optimal responses are, usually, short-
lasting.  CRR  by  IRC  was  therefore  collected  as  key  secondary  endpoint.  Response  to  treatment  was 
adjudicated based on the 2014 Lugano criteria, which is in accordance with standard clinical practice.  
DOR, PFS, EFS (in study BCM-001) and OS were included as secondary endpoints to further characterise 
the efficacy of JCAR017. Although the interpretation of time-to-event endpoints in the absence of direct 
controls is problematic, these analyses are still considered useful to further weigh clinical benefit.  
Sample  size  calculations  for  the  primary  analysis  in  study  017001  were  agreed  and  the  assumed 
thresholds  for  efficacy  (i.e.  ORR  40%,  CRR  20%)  was  considered  acceptable  in  the  context  of  the 
available treatment options at the time both studies were designed.  
Primary efficacy analyses in studies 017001 and BCM-001 were performed on subjects from the DLBCL 
cohort  (study  017001)  or  Cohort  1  (study  BCM-001)  who  had  PET-positive  disease  before  JCAR017 
administration,  received  JCAR017  and  had  at  least  one  post-infusion  response  assessment:  this  is

acceptable  to  control  possible  confounding  factors  unrelated  to  JCAR017  activity.  Results  from  the 
leukapheresed/enrolled set including all leukapheresed subjects irrespectively on whether they actually 
received JCAR017 are, in turn, more in line with the ITT principle and with real world clinical practice.  
The planned statistical methods used for time-to-event and binary endpoints analyses are standard and 
acceptable.  
Changes in health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) were also investigated using the validated EORTC QLQ-
C30,  EQ-5D-5L,  and  FACT-LymS  questionnaires.  The  overall  methodology  to  analyse  categorical  and 
time-to-event variables in the PRO analysis is, in principle, adequate; however, the lack of any strategy 
to control for multiplicity and the uncontrolled/unblinded nature of the data limit PROs reliability and do 
not allow for HR-QoL-based claims. 
Preliminary analyses from study BCM-001 showed numerically relevant differences in efficacy outcomes 
compared to larger study 017001. An exploratory “post-hoc” bridging analysis was, therefore, provided, 
using  ORR  and  CRR  at  months  1  and  3  as  primary  endpoints  and  DoR,  PFS  and  OS  as  secondary 
endpoints. The proposed statistical approach is reasonable, although the limits introduced by reduced 
sample size and shorter follow-up in the BCM-001 trial cannot be overcome. A choice of patient, disease 
and treatment-related variables were included in the model as potential confounders: the role of age, 
ECOG score, high LDH, number of prior lines of therapy and response to last therapy as prognostic factors 
in  large  B-cell  lymphomas  has  been  extensively  described  in  literature  and  is  not  controversial.  The 
rationale to include the need for bridging therapy before JCAR017 infusion as independent variable is 
also  understood,  based  on  the  available  evidence  suggesting  that  disease  progression  during 
manufacturing time has a significant impact on clinical outcomes with CARTs. The inclusion of C-Reactive 
Protein  (CRP)  and  sum  of  products  of  perpendicular  diameters  (SPD)  in  the  model  was,  however,  not 
supported:  neither  is  currently  included  in  validated  prognostic  tools  for  DLBCL  and  their  possible 
predictive  role  is  only  supported  by  post-hoc  analyses  in  study  017001,  since  no  similar  effect  was 
observed in Phase II study BCM-001 nor in other CAR-T trials. In response to CAT/CHMP requests, the 
applicant has included updated sensitivity analyses from two additional models which included IPI score 
components (together or separated) and excluded CRP and SPD.  
Even  though  some  variability  in  patient  and  disease  characteristics  could  be  observed  across  patient 
groups defined by protocol versions for study 017011, the study population remained consistent with 
the target indication and the overall impact of protocol changes on the observed outcomes appears to 
be limited. 
With respect to study BCM-001, 3 major protocol amendments had been issued at the time of the data 
cut-off date. Under protocol amendment 2, subjects with vascular tumour invasion, DVT or PE within 3 
months  or  with  DVT/PE  requiring  therapeutic  levels  of  anticoagulation  were  excluded  from  study 
participation out of safety concerns. These strict limitations were, however, mitigated under Amendment 
3.  
Historical studies  
External historical data were used to set-up a benchmark for the main efficacy endpoints observed in 
JCAR017 studies. The use of external controls (including historical controls) is discussed in ICH Topic E10 
(CHMP ICH/364/96) and it is concluded that “the inability to control bias restricts use of the external 
control design to situations where the treatment effect is dramatic and the usual course of the disease 
highly predictable”. When the significant clinical and biological heterogeneity of aggressive large B-cell 
lymphomas  is  considered,  results  from  these  indirect  comparisons  can  only  be  accepted  to 
“contextualise” the results observed with JCAR017, yet their contribution to inform B/R evaluations is 
necessarily limited.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
At the time of the 19 Jun 2020 data cut-off date, 427 and 69 patients were screened in studies 017001 
and BCM-001, respectively. A similar fraction of subjects (~14%) was excluded from trial participation 
due  to  screening  failure  in  the  two  studies  yet,  compared  to  study  BCM-001,  more  subjects  in  study 
017001 (~20%) failed screening procedures due to issues in their ability to comply with study protocol. 
This difference did not result, however, in an enrichment in physically fitter subjects in the US study, as 
demonstrated by the similar rates of subjects excluded because of ECOG PS score ≥2 at screening in 
both studies (15.2% vs. 18.2% in study 017001 and BCM-001, respectively); the baseline characteristics 
of leukapheresed subjects in studies 017001 and BCM-001 were also generally consistent. Although the 
possibility of selection bias cannot be completely ruled out, its impact on study outcomes seems limited. 
Approximately 22-25% of subjects who underwent leukapheresis in studies 017001 and BCM-001 did 
not  receive  JCAR017.  The  high  dropout  rate  before  infusion  of  JCAR017  conforming  product  could  be 
explained by 2 major causes: 
-  the  first  one  is  disease-related,  since  9.6%  of  patients  died  while  waiting  for  JCAR017  (n=33;  27 
subjects  died  because  of  PD,  3  from  unknown  reasons,  1  from  bowel  perforation,  1  from  cardiogenic 
shock and 1 from AE) despite the possibility to receive bridging therapy, and 1.7% (n=6) dropped out 
because of disease-related complications. Analyses in patients infused across JCAR017 studies showed, 
however, no clear relationship between the time from leukapheresis to JCAR017 infusion and risk of early 
death. In this regard, the median time from leukapheresis to JCAR017 availability in the US study was 
24 days (range 17-51 days), which is in line with the available turnaround time data for the approved 
CARTs. The manufacturing process for EU patients is characterised, however, by additional steps (e.g. 
shipment to the US manufacturing site and back) and data from Cohort 1 of EU study BCM-001 showed 
a  slightly  longer  median  time  from  leukapheresis  to  JCAR017  availability  (i.e.  28  days,  range  24-38 
days).  Based  on  the  available  data,  however,  the impact  of  this  finding on the  rate  of  leukapheresed 
subjects  who  actually  received  JCAR017  seems  limited,  although  the  fraction of  patients  who  needed 
bridging therapy in study BCM-001 was higher than that in study 017001 (75% vs. 58.9%, respectively). 
- the second major cause is that JCAR017 manufacturing failed in 11.4% and 8.9% of leukapheresed 
patients  in  studies  017001  and  BCM-001,  respectively.  Sixteen  and  6  patients  eventually  received 
nonconforming products in studies 017001 and BCM-001, respectively. The limited number of patients 
in subgroups did not allow to draw meaningful conclusions as regards baseline patient/disease/immune 
cells  characteristics  that  could  have  contributed  to  the  failure  of  one  or  both  cell  components.  A 
recommendation is provided by the CAT/CHMP to further investigate this issue post-approval with data 
to be captured in the periodic safety update reports (PSURs). 
Overall, 58.6% of patients in study 017001 received bridging anticancer therapy after leukapheresis and 
prior  to  infusion.  The  possibility  that  bridging  therapy  might  induce  changes  in  the  tumour 
microenvironment  that  might  have  an  impact  on  CAR  T-cell  activity,  however,  cannot  be  excluded  at 
present.  In  this  regard,  subjects  who  needed  bridging  therapy  for  disease  control  in  study  017001 
(n=150) fared worse than patients who did not require additional treatments before JCAR017 infusion, 
with lower ORR and CRR (66.7% 44%, respectively) and shorter DoR, PFS and OS (9.1, 4.6 and 13.3 
months,  respectively).  Nonetheless,  durable  remissions  could  still  be  observed,  and  the  B/R  in  this 
subpopulation is not considered different from that established in the overall population. 
Demographic characteristics were similar across JCAR017 studies and, overall, in line with the known 
epidemiology of DLBCL.  
A similar fraction of patients (~18%) in studies 017001 and BCM-001 had moderately impaired renal 
function at baseline, and approximately 5% of patients had LVEF ≥40% to <50% in the US study. The 
inclusion of subjects with clinically relevant comorbidities could increase, in principle, the generalisability 
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022  
Page 150/252 
 
 
 
of the results, yet the available data are not sufficient to fully characterise the B/R of JCAR017 in frailer 
subjects  with  renal  or  cardiac  comorbidities.  It  is  recognised,  however,  that  some  of  these  patients 
experienced durable benefit. Analyses in subgroups of patients with impaired cardiac (e.g. left ventricular 
ejection fraction <50%, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction) or 
renal  function  (i.e.  serum  creatinine  >  2  mg/dL  or  > 177 µmol/L,  on  dialysis,  or  prior  renal 
transplantation) are pre-specified in PASS study BCM-005: this is acceptable. 
In  line  with  the  broad  indication  pursued,  a  heterogeneous  patient  population  was  enrolled  in  study 
017001,  with  DLBCL  NOS  representing  approximately  50%  of  all  patients,  followed  by  DLBCL  arising 
from indolent lymphomas (tIL, ~30%) and HGL (~13%). In the tIL subgroup most clinical information 
came from patients with transformed follicular lymphoma (tFL, ~75% of all tIL patients) and marginal 
zone lymphoma (tMZL, ~15% of all tIL patients). Only 5 patients had Richter syndrome (RS). DLBCL 
NOS was the most common histology also in study BCM-001 (81.5%), followed by HGL (14.8%).  
Overall,  the  studied  population  can  be  considered  representative  of  the  targeted  advanced  setting  of 
relapse. In this regard, in light of the increased need for bridging therapy observed in study BCM-001 
compared to study 017001 (75% vs. 58.9%, respectively), it cannot be excluded that subjects in the EU 
trial might be representative of a population at higher risk for rapid progression.   
Baseline  characteristics  in  the  ITT  (i.e.  leukapheresed)  sets  in  JCAR017  studies  were  not  significantly 
dissimilar compared to those in the treated sets. 
Consistently with what observed with other CARTs, complete responders had a significantly longer DOR, 
PFS and OS compared to subjects with a BOR of PR (median DOR NR vs. 1.9 months, median PFS NR 
vs. 2.8 months, median OS NR  vs. 9.0 months, respectively). KM curves  for  time-to-event endpoints 
showed a plateau phase starting approximately from month 12-18 onwards, suggesting the possibility 
for long-term disease control in a subset of patients. Median DOR (9.1 months) in the DL2S v4 subset 
was shorter, despite similar median PFS (5.9 months) and OS (17.1 months). Updated analyses (19 Jun 
2020)  showed  that  mDoR  (11.1  vs.  19  months),  mPFS  (6  vs.  6.8  months)  and  mOS  (27.3  vs.  21.4 
months)  were  still  shorter  in  the  DL2Sv4  set  compared  to  the  overall  DL2S  population,  yet  such 
differences  resulted  from  minimal  variations  in  the  plateau  portion  of  otherwise  superimposable  KM 
curves. 
Shorter median DOR and PFS were also observed in the analyses by Investigator (i.e. 9.2 months and 
3.9 months, respectively). However, the main reason for such discrepancies was that, in the case of PD 
adjudication by the Investigator or start of a subsequent anticancer therapy, no subsequent radiographic 
evaluation was required by study protocol and, if performed, submission to the IRC was not mandatory. 
This  was  particularly  relevant  when  the  EMA  censoring  rules  were  applied,  since  the  start  of  a  new 
subsequent anti-lymphoma therapy before PD or death was no reason for censoring.    
In study 017001, ITT analyses showed shorter survival (with overlapping CIs) compared to the primary 
analysis in the DLBCL Efficacy Set, for both OS (14.0 vs. 21.1 months) and PFS (4.8 vs. 6.0 months), 
although the median follow-up time for these endpoints in the ITT analyses was similar to the primary 
analysis.    Sensitivity  analyses  for  PFS  and  OS  in  the  DLBCL  Efficacy  Set  with  PFS  and  OS  defined  as 
starting  from  the  date  of  leukapheresis  were  provided  and,  although  differences  were  still  observed, 
confidence intervals were overlapping. 
Overall, results from study 017001 indicate that a subset of subjects who received JCAR017 is expected 
to receive significant clinical benefit, especially in terms of sustained disease control.  
Cohort  1  of  Phase  II  study  BCM-001  was  designed  to  further  explore  the  efficacy  and  safety  of 
JCAR017  in  EU  patients  and  to  confirm  the  feasibility  of  the  “EU  manufacturing  process”.  Preliminary 
efficacy  results  from  study  BCM-001  (data  cut-off  date  13  Sep  2019)  were,  however,  less  convincing 
than those observed in the US study: the ORR by IRC (48.1%, 95%CI 28.7 - 68.1) and the CRR by 
Assessment report

Page 151/252 
 
 
 
IRC (25.9%, 95%CI 11.1 - 46.3) were lower than those reported in study 017001 and did not allow to 
reject the study null hypothesis. With a shorter median follow-up (3.38 months in the overall population) 
), time-to-event outcomes were considered too immature to make meaningful comparisons relative to 
study 017001 median DOR in the EU cohort of study BCM-001 was 2.53 months (95%CI 1.08, 9.23), 
median PFS 2.99 months (95%CI 2.00, 5.22) and median EFS 2.00 months (95%CI 1.38, 2.99). 
Median OS was 8.34 months (95%CI 3.38, NR), with a 12-month OS rate of approximately 30%. 
Updated results from the planned primary analysis of study BCM-001 were provided with a data cut-
off date 19 Jun 2020. Compared to the initial submission, data from 9 additional subjects in study BCM-
001 Cohort 1 were available, and the median on-study follow-up was 8.13 months. 
Subjects in the final dataset from study BCM-001 Cohort 1 were slightly older than the population in the 
preliminary analysis (median age 59 vs. 61.5 years, subjects aged 65 to 75 years 29.6% vs. 38.9% in 
the  initial  MAA  and  in  updated  dataset,  respectively),  markers  of  higher  disease  burden/aggressive 
clinical behaviour were less represented (SPD <50 cm2 63% vs. 69.4%; high-intermediate/high risk IPI 
59.2% vs. 50%; Ann Arbor stage III/IV 77.8% vs. 63.9%, LDH ≥500 U/L 29.6% vs. 22.2%, respectively) 
and the fraction of subjects with ≤2 previous lines of therapy was increased (i.e. 40.7% vs. 52.8%). The 
updated  patient  population  included  in  the  primary  analysis  of  study  BCM-001  was,  therefore,  less 
representative of a higher risk population compared to patients in the preliminary analysis and more in 
line  with  subjects  treated in  study  017001,  although  an  increased need  for  bridging  therapy  was  still 
observed (75% vs. 58.9% in studies BCM-001 and 017-001, respectively).  
Consistently with this shift towards lower risk clinical features, efficacy outcomes in study BCM-001 were 
improved compared to the previous data cut-off and less divergent from those observed in study 017001: 
the updated ORR in the BCM-001 Cohort 1 JCAR017-treated set was 61.1% (95%CI 43.5, 76.9; ITT 
set 55.6%) and CRR was 33.3% (95%CI 18.6, 51; ITT set 31.1%). Measures of response duration were 
also improved, although still shorter than those observed in the larger US study: mDoR in the BCM-001 
Cohort 1 JCAR017-treated set was 3.50 months (95%CI 2.20, NR; ITT set 3.35 months) and mPFS 
3.25  months  (95%CI  2.89,  5.36;  ITT  set  4.53  months).  OS  data  were  less  divergent  from  those  in 
study 017001, with a mOS in the BCM-001 Cohort 1 JCAR017-treated set of 18.6 months (95%CI 5.82, 
NR; ITT set 12.1 months). 
The  updated  Bridging  Analysis  for  studies  BCM-001  and  017001  (data  cut-off  19  Jun  2020) 
confirmed that differences in baseline characteristics across studies were reduced compared to earlier 
analyses and the distribution of factors with a possible impact on JACR017 efficacy (e.g. SPD, LDH and 
CRP) more balanced. The applicant explored, however, possible imbalances in additional variables with 
a potential prognostic effect (e.g. the 5 IPI score components) confirming that EU patients were more 
likely to have extensive extranodal involvement, bulky disease, elevated LDH and IPI scores >2. Overall, 
response  rates  at  month  3  in  the  bridging  analysis  were  similar  across  studies  and,  in  general,  the 
updated  bridging  analysis showed that  patient  populations  in  studies  017001 and  BCM-001  were  less 
divergent,  resulting  in  more  similar  response  rates  and  median  OS  across  studies.  Further  updated 
efficacy data from study BCM-001 (data cut-off date 04 Jan 2021), with a median survival follow-up of 
16.4 months, were consistent with those observed in the primary analysis. Data from the EBMT registry 
(PASS BCM-005) will be used to provide further information for patients treated in the EU who will receive 
the commercial product (expected number of EU patients N=200). 
Regarding the contextualisation of results from uncontrolled pivotal study 017001 with respect to current 
clinical practice, efficacy data in study 017001 compared favourably with the outcomes reported with 
CARTs and conventional treatments in the provided SLR, and also with the results from a recent meta-
analysis investigating the efficacy of second-generation CAR T-cell therapy in DLBCL (see Al-Mansour M 
et al, Mol Clin Oncol 2020).  
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022  
Page 152/252 
 
 
 
With the intrinsic limits of such indirect comparisons, the provided MAIC analysis comparing the results 
with JCAR017 in study 017001 with efficacy data from the registrational studies of the CARTs currently 
approved for the treatment of 3rd line DLBCL was also reassuring, showing at least comparable efficacy 
between JCAR017 and tisagenlecleucel/axicabtagene ciloleucel.  
Adjusted  analyses  from  historical  study  NDS-NHL-001  consistently  showed  significantly  higher  ORR, 
CRR,  PFS  and  OS  in  the  reference  dataset  from  study  017001  compared  to  the  historical  cohort.  To 
further support the external validity and generalisability of the results obtained in the JCAR017 clinical 
development programme in the EU treatment landscape for 3rd line large B cell lymphomas, the applicant 
has submitted additional RWE analyses: 
-  demographic/disease  characteristics  and  efficacy  outcomes  were  compared  between  EU  and  US 
subjects in study NDS-NHL-001, showing that significant differences in characteristics and outcomes of 
3rd line DLBCL patients treated in EU and US are unlikely.  
- the applicant has also conducted additional updated comparisons between subjects in the RWE study 
cohorts (i.e. RW EU cohort [n=94], the JTAC [n=257] and the BCM-001 cohort [n=36]), showing that 
RW patients from the EU were generally younger and more likely to have refractory/primary refractory 
disease, a shorter time from diagnosis, higher baseline LDH levels and ECOG PS scores.  
This  is  not  unexpected  since,  despite  the  efforts  to  super-impose  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  from 
JCAR017  trials  to  the  historical  data,  patient  selection  for  CAR  T-cell  treatments  is  known  to  involve 
clinical decisions not completely standardised and hardly captured by fixed criteria. The DLBCL CART-
eligible population should be considered, therefore, as a distinct subgroup of patients defined by clinical 
features (e.g. overall “fitness”, absence of rapidly progressing disease and/or elevated disease bulk etc.) 
that, in the opinion of the treating physician/investigator, can shift the B/R of this treatment option to 
more favourable positions (see e.g. Cahill KE et al, Leuk Lymphoma 2020 and Yassine F et al, Current 
Research  in  Translational  Medicine  2020).  To  confirm  that  subjects  who  received  JCAR017  in  pivotal 
study  017001  were  indeed  representative  of  the  “RW  CART-eligible  population”,  the  applicant  has 
provided additional indirect comparisons vs. RW DLBCL patients in study NDS-NHL-001 (n=34) and 
vs.  patients  who  received  CARTs  in  5  French  Lymphoma  Study  Association  Centres  (n=116,  see 
Vercellino L. et al, Blood Adv 2020) and in the UK national programme (n=183, see Kuhnl A. et al, EHA 
Annual  Congress  2020,  Abstract  S243).  The  results  showed  that  no  significant  divergencies  in 
patient/disease characteristics and clinical outcomes could be observed across CARTs cohorts, although 
limited numbers and disease heterogeneity should be taken into account.  
A broad indication is claimed for JCAR017, encompassing all DLBCL subtypes (including, e.g., HGL, which 
is now classified as a distinct entity, and DLBCL arising from transformed indolent lymphomas), PMBCL 
and  FL3B.  Overall,  JCAR017  was  able  to  induce  disease  remission  in  ~40-60%  of  subjects  across  all 
disease  subtypes,  and  durable  responses  were  observed  in  all  histology  subgroups.  In  this  regard, 
particularly favourable results were observed in patients with PMBCL (n=15, ORR 78.6% and CRR 50%), 
with KM-plots showing a high rate of durable responses.  
FL3B is a rare form of aggressive B-cell lymphoma and an unmet medical need for patients who have 
received at least 2 prior lines of therapy can be recognised. Clinical and biological data from published 
literature  support  the  dignity  of  FL3B  as  a  distinct  condition,  yet  heterogeneity  in  clinical  behaviour, 
phenotype and genetic background can be expected (see e.g. Barraclough A et al, Br J Haematol. 2021, 
Swerdlow  SH  et  al,  2008  WHO  classification  of  Tumours  of  Haematopoietic  and  Lymphoid  Tissues, 
Katzenberger OG et al, Blood 2002; Koch K et al, Ann Oncol 2016; Kikkeri NN et al, Haematologica 2007) 
and it cannot be excluded that the variability observed in how the WHO diagnostic criteria for FL3B were 
applied in studies 017001 and BCM-001 might eventually reflect real-world clinical practice. The number 
of patients (n = 4 from study 017001; n = 2 from study BCM-001) is, per se, too limited for self-standing 
B/R evaluations, even though promising responses have been observed. It is noted, however, that the 
Assessment report

distinction between FL3B and DLBCL is mainly based on histology but that there is a large overlap in 
gene expression profile, clinical presentation and behaviour/biology. Importantly, the same treatment 
options are available for FL3B and DLBCL and response to treatment appears to be similar. The long-
lasting  remissions  observed  with  JCAR017  in  patients  with  R/R  FL3B,  despite  failure  of  multiple  prior 
lines of chemotherapy, are suggestive of an efficacy that is at least similar to that observed in DLBCL 
NOS. Based on these similarities, the results observed with JCAR017 in the overall study population are 
considered to provide support for the efficacy seen in the very few FL3B patients and the inclusion of 
FL3B in section 4.1 can be, therefore, accepted. Limited additional data in FL3B can be expected from 
ongoing  clinical  trials  and  in  the  post-marketing  setting,  as  expected  considering  the  rarity  of  this 
condition. Information will nonetheless be collected post-approval from the CIBMTR and EBMT registries 
(PASS BCM-005) to further characterise patients with FL3B. 
Although the number of patients was limited, apparently reduced efficacy was observed in DLBCL arising 
from  indolent  NHLs  other  than  tFL  (i.e.  the  tIL  subset),  which  is  a  heterogenous  group  of  aggressive 
lymphomas arising from different indolent conditions, including CLL/SLL (i.e. Richter’s syndrome, RS). 
The majority of the responses in this subgroup were observed in subjects with tMZL (n=10, month-3 
ORR and CRR 5/10 and 4/10, respectively), with some responses being durable. Conversely, patients 
with RS (n=5)  who received JCAR017 in study 017001 fared significantly worse, with 3/5 showing at 
least a PR (1/5 with CR) yet no durable response beyond the 3-month timepoint. Only 2 patients with 
tWM  received  JCAR017  in  study  017001,  the  ORR  was  50%  (1/2  subjects)  with  a  maximal  response 
duration  of  5.3  months  and  no  subjects  achieving  a  CR.  Based  on  the  available  data,  it  is  uncertain 
whether  the  anti-tumour  activity  of  JCAR017  in  RS/tWM,  as  observed  in  terms  of  ORR/CRR,  can  be 
translated  in  prolonged  remission,  which  is  the  ultimate  measure  of  clinical  benefit  in  such  advanced 
stages of disease. This uncertainty is reflected in the SmPC, specifying that although durable remissions 
(i.e. DoR ≥12 months) were reported for subjects with tFL and tMZL, the experience in patients with 
tCLL/SLL  and  tWM  is  very  limited  and  shorter  remissions  (maximal  DoRs  of  2  and  5.3  months, 
respectively) were observed.  
A consistent treatment effect in terms of response rates and time-to event endpoints was observed in 
all  the  other  pre-specified  subgroups,  yet  results  have  to  be  interpreted  with  caution  because  of  the 
reduced sample size in most subsets. The impact of high ECOG score at baseline was explored in study 
017001: overall, responses in subjects with baseline ECOG score of 2 (n=9) were short-lasting and no 
subject was still alive at the time of the data cutoff date. Further, under Amendment 5 subjects with 
baseline ECOG score >1  were excluded from JCAR017 trials out of safety concerns: clinical benefit in 
patients  with  higher  baseline  ECOG  PS  scores  is  not  considered  characterised,  as  currently  stated  in 
section 5.1 of the SmPC. The efficacy of JCAR017 in higher risk patients (e.g. because of high IPI score, 
extranodal involvement and/or ECOG PS score ≥2) will be further characterised in PASS BCM-005.  
Only 8 subjects in JCAR017 studies had secondary CNS disease at first infusion; 5/8 were able to achieve 
CR and two subjects were still in remission with a DoR of approximately 23 months: such results in this 
high unmet need population are encouraging, yet currently too limited for specific B/R evaluations. A 
statement in section 4.4 of the SmPC has been included to specify that clinical experience in subjects 
with secondary CNS involvement is currently limited, and all the available clinical data in subjects with 
secondary CNS lymphoma who received JCAR017 in clinical studies were reflected in section 5.1 of the 
SmPC. Further efficacy/safety data in subjects with secondary CNS lymphoma will be collected in registry 
study BCM-005 (PASS).  
JCAR017 could be manufactured also in presence of low absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs) at the time 
of leukapheresis. Patients with low ALC (i.e. <0.3 x 109/L) had lower chances to achieve CR (37% vs. 
54%, respectively) and long-term disease control (median DOR was 5.3 vs. 20.2 months, respectively) 
compared to subjects with ALC ≥0.3 x 109/L. Whether this reduced treatment effect should be ascribed 
to the product or to underlying biological/clinical differences is uncertain. A secondary objective to the 
Assessment report

post-authorisation registry study BCM-005 has been included to assess effectiveness in the subgroup of 
patients  with  pre-leukapheresis  ALC  <0.3  ×  109/L.  Study  JCAR017-BCM-005  will  also  allow  for  the 
evaluation of the relationship between the administered CD4+:CD8+ cell components ratio and the pre-
leukapheresis ALC, using data from the CIBMTR registry. Since the CD4+:CD8+ cell components ratio 
will be controlled at the manufacturing level (range 0.8 – 1.2) and is expected to be independent from 
the pre-leukapheresis ALC count, limited variability is however anticipated. 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall,  the  ORR/CRR  rates  reported  from  registrational  studies  017001  and  BCM-001  in  a  relatively 
important  number  of  patients  in  advanced  settings  of  relapse  are  reasonably  supporting  that  clinical 
benefit  would  be  expected  with  a  meaningful  disease  control  in  a  substantial  proportion  of  patients. 
Uncertainties remain, however, on longer-term efficacy.  
The available results are considered generalizable to the population to be treated. Full approval in the 
broad target indication is supported by the totality of data.  
The CAT considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
Given the limitations associated with efficacy at long term and in certain sub-populations, the CAT/CHMP 
considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
• 
• 
In order to further characterise the long-term efficacy and safety of Breyanzi in patients treated 
for relapsed or refractory DLBCL, PMBCL, FL3B after at least 2 prior therapies, the MAH should 
submit 24 months post Breyanzi infusion follow-up data (in the enrolled and treated population) 
of the study 017001. 
In order to further characterise the long-term efficacy and safety of Breyanzi in patients treated 
with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, PMBCL, FL3B after at least 2 prior therapies, the MAH should 
submit 24 months post Breyanzi infusion follow-up data (in the enrolled and treated population) 
of the study JCAR017-BCM-001 Cohort 1. 
Data  in  more  rare  subgroups  will  become  available  from  the  ongoing  JCAR017-BCM-003  study. 
Furthermore, remaining efficacy uncertainties will be further investigated in the post-approval setting in 
LTFU  study  GC-LTFU-001  (category  3  PASS  study)  and  in  registr-  imposed  PASS  BCM-005,  with  the 
prespecified analyses as per an agreed protocol for efficacy which includes OS, DOR, PFS, ORR, CRR and 
TTNT. Effectiveness analyses will be provided as part of the interim reports to be prepared at Years 5, 
10, and 15, as well as part of the final study report, currently targeted for Q4 2042. 
Although reasons for pre-infusion treatment failure will not be collected as part of the imposed PASS, 
since  registries  only  collect  data  on  patients  who  receive  JCAR017,  data  collected  in  the  applicant’s 
manufacturing  database  will  be  provided  post-approval  to  further  investigate  the  reasons  for  early 
treatment failures. The applicant committed to provide all available information on the rate and reasons 
for Breyanzi manufacturing failures that occur in the post-approval setting in the periodic safety update 
reports (PSURs). 
In addition, the CAT recommended the following point for consideration:  
• 
In order to further characterise the efficacy and safety of Breyanzi in patients with relapsed or 
refractory DLBCL, PMBCL, FL3B after at least 2 prior therapies, the MAH should submit the results 
of the study JCAR017-BCM-003. 
The CHMP endorses the CAT conclusion on clinical efficacy as described above.

2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
The safety evaluation is primarily based on pooled safety results from 349 subjects treated with JCAR017, 
across all dose regimens, from 4 ongoing studies as per the table below  
Table 48. Overview of Studies Included in the Summary of Clinical Safety in the Pooled 3L+ 
DLBCL Set – JCAR017-treated Set 
JCAR017 safety profile for the treatment of adult patients with R/R large B-cell lymphoma after at least 
2 prior therapies was also provided with data cutoff date 19 Jun 2020 for Studies 017001 and BCM-001, 
with 10 new subjects added (9 from BCM-001 Cohort 1 and 1 from the 017001 DLBCL cohort) to the 
Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Treated Set (D120 Safety Update section). 
All subjects who completed study treatment and the 2-year on-study follow-up or who discontinued the 
study for any reason were encouraged to enrol in the long-term follow-up Study GC-LTFU-001 to evaluate 
long-term safety and survival for up to 15 years post-infusion.

Some clinically relevant comorbidities were permitted by the eligibility criteria in Study 017001; 19.0% 
had a calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) between 25 and 60 mL/min and 4.8% had screening left 
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50% but ≥ 40%. In addition, 17.8% of subjects had laboratory-
based Grade ≥ 3 cytopenia prior to receiving LDC.  
Anticancer treatment (Table 52). In the total 017001 DLBCL Treated Set, systemic therapy only was

Summary of adverse events 
For Studies 017001 and BCM-001, AEs were mapped into the following time periods: 
•  Screening to the day before leukapheresis (Study 017001 only) 
• 
Leukapheresis to the day before LDC 
•  Start of LDC to the day before the first JCAR017 infusion 
• 
• 
TEAE reporting period: from the first JCAR017 infusion through the TEAE reporting period 
Post-treatment-emergent period 
Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) 
A TEAE was defined as an AE that started any time from initiation of JCAR017 administration through 
and including 90 days following the final cycle (i.e., final infusion) of JCAR017. Any AE occurring after 
the initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy, JCAR017 retreatment, or start of combination therapy 
(Study BCM-002) was not considered a TEAE.

Treatment-emergent Adverse Events by SOC and PT 
Among  the  individual  subtypes  in  the  DLBCL  histology  subgroup,  frequently  reported  TEAEs  were 
generally  similar  across  these  subtypes.  However,  some  differences  (i.e.,  ≥  20%  difference)  were 
observed for the tiNHL subtype compared to the other subtypes: at the level of the SOC, Gastrointestinal 
Disorders were reported less frequently in the tiNHL subtype (61.1%) compared with the tFL subtype 
(81.7%). Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders were reported more frequently in the tiNHL 
subtype (61.1%) than in the HGL subtype (33.3%), and Cardiac Disorders were reported more frequently 
in the tiNHL subtype (50.0%) than in the tFL subtype (25.0%). Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders 
were  also  reported  more  frequently  in  subjects  with  tiNHL  (50.0%)  compared  to  the  other  subtypes 
(19.4% to 30.7%). 
No clear differences were noted in the frequencies or types of TEAEs reported in the subset of subjects 
treated with DL2S v4 compared with those of the total 017001 DLBCL Treated Set. Nevertheless, TEAEs 
were  reported  most  frequently  in  the  SOC  of  General  Disorders  and  Administration  Site  Conditions 
(78.6%) rather than Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders (75.4%) in subjects treated with DL2S v4. 
In Study BMC-001, in Cohort 1, TEAEs were generally similar to those reported in the 017001 DLBCL 
Treated Set and the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set.  
In  Study  017007  and  in  Study  BCM-002,  the  results  for  TEAEs  were  generally  similar  to  those  in the 
Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set.

In Studies 017007 and BCM-002, the results for Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs were generally similar to those in the 
Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set, most frequently in the Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders SOC (70.6% and 
61.5%, respectively).

Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs in the DLBCL histology subgroup were very similar to those of the total 017001 DLBCL 
Treated Set. (Table 65). 
In  subjects  with  PMBCL,  Grade  ≥  3  TEAEs  were  reported  in  66.7%  (10/15)  of  subjects.  The  most 
frequently reported Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs were neutropenia (6 subjects, 40.0%) and anaemia (5 subjects, 
33.3%); all other PTs were reported in 1 subject (6.7%) each. 
All 3 subjects with FL3B (100%) had Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs reported; the PTs were neutropenia, leukopenia 
(2 subjects each, 66.7%), and anaemia.

Post-treatment-emergent Adverse Events 
The  post-treatment-emergent  period  started  from  91  days  after  the  final  cycle  of  JCAR017,  or  from 
initiation of another anticancer therapy or JCAR017 retreatment if subjects initiated another anticancer 
therapy or JCAR017 retreatment prior to 91 days after the final cycle of JCAR017, or in Study BCM-002, 
from the start of combination therapy. Thus, analyses of AEs occurring in the post-treatment-emergent 
period included AEs reported following JCAR017 retreatment, as well as those following post-JCAR017 
anticancer therapy.  (Table 66). Post-treatment-emergent AEs reported in > 5% subjects were anaemia 
(11.3%), neutropenia (10.9%), thrombocytopenia (9.3%), fatigue (8.3%), and nausea (6.6%).

Grade ≥ 3 AEs are reported in Table 67. Grade ≥ 3 AEs reported in > 2% of subjects were anaemia, 
neutropenia  (8.9%  each),  thrombocytopenia  (5.6%),  febrile  neutropenia  (4.0%),  and  leukopenia 
(2.6%). 
In the 017001 DLBCL Treated Set, and in the subset of subjects in the 017001 DLBCL Treated Set who 
were  treated  with  DL2S  v4,  AEs  reported  during  the  post-treatment-emergent  period  were  similar  to 
those reported in the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set during this time period. 
In Study BCM-001 Cohort 1, AEs reported in the post treatment emergent period were generally similar 
to those in the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set. 
In Study BCM-002, the percentages of subjects with AEs reported in the post-treatment-emergent period 
(21 of 22 subjects, 95.5%) were generally higher compared with the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set (45.4%). 
Adverse  events  were  most  frequently  reported  in  the  SOC  of  Blood  and  Lymphatic  System  Disorders 
(68.2%), and the most frequent AEs were anaemia (45.5%), neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue 
(36.4% each), leukopenia, and nausea (27.3% each). Similarly, the percentages of subjects with Grade 
≥ 3 AEs in the post-treatment-emergent period (16 out of 22 subjects, 72.7%) were generally higher 
compared with the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set (25.2%). Grade ≥ 3 AEs were most frequently reported in the 
SOC of Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders (59.1%).

2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
Deaths after JCAR017 treatment were primarily due to disease progression.  
In the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set, 119 out of 143 deaths reported after the first JCAR017 treatment were 
due to disease progression, 16 were due to AEs, 5 were due to unknown causes, and 3 were due to other 
causes (stroke unrelated to study, pneumonia, and diffuse intra-abdominal ischemia, all of which were 
subjects  in  the  017001  DLBCL  Treated  Set)  (Table  68).  Of  the  143  deaths  after  the  first  JCAR017 
treatment, 101 deaths occurred more than 90 days after the last JCAR017 treatment. Eleven of the 143 
deaths  occurred  within  30  days  after  the  first  JCAR017  treatment,  with  6  deaths  due  to  disease 
progression and 5 deaths due to AEs (diffuse alveolar damage, septic shock, cardiomyopathy, respiratory 
failure, and staphylococcal sepsis). Thirty-one of the 143 deaths occurred between 30 and 90 days after 
the last JCAR017 infusion, of which 21 were due to disease progression, 8 were due to AEs, and 2 were 
due to unknown causes. 
The  percentages  of  subjects  who  died  and  the  primary  causes  of  death  were  generally  similar  in  the 
017001 DLBCL Treated Set (39%), in the subset of subjects in the 017001 DLBCL Treated Set who were 
treated with DL2S v4 (39.7%), and in Cohorts 1 of BCM-001 (33%).

Table 68. Summary of Deaths After the First JCAR017 Infusion – Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set 
Deaths Due to AEs (Grade 5 AEs) 
Sixteen of  349  subjects  (4.6%)  in  the  Pooled  3L+  DLBCL  Set  died  due  to  Grade  5  AEs  after  the  first 
JCAR017 treatment. Grade 5 TEAEs were reported in 11 out of 349 subjects (3.2%). 
Grade 5 TEAEs (Table 69).  
In the 017001 DLBCL Treated Set, Grade 5 TEAEs (n=7 of 269, 2.6%) were PML ( related to multiple 
prior courses of rituximab), septic shock (related to LDC, ongoing CRS event at time of death), diffuse 
alveolar damage (related to JCAR017 and LDC), pulmonary haemorrhage (ongoing CRS event at time of 
death,  related  to  JCAR017  and  LDC),  cardiomyopathy  (related  to  JCAR017  and  LDC),  multiple  organ 
dysfunction syndrome (related to JCAR017 and LDC), and leukoencephalopathy (related to LDC – prior 
fludarabine exposure).  
In Study BCM-001, Grade 5 TEAEs (n=2 of 37, 5.4%) were candida sepsis (related to LDC and JCAR017) 
and respiratory failure (related to JCAR017 and unrelated to LDC, ongoing CRS event at time of death).  
In  Study  BCM-002,  2  out  of  26  subjects  (7.7%)  had  Grade  5  TEAEs.  One  subject  died  due  to 
staphylococcal sepsis on Study Day 25, which was considered not related to JCAR017 but related to LDC 
(ongoing CRS event at time of death). One subject died due to pneumonia on Study Day 45, which was 
considered not related to both JCAR017 and LDC.

Grade 5 AEs Occurring in the Post-treatment-emergent Period 
Grade 5 AEs were reported for 5 out of 349 subjects (1.4%) during the post-treatment-emergent period. 
Three  subjects  in  Study  017001  had  Grade  5  AEs  during  the  post-treatment-emergent  period:  one 
subject with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (occurred > 670 days after last dose of JCAR017), one 
with PML (the event began as a Grade 3 event on Day 710 and the subject died from the event after 
completing the study with no intervening anticancer therapy), and one with septic shock (occurred after 
starting subsequent anticancer therapy). Of these 3 Grade 5 events, only PML was considered related to 
JCAR017. One subject in Cohort 3 of Study BCM-001 died on Day 52 due to multiple organ dysfunction 
syndrome and one subject in Study BCM-002 died on Day 95 due to an AE of sepsis; neither of these 
events was considered related to JCAR017. 
Serious Adverse Events 
In  the  Pooled  3L+  DLBCL  Set,  treatment-emergent  SAEs  were  reported  in  154  out  of  349  subjects 
(44.1%)  and  occurred  most  frequently  in  the  SOCs  of  Immune  System  Disorders  (17.5%),  Nervous 
System Disorders (15.5%), and Infections and Infestations (10.3%) (Table 70).  
Treatment-emergent SAEs were generally similar in the 017001 DLBCL Treated Set and in the subset of 
subjects in the 017001 DLBCL Treated Set treated with DL2S v4. 
In Cohort 1 of Study BCM-001, the results for treatment-emergent SAEs were generally similar to those 
in the 017001 DLBCL Treated Set and the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set.

In  the  total  017001  DLBCL  Treated  Set,  treatment-emergent  SAEs  were  reported  in  122  out  of  269 
subjects  (45.4%)  and  occurred  most  frequently  in  the  SOCs  of  Immune  System  Disorders  (16.4%), 
Nervous  System  Disorders  (15.2%),  and  Infections  and  Infestations  (10.4%).  The  most  frequently 
reported  treatment-emergent  SAEs  were  CRS  (16.4%)  and  encephalopathy  (5.2%).  Treatment-
emergent SAEs in the DLBCL histology subgroup were very similar to those of the total 017001 DLBCL 
Treated Set. However, serious pneumonia was reported more frequently in subjects with HGL (13.9%) 
compared to the other subtypes (0% to 1.7%). In subjects with PMBCL, treatment-emergent SAEs were 
reported in 10 out of 15 subjects (66.7%) and the most frequently reported treatment-emergent SAEs 
were CRS (4 subjects, 26.7%) and Clostridium difficile infection (2 subjects, 13.3%). In subjects with 
FL3B,  no  treatment-emergent  SAEs  were  reported,  yet  limited  sample  size  hampers  proper  safety 
assessments. No clear differences were noted in the frequencies or types of treatment-emergent SAEs 
in the subset of subjects treated with DL2S v4 compared with those of the total 017001 DLBCL Treated 
Set (Table 71).

Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) 
Summary of Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Overviews of treatment-emergent AESI by category and grade are presented for the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL 
Set  in  Table  72.  AESIs  of  hypogammaglobulinaemia,  second  primary  malignancies  (SPMs),  and 
autoimmune disorders were analysed for the entire study period (both during and after the treatment-
emergent AE period), given their potential for late onset (Table 73). 
During the treatment-emergent period, CRS, prolonged cytopenia, and iiNT were the most frequently 
reported AESIs in the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set. 
Treatment-emergent AESIs were similar for subjects in the 017001 DLBCL Treated Set, in the subset of 
subjects in the 017001 DLBCL Treated Set who were treated at DL2S v4, and for subjects in Cohort 1 of 
Study BCM-001.

Cytokine  release  syndrome  was  ongoing  at  the  time  of  death  for  the  4  subjects  who  did  not  have 
resolution of CRS. However, CRS was not the cause of death for any of these subjects. Cytokine release 
syndrome was an SAE in 61 out of 349 subjects (17.5%), which was similar to the incidence reported in 
the 017001 DLBCL Treated Set (16.4%).

Neurologic Toxicity (NT) 
The  AEs  reported  are  referred  to  as  investigator-identified  neurologic  toxicity  (iiNT).  AEs  report  rates 
were similar in the 017001 DLBCL Treated Set (29.7% iiNT, 14.5% SAE iiNT), in Study 017007 (23.5% 
iiNT, 17.6% SAE iiNT) and in Study BCM-002 (23.1% iiNT, 11.5% SAE iiNT). No clear differences in the 
severity or frequency of iiNT were noted in the subset of subjects treated with DL2S v4 (31.7% iiNT, 
15.1% SAE iiNT) compared with the total 017001 DLBCL Treated Set. In Study BCM-001, the proportion 
of subjects who experienced iiNT of any grade (18.5%) was lower than that reported for the 017001 
DLBCL  Treated  Set  (29.7%)  and  the  Pooled  3L+  DLBCL  Set  (27.5%).  There  were  no  Grade  5  events 
attributed to iiNT (Table 78).

Neurotoxicity events of special interest (NESI) 
iiNT  events  were  evaluated  by  grouping  them  into  categories  of  NESI  that  are  defined  as  clusters  of 
neurological symptoms or signs that are associated with immunotherapies based on literature review.   
The 8 main NESIs were encephalopathy, aphasia, tremor, delirium, dizziness, headache, anxiety, and 
insomnia. Investigator-identified NT AEs that did not fall into one of the 8 main NESI categories were 
grouped  into  12  additional  categories,  based  on  medical  review  by  an  adjudication  panel.  This 
adjudication process consisted of review of PTs reported within the ND/PD SOC. 
The  additional  12  NESI  categories  were  ataxia/gait  disturbance,  brain  edema,  seizure,  cerebellar 
syndrome,  cerebrovascular,  mood  disorder,  motor  dysfunction,  visual  disturbance,  peripheral 
neuropathy, cognitive disorder, incontinence, and NOS (includes all other PTs from ND or PD SOC not 
specified in the above categories). 
Treatment-emergent iiNT by NESI Category in Studies in the Pooled 3L+DLBCL Set 
The 3 most frequent NESI categories for iiNT reported as SAE were encephalopathy (31 out of 349 
subjects; 8.9%), aphasia (12 out of 349 subjects; 3.4%), and tremor (10 out of 349 subjects; 2.9%).

Neurologic Toxicity by ND/PD SOC TEAEs 
For Study 017001, Study BCM-001, and the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set, in addition to the analyses of iiNT, 
all  TEAEs  coding  to  MedDRA  preferred  terms  within  the  Nervous  System  Disorders  and  Psychiatric 
Disorders (ND/PD) system organ classes (SOCs) were also evaluated. As with other CAR T-cell products, 
ND/PD SOC events were evaluated by grouping them into categories of NESI. The 8 main NESIs were 
encephalopathy, aphasia, tremor, delirium, dizziness, headache, anxiety, and insomnia.  
The incidence of TEAEs from the ND/PD SOC in Study BCM-001 Cohort 1 (55.6%) was lower than that 
observed  for  the  017001  DLBCL  Treated  Set  (74.3%)  and  the  Pooled  3L+  DLBCL  Set  (71.1%).  The 
incidences of TEAEs from the ND/PD SOC in Studies 017007 and BCM-002 were generally similar to that 
observed for the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set (Table 81).

Use of Concomitant Medications to Treat Investigator-identified Neurologic Toxicity 
Because some concomitant medications (e.g., tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids) were given for both 
CRS and iiNT, some subjects received tocilizumab or corticosteroids for a concurrent CRS event (Table 
82). 
Table 82. Concomitant Medication Use for Treatment of iiNT – Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set 
Correlations of Pharmacokinetic Parameters and Biomarkers with iiNT and ND/PD SOC Events 
In  order  to  explore  whether  there  were  biologic  correlations  differentiating  subjects  with  iiNT  events 
versus subjects with ND/PD SOC events that were not iiNT, PK parameters and inflammatory biomarkers 
were compared in these 2 populations. 
Of the total number of subjects in the DLBCL Treated Set (N = 269) as of 12 Aug 2019, 3 subpopulations 
were further defined and evaluated: 
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022

• 
iiNT: subjects who had ND/PD SOC events that were identified as iiNT (n = 80) 
•  not iiNT: subjects who had ND/PD SOC events that were not identified as iiNT (n = 120) 
•  no ND/PD SOC: subjects who did not have any ND/PD SOC events (n = 69) 
Subjects with all-grade iiNT had higher JCAR017 median maximum observed concentration (Cmax) and 
area under the concentration-time curve through 28 days after the first infusion (AUC0-28) than subjects 
with “not iiNT” (Figure 31). Similar to PK, the median values of CRP at baseline were significantly higher 
for subjects with iiNT as compared to those with “not iiNT” or “no ND/PD SOC” events (p = 0.0027 and 
p = 0.0001, respectively) (Figure 32). A similar relationship was observed for median peak values of 
CRP (Figure 33). No statistical difference was observed in the CRP median baseline between subjects 
with “not iiNT” events and those with “no ND/PD SOC events”, although the CRP peak median was 1.80-
fold greater in “not iiNT” than “no ND/PD SOC” (p = 0.0283).

Cytopenia and Prolonged cytopenia 
Prolonged cytopenia is defined as Grade ≥ 3 cytopenias of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or anaemia 
that  was  not  resolved  at  the  time  of  the  Day  29  visit.  Haematology  laboratory  data  were  collected 
systematically through the Day 29 visit for Study 017001, and up to 2 years for the other studies. For 
Study 017001, laboratory information past Day 29 was not required as per the protocol. However, sites 
were retrospectively asked to enter into the eCRF the date that prolonged cytopenias resolved to Grade 
2 or better and the result on that date (Table 83 and 84).

Infusion reactions 
Infusion-related reaction related to JCAR017 was reported in 4 out of 349 subjects (1.1%) in the 
Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set. These events occurred on the day of infusion and were Grade 1 or 2. 
Macrophage Activation Syndrome 
MAS is a potentially life-threatening adverse event that has been observed in association with approved 
anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapeutics and has been attributed to excess activation of CD8 T lymphocytes. 
Among  the  349  subjects  treated  in  the  Pooled  3L+  DLBCL  Set,  2  subjects  (0.6%)  in  Study  BCM-001 
developed Grade 4 MAS. Both subjects had postmortem findings consistent with MAS, but deaths were 
suspected  of  being  for  other  causes  (the  first  due  to  respiratory  failure  and  the  second  from  candida 
sepsis). 
Tumour Lysis Syndrome 
Tumour lysis syndrome was reported in 2 out of 349 subjects (0.6%) in the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set (both 
in subjects in the 017001 DLBCL Treated Set). Both events were Grade 3, and neither was reported as 
an SAE. Allopurinol was reported as a concomitant medication in 186 out of 269 subjects (69.1%) and 
rasburicase in 9 out of 269 subjects (3.3%), generally for prophylaxis of TLS or hyperuricemia. 
There  were  no  reports  of  TLS  in  Study  BCM-001.  Allopurinol  and  rasburicase  were  reported  as  a 
concomitant medication in 13 out of 27 subjects (48.1%) and 7 out of 27 subjects (25.9%), respectively, 
in Cohort 1. 
Infections (Grade ≥ 3) 
In the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set, all-grade TEAEs in the SOC of Infections and Infestations were reported 
in 133 out of 349 subjects (38.1%) (Table 85). The most frequent types of infections were pneumonia 
(22 out of 349 subjects, 6.3%), upper respiratory tract infection (15 subjects; 4.3%), candida infection 
(13 subjects; 3.7%), urinary tract infection (12 subjects; 3.4%), and sinusitis (11 subjects; 3.2%). All

other  PTs  were  reported  in  ≤  3%  of  subjects.  These  findings  were  similar  to  the  rates  of  all-grade 
infections in the 017001 DLBCL Treated Set.  
In Study BCM-001, all-grade infections occurred in 11 out of 37 subjects (29.7%).  
Treatment-emergent AEs of infection considered Grade ≥ 3 in severity were reported in 44 out of 349 
subjects  (12.6%)  with  pathogen  unspecified  reported  in  30  subjects  (8.6%),  bacterial  in  14  subjects 
(4.0%), and viral and fungal in 4 subjects each (1.1%). These results were similar to the rates of Grade 
≥ 3 infections in the 017001 DLBCL Treated Set.  
In addition to the three Grade 5 events previously described (2 in Study 017001 and 1 in Study BCM-
001), there were 2 additional events in Study BCM-002, 1 each of pneumonia and Staphylococcal sepsis.

Infection prophylaxis 
In  the  017001  DLBCL  Treated  Set,  sulfamethoxazole  trimethoprim  use  was  reported  in  141  of  269 
subjects (52.4%), generally for infection prophylaxis. 
Antivirals  were  reported  as  concomitant  medications,  generally  for  viral  infection  prophylaxis.  These 
include acyclovir in 237 of 269 subjects (88.1%), valacidovir in 26 of 269 subjects (9.7%), and ribavirin, 
ganciclovir, and valganciclovir in lower numbers of subjects. 
Antifungals for systemic use, which were reported as concomitant medications generally indicated for 
fungal infection prophylaxis, included fluconazole in 111 of 269 subjects (41.3%), micafungin in 35 of 
269  subjects  (13.0%),  micafungin  sodium  in  15  of  269  subjects  (5.6%),  posaconazole  in  14  of  269 
subjects (5.2%), amphotericin B in 12 of 269 subjects (4.5%), voriconazole in 11 of 269 subjects (4.1%), 
and isavuconazonium (sulfate), caspofungin (acetate), and itraconazole in lower numbers of subjects. 
In the Study BCM-001, sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim was used in 20 (74.1%) subjects in Cohort 1 (N 
=  27).  Acyclovir  was  used  in  15  (55.6%)  subjects,  valacyclovir  hydrochloride was  used  in 5  (18.5%) 
subjects, and valacyclovir was used in 4 (14.8%) subjects. 
Fluconazole was used in 9 (33.3%) subjects and amphotericin B was used in 4 (14.8%) subjects. Other 
antifungals were used in fewer than 20% of subjects. 
Hepatitis B and C. Subjects with a history of hepatitis B without active infection were eligible to screen 
for Studies 017001 and 017007, whereas subjects with previous history of hepatitis B were not eligible 
to screen for Studies BCM-001 or BCM-002. Eleven subjects (4.1%) in the 017001 DLBCL Treated Set 
had pre-treatment evidence of latent or suppressed hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Ten subjects were 
on one or more suppressive antiviral medications at the time of study enrollment and thereafter, and 
one has a hepatitis B surface antigen positive medical history and was never treated with a hepatitis B 
antiviral  medication  after  JCAR017  treatment.  None  of  the  11  subjects  developed  AEs  or  laboratory 
values suggestive of HBV reactivation following JCAR017 therapy. Additionally, a total of 2 subjects had

a history of hepatitis C in the Study 017001 DLBCL Treated Set and neither was associated with reports 
of worsening infection. 
Hypogammaglobulinaemia/B-cell Aplasia 
In the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set, TEAEs of hypogammaglobulinaemia were noted in 43 out of 349 subjects 
(12.3%) and were reported in 14 out of 302 subjects (4.6%) in the post-treatment emergent period. All 
events  were  Grade  1  or  2.  The  occurrence  of  treatment  emergent  hypogammaglobulinaemia  in  the 
017001 DLBCL Treated Set (13.8%) and in the BCM-001 (16.2%) was similar to that in the Pooled 3L+ 
DLBCL Set (12.3%) (Table 87). 
In the 017001 DLBCL Treated Set on the single-dose schedule, IgG < 500 mg/dL was observed in 123 
out of 253 subjects (49%) at baseline. On Days 29 and 365, 136 out of 236 subjects (58%) and 68 out 
of 112 subjects (61%) had IgG < 500 mg/dL. 
B-cell aplasia was evident at baseline in 92% (241 out of 262 subjects) of the 017001 DLBCL Treated 
Set. Consistent with transgene persistence, B-cell aplasia was observed in 98% of subjects (240 out of 
244 subjects) on Day 29, 93% (153 out of 165 subjects) on Day 90, 86% (100 out of 116 subjects) on 
Day 180, and 73% (51 out of 70 subjects) on Day 365. 
Subjects in Study BCM-001 (Cohort 1) exhibited a similar high rate of B-cell aplasia ranging from 100% 
on Day 29 (N = 23) and  Day 90 (N = 10), 86% (6 of 7 subjects) on Day 180, and 75% (3 out of 4 
subjects) on Day 270. 
These patients were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin replacement therapy following the 
institutional guidelines.

Second Primary Malignancies (SPMs) 
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022  
Page 195/252 
 
 
 
 
Second primary malignancies were defined as newly diagnosed reports of cancer not representing relapse 
of the underlying disease. 
In the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set, across both the treatment-emergent and posttreatment-emergent periods, 
23 subjects (6.6%) had 1 or more SPMs. In Study 017001, 20 subjects had a total of 29 events and in 
Study BCM-002, 3 subjects had a total of 3 events. There were no reported SPMs from Studies BCM-001 
or 17007. A total of 6 out of 349 subjects (1.7%) had SPMs reported during the treatment-emergent 
period,  including  five  subjects  from  Study  017001  (3  solid  tumours  [cutaneous  basal  cell  carcinoma, 
endometrial  adenocarcinoma,  and  cutaneous  squamous  cell  carcinoma  in  situ]  and  2  haematopoietic 
malignancies [peripheral T-cell lymphoma and MDS]), whereas one subject with Grade 3 colon carcinoma 
in situ was reported from Study BCM-002. During the posttreatment-emergent period, a total of 17 out 
of 302 subjects (5.6%) had SPMs: fifteen of these were in Study 017001 which included events of MDS, 
acute myelogenous leukaemia, basal cell carcinoma, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, squamous cell 
carcinoma  of  the  lung,  papillary  urothelial  carcinoma  of  the  bladder,  and  neoplasm  of  the  appendix, 
whereas two subjects developed cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (both Grade 3) in Study BCM-002 
(Table 88).

treatment-emergent Periods – Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set 
Notably, the cumulative incidence for SPM continues to increase throughout the 360 days of follow-up 
for subgroup of patients with CD4+:CD8+ cell components ratio > 1.2, although the numbers of 
patients at risk are low.

Autoimmune Disorders 
No subject in the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set developed autoimmune disorders. 
Hospitalisations 
Analyses  were  performed  for  subjects  who  received  JCAR017  in  an  inpatient  setting  (244  out  of  269 
subjects, 90.7%) and for those treated in an outpatient setting (25 out of 269 subjects, 9.3%) in Study 
017001.  Among 244 subjects who received JCAR017 in the inpatient setting, 18 subjects (7.4%) were 
admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU); the median number of ICU days was 7.5 (range 1 to 56 days;

Q1, Q3 = 3.0, 18.0 days). Among the 25 subjects who received JCAR017 in the outpatient setting, 18 
(72.0%) were admitted to hospital, with a median of 5.0 days after JCAR017 administration (range 3 to 
22 days) and 1 subject (5.6%) was admitted to the ICU for 3 days. 
Considering all hospitalisations up to the end of the study, 33 out of 269 subjects (12.3%) in the 017001 
DLBCL Treated Set were admitted to the ICU; the median number of ICU days was 8.0 (range 1 to 56 
days). 
As of the 19 Jun 2020 data cutoff date, out of 38 third-line or later (3L+) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 
(DLBCL)  subjects  with  intensive  care  unit  (ICU)  admissions  from  studies  017001  and  BCM-001,  37 
subjects were monitored as inpatients and 1 subject was monitored as an outpatient following liso-cel 
infusion.  Ten  out  of  the  37  subjects  admitted  to  ICU  after  liso-cel  had  concurrent  CRS,  11  had 
neurological events, 4 had infection, and 4 had hypotension. The only (1) outpatient subject admitted to 
the ICU had CRS. 
Long-term Follow-up – Study GC-LTFU-001 
Study GC-LTFU-001 is an ongoing, prospective, observational study evaluating the long-term safety and 
efficacy of JCAR017 and other effector T-cell therapeutics in consenting subjects previously treated in 
completed clinical trials. Subjects will be followed for 15 years from the last genetically modified (GM) 
T-cell infusion, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up, or death, whichever occurs first. 
All 29 subjects enrolled in the LTFU study at the time of the first data cut-off were from Study 017001: 
26 of the subjects were from the DLBCL Treated Set (i.e., in the DLBCL Cohort and received JCAR017); 
2 subjects were from the DLBCL Cohort and received non-conforming product; and 1 subject was from 
the MCL Cohort and received non-conforming product. 
Total on-study follow-up time while enrolled in Study GC-LTFU-001 for the 26 subjects from the 017001 
DLBCL Treated Set was 13.71 patient-years. Median age in the 29 subjects was 64 years (range 39 to 
79 years) at enrollment, 19 (65.5%) subjects were male, and most subjects were white (93.1%). 
There were no AEs reported in the clinical trial database as of the 12 Aug 2019 data cut-off date, but 
there was 1 SAE report in the Safety database. A single AE of basal cell carcinoma was reported from a 
55-year-old  woman  with  HGL  from  the  DLBCL  Treated  Set  who  enrolled  in  Study  GC-LTFU-001.  The 
investigator considered the tumour unrelated to prior JCAR017 treatment, but transgene assay was not 
performed from tumour tissue excised for cure. 
The data of the last cut-off date (19 Jun 2020) are reported in Day 120 Safety Update section. 
2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Graphs of mean haematology values over time (from day of JCAR017 administration through Day 29) in 
the 017001 DLBCL Treated Set are shown in Figure 34. 
In the 017001 DLBCL Treated Set, neutrophils showed a decline through Day 4, followed by recovery. 
This  pattern  was  consistent  with  the  receipt  of  LDC  administration  prior  to  JCAR017  Treatment. 
Lymphocyte counts were low at Day 1, followed by an increase over the first 2 weeks, concurrent with 
JCAR017  expansion.  Platelet  counts  appeared  relatively  stable  from  Day  1  through  Day  15,  then  a 
progressively decrease was observed. Haemoglobin levels generally increased from Day 8 through Day 
29.

Figure 34. Haematology Parameters (Mean and SE) Over Time in Study 017001 (DLBCL 
Cohort)-JCAR017-treated Set 
In the study BCM-001 (Cohort 1), neutrophil count showed a decline from screening through Day 8, with 
a fluctuation of the mean between 1.5 and 2.0 × 109/L neutrophil counts through Day 29 followed by a 
slow recovery. This pattern was consistent with the general receipt of bridging therapy during JCAR017 
manufacturing followed by LDC administration prior to JCAR017 infusion. Lymphocyte count decreased 
from time of LDC, likely reflecting the effects of anticancer therapy for disease control and LDC, followed 
by  an  increase  over  the  first  2  weeks  from  JCAR017  infusion,  concurrent  with  JCAR017  expansion. 
Platelet counts appeared relatively stable from screening to Day 15 and then decreased through Day 29 
followed by an increase at Day 90. Haemoglobin levels appeared relatively stable through Day 90. 
Shifts  from  pre-JCAR017  to  maximum  post-JCAR017  NCI  CTCAE  grade  during  treatment  for 
haematologic laboratory abnormalities in the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set are presented in Table 89. In detail: 
i) Pre-JCAR017, 331 (94.8%) subjects had Grade 3 or 4 lymphocyte count decreased, and post-JCAR017, 
325 (93.1%) subjects had maximum Grade 3 or 4 lymphocyte count decreased; 
ii) Pre-JCAR017, 95 (27.2%) subjects had Grade 3 or 4 neutrophil count decreased, and post-JCAR017, 
306 (87.7%) subjects had maximum Grade 3 or 4 neutrophil count decreased; 
iii) Pre-JCAR017, 34 (9.7%) subjects had Grade 3 or 4 platelet count decreased, and post-JCAR017, 143 
(41.0%) subjects had maximum Grade 3 or 4 platelet count decreased; 
iv) Pre-JCAR017, 45 (12.9%) subjects had Grade 3 anaemia, and post-JCAR017, 112 (32.1%) subjects 
had maximum Grade 3 anaemia.

2.6.8.5.  Safety in special populations 
Analysis of Adverse Events by Age 
In the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set, safety was generally similar between subjects < 65 years (n= 198) and 
≥ 65 years of age (n= 151) and between subjects < 75 years (n= 311) and ≥ 75 years of age (n= 38) 
(Table 91). However, a numerical increase in the proportion of subjects ≥ 75 years with iiNT compared 
with those < 75 years of age (36.8% versus 26.4%, respectively) was noted. 
Table 91. Treatment-emergent Adverse Events and Adverse Events of Special Interest by 
Age Group - Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set 
At  the  most  recent  data  cut-off  date  of  19  Jun  2020,  although  the  poor  representation  of  the  older 
population (n=38/359, 10.6% ≥ 75 years old), the proportions of TEAE types observed in subjects ≥ 75 
years old were generally similar to those observed in subjects < 65 years old. No pattern of unexpected 
events or safety signals was observed in the eldest subjects. For all of the specified adverse event (AE)

categories,  there  was  no  clinically  meaningful  increase  in  frequency  with  increasing  age.  No  clear 
differences (i.e., ≥ 20% absolute difference) were noted between any of the 3 age subgroups for any of 
the requested AE categories, or for any other system organ classes (SOCs) or individual preferred terms 
(PTs). An exception was the SOC of nervous system disorders with a numerical difference (> 10% but 
< 20%) in subjects 65 to < 75 years old (56.3%) compared with those 75 to < 85 years old (73.0%) 
and  the  SOC  of  vascular  disorders,  with  a  numerical  difference  in  subjects  <  65  years  old  (30.7%) 
compared with those 75 to < 85 years old (43.2%) (Table 92).

SPD Prior to LDC 
In the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set, the overall rate of TEAEs was similar between subjects with SPD ≥ 50 cm2 
(n= 114) and those with SPD < 50 cm2 (n= 231). Numerically larger proportions (≥ 15% difference) of 
subjects with SPD ≥ 50 cm2 had treatment-emergent SAEs (57.0% versus 38.1%, respectively), all-
grade CRS (53.5% versus 35.5%, respectively), and all grade iiNT (38.6% versus 22.5%, respectively) 
(Table 93).

(n= 78) and those with LDH < 500 U/L (n= 271), the incidences of Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs, treatment-emergent 
SAEs, all-grade CRS or iiNT events, and all-grade CRS events were higher in subjects with LDH ≥ 500

with baseline CRP < 20 mg/L (n= 172) and those with baseline CRP ≥ 20 mg/L (n= 176), the incidences 
of  JCAR017-related  TEAEs,  JCAR017-related  SAEs,  and  all-grade  CRS  or  iiNT  events  were  higher  in 
subjects with CRP ≥ 20 mg/L (Table 95).

Pre-existing secondary CNS lymphoma 
The rates of overall TEAEs were similar between subjects with and without secondary CNS involvement 
by lymphoma at the time of JCAR017 treatment. However, the rate of Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs was higher in 
subjects with secondary CNS involvement compared to those without (100% versus 78.6%) (Table 97). 
Adverse events of special interest were relatively similar between these groups. Notably, similar rates of 
iiNT  were  observed  between  both  groups  (78  of  262  subjects  [29.8%]  without  secondary  CNS 
involvement versus 2 of 7 subjects [28.6%] with secondary CNS involvement).

ECOG PS 
The analysis focused on the comparison between the Performance Status (PS) 0 and PS 1 subgroups 
because the numbers of subjects with Screening ECOG PS of 2 were too small to be clinically meaningful 
in the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set (n= 5) and 017001 DLBCL Treated Set (n= 4). 
In the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set, no clear differences in the rates of overall TEAEs and AESIs (CRS and /or 
iiNT) were observed for subjects who had Screening ECOG PS of 0 (n= 156) versus 1 (n= 188).  
ALC Prior to Leukapheresis 
The rates of overall TEAEs and AESIs (CRS and/or iiNT) were similar for subjects with ALC < 0.3 × 109/L 
prior to leukapheresis and those with ALC ≥ 0.3 × 109/L prior to leukapheresis, with the exception of 
higher rates of Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia in subjects with ALC < 0.3 × 109/L prior to leukapheresis 
(47.1% versus 25.6%, respectively) (Table 98).

Analysis of Adverse Events by Prior Treatment 
Prior HSCT and Autologous HSCT 
In the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set, updated data show that safety was similar between subjects who received 
prior HSCT (n= 121) and those who did not (n= 238), and between subjects who received prior auto-
HSCT (n= 117) and those who did not (n= 242). No clear differences in TEAEs or AESIs were observed. 
Prior Allogeneic HSCT 
In the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL  Set, updated data show that safety was generally similar between subjects 
who received prior allo-HSCT (n= 9) and those who did not (n= 350), although the rate of JCAR017-
related Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs was higher in subjects who did not receive prior allo-HSCT compared with those 
who did (39.1% versus 11.1%, respectively) (Table 99).

TEAEs Grade ≥ 3 infections were reported in 16.5% of subjects who received prior HSCT and in 11.3% 
of subjects who did not receive prior HSCT. There were no clear differences in the types of Grade ≥ 3 
infections observed (e.g., bacterial, fungal, viral, pathogen unspecified) in subjects who received prior 
HSCT versus those who did not. (Table 100) 
GVHD.  Two  chronic  GvHD  AEs  were  reported  out  of  9  liso-cel-treated  subjects  who  had  previously 
undergone prior allo-HSCT. One subject white female, 72 years old at the time of enrolment in Study 
017001,  reported  to  have  Grade  1  GVHD  in  the  gastrointestinal  tract  on  Study  Day  228  (after  an 
unrelated matched volunteer donor allo-HSCT).  
One subject white male, 61 years old at the time of enrolment in Study 017001, developed vomiting and 
diarrhoea, and was reported to have Grade 3 GvHD in the gastrointestinal tract (after allo-HSCT).

subgroups  for  CrCl  prior  to  LDC  (<  60  mL/min  [n=  51]  versus  ≥  60  mL/min  [n=  218])  or  LVEF  at 
screening (≥ 40 to < 50% [n= 13] and ≥ 50% [n= 256]), except for higher rates of Grade ≥ 3 anaemia 
in the < 60 mL/min group versus the ≥ 60 mL/min group (58.8% versus 32.6%, respectively) (Table 
101).

Analysis of Adverse Events by Region 
In  the  Pooled  3L+  DLBCL  Set,  safety  was  generally  similar  between  subjects  from  the  US  (n=  312), 
Europe (n= 27), and Japan (n= 10), with lower rates of treatment-emergent SAEs observed in subjects 
from Japan (10.0%) than in subjects from Europe (40.7%) or the US (45.5%). Rates of JCAR017-related 
Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs  were higher in subjects from Japan and subjects from Europe compared with those 
from the US (70% and 55.6% versus 34.6%, respectively). The rates of Grade 5 TEAEs in Europe, the 
US, and Japan were 7.4%, 2.9%, and 0%, respectively. No clear differences  in AESIs were observed 
between subjects from the US, Europe, and Japan. 
As of the updated safety data cutoff date of 19 Jun 2020 (Day 120 Update) for Studies 017001 and BCM-
001, the percentages of subjects who had Grade 5 TEAEs was 5.6% in Europe (change in denominator 
in Study BCM-001 due to increase in study population with 9 subjects), while they remained the same 
in the US (2.9%), and Japan (0%). 
Summary of Safety Findings in Subjects Receiving Outpatient Treatment 
In the 017001 DLBCL Treated Set, 25 subjects were treated in the outpatient setting. All have had TEAEs, 
and 17 (68.0%) subjects had Grade ≥ 3 events. There were no Grade 5 TEAEs. The most frequent Grade 
≥3  events  were  neutropenia  (44.0%),  anaemia  (40.0%),  thrombocytopenia  (12.0%),  and  febrile 
neutropenia (12%). Cytokine release syndrome was reported in 12 out of 25 subjects (48.0%); 1 subject 
(4.0%) had Grade 3 or 4 CRS. Investigator-identified neurologic toxicity was reported in 11 out of 25 
subjects  (44.0%);  2  subjects  (8.0%)  had  Grade  3  or  4  iiNT.  Out  of  the  25  subjects  treated  in  an 
Assessment report

outpatient  setting,  18  (72.0%)  were  admitted  to  hospital,  with  a  median  of  5.0  days  after  JCAR017 
administration (range 3 to 22 days). 
Summary of Safety Findings in Subjects Treated with Nonconforming Product 
Thirty-one subjects received a nonconforming product. Reasons for why such product was considered 
nonconforming in Studies 017001 DLBCL and BCM-001 are provided in Table 102. As of 19 Jun 2020, no 
additional subjects from Studies 017001 and BCM-001 have received nonconforming product. 
Table 102. Treatment-emergent AESIs by Nonconforming Reason – Subjects Who Received 
Nonconforming Product in Study 017001 DLBCL Cohort and Study BCM-001 Cohorts 1+3 
In the 017001 DLBCL Cohort, the overall frequencies of TEAEs, Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs, AESIs, and Grade 5 
TEAEs  reported  in  subjects  treated  with  the  nonconforming  product  appeared  to  be  similar  to  those 
treated with JCAR017 (Table 103).

Clinical outcomes across manufacturing process versions (CLOVER Report): Safety Evaluation 
In Study 017001, JCAR017 was manufactured using 4 different manufacturing processes, and all but 3 
subjects were treated with drug product manufactured with either the two precommercial processes (v2 
and  v3)  or  the  proposed  commercial  process  (v4).  Within  v4,  lentiviral  vector  was  produced  at  two 
different sites as v1.0 and v1.2 respectively. A summary of the incidence of TEAEs in the DLBCL Treated 
Set, DL1S and DL2S, for the precommercial and proposed commercial manufacturing processes and by 
vector manufacturing site is shown in Table 104. The overall incidence and severity of adverse events 
were generally similar between manufacturing process versions. Between the vector manufacturing sites, 
the overall incidence of TEAEs was similar (100% in both v4 vector groups). While the percentage of 
subjects  with  Grade  3-4  and  serious  TEAEs,  and  JCAR017-related  TEAEs  and  higher  grade  or  serious 
JCAR017-related TEAEs was higher in one (vector v1.0)subgroup, the differences were often based on 
small numbers of subjects in vector v1.2 group and all differences were < 15%.

2.6.8.6.  Immunological events 
Immunogenicity 
The  applicant  provided  immunogenicity  results  from  Studies  017001  and  BCM-001  based  on  longer 
follow-up  data  (cut-off  date  19th  June  2020).  In  the  pooled  studies,  pre-existing  anti-therapeutic 
antibodies  (ATAs)  were  detected  in  9.3%  (29/309)  of  patients,  and  treatment-induced  or  treatment-
boosted ATAs were detected in 15.1% (46/304) of patients. The relationships between ATA status and 
efficacy, safety or pharmacokinetics were not conclusive due to a limited number of patients (see also 
PK/PD section).  
2.6.8.7.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
JCAR017 is a cellular product that is generally administered as a one-time infusion. Because it is a cellular 
product,  it  is  not  cleared  by  the  usual  mechanisms  that  apply  to  small  molecules  or  antibodies.  No 
controlled clinical studies have been performed to directly address drug interactions with JCAR017. 
False Positive HIV Tests 
Human immunodeficiency virus nucleic acid amplification tests and HIV viral load testing can be falsely 
positive and may not reflect true HIV infection. 
Anti-EGFR Monoclonal Antibody JCAR017 Ablation 
A truncated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is expressed on the chimeric antigen receptor that 
is part of JCAR017. The applicant underlines that, unrelated to prior JCAR017 treatment, patients can 
develop incidental EGFR-expressing malignancies such as colorectal carcinoma, head and neck squamous 
cell carcinoma, or non-small-cell lung cancer, for which anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (mab) may be 
indicated.  Administration  of  anti-EGFR  mabs,  such  as  cetuximab,  panitumumab,  or  necitumumab,  to 
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022  
Page 215/252 
 
 
 
 
 
treat such malignancies could also deplete the number of persistent JCAR017 cells and reduce activity 
against the lymphoma for which the JCAR017 was previously administered.  
2.6.8.8.  Use in pregnancy and lactation 
There is no information regarding JCAR017 treatment of pregnant women. No animal reproductive and 
development toxicity studies have been conducted with JCAR017 to evaluate whether it can cause foetal 
harm when administered to a pregnant female. It is not known whether JCAR017 has the potential to be 
transferred  to  the  foetus.  Based  on  the  JCAR017  mechanism  of  action,  the  transduced  cells  could 
theoretically  cross  the  placenta  and  cause  foetal  B-cell  lymphocytopenia  and  worsen  the  temporary 
hypogammaglobulinaemia  of  infancy.  Therefore,  JCAR017  is  not  recommended  in  women  who  are 
pregnant, and pregnancy after JCAR017 infusion should be discussed with the treating physician. 
There  is  no  information  regarding  the  presence  of  JCAR017  in  human  milk,  effects  on  the  breastfed 
infant, or effects on milk production. 
Contraception 
There  is  no  information  to  provide  a  recommendation  concerning  duration  of  contraception  following 
treatment with JCAR017. 
Infertility 
There are no data on the effect of JCAR017 on fertility. 
2.6.8.9.  Overdose, drug abuse and withdrawal and rebound 
In Study 017001, a single subject received 2 doses of Dose Level 2 (2 doses of 100 × 106 CAR+ T cells), 
with  each  dose  administered  14  days  apart.  No  Grade  ≥  3  TEAEs  or  treatment-emergent  SAEs  were 
reported for this subject. 
2.6.8.10.  Effects on ability to drive or operate machinery or impairment of mental ability 
Breyanzi can have a major influence on the ability to drive and use machines, due to the potential for 
neurologic events, including altered mental status or seizures. 
2.6.8.11.  Transgene Persistence 
Transgene persistence (defined by presence of transgene above the lower limit of detection) in the Study 
017001  DLBCL  Treated  Set  (single-dose  schedule)  was  observed  in  98%  of  subjects  (236  out  of  240 
subjects) on Day 29, 77% (126 out of 163 subjects) on Day 90, 63% (72 out of 114 subjects) on Day 
180, 52% (35 out of 67 subjects) on Day 365, and 45% (9 out of 20 subjects) on Day 730. No clear 
difference in transgene persistence was observed among the different dose levels. 
In Cohort 1 of Study BCM-001, transgene persistence was observed in 95% of subjects (20 out of 21 
subjects) on Day 29, 63% (5 out of 8 subjects) on Day 90, 20% (1 out of 5 subjects) on Day 180, and 
33% (1 out of 3 subjects) on Day 270. In Cohort 3 of Study BCM-001, persistence of JCAR017 transgene 
was observed in 100% of subjects (10 out of 10 subjects) on Day 29, 100% (7 out of 7 subjects) on Day 
90, and 33% (1 out of 3 subjects) on Day 180.

2.6.8.12.  Replication-competent Lentivirus (RCL) 
Replication-competent  lentivirus  testing  was  assessed  using  qPCR  to  detect  viral  vector  envelope 
sequences on DNA obtained from peripheral blood. Through the data cutoff point in Study 017001, blood 
was  tested  for  RCL  in  208  subjects  in  the  DLBCL  Cohort  in  the  JCAR017-treated  Set  on  Day  90,  158 
subjects on Day 180, 92 subjects on Day 365, and 27 subjects at the end of the study (24-month visit). 
Moreover, through the data cut-off point for Cohort 1 of Study BCM-001, the presence of RCL was tested 
in 12 out of 27 subjects on Day 90 and 7 out of 27 subjects on Day 180. None of these samples tested 
positive for RCL. 
2.6.8.13.  Discontinuation due to AEs 
For  the  pooled  3L+  DLBCL,  discontinuation  from  study  after  JCAR017  infusion  were  due  to  death 
(29.4%), lost to follow-up (0.4%), withdrew consent (2.8%) and other (1.1%). There were apparently 
no  patients  reported  that  has  discontinued  treatment  due  to  AE.  All  subjects  who  received  JCAR017 
completed study treatment. 
2.6.8.14.  Post marketing experience 
There are no post marketing data at this time. 
2.6.8.15.  Comparisons of Therapies Approved for 3L+ Large B-cell Lymphoma 
There  are  3  EMA-approved  therapies  for  3L+  large  B-cell  lymphoma:  2  CAR  T-cell  interventions 
(axicabtagene  ciloleucel  and  tisagenlecleucel),  and  polatuzumab  vedotin  (in  combination  with  BR).  In 
the  absence  of  patient-level  data,  ad-hoc  cross-study  comparisons  have  been  performed.  In  general, 
JCAR017  has  demonstrated  numerically  lower  AESI rates  (CRS,  Grade  ≥  3  NT,  Grade  ≥  3  infections) 
than axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta SmPC, 2019), in a poor prognosis and high-risk population (Table 
106).

DAY 120 SAFETY UPDATE (data cutoff date: 19 Jun 2020) 
The safety profile of JCAR017, based on data from Day 120 safety update with data cutoff date 19 Jun 
2020,  is  generally  consistent  with  the  safety  profile  that  was  reported  in  the  original  marketing 
authorisation application (MAA). In the interim, with 10 new subjects added (9 from BCM-001 Cohort 1 
and 1 from the 017001 DLBCL cohort) to the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Treated Set, the median on-study follow-
up  time  increased  from  9.17  to  10.74  months  (minimum  0.1  month  and  maximum  45.2  months), 
while the total on-study follow-up went from 313.6 to 395.7 patient-years. The cumulative follow-up 
in Study 017001 was more than 343 patient-years (including 227.8 patient-years at Dose Level 2 [DL2] 
and 158.9 patient-years at DL2 version 4 [v4]). In Study BCM-001 Cohort 1, in the approximately 9 
months between the data cutoff dates of the original MAA and the Day 120 update (13 Sep 2019 to 19 
Jun 2020), the median on-study follow-up time increased from 2.40 to 6.36 months, with the total on-
study follow-up going from 10.2 to 23.5 patient-years. No new subjects were treated in Cohort 3 (10 
subjects) and the median on-study follow-up time in BCM-001 Cohort 3 increased from 4.42 to 10.96 
months, with a total on-study follow-up going from 4.1 to 7.7 patient-years. In the long-term follow-
up (LTFU) Study GC-LTFU-001, in the approximately 10 months between the data cutoff dates of the 
original MAA and the Day 120 update (12 Aug 2019 to 19 Jun 2020), 43 new subjects were enrolled (up 
from 29 to 72 subjects) from studies BCM-001 and 017001. For subjects from Study 017001, the median 
on-study follow-up time increased from 0.51 to 0.75 months, while the total on-study follow-up went 
from 15.31 to 58.61 patient-years. For subjects from Study BCM-001, as of 19 Jun 2020, the median 
on-study follow-up time for Cohort 1 and Cohort 3 were 0.36 and 0.17 months, respectively, while the 
total on-study follow-up times were 1.52 and 0.74 patient-years, respectively. 
Treatment-emergent Adverse Events. The treatment-emergent safety profile at Day 120 remained 
consistent with that reported in the MAA, as there were few additional liso-cel-treated subjects with new 
data in the 017001 DLBCL Cohort (1 subject), BCM-001 Cohort 1 (9 subjects), and the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL 
Set (10 subjects). No additional subject data was included from the other studies/cohorts of the Pooled 
3L+ DLBCL Set (Studies BCM-002, 017007, and BCM-001 Cohort 3).

There were no significant changes in any of the TEAE categories or AESIs in the 017001 DLBCL Treated 
Set. Almost all of the 270 subjects (n=268; 99.3%) had TEAEs. Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs were reported in 78.9% 
of subjects, and Grade 5 TEAEs occurred in 2.6% of subjects. One additional subject was reported with 
a Grade  ≥ 3 TEAE related to liso-cel treatment (lymphopenia). Consistent with the original MAA data 
(SCS  Section  2.1.7.1),  in  the  017001  DLBCL  Treated  Set,  122  out  of  270  subjects  (45.2%)  reported 
treatment-emergent SAEs, most frequently in the SOCs of Immune System Disorders (16.3%), Nervous 
System Disorders (15.2%), and Infections and Infestations (10.4%). CRS (16.3%) and encephalopathy 
(5.2%) were the most frequently reported treatment-emergent SAEs. There were no major differences 
in  the  safety  findings  of  subjects  in  Study  017001  treated  at  DL2S  (overall  or  v4)  compared  to  the 
017001 DLBCL Cohort or the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set. 
In BCM-001 Cohort 1, during the interim between the MAA and D120 Safety update data cutoff dates 
(13 Sep 2019 and 19 Jun 2020), there were an additional 9 subjects with TEAEs and Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs, 
7  subjects  with  treatment-emergent  SAEs,  and  no  new  Grade  5  TEAEs.  The  percentages  of  subjects 
within each category of TEAE in the updated data remained generally consistent (differences of ≤ 10%) 
with the MAA. The results by TEAE category were generally similar to those in the 017001 DLBCL Treated 
Set and the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set, with the exception of higher percentages of subjects having Grade 
≥ 3 TEAEs in Cohort 1 (94.4%) compared to the 017001 DLBCL Treated Set and the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL 
Set (78.9% and 80.8%, respectively). The most frequently reported Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs in Cohort 1 were 
neutropenia  (80.6%  [66.7%  in  the  MAA]),  anaemia  (30.6%  [33.3%  in  the  MAA]),  thrombocytopenia 
(25.0% [14.8% in the MAA]), leukopenia (22.2% [22.2% in the MAA]), lymphopenia (19.4% [18.5% in 
the MAA]), and febrile neutropenia (19.4% [11.1% in the MAA]). In agreement with the applicant, this 
may be due to a higher percentage of subjects receiving anticancer therapy for disease control in Cohort 
1 compared to Study 017001 (75% versus 58.9%). Therefore, subjects may have had less bone marrow 
reserve when they received LDC followed by liso-cel. Grade 5 TEAEs were reported in 2 subjects (5.6%) 
while treatment-emergent SAEs were reported in 18 subjects (50.0%). 
In the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set, as of the Day 120 Safety Update data cutoff date (19 Jun 2020) and 
consistent  with  the original  MAA  data,  almost  all  359  subjects  (99.4%)  had  TEAEs.  Grade  ≥  3  TEAEs 
were reported in 80.8% of subjects (80.5% in the MAA), and Grade 5 TEAEs occurred in 3.1% (3.2% in 
the MAA) with no Grade 5 TEAEs occurring during the interval of the Safety Update. Treatment-emergent 
SAEs  were  reported  in  44.6%  (44.1%  in  the  MAA),  most  frequently  in  the  SOCs  of  Immune  System 
Disorders (17.3%), Nervous System Disorders (15.6%), and Infections and Infestations (10.9%). The 
most  frequently  reported  treatment-emergent  SAE  was  CRS  (17.3%);  all  other  treatment-emergent 
SAEs  were  reported  in  <  5%  of  subjects.  These  findings  are  similar  to  those  for  the  017001  DLBCL 
Treated Set, and the corresponding percentages for the pooled results in the Safety Update are similar 
to those reported in the original MAA. 
Posttreatment-emergent Adverse Events. AEs reported during the posttreatment-emergent period 
as  of  the  Safety  Update  data  cutoff  date  for  the  Pooled  3L+  DLBCL  Set  were  similar  to  those  for  the 
017001 DLBCL Treated Set and BCM-001 Cohort 1, most frequently in the SOC of Blood and Lymphatic 
System Disorders. Percentages were consistent with those reported in the original MAA. Only in BCM-
001 Cohort 3, the percentages of subjects with any grade and Grade ≥ 3 AEs in the Blood and Lymphatic 
disorders  SOC  was  higher  (80.0%  and  70.0%,  respectively)  than  in  the  total  Pooled  3L+  DLBCL  Set 
(23.7% and 18.7%, respectively), although given the small number of subjects from Study BCM-001 
Cohort 3, comparisons should be interpreted with caution. 
Deaths. In the total 017001 DLBCL Treated Set, 129 out of 270 subjects (47.8%) [122/269 subjects, 
45.4% in the MAA], died any time after the first liso-cel infusion. Most of the deaths reported after the 
first  liso-cel  treatment  were  due  to  disease  progression  (108  of  129),  with  11  due  to  AEs,  5  due  to 
unknown causes, and 5 due to other causes (stroke unrelated to study, pneumonia, and diffuse intra-
abdominal ischemia). Out of 129 deaths after liso-cel treatment, 96 deaths occurred more than 90 days 
Assessment report

after the last liso-cel treatment. Nine of the 129 deaths occurred within 30 days after the first liso-cel 
treatment, with 6 due to disease progression and 3 due to AEs (diffuse alveolar damage, septic shock, 
and cardiomyopathy). No clear differences were noted in the frequencies or causes of death reported in 
the subset of subjects treated with DL2S v4 compared with those for the total 017001 DLBCL Treated 
Set. 
In the BCM-001 Cohort 1, 17 out of 36 subjects (47.2%) died any time after the first liso-cel infusion. 
Of the 17 deaths after liso-cel treatment, 12 deaths occurred more than 90 days after the last liso-cel 
treatment.  One  of  the  17  deaths  occurred  within  30  days  after  the  first  liso-cel  treatment  due  to  AE 
(respiratory failure). Most of the deaths reported after the first liso-cel treatment were due to disease 
progression (15 of 17) and 2 were due to AEs. In particular, one death was due to an adverse event 
(cardiac arrest on Study Day 203). This subject received a nonconforming product.  
In the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set, 159 out of 359 subjects (44.3%) died any time after the first liso-cel 
infusion. Most deaths were due to disease progression (133 of 159), 16 were due to AEs, 6 to unknown 
cause and 5 to other.  
Adverse  Events  of  Special  Interest.  In  Study  017001,  regarding  the  additional  AESIs  of  second 
primary  malignancy  (SPM),  hypogammaglobulinaemia  and  Grade  ≥  3  infections  in  the  treatment-
emergent  and  posttreatment-emergent  period,  since  the  original  MAA,  1  additional  subject  had 
hypogammaglobulinaemia (5.2% [4.9% in the MAA]) and 2 additional subjects (both with MDS) reported 
SPMs in the posttreatment-emergent period (17 subjects total [6.8%], from 15 subjects [6.1%] in the 
MAA). No major differences in the percentages of subjects with AESIs of hypogammaglobulinaemia and 
second primary malignancies were observed in the posttreatment emergent period for subjects in the 
017001 DLBCL Cohort treated at DL2S or with DL2S v4.  
In Study BCM-001, there were still only 5 subjects with hypogammaglobulinaemia reported (13.9%; 
18.5%  in  the  MAA).  One  new  subject  (3.1%)  in  BCM-001  Cohort  1  had  a  SPM  in  the  posttreatment-
emergent period.  
Taking  in  account  the  cumulative  SPMs  as  of  the  19  Jun  2020  data  cutoff  date  for  liso-cel-treated 
subjects in the 017001 DLBCL Cohort and BCM-001 Cohorts 1+3, there were no new treatment-emergent 
SPMs. In the posttreatment-emergent period, SPMs were reported for 17 subjects from Study 017001 
(15 subjects in the MAA) and 1 subject from Study BCM-001 (Cohort 1) (0 subjects in the MAA). 
As  of  19  Jun  2020,  haematopoietic  second  malignancies  following  liso-cel  treatment  have  been 
reported  in  Study  017001.  During  the  treatment-emergent  period,  single  cases  of  peripheral  T-cell 
lymphoma  (PTCL)  and  myelodysplastic  syndrome  (MDS)  were  reported.  During  the  posttreatment-
emergent  period,  9  subjects  in  Study  017001  developed  new haematopoietic  second  malignancies:  7 
subjects with MDS and 2 subjects with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), with a cumulative incidence of 
2.5%  for  MDS  (n=8  of  316  3L+  DLBCL  subjects  treated  with  liso-cel  in  Study  017001  and  BCM-001 
Cohorts 1+3 through the 19 Jun 2020 data cutoff date) and 0.6% (n=2 of 316) for AML. Although the 
incidence  rates  of  MDS  and  AML  are  higher  than  those  observed  in  the  general  population,  they  are 
consistent with those previously described (Cordeiro et al, 2020). 
As of 19 Jun 2020, solid tumour second malignancies have been reported in 13 subjects in Study 
017001  and  1  subject  in  Study  BCM-001  (Cohort  1).  Most  of  the  solid  tumour  second  malignancies 
occurred  during  the  posttreatment-emergent  period,  and  all  of  these  SPMs  were  considered  by  the 
investigators  not  to  be  related  to  liso-cel  treatment.  During  the  treatment-emergent  period,  solid 
tumours  were  reported  in  3  subjects  in  Study  017001.  Malignancies,  that  were  reported  in  1  subject 
each,  included  cutaneous  BCC,  endometrial  adenocarcinoma,  and  cutaneous  SCC  in  situ  (Bowen’s 
disease). During the posttreatment-emergent period, 10 subjects in Study 017001 developed additional 
solid tumours, including 5 subjects with BCC, 4 subjects with cutaneous SCC, 1 subject with SCC of the 
Assessment report

lung, 1 subject with papillary urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, and 1 subject with neoplasm of the 
appendix. Of note, 1 subject in Study 017001 had multiple SPMs reported (MDS, cutaneous BCC, and 
cutaneous  SCC).  One  subject  in  Study  BCM-001  Cohort  1  was  diagnosed  with  lung  adenocarcinoma 
during the posttreatment-emergent period. For cutaneous SPM, with a cumulative incidence of 1.6% to 
1.9% and a follow-up adjusted incidence rate of 1.3 to 1.7 events/100 patient-years, these rates are in 
line  with  those  expected  for  heavily  pretreated  patients  with  underlying  haematologic  malignancies 
(Leisenring, 2006, Omland, 2016). 
Three new subjects had Grade ≥ 3 infections during the additional follow-up time in BCM-001 Cohort 1. 
For  the  long-term  follow  up  Study  GC-LTFU-001,  at  the  safety  update  (19  Jun  2020),  the  first  4 
subjects  from  Study  BCM-001  and  additional  39  subjects  from  Study  017001  were  enrolled,  thus 
increasing the total number of subjects of Study 017001 to 68. Only 3 (4.3%) subjects reported AEs (2 
subjects, 2.9% with at least 1 Grade 3 or 4 AE, and 1 subject, 1.4% with an SAE). 
Justification of Recommended Dose Range: safety aspects 
The proposed Breyanzi(liso cel; JCAR017) dose for the indication sought is as follows: “The target dose 
is 100 × 106 CAR+ viable T cells (consisting of a target 1:1 ratio of CD8+ and CD4+ cell components) 
within a range of 44 to 120 × 106 CAR+ viable T cells”.  
The applicant recommends a dose range of 44 to 120 × 106 CAR+ T cells to reflect the clinical experience 
at  assigned  DL1  and  DL2.  In  each  DL,  the  actual  administered  dose  of  liso-cel  varied  within  a  range 
(Table 107).  
Table 107. Assigned Dose Level and Administered Dose in Studies 017001 and BCM-001 
Therefore, SmPC Section 4.8 includes the Modified Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Treated Set (n= 314) comprising 
the 4 studies in the proposed indication, Study 017001 (n= 229), BCM-001 Cohort 1 (n= 36) and Cohort 
3 (n= 10), 017007 (n= 17) and the monotherapy phase of BCM-002 (n= 22), for subjects who received 
an administered dose of 44 to 120 × 106 CAR+ viable T cells (assigned DL1+DL2). Four subjects assigned 
to DL1 in Study BCM-002, who received fewer than 44 × 106 CAR+ viable T cells, are excluded from this 
data set. Studies BCM-001 and 017007 evaluated only DL2 and no subjects in these 2 studies received 
doses outside the range of 44 to 120 × 106 CAR+ viable T cells. The data cut-off dates used are 04 
Jan 2021 for 017001 and BCM-001 and 01 Aug 2019 for 017007 and BCM-002. Consistent with 
this  representation,  the  applicant  recommends  the  data  in  SmPC  Sections  5.1  and  4.8  reflecting  the 
entire  clinical  experience  of  CD4+:CD8+  cell  components  ratios  (ratio  range  0.7  to  2.2)  that  were 
administered in the recommended dose range of 44 to 120 × 106 CAR+ T cells. However, in the post 
marketing setting, the applicant will recommend a CD4+:CD8+ cell components ratio equal to 1:1 with 
a range of 0.8 to 1.2, to minimise variance in clinical outcomes and standardise the contribution of each 
cell  component.  The  ratio  range  of  0.8  to  1.2  represents  the  ratio  range  administered  to  >  90%  of 
DL1+DL2 subjects and is associated with similar safety outcomes at DL1+DL2 when compared with the 
entire clinical experience of CD4+:CD8+ cell components ratios (ratio range of 0.7 to 2.2). 
At the cut-off dates mentioned the most common adverse reactions in the Modified Pooled 3L+DLBCL 
Treated Set (n= 314) of any grade were neutropenia (67%), anaemia (48%), CRS (39%), fatigue (38%),

and  thrombocytopenia  (37%).  The  most  common  serious  adverse  reactions  were  CRS  (17%), 
encephalopathy  (11%), 
infection  with  an  unspecified  pathogen  (6%),  neutropenia  (4%), 
thrombocytopenia (4%), aphasia (4%), pyrexia (4%), bacterial infectious disorders (4%), delirium (4%), 
tremor (4%), febrile neutropenia (3%), and hypotension (3%). The most common Grade 3 or higher 
adverse reactions included neutropenia (63%), anaemia (35%), thrombocytopenia (29%), leukopenia 
(21%), infection with an unspecified pathogen (9%) and febrile neutropenia (8%). 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Subjects  in  Studies  017001,  017007,  and  BCM-002  were  all  from  the  US,  while  subjects  in  BCM-001 
Cohorts 1+3 were from Europe (n= 27, Cohort 1; n= 36 at the second cut-off date) and Japan (n= 10, 
Cohort  3).  Overall,  the  EU  population  was  represented  only  in  a  percentage  equal  to  7.7%.  The 
characteristics of the treated population in the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set were representative of the 3L+ 
large B-cell lymphoma population and were consistent with a heavily treated, poor prognosis population, 
although a higher percentage of subjects received anticancer therapy for disease control before starting 
JCAR017 in Study BCM-001 (Cohort 1) compared to Study 017001 (77.8% versus 59.1%). Data from 
study BCM-001 are considered of particular relevance for EU patients, since subjects are treated with 
the same manufacturing process that is proposed for commercial use in the EU. On the other hand, the 
limited sample size, the reduced follow-up and the significant differences in baseline characteristics could 
represent a concern for the evaluation of the safety profile of this product. The updated safety data and 
in particular the updated Bridging Analysis Report, referred to by the applicant, provided a comparative 
analysis of safety parameters, including adverse events (AEs), AESIs, AEs related to liso-cel treatment, 
and Grade ≥ 3 AEs during the treatment-emergent and post-treatment-emergent periods using the D120 
data  cut-off  date  (19  Jun  2020)  for  Studies  BCM-001  and  017001.  Of  note,  at  the  time  of  the  D120 
Bridging  Analysis,  with  additional  follow-up  time  (at  least  6  months  for  all  treated  subjects  in  both 
studies)  and  with  additional  subjects  enrolled  in  Study  BCM-001  (n=  36  in  Cohort  1),  the  subjects’ 
baseline  characteristics  became  more  similar  between  the  two  studies.  Overall,  subjects  had  similar 
numbers of prior treatments (≥ 3 prior lines of therapy: 47.2% versus 51.4%, respectively), and similar 
tumour  burden  (≥  500  U/L  LDH  at  pre-LDC  visit:  19.4%  versus  21.5%,  respectively).  However,  still 
more subjects in Study BCM-001 were less fit (ECOG PS 2; 8.3% versus 0%) and had received anticancer 
therapy  for  disease  control  when  compared  with  subjects  in  Study  017001  (75.0%  versus  47.7%, 
respectively). Overall, the incidence of AEs and AESIs in the treatment-emergent (Day 1 to Day 90) and 
post-treatment emergent (Day 91 to end of Study) periods was generally similar. Grade ≥ 3 liso-cel-
related  TEAEs  were  higher  in  Study  BCM-001  compared  with  Study  017001  (61.1%  versus  35.5%, 
respectively), mainly driven by higher incidences of neutropenia, anaemia and febrile neutropenia. No 
notable difference in the incidence of individual AESIs between the 2 studies was reported. In the total 
Pooled  3L+  DLBCL  Set,  the  median  age  was  63.0  years.  Subjects  in  Study  BCM-001  tended  to  be 
younger, with more subjects being < 65 years (70.3% as of 13 Sep 2019; 61.1% as of 19 Jun 2020) 
when compared to the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set (56.7%). Therefore, the poor representation of the older 
European population in Study BCM-001 (n=0 ≥ 75 years), and, more generally, in the context of the 
total  Pooled  3L+  DLBCL  Set  could  represent  a  concern  for  the  evaluation  of  the  safety  profile  of  this 
product for the older population. In summary, despite the poor representation of the older population 
(n=38/359, 10.6% ≥ 75 years old), the proportions of TEAE types observed in subjects ≥ 75 years old 
were generally similar to those observed in subjects < 65 years old. No pattern of unexpected events or 
safety signals was observed in the eldest subjects. For all of the specified adverse event (AE) categories, 
there was no clinically meaningful increase in frequency with increasing age. No clear differences (i.e., 
≥ 20% absolute difference) were noted between any of the 3 age subgroups for any of the requested 
AE  categories,  or  for  any  other  system  organ  classes  (SOCs)  or  individual  preferred  terms  (PTs).  An 
exception was the SOC of nervous system disorders with a numerical difference (> 10% but < 20%) in 
Assessment report

subjects aged 65 to < 75 years (56.3%) compared with those aged 75 to < 85 years (73.0%) and the 
SOC of vascular disorders, with a numerical difference in subjects aged < 65 years (30.7%) compared 
with those aged 75 to < 85 years (43.2%). The applicant has included safety in patients ≥ 75 years of 
age  as  missing  information  in  the  RMP  and  additional  information  on  the  safety  of  liso-cel  in  elderly 
patients will be provided in the post-authorisation safety study (JCAR017-BCM-005).  
Most subjects (76.2%) were refractory to their most recent prior treatment and over a third of subjects 
(34.4%) had received prior HSCT, including 9 subjects (2.6%) having received prior allogeneic stem cell 
transplantation. Approximately one-third of subjects had at least one measure of high disease burden 
as defined by SPD ≥ 50 cm2 (33.0%) or LDH ≥ 500 U/L (22.3%), and half (50.6%) of subjects had high 
baseline inflammatory state as defined by elevated CRP (≥ 20 mg/L) at baseline. Creatinine clearance 
(CrCl)  between  25  and  60  mL/min  were  present  in  19%  of  patients  and  4.8%  had  screening  left 
ventricular ejection  fraction  (LVEF)  <  50%  but  ≥  40%.  The  lymphodepleting  chemotherapy  regimens 
were received by 88.8% of patients, in addition to bridging chemotherapy in 60.2% of patients. Due to 
the lack of a washout period, toxicities associated with these cytotoxic treatments can carry over into 
the post-infusion portion of the study. Consequently, the determination of whether a relationship exists 
between a given AE and JCAR017 infusion can be confounded by this carry-over effect. On this point, 
with the exception of higher rates of all grade and Grade ≥ 3 anaemia and thrombocytopenia, there were 
no significant differences in the safety profile between subjects who received intensive bridging therapy, 
followed by the protocol-specified dose of LDC, and those who did not in the combined 017001 DLBCL 
Cohort and BCM-001 Cohort 1 liso-cel-treated population. These data also confirmed the potential effects 
of LDC and/or bridging chemotherapy on the exhaustion of the bone marrow reserve. 
Relapses occur often in the setting of tumour cell loss of target antigen expression. Tumours without 
antigen expression might elicit lower stimulation and expansion of CAR-T and consequently less toxicity. 
On the other hand, high antigen expression, in combination with high tumour burden, might result in 
high toxicity.  From the data available, CD19 expression levels did not seem to impact the liso-cel safety 
profile. CD19 loss after treatment with liso-cel seems not identified as a clear escape mechanism to liso-
cel. In detail, of the 3 subjects with available CD19 H-scores at both baseline and progressive disease, 
1 subject had a decrease in CD19 H-score at progression and 2 subjects had an increase in CD19 H-
score at progression. Finally, although tumour burden was associated with higher incidence of CRS and 
iiNT, CD19 H-score did not correlate with tumour burden as assessed by LDH and SPD. The long-term 
follow-up study GC-LTFU-001 should allow for the collection of information on the occurrences of loss of 
target antigen in cases of relapses.   
All but 5 subjects (98.6%) had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 at Screening. The relatively small 
number of subjects who had an ECOG performance status 2 is not sufficient for a meaningful comparison 
with the population with an ECOG status 0-1 at this time (see also efficacy section).  
The median administered dose of JCAR017 in the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set (n= 349) was 90.8 × 106 CAR+ 
viable T cells (range, 37 × 106 to 203 × 106). It should be noted that, while the subjects received the 
expected  doses  based  on  the  release  criteria  at  the  time  in  a  tight  range,  the  administered  doses 
represented  a  range  of  doses  within  each  assigned  dose  regimen.  In  addition,  in  Study  017001,  the 
median CD4+:CD8+ cell components ratio showed a wider range than the range reported in Study BCM-
001,  which  could  influence  the  safety  profile  in  patients  receiving  a  product  in  which  the  median 
CD4+:CD8+  cell  components  ratio  is  not  1:1  but  where  one  cell  component  prevails  over  another. 
However, logistic regression analysis, performed to evaluate the relationship between CD4+:CD8+ cell 
components  ratio  and  the  probability  of  CRS  and  iiNT,  indicated  that  there  was  no  clear  relationship 
between CD4+:CD8+ cell components ratio and the incidence of these AESIs. In both 017001 DLBCL 
JCAR017-treated dataset and dataset corresponding to DL2S, the cumulative incidence of AESIs reached 
40-50 percent by three months followed by plateau, regardless of CD4+:CD8+ cell components ratio (in 
both 0.8-1.2 and > 1.2 CD4+:CD8+ cell components ratio groups). iiNT cumulative incidence reached 
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022  
Page 223/252 
 
 
 
approximatively  30%  by  3  months  followed  by  a  plateau.  Hypogammaglobulinaemia  reached 
approximatively  20%  by  3  months  and  it  appeared  that  cases  occurred  throughout  the  360  days  of 
follow-up,  particularly  for  0.8-1.2  CD4+:CD8+  group.  Similarly,  for  anaemia,  neutropenia,  and 
thrombocytopenia,  the  cumulative  incidence  reached  a  plateau  at  3  months.  For  Grade  3  and  above 
infections, although the cumulative incidence was higher in the first 3 months, a plateau was not reached 
for 0.8-1.2 CD4+:CD8+ cell components ratio at this timepoint. Grade 3 and above infections continued 
to  accrue  after  the  first  3  months  in  0.8-1.2  CD4+:CD8+  cell  components  ratio  group  and 
hypogammaglobulinaemia  followed  a  similar  pattern  as  Grade  3  and  above  infections.  Notably,  the 
cumulative  incidence  for  SPM  continued  to  increase  throughout  the  360  days  of  follow-up  for  the 
subgroup of patients with CD4+:CD8+ cell components ratio > 1.2, although the numbers of patients at 
risk were low.  
In the PASS JCAR017-BCM-005, as primary safety endpoints, secondary malignancies and infections will 
be evaluated in patients treated with commercially available liso-cel from the Center for International 
Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) and from the European Society for Blood and Marrow 
Transplantation (EBMT) registries. Aetiology of the infection will be recorded (using SOCs and PTs,), and 
a  small  proportion  of  the  infections  is  expected  to  remain  unspecified  or  unknown.  Post-marketing 
cumulative data will be reported (in PSURs) by high-level group terms (aetiology groups) and separately 
for opportunistic infections, as available. Although only serious infections (requiring treatment) will be 
reported, this is considered acceptable.  
A numerically higher incidence of all-grade CRS, all-grade iiNT, and Grade ≥ 3 infection was observed at 
assigned DL3S (150 x 106 CAR+ T cells) when compared with lower assigned DLs (017001 CSR); this is 
consistent with the results from a retrospective logistic regression modelling (017001 DOVER). Data in 
SmPC Sections 5.1 and 4.8 reflects the entire clinical experience of CD4+:CD8+ cell components ratios 
(ratio  range  0.7  to  2.2)  that  were  administered  in the  recommended  dose  range  of  44  to  120  ×  106 
CAR+ T cells. However, in the post marketing setting, a CD4+:CD8+ cell components ratio equal to 1:1 
with a range of 0.8 to 1.2 will be recommend, to minimise variance in clinical outcomes and standardise 
the  contribution  of  each  cell  component.  Because  of  manufacturing  controls,  it  is  anticipated  that the 
majority  of  patients  treated  with liso-cel in the  post-marketing  setting  will  receive  a  CD4+:CD8+  cell 
components ratio of 1:1 (range 0.8-1.2). In rare cases, it may be possible that some patients will receive 
product outside of this ratio range, such as patients who receive out-of-specification lots with respect to 
the target CD4+:CD8+ cell components ratio. Therefore, the applicant is recommended to collect data 
on the numbers of effectively administered CD4+, CD8+ and CD4+:CD8+ cell components ratio in the 
JCAR017-BCM-005 study.  
Based on data as of 19 Jun 2020, with additional follow-up increased from 9.17 to 10.74 months for the 
Pooled  3L+  DLBCL  Set  and  from  2.40  to  6.36  months  for  the  Study  BCM-001  Cohort  1,  no  clinically 
important  changes  in  the  type,  frequency,  or  severity  of  any  AEs  were  observed,  and  no  new  safety 
concerns  were  identified.  No  clear  difference  was  noted  in  on-study  AE  rates  during  the  treatment-
emergent  period  (90  days)  and  posttreatment-emergent  period  (2  years)  when  adjusted  for  longer 
duration of follow-up. 
Within the observed AEs,  some can be directly linked to the conditioning chemotherapy (cytopenias), 
and other AEs are directly linked to the administration of Breyanzi. The AEs described here are in line 
with the AEs of CAR T cell products and are a direct consequence of the mode of action of this product. 
No additional concerns can be identified which would be specific for Breyanzi or for the indication to be 
treated with Breyanzi. No apparent differences in safety outcomes were observed between Studies BCM-
001, BCM-002, 017007 and 017001. For some less common large B-cell lymphoma subtypes, including 
R/R FL3B and R/R PMBCL, as well as for other clinically relevant subgroups (ECOG PS ≥ 2, secondary 
CNS  lymphoma,  DLBCL  post-allo  HSCT)  the  evidence  is  limited  due  to  the  small  number  of  patients 
included. However, overall, the observed JCAR017 safety seems to be consistent across all subgroups.

No clear differences were noted in the frequencies or types of TEAEs in the subset of subjects treated 
with  DL2S  v4  compared  with  those  for  the  total  017001  DLBCL  Treated  Set,  although  TEAEs  were 
reported most frequently in the SOC of General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (78.6%) 
rather than Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders (75.4%) in subjects treated with DL2S v4.  
It should be noted that, in Study BCM-001 Cohort 1, Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs in the Blood and Lymphatic System 
Disorders SOC were observed in a higher percentage of subjects compared with the Pooled 3L+DLBCL 
Set (92.6% versus 74.5%), probably related to the higher percentage of subjects receiving anticancer 
therapy  for  disease  control  in  Study  BCM-001  Cohort  1  compared  to  Study  017001  (77.8%  versus 
59.1%).  
Of note, during the post-treatment-emergent period, in Study BCM-002, the percentages of subjects 
with AEs in the post-treatment-emergent period (21 out of 22 subjects, 95.5%) were generally higher 
compared  with  the  Pooled  3L+  DLBCL  Set  (45.4%)  but,  considering  the  small  number  of  enrolled 
patients, as the post-treatment-emergent AEs in Study BCM-002 occurred in the setting of combination 
therapy, it is hard to find a relationship of these AEs with the only JCAR017. 
Of  note,  in  the  Pooled  3L+  DLBCL  Set  and  concerning  treatment-emergent  SAEs,  the  majority  of 
subjects in Study 017007 were monitored as outpatients following JCAR017 administration, whereas all 
(Study BCM-001) or almost all (Study 017001) subjects were monitored as inpatients in the other trials. 
This could suggest a concern for the use of JCAR017 in the outpatients setting. The data provided by the 
applicant indicated that the majority of treatment-emergent SAEs of CRS and tremor were low grade, 
suggesting that required admission to hospital (thereby becoming a SAE) was implemented, in part, to 
facilitate  careful  observation.  Therefore,  hospitalisation  was  the  defining  event  of  these  SAEs,  rather 
than the nature of the AE itself. It has also been clarified that there was no under-reporting of longer-
term AEs, as the long-term surveillance schedule and AE reporting requirements in Study 017007 were 
the same as in Study 017001, and were identical for subjects monitored in the inpatient and outpatient 
setting. 
Of the 269 subjects in the 017001 DLBCL Treated Set, 33 subjects (12.3%) were admitted to the ICU 
at  any  time  during  the  study;  the  median  number  of  ICU  days  was  8.0  (range  1  to  56  days).    The 
applicant provided more information about the AEs that led to ICU admission in the inpatient setting and 
in the outpatient setting. Of note, only Study 017001 permitted outpatient monitoring following infusion 
on Day 1 to Day 29 at the discretion of the treating physician, and twenty-five subjects from the 017001 
DLBCL Treated Set were monitored as outpatients. As of the 19 Jun 2020 data cut-off date, out of 38 
third-line or later (3L+) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) subjects with intensive care unit (ICU) 
admissions from studies 017001 and BCM-001, 37 subjects were monitored as inpatients (33 patients 
from  Study  017001  and  4  patients  from  Study  BCM-001)  and  1  subject  (from  Study  017001)  was 
monitored as an outpatient following liso-cel infusion. Reasons for ICU admission were most often due 
to CRS (CRS; 10 subjects) and/or neurological AEs (11 subjects); 4 patients had infection, and 4 subjects 
had hypotension. The only (1) outpatient subject admitted to the ICU had CRS. 
Overall, the proportions of liso-cel-treated subjects in the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set who have died across 
the 3 regions of the US, Europe, and Japan were similar. The primary cause of death category for most 
subjects with adverse events (AEs) ongoing at the time of death was lymphoma disease progression. 
Based on the totality of JCAR017 safety observations to date and the safety profiles recognised within 
the class of CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapeutics, the following AESIs were identified: 
Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) 
Across the pooled dataset, a total of 145 of 349 subjects (41.5%) experienced CRS of any grade and very 
few of these events were Grade ≥ 3 (8 out of 349 subjects; 2.3%). The onset of CRS was generally within 
the first week of JCAR017 treatment (median time to onset 5.0 days [range 1 to 14 days] and the median 
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022  
Page 225/252 
 
 
 
time to resolution was 5.0 days [range 1 to 17 days]. The 3 most frequently occurring symptoms of CRS in 
the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set were pyrexia (93.1%), hypotension (44.1%), and tachycardia (35.9%). There were 
no Grade 5 CRS symptoms. These results were similar to those observed in the other datasets included in 
the  safety  analysis.  In  the  Pooled  3L+  DLBCL  Set,  19.8%  subjects  received  tocilizumab  and/or 
corticosteroids  and  11.2%  received  tocilizumab  only,  with  a  median  time  from  onset  of  CRS  to  first 
administration of tocilizumab of 1.5 days and a median number of doses of 1 (range 1 to 4 doses), most 
frequently  for  Grade  2  CRS.  At  the  Day  120  Safety  dataset,  a  total  of  148  out  of  359  subjects  (41.2%) 
experienced CRS of any grade and 8 out of 359 subjects (2.2%) were with Grade ≥ 3. 
Neurologic Toxicities 
Serious neurologic events, including cerebral oedema and seizures, observed in clinical studies’ 
subjects treated with Breyanzi, have been generally manageable and reversible with supportive care 
measures, corticosteroids, and, in the setting of CRS, with tocilizumab.  
Because some concomitant medications (e.g., tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids) were given for both 
CRS and iiNT, the number of subjects receiving tocilizumab or corticosteroids for a concurrent CRS 
event has be specified and the relevance of tocilizumab use in case of NT has be discussed. 
Tocilizumab use in subjects with iiNT and concurrent CRS in the liso-cel studies was consistent with the 
protocol-specified guidance regarding the treatment and management of NT and CRS. It was also 
consistent with the literature (Neelapu, 2019; Rivera, 2020; Santomasso, 2019) and the 
recommendations in the product label for one of the approved chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell 
therapeutics (Yescarta® Summary of Product Characteristics). For subjects with NT, tocilizumab is 
recommended only in the setting of concurrent CRS or macrophage activation system 
(MAS)/haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Exploratory analyses of the potential impact of 
tocilizumab and corticosteroid use on Breyanzi activity seem not to show differences between the 
group of subjects that received treatment and the group that did not. However, the results from the 
planned study analysis showed that subjects who experienced higher grade CRS or iiNT were more 
likely to be treated and treated earlier than subjects who experienced lower grade CRS or iiNT. This is 
an expected result based on the protocol treatment algorithm. Of the 26 subjects with maximum 
Grade 1 iiNT, 5 patients were treated with corticosteroid for iiNT. None of these Grade 1 events 
occurred early (< 72 hours) but all 5 subjects experienced aphasia with/without encephalopathy, which 
are considered to be hallmarks of CAR T-cell-associated NT. Furthermore, prior to or concurrent with 
iiNT, all 5 subjects experienced CRS, for which they received tocilizumab, and 2 received 
corticosteroids for treating CRS. For this reason, the recommendation for early intervention with 
corticosteroids and/or tocilizumab for CRS and iiNT, at the discretion of the prescriber, to prevent the 
development of severe events can be approvable. 
In the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set, the incidence of TEAEs from the ND/PD SOC was 248 out of 349 
subjects (71.1%). The 3 most frequent NESI categories were headache (95 out of 349 subjects; 
27.2%); encephalopathy (91 out of 349 subjects; 26.1%); and dizziness (72 out of 349 subjects; 
20.6%).  
In order to explore whether there were biologic correlations differentiating subjects with iiNT events 
versus subjects with ND/PD SOC events that were “not iiNT” and versus subjects with “no ND/PD 
SOC”, PK parameters and inflammatory biomarkers were compared. Subjects with all-grade iiNT had 
higher JCAR017 median maximum observed concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-
time curve through 28 days after the first infusion (AUC0-28) than subjects with “not iiNT”. Similar to 
PK, the median values of CRP at baseline were significantly higher for subjects with iiNT as compared 
with those with “not iiNT” and “no ND/PD SOC” events (p= 0.0027 and p= 0.0001, respectively). No 
statistical difference was observed in the CRP median baseline between subjects with “not iiNT” events 
and those with “no ND/PD SOC events”, although the CRP peak median was 1.80-fold greater in “not 
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022  
Page 226/252 
 
 
 
iiNT” than “no ND/PD SOC” (p = 0.0283). These results suggest that differences in baseline and post-
JCAR017 biology might influence the occurrence of a neurological event in “iiNT” subjects but did not 
explain the occurrence of a neurological event in “not iiNT” subjects, who also had ND/PD SOC events 
not identified as iiNT. Of note, impairment of the central nervous system function is also part of CRS. 
Therefore, there may be some overlap of CNS impairment following CRS and CNS impairment for other 
causes. Evidence have been provided that “non-iiNT” events were distinct from CAR T cell-associated 
neurotoxicity and were not explained by CAR T cell expansion and inflammatory biomarkers. The 
majority of “non-iiNT” events were low grade and were all suspected by the Investigator to be due to 
aetiologies other than iiNT, such as disease progression, other documented CNS pathology, orthostatic 
hypotension, infection or concomitant medication (e.g., fludarabine). Finally, the most frequent 
symptoms were those considered to be nonspecific for CAR T-cell-associated neurotoxicity (i.e., NESI 
categories of headache, dizziness, insomnia, and anxiety). In conclusion, the iiNT method used in the 
liso-cel clinical trials can be considered an accurate reflection of CAR T-cell-associated neurotoxicity in 
these patients. Seizures and cerebral oedema have also occurred in patients treated with JCAR017. A 
single event of Grade 2 cerebral oedema confined to the right temporal lobe was reported in a subject 
who was later determined to have DLBCL involvement of the CNS. At the moment, a potential role of 
Breyanzi in the cerebral oedema in this patient cannot be ruled out. It is acknowledged that the 
potential for cerebral oedema warrants representation in product labels of all approved CAR T-cell 
agents and has been included in the SmPC in the relevant sections.  Seven out of 269 subjects in 
Study 017001 had secondary CNS involvement by lymphoma at the time of JCAR017 treatment. Two 
of the 7 subjects with secondary CNS involvement (28.6%) had iiNT, representing a similar incidence 
to that among subjects without secondary CNS involvement (29.8%).  Reference in the SmPC in 
section 5.1 and 4.4 is supported.    
Prolonged Cytopenias 
Cytopenias are not unexpected in this clinical setting. This was observed in Study 017001 as well as in 
Study BCM-001, despite some variation (e.g., in Study BCM-001 the prevalence of Grade 3 or 4 
thrombocytopenia at Day 365 (25.0%) was higher than in Study 017001 (16.7% at Day 270; 0% at 
Day 365). This may be explained in part by a small number of subjects in Study 017001 who had 
samples collected compared to sample collection from all active subjects in Study BCM-001 through 
Day 365 visit.  
Finally, no clinically meaningful differences (≥20%) were observed in the baseline characteristics 
(including prior HSCT) of subjects with prolonged cytopenia compared with subjects without prolonged 
cytopenia and subjects in the overall population. There were no clinically meaningful differences in the 
incidence and severity of CRS, or in treatments administered for CRS. No clinically meaningful 
differences were noted between resolution of prolonged cytopenia and exposure to lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy, liso-cel, or treatment for CRS with tocilizumab or corticosteroids. 
Infections 
Grade 5 infections were reported in 8 subjects and included progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML; 2 subjects), septic shock (2 subjects), candida sepsis, pneumonia, sepsis, 
and staphylococcal sepsis (1 subject each). The results of the subgroup analyses of infections any time 
after liso-cel infusion are consistent with the fact that i) prior to receiving liso-cel, most subjects in the 
Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set had at least 1 risk factor for infection, including laboratory-based 
hypogammaglobulinaemia; ii) hypogammaglobulinaemia (designated as an AE) appeared to more 
accurately predict the risk of infection than did IgG levels; iii) the IgG level after infusion was not a 
clinically meaningful way to identify subjects at risk of infection, as exemplified by the similar 
proportions of subjects with infections independent of IgG level (44.7% and 43.7% with Ig G level < 
500 mg/dL and ≥ 500 mg/dL, respectively) and the greater proportion of subjects with Grade 5 
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022  
Page 227/252 
 
 
 
infections in the IgG ≥ 500 mg/dL subgroup. Finally, of 359 subjects in the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set, 15 
(4.2%) subjects were identified as having opportunistic infections and the most frequently reported 
opportunistic infection was cytomegalovirus infection (6 subjects), followed by candida sepsis, 
bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and PML (in 2 subjects). One event of candida sepsis and both PML 
events were fatal. The SmPC has been updated accordingly to the presented data.  
Regarding patients with HCV or hepatitis B, a total of 12 out of 359 (3.3%) subjects (11 in Study 
017001 and 1 in Study 017007) had pre-infusion hepatitis B in the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Treated Set (ten 
hepatitis B subjects received antiviral suppressive therapy with lamivudine or entecavir and 1 subject 
had latent hepatitis B without antiviral suppression in Study 017001). A total of 2 subjects had a 
history of hepatitis C with no active infection at the time of liso-cel administration in Study 017001, 
and none were associated with reports of hepatitis C infection following infusion. Based on these 
findings, the BCM-001 study protocol was recently amended to allow enrolment of subjects who are 
PCR-negative for HBV and HCV viral load. These data suggest that, with patient selection and careful 
management, patients with a history of hepatitis B or hepatitis C, but not currently active, can be 
safely treated for 3L+ DLBCL without hepatitis reactivation, in line with recent published data (Rui Cui 
et al, Hematol Oncol 2021). However, the applicant also clarified that the contract manufacturing 
facility at Cellex (Germany) is not currently accepting leukapheresis material from patients testing 
positive for HBV or HVC indicating active infection or from patients testing positive for HIV. This 
statement is now reported in sections 4.4 and 4.2 of the SmPC. 
B-cell aplasia  
B-cell aplasia was evident at baseline in 92% of subjects (241 out of 262) of the 017001 DLBCL 
Treated Set. Consistent with transgene persistence, B-cell aplasia was observed in 98% of subjects 
(240 out of 244) on Day 29, 93% of subjects (153 out of 165) on Day 90, 86% of subjects (100 out of 
116) on Day 180, and 73% of subjects (51 out of 70) on Day 365. Similarly, subjects in Study BCM-
001 (Cohort 1) exhibited a high rate of B-cell aplasia ranging from 100% on Day 29 (n= 23) and Day 
90 (n= 10), 86% (6 out of 7 subjects) on Day 180, and 75% (3 out of 4 subjects) on Day 270. Data 
are limited after Day 90 due to the median on-study follow-up time of 3.02 months in this analysis. 
However, given the similar effects of rituximab on B cells and the widespread use of rituximab in 
DLBCL, the role of B cell aplasia as a marker of persistence of CD19-directed CAR T cell therapy in 
DLBCL is less certain. B-cell aplasia can be adequately managed by immunoglobulin replacement 
therapy (Maude et al 2014).  
EGFRt switch-off system 
Specific hypothetical clinical conditions where the use of this switch-off system would be possible are: 
i) potential clonal T-cell proliferation derived from liso-cel (EGFRt positive [EGFRt+] autonomous T-cell 
growth); ii) hypothetical tumour cell transduction and amplification giving rise to an EGFRt expressing 
malignancy; iii) autoimmune reactions related to liso-cel; iv) B-cell aplasia and symptomatic 
hypogammaglobulinaemia with recurrent infections (on-target off-tumour adverse events) despite 
adequate supportive therapy. Finally, EGFRt-mediated CAR T-cell ablation could hypothetically be used 
to treat novel and yet unknown CAR T-cell-mediated adverse effects. Based on current thinking and 
state of knowledge, the proposed EGFRt-mediated CAR T-cell ablation is only intended for exceptional 
use (i.e., in life-threatening conditions or chronic toxicities that are not manageable by standard 
therapies and following individual benefit/risk evaluations, including the risks associated with 
cetuximab, panitumumab, or necitumumab). Further data on such exceptional use could become 
available from ongoing clinical trials in case the protocols allow this option for investigators 
accordingly. In addition, the applicant clarifies that this is unlikely to be used in subjects with a 
complete response duration of less than 2 years.

About the absence of the expected impact of treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors on non-
functional EGFRt+ in liso-cel, while only the extracellular domain of the EGFRt (and not the signaling 
intracellular domain) is expressed on liso-cel cells surface, small molecule kinase inhibitors might have 
non-specific activity on the immune system and, as most antineoplastic agents, they have theoretically 
a potential to interfere with CAR T-cell activity. 
No subject in the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set developed autoimmune disorders. 
During CRS, it is expected that Breyanzi-associated coagulopathy with severe hypofibrinogenaemia is 
observed. As for other CAR-T products, patients with Grade 4 CRS generally had a lower median 
fibrinogen level compared with CRS Grade of 1-3 (Maude SL et al. N Engl J Med 2014;371:1507–17). 
In addition, venous thromboembolism developed in 11% of lymphoma patients after CAR T-cell 
therapy (Hashmi H et al. Blood Adv 2020;4(17):4086-4090). At the cut-off date of 19 Jun 2020, of the 
359 subjects in the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Treated Set, 7 subjects (1.9%) reported the TEAE of 
hypofibrinogenaemia (PT) and 2 subjects (0.6%) reported blood fibrinogen decreased (PT). While the 
median lowest fibrinogen levels were lower in subjects with Grade 4 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) 
compared with subjects with Grades 1 to 3 CRS, only a single subject with Grade 4 CRS experienced 
an adverse event (AE) of hypofibrinogenaemia that was Grade 3 in severity. No subjects with Grade 4 
CRS experienced Grade 4 or 5 hypofibrinogenaemia in the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set. However, no firm 
conclusion can be drawn due to the low number of patients with Grade 4 CRS. Few patients received 
specific treatment for hypofibrinogenaemia and there were no treatment-emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) among subjects in the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL 
Treated Set. The overall incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) reported in the Pooled 3L+ 
DLBCL Treated Set (5.8%) is lower than that previously reported in lymphoma patients receiving 
CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy (11%) or in newly diagnosed patients with DLBCL (10% to 13%) and 
is similar to that reported following ASCT (4%). All 13 subjects with CRS who experienced a treatment-
emergent VTE had multiple identified risk factors for VTE, including 5 subjects with a prior medical 
history of VTE or a pre-existing event of VTE at the time of liso-cel administration. However, none of 
the liso-cel-treated subjects with VTE and CRS had Grade ≥ 3 CRS, which has previously been reported 
as potentially associated with VTE following CAR T-cell therapy. All 8 subjects who had treatment-
emergent VTE events and did not experience CRS had multiple identified risk factors for VTE, including 
5 subjects with a prior medical history of VTE or an ongoing event of VTE at the time of liso-cel 
administration. Based on updated pooled study data, hypofibrinogenaemia and thrombosis have been 
added as a common AEs in the SmPC. The applicant will continue to closely monitor and report on 
additional information on the occurrence of CRS and any associated events (including DVT and PE 
rates) as collected through ongoing clinical studies and post marketing surveillance.  
On the immunogenicity, no apparent relationship between pre-existent ATAs (anti therapeutic 
antibodies) or treatment-induced/boosted ATAs and AESI was observed, but the data are currently 
very limited. 
From the safety analysis of the subgroups, it emerged that: 
•  No clinically relevant differences were noted between sex, race, or ethnicity subgroups for 
subjects treated with JCAR017 in the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set. 
•  A numerical increase in the proportion of subjects ≥ 75 years with iiNT compared with 
those < 75 years of age (36.8% versus 26.4%, respectively) was noted in the Pooled 3L+ 
DLBCL Set and may reflect the elderly being at increased risk of neurologic AEs, but given 
the small numbers of elderly subjects, no firm conclusion can be drawn. 
•  Higher rates of all-grade CRS and/or iiNT were observed in subjects who at baseline had 
greater tumour burden (higher SPD and/or LDH), greater inflammatory state (higher CRP), 
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022  
Page 229/252 
 
 
 
or use of anticancer therapy for disease control prior to LDC. These subjects represent the 
patient’s categories that may be at higher risk of CRS and should be monitored closely. 
This statement has been reported in the SmPC. 
•  Similar rates of iiNT were observed among subjects with and without secondary CNS 
involvement (28.6% and 29.8%, respectively), but given the small numbers of subjects 
with secondary CNS involvement, no firm conclusion can be drawn at the moment.  
• 
The rates of overall TEAEs and AESIs (CRS and/or iiNT) were similar for subjects with ALC 
< 0.3 × 109/L prior to leukapheresis and those with ALC ≥ 0.3 × 109/L prior to 
leukapheresis, with the exception of higher rates of Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia in 
subjects with ALC < 0.3 × 109/L.  
•  Based on the data submitted, no clear differences were observed in the safety profile of 
subjects who received prior HSCT (both auto-HSCT and allo-HSCT), versus those who did 
not. Regarding GVHD, there is a theoretical risk of CAR T cell therapy inducing or 
aggravating pre-existing GVHD in subjects with prior allo-HSCT. The data provided support 
this evidence, with the absence of acute GVHD from liso-cel trial and the low incidence of 
GVHD after liso-cel (only 2 chronic GVHD AEs out of 9 liso-cel treated subjects who had 
previously undergone prior allo-HSCT). On that basis, subjects with active acute or chronic 
GVHD were excluded from liso-cel clinical trials, and subjects had to be at least 3 months 
post allo-HSCT and clinically stable prior to apheresis (as reported in section 4.4 of the 
SmPC).  
• 
In Study 017001, safety was generally similar in subjects with clinically significant 
comorbidities of reduced CrCl and reduced cardiac ejection fraction, except for higher rates 
of Grade ≥ 3 anaemia in subjects with CrCl < 60 mL/min. This is expected because 
anaemia is an important complication experienced by patients with chronic kidney disease. 
•  A total of 31 subjects (25 subjects in the 017001 DLBCL Cohort and 6 subjects in Study 
BCM-001 Cohorts 1 + 3) received a nonconforming product. The overall frequencies of 
TEAEs, Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs, and AESIs were similar to those treated with JCAR017 in the 
017001 DLBCL Treated Set, indicating no apparent relationships between a nonconforming 
product and the treatment-emergent categories of AEs examined.  
•  Based on the available data from Study 017001, no significant differences in safety 
outcomes have been observed across JCAR017 process versions and vector manufacturing 
sites. The small sample size of subjects who received the product derived from the 
commercial version of the vector (n=7 in Study BCM-001 Cohort 1) precludes definitive 
conclusions with respect to the subjects who received the product from vector 
manufactured as v.1.0. However, preliminary data suggest that there were no clear 
differences in the rates of AESI among the three different vector subgroups (v1.0, v1.2 and 
commercial version respectively). 
Comparisons of Therapies Approved for 3L+ Large B-cell Lymphoma 
With the limits of indirect comparison, safety data from JCAR017, axicabtagene ciloleucel (Neelapu, 
2017), and tisagenlecleucel (Schuster, 2019) reveals that JCAR017 is associated with a numerically 
lower rate of both all-grade CRS and high-grade (Grade ≥ 3) CRS relative to axicabtagene ciloleucel 
and tisagenlecleucel. In addition, a numerically lower rate of NT adverse events (particularly events of 
higher severity) and Grade 5 AEs was observed with JCAR017 compared with axicabtagene ciloleucel. 
These findings are of interest, especially because they should be considered in the context of the more 
inclusive Study 017001 subject population. Without a formal comparison across the clinical studies 
with the approved products for 3L+ large B-cell lymphoma, in the absence of 1) randomised trial

comparisons, or 2) patient-level data from the clinical trials for patient-level meta-analysis accounting 
for differences in baseline and disease characteristics, study designs, CAR constructs, and follow-up 
times, no definitive conclusion can be drawn. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
With respect to safety, the toxicity profile of JCAR017 is in line with the known safety of anti-CD19 CAR 
T-cell products. The important identified risks and the potential risks identified for Breyanzi are similar 
to those identified for this product class. Adverse events of CRS and NT were generally low-grade and 
resolved. Importantly, low rate of ≥ Grade 3 CRS occurred in the context of overall use of tocilizumab 
and/or corticosteroid in less than one-quarter of all patients treated with JCAR017. Despite evidence is 
limited for some less common large B-cell lymphoma subtypes including R/R FL3B and R/R PMBCL, as 
well as for other clinically relevant subgroups (ECOG PS ≥2; secondary CNS lymphoma; DLBCL post-allo 
HSCT) due to the small number of patients included, overall the JCAR017 activity seems to be consistent 
across these subgroups. Data from study BCM-001 are considered of particular relevance for EU patients, 
due  to  the  same  manufacturing  process  as  proposed  for  commercial  use  in  the  EU.    When  additional 
patients  have  been  enrolled  in  Study  BCM-001  (n=  36,  Cohort  1),  more  comparable  baseline 
characteristics have been observed across the pivotal studies. Overall, the incidence of AEs and AESIs 
in the treatment-emergent (Day 1 to Day 90) and post-treatment emergent (Day 91 to end of Study) 
periods  was  generally  similar,  despite  higher  Grade  ≥  3  liso-cel-related  TEAEs  in  Study  BCM-001 
compared with Study 017001, mainly driven by higher incidences of neutropenia, anaemia and febrile 
neutropenia and no notable difference in the incidence of individual AESIs. 
The  data  presented  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  (SmPC)  reflect  the  entire  clinical 
experience  at  the  recommended  dose  range  (assigned  DL1+DL2).  A  non-interventional  post-
authorisation safety study (PASS) based on a registry is planned to assess the safety profile of JCAR017 
to treat patients with R/R DLBCL, PMBCL and FL3B lymphoma in the post marketing setting (JCAR017 
BCM-005).  
The CAT considers the following measures necessary to monitor and investigate in post-marketing 
settings issues related to safety: 
Imposed PASS: 
Non-interventional post-authorisation safety study (PASS) JCAR017 BCM-005: In order to further 
characterise the long-term safety and efficacy of Breyanzi in adult patients with relapsed or refractory 
DLBCL, PMBCL, FL3B after two or more lines of systemic therapy the MAH shall conduct and submit the 
results of a prospective study based on data from a registry, according to an agreed protocol. Interim 
reports to be submitted in accordance with the RMP. Final report: Q3-2043 
Required studies (Cat 3 in the Pharmacovigilance Plan in the RMP): 
Long-term Follow-up Study (Study GC-LTFU-001):  Long-term follow-up of safety and efficacy for all 
paediatric and adult subjects exposed to the product clinical trials. A 15 years follow-up is included for 
these patients. 
Transgene assay service testing of secondary malignancies with insertion site analysis: In Study GC-
LTFU-001, testing for liso-cel transgene will be conducted on all secondary malignancies where tissue 
is available. A structured secondary malignancy CRF will be employed to characterise all new 
malignancy reports by dates of liso-cel treatment and new malignancy onset, time to onset, stage, 
history of prior malignancies, previous cancer therapies, prior radiotherapy, other relevant exposures,

family history, and biopsy report. Treatments for the secondary malignancy and clinical outcomes will 
also be collected. Transgene testing will be conducted for all reported secondary malignancies of 
suspected T cell origin where a tissue sample is available. 
Although reasons for pre-infusion treatment failure will not be collected as part of the imposed PASS, 
since registries only collect data on patients who receive JCAR017, data collected in the applicant’s 
manufacturing database will be provided post-approval to further investigate the reasons for early 
treatment failures. The applicant committed to provide all available information on the rate and 
reasons for Breyanzi manufacturing failures that occur in the post-approval setting in the periodic 
safety update reports (PSURs). 
In addition, the CAT recommended the following point for consideration: 
• 
The applicant is recommended to collect data on the numbers of effectively administered 
CD4+, CD8+ and CD4+:CD8+ cell components ratio in the JCAR017-BCM-005 study.  
The CHMP endorses the CAT conclusion on clinical safety as described above.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance  
2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP and CAT considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant 
fulfils the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 5 February 2021. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Breyanzi (lisocabtagene maraleucel) is 
included in the additional monitoring list as: 
• 
It contains new active substances which, on 1 January 2011, were not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU; 
• 
It has a PASS imposed either at the time of authorisation or afterwards.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Breyanzi is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma (DLBCL), primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) and follicular lymphoma 
grade 3B (FL3B), after two or more lines of systemic therapy.  
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022  
Page 238/252 
 
 
 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Most patients with aggressive mature B-cell lymphomas, including DLBCL, PMBCL and FL3B, are able 
to achieve long-term disease control/cure with frontline immunochemotherapy (e.g., R-CHOP), yet 
30% to 40% still experience relapse or are refractory to treatment. The long-accepted standard in this 
setting was non-cross-resistant salvage immunochemotherapy to (re-)induce remission followed, in 
younger and fit patients, by high dose chemotherapy (HDCT) and autologous stem cell transplant 
(ASCT). Approximately 50% of patients who receive ASCT eventually achieve long-lasting disease 
control. A higher unmet medical need can be recognised, however, for patients who fail salvage 
chemotherapy or ASCT.  
Recently, novel agents have been approved for the treatment of patients with r/r large B-cell 
lymphomas who have not benefited from standard immunochemotherapy +/- ASCT, namely the anti-
CD19 CAR T-cell advanced medicinal products Yescarta (KTE-C19) and Kymriah (CTL019) and the anti-
CD79b MMAE-conjugated monoclonal antibody polatuzumab vedotin. Treatment with CARTs, in 
particular, resulted in long-lasting remissions in up to 30% to 50% of subjects, setting a new efficacy 
threshold in such advanced setting of disease, although at the cost of a non-negligible toxicity. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pivotal clinical data to support the MAA of Breyanzi (JCAR017) in the target indication mainly come 
from two open-label uncontrolled studies: Study 017001 and study BCM-001 as described above. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Study 017001 
At the most recent data cut-off date of 04 Jan 2021, the ITT-set (leukapheresed set) of study 017001 
included 298 patients which were treated with the recommended dose rage of 44 - 120 × 106 CAR+ 
viable T cells, from which 216 were included in the efficacy set with IRC assessment. At this cut-off date, 
ORR was 60.1% (95%CI 54.3, 65.7) and 72.7 % (95%CI 66.2, 78.5) and CRR was 43.0% (37.3, 48.8) 
and 53.2% (95%CI 46.4, 60.0) for the leukapheresed and the efficacy set respectively. With a median 
follow-up for DOR of 23.0 months, median DOR was 16.8 months (95%CI 8.0, NR) in the leukapheresis 
set and 20.2 months (95%CI 8.2, CR) in the efficacy set. PFS and OS data provided for contextualisation 
were  supportive,  with  K-M  plots  showing  a  plateau  phase  starting  approximately  from  month  12-18 
onwards, suggesting the possibility of long-term disease control in a subset of patients.  
Subgroup  analyses  in  study  017001  indicated  consistent  results  across  various  evaluable  subgroups 
including  target  lymphoma  subtypes.  In  this  regard,  particularly  favourable  results  were  observed  in 
patients  with  r/r  PMBCL  (ORR  79%  and  CRR  50%),  with  KM-plots  showing  a  high  rate  of  durable 
responses.  Moreover,  all  patients  with  r/r  FL3B  who  received  JCAR017  across  all  studies  achieved  CR 
with  JCAR017,  and  all  patients  were  alive  in  ongoing  remission  at  the  last  data  cut-off  date  (19  Jun 
2020), with one response lasting 23 months. 
Study BCM-001 
At the most recent data cut-off date of 04 Jan 2021, results from the primary analysis of the EU cohort 
(Cohort 1) of study BCM-001 (n=36) in infused patients showed an ORR by IRC of 61.1% (95%CI 43.5, 
76.9)  and  a  CRR  by  IRC  of  33.3%  (95%CI  18.6,  51.0).  Results  as  per  Investigator  assessment  were 
consistent with the primary analysis, and ORR and CRR by IRC in the ITT set (n=45) were 55.6% (95%CI 
43.5, 76.9) and 31.1% (95%CI 18.2, 46.6), respectively.  
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022  
Page 239/252 
 
 
 
 
With a shorter median follow-up compared to study 017001 (i.e. 11.37 months), median DOR in the EU 
cohort of study BCM-001 was 3.50 months (95%CI 2.20, 11.27; estimated 6-month DOR rate 40.9%). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Study design  
-  Studies  017001  and  BCM-001  were  single-arm,  open-label,  exploratory  trials,  and  the 
interpretation of time-to-event endpoints in the absence of proper control is difficult and prone 
to bias, since tumour-related variables such as growth rate cannot be properly accounted for.  
Relevance of efficacy analysis datasets 
-  While  the  main  efficacy  analyses  focused  on  the  patients  who  actually  received  infusion  with 
JCAR017 conforming product, 22-25% of patients who intended to be treated with JCAR017 and 
were leukapheresed in studies 017001 and BCM-001 did not eventually receive JCAR017, and 
among  those  16  and  6  patients  were  treated  with  nonconforming  products  in studies  017001 
and BCM-001, respectively. 
-  Overall, 58.6% and 75% of patients in studies 017001 and BCM-001 received bridging anticancer 
therapy after leukapheresis and prior to infusion. The possibility of a direct impact of bridging 
therapy on tumour microenvironment and CAR T-cell activity cannot be excluded at present. In 
this regard, subjects who needed bridging therapy for disease control in study 017001 (n=150) 
fared worse than patients who did not require additional treatments before JCAR017 infusion, 
with lower ORR and CRR (66.7% 44%, respectively) and shorter DoR, PFS and OS (9.1, 4.6 and 
13.3 months, respectively). Nonetheless, durable remissions could still be observed in subjects 
who needed bridging therapy. 
- 
Long-term  efficacy  data  with  JCAR017  are  currently  limited.  Further  data  will  be  provided  by 
more mature analyses from the Post-Authorisation Efficacy Studies 017001 and JCAR017-BCM- 
001. 
Differences in clinical outcomes from US study 017001 and EU study BCM-001 
-  A  clinically  relevant  difference  could  be  observed  in  the  duration  of  response  across  JCAR017 
studies, with subjects in US study 017001 faring better than EU patients in study BCM-001. The 
reasons behind the lower response rate and shorter response duration observed in phase II study 
BCM-001 are not completely understood, although limited numbers do not exclude the possibility 
of random findings. Post-approval data from the imposed non interventional studies (registry) 
will  provide  additional  information  for  patients  treated  in  the  EU  that  will  receive  commercial 
product  post-approval  (expected  subjects  in  the  EU  subset  of  PASS  study  JCAR017-BCM-005 
N=200).  
-  A  similar  fraction  of  subjects  (~14%)  was  excluded  from  trial  participation  due  to  screening 
failure in the two studies. Compared to study BCM-001, however, more subjects in study 017001 
(~20%) failed screening procedures due to issues in their ability to comply with study protocol. 
Although  this  difference  did  not  result  in  an  enrichment  in  physically  fitter  subjects  in the  US 
study, as demonstrated by the similar rates of subjects excluded because of ECOG PS score ≥2 
at screening in both studies (15.2% vs. 18.2% in study 017001 and BCM-001, respectively) and 
by the overall consistent patient characteristics in the ITT sets, the possibility of selection bias 
cannot be completely ruled out.

Additional uncertainties on treatment effect 
-  Sensitivity  efficacy  analyses  in  the  ITT  population  defined  by  leukapheresed  population  were 
conducted and showed inferior efficacy results in both studies, though ORR and CR rate in the 
study 017001 (n=344 ORR 60.5% [95% CI: 55.1, 65.7] and CRR 43.6% [95% CI: 38.3, 49.0]) 
were  still  statistically  significantly  higher  than  the  prespecified  benchmark  of  40%  and  20%, 
respectively. 
Efficacy in mature B-cell lymphoma subtypes  
- 
- 
The broad indication claimed by the applicant includes PMBCL, yet only 15 patients with PMBCL 
received JCAR017 in study 017001 and no patient with PMBCL was enrolled in study BCM-001. 
Limited  data  are  currently  available  in  patients  with  FL3B:  across  all  JCAR017  studies  only  8 
patients with r/r FL3B received JCAR017: 4 in study 017001, 2 in study BCM-001 and 2 in study 
BCM-002. Based on a review of histology reports, a diagnosis of “pure” FL3B, as per WHO criteria, 
could only be confirmed for 4 out of 6 subjects treated in studies 017001 and BCM-001, while a 
“composite” status could not be excluded for the remaining 2 subjects. A sample size of 4 or 6 
subjects  is,  per  se,  too  limited  for  specific  B/R  evaluations,  even  though promising  responses 
have been observed. Considering the rarity of this condition, limited additional data in FL3B can 
be expected from ongoing clinical trials and in the post-marketing setting; post-approval data 
will nonetheless be collected from the CIBMTR and EBMT registries (PASS BCM-005) to further 
characterise the efficacy and safety of JACR017 in this condition. 
-  A reduced efficacy was observed in DLBCL arising from indolent NHLs other than tFL (i.e. the tIL 
subset), which is a heterogenous group of aggressive lymphomas arising from different indolent 
conditions, 
including  CLL/SLL 
(i.e.  Richter’s 
syndrome,  RS)  and  Waldenstrom 
macroglobulinaemia (WM). Based on the available data, it is uncertain whether the anti-tumour 
activity of JCAR017 in RS/tWM, as observed in terms of ORR/CRR, can be translated in prolonged 
remission, which is the ultimate measure of clinical benefit is such advanced stages of disease. 
This  uncertainty  is  highlighted  in  the  SmPC,  specifying  that  although  durable  remissions  (i.e. 
DoR ≥12 months) have been observed in subjects with tFL and tMZL, the maximum duration of 
response in patients with RS and tWM in study 017001 was 2 months and 5 months, respectively. 
The B/R of JCAR017 in the rarer histologic subgroups cannot be characterised due to the limited 
sample size. 
JCAR017 fixed CD4+:CD8+ cell components ratio and manufacturing process 
- 
The  individual  contribution  of  the  CD4+  and  CD8+  cell  components  to  JCAR017  efficacy  is 
unclear, especially with regard to the clinical relevance of the CD4+ cell component in the anti-
tumour activity. In this regard, based on the limited experience with patients treated with non-
conforming  product  consisting  of  only  one  cell  component,  whether  differences  in  baseline 
patient/disease/immune cells characteristics could have contributed to the failure of one or both 
cell components is not clear and is recommended to be further investigated, including but not 
limited  to  low  absolute  peripheral  blood  counts  of  CD4+  and/or  CD8+  T-cell  or  phenotypic 
characteristics of these cells. The clinical relevance and potential impact of the defined 1:1 ratio 
on time-to-event endpoints at longer term are not fully characterised at present. Data on this 
uncertainty to be collected in the imposed PASS. 
-  Although  the  available  data  support  pooling  of  results  across  product  and  LVV  manufacturing 
process versions, clinical data with JCAR017 manufactured using the LVV in its final commercial 
version (n=7), for the EU patients, are currently limited. Further efficacy/safety data with the 
intended  commercial  product  and  vector  version  will  be  provided  post-approval  from  registry 
study  BCM-005  (in  which  at  least  1000  subjects  are  anticipated  to  receive  the  product

manufactured with this LVV) and from ongoing study BCM-001 (with 24 subjects anticipated to 
receive JCAR017 manufactured with this LVV). 
- 
The  evaluation  of  re-treatment  is  hampered  by  the  limited  available  data  and  no  clinically 
relevant activity has been observed. 
JCAR017 activity in relevant subgroups 
-  Overall, the interpretation of subgroup analyses (e.g. patient with renal and cardiac impairments) 
is  hampered  by  the  relatively  limited  sample  size,  especially  in  the  study  JCAR017-BCM-001. 
Efficacy  uncertainties  in  clinically  relevant  subgroups  will  be  further  investigated  in  the  post-
approval  setting,  in  LTFU  study  GC-LTFU-001,  in  registry  PASS  BCM-005  as  per  an  agreed 
protocol, and as recommended, from Study JCAR017-BCM-003. 
-  Clinical experience with JCAR017 in patients exposed to prior CD19-directed therapy is limited.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The  unfavourable  effects  for  patients  treated  with  Breyanzi  do  not  only  occur  as  a  consequence  of 
Breyanzi  treatment,  but  the  bridging  therapy  and  conditioning  chemotherapy  may  also  induce  such 
effects.  
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) 
Across the pooled dataset, a total of 145 out of 349 subjects (41.5%) experienced CRS of any grade and 
very few of these events were Grade ≥ 3 (8 out of 349 subjects; 2.3%). There were no Grade 5 events 
attributed to CRS. The median time to onset of CRS was 5 days (range: 1 to 14). As of the first data cut-
off date, CRS resolved in 141/145 subjects, with a median duration of 5 days (range: 1 to 17). 19.8% 
of all the subjects used tocilizumab and/or corticosteroid. At the Day 120 Safety dataset, a total of 148 
out of 359 subjects (41.2%) experienced CRS of any grade and 8 out of 359 subjects (2.2%) were with 
Grade ≥ 3. 
Neurologic Toxicity (NT) 
Serious  neurologic  events,  including  cerebral  oedema  and  seizures,  observed  in  subjects  enrolled  in 
clinical  studies  and  treated  with  Breyanzi,  have  generally  been  manageable  and  reversible  with 
supportive care measures, corticosteroids, and, in the setting of CRS,  with tocilizumab. In the Pooled 
3L+ DLBCL Set, all-grade iiNT was reported in 96 out of 349 subjects (27.5%). Events were Grade 3 or 
4 in 34 out of 349 subjects (9.7%) and were SAEs in 50 out of 349 subjects (14.3%). There were no 
Grade 5 events attributed to iiNT. The median time to onset of a neurologic event was 8.5 days (range: 
1 to 66) and iiNT events generally resolved in less than 2 weeks (median duration: 9 days, range: 1 to 
86).  Resolution  of  iiNT  occurred  within  4  weeks  of  onset  for  87.4%  of  the  subjects  in  the  Pooled 
3L+DLBCL  Set  who  had  resolution  as  of  the  cut-off  date.  Treatment  for  iiNT  included  corticosteroids 
and/or  tocilizumab  in  15.5%  of  subjects,  corticosteroids  alone  in  12.9%  of  subjects  and  both 
corticosteroids and tocilizumab in 2.3% of subjects. These data were similar to those of the Day 120 
Safety dataset (any grade iiNT was reported in 99 out of 359 subjects (27.6%), with Grade ≥ 3 in 35 
out of 359 patients (9.7%). 
In the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set, the incidence of TEAEs from the ND/PD SOC was 248 out of 349 subjects 
(71.1%). 
Cytopenia and Prolonged cytopenia 
Almost  all  subjects  (316  out  of  349  subjects;  90.5%)  in  the  Pooled  3L+  DLBCL  Set  experienced 
laboratory-based cytopenias within the first month (Day 1 to 29) following infusion of JCAR017. 
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022  
Page 242/252 
 
 
 
Of the 316 total subjects treated in Studies 017001 and BCM-001 (Cohort 1), who had Day 29 laboratory 
findings of Grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia (n=95) or Grade 3-4 neutropenia (n=65) or Grade 3-4 anaemia 
(n=19), and for whom follow-up laboratory cytopenia results were available, the median time (min, max) 
to resolution (cytopenia recovering to Grade 2 or less) was as follows (in days): thrombocytopenia 37 
days (5, 328); neutropenia 29 days (2, 328); and anaemia 30 days (3, 150). 
Infections 
In the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set, all-grade TEAEs in the SOC of Infections and Infestations were reported 
in  133  out  of  349  subjects  (38.1%).  Treatment-emergent  AEs  of  infection  considered  Grade  ≥  3  in 
severity  were  reported  in  44  out  of  349  subjects  (12.6%)  with  pathogen  unspecified  reported  in  30 
subjects (8.6%), bacterial in 14 subjects (4.0%), and viral and fungal in 4 subjects each (1.1%). Events 
were Grade 5 in 5 out of 349 subjects (1.4%). Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation following JCAR017 
therapy  was  not  observed  in  subjects  who  had  pre-treatment  evidence  of  latent  or  suppressed  HBV 
infection. As of the 19 Jun 2020 safety update, taking into account the overall incidence of Grade ≥ 3 
infections in 58 out of 359 (16.2%) subjects in the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL (with Grade ≥ 3 infections occurring 
in  13.1%  of  subjects  (47/359)  during  the  treatment-emergent  period),  data  showed  that  Grade  ≥  3 
infections  generally  occurred  at  higher  frequencies  in  subjects  who  had  severe  neutropenia  or  febrile 
neutropenia, hypogammaglobulinaemia AEs, and who received IVIG therapy. 
Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) 
Tumour lysis syndrome was reported in 2 out of 349 subjects (0.6%) in the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set (both 
subjects in the 017001 DLBCL Treated Set). Both events were Grade 3 and neither was reported as SAE.  
Hypogammaglobulinaemia/B-cell aplasia 
In the Pooled 3L+ DLBCL Set, TEAEs of hypogammaglobulinaemia were noted in 43 out of 349 subjects 
(12.3%; n=43/359, 12% at the Day 120 safety cut-off date) during the treatment-emergent period and 
for  14  out  of  302  subjects  (4.6%)  during  the  posttreatment-emergent  period.  All  events  of 
hypogammaglobulinaemia were Grade 1 or 2.  
B-cell aplasia was evident at baseline in 92% (241 out of 262 subjects) of the 017001 DLBCL Treated 
Set. Consistent with transgene persistence, B-cell aplasia was observed in 98% of subjects (240 out of 
244 subjects) on Day 29, 93% (153 out of 165 subjects) on Day 90, 86% (100 out of 116 subjects) on 
Day 180, and 73% (51 out of 70 subjects) on Day 365. 
Subjects in Study BCM-001 (Cohort 1) exhibited a similar high rate of B-cell aplasia ranging from 100% 
on Day 29 (N = 23) and Day 90 (N = 10), 86% (6 of 7 subjects) on Day 180, and 75% (3 of 4 subjects) 
on Day 270. 
These  patients  were  treated  with  intravenous  immunoglobulin  replacement  therapy  following  the 
institutional guidelines. 
MAS/HLH 
Among  the  349  subjects  treated  in  the  Pooled  3L+  DLBCL  Set,  2  subjects  (0.6%)  in  Study  BCM-001 
developed Grade 4 MAS. Both subjects had post-mortem findings consistent with MAS, but deaths were 
suspected  of  being  from  other  causes  (the  first  due  to  respiratory  failure  and  the  second  to  candida 
sepsis). 
Second primary malignancy 
During  treatment-emergent  period  SPM  was  reported  in  6  patients  (1.7%)  and  17  (5.6%)  during 
posttreatment-emergent  period.  According  to  the  applicant,  the  most  common  malignancies  reported 
were  cutaneous  squamous  cell  carcinoma,  cutaneous  basal  cell  carcinoma,  and  myelodysplastic

syndrome (MDS). As of 19 Jun 2020, 26 out of 359 (7.2%) subjects treated with liso-cel in the Pooled 
3L+ DLBCL Set had developed 1 or more SPMs. 
Deaths due to AEs 
In  the  Pooled  3L+  DLBCL  Set,  119  out  of  143  deaths  (34.1%  of  340  patients  in  total)  after  the  first 
JCAR017  treatment  were  due  to  disease  progression,  16  deaths  (4.6%)  were  due  to  Grade  5  AEs,  5 
deaths (1.4%) were due to unknown causes, and 3 deaths (0.9%) were due to other causes. Grade 5 
TEAEs were reported in 11 out of 349 subjects (3.2%) and were considered related to JCAR017 in 6 
subjects  (diffuse  alveolar  damage,  pulmonary  haemorrhage,  multiple  organ  dysfunction  syndrome, 
cardiomyopathy, candida sepsis and respiratory failure).  
Grade 5 AEs were reported for 5 out of 349 subjects (1.4%) during the post-treatment emergent period. 
Events  were  considered  related  to  JCAR017  in  1  subject  who  had  Grade  5  progressive  multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy.  At  the  Day  120  Safety  dataset,  in  the  Pooled  3L+  DLBCL  Set,  159  out  of  359 
subjects  (44.3%)  had  died  any  time  after  the  first liso-cel  infusion.  Most  deaths  were  due  to  disease 
progression (133 out of 159), 16 were due to AEs (4.5%), 6 to unknown cause and 5 to other. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
• 
In rare cases, it may be possible that some patients will receive product outside of the target 
CD4+:CD8+ cell components ratio range, such as patients who receive out-of-specification lots 
with respect to the target CD4+:CD8+ cell components ratio. Therefore, as there is currently no 
confirmation  (only  the  JCAR017-BCM-005  protocol  was  amended  for  the  time  being),  the 
applicant  is  recommended  to  collect  data  on  the  numbers  of  effectively  administered  CD4+, 
CD8+ and CD4+:CD8+ cell components ratio in the JCAR017-BCM-005 study. 
• 
Finally, besides the immediate risks identified for this product (CRS, NT, infections, cytopenias), 
there are certain potential risks for which conclusive data could not be obtained due to the limited 
follow-up time (10.74 months). Therefore, aspects regarding secondary malignancies, replication 
competent lentivirus analysis need to be appropriately assessed in the follow-up JCAR017-BCM-
003.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
JCAR017 is a novel anti-CD19 CAR T-cell product which is characterised by a target 1:1 CD4+/CD8+ T-
cell  composition.  While  supported  by  preclinical  data,  the  clinical  relevance  of  this  1:1  ratio  remains

uncertain. Only retrospective analysis of limited data with different ratios is available and the observed 
relationships  with  efficacy  and  safety  outcomes  are  only  indicative.  A  better  control  of  toxicity  is 
suggested as regards acute toxicity, yet the potential impact on long term efficacy and safety outcomes 
is still not fully characterised. Data will be provided in the post authorisation setting in the imposed non 
interventional study.   
Uncertainties on the magnitude and duration of the treatment effect remain, but larger study 017001, 
with  longer  follow-up,  reported  compelling  ORR  and  CR  rates.  Further  data  will  be  provided  by  more 
mature analyses from the imposed Post-Authorisation Studies 017001, JCAR017-BCM-001. 
With the intrinsic limits of naïve indirect comparisons, the results observed with JCAR017 in terms of 
response rate, depth and duration of response, although not clearly outstanding, can still be considered 
of  relevance  when  contextualised  in  the  current  treatment  landscape,  as  highlighted  by  the  provided 
SLR,  MAIC  and  by  a  recent  meta-analysis  investigating  the  efficacy  of  second-generation  CAR  T-cell 
therapy in DLBCL (see Al-Mansour M et al, Mol Clin Oncol 2020). Adjusted analyses from historical study 
NDS-NHL-001 also showed higher ORR, CRR, PFS and OS in the reference dataset from study 017001 
compared to the historical cohorts. In study 017001, KM curves for time-to-event endpoints showed a 
plateau  phase  starting  approximately  from  month  12-18  onwards,  which  suggests  the  possibility  for 
long-term disease control in a subset of patients.  
When the single-arm, open-label, adaptive design of US study 017001 is considered, however, replication 
of results is of pivotal importance to demonstrate the reliability of the observed treatment effect. In this 
regard, results from the smaller EU cohort of Phase II study BCM-001, especially in terms of duration of 
response, are less convincing. The reasons behind the shorter response duration observed in the phase 
II study are not completely understood, yet limited numbers do not exclude the possibility of random 
findings. Data from the imposed non interventional study (registry) will be used to provide additional 
post-approval information from EU subjects that will receive the commercial product. 
With  respect  to  the  rarer  lymphoma  subtypes  claimed  by  the  broad  indication,  only  limited  clinical 
information were available in JCAR017 studies. In particular, at the time of the most recent data cut-off 
date, only 8 patients with FL3B had received JCAR017 across all clinical studies. FL3B is a rare form of 
aggressive B-cell lymphoma and an unmet medical need exists for patients who have received at least 
2 prior lines of therapy can be recognised. The current sample size in the FL3B subset would be, per se, 
too limited for specific B/R evaluations, even though responses have been observed. It is noted, however, 
that  the  distinction  between  FL3B  and  DLBCL  is  mainly  based  on  histology  but  that  there  is  a  large 
overlap in gene expression profile, clinical presentation and behaviour/biology. Importantly, the same 
treatment options are available for FL3B and DLBCL and response to treatment appears to be similar. 
The long-lasting remissions observed with JCAR017 in patients with R/R FL3B, despite failure of multiple 
prior  lines  of  chemotherapy,  are  suggestive  of  an  efficacy  that  is  at  least  similar  to  that  observed  in 
DLBCL  NOS.  Based  on  these  similarities,  the  results  observed  with  JCAR017  in  the  overall  study 
population are considered to provide support for the efficacy seen in the very few FL3B patients and the 
inclusion of indication in FL3B patients in section 4.1 is, therefore, accepted. Considering the rarity of 
this condition, limited additional data in FL3B patients can be expected from ongoing clinical trials and 
in  the  post-marketing  setting.  Information  will  nonetheless  be  collected  from  the  CIBMTR  and  EBMT 
registries (PASS BCM-005) to further characterise effects in patients with FL3B subtype. 
The efficacy of JCAR017 in the following clinically relevant subgroups will be further investigated in the 
post-approval setting:  
• 
• 
Patients with rarer histological subgroups (including FL3B, PMBCL, HGL, and DLBCL transformed 
from indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma other than FL)  
Patients with secondary CNS lymphoma involvement 
Assessment report  
EMA/134759/2022  
Page 248/252 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Frailer  patients  due  to  age  ≥  75  years  or  co-morbidities  (e.g.  renal  impairment  and  reduced 
cardiac function) 
Patients with possible adverse prognostic factors (eg, high International Prognostic Index [IPI] 
score, extranodal involvement, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] performance 
status ≥ 2) 
Patients previously exposed to anti-CD19 therapy  
Patients with low pre-leukapheresis ALC.  
Although  reasons  for  pre-infusion  treatment  failure  will  not  be  collected  as  part  of  the  PASS,  since 
registries only collect data on patients who actually receive JCAR017, data collected in the applicant’s 
manufacturing database will be provided to further investigate the reasons for early treatment failures. 
The  applicant  has  committed  to  provide  all  available  information  on  the  rate  and  reasons  for  liso-cel 
manufacturing  failures  that  occur  in  the  post-approval  setting  in  the  periodic  safety  update  reports 
(PSURs). 
Regarding safety, JCAR017 was generally well tolerated in patients with 3L+ large B-cell lymphoma, with 
a  toxicity  profile  overall  in  line  with  that  of  the  approved  anti-CD19  CAR  T-cell  products,  with  the 
exception  that,  based  on  the  available  data,  CRS  and  NT  AEs  were  more  likely  to  be  low-grade  and 
resolved. However, the median on-study follow up is short, long-term data are missing and some adverse 
effects  might  not  be  observable  yet.  Secondary  malignancies  are  of  particular  concern  and  long-term 
collection of data is crucial. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Despite the limits of the clinical development programme and the remaining uncertainties, the available 
efficacy and safety data with JCAR017 are considered of relevance and support a positive B/R for full 
approval in the claimed indication.  
The  remaining  uncertainties  will  be  addressed  post-marketing  in  the  framework  of  imposed  post-
authorisation measures. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The  overall  B/R  of  Breyanzi  in  subjects  with  r/r  DLBCL,  PMBCL  and  FL3B,  after  two  or  more  lines  of 
systemic therapy, is considered positive.  
The CHMP endorse the CAT conclusion on the benefit-isk balance as described above  
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CAT by consensus is of the opinion that Breyanzi is not similar to Yescarta, Kymriah, Polivy, Gazyvaro 
and Minjuvi within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000.  
The CHMP endorses the CAT conclusion on similarity as described above.  
Outcome 
Based on the CAT review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CAT considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of Breyanzi is favourable in the following indication(s):

The CHMP endorses the CAT conclusion on the obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures as 
described above.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the review of available data on the two active substances which are covered by the 
single INN lisocabtagene maraleucel, the CAT considers that: 
•  CD19-directed genetically modified autologous cell-based product consisting of purified 
CD8+ T cells (CD8+ cells) 
•  CD19-directed genetically modified autologous cell-based product consisting of purified 
CD4+ T cells (CD4+ cells) 
are to be qualified as new active substances in themselves as they are not constituent of a 
medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.  
The CHMP endorses the CAT conclusion on the new active substance status claim.

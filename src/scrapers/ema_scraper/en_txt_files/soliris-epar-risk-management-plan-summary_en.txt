PART VI: Summary of the Risk Management Plan 
Summary of risk management plan for Soliris (eculizumab) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Soliris. The RMP details 
important risks of Soliris, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will 
be obtained about risks and uncertainties (missing information) of Soliris. 
Summary of product characteristics (SmPC) of Soliris and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Soliris should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Soliris should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which 
is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of the 
RMP of Soliris. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Soliris is authorised for paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH), atypical haemolytic 
uremic syndrome (aHUS), refractory generalised myasthenia gravis (gMG), and relapsing 
neuromyelitis optica spectrum disease (NMOSD) (see SmPC for the full indications). It 
contains eculizumab as the active substance and it is given by intravenous route of 
administration. 
Further information about the evaluation of benefits can be found in EPAR of Soliris, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further 
characterise the risks 
Important risks of Soliris, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about the risks of Soliris, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
−  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
− 
−  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
−  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with 
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of Soliris, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Soliris are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Soliris. Potential risks are concerns for 
which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and 
needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

II.B Summary of important risks 
Identified risk: Meningococcal infections 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
This important identified risk is based on the results 
from the clinical development programme for 
eculizumab. Eculizumab mode of action is based on 
terminal complement component 5 (C5) inhibition 
which is associated with an increased incidence of 
meningococcal infections caused by 
Neisseria meningitidis, as meningococcus is 
primarily cleared by the terminal complement 
components. 
The link between terminal complement components 
deficiency states and (serious) infections caused by 
N. meningitidis is firmly established and evidenced 
by the scientific literature. 
Identified risk: Meningococcal infections 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
Main risk factors for these infections include: 
−  Genetic deficiency or therapeutic inhibition of 
terminal complement 
−  Lack of commercially available vaccine against 
− 
certain meningococcus serogroup 
(Partial) resistance of meningococcal strain to 
prophylactic antibiotics 
−  Professionals who are exposed to environments 
of greater risk for meningococcal disease 
−  Research, industrial, and clinical laboratory 
personnel who are routinely exposed to 
N. meningitidis 
−  Military personnel during recruit training 
(military personnel may be at increased risk of 
meningococcal infection when accommodated in 
close quarters)  
−  Day-care centre workers  
−  Living on a college or university campus 
−  Travelling to endemic areas for meningococcal 
meningitis (e.g. India, Sub-Saharan Africa, 
pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia for Hajj) 
No data were identified as additional risk factors for 
meningococcal infections related to underlying 
disease such as PNH, aHUS, refractory gMG, or 
NMOSD. 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
−  SmPC sections 4.3, 4.4, and 4.8 
−  PL sections 2 and 4

Identified risk: Serious infections (including sepsis) 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
This important identified risk is based on the results 
from the clinical development programme for 
eculizumab. Eculizumab mode of action is based on 
terminal complement (C5) inhibition, impacting in a 
minor way the ability to clear also infections other 
than Neisseria spp. infections in eculizumab-treated 
patients, potentially leading to serious infections 
and/or sepsis, even though this impact is 
significantly lower since early complement 
components are not affected by eculizumab.  
However, scientific literature shows that patients 
with terminal complement deficiency are only at 
increased risk of Neisseria spp. infections. 
Moreover, patients receiving eculizumab are often at 
increased risk of infection due to the underlying 
medical condition or its complications. 
Patients with underlying immunodeficiency or 
acquired conditions (e.g. aplastic anaemia or 
myelodysplastic syndrome in patients with PNH or 
end-stage renal disease in patients with aHUS) or 
due to exposure of immunosuppressive drugs 
(e.g. long-term use of corticosteroids and/or 
immunosuppressive agents in patients with gMG and 
NMOSD) are at increased risk of serious infections. 
 
Identified risk: Serious infections (including sepsis)

Additional pharmacovigilance activities:

See section II.C of this summary for an overview of 
the post-authorisation development plan. 
Identified risk: Aspergillus infection 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
This important identified risk is based on the initial 
findings from the clinical development programme 
for eculizumab for prevention of antibody mediated 
rejection in kidney transplant recipients (Studies 
C10-001 and C10-002) and post-marketing 
experience. 
Since host defence against Aspergillus infection is 
mainly driven by cellular immunity and complement 
component (C3a, C3b iC3b, and C5a), allowing 
chemotactism and opsonisation, eculizumab 
C5 blockade has only a partial effect on the host 
defence against Aspergillus infections and therefore, 
has been observed only in severely 
immunocompromised patients. 
Further evidence linking aspergillosis to 
immunocompromised states is provided in the 
scientific literature. 
Underlying severe immunodeficiency condition, 
acquired or due to other immunosuppressive drugs 
including steroids, exposure to construction or 
demolition, severe pancytopenia due to aplastic 
anaemia, and pre-existing lung impairment or pre-
existing Aspergillus infection. 
 
Identified risk: Aspergillus infection 
No data were identified for risk factors for 
Aspergillus or other fungal infections in patients with 
refractory gMG; however, as refractory gMG 
patients are on immunosuppressive drugs including 
steroids and may also have diabetes mellitus, they 
are potentially at risk. Patients with NMOSD are also 
treated with various immunosuppressive agents 
(including intravenous high-dose 
methylprednisolone for acute attacks and oral 
corticosteroids, mycophenolate mofetil or 
azathioprine for prevention of attacks) and may be 
more prone to opportunistic infections caused by 
Aspergillus.

Identified risk: Severe TMA complications due to drug discontinuation in aHUS 
patients 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
This risk resulted from the clinical development 
programme for eculizumab in aHUS patients. aHUS 
is a chronic and debilitating life-threatening disease 
due to life-long uncontrolled complement activation. 
Eculizumab treatment inhibits this otherwise 
uncontrolled complement activation. The 
discontinuation of eculizumab can result in signs and 
symptoms of severe TMA complications. The 
efficacy results from C11-003 observational study 
indicate that patients who discontinued eculizumab 
experience a higher rate of TMA complications 
(3-fold) compared to patients who never 
discontinued eculizumab treatment.

This important identified risk is based on the 
observations made within the clinical development 
programme for eculizumab. As with all therapeutic 
proteins, administration of Soliris may result in 
infusion reactions and could cause allergic or 
hypersensitivity reactions. Most of infusion-reactions 
which occurred in patients receiving eculizumab 
were non-serious and did not required 
discontinuation of eculizumab. In the post marketing 
setting anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions have 
been reported during or following eculizumab 
infusion. 
In PNH clinical studies, adverse events were 
documented in the Case Report Form as to whether 
they occurred within 24 or 48 hours of study 
medication. According to this definition of infusion 
reaction, events were generally similar when 
comparing the eculizumab treated patients from 
C04-001 and C04-002 (26 weeks) to placebo-treated 
patients from C04-001. 
Patients with hypersensitivity to eculizumab, murine 
proteins or to any of the excipients.

Potential risk: Serious haemolysis after drug discontinuation in PNH patients 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
This potential risk is a theoretical possibility in 
PNH patients, based on the mode of eculizumab 
action and nature of PNH. 
No data were identified for risk factors for serious 
haemolysis due to drug discontinuation in patients 
with PNH.

Grounds for the COMP opinion  
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2020 designation was 
based on the following grounds:

the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing asciminib was considered 
justified based on preliminary clinical data demonstrating anti-tumour response in patients affected 
by the condition; 
the condition is life threatening and chronically debilitating due to the consequences of the bone 
marrow dysfunction, such as intracranial or gastro-intestinal haemorrhagic episodes, disseminated 
intravascular coagulation, and the risk of severe infections; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 1.2 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made. 
In addition, although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition exist in the European 
Union, the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal 
product containing asciminib will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. The 
sponsor has provided preliminary clinical data demonstrating anti-tumour response in patients 
affected by the condition, who have failed all currently authorised therapies. The Committee 
considered that this constitutes a clinically relevant advantage. 
Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
The sponsor is proposing that chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is an orphan condition. CML is a 
myeloproliferative neoplasm. It is characterised by a balanced genetic translocation 
t(9;22)(q34;q11.2), involving a fusion of the Abelson gene (ABL1) from chromosome 9q34 with the 
breakpoint cluster region (BCR) gene on chromosome 22q11.2. This rearrangement is known as the 
Philadelphia chromosome. The molecular consequence of this translocation is the generation of a 
BCR::ABL1 fusion oncogene, which in turn translates into a BCR::ABL1 oncoprotein. BCR::ABL1 
positive cells are genetically unstable and are prone to develop multiple and heterogeneous genomic 
abnormalities, resulting in the transformation of the leukaemic phenotype from chronic to acute, hence 
leading to the progression from chronic (CP) to accelerated (AP) and blast (BP) phases. About 50% of 
patients with CML diagnosed in Europe are asymptomatic (Annals of Oncology (2017) 28 (Supplement 
4): iv41–iv51). 
Most (90%-95%) patients present in CML-CP. Common signs and symptoms of CML-CP, when present, 
result from anemia and splenomegaly. These include fatigue, weight loss, malaise, easy satiety, and 
left upper quadrant fullness or pain. Rare manifestations include bleeding with a low platelet count 
and/or platelet dysfunction), thrombosis (associated with thrombocytosis and/or marked leukocytosis), 
gouty arthritis (from elevated uric acid levels), priapism (usually with marked leukocytosis or 
thrombocytosis), retinal hemorrhages, and upper gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding (from 
elevated histamine levels due to basophilia). Leukostatic symptoms (dyspnea, drowsiness, loss of 
coordination, confusion) due to leukemic cells sludging in the pulmonary or cerebral vessels, are 
uncommon in CP despite white blood cell (WBC) counts exceeding 100×109/L. Splenomegaly is the

most consistent physical sign detected in 20-40% of cases. Hepatomegalyis less common (less than 
10%). Lymphadenopathy and infiltration of skin or other tissues are rare. When present, they favour 
Ph-negative CML or AP or BP of CML. Headaches, bone pain, arthralgias, pain from splenic infarction, 
and fever are more frequent with CML trans-formation. Most patients evolve into AP prior to BP, but 
20% transition into BP without AP warning signals. Therefore, CML-AP might be insidious or present 
with worsening anemia, splenomegaly and organ infiltration; CML-BP presents as an acute leukemia 
(myeloid in 60%, lymphoid in 30%, megakaryocytic or undifferentiated in 10%) with worsening 
constitutional symptoms, bleeding, fever and infections.  
The diagnosis of typical CML is simple and consists of documenting, in the setting of persistent 
unexplained leukocytosis (or occasionally thrombocytosis), the presence of the Philadelphia (Ph) 
chromosome abnormality, the t(9;22)(q34;q11), by routine cytogenetics, or the Ph-related molecular 
BCR::ABL1 abnormalities by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or by molecular studies (Jabbour 
E and Kantarjian, Am J Hematol (2020) 95:691–709).  
The COMP has designated this condition in the past and continues to do so. 
The approved therapeutic indication “Scemblix is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
Philadelphia chromosome
positive chronic myeloid leukaemia in chronic phase (Ph+ CML
CP) previously 
treated with two or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors” falls within the scope of the designated orphan 
condition “Treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia”.

Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
Patients present with splenomegaly which is the most common physical sign in 40-50% of patients, 
hepatomegaly is less common. Headaches, bone pain, arthralgias, pain from splenic infarction and 
fever are more frequent with CML transformation. 
Life expectancy is linked to the type of CML the patient has been diagnosed with. A key factor in 
patient outcome is the recognition of disease progression from CP to BP as this affects prognosis. 
About 50% of patients are diagnosed as asymptomatic and rarely do they present initially as BP. 
CML has become a chronic disease with a good prognosis. A study in 2016 reported that 50% of 
patients with CML die not from CML itself, but from secondary cancers and cardiovascular events 
(Pfirrmann M et al, Leukemia (2016) 30:48-56). 
Survival rates have significantly improved over the last 20 years with overall survival rates as high as 
90% at 5 years (Di Felice et al, BMC Cancer (2018) 18:1069). 
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor has identified sources of epidemiologic data on CML in the European population using a 
targeted literature search and an online search of other sources of data, such as population-based 
cancer databases and registries. These were presented in full in an appendix attached to the 
maintenance report. There was no consultation of the European Cancer Information System (ECIS).  
The estimated complete prevalence in the 2020 EU-27 plus Iceland and Norway was 1.3 per 10,000. 
Among individual European countries ranging from 0.7 per 10,000 in Bulgaria to 2.0 per 10,000 in 
Belgium.

CP, accelerated phase (AP), and blast phase (BP) Ph+ CML previously treated with one or more 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor(s) [TKI(s)] and for whom imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib are not considered 
appropriate treatment options. 
The COMP also takes into consideration the current European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 
treatment guideline (Hochhaus et al, Ann Oncol (2017) 28 (suppl 4): iv41–iv51).  
Significant benefit 
Novartis sought protocol assistance for the justification of significant benefit 
(EMEA/H/SA/3426/1/FU/2/2020/PA/II). The COMP agreed, in principle, with Novartis’ approach to 
confirm the significant benefit of asciminib for the treatment of CML as stated below: 
‘In conclusion, the pivotal data will be derived from the phase III study (asciminib versus bosutinib). If 
the results from this study confirm the superiority over bosutinib leading to the positive benefit/risk 
balance for asciminib at the MAA (CHMP), and if the additional indirect comparison of clinical data 
(especially against ponatinib) will confirm the expectations, the COMP agrees that the Applicant`s 
approach to support the justification of significant benefit could in principle be acceptable and 
sufficient. The final assessment will depend on the totality of evidence presented in the dossier. 
However, if the sponsor intends to include RWE data, the attention of the sponsor is drawn to the 
limitations of such comparisons necessitating appropriate methodological preparation to be 
prospectively agreed with the EMA.’ 
Significant benefit versus bosutinib 
Data to support significant benefit is based on the results of the primary analysis of the pivotal Phase 
III study [CABL001A2301] (ASCEMBL, hereafter referred to as Study A2301).  
Trial A2301, was performed as a multi-center, open-label randomized study designed to compare the 
efficacy and safety of asciminib with that of bosutinib in the treatment of patients with CML-CP who 
received at least 2 prior ATP-binding site TKIs. Approximately 220 patients were to be randomized in a 
2:1 ratio asciminib 40 mg BID or bosutinib 500 mg QD.  
Patients with documented lack of efficacy as per study protocol (based on 2013 ELN recommendations, 
Baccarani et al 2013) in either treatment arm must discontinue study treatment. Patients on bosutinib 
meeting the lack of efficacy criteria were offered the option to switch to asciminib treatment (Figure 2). 
Patients discontinuing bosutinib due to any other reason including adverse events were not allowed to 
switch to asciminib. The efficacy and safety data collected during the switch to asciminib are analysed 
separately. 
The primary objective of the study was major molecular response (MMR) rate at Week 24 and the key 
secondary objective MMR rate at 96 weeks. 
The primary and key secondary analyses of this study were planned and performed, when all 
randomized patients had been on study treatment for 24 and 96 weeks, respectively, or discontinued 
earlier.  
Table 2 summarizes prior TKI therapy in patients enrolled to Study A2301.

supportive endpoint. The method used was a Matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) in patients 
with Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML-CP previously treated with two or more TKIs. Furthermore, 
the sponsor has provided additional supportive and sensitivity analyses for the comparison at 24 
weeks, 48 weeks and 96 weeks as separate documents.  
The primary and supportive analyses are performed for CABL001A2301 asciminib treated patients 
(A2301-a) in the full analysis set (FAS). Additional sensitivity analyses are performed for a sub-group 
of patients in A2301-a FAS. Summary statistics reported for the ponatinib treated patients in PACE 
Cohort A (PACE-A) are used for comparison.  
The PACE trial was the pivotal study for ponatinib approval conducted by Ariad Pharmaceuticals for 
Ph+ CML patients who had previously been treated with two or more TKIs. PACE enrolled 449 patients 
who were assigned to 1 of the 6 cohorts. All patients were treated with ponatinib. There were 203 
patients in the cohort of CML-CP relapse or intolerant (R/I) to previous TKI treatments without T315I 
mutation (Cohort A). These 203 patients reflect a comparable population as the A2301 study and 
provide aggregated data (AD) for the MAIC comparison. In this document, PACE-A refers to these 
patients. 
The information about the PACE study and trial results are extracted from the following three sources: 
1. Cortes et al N Engl J Med (2013) 369(19):1783-96; 2. Cortes et al, Blood (2018) 132(4):393–404; 
3. clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01207440. 
The pivotal Phase III study CABL001A2301 provides individual patient level data (IPD) on the efficacy 
of asciminib. In particular, the 157 patients in the asciminib arm who are part of the FAS are included 
in the analysis. In this document, A2301-a cohort refers to these patients.  
The comparison of asciminib versus ponatinib is based on a retrospective, non-randomized indirect 
comparison between patients in A2301-a cohort and a selected historical control group on ponatinib in 
PACE-A.  
According to the sponsor, both CABL001A2301 and the PACE-A cohort enrolled patients from the same 
target population. Even if not exactly the same it can be agreed that the populations are similar. In 
both studies, patients were 18 years or older, had CML-CP, had prior use of TKI before enrolling into 
their respective studies, and were R/I to the previous TKI(s). For the MAIC, patients were matched on 
age, sex, and race, and on the prognostic clinical characteristics, i.e. number of prior TKIs, ECOG 
performance status, and major cytogenetic status at baseline. This design was in principle agreed with 
EMA in a protocol assistance in 2020.  
Three eligibility criteria differ between CABL001A2301 and PACE-A. First, no patients who had prior use 
of ponatinib were enrolled in the PACE study. This is not the case for CABL001A2301. Second, PACE-A 
enrolled only patients who were R/I to dasatinib or nilotinib whereas CABL001A2301 enrolled patients 
who had two or more of any TKIs in their treatment history. Third, patients in complete cytogenetic 
response (CCyR) at baseline were not eligible in PACE, while in Study A2301 these patients were 
allowed. In total 67 patients in A2301-a would not have been eligible for PACE-A, which leaves 90 
patients who could in theory be enrolled to PACE-A (Figure 4). 
The 67 patients excluded from the analysis were:  
19 in CCyR at baseline, who were excluded from A2301 CCyR analysis set;  
35 with non-evaluable BMA at baseline (BMA missing at baseline, BMA with insufficient quality or BMA 
with less than 20 metaphases examined), who were also excluded from A2301 CCyR analysis set;

recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Stelara. The 
marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Janssen-Cilag International N.V. 
The CHMP adopted a new indication as follows2: 
"Paediatric plaque psoriasis 
Stelara is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adolescent patients from the 
age of 12 years and older, who are inadequately controlled by, or are intolerant to, other systemic therapies 
or phototherapies (see section 5.1)." 
For information, the full indications for Stelara will be as follows: 
“Plaque psoriasis 
Stelara is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who failed to respond 
to, or who have a contraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapies including ciclosporin, 
methotrexate (MTX) or PUVA (psoralen and ultraviolet A) (see section 5.1). 
Paediatric plaque psoriasis 
Stelara is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adolescent 
patients from the age of 12 years and older, who are inadequately controlled by, or are 
intolerant to, other systemic therapies or phototherapies (see section 5.1). 
Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) 
Stelara, alone or in combination with MTX, is indicated for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis in adult 
patients when the response to previous non-biological disease modifying anti rheumatic drug (DMARD) 
therapy has been inadequate (see section 5.1).”

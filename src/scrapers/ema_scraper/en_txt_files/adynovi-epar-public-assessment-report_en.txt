1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Baxalta Innovations GmbH submitted on 1 March 2016 an application for marketing authorisation 
to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Adynovi, through the centralised procedure falling within the Article 
3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.  
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency). 
Adynovi can be used for all age groups. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated that 
rurioctocog alfa pegol was considered to be a new active substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical and 
clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0001/2016 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0001/2016 was not yet completed as some measures 
were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan 
medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the 
proposed indication. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance rurioctocog alfa pegol contained in the above medicinal product to 
be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a medicinal

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Haemophilia A is a rare and serious, X-linked, recessive bleeding disorder that predominantly affects males and 
is characterized by a deficiency of FVIII. In patients with haemophilia A, the primary platelet-driven hemostasis 
is not affected, but generation of a stable, fibrin-rich clot is defective because inadequate amounts of thrombin 
are generated. Affected patients suffer from both spontaneous, non-traumatic bleeding episodes as well as 
substantially prolonged bleeding episodes upon injury. Rarely, life-threatening bleeding may also occur. 
Patients exhibit variable clinical phenotypes depending on the extent of residual activity (%) of the deficient 
FVIII that is used to classify the disease severity (WFH, 2012): 
• 
• 
• 
<1% FVIII activity: severe haemophilia A 
1% to 5% FVIII activity: moderate haemophilia A 
5% to 40% FVIII activity: mild haemophilia A 
Patients with severe haemophilia A bleed spontaneously into joints and muscles, which often results in 
permanent, disabling joint damage. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
The overall reported number of haemophilia A patients estimated in the 2013 survey by the World Federation of 
Haemophilia (WFH) included 107 countries with a total population of 6,461,067,861 and identified 140,313 
people with haemophilia A (2.2 per 100,000 individuals). There are currently approximately 30,000 patients in 
the EU with a mean prevalence of approximately 0.6 patients per 10,000. 
Haemophilia A is inherited as an X-linked recessive trait and the main risk factors are therefore family history 
and a carrier mother. Approximately 30% of patients have no family history of the disease; their disease is 
presumably caused by new mutations. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/782768/2017 
Page 11/109 
  
  
 
2.1.3.  Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
The factor VIII/von Willebrand factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von Willebrand factor) 
with different physiological functions. When infused into a haemophiliac patient, factor VIII binds to von 
Willebrand factor in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for activated factor IX, 
accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X. Activated factor X converts prothrombin into 
thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Haemophilia A manifests as profuse bleeding into the joints and muscles or internal organs, either 
spontaneously or as the result of accidental or surgical trauma. Recurrent joint bleeding can lead to chronic 
arthropathy, pain, and loss of function (Bolton-Maggs and Pasi, 2003). The majority of bleeding occurs internally 
into joints, most commonly hinged joints such as the ankles, knees, and elbows. Serious bleeds also occur in 
muscles, especially in deep compartments such as the iliopsoas, calf and forearm, and in the mucous 
membranes in the mouth, gums, nose, and genitourinary tract. Less frequently, life threatening bleeds can 
occur in or around vital areas or organs such as the gastrointestinal system or enclosed areas like the 
intracranial or intracerebral spaces. The approximate frequencies of bleeds at the different sites are: 70 to 80% 
in joints (haemarthrosis), 10 to 20% in muscle, 5 to 10% in the central nervous system, and < 5% for bleeds at 
all other sites (Srivastava et al., 2013). 
2.1.5.  Management 
Standard treatment for haemophilia A patients is the replacement of the missing protein by infusion of 
exogenous FVIII concentrates (as plasma-derived FVIII [pdFVIII] or recombinant FVIII [rFVIII] concentrates). 
Treatment regimens are either on-demand therapy (given when a bleed occurs) or prophylaxis (which consists 
of regular infusion of FVIII given every 2 to 3 days to prevent bleeding). In the short term, prophylaxis can 
prevent spontaneous bleeding and in the long term, prophylaxis can prevent bleeding into joints that will 
eventually lead to debilitating arthropathy. 
Prior to the introduction of clotting factor concentrates in the 1960s, the prognosis for haemophilia A patients 
was poor, average life expectancy being 15 to 25 years. Major advances in the safety of clotting factor products, 
including the availability of rFVIII concentrates, the availability of comprehensive haemophilia A treatment 
centres, the institution of routine prophylaxis, the introduction of home treatment, as well as the active roles 
that patients take in self-advocacy, have enabled patients with haemophilia A to lead a “close to normal” life. 
About the product 
Adynovi (INN: rurioctocog alfa pegol) is a pegylated form of Baxalta’s licensed full-length recombinant factor 
VIII ADVATE [octocog alfa] consisting of 2,332 amino acids [molecular weight (MW) 280 kDa]. It is produced by 
recombinant DNA technology in the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line without the addition of any 
exogenous human- or animal-derived protein in the cell culture process, purification, pegylation or final 
formulation. The purified protein is covalently conjugated with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) reagent (MW 20 
kDa), predominantly attached to the B-domain of factor VIII. 
Adynovi is supplied as powder and solvent for solution for injection together with a reconstitution device.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/782768/2017

The Applicant claimed indication:  
Adynovi is indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital 
factor VIII deficiency). Adynovi can be used for all age groups. 
Subsequently revised proposed indication: 
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients 12 years and above with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII 
deficiency). 
Posology: 
The posology for On Demand Treatment is proposed as follows: 
The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 International Unit (IU) 
factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/dl.  
The required dose is determined using the following formula: Required units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired 
factor VIII rise (%) x 0.5 
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the clinical 
effectiveness in the individual case. 
In the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given plasma 
activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) within the corresponding period. The following table can be used to guide 
dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:

wound healing, then continue 
therapy for at least another 7 days 
to maintain a factor VIII activity of 
30% to 60% (U/dl). 
For long term prophylaxis, the recommended starting regimen is 40 to 50 IU/kg of Adynovi per kg bodyweight 
twice weekly in 3 to 4 day intervals. Adjustments of doses and administration intervals may be considered based 
on achieved FVIII levels and individual bleeding tendency. 
Previously untreated patients: 
The safety and efficacy of Adynovi in previously untreated patients have not been established. No data are 
available. 
Paediatric patients: 
On demand treatment dosing in paediatric patients (12 to 18 years of age) is the same as for adult patients. 
Prophylactic treatment for patients from 12 to <18 years is the same as for adult patients. Adjustments of doses 
and administration intervals may be considered based on achieved FVIII levels and individual bleeding 
tendency.   
Method of administration: 
Adynovi should be administered as an intravenous infusion. The rate of administration should be determined to 
ensure the comfort of the patient up to a maximum of 10 ml/min.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The active substance, rurioctocog alfa pegol (BAX 855) is a human recombinant Factor VIII conjugated with a 
polyethylene glycol reagent – 20 kDa PEG. More specifically, the recombinant Factor VIII used for the 
conjugation is the active substance (octocog alfa, also termed Advate bulk active substance (BAS)) of Baxalta’s 
licensed medicinal product ADVATE. ADVATE is therefore an intermediate of the Adynovi active substance (AS), 
rurioctocog alfa pegol.  
The average molecular mass of rurioctocog alfa pegol is approximately 330 kDa of which the protein moiety 
constitutes approximately 280 kDa. Rurioctocog alfa pegol contains recombinant coagulation Factor VIII, a 
purified glycoprotein that has 2332 amino acids. The protein bears a number of post-translational modifications 
including more than 20 glycans, most of which are located on the B domain. The amino acid sequence is 
comparable to human Factor VIII, and the post-translational modifications are similar to those of the 
plasma-derived molecule. The 20 kDa PEG polymer used consists of a branched structure with 2 symmetric PEG 
chains with 10 kDa each connected to a glycerol backbone. The PEG-FVIII conjugate is linked via a stable amide 
bond to the protein lysine side chain residues.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Rurioctocog alfa pegol active substance (AS) is manufactured by Baxalta US, Inc.. Release testing sites are 
specified in the dossier.  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The first step of the rurioctocog alfa pegol manufacturing process is the production of the intermediate octocog 
alfa (rFVIII, termed ADVATE bulk active substance BDS), which is synthesized in a CHO cell line. During the cell 
culture process Factor VIII is produced and secreted into the medium. The recovery and purification process 
consists of filtration and chromatography steps as well as an S/D (solvent detergent) virus inactivation step. 
The process to produce one batch of the AS intermediate (Octocog alfa) has been defined.  
The octocog alfa containers are stored under defined conditions (temperature, time). In-process monitoring and 
controls, including controls for microbial purity and endotoxin, are valid and are suitably described.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/782768/2017 
Page 15/109 
  
  
 
Octocog alfa is then used for further manufacturing to the rurioctocog alfa pegol AS. The rurioctocog alfa pegol 
AS production process to produce one rurioctocog alfa pegol AS batch has been defined. 
The process includes a PEGylation and chromatography steps prior to formulation. Shipping conditions have 
been adequately validated. 
The manufacturing process and process controls for octocog alfa pegol are suitable. The active substance 
manufacturing process is therefore considered acceptable.  
Control of Materials 
The expression system chosen to produce recombinant Antihemophilic Factor, Plasma/Albumin Free Method 
(rAHF-PFM), is the same as ADVATE and involves the sequential introduction and amplification of rAHF and 
recombinant von Willebrand Factor (rvWF) genes in a CHO cell line. The resulting cell line (10A1C6) is used to 
produce the licensed product ADVATE. The entire hFVIII gene has been previously sequenced. 
A two tiered cell banking system is used and sufficient information has been provided regarding testing of 
master cell bank (MCB) and working cell bank (WCB). Genetic stability has been demonstrated for cells. New 
WCBs are established according to an agreed protocol. All raw materials used for cell bank preparation and 
fermentation as well as for the purification of the active substance have been listed. Information on the quality 
and control of the listed raw materials has been provided. A detailed description of the cell line derivation, 
preparation and characterisation of the cell bank system and manufacturing process has been provided.   
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) and Quality Attributes (QAs) have been defined and are listed in the 
dossier. Critical process parameters (CPPs) were defined and the related operating ranges are documented in 
several development study reports and transferred to manufacturing documents.  
Specifications with acceptance criteria for identity, purity and potency are in place and are considered 
appropriate for quality control release of the intermediate octocog alfa. 
Information on the PEG reagent has been presented and information on its manufacturing process, 
characterisation data, specification and stability data has been presented. The establishment of the control 
strategy is acceptable.  
Process validation 
Process validation has been conducted for the complete AS manufacturing process. Multiple bulk active 
substance batches have been used for process validation. The presented process validation data are acceptable. 
For the subsequent steps to produce the AS, the performed process validation activities are considered 
appropriate to ensure that the manufacturing process operates within established parameters and can perform 
effectively and reproducibly to deliver active substance material meeting its predetermined specifications and 
quality attributes. This process validation consisted of multiple commercial-scale and process rurioctocog alfa 
pegol batches.  
Process-related as well as product-related impurities in the Advate bulk active substance have been 
appropriately discussed (see characterisation section for more information). The provided data demonstrate the 
removal of these impurities to sufficiently low levels. For a subset of the discussed impurities, specifications with 
appropriate acceptance limits during routine production are in place. Stated impurities have been present in 
product tested in clinical trials

Manufacturing process development 
The Manufacturing process development history throughout clinical development has been described.  
Octocog alfa from the all manufacturing sites has been used during development. It has been shown that 
rurioctocog alfa pegol batches produced with octocog alfa derived from all facilities are comparable.  
Since process changes were implemented in the manufacturing process for the octocog alfa, a thorough 
evaluation of the comparability of the octocog alfa between manufacturing changes as well as the comparability 
of the rurioctocog alfa pegol manufactured from octocog alfa manufactured with the modified process was 
performed. Structural and functional characterization showed that the process changes implemented during 
development did not impact product characteristics and confirmed process consistency.  
Comparability studies demonstrated consistency, stability and reproducibility of the rurioctocog alfa pegol 
process over time. Conducted process robustness studies confirmed that the described manufacturing process 
is suitable for the production of PEGylated Factor VIII having a consistent product quality 
Characterisation 
Characterisation has been carried out on an appropriate number of batches of rurioctocog alfa pegol . 
Characterisation of octocog alfa as provided is based on the information included in the respective ADVATE 
Marketing Authorisation (MA). A large panel of “state-of-the-art” methods has been used to address primary 
and higher-order structures, size, protein composition and pegylation analysis, post-translational modifications, 
purity and the impurity profile as well as the biological activity.  
Process and product-related impurities which can be present in the active substance have been identified. 
Impurities derived from the manufacturing of the intermediate rFVIII (ADVATE process) have been discussed. 
Aggregates are routinely analysed. A discussion on the genotoxic potential of all materials/impurities involved in 
the synthesis of the PEG reagent on the basis of their chemical structure has been provided and all are 
considered to be non-mutagenic. 
Specification 
The specifications include suitable test methods for identity, purity and potency .The limits for potency 
determination by both chromogenic and clotting assay have been adapted  
Analytical Methods 
Method descriptions as well as validation summaries and detailed reports have been provided.  
Batch analysis 
Batch analyses data have been provided for all manufacturing sites. Batch data of active substance produced for 
nonclinical, clinical, conformance (commercial process and scale lots produced at the commercial facility) and 
stability program have been presented. Overall, these data support the conclusion that the manufacturing 
process at all three sites is capable of delivering material of consistent high quality.  
Reference Materials 
A narrative description of the reference standards for testing of potency and total protein has been provided. 
Also the reference material for Western blotting and a pegylation reagent standard for testing of free PEG (in AS) 
and total PEG (in AS and FDP) has been described.

A major objection was raised on the potency standard regarding its calibration, its relationship to the 
international standard and the suitability of the proposed potency assays for release purposes. During the 
procedure, the applicant directly calibrated the standard to the international standard and provided further 
information about the potency assignment.  
However, as a post-marketing commitment, the applicant is recommended to review the potency specification 
limits in line with manufacturing experience. 
Stability 
The AS stability studies were carried out in accordance with ICH guidelines. The container closure system is 
representative of that used for commercial material. The relevant attributes of the AS were adequately 
addressed by appropriate stability-indicating tests in the analytical program.  
This shelf-life claim is based on stability data from clinical phase 2/3 batches and conformance batches (process 
validation lots). The stability data support the shelf-life claim.  
Note that the current licensed storage condition for the octocog alfa intermediate is as approved in the Advate 
MA. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product-- Adynovi- powder FP

The pharmaceutical development of the finished product has been comprehensively described. The final chosen 
formulation has been sufficiently justified. The same formulation as for the product Advate was chosen and this 
same formulation was used for preclinical studies as well as for the different clinical phases. 
The manufacturing process transfer between sites has been justified for Adynovi FP. Despite these differences in 
manufacturing location during development, there were no changes in the formulation used for preclinical and 
clinical Phase 1 and Phase 3 lots. No major changes of the process have been introduced. The description of the 
development of the lyophilisation process is comprehensive including state-of-the-art techniques. 
Characterisation showed that the quality of the materials used in the clinical trial is comparable. The 
development of the container closure system has been acceptably described including the compatibility with the 
two different reconstitution systems chosen (BAXJECT II HF and BAXJECT III). In conclusion, AS and FP 
manufactured according to the commercial process has been used in phase III studies.  
Reconstitution system 
The finished product Adynovi (BAX 855) can alternatively be supplied with the BAXJECT II Hi-Flow Needleless 
Transfer Device or the BAXJECT III Reconstitution System. The BAXJECT II Hi-Flow device is a CE marked 
product.  
Unlike the BAXJECT II Hi-Flow device, BAXJECT III system is an integrated reconstitution system consisting of 
a product vial, a diluent vial and a transfer set; the respective vials are pre-assembled to the BAXJECT III unit 
and the integrated system is provided to the user in a single blister pack. Comprehensive information about the 
material used in comparison with the CE marked system as well as qualification of the system has been 
provided. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured by Baxalta Manufacturing S.à.r.l.. Baxalta Belgium Manufacturing S.A 
serves as the final batch release entity.  
After the manufacturing operations required to produce AS (i.e. PEGylated recombinant human Factor VIII) 
have been performed, it is shipped to the FP facility for FP manufacture.  
The batch size of finished product has been defined.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/782768/2017

The finished product manufacturing process consists of the formulation of active substance, followed by sterile 
filtration, aseptic filling, lyophilisation, capping, bulk packaging and storage before shipment of the finished 
product between facilities for labelling and packaging. The manufacturing process has been described in 
sufficient detail. No reprocessing is foreseen. 
Critical quality attributes (CQA) and critical process parameters (CPPs) were identified and then used during 
clinical development to establish manufacturing controls and limits and to evaluate the impact of manufacturing 
process changes prior to implementation. For the validation of the manufacturing process, an appropriate 
validation approach has been used. The manufacturing process is similar to the one performed to produce 
Advate FP. All conformance (validation) batches met the acceptance criteria for the finished product 
specification.  
Validation and evaluation studies were also performed to demonstrate that manufacturing operations 
consistently produce safe and effective BAXJECT III Systems that meet predetermined specifications and quality 
attributes. BAXJECT III system is validated with Adynovi FP and found acceptable to show suitability for the 
intended use. Shipping validation studies have been performed and are appropriate. 
Product specification 
For some of the test parameters tightening/ clinical justification was requested. Impurities do not differ in AS 
and FP. During production of Adynovi, only mannitol and trehalose are added to the AS and no additional 
process-related impurities are anticipated. The agreed FP specification limits, based on the process capability 
and evaluation of available clinical results include appropriate specifications for identity, purity and potency. 
For both potency assays a new in-house reference standard, calibrated against the WHO 8th IS was introduced 
and appropriate specification limits for both potency assays were established.   
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods have been sufficiently described. Non-pharmacopoeial methods have been validated 
according to ICH Guidelines. Issues related to the potency assays raised during the procedure and included in 
the remaining major objection at Day 180 were subsequently suitably addressed. Concerning the chromogenic 
method used, the CMHP has recommended further information to be provided post-authorisation regarding 
planned improvements to this assay and review of potency specification limits, as needed.    
Batch analysis 
A large number of batch data for non-clinical and clinical development finished product batches as well as for at 
least three conformance batches (process validation) are provided. All final finished product lots were tested 
according to finished product specifications at time of manufacture and release of the batches. The analyses 
data of batches manufactured in all facilities showed that all batches met the acceptance criteria and confirm 
consistency of the manufacturing process. Furthermore, batch data from conformance batches with the 
reconstitution system BAXJECT III to verify comparability with batches without this system are acceptable.  
Reference materials 
Suitable information on reference standards which are used for the release and stability testing of AS and FP 
have been provided. See active substance ‘reference materials’ section and ‘analytical methods’ in the finished 
product section for further information on the reference standard.

Stability of the product 
A FP shelf-life of 24 months following storage at +5°C ±3°C, which includes a three month storage period at up 
to +30°C, is proposed. After storage at +30°C, the product must not be returned to the refrigerator. Stability 
studies were conducted in line with ICH guidelines in containers identical to those proposed for marketing. Based 
on available stability data, the shelf-life and these storage conditions, as stated in the SmPC are acceptable. 
To date, long-term stability data (+5°C) have been presented for the conformance batches.  
The stability-indicating quality attributes used to monitor the stability are a subset of the FP release 
specifications.  
Results from conformance batches for the four strengths (250, 500, 1000 and 2000 IU/vial) are presented.   
Also data from clinical batches are provided, which can be considered as supporting data.  
Satisfactory data to support storage of the finished product for up to three months at 30°C after long-term 
storage of 21 months at +5°C have been provided. The conducted photostability study, in line with ICH Q1B, 
showed that the AS protein is not prone to photo-degradation.  
Chemical and physical in use stability has been demonstrated for three hours at a temperature not above 30 °C. 
From a microbiological point of view, unless the method of reconstitution precludes the risk of microbial 
contamination, the product should be used immediately.  
A FP shelf-life of 24 months following storage at +5°C ±3°C, which includes a three month storage period at 
+30°C, is agreed.  
Adventitious agents 
The viral validation studies performed for Advate are fully applicable to the Adynovi product and no animal- or 
human-derived substances are added during the PEGylation process or used in the manufacture of FP. 
Therefore, the adventitious agents’ safety evaluation of the licensed product Advate is fully applicable to 
Adynovi. In the course of the manufacture of octocog alfa, a series of chromatographic steps and 
solvent/detergent treatment have been validated for virus inactivation/ removal.  
For the manufacture of octocog alfa, the biological material used during purification has been adequately 
evaluated from a viral/TSE perspective. Overall, the manufacturing process for Adynovi provides for an 
acceptable margin of safety, of the final product with respect to adventitious viruses. 
2.2.4.  Finished Medicinal Product-- Adynovi- solvent FP 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The sterile Water for Injections (WFI) is supplied in 2mL and 5 mL presentations, There are no other constituents 
in the formulation. The solvent is supplied in a Type I (Ph. Eur.) glass vial with a chlorobutyl stopper (complying 
with Ph. Eur.). Container-closure integrity was demonstrated and an extractable-leachable study was 
conducted.  
The manufacturing process described is unchanged from the process used during development. Stability data 
indicate that the sterile Water for Injections (sWFI) is compatible with the vial and stopper. Data on compatibility 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/782768/2017 
Page 21/109 
  
  
of the sWFI with the lyophilised finished product has been provided in the stability section for the lyophilised 
finished product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process for sterile Water for Injections (sWFI) consists of seven main steps: equipment 
preparation, compounding, filtration, filling, autoclaving, visual inspection, labeling and packaging. These main 
steps are regarded as critical and a number of process control tests are performed to control the manufacturing 
process. 
Product specification 
The specifications for the fill volumes 2 and 5 ml are identical except for the limit for extractable volume. The 
specification includes appropriate identity and purity tests  
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods are based on both the USP monograph for sterile Water for Injections and the European 
Pharmacopoeia monograph for sterilised Water for Injections (0169). 
Batch analysis 
Satisfactory batch analysis data are presented in the dossier  
Stability of the product 
Based on the real time stability data presented, the proposed shelf life of 5 years (5 ml) and 3 years (2 ml) when 
stored at 2 – 8°C is acceptable. 
2.2.5.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Advate bulk active substance (octocog alfa, which is the active substance of the EU licensed Advate, is used for 
further processing (pegylation with a 20 kDa activated PEG) to the rurioctocog alfa pegol. The manufacturing 
process has been adequately described; the proposed process control strategy and the performed process 
validation activities are considered appropriate to ensure that the manufacturing process operates within 
established parameters and can perform effectively and reproducibly to deliver active substance material 
meeting its predetermined specifications and quality attributes. Presented batch data further support this 
conclusion and do not raise any concerns related to the quality of AS. Specifications for release and stability 
testing are acceptable  
The applicant changed to the chromogenic method for release purposes. However, as a post-marketing 
commitment, the applicant is recommended to provide additional information regarding the planned 
improvements to the assay and review the potency specification limits in line with manufacturing experience.  
2.2.6.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/782768/2017

have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give reassurance on 
viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.7.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP 
recommends points for investigation as detailed in the report. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology  
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Primary pharmacodynamics of Adynovi were assessed in one in vitro () and two in vivo studies (), please see 
table below: 
Table 5 
Summary of primary pharmacodynamics of Adynovi: 
Effects of Adynovi on the coagulation system in terms of activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) were 
studied in vitro in plasma from rats, Cynomolgus monkeys and humans at a clinically relevant concentration and 
above. A dose dependent reduction of aPTT time was observed for all 3 species which indicates that Adynovi is 
pharmacologically active in humans and in rats and Cynomolgus monkeys, the 2 species used for general 
toxicological studies. No data on the effect of Adynovi on aPTT in plasma from mice and rabbits, also used in the 
toxicological evaluation, were submitted. Due to the type of pharmacological effect Adynovi is however expected 
to be pharmacologically active also in mice and rabbits. Although a comparison with Advate for evaluation of the 
effect of PEGylation on aPTT would have been valuable, this is not considered critical as the pharmacological 
effects of Adynovi and Advate were compared in animal in vivo studies and the effect of Adynovi is confirmed in 
clinical studies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/782768/2017 
Page 23/109 
  
  
 
 
The effects of Adynovi and Advate on blood coagulation system reflected by reduced tail tip bleeding and 
induction of carotid occlusion were studied in vivo in E17 FVIII knock out mice (exon 17 ko mice; strain 
B6;129S- F8tm2Kaz/J) lacking coagulation factor VIII. The results (reduced blood loss in the Tail Tip Bleeding 
study and decreased time to permanent vessel occlusion in the Carotid Occlusion study for Adynovi and Advate) 
should be interpreted with caution due to high variability and/or small sample size. However, they are 
considered sufficient to conclude that both models indicate a prolonged efficacy of Adynovi in comparison to 
Advate. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No dedicated studies on secondary pharmacodynamics were submitted.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
The thrombogenic potential of Adynovi and its effects on body temperature, cardiovascular (aortic blood 
pressure and single lead electrocardiogram (ECG)), and respiratory (intra-thoracic pressure) parameters were 
investigated in 2 GLP-compliant in vivo studies in rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys, please see table below: 
Table 6 
Summary of safety pharmacology studies for Adynovi 
No thrombogenic potential or effects on the cardiovascular or the respiratory system were observed in the safety 
pharmacology studies following single IV administrations of 900 IU/kg Adynovi in rabbits and 150 and 600 IU/kg 
Adynovi in Cynomolgus monkeys.  
No studies on toxicokinetics were provided but an exposure in terms of FVIII activity up to approximately 115 
h*IU/ml for AUC0-tlast and 12 IU/ml for Cmax can be extrapolated to the cardiovascular and respiratory safety 
pharmacology study in monkeys from the single dose escalation study of Adynovi in Cynomolgus monkeys. This 
is above the expected therapeutic exposure in patients. 
As no adverse behavioural effects or clinical observations were observed in the cardiovascular and respiratory 
safety pharmacology study in Cynomolgus monkeys no specific CNS safety pharmacology study was provided.     
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies have been performed.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of Adynovi were evaluated based on FVIII activity, FVIII levels and PEGFVIII 
(Adynovi) levels in single dose studies following intravenous administration to E17 FVIII knock out (ko) mice 
(with haemophilia of a severe phenotype (<1% FVIII residual activity)), normal rats and Cynomolgus monkeys. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/782768/2017

The primary endpoints in the pharmacokinetic studies were AUC0-tlast to evaluate the bioavailability of Adynovi 
and the MRT to describe a potential extension of circulation time in blood.

Methods of analysis 
Regarding the methods of analysis, different methods were used for the characterisation of the pharmacokinetic 
profile of Adynovi in rat, Cynomolgus monkey and E17 mouse plasma such as the FVIII activity chromogenic 
assay, the FVIII: Antigen ELISA and the PEG-factor FVIII ELISA. 
Absorption 
In E17 FVIII ko mice, an increase of AUC0-tlast with Adynovi to almost the double of the AUC0-tlast observed 
with Advate could be shown. The MRT indicated a prolongation of 1.6 times in FVIII activity with the Adynovi 
compared to Advate (7.9 vs. 4.9 hours). 
In Sprague Dawley rats, single administration of Adynovi showed that FVIII antigen dose-adjusted AUC0-tlast 
was 1.4 times higher after infusion of Adynovi than after infusion of Advate. The MRT for FVIII antigen was 
prolonged by the factor 1.2 after Adynovi administration compared to Advate. No consistent deviation from a 
dose proportional increase in exposure of FVIII antigen or PEG-FVIII was indicated at the studied dose range of 
200, 350 and 700 IU/kg. 
The pharmacokinetic profile of Cynomolgus monkeys showed a prolonged FVIII exposure with Adynovi in 
comparison to Advate. The AUC0-tlast for Adynovi was 1.3 times larger than for Advate after two 
administrations of 350 IU FVIII/kg at day 1 and day 8.  
With regards to FVIII activity the increase of AUC0-tlast per doubling dose of Adynovi in IU/kg for the dose range 
investigated (350, 700 and 1500 IU FVIII/kg) was 1.51 and 1.85, respectively, for the two investigated lots 
indicating a dose-proportional increase for one lot and a sub-proportional increase for the other lot. Similarly, 
increases in the AUC0-tlast of FVIII-bound PEG were 1.47 or 2.0, respectively. 
Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion 
Concerning absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination radiolabelled Adynovi was examined following 
a single intravenous administration in rats. There were minimal gender differences in pharmacokinetic 
parameters, with males showing a longer half-life, while exposure to drug derived radioactivity remained 
similar. The radiolabelled test item was distributed with highest concentrations of radioactivity observed in the 
plasma, blood, mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen, liver, adrenal glands, and kidneys. Distribution of 
[3H]PEG-rFVIII derived radioactivity to the brain, a tissue of high concern for PEGylated compounds, was shown 
Assessment report

but the levels were lower than in other tissues and no CNS toxicity was indicated in the toxicological studies in 
adult animals. Radioactivity was cleared from circulation with half-lives of at least 276 hours (plasma, females), 
with elimination primarily via urine. The mean overall recoveries indicate a quantitative excretion at 1008 hours 
after single dose injection. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
No nonclinical drug interaction studies were performed. 
Other pharmacokinetic studies 
No other PK studies have been performed. 
2.3.4. Toxicology 
The nonclinical development plan for Adynovi included in vitro and in vivo toxicity studies.  
Single dose toxicity 
No single dose toxicity studies have been performed. However, a dose-escalation study with Cynomolgus 
monkeys was performed with Adynovi. 
Repeated dose toxicity 
The nonclinical development plan for Adynovi included in vitro and in vivo toxicity studies.  
Repeated dose toxicity studies of Adynovi were assessed in rats and Cynomolgus monkeys.   
In the repeated dose toxicity study in rats, animals were dosed intravenously with 350 or 700 IU FVIII/kg 
Adynovi (2 lots) every other day over 29 days (15 doses) followed by a 2 week recovery period. 
No thrombotic events and no treatment related changes were noted up to 700 IU FVIII/kg. Therefore, the No 
Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) was set at 700 IU FVIII/kg after 15 injections every other day for a time 
period of 29 days.

In a pilot toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkeys, treatment with Adynovi was well tolerated at 700 IU/kg during 
the repeated dose phase and did not reveal any adverse clinical symptoms or findings that could be attributed 
to the test item. The NOAEL for the repeated dose phase of this study was 700 IU FVIII/kg under the conditions 
of this study. 
The observed findings were likely of pharmacological nature and resulted in a transient increase of 
thrombin-antithrombin fragments, an increase of D-dimers, and shortening of the activated partial 
thromboplastin time in single animals at single time points. During the repeated dose phase there was a 
prolongation of aPTT which was possibly related to the formation of neutralising anti-FVIII antibodies. 
Slightly elevated liver enzymes during the escalating dose phase are believed to be of transient nature and did 
not result in toxicologically relevant findings. There were no findings in serum chemistry or haematology 
parameters throughout the repeated dose phase that were considered to be test item-related. 
In a pivotal repeat dose toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkeys (Study 1933-018) 2 lots of Adynovi at dose levels 
of 150, 350 or 700 IU FVIII/kg were administered intravenously to the animals every 5 days for a period of 4 
weeks (6 applications in total). The assessment of toxicology was based on body weight determination, clinical 
signs, ophthalmic examinations, haematology, coagulation, clinical chemistry, urine analysis, macroscopic 
findings at necropsy and histopathological findings; toxicokinetics and antibody assessment were also included. 
Treatment with Adynovi was well tolerated at either dose and did not reveal any adverse clinical symptoms or 
findings that could be clearly attributed to the test item. No vacuoles were found in the choroid plexus of Adynovi 
exposed animals. However, two animals showed vacuolation in the kidney in the mid dose group (350IU), which 
did not recover after 2 weeks. Renal safety is further discussed in the clinical part of the assessment report. 
The formation of antibodies against Adynovi is an expected immune reaction after repeated application of 
heterologous proteins to Cynomolgus monkeys, which is also well known for non-pegylated FVIII products. 
Thus, the NOAEL for this study was the high dose of 700 IU/kg under the conditions of this study. 
Interaction of Adynovi activity with the coagulation system was shown in an in vitro assay demonstrating a 
dose-dependent reduction of the activated partial thrombin time in plasma from cynomolgus monkeys, rats and 
humans. 
In repeated dose toxicity studies in rats and Cynomolgous monkeys no macroscopic, microscopic or clinical 
findings suggestive of CNS toxicity were observed at any time point during the studies.

Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance was assessed during repeated dose toxicity studies in rats (Study 8202366) and Cynomolgus 
monkeys (Study 1933-018). Microscopic findings at injection sites of animals were comparable with controls and 
were consistent with a normal response expected after intravenous injection.  
One additional study in rabbits was performed to investigate local tolerance of Adynovi at a potency of 2000 IU 
FVIII/5 mL vial (Study PV2651201). The aim of the study was to assess local tolerance of BAX 855 with a 
nominal potency of 2000 IU FVIII/5 mL vial after intravenous (clinical application route), intra-arterial and 
para-venous (possible misapplication routes) application in rabbits. Adynovi (nominal potency of 2000 IU 
FVIII/5 mL vial) was compared with Advate, the currently licensed rFVIII product at a nominal potency of 2000 
IU FVIII/5 mL vial and the corresponding formulation buffer for Adynovi (also used as formulation buffer for 
ADVATE, vehicle control) and saline (negative control). 
No alterations in behaviour were seen during the observation period in any of the treated animals. Macroscopic 
examination revealed no visible changes after administration of Adynovi (nominal potency of 2000 IU FVIII/5 
mL vial) for any administration route. Histopathologically, no adverse lesions with regards to local tissue 
tolerability of the test item were detected. 
Immunogenicity 
Immunogenicity of Adynovi was evaluated in comparison with the unmodified Advate, as any chemical 
modification of FVIII may alter its immunogenic potential. Different comparative immunogenicity studies (in 
vitro in human plasma and whole blood as well as in vivo in mice and monkeys) were performed to assess the 
potential impact of Adynovi and Advate on both the innate and the adaptive immune system. 
As expected for a heterologous human protein drug, repeated doses of Adynovi resulted in the formation of 
anti-drug antibodies specific for human FVIII or PEG and neutralising for FVIII activity in animal models. 
Repeated dose toxicity studies in rats and Cynomolgus monkeys have shown that antibodies specific for human 
FVIII were induced in rats and monkeys. The anti-FVIII antibodies showed neutralising properties against FVIII 
activity and against PEG-FVIII.  
As a consequence, systemic exposures to Adynovi was substantially lower following repeated dose 
administration (Day 29) as compared to those following single dose administrations (Day 1), regardless of 
gender or dose administered. 
Two different lots of Adynovi containing different aggregate levels expressed a similar immunogenicity profile in 
2 haemophilic mouse models. Adynovi induced anti-PEG antibodies only in mice that recognise FVIII as 
immunogenic foreign protein indicating that only patients who recognise FVIII as foreign structure may be at 
risk for developing antibodies against PEG after treatment with Adynovi.  
Results obtained demonstrate that Adynovi and Advate have a similar immunogenicity profile. 
Adynovi was well tolerated after intravenous (intended clinical administration route) intra-arterial and 
para-venous administration, up to a nominal potency of 2000 IU FVIII/5 mL vial, as tested in a local tolerance 
study performed in rabbits (PV2651201). 
In addition, potential cross reactivity of high affinity anti-PEG antibodies with human tissues was investigated in 
a tissue cross reactivity study and showed no findings.

PEG  
PEG is an inert molecule and not metabolised by enzymes. Based on its stable properties, PEG and PEG 
containing drugs may cause vacuolation of certain cell types after treatment with high parenteral doses, as 
observed under histopathological examination of animal organs in previous studies (Ivens et al, 2012). 
Focusing on possible safety issues that could arise from the modification with PEG, the Applicant provided a 
repeated dose toxicity study in rats with intravenous administration of PEG2ru20KCOOH, a toxicological relevant 
unbound 20kD PEG model. 
Considering a PEG dose of 0.095 µg per IU FVIII, the maximum anticipated long-term prophylactic dose of 80 IU 
FVIII/kg results in a single PEG application of 7.6 µg/kg Body Weight. Thus, the highest dose used in this study 
(65 mg/kg) covered approximately the 8552-fold of the worst case clinical PEG exposure / day. 
The PEG polymer without the FVIII protein part was well tolerated in rats and did not show any signs of toxicity 
even at the highest dose tested. In view of PEG-related findings, such as vacuolation of macrophages or other 
cells, reported in the literature, a detailed histopathological examination of the brain (including choroid plexus) 
and of the spinal cord has been conducted in this study by the Applicant.  
The cumulative PEG dose is important in considering possible accumulation and vacuolation of ependymal cells 
in vivo. The PEG exposure anticipated in the clinical setting is 105 times lower than the threshold for ependymal 
cell vacuolation observed in animal studies (≥ 0.4 µmol/kg/month).   
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Adynovi is a recombinant replacement protein of the naturally occurring coagulation factor VIII. It is catabolised 
during human metabolism and no active molecule is excreted by the patient. In accordance with the guideline 
CHMP/SWP/4447/00 (1), Adynovi as a protein is exempted from an environmental risk assessment since 
proteins are unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment.  
However, the Applicant provided an environmental risk assessment (ERA) and presented evidence for the 
absence of need for further screening on the persistence and bioaccumulation potential of the drug substance 
PEG-rFVIII conjugate. 
The Adynovi PECsurfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and is not a PBT substance as Log Kow 
of PEG and PEGylated protein do not exceed 4.5.  
Therefore, Adynovi is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The nonclinical development program was designed to evaluate the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and 
toxicology and immunogenicity of Adynovi in support of the Marketing Authorisation. 
Pharmacology 
Regarding primary pharmacodynamics, a dose-dependent reduction of the activated partial prothrombin time 
by Adynovi could be demonstrated in vitro in human, rat and monkey plasma.  
In vivo a prolonged efficacy of Adynovi in comparison to ADVATE could be shown in both pharmacodynamics 
models (tail tip bleeding and carotid occlusion) performed in E17 FVIII ko mice. Study data revealed that 
Adynovi was similarly efficacious to Advate when administered at ≥ 1.5 times longer treatment intervals than 
Advate. 
According to guideline ICH S7 A “Safety Pharmacology Studies for Human Pharmaceuticals” secondary 
pharmacodynamic studies are defined as “studies on the mode of action and/or effects of a substance not 
related to its desired therapeutic target”. In the nonclinical studies of Adynovi, no effects other than those 
induced by the primary action of Adynovi, i.e. interaction with the blood coagulation, were observed. Hence, no 
dedicated studies on secondary pharmacodynamics were submitted. Since unPEGylated rFVIII is a known active 
substance which interacts specifically with the intrinsic coagulation system, the lack of secondary 
pharmacodynamic studies is accepted. Potential adverse effects of the PEGylated rFVIII would be expected to be 
detected in the safety pharmacological studies and the toxicological studies performed. 
Safety pharmacology 
Results of safety pharmacology studies evaluating the thrombogenic potential (rabbits) and the toxicity (4-week 
toxicity studies in monkeys and rats) did not raise any safety concerns. 
Various types of PEG have however been reported to induce adverse effects such as vacuolisation in the CNS. 
Investigation of potential CNS effects is therefore of utmost importance for a PEGylated product as Adynovi. No 
findings indicative of histopathological changes of Adynovi or unconjugated 20 kDa PEG in the brain or spinal 
cord were reported in toxicological studies in Cynomolgus monkeys and rats, i.e. there were no signs of 
potentially test-article related cell vacuolisation in the CNS of adult animals. However no dedicated CNS safety 
pharmacology single dose studies were performed. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic profile of Adynovi was evaluated in E17 ko mice, in rats and in Cynomolgus monkeys after 
intravenous administration. The primary endpoints evaluated for the in vivo pharmacokinetic studies 
(AUC0-tlast and MRT) demonstrated that PEGylation of human rFVIII increases the circulation time in 
comparison to Advate. 
Administration of radiolabelled PEG-rFVIII to rats revealed extensive distribution of drug-derived radioactivity 
with maximum concentrations in mesenteric lymph nodes, plasma, blood, spleen, liver, adrenal glands, and 
kidneys. Radioactivity was also observed in the brain indicating that [3H]PEG-rFVIII-derived radioactivity 
crosses the blood:brain barrier at low levels. Elimination occurred primarily via urine, the half-life was between 
24 and 30 days for male and female rats, respectively. 
Toxicology 
In both tested relevant species (rats and monkeys) no toxicity was observed for Adynovi even at the highest 
dose levels tested. Repeated doses of Adynovi resulted in the formation of anti-drug antibodies specific for 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/782768/2017 
Page 30/109 
  
  
human FVIII or PEG and neutralising for FVIII activity in animal models. This effect is expected for a repeated 
administration of heterologous human protein drug to the animals. 
Genotoxicity studies were not submitted in accordance with ICH S6(R1) Guideline“Preclinical Safety Evaluation 
of Biotechnology-Derived Pharmaceuticals”, stating that genotoxicity studies are not applicable to the 
assessment of safety of biotechnology - derived pharmaceuticals such as PEGylated recombinant Factor VIII. 
Carcinogenicity studies were not submitted in accordance with ICH S6(R1) - Guidance for Industry. Preclinical 
Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology- derived Pharmaceuticals, stating that carcinogenicity testing of biological 
products is not required unless there is cause for concern. 
No reproduction studies were submitted. This is considered acceptable as these studies would not be 
representative for the situation in humans due to the risk of incompatibility reactions based on an 
antigen-antibody reaction.  
With regards to local tolerance, experimental observations of the Cynomolgus monkeys in the 4-week i.v. RDTS 
(study number 1933-018) revealed no findings of adverse local tolerance effects on the test animals. 
Microscopic findings at injection sites of rats and rabbits were comparable with controls and were consistent with 
a normal response expected after intravenous injection.   
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In accordance with the guideline CHMP/SWP/4447/00 (1), Adynovi as a protein is exempted from an 
environmental risk assessment since proteins are unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment. 
Hence, Adynovi is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
Immunogenicity 
Based on the in vitro non-clinical immunogenicity assessment, Adynovi expresses a similar FVIII 
immunogenicity profile as Advate. Adynovi tested for its potential to induce cytokine release in an in vitro assay 
using human plasma and whole blood from healthy subjects, did not induce cytokine release. Results obtained 
in another comparative in vitro immunogenicity study, assessing the potential to induce complement activation, 
revealed that neither Adynovi nor Advate did activate the complement system in human plasma from healthy 
subjects in vitro. 
Furthermore, Adynovi expresses a similar FVIII immunogenicity profile as ADVATE in vivo, in mice and 
monkeys. Adynovi induced anti-PEG antibodies only in mice that recognise FVIII as immunogenic foreign 
protein. This outcome indicates, that only patients who recognise FVIII as foreign protein may be at risk for 
developing antibodies against PEG after treatment with Adynovi. 
PEG 
A repeated administration with PEG2ru20KCOOH, a toxicological relevant unbound 20kD model PEG, was well 
tolerated in rats and did not show any signs of toxicity even at the highest dose tested. PEG size and clinical PEG 
doses applied with BAX 855 are in a range where occurrence of ependymal vacuolations is also not experienced 
so far with other pegylated compounds (CHMP Safety Working Party's response to the PDCO regarding the use 
of PEGylated drug products in the paediatric population, EMA/CHMP/SWP/647258/2012). 
Even in the absence of PEG-related safety concerns identified within the non-clinical studies conducted by the 
Applicant, they are considered of too short duration for the assessment of safety, especially the potential for 
vacuolation in the choroid plexus, to support treatment with Adynovi beyond 4 weeks. However, it is 
acknowledged that studies of longer duration than 4 weeks with pegylated FVIII are not useful as those lack 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/782768/2017 
Page 31/109 
  
  
clinical translatability due to species-specific antibody development, while a study with the unconjugated PEG 
part of Adynovi could theoretically be undertaken.   
A 3-month repeated intravenous dose toxicity study of an unbound 20 kDa PEG from the public literature 
(Rudmann et al 2013) is considered to be of high quality and sufficient with respect to dose and duration. 
Although molecular weight is an important factor for the distribution and elimination of unconjugated PEG 
molecules, the influence of the polymer structure, which is not known, may also be important. However, no 
further evidence that the published data in Rudmann et al for linear 20 kDa PEG can be extrapolated to the 
branched 20 kDa PEG in Adynovi has been provided. The influence of the polymer structure on the 
pharmacokinetic and/or toxicological profile of unconjugated 20 kDa PEG molecules is still unknown. Hence, 
there remain uncertainties regarding the toxicological profile of Adynovi to support the use especially in the 
youngest age groups.    
Assessment of paediatric data on non-clinical aspects 
No data from juvenile animals were presented with regards to potential risks associated with long-term and 
chronic parenteral administration of Adynovi and potential long-term consequences of the PEG-moiety. 
Regarding the age of the animals in the 3-month repeated intravenous study of a linear 20 kDa PEG by Rudmann 
et al, the rats used were 49 days old at start, which corresponds to human adolescents.   
On account of this, there remain uncertainties in relation to whether the younger children would be more 
vulnerable for potential PEG induced effects, including cell vacuolation, than adults. Due to the lack of a 
well-designed toxicology study of at least 3 month duration with the PEG molecule used in Adynovi (or a relevant 
surrogate) and appropriate data to support safe use in children, the use of Adynovi below the age of 12 is not 
supported from a nonclinical perspective.   
2.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The primary PD studies demonstrated a prolonged efficacy of the PEGylated rFVIII Adynovi in comparison to 
Advate in vivo and, therefore, support the clinical development and marketing authorisation of Adynovi.  
In line with PD results, PK studies revealed a higher exposure to Adynovi in contrast to the non-PEGylated 
product providing a prolonged protective haemostatic effect. 
Although no safety concerns arose from the toxicity studies performed, there remain uncertainties on potential 
long-term toxicological consequences of PEG accumulation, especially in juvenile individuals. A toxicological 
study of sufficient duration with the branched 20 kDa PEG in Adynovi was not provided. Further evidence for that 
the published data in Rudmann et al for linear 20 kDa PEG can be extrapolated to the branched 20 kDa PEG in 
Adynovi, was not provided either. 
Although non-clinical toxicity data with young animals were presented, they did not cover the age range of the 
paediatric population below the age of 12.  
Due to the limited knowledge in relation to whether the younger children would be more vulnerable for potential 
PEG induced effects, including cell vacuolation, than adults, an indication in children under 12 years is currently 
not supported by the non-clinical data.

Analytical methods 
Accuracy, precision, selectivity/specificity, stability and dilution capabilities of the chromogenic and the 
one-stage clotting assay could be demonstrated for measurement of FVIII activity of Adynovi, Advate and 
plasma FVIII in citrated, FVIII deficient plasma. Furthermore an appropriate validation of the ELISA used for 
determination of FVIII antigen in the plasma samples has been presented. The method principles as well as brief 
descriptions of the mentioned methods have been included in the provided validation documents.  
In addition to the validation protocols, the Company has provided a study report which summarizes the outcome 
of a collaborative field study for evaluation and comparison of FVIII activity of recombinant FVIII products in 
hemophilic plasma. In particular, the assay results from laboratories using the one-stage clotting assay where 
compared with the results of laboratories using the chromogenic assay. The provided data indicate that for BAX 
855  
- 
- 
both assays deliver more or less comparable results with respect to in-vitro recovery (101.0 - 124.3 for 
the one-stage clotting assay versus 95.4 -124.0 for the chromogenic assay) and  
the one-stage clotting assays shows a slightly better performance with respect to the intra- and 
inter-laboratory variance (%CV intra-lab 7.4 - 12.4 and inter-lab 14.7 - 17.5 for the one-stage clotting 
versus %CV intra lab 7.6 - 17.3 and inter-lab 10.1 -33.7 for the chromogenic assay). 
Of note, this study is used by the Company to justify the one-stage clotting assay for release and potency 
labeling of drug product in the quality section (in contrast to the chromogenic assay which is the Ph. Eur. method 
foreseen for release control of recombinant FVIII products).  
Furthermore, different aPTT reagents and their impact on assay variability have been investigated in the 
one-stage clotting assay for FVIII activity of BAX 855 in plasma samples. APTT reagents from different suppliers 
(ellagic acids/polyphenolic type or silica/kaolin) and different coagulation analysers (based on either optical or 
mechanical detection) were used for this study. The provided data indicate slightly higher values found with 
ellagic acid/polyphenolic type reagents as compared to silica/kaolin reagents whereas the type of analyser has 
no impact on the variability of the method. The measured Factor VIII activity for the pegylated factor VIII 
Adynovi in plasma samples is much more affected by the type of the used aPTT reagent as the initially submitted 
mean values would have indicated. For example the clotting assay gives results up to 165,2% respective 
145,6% of the label claim when using C.K. Prest respective SynthaFax as aPTT reagent whereas when using 
APTT-SP as aPTT reagent in the one-stage clotting assay gives values of 67,2 respective 69,2% of the label for 
the lowest investigated concentration level of Adynovi. 
PK Trial 261101 
Study 261101 was a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, cross-over, dose-escalation study designed to evaluate 
the safety and PK of single doses of Adynovi (30 and 60 IU/kg) in 8 adult male PTPs with severe haemophilia A 
(FVIII levels <1%) per dose level compared with corresponding single doses of Advate. This phase I trial was 
designed to determine the safety and PK properties of single intravenous doses of BAX 855 in patients with 
haemophilia A (factor VIII <1%) at two dose level cohorts, 30 U/kg and 60 U/kg. In addition, the PK properties 
of Advate were compared to those of Adynovi at the same dose level. The study demonstrated pharmacokinetic 
differences between Adynovi and Advate in adult haemophilia A patients. AUCinf was about 1.5- to 1.7-fold 
higher after administration of Adynovi, corresponding to a decrease in CL of about 30-50%, and t1/2 was about 
1.4-fold longer than for Advate with the 1-stage clotting assay and 1.5-fold longer with the chromogenic assay. 
The estimated mean fold increase in MRT (mean residence time) of BAX 855 versus Advate was approximately 
1.4.

Pivotal Trial 261201 
Study 261201 was a multicenter, open-label, Phase 2/3 study to evaluate the safety, efficacy and PK of Adynovi 
administered as an IV injection in 137 adult or adolescent PTPs ≥12 years of age with severe haemophilia A. 26 
subjects provided PK data at a dose of 45 IU/kg. The data from the phase 2/3 study 261201 demonstrated 
pharmacokinetic differences between Adynovi and Advate in adult and adolescent patients with haemophilia A. 
AUCinf was 2-fold and 1.8-fold higher in adults and adolescents, respectively, after administration of Adynovi, 
corresponding to a decrease in CL of about 35-40% as compared with Advate. Half-life was about 1.4-fold longer 
than for Advate in both age groups. The estimated mean fold increase in MRT (mean residence time) of Adynovi 
versus ADVATE was approximately 1.5.  
Paediatric study 261202 
Study 261202 was a multicenter, open-label, Phase 3  evaluation of the safety, PK, and efficacy of Adynovi for 
routine prophylaxis and control of bleeding in 66 PTPs <12 years of age with severe haemophilia A. 12 subjects 
provided PK data at a dose of 60 IU/kg. All subjects received twice weekly prophylactic treatment with 50 ± 10 
IU/kg of BAX 855 over a period of 6 months or at least 50 exposure days (EDs), whichever occurred last. A 
subset of 31 subjects (14 and 17 in the younger and older age cohort, respectively) provided PK data. All 
evaluable subjects who participated in the PK portion of the study were to have 1 pre-infusion blood draw and 
3 post-infusion blood draws. The latter were to be randomly selected from 3 choices for each blood draw. The 
IWRS was to manage the total numbers of subjects enrolled into each arm of the PK portion of the study, the 
time points of PK infusion and the post-infusion time points for blood draws. The objectives of this study were to 
determine the population PK of Adynovi and Advate in paediatric patients with severe haemophilia A and to 
identify sources of Adynovi and Advate exposure variability by covariate analysis.  
Based on the present population pharmacokinetic analysis, half-life was shorter for Adynovi in children < 12 
years than in adults and adolescents. In addition, IR was lower for children than for adult/adolescent patients. 
Accordingly, a somewhat higher prophylaxis dose is proposed for children, but at the same dosing interval as for 
adults/adolescents (40-60 IU/kg or up to 80 IU/kg twice weekly). The difference between the results from the 
1-stage clotting assay and the chromogenic assay appeared to be somewhat greater in the paediatric population 
than in the adult/adolescent population.

2.4.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The Applicant has explored the PK parameters of Adynovi in 16 adults in PK trial 261101 comparatively to 
Advate, which is the non-pegylated parent molecule of Adynovi. Data from 8 subjects at the 30 IU and 8 subjects 
at the 60 IU dose level are available. In addition, PK data are available from 25 subjects enrolled in the pivotal 
trial 261201 at a dose level of 45± 5 IU in comparison to the same dose of Advate. The PK exercise for Adynovi 
was repeated after 6 months of prophylactic treatment. 
The PK properties of Adynovi in children have been investigated using a nonlinear mixed effects model approach 
in trial 261202 in 31 subjects, 14 aged <6 and 17 aged 6 to <12 years. In addition, point estimates for summary 
PK parameters were derived by the non-compartmental estimation approach. 
The provided PK parameters, among which AUC, IR, t1/2, MRT and clearance are the most important, are in line 
with guideline requirements and therefore endorsed. The numbers of subjects in the different age groups exceed 
the requirements of the current valid guideline EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009 rev. 1. In all trials, a direct 
comparison of PK parameters of Adynovi with its unpegylated parent molecule, Advate, has been provided.  
It is apparent that a modest prolongation of half-life and a greater exposure compared to the unpegylated 
parent molecule can be achieved in adults and adolescents. As expected, the youngest age cohort showed a 
faster turnover than the older age cohorts. Results obtained with the one-stage clotting assay and the 
chromogenic assay are similar.  
The current pharmacokinetic data indicate that Adynovi CL adjusted for bodyweight decreases with age. There 
was no relevant difference in half-life between younger paediatric patients (< 6 years) and older paediatric 
patients (6 to < 12 years). However, the half-life in children <6 years of age may be shorter and this should be 
taken into account when monitoring patients and determining individual dose and dosing interval. 
Nevertheless, based on the average doses given to these two age cohorts and efficacy data in terms of bleeding 
episodes in the paediatric efficacy study, the Applicant suggests that the previously proposed starting dose 
interval of 40-60 IU/kg in paediatric patients is relevant. It can be agreed that available data on dose 
adjustments and incidences of bleedings do not indicate a need for a recommendation for an adjusted starting 
dose in children. It should also be taken into account that considerable variability in individual PK characteristics 
is expected and that individual dose adjustments often have to be made based also on individual bleeding 
tendency. Thus, based on currently available data, the response regarding starting dose recommendations can 
be accepted. 
The repeat PK evaluation after continuous treatment for 6 months, which was done in the pivotal trial 261201, 
shows similar PK parameters and thus satisfies the guideline requirement of demonstrating no decrease in FVIII 
activity after prolonged use. 
Data from the pharmacokinetic subset in study 261201 indicated that annualised bleeding rate (ABR) increased 
with decreased half-life of Adynovi. These data might suggest that the individual dose adjustment based on IR 
at Cmax was not sufficient to obtain adequate efficacy in patients with a short Adynovi half-life, as data obtained 
at Cmax cannot be used to estimate half-life. Patients with a short half-life might possibly need a shorter dosing 
interval rather than a higher dose. The Applicant should discuss whether the same trend, i.e. increased ABR with 
decreasing product half-life, has been observed for other FVIII products or whether this is a specific problem for 
Adynovi, i.e. whether variability in half-life is greater for Adynovi than for other products. In the latter case, it 
should be discussed how patients with short Adynovi half-life should be identified and handled in clinical praxis. 
The Applicant responded that half-life for FVIII products is highly variable and that differences in half-life are 
reflected in differences in time for FVIII levels to fall below 1%. However, dose adjustments are generally not 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/782768/2017 
Page 40/109 
  
  
based on trough levels of activity but on IR at FVIII Cmax, which does not reflect half-life. This problem has been 
recognised previously for unpegylated FVIII, e.g. in the article by Collins et al (2011) cited by the Applicant in 
the response. The authors referred to simulations demonstrating that the trough level and time per week with 
FVIII less than 1 IU/dL are affected more by half-life and frequency of infusions and less by recovery (IR) and 
dose/kg. Thus, this problem appears to be general for FVIII and not specific for the pegylated FVIII. 
As the PD effects of FVIII as a major player in the coagulation cascade are clear to demonstrate 
pharmacodynamics in nonclinical studies only is considered acceptable. 
2.4.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology programme supports the application for Adynovi by elucidating the pharmacokinetic 
properties of this modified FVIII product.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response  studies and main clinical studies 
STUDY 261201  
This was a Phase 2/3, Multi-center, Open Label Study of Efficacy, Safety, and Pharmacokinetics of PEGylated 
Recombinant  Factor  VIII  (Adynovi)  Administered  for  Prophylaxis  and  Treatment  of  Bleeding  in  Previously 
Treated Patients with Severe Haemophilia A (FVIII activity <1%).   
Study Participants  
Inclusion Criteria 
The main criteria for inclusion were: a diagnosis of severe haemophilia A, previous treatment with FVIII 
concentrates for at least 150 EDs, and that the subject be male and aged 12-65 years at screening. 
Exclusion Criteria 
The main criteria for exclusion were the presence of detectable FVIII inhibitory antibodies (≥  0.4 BU using the 
Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay), history of FVIII inhibitory antibodies, diagnosis of an inherited or 
acquired defect other than haemophilia A, or that the subject had recently used another pegylated drug. 
Treatments 
Subjects were enrolled to receive either prophylactic treatment with Adynovi at a dose of 45 ± 5 IU/kg twice 
weekly (Arm A) for ≥50 EDs or 6 months ±2 weeks, whichever occurred last, or on-demand therapy with 
Adynovi at a dose of 10 to 60 IU/kg dose (Arm B) for an approximate duration of 6 months.  
Subjects meeting any of the following criteria during prophylaxis may have had their Adynovi dose increased 
from 45 ± 5 IU/kg to 60 IU/kg:

• Two or more spontaneous (not related to trauma) bleeding episodes in the same target joint within any 
2-month period, or 
• One or more spontaneous (not related to trauma) bleeding episodes in a non-target joint within any 2-month 
period or 
• FVIII trough level < 1% and the investigator assesses the study subject was at increased risk of bleeding.

Subjects meeting any of the following criteria during prophylaxis may have had their Adynovi dose increased 
from 45 ± 5 IU/kg to 60 IU/kg: 
• Two or more spontaneous (not related to trauma) bleeding episodes in the same target joint within any 
2-month period, or 
• One or more spontaneous (not related to trauma) bleeding episodes in a non-target joint within any 2-month 
period or 
• FVIII trough level < 1% and the investigator assesses the study subject was at increased risk of bleeding. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to compare the annualized rates of bleeding episodes (ABR) between subjects who 
received a prophylactic dosing regimen of Adynovi with those who received an on-demand treatment regimen. 
The key secondary objective was to estimate the rate of success of Adynovi for treatment of bleeding episodes. 
Other secondary efficacy objectives included: 
• 
• 
To characterize Adynovi for treatment of bleeding episodes through the number of Adynovi infusions 
needed for the treatment of a bleeding episode and through the length of intervals between bleeding 
episodes 
To compare the total weight-adjusted consumption of Adynovi for each regimen 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary outcome measure was annualized bleeding episode rate (ABR). 
Secondary Outcome Measures: 
•  Rate of success of Adynovi for treatment of bleeding episodes 
•  Number of Adynovi infusions used for the treatment of bleeding episodes 
• 
Time intervals between bleeding episodes 
•  Weight-adjusted consumption of Adynovi 
The subject was to rate the severity of the bleeding episode as mild, moderate or severe and was to rate his 
overall response for each bleeding episode 24 (± 2) hours after initiating treatment using a 4-point Efficacy 
Rating Scale. Efficacy was defined as a response of good or excellent. An inadequate response to Adynovi 
treatment was defined as a rating of fair or none 24 (± 2 ) hours after initiation of Adynovi infusion. Since the 
efficacy rating was based to a large degree on cessation of pain, the investigator/subject was to consider the 
injury-related symptoms when performing the efficacy rating 24 hours after initiating treatment, particularly in 
the case of injury-related bleeding into one or more than one location.

Figure 2 Efficacy Rating scale for treatment of bleeding episodes 
Sample size 
132 subjects were to be assigned to Arm A (prophylactic treatment, N=115) or Arm B (on-demand treatment, 
N=17). Assuming a dropout rate of 10% following study arm assignment, approximately 119 subjects were 
expected to be evaluable for efficacy: approximately 104 subjects from Arm A and 15 subjects from Arm B.  
Primary efficacy outcome measure: In the Advate prophylaxis study the mean ABR in the on-demand arm was 
48.9, the range of ABRs extended from 13.0 to 120.5. To be confident that the sample size would not be 
underestimated, a mean of 27.5 was assumed. The mean ABR in any prophylactic arm was 3.8. These results 
were used in the sample size evaluation of the current study. Under these assumptions the probability that 
prophylaxis would be successful (see below) was approximately 82.6%.  
Success (in treatment of bleeds) was defined as a rating of excellent or good. Assuming a true success rate of 
a subject to be Gaussian distributed with mean 80% and standard deviation 12% and assuming the same bleed 
rate as for the primary endpoint, the power (comparing to a threshold of 70%) was estimated as 87.3%.  
With a sample size of 104 evaluable subjects with ≥ 50 EDs in Arm A, and with 2 subjects developing inhibitory 
antibodies, the upper limit of the 95% CI (Clopper-Pearson) of the proportion of subjects developing inhibitory 
antibodies should not have exceeded 6.8%. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were assigned to a treatment arm based upon their pre-study FVIII treatment regimen; however, once 
17 subjects were assigned to the on-demand arm, subsequent subjects who had previously received on-demand 
treatment were assigned to prophylaxis. 
Blinding (masking)

Statistical methods 
Analysis Sets 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) comprised all subjects who were assigned to the prophylactic arm or the on-demand 
treatment regimen. 
The Per Protocol Analysis Set (PPAS) comprised all subjects who were assigned to the prophylactic or the 
on-demand treatment regimen, treated with their originally assigned dose for the entire duration of study 
participation and who fulfilled the compliance requirements. 
The Safety Analysis Set (SAS) comprised all subjects treated with at least 1 Adynovi dose. All safety analyses for 
Adynovi were to be performed on the SAS.  
Statistical Analysis of Haemostatic Efficacy Endpoints 
The primary objective was to compare the annualised rates of bleeding episodes (ABR) between subjects who 
received a prophylactic dosing regimen of Adynovi with those who received an on-demand treatment regimen, 
the on-demand arm was considered as the treatment regimen control group for efficacy of prophylaxis. The key 
secondary objective was to estimate the rate of success of Adynovi for treatment of bleeding episodes.

Primary Outcome Measure 
Comparisons between prophylactic and on-demand treatment were based on ABR estimates from a negative 
binomial regression model (with a logarithmic link function), taking into account the fixed effect of regimen 
(prophylaxis vs on-demand), presence or absence of target joints at screening, age at screening as a continuous 
covariate, and the duration of the OPE as an offset. Ratios of treatment means (point estimates and their 95% 
CIs) were estimated within this model. Prophylactic treatment was considered successful if the upper limit of the 
95% CI for the ratio between treatment regimen did not exceed 0.5 (corresponding to a 50% reduction of the 
mean ABR compared to the on-demand treatment). 
The following null hypothesis was tested against the one-sided alternative hypothesis at the 2.5% level of 
statistical significance: 
H01: μ1=0.5*μ2 , Ha1: μ1<0.5*μ2 
where μ1 and μ2 were the mean ABRs in on prophylaxis and on-demand, respectively. 
The logarithm of expectation of bleeds per observation time in years (and their 95% CIs) was back-transformed 
to the original scale by exponentiation, resulting in ratios (95% CIs for ratios) of mean ABRs. In addition, 
sensitivity analyses were performed using alternative model: without adjustments, adjusted for Stratum, 
adjusted for Stratum and Age Category. 
Key Secondary Outcome Measure 
Success in the control of bleeding was defined as a rating of excellent or good using the Efficacy Rating Scale for 
Treatment of Bleeding Episodes measured 24 hours after initiation of treatment for the bleeding episode. 
Success proportion (95% CI) was estimated within a general estimating equation (GEE) model framework. The 
model accounted for the fixed effects of on-demand vs. prophylactic regimen, bleed type (joint bleed vs 
non-joint bleed) and severity, and a random subject effect. For the dependent variable (success: yes/no) a 
binomial distribution and a log link was to be assumed, and for the subject effect (defined by a repeated 
statement) an independence working correlation structure was used to start the estimation. Estimated model 
parameter values and CI limits were back-transformed to the original scale by exponentiation. 
The lower limit of the 95% CI was compared to the threshold of 70% (implicitly testing the null hypothesis of 
success rate=70% versus the one-sided alternative of success rate >70% at the 2.5% level of statistical 
significance).

Conduct of the study 
There were 4 protocol amendments to the Protocol version 2012 OCT 19. The amendments were implemented 
prior to analysis. 
Changes in some of the Protocol Amendments did not affect all assessments. Introduction of the longer 84 to 96 
hour washout prior to PK-3 analysis was introduced in Protocol Amendments 3 and 4, which were implemented 
after the majority of subjects completed the month 3 visit. Based on Protocol Amendment 1, IR was only to be 
assessed for subjects in the prophylactic arm of the study and only at visit Week 2 and Month 3, so many 
subjects do not have IR assessments. This was modified in Amendment 3 and Amendment 4 so that additional 
IR at each study visit was optional and could have been performed also on subjects in the on-demand arm. 
These changes did not impact the primary outcome measure (ABR). 
Of 1181 protocol deviations reported in the SAS during the study, 41 (3.5%) were major, 1140 (96.5%) were 
minor. An individual assessment of each protocol deviation indicated that none had any impact upon the conduct 
of the study or the safety and efficacy outcomes. 
The 41 major protocol deviations included: 
• 1 for eligibility: Subject 252006 was assigned to the prophylactic arm, but treated himself only on-demand, 
and thus, he was discontinued. 
• 18 for IP administration, including: 7 cases of an incorrect prophylactic dose being admininstered (usually 
higher), 5 cases of the wrong treatment being administered (e.g. ADVATE rather than Adynovi), 4 cases of 
incorrectly stored product being administered, 1 case of a subject not receiving 50 EDs before the end of 
treatment, and 1 case of a subject who was treated on-demand before the study being assigned to the 
prophylactic arm before the on-demand filled-up. 
• 10 for protocol schedule, including: 6 cases of missed study visits, 2 cases of procedures being performed 
before the ICF was signed because the procedures were to be included in the next protocol amendment, 1 case 
of a PK assessment being performed without adequate washout, and 1 case of the repeat PK being done before 
at least 50 EDs. In addition, there was 1 case of procedures being performed before eligibility was confirmed, in 
a subject who was not treated with Adynovi. 
• 6 for procedures not being done. 
• 6 for other reasons, including: 4 for procedures done before the ICF was signed because the procedures were 
to be included in the next protocol amendment and 2 for subjects not receiving ≥ 50 EDs of prophylactic 
treatment.

an affected brother, followed by an uncle (15/137) and grandfather (7/137).  
Approximately half of subjects had previously received vaccinations against HAV (41.6 %) and HBV (59.1 %), 
and 16.1% of subjects had a history of treatment with pegylated medication, which in all cases was the use of 
pegylated interferon for the treatment of hepatitis C or Adynovi for participation in the phase 1 study 261101. 
Numbers analysed 
The numbers of subjects in each analysis set were: 
• 138 subjects: Full analysis set (FAS) 
• 118 subjects: Per-protocol analysis set (PPAS) 
• 137 subjects: Safety analysis set (SAS) for Adynovi 
• 151 subjects: ADVATE safety analysis set (ASAS) 
• 26 subjects: Pharmacokinetic full analysis set (PKFAS)

The FAS comprised all subjects who were assigned to either arm of the study (ie, prophylaxis or on-demand), 
and the SAS included all subjects treated with at least 1 infusion of Adynovi (the ASAS included all subjects 
treated with at least 1 infusion of ADVATE). There were no subjects included in the SAS but excluded from the 
FAS (Listing 53 [appendix: Patients Excluded from Efficacy Analysis]). One subject (483001) was assigned to 
prophylactic treatment with Adynovi (in the FAS), but was not treated with Adynovi, and thus was not in the 
SAS. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Table 15 Annualized Bleeding Rate Primary Analysis in Age Subgroups –FAS-  Study 261201 
Comparisons between prophylactic and on-demand treatment were based on ABR estimates from a negative 
binomial regression model, taking into account the treatment regimen, target joints and age at screening, and 
duration of the OPE. The primary outcome analysis of ABRs was performed on the FAS, and the analysis 
performed on the PPAS confirmed and supported the result of the FAS for the primary outcome. 
ABR Descriptive Analyses 
ABR by Target Joint Status, Bleeding Site and Cause 
Analysis for the PPAS: ABR results are presented by target joint status at screening, bleeding site and cause  
Mean joint ABRs were lower for those without target joints at screening compared with those with target joints 
at screening, although median joint ABRs were similar for those without and with arthropathy screening. 
However, there were only 2 subjects in the on-demand arm without target joints at screening, and thus, a 
comparison between those without and with target joints is limited.

Table 16 Annualized Bleeding Rate by bleeding site and Cause for each treatment arm in PPAS-  
Study 261201 
Forty out of 101 subjects (40%) experienced no bleeding episodes, 58 out of 101 subjects (57%) experienced 
no joint bleeding episodes, and 58 out of 101 subjects (57%) experienced no spontaneous bleeding episodes in 
the prophylaxis arm. All subjects in the on-demand arm experienced a bleeding episode, including a joint or 
spontaneous bleeding episode. 
A total of 518 bleeding episodes were treated with Adynovi in the per protocol population. Of these, 361 bleeding 
episodes (n=17 subjects) occurred in the on demand arm and 157 (n=61 subjects) occurred in the prophylaxis 
arm. The median dose per infusion to treat all bleeding episodes in the per protocol population was 32.0 
(Interquartile Range (IQR): 21.5) IU per kg. Overall, 95.9% of bleeding episodes were controlled with 1 to 2 
infusions and 85.5% were controlled with only 1 infusion. Of the 518 bleeding episodes, 96.1% were rated 
excellent (full relief of pain and cessation of objective signs of bleeding after a single infusion) or good (definite 
pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding after a single infusion) in their response to treatment with 
Adynovi.

Bleeding episodes were characterized by site (joint, non-joint, or unknown), cause (spontaneous/unknown or 
injury), severity (mild, moderate, or severe, and treatment regimen (prophylaxis or on-demand). The 
haemostatic efficacy of Adynovi for the treatment of bleeding episodes was assessed by the number of infusions 
to treat a bleeding episode, hemostatic efficacy rating, and the total dose administered to treat a bleeding 
episode.

Reduction of Pre-Study Prophylaxis Dosing Frequency 
The majority of subjects reduced their pre-study dosing frequency by 30% or more compared to their on-study 
twice weekly dosing frequency. Of a total of 98 subjects who were on a prophylactic regimen, both pre-study and 
during the study, the reduction in dosing frequency during the study was: 
• 30% or more for 69 (70.4%) subjects 
• 20% to < 30% for 1 (1.0%) subject 
• 10 to < 20% for 3 (3.1%) subjects 
• < 10% for18 (18.4%) subjects 
Seven (7; 7.1%) subjects increased or did not change their dosing frequency from pre-study to during the 
study. Of subjects on prophylaxis during the study, 36 had been on ADVATE, and 82 were on other FVIII 
replacement therapies during the year prior to study entry (3 subjects had received both ADVATE and another 
product).

The primary outcome was ABRs. Comparisons between prophylactic and on-demand treatment were based on 
ABR estimates from a negative binomial regression model, taking into account the treatment regimen, target 
joints and age at screening, and duration of the OPE (observation period of efficacy).

STUDY 261202  
This was a Phase 3 prospective, uncontrolled, multicentre study evaluating pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety, 
and immunogenicity of Adynovi (pegylated full-length recombinant FVIII) in previously treated paediatric 
patients with severe haemophilia A 
Study Participants  
Inclusion Criteria 
The main criteria for inclusion were a diagnosis of severe haemophilia A (FVIII <1%) as determined by the 
central laboratory, or a historical FVIII level <1% as determined at any local laboratory and/or a FVIII gene 
mutation consistent with severe haemophilia A. Subjects had to be aged <12 years at the time of screening and, 
based on each subject’s medical records, been previously treated with plasma-derived and/or rFVIII 
concentrate(s) for a minimum of 150 EDs (subjects aged 6 to <12 years) or a minimum of 50 EDs (subjects aged 
<6 years). 
Exclusion Criteria 
The main criteria for exclusion were detectable FVIII inhibitory antibodies (≥ 0.6 BU using the Nijmegen 
modification of the Bethesda assay) as confirmed by central laboratory at screening or a confirmed history of 
FVIII inhibitory antibodies (≥ 0.6 BU using the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay or ≥ 0.6 BU using 
the Bethesda assay) at any time prior to screening. Subjects with a known hypersensitivity towards mouse or 
hamster proteins, PEG or Tween 80, diagnosis of an inherited or acquired haemostatic defect other than 
haemophilia A (e.g. qualitative platelet defect or von Willebrand’s disease) and/or current or recent (<30 days) 
use of other pegylated drugs prior to study participation or scheduled to use such drugs during study 
participation were to be excluded. 
Treatments 
Subjects were to be treated with 50 ±10 IU/kg of Adynovi administered twice weekly. Subjects were to be 
treated with prophylactic infusions for a minimum of 50 EDs to Adynovi or approximately 6 months, whichever 
occurred last. 
Dosing had to be administered twice weekly, at 3- and 4-day intervals (Option X) or 3.5-day intervals (Option Y 
with AM and PM dosing) and was to be maintained during the study. 
Treatment of Bleeding Episodes 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/782768/2017 
Page 59/109 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Adynovi was to be used for the treatment of bleeding episodes (ie, breakthrough bleeding episodes during 
prophylaxis) as soon as possible after occurrence of the bleeding episode, according to the guidelines outlined 
in the table below. 
Table 24 Adynovi treatment guidelines for bleeding Episodes 
The required units were to be calculated according to the following formula: 
body weight (kg) x desired FVIII rise (%) (IU/dL) x {reciprocal of observed recovery} 
A subset of 14 subjects (12 evaluable) within each age cohort was to participate in the PK portion of the study. 
Prior to the start of the 6-month prophylactic treatment they were to undergo a PK analysis with a single dose 
of 60 ±5 IU/kg ADVATE followed by a single dose of 60 ±5 IU/kg Adynovi. 
Objectives 
Primary Objective 
The primary objective was a safety outcome, to assess the incidence of FVIII inhibitory antibodies (≥0.6 
Bethesda units [BU] using the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay). 
Secondary Objectives 
The secondary efficacy objectives were: 
1. To evaluate the PK parameters of Adynovi in paediatric PTPs <12 years of age 
2. To monitor incremental recovery (IR) of BAX 855 over time 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/782768/2017 
Page 60/109 
  
  
 
 
 
3. To evaluate haemostatic efficacy of Adynovi in the management of acute bleeding episodes and for 
prophylaxis over a period of 6 months 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Outcome Measure 
The primary outcome measure was the incidence of FVIII inhibitory antibodies (≥0.6 BU using the Nijmegen 
modification of the Bethesda assay). 
Haemostatic Efficacy 
•  Annualized bleeding rate (ABR) 
•  Consumption of Adynovi: number of infusions and weight-adjusted consumption per month and per 
year 
•  Number of infusions per bleeding episode, overall haemostatic efficacy rating at resolution of bleed 
•  Weight-adjusted consumption per bleeding episode 
The subject’s response to treatment was assessed using a 4-point efficacy rating scale. Since efficacy rating is 
based  to  a  large  degree  on  cessation  of  pain,  the  Investigator/subject  were  to,  in  particular  in  case  of 
injury-related bleeding into one or more than one location, take the injury-related symptoms into consideration 
when performing the efficacy rating at resolution of the bleed. The overall clinical efficacy rating was according 
to the rating scale (refer to table below) at resolution of bleed. 
Sample size 
A total of 50 subjects <12 years evenly distributed between 2 age cohorts of <6 years and 6 to <12 years was 
required. To account for potential drop out of subjects, at least 60 subjects were to be enrolled, with 30 subjects 
in each age cohort. A subset of 14 subjects in each cohort (28 in total) was to undergo a PK assessment with 
Advate and Adynovi to have 12 evaluable subjects in each age cohort. 
Randomisation 
This was an open-label clinical study. There was no randomized allocation to study treatment; all subjects were 
to receive the same dosing schedule of Adynovi. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label clinical study, with all subjects receiving the same dosing schedule of Adynovi. 
Statistical methods 
Statistical Study Conduct 
The  Statistical  Analysis  Plan  (Version  1.2)  was  dated  2015  OCT  15.  Planned  statistical  methods  were  also 
summarized in the study protocol (Amendment 2 version 2015 MAR 20). The following aspects of statistical 
interest were modified: 
PPAS was added for analyses purposes. The efficacy analyses were to be repeated for the PPAS, which was to 
contain all subjects in the FAS who fulfilled the compliance criteria. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/782768/2017 
Page 61/109 
  
  
The set of subjects to be analyzed included all subjects who developed an inhibitor (at any time) and all subjects 
who did not develop an inhibitor and had ≥50 EDs with an assessment of FVIII inhibitors post 50 EDs. 
The ABR was calculated for subjects with less than 6 months of treatment. Since subjects may have bleeds 
without the adequate duration for treatment, excluding criteria of having at least 6 months of treatment was 
removed. 
Analysis Sets 
Full Analysis Set (FAS): The full analysis set (FAS) contained all subjects who received at least 1 dose of Adynovi 
in either the PK part of the study or prophylaxis part of the study. All efficacy analyses were performed on the 
FAS. The FAS was the primary analysis set. 
Adynovi Safety Analysis Set (BSAS): The Adynovi safety analysis set (BSAS) contained all subjects who received 
at least 1 dose of Adynovi. 
Per Protocol Analysis Set (PPAS): The Per Protocol Analysis Set (PPAS) contained all subjects in the FAS who 
fulfilled compliance criteria for prophylactic treatment. The PPAS was to be the supportive analysis set. 
Statistical Analysis Methods 
Inhibitor Rate 
The primary outcome measure of the study was the incidence of FVIII inhibitory antibodies, and the objective of 
the study was to assess the incidence of FVIII inhibitory antibodies during 6 months of twice weekly prophylactic 
treatment with Adynovi or 50 EDs, whichever occurred last. The number and proportion (Clopper-Pearson exact 
95% CI) of subjects who developed inhibitory antibodies to FVIII were to be provided. The set of subjects to be 
analysed included all subjects who developed an inhibitor (at any time) and all subjects who did not develop an 
inhibitor and had ≥50 EDs. Only the inhibitory antibodies developed after the first exposure to Adynovi were to 
be included in the analysis, the inhibitory antibodies developed before the first exposure to Adynovi were to be 
listed separately. 
Number of bleeding episodes during prophylaxis 
The primary measure of haemostatic efficacy was the ABR. The annualised rate of bleeding episodes during 
prophylaxis was to be calculated only for subjects who had adequate treatment time (i.e. 6 months) for ABR 
assessment.  The  observation  period  for  the  prophylaxis  was  to  be  the  time  between  the  first  and  the  last 
prophylactic infusions. The treatment period for surgery was to be excluded from the bleed rate calculation. The 
annualised rate of bleeding episodes were to be calculated as (Number of bleeding episodes/observed treatment 
period in days) * 365.2425. The ABR was to be analysed in a generalised linear model framework assuming a 
negative binomial distribution with a logarithmic link function and presence or absence of target joints and age 
at screening <6 years versus 6 to <12 years as covariates, and the duration of the observation period in years 
as an offset. Point and 95% CIs were to be estimated within this model. 
Haemostatic effect in treatment of bleeding episodes 
The subject’s response to treatment was assessed using a 4-point efficacy rating scale. The proportion of bleeds 
including 95% CIs for the proportion of bleeds with an efficacy rating of “Excellent” and “Good” (summarized as 
one entity) were to be presented. The CI was to be determined using an exact Clopper-Pearson test. The 95% 
CI  was  to  be  compared  to  70%  to  implement  a  hypothesis  of  a  success  rate  of  70%  or  less  against  the 
alternative hypothesis of more than 70% at the 2.5% level of statistical significance.

Protocol Amendments 
Summary of Significant Changes Adopted with Protocol Amendment 1 (2014 NOV 18) 
• The secondary objective “To evaluate changes in HRQoL and health resource use” was changed to become an 
exploratory objective to harmonize objectives with the description of outcome measures in the protocol where 
HRQoL and health resource use are described as exploratory outcome measures. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/782768/2017 
Page 63/109 
  
  
 
 
 
 
• To avoid potential risk of bleeding episodes in the washout period, the inclusion criterion “The subject has 
severe haemophilia A (FVIII <1%) as determined by the central laboratory” was amended to “The subject has 
severe haemophilia A (FVIII <1%) as determined by the central laboratory or a historical FVIII level <1% as 
determined at any local laboratory and/or a FVIII gene mutation consistent with severe haemophilia A”. 
• The threshold for the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay was corrected to ≥ 0.6 BU in the exclusion 
criteria for consistency with the definition for low responder inhibitory antibodies in other parts of the protocol. 
• The planned statistical analysis for the summary PK parameters was amended to follow the approach of Jaki 
and Wolfsegger (non-compartmental estimation of PK parameters for flexible sampling designs) to allow for 
summary PK parameters to be estimated irrespective of the feasibility of the population PK model. 
• The time point after which no other FVIII concentrate other than Adynovi could be administered was clarified. 
• The differential treatment of subjects with bleeding episodes after the start of the Advate PK period and after 
the start of the Adynovi PK period was clarified. 
• The maximum dose of Adynovi for prophylactic treatment was clarified. 
• Clarity was added regarding SAE reporting in subjects with port placement/removal. 
• The subject’s medical history at screening was clarified to include immunization history. 
• An interim analysis could be performed once at least 8 PK evaluations in each of the age cohorts had been 
completed and an adequate number of EDs had been accumulated in each age cohort. 
Protocol Deviations 
Protocol deviations were categorised as major or minor in accordance with the criteria set forth in ICH E3 for 
major deviations. Major deviations were defined as violations from the protocol that were to be evaluated for 
potential impact to the statistical analysis and/or the interpretation, safety and/or efficacy of the IP. Minor 
deviations were all deviations that did not have the potential to impact the safety and/or efficacy of the IP. 
Among a total of 387 protocol deviations in 65/73 (86.7%) subjects enrolled, 380 in 65 subjects were minor and 
only 7 in 5 subjects were major deviations. 
Major protocol deviations included: 
• 2 deviations (Category: Other) involving versioning of IC and signature of IC by one parent only in the younger 
age cohort (Subject 126001) 
• 1 deviation (Category: Other) involving timing of IC signature for prophylactic treatment in the older age 
cohort (Subject 531002) 
• 1 deviation (Category Eligibility) in the older age cohort (Subject 253001); this subject had only 89 pre-study 
exposure days to FVIII and was discontinued from the study by the sponsor 
• 2 deviations (Category: IP Administration) involving drug accountability in the younger age cohort (Subject 
556001) 
• 1 deviation (Category: Protocol Schedule) in the younger age cohort (Subject 527001) involving an IR infusion 
using vials of different lots 
The most frequent minor protocol deviations were procedures not done (189 in 56 subjects, and deviations in 
the category “investigational product administration (112 in 40 subjects).

Baseline data 
Among the 66 subjects who received at least 1 infusion of Adynovi, one (1.5%) was female (Subject 254002), 
all other subjects (98.5%) were male.  
The majority of subjects 43/66 (65.2%) were White, 18/32 (56.3%) in the <6 year and 25/34 (73.5%) in the 6 
to <12 year age cohort. Seventeen of 66 (25.8%) subjects, 10/32 (31.3%) in the <6 year and 7/34 (20.6%) in 
the 6 to <12 year age cohort were Asian. Among the Asians, 1 was Japanese, 4 were Chinese, 2 were Indian, 
and 10 were reported as “other”. Four subjects (4/66; 6.1%) were Black or African American, 2/32 (6.3%) aged 
<6 years and 2/34 (5.9%) aged 6 to <12 years. In the <6 year age cohort, race was indicated as “other” for one 
subject and as “multiple” for another. Four of 66 (6.1%) of subjects, 1/32 (3.1%) in the <6 year age cohort and 
3/34 (8.8%) in the 6 to <12 year age cohort were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. 
The mean (SD) age of all subjects was 6.0 (2.70) years. In the <6 years age cohort, the mean (SD) age was 3.7 
(1.17) years, in the 6 to <12 years age cohort, the mean (SD) age was 8.1 (1.92) years. 
The mean (SD) weight was 17.27 (3.561) kg in the younger and 29.62 (7.599) kg in the older age cohort. The 
mean (SD) height was 103.80 (9.564) cm in the <6 year and 131.92 (12.676) cm in the 6 to <12 year age 
cohort.

The FAS included 66 subjects (65 in the PPAS). Per-protocol analysis set only excluded one subject according to 
the pre-specified criteria. This subject aged 6 to <12 years (Subject 555003) did not qualify for the PPAS 
because the subject infused doses below 40 IU/kg for more than 10% of infusions However, 5 more subjects had 
major protocol deviations and it is not clear whether those have been evaluated for potential impact on the 
statistical analysis and/or the interpretation, safety and/or efficacy of the IP.

A total of 70 treated bleeding episodes occurred in 34 subjects: 25 treated bleeding episodes in 15 subjects in 
the younger age cohort and 45 treated bleeding episodes in 19 subjects in the older age cohort. Twenty four out 
of 65 subjects (37%) experienced no bleeding episodes, 47 out of 65 subjects (72%) experienced no joint 
bleeding episodes, and 43 out of 65 subjects (66%) experienced no spontaneous bleeding episodes on 
prophylaxis. 
 A mean (±SD) of 1.30 (±0.551) infusions (median: 1.00, range: 1.0-3.3) were administered per bleed. The 
mean (±SD) number of EDs for bleed treatment was 2.74 (±2.538) (median: 2.00, range: 1.0-13.0).

The primary outcome was a safety parameter, the incidence of confirmed FVIII inhibitory antibodies (≥ 0.6 BU 
using the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay). 
The proportion of subjects with inhibitory antibody titre ≥0.6 BU after at least 50 ED to treatment with Adynovi 
was 0 (95% CI: 0.00-0.06, n = 57). One (3.1%) subject aged <6 years had inhibitory antibodies to FVIII with 
a titre of ≥0.6 BU at screening (-56 days prior to first infusion of Adynovi) which was not confirmed upon 
re-testing. For 7 subjects (2 subjects aged <6 years and 5 subjects aged 6 to <12 years), the inhibitor titre at 
screening could not be determined. At completion/termination of the study, the FVIII inhibitor titre could also 
not be determined in 7 subjects (3 subjects aged <6 years and 4 subjects aged 6 to <12 years). Reasons were 
predominantly an insufficient quantity of samples, but also the presence of fibrin clots in the sample or no 
specimen received. For one subject who was prematurely withdrawn upon physician’s decision, no sample was 
collected. For the other 6 subjects, results for binding antibodies to FVIII and PEG-FVIII were negative at the 
completion/termination visit which excludes the presence of an inhibitory antibody to FVIII.   
A total of 45 subjects tested negative for binding antibodies at any time point; 16 subjects tested positive for 
antibodies against FVIII, PEG-FVIII or PEG prior to and 5 subjects tested positive after exposure to Adynovi. 
There were no persistent non-neutralising antibodies. No subject had antibodies to Chinese hamster ovary 
(CHO) proteins.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The Applicant has provided an Integrated Summary of Efficacy, which includes data from extension trial 261302. 
A total of 174 subjects contributed a total of 14946 EDs of Adynovi to the Integrated Summary of Efficacy which 
has a total of 25578 EDs of Adynovi. No separate analysis for ABRs or haemostatic efficacy ratings has been 
performed for the extension trial. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
The inclusion of PTPs aged 65 years or older is no guideline requirement. It is not expected that efficacy differs 
in this population from that observed in the younger age groups. Also, there are few data on patients with renal 
impairment, hepatic impairment, and also PUPs.  
Supportive study 
Surgery trial: Study ID 261204 (Interim Clinical Study Report) 
Design 
This was a Phase 3, prospective, open-label, single-group, uncontrolled, multicentre study to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of Adynovi in approximately 40 male PTPs (≥150 EDs), 2-75 years of age, with severe 
haemophilia A (FVIII level <1%), undergoing approximately 50 major or minor elective or minor emergency 
surgical, dental or other invasive procedures. 
Objectives 
Primary: 
• 
Efficacy: To evaluate the perioperative haemostatic efficacy in above mentioned population undergoing 
surgery, as determined by the Global Haemostatic Efficacy Assessment (GHEA) score. 
Secondary: 
• 
• 
Efficacy: Assessment of intra- and post-operative blood loss; transfusion requirement; occurrence of 
bleeding episodes; and daily and total weight-adjusted consumption of Adynovi per subject; 
Pharmacokinetics: Assessment prior to major surgeries (IR, AUC0-∞, AUC0-96h,T1/2,MRT, CL, Vss) 
and IR determination following the initial bolus infusion prior to surgery;

Treatments and dose 
Major surgeries 
Prior to surgery, subjects were to receive a loading dose of Adynovi to raise the plasma level of FVIII to 80-100% 
of normal for major surgeries. After the initial pre-operative loading dose, an optional re-bolus sufficient to raise 
FVIII levels to the appropriate level as defined for the type of surgery may be administered after a blood sample 
for FVIII determination has been drawn (preferably within 6-8 hours following surgery) and the required FVIII 
levels have been determined. The postoperative, pre-infusion FVIII levels should be at least 80% of normal for 
the first postoperative 72 hours and at least 50% on postoperative Days 4-7. From Day 8 until discharge the 
FVIII levels should not fall below 30% or as specified in the substitution plan. 
Minor surgeries 
Prior to surgery, subjects were to receive a loading dose of Adynovi to raise the plasma level of FVIII to 30-60 
% of normal for minor procedures. Postoperatively, subjects undergoing minor surgery can be re-dosed 
postoperatively with Adynovi every 8 to 24 hours. Pre-infusion trough levels of FVIII should be kept at 30-60% 
of normal for the first 24 hours or longer as deemed necessary by the investigator. At least one postoperative 
dose should be given; the dose calculation should be based on the individual IR value determined prior to 
surgery. 
For major surgeries, the preoperative loading dose ranged from 36 IU/kg to 109 IU/kg (median: 68 IU/kg); and 
postoperative total dose ranged from 186 IU/kg to 808 IU/kg (median: 320 IU/kg). The median total dose for 
major surgeries was 380 IU/kg (range: 249-907 IU/kg) and the median total dose of minor surgeries was 100 
IU/kg (range: 76-131 IU/kg). 
Study subjects 
For the interim analysis of study 261204, a total of 21 subjects were enrolled of whom 19 were unique; 2 
subjects re-enrolled. 17 (16 unique) subjects were treated with Adynovi and are included in the safety analysis 
set (SAS). Fifteen (15) subjects completed the protocol and were included in the full analysis set. Each of these 
15 subjects underwent one surgery procedure. All subjects were male and between 19 and 52 years of age. The 
majority of subjects (16/17 subjects) were white, and one subject was Asian. All subjects except one had a 
history of haemophilic arthropathy. 
Surgeries 
The surgical procedures were defined prospectively as major or minor by the investigator/surgeon, based on the 
guidance in the study protocol. 
There were 11 major surgeries: 6 orthopaedic (3 knee replacements, 2 arthroscopic synovectomies, 1 elbow 
cyst extirpation) and 5 non-orthopaedic procedures (3 dental (multiple tooth extractions including 1 radicular 
cyst removal), 1 cardiovascular (mediport placement), 1 abdominal (gastric band insertion)). 
There were 4 minor surgeries: 1 orthopaedic (synoviorthesis), 1 dental, 1 dermatological and 1 endoscopy 
(radiosynovectomy) procedure. 
Efficacy assessment 
Primary objective: Evaluation of the perioperative haemostatic efficacy of Adynovi as determined by the Global 
Haemostatic Efficacy Assessment (GHEA) score

Assessment by the operating surgeon, 3 individual ratings: 
• 
• 
• 
Intraoperative 
Postoperative (on postoperative Day 1, i.e. the day following the day of surgery) 
Perioperative (at discharge or on postoperative Day 14, whichever is first) 
Assessment scale: 
Excellent, Score 3: blood loss was less than or equal to that expected for the type of procedure performed in a 
non-hemophilic population (≤100%) 
Good, Score 2: blood loss was up to 50% more than expected for the type of procedure performed in a 
non-hemophilic population (101-150%) 
Fair, Score 1:  blood loss was more than 50% of that expected for the type of procedure performed in a 
non-hemophilic population (>150%) 
None, Score 0: Uncontrolled hemorrhage that was the result of inadequate therapeutic response despite proper 
dosing, necessitating rescue therapy 
For assessment at discharge visit or on Day 14, whichever is first, required blood components for transfusion 
were also taken into account. 
Interim results: 
Intraoperative: score “excellent” for all 15 procedures. 
Postoperative: score “excellent” for 13 procedures. One minor surgery (subject 117001, minor dermatological 
surgery) was not rated at the time of data cut-off for this report and another minor surgery was rated as “good” 
(subject 104001, minor dental surgery). 
Perioperative: score “excellent” for all 15 procedures.  
Subject 104001 was rated as “good” (score = 2) postoperatively, because he had a small amount of oozing of 
blood from the gums during the night following surgery. After discharge from hospital (6 days after the dental 
surgery), he had a small bleed which was treated with one dose of aminocaproic acid and one dose of Adynovi. 
The bleeding stopped immediately and no other recurrent bleeding occurred after that. The subject had an 
intraoperative blood loss of 5 ml (estimated maximum blood loss predicted preoperatively was 200 mL in a 
haemostatically normal patient) and an FVII activity level at discharge (postoperative day 1) of 33.7 U/dL 
(1-stage clotting assay) or 38.1 U/dL (chromogenic assay). These results are within the recommended 
postoperative range for minor surgeries (30-60% of normal). Therefore, the perioperative haemostatic efficacy 
of Adynovi at discharge was assessed as “excellent” (score = 3). Overall, the global haemostatic efficacy 
assessment score was 8 (3+2+3), which corresponds to a rating of “excellent”.  
Secondary objectives: Determination of intra- and post-operative blood loss, volume of blood, red blood cells, 
platelets, and other blood products transfused, the occurrence of bleeding episodes and additional need for 
surgical intervention, and daily and total weight-adjusted consumption of Adynovi per subject. 
Interim results for blood loss: 
Intra- and Postoperative Blood Loss: Intraoperative blood loss was reported for 11 surgeries (9 major and 2 
minor surgeries. No intraoperative blood loss (i.e. 0 mL) was reported for one major surgery (arthroscopic 
synovectomy) and two minor surgeries (synoviorthesis, radiosynovectomy). With a median observed blood loss 
of 10.0 mL for major surgeries and 2.5 mL for minor surgeries, the actual intraoperative blood loss was 
considerably lower than the predicted average (median) of 50.0 mL for major surgeries and 2.5 mL for minor 
surgeries. The median (Q1; Q3) blood loss observed in major surgeries on postoperative Day 1 was 20.0 (0.0 ; 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/782768/2017 
Page 75/109 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
900) mL (maximum: 1200 mL). This was lower than the median maximum blood loss of 50.0 (0.0; 1200) mL 
predicted preoperatively by the operating surgeons for the types of procedures. 
Consumption of Adynovi: 
Major surgeries (n=11): The mean ±SD actual daily weight-adjusted dose for major surgeries was 34.35 
±16.756 IU/kg (median: 30.26 IU/kg, range: 9.05-99.19 IU/kg). The corresponding planned value was 35.09 
±17.076 IU/kg (median: 30.69 IU/kg, range: 9.05-100.00 IU/kg). 
Minor surgeries (n=4): The mean ±SD daily weight-adjusted dose for minor surgeries was 42.90 IU/kg ±14.839 
IU/kg (median: 41.10 IU/kg, range: 20.76-69.31 IU/kg). The corresponding planned value was 44.70 ±16.353 
IU/kg (median: 41.10 IU/kg, range: 20.76-69.31 IU/kg). 
A sufficient number of surgical procedures (total: 15, major surgeries: 11; additional minor surgeries :4) in 15 
patients was performed with Adynovi to ensure proof of its beneficial effect for a bleeding situation and to fulfil 
the guideline requirements. Type of surgeries included orthopaedic procedures (e.g. knee replacement) and 
therefore represents a sufficiently challenging model. Study population was chosen appropriately. 
The haemostatic effect (primary efficacy endpoint: GHEA score) was assessed as “excellent” for all procedures, 
except one minor surgery which was rated as “good”. Secondary endpoints support this result. Concerning 
secondary endpoint “blood loss”, some patients undergoing major surgeries (almost) matched the statistical 
max. maximum predicted blood loss (e.g. perioperative blood loss in the range of 1210 to 1430 mL, 
postoperative blood loss of 1200 mL); however without exceeding it. Literature also indicates that blood loss in 
such surgery can go up to 2000 mL in healthy patients, thus no causal relationship between these high volumes 
of blood loss and haemophilia A can be drawn. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The design of the two submitted pivotal clinical trials investigating the efficacy (261201 PTPs >12) and 261202 
PTPs ≤12) of Adynovi follows and exceeds the requirements of the current guideline for recombinant FVIII 
products (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009 rev. 1) regarding the number and age distribution of subjects 
included and fulfils the guideline requirements with regards to the number of exposure days observed. In 
addition, the dedicated surgery trial 261204 provides data supporting the efficacy of Adynovi for the 
management of haemostasis in major and minor surgical procedures. Extension trial 261302 is currently 
ongoing and no interim CSR is available. Data from this trial were nevertheless included into the integrated 
summary of clinical efficay.  
A total of 234 subjects received at least one dose of Adynovi. 19 of those subjects were exposed to Adynovi in 
the phase I safety and PK trial 261101. 
In the clinical trials the efficacy of Adynovi was explored for the prevention as well as for the treatment of 
bleeding events. Trial 261201 investigated the efficacy of Adynovi for prophylactic as well as on-demand 
treatment in 137 PTPs >12 years of age (Arm A: prophylaxis with 45 ±5 IU/kg once weekly, 120 subjects; Arm 
B: On demand treatment of BEs, 17 subjects). Trial 261202 investigated the efficacy of Adynovi for the 
prophylaxis and treatment of bleeds in 66 PTPs ≤12 years age at a prophylactic dose of 50 ±10 IU/kg. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/782768/2017 
Page 76/109 
  
  
dedicated surgery trial 261204 contributed data from 11 major and 4 minor surgical procedures in 15 PTPS >12 
to the dossier. The extension trial 261302 in 174 subjects is currently ongoing. 
The investigated patient population was multi-national and included 66 previously treated children (0-<12 years 
of age), adolescents (26 adolescents between 13 and 17 years of age) and adults suffering from severe 
haemophilia A defined as FVIII levels <1%. This fulfils guideline requirements.  
The primary endpoint in the paediatric trial 261202 was the incidence of inhibitory antibodies (inhibitors) against 
FVIII. The endpoints related to efficacy in the pivotal and paediatric trial were defined as follows: Haemostatic 
effect of Adynovi when used for treatment of bleeds (4 point scale); Number of injections of Adynovi required 
per bleeding episode; Consumption of Adynovi; Estimated annualised bleeding rate. All of these endpoints are 
considered appropriate and relevant. 
For the evaluation of the effects of BAX 855 in surgery trial 261204, surgeons’ assessments of subjects’ 
response to surgery on a 4-point scale as well as intra- and postoperative blood loss, transfusion requirements, 
bleeding episodes and consumption were defined as efficacy endpoints, fulfilling guideline requirements. 
In studies 261201 and 261202, discrepancies were noted between major protocol deviations and criteria for 
exclusion from the PPAS. The applicant concluded after a thorough review that 31 major protocol deviations in 
21 subjects in study 261201, and 7 major protocol deviations in 5 subjects in study 261202, were not impacting 
safety, efficacy or data integrity. However, there is an inconsistency between the definition of PPAS and the 
subjects actually selected into that population. Considering that the Full Analysis Set was the primary analysis 
set and that the PPAS was not crucial for the results interpretation, this was considered acceptable. 
Statistical methods in pivotal adult trial 261201  
A hierarchical testing of only one primary endpoint (ABR) first and only thereafter testing efficacy as regards 
hemostatic success in the treatment of bleeds has been predefined. ABRs under prophylactic treatment were 
estimated using a negative binomial regression model. While the statistical analysis model is appropriate, the 
specific comparison against the on-demand treatment arm represents a comparison of different patient 
populations and the interpretation of a 'reduction' of the ABR of at least 50% is not admissible. The applicant 
provided a comparison of the prophylactic efficacy of Adynovi in patients previously on on-demand treatment 
versus patients previously on prophylactic treatment and comparing the prophylactic efficacy of Adynovi to the 
bleeding rate under on on-demand treatment, both in a comparable population of patients previously on 
on-demand treatment. 
For the analysis of the treatment of bleeds; the categorisation of an 'excellent' or 'good' response as treatment 
success and otherwise as failure, increases the interpretability of the outcome on the otherwise 4-point scale. 
The bleeds observed within the study are not independent, but stem from repeated bleeds on the same patients. 
The performed method of a logistic regression model for repeated measurement data is capable to appropriately 
consider the repeated data structure.  
Percentages of subjects in the prophylaxis treatment group were calculated based on 120 subjects, although the 
FAS included 121 subjects. As only one (0.8%) subject is causing the discrepancy in the analysis set, this issue 
was overlooked. 
Among 118 subjects in the PPAS, 40 subjects reported no bleeding episodes, but Success rate of Adynovi for 
treatment of bleeding episodes was based on 70 subjects and not 78 as expected. The applicant confirmed that 
the 8 subjects who were excluded from the analyses actually had reported bleeding episodes. It appears that 7 
of them were incorrectly included in the PPAS as they were either not treated or were treated with Advate 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/782768/2017 
Page 77/109 
  
  
 
instead of Adynovi, which is not in accordance with the definition of the PPAS. Considering that the Full Analysis 
Set was the primary analysis set and that the PPAS was not crucial for the results interpretation, this was 
considered acceptable. 
Statistical methods in paediatric trial 261202 
Inhibitor rate was defined as the primary endpoint and the analysis of the annualised bleeding rate was primary 
among efficacy analyses. The statistical analysis of the primary endpoint of FVIII inhibitory antibodies was 
performed using appropriate exact Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals. The use of a two-sided 95% CI is 
appropriate, but due to the small sample size it is obvious, that this only describes what is scientifically 
demonstrated rather than allowing for an exclusion of a sufficiently small inhibitor rate. 
For the number of bleeding episodes during prophylaxis the annualised bleeding rate was presented based on an 
appropriate Negative binomial regression model, and providing point estimates as well as 95% confidence 
intervals. The ABR estimates were calculated using coefficients proportional to the frequencies of classification 
variables (using 'BYLEVEL OM' as options in the LSMEANS statement) observed in the study, rather than using 
the default parametrisation of equal coefficients across classification effects. This is considered appropriate, as 
the study population is considered representative for the population to be addressed. Also sensitivity analyses 
demonstrated that the two approaches did not provide remarkably different estimates. 
The haemostatic effect in the treatment of bleeding episodes was investigated by categorising an 'excellent' or 
'good' response as treatment success, and otherwise as failure. This increases the interpretability of the 
outcome on the otherwise 4-point scale. The statistical analysis was performed using an exact Clopper-Pearson 
test and 95% confidence intervals, thus ignoring the correlated data structure. Consequently, on request a 
respective additional analysis considering this correlation was provided, and this demonstrated robustness of 
the results. 
The results of the primary analysis of incidence of FVIII inhibitory antibodies in study 261202 were based on 57 
subjects in the Adynovi Safety analysis set. However, a total of 62 subjects have had ≥50 EDs to Adynovi. 
However, as the binding antibodies to FVIII were negative at the study completion/termination for the 5 
subjects who were not included in the primary analysis, presence of a FVIII inhibitor is precluded in these 
subjects. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In the pivotal trial 261201 the mean bleeding rates based on estimates from a negative binomial regression 
model (4.3 and 43.4 in the prophylaxis arm and on-demand arm, respectively) confirm the beneficial effect of 
prophylaxis with Adynovi observed in this trial. These annualised bleeding rates are in the range of published 
results from trials with other licensed FVIII products. A substantial number of subjects in the prophylactic arm, 
45 (37.5%) reported no bleeding episodes during their treatment period. In contrast, all of the 17 subjects in the 
on-demand arm reported bleeding episodes during their treatment period. The study was not randomised; 
subjects were assigned to prophylaxis or on-demand treatment mainly based upon the treatment regimen prior 
to enrollment. Differences in the baseline data were observed between the treatment arms that can be regarded 
as two cohorts, thus a comparison between the treatments regimens was considered with care. 
Regarding the efficacy in the treatment of bleeding events, in 93.1% of bleeds in the prophylactic arm and 
96.6% of bleeding episodes in the on-demand arm, the response to Adynovi was rated as excellent or good. 
81.3% in the prophylactic and 88.1% in the on-demand arm were controlled by 1 injection and 13.5% and 9.1% 
by 2 injections. The median amount of Adynovi needed for the treatment of a bleed was ~ 30 IU/kg. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/782768/2017 
Page 78/109 
  
  
Haemostatic efficacy ratings declined as bleeding episode severity increased; however, the haemostatic efficacy 
of treatment was rated excellent or good for a majority of treated bleeding episodes regardless of severity. 
The guideline requirement to submit data of a minimum of 5 patients undergoing at least 10 surgical procedures 
(comprising major surgeries) is exceeded. In the dedicated surgery trial 261204 the efficacy of Adynovi during 
surgery was investigated through 11 major and 4 minor surgical procedures in 15 subjects. The intraoperative 
efficacy of Adynovi to provide haemostatic control was rated by the operating surgeon as “excellent” for all 15 
procedures.  
The postoperative efficacy of Adynovi, as assessed by the operating surgeon on postoperative Day 1 was rated 
as “excellent” for 13 procedures. One minor surgery was rated as “good” (minor dental surgery) and another 
minor surgery (minor dermatological surgery) was not rated at the time of data cut-off. 
Additional expert consultation 
An ad hoc expert group meeting was convened on 28th November 2016 and were asked to respond to the 
following efficacy question as agreed by CHMP: 
How would you consider the potential clinical treatment benefit that Adynovi could provide in the 
treatment of Haemophilia A? 
Overall, Adynovi has modest benefits in terms of prolonged half-life and reduced frequency of administration. 
The claimed reduction of injections to 2 injections per week may be difficult to achieve in practice as many 
patients would possibly still require 3 injections per week for prophylactic treatment. Equally, a number of 
children are able to achieve adequate prophylaxis with just 2 injections of FVIII. Although it was acknowledged 
that patients using Adynovi 3 times per week would be those requiring a higher trough level and would get 
greater protection from bleeds.  
Lastly, the claimed prolonged half-life is difficult to compare across trials particularly if using different methods 
of analysis.  
Although Adynovi would have represented greater benefits for patients under 12 years (due to lower trough 
levels for activity, vein access and significant reduction in infusions), due to the existing uncertainties and the 
modest benefits, the clinical benefit of the treatment cannot be considered positive in children <12 years old. 
There are concerns about off-label use in children (without any requirement to report adverse events in this 
population). These concerns would have to be adequately addressed with risk-minimisation measures.  
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
In the paediatric population of trial 261202 the point estimate for the mean ABR was 2.37 in the <6 years of age 
cohort, 3.75 in the 6 to ≤ 12 years of age cohort and 3.04 in the total of both age cohorts. The prophylactic dose 
administered was 50 IU/kg twice weekly in both age cohorts. 25/66 (37.9%) subjects had no bleeding episodes 
during the treatment period, 13/32 (40.6%) in the younger and 12/34 (35.3%) in the older age cohort. No 
major bleeds occurred during prophylaxis with Adynovi.  
70 treated bleeding episodes were documented during the trial. For 90% of bleeding episodes in the overall 
population the response to Adynovi was rated as excellent or good, with 96% for younger and 86.6% for older 
children. Overall, 82.9% were controlled by 1 injection (88% in younger and 80% in older children) and 8.6%

by 2 injections (12% and 6.7%). The median amount of Adynovi needed for the treatment of a bleed was ~ 46 
IU/kg in both age cohorts. No new target joints developed during the study. 
The median annual consumption of FVIII was 5543.19 for younger children, 5259.98 for older children and 
5474.14 IU/kg overall, respectively. These values appear comparable to those observed in other licensing trials 
with factor VIII products. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The submitted data are considered sufficient to demonstrate the efficacy of Adynovi for the prevention and 
treatment of bleeding events in patients > 12 years of age with haemophilia A as well as efficacy during surgery. 
Please see discussion and conclusion on safety (sections 2.6.1 and 2.6.2). 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety data on Adynovi are derived from an Integrated Summary/Analysis of Safety which includes 7 
studies, and summaries of the results presented in the individual final clinical study reports from  
3 completed studies:  
•  261101 (Phase 1) 
•  261201 Phase 2/3 (Pivotal) 
•  261202 Phase 3 (Paediatric) 
4 ongoing studies: 
•  261204 Phase 3 (Surgery)  
•  261302 Phase 3b (Continuation) 
•  261203 Phase 3 (PUP) 
•  261303 Phase 3 (PK-guided dosing) 
The cut-off date for the data from the 4 ongoing studies was March 2016. The ISS contains detailed clinical data 
that evaluates the safety profile of Adynovi administered to subjects for prophylaxis, treatment of bleeding 
episodes, perioperative management, or a single-dose for a PK evaluation. Safety in terms of adverse events 
(AEs) and immunogenicity were analysed in the age group relevant per EU Guidance: < 6 years, 6 to <12 years, 
12 to <18 years, and ≥ 18 years. The demographics, extent of exposure, occurrence of AEs, and antibody 
development data were pooled for patients who received at least one infusion with Adynovi at any dose, in the 
above mentioned clinical studies. 
Patient exposure 
There were 243 unique subjects who received at least 1 infusion of Adynovi who participated in the studies, as 
depicted in the flowing chart:

The overall exposure to Adynovi is provided by age group and by reason for treatment is provided in the 
following table: 
Table 33 Summary of exposure to Adynovi by Age group Safety analysis set- Studies 231101, 
261201,261202,261203;261204,261302 and 261303 
Subjects have been exposed for a median (Q1;Q3) of 111.0 (73.0-196.0) exposure days (EDs) during the 
studies. As can be seen in the tables above, adults and adolescents had a higher exposure to Adynovi than the 
younger subjects did. It has to be noted, that the paediatric study 261202 was initiated after the pivotal study 
261201 was completed. The earlier enrolment and therefore longer participation in the continuation study 
261302 might explain the higher exposure in adolescents.  
The mean (SD, minimum-maximum) age was 23.4 (15.35, 0-60) years of age and 1/243 subjects was female. 
Overall, 182 (74.9%) subjects were white, 52 (21.4%) were Asian, 6 (2.5%) were Black or African American, 2 
(0.8%) were “other,” and 1 (0.4%) was “multiple.” The majority of subjects in the integrated analysis were 
adults. Adolescents had the lowest proportion of Asian subjects and the highest proportion of White subjects. 
Overall the majority was white, and not Hispanic/Latino. In the paediatric study approximately half of children 
were < 6 years and half were 6 to <12. There were no children in the surgery trial.  
Adverse events 
A total of 819 AEs were reported in 182/243 (74.9%) subjects during or after treatment with at least 1 infusion 
of Adynovi. The overall rate of AEs by infusion was 2.7% (819 AEs/30,865 infusions), the rate of nonserious AEs 
by infusion was 2.4% (773 AEs/30,865 infusions), and the rate of SAEs by infusion was 0.1% (46 SAEs/30,865 
infusions).

Table 34 Overall summary of treated subjects with Adverse Events (Pooled studies) 
The AEs (regardless of causality or seriousness) that were reported in the highest proportion of subjects were 
nasopharyngitis 17.7%, upper respiratory tract infections 11.1%, headaches (9.9%), pyrexia (8.2%), diarrhoea 
(6.6%), cough (6.6%) and arthralgia (7.4%). 
Noteworthy, the rate of AEs by infusion was similar for the 2 product configurations: Commercial (294 
AEs/10.624 infusions = 2.8%) and non-commercial (346 AEs/14823 infusions = 2.3%). In the case of mixed 
infusions, the rate was 136 AEs/5253 infusions =2.6%). 
During the course of the pivotal study, there was a change in manufacturing facility; from the facility in 
Thousand Oaks (US) to a facility in Neuchâtel (Switzerland). As a result Adynovi was provided from both 
facilities in this study. 17.5% of infusions were with the Neuchâtel product, 80.5% of infusions with Thousand 
Oaks, and 1.2% of infusions with combined, and 0.8% of infusions with unknown product. Since exposure with 
Neuchâtel product was limited, no statistical analyses or comparisons with Thousand Oaks product could be 
conducted. 
Of the 243 subjects, 176 (72.4%) experienced non-serious AEs, including 14 AEs in 10 subjects, which were 
considered possibly or probably related to Adynovi treatment by the sponsor. These related AEs included 
diarrhoea, nausea, headache, and flushing.  
The rate of non-serious AEs by infusion was 2.5% (773 AEs/30,865 infusions). The majority of non-serious AEs 
were mild or moderate in severity. 
-  Mild: 565 AEs, rate of mild AEs by infusion of 1.8% 
-  Moderate: 190 AEs, rate of moderate AEs by infusion of 0.6% 
-  Severe: 17 AEs, rate of severe AEs by infusion of 0.1% 
-  Missing: 1 AE with a missing severity 
Following table displays the AEs that the sponsor assessed as either possibly or probably related to the use of 
Adynovi:

Table  35  Adverse  Drug  Reactions  and  Total  AEs  for  the  selected  ADR  Terms  following  Adynovi 
Treatment 
Common adverse events considered related to Adynovi by the applicant were headache (2.1%) and nausea 
(0.8%). The individual cases of diarrhoea and nausea were assessed as related by both the applicant and the 
investigator due to their temporal relationship to administration. 
From the 14 AEs in 10 subjects, none of these related AEs were serious and no subject has discontinued from 
any study due to 1 of these events. The only common adverse events assessed as related by the sponsor (in ≥
1% of subjects) were headache (2.1%) and nausea (0.8%). This is in consistence with the reported safety 
profile of Advate. 
As stated in the interim analysis of study 261204, no adverse events were considered possibly or probably 
related to Adynovi treatment by the applicant.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
In the pivotal study 261201 one subject (261201-521001) experienced an SAE of neuroendocrine carcinoma 
that resulted in death after withdrawal from the study (CSR 261201). The subject died on 22 Feb 2014, 21 days 
after he discontinued treatment with Adynovi (last infusion on 01 Feb 2014) following withdrawal of informed 
Assessment report

consent on 04 Feb 2014. The SAE was considered not related to study product by the investigator or the 
applicant. No safety concerns arise from this event with fatal outcome. 
Serious adverse events 
A summary of SAEs in the integrated dataset is shown by study below: 
Table 36 Overview of Serious Adverse Events of each study 
There were no SAEs reported in phase 1 study 261101, in the PUP study 261203 (to date), or in the PK-guided 
dosing study 2613013 (to date) and no related SAEs in any of the 5 studies included in the integrated analysis. 
Throughout the 7 studies included in the integrated analysis, there were a total of 46 SAEs that occurred in 
29/243 (10.9%) subjects treated with Adynovi, none of which were considered related to Adynovi as assessed 
by the investigator and the sponsor. 
Other Significant Adverse Events 
Allergic reactions / hypersensitivity reactions 
There were no AEs considered allergic reactions, as assessed by the applicant, reported in any subject in the 
integrated analysis. 
However, there was 1 AE of urticaria/hives considered an allergic reaction by the investigator. Given the allergic 
predisposition of the subject with ongoing preexisting allergic symptoms (Subject 261202-126001), the singular 
occurrence of hives despite continued exposure, the event of urticaria is not considered to be related to Adynovi 
or a hypersensitivity reaction according to the sponsor’s assessment.

analysis set- Studies 231101, 261201,261202,261203;261204,261302 and 261303 
Further data were provided from study 261203 (PUP study) and study 261303 (PK-guided study) until the 
cut-off March 2016. Furthermore the cut-off of the previously submitted studies has been extended from 
October 2015 to March 2016. 
In the newly updated data set, 1 AE of a hypersensitivity reaction and 1 AE of a rash were indentified in subject 
261203- 524001 from the PUP study. Both AEs were considered related to Adynovi based on the investigator’s 
and the applicant’s assessment.  
The 2 year old patient with no pathologic findings in his medical history other than severe haemophilia A, had his 
baseline infusion with Adynovi on 18 January 2016. On 19 January a port was placed at the upper right chest 
wall. The subject received two infusions of Adynovi on the day of surgery (999 IU and 489 IU respectively, 
weight 14 kg) and 3 infusions of 489 IU each on 20 January 2016. He then received once daily infusions of 489 
IU of Adynovi from 21 to 23 January, followed by infusions of the same dose every other day up to 29 January. 
On 20 January, i.e. one day following port placement, the subject was reported to have an itchy rash of mild 
severity which resolved on 1 February 2016. The subject was prescribed 1 mg chlorpheniramine as occasionally 
required to treat the rash which was considered related to Adynovi. No other concomitant medication was 
recorded. On 29 January 2016, when withdrawing the needle following the prophylactic infusion, the subject 
experienced an episode of pallor, flushing and breath holding. Later during this day, the subject developed a 
non-itchy rash over his shoulders and upper arms considered to be a hypersensitivity reaction related to Adynovi 
and the subject was subsequently withdrawn from the study. The subject tested negative for binding antibodies 
to FVIII, PEG and PEG-FVIII at screening, baseline and visit 5 EDs (22 January 2016) whereas at the 
completion/termination visit he was positive for PEG IgG/IgM (1:160) and PEG-FVIII IgG (1:1280)/IgM (1:320). 
However, he tested negative for FVIII IgE and PEG-FVIII IgE antibodies at completion/termination.

Injection site reactions 
Table 38 Adverse Events of Injection Site Reactions 
6 subjects experienced 10 AE that can be considered as reactions related to an infusion. Six of these 10 AEs in 
3 subjects are related to an already inserted central venous device. The remaining 4 AEs in 3 subjects are 
injection site pain (2), vessel puncture site discharge/oozing from venipuncture site (1) and extravasation (1). 
All 4 AEs were mild, assessed as unrelated and all recovered/resolved.

Thrombotic events 
There was 1 non-serious AE of a medical device complication considered a thrombotic event by the investigator 
in the pivotal study 261201. The event was of mild severity, considered not related to Adynovi by the 
investigator and the sponsor, and resolved. 
Table 39 Non serious Adverse Events that occurred during or after Adynovi Treatment –  
Thrombotic events Assessed by the Investigator - Safety analysis set- Studies 231101, 
261201,261202,261203;261204,261302 and 261303 
With regards to Listing 3, the applicant has provided a rationale behind the investigators update removing the 
term thrombotic events from listing 3. According to the applicant the investigators inadvertently listed these two 
AEs, an arthralgia/right elbow pain in 1 patient and a head injury/head injury-bump in 1 patient as a thrombotic 
event. Given the nature of these two AEs, a causal relationship to a thromboembolic event can be ruled out.  
Laboratory findings 
The majority had normal values throughout the study. Abnormal values at baseline are most probably related to 
pre-existing conditions. It is noted that 18 subjects in the pivotal study had significant increases in ALT/AST. 
Most of these subjects had infection or reactivation of hepatitis B or C, or the value is abnormal, but not clinically 
significant. 
In the paediatric study one subject had a significant increase in alkaline phosphatase (together with other 
abnormal values, possibly all accounted for by a viral infection). 
Overall, No trends over time were observed for these clinical chemistry and haematology parameters. Abnormal 
laboratory values were related to the underlying diseases. The data does not imply an impact of Adynovi 
treatment on Laboratory parameters. 
No specific study of hepatic impairment was made. However, patients with history of hepatic associated diseases 
(e.g. Hepatitis B or C) were included as well in the studies without any evidence for a higher risk for these 
patients.

Safety in special populations 
Age of subjects included in the ISS ranged from 1 to 60 years.  
Geriatric Population 
Clinical studies of Adynovi did not include subjects aged 65 and over. Safety of Adynovi could therefore not be 
analysed separately for subjects ≥ 65 years of age. 
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
Clinical experience with Adynovi in pregnant women is not available. Animal reproduction studies have not been 
conducted with Adynovi. It is unknown whether Adynovi can cause fatal harm when administered to a pregnant 
woman or can affect reproduction capacity. 
There is no information regarding the presence of Adynovi in human milk, the effect on the breastfed infant, or 
the effects on milk production. 
Pediatric Population 
Safety and efficacy studies have been performed in 91 previously treated, pediatric patients <18 years of age 
who received at least one dose of Adynovi as part of routine prophylaxis, on-demand treatment of bleeding 
episodes, or perioperative management. 
Adolescent subjects age 12 to <18 (n=25) were enrolled in the adult and adolescent safety and efficacy trial, 
and subjects <12 years of age (n=66) were enrolled in a pediatric trial. 
Regarding children and adolescents, safety has been investigated in 91 previously treated, pediatric patients 
<18 years of age who received at least one dose of Adynovi as part of routine prophylaxis, on-demand 
treatment of bleeding episodes, or perioperative management. Adolescent subjects age 12 to <18 (n=25) were 
enrolled in the adult and adolescent safety and efficacy trial, and subjects <12 years of age (n=66) were 
enrolled in a paediatric trial. 
Children had a similar rate of SAEs/infusion compared to the other age groups. However, they tended to have a 
higher rate of non-serious AEs/infusion. The 4 SAEs in children under the age of 12 (Pancytopenia, febrile 
neutropenia, gastritis, abdominal pain) were not considered related to Adynovi. A greater proportion of adults 
had SAEs than any other age group. The majority of events considered related by the sponsor were reported in 
the adult subjects. A somewhat higher percentage of adolescents tended to have more non-serious AEs than 
subjects in the other age groups. 
Overall, no unexpected safety signals emerged in the paediatric subpopulation.  
Immunological events 
None of the subjects exposed to Adynovi in the integrated analysis developed an inhibitory antibody to FVIII of 
≥ 0.6 BU/mL, including: 
•  191 subjects with ≥ 50 EDs (95% CI: 0.000 to 0.019) 
•  135 subjects with ≥ 100 EDs (95% CI: 0.000 to 0.027) 
•  98 subjects with ≥ 150 EDs (95% CI: 0.000 to 0.037) 
•  52 subjects with ≥200 EDs (95% CI: 0.000 to 0.068)

The assays for the detection of binding antibodies to FVIII, PEG-FVIII and PEG proteins were established in 
compliance with recent regulatory guidelines (Guideline on immunogenicity assessment of 
biotechnology-derived therapeutic proteins. CHMP/BMWP/14327/2006) and following the principles described 
by Whelan et al. A multi-tiered approach including a sensitive ELISA screening assay followed by a confirmatory 
ELISA assay was used. 
For 3 subjects with positive antibody results, based on the previous data provided (data cut- off 2015-10-15) no 
conclusion could be drawn whether these antibodies were of transient or persistent nature. Additional antibody 
data became available for 2 subjects, but not for 1 subject (data cut off 2016-03-01): 
For 1 subject, no final conclusions can be drawn, because data available until the cut-off date 2016-03-01 
suggests an inconclusive pattern with increase of titer at PK baseline and decrease at the 3 months follow up 
visit (prior to data cut off). Further time points are necessary to confirm whether the AB are of transient or 
persistent nature. 
For another subject, subsequent testing of the AB development in the continuation study 261202 were negative. 
Therefore it can be concluded, that the AB development is of transient nature in this subject. 
For another subjects, no further results are available, because the subject was withdrawn from the study due to 
non-compliance with the study procedures. 
For all 3 subjects, the binding AB did not have an impact on efficacy, PK parameters or observed AE.  
According to the newly updated safety data set provided (cut – Off March 2016), the majority of subjects (238/ 
243) in the integrated analysis did not develop a persistent binding antibody response against FVIII, PEG-FVIII, 
PEG, or CHO protein during the studies. 5 of the 243 subjects (3 in the continuation study 261202 and 2 in the 
PUP study 261203) developed binding antibodies to PEG, PEG-FVIII or FVIII at study completion, at several 
visits including study completion, or at data cutoff. Based on the current data no conclusion can be drawn 
whether these antibodies are of transient or persistent nature:   
-  1 Subject developed antibodies against PEG-FVIII 
-  1 Subject developed antibodies against FVIII 
-  1 Subject was positive for IgG antibodies against PEG-FVIII as of the completion/termination visit of 
study 261202/Screening study 261302 up to the 3-month follow-up visit (data cutoff). 
-  1 Subject developed antibodies to PEG-FVIII and PEG which were still present at the time of the data 
cutoff. 
-  1 Subject developed antibodies against PEG and PEG-FVIII at the time of study completion. This 
subject experienced a mild systemic hypersensitivity reaction which was in temporal association 
with the IgG/IgM PEG-FVIII and PEG antibodies whereas he tested negative for IgE antibodies 
against FVIII and PEG-FVIII. 
At current state, no final conclusion on the persistence if the AB can be drawn for the five subjects mentioned 
above. For one subject in the PUP study (261203-524001) a temporal association with an AE related to Adynovi 
cannot be excluded.  
PEG accumulation: 
Cases of cellular vacuolation of the choroid plexus epithelial (ependymal cells) have been observed in 
repeat-dose toxicity studies conducted with proteins PEGylated with molecules ≥  40 kDA 
(EMA/CHMP/SWP/647258/2012). The implication of this finding on humans is not conclusive. Although such 
findings have not been shown in the nonclinical studies conducted so far with Adynovi (20 kD PEG protein part), 
the duration of these studies (up to 4 weeks) may be too short to reveal cellular vacuolation (at least 6 weeks 
according to EMA/CHMP/SWP/647258/2012).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/782768/2017

The applicant  provided further information with regards to AE that were reported beyond the cut-off March 2016 
until the thirty-first of July 2017 from the ongoing studies (Study 261203 – PUP study (subjects <6 years old); 
Study 261302 – Continuation Study (subjects ≤ 75 years old); Study 261303 –  Propel Study (subjects 12 to 65 
years old)) with special focus on AE that might potentially influence the benefit risk balance from a clinical safety 
perspective, such as findings with regards to thromboembolic events, allergic/hypersensitivity reactions, 
inhibitor antibody development or any unexpected safety signals. 
With regards to thromboembolic event, no such events have been reported during the period from March 1, 
2016 to July 31st, 2017.  
FVIII inhibitor development has been observed in one subject in Study 261203 (PUP study). The subject had a 
total of 227 EDs to Adynovi during the trial. The subject underwent an invasive procedure in April 2016 with 
inhibitor titres turned negative and remained negative in October 2016. With regards to a second case of 
inhibitor development (low titre 1.1 BU) which occurred after the cut-of date July, the 31st 2017 in a subject 
currently being treated on an on demand basis at one of the US study sites, the case is currently being reported 
to the regulatory authorities and further observation and information is awaited on this case.  
With regards to hypersensitivity reactions, 2 cases were reported, one in Study 261302 (continuation study) and 
one in Study 261303 (PROPEL study). The subject from the continuation study apparently was found to have an 
allergic predisposition (allergic to the environment in general) with still ongoing symptoms, whereas the 
hypersensitivity reaction of the subject from the PROPEL study was reported as a drug allergy which resolved at 
the time of the data cut-off.   
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No drug interaction studies have been performed. Formal drug-drug interaction studies are generally not 
applicable for coagulation factors and no interactions of human coagulation factor FVIII products with other 
medicinal products have been reported (Core-SmPC for FVIII products). Furthermore, metabolism pathways 
and CYP involvement are not known to exist regarding coagulation factors.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
9 subjects discontinued due to an AE. These include 4 subjects from the completed study 261201 (Pivotal 
study), 1 subject from study 261204 (surgery study), and 3 subjects from the ongoing study 261302 
(Continuation study). None of these subjects discontinued due to an adverse event considered related to 
Adynovi by the applicant. 1 subject from the ongoing PUP 261203 study was discontinued due to an AE 
(Hypersensitivity) considered related to Adynovi by the investigator and the applicant (see also “Other 
Significant Adverse Events” above). 
No subject in study 261101 (Phase 1 study) or subject in study 261202 (Pediatric study) discontinued treatment 
due to an AE.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The clinical development program of Adynovi is in accordance with the current Guideline for Medicinal Products 
for Human Use (CHMP) guideline on the clinical investigation of recombinant and human plasma-derived FVIII 
products. 
A first-in-human prospective, open label, crossover, dose-escalation study (study 261101) was performed to 
evaluate safety and PK parameters of single doses of Adynovi. The study was conducted in adult 
previously-treated patients (PTPs) with severe haemophilia A (FVIII <1%). This phase 1 study included a total 
of 19 evaluable adult PTPs. Based on the results of the phase 1 study, the pivotal, phase 2/3, multicentre, 
non-randomized open label study (study 261201) in adult and adolescent male PTPs with severe haemophilia A 
was performed to evaluate efficacy, safety, and PK parameters of Adynovi and to assess health-related quality 
of life (HRQoL) in subjects using a prophylactic dosing regimen or an on-demand treatment regimen. The study 
included 138 evaluable subjects.  
A study in pediatric PTPs <12 years (study 261202) commenced only after the data of 20 PTPs ≥12 years of age 
who had been treated for ≥50 exposure days (EDs) and the PK data of at least 12 PTPs ≥12 years of age had 
become available in pivotal study 261201. The phase 3, prospective, uncontrolled, multicentre study evaluated 
PK, haemostatic efficacy, safety, immunogenicity and HrQoL of Adynovi and included 66 paediatric subjects who 
received prophylactic treatment. 
Four studies are currently ongoing: 
- 
Study 261204 (surgery): A study in subjects undergoing surgery or other invasive procedures. An 
interim report from this study including 11 major surgeries (6 orthopaedic procedures (3 knee replacements, 2 
arthroscopic synovectomies, 1 elbow cyst extirpation) and 5 non-orthopaedic procedures (3 dental (multiple 
tooth extractions including 1 radicular cyst removal), 1 cardiovascular (mediport placement), 1 abdominal 
(gastric band insertion) and 4 minor surgeries (1 orthopaedic procedure (synoviorthesis), 1 dental, 1 
dermatological and 1 endoscopy (radiosynovectomy) in 15 subjects is available. The results of this interim 
report indicate that Adynovi is safe, well-tolerated for perioperative management. No deaths and no related 
serious adverse events occurred. 
- 
Study 261302 (continuation): A continuation study evaluating safety and efficacy in the prophylaxis of 
bleeding in subjects who have completed previous Adynovi studies. After closure of enrollment for paediatric

study 261202 and pivotal study 261201, the continuation study is open also to Adynovi naïve paediatric and 
adolescent/adult patients.

Study 261303 (PK-guided dosing): A study to compare the safety and efficacy of PK guided Adynovi 
prophylaxis targeting two different FVIII trough levels. This study is open to subjects who previously completed 
another Adynovi study as well as to newly recruited subjects. 
An adequate number of PTP subjects have been included to evaluate the safety profile of Adynovi. Adynovi was 
well tolerated in 243 PTPs with severe haemophilia A from 3 completed (261101, 261201 and 261202) and 4 
ongoing (261204, 261302, 261203 and 261303) studies who were treated with Adynovi for prophylaxis, 
bleeding episodes, and perioperative management or who received a single-dose for a PK evaluation. 
One hundred and eighty-eight subjects were treated long-term with Adynovi, by initiating treatment in the 
phase 1 study, pivotal study, the paediatric study, and the surgery study, and continuing in the ongoing 
continuation study (Cut Off March2016).  
The baseline data shows that the majority of subjects were white. In the paediatric trial there were fewer 
subjects with target joints and arthralgia compared to the adult subjects, which is expected. 
One previously untreated patient in the PUP study 261203 experienced 2 AEs related to Adynovi (minor rash and 
a mild systemic hypersensitivity reaction) after submission of the MAA. Although both AEs resolved, the subject 
was withdrawn from the study.  
Section 4.8 of the SmPC has been adopted accordingly in order to include the AE “Hypersensitivity” and “rash” 
in the ADR table. 
None of the subjects developed inhibitory antibodies to FVIII of ≥0.6 BU/mL. No persistent binding antibodies to 
FVIII, PEG-FVIII or PEG developed. 5 subjects (study 261202/study 261302) had antibodies at the time of data 
cut-off (March 2016), For one subject in the PUP study (261203-524001) a temporal association with an AE 
related to Adynovi could not be excluded. The applicant claims that no causal relationship of antibodies with AEs 
or increased occurrence of spontaneous bleeding episodes could be observed. The applicant agreed to follow-up 
on this issue when providing the final study results of the ongoing studies (please see RMP section). This is 
considered acceptable, however if new data becomes available which could impact on the safety assessment, 
the applicant is reminded of its legal obligation to provide these data to the Agency. “Anti-PEG FVIII antibodies” 
has been added as an important potential risk as part of the safety specification in the RMP. 
A mild thrombotic event was identified but this was not considered to be related to Adynovi by the investigator 
and the applicant. This was considered acceptable. 
There were no trends observed over time for clinical chemistry, haematology and lipid parameters or for vital 
signs. Laboratory Shift Tables by Category and Variable for study 261202 (paediatric study) did not indicate 
significant changes with regards to relevant chemistry parameters such as creatinine, blood urea nitrogen or 
total protein or albumin. 
A total of 46 SAEs in 29 subjects were reported. None of which were considered related to Adynovi as assessed 
by the investigator and the applicant. The safety profile for the paediatric population did not raise any safety 
concerns compared to adolescents and adults included in the studies.

The common adverse events assessed as related by the applicant (in ≥1% of subjects) were headache (2.1%) 
and nausea (0.9%). This is comparable with the reported safety profile of Advate and has been reflected in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Cellular vacuolation associated with PEG accumulation 
With regards to the safety of PEG and pegylated Pharmaceuticals, the EMA CHMP Safety Working Party 
discussed the risk for ependymal cell vacuolation caused by PEG (mainly >40 kDa) at an exposure of ≥ 0.4 
µmol/kg/month. For Adynovi, the clinical PEG exposure of 6.4 μg PEG/kg BW (70 IU) per day ranges 125 times 
below the threshold of 0.4 μmol/kg/month. In the repeat dose toxicity study in Cynomologous monkey for 
Adynovi, two animals showed vacuolation in the kidney in the mid dose group (350IU/kg). The vacuolations did 
not recover after 2 weeks. In addition, it is highlighted that the applicant did not perform non-clinical studies 
with an acceptable duration (studies lasted up to 4 weeks at most), in comparison with at least 6 weeks 
requested according to EMA/CHMP/SWP/647258/2012.  
The human relevance of kidney vacuolation observed in the preclinical study is unknown. No adverse reactions 
associated with PEG accumulation were seen in the submitted clinical trials. Uncertainties regarding the relation 
between formation of vacuoles and the duration of exposure still remain, especially for the paediatric population.   
Duration  of  treatment  with  Adynovi  would  be  life-long  and  it  is  to  be  expected  that  unfavourable  effects 
associated with accumulation of PEG would only be detected after long-term exposure over several years. It 
might be expected that e.g. renal failure or consequences of diminished function of the choroid plexus only occur 
after  treatment  for  several  years,  manifesting  with  potentially  unspecific  signs  and  symptoms  that  develop 
insidiously over time. Additionally, it is currently unclear which clinical signs or symptoms could optimally serve 
as (early) markers for negative effects caused by accumulation of PEG in certain tissues/organs.  
Based on evidence presented in this dossier, a possible impact of accumulation of PEG in tissues on clinical 
safety after long-term treatment cannot be excluded with reasonable certainty. However, available safety data 
derived  in  clinical  trials  with  Adynovi,  although  limited  with  regards  to  the  number  of  patients,  treatment 
duration and absence of specific monitoring for PEG-associated adverse events, do not reveal any signals hinting 
to negative effects of PEG accumulation. Moreover, there are a number of other pegylated medicinal products 
available on the market. Although most of them are intended for short-term treatment and those which can be 
administered chronically are only licensed for the adult population (e.g. Cimzia), supporting evidence derives 
from the safety databases of these products including post marketing data. To date there are no safety concerns 
with  regards  to  PEG  accumulation  arising  from  clinical  trials  and  post  marketing  data  from  these  pegylated 
products, including pegylated products intended for the chronic treatment of adults.  
Therefore, a licence for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in haemophilia A patients with Adynovi can be 
granted for the adult population.  
In  contrast,  the  paediatric  population  is  considered  more  vulnerable  and  sensitive  to  potential  detrimental 
effects of chronic administration of medicinal products due to the ongoing development of the brain and growth 
of the body. As the magnitude of clinical consequences of the preclinical findings regarding PEG accumulation in 
the  choroid  plexus  and  certain  tissues/organs  are  unclear  and  no  reassuring  experience  with  long-term 
treatment with other licensed PEGylated products is available in this population, life-long treatment of Adynovi 
cannot be recommended for paediatric patients in general. The applicant has proposed a licence in adolescent 
patients 12 years and above which might be acceptable for the following reasons: Excluding children below 12 
years  of  age  will  reduce  the  PEG  load  arising  from  prophylactic  treatment  with  Adynovi  during  the  entire 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/782768/2017 
Page 94/109 
  
  
 
 
 
 
childhood. Moreover, most neurodevelopmental milestones are reached in children 12 years of age. Therefore, 
the potential risks associated with PEG accumulation/vacuolation can be seen differently in children below or 
above 12 years of age. In consequence, the benefit risk balance has to be assessed separately for all age groups 
and an indication above 12 years of age can be granted.  
Finally, the CHMP is requesting the company to conduct an imposed study in order to investigate the potential 
effects of PEG accumulation in the choroid plexus of the brain and other tissues/organs according to an agreed 
protocol.  The  applicant  is  recommended  to  discuss  the  details  of  this  post-authorisation  safety  study  in  a 
scientific advice procedure. In addition, the MAH shall submit the first periodic safety  update report for this 
product within 6 months following authorisation. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary 
of Product Characteristics. 
Additional expert consultations 
An ad hoc expert group meeting was convened on 28 November 2016 and the experts were asked to respond to 
the following questions as agreed by CHMP: 
Cellular vacuolation of the choroid plexus epithelial cells has been observed in non-clinical studies 
with≥ 40kDa PEGylated proteins. Could the experts discuss the relevance of these findings and if 
possible describe potential risks if such accumulation also would occur in humans with special 
consideration of: 
- prolonged (possibly life-long) treatment 
- specific problems in children/adolescents 
With regards to the vacuolation it is not clear based on current knowledge what is the translation to humans and 
actual clinical impact. On one hand, lack of significant clinical findings, evidence of a steady-state, the relatively 
small PEG molecule and the animal PK studies are reassuring. On the other, the duration of the repeat dose 
toxicity study is too short to draw firm conclusions as to the absence of long-term effects and long-term safety 
in human are lacking (current duration of follow-up with PEG-rFVIII is in the order of a few years). Thus, 
detrimental effects cannot be excluded, especially in younger patients and in case of prolonged treatment.  
In the absence of a clear understanding of the distribution and elimination of rurioctocog alfa, especially when 
the B domain is cleaved from the active protein, it is not possible to fully determine the distribution in human and 
potential risks of accumulation of PEG in human. Due to these uncertainties and the modest benefits (see 
below), the clinical benefit of the treatment cannot be considered positive in children <12 years old. 
A thorough evaluation of the elimination routes and metabolism mechanisms of PEG would be useful to address 
these uncertainties.  
There is a need to monitor any adverse effects on renal function including proximal tubular and glomerular 
damage using sensitive markers (serum creatinine clearance and albuminuria might not be sufficient, especially 
in children, for early detection of albumin and protein in urine). 
Possible studies were discussed, including clinical, non-clinical studies and post marketing surveillance. There 
were different views on the design and feasibility of clinical studies. According to some, clinical studies could be 
considered. According to others, non-clinical studies in primates could be considered (studies with other species 
are unlikely to be informative in view of anti-drug antibodies formation after a few weeks of exposure). In any 
Assessment report

case, the experts agreed on the need for marketing surveillance reporting and regular updates on long-term 
exposure data. 
Would you consider that the risk of cellular vacuolation of the choroid plexus epithelial cells as 
observed with ≥ 40kDa PEGylated proteins as well as potential damage to renal function is less 
likely if a PEG moiety with a lower molecular weight is used (e.g. 20 kDa as for rurioctocog alfa)? 
Although damage to renal function is less likely for a PEG moiety with a lower molecular weight (e.g. 20kDa), 
uncertainty remains with regards to the distribution of the product and how the product behaves. It is not 
understood how the 20 kDa PEG can be eliminated more easily as it is bound to the B domain of FVIII molecule 
when FVIII is activated. When PEG is cleaved with the B-domain, the molecule is broken down and is potentially 
able to cross the epithelial cells if not yet metabolised and eliminated. No biodistribution data in humans are 
available and these would be needed in order to fully understand the elimination pathway. Monitoring kidney 
function especially glomerular and tubular function, plasma and urine is recommended (see answer to question 
No. 1). 
How manageable could be a risk related to PEG accumulation in brain structures? Are there 
solutions to follow and monitor patients and to detect and/or to prevent or reverse adverse events 
related to PEG accumulation? 
Considering the limited non-clinical data available, the difficulty to monitor PEG accumulation as no biomarkers 
are available and that no long term safety data in humans for Adynovi are available, no conclusions can be 
drawn with regards to the possibility of managing accumulation in brain structures and potential clinical 
consequences. In clinical practice, it may not be possible to conduct frequent MRIs unless clinically indicated. 
Due to these uncertainties and the modest benefits, the clinical benefit of the treatment cannot be considered 
positive in children <12 years old. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
Please refer to the above discussion. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Based on data submitted within this dossier and clinical experience gained with other pegylated products, a 
licence for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in haemophilia A patients with Adynovi can be granted for 
the adult population and paediatric patients 12 years of age and above.  
The CHMP considers the following imposed Post-Authorisation Safety Study necessary to address issues related 
to safety: 
In order to investigate the potential effects of PEG accumulation in the choroid plexus of the brain and other 
tissues/organs, the MAH should conduct and submit the results of a post-authorisation safety study according to 
an agreed protocol. The applicant is recommended to discuss the details of this post-authorisation safety study 
in a scientific advice procedure. In addition, the MAH shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this 
product within 6 months following authorisation.

Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant 
show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of 
the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Adynovi (rurioctocog alfa pegol) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance and has an imposed PASS.   
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Haemophilia A is a rare and serious, X-linked, recessive bleeding disorder that predominantly affects males and 
is characterized by a deficiency of FVIII. In patients with haemophilia A, the primary platelet-driven hemostasis 
is not affected, but generation of a stable, fibrin-rich clot is defective because inadequate amounts of thrombin 
are generated. Affected patients suffer from both spontaneous, non-traumatic bleeding episodes as well as 
substantially prolonged bleeding episodes upon injury. Rarely, life-threatening bleeding may also occur. 
Patients exhibit variable clinical phenotypes depending on the extent of residual activity (%) of the deficient 
FVIII that is used to classify the disease severity (WFH, 2012): 
• 
• 
• 
<1% FVIII activity: severe haemophilia A 
1% to 5% FVIII activity: moderate haemophilia A 
5% to 40% FVIII activity: mild haemophilia A 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/782768/2017 
Page 100/109 
  
  
Patients with severe haemophilia A bleed spontaneously into joints and muscles, which often results in 
permanent, disabling joint damage. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Standard treatment for haemophilia A patients is the replacement of the missing protein by infusion of 
exogenous FVIII concentrates (as plasma-derived FVIII [pdFVIII] or recombinant FVIII [rFVIII] concentrates). 
Treatment regimens are either on-demand therapy (given when a bleed occurs) or prophylaxis (which consists 
of regular infusion of FVIII given every 2 to 3 days to prevent bleeding). In the short term, prophylaxis can 
prevent spontaneous bleeding and in the long term, prophylaxis can prevent bleeding into joints that will 
eventually lead to debilitating arthropathy. 
Prior to the introduction of clotting factor concentrates in the 1960s, the prognosis for haemophilia A patients 
was poor, average life expectancy being 15 to 25 years. Major advances in the safety of clotting factor products, 
including the availability of rFVIII concentrates, the availability of comprehensive haemophilia A treatment 
centres, the institution of routine prophylaxis, the introduction of home treatment, as well as the active roles 
that patients take in self-advocacy, have enabled patients with haemophilia A to lead a “close to normal” life. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Three trials have been completed in previously treated adolescent and adult patients. Four studies are on-going.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The altered PK parameters of Adynovi were characterised in direct comparison to its parent molecule, Advate. In 
the pivotal trial, the mean half-life of Adynovi was found to be 14.30 hours and that of Advate 10.40 hours with 
the one-stage assay in 26 patients. In general, AUC, t1/2 and MRT were higher and clearance and Vss lower for 
Adynovi, while incremental recovery appeared to be similar for both products. The average ratio between the 
1-stage clotting and the chromogenic assays for estimation of FVIII activity levels were relatively similar for 
Advate (0.89) and Adynovi (0.81). 
A total of 243 subjects received at least one dose of Adynovi. The investigated patient population was 
multi-national and included 66 previously treated children (0-<12 years of age), 6 PUPs (<6 years of age), 
adolescents (26 adolescents between 13 and 17 years of age) and 145 adults suffering from severe haemophilia 
A defined as FVIII levels <1%. The pivotal study 261201 was an open-label, non-randomised study, with two 
treatment arms, one with prophylactic regimen with Adynovi at a dose of 45 ± 5 IU/kg twice weekly (n=120) 
and one arm with on-demand treatment at a dose of 10 to 60 IU/kg (n=17). The mean bleeding rates based on 
estimates from a negative binomial regression model (4.3 and 43.4 in the prophylaxis arm and on-demand arm, 
respectively) confirm the beneficial effect of prophylaxis with Adynovi. The paediatric study 261202, was a 
single-arm, open-label study, with 66 severe haemophilia A subjects divided into two age cohorts; < 6 years 
(n=32) and 6 to < 12 years (n=34). Subjects were to receive prophylactic treatment with 50 ± 10 IU/kg BW 
twice weekly. The point estimate for the mean ABR was 2.37 in the <6 years of age cohort, 3.75 in the 6 to ≤
12 years of age cohort and 3.04 in the total of both age cohorts.  
With regards to haemostatic efficacy in the treatment of bleeding events, in 93.1% of bleeds in the prophylactic 
arm and 96.6% of bleeding episodes in the on-demand arm, the response to Adynovi was rated as excellent or 
good. 81.3% in the prophylactic and 88.1% in the on-demand arm were controlled by 1 injection and 13.5% and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/782768/2017 
Page 101/109 
  
  
9.1% by 2 injections. The median amount of Adynovi needed for the treatment of a bleed was ~ 30 IU/kg. In 
total, 591 bleeding events were treated with Adynovi in the pivotal trial. In the paediatric trial, 70 treated 
bleeding episodes occurred. For 90% of bleeding episodes in the overall population the response to Adynovi was 
rated as excellent or good, with 96% for younger and 86.6% for older children. Overall, 82.9% were controlled 
by 1 injection (88% in younger and 80% in older children) and 8.6% by 2 injections (12% and 6.7%). The 
median amount of Adynovi needed for the treatment of a bleed was ~ 46 IU/kg in both age cohorts.  
Major surgery is a challenging model to establish the haemostatic efficacy of a new coagulation factor. In the 
dedicated surgery trial 261204 the efficacy of Adynovi during and after surgery was investigated for 11 major 
and 4 minor surgical procedures in 15 subjects. All evaluable surgeries were assessed as excellent or good by 
the surgeon. The actual maximum intraoperative blood loss was lower than the predicted loss for healthy 
individuals. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
From a methodological point of view, for the pivotal trial 261201 the comparison against the on-demand 
treatment arm represents a non-randomized comparison against a different patient population and the 
interpretation of a 'reduction' of the ABR of at least 50% from this analysis is inappropriate. However, the 
applicant provided additional analyses on the ABR in order to allow for further assessment of the prophylactic 
efficacy of Adynovi. This included a within treatment arm analysis of individual on-study versus pre-study 
bleeding rates using a repeated negative binomial regression model considering the repeated data structure 
within subjects. In addition, subset analyses comparing bleeding rates on prophylaxis with Adynovi to patients 
on on-demand Adynovi treatment, both restricted to patients previously on on-demand treatment, as well as 
the bleeding rate under Adynovi prophylaxis when comparing patients previously on on-demand treatment to 
patients already previously on prophylaxis provided support for the conclusion of efficacy of Adynovi. 
For the paediatric study 261202 ABRs were calculated using a negative binomial regression model. However, 
this was considered appropriate. Estimates for ABRs were calculated using weights proportional to the 
frequencies of classification variables observed in the study, rather than using the default parametrisation of 
equal coefficients across classification effects. This relates to the question on what is to be estimated, i.e. the 
estimand, and it is agreed that this proportional weighting represents a reasonable approach in this study as the 
study population is considered representative of the target population.  
No patients >65 years of age were included in the studies. There is, however, no reason to expect a different 
efficacy profile in elderly haemophilia patients as compared to the population studied.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
A non-pegylated in-house reference standard is used for potency measurement of a modified (pegylated) FVIII 
preparation. Full dose-response curves (including asymptote values) have been provided and verify that the 
in-house reference standard (HL3AR), Adynovi and the WHO IS behave similarly in both potency assays. 
However, an observed shift in the assigned value of the current in-house reference standard HL3AR when 
compared to the WHO IS8, relates to incorrect potency assignment of the previous in-house Reference Standard 
08/104. The applicant has changed the specification limits for potency to correct values in IU. Since this leads to 
an incorrect potency labelling in IU, the applicant has to perform a reassessment of the shift and the 
specification limits when more data are available. Also further verification of acceptable performance of the 
chromogenic potency assay in relation to the Ph. Eur method should be verified post approval. Both of these 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/782768/2017 
Page 102/109 
  
  
points will provide confirmation that potency is satisfactorily aligned with the labelled potency in international 
units and to verify that the same dosage as used in the clinical trials will be delivered by the commercial product. 
Adynovi was well tolerated in 243 PTPs with severe haemophilia A in 3 completed (261101, 261201 and 261202) 
and 4 ongoing (261204, 261302, 261203 and 261303) studies who were treated with Adynovi for prophylaxis, 
bleeding episodes, and perioperative management or who received a single-dose for a PK evaluation. The 
common adverse events are headache, diarrhoea, nausea and rash.  
There were no AEs of allergic reactions considered to be associated with Adynovi. There was 1 AE of 
urticaria/hives in study 261202 in a patient with known allergic predisposition and there was no reoccurrence of 
hives despite continued exposure. 1 AE of a hypersensitivity reaction and 1 AE of a rash were identified in 1 
patient from the PUP study related to Adynovi and the subject was withdrawn from the study. 2 cases of 
hypersensitivity reactions were reported, one in Study 261302 (continuation study, subject with allergic 
predisposition with still ongoing symptomatic) and one in Study 261303 (PROPEL study, subject with reported 
drug allergy which resolved at the time of the data cut-off). It is known for FVIII products that hypersensivity 
reactions are possible and this is reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC. In addition, hypersensitivity to the active 
substance, to the parent molecule octocog alfa or to any of the excipients A has been added as a contraindication 
in section 4.3 of the SmPC.  
1 PUP patient in Study 261203 (PUP study) developed neutralising antibodies (inhibitors). The subject had a 
total of 227 EDs to Adynovi during the trial. There was a second case of inhibitor development (low titre 1.1 BU) 
in a patient currently being treated on an on demand basis at one of the US study sites, the case is currently 
being reported to the regulatory authorities and further observation and information is awaited on this case. The 
risk of anaphylaxis and the correlation between the occurrence of FVII inhibitors and allergic reactions is known 
for FVIII products and is reflected in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC for Adynovi. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
In the repeat dose toxicity study in Cynomologous monkey, two animals showed vacuolation in the kidney in the 
mid dose group (350IU/kg). The vacuolations did not recover after 2 weeks.  
In addition, nonclinical data were limited to 1 month exposure and no studies in juvenile animals were conducted 
with Adynovi. The non-clinical toxicity data lack to cover the pediatric population below 12 years. Although no 
neurological symptoms (e.g. tremor) occurred in the clinical studies, accumulation of PEG with possible 
long-term consequences poses a conceivable risk. Hence, the observed non-clinical effects of the PEG moiety of 
the molecule are of unknown clinical relevance. It is to be expected that unfavourable effects associated with 
accumulation of PEG would only be detected after long-term exposure over years.  
The safety database is relatively small although it exceeds the guideline requirements. The limited number of 
subjects only allows for the detection of common and very common adverse events. 
The clinical trial programme was not prospectively designed to investigate possible clinical effects of PEG 
accumulation/vacuolation on the function of presumed main target organs. Accumulation of PEG after long-term 
treatment has been added as an identified potential risk in the RMP (see section 3.6). The database for Adynovi 
will be expanded by data gathered in the ongoing studies (extension studies and PUPs study). In addition, the 
MAH will have to submit the results of an imposed PASS in order to investigate the possible effects of PEG 
accumulation in the choroid plexus of the brain and other tissues and organs. Finally, the MAH shall submit the 
first periodic safety update report for this product within 6 months following authorisation.

5 subjects (3 in study 261202 and 2 in study 261302) had PEG-FVIII, FVIII or PEG antibodies at the time of data 
cut-off (March 2016). However, no final conclusion on the persistence or transience of binding antibodies can be 
drawn yet. After the cut-off of the current updated data set (July, the 31st 2017) a new confirmed low titre (1.1 
BU) inhibitor was reported during the last week of August 2017 which occurred in a subject who was treated on 
an on-demand basis at one of the US study sites. This case is currently being reported to the regulatory agencies 
and further observation and information is awaited. “Anti-PEG FVIII antibodies” has been added as an important 
potential risk as part of the safety specification in the RMP.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The amount of experience in treatment of bleedings and prophylaxis from the performed studies is deemed to 
be sufficient to conclude that the haemostatic properties of Adynovi are consistent with what is usually observed 
for other FVIII preparations. The observed major differences in bleeding rates between patients on prophylaxis 
and the limited number of patients on on-demand treatment are as expected and are also in line with what has 
been observed in studies of approved FVIII preparations.  
In addition to the demonstration of reduced bleeding rates the applicant has demonstrated a slower elimination 
rate as compared to the non-pegylated corresponding rFVIII molecule with a resulting extended half-life (by 
approximately 50% on average) in adolescents and adults. The extended elimination allowed less frequent 
administration in several subjects of the severe haemophilia population studied. The difference between 
administrations thrice or twice weekly may not appear impressive but 50 less infusions over a year is most 
probably appreciated by many patients. For other patients, e.g. physically active patients, it may be more 
important to achieve higher trough levels without changing the administration frequency.

Regular administration of Adynovi was able to resolve target joints: over the course of both studies (261201, 
261302 both in PTPs ≥12), for 51 subjects treated twice weekly with Adynovi for ≥18 months, 36/51 patients 
reported 89 target joints at baseline. After 18 consecutive months of twice weekly prophylaxis with Adynovi, 
75/89 target joints had resolved. 
The most common side effects are headache, diarrhoea, nausea and rash. The nature and frequency of adverse 
events does not give rise to concern and do not reveal unexpected safety signals.  
Based on evidence presented in this dossier, a possible impact of accumulation of PEG on function of affected 
tissues/organs after long-term treatment cannot be excluded with reasonable certainty. However, available 
safety data derived in clinical trials with Adynovi, although limited with regards to the number of patients, 
treatment duration and absence of specific monitoring for PEG-associated adverse events, do not reveal any 
signals hinting to negative effects of PEG accumulation. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Pertaining to the preclinical and clinical data, the beneficial effects of Adynovi with regards to its ability to replace 
functional factor VIII and thus to prevent and treat bleeding events and to allow major surgery in patients with 
severe haemophilia have been satisfactorily shown at an improved treatment interval compared to conventional 
FVIII products. Furthermore, trough levels in the range of mild haemophilia or even healthy subjects can be 
reached throughout the majority of the treatment interval which may be a specific advantage of Adynovi as this 
is likely to have a beneficial impact on target joints, preserve joint function and leads to less morbidity and 
orthopaedic long-term consequences.  
Based on the data from clinical trials with Adynovi and safety data of licensed pegylated products for chronic use 
in the adult population, approval for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in haemophilia A patients with 
Adynovi can be granted for the adult population.  
The provided safety data did not give rise to concern with regards to the short-term treatment of patients. 
However, unfavourable effects associated with accumulation of PEG in the choroid plexus of the brain or other 
tissues or impairment of neural development might only become symptomatic after long-term exposure over 
several years. No supportive safety data from other pegylated products intended for chronic use are available for 
the paediatric population. With regards to children below 12 years, at present there is not enough data to 
conclude and the company should provide additional efficacy and safety data with special considerations on 
dosing intervals and dosing regimen showing efficacy with even lesser injections. Therefore, the indication in the 
entire paediatric population cannot be granted. However, the benefit-risk balance has to be seen differently in 
adolescents compared to children below 12 years of age. Most neurodevelopmental milestones are reached in 
children below 12 years of age. Moreover, according to literature the treatment compliance generally declines 
when patients pass from childhood to adolescence. Prophylactic treatment with Adynovi in adolescents with 
thrice or twice injection per week may lead to improved treatment compliance, could reduce bleeding rates and 
improve joint health in this patient population and could allow an improved quality of life, thereby outweighing 
the risks/uncertainties in relation to PEG accumulation and vacuolation. 
Considering the above, the CHMP has imposed to the MAH to conduct and submit the results of a PASS in order 
to investigate the potential effects of PEG accumulation in the choroid plexus of the brain and other tissues and 
organs according to an agreed protocol. The MAH is recommended to discuss the details of the PASS in a 
scientific advice procedure. In addition, the MAH shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this 
product within 6 months following authorisation.

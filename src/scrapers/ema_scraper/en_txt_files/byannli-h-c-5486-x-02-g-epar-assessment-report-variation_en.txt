1.4.  Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
1.4.1.  Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan 
medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the 
proposed indication.  
1.5.  Scientific advice 
The PP6M product has been developed for the treatment of schizophrenia in adult patients who have been 
adequately treated with PP1M preferably for four months or more or PP3M for at least one injection cycle. The 
Phase 3 clinical program was designed so that patients were stabilized on either PP1M or PP3M prior to 
conversion to PP6M.  
Clinical development of PP6M began in 2017. The development program for PP6M in the treatment of 
schizophrenia is composed of 2 Phase 3 studies: 1 pivotal, non-inferiority study and 1 open-label extension 
study: 
•  Study  R092670PSY3015  (completed)  –  multinational,  randomized,  double-blind,  active-controlled, 
non-inferiority  study  to  compare  PP6M  with  PP3M  in  adults  with  schizophrenia  previously  stabilized  on 
corresponding doses of PP1M or PP3M.  
•  Study R092670PSY3016 (ongoing) – multinational, single-arm 24-month open-label extension to Study 
R092670PSY3015 in selected countries intended to provide access to PP6M in subjects with schizophrenia 
completing the PSY3015 study without relapse and to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of PP6M.  
In addition, the objectives of the PK development program for PP6M included: 
•  Characterize the PK of paliperidone after gluteal injections of PP6M for subjects randomized in Study 
PSY3015 
• 
• 
Provide individual estimates of the secondary pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e. AUC for the 
considered dosing interval [AUCtau], AUC for a 6-month dosing period [AUC6months], through 
concentration [Ctrhough] and Cmax) 
Evaluate common clinical questions and dosing scenarios through simulations using the population PK 
model of PP6M 
Consistent with the approach used in the EU registration procedures for PP1M and PP3M, data from elderly 
PK, drug-drug interaction, renal-impairment and hepatic-impairment studies from the paliperidone ER 
program (EMEA/H/C/746) are used to support the current application for PP6M given that paliperidone 
palmitate is completely hydrolysed to circulating paliperidone after IM injection and various intrinsic and 
extrinsic factors are not expected to differentially affect absorption of paliperidone after it is released in 
muscle tissue.  
The development program for PP6M has been discussed with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Scientific 
Advice Working Party (SAWP) over the course of 2 Scientific Advice procedures in September 2016 and 
September 2017. The PSY3015 study design was discussed within a scientific advice 
(EMEA/H/SA/1678/2/2016/III) and as a response to the initially proposed non-inferiority margin of -12.5%, a 
Assessment report  
EMA/502561/2021 
Page 7/83 
 
 
 
NI margin of -10% was recommended (FU advice: EMEA/H/SA/1678/2/FU/1/2017/II).  
In the September 2016 advice procedure, general agreement was noted for the proposed clinical 
pharmacology and pharmacometric development plan, the proposed periods of prior exposure to PP1M or 
PP3M, and that a single clinical study evaluating pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and efficacy of PP6M in 
comparison to PP3M could be sufficient to support the registration of PP6M, subject to the study results and 
assessment of the total data package. The Agency reviewed the proposed study design (PSY3015 Protocol 
Element Document, dated August 2016) and recommended modifications to the PK sampling and monitoring 
of injection site reactions. 
Based on the scientific advice from the CHMP and following additional feedback from a meeting with the US 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 19 January 2017 to discuss the revised study design, the Applicant 
made further revisions to the proposed PSY3015 study design and submitted a draft protocol to the CHMP for 
scientific advice. During the September 2017 advice procedure, the CHMP endorsed the proposed 
noninferiority study design (including the non-inferiority margin of -10%) and primary endpoint and 
recommended that non-inferiority testing be performed in both the intent-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol 
populations. Additionally, the CHMP noted the acceptability of a PP6M single high dose of 1000 mg eq. (vs. 2 
previously proposed high doses of 850 and 1050 mg eq.) and agreed that a single non-inferiority study is 
acceptable to support the registration of PP6M. Since standard of care outside EU countries may be different 
and socio-cultural and other factors intervene significantly on the risk of relapse of previously stable 
schizophrenia patients, the Agency recommended that more than 25% of subject enrollment be from EU 
countries to allow for assay sensitivity in determination of relapse rates to show a difference between 
treatments. 
Pre-submission meetings between the Applicant and the CHMP Rapporteur (Medical Products Agency [MPA], 
Sweden) and Co-rapporteur (Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices [BfArM], Germany) took place 
on 23 September 2020 and 8 September 2020, respectively. In addition to a discussion of regulatory and 
procedural matters, the Applicant obtained clarification on specific aspects related to clinical pharmacology, 
PP6M efficacy and safety data, biostatistics, and the Risk Management Plan.  
Summary of questions raised/ issues discussed in the Scientific Advice*  
The Applicant received Scientific Advice on the development of Paliperidone palmitate (Paliperidone palmitate 
IM) from the CHMP on 15 September 2016 (EMEA/H/SA/1678/2/2016/III) and   14 September 
2017  (EMEA/H/SA/1678/2/FU/1/2017/II) ). The Scientific Advice pertained to the following preclinical and 
clinical aspects:  
Preclinical 
•  Choice of animal preclinical models and general acceptability of the non-clinical package to support 
the MAA. 
Clinical  
•  Sufficiency of the assessment of efficacy (noninferiority) of PP6M versus PP3M was a secondary 
objective for the MAA.  
• Choice of patients with schizophrenia who are clinically stable on paliperidone palmitate extended release 
injection product as adequate population for single registration trial.  
• Acceptability of the dosing strength planned to be used, based on population-PK modelling and to keep the 
PP6M injection volume to a maximum of 5 mL 
• Acceptability of the general strategy for the clinical development for the MAA.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness characterized by psychosis, mood disorders, and cognitive disorders. 
The clinical signs and symptoms of schizophrenia are very complex and display different patterns which vary 
widely from patient to patient. The symptoms are commonly divided into several broad clusters (see Section 
2.1.4). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
Based on data from 2016, the global mean point prevalence of schizophrenia was estimated to be 0.28%, 
with an estimated 20.9 million prevalent cases worldwide. The high prevalence is attributed to the fact that it 
is a lifelong illness that typically has an onset in young adulthood. The long-term outcome of schizophrenia 
varies along a continuum of reasonable recovery to total incapacitation. 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
The symptoms are commonly divided into several broad clusters:  
• 
• 
• 
The positive symptoms represent an addition to normal behavior that may involve hallucinations 
(perceptual experiences not shared by others), delusions (e.g., that others can interfere with one’s 
thoughts), thought disorder, bizarre behavior and disorganized speech, movement disorders (repetition 
of certain motions over and over), and catatonia (no movement or no response to others).  
The negative symptoms comprise elements that are absent from normal behavior, including anhedonia 
(loss of the ability to experience pleasure), asociality (withdrawal from social contacts), lack of volition, 
lack of motivation, flat or blunted affect or emotion, and alogia (reduced quantity or content of speech).  
Patients with schizophrenia may also suffer from cognitive impairments such as diminished attention, 
memory, and executive function (e.g., the ability to plan, initiate, and regulate goal-directed behaviors).  
•  Behavioral and affective deficits including depression, lethargy, mood swings, and inappropriate and odd 
presentation are frequently associated with schizophrenia, causing avoidance on the part of others and 
thereby leading to social isolation.  
2.1.4.  Management 
Antipsychotic drugs are commonly divided into typical (first generation) and atypical (second generation) 
categories. Clinically effective doses of typical antipsychotic drugs generate a striatal dopamine D2 receptor 
occupancy of about 60% to 80%, approaching a level that is associated with a high risk of extrapyramidal 
side effects. Typical antipsychotic drugs are mostly effective against positive symptoms but have a more 
limited effect on and may even exacerbate negative and cognitive symptoms. In contrast, atypical 
antipsychotics have lower affinity for and occupancy of the dopaminergic receptors and a high degree of 
Assessment report  
EMA/502561/2021 
Page 10/83 
 
 
occupancy for the 5HT2A serotonin receptors. Compared to typical antipsychotics, atypicals induce fewer 
extrapyramidal side effects at clinically effective doses and may have greater efficacy in reducing negative 
symptoms.  
In 1984, based on the assumption that 5HT2A antagonism might improve efficacy of D2 blockers (particularly 
for negative symptoms) and reduce extrapyramidal side effects, Janssen Pharmaceutical developed the 
atypical antipsychotic risperidone, which combines potent 5HT2A and D2 blockades. Risperidone was launched 
in 1993 and rapidly incorporated into clinical practice and is currently widely recommended as a first line 
option for treatment of psychosis. Clinical experience has supported the efficacy and tolerability of both oral 
and long acting risperidone in several reviews. The drug was first approved in Europe in 1993. 
As with other oral antipsychotic drugs, a challenge associated with risperidone is that many patients with 
schizophrenia are poorly compliant with their medications. In the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention 
Effectiveness (CATIE) study, 74% of patients were found to have discontinued their prescribed drug within 18 
months, many due to either poor tolerability or lack of efficacy. Even among those who do not explicitly 
discontinue drug therapy, non-adherence to long-term oral medication regimes is one of the most significant 
therapeutic issues in the therapy of schizophrenia and related disorders. As a result, many patients do not 
experience the full benefit of antipsychotic drug therapy, and suffer frequent relapses or exacerbations, which 
require re-hospitalization. Missing as few as 1 to 10 days of oral antipsychotic therapy nearly doubles the risk 
of hospitalization (Keks and Culhane 1999, Byerly, Nakonezny et al. 2007). The use of depot antipsychotics 
as a maintenance treatment for individuals with a history of non-adherence with oral antipsychotics is well 
recognized. Thus, adherence to medication can be problematic for patients with schizophrenia.  
In contrast to oral formulations, long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics may reduce the risk of 
relapse and hospitalization and thus improve quality of life. Because LAI antipsychotics are administered 
by a healthcare provider, LAIs offer transparency with respect to medication adherence, alerting 
healthcare professionals to nonadherence. 
Many LAI antipsychotics are available with treatment intervals of 2 to 4 weeks. The LAI antipsychotic 
Paliperidone, the active metabolite of risperidone, is available in 3 formulations: an oral prolonged-release 
(PR) osmotic pump technology (OROS) tablet formulation (also referred to a paliperidone extended-release 
[ER] tablets, INVEGA) and 2 long-acting injectable (LAI) formulations: paliperidone palmitate 1-month 
injection (PP1M; XEPLION) and paliperidone palmitate 3-month injection (PP3M; TREVICTA), but there is 
none longer than 3 months. 
A paliperidone palmitate 6-month injection (PP6M) has been developed by the Applicant. The idea is that the 
6-month dosing interval with PP6M might work for the most stable schizophrenia patients in cases a longer 
dosing interval is preferred, and that it might offer benefits to some underserved schizophrenia patients as 
well. There are patients with limited access to healthcare for various reasons, such as geographic or 
economic problems with clinic visits for injections, or with limited access to treatment due to problems 
associated with homelessness. 
2.2.  About the product 
Risperidone is a benzisoxazole derivative and a second-generation antipsychotic agent which combines potent 
serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) 5-HT2 and dopamine D2 receptor antagonism. Paliperidone also blocks 
alpha 1-adrenergic receptors and slightly less, H1-histaminergic and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors. 
Paliperidone is not bound to cholinergic receptors. 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Psycholeptics, other antipsychotics. ATC code: N05AX13. 
Paliperidone palmitate is an aqueous suspension for intramuscular (IM) injection. Based on its extremely low 
water solubility, paliperidone palmitate dissolves slowly after injection before being hydrolyzed to 
paliperidone, which then enters the systemic circulation. By slowly releasing paliperidone from the injection 
site, the paliperidone palmitate formulation enables a dosing interval that achieves therapeutic plasma 
Assessment report  
EMA/502561/2021 
Page 11/83 
 
 
concentrations of paliperidone for 1 month (PP1M), 3 months (PP3M), or 6 months (PP6M) depending on 
particle size, concentration and dosage. The efficacy and safety of the paliperidone formulations currently 
available for the treatment of schizophrenia have been well characterized and established. 
The oral formulation of paliperidone (INVEGA) was first approved in the European Union (EU) on 27 June 
2007 (EMEA/H/C/00746) and is currently approved for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and 
adolescents 15 years of age and older and for the treatment of schizoaffective disorder in adults. The PP1M 
formulation (XEPLION) was approved in the EU on 4 March 2011 (EMEA/H/C/002105) for the maintenance 
treatment of schizophrenia in adult patients stabilized with paliperidone or risperidone. The PP3M formulation 
(TREVICTA) was approved in the EU on 26 May 2016 (procedure EMEA/H/C/4066/X/007/G) for the 
maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adult patients stabilized with PP1M. Paliperidone PR tablets, PP1M, 
and PP3M are also licensed globally in numerous other countries, including the United States (US).  
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This application concerned a line extension for the addition of two new strengths grouped with a number of 
type IA and IB variations to change the (invented) name of the medicinal product, to delete a manufacturing 
site and to delete a number of strengths from the MA. 
The long-acting injectable (LAI) formulation of the antipsychotic paliperidone is available in 3 formulations: 
an oral prolonged-release (PR), osmotic pump technology (OROS), tablet formulation (also referred to a 
paliperidone extended-release [ER] tablets, INVEGA) and 2 LAI formulations: paliperidone palmitate 1-month 
injection (PP1M; XEPLION) and paliperidone palmitate 3-month injection (PP3M; TREVICTA), but there was

mg of paliperidone (as palmitate) as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: polysorbate 20, polyethylene glycol 4000, citric acid monohydrate, sodium dihydrogen 
phosphate monohydrate, sodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment) and water for injections.  
The product is available in pre-filled syringe (cyclic-olefin-copolymer) with a plunger stopper, plunger rod, 
backstop, and tip cap (bromobutyl rubber) with a thin wall 20G 1½ inch (0.9 mm × 38 mm) safety needle. 
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
The active substance (AS) paliperidone palmitate has already been assessed in connection with the marketing 
authorization of Invega, Xeplion and Trevicta in the centralised procedure. Information provided on the active

2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
The following variations related to the authorised finished product were applied: 
- change the (invented) name of the medicinal product from Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International to 
BYANNLI; A.2.a - IAIN, 
- to delete Cilag AG (Hochstrasse 201, CH-8200 Schaffhausen) as a site responsible for manufacturing, 
primary and secondary packaging and release testing of the finished product; A.7 – IA, 
- to delete the 25 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg and 150 mg/100 mg strengths from the Paliperidone 
Janssen-Cilag marketing authorisation (EU/1/20/1453/001-006); 6 x C.I.7.b - IB. 
Revised product information reflecting the new invented name has been provided. The dossier has been 
updated to delete Cilag AG (Hochstrasse 201, CH-8200 Schaffhausen) as a site responsible for 
manufacturing, primary and secondary packaging and release testing of the finished product. The revised 
product information also reflects the deletion of the 25 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg and 150 mg/100 
mg strengths. Since Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International (BYANNLI) was an informed consent application 
of Xeplion, the deletion of the above mentioned strengths is to ensure that the present duplicate MA concerns 
only the two newly introduced strengths intended for biannually (once every 6 months) administration. The 
other strengths are available in the MAs of Invega, Xeplion and Trevicta. 
All the applied variations are accepted and approved. 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product (FP) is presented as a white to off white prolonged-release suspension for injection in 
prefilled syringe containing 700 mg or 1000 mg of paliperidone (as palmitate) and is intended for 
intramuscular injection every 6 months. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in 
paragraph 2.4.1 of this report. The different dosage strengths, including the syringe size and, the nominal fill 
volume are presented in Table 1.

The AS is the palmitate ester of paliperidone, which is the major active metabolite of risperidone. 
Paliperidone palmitate is practically insoluble in aqueous media over a broad pH range. This low solubility of 
the AS makes it possible to formulate it as a suspension with an extended release profile. 
Development of the formulation used in the approved 3-month formulation was based on the insight gained 
during the 1-month formulation, however a quantitative change in the relative amounts of the excipients in 
the formulation was required due to an increase in the particle size and active substance concentration. In 
addition, disodium hydrogen phosphate was not required to meet the targeted buffering capacity. 
Development work was performed to ensure that the resulting suspension can be easily resuspended and 
smoothly injected using thin-walled IM needles. Therefore, the development work focused on the optimization 
of the concentration of the wetting agent and the stabilizing agents: 
Assessment report  
EMA/502561/2021 
Page 13/83 
 
 
 
-the same wetting agent and stabilizing agent as used in the 1-month formulation were used but in different 
amounts. 
-the concentration of the buffer components, sodium hydroxide and citric acid, was modified in order to 
maintain chemical stability and the targeted pH. 
The suspension contains an aqueous buffer solution that easily penetrates into the muscle tissue, after which 
the undissolved paliperidone palmitate particles are localized at the site of administration as a loose 
agglomerate. The paliperidone palmitate particles of the FP suspension dissolve very slowly in the fluids at 
the injection site. The dissolved prodrug, paliperidone palmitate, is then hydrolysed by esterases into its 
active compound paliperidone and palmitic acid. This is supported by the observation that little or no 
paliperidone palmitate reaches the systemic circulation. Only paliperidone enters into the systemic 
circulation. The dissolution rate of paliperidone palmitate in the extracellular fluids is hypothesized to be the 
release rate limiting step, and is determined by the specific surface area, and thus particle size and 
morphology, of the paliperidone palmitate particles. The particle size and morphology are discussed further 
below in this section; particle size is controlled in the FP specification. 
When developing the 3-month formulation, the active concentration was increased to 312 mg/mL 
paliperidone palmitate (eq. 200 mg/mL paliperidone) in order to achieve the desired dose range, reduce the 
release rate, and minimize the injection volume. A further concentration increase was not feasible as this 
would negatively impact processability of the suspension. Therefore, the active concentration of the 6-month 
formulation was not further increased. 
The prior knowledge from the 3-month formulation was successfully leveraged to result the 6-month 
formulation and no additional formulation development studies were performed; this is acceptable.  
The following physicochemical characteristics of the AS were evaluated for their potential influence on the 
finished product performance (i.e., the in vivo release profile): purity, crystallinity and polymorphism, 
morphology, solubility, and particle size. 
The data demonstrated that none of these characteristics have an impact on the performance of the finished 
product (FP). For purity, crystallinity, and morphology, this is because the same characteristics are 
consistently obtained after production. For particle size, this is because the FP milling step is robust and 
independent of the incoming particle size. 
To obtain the 6-month release profile, the bulk suspension is filled in 5 mL syringes to the volumes of 3.5 mL 
(eq. 700 mg dose) and 5.0 mL (eq. 1000 mg dose). The drug release characteristics of PP6M are determined 
by drug particle size, concentration and injection volume of the suspension. Drug particle size and 
concentration for the 6-month formulation were derived from the 3-month formulation, while injection 
volume was increased to the volumes of 3.5 mL (eq. 700 mg dose) and 5.0 mL (eq. 1000 mg dose) in order 
to obtain the desired release profile of 6 months. Earlier dose-proportionality and human pharmacokinetic 
(PK) studies with the approved 1-month finished product (also called PP1M) had proven that the release rate 
decreases with increasing drug particle size and concentration, and injection volume of finished product 
suspension. Based on PK simulations, 3.5-fold higher doses were developed for the 3-month formulation. The 
population PK model developed for the 3-month formulation was applied to the dose selection of the 6-month 
formulation. 
The particle size range developed for the formulation was based on the results of the clinical study R092670-
PSY1002, which demonstrated that increasing the particle size of AS in the suspension decreases the Cmax 
and extends the Tmax.

EMA/502561/2021 
Page 14/83 
 
 
As the in vivo dissolution of the AS particles is the release rate limiting step, the solubility and physical 
characteristics of the AS are important factors in the formulation design. 
Since the same crystal structure and morphology are consistently obtained during production of clinical, 
primary stability, and validation batches, the particle size is considered as the only variable parameter that 
can influence the drug release rate. The release characteristics of the FP are controlled by 2 test methods: 
(1) through an in vitro release test and (2) by measuring the particle size distribution of the suspension by 
means of laser diffraction. Both methods are stability indicating and discriminative for the particle size. 
All excipients are well characterized and widely used in pharmaceutical preparations. The excipients used in 
the commercial formulation have detailed monographs in relevant pharmacopoeias (USP/NF or Ph. Eur.) and 
are generally recognized as safe. There are no novel excipients used in the formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
With regard to the manufacturing process development the 6-month formulation is manufactured at the 
same manufacturing site using the approved 3-month formulation product. Therefore, the existing criticality 
analysis for 3-month formulation was re-assessed to confirm an appropriate control strategy for the Critical 
Quality Attributes (CQAs) of the 6-month formulation. The criticality of the process steps of the 6-month 
formulation was established in line with the 3-month formulation No new manufacturing development 
experiments were conducted for the 6-month formulation on Steps 1-9. After reassessment of criticality of 
the filling process, the CQAs particulate matter, sterility and bacterial endotoxins are listed as impacted by 
Step10 – filling of final suspension. The re-assessment of criticality is applicable for both the 3-month and the 
6-month formulations. 
Similar to the approved 3-month formulation, the 6-month formulation is manufactured aseptically because 
terminal sterilization of the final suspension is not feasible. In compliance with Guideline on the sterilisation 
of the medicinal product, active substance, excipient and primary container 
EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/850374/2015, the FP needs to be manufactured through aseptic processing using 
sterile active substance as input for the process. Aseptic crystallization of the AS is performed by dissolving 
the AS in ethyl alcohol and sterilization by filtration before aseptic precipitation and further aseptic 
processing. 
The production of Phase 3 clinical and primary stability/validation 6-month formulation batches occurred at 
full scale size at the commercial site. 
As discussed above, particle size of the AS in the suspension drives the in vivo and in vitro release. An IVIVC 
model which links in vitro drug release with in vivo release for formulations manufactured with a different 
particle size has been successfully established for the 1-month formulation formulation with dv50 particle 
sizes, which encompasses the dv50 particle size range of the 6-month formulation .  
The development of the in vitro release method for the 6-month formulation was described and shown to be 
sufficiently discriminative. The IVIVC confirmed that the in vitro release method is biorelevant. 
The container closure system is pre-filled syringe (cyclic-olefin-copolymer, COC) with a plunger stopper, 
plunger rod, backstop, and tip cap (bromobutyl rubber) with a thin wall 20G 1½ inch (0.9 mm × 38 mm) 
safety needle. The syringe barrel complies with Ph. Eur. 3.1.3 and Ph. Eur. 3.1.5 for plastic containers. The 
tip cap complies with Ph. Eur. 3.2.9 for rubber closures. 
Given that compatibility and safety had been proven for PP3M, the same syringe barrel type and bromobutyl 
rubber tip cap, using the same materials and supplier, were selected for PP6M. Primary stability studies have 
demonstrated that during storage in the selected container closure system, the chemical and physical quality 
Assessment report  
EMA/502561/2021 
Page 15/83 
 
 
of the finished product is maintained throughout the course of the stability studies. The bromobutyl rubber 
stopper has been assessed as toxicologically safe in presented extractable and leachable studies. 
The container closure system integrity has been successfully demonstrated during storage by means of blue 
dye ingress testing and a bacterial ingress study, during transportation by plunger movement testing, and 
after transportation by blue dye ingress testing. 
Shipping qualification was performed to demonstrate that the PP6M combination product kit is not adversely 
affected during shipping, both physically and functionally. It was also demonstrated that horizontal shipment 
of syringes improves re-suspendability of the FP after shaking, leading to lower injectability forces during 
administration. Thus, section 6.4 of the SmPC includes a recommendation to this effect. 
2.4.3.1.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The FP is manufactured at Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, Beerse, Belgium. 
The manufacturing process comprises 4 main stages and 10 steps in  total, preparation of the suspension 
concentrate, milling of the suspension concentrate, dilution of the suspension concentrate  and filling of final 
suspension. 
The FP is aseptically manufactured by dispersing the sterile AS in a sterile buffer solution, wet milling the 
suspension to a target particle size, dilution of the milled suspension using WFI, and aseptically filling and 
stoppering of the final suspension into pre-sterilized syringes.  
Critical steps have been clearly stated and the applied controls are acceptable as are the other in-process 
controls. The critical steps were identified as sterile filtration, milling and filling. 
The process validation activities consisted of the manufacture of three 100-L batches of the validated bulk 
suspension. Based on the presented validation data for the 6-month formulation, the data previously 
presented for the 3-month formulation and considering the adequacy of in-process controls and experience 
gained on 3-month formulation, it is considered that the manufacture of the 6-month formulation is 
sufficiently robust and the process produces the finished product (paliperidone palmitate 6-month 
formulation) is of consistent quality, complying with the designated specification. 
2.4.3.2.  Product specification 
The release and shelf-life specifications for the FP include tests and limits for appearance/ resuspendability/ 
injectability (visual), identification (HPLC, FTIR), assay (HPLC), chromatographic purity (HPLC), pH (Ph. Eur.), 
particulate matter (laser diffraction), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), in vitro release testing (Ph. Eur.- 
UHPLC), particle size distribution (laser diffraction), sterility (Ph. Eur.) and bacterial endotoxin (Ph. Eur.).  
The specification provided for the 6-month product is similar as the currently approved 3-month product, with 
the exception that the acceptance criteria for endotoxins which have been tightened to account for the higher 
dosage strength. The specifications used for the control of FP are in line with ICH Q6A, ICH Q3B and were 
selected on the basis of the available manufacturing and testing experience, manufacturing process 
capabilities, regulatory guidance, scientific knowledge, and the stability characteristics. Appropriate data have 
been presented to justify the specifications for each quality characteristic that is controlled. The specifications 
established for control ensure the identity, safety, and purity of FP throughout the proposed shelf life. The 
specifications for the finished product are considered adequately justified. 
Assessment report  
EMA/502561/2021 
Page 16/83 
 
 
A risk-based assessment was conducted in accordance with ICH Q3D, taking into account any potential 
contributions from the AS, excipients, manufacturing equipment, container closure system (primary 
packaging), and processing water into the FP. Based on this assessment supplemented with analytical 
screening, testing of the FP for elemental impurities is not considered necessary as levels of elemental 
impurities from various sources are not expected to exceed the permitted daily exposure 30% threshold 
levels. 
A risk assessment with regard to the potential presence of nitrosamines in the FP has been conducted based 
on principles of the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine 
impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under 
Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/369136/2020).Based on the risk assessment conducted, no risk for presence of, or formation of, 
nitrosamines is identified for the FP. Moreover, formation of nitrosamines during storage is considered 
negligible and thus, no additional control measures are deemed necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods have been 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
The finished product is released onto the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Batch analysis data provided for three commercial scale batches of the each strength and three pilot batches 
of the each strength, all manufactured by the proposed manufacturer. The results were within the proposed 
specification. The batch analysis data provided indicate the capability of the manufacturing process to 
produce FP of consistent quality, complying with the designated specification. 
2.4.3.3.  Stability of the product 
Stability data have been presented on three commercial scale batches of each strength stored in the intended 
container closure system under long term (25 °C/ 40% RH and 30 °C/ 35% RH) for up to 12 months and 
under accelerated conditions (40 °C/NMT 25% RH) for up to 12 months were provided as per ICH guideline 
for  semi-permeable containers.   
Samples were tested for appearance, assay, chromatographic purity, pH, in vitro release,  particle size 
distribution weight loss, sterility and bacterial endotoxins. The weight loss method has been sufficiently 
described. Al results were within the specifications and in line with the observed results for the 3 month 
formulation. 
A stability studies were also performed under a range of stress conditions such as light (ICH conditions), 
freeze-thaw cycling -15 °C/30 °C (24 h/24 h)) for at least 2 weeks, for at least 1 month at -20 °C, for at 
least 12 months at 5 °C, and for at least 1 month at 50 °C in the proposed commercial packaging. The 
available stability data indicate that the FP is chemically and physically stable under the tested conditions. 
Based on the overall submitted stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years without any special storage 
condition, as stated in SmPC 6.3 and 6.4, is acceptable. 
2.4.3.4.  Adventitious agents 
None of the excipients in the manufacture of the FP is of human or animal origin.

2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
This application concerned a line extension for the addition of two new strengths forms grouped with 8 type 
IA, IAIN and IB variations to change the (invented) name of the medicinal product, to delete a manufacturing 
site and to delete a number of strengths from the MA. 
The 8 grouped type IA, IAIN and IB variations have been supported by the respective documentations as per 
the variation classification guideline and are accepted.  
The AS has been previously assessed in connection with the marketing authorization applications of Invega, 
Xeplion and Trevicta in the centralised procedure; no new information on the active substance has been 
provided with this line extension.  
Information on development, manufacture and control of the two new strengths of the finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity 
of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable and consistent. Physicochemical and biological 
aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled 
in a satisfactory way. The new strengths are approvable from a quality perspective.  
In addition, the following variations related to the authorised finished product were applied and are also 
approved: 
- change the (invented) name of the medicinal product from Paliperidone Janssen-Cilag International to 
BYANNLI; 
- to delete Cilag AG (Hochstrasse 201, CH-8200 Schaffhausen) as a site responsible for manufacturing, 
primary and secondary packaging and release testing of the finished product; 
- to delete the 25 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg and 150 mg/100 mg strengths from the Paliperidone 
Janssen-Cilag marketing authorisation (EU/1/20/1453/001-006). 
2.4.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
None.  
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
PP6M will be administered with a higher dose volume than PP3M. 
The PP6M nonclinical program was designed to build upon previous non-clinical experience with the active 
ingredient. The dossier contains one new study, a 26-week local tolerance study in minipigs with the 
objective to compare the impact of increasing the administration volume between PP3M (max in clinic 2.6 
Assessment report  
EMA/502561/2021 
Page 18/83 
 
 
mL) and PP6M (max in clinic 5.0 mL). Furthermore, the impurity qualification information previously 
submitted for the paliperidone palmitate products XEPLION (PP1M) and TREVICTA (PP3M) was updated 
according to the use of the PP6M formulation and the abuse liability potential was discussed. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
Paliperidone is a racemate comprised of enantiomers: paliperidone (+) R078543 and paliperidone (-) 
R078544. The pharmacological profiles of the racemate and the 2 enantiomers are similar in in vitro binding 
assays, in vivo receptor occupancy studies, and in vivo functional interaction studies. Paliperidone palmitate 
is a prodrug of paliperidone (R076477). Following intramuscular administration, paliperidone palmitate is 
converted to paliperidone, with minimal systemic exposure to paliperidone palmitate in animals as well as in 
humans. The pharmacological profile of paliperidone was adequately evaluated during the development of 
oral paliperidone and was accepted for the XEPLION and TREVICTA dossiers. 
Paliperidone is a selective blocking agent of monoamine effects, whose pharmacological properties are 
different from that of traditional neuroleptics. Paliperidone binds strongly to serotonergic 5-HT2- and 
dopaminergic D2-receptors. Paliperidone also blocks alpha 1-adrenergic receptors and slightly less, 
H1-histaminergic and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors. The pharmacological activity of the (+)- and 
(-)-paliperidone enantiomers are qualitatively and quantitatively similar. 
Paliperidone is not bound to cholinergic receptors. Even though paliperidone is a strong D2-antagonist, which 
is believed to relieve the symptoms of schizophrenia, it causes less catalepsy and decreases motor functions 
less than traditional neuroleptics. Dominating central serotonin antagonism may reduce the tendency of 
paliperidone to cause extrapyramidal side effects. 
No new pharmacology studies were considered needed to support the use of 6-month injections with 
paliperidone palmitate. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Any systemic effect following the IM injection of paliperidone palmitate is mediated through paliperidone. The 
ADME characteristics of paliperidone after IM administered paliperidone palmitate have been adequately 
evaluated during the development of the 1-month formulation (PP1M) and were accepted for the XEPLION 
dossier.  
The toxicokinetics of the local tolerance study in the minipig are described in the SmPc (Section 3.2.3). 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
The non-clinical toxicology program in support of the long-acting injectable nanosuspension of paliperidone 
palmitate builds on the large dataset of non-clinical toxicology studies previously conducted with oral 
paliperidone to support the marketing authorization of paliperidone prolonged-release tablets (INVEGA). To 
support the development of paliperidone palmitate as a long-acting once a month injectable aqueous 
nanosuspension, the toxicology program of PP1M consisted of single- and repeat-dose toxicity studies 
addressing systemic toxicity as well as local tolerance at the intramuscular (IM) injection site.  
To support the approval of the PP3M product (TREVICTA), two 12-week local tolerance studies were 
performed in male minipigs comparing the local tolerance and toxicokinetics of the 3-month formulation 
(PP3M) and the 1-month formulation (PP1M). In both studies, central nervous system effects were observed 
in both formulation groups. At necropsy dose-related local reactions were seen at the injection sites, with no

relevant difference between formulations. Histopathologically, similar dose-related inflammatory reactions 
were observed across formulations, but the cellular reaction patterns and sizes of crystalline material in 
inflammatory cells were different. However, these microscopic differences were not considered to reflect a 
meaningful difference in adversity. The AUC exposure after a single dose of the PP3M formulation was similar 
to that after 3 consecutive (once a month) dose administrations of the PP1M formulation. Data in support of 
the 1- and 3-month formulations (PP1M and PP3M, respectively) were assessed in the XEPLION dossier 
(EMEA/H/C/2105) and TREVICTA dossier (EMEA/H/C/4066), respectively. 
Local tolerance 
To support the PP6M formulation intended for IM administration once every 6 months, a 26-week local 
tolerability study in minipigs compared the impact of increasing the volume between PP3M (max in clinic 2.6 
mL) and PP6M (max in clinic 5.0 mL). The study was conducted in compliance with GLP. The intramuscular 
route of administration was selected because this is the intended clinical route.  
The maximum anticipated clinical dose of PP6M is 1000 mg eq. paliperidone, while the maximum 
recommended clinical dose of PP3M is 525 mg eq. paliperidone.  The 2-fold higher maximum clinical dose of 
PP6M is achieved by the IM injection of a 2-fold higher injection volume, which is 5.0 mL for PP6M compared 
with 2.625 mL for PP3M.  
In this 6-month local tolerability study in male minipigs, the animals received a bilateral (Groups 1 to 9) or a 
unilateral (Group 10) intramuscular injection of the long-acting injectable formulation of paliperidone 
palmitate either once (PP6M) or twice with a 3-month dosing interval (PP3M).  Saline control and vehicle 
control groups for each treatment modality were included to investigate whether possible effects were due to 
the vehicle, the compound, or the combination. Intralipid® 20% was considered as a placebo in clinical trials 
with PP6M and was, therefore, included as well. 
The lowest doses of PP3M and PP6M approximated the maximum recommended (PP3M) or anticipated (PP6M) 
human dose on the basis of the maximum external dose (i.e., 525 and 1000 mg eq. paliperidone, 
respectively, scaled on a per kg body weight basis).  The highest doses of PP3M and PP6M reflected the 
maximum recommended (PP3M) or anticipated (PP6M) human dose on the basis of the maximum injection 
volume (i .e., 2.625 and 5.0 mL/injection, respectively, rounded to 2.6 and 5.3 mL/injection, respectively). 
Consequently, the lowest dose of PP3M was set at approximately 17.5 mg eq. paliperidone/kg body weight 
(assuming a 15 kg minipig), and the highest dose at approximately 70 mg eq./kg, administered by a bilateral 
IM injection with a fixed volume of 0.66 and 2.6 mL per injection site, respectively. The lowest dose of PP6M 
was set at approximately 35 mg eq./kg, and the highest dose at approximately 141 mg eq./kg, administered 
by a bilateral intramuscular injection with a fixed volume of 1.3 and 5.3 mL per injection site, respectively. 
An intermediate dose of approximately mg eq./kg of PP6M was administered by a unilateral intramuscular 
injection with a fixed volume of 5.3 mL.  
Saline control and vehicle control groups for each treatment modality were included to investigate whether 
possible effects were due to the vehicle, the compound, or the combination. Overall, the study design is 
considered adequate. 
Mortality  
There was one preterminal mortality during the study that was considered related to treatment. 
Administration of PP6M at 141 mg eq./kg resulted in early termination of one minipig due to its poor clinical 
condition (decreased activity, poor appetite over an extended period and tremors) and body weight loss (-6%

from Days 1 to 8). This animal was given meloxicam for pain relief during Days 2 to 7. At necropsy, slight- to 
moderate-size formulation depots were present within the skeletal muscle in both injection sites and 
unilaterally also in the subcutis. These depots were surrounded by (sub)chronic inflammation and adjacent 
myofibers showed slight degeneration/necrosis, mineralization, and regeneration. Infiltration of macrophages 
and giant cells was noted in the subcutis and interstitium of the skeletal muscle. Prominent granulopoiesis in 
the bone marrow was in line with the inflammatory response at the injection sites. There were no treatment-
related findings noted in remaining organs. 
The preterminal animal had the highest paliperidone plasma levels  (217 ng/mL on Day 10) of the Group 8 
animals but the levels were not substantially different from the other two animals (183 ng/mL on Day 14 and 
188 ng/mL on Day 10). The time of the early termination coincided with the estimated time of Tmax. 
Clinical signs, body weight, hematology and clinical chemistry 
In all paliperidone palmitate-dosed groups, test article-related systemic clinical signs included decreased 
activity throughout most of the study, and occasionally repetitive behavior (increased rooting/chewing at the 
cage or cage materials), abnormal gait (described as clumsy/stumbling), reduced appetite, decreased 
vocalization, and/or tremors during the study.  A higher occurrence (number of observations/group) of CNS-
related clinical signs was generally observed in PP6M-treated animals given 70 or 141 mg eq./kg when 
compared to animals given PP6M at 35 mg eq./kg or PP3M-treated animals.  
Transient mean body weight losses for PP6M at 70 and 141 mg eq./kg or reductions in mean body weight 
gain for PP3M at 70 mg eq./kg were mainly noted at the beginning of the study. 
There were no paliperidone palmitate-related changes in hematology or clinical chemistry parameters 
sampled at Days 90 and 182.  
Dermal scores 
Treatment-related dermal findings were noted in PP3M- and PP6M-treated animals.  In PP3M-treated animals, 
very slight to slight edema at 17.5 mg eq./kg (Days 8 to 92) and very slight to moderate edema at 70 mg 
eq./kg (Days 8 to 182).  In PP6M-treated animals, very slight to slight edema at 35 mg eq./kg (Days 8 to 
85), slight to moderate edema at 141 mg eq./kg (Days 8 to 43) and transient slight to severe (severe 
initially) edema at 70 mg eq./kg (Days 8 to 182).  
Injection site reactions 
At terminal necropsy, pale foci and pale to white linear striations in the skeletal muscle were noted upon 
gross pathology examination in the injection sites of some but not all animals treated with PP3M at 17.5 or 
70 mg eq./kg (Groups 3 and 4) and in some but not all animals treated with PP6M at 35 or 70 mg/kg (Groups 
7 and 10).  There was no clear dose-response relationship for either PP3M or PP6M.  At terminal necropsy, no 
macroscopic findings were noted in the injection sites of the animals treated with PP6M at 141 mg eq./kg 
(Group 8).   
Bilateral injections on Day 1 and Day 91 with PP3M at 17.5 or 70 mg eq./kg (Groups 3 and 4) resulted in 
time- and dose-related multifocal infiltrations of macrophages and multinucleated giant cells in the subcutis 
and/or in interstitium of the skeletal muscle.  No remaining formulation depots were found within the 
injection sites at 3 or 6 months after dosing in 5 of 6 minipigs.  
Bilateral or unilateral injections with PP6M resulted in remaining formulation depots at 6 months after dosing 
surrounded by chronic inflammation at 35 and 70 mg/kg (Groups 7 and 10).  There was a high individual 
variation in the injection site reaction, largely related to the subcutaneous or intramuscular location of the

formulation depot.  Minimal to moderate multifocal infiltrations of macrophages and multinucleated giant cells 
in the subcutis and/or in interstitium of the skeletal muscle were noted for all terminal minipigs dosed with 
PP6M, including those dosed at 141 mg/kg (Group 8).  Large subcutaneous depots, surrounded by a limited 
chronic inflammatory response (with less infiltrating macrophages and a higher fibrous component) were 
noted at 70 mg/kg (Group 10), while the intramuscular formulation depots were smaller and triggered a 
more pronounced inflammatory response.  Upon administration of PP6M at 141 mg/kg (Group 8) no 
remaining formulation depots were found in the injection sites 6 months after dosing. Intramuscular and/or 
subcutaneous depots were only noted in terminal minipigs from Group 4 (PP3M at 70 mg eq./kg), Group 7 
(PP6M at 35 mg eq./kg), and Group 10 (PP6M at 70 mg eq./kg).  Formulation depots were composed of 
slightly eosinophilic amorphous material with cholesterol-like clefts and (multi) focal mineralization.  These 
were usually surrounded by a slight to moderate chronic inflammatory reaction, mainly composed of 
infiltrating macrophages and (young) fibroblasts. The resolution of these depots is dependent on infiltration of 
macrophages and their phagocytosis of the crystalline particles, as evidenced by the cholesterol-like clefts 
within macrophages and multinucleated giant cells.  
Toxicokinetics 
Plasma paliperidone Tmax was observed between 10 and 27 days for PP3M and between 10 and 14 days for 
PP6M. Overall, the increase in plasma paliperidone exposure was approximately dose proportional across the 
studied dose range for both PP3M and PP6M. At 70 mg eq./kg, the mean Cmax, AUC(0-90), and T1/2 were similar 
between the PP3M and PP6M groups.  
The exposure after a single dose of the PP6M formulation was approximately similar to that after 2 
consecutive (once every 3 months) dose administrations of the corresponding PP3M formulation. 
While intramuscular and/or subcutaneous depots were noted in terminal minipigs administered PP3M at 70 
mg eq./kg, PP6M at 35 mg eq./kg, and PP6M at 70 mg eq./kg, in individual animals from those groups, the 
systemic paliperidone exposure was not affected by the IM or subcutaneous location of the injection site 
depots. 
Dependence 
Based on the pharmacological profile of paliperidone, the risk of abuse and dependence potential of its 
prodrug paliperidone palmitate is thought to be minimal. Moreover, clinical experience with risperidone 
(resulting in high exposure to its pharmacologically active metabolite paliperidone), with paliperidone itself, 
and other typical and atypical neuroleptics does not reveal any risk of abuse or dependence. Therefore, no 
dedicated abuse liability studies in animals (i.e., drug discrimination, self-administration, and physical 
dependence) or in humans were conducted to evaluate the abuse and dependence potential of paliperidone 
or paliperidone palmitate. This was agreed. 
Impurities 
The non-genotoxic impurities R206474, R206475, R207919, R208224 and R208225 are synthesis impurities 
that are homologue esters, structurally related to paliperidone palmitate. They originate from coupling of 
paliperidone with the palmitic acid impurities, dodecanoic acid, tetradecanoic acid, pentadecanoic acid, 
heptadecanoic acid, and octadecanoic acid, respectively.  
The impurity qualification information was previously submitted for the paliperidone palmitate products 
XEPLION and TREVICTA was updated according to the use of the PP6M formulation. Overall, the strategy is 
considered acceptable. Thus, the toxicologically qualified concentrations of the non-genotoxic impurities 
Assessment report  
EMA/502561/2021 
Page 22/83 
 
 
R206474, R206475, R207919, R208224 and R208225 for PP6M are 1.7%, 0.7%, 0.8%, 1.4%, and 2.3%, 
respectively. 
Regarding non-genotoxic impurities, the argumentation of the Applicant is as follows: PP6M is intended for 
chronic dosing by intermittent administration. For individual genotoxic impurities, according to ICH M7 (R1) 
the threshold of toxicological concern of 1.5 μg/day applies for chronic treatment exceeding 10 years of 
treatment. However, PP6M is administered intermittently either once every 6 months. Over a lifetime of 70 
years, PP6M will be administered once every 6 months or in total 140 times. This translates into 
approximately 4.7 months of consecutive daily dosing. According to ICH M7 (R1) the acceptable intake for an 
individual impurity is 20 μg/day for >1 to 12 months of daily treatment. At a maximum dose of 1,560 mg 
paliperidone palmitate/6 months, the concentration limit for individual genotoxic impurities in the final 
paliperidone palmitate drug substance is 13 ppm (20 x 1,000/1,560 = 13 ppm). 
It is not fully agreed that a lifetime administration of PP6M given about 140 times can be translated into 
approximately 4.7 months of consecutive daily dosing. Given the depot formulation, it seems more likely that 
the genotoxic impurities, like the active substance, will be released slowly during an extended period of time. 
However, the reasoning can be viewed as a worst-case scenario and is therefore acceptable.  
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The API in the medicinal product Paliperidone Palmitate 6 months Prolonged Release Suspension for 
Injection, paliperidone palmitate (R092670), is completely hydrolysed to paliperidone (R076477) and palmitic 
acid in the human body. Consequently, paliperidone palmitate is considered as the pro-drug and paliperidone 
as the drug. Therefore, in the environmental risk assessment of Paliperidone Palmitate Prolonged Release 
Suspension for Injection, the environmental impact of the paliperidone (R076477) is assessed. This strategy 
is agreed as paliperidone is considered a pro-drug. 
During the assessment, the following final study reports were submitted: 
a.  Physico-chemical properties of paliperidone (OECD 107 and 105) 
b.  Terrestrial plant growth study (OECD 208)  
c.  Acute earthworm toxicity (OECD 207)  
d.  Micro-organisms toxicity (OECD 216)  
The following studies are ongoing and are proposed by the Applicant to be submitted not later than April 
2022: 
a.  Collembola reproduction (OECD 232)  
b.  Soil degradation (OECD 307)  
c.  Aerobic degradation study in sediment/water systems (OECD 308) 
Given that no complete ERA has been submitted, it was not possible to fully conclude on the potential risk of 
paliperiodone to the environment. A Letter of Commitment to complete the outstanding studies and the ERA 
was provided.

Phase I: Estimation of exposure 
Screening for persistence (P), bioaccumulation (B) and toxicity (T) 
The octanol/water partition coefficient study in accordance with OECD 107 has been performed as part of the 
following study ‘Determination of Physico-Chemical Properties of Paliperidone (JNJ-16232411-AAA)” (CRL 
Study No. 20259674; 04 May 2021).  
For ionizable compounds the distribution coefficient octanol/water (log Dow) should be determined instead of 
the partition coefficient octanol/water (log Pow). As this is the case for paliperidone, the log Dow as a 
function of different pH values and at 20°C was determined, resulting in the following values: 
log Dow at pH 5: -0.6 
log Dow at pH 7: 0.9 
log Dow at pH 9: 2.1 
The water solubility at 20°C was determined to be 0.0343 g/L. 
The results for log Dow are below the value of 4.5 and it is agreed that no further screening for persistence, 
bioaccumulation and toxicity is required. Moreover, the result of the log Dow (at pH 7) is < 3, show that 
paliperidone has a low tendency to bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms and no bioconcentration study is 
required. 
Calculation of PECsurfacewater 
The predicted environmental concentration in surface water (PECsurfacewater) was calculated using the formula 
and the default values according to guideline EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 (EMA 2006):

Refinement of PECsurfacewater 
The PECsurfacewater can be refined with estimation for the market penetration of the medicinal product in the 
EU, based on prevalence data for schizophrenia in the EU. The market penetration factor is calculated as 
follows: Fpen,refined=0.36% (0.0036) based on prevalence data for schizophrenia in the Netherlands (see 
below). The refined PECsurfacewater of paliperidone in surface water is 0.022 µg/L. 
Table 2 
These estimates were tabulated from the following publication: Charlson FJ et al; "Global Epidemiology and Burden of 
Schizophrenia: Findings from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016." Schizophrenia Bulletin; 5/12/18; 
DOI:10.1093/schbul/sby058.  They were extracted from the Clarivate Analytics Incidence and Prevalence Database (IPD), 
which provided population estimates based on matching to the age-specific population for the current year’s population. 
From Janssen, this IPD database is available from: https://www.rightfind.com/vlib/portal/mlportal.aspx?clientid=60 
According to guideline EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 (EMA 2006) and the ‘Questions and answers’ document to 
this guideline (EMA 2016), the PECsurfacewater can be refined based on published epidemiological data. The

prevalence data referred to are dated 2016 but published in 2018. Although not fully up to date, the data are 
considered acceptable. The refined PECsurfacewater of paliperidone is 0.022 μg/L which is above the threshold of 
0.01 μg/L and consequently, a Phase II Environmental fate and effect analysis is required.  
Calculation of PECgroundwater 
The PECgroundwater can be derived from the PECsurfacewater using the following formula: 
The PECgroundwater = 0.25 × PECsurfacewater = 0.006 μg/L 
The PECgroundwater of paliperidone in ground water is 0.006 μg/L.

The adsorption coefficients for 4 soils with different organic carbon contents indicate that there is high affinity 
for paliperidone to bind to sewage sludge in the Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) and to soils and thus further 
terrestrial testing is required. 
The study OECD308 is in progress. If the results show that >10% of parent compound (+NER) shift to 
sediment in the water: sediment simulation study, effects on a sediment dwelling organism should be further 
investigated in Phase Tier IIB.

Calculation of PNECwater, PNECmicroorganisms and PNECgroundwater 
The predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) is calculated by applying an assessment factor to the values 
resulting from tests on environmental organisms from the compartment of concern.  
To calculate the PNEC from the long-term toxicity tests and the microbial effect study, an assessment factor 
of 10 is applied. This assessment factor accounts for inter-species variations of differences in sensitivity, 
intra-species variability, and laboratory data to field impact extrapolation (additive, synergistic and 
antagonistic effects from the presence of other substances may also play a role here). 
The PNECwater is based on the lowest NOEC result from the long-term toxicity tests. The PNECmicroorganism is 
based on the NOEC result of the microbial effect study. The PNECgroundwater is based on the NOEC result of the 
acute toxicity test with Daphnia magna.

As the ratios PECsurfacewater/PNECwater and PECgroundwater/PNECgroundwater are below 1 and the ratio 
PECsurfacewater/PNECmicroorganisms is below 0.1, no further testing in the aquatic compartment is necessary.

Given that no complete ERA has been submitted, it is not possible to fully conclude on the potential risk of 
paliperiodone to the environment. 
The completed studies (i. e. OECD 232, 307 and 308), including an updated ERA, should be provided as a 
Type II variation. If the results of OECD 308 show >10% of the substance at any time point after or at 14 
days is present in sediment, a study in sediment dwelling organisms should be included. 
The Applicants committed to complete the 3 remaining studies (OECD 232, OECD 307 and OECD 308) and 
finalise the Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) as a post-marketing measure within a variation procedure 
submitted no later than April 2022. A Letter of Commitment was provided accordingly. 
In case a study in sediment dwelling organisms (OECD 218) is warranted, the variation will be delayed to 
accommodate the completion of this additional study, estimated to be submitted no later than the end of 
2023, and an updated Letter of Commitment will be provided once this is known. This was considered 
acceptable. 
The Applicant proposed to file a Type IB variation (code C.I.z) instead of a Type II variation in order to 
submit the stand-alone ERA studies which seem to be in agreement with the applicable EMA Guidance (EMA

2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In the support of this extension application to seek approval for a new 6-month deport formulation, one new 
26-week local tolerance study in minipigs was performed. The new PP6M formulation and the approved PP3M 
formulation (TREVICTA) was included for comparison of local tolerance and toxicokinetics. This strategy to 
bridge to the existing toxicology data on systemic toxicity and to address the local safety of the new 6-month 
formulation was agreed by CHMP (Procedure No.: EMEA/H/SA/1678/2/2016/III). A similar bridging strategy 
was also performed in support of approval of the 3-month deport formulation (TREVICTA). 
In the new 26-week local tolerance study, PP6M was compared to PP3M. Overall, the study design is 
considered adequate. The low doses were set at approximately the maximal recommended human doses of 
paliperidone (per injection site) and the high doses were set to include the maximal human administration 
volume (per injection site). The highest total dose of PP6M at 141 mg eq./kg, exceed the recommended 
maximum clinical dose. 
There was one preterminal mortality during the study that was considered related to treatment. 
Administration of PP6M at 141 mg eq./kg resulted in early termination of one minipig due to a poor clinical 
condition (decreased activity, poor appetite over an extended period and tremors) and body weight loss. The 
moribund condition was likely related to high paliperidone exposure, and potentially injection site pain may 
have affected the general well-being of the animal. The Applicant is of the opinion that this finding does not 
represent a new or heightened safety concern for patients. This position can be agreed given the 
supratherapeutic dose in treatment naïve animals, and the absence of new or unexpected findings at 
necropsy examination. The total dose of the animals given 141 mg eq./kg is more than twice (2 bilateral 
injections of 5.3 mL of 200 mg eq./mL formulation) that of the human max dose (1 unilateral injection of 5.0 
mL of 200 mg eq./mL formulation). Moreover, the body weight of the minipigs was around 15 kg at study 
start to be compared with a weight of 50 kg (or above) in adult patients. Thus, the pigs given the highest 
total dose received a paliperidone dose several folds above the clinical maximum dose. Moreover, the 
minipigs were treatment-naïve while in the clinical situation, PP6M is intended to be used in patients who 
have already demonstrated a therapeutic effect and ability to tolerate PP1M preferably for four months or 
more or PP3M for at least one injection cycle at the time of initiation of PP6M (see SmPC section 4.2). 
In all paliperidone palmitate-dosed groups, test article-related systemic clinical signs included decreased 
activity throughout most of the study, and occasionally repetitive behavior (increased rooting/chewing at the 
cage or cage materials), abnormal gait, reduced appetite, decreased vocalization, and/or tremors.  A higher 
occurrence (number of observations/group) of these findings was generally observed in PP6M- versus PPM3-
dosed animals. 
Treatment-related dermal findings mostly noted throughout the study period in PP3M- and PP6M-treated 
animals generally consisted of very slight to moderate edema at all dose levels and.  PP6M-treated animals at 
70 mg eq./kg initially showed severe edema, but this reaction became less prominent at later time points. 
The more notable reaction in these animals may be related to the presence of large subcutaneous depots 
noted at microscopic evaluation (see below).   
Macroscopic evaluation of the injection sites at 3 (PP3M) or 6 months (PP6M) post dose revealed pale foci and 
pale to white linear striations in the skeletal muscle in some but not all animals treated with PP3M and PP6M 
with no clear dose-response relationship. Most notably, no macroscopic findings were noted in the injection 
sites of the animals treated with PP6M at a total dose of 141 mg eq./kg. These macroscopic observations 
correlated histologically to (multi)focal subcutaneous and intramuscular depots.   
Assessment report  
EMA/502561/2021 
Page 32/83 
 
 
Remaining formulation depots were observed at the injection sites in few animals given PP3M and in several 
animals given PP6M at 35 and 70 mg eq./kg but surprisingly not in animals given the highest total dose of 
PP6M at 141 mg eq./kg. Formulation depots were composed of slightly eosinophilic amorphous material with 
cholesterol-like clefts and (multi) focal mineralization.  These were usually surrounded by a slight to 
moderate chronic inflammatory reaction, mainly composed of infiltrating macrophages and (young) 
fibroblasts. 
A local inflammatory response mainly composed of infiltrating macrophages and multinucleated giant cells in 
the subcutis and/or in interstitium of the skeletal muscle were observed at the injection sites of both PP3M 
and PP6M-treated animals. There was, however, a high individual variation in the injection site reaction, 
largely related to the subcutaneous or intramuscular location of the formulation depot. In animals given one 
unilateral injection of PP6M at 70 mg eq./kg, large subcutaneous depots, surrounded by a limited chronic 
inflammatory response (with less infiltrating macrophages and a higher fibrous component) were noted. In 
animals with intramuscular depots, the formulation depots were generally were smaller and triggered a more 
pronounced inflammatory response. Thus, the inflammatory reaction and its nature were depending on the 
size and location (subcutaneous versus intramuscular). Variations in location and size of the depot and their 
associated inflammatory responses played a role in the different outcomes for these injection site reactions, 
indicating the relevance of a true intramuscular injection for injection site resolution. Considering the small 
size of the M. biceps femoris in minipigs, it seems likely that the subcutaneous depots could be the result of 
subcutaneous rather than intramuscular injection rather than migration of test formulation from the skeletal 
muscle into the subcutaneous tissue. 
The systemic exposure generated by PP3M and PP6M is adequately covered by the combined nonclinical 
safety data from the PP1M as well as from the oral paliperidone and risperidone toxicology programs. 
Taken together, the intramuscular administration of PP3M and PP6M resulted in local dermal irritation and an 
inflammatory response at the injection site. There were no paliperidone palmitate-related changes in 
hematology or clinical chemistry parameters. 
In the clinical trial of BYANNLI, 10.7% of subjects reported injection site related adverse reaction (SmPC 
section 4.8). None of these events were serious or led to discontinuation. Based on the investigators’ ratings, 
induration, redness, and swelling were absent or mild in ≥ 95% of the assessments. Subject-rated injection 
site pain based on a visual analogue scale was low and decreased in intensity over time. 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In the new 26-week local tolerance study, intramuscular administration of PP3M and PP6M resulted in local 
dermal irritation (edema) and an inflammatory response at the injection site. There were large variations in 
the injection site reactions mainly related to the location of the formulation depots (subcutaneous or 
intramuscular). Somewhat more pronounced local reactions were observed in some PP6M treated animals 
and are likely related to the larger administration volume. Apart from this, the nature of the injection site 
reaction was not apparently different between PP3M and PP6M. 
The CHMP considered the following measures necessary to address the non-clinical issues: 
Regarding the environmental risk assessment, the ERA studies in progress (i. e. OECD 232, 307 and 308) 
should be submitted when finalised together with an updated ERA. If the results of OECD 308 show >10% of 
the substance at any time point after or at 14 days is present in sediment, a study in sediment dwelling

organisms should be included. A Letter of Commitment to complete the outstanding studies and the ERA was 
provided accordingly.  
2.6.  Clinical aspects

GCP aspects 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH 
Table 7: Tabular overview of clinical studies 
2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PP6M formulation has a higher injection volume than PP3M and PP1M and should only be dosed in the 
gluteal muscle. PP6M is intended to be used in patients already stabilized on PP3M or PP1M. Patients 
stabilized with 100 mg eq. or 150 mg eq.  PP1M can be transitioned to 700 mg eq. or 1000 mg eq. PP6M 
respectively. Patients stabilized with 350 mg eq. or 525 mg eq. PP3M can be transitioned to 700 mg eq. or 
1000 mg eq. PP6M respectively. 
Objectives of the PK development program for the PP6M included characterization of the PK of paliperidone 
after gluteal injections of PP6M for subjects randomized in Study PSY3015, provision of individual estimates 
of the secondary pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e. AUC for the considered dosing interval [AUCtau], AUC for a 
Assessment report

6-month dosing period [AUC6months], through concentration [Cthrough] and Cmax) and evaluation of common 
clinical questions and dosing scenarios through simulations using the population PK model of PP6M. The 
pharmacokinetic properties of PP6M were measured from semi-intensive PK sampling in 478 subjects in 
phase 3 non-inferiority study R092670PSY3015. The study was conducted in the intended patient population. 
Methods 
Analytical methods 
Plasma samples were analysed for paliperidone and paliperidone palmitate concentrations using validated 
liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) methods.  
Population pharmacokinetic analysis 
The primary objectives of the population PK (popPK) analysis were to characterize the gluteal PK of 
paliperidone after administration of PP6M, provide individual estimates of exposure parameters and to 
evaluate covariate effects and to simulate different dosing scenarios. 
Three intramuscular formulations, PP1M, PP3M and PP6M, were used in study PSY3015. Therefore, the popPK 
model was based on three sub-models, describing the PK after administration of each of these formulations. 
The PP1M and the PP3M models have previously been assessed and were considered qualified for simulations. 
The structural popPK model for PP6M was also considered qualified. 
In total, 20,402 paliperidone plasma concentrations from 811 subjects were used in the final popPK dataset 
for study PSY3015. Of these samples, 15,932 were included in the dataset from 700 subjects in the double-
blind phase, of which 68% were in the PP6M treatment arm and 32% in the PP3M treatment arm. Less than 
1% of the plasma concentrations were excluded from the analysis, due to co-medication, aberrant data, 
outliers and BQL values. 
The PP6M popPK model was a one-compartment disposition model with first-order elimination. The 
absorption model included two depot compartments, one with a saturable rapid absorption process and one 
with a saturable slow absorption process. 
For PP3M, the model slightly underpredicted the observed median after the third and fourth doses and there 
was also a slight overprediction of the variability.

percentiles of observations; Shaded areas: 95% confidence interval around the median, 5th and 95th percentile of

Absorption 
Following IM injection in the multiple dose study, median tmax was reached after 28-30 days. Population PK 
model simulations indicate that the maximum paliperidone concentrations were reached after 33 and 35 
days. 
The bioavailability of PP6M has not been assessed in a dedicated study. 
No bioequivalence study was conducted. The formulation used in PP6M product used in the Phase 3 study 
PSY3015 will be used in the commercial product without any modifications. 
No separate IVIVC was developed for PP6M formulation. The effect of particle size on the in vitro dissolution 
profile and in vivo PK, and the association between the in vitro release rate and in vivo PK profile, was 
confirmed in Study R092670-PSY-1002,16 which was submitted as part of the MAA for PP1M 
(EMEA/H/C/2105). In this study, the range of particle sizes investigated encompassed the particle size used 
in the PP6M product. 
PP6M is restricted to the gluteal muscle and is administered with a 1.5 inch needle only. Thus, effect of 
injection site and needle length on PP6M PK were not investigated. 
The occurrence of measurable prodrug in plasma was infrequently observed in subjects after PP6M dosing 
(4.5 % and 7.7 % after the 700 and 1000 mg eq. doses). Approximately half of prodrug samples in the 
double-blind phase of study PSY3015 were within 2-fold of the LLOQ (0.2 ng/ml). Among these, 2 samples 
had very high concentrations; one subject from PP3M dose had a prodrug concentration of 315 ng/ml and 
one subject from PP6M dose had a prodrug concentration of 99 ng/ml. 
Distribution 
Based on the popPK analysis, the apparent central volume of distribution for paliperidone was 1960 L.  
Assessment report  
EMA/502561/2021 
Page 36/83 
 
 
 
Elimination 
Based on the popPK analysis, the apparent total clearance for paliperidone was comparable to the 1-month 
formulation and the 3-month formulation h. The median apparent half-life was estimated to 148 and 159 
days after administration of 700 andb 1000 mg PP6M, respectively. 
No additional data regarding excretion, metabolism and inter-conversion have been obtained with PP6M. 
Dose proportionality 
The popPK analysis indicated a dose proportional increase in AUC6months, Cmax and Ctrough after administration 
of 700 and 1000 mg eq. PP6M. 
Time dependency 
The mean Ctrough value after 700 mg eq. for PP6M was 17.2 ng/ml after the first injection and 17.6 ng/ml 
after the second injection. The mean Ctrough value after 1000 mg eq. for PP6M was 23.2 ng/ml after the first 
injection and 24.3 ng/ml after the second injection. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
The variability in AUC6month after up to two administrations of 700 mg eq. and 1000 mg eq. doses of PP6M 
ranged from 43 to 48 %. The variability in Cmax was higher and ranged from 56 to 103 %. 
Exposure metrics were derived from the final popPK model’s Empirical Bayes estimates (EBE’s) of the model 
parameters. The inter-individual variability (CV%) was 43-44%, 47-50%, and 53-65% for AUC6months, Cmax 
and Ctrough, respectively. Inter-occasion variability has not been estimated. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Study with PP6M have been conducted in the intended target population. The pharmacokinetics of the PP6M 
formulation has been characterised after multiple-dose in study PSY3015. Dose-normalized mean Ctrough were 
lower for PP6M than PP3M. Dose-normalized mean Cmax was slightly higher for PP6M compared to PP3M. 
Median tmax and dose-normalized AUC6month were comparable for PP6M and PP3M.

eq. and PP6M at 700 or 1000 mg eq. in the Double-blind phase. 
Simulation based on the population pharmacokinetic model 
Different scenarios related to PP6M initiation and maintenance dosing, dosing windows and missed doses 
were simulated based on the final PP1M, PP3M, PP6M and oral paliperidone ER (extended release) models. 
The PP1M, PP3M and ER models have been assessed in previous PP3M application (EMEA/H/C/4066).  
Initiation and Maintenance Regimens 
Simulated paliperidone plasma concentration-time profiles after 4 months of standard treatment with PP1M, 
followed by 4 cycles of PP6M, and thereafter transition to PP1M, are presented in Figure 2. The exposure after 
repeated oral administration of 8 mg and 12 mg paliperidone was used as comparison in the figures with 
moderate and high doses respectively. The Applicant claims that steady-state of the PP6M concentration-time 
profile was attained after the fourth dose, when transitioning from PP1M directly to PP6M. The effect on Cmax 
and Ctrough was less than 2.5% when transitioning from PP1M to PP6M one week later or earlier than the 
monthly scheduled dose. 
Simulations indicate that median paliperidone concentrations can be observed up to 42 months after the 
administration of 1000 mg eq PP6M.

Oral paliperidone ER after termination of PP6M treatment 
Simulations were performed to provide guidance on how to perform the transition of subjects from PP6M to 
oral paliperidone ER in the event of PP6M discontinuation. Potential scenarios included oral dosing 180 days 
after the last steady-state PP6M injection. The oral paliperidone ER tapering schedule proposed by the 
Applicant included 3 mg / 6 mg daily dosing for 3 months followed by an increase in dose to 6 mg / 9 mg 
daily dosing for another 3 months, and finally maintenance dosing with 9 mg / 12 mg for the moderate / high 
PP6M dose levels (Figure 5).

Dosing windows and managing missed doses 
Exposure parameters following the simulations of worst-case scenarios of different dosing windows around 
the regularly scheduled 6-month dosing interval are tabulated in Table 9. 
Table 9: Simulated median (5th and 95th percentiles) of Cmax and Ctrough, when dosing is performed 
1 and 2 weeks earlier and 1, 2, and 3 weeks later. 
Simulations were also performed to address the scenarios when the 5th PP6M dose was missed. Criteria were 
to achieve a quick return to paliperidone plasma concentrations as before the missed dose, without creating 
an overshoot due the applied re-initiation regimen. If more than 6 months and 3 weeks and up to (not 
including) 8 months elapsed since the last steady-state PP6M dose, the paliperidone treatment was re-
initiated with one deltoid PP1M dose (100 mg for the moderate dose and 150 mg for the high dose) for one 
month before continuing the regular PP6M 6-month injection schedule. If between 8 and up to (including) 11 
months have elapsed after the last steady-state PP6M dose, the paliperidone treatment was re-initiated with 
a 100 mg PP1M deltoid injection on Day 1 and Day 8, followed by the regular PP6M 6-month injection 
schedule starting one month after the 2nd PP1M dose. If more than 11 months have elapsed after the last 
steady-state PP6M dose, the paliperidone treatment was re-initiated with a 4-month PP1M cycle, i.e. PP1M

initiation (150 mg PP1M deltoid injection on Day 1 and 100 mg PP1M deltoid injection on Day 8), followed by 
PP1M maintenance (three 100 or 150 mg PP1M deltoid/gluteal injections each month for moderate or high 
dose, respectively) and then a PP6M 6-month regimen. 
Special populations  
No dedicated study has been performed with PP6M in special populations such as patients with renal and 
hepatic impairment.  
Creatinine clearance (CRCL) was included as a covariate on CL in the popPK model. Simulations indicated a 
19-20 % higher median Cmax and Ctrough in subjects with mild renal impairment, 50-80 ml/min, as compared 
to normal subjects after the administration of high PP6M doses. After administration of 700 mg eq. PP6M 
doses to mild RI subjects (50-80 ml/min), the median Cmax and Ctrough was 15-18 % lower relative to those 
with normal renal function on 1000 mg eq. of PP6M. 
Effect on gender, race, age, weight and BMI on the pharmacokinetics of paliperidone was evaluated in study 
PSY3015, using non-compartmental as well as a population PK approach. 
Interactions 
No specific drug interaction studies were conducted with PP6M as data from the studies with PP1M and 
paliperidone ER are considered relevant to PP6M.  
Exposure relevant for safety evaluation 
With the highest recommended dose of 1000 mg eq., the mean paliperidone concentration (AUC6month) after 
the second injection were around 191933 ± 81831 ng*h/ml. The highest Cmax was shown after the first 
injection in the multiple dose study PSY3015, with mean Cmax value of 93.6 ± 61.2 ng/ml. 
Measurable paliperidone palmitate concentrations have been observed in 4.5 % and 7.7 % after the 700 and 
1000 mg eq. doses. The highest observed paliperidone palmitate concentration was 99 ng/ml for PP6M.  
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
 No new pharmacodynamics studies have been performed with PP6M. According to the Applicant no absolute 
individual threshold of paliperidone concentrations been identified that would ensure efficacy. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Methods 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods are adequately performed. The pre-study validation for paliperidone has previously 
been assessed in the PP3M application.  
Population pharmacokinetic analysis 
The final popPK model adequately describes the pharmacokinetics of paliperidone following PP6M 
administration. The goodness-of-fit plots did not show any major trend in the observed versus individual and 
population predicted concentrations. The pcVPC for PP6M seemed adequate. Thus, the model is considered 
acceptable to use for simulations of PP6M.  
Due to the relatively high shrinkage for CL, Kamt1 50 and Kamt3 50 the empirical Bayes estimates (EBE) might be 
biased, and therefore should be interpreted with caution.  
Assessment report  
EMA/502561/2021 
Page 42/83 
 
 
Absorption 
Even though the bioavailability of PP6M has not been assessed in a dedicated study, data seem to be 
suggestive of complete bioavailability.  
According to the applicant, the changes in clinical status were minimal for those who had detectable levels of 
paliperidone palmitate and there was no clear association with the peak plasma concentrations.  
The clinical pharmacokinetics of paliperidone after a single dose of PP6M (700-1000 mg eq.) in the gluteus 
has not been studied. The absence of a single dose PK study is considered acceptable. 
Distribution 
Interpretation of the volume parameter is limited for a formulation with flip-flop kinetics since the disposition 
parameter is masked by the slow absorption. 
Elimination 
Paliperidone exhibits flip-flop kinetics when administered as PP6M, i.e. the apparent half-life is driven by the 
absorption process. The inclusion of half-life in section 5.2 of SmPC is supported by popPK analysis.  
No additional data regarding excretion and metabolism for PP6M is deemed necessary as data obtained with 
the PP1M, PP3M and the oral paliperidone ER formulation are considered appropriate. No additional data 
regarding inter-conversion for PP6M is deemed necessary 
Dose proportionality 
There seems to be an approximately dose proportional increase in AUC6months and Cmax after administration of 
700 and 1000 mg eq. PP6M. Inclusion of dose-proportionality in section 5.2 of SmPC is supported.  
Time dependency 
Based on descriptive statistics there are no indications of a time dependent change in the pharmacokinetics. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
For AUC the inter-individual variability was similar to PP3M formulation but somewhat higher for Cmax 
compared to PP3M.  
Based on the popPK analysis, the inter-individual variability of AUC6months, Cmax and Ctrough were moderate to 
high for PP6M and seemed slightly higher than for PP3M.  
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Peak-to-trough fluctuations were higher after administration of PP6M (peak-to-trough ratio 2.71-3.41) 
compared to after administration of PP3M (peak-to-trough ratio 1.66 to 2.11). AUC6month seemed comparable 
after the second injection of PP6M when compared to PP3M (PP3M 350 mg eq. vs PP6M 700 mg eq. and PP3M 
525 mg eq. vs PP6M 1000 mg eq.).  
Simulations based on the population pharmacokinetic model 
Initiation and Maintenance Regimens 
According to the Applicant is the steady-state plasma concentrations reached after the fourth PP6M injection. 
However, the simulations indicated only a small difference in Cmax and Ctrough between the second and the 
fourth PP6M dose. Peak-to-trough fluctuations were larger for PP6M compared to PP1M and PP3M. The 
simulations indicated that plasma concentrations were relatively stable when switching back to PP1M and 
PP3M from PP6M. The proposed doses for transition between PP1M, PP3M and PP6M is supported by the 
clinical data in study PSY3015 (since similar doses for transition were used in the clinical study) and also by 
the popPK simulations.

Oral paliperidone ER after termination of PP6M treatment 
The proposed dosage recommendations for the switch to oral paliperidone ER after termination of PP6M 
treatment is supported. The median Caverage increased with dose during each of the oral up-titration steps. 
However, the 90% prediction intervals of the exposure metrics for PP6M and paliperidone ER seemed to 
overlap. The proposed dosing recommendations are provided as a guide to healthcare professionals. The 
patients will be treated based on their individual clinical profile. 
Dosing windows and managing missed doses 
The Applicant suggests a 2 weeks earlier and 3 weeks later dosing window than the scheduled 6-month time 
point. Only a small increase in median Cmax was observed when the high PP6M dose was administered 2 
weeks earlier than the target date, supporting that PP6M can be administered up to 2 weeks earlier than 
intended. The median Ctrough decreased from 15.8 ng/ml to 14.4 ng/ml (8.9%) when PP6M 700 mg was 
administered 3 weeks later than the scheduled 6-month time point, and the Ctrough at 5th percentile decreased 
from 2.64 to 1.79 ng/mL (32% reduction).  
The data from the PP6M clinical studies indicated no relationship between low paliperidone concentrations and 
lack of efficacy. Since a dosing window of only +/- 3 days (a maximal dosing window of approximately 1 
week) was allowed for PP6M in the clinical study PSY3015, the study data cannot support the proposed 
dosing window.  
Following the administration of PP6M, PP3M and PP1M at the target dosing intervals (no dosing delays), the 
median Ctrough of PP6M (14.4 ng/mL moderate dose) is lower than that for corresponding doses of PP3M (17.6 
ng/mL at 350 mg e.q.) and PP1M (21.0 ng/mL at 100 mg e.q.) for which dosing windows of ± 14 days and ± 
7 days respectively are recommended. No absolute individual threshold of paliperidone concentrations has 
been identified that would ensure efficacy.  
Even if uncertainties remain regarding the lower boundary of the therapeutic range and an exact time point 
for when the risk for lack of efficacy becomes unacceptable cannot be determined based on available data, 
extending the acceptable dosing window beyond the +/- 3 days tested in the clinical study is reasonable 
given the long half-life of the formulation and the apparently shallow concentration-response relationship. 
The long half-life observed for PP3M is also expected for PP6M.  
In a relapse prevention study for PP3M, the time to the first relapse seemed similar between the placebo 
group (145 patients) and PP3M group (160 patients) during the first 3-4 weeks. Due to the similarities in PK 
between PP3M and PP6M (i.e. a similar long half-lifeis also expected for PP6M), these results seem to support 
a dosing window of +3 weeks.   
Overall, considering clinical practical and logistical aspects and based on the information provided by the 
Applicant, a 2 weeks earlier and 3 weeks later dosing window is supported 
Simulations of the re-initiation of treatment with PP1M and also PP6M (a re-initiation treatment not proposed 
by the Applicant) after a longer interruption with PP6M were provided. The simulations using the proposed 
PP1M re-initiation regimen following the PP6M dose interruption seemed adequate. In addition, re-initiation of 
treatment with PP6M after PP6M dose interruptions up to 11 months after the last steady-state PP6M dose 
indicated similar Cmax and Ctrough of paliperidone after the first and subsequent doses as before the dose 
interruption. The proposed PP1M re-initiation recommendations are similar to the currently approved re-
initiation recommendations after a missed dose of either PP1M or PP3M. Although the data support that the 
similar plasma levels are obtained by a continued 6 months injection even after up to 11 months of delay, the 
Assessment report

proposed recommendation to start over again with PP1M after a missed dose could be motivated from some 
perspectives.  
Special populations  
Specific dosage recommendations for PP6M are only recommended for patients with renal impairment, which 
is supported. PP1M and PP3M, PP6M is not recommended for patients with moderate and severe renal 
impairment. The high dose of PP6M (1000 mg eq.) is not recommended in patients with mild renal 
impairment.  
Interactions 
No additional data regarding interactions is deemed necessary as data obtained with the PP1M, PP3M 
formulation and the oral ER formulation are considered appropriate. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of the new PP6M formulation has been well characterized. The total plasma exposure 
after PP6M was roughly similar to corresponding doses of PP3M. A number of simulations have been 
performed addressing different dosing scenarios to support the dosing recommendations in the SmPC. 
The application is recommended for approval from a pharmacokinetic point of view.

Methods 
Main study PSY3015 
The main study PSY3015 was a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multicenter, interventional, 
parallel-group study. It was designed to determine if the efficacy of PP6M was non-inferior to the efficacy of 
PP3M in clinically stable adults with schizophrenia previously treated with PP1M for at least 4 months, or 
PP3M for at least one 3-month injection cycle.  
The study phases shown in Figure 1.

mg eq. = (paliperidone palmitate) milligrams equivalent (to paliperidone); PP1M = paliperidone palmitate 1-month 
(product); PP3M = paliperidone palmitate 3-month (product); PP6M = paliperidone palmitate 6-month (product). 
a During the Transition Phase, the dose levels and the number of injections depended first on a subject's previous 
treatment and then on his or her individual efficacy and tolerability results. 
b Each subject's Maintenance Phase dose was matched by straightforward progression (PP1M to PP1M, or PP3M to PP3M) 
or by established conversion (PP1M to PP3M) from the same dose that they had been receiving during the Screening Phase 
or at the end of the Transition Phase, as applicable. See Protocol (Appendix 1) for more details. 
c Randomisation occurred on the day of the first double-blind injection (ie, 1 month after the Maintenance Phase injection 
of PP1M, or 3 months after the Maintenance Phase injection of PP3M).  
d The Double-blind Phase included 4 injections for all treatment groups. The active control groups received 1 injection of 
PP3M every 3 months. The investigational drug groups received 1 injection every 3 months in the following sequence: 
PP6M → placebo → PP6M → placebo. 
 Key: 
Screening phase 
The screening phase included discontinuation of disallowed psychotropic medications and completion of an 
oral tolerability test for subjects without documented exposure to risperidone or paliperidone. Eligible 
subjects enrolled in Study PSY3015 entered either the transition phase or the maintenance phase, depending 
on their previous antipsychotic treatment. 
Stability was defined as at least 3 months of injections with the last 2 doses being the same strength. 
Subjects who entered the screening phase on an oral antipsychotic, injectable risperidone, or PP1M 
previously initiated but not yet stabilized entered a transition phase with 1 to 5 injections of PP1M over 1 to 4 
months. The number of injections depended on the subject's previous treatment as well as individual efficacy 
and tolerability results. Subjects who completed the transition phase and met the predefined criteria of 
receiving 100 or 150 mg eq. of PP1M and PANSS total score <70 proceeded to the maintenance phase. 
Also subjects who entered the screening phase with previous PP1M stability as defined above at the 100 or 
150 mg eq. dose, or PP3M stability defined as at least one 3-month injection cycle at 350 or 525 mg eq. 
dose, and for all a PANSS total score of <70 points, proceeded to the maintenance phase.  
Maintenance phase 
During the maintenance phase subjects received either 1 dose of PP1M (100 or 150 mg eq.) or PP3M (350 or 
525 mg eq.) for 1 or 3 months. The maintenance phase dose was matched by straightforward progression 
Assessment report  
EMA/502561/2021 
Page 46/83 
 
 
(PP1M to PP1M, or PP3M to PP3M) or by established conversion (PP1M to PP3M) from the dose they had 
during screening phase or at the end of transition phase, as applicable. The transition and maintenance 
phases are referred to as the open-label phase. 
Subjects who completed the maintenance phase and met the predefined criteria for stability, PANSS total 
score <70 for the 2 previous assessments, proceeded to the double-blind phase. 
Treatments in double-blind phase 
Randomised phase 
The double-blind phase was 12 months in duration and included 2 injection cycles of PP6M (investigational 
drug with alternating placebo) or 4 injection cycles of PP3M. Subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to 
treatment with PP6M or PP3M as follows: 
•  PP6M treatment group: 
The open-label 100 mg eq. PP1M and 350 mg eq. PP3M doses were converted to doubleblind 
 
700 mg eq. doses. 
The open-label 150 mg eq. PP1M and 525 mg eq. PP3M doses were converted to doubleblind 
 
1000 mg eq. doses. 
•  PP3M treatment group: 
The open-label PP1M doses (100 or 150 mg eq.) were converted to double-blind PP3M doses 
 
(350 or 525 mg eq.). 
The open-label PP3M doses (350 or 525 mg eq.) were continued at the same double-blind 
 
dose level. 
Dose adjustment was not permitted during the double-blind phase. Subjects remained in this phase until they 
experienced a relapse event based on prospectively defined criteria, until they met 
discontinuation/withdrawal criteria, or until predefined study conclusion criteria were reached. 
To note, study PSY3015 was not designed to evaluate the efficacy of distinct doses of PP6M. Consistent with 
the anticipated use of PP6M in clinical practice, the selection of the PP6M dose for individual subjects was 
based on the dose of PP1M or PP3M previously optimized for the individual’s treatment during the open-label 
treatment phase. 
Objectives 
The objective of study PSY3015 is considered relevant to the Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal 
products, including depot preparations in the treatment of schizophrenia EMA/CHMP/40072/2010 Rev. 1. The 
primary hypothesis non-inferiority is in accordance to the study protocol for PSY3015 and is considered 
adequate to address the objectives. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the time to relapse during the double-blind phase. The primary endpoint 
was based on the difference in the Kaplan-Meier 12 month estimate of survival (i.e., percentage of subjects 
remaining relapse free) between PP6M and PP3M. 
The date of relapse for an individual subject was defined as the date of the first positive findings from a 
PANSS assessment for symptoms of relapse. 
Assessment report  
EMA/502561/2021 
Page 47/83 
 
 
Protocol-specified relapse criteria involved 1 or more of the following: 
• 
• 
• 
sustained worsening in the PANSS total score (an increase from randomization of 25% if the score at 
randomization was >40, or an increase by 10 points if the score at randomization was ≤40 on 2 
consecutive visits separated by 3 to 7 days); 
clinically significant, overt symptomatology manifested by psychiatric hospitalization, 
suicidal/homicidal ideation or aggressive behavior, or deliberate self-injury and/or violent behavior 
resulting in injury;  
sustained worsening of individual PANSS items of delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory 
behavior, suspiciousness/ persecution, hostility, or uncooperativeness (score of ≥5 if maximum score 
at randomization was ≤3, or score of ≥6 if maximum score at randomization was 4, on 2 consecutive 
visits separated by 3 to 7 days).  
Secondary efficacy endpoints included the mean changes from baseline during the 12-month double-blind 
phase in the following scales:  
• 
• 
• 
PANSS total score on the 30-item PANSS,38 
PANSS subscales (positive, negative, general psychopathology) 
PANSS Marder factors (positive symptoms, negative symptoms, disorganized thoughts, uncontrolled 
hostility/excitement, anxiety/depression)51 
•  CGI-S scale 
• 
• 
Personal and Social Performance (PSP) scale.  
Proportion of subjects during the double-blind phase who met criteria for symptomatic remission, 
based on Andreasen criteria3 and defined as a simultaneous score of mild or less on all selected 
PANSS items (P1, P2, P3, N1, N4, N6, G5, and G9). 
• 
PANSS responder rates 
The validity and reliability of the PANSS has been demonstrated in studies of schizophrenia.5,47 The full 30-
item PANSS was administered at screening, prior to the first dose of PP1M in the transition phase (if 
applicable), prior to the first dose in the maintenance phase, at the end of the maintenance phase, prior to 
the first dose of PP3M or PP6M in the double-blind phase, and at 3-month intervals during the double-blind 
phase. The abbreviated PANSS was used at selected visits when the full PANSS was not administered. It 
consisted of the PANSS items required for assessment of relapse (P1, P2, P3, P6, P7, and G8). 
The CGI-S was conducted at the same time points as the full or abbreviated PANSS, providing investigator 
ratings on the present severity of psychotic disorder, by a 7-point scale ranging from 1 to 7.25  
The PSP was administered at screening, at the start of the transition (if applicable), maintenance and double-
blind phases, and at 3-month intervals during the double-blind phase. The PSP assessed the degree of 
difficulty a subject exhibits over a 7-day period within 4 domains: (1) socially useful activities, (2) personal 
and social relationships, (3) self-care and (4) disturbing and aggressive behavior.58 The PSP has been shown 
to have good validity and test-retest reliability with stable schizophrenia60 and with acute symptoms,64 and to 
show a good correlation with the PANSS.35  
The criteria for determining relapse in Study PSY3015 are in accordance to the study protocol and is 
considered adequate to address the objectives. According to the applicant, criteria for relapse in Study 
PSY3015 were identical to previous clinical studies for the approval of PP3M. Further the applicant has 
Assessment report  
EMA/502561/2021 
Page 48/83 
 
 
 
described the secondary endpoints as being similar to those assessed to support approval of PP3M and PP1M. 
This is agreed and facilitates that outcomes between the different studies can be compared. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Eligible subjects were randomised at Day 1 of the DB phase (visit 7b in the study). To be eligible, subjects 
were required to be clinically stable prior to randomisation according to pre-defined criteria. These have been 
stated to be identical with the corresponding criteria for randomisation in study R092670PSY3011, a non-
inferiority study comparing PP3M with PP1M and the key registration study of PP3M. 
The randomisation used a 2:1 ratio, PP6M:PP3M. Balance was achieved by using randomly permuted blocks 
and was stratified by study site and by moderate or high dose in the Maintenance Phase. Central 
randomisation was implemented by the use of an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS).  
Stratification by moderate or high dose in the maintenance phase is agreed. Stratification by site may have 
been for administrative reasons. By study design, subjects could switch to PP6M from either PP1M or PP3M, 
hence, stratification by PP1M or PP3M could in addition have been considered. 
The sponsor and all study-site personnel except for the study drug administrator were to be blinded to the 
administration of the study drug during the Double-blind Phase. Due to differences in syringe sizes for PP3M 
versus PP6M, the study drug administrator was allowed only to prepare and administer injections, contact 
IWRS to receive subject medication kit numbers, and to keep drug administration and accountability 
information. The subject and study staff, other than the study drug administrator, were not allowed to view 
the syringe or needle or to observe the injection. The subject was instructed to look away during the injection 
and related steps before and after.  
To maintain the blind, the subjects who were assigned to treatment with PP6M received injections of placebo 
at the 3-month time points between their 6-month doses of investigational drug.  
The investigator/sub investigator who assessed the injection site for tenderness, erythema/redness, and 
induration/swelling was not allowed to review the subject's visual analogue scale (VAS) rating of the injection 
site pain. In addition, the sponsor and all study-site personnel were to be blinded to the results of PK 
measurements and prolactin measurements until the time of database lock and unblinding. 
During the double-blind phase all administrations were in the gluteal muscles only. Although the blinding 
procedure is not considered optimal in that the subject was instructed to look away, this should have been 
facilitated by the site of the injection. 
Statistical methods 
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) for Study PSY3015: version 4.0 was dated 26 May 2020 and includes an 
amendment history. Added with version 2 (5 April 2019) was the definition of the primary estimand, 
supplementary estimands and corresponding analyses with reference to a draft of the ICH E9 addendum 
available in early 2019. The changes made were not to affect the detailed analyses specified in the previous 
version of the SAP finalized on 16 Mar 2018 (version 1.0). 
The double-blind intent-to-treat analysis population (DB ITT) included all subjects who were randomly 
assigned to either PP6M or PP3M during the Double-blind Phase and received at least 1 dose of double-blind 
study drug. This was the primary analysis population for the primary efficacy endpoint.  
The per-protocol analysis population included subjects who were randomised (to PP6M or PP3M) during the 
Double-blind Phase and received at least 1 dose of double-blind study drug excluding subjects with major 
protocol violations/deviations. Subjects with a major deviation and/or a major protocol violation were 
Assessment report  
EMA/502561/2021 
Page 49/83 
 
 
identified prior to database lock and unblinding. Same main analysis, sensitivity analyses and supplementary 
analyses as defined for the DB ITT population were repeated based on the PP population. 
If a subject had received at least one dose of double-blind study drug but then relapsed or had met other 
relevant conditions for withdrawal or discontinuation, then the subject was to enter a Follow-up Phase. The 
Follow-up Phase ended 12 months after the subject's first double-blind injection and was meant to collect 
supplementary poststudy data in terms of minimum safety information (i.e., adverse events) and minimum 
efficacy information (i.e., relapse status).  
The primary efficacy estimand was defined as follows: 
The population was restricted to those who were stabilized on either PP1M or PP3M during the Maintenance 
Phase and meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
The variable was time to first occurrence of a relapse event during the Double-blind Phase.  
The intercurrent events and corresponding strategies were the following: 
• Treatment discontinuation – Hypothetical Strategy: After treatment discontinuation, assume similar efficacy 
for subjects who discontinued as those subjects from the same treatment group who did not discontinue the 
treatment. 
• Major protocol violations – Treatment Policy Strategy: use all relapse events, regardless of whether or not 
major protocol violations had occurred. 
The population-level summary was the difference in Kaplan-Meier estimate at Month 12 of relapse-free 
proportions between the two treatment groups. 
Subjects who met at least one of the pre-defined criteria for a relapse during the Double-blind Phase before 
DB Month 12 date were considered to have had a relapse event. Under the primary estimand only the relapse 
events occurring during the Double-blind Phase prior to treatment discontinuation were counted as events in 
the primary analysis.  
Subjects still in the DB phase up to the date of DB Month 12 without a relapse event, were censored at the 
date of the DB Month 12 whether the date was before or after Day 365. Subjects who discontinued treatment 
(and therefore the Double-blind Phase) before Day 365 without a relapse event, were censored at the day of 
discontinuation. 
For the main analysis, the Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the Month 12 cumulative estimate of 
survival (i.e., percentage of subjects remaining relapse-free). Standard Error (SE) estimates were based 
upon Greenwood’s formula. Non-inferiority of PP6M to PP3M was to be concluded if the lower limit of the 2-
sided 95% confidence interval of the difference in the relapse-free rates between PP6M and PP3M exceeded -
10%. 
As a sensitivity analysis a Tipping Point analysis has been performed based on the assumption that subjects 
on PP6M who discontinued prematurely had a higher relapse hazard starting from the discontinuation time, 
compared with similar subjects who remained in the DB phase. For the PP3M group, the ignorable censoring 
assumption was maintained. 
Three supplementary estimands were defined to support the primary estimand. The only component that 
changed from the definition of the primary estimand was how the strategy for treatment discontinuation was 
defined. For subjects who discontinued treatment during the Double-blind phase and entered the Follow up 
phase, their last day of the Follow up phase was recorded as the trial disposition date. 
To evaluate the consistency of the results in various subgroups, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to relapse 
was used for the analysis of a number of pre-defined subgroups. The treatment difference between PP6M and 
PP3M groups at Month 12 and its 95% confidence interval were reported and a forest plot was used for 
graphical display.

There was no adjustment for multiple testing for the secondary efficacy analyses.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The rates of relapse during the double-blind phase were 7.5% (n=36) of subjects in the PP6M group and 
4.9% (n=11) of subjects in the PP3M. However, study PSY3015 did not identify an association between lower 
PP6M paliperidone trough levels and increased relapse rate as compared to PP3M. The relapses in the PP6M 
group was considered not to cluster near visits corresponding to trough plasma paliperidone concentrations. 
Visual exploration of individually predicted plasma paliperidone concentration-time profiles in subjects who 
relapsed indicated relapse events being distributed throughout the dosing cycles. The distribution of 
concentrations at the time of relapse appeared to cover the entire 90% prediction interval range of the 
population simulations.  
Given the small reported numbers, the Applicant in round 2 has added preliminary data from the extension 
study PSY3016 for relapse events. The 5 clinically defined relapse events were distributed across the dosing 
interval (day 4, 20, 105, 122, 156 after last PP6M dose). However, in PSY3016 clinical criteria only are used 
for relapse, and not the additional PANSS scoring used in PSY3015.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The study design of PSY3015 is relevant to Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products, including 
depot preparations in the treatment of schizophrenia EMA/CHMP/40072/2010 Rev. 1, and in agreement with 
previous SA with CHMP. The PSY3015 study design was discussed within a scientific advices 
(EMEA/H/SA/1678/2/2016/III), as a response to the initially proposed non-inferiority margin of -12.5%, a NI 
margin of -10% was recommended (FU advice: EMEA/H/SA/1678/2/FU/1/2017/II).  
Also, the dose selection for PP6M and PP3M was agreed to by CHMP prior to the start of Study PSY3015. The 
inclusion of patients for randomisation and dosage after randomisation are in accordance to the study 
protocol for PSY3015 and are considered adequate to address the objectives.  
The methods for randomisation are in accordance to the study protocol and considered adequate to address 
the objectives. To be eligible, subjects were required to be clinically stable prior to randomisation according 
to pre-defined criteria. These have been stated to be identical with the corresponding criteria for 
randomisation in study PSY3011, a non-inferiority study comparing PP1M with PP3M and the key registration 
study of PP3M. 
Overall the baseline characteristics are considered adequate to address the objectives, being balanced 
between PP6M and PP3M treatment groups in the randomised phase of Study PSY3015, in accordance to the 
study protocol. Consistent with scientific advice from CHMP, more than 25% of subjects were enrolled and 
treated at sites in the EU during the double-blind phase (n=193 [28%]).  
Stratification by moderate or high dose in the maintenance phase is agreed. Stratification by site may have 
been for administrative reasons. It is nonetheless acknowledged that none of the stratification variables were 
accounted for in the primary analysis of the primary endpoint. By study design, subjects could switch to 
PP6M from either PP1M or PP3M, hence, the applicant could in addition have considered stratification by 
PP1M or PP3M. 
In line with the sought indication it was considered important to have adequate numbers of subjects treated 
with either PP1M or PP3M in the Maintenance Phase for randomisation to the Double-blind Phase. Based on 
low expected enrolment of subjects previously treated with PP3M, some subjects (after appropriate 
treatment with PP1M) were to be switched to PP3M during the Maintenance Phase.  This was to occur early in 
the course of the study and until the target of approximately one-half of the total Maintenance Phase sample 
was treated with PP3M. The distribution of the in total 767 subjects in the maintenance phase between PP1M 
and PP3M respectively ended up being 362 (47.2%) and 405 (52.8%). The proportion of subjects

subsequently randomised were high albeit slightly lower among those having been treated with open-label 
PP3M (88.9%) than among those treated with open-label PP1M (94.5%). 
What implications, if any, an invoked switch from PP1M to PP3M could have had on the outcome in the 
randomised part of the study is not clear. However, this switch occurred pre-randomisation and despite not 
being a stratification factor, the proportion of subjects switching from PP1M and PP3M to randomised 
treatment was balanced between randomised arms.  
The applicant has concluded on assay sensitivity and refers to that study PSY3015 shared several design 
elements with the placebo-controlled, randomised withdrawal study with PP3M (PSY3012) as well as with 
PSY3011, used to demonstrate non-inferiority of PP3M versus PP1M. The criteria used to define relapse was 
identical across the three studies. Further, all three studies have been stated to have shared similar eligibility 
criteria, with the exception PANSS total score at study entry. According to the Applicant the latter implied 
that the PSY3015 study population could be considered overall more stable with regard to schizophrenia 
symptoms. At the double-blind phase baseline, the patient populations were nonetheless very similar: for 
PSY3015 the mean (median) total PANSS score 52 (53) and 3.0 (3) for CGI-S; for PSY3011 the mean 
(median) total PANSS score 58 (60) and 2.9 (3) for CGI-S; for PSY3012 mean (median) total PANSS score 55 
(56) and 2.7 (3) for CGI-S. 
Given shared characteristics, comparisons between studies could be considered relevant. According to the 
Applicant, the assay sensitivity of PSY3015 can be clinically inferred as the results of study PSY3012 
demonstrated efficacy of PP3M compared with placebo, and since the results of PSY3015 has shown that 
PP6M is non-inferior to PP3M. While the leap from the comparison between PP3M and placebo in study 
PSY3012 may seem somewhat farfetched given differences in study design and study objective, it is agreed 
that the percentage of relapse events in the PP3M arm (4.9%) appear similar as in study PSY3011 (7.9%) . 
The scope of the 6-monthly injection is stated to be in order to further improve adherence and convenience. 
Albeit a double-blind design is mandatory given the disease setting and study objective, nor adherence or 
convenience could be assessed given the study design. 
During the double-blind phase, the subject and all study-site personnel except for the study drug 
administrator were to be blinded. Due to differences in syringe sizes for PP3M versus PP6M, the study drug 
administrator was allowed only to e.g. prepare and administer injections. Although the blinding procedure is 
not considered to have been optimal in that the subject was instructed to look away, this should have been 
facilitated by the injection site being the gluteal muscle due to the larger volume associated with a PP6M 
dose. One concern is whether it was not possible for a subject randomised to switch to PP6M to feel a 
difference since already familiar with PP1M and/or PP3M injections. More subjects in the PP6M, 59/478 
(12.3%) than in the PP3M 11/224 (4.9%) arm reported injection site related AEs, the most common in both 
arms, being injection site pain. However, treatment compliance was similar in the two treatment arms. To 
maintain the blind, subjects randomised to PP6M received placebo injections at the 3-month time points 
between their 6-month doses of investigational drug. 
The randomisation used a 2:1 ratio, PP6M:PP3M, and was stratified by study site and dose level in the 
maintenance phase. Stratification by moderate or high dose level at baseline is agreed. Being in line with the 
sought indication, subjects could switch to PP6M from either PP1M or PP3M, hence, stratification by PP1M or 
PP3M could in addition have been considered. The targeted sample size was 549 subjects. Due to a much 
lower dropout rate than expected in the open-label phase, the total number of randomised subjects was 702 
(478:PP6M, 224:PP3M). 
The scope with the PP6M is to allow longer time periods between administrations and the primary objective 
was to show non-inferiority between administrations every 6-month compared with administrations every 3-
month. To be randomised subjects had to be stable on treatment with either PP3M or PP1M. As a comment 
regarding the study design it had been preferred if subjects randomised to the control arm could have 
remained on their maintenance treatment regimen to avoid to also have subjects in the control arm switching 
to a treatment regimen implying longer intervals between administrations. In this respect it is found 
Assessment report  
EMA/502561/2021 
Page 62/83 
 
 
reassuring that the subgroup analyses on the primary endpoint based on maintenance dose regimen 
(PP1M/PP3M) showed consistent outcomes. In line with what had been planned, half of randomised subjects 
were on PP1M and despite not being a stratification factor, the proportion of subjects switching from PP1M 
and PP3M to randomised treatment was balanced between randomised arms.   
Further, the concept of bio-creep may be worth considering: the claimed efficacy of PP6M is based on a non-
inferiority exercise versus PP3M while in turn, the claimed efficacy of PP3M is based on non-inferiority versus 
PP1M. In this respect, it is recognised that a more stringent NI margin was used in study PSY3015 (-10%) 
than in study R092670PSY3011 (-15%), a non-inferiority study comparing PP3M with PP1M and the key 
registration study of PP3M. 
Previous discussion regarding the design characteristics of study R092670PSY3011 is applicable also here and 
concern assay sensitivity and the need to consider that the PP6M treatment effect is mixed with a certain 
unknown placebo effect due to the placebo injections month 3 and month 9 to maintain study blind. 
The criteria used to define relapse was identical across these two studies and regarding assay sensitivity, the 
percentage of relapse events in the PP3M arm (4.9%) appear similar as in study PSY3011 (7.9%) Of some 
reassurance regarding study design and conduct is that the percentage of relapse events was higher in the 
PP6M arm than in the PP3M arm. Overall, there were few relapse events observed during the 12 months 
double-blind phase offering support to the efficacy of both treatments.  
In the primary analysis, the censoring rate was high (>92%). For the majority this was due to study 
completion/end of study. The percentage of subjects who discontinued (study/treatment) is acceptable and 
was in total 12.0% (84/702): in the PP6M arm this concerned 13.0% (62/478) and in the PP3M arm 9.8% 
(22/224). The most common reason irrespective of treatment arm was withdrawal by subject. However, the 
completion rate is considered adequate to address the objectives in PSY3015. All randomised subjects were 
included in the ITT set. The PP set included 96.9% (PP3M) and 96.7% (PP6M) of the subjects in the ITT. 
While this may imply a well conducted study it could also imply that the criteria used to define the PP 
population were too generous. It is noted that the proportion of subjects with protocol deviations was slightly 
higher in the PP6M treatment arm, 10.5% (50/478) than in the PP3M arm, 7.6% (17/224). 
Study completion was 08 May 2020, which included a period during which the COVID-19 pandemic was 
occurring globally. The applicant has described that when disruption to the pandemic started, the trial was 
already fully enrolled, and all subjects had received all injections of study drug, with most subjects having 
completed the study, and has concluded that the impact was minimal. This is agreed based on the pre-
defined supplementary analysis performed to evaluate the potential impact of COVID-19 that was included in 
the SAP that was finalized before database lock (10 June 2020). The submitted statistical analysis plan (SAP) 
version 4.0 was dated 26 May 2020. 
The original analysis plan was in accordance with scientific advice received and at the time, the ICH E9(R1) 
was not yet implemented. Added with SAP version 2 was the definition of the primary estimand, 
supplementary estimands and corresponding analyses with reference to a draft of the ICH E9 addendum 
available in early 2019. According to the applicant, the changes made were not to affect the analyses 
specified in the SAP version 1.0 (finalized on 16 Mar 2018).  
Primary analyses were performed based on the ITT (all randomised) and the PP population from which very 
few were excluded and thereby was the ITT and PP outcomes respectively very similar. The PP set included 
96.9% (PP3M) and 96.7% (PP6M) of the subjects in the ITT. This may imply either a well conducted study or 
a too generously defined PP population. Considering all protocol violations/deviation there were a higher 
percentage of subjects concerned in the PP6M treatment arm, 10.5% (50/478) than in the PP3M arm, 7.6% 
(17/224).  
The added primary and supplementary estimands is per se appreciated. The primary estimand implied the 
use of a hypothetical strategy in case of treatment/study discontinuation and hence assumed similar efficacy 
for subjects who discontinued as those subjects from the same treatment group who did not discontinue

treatment. This is not agreed why the performed supplementary analyses are endorsed in that they included 
follow-up data collected during an optional follow-up phase meant to collect poststudy data in terms of 
minimum safety information (i.e., adverse events) and minimum efficacy information (i.e., relapse status). Of 
the in total 84 subjects who withdrew early, 43 continued in the follow-up phase. No relapse events were 
observed during the follow-up phase and the results from the analysis of the supplementary estimands (S1-
S3) were shown to be very similar compared with the primary efficacy analysis. Information revealing the 
distribution across randomised arms of the 43 subjects who continued in the FU phase was lacking and the 
MAH has now confirmed both the total and the number per randomised arm. Of those 43 subjects who 
provided follow-up data, 7 had been randomised to the PP3M arm and 36 had been randomised to PP6M arm.  
There were no adjustments for multiple testing for analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints. Considered to 
have implications for the data to be presented in the SmPC it is acknowledged that the only outcome 
proposed in section 5.1 is for the primary endpoint. This is hence agreed. 
Subjects in the randomised phase were subject to frequent study contacts. All were plasma sampled by 2 
weeks intervals or more, in addition PP6M received placebo injections after 3 + 9 months. All subjects also 
frequently completed symptom scales at least at monthly visits, being actively screened for symptoms in 
progress and potential relapse.  
The magnitude of the placebo effect on psychiatric symptoms from these frequent active care contacts was 
not discussed by the MAH but those activities presumably has contributed to rather high relapse-free rates 
for both products. The Applicant has added in the SmPC 5.1, the wording …injection every 3 months with 
regular scheduled visits between injections...  to clarify that efficacy of PP6M without continuous care 
contacts in between the PP6M injections has not been studied.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Subgroups 
The results across prespecified population subgroups sex, age, race, baseline BMI, region, dose level in 
maintenance phase, dose regimen in maintenance phase were generally consistent with the results of the 
primary endpoint analysis. The lower bound of the 95% CI for a few subgroups (eg, 18 to 25- year old age 
group, US region, Black race) was lower than -10% due to the small size of the subgroups that led to very 
wide confidence intervals. 
Efficacy by Dose Level (700 or 1000 mg eq.) 
To note, the choice of dose regimen during the maintenance phase (PP1M or PP3M) was not based on 
randomization, but on the subject’s pre-study status. Likewise, the choice of eq. dose (700 mg. eq. or 1000 
mg) was not based on randomization but determined at the beginning of the maintenance phase. The study 
was not designed to evaluate the efficacy of individual dose levels. 
The relapse-free rates at Month 12 in the double-blind phase were similar for the PP6M dose levels 700 mg. 
eq. (92.1%) and 1000 mg. eq (91.7%), and the number of subjects were also similar (700 mg. eq.: 230 
subjects; 1000 mg. eq.: 248 subjects). The results of a subgroup analysis of the relapse-free rate at Month 
12 by maintenance phase dose level showed comparable efficacy for the moderate and high dose levels.  
Assessment report  
EMA/502561/2021 
Page 64/83 
 
 
 
 
Efficacy by Maintenance Dose Regimen (PP1M or PP3M) 
The relapse-free rates at Month 12 during the double-blind phase were similar for PP6M subjects who were 
transitioned from PP1M in the maintenance phase (91.6%) and those who were transitioned from PP3M in the 
maintenance phase (92.3%). The number of subjects in each subgroup were also similar (PP1M: 231 subjects 
and PP3M: 247 subjects). The results of a subgroup analysis of the relapse-free rate at Month 12 by 
maintenance phase dose level showed comparable efficacy for the PP1M and PP3M maintenance phase dose 
regimens.  
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, consistent data from study PSY3015 demonstrate non-inferior efficacy of PP6M comparable to that of 
PP3M, in the treatment of stabilised adult patients with schizophrenia who have been adequately treated with 
either PP1M for 4 months or PP3M for one 3-month injection cycle. In turn, the efficacy of PP3M is based on 
non-inferiority previously shown versus PP1M. There was no evidence that the efficacy of PP6M fluctuated 
during the 6-month dose interval.  
The potential for unblinding from minor differences in between injection methods, and of reported injection-
related TEAEs, is considered to have had no significant impact on the efficacy results. The primary efficacy 
data appear consistent with subgroups. Overall, the efficacy data for PP6M are considered to be robust. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
In the Open-label phase before the double-blind phase of Study PSY3015, 838 subjects with schizophrenia 
received at least 1 dose of PP1M or PP3M. In the double-blind phase, a total of 702 subjects were randomized 
of which 224 received PP3M and 478 received PP6M. As of the cutoff date of 29 May 2020, the mean (SD) 
duration of exposure was 96.3 (37.87) days in the PP6M group during the Open-label Phase. The mean (SD) 
dose of PP6M was 888.8 (145.31) mg eq. during the study.  
There were pronounced differences in disease severity at the OL baseline between subjects treated with PP3M 
in the DB phase of studies PSY3011 and PSY3015.  
All injections in the DB phase of Study PSY3015 were administered in glutea, since PP6M is required to be 
administered in the glutea due to the high injection volume.  
PP6M is only available in two different strength (ie 700 mg and 1000 mg), whereas PP1M and PP3M is 
available in equipotent strengths as well as additional strengths. The consequences are that PP6M will not be 
an alternative for some patients.  
The risperidone metabolite 9OH-risperidone is paliperidone. According to the SmPC, transition from 
risperidone to PP6M or from PP6M to risperidone is not an alternative.  
Based on the plasma concentration curves and Pop PK simulations, there is a potential increased risk for 
ADRs the period directly after injection of PP6M and a potential risk for lack of effect during the end of the 
dosing interval.  
The amount of active substance in PP6M is high, and equivalent to extensive overdose. However, according 
to AE data as well as data on plasma concentrations vs AE/safety, there are no indications of dose dumping 
or medication error.  
Assessment report  
EMA/502561/2021 
Page 65/83 
 
 
To avoid a missed dose of PP6M, patients may be given the injection up to 2 weeks before or 3 weeks after 
the scheduled 6-month time point, according to the SmPC. (A dosing window of ± 14 days is recommended 
for the approved PP3M product). The 5-weeks window for PP6M is based on pharmacokinetic and clinical data 
as well as clinical practical considerations.  
2.6.8.2.  Adverse events 
During the double-blind phase, the overall rates of TEAEs and rates of TEAEs in all MedDRA system organ 
classes (SOCs), as well as those of common individual TEAEs were well balanced between the PP6M and 
PP3M groups.  
The TEAE reported more frequently in the PP6M group (at least 3% difference) were injection site related, as 
in the PP6M group 12.3% reported injection site-related TEAEs as compared to in the PP3M group 4.9%. No 
injection site-related TEAEs were assessed as serious and none resulted in study drug discontinuation.  
The total incidence of injection site-related TEAEs was almost identical between the PP6M 700 mg eq. and 
PP6M 1000 mg eq. groups (12.1% and 12.6%, respectively).  
Weight increased was the most frequently reported TEAE in both treatment groups. In both groups, most 
TEAEs were considered to be mild or moderate in intensity, with few individual TEAEs in the psychiatric 
disorders SOC reported as severe in more than 1 subject each. 
Overall, the types and rates of clinically significant AEs of special interest in subjects treated with PP6M were 
consistent with the safety profile of PP3M and PP1M. There were no cases of NMS, rhabdomyolysis, or acute 
kidney injury among subjects treated with PP6M in Study PSY3015, nor were there any cases of overdose in 
the PP6M group of Study PSY3015. During the double-blind phase, TEAEs related to somnolence and sedation 
occurred in a low percentage of subjects in the PP6M (1.9%) and PP3M (1.3%) groups. The potential for 
overdose with PP6M is limited because it is administered by a healthcare professional; the product is not 
intended to be self-administered by patients. There were 2 non-fatal, non-serious cases of overdose or 
accidental overdose in the PP3M group during the double-blind phase of Study PSY3015; both cases have 
been confirmed as dosing errors by the site staff. 
The frequency of EPS-related TEAEs during the double-blind phase was low and consistent for the PP6M 
(9.6%) and PP3M (8.5%) groups. None of the EPS-related TEAEs in subjects treated with PP6M were serious; 
1 subject treated with PP6M experienced an EPS-related TEAE of Parkinsonism which led to study drug 
discontinuation. Changes in EPS rating scale scores and use of anticholinergic medications during the double-
blind phase were similar in both PP6M and PP3M groups.  
Overall, the types and rates of clinically significant AEs of special interest in subjects treated with PP6M were 
consistent with the safety profile of PP3M and PP1M.  
A total of 42 ADRs were identified for PP6M which included 29 grouped terms and 13 individual preferred 
terms and comprised 94 distinct preferred terms No new ADRs were identified for PP6M compared with other 
approved paliperidone or risperidone products.

Injection Site 
Injection Site-related Events  
Concerns regarding injection site reactions as well as pain at the injection site have been raised in the 
previous use of LAI antipsychotics by some health care professionals. The PP6M product differs from PP3M 
and other LAI antipsychotics by the large injection volumes, up to 5.0 ml.

Injection Site Evaluations by Subjects 
•  Subjects were asked about the pain associated with the injection by means of a 100-mm VAS, scaled 
from "no pain at all" to "unbearably painful." The VAS-Acute assessed pain once within 30 minutes 
after each injection. The VAS-Residual assessed pain at the time points days or weeks later as 
indicated in the Time and Events Schedules in the protocol Appendix 1. 
Injection Site Evaluations and Follow-up by Investigators 
• 
• 
• 
Investigators or subinvestigators evaluated the injection sites for tenderness, erythema/redness, and 
induration/swelling, at the same time points as the VASs completed by the subject, plus at the End-of-
Study Visit or at the time of early withdrawal. The characteristics were scored as 0 = absent, 1 = mild, 
2 = moderate, or 3 = severe. The scales and anchors are a hybrid from the Sponsor's previous studies 
of PP3M and from a US FDA guidance. 
The results were recorded on the eCRF. Every effort was made to have the same individual perform all 
injection site evaluations for a particular subject. The investigator/subinvestigator completed these 
assessments within 30 minutes after the injection and at all visits marked in the Time and Events 
Schedules (Appendix1) thereafter; for any characteristic still rated mild, moderate, or severe at the last 
marked visit, the investigator/subinvestigator added assessments at subsequent visits until all of the 
characteristics were rated absent.  
The investigator followed any clinically significant abnormalities persisting at the end of the study until 
resolution or until reaching a clinically stable endpoint. 
During the double-blind phase, a greater percentage of subjects in the PP6M group reported injection site-
related TEAEs (12.3%) compared with the PP3M group (4.5%). TEAEs of injection site pain were the most 
frequently reported local reactions in both treatment groups (PP6M: 7.7% and PP3M: 4.0%). None of the 
injection site-related TEAEs observed during the Double-blind Phase were reported as serious or severe, lead 
to "dose interruption" or resulted in study drug discontinuation.  
The total incidence of injection site-related TEAEs was almost identical between the PP6M 700 mg eq. and 
PP6M 1000 mg eq. groups (12.1% and 12.6%, respectively). To note, the TEAE of injection site pain was 
reported for a greater percentage of subjects receiving the high dose of PP6M (9.1%) compared with those 
receiving the moderate dose (6.5%). 
Among the 27 events reported as “moderate” or “severe” intensity, 3.6% of subjects in the PP6M group and 
1.3% of subjects in the PP3M group reported at least one injection site-related TEAE of "moderate" intensity, 
with no "severe" event. 
Also for the placebo doses given in between PP6M doses, injection site-related TEAEs were reported; e.g. for 
placebo high dose 7 events of “Injection site pain”, “Very likely related to study Agent”, and for placebo 
moderate dose, 5 events of “Injection site pain”, “Very likely related to study Agent”. 
While most injection site-related TEAEs were reported on the day of the injection, median time to onset 
ranged from 1.0 to 3.0 days across the different injections. The TEAE median durations varied from 3.0 days 
[placebo moderate dose] to 22.5 days [PP3M 525 mg eq. dose], however no clear overall pattern was 
observed for different injection volumes.

Injection Site Ratings 
In Study PSY3015, mean subject ratings of injection site pain were similar for PP6M and PP3M throughout the 
double-blind phase, and decreased in intensity over the course of the study (ie, improved tolerability). 
Subjects' evaluations of the intensity of the pain showed similar decreases for the moderate and high dose 
level in the PP6M group. 
Based on the investigators’ assessments, the injection was well tolerated. Induration, redness and swelling in 
both groups were mild in intensity during the double-blind phase. The rates of reported induration, redness 
and swelling were similar between the PP6M and PP3M groups over time. Investigator evaluation of 
tenderness was higher for subjects in the PP6M group versus the PP3M group, although the majority were 
mild.  
There is no further data reported from at least 8 cases which should have been referred to further 
examinations according to the study protocol and the Scientific Advice EMA/CHMP/SAWP/601629/2016. In no 
case such data from dermatological specialists, biopsies or radiological examination were available. Only one 
case had been referred to specialist, and that specialist report had not been collected.  
Based on the investigators’ clinical assessments, the Applicant concludes “across the Open-label and Double-
blind Phases, none of the moderate or severe injection site-related TEAEs reported were suggestive of 
suspected cellulitis or abscess, nodule, fibroma, furuncle or other noninfectious reaction which would have 
required referral to a dermatologist or surgeon for consideration of fine needle aspiration and/or tissue biopsy 
or for incision or drainage procedures”.  
Furthermore, subgroup analyses of TEAEs by age and BMI did not show any clear differences in the 
incidences of injection site-related TEAEs according to age group (18-25, 26-50, 51-65, or >65 years) or BMI 
category (<25, 25-30, or >30 kg/m2  in the PP6M or PP3M groups.  However, the sample size in the 
subgroup aged >65 years was small (n=3 for PP3M; n=8 for PP6M). 
) 
Additional subgroup analyses of the investigator’s evaluation of the injection site by age group and by 
baseline BMI showed a similar pattern of injection related TEAEs across the various age groups and BMI 
categories. 
Prolactin 
Prolactin-related Adverse Events and Laboratory Changes 
After randomization to PP6M or PP3M in Study PSY3015, the mean change in serum prolactin from double-
blind baseline to double-blind end point was -2.190 µg/L for males and -4.828 µg/L for females in the PP6M 
group and 1.555 µg/L for males and 9.029 µg/L for females in the PP3M group. In males, median prolactin 
levels remained relatively stable throughout the maintenance and double-blind phases in both treatment 
groups, whereas in female subjects, median prolactin levels increased from maintenance phase baseline to 
double-blind baseline in both treatment groups. During the double-blind phase, median prolactin levels for 
female subjects continued to increase from double-blind baseline through Week 3 in both groups and then 
returned to the double-blind baseline level at Month 6. Median prolactin levels again increased through Month 
7 and returned to the double-blind baseline level at Month 12, the end of the double-blind phase. 
High prolactin levels relative to the maintenance phase baseline were noted in a similar percentage of 
subjects in the PP6M and PP3M groups in both males (approximately 35%) and females (approximately 
30%). 
Although elevations in prolactin concentrations were observed in some subjects, most of those were 
asymptomatic in both men and women. The incidence of potentially prolactin-related TEAEs during the 
double-blind phase of Study PSY3015 was similar for female subjects in the PP6M and PP3M groups (9.2% 
and 8.6%, respectively), and was lower among male subjects in both treatment groups (PP6M: 1.2%; PP3M: 
0.6%). None of these events during the double-blind phase were serious or led to study drug discontinuation.

Overall, the patterns of Prolactin-related Adverse Events and of prolactin level variations in PSY3015 are in 
line with data from the previous study PSY3011 (comparing PP3M to PP1M). No clinically significant 
differences between PP3M and PP6M were identified.  
Body weight 
Weight gain, a known effect of paliperidone, was seen with PP6M. The mean [SD] increase in body weight 
over a similar duration of treatment (double-blind baseline to double-blind end point) was smaller in the 
PP6M group (0.10 [4.959] kg, corresponding mean increase in BMI of 0.0 [1.72] kg/m2) than the PP3M 
group (0.96 [5.103] kg and 0.3 [1.78] kg/m2).  
The percentage of subjects who had ≥7% weight gain at the double-blind endpoint compared to the double-
blind baseline was 10.6% in the PP6M group and 13.2% in the PP3M group. The percentage of subjects who 
had ≥7% weight gain at any time during the double-blind phase compared to the double-blind baseline was 
12.8% in the PP6M group and 17.0% in the PP3M group. The incidence of TEAEs related to weight gain was 
similar across both treatment groups (PP6M: 9.2% and PP3M: 8.0%). The percentages of subjects who 
experienced a weight decrease of ≥7% from double-blind baseline to end point were 9.1% and 6.8% for the 
PP6M and PP3M groups. The most frequently reported TEAE related to weight gain was weight increased in 
both the PP6M (8.4%) and PP3M (7.6%) groups. 
Metabolic Effects  
Treatment-emergent diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia-related events were not common in Study 
PSY3015, consistent with the absence of treatment-emergent marked abnormalities in glucose levels. 
Treatment with PP6M also was not associated with any clinically significant increase in lipid abnormalities. 
2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In the 2 studies included in the PP6M clinical development program, there were a total of 4 deaths in subjects 
treated with paliperidone palmitate (PP6M, PP3M or PP1M, up to the clinical cutoff of 29 May 2020), including 
1 death in the open-label transition phase of Study PSY3015 on PP1M (completed suicide); 3 deaths during 
the double-blind phase of Study PSY3015 (1 on PP6M [death by undetermined cause] and 2 on PP3M [sudden 
death, cause unknown; pulmonary embolism]). There were no deaths in PSY3016 as of the cutoff date. Each 
of the 4 deaths in the PP6M program (Studies PSY3015 and PSY3016) as of the clinical cutoff date for this 
submission was judged by the investigator to be not related to study drug.  
In Study PSY3011 from the PP3M clinical program, there were a total 6 deaths in subjects treated with 
paliperidone palmitate (PP3M or PP1M), including 2 deaths during the open-label phase on PP1M 
(arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease; sudden cardiac arrest); and 4 deaths during double-blind phase (1 
on PP3M [hepatocellular carcinoma] and 3 on PP1M [suicide attempt; acute bacterial meningitis; drug 
intoxication]). 
The types and rates of SAEs reported for subjects treated with PP6M in Study PSY3015 were consistent with 
the safety profile of PP3M and PP1M as observed in acute treatment studies as well as in long-term, 
randomized withdrawal studies. Furthermore, the majority of SAEs in Study PSY3015 were judged by the 
investigator as either not related or doubtfully related to study treatment. Most of the reported SAEs were in 
the psychiatric disorders SOC and were likely related to the natural changes in the course of the underlying 
disease. Treatment-emergent SAEs other than psychiatric disorders were reported in isolated cases in Study 
PSY3015. During the double-blind phase of Study PSY3015, treatment-emergent SAEs occurred in 5.0% of 
subjects in the PP6M group compared with 6.7% of those in the PP3M group. Other than psychiatric 
disorders, there were no SAEs of possible clinical interest reported after PP6M exposure in this study.  
Assessment report  
EMA/502561/2021 
Page 69/83 
 
 
As of the clinical cutoff date of 29 May 2020, one SAE of nephrotic syndrome was reported in 1 subject 
treated with PP6M in the ongoing Study PSY3016. The SAE was judged by the investigator to be not related 
to study drug; the subject recovered, and the event was considered to be resolved.  
In pooled safety data from the double-blind phases of PSY3015 and PSY3011, treatment-emergent SAEs 
occurred in 7.2% in the PP1M group of Study PSY3011; 5.6% in the pooled PP3M group [studies PSY3015 
and PSY3011] and 5.0% in the PP6M group of study PSY3015. Most of the reported SAEs were in the 
psychiatric disorders SOC. 
2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
In Study PSY3015, PP6M showed no clinically meaningful mean changes from double-blind baseline to end 
point on the results of chemistry and hematology laboratory tests for any of the laboratory analytes. Based 
on the occurrence of treatment-emergent markedly abnormal laboratory values and associated TEAEs, the 
effects of PP6M on the results laboratory tests did not show clinically meaningful differences from those of 
PP3M. 
Cases of potential clinical significance were identified based on individual plasma concentration time profiles 
according to the following criteria: high paliperidone plasma levels (n=35) and high paliperidone palmitate 
plasma levels (n=2). Subjects who had detectable levels of paliperidone palmitate (n=79). According to the 
Applicant, the changes in clinical status were minimal, and there was no clear association with the peak 
plasma concentrations.  
For serum prolactin, see above. 
A total of 20,402 paliperidone plasma concentrations from 811 subjects were used in the final popPK dataset 
for study PSY3015, of which 15,932 samples were from 700 subjects in the double-blind phase of which 68% 
were in the PP6M treatment arm and 32% in the PP3M treatment arm.

paliperidone palmitate at 350 or 525 mg eq. PP3M and 700 or 1000 mg eq. PP6M in the Double-Blind Phase. 
Vital signs 
Consistent with findings observed for PP1M and PP3M, treatment with PP6M in Study PSY3015 was associated 
with a significant increase in standing pulse rate in a small percentage of subjects. Two percent or fewer 
subjects in the PP6M group experienced a clinically notable increase or decrease in standing or supine systolic 
or diastolic blood pressure during the double-blind phase. 
Most of the AEs associated with vital sign abnormalities, including cases of orthostatic hypotension as an AE, 
were reported at incidences of 2% or less and were mild or moderate in intensity. Vital sign measurements 
were similar for the PP6M and PP3M groups during the double-blind phase. Orthostatic changes were 
observed in 1.3% of patients in the PP6M group and 0.5% of patients in the PP3M group.  
Abnormal increases in heart rate occurred in 7.7% of subjects in the PP6M group and 11.2% of subjects in 
the PP3M group during double-blind treatment. Abnormal decreases in heart rate occurred in 3.8% of 
subjects in the PP6M group and 1.8% of subjects in the PP3M group.  
The QTc interval data in Study PSY3015 were similar for the PP6M and PP3M treatment groups. In the PP6M 
group, 2 subjects and 1 subject (<1%) had increases in QTcF and QTcLD values >60 msec. In the PP3M 
group none of the subjects had increases in QTcF and QTcLD values >60 msec. In Study PSY3015, the 
incidence of treatment-emergent abnormal ECG parameters (PR, QRS, and QT intervals) was low (<2%) 
during the double-blind phase in the PP6M group. Administration of PP6M was not associated with clinically 
significant mean increases in QTc intervals during the double-blind phase. The mean change in QTcLD during 
the double-blind phase was similar for the PP6M and PP3M groups in Study PSY3015.  
Consistent with the approach taken for the PP1M MAA and the PP3M line extension, the Applicant did not 
conduct a separate thorough QT study with PP6M.

Critical Evaluation of Relevant Body Systems 
Overall, the types and rates of clinically significant AEs of special interest in subjects treated with PP6M were 
consistent with the safety profile of PP3M and PP1M. 
2.6.8.5.  Safety in special populations 
Although some subgroup associated differences in rates of TEAEs were observed, the results did not suggest 
that administration of PP6M was associated with a clinically relevant increased risk in any of the subgroups 
evaluated.  
Evaluation of TEAEs by dose regimen in the maintenance phase (PP1M or PP3M) indicated that the types 
(preferred terms) and incidences of TEAEs , as well as TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation, were 
similar for subjects who transitioned to PP6M from PP1M and for those who transitioned to PP6M from PP3M. 
Therefore, a transition from either PP1M or PP3M to PP6M would be acceptable if clinically indicated. 
In addition, the total rate of TEAEs in the double-blind phase was similar for the moderate (700 mg eq.) and 
high (1000 mg eq.) dose level subgroups within the PP6M treatment arm (moderate: 67.8%; high: 56.9%). 
2.6.8.6.  Immunological events 
See Sections on AEs. 
2.6.8.7.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
A total of 5 drug interaction studies were conducted as part of the clinical pharmacology programs for oral 
paliperidone ER and PP1M. These studies investigated the effects of paroxetine (potent CYP2D6 inhibitor), 
carbamazepine (potent inducer of CYP-enzymes and P-glycoprotein [P-gp]), trimethoprim (organic cation 
inhibitor) on the PK of oral paliperidone. Furthermore, the interactions between valproic acid and paliperidone 
ER were evaluated. All of these drug interactions were considered relevant to PP6M as well. It can be 
anticipated that less intestinal metabolic or transporter-mediated drug-drug interactions occur using 
paliperidone palmitate formulations as compared to paliperidone oral tablets. 
2.6.8.8.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Discontinuation due to TEAEs were reported at low rates during the double-blind phase in Study PSY3015 
(3.3% and 2.7% in the PP6M and PP3M groups). One event of possible clinical interest led to discontinuation 
in a PP6M-treated subject during the double-blind phase (Parkinsonism). This event was not considered 
serious and symptoms resolved after 127 days. Among subjects treated with PP6M in the double-blind phase, 
the rate of discontinuation due to TEAEs was similar in subjects treated with moderate (700 mg eq.; 3.0%) 
and high (100 mg eq.; 3.6%) doses of PP6M. The rate of discontinuation due to TEAEs was similar for 
subjects in the PP6M group who were transitioned from PP1M to PP6M (2.6%) and those who were 
transitioned from PP3M to PP6M (4.0%). 
As of the cutoff date of 29 May 2020, 1 subject receiving PP6M experienced TEAEs of intrusive thoughts, 
schizophrenia, and suicidal ideation leading to study drug discontinuation. 
In pooled safety data from the double-blind phases of PSY3015 and PSY3011, TEAEs leading to study 
discontinuation were reported at low rates across all treatment groups: 2.5% in the PP1M group of study 
PSY3011, 2.9% in the PP3M group of pooled studies PSY3011/3015, and 3.3% in the PP6M group of study 
PSY3015. In the pooled PP3M group, 1 event of possible clinical interest led to discontinuation in a PP3M-
treated subject during the double-blind phase of PSY3011 (tardive dyskinesia). This event was not considered 
Assessment report  
EMA/502561/2021 
Page 72/83 
 
 
serious and symptoms resolved by the 3-month follow-up after discontinuation of study medication. As 
described above 1 event of possible clinical interest led to discontinuation in a PP6M-treated subject during 
the double-blind phase of PSY3015 (Parkinsonism). 
According to the Applicant, this assessment indicated that the types (preferred terms) and incidences of 
TEAEs, as well as TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation, were similar for subjects who transitioned to 
PP6M from PP1M and for those who transitioned to PP6M from PP3M. Therefore, a transition from either PP1M 
or PP3M to PP6M would be safe if clinically indicated. 
Long-term Safety 
In the present Phase 3 study, PSY3015, the overall data confirm that the PP6M product (administered at 
doses of 700 and 1000 mg eq.) is safe in adults with schizophrenia treated for periods of up to 12 months. 
Data previously obtained during studies to evaluate the safety of PP3M and PP1M in patients with 
schizophrenia did not identify any safety concerns during long-term therapy with doses of PP3M as high as 
525 mg eq. or PP1M as high as 150 mg eq. Pending the assessment of the ongoing application, it might be 
possible to extrapolate to 48-month safety data in long term studies on PP1M and PP3M. 
2.6.8.9.  Post marketing experience 
This review of postmarketing cumulative data for paliperidone palmitate injectable products from product 
approvals through 30 June 2020 is consistent with the established safety profiles of PP1M and PP3M. No new 
significant safety issues or signals were identified. 
Literature 
The data presented in the publications selected from this period confirmed that the benefit-to-risk ratios for 
the use of paliperidone ER in the treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, PP1M in the 
treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, and PP3M in the treatment of schizophrenia, remain 
favourable. No new clinically significant safety issues were identified. 
In summary 
Overall, the data regarding the types and incidences of adverse events and ADRs, adverse events of clinical 
interest for the class of atypical antipsychotics, laboratory findings, vital sign measurements, and injection-
site reactions reported were generally similar for PP6M and PP3M in Study PSY3015, and in agreement with 
the findings from the PP3M and PP1M clinical development programs, and did not provide evidence for a new 
safety signal. The safety findings were similar for subjects who transitioned to PP6M from PP1M and for those 
who transitioned to PP6M from PP3M. Thus the use of PP6M at the proposed dose levels of 700 and 1000 mg 
eq. in the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia patients who have previously received PP1M preferably for 
four months or PP3M for at least one injection cycle, is supported by the findings presented in this safety 
summary. 
The review of postmarketing cumulative data for paliperidone palmitate injectable products from product 
approvals through 30 June 2020 is consistent with the established safety profiles of PP1M and PP3M. No new 
significant safety issues or signals were identified. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The extent of exposure in numbers of patients exposed to PP6M and duration of treatment is in general 
adequate and long-term data is sin general sufficient based on studies PSY3015 and PSY3016. In addition, 
the extensive exposure data for the PP3M, PP1M, and paliperidone ER products in earlier studies is in general 
supportive for PP6M, pending the current assessment adequacy for extrapolation.  
Assessment report  
EMA/502561/2021 
Page 73/83 
 
 
During the double-blind phase in study PSY3015, the overall rates of TEAEs as well as those of common 
individual TEAEs were balanced between the PP6M and PP3M groups. The only TEAEs reported more 
frequently in the PP6M group than in the PP3M group was injection site pain. Weight increased was the most 
frequently reported TEAE in both treatment groups. The types and rates of clinically significant AEs of special 
interest in subjects treated with PP6M were consistent with the safety profile of PP3M and PP1M. In both 
groups, most TEAEs were considered to be mild or moderate in intensity, with few individual TEAEs in the 
psychiatric disorders SOC reported as severe in more than 1 subject each.  
Although the injection with PP6M was well tolerated based on investigator assessments of the injection site 
and subjects’ visual analog scale ratings (intensity of perceived injection pain, and of pain in the area of the 
injection), some differences were noted. A tendency for increases in tenderness was observed by 
investigators in the PP6M group.  
The frequency for TEAEs of injection site reactions, including injection site pain, was higher in the PP6M group 
compared to the PP3M group. No clear relation to age or BMI was found, and the time relations of injection 
related TEAEs did not show a clearly different pattern with PP6M injections as compared to PP3M or placebo. 
Although a potential relation of higher TEAE frequencies to the higher injection volumes with PP6M (up to 5 
ml) is noted, the overall data suggest acceptable tolerability of PP6M at the injection site across the range of 
ages and BMI categories enrolled in study PSY3015. The administration recommendations are considered 
applicable to all subjects provided an appropriately longer time is advised for the injections of larger volumes. 
No new safety signal-based deaths were identified and the types and rates of SAEs reported for subjects 
treated with PP6M in Study PSY3015 were consistent with the safety profile of PP3M and PP1M. A similar, low 
percentage of subjects in the PP6M and PP3M groups discontinued the double-blind phase due to an AE(s). 
The incidence of diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia-related TEAEs was in general consistent with the low 
incidence of treatment-emergent markedly abnormal glucose levels in individual subjects. Treatment with 
PP6M also was not associated with any clinically significant increase in lipid abnormalities.  
The increase in body weight over a similar duration of treatment was smaller in the PP6M group compared to 
the PP3M group. The percentages of subjects who experienced a weight decrease were lower for the PP6M 
than the PP3M group. The percentage of subjects for whom TEAEs related to weight gain were reported was 
similar during the double-blind phase for the PP6M and PP3M groups in Study PSY3015. These results taken 
together, PP6M does not appear to be an issue regarding body weight. 
Vital sign measurements were similar for the PP6M and PP3M groups during the double-blind phase.  
PopPK modelling of PP6M demonstrated elevated median (±SD) plasma concentrations of paliperidone 
(between 100 and 300 ng/mL) directly after PP6M injection. Furthermore, the amount of active substance in 
the two strengths of PP6M is high (700 and 1000 mg paliperidone eq. respectively). Based on safety results, 
there are no indications of dose dumping, medication error or increased adverse events or other safety issues 
directly after PP6M injections.  
Missed doses and dosing window of 2 weeks before up to 3 weeks after scheduled dose. Safety aspects and 
data. The highest PP6M dose strength (1000 mg eq.) was used to simulate the worst case scenario where 
shortening the dosing interval results in the highest Cmax for injections administered 1 week earlier and 2 
weeks earlier relative to the scheduled 6-month injection after reaching PP6M steady state on 1000 mg eq., 
the median Cmax increased from 76.1 ng/mL to 76.3 (+0.3%) and to 76.6 (+0.7%), respectively. According 
to the Clinical Study Protocol for PSY3015, the time window was ±3 or ±7 days for dosing, and according to 
the Clinical Study Report no protocol deviations regarding time window was detected.  
High prolactin levels relative to the maintenance phase baseline were noted in a similar percentage of 
subjects in the PP6M and PP3M groups in both males (approximately 35%) and females (approximately 
30%). Overall patterns of prolactin level variations and of Prolactin-related Adverse Events in PSY3015 are in 
line with data from the previous study PSY3011 comparing PP3M to PP1M.  
Assessment report  
EMA/502561/2021 
Page 74/83 
 
 
In additional simulations provided by the Applicant, paliperidone is estimated to remain in plasma up to 
medians of 38-42 months (depending on dose level) after a single dose of PP6M.  SmPC section 4.6 (Women 
of child-bearing potential, Pregnancy and Breast-feeding) and 5.2 (Pharmacokinetic properties) were updated 
accordingly with also the agreement for the wording in section 4.6 that "BYANNLI should only be used in 
women planning to become pregnant if clearly necessary". 
The last review of postmarketing cumulative data for paliperidone palmitate injectable products from product 
approvals through 30 June 2020 is consistent with the established safety profiles of PP1M and PP3M. No new 
significant safety issues or signals were identified 
The issues previously considered by the PRAC Rapp to be included in the RMP have been resolved.  
In the SmPC, information on section 4.6 on Pregnancy and Breast-feeding has been agreed.    
The RMP has been updated throughout to add "BYANNLI" (PP6M). 
The remaining key findings to be part of the benefit-risk assessment are results on injection site reactions. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have been 
included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
 Safety of PP6M is similar to PP3M and in line with the known safety profile of paliperidone and no new safety 
issues were identified. PP6M differ to PP3M in dose, strength, volume, and duration of treatment. 
• 
The TEAE reported more frequently in the PP6M group than in the PP3M group (at least 3% difference 
between groups) was injection site reactions, including injection site pain.  
•  Weight increased was the most frequently reported TEAE in both treatment groups. In both groups, 
most TEAEs were considered to be mild or moderate in intensity, with few individual TEAEs in the 
psychiatric disorders SOC reported as severe in more than 1 subject each. 
• 
Prolactin levels varied during Study PSY3015 for both PP6M and PP3M in line with data from the 
previous PSY3011 study of PP1M and PP3M.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance   
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Schizophrenia is a chronic and debilitating mental disorder with a heterogeneous combination of symptoms. 
Symptoms of schizophrenia can be divided into “positive” (behaviors and thoughts that are not normally 
present, such as delusions and hallucinations), “negative” (social withdrawal, flat affect, anhedonia), and 
“cognitive” (a broad set of cognitive dysfunctions) categories.  
Schizophrenia follows a fluctuating course marked by acute exacerbation of psychotic crises superimposed 
upon a background of poorly controlled negative, neurocognitive, and social cognitive symptoms, with 
adverse environmental events triggering crises. 
The proposed indication for Byannli is; 
BYANNLI, a 6-monthly injection, is indicated for the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adult patients 
who are clinically stable on 1-monthly or 3-monthly paliperidone palmitate injectable products (see 
section 5.1). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Antipsychotic medication is essential in schizophrenia treatment. Atypical, or second generation (SGA), 
antipsychotics such as risperidone, paliperidone, aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, and 
ziprasidone are usually preferred over first-generation antipsychotics (eg, chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, 
haloperidol, and perphenazine) because of their lower risk of neurological side effects.  
Oral atypical antipsychotics are usually used as first-line treatment options, with the exception of clozapine, 
which is reserved for treatment resistant disease.  
However, nonadherence to oral antipsychotic drugs among patients with schizophrenia is common, with the 
frequency estimated to be about 50%. Nonadherence has a negative impact on the course of schizophrenia 
and leads to relapse, rehospitalization, and attempted suicide. 
Without antipsychotic treatment, schizophrenia can result in severe problems that affect functioning in 
everyday life, such as the inability to work or attend school, other health and medical problems, and being 
victimized. 
Assessment report  
EMA/502561/2021 
Page 77/83 
 
 
 
 
 
Several atypical antipsychotics are available as LAI formulations (eg, risperidone, PP1M, PP3M, and 
aripiprazole), with potential benefits in patients nonadherent to oral therapy. The use of LAI antipsychotics 
has been increasing gradually over the last decade. LAI antipsychotics containing paliperidone palmitate are 
approved with a maximum interval between injections of 3 months (PP3M). 
The PP6M is intended for the treatment of schizophrenia only in adults who have been adequately treated 
with PP1M preferably for four months or more, or with PP3M for at least one injection cycle. PP6M is not 
intended for treatment without prior exposure to PP1M or PP3M.  
The claimed 6-months indication is intended for patients who remained stable on LAI treatment with a 
shorter injection interval, in case a substantially longer dosing interval is preferred. According to the 
Applicant this might offer benefits also to those with limited access to healthcare, such as geographic or 
economic problems with clinic visits, or else limited access to treatment due to problems associated with e g 
homelessness. 
 The PP6M formulation has a higher injection volume than PP3M and PP1M and should only be dosed in the 
gluteal muscle. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main clinical study PSY3015 was a well-designed international randomized, double-blind, active-
controlled, multicenter, interventional, parallel-group study with the aim to demonstrate that the effect of 
PP6M is non-inferior to PP3M in adults with schizophrenia, previously treated with PP1M for at least 4 months 
or PP3M for at least one 3-month injection cycle.  In addition, the pharmacokinetic properties of PP6M were 
measured from semi-intensive PK sampling. 
The study design and the numbers completing/entering the study are considered adequate to reach this 
conclusion; 416/478 (87.0%) in the PP6M arm and 202/224 (90.2%) in the PP3M arm. Consistent with 
previous scientific advice from CHMP, more than 25% of subjects were enrolled and treated at sites in the EU 
during the double-blind phase (n=193, 28%). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The efficacy of PP6M was based on the demonstration of non-inferiority versus PP3M, for the documented 
difference of relapse rate in Kaplan-Meier estimate -2,9% (95% CI -6.8 , 1.1) in ITT analysis (10% pre-
defined lower margin of CI). The results were consistent in the pre-defined subgroups age, sex, BMI, region, 
dose and race. 
Efficacy of PP3M previously has been based on non-inferiority versus PP1M, which was assessed in study 
PSY3011. Thus, the favourable effects of paliperidone are well known from PP1M and PP3M. The 
pharmacokinetics of PP6M has been well characterized. The total plasma exposure after PP6M was roughly 
similar to corresponding doses of PP3M. A number of simulations have been performed addressing different 
dosing scenarios to support the dosing recommendations in the SmPC.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Some additional clarifications from a pharmacokinetic perspective were performed as requested with respect 
to switching between formulations, dosing windows and re-initiation of PP6M. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The unfavourable effects of paliperidone are known from PP1M and PP3M.  
There is no indication of any new safety signal with PP6M. During the double-blind phase, a higher 
percentage of subjects in the PP6M group reported injection site-related TEAEs (12.3%) compared to the 
PP3M group (4.9%). TEAEs of injection site pain were the most frequently reported local reactions in both 
treatment groups (PP6M: 7.7% and PP3M: 4.0%). No injection site reaction TEAE was reported as severe, 
and most were mild.  
Further safety assessment is pending data from the ongoing study OLE PSY3016. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Some additional information has been added concerning the more frequent injection site reactions for PP6M, 
the potential risk of dose dumping, and the longstanding serum concentrations with regard to pregnancy and 
breast-feeding. 
Though the amount of active substance in PP6M is high, the potential risk of dose dumping is considered to 
be low, primarily due the extremely low water solubility of the prodrug paliperidone palmitate. Overall, the 
physico-chemical and biological properties indicate that PP6M is a predictable and robust formulation with a 
very low potential for unexpected drug release after intramuscular administration.  
The estimated long-standing serum concentrations up to 4 years after a single PP6M dose require clinical 
consideration about pregnancy and breast-feeding, this was discussed with the company and clarified in the 
SmPC 4.6 and 5.2 as well as in the Package leaflet.  
The Applicant has provided simulation data on the 5th and 95th percentiles of Cmax and Ctrough at the different 
dosing-windows, i.e. PP6M administration 1 and 2 weeks earlier, and later than the scheduled 6-month time 
point, up to a delay of 11 months. The simulation data per se provide no support for the recommended extra 
dosing of PP1M after a missed dose of PP6M, even up to a delay of 11 months. The Applicant has provided 
additional information in support of the recommendation for extra dosing of PP1M after a missed dose, e.g. a 
clinical need to evaluate the stability of treatment in such cases should be considered. 
Based on the plasma concentration curves and Pop PK simulations, there might be a potentially increased risk 
for ADRs the period directly after injection of PP6M and a potential risk for insufficient effect or relapse during 
the end of the dosing interval. From PSY3015 there are no clear clinical indications of such unfavourable 
effects, neither from limited preliminary data from PSY3016 (ongoing).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
This application concerns a new formulation of paliperidone palmitate allowing dosing every 6th month for the 
treatment of patients with schizophrenia. Previously, long acting products with 1- and 3-months dosing 
intervals are approved. The PP6M is intended for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults who have been 
adequately treated with PP1M preferably for four months or more, or with PP3M for at least one injection 
cycle. PP6M is not intended for treatment without prior exposure to PP1M or PP3M.  
The claimed 6-months indication is intended for patients who remained stable on LAI treatment with a 
shorter injection interval, in case a substantially longer dosing interval is preferred. According to the 
Applicant this might offer benefits also to those with limited access to healthcare, such as geographic or 
economic problems with clinic visits, or else limited access to treatment due to problems associated with e g 
homelessness. This is acknowledged, but it should also be considered that the longer dosing interval may 
lead to less frequent contacts with health care providers. However, it is assumed that the prescriber can 
judge which patients the PP6M would be suitable. 
The non-inferiority finding for PP6M supports a clinical benefit similar to the PP3M and PP1M. 
Efficacy data are considered clinically significant and robust based on the primary endpoint analysis in study 
PSY3015 and consistent subgroup analyses.

The PP6M formulation has a higher injection volume than PP3M and PP1M and should only be dosed in the 
gluteal muscle.  
As the higher volume is most likely the explanation to the higher incidence of injections site reactions 
compared to PP3M, a minor clarification concerning advisable injection speed is requested. In addition, 
concerning estimated serum concentrations up to 4 years after a single PP6M dose, further clarification were 
provided concerning pregnancy and breast-feeding. Section 4.6 and 5.2 and the package leaflet were 
updated satisfactorily accordingly with notably agreed wording in section 4.6 that "BYANNLI should only be 
used in women planning to become pregnant if clearly necessary. 
The data regarding adverse events and ADRs, adverse events of clinical interest for the class of atypical 
antipsychotics, laboratory findings and vital sign measurements reported were generally similar for PP6M and 
PP3M in Study PSY3015. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Considering that the effect of the PP6M is noninferior to the PP3M and that no new serious adverse events 
have been documented, the benefits are considered to outweigh the risks.   
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of BYANNLI is positive.   
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality and safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of, BYANNLI Prolonged-release suspension for injection, 700 mg, 1000 mg is 
favourable in the following indication: 
BYANNLI, a 6-monthly injection, is indicated for the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adult patients 
who are clinically stable on 1-monthly or 3-monthly paliperidone palmitate injectable products.

COMP opinion (adoption via written 
16 December 2022 
procedure) 
2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product designation in 2013 was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing fenfluramine 
hydrochloride was considered justified based on preliminary clinical observations in treated 
patients who responded with reduced number of epileptic seizures; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to epileptic seizures, psychomotor delay and 
behavioural symptoms such as hyperactivity, aggressiveness and autistic tendencies; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 2 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made; 
Thus, the requirements under Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products are fulfilled. 
In addition, although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union, the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal 
product containing fenfluramine hydrochloride will be of significant benefit to those affected by the 
condition. The sponsor has provided preliminary clinical observations in patients resistant to previous 
treatments, who responded with reduced numbers of seizures after addition of fenfluramine to their 
therapeutic regimen. The Committee considered that this constitutes a clinically relevant advantage. 
Thus, the requirement under Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products is fulfilled. 
The COMP concludes that the requirements laid down in Article (3)(1) (a) and (b) of Regulation (EC) 
No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products are fulfilled. The COMP therefore recommends the 
designation of this medicinal product, containing fenfluramine hydrochloride as an orphan medicinal 
product for the orphan indication: treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
type II variation 
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a rare epilepsy disorder characterised by the presence of multiple 
seizure types, slow (≤2.5 Hz) spike-waves EEG abnormalities with frequent abnormal background 
activity when awake and a particular EEG pattern of fast rhythms (10–20 Hz) during sleep. The seizure 
types vary among patients: the most invalidating are sudden drop attacks (myoclonic, atonic or 
myoclono-atonic) but can also include focal, tonic, tonic-clonic, atonic, atypical absence, and myoclonic 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report

Page 4/15 
 
 
 
 
 
seizures. In the past, LGS was subdivided into cryptogenic and symptomatic types by the presence or 
absence of an underlying cause. The new classification (Scheffer et al, 2017) has introduced many 
other aetiological categories and this distinction is no more valid. The aetiology of LGS is extensive and 
diverse, varying from congenital to acquired causes. Among these, frequent causes include 
malformations of cortical development, tuberous sclerosis, hereditary metabolic diseases, sequelae of 
hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy and of other perinatal injuries, lesions secondary to inflammatory 
brain diseases such as encephalitis, meningitis and congenital infections as toxoplasmosis and 
cytomegalovirus. About one-third of LGS cases occur without antecedent history or evidence of brain 
pathology and these patients tend to have a better prognosis than those with brain lesions. The 
sponsor acknowledged the release of a revised classification of seizure and epilepsy types in March 
2017, which did not alter the classification of epilepsy syndromes (Scheffer et al, 2017).  
The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) Task Force most recently classified the disorder as an 
epileptic encephalopathy. In the ILAE developed diagnostic criteria, LGS is characterized by the 
presence of (1) multiple types of drug-resistant seizures with onset prior to 18 years (one of which 
must include tonic); (2) cognitive and often behavioural impairments, which may not be present at 
seizure onset; and (3) diffuse slow spike-and-wave and generalized paroxysmal fast activity on EEG 
(Specchio et al.,Epilepsia. 2022 Jun;63(6):1398-1442). 
Altogether, Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) remains a recognised electroclinical epilepsy syndrome. 
The approved therapeutic indication “Fintepla is indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with 
Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome as an add-on therapy to other anti-epileptic 
medicines for patients 2 years of age and older.” falls within the scope of the designated orphan 
condition “Treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP, see 
EPAR. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
LGS is a severe epilepsy syndrome with onset in childhood characterised by drug-resistant seizures 
and other symptoms such as impaired intellectual functioning or information processing, along with 
developmental delays (20-60% of patients) and behavioural disturbances being very common and 
often profound. In LGS seizures tend to persist on a daily or weekly basis in over two-thirds of the 
patients, with generalised tonic seizures being most resistant to therapy the mortality rate associated 
with LGS ranges from 3% to 7% within 10 years of the diagnosis, due to poorly controlled seizures and 
injuries from falls (Crumrine, J Child Neurol. 2002, 70-75, Cherian 2020.).  For patients with refractory 
epilepsy, such as LGS, the lifetime risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP)exists.  The 
condition is therefore both chronically debilitating and life-threatening. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor provides an overview of the publications which were used for prevalence estimates at the 
time of the submission of the original orphan designation in 2016 and highlights two new articles which 
have appeared since:  
•  Chin et al. (2021) reported a minimum total prevalence of 0.58 per 10,000 people in the UK in 
2017, although it was noted by the authors that this was lower than reported elsewhere and may 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000075867 
Page 5/15 
 
 
 
 
 
be an underestimate. To be noted, UK data is supportive but less relevant since the UK is no longer 
part of the EU.  
•  A retrospective study reported by Strzelczyk (2020), utilised healthcare insurance claims data from 
2007-2016 to assess the prevalence of LGS in Germany, estimated a point prevalence between 
0.65 -3.92 per 10,000. Notably, the database did not include the diagnosis LGS by physicians, but 
it was post-hoc designation, based on certain criteria. The estimate of 0.65 was based on a narrow 
definition (≥1 ICD-10 diagnosis of epilepsy / status epilepticus before their 6th birthday and ≥ 1 
claim of Rufinamide /felbamate, medications that are specifically used for LGS), and the high 
estimate was based on a broad definition (without any age restriction for the first seizure). As the 
median age of diagnosis of LGS is 3 years, this is likely an overestimate.

Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) accounts for approximately 2-5% of all childhood epilepsies, but it is 
responsible for roughly 10% of epilepsy cases occurring before the age of five years. The incidence of 
LGS is estimated at 0.1 to 0.28 per 100,000 population. There are no reports of a founder effect. 
(Lennox Gastaut Syndrome Chaitanya Amrutkar; Rosario M. Riel-Romero. Lennox Gastaut Syndrome - 
StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf (nih.gov)) 
The sponsor notes that Strzelczyk (2020) reported a mortality rate of 2.88% in Germany, which is 
comparable with other published data for patients with LGS, which report mortality between 3% and 
7% (van Rijckevorsel 2008, Cherian 2020).  
Cherian (2020) reported a mortality rate of 3% after a follow-up period of 8.5 years to 7% after a 
mean follow-up period of 9.7 years. This indicates a survival rate at 9.7 years of 93%. Therefore, the 
median survival of patients with LGS is in excess of 9.7 years and it is appropriate to use point 
prevalence to estimate the number of people affected.  
In conclusion, based on the totality of the prevalence data described above, the point prevalence of 
LGS in the EU is still likely to be no higher than 2 people per 10,000 total population, based on the 
latest published population of the EU (EU27, Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein)

resort for patients who are refractory to all other LGS AEDs due to the risk of serious side effects, 
shows that Fintepla also offers an effective treatment option, with a unique mechanism of action, for 
patients that have exhausted all other lines of therapy ..

There are currently no agreed pan-EU treatment guidelines for LGS, instead most guidelines are 
country-specific (Chin 2021). In 2017, prior to the EU approval of Epidyolex, the lack of guidance on 
the management of LGS motivated a panel of 5 leading European epileptologists to propose an 
algorithm for the treatment of newly diagnosed patients with LGS (Cross, 2017) (Figure 1). 
Consistent with country-specific guidelines (Chin 2021), the algorithm recommends first line treatment 
with VPA (valproid acid), with LTG (lamotrigine) added as the first adjunctive therapy for a newly 
diagnosed de novo LGS patient.  If VPA plus LTG does not provide adequate seizure control, RUF 
(Rufinamide) should be added as adjunctive therapy. When adding a new adjunctive therapy, the 
algorithm recommends attempting to discontinue one of the two previous ASMs, since there is no 
evidence for the effectiveness of more than two ASMs in combination, and the use of multiple ASMs 
unnecessarily raises the risk of side effects and/or drug-drug interactions (DDIs). If the addition of RUF 
does not achieve adequate seizure control, the choice of the next adjunctive therapy should be 
discussed with the patient’s support team but may typically include TPM (Topiramate), CLB 
(Clobazam)or FLB (Felbamate). Non
pharmacological treatment approaches (e.g., ketogenic diet, 
resective surgery, vagus nerve stimulation, callosotomy) may also be considered alongside the use of 
ASMs (Cross, 2017).

Over time, this algorithm has evolved from the initial hypothesis and in 2021 two European experts 
proposed a revised treatment algorithm with the approval of Epidyolex (Cannabidiol, CBD) (used in

conjunction with CLB) added in as a subsequent adjunctive therapy, and CLB not just being used for 
intermittent short-term use but having an important role as a first-line adjunctive therapy option. FLB 
is generally recommended as a last-line resort for patients with highly refractory epilepsy due to the 
risk of serious side effects (Strzelczyk 2021). This latest algorithm is consistent with the latest 
Orphanet summary on LGS, published in April 2021, and reviewed by 3 European experts from 
EpiCARE reference centres (Orphanet, 2021) which recommends valproic acid as a first line treatment 
and confirms that the use of FLB is limited by adverse side effects. 
The Sponsor considered the following products as satisfactory, which should be taken into account for 
the significant benefit assessment:  
• 
authorised treatments with the LGS indication: LTG (lamotrigine), RUF (rufinamide), TPM 
(topiramate), CBD (cannabidiol), FLB (felbamate) 
•  not-specifically indicated products such as clobazam (CLB), and valproic acid (VPA) 
Clonazepam and nitrazepam were not considered satisfactory by the Sponsor, although they are 
authorised and indicated for the treatment of LGS in a few EU Member States via national procedures. 
This is because the level of evidence is limited to empiric experience or small, uncontrolled trials. 
These products should be avoided for prolonged therapy because of tolerance, somnolence, and risk of 
withdrawal seizures (van Rijckevorsel 2008).  
Some other AEDs, including levetiracetam (LEV), zonisamide (ZNS) and perampanel (PER), not 
approved for use in LGS, may be useful in treating multiple seizure types due to their broad
spectrum 
efficacy profile. However, there is a paucity of evidence regarding use of LEV, ZNS and PER in LGS and 
robust evidence from randomised, controlled trials (RCTs) in LGS is lacking (Cross 2017, Strzelczyk 
‑
2021, Montouris 2020). Similarly, lacosamide and brivaracetam are considered potentially valuable in 
the treatment of LGS but lack systematic trial data to support efficacy (Mastrangelo 2017, Montouris 
2020). Carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, eslicarbazepine, tigabine, phenytoin, vigabatrin, pregabalin and 
gabapentin are infrequently used, with some of them having negative recommendations for the 
treatment of LGS (Chin 2021b), and there may be potential for aggravating certain seizure types with 
these AEDs (Asadi-Pooya, 2018, Cross 2017, Strzelczyk 2021, Montouris 2020). 
The COMP considered that felbamate is not a satisfactory method, as its use is restricted to last line 
treatment, given its high risk (agranulocytosis and fatal liver injury) and Fintepla can be used in a 
broader population.   
Neither is Epydiolex considered a satisfactory method for the entirety of the target population, as this 
must be used in combination with clobazam according to the wording of the indication, while Fintepla 
can be used in a broader target population. Not all patients tolerate clobazam.  
It is agreed with the Sponsor that VPA, RUF, LTG, TPM and CLB are satisfactory methods, that need to 
taken into account of the assessment of Significant Benefit.  
Significant benefit 
The sponsor claimed that Fintepla can offer a clinically relevant advantage through an improved 
reduction in seizure frequency (Drop in seizure Frequency=DSF) in patients who are inadequately 
controlled on other approved LGS treatments. This is based on data from the pivotal randomised    
Phase III study ZX008-1601.

The Fintepla LGS clinical development program includes the following Phase 3 studies conducted in 
children and adults (2 to 35 years) with LGS:  
•  Study ZX008-1601, which is comprised of 2 parts analysed separately: 
−  Study ZX008
1601 Part 1, Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, efficacy and 
safety evaluation in subjects with LGS. This arm was 12 weeks duration and included two dose 
levels of fenfluramine.

−  Study ZX008
from Part 1 
‑
1601 Part 2, a Phase 3, open-label, long-term extension in subjects with LGS 
•  Study ZX008
1900, which is a Phase 3, open-label, long-term extension study in subjects with 
epileptic encephalopathies, including LGS and Dravet syndrome. 
‑
Figure 2.  1601 Study Schema 
Subjects with LGS in this development program were highly treatment-refractory, with seizures that 
were difficult to control. The enrolled subjects had failed a median of 7 anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) 
(range: 1 to 20) and were stabilized on standard of care AEDs at the time of enrolment (see Table 15 
and 4 below for details). The vast majority used 2-4 ASMs as background therapy during the trial 
(95.4%). However, most were still experiencing high seizure burden during Baseline, ranging from a 
median of 53 to 85 drop seizures per 28 days across the treatment groups despite being treated with 
other ASMs and antiepileptic therapies.   
The change from Baseline in the frequency of seizures leading to drops (i.e, drop seizure frequency per 
28 days [DSF]) after the 12-week maintenance treatment for fenfluramine hydrochloride 0.8 
mg/kg/day compared with placebo was the primary efficacy endpoint for Study 1601 Part 1.  
The change from Baseline in the frequency of seizures leading to drops (i.e, drop seizure frequency per 
28 days [DSF])  
The most common concomitant medications and therapies (≥15% of subjects overall) included the 
following: VNS (82 subjects [31.2%]). Note that no subjects received concomitant STP. 
The patients included in the pivotal trial had failed a median of 7 prior lines of therapy which include 
four of the five currently authorised in Europe namely: rufinamide, lamotrigine, topiramate, and 
felbamate. There is data at the time of recruitment to the study indicating that 27% patients had 
already been treated with cannabidiol and failed the treatment. These discontinuations as well those 
for other AEDs used are summarised in Table 6. Table 7 presents the concomitant AEDs used during 
the trial.

Table 7.  Concomitant Antiepileptic treatments 
It appears that most patients were on three AEDs with valproate+clobazam being used in combination 
with either lamotrigine, rufinamide or topiramate or felbamate. Although clobazam is not specifically 
indicated for the condition it is used in a large proportion of patients (81 patients) in combination with 
fenfluramine.  
Fenfluramine is used in combination with lamotrigine as concomitant treatment in the trial (59 
patients), followed by rufinamide (35 patients), felbamate (27 patients) and topiramate (24 patients). 
This would reflect a use of concomitant treatment in line with the recommendations made in the 
treatment algorithm (Cross 2017) where valproate is used first line in 98 patients. From the 
recommendations the sponsor cites that Cannabidiol is to be used in third line with clobazam.  
In this highly treatment-refractory patient population, a statistically significant, clinically meaningful, 
and durable reduction in DSF compared with placebo was demonstrated when fenfluramine 
hydrochloride 0.8 mg/kg/day (Fintepla 0.7 mg/kg/day) was added to a subject’s stable antiepileptic 
treatments (p = 0.0013).  For the 0.8 mg/kg/day dose, the percentage change from baseline of DSF

was 26.5%, and the number of DSF from baseline as compared to placebo was 19 (95% Confidence 
Interval 
31.02, 
8.74).

This was also supported by key secondary endpoints of 50% responder rates of DSF and Percentage of 
Subjects with Improvement on the CGI-I (Clinical Global Impression by Investigator) Rating Scale.  
Fintepla was also effective in reducing generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCs), with a reduction of 46- 
58% from Baseline in the fenfluramine treatment groups. This type of seizures is associated with 
SUDEP (sudden unexpected death in epilepsy).  The treatment effects observed in Part 1 of the study 
were maintained in the open-label extension period of 12 months. 
Post-hoc subgroup analyses of patients' refractory/intolerant to prior treatment with either CBD 
(n=27), FLB (n=30), LTG (n=68), RUF (n=61), TPM (n=68) and VPA (n=91) and CLB (n=80) all 
showed a statistically significant improvement versus placebo regarding seizure reduction (see figure 4 
below). The clinical relevance of these findings was also supported by changes in CGI-I in these 
subgroups. 
The sponsor envisioned that fenfluramine will be used as a later-line adjunctive therapy,, similarly to 
cannabidiol. The data from Study ZX008-1601 would indicate that the target patient population is 
indeed a late line.  
In conclusion, Fintepla has shown a treatment effect as add-on therapy in patients who were 
extensively pre-treated and refractory/intolerant to multiple antiseizure medications.

4.  COMP position adopted on 16 December 2022 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was 
estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be 2 in 10,000 persons in the 
European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to early-onset epileptic seizures, including tonic 
seizures, psychomotor delay and behavioural symptoms such as hyperactivity, aggressiveness and 
autistic behaviour; 
although satisfactory methods for the treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union for all the patients covered by Fintepla, the assumption that Fintepla may be of 
potential significant benefit to those affected by the orphan condition as defined in the granted 
therapeutic indication still holds. Clinical data has been submitted showing that Fintepla showed a 
treatment effect as add-on therapy in patients who were extensively pre-treated and 
refractory/intolerant to multiple antiseizure medications. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Fintepla, fenfluramine 
hydrochloride for treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (EU/3/17/1836) is not removed from the 
Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

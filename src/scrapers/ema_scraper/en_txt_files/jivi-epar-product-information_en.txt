CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in previously treated patients ≥ 12 years of age with 
haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia. 
Treatment monitoring 
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII levels is advised to confirm 
that adequate FVIII levels have been achieved. Individual patients may vary in their response to 
factor VIII, demonstrating different half-lives and recoveries. Dose based on bodyweight may require 
adjustment in overweight patients. In the case of major surgical interventions in particular, precise 
monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis (plasma factor VIII activity) is 
indispensable. 
When using an in vitro activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based one stage clotting assay for 
determining factor VIII activity in patients’ blood samples, plasma factor VIII activity results can be 
significantly affected by both the type of aPTT reagent and the reference standard used in the assay, 
which can result in over- or under-estimation of factor VIII activity. It should be noted that there can 
be significant discrepancies between assay results obtained by specific reagents used in the aPTT-
based one stage clotting assay and the chromogenic assay. This is of importance when monitoring the 
factor VIII activity of Jivi, and when changing laboratory and/or reagents used in the assay. This 
applies also for modified long-acting factor VIII products. 
Laboratories intending to measure Jivi activity should check their procedures for accuracy. A field 
study has indicated that the factor VIII activity of Jivi can be accurately measured in plasma using 
either a validated chromogenic substrate (CS) assay or a one-stage (OS) clotting assay using specific 
reagents. For Jivi some silica-based one-stage assays (e.g., APTT-SP, STA-PTT) may underestimate 
the factor VIII activity of Jivi in plasma samples; some reagents, e.g. with kaolin-based activators, 
have the potential for overestimation. 
The clinical effect of factor VIII is the most important element in evaluating the effectiveness of 
treatment. It may be necessary to adjust the individual dosing at patient level in order to attain 
satisfactory clinical results. If the calculated dose fails to attain the expected factor VIII levels or if 
bleeding is not controlled after administration of the calculated dose, the presence of a circulating 
factor VIII-inhibitor or anti-PEG antibodies in the patient should be suspected (see section 4.4). 
Posology 
The dose and duration of substitution therapy depends on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, the 
location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient's clinical condition. 
The number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are 
related to the current WHO concentrate standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity in 
plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or preferably in IU 
(relative to an International Standard for factor VIII in plasma). 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
One IU of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one mL of normal human 
plasma. 
On demand treatment 
The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU 
factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 1.5-2.5 % of normal activity. 
The required dose of Jivi is determined using the following formula: 
Required units = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (% or IU/dL) x reciprocal of observed 
recovery (i.e. 0.5 for recovery of 2.0%). 
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the 
clinical effectiveness required in the individual case. 
In the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the 
given plasma activity level (in % of normal) in the corresponding period. The following table can be 
used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:

For prophylaxis the dose is 45-60 IU/kg every 5 days. Based on patient clinical characteristics the dose 
can also be 60 IU/kg every 7 days or 30-40 IU/kg two times per week (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). 
For overweight patients, the maximum dose per injection for prophylaxis should not be higher than 
approximately 6 000 IU. 
Special populations 
Paediatric population 
Jivi is not indicated in previously untreated patients and in patients less than 12 years of age. 
Adolescent population 
On demand and prophylactic treatment dosing in adolescent patients is the same as for adult patients. 
Elderly 
There is limited experience in patients ≥ 65 years. 
Method of administration 
Jivi is for intravenous use. 
Jivi should be injected intravenously over a period of 2 to 5 minutes depending on the total volume. 
The rate of administration should be determined by the patient’s comfort level (maximal rate of 
injection: 2.5 mL/min). 
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6 and 
the package leaflet. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Known allergic reactions to mouse or hamster proteins. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Hypersensitivity 
Allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible with Jivi. The medicinal product may contain 
traces of mouse and hamster proteins. Hypersensitivity reactions could also be related to antibodies 
against PEG (see paragraph Immune response to polyethylene glycol (PEG)). If symptoms of 
hypersensitivity occur, patients should be advised to discontinue the use of the medicinal product 
immediately and contact their physician. Patients should be informed of the early signs of 
hypersensitivity reactions including hives, generalized urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, 
hypotension, and anaphylaxis. Symptomatic treatment for hypersensitivity should be instituted as 
appropriate. In case of anaphylaxis or shock, the current medical standards for treatment should be 
implemented.

Inhibitors 
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the 
management of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins 
directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) 
per mL of plasma using the modified Bethesda assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to 
the severity of the disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 
50 exposure days (ED) but continues throughout life although the risk is uncommon. Rarely, inhibitors 
may develop after the first 50 exposure days. 
The clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre 
posing less of a risk of insufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors. 
In general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for 
the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. 
If the expected factor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with 
an appropriate dose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with 
high levels of inhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should 
be considered. Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the 
care of haemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors. 
Immune response to polyethylene glycol (PEG) 
A clinical immune response associated with anti-PEG antibodies, manifested as symptoms of acute 
hypersensitivity and/or loss of drug effect has been observed primarily within the first 4 exposure 
days. Low post-injection factor VIII levels in the absence of detectable factor VIII inhibitors indicate 
that loss of drug effect is likely due to anti-PEG antibodies; in such cases Jivi should be discontinued 
and patients switched to a previously effective factor VIII product. 
A significant decrease in the risk of an immune response to PEG was observed with an increase in age. 
This effect may be related to a developmental change in immunity, and although it is difficult to define 
a clear cut-off age for the change in risk, this phenomenon predominantly occurs in young children 
with haemophilia. 
The implications of any potential risk to affected patients with a hypersensitivity reaction to pegylated 
proteins are unknown. Data show that in the affected subjects, following discontinuation of Jivi, the 
anti-PEG IgM antibodies decreased in titre and became undetectable over time. No cross-reactivity of 
anti-PEG IgM antibodies with other unmodified factor VIII products was observed. All patients could 
be successfully treated with their previous factor VIII products. 
Cardiovascular events 
In patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, substitution therapy with factor VIII may increase 
the cardiovascular risk. 
Catheter-related complications 
If a central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including 
local infections, bacteraemia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. 
Paediatric population 
The listed warnings and precautions apply both to adults and adolescents. 
Jivi is not indicated in patients < 12 years of age and in previously untreated patients.

Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Interactions of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA) products with other medicinal products have 
not been reported. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII. Based on the rare occurrence 
of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast-
feeding is not available. Therefore, factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and breast-feeding 
only if clearly indicated. 
Fertility 
In the repeat dose systemic toxicity studies in rats and rabbits with Jivi, treatment related effects on 
male reproductive organs were not seen (see section 5.3). The effect on fertility in humans is 
unknown. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Jivi has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the 
injection site, chills, flushing, generalized urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, 
restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed and 
may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock). 
Development of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated 
with factor VIII, including with Jivi (see section 5.1). If such inhibitors occur, the condition will 
manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialized 
haemophilia centre be contacted. 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions in clinical studies in PTPs were headache, cough and 
pyrexia. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
A total of 221 patients constituted the safety population from three pivotal Phase I and III studies 
[PROTECT VIII], 148 adolescents/adults and 73 paediatric patients < 12 years. In PROTECT VIII, 
121 patients continued in the extension study with a median total treatment duration of 3.9 years 
[range: 0.8-7.0].

In the paediatric study, 59/73 patients < 12 years continued in the extension study. Median (range) 
total time in study (main study + extension) was 5.8 (1.0-6.6) years with a median of 430 (range 98-
671) ED per subject, 39 subjects were treated for =/> 5 years. 
The median number of exposure days to Jivi per subject was 237 (min-max: 1-698) for all subjects in 
the clinical studies. 
Overall, in both studies 75 patients were observed for a treatment duration of more than 5 years. 
The table presented below is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC and 
Preferred Term Level). Frequencies have been evaluated according to the following convention: very 
common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100) , rare (≥1/10 000 to

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Immunogenicity 
Immunogenicity was evaluated during clinical studies with Jivi in 159 (including surgery patients) 
previously treated adolescents (≥ 12 years of age) and adults diagnosed with severe haemophilia A 
(FVIII:C < 1%), and ≥ 150 previous exposure days. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
FVIII inhibitors 
No de novo or confirmed cases of inhibitor against factor VIII occurred. A single unconfirmed positive 
result of a low titre of factor VIII inhibitor (1.7 BU/mL) was reported in one adult patient undergoing 
surgery. 
Anti¬PEG antibodies 
Immunogenicity against PEG with development of specific IgM anti-PEG antibodies was observed in 
one patient. The immune response was accompanied by a clinical hypersensitivity reaction after 
4 injections of Jivi. Antibodies to PEG disappeared after discontinuation of Jivi. 
No clinical immune response to PEG resulting in loss of drug efficacy or hypersensitivity was 
observed from the 5th ED through the end of the extension studies. 
Paediatric population 
In completed clinical studies with 73 paediatric PTPs < 12 years (44 PTPs < 6 years, 29 PTPs 
6¬< 12 years), adverse reactions due to immune response to PEG were observed in children less than 
6 years of age. In 10 of 44 patients (23%) in the age group of younger than 6 years of age loss of drug 
effect due to neutralising anti-PEG antibodies during the first 4 exposure days was observed. In 
3 of 44 patients (7%), loss of drug effect was combined with hypersensitivity reactions (see 
section 4.4). No triggers or predictors of the immune response to PEG could be identified. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There was one case of overdose in the clinical studies. No adverse events were reported. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics: blood coagulation factor VIII, ATC code: B02BD02. 
Mechanism of action 
The factor VIII/von Willebrand factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von 
Willebrand factor) with different physiological functions. When infused into a patient with 
haemophilia, factor VIII binds to patient’s von Willebrand factor. Activated factor VIII acts as a 
cofactor for activated factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X.  
Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin 
and a clot can be formed. Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due 
to decreased levels or absence of factor VIII:C that results in bleeding into joints, muscles or internal 
organs, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. By replacement therapy the 
plasma levels of factor VIII are increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor 
deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies. 
Damoctocog alfa pegol is a PEGylated form of rFVIII. Site-specific PEGylation reduces clearance of 
factor VIII resulting in an extended half-life while maintaining the normal functions of the B-domain 
deleted rFVIII molecule (see section 5.2). Damoctocog alfa pegol does not contain von Willebrand 
factor.

Clinical efficacy and safety 
Clinical studies 
A total of 232 previously treated patients with severe haemophilia A have been exposed in the clinical 
study program which included one phase I study and two phase II/III studies. One-hundred and fifty-
nine (159) subjects were ≥ 12 years of age, 
Phase II/III  
(PROTECT VIII):The pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of Jivi for on demand treatment, 
prophylaxis with three regimens (two times per week 30-40 IU/kg, every 5-days 45-60 IU/kg and 
every 7-days 60 IU/kg) and haemostasis during major surgeries were evaluated in a multi-national, 
open-label, uncontrolled, partially randomized study which was performed in compliance with the 
agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan. An extension study included patients completing the main study. 
The primary efficacy variable was annualized bleed rate (ABR). 
One hundred and thirty-four male PTPs received at least one injection of Jivi (including 13 subjects 
aged 12 to 17 years of age) for prophylaxis (n=114) or on-demand treatment (n=20) for a period of 
36 weeks. A total of 121 subjects received treatment during the extension study, 107 subjects received 
prophylaxis and 14 subjects on-demand treatment. Thirty-six subjects received prophylaxis treatment 
for > 5 years up to 7.0 years. Total median (range) time in study was 3.9 years (0.8 – 7.0 years) in all 
121 patients. Haemostasis during 20 major surgeries in 17 patients was evaluated in the surgery part. 
Phase III  
(Paediatric): Pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of Jivi for three prophylaxis regimens (twice 
weekly, every 5 and every 7 days) and treatment of breakthrough bleeds were evaluated in a multi-
national, uncontrolled, open-label study in 73 paediatric patients (< 12 years of age) during a period of 
50 EDs and at least 6 months. This study has been performed in compliance with the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan. Sixty-one subjects (83.6%) completed the main study and 59 patients continued in 
the optional extension study with a total median time in study of 5.8 years (range 1.0-6.6 years). 
Prophylactic treatment in subjects ≥ 12 years 
During the main study period subjects were assigned to prophylaxis 2x/week (n=24) or randomized to 
every 5 days (n=43) or every 7 days (n=43) or received on-demand treatment (n=20) with Jivi. Ninety 
nine of 110 patients (90%) remained on the assigned regimen. Eleven patients in the every 7 days arm 
increased frequency. The median dose for all prophylaxis regimens was 46.9 IU/kg/injection. The 
median (Q1; Q3) ABR during prophylaxis was 2.09 (0.0; 6.1) for all bleeds and 0.0 (0;0 4.2) for 
spontaneous bleeds as compared to 23.4 (18; 37) total bleeds in the on-demand group. Forty-two out 
of 110 in the prophylaxis arms (38.2%) experienced no bleeding episode. 
During the extension study (median duration of 3.2 years, range 0.1-6.3 years), 23 patients were 
treated 2x/week, 33 patients every 5-days, 23 patients every 7 days during total time in the extension 
study and 28 patients changed treatment regimen. The median dose for prophylaxis was 47.8 IU/kg. 
The overall median (Q1; Q3) total ABR was 1.49 (0.4; 4.8) and 0.75 (0.0: 2.9) for spontaneous bleeds 
in the combined prophylaxis groups and total ABR was 34.1 in the on-demand group. 
Of note, ABR is not comparable between different factor concentrates and between different clinical 
studies. 
Treatment of bleeding 
Of the 702 bleeding events treated with Jivi during the main study, 636 (90.6%) were treated with 1 or 
2 injections, thereof 81.1% with 1 injection. The median (range) dose per injection was 31.7 (14; 
62) IU/kg. During the extension 1902 bleeds were treated with Jivi and 94.0% were controlled with 1 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
or 2 injections, thereof 84.9% with 1 injection. The median (range) dose was 37.9 (15; 
64) IU/kg/injection. 
Perioperative management 
A total of 20 major surgical procedures were performed and assessed in 17 patients. The median total 
dose for major surgeries was 219 IU/kg (range: 50-1500 IU/kg, including postoperative period up to 
3 weeks). Perioperative haemostatic efficacy was rated as good or excellent during all major surgeries. 
Additional 34 minor surgeries were performed in 19 patients. Haemostasis was assessed as good or 
excellent in all available cases. 
Paediatric population < 12 years of age 
The use of Jivi in children below 12 years is not indicated (see section 4.2, for information on 
paediatric use). 
A total of 73 previously treated paediatric patients (44 subjects < 6 years and 29 subjects 
6 to < 12 years) received prophylaxis treatment twice weekly, every 5 days or every 7 days in the 
phase III study. For 53 patients who completed the main study, the median (Q1; Q3) annualised 
bleeding rate was 2.87 (1.1; 6.1) and the spontaneous ABR was 0.0 (0.0; 2.6). For treatment of bleeds, 
84.4 % of the bleeds were resolved with 1 injection, and 91.9% of the bleeds were resolved with 
1 or 2 injections. 
11 patients in the age group < 6 years dropped out due to an immune response to PEG associated with 
loss of efficacy and/or hypersensitivity reaction during the first four ED. 
For 59 patients who continued in the extension study the overall median (Q1; Q3) ABR during the 
extension period was 1.64 (0.5; 3.1). For 30 patients ≥ 12 years at the end of the extension study, the 
median (Q1; Q3) ABR was 1.76 (0.5; 3.3). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of Jivi was compared to that of factor VIII in a crossover Phase I study. 
PK was also evaluated in 22 subjects (≥12 years) and in 16 of these subjects after 6 months of 
prophylaxis treatment in the Phase II/III study. 
The PK data (based on chromogenic assay) indicated that Jivi has a reduced clearance (CL), resulting 
in a terminal half-life that is 1.4-fold longer and a dose normalized AUC which is 1.4-fold higher, as 
compared to the comparative factor VIII product. Dose proportional increases were observed between 
the doses of 25 and 60 IU/kg indicating dose linearity between 25 IU/kg and 60 IU/kg. 
Table 3 summarizes the PK parameters after single dose of 60 IU/kg from the Phase II/III study where 
PK was evaluated in 22 subjects. Repeated PK measurements did not indicate any relevant changes in 
PK characteristics after long-term treatment.

Incremental recovery was determined in 131 patients at several time points. The median (Q1; Q3) 
recovery was 2.6 (2.3; 3.0) by chromogenic assay. 
A population PK model was developed based on all available factor VIII measurements (from dense 
PK sampling and all recovery samples) throughout the 3 clinical studies allowing calculation of PK 
parameters for subjects in the various studies. The table 4 below provides PK parameters based on the 
population PK model.

Jivi was evaluated in pharmacology, single and repeated dose as well as juvenile toxicity studies in 
rats and rabbits. In a long-term, 6-months chronic toxicity study no indication of PEG accumulation or 
other effects related to administration of Jivi were seen. In addition, 4 weeks toxicity studies with the 
PEG moiety of Jivi were conducted in two species. The PEG-linker moiety was also tested in a 
standard set of in vivo and in vitro genotoxicity studies, and they did not indicate a potential for 
genotoxicity. These studies did not reveal any safety concerns for humans. 
Single dose studies in rats with the radio-labelled PEG moiety showed that there was no indication of 
retention or irreversible binding of radioactivity in the animal body. Specifically, no residual 
radioactivity was detected in the brain, indicating that the radio-labelled compound did not cross the 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
blood brain barrier. In distribution and excretion studies in rats, the 60 kDa PEG moiety of Jivi was 
shown to be widely distributed to and eliminated from organs and tissues and excreted in urine (68.4% 
up to day 231 after administration) and faeces (13.8% up to day 168 after administration). 
No long-term studies in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of Jivi, or studies to determine 
the effects of Jivi on reproduction have been conducted.

1 single pack. 
1 multipack with 30 single packs. 
Not all pack sizes may be marketed. 
6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
Jivi powder should only be reconstituted with the supplied solvent (2.5 mL water for injections) in the 
prefilled-syringe and the vial adapter. The medicinal product must be prepared for injection under 
aseptic conditions. If any component of the package is opened or damaged, do not use this component. 
After reconstitution the solution is clear and colourless and then drawn back into the syringe. 
Parenteral medicinal products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discolouration 
prior to administration. 
The reconstituted product must be filtered prior to administration to remove potential particulate 
matter in the solution. Filtering is achieved by using the vial adapter. 
Detailed instructions for reconstitution and administration of Jivi 
You will need alcohol swabs, gauze pads, plasters and tourniquet. These items are not included in the 
Jivi package. 
1.  Wash your hands thoroughly using soap and warm water. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Hold an unopened vial and also a syringe in your hands to warm it to a comfortable 
temperature (do not exceed 37 °C). 
Remove the protective cap from the vial (A). Wipe the rubber stopper on 
the vial with an alcohol swab and allow the stopper to air dry before use. 
Place the powder vial on a firm, non-slip surface. Peel off the paper cover 
on the plastic housing of the vial adapter. Do not remove the adapter from 
the plastic housing. Holding the adapter housing, place over the powder 
vial and firmly press down (B). The adapter will snap over the vial cap. Do 
not remove the adapter housing at this point. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5. 
6. 
Hold the pre-filled syringe with solvent upright. Grasp the plunger rod as 
per the picture and attach the rod by turning it firmly clockwise into the 
threaded stopper (C). 
Holding the syringe by the barrel, snap the syringe cap off the tip (D). Do 
not touch the syringe tip with your hand or any surface. Set the syringe 
aside for further use. 
7. 
Now remove and discard the adapter housing (E). 
8. 
Attach the pre-filled syringe to the threaded vial adapter by turning 
clockwise (F). 
9. 
Inject the solvent by slowly pushing down on the plunger rod (G). 
10.  Swirl vial gently until all the powder is dissolved (H). Do not shake the 
vial. Be sure that the powder is completely dissolved. Look to check there 
are no particles or discoloration before you use the solution. Do not use 
solutions containing visible particles or that are cloudy. 
11.  Hold the vial on the end above the vial adapter and syringe (I). Fill the 
syringe by drawing the plunger out slowly and smoothly. Ensure that the 
full content of the vial is drawn into the syringe. Hold the syringe upright 
and push the plunger until no air is left in the syringe. 
12.  Apply a tourniquet to your arm. 
13.  Determine the point of injection and clean the skin. 
14.  Puncture the vein and secure the venipuncture set with a plaster. 
15.  Holding the vial adapter in place, remove the syringe from the vial adapter 
(the adapter should remain attached to the vial). Attach the syringe to the 
venipuncture set (J). Ensure that no blood enters the syringe  
16.  Remove tourniquet. 
17. 
Inject the solution into a vein over 2 to 5 minutes, keeping an eye on the position of the 
needle. The speed of injection should be based on your comfort, but should not be faster than 
2.5 mL per minute. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
18. 
19. 
If a further dose is needed, use a new syringe with the powder reconstituted as described 
above. 
If no further dose is required, remove the venipuncture set and syringe. Hold a pad firmly 
over the injection site on your outstretched arm for about 2 minutes. Finally, apply a small 
pressure dressing to the injection site and consider if a plaster is necessary. 
20. 
It is recommended that every time you use Jivi, you note down the name and the batch 
number of the product. 
21.  Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist 
or physician how to throw away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help 
protect the environment 
Jivi is for single use only. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Jivi is and what it is used for 
Jivi contains the active substance damoctocog alfa pegol. It is produced by recombinant technology 
without addition of any human- or animal-derived components in the manufacturing process. 
Factor VIII is a protein naturally found in the blood that helps to clot it. The protein in damoctocog 
alfa pegol has been modified (pegylated) to prolong its action in the body. 
Jivi is used to treat and prevent bleeding in previously treated adults and adolescents aged from 
12 years with haemophilia A (hereditary factor VIII deficiency). It is not for use in children younger 
than 12 years of age. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Jivi 
Do not use Jivi if you are 
• 
allergic to damoctocog alfa pegol or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
allergic to mouse or hamster proteins. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have 
• 
tightness in the chest, fall in blood pressure (often shown by feeling dizzy when getting up 
quickly), itchy nettle-rash, wheezing, feeling sick or faint. These may be signs of a rare severe 
sudden allergic reaction to this medicine. Stop injecting the product immediately and get 
medical help at once if this occurs. 
bleeding that is not being controlled with your usual dose of this medicine. Speak with your 
doctor immediately if this occurs. You may have developed antibodies against factor VIII 
(inhibitors) or antibodies against polyethylene glycol (PEG). These make Jivi less effective at 
preventing and controlling bleeding. Your doctor may carry out tests to confirm this and ensure 
• 
• 
74 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
that your Jivi dose provides adequate factor VIII levels. Your doctor may switch you back to 
your previous factor VIII treatment, if needed. 
previously developed factor VIII inhibitors to a different product. 
heart disease or you are at risk of heart disease.  
to use a central venous access device for this medicine. You may be at risk of device-related 
complications where the catheter is inserted including: 
•  local infections  
•  bacteria in the blood 
•  a blood clot in the blood vessel 
Children 
Jivi is not for use in children younger than 12 years of age. 
Other medicines and Jivi 
Jivi is not known to influence or be influenced by other medicines. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
Jivi has no influence on your ability to drive and use machines. 
Jivi contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3. 
How to use Jivi 
Treatment with Jivi will be started by a doctor who is experienced in the care of patients with 
haemophilia A. After suitable training patients or carers may be able to give Jivi at home. 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure. The dose of factor VIII units is measured in International Units (IU). 
Treatment of bleeding 
To treat a bleed, your doctor will calculate and adjust your dose and how often it should be given, 
depending on factors such as: 
• 
your weight 
• 
the severity of your haemophilia A 
• 
where the bleeding is and how serious it is 
• 
whether you have inhibitors and how high their level is 
• 
the factor VIII level that is needed. 
Prevention of bleeding 
To prevent bleeding your doctor will select an appropriate dose and frequency depending on your 
need: 
• 
• 
• 
45–60 IU per kg body weight every 5 days or 
60 IU per kg body weight every 7 days or 
30–40 IU per kg body weight two times per week. 
Laboratory tests 
Laboratory tests at suitable intervals help to ensure you always have adequate factor VIII levels. For 
major surgery in particular, your blood clotting must be closely monitored. 
75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Duration of treatment 
Usually Jivi treatment for haemophilia is needed lifelong. 
How Jivi is given 
Jivi is injected into a vein over 2 to 5 minutes depending on the total volume and your comfort level. 
The maximum rate is 2.5 mL per minute. Jivi should be used within 3 hours after reconstitution. 
How Jivi is prepared for injection 
Use only the components (vial adapter, pre-filled syringe containing solvent and venipuncture set) 
provided with each package of this medicine. Please contact your doctor if these components cannot 
be used. Do not use if any component of the package is opened or damaged. 
The reconstituted product must be filtered by using the vial adapter before injection to remove any 
possible particles in the solution.  
This medicine must not be mixed with other injections. Do not use solutions that are cloudy or contain 
visible particles. Follow the instructions for use given by your doctor and provided at the end of this 
leaflet. 
If you use more Jivi than you should 
Tell your doctor if this occurs. No symptoms of overdose have been reported. 
If you forget to use Jivi 
Inject your next dose immediately and continue at regular intervals as advised by your doctor.  
Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you stop using Jivi 
Do not stop using this medicine without checking with your doctor. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Detailed instructions for reconstitution and administration of Jivi 
You will need alcohol swabs, gauze pads, plasters and tourniquet. These items are not included in the 
Jivi package. 
1.  Wash your hands thoroughly using soap and warm water. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
6. 
Hold an unopened vial and also a syringe in your hands to warm it to a comfortable 
temperature (do not exceed 37 °C). 
Remove the protective cap from the vial (A). Wipe the rubber stopper on 
the vial with an alcohol swab and allow the stopper to air dry before use. 
Place the powder vial on a firm, non-slip surface. Peel off the paper cover 
on the plastic housing of the vial adapter. Do not remove the adapter from 
the plastic housing. Holding the adapter housing, place over the powder 
vial and firmly press down (B). The adapter will snap over the vial cap. Do 
not remove the adapter housing at this point. 
Hold the pre-filled syringe with solvent upright. Grasp the plunger rod as 
per the picture and attach the rod by turning it firmly clockwise into the 
threaded stopper (C). 
Holding the syringe by the barrel, snap the syringe cap off the tip (D). Do 
not touch the syringe tip with your hand or any surface. Set the syringe 
aside for further use. 
7. 
Now remove and discard the adapter housing (E). 
8. 
Attach the pre-filled syringe to the threaded vial adapter by turning 
clockwise (F). 
9. 
Inject the solvent by slowly pushing down on the plunger rod (G).

10.  Swirl vial gently until all the powder is dissolved (H). Do not shake the 
vial. Be sure that the powder is completely dissolved. Look to check there 
are no particles or discoloration before you use the solution. Do not use 
solutions containing visible particles or that are cloudy. 
11.  Hold the vial on the end above the vial adapter and syringe (I). Fill the 
syringe by drawing the plunger out slowly and smoothly. Ensure that the 
full content of the vial is drawn into the syringe. Hold the syringe upright 
and push the plunger until no air is left in the syringe. 
12.  Apply a tourniquet to your arm. 
13.  Determine the point of injection and clean the skin. 
14.  Puncture the vein and secure the venipuncture set with a plaster. 
15.  Holding the vial adapter in place, remove the syringe from the vial adapter 
(the adapter should remain attached to the vial). Attach the syringe to the 
venipuncture set (J). Ensure that no blood enters the syringe  
16.  Remove tourniquet. 
17. 
18. 
19. 
Inject the solution into a vein over 2 to 5 minutes, keeping an eye on the position of the 
needle. The speed of injection should be based on your comfort, but should not be faster than 
2.5 mL per minute. 
If a further dose is needed, use a new syringe with the powder reconstituted as described 
above. 
If no further dose is required, remove the venipuncture set and syringe. Hold a pad firmly 
over the injection site on your outstretched arm for about 2 minutes. Finally, apply a small 
pressure dressing to the injection site and consider if a plaster is necessary. 
20. 
It is recommended that every time you use Jivi, you note down the name and the batch 
number of the product. 
21.  Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist 
or physician how to throw away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help 
protect the environment

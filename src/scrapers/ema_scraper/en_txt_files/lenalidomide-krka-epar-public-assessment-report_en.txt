2.2.2. Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of lenalidomide hydrochloride monohydrate is 3-(4-amino-1-oxo-1,3-dihydro-2H-
isoindol-2-yl)piperidine-2,6-dione hydrochloride monohydrate or 3-(4-amino-1-oxoisoindolin-2-
yl)piperidine-2,6-dione hydrochloride monohydrate, corresponding to the molecular formula 
C13H13N3O3.HCl.H2O. Lenalidomide hydrochloride monohydrate has a relative molecular mass of 313.6 
g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
The active substance is a white to yellow coloured solid which is non-hygroscopic, very slightly soluble 
to practically insoluble in water with the highest solubility in strongly acidic media. 
The chemical structure of lenalidomide hydrochloride monohydrate was elucidated and confirmed by a 
combination of High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry, Mass Spectroscopy, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance 
Spectroscopy (1H & 13C NMR), Infrared Spectroscopy and UV Spectroscopy. The solid-state properties 
of the active substance were measured by powder and single-crystal X-ray diffraction and dynamic 
vapour sorption. 
Lenalidomide exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of one chiral centre. Lenalidomide 
hydrochloride monohydrate is produced as a racemic mixture. 
Lenalidomide hydrochloride monohydrate exhibits polymorphism. A consistent polymorph is produced.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing process of the active substance has been provided in the 
restricted part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory.  
Lenalidomide is synthesized using well-defined starting materials with acceptable specifications. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
During the procedure, a major objection was raised in relation to the definition of one starting 
material. In response, the applicant provided detailed justifications. Limits for impurities were 
tightened and the specification revised with additional tests as requested. The carry-over of impurities 
from the starting material to the active substance was studied and relevant information included in the 
ASMF. No impurities formed upstream of the starting material carry-over to the active substance. 
Therefore, the starting material was deemed acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/3806/2021 
Page 11/48  
 
 
 
 
 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their origin and characterised. 
This included a discussion on the limits for potential mutagenic impurities as well as results from 
spiking experiments. Spiking experiments confirmed the absence of certain potential mutagenic 
impurities for which it was therefore not necessary to include limits in the active substance 
specification. The active substance specification includes an appropriate limit for one known mutagenic 
impurity. The contents of solvents used in the last steps of the manufacturing process of active 
substance are controlled in the specification of the active substance. 
Elemental analysis as per ICH Q3D was performed on three active substance batches. Class 1 and 2A 
elemental impurities have been considered, including palladium which is intentionally added during the 
process as a catalyst. Results for all elements are below the 30 % ICH limit and hence no further 
control of elemental impurities in the active substance is required. 
Evaluation of the presence of N-nitrosamines in lenalidomide hydrochloride monohydrate shows that 
the contamination of the N-nitrosamine impurities is not expected in the synthesis of the active 
substance. 
The active substance is packaged in a transparent low-density polyethylene bag (LDPE) filled with 
nitrogen, which comply with Commission Regulation EU No. 10/2011 as amended. These LDPE bags 
are further packed in another LDPE bag containing a one-gram silica gel pillow pack and the bag is 
sealed with a strip seal. The bag is then packed in a triple laminated sunlight barrier bag (TSLB) with 
heat seal and kept in a high-density polyethylene container. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity (IR, HPLC), water content 
(Ph. Eur.), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), impurities (Ph. Eur.), assay (Ph. Eur.), residual solvents (Ph. 
Eur.), microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.) and particle size (Ph. Eur.). 
The maximum daily dose for lenalidomide is 25 mg/day. Therefore, the ICH recommended thresholds 
for reporting, identification and qualification in the active substance are 0.05%, 0.10% and 0.15%, 
respectively. Impurities limits have been set below the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A 
and in line with the TTC according to ICH M7. A TTC limit for one mutagenic impurity has been set in 
accordance with ICH M7. 
In response to a question raised during the assessment, specification limits for particle size were 
tightened to be not significantly different to the limits of the batches used in the bioequivalence study. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from three production scale batches of the active substance are provided. The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from four production scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in the proposed commercial container closure system for up to 24 months under long term 
conditions (25ºC / 60% RH), up to 24 months under refrigerated conditions (5ºC) and for up to six 
months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
No change in relevant specification parameters has been observed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/3806/2021 
Page 12/48  
 
 
 
 
Photostability testing following ICH guideline Q1B was performed. Results under stressed conditions 
(acid and base hydrolysis, oxidative degradation, thermal degradation and humidity degradation) were 
also provided.  
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months when stored 
under a nitrogen atmosphere at a temperature not exceeding 25°C in the proposed container. 
Excursions are permitted between 15-30°C. 
2.2.3. Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as hard capsules containing 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 
20 mg or 25 mg of lenalidomide. The different hard capsule strengths are appropriately differentiated 
by their colour and size. 
The 2.5 mg and 5 mg strength are weight proportional. In addition, the 7.5 mg is proportional to 10 
mg and the 15 mg, 20 mg and 25 mg are weight proportional. 
Lenalidomide hydrochloride monohydrate is classified as a BCS I active substance.  
Lenalidomide hydrochloride monohydrate exhibits polymorphism. The polymorphic form of the active 
substance was demonstrated in stability studies and does not change during formulation. 
The aim of the product development was to formulate a bioequivalent, effective and safe generic 
alternative to the reference medicinal product Revlimid hard capsules. 
The seven strengths of finished product were designed into three dose-proportional groups with a 
separate common capsulation mixture for each. One group includes 2.5 mg and 5 mg, the other group 
includes 7.5 mg and 10 mg and the last group includes 15 mg, 20 mg and 25 mg strength. 
The qualitative composition of the excipients is different from that in the reference product. 
All the excipients except the empty hypromellose capsule shells are conventional pharmaceutical 
ingredients and comply with the requirements of the European Pharmacopoeia. The components of 
empty hypromellose capsule shells comply either with the monograph in Ph. Eur. or with Directive (EU) 
No. 231/2012 (colourants). Based on the results of ICH stability testing, it has been concluded that the 
active substance is compatible with the excipients of the present formulations and that the formulation 
is stable. The test product and the EU reference product exhibit similar impurity profiles. The list of 
excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.2.1 of this report. 
The purpose of the development was to choose the same or similar excipients as contained in the 
reference product. However, compared to the reference product, several modifications of the 
qualitative composition have been made during the development. 
The proposed final formulation showed similar chemical stability compared to the reference product, 
which confirms good compatibility of active substance with the new excipients. Moreover, compatibility 
of the active substance with the proposed excipients was additionally verified with ICH stability studies 
under accelerated and long-term conditions  
The information provided to demonstrate the discriminatory power of dissolution method is considered 
adequate. However, as lenalidomide is a BCS class I active substance with very high solubility over the

physiological pH range and with rapid dissolution, it is not possible to detect any differences in 
dissolution behaviour.  
Clinical bioequivalence studies were performed on the 25 mg and 5 mg capsules. In addition, 
comparative dissolution profiles of 25 mg and 5 mg capsules of Lenalidomide test product and the 
reference product were generated in four dissolution media: pH 1.2, pH 4.5, pH 6.8 and in the QC 
medium. The dissolution profiles can be considered as similar. A strength biowaiver was claimed for 
the other five strengths not used in clinical bioequivalence studies. All additional five dosage strengths 
of Lenalidomide capsules (2.5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg) have similar rapid dissolution 
profiles to the biobatches  
The formulations used in the bioequivalence studies were manufactured by the same manufacturer, 
same manufacturing process and same type of equipment as the to-be marked formulations presented 
within this marketing authorization application dossier. The production batch size is the same as the 
size of batches in the bioequivalence study. 
The manufacturing process used to produce the generic product is the same as for the reference 
product (blending and capsules filling). During development, prototypes of each strength were 
developed and tested in order to develop a final composition of each strength. The critical process 
parameters determined during development are appropriately controlled during manufacture of the 
encapsulation mixture.  
The primary packaging is peel open, unit dose blister (OPA/Al/PVC//PET/Al). The material complies with 
Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability 
data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of two main steps: manufacturing of the encapsulation mixture and 
the encapsulation process, followed by packaging. 
The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
The critical steps involved in the manufacturing process include preparation of the encapsulation 
mixture and encapsulation. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing 
process. 
Process validation has been carried out on three commercial size batches of each strength. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of the 
intended quality in a reproducible manner.  
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form 
(appearance, uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.),  identification (HPLC, UV),  related substances (Ph. 
Eur.), assay (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (Ph. Eur.) and microbiological purity). 
In line with new regulatory requirements, a risk assessment for the presence of nitrosamines has been 
performed and no risk of nitrosamines presence in the medicinal product was identified. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk 
assessment and the presented batch data, it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any 
elemental impurity controls in the finished product specification. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/3806/2021 
Page 14/48  
 
 
 
 
The analytical procedures used in the control of the finished product have been described in a 
satisfactory manner and validation data of the in-house analytical methods are in accordance with the 
requirements of the relevant ICH guidelines and acceptable. The information about reference standards 
is provided and sufficient. 
Results of analysis of three production size batches of each strength are within the specification limits 
at the time of testing, confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to 
manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
A stability study has been performed on three production scale batches of each strength of the finished 
product, packed in the proposed market pack in accordance with ICH guidelines. No bracketing and 
matrixing designs were used in the stability study. Data is available from finished product batches 
stored for up to 12 months under long term conditions (25±2 °C / 60±5% RH) and up to 6 months 
under accelerated conditions (40±2 °C / 75±5% RH). Up to 18 months’ long-term data is available for 
the 25 mg capsules. Samples were tested for appearance, assay, degradation products, dissolution and 
microbiological quality. All results are within the proposed limits. No trend of increasing impurities was 
observed under accelerated or long-term conditions. 
A photostability study was conducted as per ICH Q1B guideline and there were no out of specification 
results. Therefore, the capsules are not photosensitive. 
Based on the results of stability studies under accelerated conditions and the photostability study 
conducted, no special storage conditions are proposed. The proposed shelf-life of 2 years with no 
special storage conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
Bioequivalence has been demonstrated between the lenalidomide 5 mg and 25 mg hard capsule and 
the reference product Revlimid 5 and 25 mg hard capsules and biowaivers have been accepted for the 
other strengths (2.5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg). 
A major objection related to the designation of one of the starting materials was resolved after the 
applicant provided additional justifications and tightened specification parameters for impurities. 
2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data have 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

2.2.6. Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
 Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1. Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, 
which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no 
need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The 
non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity 
profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. 
2.3.2. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment studies were submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Lenalidomide Krka is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the 
combined sales volumes for all lenalidomide containing products and the exposure of the environment 
to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar. 
2.3.3. Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The safety use of hydrochloride monohydrate as the counter ion has been discussed and theirs uses as 
salt justified. In aqueous solution, the drug substance dissociates to lenalidomide base and chloride 
ion. Therefore, it is concluded that the drug will possess the same safety and efficacy profile as the 
originator product in terms of the lenalidomide component. 
The applicant’s justification for non-submission of an Environmental Risk Assessment is considered 
acceptable.  
The non-clinical data is reflected in the appropriate sections of the SmPC (Sections 4.6 and 5.3). The 
non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product (Revlimid capsules 
SmPC, 2019) 
2.3.4. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
A summary of the literature with regard to non-clinical data of Lenalidomide Krka and justifications 
that the different salt of the active substance does not differ significantly in properties with regards to 
safety and efficacy of the reference product was provided and was accepted by the CHMP. This is in 
accordance with the relevant guideline and additional non clinical studies were not considered 
necessary.

 Clinical aspects  
This is an application for hard capsules containing lenalidomide. To support the marketing 
authorisation application the applicant conducted 2 bioequivalence studies with cross-over design 
under fasting conditions. These studies were pivotal for the assessment. 
No CHMP scientific advice pertinent to the clinical development was given for this medicinal product.  
For the clinical assessment the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr **), the Guideline on Bioanalytical method validation 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/09 Rev.1/Corr. 2**) and Lenalidomide product-specific BE guidance 
(EMA/CHMP/177335/2016/Corr.) in their current versions are of particular relevance. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Exemption  
To support this application, the applicant has conducted two bioequivalence studies (study 18-615 and 
study 19-641) in order to justify an exemption from the requirement to perform bioequivalence studies 
for the remaining strengths. The BE study on the 5 mg strength was used to support a bio-waiver of 
the 2.5 mg strength and the study on the 25 mg strength was used to support a biowaiver of the 7.5 
mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg strengths respectively. 
  The applicant requested a waiver of bio-studies on remaining strengths i.e. 7.5/10/15/20 mg, 
based on the result of the bioequivalence studies conducted with the 5 mg and 25 mg mg 
strength. The relevant (a)-(f) criteria defined in the applicable bioequivalence guideline were 
fullfilled by showing either quantitative proportionality between strengths or applying the 
bracketing approach for quantitatively not proportional strengths.  
  Dissolution of lenalidomide hydrochloride monohydrate from Lenalidomide 7.5 mg and 10 mg 
capsules was compared to lenalidomide base from Revlimid 7.5 mg and 10 mg. Dissolution 
profiles were performed in four-dissolution medium i.e. 0.1M HCl, acetate buffer pH 4.5, 
phosphate buffer pH 6.8 and QC medium. Based on the solubility results, the pH-solubility 
profile of the drug substance indicates that lenalidomide has comparable solubility in both 
forms – as base and as hydrochloride salt.  
  Absorption Profile 
As per the pharmacokinetics parameter available in the literature, Lenalidomide is rapidly absorbed 
following oral administration. Following single and multiple doses of REVLIMID in patients with MM the 
maximum plasma concentrations occurred between 0.5 and 6.0 hours post-dose. The single and 
multiple dose pharmacokinetic disposition of lenalidomide is linear with AUC and Cmax values 
increasing proportionally with dose. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose regimen does not result 
in drug accumulation. 
  Linear pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide 
The pharmacokinetic disposition of lenalidomide is linear for the proposed dosing range (2.5 mg to 25 
mg) and there is no accumulation with multiple dosing (Revlimid SPC, 2019).

  In-vitro Dissolution Data for Biowaiver Request for Different Strengths 
Dissolution profiles of Lenalidomide capsules of additional strengths (2.5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg 
and 20 mg) were compared to dissolution profiles of Lenalidomide 25 mg capsules and Lenalidomide 5 
mg capsules which were used in bioequivalence studies. Dissolution profiles were performed in four 
different dissolution media without surfactant i.e. 0.1M Hydrochloric acid, Acetate buffer solution pH 
4.5, Phosphate buffer solution pH 6.8 and QC medium in order to apply for a biowaiver for additional 
strengths. 
On the basis of the presented dissolution profiles, similarity in dissolution has been demonstrated at 
the four requested pH levels between the test biobatch (5 mg and 25 mg) and the lower strengths (2.5 
mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg) as more than 85% of the labeled amount of the drug is 
released within 15 minutes from all strengths of test product and therefore it can be concluded that the 
dissolution profiles can be considered similar to the test biobatch (5 mg and 25 mg) without further 
mathematical calculations. 
Biowaiver for 2.5 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg strengths 
The (a)-(c) criteria defined in the BE guideline are fullfilled since a) the pharmaceutical products are 
manufactured by the same manufacturing process, b) the qualitative composition of the different 
strengths is the same and c) the compositions of the strengths are quantitatively proportional. 
Concerning the criterion (d) (similar in-vitro performance), the applicant has provided comparative 
dissolution data. Dissolution tests were conducted at different pH values 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8 between 1) 
the Lenalidomide Krka 2.5 and 5 mg tablets vs bio-batch 5 mg (batch used for the bioequivalence 
testing) and 2) Lenalidomide Krka 15 and 20 mg vs bio-batch 25 mg (batch used for the 
bioequivalence testing).  
More than 85% of the labeled amount of the drug is released within 15 minutes from all strengths of 
test product tested in 0.1 N HCl, pH 4.5 Acetate buffer, pH 6.8 Phosphate buffer and QC dissolution 
medium (0.01M HCl) and thus the dissolution profiles can be considered similar to the test biobatch (5 
mg and 25 mg) without further mathematical calculations. 
Biowaiver for 7.5 mg and 10 mg strengths 
The (a)-(b) criteria defined in the BE guideline are fullfilled since a) the pharmaceutical products are 
manufactured by the same manufacturing process, b) the qualitative composition of the different 
strengths is the same. Concedering c) the compositions of the strengths are not quantitatively 
proportional, the applicant used a bracketing approach.  
Concerning the criterion (d) (similar in-vitro performance), the applicant has provided comparative 
dissolution data. Dissolution tests were conducted at different pH values 1.2, 4.5, 6.8 and QC 
dissolution medium between 1) the Lenalidomide Krka 7.5 mg and 10 mg tablets vs 5 mg (batch used 
for the bioequivalence testing) and 2) Lenalidomide Krka 7.5 mg and 10 mg mg vs 25 mg (batch used 
for the bioequivalence testing). More than 85% of the labeled amount of the drug is released within 15 
minutes from both strengths of test product tested in 0.1 N HCl, pH 4.5 Acetate buffer, pH 6.8 
Phosphate buffer and the QC dissolution medium and thus the dissolution profiles can be considered 
similar to the test biobatches (5 mg and 25 mg) without further mathematical calculations. 
A)  Comparative Dissolution Studies (Test product vs Reference product) 
The applicant carried out comparative dissolution studies between the test products (Lenalidomide 
Krka 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 25 mg capsules, respectively and the reference products (Revlimid 5 mg, 
7,5 mg, 10 mg and 25 mg capsules). respectively in four dissolution media i.e. 0.1 M Hydrochloric 
acid, Acetate buffer solution pH 4.5, Phosphate buffer solution pH 6.8 and QC medium.

Test product (7.5 mg and 10 mg) Vs reference product (7.5 mg and 10 mg) 
Based on presented in vitro comparison of dissolution profiles of Lenalidomide 7.5 mg and 10 mg 
capsules to the corresponding strengths of the reference Revlimid 7.5 mg and 10 mg capsules 
performed in three different buffers (pH 1.2 , 4.5 and 6.8) and QC dissolution medium , it can be 
concluded that all batches express similar dissolution profiles in QC medium,0.1M HCl and acetate 
buffer pH 4.5 as ≥ 85% of lenalidomide is dissolved within 15 minutes.  
The exception is slower dissolution profile of lenalidomide from Revlimid 7.5 mg and 10 mg hard 
capsule in phosphate buffer pH 6.8. According to the applicant, the main reason of slightly slower 
dissolution of Revlimid 7.5 mg and 10 mg is apparatus type related. Furthermore, different dissolutions 
profiles between test and reference product is observed at the first time point of 5 minutes.Differences 
in release at the first time point of 5 minutes between the test and reference products are not found 
critical, since the observed differences in release more reflect product quality than in vivo performance 
of lenalidomide as lenalidomide is rapidly absorbed with the tmax of 0.5-2 hours and half-life in plasma 
of approx. 3-5 hours and possible reasons for the discrepancy is addressed and justified. 
Test product (5 mg and 25 mg) Vs reference product (5 mg and 25 mg) 
Based on the comparative dissolution profiles of the test product Lenalidomide Krka 5 mg and 25 mg 
vs the reference product Revlimid  5 mg and 25 mg capsules of “Celgene Europe Limited, UK, in all 
dissolution media, it can be concluded that all batches express similar dissolution profiles in QC 
medium and pH 4.5 as ≥ 85% of lenalidomide is dissolved within 15 minutes.  
Slower dissolution profile of lenalidomide from Revlimid 5 mg and 25 mg hard capsule in phosphate 
buffer pH 6.8 is not found critical, since bioequivalence was demonstrated in vivo and possible reasons 
for the discrepancy of the in vitro/in vivo data is addressed and justified. 
In view of dissolution data, linear pharmacokinetics, a biowaiver is supported for the other strengths 
applied for, 2.5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg. The bracketing approach for the waiving of 
additional bioequivalence study on the 7.5 mg and 10 mg strengths is considered acceptable. The 
results of the bioequivalence studies performed with the 5 mg and 25 mg strengths can be 
extrapolated to the other strengths of 2.5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg. 
Clinical studies 
To support the application, the applicant has submitted 2 bioequivalence studies to support the 
bracketing approach pursued to apply for the strength biowaivers as explained in the exemptions 
section above.

Study Title: A Single-Dose, Bioequivalence Study of Two Formulations of Lenalidomide 25 mg 
Capsules, Hard under Fasting Conditions. 
Methods 
Study design  
This was an open-label, single-dose, randomized, two-period, two-treatment, two-sequence, 
crossover, study, designed to evaluate the bioequivalence of lenalidomide in healthy, non-smoking, 
male subjects under fasted conditions, with a washout period of 7 days between the successive dosing 
days. In each period, subjects were administered a single, oral dose of the test or reference product, in 
accordance with the randomization scheme, after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours. 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the bioequivalence between Lenalidomide 25 mg 
capsules, hard and Revlimid 25 mg hard capsules (lenalidomide) after a single dose in healthy subjects 
administered under fasted conditions. 
The secondary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the study 
treatments.

Summary of study information 
The protocol was approved by the institutional review board (IRB), the Ethics Review Board of 
Optimum Clinical Research Inc. prior to initiating the study. 
The study was conducted at the highest/most sensitive strength (i.e., 25 mg for lenalidomide) and 
under fasting conditions, which reflects recommendations in the reference product’s summary of 
product characteristics for the administration of the product irrespective of mealtimes and it is 
considered to be the most sensitive condition to detect a potential difference between formulations.  
Such a study design is in line with the Lenalidomide Product-specific Bioequivalence Guidance 
(EMA/CHMP/177335/2016/Corr).  
The  study  was  initiated  with  70  healthy  adult  male  subjects  in  accordance  with  the  protocol.  Each 
subjects  received  one  tablet  of  either  a  single,  oral  dose  of  25  mg  (1  ×  25  mg)  of  the  test  product, 
lenalidomide  capsules,  25  mg  or  a  single  oral  dose  of  25  mg  (1  ×  25  mg)  of  the  reference  product, 
Revlimid  capsules  25  mg  randomly  with  240  mL  of  drinking  water  on  the  day  of  dosing  as  per  the 
randomization schedule under fasting conditions in each period of the study. Dosing occurred following 
an overnight fast of at least 10 hours. There was a 7-day washout period between dosing times for the 
two treatment periods, which is considered adequate as lenalidomide has an elimination half-life of 3-5 
hours (about 3 hours in the actual study). Pre-dose levels were not observed in any subjects.  
In each study period, blood samples were collected within 60 minutes prior to dose administration (0 
hour) and at intervals over 14.00 hours after administration of dose. The sampling period was sufficient 
to characterize the plasma concentration-time profile. Blood sampling points are appropriate to allow an 
accurate measurement of Tmax.  
The  quantification  of  Lenalidomide  in  plasma  was  performed  using  ultra  high-performance  liquid 
chromatography with tandem mass spectroscopy.

between the test and reference product is less than 5%, which is acceptable. This difference was not 
taken into account in the pharmacokinetic or statistical analysis. 
The test product used in the study was considered to be representative of the product to be 
marketed.A signed statement confirming that the test product has the same quantitative composition 
and is manufactured by the same process as the one submitted for authorisation is provided. 
Population(s) studied 
As per the protocol, 70 non-smoker, healthy, adult, male volunteers 18 to 55 years of age, having a 
Body Mass Index (BMI) between ≥19.0 and ≤30.0 kg/m2 and with normal clinical and laboratory 
results. The population chosen was according to the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1). Inclusion and exclusion criteria were acceptable and performed 
according to the protocol requirements. All the subjects were dosed as per the randomization. 
The sample size calculation provided by the applicant is considered acceptable. 
Out of the dosed 70 subjects, 67 subjects completed the study. Three subjects discontinued, after 
enrolment in the study in Period-I. The reason of the withdrawal was acceptable. In response to the 
D120 LoQ, the applicant has documented withdrawal of those subjects by presenting the Case Report 
Forms (CRFs).  
A total of 67 subjects were included in the pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis. The safety 
assessment includes information for all 70 subjects who were dosed at least once during this study. 
There  were  no  protocol  deviations  during  the  conduct  of  study  except  minor  sampling  time  point 
deviations (up to 5 minutes). Actual time-points of the sample collection are used for the calculation of 
pharmacokinetic parameters. 
Analytical methods 
Pre-study and in-study validations were performed according to the requirements of the EMA Guideline 
on bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/09).  
Statement on GLP compliance is provided. 
In-study validation (study 18-615): 
The sample analysis was performed according to Bioanalytical Sample Analysis Plan.  
The plasma samples of subjects were analysed using a validated achiral, liquid chromatographic tandem 
mass spectrometric detection (LC-MS/MS) method.  
Check-in plasma samples from tentative subjects were assayed between March 6, 2019 and March 7, 
2019. Plasma samples from dosed subjects were assayed between March 8, 2019 and March 19, 2019. 
All personnel from the Bioanalytical Facility were blinded regarding the study randomization code and 
treatment plan. 
Long-term storage stability was established.Certificates of analysis for reference and internal standard 
were included in the dossier. 
Details of subject samples: 
Clinical  Facility.  140  check-in  plasma  samples  from  70  tentative  subjects,  6  unused  samples  from 
tentative subjects, who were not enrolled in the study, and plasma samples from 70 dosed subjects were

received at bioanalytical site. During transfer to the bioanalytical centre, the samples were kept in a box 
containing adequate amount of dry ice. All the received samples were transferred to the freezer at the 
bioanalytical facility.  
Calibration curve standards and quality control samples met the acceptance criteria for all the runs 
used for the final data, demonstrating satisfactory performance of the method during the analysis of 
study subject samples.  
Repeat samples 
Seven (7) plasma samples were repeated in accordance with applicable SOPs due to unacceptable 
internal standard response, poor chromatography and sample position error. In response to the D120 
LoQ, the applicant has clarified the raised issue regarding reanalysis of samples due to sample position 
error in the autosampler rack. The reasons for reanalysis of samples are thus considered justified. 
Incurred Sample Reanalysis (ISR) 
ISR was performed with more than 5 % of the samples as requested by the guideline for total number 
samples exceeding 1000 samples. The ISR assay complied with the acceptance criteria as all samples 
(100%) were within the acceptance criteria (±20%) indicating that the analysis is robust. 
Twenty percent of the subject’s chromatograms are presented in this report.  
Pre-study validation (study 18-615):  
Two validations  were performed, because the original version of the validation report was re-
formatted to comply with the current SOP requirements and procedures for eCTD submission. 
A liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometric method for the determination of lenalidomide in 
human plasma has been developed and validated according to Bioanalytical Validation Plan.  
Adequate Certificates of analysis of the analyte and the internal standard are provided for each version 
of the Method validation report.  
The method validation report provides results of calibration curve standard, quality control sample 
data, sensitivity (precision and accuracy), linearity, stability data, recovery, dilution integrity, 
selectivity, injection carryover, matrix effect, matrix factor, hemolyzed QC samples experiment, lipemic 
QC samples experiment, specificity, evaluation of Lenalidomide in the presence of concomitant 
medications and hormonal contraceptives, and batch size determination. The method met the 
acceptance criteria for all the validation parameters evaluated, demonstrating acceptable performance. 
It can be concluded that the quantification method is selective for the analysis of Lenalidomide in 
presence of the co-administered drugs. The co-administered drug did not affect the determination of 
Lenalidomide or IS. 
In addition, no significant degradation of Lenalidomide was observed under different storage 
conditions. 
The possible back conversion of metabolites to Lenalidomide was evaluated at the stage of 
bioanalytical method validation. It can be concluded that there was no back-conversion. 
It was demonstrated that the method has acceptable selectivity and specificity and is able to 
accurately quantify concentrations of lenalidomide in human plasma.

Pharmacokinetic variables 
The PK parameters Cmax, AUCt, AUCinf, Tmax, Kel, and Thalf estimated for lenalidomide were computed 
using a noncompartmental approach in Phoenix™ WinNonlin (version 8.1). 
Primary pharmacokinetic parameters: 
Cmax and AUCt 
Secondary pharmacokinetic parameters: 
AUCinf, Tmax, Kel, and Thalf 
The selected primary pharmacokinetic variables are appropriate for a single dose bioequivalence study 
and in line with the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1).  
Pharmacokinetic software and method for PK parameters estimation are considered acceptable.  
Actual time of blood collection was considered for pharmacokinetic calculations. 
Statistical methods 
Descriptive statistics for the PK parameters of lenalidomide were calculated and included number of 
observations, arithmetic mean, standard deviation (SD), geometric mean (where applicable), 
coefficient of variation (CV), median, minimum, and maximum. 
The comparison of the pharmacokinetic parameters was carried out using PROC GLM procedure from 
SAS® (version 9.4). 
The ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters AUCt, AUCinf and Cmax parameters were subjected to 
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for lenalidomide. The significance of the sequence, period, treatment, 
and subject (sequence) effects (all fixed) was tested. All the effects were tested at the 5% level of 
significance. 
Using the same statistical model, the least-squares-means (LSMs), the differences between the 
treatments LSMs, and the corresponding standard errors of these differences were estimated for log-
transformed AUCt, AUCinf, and Cmax parameters. 
Based on log-transformed data, ratios of the geometric means for treatments and the corresponding 
90% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for AUCt and Cmax. 
The statistics are described adequately, and the methods are acceptable. The criteria for concluding 
bioequivalence for lenalidomide was adequate. Protocol deviations/violations were not reported with 
regards the statistical analysis of the study.

Based on the statistical analysis submitted by the applicant the test product is equivalent to the 
reference with respect to the extent and rate of absorption/exposure as the 90% confidence intervals 
for the ln-transformed Cmax and AUCt are within the acceptance range of 80.00 – 120.00%. 
The extrapolated AUC is not higher than 20% for any single subject. 
.  
The individual plasma time-concentration curves for each subject have been presented. 
In conclusion, bioequivalence with respect to the rate and extent of absorption of lenalidomide has 
been shown for the 25 mg strength between test and reference product under fasting condition. 
Safety data 
Ten (10) subjects reported 15 AEs. Five (5) subjects receiving treatment A reported 6 AEs, and 5 
subjects receiving treatment B reported 9 AEs. Of these, 9 AEs affecting 6 subjects were deemed to be 
possibly related to the study drugs. 
The most prevalent treatment related AEs were headache (2 events affecting 2 subjects and 
somnolence (2 events affecting 2 subjects). One (1) subject reported one episode of diarrhoea 
approximately 2 hours following treatment A dosing.  
All AEs were mild in severity and resolved prior to the end of the study. No SAEs were reported during 
the conduct of this study. None of the AEs had a significant impact on the safety of the subjects or on 
the integrity of the study results.  
There were no clinically significant changes in the clinical laboratory measurements over the course of 
the study which could be reasonably associated with the formulations under investigation.  
Data from this study demonstrated that the test and the reference products were well tolerated by 
healthy subjects, as a single dose (1 x 25 mg capsule) administration. None of the AEs had a 
significant impact on the safety of the subjects. No new safety concerns related to the administered 
formulations were noted during the conduct of the study. 
Sponsor Study Number: 19-641 Study title: A Single-Dose, Bioequivalence Study of Two 
Formulations of Lenalidomide 5 mg Capsules, Hard under Fasting Conditions. 
Methods 
Study design  
This was an open-label, single-dose, randomized, two-period, two-treatment, two-sequence, 
crossover, study, designed to evaluate the bioequivalence of lenalidomide in healthy, non-smoking, 
male subjects under fasted conditions, with a washout period of 7 days between the successive dosing 
days. In each period, subjects were administered a single, oral dose of the test or reference product, in 
accordance with the randomization scheme, after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours. 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the bioequivalence between Lenalidomide 5 mg 
capsules, hard and Revlimid 5 mg hard capsules (lenalidomide) after a single dose in healthy subjects 
administered under fasted conditions. 
The secondary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the study 
treatments.

Summary of study information 
The protocol was approved by the institutional review board (IRB), the Ethics Review Board of 
Optimum Clinical Research Inc. prior to initiating the study. 
The study was conducted at the second lowest strength (i.e., 5 mg for lenalidomide) and under fasting 
conditions, which reflects recommendations in the reference product’s summary of product 
characteristics for the administration of the product irrespective of mealtimes. Such a study design is 
in line with the Lenalidomide Product-specific Bioequivalence Guidance EMA/CHMP/177335/2016/Corr).  
The  study  was  initiated  with  42  healthy  adult  male  subjects  in  accordance  with  the  protocol.  Each 
subjects  received  one  tablet  of  either  a  single,  oral  dose  of  5  mg  (1  ×  5  mg)  of  the  test  product, 
lenalidomide capsules, 5 mg or a single oral dose of 5 mg (1 × 5 mg) of the reference product, Revlimid 
capsules 5 mg randomly with 240 mL of drinking water on the day of dosing as per the randomization 
schedule under fasting conditions in each period of the study. Dosing occurred following an overnight 
fast of at least 10 hours. There was a 7-day washout period between dosing times for the two treatment 
periods, which is considered adequate as lenalidomide has an elimination half-life of 3-5 hours (about 3 
hours in the actual study). Pre-dose levels were not observed in any subjects.  
In each study period, blood samples were collected within 60 minutes prior to dose administration (0 
hour) and at intervals over 14.00 hours after administration of dose, totalling 19 samples in each period. 
The sampling period was sufficient to characterize the plasma concentration-time profile. Blood sampling 
points are appropriate to allow an accurate measurement of Tmax.  
The  quantification  of  Lenalidomide  in  plasma  was  performed  using  ultra  high-performance  liquid 
chromatography with tandem mass spectroscopy.

Population(s) studied 
As per the protocol, 42 non-smoker, healthy, adult, male volunteers 18 to 55 years of age, having a 
Body Mass Index (BMI) between ≥19.0 and ≤30.0 kg/m2 and with normal clinical and laboratory 
results. The population chosen was according to the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1). Inclusion and exclusion criteria were acceptable and performed 
according to the protocol requirements. All the subjects were dosed as per the randomization. 
Out of the dosed 42 subjects, 39 subjects completed the study. Three subjects discontinued during 
period 1 or at period 2 check-in. The reason of the withdrawal was acceptable. In response to the 
D120 LoQ, the applicant has documented withdrawal of those subjects by presenting the Case Report 
Forms (CRFs).  
A total of 39 subjects were included in the pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis. The safety 
assessment includes information for all 42 subjects who were dosed at least once during this study. 
Analytical methods 
Pre-study and in-study validations were performed according to the requirements of the EMA Guideline 
on bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/09).  
Statement on GLP compliance is provided. 
In-study validation (study 19-641)  
The sample analysis was performed according to Bioanalytical Sample Analysis Plan.  
The plasma samples of subjects were analysed using a validated achiral, liquid chromatographic tandem 
mass  spectrometric  detection  (LC-MS/MS)  method.  The  method  involved  a  liquid-liquid  extraction. 
Certificates of analysis for reference and internal standard were included in the dossier. 
All personnel from the Bioanalytical Facility were blinded regarding the study randomization code and 
treatment plan. 
Long-term storage stability was established 
Details of subject samples: 
96 check-in plasma samples from 48 tentative subjects, and plasma samples from 42 dosed subjects. 
During transfer to the bioanalytical centre, the samples were kept in a box containing adequate amount 
of dry ice. All the received samples were transferred to the freezer at the bioanalytical facility.  
Calibration curve standards and quality control samples met the acceptance criteria for all the runs 
used for the final data, demonstrating satisfactory performance of the method during the analysis of 
study subject samples.  
Repeat samples 
One subject sample from was repeated to confirm the presence of peak in the pre-dose sample in 
accordance with SOP LAB105.14.

Incurred Sample Reanalysis (ISR) 
One hundred and thirty one (131) study samples, were re-assayed as ISR. ISR was performed with 
more than 5 % of the samples as requested by the guideline for total number samples exceeding 1000 
samples. The ISR assay complied with the acceptance criteria as all samples (100%) were within the 
acceptance criteria (±20%) indicating that the analysis is robust. 
Twenty percent of the subject’s chromatograms are presented in this report.  
Pre-study validation (study 19-641) 
A liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometric detection (LC-MS/MS) method for the 
determination of lenalidomide in human plasma has been developed and validated. The method 
involved a liquid-liquid extraction. Adequate Certificates of analysis of the analyte and the internal 
standard are provided for each version of the Method validation report. 
The method validation report provides results pertaining to selectivity, matrix effect, matrix factor, 
hemolyzed and lipemic plasma experiments, specificity (concomitant medication and hormonal 
contraceptives interference), injection carryover, recovery, intra and inter-day precision and accuracy, 
dilution integrity, linearity, stability, evaluation in the presence of concomitant medications and 
hormonal contraceptives as well as batch size determination. The method met the acceptance criteria 
for all the validation parameters evaluated, demonstrating acceptable performance. In addition, no 
significant degradation of Lenalidomide was observed under different storage conditions. 
The LLOQ was sensitive enough to detect levels of 5% of the minimum Cmax to exclude the possibility 
of a relevant carry-over effect. 
The co-administered drugs and hormonal contraceptives did not show any significant interference. It 
can be concluded that the quantification method is selective for the analysis of Lenalidomide in 
presence of the above mentioned co-administered drugs and hormonal contraceptives.  
The possible back conversion of metabolites to Lenalidomide was evaluated at the stage of 
bioanalytical method validation. It can be concluded that there was no back-conversion. 
It was demonstrated that the method has acceptable selectivity and specificity and is able to 
accurately quantify concentrations of Lenalidomide in human plasma. 
The long-term stability data of Lenalidomide stored human plasma at -25°C ± 10°C was 
demonstrated. 
Pharmacokinetic variables

Pharmacokinetic software and method for PK parameters estimation are considered acceptable.  
Actual time of blood collection was considered for pharmacokinetic calculations. 
Statistical methods 
Descriptive statistics for the PK parameters of lenalidomide were calculated and included number of 
observations, arithmetic mean, standard deviation (SD), geometric mean (where applicable), 
coefficient of variation (CV), median, minimum, and maximum. 
The comparison of the pharmacokinetic parameters was carried out using PROC GLM procedure from 
SAS® (version 9.4). 
The ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters AUCt, AUCinf, and Cmax parameters were subjected to 
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for lenalidomide. The significance of the sequence, period, treatment, 
and subject (sequence) effects (all fixed) was tested. All the effects were tested at the 5% level of 
significance. 
Using the same statistical model, the least-squares-means (LSMs), the differences between the 
treatments LSMs, and the corresponding standard errors of these differences were estimated for log-
transformed AUCt, AUCinf, and Cmax parameters. 
Based on log-transformed data, ratios of the geometric means for treatments and the corresponding 
90% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for AUCt, AUCinf, and Cmax. 
The statistics are described adequately, and the methods are acceptable. The criteria for concluding 
bioequivalence for lenalidomide was adequate. Protocol deviations/violations were not reported with 
regards the statistical analysis of the study.

Tmax was not observed in any of the subjects in the first sample time point. No pre-dose concentration 
has been detected. 
The extrapolated AUC is not higher than 20% for any single subject. 
No subject received concomitant medication during this study. The subject No. received medication 
after he withdrawn from the study. 
Based on the statistical analysis submitted by the applicant the test product is equivalent to the 
reference with respect to the extent and rate of absorption/exposure as the 90% confidence intervals 
for the ln-transformed Cmax, AUC0-∞ and AUC0-t are within the acceptance range of 80.00 – 120.00%. 
In conclusion, bioequivalence with respect to the rate and extent of absorption of lenalidomide has 
been shown for the 5 mg strength between test and reference product under fasting condition. 
Safety data 
No SAEs were reported during the conduct of this study.  
Six (6) subjects reported a total of 6 TEAEs, all of which were considered mild in severity and resolved 
by the end of the study without intervention. One (1) subject receiving treatment A reported 
hypotension in period 1, and 5 subjects receiving treatment B reported 5 TEAEs. Of these, 4 TEAEs 
affecting 4 subjects were deemed to be possibly related to the study drugs.

One (1) subject was dismissed from the study due to a TEAE (neutrophil count decreased) which was 
mild in severity, possibly related to the IMP, and resolved upon repeated measurement.  
None of the AEs had a significant impact on the safety of the subjects or on the integrity of the study 
results 
There were no serious AEs during the conduct of the study. Data from this study demonstrated that 
the test and the reference products were well tolerated by healthy subjects, as a single dose (1 x 5 mg 
capsule) administered administration. None of the AEs had a significant impact on the safety of the 
subjects. No new safety concerns related to the administered formulations were noted during the 
conduct of the study. 
Conclusions 
Based  on  the  presented  bioequivalence  studies  Lenalidomide  Krka  is  considered  bioequivalent  with 
Revlimid.  
The results of studies 18-615 and 19-641 with 25 mg and 5 mg formulations can be extrapolated to 
other strengths 2.5, 7.5, 10, 15, 20 mg using the bracketing approach according to conditions in the 
Guidelines. 
 Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this 
application.  
 Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
 Discussion on clinical aspects 
This application concerns a centralised procedure for the Lenalidomide Krka 2.5mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 
mg, 15 mg, 20 mg & 25 mg hard capsules with lenalidomide hydrochloride monohydrate as active 
substance. Essential similarity is claimed to Revlimid 2.5mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg & 25 
mg hard capsules containing lenalidomide base, Celgene Europe BV approved via centralised procedure 
on 14 June 2007 (MAA No: EU/1/07/391/001-014). 
Lenalidomide is a well-known active substance with established efficacy and tolerability. 
A clinical overview has been provided, which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. 
The overview justifies why there is no need to generate additional clinical data. 
To support this application, the applicant has conducted two bioequivalence studies (study 18-615 and 
study 19-641) in 2019, one with 5 mg strength and one with the 25 mg strength. The 25 mg strength 
is listed in the EMA Product-specific Guidance for Lenalidomide (EMA/CHMP/177335/2016/Corr.) as being 
the  highest  strength  to  be  used  for  a  drug  with  linear  pharmacokinetics  with  limited  information  on 
solubility available. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/3806/2021 
Page 32/48  
 
 
 
 
 
For the other strengths (2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg), the applicant requested a bio-waiver 
according  to  lenalidomide  product-specific  guidance  (EMA/CHMP/177335/2016/Corr.),  which  is 
acceptable as all biowaiver criteria were fulfilled. 
In addition, the applicant used a bracketing approach for the waiving of additional bioequivalence studies 
on  the  7.5  mg  and  10  mg  strengths  as  the  compositions  of  both  strengths  is  not  quantitatively 
proportional in composition to other strengths (2.5 mg, 5 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg and 25 mg). This approach 
is in accordance with the requirements stated in the Guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence. As 
two bioequivalence studies with 5 mg and 25 mg strengths are considered the extremes, the bracketing 
approach  for  the  waiving  of  additional  bioequivalence  study  on  the  7.5  mg  and  10  mg  strengths  is 
considered valid in this situation. 
Both studies (study 18-615 and study 19-641) were designed as randomized, open-label, single-dose, 
two-period, two-treatment, two-sequence, crossover study to evaluate the bioequivalence of the test 
Lenalidomide Krka 5 mg and 25 mg hard capsule (containing 5 mg and 25 mg of Lenalidomide 
hydrochloride monohydrate) with the reference Revlimid 5 mg and 25 mg hard capsule (containing 5 
mg and 25 mg of Lenalidomide) of Celgene Europe Limited, in healthy, adult, non-smoking, male 
subjects under fasted conditions, with a washout period of 7 days between the successive dosing days.  
The study design, study population, selection of PK parameters, determination of sample size, statistical 
evaluation of the PK parameters as well as the acceptance ranges for bioequivalence are in accordance 
with 
the 
requirements 
of 
the 
Lenalidomide  product-specific  bioequivalence  guidance 
(EMA/CHMP/177335/2016)  and  with  the  bioequivalence  guideline  (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98  Rev.1 
Cor**). Withdrawal of subjects in both studies was documented by presenting the Case Report Forms 
(CRF) of these subjects.  
The choice of the reference product in both studies (study 18-615 and study 19-641) has been 
justified. 
The Analytical method (liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometric method) used for the 
determination of lenalidomide in human plasma for both studies (study 18-615 and study 19-641) has 
been adequately validated. Pre-study and in-study validations were performed according to the 
requirements of the EMA Guideline on bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/09).  
The pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUCt, AUCinf (primary pharmacokinetic parameters) as well as 
Tmax, Kel, Thalf (secondary pharmacokinetic parameters) estimated for lenalidomide for both studies 
(study 18-615 and study 19-641) were computed using a noncompartmental approach in Phoenix™ 
WinNonlin (version 8.1). 
The comparison of the pharmacokinetic parameters for both studies (study 18-615 and study 19-641) 
was carried out using PROC GLM procedure from SAS (version 9.4). 
The ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters AUCt, AUCinf, and Cmax parameters were subjected to 
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for lenalidomide. The significance of the sequence, period, treatment, 
and subject (sequence) effects (all fixed) was tested. All the effects were tested at the 5% level of 
significance. 
The results of study 18-615 showed that the ratios of the geometric least square mean of ln-transformed 
data (test/reference) for AUCtnf and Cmax were within the acceptable BE range (80.00%-125.00%). The 
absence of ANOVA analysis for AUCinf of lenalidomide is acceptable.   
The results of study 19-641 showed that the ratios of the geometric least square mean of ln-transformed 
data (test/reference) for AUCt, AUCinf and Cmax were within the acceptable BE range (80.00%-125.00%).

For study 18-615, a significant subject (sequence) and treatment effects have been detected for AUCt, 
AUCinf and Cmax. The applicant has not provided any discussion concerning the statistical significance of 
formulation/treatment and subject (sequence) effects shown in the relevant ANOVA tables. However, 
significance of these factors is irrelevant, no question is raised. 
Safety evaluation performed for both studies (study 18-615 and study 19-641) demonstrated that the 
test  and  the  reference  products  were  well  tolerated  by  healthy  subjects,  as  a  single  dose  (1  x  5  mg 
capsule) or (1 x 25 mg capsule) administration. None of the AEs had a significant impact on the safety 
of the subjects. No new safety concerns related to the administered formulations were noted during the 
conduct of the study. 
Biowaiver of Strengths 
In view of dissolution data, linear pharmacokinetics, a biowaiver is supported for the other strengths 
applied for, 2.5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg. The conclusion of the bioequivalence studies 
(study 18-616 and study 19-641) with the Lenalidomide Krka 5 mg and 25 mg strengths can be 
extrapolated to the lower strengths of 2.5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg. 
 Conclusions on clinical aspects 
A summary of the literature with regard to clinical data of Lenalidomide Krka and justifications that the 
different salt of the active substance does not differ significantly in properties with regards to safety 
and efficacy of the reference product was provided and was accepted by the CHMP. This is in 
accordance with the relevant guideline and additional clinical studies were considered necessary. 
Based  on  the  results  obtained  in  the  bioequivalence  studies  (study  18-616  and  study  19-641)the 
Lenalidomide  5  mg  and  25  mg  strengths  can  be  considered  bioequivalent  with  the originator  product 
Revlimid 5 mg and 25 mg strengths (Celgene Europe Limited, UK), respectively. 
As those two bioequivalence studies with 5 mg and 25 mg strengths are considered the extremes, the 
bracketing  approach  for  the  waiving  of  additional  bioequivalence  study  on  the  7.5  mg  and  10  mg 
strengths  is  considered  acceptable.  The  results  of  the  study  18-615  with  the  25  mg  strength  can  be 
extrapolated to the strengths 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 and the results of study 19-641 with the 5 
mg strength can be extrapolated to the strengths 2.5 mg, as the biowaiver of additional strength criteria 
are fulfilled according to the requirements specified in section 4.1.6 of the Guideline on the investigation 
of bioequivalence.

 Product information 
 User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Krka d.d 200/245mg film coated 
tablets package information leaflet for visual presentation and Revlimid 2.5mg, 5mg, 7.5mg, 10mg, 
15mg, 20mg, 25mg hard capsules package information leaflet for content. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of lenalidomide hydrochloride monohydrate hard capsules. 
The reference product Revlimid is indicated for:  
Multiple myeloma 
Lenalidomide Krka as monotherapy is indicated for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with 
newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who have undergone autologous stem cell transplantation. 
Lenalidomide Krka as combination therapy with dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone, 
or melphalan and prednisone (see section 4.2) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for transplant. 
Lenalidomide Krka. in combination with dexamethasone is indicated for the treatment of multiple 
myeloma in adult patients who have received at least one prior therapy. 
Follicular lymphoma 
Lenalidomide Krka. in combination with rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody) is indicated for the treatment 
of adult patients with previously treated follicular lymphoma (Grade 1 – 3a). 
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the 
available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. 
From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical 
overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered 
sufficient. 
The bioequivalence studies form the pivotal basis with a randomised, two-period, two-treatment 
Assessment report

crossover design. The study design was considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this 
formulation and was in line with the respective European requirements. Choice of dose, sampling 
points, overall sampling time as well as wash-out period were adequate. The analytical method was 
validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of Lenalidomide Krka. met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when 
compared with the Revlimid. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the 
parameters AUC0-t and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of 80.00 
to 125.00%. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Lenalidomide Krka is favourable in the following indications: 
Multiple myeloma 
Lenalidomide Krka as monotherapy is indicated for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with 
newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who have undergone autologous stem cell transplantation. 
Lenalidomide Krka as combination therapy with dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone, 
or melphalan and prednisone (see section 4.2) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for transplant. 
Lenalidomide Krka in combination with dexamethasone is indicated for the treatment of multiple 
myeloma in adult patients who have received at least one prior therapy. 
Follicular lymphoma 
Lenalidomide Krka in combination with rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody) is indicated for the treatment of 
adult patients with previously treated follicular lymphoma (Grade 1 – 3a).

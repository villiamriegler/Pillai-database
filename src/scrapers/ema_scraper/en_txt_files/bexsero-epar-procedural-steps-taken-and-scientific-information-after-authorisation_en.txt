Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC to include the

Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC to update the

The Package leaflet is updated accordingly. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make 
some editorial changes in the product information 
and Annex A and also to update the list of local

Bexsero is removed from the additional monitoring 
Labelling and 
and immunogenicity in infants (3 months to 5 months): 
PL 
The posology for infants (age at first dose 3 months to 5 
months) is two doses each of 0.5 ml for primary 
immunisation, the interval between primary doses is not 
less than 2 months. The booster is one dose between 12 
and 15 months of age with an interval of at least 6 months 
between the primary series and booster dose.  
The immunogenicity after two primary doses (at 3 and a 
half and 5 months of age) or three primary doses (at 2 and 
a half, 3 and a half and 5 months of age) of Bexsero 
followed by a booster dose in infants starting vaccination 
between 2 and 5 months of age has been evaluated in an 
additional phase 3 clinical study. The percentages of 
seropositive subjects (i.e. achieving an hSBA of at least 
1:4) ranged from 44% to 100% one month after the 
second dose and from 55% to 100% one month after the

third dose. At one month following a booster administered 
6 months after the last dose, the percentages of 
seropositive subjects ranged from 87% to 100% for the 
two-dose schedule, and from 83% to 100% for the three-
dose schedule. 
Antibody persistence was evaluated in an extension study 
in children 3 to 4 years of age. Comparable percentages of 
subjects were seropositive at 2 to 3 years after being 
previously vaccinated with either two doses followed by a 
booster of Bexsero (ranging from 35% to 91%) or three 
doses followed by a booster (ranging from 36% to 84%). 
In the same study the response to an additional dose 
administered 2 to 3 years after the booster was indicative 
of immunological memory as shown by a robust antibody 
response against all Bexsero antigens, ranging from 81% 
to 100% and from 70% to 99%, respectively. These 
observations are consistent with adequate priming in 
infancy with both a two-dose and a three-dose primary 
series followed by a booster of Bexsero. 
Posology and immunogenicity in children (2 years to 10 
years): 
The interval between primary doses for children (2 years to 
10 years) is decreased to 1 month. 
The immunogenicity after two doses of Bexsero 
administered either one or two months apart in children 2 
to 10 years of age has been evaluated in two phase 3 
clinical studies. In the first study, participants received two 
doses of Bexsero two months apart. The seroresponse 
rates and hSBA GMTs were high after the two-dose 
schedule in children against each of the vaccine antigens. 
High percentages of subjects were seropositive in the

antibody persistence following vaccination in adolescents 
with Bexsero. The immunogenicity results, are considered 
as expected, i.e. following a peak response at 1 month 
following vaccination the antibody levels decline but remain 
elevated compared to baseline and the control group levels. 
No relevant safety data was collected in the study as this 
study only consisted of a blood draw. The data from study 
V72P10E1 support a positive benefit-risk balance for 
Bexsero.

antibodies during the second year of life in subjects who 
received their first priming dose within the first six months 
of life, especially when the 2, 3, 4 month priming schedule 
is used. The data provided indicate that there are no 
significant changes if the booster dose is given between 12 
and 15 months and this allows some flexibility in the 
vaccination schedule. Based on the results of these studies, 
the CHMP recommends for infants receiving their first 
priming dose within the first six months of life to give the 
booster dose as early as possible, between 12 and 15 
months, and to include a note informing that the booster 
dose should not be given later than 24 months.

The MAH provided results from a phase-3, multicentre, 
to evaluate the effect of Menveo and Bexsero on 
pharyngeal carriage of N. meningitidis in young 
adults (study V72_29). This study has been 
conducted as a post-authorisation measure required 
in the Risk Management Plan. Section 4.8 of the 
SmPC is updated with information on the increased 
safety database. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
observer-blind randomized trial that enrolled university 
students of 18 to 24 years of age in the UK and 
investigated the effect of Menveo and Bexsero on 
pharyngeal carriage of N. meningitidis. While in this study 
the primary objectives were not achieved and the overall 
impact on carriage was small, it is agreed that even a small 
reduction on carriage could contribute to herd immunity, 
though demonstration of that would require further data. 
Based on experience with other bacterial vaccines the 
CHMP concluded that it is likely that very high levels of 
antibodies are needed to protect against mucosal 
colonisation, compared to levels needed to protect against 
invasive disease. Therefore, the CHMP concluded that the 
current results do not negatively influence the benefit risk 
balance of Bexsero.

The MAH provided updated integrated safety analysis that 
following integration of results from several new 
II, Labelling 
included data from 7802 patients. Based on this data, the 
studies into the safety database, as requested by the 
and PL 
MAH proposed to update frequency information for adverse 
CHMP. In particular, the frequency of rash has been 
differentiated by age groups, the frequency of 
urticaria has been updated and the information on 
the risk of fever has been expanded. The PL has 
been updated in accordance. In addition, the SmPC, 
Annex II, Labelling and PL have been aligned with 
the latest QRD template version 9.0, list of local 
representatives in the PL has been updated, and the 
Labelling has been corrected to properly reflect all 
approved presentations. Minor corrections are made 
also in Annex A.

of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-

events of rash and urticaria, which was accepted by the 
CHMP. In addition, the CHMP requested to include more 
detailed description of the increased risk of fever if Bexsero 
is administered together with routine vaccines (69% to 
79% of subjects experienced fever ≥ 38°C when Bexsero 
was co administered with routine vaccines compared with 
44% to 59% of subjects receiving the routine vaccines 
alone).

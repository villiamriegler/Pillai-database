2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Patients were administered nilotinib 230 mg/m2 bid, administered hard capsules in dosage strengths of 
50 mg, 150 mg and 200 mg.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
CAMN107A2120,  “A  multi-center,  open-label,  pharmacokinetic  study  of  oral  nilotinib  in  paediatric 
patients  with  newly  diagnosed  chronic  phase  (CP)  Ph+  CML,  with  CP  or  accelerated  phase  (AP)  Ph+ 
CML resistant/intolerant to imatinib and/or dasatinib, or with refractory/relapsed Ph+ ALL”. 
At  present  Tasigna  (nilotinib)  is  indicated  in  the  European  Union  (EU)  for  the  treatment  of  adult 
patients with: 
• 
• 
newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in the 
chronic phase,  
chronic phase and accelerated phase Philadelphia chromosome positive CML with resistance or 
intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib. 
Nilotinib is administered orally and is available as hard capsule in dosage strengths of 150 mg and 200 
mg. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study CAMN107A2120 
CAMN107A2120,  “A  multi-center,  open-label,  pharmacokinetic  study  of  oral  nilotinib  in  paediatric 
patients  with  newly  diagnosed  chronic  phase  (CP)  Ph+  CML,  with  CP  or  accelerated  phase  (AP)  Ph+ 
CML resistant/intolerant to imatinib and/or dasatinib, or with refractory/relapsed Ph+ ALL”. 
Description 
Methods 
Objective 
The  primary  objective  of  the  multi-center,  open-label  phase  I  [Study  CAMN107A2120]  was  to 
characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of nilotinib in paediatric patients with newly diagnosed CP-Ph+ 
CML, or CP or AP-Ph+ CML resistant/intolerant to imatinib and/or dasatinib, or relapsed/refractory Ph+ 
ALL (acute lymphoblastic leukemia) treated at the proposed dose of 230 mg/m2 twice daily (bid). The 
dose  of  230  mg/m2  bid  in  this  population  was  based  on  the  adult  recommended  dose  (400  mg  bid) 
scaled to body surface area (BSA). 
The secondary objectives included the assessment of safety and activity (hematologic, cytogenetic and 
molecular responses) of nilotinib in paediatric patients. 
Study design 
Study  CAMN107A2120  was  a  multi-center,  open-label  study  to  characterize  the  PK  of  nilotinib  in  the 
study population administered as 230 mg/m2 bid to paediatric patients.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

Study population /Sample size 
The planned study population was 14 paediatric patients (maximum of 24 patients): 7 patients ages 1 
year  to  <  10  years  (Group  1)  and  7  patients  ages ≥   10  years  to  <  18  years  (Group  2)  with 
imatinib/dasatinib resistant/intolerant Ph+ CML in CP or AP, or Ph+ ALL refractory/relapsed to standard 
therapy.  The  analyzed  study  population  included  15  paediatric  patients:  8  patients  (7  were  PK-
evaluable) ages 1 year to < 10 years (Group 1) and 7 patients ages ≥ 10 years to < 18 years (Group 
2). 
Treatments 
Patients were administered nilotinib 230 mg/m2 bid (except for Cycle 1 Day1 in which a daily dose was 
administered),  orally,  rounded  to  the  nearest  50  mg  (maximum  single  dose  400  mg)  for  28  days  (1 
cycle) for up to 12 cycles prior to protocol amendment 3 and up to 24 cycles post amendment 3. Upon 
completion of a minimum of 12 cycles (28 days per cycle) of treatment, patients who were benefiting 
from the treatment with nilotinib, as determined by the Investigator, were offered the option to receive 
extended therapy with nilotinib. 
The selection of dose was based on the following: 
The approved adult dose of nilotinib for the treatment of imatinib resistant / intolerant Ph+ CML in CP 
or  AP  is  400  mg  bid.  The  equivalent  dose,  based  on  an  average  BSA  of  1.73  m2  in  adults,  is  230 
mg/m2  bid,  which  was  the  dose  investigated  in  this  study.  Additional  reasons  for  the  use  of  230 
mg/m2 bid include: 
• 
• 
• 
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of nilotinib was determined to be 600 mg bid (equivalent 
to approximately 350 mg/m2), and the proposed 230 mg/m2 bid dose for paediatric patients is 
below this MTD. 
It  is  desirable  to  achieve  the  same  exposure  in  paediatric  patients  as  in  adult  patients, 
considering  similar  pathology  of  the  disease  and  expression  of  BCR-ABL  oncoprotein  in  both 
adult and paediatric patients. 
The use of 400 mg bid in adults and either 300 mg bid or 400 mg bid in a limited number of 
paediatric patients in the Compassionate Use Program revealed a favorable safety profile.  
On  Day  1,  only  a  single  230  mg/m2  dose  of  nilotinib  was  administered  in  the  morning  in  order  to 
obtain the full PK profile over 24 hours. 
Statistical Methods 
Full analysis set (FAS): consists of all patients who passed the screening and are enrolled into the 
study. Patients may or may not have taken study drug. The FAS is used for all demographic and 
baseline characteristics, unless otherwise specified. 
Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set (PAS): consists of all patients who received the nilotinib dose on Day 
1, had an evaluable Day 1 PK profile or provided at least one evaluable steady state trough 
concentration. The PK set was used for all the concentration summaries and plots, and all the PK 
parameter summaries and analyses unless otherwise specified. 
Safety set: consists of all patients who received at least one dose of nilotinib. The Safety set was used 
for all core safety summaries and all Section 14 listings, unless otherwise specified.

Fifteen patients in two age groups were enrolled in the study (Group 1: ages 1 year to < 10 years: 8 
patients; Group 2: ages ≥ 10 years to < 18 years: 7 patients). 
Overall, 7 (7/15, 46.7%) patients completed treatment as per protocol (Group 1: 5 (62.5%) patients; 
Group  2:  2  (28.6%)  patients).  The  primary  reason  for  treatment  discontinuation  was  new  cancer 
therapy  in  6  (40%)  patients  (Group  1:  3  (37.5%)  patients;  Group  2:  3  (42.9%)  patients).  Of  note, 
among the 6 patients with new cancer therapy, 1 patient with Ph+ ALL had a CRp and then had a stem 
cell  transplant  with  subsequent  treatment  with  chimeric  antigen  receptor,  and  five  patients  with  CML 
were  considered  to  have  an  inadequate  response,  four  of  whom  went  onto  stem  cell  transplant,  and 
the  fifth  patient,  was  switched  to  dasatinib.  Additionally,  1  (14.3%)  patient  in  Group  2  discontinued 
treatment due to an AE and disease progression. 
Data sets analyzed 
The data analysis sets are shown in Table 11-1: 
• 
• 
FAS: all eligible patients enrolled in the study. Patients may or may not have taken study drug. 
PAS: all patients who received the nilotinib dose on Day 1, had an evaluable Day 1 PK profile 
or provided at least one steady-state trough concentration. 
•  Safety set: all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. 
The FAS was used for all efficacy analyses, demographic and baseline characteristics, and listings. The 
safety  set  was  used  for  safety  analysis.  Of  note,  in  this  study,  because  all  enrolled  patients  actually 
received study medication, the FAS and safety sets are identical and include all patients. The PAS was 
used for the PK analysis. One patient in Group 1: ages 1 year to < 10 years had PK samples collected 
that were deemed not evaluable due to a storage temperature excursion at the investigative site.

Overall,  11  Ph+  CML  patients  had  a  median  time  since  initial  diagnosis  of  Ph+  CML  of  25.30  months 
with a range from 3.7 to 84.9 months. Four Ph+ ALL patients had a median time since initial diagnosis 
of Ph+ ALL of 37.90 months with a range from 14.8 to 46 months. 
In  Group  1,  the  median  time  since  initial  diagnosis  of  Ph+  CML  was  45.2  months  with  a  range  from 
11.4 to 84.9 months. The median time since initial diagnosis of Ph+ ALL was 42.7 months with a range 
from 33.1 to 46 months. 
In  Group  2,  time  since  the  initial  diagnosis  of  disease  was  much  more  recent  than  time  reported  in 
Group 1. The median time since initial diagnosis of Ph+ CML was 22.9 months.  
The time since initial diagnosis of Ph+ ALL was 14.8 months for the 1 patient in Group 2. 
Prior antineoplastic therapy 
All 15 patients had a prior regimen of at least one antineoplastic medication. Additionally, of the 8 
patients in Group 1, 1 (12.5%) patient had prior radiotherapy, and of 7 patients in Group 2, only 3 
(42.9%) patients had prior surgery (i.e. stem cell transplantation). 
Pharmacokinetic results 
The  full  PK  profiles  of  nilotinib  in  paediatric  patients  were  assessed  using  serial  sampling  following  a 
single  230  mg/m2  dose  on  Cycle  1  Day  1.  The  steady-state  PK  of  nilotinib  in paediatric  patients  was 
evaluated  with  the  trough  concentrations  obtained  on  Cycle  1  Day  8,  15,  22,  and  28  following  the 
administration of 230 mg/m2 bid. 
The PK exposure of nilotinib following the single dose appeared to be comparable between Group 1 (1 
year  to  <  10  years)  and  Group  2  (≥  10  years  to  <  18  years).  The  geometric  means  of  maximum  
blood/serum  concentration  (Cmax),  AUC  from  time  zero  to  the  last  quantifiable  concentration  point 
(AUClast)  and  AUC0-12h  were  approximately  405  ng/mL,  4161  and  2796  ng*h/mL  in  Group  1,  and 
403 ng/mL, 5707 and 3393 ng*h/mL in Group 2, respectively. 
The coefficient of variation (CV; %) for the geometric means was 30% or higher in both groups (Table 
2-1).

No  marked  difference  was  observed  between  Group  1  and  2  with  regard  to  the  steady-state  PK 
exposure  and  clearance  of  nilotinib.  The  geometric  means  were  approximately  15129  and  14383 
ng*h/mL for the steady-state AUC from time zero to the end of the dosing interval (AUCtau; tau = 12 
hours), and 15.356 and 15.922 L/h/m2 for the BSA-adjusted CL/F (apparent systemic (or total body)

clearance from plasma (or serum or blood) following extravascular administration), respectively (Table 
2-2). 
Table 2-2 Summary of nilotinib steady-state PK parameters estimated from noncompart-
mental analysis (PAS) 
Steady-state  PK  parameters  were  then  compared  with  reference  data  obtained  in  adult  patients  in 
[Study  CAMN107A2101].  The  reference  data  used  from  the  adult  study  consisted  of  all  patients  who 
received 400 mg bid, and had valid steady state PK parameters on Cycle 1 Day 15. The steady-state 
PK  exposure  and  clearance  of  nilotinib  in  the  paediatric  patients  administered  230  mg/m2  bid  were 
similar  (within  2-fold)  to  those  observed  in  adult  patients  administered  400  mg  bid.  The  geometric 
mean  ratio  (90%  CI)  of  steady-state  AUC  (paediatrics  divided  by  adults)  was  0.885  (0.683,  1.145), 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

0.841  (0.650,  1.089),  and  0.863  (0.701,  1.061)  for  Group  1,  Group  2  and  all  paediatric  patients, 
respectively  (Table  2-3).  The  geometric  mean  ratio  (90%  confidence  interval  (CI))  of  BSA-adjusted 
CL/F was 1.276 (0.971, 1.677), 1.323 (1.007, 1.739), and 1.300 (1.044, 1.618) for Group 1, Group 2, 
and all paediatric patients, respectively. 
Table 2-3 Summary of geometric-mean ratio of steady-state PK parameters estimated from 
non-compartmental analysis in paediatric population compared to adult population with 
90% CI by age group (PAS) 
The PK of nilotinib was similar between 1 year to < 10 years and ≥ 10 years to < 18 years after either 
single or multiple doses. The PK results in all patients in this study dosed with nilotinib 230 mg/m2 bid 
demonstrated  that  the  AUCtau  and  BSA-adjusted  CL/F  of  nilotinib  at  steady  state  were  within  a  two-
fold range of the reference data for nilotinib 400 mg bid in adult Ph+ CML patients. This dose provided 
similar PK exposure to that of reference data for nilotinib 400 mg bid in adult Ph+ CML patients. 
Efficacy results 
Efficacy was measured through hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular responses. A summary of the 
efficacy evaluation (best calculated response status during study treatment) is shown in Table 2-4.

Table  2-4  Summary  of  best  calculated  response  status  within  response  category  during 
study treatment, by indication and age group (FAS) 
Of 11 Ph+ CML patients (5 patients in Group 1, 6 patients in Group 2), 10 (90.9%) patients achieved 
confirmed complete haematological response (CHR), and 1 patient satisfied CHR criteria which was not 
confirmed  at  another  visit  within  4  weeks.  Of  11  Ph+  CML  patients,  4  (36.4%)  patients  achieved 
complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), 2 patients in each age group (Group 1 (2, 40%); Group 2 (2, 
33.3%). One patient in Group 2 (1, 16.7%) achieved partial cytogenetic response (PCyR) and another 
1 patient (1, 16.7%) achieved minor cytogenetic response (mCyR). Major cytogenetic response (CCyR 
or PCyR) was achieved in 2 patients in Group 1 (40%) and 3 patients in Group 2 (50.0%). 
MMR  was  achieved  in  3  Ph+  CML  patients  (27.3%),  1  patient  in  Group  1  (20%)  and  2  patients  in 
Group 2 (33.3%).

Page 14/19 
 
 
 
 
 
Of the 4 Ph+ ALL patients, complete remission with platelet recovery (CR) was achieved in 3 patients 
(75%): 2 patients in Group 1 (66.7%) and 1 patient in Group 2 (100%). Stable disease was observed 
in the 1 remaining Group 1 patient (33.3%). 
Safety results 
Exposure 
For  all  15  patients,  the  median  time  on  treatment  was  10.87  months  and  similar  in  both  age  groups 
(10.96  vs  10.78  months  for  Group  1  and  Group  2,  respectively).  The  majority  (12,  80%)  of  patients 
were treated for at least 12 months. The median duration of exposure was 10.64 months and similar in 
both age groups (10.55 vs 10.78 months for Group 1 and Group 2, respectively). 
For  all  patients,  the  median  actual  dose  intensity  was  453.9  mg/m2/day  which  is  close  to  the  actual 
planned  dose.  The  median  relative  dose  intensity  was  98.68%  and  comparable  between  both  age 
groups (101.1% vs 97.86% for Group 1 and Group 2, respectively). 
Adverse events 
All 15 patients experienced at least one adverse event (AE) during the study.  
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
Page 15/19 
 
 
 
 
 
The majority (80%) of patients experienced AEs suspected to be study-drug  related. For all patients, 
the most frequently reported AEs suspected to be related to study drug were alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT)  increased  and  rash  (4  patients  each,  26.7%),  followed  by  aspartate  aminotransferase  (AST) 
increased, blood bilirubin increased, and hyperbilirubinemia (3 patients each, 20%). 
Serious adverse events 
Five  patients  (33.3%)  experienced  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  all  of  which  resolved,  7  patients 
(46.7%)  experienced  AEs  requiring  dose  interruption  and/or  modification,  and  1  patient  (6.7%) 
withdrew  due  to  multiple  AEs.  No  deaths  occurred  during  the  study.  Of  the  8  patients  in  Group  1,  2 
(25%)  patients  experienced  SAEs:  1  (12.5%)  patient  reported  appendix  disorder  and  1  (12.5%) 
patient reported influenza-like illness and pyrexia. All SAEs were considered not suspected to be study-
drug related. Of the 7 patients in Group 2, 3 (42.9%) patients experienced SAEs: 2 (28.6%) patients 
reported neutropenia (2 SAEs in 1 patient) and 1 (14.3%) patient experienced renal failure. The SAEs 
of neutropenia were considered suspected to be study-drug related. 
No deaths occurred during the study.

Adverse Events of special interest (AESI):  
No cases of Hy’s Law or potential Hy’s Law were observed. AESI requiring dose interruption occurred in 
3  patients  of  8  in  Group  1  (37.5%):  ALT  increased,  blood  bilirubin  increased,  hyperbilirubinemia  and 
hypoalbuminemia.  Of  7  patients  in  Group  2,  1  patient  experienced  a  dose  interruption  for 
thrombocytopenia (1/7, 14.3%). 
One patient of 8 in Group 1 (12.5%) had a grade 0 to grade 2 shift from baseline in lipase increased. 
No associated AEs were reported and the lipase elevation improved to normal without any intervention. 
No episodes of torsades de pointes were reported during the study. Three patients overall (20%) had a 
QTcF post-baseline increase > 30 ms (1 patient of 8 in Group 1 (12.5%) and 2 patients of 7 in Group 2 
(28.6%)).  No  patients  reported  a  QTcF  post-baseline  increase  >  60  ms.  One  patient  in  Group  2  (1, 
14.3%) had a new QTcF interval > 450 ms and no patients had a new QTcF interval > 480 ms. 
MAH’ s Discussion on clinical aspects 
The PK of nilotinib was similar between 1 year to < 10 years and ≥ 10 years to < 18 years after either 
single or multiple doses. The PK results in all patients in this study dosed with nilotinib 230 mg/m2 bid 
demonstrated  that  the  AUCtau  and  BSA-adjusted  CL/F  of  nilotinib  at  steady  state  were  within  a  two-
fold range of the reference data for nilotinib 400 mg bid in adult Ph+ CML patients. This dose provided 
similar PK exposure to that of reference data for nilotinib 400 mg bid in adult Ph+ CML patients. 
Of 11 Ph+ CML patients (5 patients in Group 1, 6 patients in Group 2), 10 (90.9%) patients achieved 
confirmed CHR, and 1 patient had CHR which was not confirmed at another visit within 4 weeks. Of 11 
Ph+ CML patients, 4 patients (36.4%) achieved CCyR, 2 patients in each age group (Group 1 (2, 0%); 
Group  2  (2,  33.3%)).  One  patient  in  Group  2  (1,  16.7%)  achieved  PCyR  and  another  1  patient  (1, 
16.7%)  achieved  mCyR.  Three  patients  in  Group  1  and  1  patient  in  Group  2  had  no  Ph+  marrow  at 
baseline. Major cytogenetic response in this study includes CCyR or PCyR. Major cytogenetic response 
was achieved in 2 patients in Group 1 (40%) and 3 patients in Group 2 (50.0%). MMR was achieved in 
3 Ph+ CML patients (27.3%) 1 patient in Group 1 (20%) and 2 patients in Group 2 (33.3%). In the 4

Ph+ ALL patients, CR was achieved in 3 patients (75%): 2 patients in Group 1(66.7%) and 1 patient in 
Group 2 (100%). Stable disease was observed in the 1 remaining patient in Group 1 (33.3%). 
The  safety  profile  of  paediatric  patients  dosed  with  nilotinib  230  mg/m2  bid  is  consistent  with  the 
already  well-known  safety  profile  of  adult  patients  treated  with  nilotinib.  There  were  some  low  grade 
shifts  in  hepatic  transaminases  as  isolated  laboratory  findings.  There  was  no  evidence  of  vascular 
morbidities. No deaths were reported. 
In  conclusion,  the  study  results  confirm  230  mg/m2  bid  as  the  recommended  dose  in  paediatric 
patients  (1  year  to  <  18  years)  with  newly  diagnosed  CP-Ph+  CML,  or  CP  or  AP-Ph+  CML 
resistant/intolerant to imatinib and/or dasatinib, or relapsed/refractory Ph+ ALL. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The MAH has provided a completed paediatric study for Tasigna (nilotinib), in accordance with Article 
46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.  
The  provided  study;  CAMN107A2120,  a  multi-center,  open-label,  pharmacokinetic  study  of  oral 
nilotinib  in  paediatric  patients  with  newly  diagnosed  chronic  phase  (CP)  Ph+  CML,  with  CP  or 
accelerated  phase  (AP)  Ph+  CML  resistant/intolerant  to  imatinib  and/or  dasatinib,  or  with 
refractory/relapsed  Ph+  ALL,  with  the  primary  objective  to  characterize  the  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  of 
nilotinib  in  paediatric  patients  with  newly  diagnosed  CP-Ph+  CML,  or  CP  or  AP-Ph+  CML 
resistant/intolerant to imatinib and/or dasatinib, or  relapsed/refractory Ph+ ALL (acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia)  along  with  secondary  objectives  of  safety  and  activity  (hematologic,  cytogenetic  and 
molecular  responses)  of  nilotinib  in  paediatric  patients,  will  be  a  part  an  upcoming  extension 
application consisting of the full relevant data package (i.e. containing several studies) and is expected 
to  be  submitted  by  12/2016.  The  preliminary  discussion  and  conclusion,  as  provided  by  the  MAH,  is 
endorsed.  As  such,  the  full  evaluation  of  whether  the  benefit/risk  of  nilotinib  in  the  paediatric 
population  in  the  treatment  of  newly  diagnosed  chronic  phase  (CP)  Ph+  CML,  with  CP  or  accelerated 
phase (AP) Ph+ CML resistant/intolerant to imatinib and/or dasatinib, or with refractory/relapsed Ph+ 
ALL, awaits the submission of the complete data package.  
The benefit/risk of the use of nilotinib in the currently approved adult population remains positive.  
X  Fulfilled: 
No further action required, however further data are expected in the context of an extension prior any 
conclusion on product information amendments is made. The MAH has informed that the application is 
expected for December 2016.

Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSURs for TOBI Podhaler, the scientific 
conclusions of PRAC are as follows:  
The  PRAC  considers  that  the  newly  available  data  on  efficacy  are  consistent  with  the  known  clinical 
efficacy and that the benefit-risk balance continues to be positive. 
During the reviewed period, 1 new case of aphonia was reported. A total of three cases are available in 
Eudravigilance.  The  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder was  requested  to  update  the  Product  Information 
to include the adverse event “aphonia”, because: 
• 
• 
cases  detailing  the  adverse  event  aphonia  with  a  time  to  onset  compatible  with  a  causal 
relationship between aphonia and TOBI Podhaler have been reported,  
aphonia  might  be  a  more  severe  form  of  dysphonia  which  is  listed  according  to  the  currently 
approved  SmPC  and  the  adverse  event  might be  related  to  the  active  substance  and  is  listed 
for tobramycin nebuliser solution  TOBI 300 mg/5 ml (UK/H/0361/001).  
Otherwise no new (potential) safety issue has been identified.  
In view of available data regarding aphonia the PRAC considered that changes to the product 
information were warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for TOBI Podhaler the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance tobramycin is favourable subject 
to the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

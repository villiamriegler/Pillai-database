is of the opinion that the quality, the safety and the efficacy 
and PL 
of this medicinal product continues to be adequately and 
sufficiently demonstrated and considers that the 
benefit/risk profile of Myocet continues to be favourable. 
The CHMP therefore recommended that a renewal can be 
granted with unlimited validity.   
With this procedure the MAH also updated the product 
information (PI). This update was made so that the PI 
would be in line with the current QRD requirements and the 
SmPC guideline.

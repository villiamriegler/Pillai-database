SmPC, Annex 
To reflect reviews mainly based on data from clinical trials 
the SmPC in order to update the safety information in 
II, Labelling 
and post-marketing experience carried out by the MAH, a 
line with the latest Company Core Safety Information 
and PL 
safety update of the Product Information for DuoTrav was 
(CCSI) document. The Package Leaflet was updated 
implemented.  
accordingly. 
Furthermore, the PI was brought in line with the latest 
QRD template version 9.0. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of 
the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-clinical, 
clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
In particular, the MAH undertook a review of the adverse 
drug reactions (ADRs) received from clinical trials and 
spontaneous post-marketing data up to December 2012. 
Nineteen clinical trials with DuoTrav Ophthalmic Solution 
(Travoprost 0.004%/Timolol 0.5% Ophthalmic Solution) 
were identified. These 19 studies included DuoTrav 
preserved with benzalkonium chloride (DuoTrav BAK) or 
DuoTrav preserved with POLYQUAD (DuoTrav PQ or APS). 
Six of these studies were included in the Initial Marketing 
Authorisation Application (completed for DuoTrav in 2006, 
on 721 patients) and thirteen additional studies were 
completed subsequently (on 1449 patients). Thus, in the 
pooled studies, a total of 2170 patients had exposure to 
DuoTrav Ophthalmic Solution. This number enabled 
calculation of adverse events frequency for a number of 
events. Additionally, 5 new terms (eye irritation, dysphonia, 
hypertrichosis, trichiasis, distichiasis) were added to the 
safety information, based on analyses of these data from 
Page 8/16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
clinical studies. 
Three new terms (palpitations, oedema peripheral, 
dysgeusia) were also added to the safety information, based 
on review of post-marketing data. 
The CHMP considered the proposals for the SmPC and the PL 
to be acceptable and overall improve the text of the 
prescribing and patient information.

Following assessment of the 3rd PSUR for DuoTrav eye 
PSUR 3, updates of sections 4.4 (Special warnings and 
precautions for use), 4.6 (Pregnancy and lactation) 
and 4.8 (Undesirable effects) of the Summary of 
Product Characteristics (SPC) and the corresponding 
changes to sections 2 and 4 of the Package Leaflet (PL) 
have been carried out. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
drops, the CHMP requested amendments to the SPC. 
Namely: 
- 
Include warnings related to benzalkonium chloride 
and corneal toxicity in section 4.4; 
- 
Include precautions statements in section 4.4 
regarding cutaneous absorption of travoprost in pregnant 
women or women attempting to become pregnant; 
- 
Reword section 4.6 to include a statement on 
harmful effects of travoprost use during pregnancy 
(consistently with safety data for travoprost-containing 
products); and

As 'asthma' has been actually reported as a 
respiratory disorder with Duotrav use, it should appear as 
such in section 4.8 (being relocated from the current section 
'adverse events that have been seen with one of the 
components and may potentially occur with DuoTrav'. 
With this variation the MAH fulfilled the above requests.  
As other adverse reactions were also reported in PSURs to 
have been observed with Duotrav, consistently with the 
relocation of 'asthma' described above, the MAH made 
further changes to section 4.8 of the SPC. A number of other 
adverse reactions were relocated within the section, as they 
were observed during DuoTrav use. Namely:   
- 
'Cardiac failure', 'cerebrovascular accident', 
'syncope', 'paraesthesia', 'alopecia', 'chest pain' and 
'depression'.  
Additionally,   
- 
'Tachycardia', for which cases were reported in the 
3rd PSUR, was included in section 4.8 of the SPC. 
- 
Section 4.8 of the SPC was modified to reflect the 
fact that the event 'iritis' had recently been reported during 
DuoTrav use. 
The corresponding changes to the PL were also implemented.

requested by the CHMP following assessment of the 
2nd PSUR. Additional minor changes to section 4.8 
have been made to reflect latest guidelines. Section 4 
PL 
recommended amendments to section 4.8 of the SPC. In 
particular, in order to make its section 4.8 as clear as 
possible to prescribers, the deletion of the following

of the Package Leaflet (PL) has been amended

travoprost, or post-marketing events reported in the SPC for 
travoprost that have not been reported with DuoTrav include

as well as the analogue paragraph applicable to timolol. 
These paragraphs were replaced with the sentence:

the components and may potentially occur with DuoTrav".  
Additionally, 'macular oedema', 'corneal disorders', 
'conjunctivitis', 'eyelid ptosis', 'rash' and 'arrhythmia' were 
moved from the sections on individual active ingredients, as 
applicable, to include them under the list of adverse reactions 
observed with DuoTrav use during post-marketing 
experience. 
The PL was updated according to the above changes.

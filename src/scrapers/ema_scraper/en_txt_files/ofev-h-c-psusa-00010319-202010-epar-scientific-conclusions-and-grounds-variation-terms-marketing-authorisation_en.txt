Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for nintedanib (respiratory indication), 
the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on thrombotic microangiopathy from the literature, spontaneous reports, and in 
view of a plausible mechanism of action and potential class effect, the PRAC considers a causal 
relationship between nintedanib and thrombotic microangiopathy could not be excluded.  
The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing nintedanib should be amended 
accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for nintedanib (respiratory indication) the CHMP is of the 
opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing nintedanib (respiratory 
indication) is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

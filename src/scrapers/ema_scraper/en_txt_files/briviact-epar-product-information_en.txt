CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Briviact is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without 
secondary generalisation in adults, adolescents and children from 2 years of age with epilepsy. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The physician should prescribe the most appropriate formulation and strength according to weight and 
dose. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The recommended posology for adults, adolescents and children from 2 years of age is summarised in 
the following table. The dose should be administered in two equally divided doses, approximately 
12 hours apart. 
Recommended starting dose 
Recommended maintenance

2.5 mg/kg/day 
1 – 5 mg/kg/day 
* Based on individual patient response, the dose may be adjusted within this effective dose range. 
** Based on physician’s assessment of need for seizure control 
Adults 
The recommended starting dose is either 50 mg/day or 100 mg/day based on physician’s assessment of 
required seizure reduction versus potential side effects. Based on individual patient response and 
tolerability, the dose may be adjusted in the effective dose range of 50 mg/day to 200 mg/day.  
Adolescents and children weighing 50 kg or more  
The recommended starting dose is 50 mg/day. Brivaracetam may also be initiated at 100 mg/day based 
on physician’s assessment of need for seizure control. The recommended maintenance dose is 
100 mg/day. Based on individual patient response, the dose may be adjusted in the effective dose 
range of 50 mg/day to 200 mg/day. 
Adolescents and children weighing from 20 kg to less than 50 kg 
The recommended starting dose is 1 mg/kg/day. Brivaracetam may also be initiated at doses up to 
2 mg/kg/day based on physician’s assessment of need for seizure control. The recommended 
maintenance dose is 2 mg/kg/day. Based on individual patient response, the dose may be adjusted in 
the effective dose range of 1 mg/kg/day to 4 mg/kg/day. 
Children weighing from 10 kg to less than 20 kg 
The recommended starting dose is 1 mg/kg/day. Brivaracetam may also be initiated at doses up to 
2.5 mg/kg/day based on physician’s assessment of need for seizure control. The recommended 
maintenance dose is 2.5 mg/kg/day. Based on individual patient response, the dose may be adjusted in 
the effective dose range of 1 mg/kg/day to 5 mg/kg/day. 
Missed doses 
If patients missed one dose or more, it is recommended that they take a single dose as soon as they 
remember and take the following dose at the usual morning or evening time. This may avoid the 
brivaracetam plasma concentration falling below the efficacy level and prevent breakthrough seizures 
from occurring. 
Discontinuation 
For patients from 16 years of age, if brivaracetam has to be discontinued, it is recommended that the 
dose is reduced gradually by 50 mg/day on a weekly basis. 
For patients below the age of 16 years, if brivaracetam has to be discontinued, it is recommended that 
the dose is reduced by a maximum of half the dose every week until a dose of 1 mg/kg/day (for 
patients with a body weight less than 50 kg) or 50 mg/day (for patients with body weight of 50 kg or 
more) is reached.  
After 1 week of treatment at 50 mg/day, a final week of treatment at the dose of 20 mg/day is 
recommended.

Special populations 
Elderly (65 years of age and above) 
No dose adjustment is needed in elderly patients (see section 5.2). 
The clinical experience in patients ≥ 65 years is limited. 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is needed in patients with impaired renal function (see section 5.2). Brivaracetam 
is not recommended in end-stage renal disease patients undergoing dialysis due to lack of data. 
Based on data in adults, no dose adjustment is necessary in paediatric patients with impaired renal 
function. No clinical data are available in paediatric patients with renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
Exposure to brivaracetam was increased in adult patients with chronic liver disease.  
In patients with hepatic impairment, the following adjusted doses, administered in 2 divided doses, 
approximately 12 hours apart, are recommended for all stages of hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 
and 5.2). No clinical data are available in paediatric patients with hepatic impairment.

Paediatric patients less than 2 years of age 
The efficacy of brivaracetam in paediatric patients aged less than 2 years has not yet been established.  
Currently available data are described in section 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 but no recommendation on a 
posology can be made. 
Method of administration  
Brivaracetam film-coated tablets must be taken orally and swallowed in whole with liquid and may be 
taken with or without food (see section 5.2). Patients not being able to swallow tablets in whole or 
patients for whom the dose can not be met with the use of whole tablets should use Briviact 10 mg/ml 
oral solution. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or other pyrrolidone derivatives or to any of the excipients 
listed in section 6.1.  
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Suicidal ideation and behaviour 
Suicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic drugs 
(AEDs), including brivaracetam, in several indications. A meta-analysis of randomized placebo-
controlled clinical studies of AEDs has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and 
behaviour. The mechanism of this risk is not known and the available data do not exclude the 
possibility of an increased risk for brivaracetam. 
Patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate treatment 
should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical advice 
should any signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge. See also section 4.8, paediatric data. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic impairment 
There are limited clinical data on the use of brivaracetam in patients with pre-existing hepatic 
impairment. Dose adjustments are recommended for patients with hepatic impairment (see section 
4.2). 
Excipients 
Lactose intolerance 
Brivaracetam film-coated tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose 
intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. 
Sodium content 
Brivaracetam film-coated tablets contain less than 1 mmol sodium (23mg) per tablet, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Formal interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
Concomitant treatment with levetiracetam 
In the clinical studies, although the numbers were limited, there was no observed benefit of 
brivaracetam versus placebo in patients taking levetiracetam concurrently. No additional safety or 
tolerability concern was observed (see section 5.1). 
Interaction with alcohol 
In a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction study between brivaracetam 200 mg single 
dose and ethanol 0.6 g/L continuous infusion in healthy subjects, there was no pharmacokinetic 
interaction, but brivaracetam approximately doubled the effect of alcohol on psychomotor function, 
attention and memory. Intake of brivaracetam with alcohol is not recommended. 
Pharmacokinetic interactions 
Effects of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of brivaracetam 
In vitro data suggest that brivaracetam has a low interaction potential. The main disposition pathway 
of brivaracetam is by CYP-independent hydrolysis. A second disposition pathway involves 
hydroxylation mediated by CYP2C19 (see section 5.2).  
Brivaracetam plasma concentrations may increase when coadministered with CYP2C19 strong 
inhibitors (e.g. fluconazole, fluvoxamine), but the risk of a clinically relevant CYP2C19-mediated 
interaction is considered to be low. Limited clinical data are available implying that coadministration 
of cannabidiol may increase the plasma exposure of brivaracetam, possibly through CYP2C19 
inhibition, but the clinical relevance is uncertain. 
Rifampicin 
In healthy subjects, coadministration with the strong enzyme inducer rifampicin (600 mg/day for 
5 days), decreased brivaracetam area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) by 
45 %. Prescribers should consider adjusting the brivaracetam dose in patients starting or ending 
treatment with rifampicin.  
Strong enzyme inducing AEDs 
Brivaracetam plasma concentrations are decreased when coadministered with strong enzyme inducing 
AEDs (carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin) but no dose adjustment is required (see table 1).  
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other enzyme inducers 
Other strong enzyme inducers (such as St John´s wort (Hypericum perforatum)) may also decrease the 
systemic exposure of brivaracetam. Therefore, starting or ending treatment with St John’s wort should 
be done with caution. 
Effects of brivaracetam on other medicinal products 
Brivaracetam given 50 or 150 mg/day did not affect the AUC of midazolam (metabolised by 
CYP3A4). The risk of clinically relevant CYP3A4 interactions is considered to be low. 
In vitro studies have shown that brivaracetam exhibits little or no inhibition of CYP450 isoforms 
except for CYP2C19. Brivaracetam may increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products 
metabolised by CYP2C19 (e.g. lanzoprazole, omeprazole, diazepam). When tested in vitro 
brivaracetam did not induce CYP1A1/2 but induced CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. No CYP3A4 induction 
was found in vivo (see midazolam above). CYP2B6 induction has not been investigated in vivo and 
brivaracetam may decrease plasma concentrations of medicinal products metabolised by CYP2B6 (e.g. 
efavirenz). In vitro interaction studies to determine the potential inhibitory effects on transporters 
concluded that there were no clinically relevant effects, except for OAT3. In vitro, Brivaracetam 
inhibits OAT3 with a half maximal inhibitory concentration 42-fold higher than the Cmax at the highest 
clinical dose. Brivaracetam 200mg/day may increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products 
transported by OAT3. 
Antiepileptic drugs 
Potential interactions between brivaracetam (50 mg/day to 200 mg/day) and other AEDs were 
investigated in a pooled analysis of plasma drug concentrations from all phase 2-3 studies, in a 
population pharmacokinetic analysis of placebo-controlled phase 2-3 clinical studies, and in dedicated 
drug-drug interaction studies (for the following AEDs: carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenytoin and 
topiramate). The effect of the interactions on the plasma concentration is summarised in table 1 
(increase is indicated as “↑” and decrease as “↓”, area under the plasma concentration versus time 
curve as “AUC”, maximum observed concentration as Cmax).

Carbamazepine  
Brivaracetam is a moderate reversible inhibitor of epoxide hydrolase resulting in an increased 
concentration of carbamazepine epoxide, an active metabolite of carbamazepine. In controlled clinical 
studies, the carbamazepine epoxide plasma concentration increased by a mean of 37 %, 62 % and 
98 % with little variability at brivaracetam doses of 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day and 200 mg/day 
respectively. No safety risks were observed. There was no additive effect of brivaracetam and 
valproate on the AUC of carbamazepine epoxide. 
Oral contraceptives 
Co-administration of brivaracetam (100 mg/day) with an oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol 
(0.03 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.15 mg) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of either substance. 
When brivaracetam was coadministered at a dose of 400 mg/day (twice the recommended maximum 
daily dose) with an oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol (0.03 mg) and levonorgestrel 
(0.15 mg), a reduction in oestrogen and progestin AUCs of 27 % and 23 %, respectively, was observed 
without impact on suppression of ovulation. There was generally no change in the concentration-time 
profiles of the endogenous markers estradiol, progesterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle 
stimulating hormone (FSH), and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential  
Physicians should discuss family planning and contraception with women of childbearing potential 
taking brivaracetam (see Pregnancy). 
If a woman decides to become pregnant, the use of brivaracetam should be carefully re-evaluated. 
Pregnancy 
Risk related to epilepsy and antiepileptic medicinal products in general 
For all anti-epileptic drugs, it has been shown that in the offspring of treated women with epilepsy, the 
prevalence of malformations is two to three times greater than the rate of approximately 3 % in the 
general population. In the treated population, an increase in malformations has been noted with 
polytherapy; however, the extent to which the treatment and/or the underlying condition is responsible 
has not been elucidated. Discontinuation of anti-epileptic treatments may result in exacerbation of the 
disease which could be harmful to the mother and the foetus. 
Risk related to brivaracetam 
There is a limited amount of data from the use of brivaracetam in pregnant women. There is no data on 
placental transfer in humans, but brivaracetam was shown to readily cross the placenta in rats (see 
section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Animal studies did not detect any teratogenic 
potential of brivaracetam (see section 5.3). 
In clinical studies, brivaracetam was used as adjunctive therapy and when it was used with 
carbamazepine, it induced a dose-related increase in the concentration of the active metabolite, 
carbamazepine-epoxide (see section 4.5). There is insufficient data to determine the clinical 
significance of this effect in pregnancy. 
As a precautionary measure, brivaracetam should not be used during pregnancy unless clinically 
necessary i.e. (if the benefit to the mother clearly outweighs the potential risk to the foetus). 
Breast-feeding 
Brivaracetam is excreted in human breast milk. A decision should be made whether to discontinue 
breastfeeding or to discontinue brivaracetam, taking into account the benefit of the medicinal product 
to the mother. In case of co-administration of brivaracetam and carbamazepine, the amount of 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
carbamazepine-epoxide excreted in breast milk could increase. There is insufficient data to determine 
the clinical significance. 
Fertility 
No human data on the effect of brivaracetam on fertility are available. In rats, there was no effect on 
fertility with brivaracetam (see section 5.3).  
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Brivaracetam has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Due to possible differences in individual sensitivity some patients might experience somnolence, 
dizziness, and other central nervous system (CNS) related symptoms. Patients should be advised not to 
drive a car or to operate other potentially hazardous machines until they are familiar with the effects of 
brivaracetam on their ability to perform such activities.  
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions (>10 %) with brivaracetam treatment were: 
somnolence (14.3 %) and dizziness (11.0 %). They were usually mild to moderate in intensity. 
Somnolence and fatigue were reported at a higher incidence with increasing dose. 
The discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 3.5 %, 3.4 % and 4.0 % for patients randomized 
to brivaracetam at respectively the dose of 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day and 200 mg/day and 1.7 % for 
patients randomized to placebo. The adverse reactions most frequently resulting in discontinuation of 
brivaracetam therapy were dizziness (0.8 %) and convulsion (0.8 %). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Neutropenia has been reported in 0.5 % (6/1099) brivaracetam patients and 0 % (0/459) placebo 
patients. Four of these subjects had decreased neutrophil counts at baseline, and experienced 
additional decrease in neutrophil counts after initiation of brivaracetam treatment. None of the 6 cases 
of neutropenia were severe, required any specific treatment or led to discontinuation of brivaracetam 
and none had associated infections. 
Suicidal ideation has been reported in 0.3 % (3/1099) brivaracetam patients and 0.7 % (3/459) placebo 
patients. In the short-term clinical studies of brivaracetam in epilepsy patients, there were no cases of 
completed suicide and suicide attempt, however both have been reported in open-label extension 
studies (see section 4.4). 
Reactions suggestive of immediate (Type I) hypersensitivity have been reported in a small number of 
brivaracetam patients (9/3022) during clinical development. 
Paediatric population 
The safety profile of brivaracetam observed in children from 1 month of age was consistent with the 
safety profile observed in adults. In the open label, uncontrolled, long-term studies suicidal ideation 
was reported in 4.7 % of paediatric patients assessed from 6 years onwards (more common in 
adolescents) compared with 2.4 % of adults and behavioural disorders were reported in 24.8 % of 
paediatric patients compared with 15.1 % of adults. The majority of events were mild or moderate in 
intensity, were non-serious, and did not lead to discontinuation of study drug. An additional adverse 
reaction reported in children was psychomotor hyperactivity (4.7 %).  
No specific pattern of adverse event (AE) was identified in children from 1◦month to < 4◦years of age 
when compared to older paediatric age groups. No significant safety information was identified 
indicating the increasing incidence of a particular AE in this age group. As data available in children 
younger than 2 years of age is limited, brivaracetam is not indicated in this age range. Limited clinical 
data are available in neonates. 
Elderly  
Of the 130 elderly subjects enrolled in the brivaracetam phase 2/3 development program (44 with 
epilepsy), 100 were 65-74 years of age and 30 were 75-84 years of age. The safety profile in elderly 
patients appears to be similar to that observed in younger adult patients. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms 
There is limited clinical experience with brivaracetam overdose in humans. Somnolence and dizziness 
have been reported in a healthy subject taking a single dose of 1,400 mg of brivaracetam. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The following adverse reactions were reported with brivaracetam overdose: nausea, vertigo, balance 
disorder, anxiety, fatigue, irritability, aggression, insomnia, depression, and suicidal ideation in the 
post-marketing experience. In general, the adverse reactions associated with brivaracetam overdose 
were consistent with the known adverse reactions. 
Management of overdose 
There is no specific antidote for overdose with brivaracetam. Treatment of an overdose should include 
general supportive measures. Since less than 10 % of brivaracetam is excreted in urine, haemodialysis 
is not expected to significantly enhance brivaracetam clearance (see section 5.2).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antiepileptics, other antiepileptics, ATC code: N03AX23  
Mechanism of action 
Brivaracetam displays a high and selective affinity for synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A), a 
transmembrane glycoprotein found at presynaptic level in neurons and in endocrine cells. Although 
the exact role of this protein remains to be elucidated it has been shown to modulate exocytosis of 
neurotransmitters. Binding to SV2A is believed to be the primary mechanism for brivaracetam 
anticonvulsant activity. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy of brivaracetam for the adjunctive therapy of partial onset seizures (POS) was established 
in 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose, multi-center clinical studies in subjects 
16 years of age and older. The daily dose of brivaracetam ranged from 5 to 200 mg/day across these 
studies. All studies had an 8-week baseline period followed by a 12-week treatment period with no up-
titration. 1,558 patients received study drug of which 1,099 received brivaracetam. Study enrollment 
criteria required that patients have uncontrolled POS despite treatment with either 1 or 2 concomitant 
AEDs. Patients were required to have at least 8 POS during the baseline period. The primary endpoints 
in the phase 3 studies were the percent reduction in POS frequency over placebo and the 50 % 
responder rate based on 50 % reduction in POS frequency from baseline. 
The most commonly taken AEDs at the time of study entry were carbamazepine (40.6 %), lamotrigine 
(25.2 %), valproate (20.5 %), oxcarbazepine (16.0 %), topiramate (13.5 %), phenytoin (10.2 %) and 
levetiracetam (9.8 %). The median baseline seizure frequency across the 3 studies was 9 seizures per 
28 days. Patients had a mean duration of epilepsy of approximately 23 years. 
The efficacy outcomes are summarized in Table 2. Overall, brivaracetam was efficacious for the 
adjunctive treatment of partial onset seizures in patients 16 years of age and older between 50 mg/day 
and 200 mg/day.

* Statistically significant 
(1) Approximately 20 % of the patients were on concomitant levetiracetam  
(2) The primary outcome for N01252 did not achieve statistical significance based on the sequential 
testing procedure. The 100 mg/day dose was nominally significant. 
In clinical studies, a reduction in seizure frequency over placebo was higher with the dose of 
100 mg/day than with 50 mg/day. Apart from dose-dependent increases in incidences of somnolence 
and fatigue, brivaracetam 50 mg/day and 100 mg/day had a similar safety profile including CNS-
related AEs and with long-term use. 
Figure 1 shows the percentage of patients (excluding patients with concomitant levetiracetam) by 
category of reduction from baseline in POS frequency per 28 days in all 3 studies. Patients with more 
than a 25 % increase in POS are shown at left as “worse”. Patients with an improvement in percent 
reduction in baseline POS frequency are shown in the 4 right-most categories. The percentages of 
patients with at least a 50 % reduction in seizure frequency were 20.3 %, 34.2 %, 39.5 %, and 37.8 % 
for placebo, 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day, and 200 mg/day, respectively.

Figure 1:  Proportion of patients by category of seizure response for brivaracetam and placebo over 
12 weeks across all three double-blind pivotal clinical studies 
In a pooled analysis of the three pivotal clinical studies, no differences in efficacy (measured as 50 % 
responder rate) was observed within the dose range of 50 mg/day to 200 mg/day when brivaracetam is 
combined with inducing or non-inducing AEDs. In clinical studies 2.5 % (4/161), 5.1 % (17/332) and 
4.0% (10/249) of the patients on brivaracetam 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day and 200 mg/day respectively 
became seizure free during the 12-week treatment period compared with 0.5 % (2/418) on placebo.  
Improvement in the median percent reduction in seizure frequency per 28 days has been observed in 
patients with type IC seizure (secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizures) at baseline treated with 
brivaracetam (66.6 % (n=62), 61.2 % (n=100) and 82.1 % (n=75) of the patients on brivaracetam 
50 mg/day, 100 mg/day and 200 mg/day respectively as compared to placebo 33.3 % (n=115)).  
The efficacy of brivaracetam in monotherapy has not been established. Brivaracetam is not 
recommended for use in monotherapy.  
Treatment with levetiracetam 
In two phase 3 randomised placebo-controlled clinical studies, levetiracetam was administered as 
concomitant AED in about 20 % of the patients. Although the number of subjects is limited, there was 
no observed benefit of brivaracetam versus placebo in patients taking levetiracetam concurrently 
which may reflect competition at the SV2A binding site. No additional safety or tolerability concerns 
were observed. 
In a third study, a pre-specified analysis demonstrated efficacy over placebo for 100 mg/day and 
200 mg/day in patients with prior exposure to levetiracetam. The lower efficacy observed in these 
patients compared to the leveticacetam-naïve patients was likely due to the higher number of prior 
AEDs used and higher baseline seizure frequency. 
Elderly (65 years of age and above) 
The three pivotal double-blind placebo-controlled clinical studies included 38 elderly patients aged 
between 65 and 80 years. Although data are limited, the efficacy was comparable to younger subjects. 
Open label extension studies 
Across all studies, 81.7 % of the patients who completed randomized studies were enrolled in the 
long-term open-label extension studies. From entry into the randomized studies,5.3 % of the subjects 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
exposed to brivaracetam for 6 months (n=1,500) were seizure free compared to 4.6 % and 3.7 % for 
subjects exposed for 12 months (n=1,188) and 24 months (n=847), respectively. However, as a high 
proportion of subjects (26%) discontinued from the open-label studies due to lack of efficacy, a 
selection bias may have occurred, as the subjects who stayed in the study responded better than those 
who have terminated prematurely. 
In patients who were followed up in the open-label extension studies for up to 8 years, the safety 
profile was similar to that observed in the short-term, placebo-controlled studies. 
Paediatric population 
In children aged 2 years and older, partial onset seizures have a similar pathophysiology to those in 
adolescents and adults. Experience with epilepsy medicines suggests that the results of efficacy studies 
performed in adults can be extrapolated to children down to the age of 2 years provided the paediatric 
dose adaptations are established and safety has been demonstrated (see sections 5.2 and 4.8). Doses in 
patients from 2 years of age were defined by weight-based dose adaptations which have been 
established to achieve similar plasma concentrations to the ones observed in adults taking efficacious 
doses (section 5.2). 
A long-term, uncontrolled, open-label safety study included children (from 1 month of age to less than 
16 years) who continued treatment after completing the PK study (see section 5.2), children who 
continued treatment after completing the i.v. (intravenous) safety study and children directly enrolled 
into the safety study. Children who directly enrolled received a brivaracetam starting dose of 
1 mg/kg/day and depending on response and tolerability, the dose was increased up to 5 mg/kg/day by 
doubling the dose at weekly intervals. No child received a dose greater than 200 mg/day. For children 
weighing 50 kg or greater the brivaracetam starting dose was 50 mg/day and depending on response 
and tolerability, the dose was increased up to a maximum of 200 mg/day by weekly increments of 
50 mg/day.  
From the pooled open-label safety and PK studies in adjunctive therapy, 186 children with POS in the 
age range of 1 month < 16 years of age have received brivaracetam, of whom 149 have been treated 
for ≥ 3 months, 138 for ≥ 6 months, 123 for ≥ 12 months, 107 for ≥ 24 months, and 90 for 
≥ 36 months. 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
brivaracetam in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in epilepsy with partial onset seizures 
(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Brivaracetam film-coated tablets, oral solution and solution for intravenous injection show the same 
AUC, while the maximum plasma concentration is slightly higher after intravenous administration. 
Brivaracetam exhibits linear and time-independent pharmacokinetics with low intra- and inter-subject 
variability, and features complete absorption, very low protein binding, renal excretion following 
extensive biotransformation, and pharmacologically inactive metabolites.  
Absorption 
Brivaracetam is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration and the absolute 
bioavailablity is approximately 100 %. The median tmax for tablets taken without food is 1 hour (tmax 
range is 0.25 to 3 h).  
Coadministration with a high-fat meal slowed down the absorption rate (median tmax 3 h) and 
decreased the maximum plasma concentration (37 % lower) of brivaracetam, while the extent of 
absorption remained unchanged. 
14 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
Brivaracetam is weakly bound (≤ 20 %) to plasma proteins. The volume of distribution is 0.5 L/kg, a 
value close to that of the total body water. 
Due to its lipophylicity (Log P) brivaracetam has high cell membrane permeability.  
Biotransformation 
Brivaracetam is primarily metabolized by hydrolysis of the amide moiety to form the corresponding 
carboxylic acid (approximately 60 % the elimination), and secondarily by hydroxylation on the propyl 
side chain (approximately 30 % the elimination). The hydrolysis of the amide moiety leading to the 
carboxylic acid metabolite (34 % of the dose in urine) is supported by hepatic and extra-hepatic 
amidase. In vitro, the hydroxylation of brivaracetam is mediated primarily by CYP2C19. Both 
metabolites, are further metabolised forming a common hydroxylated acid formed predominantly by 
hydroxylation of the propyl side chain on the carboxylic acid metabolite (mainly by CYP2C9). In vivo, 
in human subjects possessing ineffective mutations of CYP2C19, production of the hydroxy 
metabolite is decreased 10-fold while brivaracetam itself is increased by 22 % or 42 % in individuals 
with one or both mutated alleles. The three metabolites are not pharmacologically active. 
Elimination 
Brivaracetam is eliminated primarily by metabolism and by excretion in the urine. More than 95 % of 
the dose, including metabolites, is excreted in the urine within 72 hours after intake. Less than 1 % of 
the dose is excreted in faeces and less than 10 % of brivaracetam is excreted unchanged in urine. The 
terminal plasma half-life (t1/2) is approximately 9 hours. The total plasma clearance in patients was 
estimated to 3.6 L/h.  
Linearity 
Pharmacokinetics is dose-proportional from 10 to at least 600 mg. 
Interactions with medicinal products 
Brivaracetam is cleared by multiple pathways including renal excretion, non-CYP-mediated 
hydrolysis and CYP-mediated oxidations. In vitro, brivaracetam is not a substrate of human P-
glycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug resistance proteins (MRP) 1 and 2, and likely not organic anion 
transporter polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) and OATP1B3. 
In vitro assays showed that brivaracetam disposition should not be significantly affected by CYP (eg. 
CYP1A, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) inhibitors. 
In vitro, brivaracetam was not an inhibitor of the CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2D6, CYP3A4, or the transporters P-gp, BCRP, BSEP MRP2, MATE-K, MATE-1, OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, OAT1 and OCT1 at clinically relevant concentrations. In vitro, brivaracetam did not 
induce CYP1A2.  
Pharmacokinetics in special patient groups 
Elderly (65 years of age and above) 
In a study in elderly subjects (65 to79 years old; with creatinine clearance 53 to 98 ml/min/1.73 m²) 
receiving brivaracetam 400 mg/day in bid administration, the plasma half-life of brivaracetam was 
7.9 hours and 9.3 hours in the 65 to 75 and >75 years groups, respectively. The steady-state plasma 
clearance of brivaracetam was similar (0.76 ml/min/kg) to young healthy male subjects 
(0.83 ml/min/kg) (see section 4.2). 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renal impairment 
A study in subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min/1.73 m² and not 
requiring dialysis) revealed that the plasma AUC of brivaracetam was moderately increased (+21 %) 
relative to healthy controls, while the AUC of the acid, hydroxy and hydroxyacid metabolites were 
increased 3-, 4-, and 21-fold, respectively. The renal clearance of these non active metabolites was 
decreased 10-fold. The hydroxyacid metabolite did not reveal any safety concerns in non clinical 
studies. Brivaracetam has not been studied in patients undergoing hemodialysis (see section 4.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
A pharmacokinetic study in subjects with hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh classes A, B, and C) showed 
similar increases in exposure to brivaracetam irrespective of disease severity (50 %, 57 % and 59 %), 
relative to matched healthy controls. (see section 4.2). 
Body weight 
A 40 % decrease in steady-state plasma concentration has been estimated across a body weight range 
from 46 kg to 115 kg. However, this is not considered to be a clinically relevant difference.  
Gender 
There are no clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of brivaracetam by gender. 
Race 
The pharmacokinetics of brivaracetam was not significantly affected by race (Caucasian, Asian) in a 
population pharmacokinetic modeling from epilepsy patients. The number of patients with other ethnic 
background was limited. 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics relationship 
The EC50 (brivaracetam plasma concentration corresponding to 50 % of the maximum effect) was 
estimated to be 0.57 mg/L. This plasma concentration is slightly above the median exposure obtained 
after brivaracetam doses of 50 mg/day. Further seizure frequency reduction is obtained by increasing 
the dose to 100 mg/day and reaches a plateau at 200 mg/day. 
Paediatric population 
In a pharmacokinetic study with a 3-week evaluation period and weekly fixed 3-step up-titration using 
the brivaracetam oral solution, 99 subjects aged 1 month to < 16 years were evaluated. Brivaracetam 
was administered at weekly increasing doses of approximately 1 mg/kg/day, 2 mg/kg/day, and 
4 mg/kg/day. All doses were adjusted by body weight, and did not exceed a maximum of 50 mg/day, 
100 mg/day, and 200 mg/day. At the end of the evaluation period, subjects may have been eligible for 
entry into a long-term follow-up study continuing on their last received dose (see section 4.8). Plasma 
concentrations were shown to be dose-proportional in all age groups. Population pharmacokinetics 
modeling was performed based on sparse plasma concentration data collected in the 3-week PK study 
and the ongoing long-term follow-up study. 232 paediatric patients with epilepsy, aged 2 months to 
17 years, were included in the analysis. The analysis indicated that doses of 5.0 (body weights 10-
20 kg) and 4.0 mg/kg/day (body weights 20-50 kg) provide the same steady-state average plasma 
concentration as in adults receiving 200 mg/day. The estimated plasma clearance was 0.96 L/h, 
1.61 L/h, 2.18  L/h and 3.19 L/h for children weighing 10 kg, 20 kg, 30 kg and 50 kg, respectively. In 
comparison, plasma clearance was estimated at 3.58 L/h in adult patients (70 kg body weight). 
Currently, no clinical data are available in neonates. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In safety pharmacology studies, the predominant effects were CNS related (mainly transient CNS 
depression and decreased spontaneous locomotor activity) seen at multiples (greater than 50 fold) of 
the pharmacologically active dose of brivaracetam, 2 mg/kg. Learning and memory function were not 
affected.  
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Findings not observed in clinical studies, but seen in the repeated-dose toxicology dog studies at 
exposure similar to the clinical plasma AUC, were hepatotoxic effects (mainly porphyria). However, 
toxicological data accumulated on brivaracetam and on a structurally-related compound indicate that 
the dog liver changes have developed through mechanisms not relevant for humans. No adverse liver 
changes were seen in rats and monkeys following chronic administration of brivaracetam at 5- and 42-
fold the clinical AUC exposure. In monkeys, CNS signs (prostrate, loss of balance, clumsy 
movements) occurred at 64 fold the clinical Cmax, these effects being less apparent over time. 
Genotoxicity studies have not detected any mutagenic or clastogenic activity. Carcinogenicity studies 
did not indicate any oncogenic potential in rats, whereas increased incidences of hepatocellular tumors 
in male mice are considered to result of a non-genotoxic, mode of action linked to a phenobarbitone-
like liver enzyme induction, which is a known rodent specific phenomenon.  
Brivaracetam did not affect male or female fertility and has demonstrated no teratogenic potential in 
either rat or rabbit. Embryotoxicity was observed in rabbits at a maternal toxic dose of brivaracetam 
with an exposure level 8-fold the clinical AUC exposure at the maximum recommended dose. In rats, 
brivaracetam was shown to readily cross the placenta and to be excreted in milk of lactating rats with 
concentrations similar to maternal plasma levels. 
Brivaracetam did not show any dependence potential in rats. 
Juvenile animals studies 
In juvenile rats, brivaracetam exposure levels 6- to 15-fold the clinical AUC exposure at the maximum 
recommended dose induced developmental adverse effects (i.e. mortality, clinical signs, decreased 
body weight and lower brain weight). There were no adverse effects on CNS function, 
neuropathological and brain histopathological examination. In juvenile dogs, the brivaracetam-induced 
changes at the exposure level 6- fold the clinical AUC were similar to those observed in adult animals. 
There were no adverse effects in any of the standard developmental or maturation endpoints.

Adults  
The recommended starting dose is either 50 mg/day or 100 mg/day based on physician’s assessment of 
required seizure reduction versus potential side effects. Based on individual patient response and 
tolerability, the dose may be adjusted in the effective dose range of 50 mg/day to 200 mg/day.  
Adolescents and children weighing 50 kg or more  
The recommended starting dose is 50 mg/day. Brivaracetam may also be initiated at 100 mg/day based 
on physician’s assessment of need for seizure control. The recommended maintenance dose is 
100 mg/day. Based on individual patient response, the dose may be adjusted in the effective dose 
range of 50 mg/day to 200 mg/day. 
Adolescents and children weighing from 20 kg to less than 50 kg 
The recommended starting dose is 1mg/kg/day. Brivaracetam may also be initiated at doses up to 
2 mg/kg/day based on physician’s assessment of need for seizure control. The recommended 
maintenance dose is 2 mg/kg/day. Based on individual patient response, the dose may be adjusted in 
the effective dose range of 1 mg/kg/day to 4 mg/kg/day. 
Children weighing from 10 kg to less than 20 kg 
The recommended starting dose is 1 mg/kg/day. Brivaracetam may also be initiated at doses up to 
2.5 mg/kg/day based on physician’s assessment of need for seizure control. The recommended 
maintenance dose is 2.5 mg/kg/day. Based on individual patient response, the dose may be adjusted in 
the effective dose range of 1 mg/kg/day to 5 mg/kg/day. 
The dose per intake for each patient should be calculated using the following formula: 
Volume per administration (ml) = [weight (kg) x daily dose (mg/kg/day) ] x 0.05 
Briviact oral solution is provided with: 
-  a 5 ml syringe (blue graduation marks) graduated every 0.1 ml increments (each 0.1 ml 
increment corresponds to 1 mg of brivaracetam). Additional graduations at 0.25 ml and 
0.75 ml starting at 0.25 ml up to 5 ml are shown. 
-  a 10 ml syringe (black graduation marks) graduated in 0.25 ml increments (each 0.25 ml 
increment corresponds to 2.5 mg of brivaracetam).  
The physician should instruct the patient on the appropriate syringe to use. 
If the calculated dose per intake is 5 mg (0.5 ml) or more and up to 50 mg (5 ml), the 5 ml oral syringe 
should be used. 
If the calculated dose per intake is more than 50 mg (5 ml), the larger 10 ml oral syringe should be 
used. 
The calculated dose should be rounded to the nearest graduated increment. If the calculated dose is 
equidistant between two graduated increments, the larger graduated increment should be used. 
The table below provides examples of volumes of oral solution per intake depending on prescribed 
dose and body weight. The precise volume of oral solution is to be calculated according to the exact 
body weight of the child.  
Note that the dosage is limited to the available graduations of the syringes. For example, for a patient 
that needs a dose of 2.15 ml, the applied volume needs to be rounded up to 2.2 ml as the 5 ml syringe 
can only deliver 2.1 ml or 2.2 ml. Likewise a volume of 1.13 ml would need to be rounded down to a 
delivered volume of 1.1 ml.

Missed doses 
If patients missed one dose or more, it is recommended that they take a single dose as soon as they 
remember and take the following dose at the usual morning or evening time. This may avoid the 
brivaracetam plasma concentration falling below the efficacy level and prevent breakthrough seizures 
from occurring. 
Discontinuation 
For patients from 16 years of age, if brivaracetam has to be discontinued, it is recommended that the 
dose is reduced gradually by 50 mg/day on a weekly basis. 
For patients below the age of 16 years, if brivaracetam has to be discontinued, it is recommended that 
the dose is reduced by a maximum of half the dose every week until a dose of 1 mg/kg/day (for 
patients with a body weight less than 50 kg) or 50 mg/day (for patients with body weight of 50 kg or 
more) is reached.  
After 1 week of treatment at 50 mg/day, a final week of treatment at the dose of 20 mg/day is 
recommended. 
Special populations 
Elderly (65 years of age and above) 
No dose adjustment is needed in elderly patients (see section 5.2). 
The clinical experience in patients ≥ 65 years is limited. 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is needed in patients with impaired renal function (see section 5.2). Brivaracetam 
is not recommended in end-stage renal disease patients undergoing dialysis due to lack of data. 
Based on data in adults, no dose adjustment is necessary in paediatric patients with impaired renal 
function. No clinical data are available in paediatric patients with renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
Exposure to brivaracetam was increased in adult patients with chronic liver disease. 
In patients with hepatic impairment, the following adjusted doses, administered in 2 divided doses, 
approximately 12 hours apart, are recommended for all stages of hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 
and 5.2). No clinical data are available in paediatric patients with hepatic impairment.

Paediatric patients less than 2 years of age 
The efficacy of brivaracetam in paediatric patients aged less than 2 years has not yet been established. 
Currently available data are described in section 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 but no recommendation on a 
posology can be made. 
Method of administration 
Brivaracetam oral solution can be diluted in water or juice shortly before swallowing and may be 
taken with or without food (see section 5.2). A nasogastric tube or a gastrostomy tube may be used 
when administering brivaracetam oral solution.  
Briviact oral solution is provided with a 5 ml and a 10 ml oral dosing syringe with their adaptor.  
Instructions for use are provided in the package leaflet.  
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or other pyrrolidone derivatives or to any of the excipients 
listed in section 6.1.  
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Suicidal ideation and behaviour 
Suicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic drugs 
(AEDs), including brivaracetam, in several indications. A meta-analysis of randomized placebo-
controlled clinical studies of AEDs has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and 
behaviour. The mechanism of this risk is not known and the available data do not exclude the 
possibility of an increased risk for brivaracetam. 
Patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate treatment 
should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical advice 
should any signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge. See also section 4.8, paediatric data. 
Hepatic impairment 
There are limited clinical data on the use of brivaracetam in patients with pre-existing hepatic 
impairment. Dose adjustments are recommended for patients with hepatic impairment (see section 
4.2). 
Excipients 
Sodium content 
Brivaracetam oral solution contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23mg) per ml, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium free’. 
Fructose intolerance 
This medicine contains 168 mg sorbitol (E420) in each ml. Patients with hereditary fructose 
intolerance (HFI) should not take this medicinal product. 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Excipients which may cause intolerance 
The oral solution contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E218), which may cause allergic reactions 
(possibly delayed). 
Brivaracetam oral solution contains propylene glycol (E1520). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Formal interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
Concomitant treatment with levetiracetam 
In the clinical studies, although the numbers were limited, there was no observed benefit of 
brivaracetam versus placebo in patients taking levetiracetam concurrently. No additional safety or 
tolerability concern was observed (see section 5.1). 
Interaction with alcohol 
In a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction study between brivaracetam 200 mg single 
dose and ethanol 0.6 g/L continuous infusion in healthy subjects, there was no pharmacokinetic 
interaction, but brivaracetam approximately doubled the effect of alcohol on psychomotor function, 
attention and memory. Intake of brivaracetam with alcohol is not recommended. 
Pharmacokinetic interactions 
Effects of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of brivaracetam 
In vitro data suggest that brivaracetam has a low interaction potential. The main disposition pathway 
of brivaracetam is by CYP-independent hydrolysis. A second disposition pathway involves 
hydroxylation mediated by CYP2C19 (see section 5.2).  
Brivaracetam plasma concentrations may increase when coadministered with CYP2C19 strong 
inhibitors (e.g. fluconazole, fluvoxamine), but the risk of a clinically relevant CYP2C19-mediated 
interaction is considered to be low. Limited clinical data are available implying that coadministration 
of cannabidiol may increase the plasma exposure of brivaracetam, possibly through CYP2C19 
inhibition, but the clinical relevance is uncertain. 
Rifampicin 
In healthy subjects, coadministration with the strong enzyme inducer rifampicin (600 mg/day for 
5 days), decreased brivaracetam area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) by 
45 %. Prescribers should consider adjusting the brivaracetam dose in patients starting or ending 
treatment with rifampicin.  
Strong enzyme inducing AEDs 
Brivaracetam plasma concentrations are decreased when coadministered with strong enzyme inducing 
AEDs (carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin) but no dose adjustment is required (see table 1).  
Other enzyme inducers 
Other strong enzyme inducers (such as St John´s wort (Hypericum perforatum)) may also decrease the 
systemic exposure of brivaracetam. Therefore, starting or ending treatment with St John’s wort should 
be done with caution. 
Effects of brivaracetam on other medicinal products  
Brivaracetam given 50 or 150 mg/day did not affect the AUC of midazolam (metabolised by 
CYP3A4). The risk of clinically relevant CYP3A4 interactions is considered to be low. 
In vitro studies have shown that brivaracetam exhibits little or no inhibition of CYP450 isoforms 
except for CYP2C19. Brivaracetam may increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products 
metabolised by CYP2C19 (e.g. lanzoprazole, omeprazole, diazepam). When tested in vitro 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
brivaracetam did not induce CYP1A1/2 but induced CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. No CYP3A4 induction 
was found in vivo (see midazolam above). CYP2B6 induction has not been investigated in vivo and 
brivaracetam may decrease plasma concentrations of medicinal products metabolised by CYP2B6 
(e.g. efavirenz). In vitro, interaction studies to determine the potential inhibitory effects on transporters 
concluded that there were no clinically relevant effects, except for OAT3. In vitro, brivaracetam 
inhibits OAT3 with a half maximal inhibitory concentration 42-fold higher than the Cmax at the highest 
clinical dose. Brivaracetam 200mg/day may increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products 
transported by OAT3. 
Antiepileptic drugs 
Potential interactions between brivaracetam (50 mg/day to 200 mg/day) and other AEDs were 
investigated in a pooled analysis of plasma drug concentrations from all phase 2-3 studies in a 
population pharmacokinetic analysis of placebo-controlled phase 2-3 clinical studies, and in dedicated 
drug-drug interaction studies (for the following AEDs: carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenytoin and 
topiramate). The effect of the interactions on the plasma concentration is summarised in table 1 
(increase is indicated as “↑” and decrease as “↓”, area under the plasma concentration versus time 
curve as “AUC”, maximum observed concentration as Cmax).

Carbamazepine  
Brivaracetam is a moderate reversible inhibitor of epoxide hydrolase resulting in an increased 
concentration of carbamazepine epoxide, an active metabolite of carbamazepine. In controlled clinical 
studies, the carbamazepine epoxide plasma concentration increased by a mean of 37 %, 62 % and 
98 % with little variability at brivaracetam doses of 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day and 200 mg/day 
respectively. No safety risks were observed. There was no additive effect of brivaracetam and 
valproate on the AUC of carbamazepine epoxide. 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Oral contraceptives 
Co-administration of brivaracetam (100 mg/day) with an oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol 
(0.03 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.15 mg) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of either substance. 
When brivaracetam was coadministered at a dose of 400 mg/day (twice the recommended maximum 
daily dose) with an oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol (0.03 mg) and levonorgestrel 
(0.15 mg), a reduction in oestrogen and progestin AUCs of 27 % and 23 %, respectively, was observed 
without impact on suppression of ovulation. There was generally no change in the concentration-time 
profiles of the endogenous markers estradiol, progesterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle 
stimulating hormone (FSH), and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential  
Physicians should discuss family planning and contraception with women of childbearing potential 
taking brivaracetam (see Pregnancy). 
If a woman decides to become pregnant, the use of brivaracetam should be carefully re-evaluated. 
Pregnancy 
Risk related to epilepsy and antiepileptic medicinal products in general 
For all anti-epileptic drugs, it has been shown that in the offspring of treated women with epilepsy, the 
prevalence of malformations is two to three times greater than the rate of approximately 3 % in the 
general population. In the treated population, an increase in malformations has been noted with 
polytherapy; however, the extent to which the treatment and/or the underlying condition is responsible 
has not been elucidated. Discontinuation of anti-epileptic treatments may result in exacerbation of the 
disease which could be harmful to the mother and the foetus. 
Risk related to brivaracetam 
There is a limited amount of data from the use of brivaracetam in pregnant women. There is no data on 
placental transfer in humans, but brivaracetam was shown to readily cross the placenta in rats (see 
section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Animal studies did not detect any teratogenic 
potential of brivaracetam (see section 5.3). 
In clinical studies, brivaracetam was used as adjunctive therapy and when it was used with 
carbamazepine, it induced a dose-related increase in the concentration of the active metabolite, 
carbamazepine-epoxide (see section 4.5). There is insufficient data to determine the clinical 
significance of this effect in pregnancy. 
As a precautionary measure, brivaracetam should not be used during pregnancy unless clinically 
necessary i.e. (if the benefit to the mother clearly outweighs the potential risk to the foetus). 
Breast-feeding 
Brivaracetam is excreted in human breast milk. A decision should be made whether to discontinue 
breastfeeding or to discontinue brivaracetam, taking into account the benefit of the medicinal product 
to the mother. In case of co-administration of brivaracetam and carbamazepine, the amount of 
carbamazepine-epoxide excreted in breast milk could increase. There is insufficient data to determine 
the clinical significance. 
Fertility 
No human data on the effect of brivaracetam on fertility are available. In rats, there was no effect on 
fertility with brivaracetam (see section 5.3).

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Brivaracetam has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Due to possible differences in individual sensitivity some patients might experience somnolence, 
dizziness, and other central nervous system (CNS) related symptoms. Patients should be advised not to 
drive a car or to operate other potentially hazardous machines until they are familiar with the effects of 
brivaracetam on their ability to perform such activities.   
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions (>10 %) with brivaracetam treatment were: 
somnolence (14.3 %) and dizziness (11.0 %). They were usually mild to moderate in intensity. 
Somnolence and fatigue were reported at a higher incidence with increasing dose.  
The discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 3.5 %, 3.4 % and 4.0 % for patients randomized 
to brivaracetam at respectively the dose of 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day and 200 mg/day and 1.7% for 
patients randomized to placebo. The adverse reactions most frequently resulting in discontinuation of 
brivaracetam therapy were dizziness (0.8 %) and convulsion (0.8 %). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
In the table below, adverse reactions, which were identified based on review of the three placebo-
controlled, fixed-dose studies safety database in subjects ≥ 16 years of age, are listed by System Organ

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Neutropenia has been reported in 0.5 % (6/1,099) brivaracetam patients and 0 % (0/459) placebo 
patients. Four of these subjects had decreased neutrophil counts at baseline, and experienced 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
additional decrease in neutrophil counts after initiation of brivaracetam treatment. None of the 6 cases 
of neutropenia were severe, required any specific treatment or led to discontinuation of brivaracetam 
and none had associated infections. 
Suicidal ideation has been reported in 0.3 % (3/1,099) brivaracetam patients and 0.7 % (3/459) 
placebo patients. In the short-term clinical studies of brivaracetam in epilepsy patients, there were no 
cases of completed suicide and suicide attempt, however both have been reported in open-label 
extension studies (see section 4.4). 
Reactions suggestive of immediate (Type I) hypersensitivity have been reported in a small number of 
brivaracetam patients (9/3022) during clinical development. 
Paediatric population 
The safety profile of brivaracetam observed in children from 1 month of age was consistent with the 
safety profile observed in adults. In the open label, uncontrolled, long-term studies suicidal ideation 
was reported in 4.7 % of paediatric patients (assessed from 6 years onwards, more common in 
adolescents) compared with 2.4 % of adults and behavioural disorders were reported in 24.8 % of 
paediatric patients compared with 15.1 % of adults. The majority of events were mild or moderate in 
intensity, were non-serious, and did not lead to discontinuation of study drug. An additional adverse 
reaction reported in children was psychomotor hyperactivity (4.7 %).  
No specific pattern of adverse event (AE) was identified in children from 1◦month to < 4◦years of age 
when compared to older paediatric age groups. No significant safety information was identified 
indicating the increasing incidence of a particular AE in this age group. As data available in children 
younger than 2 years of age is limited, brivaracetam is not indicated in this age range. Limited clinical 
data are available in neonates.  
Elderly  
Of the 130 elderly subjects enrolled in the brivaracetam phase 2/3 development program (44 with 
epilepsy), 100 were 65-74 years of age and 30 were 75-84 years of age. The safety profile in elderly 
patients appears to be similar to that observed in younger adult patients. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms 
There is limited clinical experience with brivaracetam overdose in humans. Somnolence and dizziness 
have been reported in a healthy subject taking a single dose of 1,400 mg of brivaracetam. 
The following adverse reactions were reported with brivaracetam overdose: nausea, vertigo, balance 
disorder, anxiety, fatigue, irritability, aggression, insomnia, depression, and suicidal ideation in the 
post-marketing experience. In general, the adverse reactions associated with brivaracetam overdose 
were consistent with the known adverse reactions. 
Management of overdose 
There is no specific antidote for overdose with brivaracetam. Treatment of an overdose should include 
general supportive measures. Since less than 10 % of brivaracetam is excreted in urine, haemodialysis 
is not expected to significantly enhance brivaracetam clearance (see section 5.2).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antiepileptics, other antiepileptics, ATC code: N03AX23  
Mechanism of action 
Brivaracetam displays a high and selective affinity for synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A), a 
transmembrane glycoprotein found at presynaptic level in neurons and in endocrine cells. Although 
the exact role of this protein remains to be elucidated it has been shown to modulate exocytosis of 
neurotransmitters. Binding to SV2A is believed to be the primary mechanism for brivaracetam 
anticonvulsant activity. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy of brivaracetam for the adjunctive therapy of partial onset seizures (POS) was established 
in 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose, multi-center clinical studies in subjects 
16 years of age and older. The daily dose of brivaracetam ranged from 5 to 200 mg/day across these 
studies. All studies had an 8-week baseline period followed by a 12-week treatment period with no up-
titration. 1,558 patients received study drug of which 1,099 received brivaracetam. Study enrollment 
criteria required that patients have uncontrolled POS despite treatment with either 1 or 2 concomitant 
AEDs. Patients were required to have at least 8 POS during the baseline period. The primary endpoints 
in the phase 3 studies were the percent reduction in POS frequency over placebo and the 50 % 
responder rate based on 50 % reduction in POS frequency from baseline. 
The most commonly taken AEDs at the time of study entry were carbamazepine (40.6 %), lamotrigine 
(25.2 %), valproate (20.5 %), oxcarbazepine (16.0 %), topiramate (13.5 %), phenytoin (10.2 %) and 
levetiracetam (9.8 %). The median baseline seizure frequency across the 3 studies was 9 seizures per 
28 days. Patients had a mean duration of epilepsy of approximately 23 years. 
The efficacy outcomes are summarized in Table 2. Overall, brivaracetam was efficacious for the 
adjunctive treatment of partial onset seizures in patients 16 years of age and older between 50 mg/day 
and 200 mg/day.

* Statistically significant 
(1) Approximately 20 % of the patients were on concomitant levetiracetam  
(2) The primary outcome for N01252 did not achieve statistical significance based on the sequential 
testing procedure . The 100 mg/day dose was nominally significant. 
In clinical studies, a reduction in seizure frequency over placebo was higher with the dose of 
100 mg/day than with 50 mg/day. Apart from dose-dependent increases in incidences of somnolence 
and fatigue, brivaracetam 50 mg/day and 100 mg/day had a similar safety profile including CNS-
related AEs and with long-term use. 
Figure 1 shows the percentage of patients (excluding patients with concomitant levetiracetam) by 
category of reduction from baseline in POS frequency per 28 days in all 3 studies. Patients with more 
than a 25 % increase in POS are shown at left as “worse”. Patients with an improvement in percent 
reduction in baseline POS frequency are shown in the 4 right-most categories. The percentages of 
patients with at least a 50 % reduction in seizure frequency were 20.3 %, 34.2 %, 39.5 %, and 37.8 % 
for placebo, 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day, and 200 mg/day, respectively.

Figure 1:  Proportion of patients by category of seizure response for brivaracetam and placebo over 
12 weeks across all three double-blind pivotal clinical studies 
In a pooled analysis of the three pivotal clinical studies, no differences in efficacy (measured as 50 % 
responder rate) was observed within the dose range of 50 mg/day to 200 mg/day when brivaracetam is 
combined with inducing or non-inducing AEDs. In clinical studies 2.5 % (4/161), 5.1 % (17/332) and 
4.0% (10/249) of the patients on brivaracetam 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day and 200 mg/day respectively 
became seizure free during the 12-week treatment period compared with 0.5 % (2/418) on placebo.  
Improvement in the median percent reduction in seizure frequency per 28 days has been observed in 
patients with type IC seizure (secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizures) at baseline treated with 
brivaracetam (66.6 % (n=62), 61.2 % (n=100) and 82.1 % (n=75) of the patients on brivaracetam 
50 mg/day, 100 mg/day and 200 mg/day respectively as compared to placebo 33.3 % (n=115)).  
The efficacy of brivaracetam in monotherapy has not been established. Brivaracetam is not 
recommended for use in monotherapy.  
Treatment with levetiracetam 
In two phase 3 randomised placebo-controlled clinical studies, levetiracetam was administered as 
concomitant AED in about 20 % of the patients. Although the number of subjects is limited, there was 
no observed benefit of brivaracetam versus placebo in patients taking levetiracetam concurrently 
which may reflect competition at the SV2A binding site. No additional safety or tolerability concerns 
were observed. 
In a third study, a pre-specified analysis demonstrated efficacy over placebo for 100 mg/day and 200 
mg/day in patients with prior exposure to levetiracetam. The lower efficacy observed in these patients 
compared to the leveticacetam-naïve patients was likely due to the higher number of prior AEDs used 
and higher baseline seizure frequency. 
Elderly (65 years of age and above) 
The three pivotal double-blind placebo-controlled clinical studies included 38 elderly patients aged 
between 65 and 80 years. Although data are limited, the efficacy was comparable to younger subjects. 
Open label extension studies 
Across all studies, 81.7 % of the patients who completed randomized studies were enrolled in the 
long-term open-label extension studies. From entry into the randomized studies,5.3 % of the subjects 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
exposed to brivaracetam for 6 months (n=1,500) were seizure free compared to 4.6 % and 3.7 % for 
subjects exposed for 12 months (n=1,188) and 24 months (n=847), respectively. However, as a high 
proportion of subjects (26%) discontinued from the open-label studies due to lack of efficacy, a 
selection bias may have occurred, as the subjects who stayed in the study responded better than those 
who have terminated prematurely. 
In patients who were followed up in the open-label extension studies for up to 8 years, the safety 
profile was similar to that observed in the short-term, placebo-controlled clinical studies.  
Paediatric population 
In children aged 2 years and older, partial onset seizures have a similar pathophysiology to those in 
adolescents and adults. Experience with epilepsy medicines suggests that the results of efficacy studies 
performed in adults can be extrapolated to children down to the age of 2 years provided the paediatric 
dose adaptations are established and safety has been demonstrated (see sections 5.2 and 4.8). Doses in 
patients from 2 years of age were defined by weight-based dose adaptations which have been 
established to achieve similar plasma concentrations to the ones observed in adults taking efficacious 
doses (section 5.2).  
A long-term, uncontrolled, open-label safety study included children (from 1 month of age to less than 
16 years) who continued treatment after completing the PK study (see section 5.2), children who 
continued treatment after completing the i.v. (intravenous)  safety study and children directly enrolled 
into the safety study. Children who directly enrolled received a brivaracetam starting dose of 1 
mg/kg/day and depending on response and tolerability, the dose was increased up to 5 mg/kg/day by 
doubling the dose at weekly intervals. No child received a dose greater than 200 mg/day. For children 
weighing 50 kg or greater the brivaracetam starting dose was 50 mg/day and depending on response 
and tolerability, the dose was increased up to a maximum of 200 mg/day by weekly increments of 
50 mg/day.  
From the pooled open-label safety and PK studies in adjunctive therapy, 186 children with POS in the 
age range of 1 month < 16 years of age have received brivaracetam, of whom 149 have been treated 
for ≥ 3 months, 138 for ≥ 6 months, 123 for ≥ 12 months, 107 for ≥ 24 months, and 90 for 
≥ 36 months. 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
brivaracetam in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in epilepsy with partial onset seizures 
(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Brivaracetam film-coated tablets, oral solution and solution for intravenous injection show the same 
AUC, while the maximum plasma concentration is slightly higher after intravenous administration. 
Brivaracetam exhibits linear and time-independent pharmacokinetics with low intra- and inter-subject 
variability, and features complete absorption, very low protein binding, renal excretion following 
extensive biotransformation, and pharmacologically inactive metabolites.  
Absorption 
Brivaracetam is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration and the absolute 
bioavailablity is approximately 100 %. The median tmax for tablets taken without food is 1 hour (tmax 
range is 0.25 to 3 h).  
Coadministration with a high-fat meal slowed down the absorption rate (median tmax 3 h) and 
decreased the maximum plasma concentration (37 % lower) of brivaracetam, while the extent of 
absorption remained unchanged. 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
Brivaracetam is weakly bound (≤ 20 %) to plasma proteins. The volume of distribution is 0.5 L/kg, a 
value close to that of the total body water. 
Due to its lipophylicity (Log P) brivaracetam has high cell membrane permeability.  
Biotransformation 
Brivaracetam is primarily metabolized by hydrolysis of the amide moiety to form the corresponding 
carboxylic acid (approximately 60 % the elimination), and secondarily by hydroxylation on the propyl 
side chain (approximately 30 % the elimination). The hydrolysis of the amide moiety leading to the 
carboxylic acid metabolite (34 % of the dose in urine) is supported by hepatic and extra-hepatic 
amidase. In vitro, the hydroxylation of brivaracetam is mediated primarily by CYP2C19. Both 
metabolites, are further metabolised forming a common hydroxylated acid formed predominantly by 
hydroxylation of the propyl side chain on the carboxylic acid metabolite (mainly by CYP2C9). In vivo, 
in human subjects possessing ineffective mutations of CYP2C19, production of the hydroxy 
metabolite is decreased 10-fold while brivaracetam itself is increased by 22 % or 42 % in individuals 
with one or both mutated alleles. The three metabolites are not pharmacologically active. 
Elimination 
Brivaracetam is eliminated primarily by metabolism and by excretion in the urine. More than 95 % of 
the dose, including metabolites, is excreted in the urine within 72 hours after intake. Less than 1 % of 
the dose is excreted in faeces and less than 10 % of brivaracetam is excreted unchanged in urine. The 
terminal plasma half-life (t1/2) is approximately 9 hours. The total plasma clearance in patients was 
estimated to 3.6 L/h.  
Linearity 
Pharmacokinetics is dose-proportional from 10 to at least 600 mg. 
Interactions with medicinal products 
Brivaracetam is cleared by multiple pathways including renal excretion, non-CYP-mediated 
hydrolysis and CYP-mediated oxidations. In vitro, brivaracetam is not a substrate of human P-
glycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug resistance proteins (MRP) 1 and 2, and likely not organic anion 
transporter polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) and OATP1B3. 
In vitro assays showed that brivaracetam disposition should not be significantly affected by CYP (eg. 
CYP1A, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) inhibitors. 
In vitro, brivaracetam was not an inhibitor of the CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2D6, CYP3A4, or the transporters P-gp, BCRP, BSEP MRP2, MATE-K, MATE-1, OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, OAT1 and OCT1 at clinically relevant concentrations. In vitro, brivaracetam did not 
induce CYP1A2.  
Pharmacokinetics in special patient groups 
Elderly (65 years of age and above) 
In a study in elderly subjects (65 to79 years old; with creatinine clearance 53 to 98 ml/min/1.73 m²) 
receiving brivaracetam 400 mg/day in bid administration, the plasma half-life of brivaracetam was 
7.9 hours and 9.3 hours in the 65 to 75 and >75 years groups, respectively. The steady-state plasma 
clearance of brivaracetam was similar (0.76 ml/min/kg) to young healthy male subjects 
(0.83 ml/min/kg). (see section 4.2). 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renal impairment 
A study in subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min/1.73 m² and not 
requiring dialysis) revealed that the plasma AUC of brivaracetam was moderately increased (+21 %) 
relative to healthy controls, while the AUC of the acid, hydroxy and hydroxyacid metabolites were 
increased 3-, 4-, and 21-fold, respectively. The renal clearance of these non active metabolites was 
decreased 10-fold. The hydroxyacid metabolite did not reveal any safety concerns in non clinical 
studies. Brivaracetam has not been studied in patients undergoing hemodialysis (see section 4.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
A pharmacokinetic study in subjects with hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh classes A, B, and C) showed 
similar increases in exposure to brivaracetam irrespective of disease severity (50 %, 57 % and 59 %), 
relative to matched healthy controls. (see section 4.2). 
Body weight 
A 40 % decrease in steady-state plasma concentration has been estimated across a body weight range 
from 46 kg to 115 kg. However, this is not considered to be a clinically relevant difference.  
Gender 
There are no clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of brivaracetam by gender. 
Race 
The pharmacokinetics of brivaracetam was not significantly affected by race (Caucasian, , Asian) in a 
population pharmacokinetic modeling from epilepsy patients. The number of patients with other ethnic 
background was limited. 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics relationship 
The EC50 (brivaracetam plasma concentration corresponding to 50 % of the maximum effect) was 
estimated to be 0.57 mg/L. This plasma concentration is slightly above the median exposure obtained 
after brivaracetam doses of 50 mg/day. Further seizure frequency reduction is obtained by increasing 
the dose to 100 mg/day and reaches a plateau at 200 mg/day. 
Paediatric population 
In a pharmacokinetic study with a 3-week evaluation period and weekly fixed 3-step up-titration using 
the brivaracetam oral solution, 99 subjects aged 1 month to < 16 years were evaluated. Brivaracetam 
was administered at weekly increasing doses of approximately 1 mg/kg/day, 2 mg/kg/day, and 
4 mg/kg/day. All doses were adjusted by body weight, and did not exceed a maximum of 50 mg/day, 
100 mg/day, and 200 mg/day. At the end of the evaluation period, subjects may have been eligible for 
entry into a long-term follow-up study continuing on their last received dose (see section 4.8). Plasma 
concentrations were shown to be dose-proportional in all age groups. Population pharmacokinetics 
modeling was performed based on sparse plasma concentration data collected in the 3-week PK study 
and the ongoing long-term follow-up study. 232 paediatric patients with epilepsy, aged 2 months to 
17 years, were included in the analysis. The analysis indicated that doses of 5.0 (body weights 10-
20 kg) and 4.0 mg/kg/day (body weights 20-50 kg) provide the same steady-state average plasma 
concentration as in adults receiving 200 mg/day. The estimated plasma clearance was 0.96 L/h, 
1.61 L/h, 2.18 L/h and 3.19 L/h for children weighing 10 kg, 20 kg, 30 kg and 50 kg, respectively. In 
comparison, plasma clearance was estimated at 3.58 L/h in adult patients (70 kg body weight). 
Currently, no clinical data are available in neonates. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In safety pharmacology studies, the predominant effects were CNS related (mainly transient CNS 
depression and decreased spontaneous locomotor activity) seen at multiples (greater than 50 fold) of 
the pharmacologically active dose of brivaracetam, 2 mg/kg. Learning and memory function were not 
affected.  
36 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Findings not observed in clinical studies, but seen in the repeated-dose toxicology dog studies at 
exposure similar to the clinical plasma AUC, were hepatotoxic effects (mainly porphyria). However, 
toxicological data accumulated on brivaracetam and on a structurally-related compound indicate that 
the dog liver changes have developed through mechanisms not relevant for humans. No adverse liver 
changes were seen in rats and monkeys following chronic administration of brivaracetam at 5- and 42-
fold the clinical AUC exposure. In monkeys, CNS signs (prostrate, loss of balance, clumsy 
movements) occurred at 64 fold the clinical Cmax, these effects being less apparent over time. 
Genotoxicity studies have not detected any mutagenic or clastogenic activity. Carcinogenicity studies 
did not indicate any oncogenic potential in rats, whereas increased incidences of hepatocellular tumors 
in male mice are considered to result of a non-genotoxic, mode of action linked to a phenobarbitone-
like liver enzyme induction, which is a known rodent specific phenomenon.  
Brivaracetam did not affect male or female fertility and has demonstrated no teratogenic potential in 
either rat or rabbit. Embryotoxicity was observed in rabbits at a maternal toxic dose of brivaracetam 
with an exposure level 8-fold the clinical AUC exposure at the maximum recommended dose. In rats, 
brivaracetam was shown to readily cross the placenta and to be excreted in milk of lactating rats with 
concentrations similar to maternal plasma levels. 
Brivaracetam did not show any dependence potential in rats. 
Juvenile animals studies 
In juvenile rats, brivaracetam exposure levels 6- to 15-fold the clinical AUC exposure at the maximum 
recommended dose induced developmental adverse effects (i.e. mortality, clinical signs, decreased 
body weight and lower brain weight). There were no adverse effects on CNS function, 
neuropathological and brain histopathological examination. In juvenile dogs, the brivaracetam-induced 
changes at the exposure level 6- fold the clinical AUC were similar to those observed in adult animals. 
There were no adverse effects in any of the standard developmental or maturation endpoints.

secondary generalisation in adults, adolescents and children from 2 years of age with epilepsy. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Brivaracetam solution for injection/infusion is an alternative route of administration for patients when 
oral administration is temporarily not feasible. There is no experience with twice daily intravenous 
administration of brivaracetam for a period longer than 4 days. 
The recommended posology for adults, adolescents and children from 2 years of age is summarised in 
the following table. The dose should be administered in two equally divided doses, approximately 
12 hours apart.

Adults 
Brivaracetam may be initiated with either intravenous or oral administration. When converting from 
oral to intravenous administration or vice versa, the total daily dose and frequency of administration 
should be maintained. 
The recommended starting dose is either 50 mg/day or 100 mg/day based on physician’s assessment of 
required seizure reduction versus potential side effects. Based on individual patient response and 
tolerability, the dose may be adjusted in the effective dose range of 50 mg/day to 200 mg/day.  
Adolescents and children weighing 50 kg or more  
The recommended starting dose is 50 mg/day. Brivaracetam may also be initiated at 100 mg/day based 
on physician’s assessment of need for seizure control. The recommended maintenance dose is 
100 mg/day. Based on individual patient response, the dose may be adjusted in the effective dose 
range of 50 mg/day to 200 mg/day. 
Adolescents and children weighing from 20 kg to less than 50 kg 
The recommended starting dose is 1 mg/kg/day. Brivaracetam may also be initiated at doses up to 
2 mg/kg/day based on physician’s assessment of need for seizure control. The recommended 
maintenance dose is 2 mg/kg/day. Based on individual patient response, the dose may be adjusted in 
the effective dose range of 1 mg/kg/day to 4 mg/kg/day. 
Children weighing from 10 kg to less than 20 kg 
The recommended starting dose is 1 mg/kg/day. Brivaracetam may also be initiated at doses up to 
2.5 mg/kg/day based on physician’s assessment of need for seizure control. The recommended 
maintenance dose is 2.5 mg/kg/day. Based on individual patient response, the dose may be adjusted in 
the effective dose range of 1 mg/kg/day to 5 mg/kg/day. 
Missed doses 
If patients missed one dose or more, it is recommended that they take a single dose as soon as they 
remember and take the following dose at the usual morning or evening time. This may avoid the 
brivaracetam plasma concentration falling below the efficacy level and prevent breakthrough seizures 
from occurring. 
Discontinuation 
For patients from 16 years of age, if brivaracetam has to be discontinued, it is recommended that the 
dose is reduced gradually by 50 mg/day on a weekly basis. 
For patients below the age of 16 years, if brivaracetam has to be discontinued, it is recommended that 
the dose is reduced by a maximum of half the dose every week until a dose of 1 mg/kg/day (for 
patients with a body weight less than 50 kg) or 50 mg/day (for patients with body weight of 50 kg or 
more) is reached.  
After 1 week of treatment at 50 mg/day, a final week of treatment at the dose of 20 mg/day is 
recommended. 
Special populations 
Elderly (65 years of age and above) 
No dose adjustment is needed in elderly patients (see section 5.2). 
The clinical experience in patients ≥ 65 years is limited. 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is needed in patients with impaired renal function (see section 5.2). Brivaracetam 
is not recommended in end-stage renal disease patients undergoing dialysis due to lack of data. 
Based on data in adults, no dose adjustment is necessary in paediatric patients with impaired renal 
function. No clinical data are available in paediatric patients with renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
Exposure to brivaracetam was increased in adult patients with chronic liver disease.  
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In patients with hepatic impairment, the following adjusted doses, administered in 2 divided doses, 
approximately 12 hours apart, are recommended for all stages of hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 
and 5.2). No clinical data are available in paediatric patients with hepatic impairment.

Paediatric patients less than 2 years of age 
The efficacy of brivaracetam in paediatric patients aged less than 2 years has not yet been established. 
Currently available data are described in section 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 but no recommendation on a 
posology can be made. 
Method of administration  
-  Intravenous bolus: brivaracetam may be administered as an intravenous bolus without dilution.  
-  Intravenous infusion: brivaracetam may be diluted in a compatible diluent and administered as a 
15-minute intravenous infusion (see section 6.6). This medicinal product must not be mixed 
with other medicinal products. 
Brivaracetam bolus injection or intravenous infusion has not been studied in acute conditions; e.g. 
status epilepticus and is therefore not recommended for such conditions. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or other pyrrolidone derivatives or to any of the excipients 
listed in section 6.1.  
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Suicidal ideation and behaviour 
Suicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic drugs 
(AEDs), including brivaracetam, in several indications. A meta-analysis of randomized placebo-
controlled clinical studiesof AEDs has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and 
behaviour. The mechanism of this risk is not known and the available data do not exclude the 
possibility of an increased risk for brivaracetam. 
Patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate treatment 
should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical advice 
should any signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge. See also section 4.8, paediatric data. 
Hepatic impairment 
There are limited clinical data on the use of brivaracetam in patients with pre-existing hepatic 
impairment. Dose adjustments are recommended for patients with hepatic impairment (see section 
4.2). 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains 19.1 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 1 % of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.

Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Formal interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
Concomitant treatment with levetiracetam 
In the clinical studies, although the numbers were limited, there was no observed benefit of 
brivaracetam versus placebo in patients taking levetiracetam concurrently. No additional safety or 
tolerability concern was observed (see section 5.1). 
Interaction with alcohol 
In a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction study between brivaracetam 200 mg single 
dose and ethanol 0.6 g/L continuous infusion in healthy subjects, there was no pharmacokinetic 
interaction, but brivaracetam approximately doubled the effect of alcohol on psychomotor function, 
attention and memory. Intake of brivaracetam with alcohol is not recommended. 
Pharmacokinetic interactions 
Effects of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of brivaracetam 
In vitro data suggest that brivaracetam has a low interaction potential. The main disposition pathway 
of brivaracetam is by CYP-independent hydrolysis. A second disposition pathway involves 
hydroxylation mediated by CYP2C19 (see section 5.2).  
Brivaracetam plasma concentrations may increase when coadministered with CYP2C19 strong 
inhibitors (e.g. fluconazole, fluvoxamine), but the risk of a clinically relevant CYP2C19-mediated 
interaction is considered to be low. Limited clinical data are available implying that coadministration 
of cannabidiol may increase the plasma exposure of brivaracetam, possibly through CYP2C19 
inhibition, but the clinical relevance is uncertain. 
Rifampicin 
In healthy subjects, coadministration with the strong enzyme inducer rifampicin (600 mg/day for 
5 days), decreased brivaracetam area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) by 
45 %. Prescribers should consider adjusting the brivaracetam dose in patients starting or ending 
treatment with rifampicin.  
Strong enzyme inducing AEDs 
Brivaracetam plasma concentrations are decreased when coadministered with strong enzyme inducing 
AEDs (carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin) but no dose adjustment is required (see table 1).  
Other enzyme inducers 
Other strong enzyme inducers (such as St John´s wort (Hypericum perforatum)) may also decrease the 
systemic exposure of brivaracetam. Therefore, starting or ending treatment with St John’s wort should 
be done with caution. 
Effects of brivaracetam on other medicinal products  
Brivaracetam given 50 or 150 mg/day did not affect the AUC of midazolam (metabolised by 
CYP3A4). The risk of clinically relevant CYP3A4 interactions is considered to be low. 
In vitro studies have shown that brivaracetam exhibits little or no inhibition of CYP450 isoforms 
except for CYP2C19. Brivaracetam may increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products 
metabolised by CYP2C19 (e.g. lanzoprazole, omeprazole, diazepam). When tested in vitro 
brivaracetam did not induce CYP1A1/2 but induced CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. No CYP3A4 induction 
was found in vivo (see midazolam above). CYP2B6 induction has not been investigated in vivo and 
brivaracetam may decrease plasma concentrations of medicinal products metabolised by CYP2B6 
(e.g. efavirenz). In vitro, interaction studies to determine the potential inhibitory effects on transporters 
concluded that there were no clinically relevant effects, except for OAT3. In vitro, brivaracetam 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
inhibits OAT3 with a half maximal inhibitory concentration 42-fold higher than the Cmax at the highest 
clinical dose. Brivaracetam 200mg/day may increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products 
transported by OAT3. 
Antiepileptic drugs 
Potential interactions between brivaracetam (50 mg/day to 200 mg/day) and other AEDs were 
investigated in a pooled analysis of plasma drug concentrations from all phase 2-3 studies in a 
population pharmacokinetic analysis of placebo-controlled phase 2-3 clinical studies, and in dedicated 
drug-drug interaction studies (for the following AEDs: carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenytoin and 
topiramate). The effect of the interactions on the plasma concentration is summarised in table 1 
(increase is indicated as “↑” and decrease as “↓”, area under the plasma concentration versus time 
curve as “AUC”, maximum observed concentration as Cmax).

Carbamazepine  
Brivaracetam is a moderate reversible inhibitor of epoxide hydrolase resulting in an increased 
concentration of carbamazepine epoxide, an active metabolite of carbamazepine. In controlled clinical 
studies, the carbamazepine epoxide plasma concentration increased by a mean of 37 %, 62 % and 
98 % with little variability at brivaracetam doses of 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day and 200 mg/day 
respectively. No safety risks were observed. There was no additive effect of brivaracetam and 
valproate on the AUC of carbamazepine epoxide. 
Oral contraceptives 
Co-administration of brivaracetam (100 mg/day) with an oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol 
(0.03 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.15 mg) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of either substance. 
When brivaracetam was coadministered at a dose of 400 mg/day (twice the recommended maximum 
daily dose) with an oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol (0.03 mg) and levonorgestrel 
(0.15 mg), a reduction in oestrogen and progestin AUCs of 27 % and 23 %, respectively, was observed 
without impact on suppression of ovulation. There was generally no change in the concentration-time 
profiles of the endogenous markers estradiol, progesterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
stimulating hormone (FSH), and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential  
Physicians should discuss family planning and contraception with women of childbearing potential 
taking brivaracetam (see Pregnancy). 
If a woman decides to become pregnant, the use of brivaracetam should be carefully re-evaluated. 
Pregnancy 
Risk related to epilepsy and antiepileptic medicinal products in general 
For all anti-epileptic drugs, it has been shown that in the offspring of treated women with epilepsy, the 
prevalence of malformations is two to three times greater than the rate of approximately 3 % in the 
general population. In the treated population, an increase in malformations has been noted with 
polytherapy; however, the extent to which the treatment and/or the underlying condition is responsible 
has not been elucidated. Discontinuation of anti-epileptic treatments may result in exacerbation of the 
disease which could be harmful to the mother and the foetus. 
Risk related to brivaracetam 
There is a limited amount of data from the use of brivaracetam in pregnant women. There is no data on 
placental transfer in humans, but brivaracetam was shown to readily cross the placenta in rats (see 
section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Animal studies did not detect any teratogenic 
potential of brivaracetam (see section 5.3). 
In clinical studies, brivaracetam was used as adjunctive therapy and when it was used with 
carbamazepine, it induced a dose-related increase in the concentration of the active metabolite, 
carbamazepine-epoxide (see section 4.5). There is insufficient data to determine the clinical 
significance of this effect in pregnancy. 
As a precautionary measure, brivaracetam should not be used during pregnancy unless clinically 
necessary i.e. (if the benefit to the mother clearly outweighs the potential risk to the foetus). 
Breast-feeding 
Brivaracetam is excreted in human breast milk. A decision should be made whether to discontinue 
breastfeeding or to discontinue brivaracetam, taking into account the benefit of the medicinal product 
to the mother. In case of co-administration of brivaracetam and carbamazepine, the amount of 
carbamazepine-epoxide excreted in breast milk could increase. There is insufficient data to determine 
the clinical significance. 
Fertility 
No human data on the effect of brivaracetam on fertility are available. In rats, there was no effect on 
fertility with brivaracetam (see section 5.3).  
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Brivaracetam has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Due to possible differences in individual sensitivity some patients might experience somnolence, 
dizziness, and other central nervous system (CNS) related symptoms. Patients should be advised not to 
drive a car or to operate other potentially hazardous machines until they are familiar with the effects of 
brivaracetam on their ability to perform such activities.

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions (>10%) with brivaracetam treatment were: somnolence 
(14.3 %) and dizziness (11.0 %). They were usually mild to moderate in intensity. Somnolence and 
fatigue were reported at a higher incidence with increasing dose. 
The discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 3.5 %, 3.4 % and 4.0 % for patients randomized 
to brivaracetam at respectively the dose of 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day and 200 mg/day and 1.7 % for 
patients randomized to placebo. The adverse reactions most frequently resulting in discontinuation of 
brivaracetam therapy were dizziness (0.8 %) and convulsion (0.8 %).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Neutropenia has been reported in 0.5 % (6/1,099) brivaracetam patients and 0 % (0/459) placebo 
patients. Four of these subjects had decreased neutrophil counts at baseline, and experienced 
additional decrease in neutrophil counts after initiation of brivaracetam treatment. None of the 6 cases 
of neutropenia were severe, required any specific treatment or led to discontinuation of brivaracetam 
and none had associated infections. 
Suicidal ideation has been reported in 0.3 % (3/1,099) brivaracetam patients and 0.7 % (3/459) 
placebo patients. In the short-term clinical studies of brivaracetam in epilepsy patients, there were no 
cases of completed suicide and suicide attempt, however both have been reported in open-label 
extension studies(see section 4.4). 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reactions suggestive of immediate (Type I) hypersensitivity have been reported in a small number of 
brivaracetam patients (9/3022) during clinical development. 
Adverse reactions with intravenous administration generally appeared to be similar to those observed 
with oral administration. Intravenous administration was associated with infusion site pain in 2.8 % of 
the patients. 
Paediatric population 
The safety profile of brivaracetam observed in children from 1 month of age was consistent with the 
safety profile observed in adults. In the open label, uncontrolled, long-term studies suicidal ideation 
was reported in 4.7 % of paediatric patients (assessed from 6 years onwards, more common in 
adolescents) compared with 2.4 % of adults and behavioural disorders were reported in 24.8 % of 
paediatric patients compared with 15.1 % of adults. The majority of events were mild or moderate in 
intensity, were non-serious, and did not lead to discontinuation of study drug. An additional adverse 
reaction reported in children was psychomotor hyperactivity (4.7 %).  
No specific pattern of adverse event (AE) was identified in children from 1◦month to < 4◦years of age 
when compared to older paediatric age groups. No significant safety information was identified 
indicating the increasing incidence of a particular AE in this age group. As data available in children 
younger than 2 years of age is limited, brivaracetam is not indicated in this age range. Limited clinical 
data are available in neonates. 
Elderly  
Of the 130 elderly subjects enrolled in the brivaracetam phase 2/3 development program (44 with 
epilepsy), 100 were 65-74 years of age and 30 were 75-84 years of age. The safety profile in elderly 
patients appears to be similar to that observed in younger adult patients. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms 
There is limited clinical experience with brivaracetam overdose in humans. Somnolence and dizziness 
have been reported in a healthy subject taking a single dose of 1,400 mg of brivaracetam. 
The following adverse reactions were reported with brivaracetam overdose: nausea, vertigo, balance 
disorder, anxiety, fatigue, irritability, aggression, insomnia, depression, and suicidal ideation in the 
post-marketing experience. In general, the adverse reactions associated with brivaracetam overdose 
were consistent with the known adverse reactions. 
Management of overdose 
There is no specific antidote for overdose with brivaracetam. Treatment of an overdose should include 
general supportive measures. Since less than 10 % of brivaracetam is excreted in urine, haemodialysis 
is not expected to significantly enhance brivaracetam clearance (see section 5.2).

Pharmacotherapeutic group: antiepileptics, other antiepileptics, ATC code: N03AX23  
Mechanism of action 
Brivaracetam displays a high and selective affinity for synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A), a 
transmembrane glycoprotein found at presynaptic level in neurons and in endocrine cells. Although 
the exact role of this protein remains to be elucidated it has been shown to modulate exocytosis of 
neurotransmitters. Binding to SV2A is believed to be the primary mechanism for brivaracetam 
anticonvulsant activity. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy of brivaracetam for the adjunctive therapy of partial onset seizures (POS) was established 
in 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose, multi-center clinical studies in subjects 
16 years of age and older. The daily dose of brivaracetam ranged from 5 to 200 mg/day across these 
studies. All studies had an 8-week baseline period followed by a 12-week treatment period with no up-
titration. 1,558 patients received study drug of which 1,099 received brivaracetam. Study enrollment 
criteria required that patients have uncontrolled POS despite treatment with either 1 or 2 concomitant 
AEDs. Patients were required to have at least 8 POS during the baseline period. The primary endpoints 
in the phase 3 studies were the percent reduction in POS frequency over placebo and the 50 % 
responder rate based on 50 % reduction in POS frequency from baseline. 
The most commonly taken AEDs at the time of study entry were carbamazepine (40.6 %), lamotrigine 
(25.2 %), valproate (20.5 %), oxcarbazepine (16.0 %), topiramate (13.5 %), phenytoin (10.2 %) and 
levetiracetam (9.8 %). The median baseline seizure frequency across the 3 studies was 9 seizures per 
28 days. Patients had a mean duration of epilepsy of approximately 23 years. 
The efficacy outcomes are summarized in Table 2. Overall, brivaracetam was efficacious for the 
adjunctive treatment of partial onset seizures in patients 16 years of age and older between 50 mg/day 
and 200 mg/day.

(2) The primary outcome for N01252 did not achieve statistical significance based on the sequential 
testing procedure, The 100 mg/day dose was nominally significant. 
In clinical studies, a reduction in seizure frequency over placebo was higher with the dose of 
100 mg/day than with 50 mg/day. Apart from dose-dependent increases in incidences of somnolence 
and fatigue, brivaracetam 50 mg/day and 100 mg/day had a similar safety profile including CNS-
related AEs and with long-term use. 
Figure 1 shows the percentage of patients (excluding patients with concomitant levetiracetam) by 
category of reduction from baseline in POS frequency per 28 days in all 3 studies. Patients with more 
than a 25 % increase in POS are shown at left as “worse”. Patients with an improvement in percent 
reduction in baseline POS frequency are shown in the 4 right-most categories. The percentages of 
patients with at least a 50 % reduction in seizure frequency were 20.3 %, 34.2 %, 39.5 %, and 37.8 % 
for placebo, 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day, and 200 mg/day, respectively.   
Figure 1:  Proportion of patients by category of seizure response for brivaracetam and placebo over 
12 weeks across all three double-blind pivotal clinical studies 
In a pooled analysis of the three pivotal clinical studies, no differences in efficacy (measured as 50 % 
responder rate) was observed within the dose range of 50 mg/day to 200 mg/day when brivaracetam is 
combined with inducing or non-inducing AEDs. In clinical studies 2.5 % (4/161), 5.1 % (17/332) and 
4.0% (10/249) of the patients on brivaracetam 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day and 200 mg/day respectively 
became seizure free during the 12-week treatment period compared with 0.5 % (2/418) on placebo.  
Improvement in the median percent reduction in seizure frequency per 28 days has been observed in 
patients with type IC seizure (secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizures) at baseline treated with 
brivaracetam (66.6 % (n=62), 61.2 % (n=100) and 82.1 % (n=75) of the patients on brivaracetam 
50 mg/day, 100 mg/day and 200 mg/day respectively as compared to placebo 33.3 % (n=115)).  
The efficacy of brivaracetam in monotherapy has not been established. Brivaracetam is not 
recommended for use in monotherapy.  
Treatment with levetiracetam 
In two phase 3 randomised placebo-controlled clinical studies, levetiracetam was administered as 
concomitant AED in about 20 % of the patients. Although the number of subjects is limited, there was 
no observed benefit of brivaracetam versus placebo in patients taking levetiracetam concurrently 
48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
which may reflect competition at the SV2A binding site. No additional safety or tolerability concerns 
were observed. 
In a third study, a pre-specified analysis demonstrated efficacy over placebo for 100 mg/day and 200 
mg/day in patients with prior exposure to levetiracetam. The lower efficacy observed in these patients 
compared to the leveticacetam-naïve patients was likely due to the higher number of prior AEDs used 
and higher baseline seizure frequency. 
Elderly (65 years of age and above) 
The three pivotal double-blind placebo-controlled clinical studies included 38 elderly patients aged 
between 65 and 80 years. Although data are limited, the efficacy was comparable to younger subjects. 
Open label extension studies 
Across all studies, 81.7 % of the patients who completed randomized studies were enrolled in the 
long-term open-label extension studies. From entry into the randomized studies,5.3 % of the subjects 
exposed to brivaracetam for 6 months (n=1,500) were seizure free compared to 4.6 % and 3.7 % for 
subjects exposed for 12 months (n=1,188) and 24 months (n=847), respectively. However, as a high 
proportion of subjects (26%) discontinued from the open-label studies due to lack of efficacy, a 
selection bias may have occurred, as the subjects who stayed in the study responded better than those 
who have terminated prematurely. 
In patients who were followed up in the open-label extension studies for up to 8 years, the safety 
profile was similar to that observed in the short-term, placebo-controlled clinical studies.  
Paediatric population 
In children aged 2 years and older, partial onset seizures have a similar pathophysiology to those in 
adolescents and adults. Experience with epilepsy medicines suggests that the results of efficacy studies 
performed in adults can be extrapolated to children down to the age of 2 years provided the paediatric 
dose adaptations are established and safety has been demonstrated (see sections 5.2 and 4.8). Doses in 
patients from 2 years of age were defined by weight-based dose adaptations which have been 
established to achieve similar plasma concentrations to the ones observed in adults taking efficacious 
doses (section 5.2).  
A long-term, uncontrolled, open-label safety study included children (from 1 month of age to less than 
16 years) who continued treatment after completing the PK study (see section 5.2), children who 
continued treatment after completing the i.v. (intravenous) safety study and children directly enrolled 
into the safety study. Children who directly enrolled received a brivaracetam starting dose of 
1 mg/kg/day and depending on response and tolerability, the dose was increased up to 5 mg/kg/day by 
doubling the dose at weekly intervals. No child received a dose greater than 200 mg/day. For children 
weighing 50 kg or greater the brivaracetam starting dose was 50 mg/day and depending on response 
and tolerability, the dose was increased up to a maximum of 200 mg/day by weekly increments of 
50 mg/day.  
From the pooled open-label safety and PK studies in adjunctive therapy, 186 children with POS in the 
age range of 1 month < 16 years of age have received brivaracetam, of whom 149 have been treated 
for ≥ 3 months, 138 for ≥ 6 months, 123 for ≥ 12 months, 107 for ≥ 24 months, and 90 for 
≥ 36 months. 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
brivaracetam in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in epilepsy with partial onset seizures 
(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Brivaracetam film-coated tablets, oral solution and solution for intravenous injection show the same 
AUC, while the maximum plasma concentration is slightly higher after intravenous administration. 
Brivaracetam exhibits linear and time-independent pharmacokinetics with low intra- and inter-subject 
49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
variability, and features complete absorption, very low protein binding, renal excretion following 
extensive biotransformation, and pharmacologically inactive metabolites.  
Absorption 
Brivaracetam is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration and the absolute 
bioavailablity is approximately 100 %. The median tmax for tablets taken without food is 1 hour (tmax 
range is 0.25 to 3 h).  
Coadministration with a high-fat meal slowed down the absorption rate (median tmax 3 h) and 
decreased the maximum plasma concentration (37 % lower) of brivaracetam, while the extent of 
absorption remained unchanged. 
Distribution 
Brivaracetam is weakly bound (≤ 20 %) to plasma proteins. The volume of distribution is 0.5 L/kg, a 
value close to that of the total body water. 
Due to its lipophylicity (Log P) brivaracetam has high cell membrane permeability.  
Biotransformation 
Brivaracetam is primarily metabolized by hydrolysis of the amide moiety to form the corresponding 
carboxylic acid (approximately 60 % the elimination), and secondarily by hydroxylation on the propyl 
side chain (approximately 30 % the elimination). The hydrolysis of the amide moiety leading to the 
carboxylic acid metabolite (34 % of the dose in urine) is supported by hepatic and extra-hepatic 
amidase. In vitro, the hydroxylation of brivaracetam is mediated primarily by CYP2C19. Both 
metabolites, are further metabolised forming a common hydroxylated acid formed predominantly by 
hydroxylation of the propyl side chain on the carboxylic acid metabolite (mainly by CYP2C9). In vivo, 
in human subjects possessing ineffective mutations of CYP2C19, production of the hydroxy 
metabolite is decreased 10-fold while brivaracetam itself is increased by 22 % or 42 % in individuals 
with one or both mutated alleles. The three metabolites are not pharmacologically active. 
Elimination 
Brivaracetam is eliminated primarily by metabolism and by excretion in the urine. More than 95 % of 
the dose, including metabolites, is excreted in the urine within 72 hours after intake. Less than 1 % of 
the dose is excreted in faeces and less than 10 % of brivaracetam is excreted unchanged in urine. The 
terminal plasma half-life (t1/2) is approximately 9 hours. The total plasma clearance in patients was 
estimated to 3.6 L/h.  
Linearity 
Pharmacokinetics is dose-proportional from 10 to at least 600 mg. 
Interactions with medicinal products 
Brivaracetam is cleared by multiple pathways including renal excretion, non-CYP-mediated 
hydrolysis and CYP-mediated oxidations. In vitro, brivaracetam is not a substrate of human P-
glycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug resistance proteins (MRP) 1 and 2, and likely not organic anion 
transporter polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) and OATP1B3. 
In vitro assays showed that brivaracetam disposition should not be significantly affected by CYP (eg. 
CYP1A, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) inhibitors. 
In vitro, brivaracetam was not an inhibitor of the CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2D6, CYP3A4, or the transporters P-gp, BCRP, BSEP MRP2, MATE-K, MATE-1, OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, OAT1 and OCT1 at clinically relevant concentrations. In vitro, brivaracetam did not 
induce CYP1A2.

Pharmacokinetics in special patient groups 
Elderly (65 years of age and above) 
In a study in elderly subjects (65 to79 years old; with creatinine clearance 53 to 98 ml/min/1.73 m²) 
receiving brivaracetam 400 mg/day in bid administration, the plasma half-life of brivaracetam was 
7.9 hours and 9.3 hours in the 65 to 75 and >75 years groups, respectively. The steady-state plasma 
clearance of brivaracetam was similar (0.76 ml/min/kg) to young healthy male subjects 
(0.83 ml/min/kg). (see section 4.2). 
Renal impairment 
A study in subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min/1.73 m² and not 
requiring dialysis) revealed that the plasma AUC of brivaracetam was moderately increased (+21 %) 
relative to healthy controls, while the AUC of the acid, hydroxy and hydroxyacid metabolites were 
increased 3-, 4-, and 21-fold, respectively. The renal clearance of these non active metabolites was 
decreased 10-fold. The hydroxyacid metabolite did not reveal any safety concerns in non clinical 
studies. Brivaracetam has not been studied in patients undergoing hemodialysis (see section 4.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
A pharmacokinetic study in subjects with hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh classes A, B, and C) showed 
similar increases in exposure to brivaracetam irrespective of disease severity (50 %, 57 % and 59 %), 
relative to matched healthy controls. (see section 4.2). 
Body weight 
A 40 % decrease in steady-state plasma concentration has been estimated across a body weight range 
from 46 kg to 115 kg. However, this is not considered to be a clinically relevant difference.  
Gender 
There are no clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of brivaracetam by gender. 
Race 
The pharmacokinetics of brivaracetam was not significantly affected by race (Caucasian, , Asian) in a 
population pharmacokinetic modeling from epilepsy patients. The number of patients with other ethnic 
background was limited. 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics relationship 
The EC50 (brivaracetam plasma concentration corresponding to 50 % of the maximum effect) was 
estimated to be 0.57 mg/L. This plasma concentration is slightly above the median exposure obtained 
after brivaracetam doses of 50 mg/day. Further seizure frequency reduction is obtained by increasing 
the dose to 100 mg/day and reaches a plateau at 200 mg/day. 
Paediatric population 
In a pharmacokinetic study with a 3-week evaluation period and weekly fixed 3-step up-titration using 
the brivaracetam oral solution, 99 subjects aged 1 month to < 16 years were evaluated. Brivaracetam 
was administered at weekly increasing doses of approximately 1 mg/kg/day, 2 mg/kg/day, and 
4 mg/kg/day. All doses were adjusted by body weight, and did not exceed a maximum of 50 mg/day, 
100 mg/day, and 200 mg/day. At the end of the evaluation period, subjects may have been eligible for 
entry into a long-term follow-up study continuing on their last received dose (see section 4.8). Plasma 
concentrations were shown to be dose-proportional in all age groups. Population pharmacokinetics 
modeling was performed based on sparse plasma concentration data collected in the 3-week PK study 
and the ongoing long-term follow-up study. 232 paediatric patients with epilepsy, aged 2 months to 
17 years, were included in the analysis. The analysis indicated that doses of 5.0 (body weights 10-
20 kg) and 4.0 mg/kg/day (body weights 20-50 kg) provide the same steady-state average plasma 
concentration as in adults receiving 200 mg/day. The estimated plasma clearance was 0.96 L/h, 1.61 
L/h, 2.18 L/h and 3.19 L/h for children weighing 10 kg, 20 kg, 30 kg and 50 kg, respectively. In 
comparison, plasma clearance was estimated at 3.58 L/h in adult patients (70 kg body weight).  
51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Currently, no clinical data are available in neonates. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In safety pharmacology studies, the predominant effects were CNS related (mainly transient CNS 
depression and decreased spontaneous locomotor activity) seen at multiples (greater than 50 fold) of 
the pharmacologically active dose of brivaracetam, 2 mg/kg. Learning and memory function were not 
affected.  
Findings not observed in clinical studies, but seen in the repeated-dose toxicology dog studies at 
exposure similar to the clinical plasma AUC, were hepatotoxic effects (mainly porphyria). However, 
toxicological data accumulated on brivaracetam and on a structurally-related compound indicate that 
the dog liver changes have developed through mechanisms not relevant for humans. No adverse liver 
changes were seen in rats and monkeys following chronic administration of brivaracetam at 5- and 42-
fold the clinical AUC exposure. In monkeys, CNS signs (prostrate, loss of balance, clumsy 
movements) occurred at 64 fold the clinical Cmax, these effects being less apparent over time. 
Genotoxicity studies have not detected any mutagenic or clastogenic activity. Carcinogenicity studies 
did not indicate any oncogenic potential in rats, whereas increased incidences of hepatocellular tumors 
in male mice are considered to result of a non-genotoxic, mode of action linked to a phenobarbitone-
like liver enzyme induction, which is a known rodent specific phenomenon.  
Brivaracetam did not affect male or female fertility and has demonstrated no teratogenic potential in 
either rat or rabbit. Embryotoxicity was observed in rabbits at a maternal toxic dose of brivaracetam 
with an exposure level 8-fold the clinical AUC exposure at the maximum recommended dose. In rats, 
brivaracetam was shown to readily cross the placenta and to be excreted in milk of lactating rats with 
concentrations similar to maternal plasma levels. 
Brivaracetam did not show any dependence potential in rats. 
Juvenile animals studies 
In juvenile rats, brivaracetam exposure levels 6- to 15-fold the clinical AUC exposure at the maximum 
recommended dose induced developmental adverse effects (i.e. mortality, clinical signs, decreased 
body weight and lower brain weight). There were no adverse effects on CNS function, 
neuropathological and brain histopathological examination. In juvenile dogs, the brivaracetam-induced 
changes at the exposure level 6- fold the clinical AUC were similar to those observed in adult animals. 
There were no adverse effects in any of the standard developmental or maturation endpoints.

1.  What Briviact is and what it is used for 
What Briviact is 
Briviact contains the active substance brivaracetam. It belongs to a group of medicines called 
‘anti-epileptics’. These medicines are used to treat epilepsy. 
What Briviact is used for 
• 
• 
Briviact is used in adults, adolescents and children from 2 years of age. 
It is used to treat a type of epilepsy that has partial seizures with or without a secondary 
generalisation.  
Partial seizures are fits that start by only affecting one side of the brain. These partial seizures 
can spread and extend to larger areas on both sides of the brain – this is called a ‘secondary 
generalisation’.  
You have been given this medicine to lower the number of fits (seizures) you have.  
Briviact is used together with other medicines for epilepsy. 
• 
• 
• 
2.  What you need to know before you take Briviact  
Do not take Briviact if: 
- 
you are allergic to brivaracetam, other similar chemical compounds as levetiracetam or 
piracetam or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). If you are not 
sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Briviact.  
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Briviact if: 
- 
You have thoughts of harming or killing yourself. A small number of people being treated with 
anti-epileptic medicines such as Briviact have had thoughts of harming or killing themselves. If 
you have any of these thoughts at any time, contact your doctor immediately.

1.  What Briviact is and what it is used for 
What Briviact is 
Briviact contains the active substance brivaracetam. It belongs to a group of medicines called 
‘anti-epileptics’. These medicines are used to treat epilepsy. 
What Briviact is used for 
• 
• 
Briviact is used in adults, adolescents and children from 2 years of age. 
It is used to treat a type of epilepsy that has partial seizures with or without a secondary 
generalisation.  
Partial seizures are fits that start by only affecting one side of the brain. These partial seizures 
can spread and extend to larger areas on both sides of the brain – this is called a ‘secondary 
generalisation’.  
You have been given this medicine to lower the number of fits (seizures) you have.  
Briviact is used together with other medicines for epilepsy. 
• 
• 
• 
2.  What you need to know before you take Briviact

- 
you are allergic to brivaracetam, other similar chemical compounds as levetiracetam or 
piracetam or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). If you are not 
sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Briviact.  
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Briviact if: 
- 
You have thoughts of harming or killing yourself. A small number of people being treated with 
anti-epileptic medicines such as Briviact have had thoughts of harming or killing themselves. If 
you have any of these thoughts at any time, contact your doctor immediately. 
You have liver problems - your doctor may need to adjust your dose.

In particular, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines – this is because your 
doctor may need to adjust your Briviact dose: 
-

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or planning to have a baby, ask your

It is not recommended to take Briviact if you are pregnant, as the effects of Briviact on pregnancy and 
the unborn baby are not known. 
It is not recommended to breast-feed your baby while taking Briviact, as Briviact passes into breast 
milk. 
Do not stop treatment without talking to your doctor first. Stopping treatment could increase your 
seizures and harm your baby.

How to take Briviact oral solution 
- 
You can take Briviact oral solution on its own, or dilute it in water or juice shortly before 
swallowing.  
The medicine may be taken with or without food.  
- 
Instructions for use for patients or carers: 
Two oral syringes will be provided in the carton. Check with your doctor which one you should use.  
- 
For volume between 0.5 ml and 5 ml, you should use the 5 ml oral syringe (blue graduation 
marks) provided in the carton to ensure accurate dosing. 
For volume above 5 ml and up to 10 ml, you should use the 10 ml oral syringe (black 
graduation marks) provided in the carton to ensure accurate dosing. 
- 
5 ml oral dosing syringe   
The 5 ml oral syringe has 2 overlapping blue 
graduation marks: in steps of 0.25 ml and in 
steps of 0.1 ml. 
10 ml oral dosing syringe   
The 10 ml oral syringe has black graduation 
marks in steps of 0.25 ml. 
-  Open the bottle: press the cap and turn it anti-clockwise (figure 1). 
Follow these steps the first time you take Briviact:  
-  Take off the adaptor from the oral syringe (figure 2).  
-  Put the adaptor into the top of the bottle (figure 3). Make sure it is fixed well in place. You do 
not need to remove the adaptor after use. 
109 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Follow these steps each time you take Briviact: 
-  Put the oral syringe into the adaptor opening (figure 4).  
-  Turn the bottle upside down (figure 5). 
-  Hold the bottle upside down in one hand and use the other hand to fill the oral syringe. 
-  Pull the plunger down to fill the oral syringe with a small amount of solution (figure 6). 
-  Then push the plunger up to remove any possible air bubbles (figure 7).  
-  Pull the plunger down to the millilitre (ml) dose marker on the oral syringe prescribed by your 
doctor (figure 8). The plunger may rise back up the barrel on the first dosage. Therefore, 
ensure that the plunger is kept in position until the oral syringe is disconnected from the bottle. 
-  Turn the bottle the right way up (figure 9).  
-  Take the oral syringe out of the adaptor (figure 10). 
110 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
     
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There are two ways in which you can choose to drink the medicine: 
- 
- 
empty the contents of the syringe into water (or juice) by pushing the plunger to the bottom of 
the oral syringe (figure 11) – you will then need to drink all of the water (add just enough to 
make it easy to drink) or 
drink the solution directly from the oral syringe without water – drink the whole contents of 
the syringe (figure 12). 
-  Close the bottle with the plastic screw cap (you do not need to remove the adaptor). 
-  To clean the oral syringe, rinse with cold water only, moving the plunger several times up and 
down to take up and expel the water, without separating the two components of the syringe 
(figure 13). 
-  Keep the bottle, the oral syringe, and the leaflet in the carton.

1.  What Briviact is and what it is used for 
What Briviact is 
Briviact contains the active substance brivaracetam. It belongs to a group of medicines called 
‘anti-epileptics’. These medicines are used to treat epilepsy. 
What Briviact is used for 
• 
• 
Briviact is used in adults, adolescents and children from 2 years of age. 
It is used to treat a type of epilepsy that has partial seizures with or without a secondary 
generalisation.  
Partial seizures are fits that start by only affecting one side of the brain. These partial seizures 
can spread and extend to larger areas on both sides of the brain – this is called a ‘secondary 
generalisation’.  
You have been given this medicine to lower the number of fits (seizures) you have.  
Briviact is used together with other medicines for epilepsy. 
• 
• 
• 
2.  What you need to know before you take Briviact  
Do not use Briviact if: 
- 
you are allergic to brivaracetam, other similar chemical compounds as levetiracetam or 
piracetam or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). If you are not 
sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Briviact. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Briviact if: 
- 
You have thoughts of harming or killing yourself. A small number of people being treated with 
anti-epileptic medicines such as Briviact have had thoughts of harming or killing themselves. If 
you have any of these thoughts at any time, contact your doctor immediately. 
You have liver problems - your doctor may need to adjust your dose. 
- 
Children  
Briviact is not recommended for use in children under 2 years of age. 
115 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other medicines and Briviact 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
In particular, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines – this is because your 
doctor may need to adjust your Briviact dose: 
- 
- 
Rifampicin - a medicine used to treat bacterial infections. 
St John’s wort (also known as Hypericum perforatum) - a herbal medicine used to treat 
depression and anxiety as well as other conditions. 
Briviact with alcohol 
- 
- 
Combining this medicine with alcohol is not recommended.  
If you drink alcohol while taking Briviact the negative effects of alcohol may be increased.  
Pregnancy and breast-feeding

If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
It is not recommended to take Briviact if you are pregnant, as the effects of Briviact on pregnancy and 
the unborn baby are not known.  
It is not recommended to breast-feed your baby while taking Briviact, as Briviact passes into breast 
milk. 
Do not stop treatment without talking to your doctor first. Stopping treatment could increase your 
seizures and harm your baby. 
Driving and using machines 
- 
- 
- 
You may feel sleepy, dizzy or tired while using Briviact.

1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Introduction 
Intelence (etravirine) is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) of human 
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). On 28 August 2008, the European Commission issued a 
conditional Marketing Authorisation (MA) for Intelence based on a positive Opinion adopted by the 
CHMP on 26 June 2008 for the following indication: 
“INTELENCE, in combination with a boosted protease inhibitor and other antiretroviral medicinal 
products, is indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in 
antiretroviral treatment-experienced adult patients. 
This indication is based on week 48 analyses from 2 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
Phase III trials in highly pre-treated patients with viral strains harbouring mutations of resistance to 
non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors, where INTELENCE was 
investigated in combination with an optimised background regimen (OBR) which included 
darunavir/ritonavir” 
The indication was based on Week 24 analyses from 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
phase III studies (DUET-1 and DUET-2) in highly pre-treated patients with viral strains harboring 
mutations of resistance to NNRTIs and PIs, where ETR was investigated in combination with a 
background regimen which included DRV/rtv. These studies showed that ETR is able to provide an 
adequate virologic response in this patient population, however additional clinical data was considered 
necessary by the CHMP to further substantiate the durability of virologic response and to confirm the 
use of ETR in combination with ritonavir-boosted PIs other than DRV/rtv. Consequently, a conditional 
MA with specific obligations was issued.  
In order to address the lacking data the applicant, at the time of the initial MA, undertook specific 
obligations. 
Intelence is available as 100 and 200 mg film-coated tablet. The recommended dose of Intelence is 
200 mg taken orally twice daily following a meal. 
1.2.  Quality aspects 
1.2.1.  Introduction 
Intelence 25 mg immediate release tablets are presented as white to off-white, oval scored tablets 
with “TMC” on one side, containing 25 mg etravirine. The tablets are un-coated, can be divided into 
equal doses and are water dispersible. 
The list of excipients can be found in section 6.1 of the SmPC. The tablets are presented in white, high-
density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with child-resistant, polypropylene (PP) closures lined with an 
induction seal. Two silica gel pouches are added as desiccant. Each bottle contains 120 tablets.

1.2.2.  Active Substance 
Etravirine, the active substance in Intelence 25 mg tablets is identical to the active substance in the 
authorized Intelence 100 mg and 200 mg tablets (EU/1/08/468/001-002). The crystalline drug 
substance is classified as a BCS class IV compound. During the drug product manufacturing process, 
the crystalline drug substance is transformed into the amorphous form to allow absorption of the active 
substance in vivo. For information on the active substance reference is made to Module 3.2.S of the 
marketing authorisation of the 100 mg and 200 mg strengths and subsequent quality variations. The 
active substance specifications are the same as for the 100 mg and 200 mg tablets.  
1.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The aim was to develop a paediatric formulation for Intelence, suitable for use in children and 
adolescents from 6 years up to 18 years. In order to provide the HIV-1 infected children and 
adolescents with the appropriate dose regimen of etravirine, an additional tablet strength of 25 mg had 
to be developed. The proposed 25 mg tablet is scored and allows flexible and accurate dosing (dose 
increments of 12.5 mg) in paediatric patients in case this would be needed in the future.  A tablet 
breakability test has been performed. The paediatric tablet is dose and weight proportional to the 
commercially available 100 mg tablet. The two products were compared in a bioequivalence study. The 
25 mg tablet can be dispersed in water or in water and subsequently diluted with either orange juice, 
milk products or prepared instant infant formula. 
The 25 mg tablet contains the same excipients as the 100 mg tablet: hypromellose (stabilizer), 
microcrystalline cellulose (carrier/filler), colloidal anhydrous silica (glidant), croscarmellose sodium 
(disintegrant), magnesium stearate (lubricant) and lactose monohydrate (filler). These excipients are 
standard excipients for immediate release formulations. The excipients are all of pharmacopoeial grade 
and acceptable for use in the paediatric population. For a discussion on the results of the taste 
acceptability test, reference is made to the clinical part of this assessment report. 
A study was performed to evaluate the in-use compatibility of the 25 mg tablets when dispersed in 
different types of beverages. The results showed that the tablet should be dispersed in water only in 
case the patient is unable to swallow the tablet. A recommended dispersion procedure has been 
included in section 6.6 of the SmPC.  
No formulation changes have been made between the Intelence 25 mg tablets tested in the paediatric 
clinical trials, the registration/validation batches tablets, and the proposed commercial tablets. All 
batches were manufactured at the proposed commercial manufacturing site. 
The suitability of the container closure system used for drug product has been established through 
stability testing. The chosen container closure system is similar to the one used for the commercially 
available 100 mg tablets. The bottle size and amount of desiccant were adjusted to the size of the 
25 mg tablets.  
Adventitious agents 
The only excipient of animal origin used in the manufacture of the drug product is lactose 
monohydrate. It is confirmed that the lactose is produced only from milk sourced from healthy animals 
in the same conditions as milk collected for human consumption and the lactose is prepared without 
the use of other ruminant materials than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising

the Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Via Human and Veterinary medicinal 
products. 
Manufacture of the product 
Intelence 25 mg tablets are dose and weigh proportional to the commercially available Intelence 
100 mg tablets and the manufacturing process is based on that of the 100 mg tablets. The main 
manufacturing steps are: preparation of the spraying solution, spray drying, post drying, blending, 
roller compaction, blending and tablet compression.  
The upstream process (spray suspension preparation, spray drying and post drying) is identical to that 
of the 100 mg tablets; the process includes a design space for the spray drying and post-drying. The 
spray dried drug substance is considered as an intermediate product and an adequate control 
monograph has been proposed. 
The downstream process includes: mixing of the spray dried dispersion with a portion of 
croscarmellose sodium, roller compaction of the mixture, addition and mixing of the other excipients, 
addition of the external phase, tableting and packaging. Two process flows and batch sizes (160 and 
560 kg) are used in the downstream process. The 25-mg tablets can be prepared from a 160 kg final 
blend or from a portion of the 560 kg final blend prepared for the 100-mg tablets. For the smaller 
batch size (160 kg), the downstream process is identical to that of the commercially available 100 mg 
tablets, apart from the scale, the size of the blending bins and the compression process step. For the 
larger batch size (560 kg), the 25 mg tablets are produced starting from the final blend prepared for 
the commercially available 100 mg tablets. A target portion of 70 kg of this final blend is transferred to 
a separate blending bin, blended again and compressed into 25 mg tablets. 
The applicant has identified the critical manufacturing steps in the manufacturing process, and has 
adequate in-process controls in place. The manufacturing process has been adequately validated and 
demonstrates to reproducibly produce a finished product of the intended quality.  
Batch analysis data have been presented for three validation batches and for clinical trial batches and 
demonstrate that the tablets can be manufactured reproducibly according to the agreed finished 
product specification.  
Product specification 
The Intelence 25 mg tablets release specifications include tests for appearance (visual inspection), 
identity (HPLC, IR), assay (HPLC - 95.0%-105.0% of label claim), chromatographic purity (HPLC), 
dissolution, water content, uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), crystallinity (XRD) and microbiological 
purity (Ph. Eur.). A crystallinity test has been added to the release specifications because the 
crystalline form of the drug substance is not absorbed in vivo.  
The finished product specifications are standard for immediate release tablets. The proposed test 
procedures and acceptance criteria comply with the requirements of the Ph.Eur. and ICH guidelines. All 
tests included in the specification have been satisfactorily described and validated. Appropriate data 
have been presented to justify the release specifications for each quality characteristic that is 
controlled. Impurities and degradation products are acceptable from the safety point of view. Batch 
analysis results comply with the predefined specifications and confirm consistency and uniformity of 
manufacture and indicate that the process is under control.

Stability of the product 
Stability data have been provided for three batches of 25 mg tablets, which have been stored up to 24 
months at 25°C/60%RH and 30ºC/75%RH and 6 months at 40°C/75%RH, according to the ICH 
requirements.  
These batches were manufactured at the proposed manufacturing site, Janssen- Cilag S.p.A., Latina, 
Italy and packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. The parameters tested and 
analytical methods used in the stability studies are identical to those used for the release specifications 
apart from identification, crystallinity and uniformity of dosage units which are tested only at release, 
and the tablet breakability test (Ph.Eur.) which is only performed at the end of shelf-life.  
Supportive data are provided after 3 months storage at 50°C and after 8 hours exposure to light as 
defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. 
Based on the available stability data, the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the 
SmPC are acceptable. 
In addition, an in-use stability study simulating the daily use of the medication by the patient (8 weeks 
at 25ºC/60%RH and 30ºC/75%RH) was performed at the start and the end of shelf life. During the 
simulation of the in-use test, an increase in water content was observed and out of specification results 
were recorded on samples stored at 30°C/75%. As the water content is a critical parameter regarding 
the recrystallization of the active substance (and hence the in vivo absorption), the in-use shelf life 
after first opening of 8 weeks had to be reduced to only 6 weeks The CHMP recommends the applicant 
to perform a new in-use stability study using a larger quantity of desiccant or to consider a change of 
primary packaging (blister) in order to extent the in-use shelf life from 6 weeks to 8 weeks. 
The applicant confirmed their plans to conduct additional development studies to further prove the 
robustness of the formulation and packaging configuration with the aim to extend the in-use 
stability. A protocol for this study is under development and would include both open dish and 
simulated in use conditions for tablets that contain a high water content with the aim to demonstrate 
that the water content does not impact crystallinity. Alternatively, the applicant will consider 
performing a new in use stability study using additional desiccant in the current bottle. If the data from 
these studies does not allow an extension of the in use period, the 6 week in use period will be 
maintained. 
1.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The Intelence 25 mg tablet is a paediatric formulation for Intelence. The 25 mg tablet is manufactured 
using the same active substance as for the authorised Intelence 100 mg and 200 mg tablets and the 
manufacturing process is based on that of the 100 mg tablets. The 25 mg tablet contains the same 
excipients as the 100 mg. 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were no unresolved quality issues.

1.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on TSE safety.  
1.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development   
The CHMP recommends the applicant to conduct additional development studies (open dish, simulated 
in use or larger quantity of desiccant) with the aim to support an extension of the in use stability from 
6 weeks to 8 weeks.  
1.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
1.3.1.  Introduction 
The applicant submitted a nonclinical overview which integrates the results from all relevant nonclinical 
studies in support of the use of ETR for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in paediatric subjects. No new 
non-clinical juvenile studies were performed as part of this application. 
1.3.2.  Pharmacology 
ETR only weakly interacted with glycine-1 transporter binding sites (inhibition constant (Ki) was 5.4 μM 
(2.4 μg/mL)). At concentrations of 1 (0.44 μg/mL) and 10 µM (4.4 μg/mL) ETR was found to have 
inhibitory effects on nicotinergic nerve-smooth muscle function, but was devoid of muscarinic effects. 
The secondary pharmacodynamics and safety pharmacology program revealed no relevant effects of 
ETR on in vitro and in vivo cardiovascular electrophysiological parameters, respiratory parameters, 
neurobehavior, motor activity or any other body functions. 
1.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic data revealed low to intermediate transepithelial intestinal permeability of ETR. 
Following oral administration peak plasma concentrations were generally reached within 4 hours in all 
species. 
Tissue distribution and the elimination from plasma were rapid. The human profile of metabolites was 
reflected in the species tested and the animal pharmacokinetic data in general reflected the clinical 
data, albeit at lower levels in some species.  
In all species, the contribution of metabolic elimination to the overall disposition of ETR was 
quantitatively limited as in the plasma and feces of animals and humans unchanged ETR was more 
abundant than any metabolite.  
ETR was predominantly excreted unchanged via the feces in all species. Urinary elimination of ETR was 
negligible. 
1.3.4.  Toxicology 
Regarding the acute toxicity studies, in mice, there were no relevant effects following oral 
administration of ETR base or ETR HBr in PEG400 vehicle at doses up to 1000 mg/kg. Similarly, there 
was no effect of ETR base in PEG400 vehicle administered by subcutaneous injection to mice at doses 
Intelence 
Assessment report  
Page 9/41 
 
 
 
 
of up to 320 mg/kg. In rats, there were no relevant effects following oral administration of ETR base or 
ETR HBr in PEG400 vehicle at doses up to 1000 mg/kg. Similarly, there was no effect of ETR base in 
PEG400 vehicle administered by subcutaneous injection to rats at doses of up to 320 mg/kg, other 
than slight skin irritation/necrosis at the site of injection in 1 female given the highest dose. In dogs, 
the single dose oral toxicity was determined using spray-dried ETR formulated tablets or as an aqueous 
suspension in a study comprised of 3 phases. A dose-escalation phase up to 160 mg/kg was followed 
by a 5-day repeated dose phase at 120 mg/kg/day using tablets. In the third phase, dogs were given 
350 mg/kg/day of spray-dried ETR in an aqueous suspension by oral gavage for 5 consecutive days in 
fasted or fed conditions. No relevant toxicity findings were observed. 
Liver changes seen in rodents occurred at exposures below those in the clinic at the recommended 
therapeutic dose. In the dog, repeated dosing with spray-dried ETR resulted also in liver changes 
(increases in transaminases, microgranuloma and minor inflammatory changes, and inspissated bile in 
gall bladder). In rodents, changes in the coagulation parameters were also noted, more pronouncedly 
in mice relative to rats. In mice and following dietary administration only, disturbances in the 
coagulation parameters led to mortality, hemorrhagic cardiomyopathy and hemothorax in male 
animals only.  
Genotoxicity tests, in vitro and in vivo, have shown ETR to be free of genotoxic potential, with and 
without liver metabolic activation system. These tests included in vitro gene mutation assays (Ames 
test and mouse lymphoma test), an in vitro chromosomal aberration test (human lymphocytes) and an 
in vivo chromosomal aberration test (mouse bone marrow micronucleus test; up to a single dose of 
2000 mg/kg).  
Regarding the carcinogenicity studies, ETR was not carcinogenic in rats or in male mice. An increase in 
the incidences of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas was observed in female mice. 
Administration of ETR did not cause a statistically significant increase in the incidence of any other 
benign or malignant neoplasm in mice or rats. 
No relevant effects on male or female fertility were observed in this study performed with ETR HBr in 
PEG400 up to a dose level of 506 mg/kg/day. No relevant effects were observed in study with spray-
dried ETR suspended in water and the NOAEL was roughly 500 mg/kg/day.  In an embryo-fetal 
developmental toxicity study pregnant rats were dosed with ETR HBr in PEG400 up to 1000 mg/kg/day 
and this did not result in maternal or fetal toxicity. The fetal NOAEL was 1000 mg/kg/day and ETR is 
therefore considered not to be teratogenic in the rat. In an embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study 
ETR HBr formulated in alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS)/HPMC was dosed in 
pregnant rabbits up to 750 mg/kg/day. ETR has shown no teratogenic potential. Therefore, an 
additional study was conducted using spray-dried ETR suspended in water and at doses up to 375 
mg/kg/day. The maternal NOAEL was 125 mg/kg/day and fetal NOAEL was 375 mg/kg/day. No 
adverse effects were observed in a pre- and postnatal development study in the rat using spray-dried 
ETR at dose levels up to 500 mg/kg/day.  
ETR was classified as “non sensitizing” in an in vivo guinea pig skin sensitization study and in a mouse 
local lymph node assay. ETR was also classified as “non irritant” in an in vivo rabbit skin irritation 
study. In an in vitro eye irritation assay, ETR in base form was considered to be a “mild” eye irritant, 
whereas in HBr-salt form, it was considered to be a “very severe” eye irritant. No effects were 
observed in an in vitro phototoxicity study. 
Concerning the immunotoxicity aspects ETR HBr formulated in PEG400 was administered at doses of 
up to 600 mg/kg/day. There were no relevant effects of treatment with ETR and the immune response, 
as measured by IgM production, was not affected by treatment. 
Intelence 
Assessment report  
Page 10/41 
 
 
 
 
The mechanistic studies conducted with ETR suggested that the effect of ETR on clotting times and 
clotting factors in mice is mediated via a vitamin K pathway. The underlying mechanism for the cardiac 
lesions can be explained by the severely disturbed coagulation resulting in interstitial hemorrhagic 
diathesis within the myocardium and subsequent muscle degeneration and inflammation. The exact 
mechanism of ETR on the vitamin K pathway is not described and extrapolation to humans is still 
questionable. 
1.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
As the partition coefficient octanol/water, log Pow, of ETR is 3.4, which is below 4.5, there was no 
assessment for Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity (PBT). The predicted environmental 
concentration of TMC125 in surface water (PECsurfacewater) was calculated to be 0.013 µg/L. The 
predicted environmental concentration of TMC125 in groundwater (PEC groundwater) was calculated to be 
0.0032 µg/L. 
Concerning the aquatic fate and effect assessment (Phase II Tier A), the ratios PECsurfacewater/PNECwater 
and PECgroundwater /PNECgroundwater are below 1 and the ratio PECsurfacewater/PNECmicroorganisms is below 0.1. 
Consequently, no further testing in the aquatic compartment is necessary and it can be concluded that 
ETR and/or its metabolites are unlikely to represent a risk to the aquatic environment. The very low 
bioconcentration values (BCF) of 370.3 and 476.9 indicate that ETR does not bioaccumulate in aquatic 
organisms. The adsorption/desorption coefficients (K oc) for activated sludge and soils indicates that 
ETR is immobile and will remain preferably in soil. Regarding the phase II Tier B, the ratio 
PECsoil/PNECsoil is below 1.  
In conclusion, ETR and/or its metabolites are considered unlikely to represent a risk to the terrestrial 
compartment. 
1.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The target organs reported in toxicity studies were: liver, thyroid and coagulation system. However, 
the liver effects resulted from enzymatic induction in rats, were observed at exposures at least 8-fold 
higher than the anticipated human exposure in dogs, and no clinically relevant changes over time were 
apparent in hepatic- or thyroid- related laboratory parameters in clinical trials. The thyroid effects were 
species-specific and associated with enzymatic induction. Concerning the coagulation system, in mice, 
coagulopathy was mediated by a mechanism involving vitamin K and further induced cardiomyopathy. 
No such effects were reported in either dogs or humans. The mouse is believed to be more sensitive to 
develop hemorrhagic cardiomyopathy due to a higher heart rate and thinner ventricular and atrial wall, 
relative to other species (dog, humans). However, it should be noted that the exact mechanism of ETR 
effect on the Vitamine K pathway is not known.  
ETR and/or its metabolites are considered unlikely to represent a risk to the terrestrial compartment. 
1.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No non-clinical juvenile studies were performed by the applicant to support this application. This is 
considered acceptable because the effects noted on the liver and/or thyroid were species-specific or 
occurred at exposures higher than that expected in humans. In addition, no effects on growth or 
development of offspring in the reproductive toxicology studies have been observed.  Therefore, the 
nonclinical data generated to date does not suggest a potential risk for paediatric subjects and 
supports the use of ETR in the paediatric population.

1.4.  Clinical aspects 
1.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.   
A GCP inspection was performed in February 2012 on study TMC213 at the CHMP request. The 
inspectors’ conclusion was that the conduct of the trial could be considered to be GCP compliant and 
that the data can be considered for evaluation and assessment for the present application.

Study TMC125-C173 
Study TMC125-C173 was conducted in healthy subjects to evaluate the relative oral bioavailability of 
one single dose of the new 25 mg tablet (F066) with the marketed 100 mg tablet (F060). Moreover, 
oral biovailability of 100 mg tablet either swallowed or dispersed in water was tested. High inter 
subject variability was observed in the same range as previously known for ETR. Overall, comparable 
bio availabilities were observed between the 3 modes of administration of one dose of 100 mg of 
etravirine in adult (with one swallowed tablet of F060, with one F060 dispersed in water and 4 
swallowed tablets of F066), with a minor trend for lower (15-20%) Cmax with the paediatric F066 tablet 
as compared to the adult F060 tablet.

Study TMC125-C126 
This was an open-label, Phase I trial conducted in 2 stages to evaluate the steady-state 
pharmacokinetics of ETR at 2 different weight-based target dose levels (4 mg/kg b.i.d. in Stage I and 
5.2 mg/kg b.i.d. in Stage II) and to support a weight-based dosing recommendation for ETR in 
treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects from 6 years to < 18 years of age. 
In each stage: 
• 
Patients were studied in 2 age groups: 6 to < 12 years old (Group 1) and ≥ 12 to ≤ 17 years old 
(Group 2), 
•  ETR was administered as the commercial 100-mg tablet (F060) and/or as the compositionally 
proportional 25-mg tablet (F066) for 7 days with an additional morning dose on day 8.  
The results from study C126 indicated that the 4 mg/kg dose might be too limited in some patients 
(lower C min) especially given the high variability and taking into account the genetic barrier of the 
drug. The 5.2 mg/kg dose (closer to a 400 mg/70 kg~5.7mg/kg dose in adult) would provide better 
confidence on the efficacy side. These data were reviewed by the CHMP through previous assessment 
of the Article 46 submission P46 029 (conclusion adopted in August 2010).  
As part of the present application, the applicant provided data comparing the mean PK parameters in 
the overall paediatric population to historical adult values (data from study C228 and DUETs which 
were submitted as part of the initial marketing authorisation application). Comparative evaluation of 
the PK data plots in paediatric and adult population confirmed that the dose of 5 mg/kg/day was more 
adequate than the dose of 4 mg/kg/day to mimic the adult’s exposures in paediatric patients. Of note, 
a trend for a lower exposure in adolescents compared to children and adults was observed. 
Study TMC125-C213 (PIANO) 
This study is an open-label, Phase IIb trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and 
antiviral activity of ETR, administered on a weight-based dose of 5.2 mg/kg b.i.d. regimen, during 48 
weeks of treatment with ETR, in combination with other antiretroviral (ARV) drugs, in treatment 
experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects from 6 years to < 18 years of age (see Section 2.5 for 
further details). 
Sparse PK sample were obtained at different times of the study and were used to elaborate a 
paediatric population pharmacokinetic model conjointly with data from the DUETs studies and study 
C126. 
As a difference with the study C126, patients who were unable to swallow the tablets were authorised 
to disperse it in a glass of water. As in C126 study, almost all adolescents (93%) were dosed with the 
adult dose of 200 mg b.i.d. The population pharmacokinetic estimates for etravirine AUC12h and C0h 
from the 48 data for study C213 are summarised in the table below.

The exposure in children with the 5.2 mg/kg b.i.d dose is higher (in C126 study) or similar (in C213 
study) to the exposure observed in DUET studies conducted in adult patients. However, while the 
adolescents were receiving the adult dose, the exposure in this age group was lower than the one in 
adults. This might be explained by a lower adherence rate in adolescents; however the adherence data 
collected is limited and it cannot allow drawing formal conclusion (see section 2.5). 
1.4.4.  Conclusions on pharmacokintics 
The pharmacokinetics of etravirine in 101 treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric patients, 
6 years to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 16 kg, showed that the administered 
weight-based dosages resulted in etravirine exposure comparable to that in adults receiving etravirine 
200 mg b.i.d. when administered at a dose corresponding to 5.2 mg/kg b.i.d. Therefore the CHMP 
considered that the 5.2 mg/kg dose was satisfactory.

1.5.  Clinical efficacy  
1.5.1.  Main study 
TMC125-TiDP35-C213: A Phase II open-label trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and 
antiviral activity of TMC125 in antiretroviral experienced HIV-1 infected children and 
adolescents. 
Methods 
TMC125-C213, also known as the Pediatric study of Intelence As a NNRTI Option (PIANO) study, was a 
Phase II, open-label study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and antiviral activity of 
ETR during a 48-week treatment with ETR, when added to an investigator-selected optimized 
background regimen (OBR) in treatment-experienced pediatric HIV-1 infected subjects aged 6 to < 18 
years. 
The study consisted of a screening period with a maximum of 6 weeks, a 48-week treatment period, 
followed by a 4-week post-treatment follow-up period for subjects who were not continuing treatment 
with ETR in another study or program. 
Study Participants  
Main inclusion criteria were as following:  
•  Male or female subjects, aged between 6 and < 18 years; 
•  Body weight of at least 16 kg 
•  Subjects with documented HIV-1 infection 
•  HIV-1 plasma viral load at screening visit ≥ 500 copies/mL (assayed by Roche COBAS TaqMan). 
•  On a stable ART for at least 8 weeks at Screening and willing to stay on that treatment until 
Baseline. 
Treatments 
ETR was administered with food and dosed per body weight: 5.2 mg/kg b.i.d. up to a maximum of 200 
mg b.i.d. (the dose recommended in adults).  
•  16 to < 20 kg: 100 mg b.i.d. (4 x 25-mg tablets or 1 x 100-mg tablets) 
•  20 to < 25 kg: 125 mg b.i.d. (5 x 25-mg tablets or 1 x 100-mg + 1 x 25-mg tablets) 
•  25 to < 30 kg: 150 mg b.i.d. (6 x 25-mg tablets or 1 x 100-mg + 2 x 25-mg tablets) 
•  ≥ 30 kg: 200 mg b.i.d. (8 x 25-mg tablets or 2 x 100-mg tablets)  
In combination with an investigator-selected OBR consisting of at least 2 ARV drugs (a boosted PI in 
combination with N[t]RTI(s); RAL use was permitted as part of the OBR; additional use of ENF was 
optional).

Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of etravirine (ETR) in 
combination with other antiretrovirals (ARVs) over a 24-week treatment period in children and 
adolescents aged 6 to < 18 years. 
The secondary objectives of this study were: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To evaluate long-term safety and tolerability of ETR in combination with other ARVs over a 48-
week treatment period in children and adolescents aged 6 to < 18 years; 
To assess population pharmacokinetic parameters and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic 
relationships of ETR for antiviral activity and safety over 24 and 48 weeks of treatment in children 
and adolescents aged 6 to < 18 years; 
To evaluate the antiviral activity of ETR in combination with other ARVs over a 24-week and 48-
week treatment period in children and adolescents aged 6 to < 18 years; 
To evaluate immunological changes (as measured by CD4 and CD8 cell count and CD4/CD8 ratio) 
over 24 and 48 weeks; 
To assess the evolution of the viral genotype and phenotype over 24 and 48 weeks. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
• 
Plasma Viral Load 
The plasma viral load was measured by the Roche COBAS TaqmanTM HIV-1 test.  
•  Resistance Evaluations 
At Screening only a genotype determination by means of vircoTYPE HIV-1 was performed. If the 
baseline phenotype was negative, a phenotype was performed by means of the Antivirogram on the 
screening sample. 
• 
Pharmacokinetic Evaluations 
At a number of visits throughout the study blood samples were taken to determine the ETR 
concentrations, and optionally PI concentrations. Plasma concentrations were determined using a 
validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. At Week 24 or at 
Premature Withdrawal, whichever came first, a sample was taken for CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 
genotyping. 
• 
Taste Questionnaire 
Taste acceptability of ETR dispersed in water was assessed at Week 2 using a modified questionnaire 
form incorporating a 5-point hedonic facial scale.  
•  Adherence 
Determination of adherence was based on two methods: pill counts at each visit and replies to 
question 7 of the PENTA Study Adherence Questionnaire for children/teenager and to question 10 of 
the Study Adherence Questionnaire for caregivers.

Sample size 
The study population was planned to comprise 100 HIV-1 infected subjects. Efforts were made to 
include at least 30 subjects in each of the 2 age groups (6 to < 12 years and 12 to < 18 years), on a 
stable ARV regimen, who needed to change their ARV regimen because it was currently failing, with a 
confirmed HIV-1 plasma viral load ≥ 500 copies/mL. 
Statistical methods 
The primary population is the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, i.e. all subjects who had been enrolled 
and taken ETR at least once, regardless of their compliance with the protocol. In case of a substantial 
number of major protocol violation, an on-protocol analysis was to be performed.  
Virologic response defined as: 
•  % of subjects with plasma viral load < 50 copies/mL at Week 24 (primary efficacy parameter), 
•  % of subjects with plasma viral load < 50 copies/mL at all other time points, 
•  % of subjects with plasma viral load < 400 copies/mL at all time points, 
•  % of subjects with at least 1 log10 drop in plasma viral load compared to Baseline at all time 
points. 
•  Change in plasma viral load from Baseline at all time points. 
Data was analyzed using the following imputation methods:  
Observed: no imputation done. This is the classical observed case analysis. 
Imputed non-completer equals failure (NC=F): Subjects who dropped out of the study were considered 
as non-responders after discontinuation. Subjects with intermittent missing viral load values were 
considered responders only if the preceding visit indicate response. In all other cases, intermittent 
values were imputed with non-response. 
Imputed TLOVR: responders/non-responders are defined according to the FDA Time To Loss Of 
Virologic Response algorithm32; a subject was considered a responder at a given time point if the 
subject showed virologic response at that time point and at the subsequent time point; a subject was 
considered a non-responder at a time point in the following situations: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the subject discontinued at that time point; 
the subject showed a 'rebound' HIV RNA value at that time point and the subsequent time point; 
intermittently missing values were considered as response if the immediately preceding and 
following visits demonstrated response; in case the subject had not reached the next visit yet, no 
imputation was performed for the missing time points, unless the subject had discontinued the 
study; 
the subject showed a rebound at an earlier time point (irrespective of re-suppression of viral load). 
Imputed TLOVR (non-VF censored): Similar to the TLOVR algorithm as defined above, but with the 
following difference: for subjects who dropped out for reasons other than virologic failure (non-VF), the 
values after discontinuation were not imputed (i.e. is left missing). 
The NC=F imputation method was used for the calculation of the primary efficacy parameter.  
Intelence 
Assessment report  
Page 17/41 
 
 
 
 
The response rates together with their 95% CIs were calculated for all response parameters described 
above. Raw data and changes versus Baseline of log10 plasma viral load were descriptively and 
graphically presented. Time to first virologic response and time to loss of virologic response (for all 
definitions of virologic response as described above) were graphically presented by means of Kaplan-
Meier curves. 
The effect of baseline disease parameters and type and activity of the OBR was investigated through 
subgroup analyses and logistic regression models. 
Definition of Lack of Response: Virologic failure (lack of response) is defined as: 
• 
• 
Plasma viral load decline of < 0.5 log10 from Baseline by Week 8; 
Plasma viral load decline of < 1.0 log10 from Baseline by Week 12. 
Confirmation of virologic failure (lack of response) has to be done at the next planned visit or at an 
unscheduled visit. There has to be a minimum 2-week interval between plasma viral load assessments. 
Definition of Loss of Response: Virologic failure (loss of response) is defined as 2 consecutive 
measurements of plasma viral load > 0.5 log10 above the nadir after a minimum of 12 weeks of 
treatment. Confirmation has to be done at the next planned visit or at an unscheduled visit. There has 
to be a minimum 2-week interval between plasma viral load assessments. 
Results 
Participant flow 
In total, 41 investigators in 13 countries actively enrolled subjects in study C213. The highest 
proportion of study participants were from Thailand, Argentina and the United States, contributing 
19.8%, 14.9% and 14.9% of the subjects in the overall study population, respectively. 
In total, 178 subjects were screened, of whom 101 were enrolled, treated with ETR and as such 
included in the ITT population: 41 (40.6%) children (≥ 6 to < 12 years) and 60 (59.4%) adolescents 
(≥ 12 to < 18 years). Seventy-seven subjects were screened but were not treated (screening failure 
rate of 43% in both age groups). 
Seventy-six (75.2%) subjects have completed the study (34 children and 42 adolescents) and 25 
(24.8%) subjects have prematurely discontinued (7 children and 18 adolescents). The main reasons 
for premature treatment discontinuation were AE/HIV-related events (2 children and 6 adolescents) 
and non-compliance (3 children and 5 adolescents). 
Recruitment 
The study started on 6th August 2008 and ended on 30th August 2011. 
Baseline data 
The population is comprised of 41 children from 6 years of age and 60 adolescents. It is noted that 
43% of the population were screening failure. Moreover, a higher rate of discontinuation was observed 
in adolescents as compared to adults (28% vs 15%), mainly driven by a higher rate of adverse events. 
Adolescents were included mainly in Thailand (27%) and in USA (20%), and children mainly in South 
Africa (20%) and Argentina (22%).

Paediatric patients enrolled in the study had a median CD4 cell count of 385/mm3 and a median HIV 
RNA level of approx 4 log/copies/ml. Patients with a low viral load (< 20 000 copies/mL) were the 
majority (62,4%) while patients with high VL (>100 000 copies) represented only 11% of the overall 
population. 
As a reminder, in DUET studies in adults, the population was heavily pre-treated and at an advanced 
stage of the disease (60% being classified in CDC category C, with median viral load approx 4.8 log10 
copies/ml and approx 100/mm3 median CD4).  
Seventy two percent (72%) of adolescents has already received 6 or more ARV, while only 39% of 
children did so. All main classes (NNRTI, PI and NRTI) have already been used, the number of 
molecules in each class being accordingly greater among older patients over 12 years than in children. 
The majority of children and adolescents have previously received 1 NNRTI. 
In this study, ETR had to be given in combination with an investigator OBR, which had to consist to at 
least 2 active antiretroviral including a boosted PI (either lopinavir, darunavir, atazanavir or 
saquinavir). The most frequently used PIs were DRV (approximately 51% in both groups of paediatric 
patients) and LPV (44% in children vs 35% in adolescent). Five adolescents were receiving the boosted 
PI atazanavir, the PK parameters of which could be significantly altered by ETR. 
Fifty seven per cent (57.4%) and 87.1% of subjects had at least 3 IAS-USA NRTI and 3 PI RAMs 
detected at Baseline, respectively (17% with primary PI mutation). To put in perspective, in DUETs 
studies, baseline phenotypic sensitivity to at least 1 protease inhibitor was 77.5% of all subjects in 
DUET-1 and 75% of all subjects in DUET-2. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Virologic response 
The sensitivity analyses for virologic response defined as the percentage of subjects with plasma VL < 
50 copies/mL are summarized for the Week 24 and Week 48 time points in Table 4. 
Table 4.  Sensitivity Analyses for Virologic Response Defined as the Percentage of Subjects With 
Plasma VL < 50 Copies/mL at Week 24 and Week 48 –TMC125-C213 Week 48 Analysis 
The primary efficacy parameter was virologic response defined as the percentage of subjects with 
plasma viral load < 50 copies/mL at Week 24 calculated according to the NC=F imputation method. 
Based on this analysis, 52.5% of all subjects had a plasma viral load < 50 copies/mL at Week 24, with 
a better efficacy response observed in children (58.5%) than in adolescents (48.3%). At Week 48, the 
overall proportion of responders with VL < 50 copies/mL was slightly increased to 56.4%. The 
Intelence 
Assessment report  
Page 19/41 
 
 
 
 
 
proportion of responders had increased from 58.5% to 68.3% in children, whereas in adolescents, the 
proportion of responders remained the same (48.3%). 
The percentage of subjects with virologic response defined as a plasma VL < 50 copies/mL according 
to the TLOVR algorithm at Week 48 was 53.5 (68.3% in children and 43.3% in adolescents). 
At Week 48, 63.4% of all subjects had a confirmed plasma VL < 400 copies/mL, and 60.4% of all 
subjects had a confirmed ≥ 1 log10 decrease in plasma VL versus Baseline, calculated according to the 
TLOVR algorithm. Response rates in children were identical for the VL < 50 and < 400 copies/mL 
definition of response. In adolescents there was a 16.7% difference between the two definitions of 
response (43.3% VL < 50 copies/mL and 60.0% VL < 400 copies/mL). 
Overall, these 48 weeks data speak in favour of a sustainability of the virologic suppression. 
Change in Plasma Viral Load from Baseline 
The change in log10 plasma VL from Baseline was calculated using the NC=F imputation method. A 
mean decrease in log10 plasma VL from Baseline was observed at all time points. At Week 48, the 
mean (SE) change in log10 plasma VL from Baseline was -1.53 (0.132) log10 copies/mL for all 
subjects, -1.67 (0.219) log10 copies/mL for children and -1.44 (0.163) log10 copies/mL for 
adolescents. 
Immunologic outcome 
An increase in absolute CD4 cell count was observed at all time points. The beneficial effect of ETR on 
restoration of the immune function was shown by a clear immunologic response versus Baseline at 
Week 24 and this was still observed at Week 48. At Week 48, the mean change in absolute CD4 cell 
count from Baseline was +156 x 106 cells/L overall; +178 x 106 cells/L in children and +141 x 106 
cells/L in adolescents. The mean change in % CD4 at Week 48 was 5% overall, 6% in children and 4% 
in adolescents. Findings based on CD4/CD8 ratio were generally in line with those for % CD4. The 
mean increase from Baseline in CD4 cell count was higher in pediatric subjects in the TMC125-C213 
study compared with the pooled DUET studies.

The response rate in paediatric patients was close to that observed in adults from DUET Studies. The 
lower decrease from baseline in paediatric patients as compared to adults is related to the lower viral 
load at baseline in children in this study as compared to the DUET studies (3.6 vs 4.8 log copies/ml). 
While having mostly received the adult dose, adolescents had a trend for lower virologic response, 
without clear explanation. Given the limitations of the adherence data collected (see below), the 
relation cannot be explored. 
Resistance 
HIV-1 genotypes and phenotypes were assessed as per protocol during treatment with ETR in 
combination with other ARV drugs in treatment-experienced, HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects 6 years 
to < 18 years of age. For the resistance analyses, virologic failures (rebounders and nonresponders) 
were defined using the TLOVR, non-VF censored, algorithm. The genotypic and phenotypic baseline 
versus endpoint profiles of the 41 virologic failures from the Week 48 analysis were evaluated. 
At Week 48, 41 of 101 (40.6%) subjects were classified as virologic failures (TLOVR non-VF censored) 
(26.8% of children, 50.0% of adolescents). Twenty-nine (28.7%) subjects were non-responders 
(19.5% of children, 35.0% of adolescents) and 12 (11.9%) subjects were rebounders (7.3% of 
children, 15.0% of adolescents). Eight of the 12 rebounders did not pass beyond 400 copies/mL at 
confirmed failure. 
At baseline, a higher mean viral load and median number of NNRTI RAMs were observed in the 
virologic failures compared to the non-virologic failures, but no substantial differences in baseline 
genotypic and phenotypic characteristics and ARV activity of the OBR were noted. 
Development of resistance was assessed in virologic failures for which Baseline/Endpoint genotypic and 
phenotypic profiles were available at both Baseline and Endpoint (n = 23). The median ETR fold 
change in EC 50 (FC) increased from 0.9 (ranging from 0.3 to 2.3) at Baseline to 3.6 (ranging from 0.8 
to > 1598.8) at Endpoint. The median number of ETR RAMs increased from 0 (ranging from 0 to 2) to 
1 (ranging from 0 to 4) and the median ETR weighted genotypic score increased from 0 (ranging from 
0 to 2.5) to 1.5 (ranging from 0 to 6.5).  
NNRTI RAMs emerging in at least 3 subjects who were virologically failing included Y181C (n = 8), 
V90I (n = 3), L100I (n = 3) and E138A (n = 3). These 4 NNRTI RAMs have been previously described 
as ETR RAMs and were also seen as emerging mutations in virologic failures in the adult DUET studies. 
Both genotypic (i.e. emergence of 1 or more ETR RAM(s) and an increase in ETR weighted genotypic 
score from 0-2 at Baseline to > 2.5 at Endpoint) and phenotypic (i.e. an increase in ETR FC > 3.0 at 
Endpoint) development of resistance to ETR was observed in 9 out of the 23 virologic failures (39.1%) 
who had available genotype and phenotype data at Baseline and Endpoint. For 11 of 23 (47.8%) 
virologic failures, no development of resistance to ETR was observed, whereas in 3 of the 23 (13.0%) 
virologic failures ETR resistance was demonstrated by phenotype only.  
The proportion of responders (< 50 copies/mL TLOVR [non-VF censored]) at Week 48 was greater 
among those with a lower baseline ETR FC. For subjects with ETR FC < 3,63.6% (42/66) responded 
and 50.0% (4/8) responded when ETR FC values were between 3 and 13. Similarly, a higher rate of 
virologic response was observed for subjects with a baseline ETR weighted genotypic score of 0-2 
(52/77, 67.5%) compared to those with a baseline ETR weighted genotypic score of 2.5-3.5 (2/8, 
25.0%). Note that the subgroups with reduced ETR sensitivity (either phenotypically or genotypically) 
were small.

Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship 
The Week 48 analysis of study TMC125-C213, in which treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected pediatric 
subjects (6 years to < 18 years of age) were treated with ETR at a target weight-based dose of 5.2 
mg/kg b.i.d. (up to a maximum of 200 mg b.i.d.), confirmed that ETR exposure was slightly higher in 
subjects with a virologic response (< 50 copies/mL) when compared with the non-responders. For 
subjects in the lowest ETR AUC 12h quartile (AUC ≤ 2704 ng.h/mL), the virologic response rate defined 
as achieving plasma VL < 50 copies/mL (TLOVR non-VF censored; 40.9%) at Week 48 was lower 
compared to subjects in higher ETR AUC 12h quartiles (range 66.7% to 76.2%). Similar results were 
observed with plasma trough concentration C 0h. Note that these findings should be interpreted with 
caution because the sample size limits the ability to draw firm conclusions. 
Exploration of adherence and taste: 
The proportion of subjects who were adherent (i.e. level of adherence > 95%) to ETR up to Week 24 
as assessed by pill count was 44.4% (16 subjects) in children and 37.0% (20 subjects) in adolescents. 
Taste acceptability of ETR dispersed in water was assessed at Week 2 using a modified questionnaire 
form incorporating a 5-point hedonic facial scale. The 5 response categories were (1) really good, (2) 
pretty good, (3) okay, (4) not good, and (5) terrible. Overall, 30% considered that the taste was “not 
good” or even “terrible”. 
Mode of administration, palatability and impact on adherence, predictive factors of virologic 
failure 
In study C213, the 25 mg tablet was administered alone in 3 children. All the other paediatric patients 
received either a combination of 100 and 25 mg tablets [24/41 (59%) of the children; 4/60 
adolescents] or the 100 mg tablet [56/60 (93%) of the adolescents; 14/41 (34%) of the children]. 
Table 7 summarized the available data on adherence.

Higher exposure is observed in subjects with higher adherence. However, it is noted that in observant 
patients (adherence > 95% assessed by pill count) mean AUC and mean C0h remain higher in children 
than in adolescents. 
Data by age strata concerning adherence (assessed by pill count more reliable than questionnaire) and 
virological failure (VF) at week 24 (see table 8) do not provided a clear understanding of the 
relationship between these two parameters: in VF, non adherence is an apparent major risk factor in 
adolescents but not clearly in children; in adherent patients, the difference between the two groups 
seems less marked.

added to an investigator-selected optimized OBR comprising of a low-dose rtv-
boosted PI (either [LPV, DRV, ATV or SQV) in combination with N[t]RTIs in 
treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects. RAL use was 
permitted as part of the OBR. The OBR had to contain at least 2 active ARVs. 
The additional use of ENF was optional.

1.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study TMC125-C213 was designed as an open-label, single arm study to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, pharmacokinetics and antiretroviral activity of ETR in a treatment-experienced paediatric 
population. 
The study design of the Phase II study TMC125-C213 is in line with current recommendations in the 
Guideline on the clinical development of medicinal products for the treatment of HIV infection 
(CPMP/EWP/633/02. Revision 2, 20 November 2008) which stipulate that extrapolation to children 
from efficacy data obtained in adults is acceptable if reliable pharmacokinetic data allow for proper 
dose recommendations. 
Given the similarity of the disease in adults and children, the CHMP acknowledged that there is no 
need to duplicate the level of efficacy demonstration obtained in adults since the dose has been 
adequately selected on the basis of the adult exposure. However, it should be noted that, without any 
comparison, the efficacy evaluation was addressed only to a limited extent. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In study C213, patients with a low viral load (< 20 000 copies/mL) were the majority (62,4%) while 
patients with high VL (>100 000 copies) represented only 11% of the overall population. In the DUET 
studies, the population was heavily pre-treated and at an advanced stage of the disease (60% being 
classified in CDC category C, with median viral load approx 4.8 log10 copies/ml and approx 100/mm3 
median CD4). 
Seventy two per cent (72%) of adolescents has already received 6 or more ARVs, while only 39% of 
children did so. All main classes (NNRTI, PI and NRTI) have already been used, the number of 
molecules in each class being accordingly greater among older patients over 12 years old. The majority 
of children and adolescents have previously received 1 NNRTI. 
Intelence 
Assessment report

The primary efficacy parameter was virologic response defined as the percentage of subjects with 
plasma viral load < 50 copies/mL calculated according to the NC=F imputation method. Based on this 
analysis, 52.5% of all subjects had a plasma viral load < 50 copies/mL at Week 24, with a better 
efficacy response observed in children (58.5%) than in adolescents (48.3%). At Week 48, the overall 
proportion of responders with VL < 50 copies/mL was slightly increased to 56.4%. 
The percentage of subjects with virologic response defined as a plasma VL < 50 copies/mL according 
to the TLOVR algorithm at Week 48 was 53.5 (68.3% in children and 43.3% in adolescents). 
At Week 48, 63.4% of all subjects had a confirmed plasma VL < 400 copies/mL, and 60.4% of all 
subjects had a confirmed ≥ 1 log10 decrease in plasma VL versus Baseline, calculated according to the 
TLOVR algorithm. 
Overall, these 48 weeks data speak in favour of a sustainability of the virologic suppression. While 
mostly receiving the adult dose (i.e. maximum dose), adolescents had lower virologic suppression as 
compared to adults and children. This might be related to adherence; however the data collected 
cannot allow drawing formal conclusion. 
The change in log10 plasma VL from Baseline was calculated using the NC=F imputation method. A 
mean decrease in log10 plasma VL from Baseline was observed at all time points. At Week 48, the 
mean (SE) change in log10 plasma VL from Baseline was -1.53 (0.132) log10 copies/mL for all 
subjects. 
An increase in absolute CD4 cell count was observed at all time points. The beneficial effect of ETR on 
restoration of the immune function was shown by a clear immunologic response versus Baseline at 
Week 24 and this was still observed at Week 48. At Week 48, the mean change in absolute CD4 cell 
count from Baseline was +156 x 106 cells/L overall. 
In conclusion, it appears from the study C213 that paediatric patients achieved similar virologic 
suppression as compared to that observed in adults from the pivotal DUET studies. 
1.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In line with the CHMP guideline on the clinical development of medicinal products for the treatment of 
HIV infection (EMEA/CPMP/EWP/633/02), based on the identification of suitable dose regimens and the 
expectation that PK/PD relationships are the same in children as in adults, an extrapolation of efficacy 
data obtained in adults to children may be accepted. 
Study C213 has been designed accordingly and therefore efficacy wasn’t a primary endpoint. However, 
overall, the 48 weeks data are in favour of a sustainability of the virologic suppression over time in the 
paediatric population. 
1.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Study TMC125-C126 
This phase I multi-centre study was conducted from 29 September 200 to 27 February 2008. Thirty-
five treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected subjects participated in this study. Twenty-one subjects 
started treatment in Stage 1 of the study, testing the 4 mg/kg b.i.d. dose regimen; 10 children aged 6 
to < 12 years and 11 adolescents aged 12 to < 18 years. One adolescent prematurely discontinued 
Stage 1 after 1 ETR intake due to a grade 3 creatinine elevation in the pre dose sample. All other 
subjects completed the 8-day treatment period of Stage 1. Twenty-one subjects (12 children and 9 
Intelence 
Assessment report  
Page 26/41 
 
 
 
 
adolescents) started treatment in Stage 2 of the study, in which ETR was dosed at 5.2 mg/kg b.i.d. up 
to a maximum of 200 mg b.i.d. All subjects completed the 8-day treatment period of Stage 2. Seven 
subjects (3 children and 4 adolescents) participated in both Stage 1 and 2 of this study. 
Study TMC125-C213 
The median duration of ETR treatment from first intake up to the time of the cut-off date for the Week 
24 analysis was 48.1 weeks, with a maximum individual duration of 97 weeks. The total patient-years 
of ETR exposure was 91.4 at the time of the cut-off date. The most frequently used dose of ETR in this 
study is the adult dose of 200 mg b.i.d. (69.3%). Most adolescents started on this dose (93.3%). In 
children, 34.1% started on 200 mg b.i.d., 29.3% on 150 mg b.i.d. and 26.8% on 125 mg b.i.d. Most of 
the patients received the adult formulation. Indeed, 69.3% of the overall paediatric population 
received the adult formulation (34.1% of the children between 6 and 12 year-old and 93.3 % of the 
adolescents). Only 65.9% of the 41 children received the paediatric formulation. 
Adverse events 
Study TMC125-C126 
Overall, 14 subjects (66.7%) and 9 subjects (42.9%) reported at least 1 AE in Stage 1 and 2, 
respectively. The most common AEs were headache (14.3% in both Stages); and rhinitis (9.5% in both 
Stages). Five subjects (28.3%) in Stage 1 and 6 subjects (28.6%) in Stage 2 had an AE that was 
considered at least possibly related to ETR by the investigator. 
There were no treatment-emergent SAEs in either stage of the study; one SAE (grade 1 influenza 
considered by the investigator to be not related to ETR) was reported in a child during follow-up of 
Stage 1. One adolescent reported a grade 3 AE (increased creatinine on Day 1 predose) which led to 
permanent discontinuation and another patient reported a grade 4 AE (increased triglycerides 
considered probably related to ETR and possibly related to the background regimen). Apart from these 
grade 3 and grade 4 AE, all other AEs were grade 1 or 2. Three subjects (2 children [9.5%] during 
stage 1 and one child [4.8%] during stage 2) reported skin events during the administration of ETR. 
Treatment-emergent neuropsychiatric events of interest were reported in 3 subjects (14.3%) in stage 
1 and in 4 subjects (19.0%) in stage 2. Headache was the most frequently reported AE in this SOC. No 
hepatic, pancreatic or cardiac events of interest were described in this phase I open-label study.

Table 11.  Treatment-Emergent Skin Events of Interest (Regardless of Severity or Causality) 
Rash Cases 
Rash cases were reported in 23 (22.8%) subjects, 6 (14.6%) children and 17 (28.3%) adolescents. Of 
the 23 rashes reported during treatment with ETR, 18 (78.3%) were considered at least possibly 
related to ETR by the investigator. In both age groups, rashes during treatment with ETR occurred 
early. The median time to first onset was 10 days (range 5 to 119 days) and the median duration was 
7 days (range 2 to 29 days). Rashes during treatment with ETR were usually grade 1 or 2 in severity. 
One subject in each age group developed a grade 3 rash, and 4 subjects (1 child and 3 adolescents) 
discontinued treatment because of rash. No grade 4 rashes or rash-related SAEs were reported. By 
sex, 17 (26.6%) females and 6 (16.2%) males were reported with rash cases. In the pooled DUET 
studies, rash occurred in 28.3% of females and 15.8% of males in adults. Skin adverse events 
occurred almost in a third of patients (30.7%) and, as already mentioned, the frequency is more 
important in adolescents than in children. Additionally, females seemed more at risk of rashes than 
males. The distribution of rashes by sex was similarly reported in adults’ study (DUETs) (see below). 
Comparison of incidence of adverse drug reactions in study TMC125-C213 with other studies 
with ETR 
Data of the Week 48 analysis of the pooled Phase III DUET studies in ETR-treated adults (N = 599) are 
tabulated side-by-side with the data of the Week 48 analysis of TMC125-C213 (N = 101) in table 12 
below. Overall, the incidence of ADRs was similar in both age groups.

Page 29/41 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 12.  Incidence of Adverse Drug Reactions in the Pooled DUET Studies Week 48 Analysis and in 
Study TMC125-C213 Week 48 Analysis. 
The incidence of individual ADRs in paediatric subjects was not different from the incidence in adults. 
The ADR rash was reported slightly less frequently in the DUET studies (19.2%) than in paediatric 
subjects (23.8%) (Table 13); this difference of 4.6% is not considered significant since the confidence 
interval encompasses zero (95% CI of -4.3% to 13.4% [ad hoc analysis]). In addition, there were a 
lower proportion of female subjects in the DUET studies: 10.0% female ETR-treated subjects compared 
to 63.4% in the paediatric study. In the Week 48 safety analysis of the DUET studies, rash was 
reported as an ADR with ETR in 30.0% of females and in 18.0% of males. In the Week 48 safety 
analysis of study TMC125-C213, the ADR rash was recorded in 26.6% of females and in 18.9% of 
males. ADR rash with severity 2 or greater was recorded in 20.3% females and in 5.4% of males in 
study TMC125-C213. These data suggest that the incidences of ADRs in study TMC125-C213 are not 
different from those seen in the DUET studies, and that female sex seems to be a risk factor for 
developing rash in paediatric subjects. 
The type and natural evolution of the rash in children and adolescents was similar to the rash reported 
in adults: most often, rash was mild to moderate, of macular/papular type, occurred mostly in the 
second week of therapy, was self-limiting, resolved within 1 week on continued therapy and lead to 
treatment discontinuation in 4.0% of the paediatric study population.

Severity and relatedness 
Overall, the incidence of grade 3 or grade 4 AEs (13.9%), regardless of causality, was low.  All grade 3 
or 4 AE preferred terms were reported in no more than 2 subjects. Only 2 subjects (both children) 
were reported with a grade 4 AE (both thrombocytopenia). Both grade 4 AEs were considered not 
related to ETR. The percentage of subjects with at least 1 AE assessed as at least possibly related to

ETR was 22.0% for children and 40.0% for adolescents. By SOC, most AEs considered at least possibly 
related to ETR occurred in the SOCs skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (12.2% in children and 
23.3% in adolescents) and gastrointestinal disorders (4.9% and 20.0%). By preferred term, the most 
common individual events considered at least possibly related to ETR were rash (4.9% and 11.7%), 
rash maculo-papular (7.3% and 10.0%), and diarrhea (2.4% and 10.0%). All other preferred terms at 
least possibly related occurred in no more than 3 subjects. AEs that were considered very likely related 
to ETR included abdominal pain upper (1 child), rash maculo-papular (1 adolescent) and overdose (1 
adolescent). The most frequently reported AE preferred terms with at least grade 2 severity and at 
least possibly related to ETR included rash maculo-papular (7.3% in children and 8.3% in adolescents), 
rash (2.4% and 5.0%), and diarrhea (none and 5.0%). All other AE preferred terms with at least grade 
2 severity and at least possibly related to ETR occurred in no more than 1 subject. The most frequently 
reported AE preferred terms with at least grade 3 severity and at least possibly related to ETR included 
diarrhea (1 adolescent), hypersensitivity (1 child) and rash maculo-papular (1 child). 
Deaths, Other Serious Adverse Events, and Other Significant Adverse Events 
No deaths were reported in this study. Overall, 5 adolescents were reported with at least 1 SAE during 
the treatment period. There were no SAEs reported during treatment in children. No new issue 
emerged from these data. One adolescent experienced a SAE (overdose with ETR) considered very 
likely related to treatment with ETR; all other SAEs were considered not related to ETR. One adolescent 
permanently discontinued treatment because of an SAE (drug resistance). 
Pregnancies 
Two pregnancies were reported during the study. As per protocol, both subjects were withdrawn from 
the study. 
Laboratory findings 
Study TMC125-C126 
Most of the laboratory abnormalities were Grade 1 or 2, except for the Grade 3 increase in pancreatic 
amylase, Grade 4 increase in triglycerides and also Grade 3 blood creatinine in the pre dose sample 
day 1 adolescent which led to permanent discontinuation. 
Study TMC125-C213 
The most common treatment-emergent graded laboratory abnormalities were lipid-related, and mainly 
included increases in total cholesterol (50.0% in children and 38.8% in adolescents) and LDL 
calculated (31.6% and 25.0%). The incidence of other treatment-emergent graded laboratory 
abnormalities was low in both age groups. The majority of graded laboratory abnormalities were grade 
1 or 2. Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities were uncommon and included increases in LDL calculated 
fasting (1 adolescent), bilirubin (2 adolescents) and plasma prothrombin time (1 child and 2 
adolescents), and decreases in neutrophils (1 child and 2 adolescents). One child was reported with a 
grade 4 abnormality (platelet count decreased). The most common graded laboratory abnormalities 
were lipid-related, mainly increases in total cholesterol fasting (40.2%) and LDL fasting (24.4%). All 
abnormalities in total cholesterol and LDL were grade 1 or 2 except for 1 adolescent who had a grade 3 
increase in LDL cholesterol.

Cardiovascular safety 
Vital signs 
The within-group comparison for the changes from Baseline in vital signs parameters at Week 48 
revealed a statistically significant difference at the 0.05 level (Wilcoxon signed-rank test) for pulse (p 
= 0.0177) in all subjects. No statistically significant changes from Baseline were observed for blood 
pressure. Among newly available data from the 48 week report of TMC213, the within-group 
comparison for the changes from baseline in vital signs parameters at Week 48 revealed a statistically 
significant increase for pulse (mean increase: 3.39 (SE: 1.5); p = 0.0177) in all subjects. Although this 
small mean increase might not be of clinical relevance, the risk of tachycardia should be monitored and 
any relevant case should be reported as part of the PSUR. 
Individual abnormalities in vital signs 
Grade 3 increased DBP and SBP occurred in 15.8% and 25.7% of subjects, respectively. Three children 
and 6 adolescents had pyrexia reported as a grade 1 or 2 AE, considered not or doubtfully related to 
ETR. No treatment-emergent AEs related to a vital signs abnormality were reported in this study. 
Safety in special populations 
Pubertal development – Tanner Scale 
The assessment of pubertal development was performed by a modified Tanner assessment, consisting 
of a discrete visual inspection and comparison to the illustrated Tanner scales provided in the 
electronic case report file. Since puberty starts at 8 years of age in girls, and at 10 years in boys, 
pubertal maturity using the Tanner scales is performed from 8 years onwards. A total of 96 subjects 
were included in the Tanner stage assessment at Baseline, 83 subjects had Week 24 data and 75 
subjects had Week 48 data. Overall, there were no findings suggestive of delayed sexual maturation. 
With respect to the development of genitalia and breasts in adolescents, at Baseline, 2 (3.3%) subjects 
were classified as stage I (pre-pubertal stage) and 19 (31.7%) subjects were classified as stage V 
(puberty completed). By Week 48, all subjects had started puberty and the proportion of subjects who 
completed puberty had increased to 40.9%. A similar evolution was seen with regard to the 
development of pubic hair in adolescents. At Baseline, 7 (11.7%) subjects were at pre-pubertal stage 
(stage I) and 19 (31.7%) subjects were classified as stage V. By Week 48, 19 (43.2%) subjects had 
completed puberty (stage V) and there were no subjects in stage I anymore. 
Growth and development 
At Baseline, the mean age-adjusted z-scores indicated that children were below the normal population 
median with respect to height (-1.21), weight (-0.97) and BMI (-0.30). The mean age-adjusted z-
scores for height (-1.05) and weight (-0.46) in adolescents were also below the normal population 
median, but the BMI (0.07) was normal. The mean age-adjusted z-scores remained stable over time 
during ETR treatment. The within-group comparison for the changes from Baseline for the age-
adjusted z-scores at Week 48 showed no significant changes for height (+0.02 in children and +0.03 in 
adolescents), weight (+0.02 and +0) and BMI (-0.03 in both children and adolescents).

Relationship between pharmacokinetics and safety in TMC125-C213 week 
48 primary analysis 
The categories ‘Rash’ (grouped term, skin events of interest), neuropsychiatric events of interest, as 
well as the preferred terms headache, diarrhea, nausea, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, depression 
and anxiety were included in the pharmacokinetic/safety analyses. A higher incidence of rash in the 
highest AUC12h quartile (AUC > 6454 ng.h/mL) was observed. It should be noted that these subjects 
were more likely to have a different PI in their OBR than LPV/rtv or DRV/rtv. This is consistent with the 
findings of the multivariate logistic regression model, which identified, among others, ETR AUC12h and 
the PI in the OBR as a potential independent prognostic factor for the development of rash. The 
median ETR AUC12h for subjects using LPV/rtv (n = 39), DRV/rtv (n = 52) or another boosted PI (n = 
10) in the OBR was 3156 ng.h/mL, 4518 ng.h/mL and 6885 ng.h/mL, respectively (ad hoc analysis). 
No firm conclusions can be drawn from these exploratory analyses due to the small sizes of the 
subgroups and potential confounding factors. There was no apparent relationship between ETR AUC12h 
and the other selected categories of AEs of interest. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In study C213, 2 (4.9%) children and 6 (10.0%) adolescents permanently discontinued ETR due to 
(S)AEs. The number of subjects with at least 1 AE for which treatment with ETR was temporarily 
interrupted was 3 (7.3%) for children and 5 (8.3%) for adolescents. Four subjects discontinued 
treatment with ETR due to a rash-related event. One case of rash and both cases of rash maculo-
papular were considered at least possibly related to ETR. Other events, leading to treatment 
discontinuation included pregnancy, drug resistance and hypersensitivity. The case of hypersensitivity 
was considered at least possibly related to ETR. Treatment was more interrupted for adverse event 
reasons in adolescents than in children. 
Post marketing experience 
In the last PSUR evaluation, there are only limited post-marketing data available in 
children/adolescents. According to the Article 9 of the Commission Regulation (EC) No 507/2006, the 
periodic safety update reports provided for in Article 24(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 shall be 
submitted to the Agency and Member States immediately upon request or at least every six months 
following the granting or renewal of a conditional marketing authorisation. 
1.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
In the study C126, the reported events are compatible with the safety profile of ETR. Most of the skin 
events occurred within the 1st week of treatment and resolved with corrective treatment. No new 
safety signal emerged from these data. 
Overall, 82.9% of children and 91.7% of adolescents experienced at least 1 AE in study C213. Grade 3 
or 4 AEs occurred only in 6 (14.6%) children and 8 (13.3%) adolescents. A possible causal relationship 
was reported for 9 (22.0%) children and 24 (40.0%) adolescents by the investigator, and very likely 
related to ETR in one (2.4%) child and 2 (3.3%) adolescents. No death occurred up to the cut-off for 
the Week 48 analysis. Six adolescents reported serious adverse events whereas none were reported in 
children. Treatment with ETR was permanently discontinued because of an AE for 2 (4.9%) children 
Intelence

and 6 (10.0%) adolescents, and was temporarily interrupted in 3 (7.3%) children and 5 (8.3%) 
adolescents. 
Severe rashes are the main safety issue of ETR and were firstly identified in adults. In September 
2009, hypersensitivity reactions including TEN, SJS and DRESS were added in the EU SPC and a DHCP 
was adopted and distributed within the EU to inform prescribers (EMEA/H/C/900/II/06). These events 
occurred in the adolescents and the children exposed to ETR as part of studies C213 and C126. A 
comparison between the paediatric and the adult safety data showed that the overall frequencies of 
“skin events of interest” were similar (27.9% in adults vs 30.7% in paediatric). 
An ad hoc multivariate logistic regression model was used to identify potential prognostic factors for 
the development of rash. This analysis was performed for exploratory purposes only. Results should be 
interpreted with caution as sample sizes within the subgroups were small. 
Gender was identified as an important risk factor (female being more at risk than men). At the CHMP 
request, the applicant performed a review of the literature that highlight a relationship between rash 
and female gender for some drugs, notably ARV. This review did not lead to definite explanation on 
this issue. As mentioned in the RMP, this risk will be monitored. In addition, this risk is adequately 
reflected in section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. 
The specific PI used in the OBR was identified as a potential independent predictor of rash (p < 0.05) 
by the final multivariate model. Indeed, rash appeared to occur less frequently in subjects using 
LPV/rtv in the OBR (3 out of 39 subjects or 7.8%) compared to subjects using DRV/rtv (15 out of 52 or 
28.9%) or another boosted PI (5 out of 10 or 50%). DRV has been associated with severe skin 
reactions such as SJS and TEN. Therefore, its association with ETR could potentiate the occurrence of 
these skin events. 
Other factors that appeared to be weaker predictors of rash were race and region (both p < 0.05), with 
the incidence of rash increasing in White subjects and those living in North America. In addition, a 
higher incidence of rash cases with higher exposure (AUC12h) to ETR was observed (p < 0.05). No firm 
conclusions can be drawn from these exploratory analyses due to the small sizes of the subgroups and 
potential confounding factors. There was no apparent relationship between ETR AUC12h and the other 
selected categories of AEs of interest. 
Although age was not identified as a risk factor in the above mentioned multivariate analysis, AE 
occurred more frequently in adolescents than in children. 
In the study C213, there were no signals that rash, or other skin events of interest, presented any 
consistent biological pattern of associated signs or symptoms suggestive of a hypersensitivity 
syndrome. Similarly, no biological feature compatible with hypsensitivity syndrome was observed. 
In the study C213, there were no noteworthy changes versus baseline with respect to the development 
of genitalia/breasts and pubic hair. ETR does not seem to have a major impact on growth. However, it 
is reminded that the length of exposure is quite short (48 weeks). 
1.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Severe rashes are the main safety issue of ETR and were firstly identified in adults. These events 
occurred in the adolescents and the children exposed to ETR as part of studies C213 and C126. A 
comparison between the paediatric and the adult safety data showed that the overall frequencies of 
“skin events of interest” were similar. An ad hoc multivariate logistic regression model was used to 
identify potential prognostic factors for the development of rash and gender was identified as an 
important risk factor with female being more at risk than men. 
Intelence 
Assessment report

This is adequately reflected in section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Overall, the safety data in the claimed paediatric indication do not give rise to new safety concerns in 
the paediatric population in comparison to the adult population and the CHMP concludes that the safety 
profile of ETR in the proposed indication is acceptable. 
1.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
No update of the pharmacovigilance system was submitted with the present application. 
Risk Management Plan 
The applicant submitted a risk management plan (RMP). Overall, the RMP submitted by the applicant is 
in accordance with the “Guideline on Risk management systems for medicinal products for human use” 
(EMEA/CHMP/96268/2005) and with the Risk Management plan template (EMEA/192632/2006, 
published on October 2006). 
Further to the issues covered by the RMP, the applicant should consider and discuss the following 
additional safety concerns: the risk of medical errors also for paediatric population, the age-dependant 
risk of overdosing/underdosing and the acceptability of the dispersed form of ETR as potential risks. 
Moreover, off-label use of Etravirine without a boosted PI should be considered. 
The below pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance are needed 
to investigate further some of the safety concerns:  
• 
• 
antiretroviral pregnancy registry, 
participation in the ongoing European RegiSCAR trial to monitor and characterise severe skin 
reactions in patients receiving etravirine, 
•  monitoring long term safety through HAART Oversight Committee. 
The following studies in paediatric population are currently ongoing or planned: 
• 
• 
• 
Trial TMC125-C213: An ongoing Phase II, open-label trial to to collect long-term safety data up to 
48 weeks of ETR treatment in children aged 6 to less than 18 years of age, 
Trial TMC125-C239: An ongoing trial to provide continued access to ETR for paediatric subjects 
completing 48 weeks of treatment in trial TMC125-C213 and collect safety information beyond 48 
weeks of ETR treatment in children aged 6 to less than 18 years of age, 
Trial IMPAACT P1090: A planned phase I/II, open-label trial to determine the appropriate dose of 
ETR in combination of an OBR and to determine the safety and tolerability of  etavirine in 
combination with an OBR through 48 weeks of therapy in children aged ≥2 months to <6 years. 
The applicant considers that no specific risk minimization measures beyond SmPC labelling are 
necessary which is endorsed.

basis of a bridging report making reference to Intelence 100mg tablets. The bridging report submitted 
by the applicant has been found acceptable by the CHMP.. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
ETR is a non nucleoside analogue that can retain some level of activity against strains harbouring 
NNRTI resistance. The conditional MA for Intelence relies on the two pivotal DUET studies, the design 
of which has been built on the principle to avoid functional monotherapy. Therefore, a boosted PI (i.e. 
DRV/RTV) was used as part of the OBT in the DUET studies. Data from these studies have established 
that ETR adds to the level of virologic suppression achieved by the OBT containing DRV/RTV and the 
conditional MA has been granted for use of ETR in combination with a boosted Protease inhibitor. 
Study TMC125-C213 was designed as an open-label, single arm study to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, pharmacokinetics and antiretroviral activity of ETR in a treatment-experienced paediatric 
population. The study design is in line with current recommendations in the Guideline on the clinical 
development of medicinal products for the treatment of HIV infection (CPMP/EWP/633/02. Revision 2, 
20 November 2008) which stipulate that extrapolation to children from efficacy data obtained in adults 
is acceptable if reliable pharmacokinetic data allow for proper dose recommendations. Given the 
similarity of the disease in adults and children, the CHMP acknowledged that there is no need to 
duplicate the level of efficacy demonstration obtained in adults since the dose has been adequately 
selected on the basis of the adult exposure. 
The pharmacokinetics of ETR in 101 treatment experienced HIV 1 infected paediatric patients, 6 years 
to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 16 kg, showed that the administered weight based 
dosages resulted in ETR exposure comparable to that in adults receiving ETR 200 mg b.i.d. when 
administered at a dose corresponding to 5.2 mg/kg b.i.d. Therefore the CHMP considered that the 5.2 
mg/kg dose was satisfactory. 
The virologic suppression achieved in paediatric patients is similar to that achieved in adults from the 
DUET studies. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
Despite the PK/PD data and the overall good virological and immunological response rates, the sample 
size was too small to draw definite conclusions.  
Intelence 
Assessment report  
Page 38/41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Due to the open label design of study C213, the efficacy evaluation was addressed only to a limited 
extent. 
While the adolescents were receiving the adult dose, the exposure in this age group was lower than 
the one in adults. In addition, adolescents had a trend for lower virologic response. More challenging 
adherence in adolescents could have driven this finding. Given the limitations of the adherence data 
collected, this possible relationship could not be established. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The main safety concern for ETR is related to cutaneous disorders, sometimes severe such as 
hypersensitivity including DRESS, TEN and SJS. These issues have already been identified in adults and 
are confirmed in adolescents and children. As for the adult population, gender is a risk factor (female 
at higher risk) for cutaneous reaction. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Despite the overall similar safety profile and the absence of new findings specific to the paediatric 
population, the sample size was too small to draw definite conclusions. 
As derived from the adult, gender is a risk factor (female at higher risk) for cutaneous reaction. The 
mechanisms behind this difference are not clear. 
Benefit-risk balance 
As stated in the CHMP guideline on the clinical development of medicinal products for the treatment of 
HIV infection (Doc. Ref. EMEA/CPMP/EWP/633/02), provided that reliable pharmacokinetic data 
support robust dose recommendations, an extrapolation of efficacy data obtained in adults to children 
may be accepted.  
Data  from  study  C126  and  C213  lead  to  recommendation  to  use  the  dose  of  5.2mg/kg  in  paediatric 
patients aged 6 years to less than 18 years of age  and weighing at least 16  kg. The exposure in the 
paediatric population with the 5.2 mg/kg b.i.d dose was comparable to the exposure observed in the 
adult studies. Therefore, this dose was considered adequate by the CHMP and the CHMP concluded that 
extrapolation from adult to the paediatric population covered by the proposed indication is acceptable. 
This is supported by the overall satisfactory virological and immunological response rates in Study 
C213. 
The safety data in the claimed paediatric indication do not give rise to any new safety findings in the 
paediatric population in comparison to the adult population. No specific safety concerns in the 
paediatric population were identified in the data submitted with the present application. 
As a consequence, the CHMP concluded that the benefit /risk balance is favourable for use of ETR in 
combination with a boosted PI and other ARV medicinal products for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in 
ARV treatment experienced paediatric patients aged 6 years to less than 18 years of age and weighing 
at least 16 kg.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
General recommendations 
Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative 
contraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for 
hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and pituitary or hypothalamic tumours, 
and appropriate specific treatment given. 
There is no clinical experience with Ovitrelle in the treatment of other conditions (such as corpus 
luteum insufficiency or male conditions); therefore, Ovitrelle is not indicated in these conditions.

Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) 
A certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is 
more commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without 
treatment. 
In distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with 
increasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and 
an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, 
pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. 
Mild manifestations of OHSS may include abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort and distension, and 
enlarged ovaries. Moderate OHSS may additionally present with nausea, vomiting, ultrasound 
evidence of ascites and marked ovarian enlargement. 
Severe OHSS further includes symptoms such as severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea 
or oliguria. Clinical evaluation may reveal signs such as hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, 
electrolyte imbalances, ascites, pleural effusions, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe 
OHSS may be complicated by ovarian torsion or thromboembolic events, such as pulmonary 
embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial infarction. 
Independent risk factors for developing OHSS include young age, lean body mass, polycystic ovarian 
syndrome, higher doses of exogenous gonadotropins, high absolute or rapidly rising serum estradiol 
levels and previous episodes of OHSS, large number of developing ovarian follicles and large number 
of oocytes retrieved in ART cycles. 
Adherence to recommended Ovitrelle dosage and regimen of administration can minimise the risk of 
ovarian hyperstimulation. Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound scans as well as estradiol 
measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors. 
There is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may 
be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian 
hyperstimulation occur, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain 
from coitus or use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. 
As OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical 
event, patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG administration. 
Mild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended 
that gonadotropin treatment be stopped and that the patient be hospitalised and appropriate therapy be 
started. 
Multiple pregnancy 
In patients undergoing induction of ovulation, the incidence of multiple pregnancy and births is 
increased compared with natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. Multiple 
pregnancies, especially high order, carry an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. 
To minimise the risk of higher order multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is 
recommended. In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related 
mainly to the number of embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age. 
Pregnancy loss 
The incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing 
stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ectopic pregnancy 
Women with a history of tubal disease are at increased risk for ectopic pregnancy, whether the 
pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of 
ectopic pregnancy after ART in this population was reported to be higher than in the general 
population. 
Congenital malformations 
The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous 
conceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, 
sperm characteristics) and the higher incidence of multiple pregnancies. 
Thromboembolic events 
In women with recent thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk factors for 
thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins may further 
increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the benefits of 
gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted, however, that 
pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events. 
Reproductive system neoplasms 
There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and 
malignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility. It is not yet 
established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in infertile 
women. 
Interference with serum or urinary testing 
Following administration, Ovitrelle may interfere for up to ten days with the immunological 
determination of serum or urinary hCG, potentially leading to a false positive pregnancy test. 
Patients should be made aware of this. 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. it is essentially 
“sodium-free”. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No specific interaction studies with Ovitrelle and other medicinal products have been performed; 
however, no clinically significant medicinal product interactions have been reported during hCG 
therapy. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There is no indication for the use of Ovitrelle during pregnancy. Data on a limited number of exposed 
pregnancies indicate no increased risks of malformation or foeto/neonatal toxicity. No reproduction 
studies with choriogonadotropin alfa in animals were performed (see section 5.3). The potential risk 
for humans is unknown. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Breast-feeding 
Ovitrelle is not indicated during breastfeeding. There are no data on the excretion of 
choriogonadotropin alfa in milk. 
Fertility 
Ovitrelle is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Ovitrelle has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
In comparative trials with different doses of Ovitrelle, OHSS was found to be associated with Ovitrelle 
in a dose-related fashion. OHSS was observed in approximately 4% of patients treated with Ovitrelle. 
Severe OHSS was reported in less than 0.5% of patients (see section 4.4).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital system, gonadotropins, 
ATC code: G03GA08 
Mechanism of action 
Ovitrelle is a medicinal product of choriogonadotropin alfa produced by recombinant DNA 
techniques. It shares the amino acid sequence with urinary hCG. Chorionic gonadotropin binds on the 
ovarian theca (and granulosa) cells to a transmembrane receptor shared with the luteinising hormone, 
the LH/CG receptor. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
The principal pharmacodynamic activity in women is oocyte meiosis resumption, follicular rupture 
(ovulation), corpus luteum formation and production of progesterone and estradiol by the corpus 
luteum. 
In women, chorionic gonadotropin acts as a surrogate luteinising hormone surge that triggers 
ovulation. 
Ovitrelle is used to trigger final follicular maturation and early luteinisation after use of medicinal 
products for stimulation of follicular growth. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
In comparative clinical trials, administration of a dose of 250 micrograms of Ovitrelle was as effective 
as 5,000 IU and 10,000 IU of urinary hCG in inducing final follicular maturation and early 
luteinisation in assisted reproductive technologies, and as effective as 5,000 IU of urinary hCG in 
ovulation induction. 
So far, there are no signs of antibody development in humans to Ovitrelle. Repeated exposure to 
Ovitrelle was investigated in male patients only. Clinical investigation in women for the indication of 
ART and anovulation was limited to one treatment cycle. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Following intravenous administration, choriogonadotropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid 
space with a distribution half-life of around 4.5 hours. The steady-state volume of distribution and the 
total clearance are 6 L and 0.2 L/h, respectively. There are no indications that choriogonadotropin alfa 
is metabolised and excreted differently than endogenous hCG. 
Following subcutaneous administration, choriogonadotropin alfa is eliminated from the body with a 
terminal half-life of about 30 hours, and the absolute bioavailability is about 40%. 
A comparative study between the freeze-dried and the liquid formulation showed bioequivalence 
between the two formulations. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Nonclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity. Studies on carcinogenic potential were not 
performed. This is justified, given the proteinous nature of the active substance and the negative 
outcome of the genotoxicity testing. 
Studies on reproduction were not performed in animals.

electrolyte imbalances, ascites, pleural effusions, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe 
OHSS may be complicated by ovarian torsion or thromboembolic events, such as pulmonary

Independent risk factors for developing OHSS include young age, lean body mass, polycystic ovarian 
syndrome, higher doses of exogenous gonadotropins, high absolute or rapidly rising serum estradiol 
levels and previous episodes of OHSS, large number of developing ovarian follicles and large number 
of oocytes retrieved in ART cycles. 
Adherence to recommended Ovitrelle dosage and regimen of administration can minimise the risk of 
ovarian hyperstimulation. Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound scans as well as estradiol 
measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors. 
There is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may 
be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian 
hyperstimulation occur, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain 
from coitus or use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. 
As OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical 
event, patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG administration. 
Mild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended 
that gonadotropin treatment be stopped and that the patient be hospitalised and appropriate therapy be 
started. 
Multiple pregnancy 
In patients undergoing induction of ovulation, the incidence of multiple pregnancy and births is 
increased compared with natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. Multiple 
pregnancies, especially high order, carry an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. 
To minimise the risk of higher order multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is

Ectopic pregnancy 
Women with a history of tubal disease are at increased risk for ectopic pregnancy, whether the 
pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of 
ectopic pregnancy after ART in this population was reported to be higher than in the general 
population. 
Congenital malformations 
The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous 
conceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, 
sperm characteristics) and the higher incidence of multiple pregnancies. 
Thromboembolic events 
In women with recent thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk factors for 
thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins may further 
increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the benefits of 
gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted, however, that 
pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events. 
Reproductive system neoplasms 
There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and 
malignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility. It is not yet 
established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in infertile 
women.

Ovitrelle is used to trigger final follicular maturation and early luteinisation after use of medicinal 
products for stimulation of follicular growth. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
In comparative clinical trials, administration of a dose of 250 micrograms of Ovitrelle was as effective 
as 5,000 IU and 10,000 IU of urinary hCG in inducing final follicular maturation and early 
luteinisation in assisted reproductive technologies, and as effective as 5,000 IU of urinary hCG in 
ovulation induction. 
So far, there are no signs of antibody development in humans to Ovitrelle. Repeated exposure to 
Ovitrelle was investigated in male patients only. Clinical investigation in women for the indication of 
ART and anovulation was limited to one treatment cycle. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Following intravenous administration, choriogonadotropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid 
space with a distribution half-life of around 4.5 hours. The steady-state volume of distribution and the 
total clearance are 6 L and 0.2 L/h, respectively. There are no indications that choriogonadotropin alfa 
is metabolised and excreted differently than endogenous hCG. 
Following subcutaneous administration, choriogonadotropin alfa is eliminated from the body with a 
terminal half-life of about 30 hours, and the absolute bioavailability is about 40%. 
A comparative study between the freeze-dried and the liquid formulation showed bioequivalence 
between the two formulations.

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Nonclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity. Studies on carcinogenic potential were not 
performed. This is justified, given the proteinous nature of the active substance and the negative 
outcome of the genotoxicity testing. 
Studies on reproduction were not performed in animals.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Ovitrelle is and what it is used for  
What Ovitrelle is 
Ovitrelle contains a medicine called ‘choriogonadotropin alfa’, made in a laboratory by a special 
recombinant DNA technique. Choriogonadotropin alfa is similar to a hormone found naturally in your 
body called ‘chorionic gonadotropin’, which is involved in reproduction and fertility. 
What Ovitrelle is used for 
Ovitrelle is used together with other medicines: 
• 
To help develop and ripen several follicles (each containing an egg) in women undergoing 
assisted reproductive technologies (procedure that may help you to become pregnant) such as 
‘in vitro fertilisation’. Other medicines will be given first to bring about the growth of several 
follicles. 
To help release an egg from the ovary (ovulation induction) in women who cannot produce eggs 
(‘anovulation’), or women who produce too few eggs (‘oligo-ovulation’). Other medicines will 
be given first to develop and ripen the follicles. 
• 
2.  What do you need to know before you use Ovitrelle 
Do not use Ovitrelle 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
if you are allergic to choriogonadotropin alfa or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). 
if you have a tumour in your hypothalamus or pituitary gland (both are parts of the brain). 
if you have large ovaries or sacs of fluid within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin. 
if you have unexplained vaginal bleeding. 
if you have cancer of your ovaries, womb or breast. 
if you have severe inflammation of your veins or blood clotting in your veins (active 
thromboembolic disorders). 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
if you have any condition that usually makes a normal pregnancy impossible, such as 
menopause or early menopause (ovarian failure), or malformations of sexual organs. 
Do not use Ovitrelle if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before 
using this medicine. 
Warnings and precautions 
Before the treatment is started, your and your partner's fertility should be evaluated by a doctor 
experienced in the treatment of fertility problems. 
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) 
This medicine may increase your risk of developing OHSS. This is when your follicles develop too 
much and become large cysts. 
If you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, feel sick or are vomiting, or have difficulty 
in breathing, do not give yourself the Ovitrelle injection and talk to your doctor straight away (see 
section 4). If you are developing OHSS, you may be told not to have sex or to use a barrier 
contraceptive method for at least four days. 
The risk of OHSS is reduced if the usual dose of Ovitrelle is used, and if you are monitored closely 
throughout your treatment cycle (e.g. blood tests for estradiol levels and ultrasound). 
Multiple pregnancy and/or birth defects 
When using Ovitrelle, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same 
time (‘multiple pregnancy’, usually twins) than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may 
lead to medical complications for you and your babies. When undergoing assisted reproductive 
technologies, the risk of having a multiple pregnancy is related to your age, the quality and the number 
of fertilised eggs or embryos placed inside you. Multiple pregnancies and specific characteristics of 
couples with fertility problems (e.g. age) may also be associated with an increased chance of birth 
defects. 
The risk of multiple pregnancy is reduced if you are monitored closely throughout your treatment 
cycle (e.g. blood tests for estradiol levels and ultrasound). 
Ectopic pregnancy 
Pregnancy outside of the womb (an ectopic pregnancy) may occur in women with damaged fallopian 
tubes (the tubes which carry the egg from the ovary to the womb). Therefore, your doctor should 
perform an early ultrasound examination to rule out the possibility of pregnancy outside the womb. 
Miscarriage 
When undergoing assisted reproductive technologies or stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, 
you are more likely to have a miscarriage than the average woman. 
Blood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) 
Talk to your doctor before using Ovitrelle if you or a member of your family have ever had blood clots 
in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke. You may be at a higher risk of serious blood clots 
or existing clots might become worse with Ovitrelle treatment. 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tumours of sexual organs 
There have been reports of tumours in the ovaries and other sex organs, both benign and malignant, in 
women who have undergone multiple regimens for infertility treatment. 
Pregnancy tests 
If you do a pregnancy test with serum or urine after use of Ovitrelle, and up to ten days later, it may 
happen that you get a false positive test result. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor. 
Children and adolescents 
Ovitrelle is not for use in children and adolescents. 
Other medicines and Ovitrelle 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not use Ovitrelle if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
It is not expected that Ovitrelle will affect your ability to drive and use machines. 
Ovitrelle contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially “sodium-
free”. 
3. 
How to use Ovitrelle  
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure. 
How much to use 
• 
• 
The recommended dose is 1 pre-filled syringe (250 micrograms/0.5 mL) given as a single 
injection. 
Your doctor will have explained exactly when to give the injection. 
Using this medicine 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Ovitrelle is intended for subcutaneous use that means given by injection under the skin. 
Each pre-filled syringe is for single use only. Only clear solution without particles should be 
used. 
Your doctor or nurse will show you how to use the Ovitrelle pre-filled syringe to inject the 
medicine.  
Inject Ovitrelle as your doctor or nurse taught you. 
After the injection, dispose of the used syringe safely. 
If you administer Ovitrelle to yourself, please carefully read the following instructions: 
1.  Wash your hands. It is important that your hands and the items you use are as clean as possible. 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2. 
Assemble everything you need. Please note that alcohol swabs are not contained in the package. 
Find a clean area and lay out everything: 
- 
- 
two alcohol swabs, 
one pre-filled syringe containing the medicinal product. 
3. 
Injection: 
Immediately inject the solution: Your doctor or nurse will have 
already advised you where to inject (e.g. tummy, front of thigh). 
Wipe the chosen area with an alcohol swab. Firmly pinch the skin 
together and insert the needle for injection at a 45° to 90° angle using 
a dart-like motion. Inject under the skin, as you were taught. Do not 
inject directly into a vein. Inject the solution by pushing gently on 
the plunger. Take as much time as you need to inject all the solution. 
Immediately withdraw the needle and clean the skin with an alcohol 
swab using a circular motion. 
4. 
Dispose of all used items: 
Once you have finished your injection, immediately discard the empty syringe in a sharps 
container. Any unused solution must be discarded. 
If you use more Ovitrelle than you should 
The effects of an overdose of Ovitrelle are unknown, nevertheless there is a possibility that ovarian 
hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) may occur, which is further described in section 4. 
If you forget to use Ovitrelle 
If you forget to use Ovitrelle, please talk to your doctor as soon as you notice. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Stop using Ovitrelle and see a doctor straight away if you notice any of the following serious side 
effects – you may need urgent medical treatment: 
• 
Allergic reactions such as rash, fast or uneven pulse, swelling of your tongue and throat, 
sneezing, wheezing, or serious breathing difficulty are very rare (may affect up to 1 in 
10,000 people). 
Lower abdominal pain, abdominal distension or abdominal discomfort together with nausea 
(feeling sick) or vomiting may be the symptoms of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). 
This may indicate that the ovaries over-reacted to the treatment and that large ovarian cysts 
developed (see also in section 2. under “Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome”). This event is 
common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). 
The OHSS may become severe with clearly enlarged ovaries, decreased urine production, 
weight gain, difficulty in breathing and possible fluid accumulation in your stomach or chest. 
This event is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). 
Serious blood clotting complications (thromboembolic events) sometimes independent of OHSS 
may be found very rarely. This could cause chest pain, breathlessness, stroke or heart attack (see 
also in section 2. under “Blood clotting problems”).

if you have large ovaries or sacs of fluid within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin. 
if you have unexplained vaginal bleeding. 
if you have cancer of your ovaries, womb or breast. 
if you have severe inflammation of your veins or blood clotting in your veins (active 
thromboembolic disorders).

• 
if you have any condition that usually makes a normal pregnancy impossible, such as 
menopause or early menopause (ovarian failure), or malformations of sexual organs. 
Do not use Ovitrelle if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before 
using this medicine. 
Warnings and precautions 
Before the treatment is started, your and your partner's fertility should be evaluated by a doctor 
experienced in the treatment of fertility problems. 
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) 
This medicine may increase your risk of developing OHSS. This is when your follicles develop too 
much and become large cysts.  
If you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, feel sick or are vomiting, or have difficulty 
in breathing, do not give yourself the Ovitrelle injection and talk to your doctor straight away (see 
section 4). If you are developing OHSS, you may be told not to have sex or to use a barrier 
contraceptive method for at least four days. 
The risk of OHSS is reduced if the usual dose of Ovitrelle is used, and if you are monitored closely 
throughout your treatment cycle (e.g. blood tests for estradiol levels and ultrasound). 
Multiple pregnancy and/or birth defects 
When using Ovitrelle, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same 
time (‘multiple pregnancy’, usually twins) than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may 
lead to medical complications for you and your babies. When undergoing assisted reproductive 
technologies, the risk of having a multiple pregnancy is related to your age, the quality and the number 
of fertilised eggs or embryos placed inside you. Multiple pregnancies and specific characteristics of 
couples with fertility problems (e.g. age) may also be associated with an increased chance of birth 
defects. 
The risk of multiple pregnancy is reduced if you are monitored closely throughout your treatment 
cycle (e.g. blood tests for estradiol levels and ultrasound). 
Ectopic pregnancy 
Pregnancy outside of the womb (an ectopic pregnancy) may occur in women with damaged fallopian 
tubes (the tubes which carry the egg from the ovary to the womb). Therefore, your doctor should 
perform an early ultrasound examination to rule out the possibility of pregnancy outside the womb. 
Miscarriage 
When undergoing assisted reproductive technologies or stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, 
you are more likely to have a miscarriage than the average woman. 
Blood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) 
Talk to your doctor before using Ovitrelle if you or a member of your family have ever had blood clots 
in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke. You may be at a higher risk of serious blood clots 
or existing clots might become worse with Ovitrelle treatment. 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tumours of sexual organs 
There have been reports of tumours in the ovaries and other sex organs, both benign and malignant, in 
women who have undergone multiple regimens for infertility treatment. 
Pregnancy tests 
If you do a pregnancy test with serum or urine after use of Ovitrelle, and up to ten days later, it may 
happen that you get a false positive test result. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor. 
Children and adolescents 
Ovitrelle is not for use in children and adolescents. 
Other medicines and Ovitrelle 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not use Ovitrelle if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
It is not expected that Ovitrelle will affect your ability to drive and use machines. 
Ovitrelle contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially “sodium-
free”.

Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Stop using Ovitrelle and see a doctor straight away if you notice any of the following serious side 
effects – you may need urgent medical treatment: 
• 
Allergic reactions such as rash, fast or uneven pulse, swelling of your tongue and throat, 
sneezing, wheezing, or serious breathing difficulty are very rare (may affect up to 1 in 
10,000 people). 
Lower abdominal pain, abdominal distension or abdominal discomfort together with nausea 
(feeling sick) or vomiting may be the symptoms of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). 
This may indicate that the ovaries over-reacted to the treatment and that large ovarian cysts 
developed (see also in section 2. under “Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome”). This event is 
common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). 
The OHSS may become severe with clearly enlarged ovaries, decreased urine production, 
weight gain, difficulty in breathing and possible fluid accumulation in your stomach or chest. 
This event is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). 
Serious blood clotting complications (thromboembolic events) sometimes independent of OHSS 
may be found very rarely. This could cause chest pain, breathlessness, stroke or heart attack (see 
also in section 2. under “Blood clotting problems”). 
• 
• 
• 
Other side effects 
Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
• 
• 
Headache. 
Local reactions at the injection site, such as pain, redness or swelling. 
Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
• 
Diarrhoea.

Get familiar with your Ovitrelle pre-filled pen 
Step 1 Gather your supplies  
1.1  Prepare a clean area and a flat surface, such as a table or 
countertop, in a well-lit area. 
1.2  You will also need (not included in the pack): 
•  Alcohol swabs and a sharps container (Figure 1) 
1.3  Wash your hands with soap and water and dry them well 
(Figure 2). 
1.4  Use your hand to remove the Ovitrelle pre-filled pen from the 
pack. 
Do not use any tools, using tools might damage the pen. 
1.5  Check the name on the pre-filled pen says Ovitrelle. 
1.6  Check the expiration date on the pen label (Figure 3). 
Do not use the Ovitrelle pre-filled pen if the expiration date has passed or if your pre-filled pen does 
not say Ovitrelle. 
Step 2 Get ready for injection 
Pull-off the pen cap (Figure 4). 
2.1 
2.2  Check that medicine is clear, colourless to slightly yellow 
and does not contain particles. 
Do not use the pre-filled pen if the medicine is discolored or 
cloudy, as this can cause an infection. 
Choose your injection site: 
2.3  Your healthcare provider should show you the injection 
sites to use around your stomach area (Figure 5). 
2.4  Clean the skin at the injection site by wiping with an 
alcohol swab. 
Do not touch or cover the cleaned skin.

Do not use the needle if it is damaged, expired or if the outer needle cap or the peel-off seal is 
damaged or loose. Using expired needles or needles with damaged peel-off seal or outer needle cap 
can lead to infection. Throw it away in a sharps container, and use the other needle provided in the 
pack. 
Ask your healthcare provider if you have questions. 
3.6  Screw the outer needle cap onto the threaded needle 
connector of the Ovitrelle pre-filled pen until you feel a 
light resistance (Figure 8).

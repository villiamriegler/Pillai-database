A phase IV study was conducted to evaluate the

Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
1234/2008. 
Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC in order to add 
efficacy and safety information from a European 
Phase IV open label clinical study undertaken in 
patients with benign prostate hyperplasia. The RMP 
has been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH 
took the opportunity to update the RMP with changes 
requested by the PRAC in the recent renewal and 
PSUR procedures. A revised RMP version 11.2 was 
agreed during the procedure.

effectiveness and safety of silodosin in the treatment of 
lower urinary tract symptoms in patients with benign 
prostatic hyperplasia when used in real life situations. The 
results suggest that silodosin is effective in real-life 
situations. The results of this study have been included in 
section 5.1 of the SmPC. In this Phase IV clinical trial, with 
a mean baseline IPSS total score of 18.9 points, 77.1 % 
were responders to silodosin (as assessed by a change 
from baseline in the IPSS total score of at least 25 %). 
Approximately half of the patients reported an 
improvement in the most bothersome symptoms 
complained at baseline by the patients (i.e. nocturia, 
frequency, decreased stream, urgency, terminal dribbling 
and incomplete emptying), as assessed by the ICS-male 
questionnaire.

II and PL 
on the basis of a re-evaluation of the benefit risk balance, 
the CHMP is of the opinion that the quality, safety and 
efficacy of Urorec continues to be adequately and 
sufficiently demonstrated and therefore considered that the 
benefit risk profile of Urorec continues to be favourable in 
the treatment of the signs and symptoms of benign 
prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The CHMP recommends the 
renewal of the Marketing Authorisation with unlimited 
validity.

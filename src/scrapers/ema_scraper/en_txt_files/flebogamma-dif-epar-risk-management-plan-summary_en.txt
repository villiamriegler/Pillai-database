Summary of risk management plan for Flebogamma DIF (Human 
normal immunoglobulin)  
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Flebogamma DIF. The RMP details 
important risks of Flebogamma DIF, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information 
will be obtained about Flebogamma DIF risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Flebogamma  DIF  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  and  its  package  information  leaflet  give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how it should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Flebogamma DIF should be read in context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part 
of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Flebogamma 
DIF's RMP.  
I. The medicine and what it is used for

Agency (europa.eu). 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to 
minimise or further characterise the risks  
Important risks of Flebogamma DIF, together with measures to minimize such risks are outlined 
below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific  information  (such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use)  in  the 
Package Insert and Patient Information addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Flebogamma DIF is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Flebogamma DIF are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important 
risks  can  be  regarded  as  identified  or  potential.  Identified  risks  are  concerns  for  which  there  is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of Flebogamma DIF. Potential risks are concerns for which 
an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information 
on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected.

II.B Summary of important risks 
Important identified risk: Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
including 
reactions, 
Hypersensitivity 
life-threatening 
anaphylactic  reactions  can  occur  even  when  a  previous 
administration  has  been  tolerated  (including  a  negative  test). 
Caution is therefore needed with every dose, even if previous 
tests have been made. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk  factors  associated  with  anaphylactic  reactions  are  IgA 
deficiency and history of hypersensitivity reactions. Most often, 
hypersensitivity  reactions  are  associated  with  first-time 
exposure as well as with rapid infusion rate. 
Risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk communication: 
-  EU SmPC section 4.3 Contraindications 
-  EU SmPC section 4.4 Special warnings and 
precautions for use  
-  EU SmPC section 4.8 Undesirable effects 
Additional risk minimisation measures: 
None proposed. 
Important identified risk: Haemolysis 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Haemolytic  anaemia  can  develop  subsequent  to  immune 
globulin  products  therapy  due  to  enhanced  red  blood  cells 
(RBC)  sequestration.  Immune  globulin  products  recipients 
should  be  monitored  for  clinical  signs  and  symptoms  of 
haemolysis. 
The following risk factors are associated with the development 
of  haemolysis:  high  doses,  whether  given  as  a  single 
administration or divided over several days; non-0 blood group; 
and underlying inflammatory state.

Important identified risk: Thromboembolic events  
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
A  link  between  the  use  of  immune  globulin  products  and 
thromboembolic  events  has  been  established  and  there  is 
evidence  that  suggests  that  there  are  procoagulant  proteins 
present in the medicine, in addition to other factors such as an 
increase in viscosity that could lead some patients to experience 
a thromboembolic event. 
factors  may 
Risk 
include:  advanced  age,  prolonged 
immobilization, hypercoagulable conditions, history of venous 
or  arterial  thrombosis,  use  of  estrogens,  indwelling  central 
vascular  catheters,  hyperviscosity  and  cardiovascular  risk 
factors.  Thrombosis  may  occur  in  the  absence  of  known  risk 
factors.

Important potential risk: Neutropenia  
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
A  transient  decrease  in  neutrophil  count  and/or  episodes  of 
neutropenia,  sometimes  severe,  have  been  reported  after 
treatment  with  IVIGs.  This  typically  occurs  within  hours  or 
days  after  IVIG  administration  and  resolves  spontaneously 
within 7 to 14 days. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
All patients receiving the infusion are exposed to the risk.

*This applies to Flebogamma DIF 100 mg/ml SmPC only  
Important potential risk: Theoretical risk of pathogen infection  
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Because this product is made from human blood, it may carry a 
risk  of  transmitting  infectious  agents.  The  risk  that  such 
products will transmit an infectious agent has been reduced by 
screening plasma donors for prior exposure to certain viruses, 
by testing for the presence of certain current virus infections, 
and  by  inactivating  and/or  removing  certain  viruses.  Despite 
these  measures,  such  products  can  still  potentially  transmit 
infectious agent, e.g. viruses and, theoretically, the Creutzfeld-
Jakob  disease  (CJD)  agent.  The  possibility  of  transmitting 
infective agents cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to 
unknown or emerging viruses and other pathogens. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
All patients receiving the infusion are exposed to the risk.

Important potential risk: Interaction with live attenuated vaccines  
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Immunoglobulin administration may impair for a period of at 
least 6 weeks and up to 3 months the efficacy of live attenuated 
virus vaccines such as measles, rubella, mumps and varicella. 
After  administration  of  this  product,  an  interval  of  3  months 
should  elapse  before  vaccination  with  live  attenuated  virus 
vaccines.  In the case of measles, this impairment may persist 
for up to 1 year. Therefore patients receiving measles vaccine 
should have their antibody status checked.

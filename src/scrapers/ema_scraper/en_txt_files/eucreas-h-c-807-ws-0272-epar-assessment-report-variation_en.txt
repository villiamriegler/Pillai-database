Pursuant  to  Article  8  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006,  the  application  included  an  EMA  Decisions 
P/177/2011 (for vildagliptin) and P/169/2010 (for vildagliptin/metformin) on the granting of a product-
specific waiver. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Metformin is an established initial therapeutic agent for diabetes, acting by reducing primarily the 
hepatic glucose output (Davidson and Peters 1997; Consoli, et al. 2004). Sulfonylureas are also 
common anti-diabetics that improve blood glucose levels by stimulating insulin secretion from 
pancreatic β-cells in a non-glucose-dependent manner (Krentz and Bailey 2005). The combination of 
metformin plus a SU is a broadly used dual therapy for the treatment of T2DM. However, many 
patients on dual-combination therapy with metformin and a SU agent do not achieve or maintain 
glycaemic control. In this setting, use of insulin is often the next therapeutic step, although the need of 
parenteral administration makes this option undesirable by many patients.  
Triple oral anti-diabetic (OAD) combinations are an alternative option suggested by guidelines (ADA-
EASD Consensus Algorithm). There are a limited number of therapeutic options to add to 
metformin+SU therapy, in particular drugs that do not increase the risk of hypoglycemia or result in 
weight gain. Hence, there is a need for new anti-diabetic agents to complement the commonly used 
combination of sulfonylurea and metformin in patients with T2DM inadequately controlled on dual OAD 
therapy. 
Complementing the pharmacological effect of metformin and SU on glycemic control, vildagliptin 
enhances the glucose-dependent insulin secretion. It is a potent and selective DPP-4 inhibitor that 
prevents the rapid degradation of endogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent 
insulinotropic peptide that in turn enhances glucose-dependent insulin secretion and suppresses 
glucagon release thereby providing glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. 
Vildagliptin is weight neutral and is associated with low risk of hypoglycemia either as monotherapy or 
in dual combination with metformin, SU, or TZD. 
Vildagliptin is an oral antidiabetic agent which belongs to the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors 
class used for the treatment of T2DM. It was approved in the EU under the name Galvus in September 
2007. Two additional marketing authorisations were granted in EU for duplicate licenses in November 
2008 (Jalra and Xiliarx). The fixed dose combination with metformin was approved in November 2007 
as Eucreas and duplicate licenses in December 2008 (Icandra and Zomarist). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
Updated versions of the ERAs for vildagliptin and vildagliptin/metformin were submitted, as requested 
by CHMP. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/568007/2012  
Page 3/46 
 
 
 
 
Overall, the updated assessments suggest that the placement of the foreseen amounts of vildagliptin 
and vildagliptin/metformin fixed dose combination on the EU market does not constitute any significant 
risk to the environment. 
The updated ERA is acceptable. It should be pointed out, that while this application concerns a new 
indication, the disease population is the same as for previous approvals and the original conclusions on 
the ERA for vildagliptin and vildagliptin/metformin are unchanged. 
2.3.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
One pivotal study was submitted in support of the current application. 
Table 1 Overview of controlled efficacy studies 
T2DM = type 2 diabetes; vilda = vildagliptin 
2.3.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Main clinical study 
Dose selection rationale 
No dose response studies were provided with the current application. The selected vildagliptin 50 mg 
bid dose reflects the recommended dosage in the label as add-on therapy to metformin for patients 
with T2DM. In add-on therapy to metformin for patients with T2DM, vildagliptin at 50 mg bid was 
clinically significant in reducing HbA1c by -1.1%, as compared to placebo, after 24 weeks of treatment 
in patients inadequately controlled with metformin (CLAF237A2303). Vildagliptin 50 mg bid was chosen 
for this study since patients on metformin-based therapy benefited more from the 50 mg bid regimen 
than the once daily regimen. This is likely due to an effect of the evening dose on overnight hepatic 
glucose production, and it also was presumed that patients with more advanced diabetes not controlled 
on dual OAD therapy would benefit from this overnight effect on hepatic glucose production of the 
evening dose. 
The rationale for the choice of vildagliptin dose is accepted. The dose approved for the combination of 
vildagliptin with metformin (50 mg BID) was applied in the study. It should be noted that the approved 
posology for vildagliptin in combination with SU is 50 mg OD as vildagliptin 100 mg daily was no more 
effective than vildagliptin 50 mg OD. In this previous study, the incidence of hypoglycaemia was low in 
combination with SU, but there was more hypoglycaemia events observed with vildagliptin 100 mg/day 
(6 patients = 3.6% of patients) than with placebo (1 patient = 0.6% of patients). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/568007/2012  
Page 4/46 
 
 
 
 
 
Considering that patients already on bi-therapy (Metformin and SU) are more difficult to treat than 
patients on monotherapy (Metformin or SU) and that vildagliptin is used at 100 mg/day with 
metformin, the choice of a dose of 100 mg for a triple therapy makes sense. Nevertheless, 
hypoglycaemia and possibility to decrease the dose of SU should be carefully assessed.  
Study design (CLAF237A23152) 
This was a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of vildagliptin as add-on 
therapy to metformin plus glimepiride in T2DM patients with inadequate glycemic control (HbA1c ≥7.5 
and ≤11%) with dual combination of metformin (≥1500 mg) and glimepiride (≥4 mg). The study 
consisted of screening period, up to 12-week titration and/or stabilization period of the glimepiride 
dose and 24-week double blind treatment period (Figure 1). 
Figure 1 Study design of study CLAF237A23152 
Patients with T2DM not adequately controlled on a stable dose of OADs for at least 12 weeks prior to 
screening visit were included in the clinical study. Acceptable background therapy prior to enrollment 
included metformin ≥1500 mg as monotherapy (HbA1c ≥ 8.5% and ≤11%) or dual combination of 
metformin ≥1500 mg plus sulfonylurea (SU), metformin ≥1500 mg plus thiazolidinedione (TZD), or 
metformin ≥1500 mg plus glinide (HbA1c ≥7.5% and ≤11%) stable for at least 12 weeks prior to the 
screening visit. Eligible patients continued their current metformin treatment ≥1500 mg throughout 
the study. Patients on background therapy with OADs other than glimepiride had to agree to switch to 
glimepiride to be included in the clinical trial. Patients with a history of intolerance to SU were not 
eligible for this trial. 
Screening period 
Patients attended a screening Visit 1 where the inclusion/exclusion criteria were assessed. Based on 
background OAD therapy, patients who met all inclusion/exclusion criteria could either proceed to 
randomization or enter into the titration and/or stabilization period with glimepiride as described 
below. Screening period was to be not longer than 1-2 weeks. 
Titration period 
After screening visit eligible patients taking stable dose of metformin ≥1500 mg + glimepiride ≥4 mg 
for at least 12 weeks proceeded directly to Visit 2 and were randomized to the 24 week treatment 
period. 
After screening eligible patients on dual therapy of metformin (≥1500 mg) plus more than half-of 
maximum daily dose of SU labeled for the region (or glimepiride ≥2 mg or <4 mg) proceeded directly 
to Visit 102 (Week -10), discontinued their current SU therapy and were switched to 4 mg glimepiride 
at that visit to enter 10 week run-in stabilization period. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/568007/2012

After screening, eligible patients on dual therapy with metformin ≥1500 mg plus less than half-dose of 
maximum daily dose of SU labeled for the region or on dual therapy with metformin ≥1500 mg plus <2 
mg glimepiride or on dual therapy with metformin ≥1500 mg plus TZD or glinide discontinued their 
current SU, TZD or glinide therapy were switched to glimepiride 2 mg at visit 101 (Week -12), up-
titrated to 4 mg in 2 weeks at Visit 102 (Week - 10) and then continued in a 10-week stabilization 
period. Eligible patients on monotherapy metformin ≥1500 mg entered a titration period for 
glimepiride at Visit 101 (Week -12) as described for TZD or glinide therapy. 
At Visit 102 (Week -10), prior to up titration to 4 mg glimepiride, a finger stick capillary glucose 
measurement was performed at the investigator site using a glucometer. Patients with fasting plasma 
glucose >7 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) or blood glucose >6.3 mmol/L (113 mg/dL) were up-titrated to 4 mg 
glimepiride if the titration was not contraindicated in the investigator’s opinion due to the risk of 
hypoglycemia. Patients who up-titrated were eligible to continue in the study. 
Stabilization period 
During the stabilization period each patient received two phone calls from investigator site (Visit 103 
and Visit 104) to monitor AEs and patient compliance with background metformin plus glimepiride 
therapy. When warranted for safety reasons patients were to attend unscheduled visits during any 
time of titration and stabilization periods. Patients who could not tolerate metformin ≥1500 mg plus 
glimepiride ≥4 mg therapy during stabilization run-in period were discontinued from the study. At the 
end of the stabilization period, patients attended Visit 105 (Week -1) to assess eligibility for HbA1c 
≥7.5 and ≤11% and other inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
Patients proceeded to randomization as soon as HbA1c eligibility was confirmed by central lab results. 
The overall design is acceptable. The titration and stabilisation periods ensured that patients included 
in the study were on adequate doses of both metformin and glimepiride. 
Study Participants  
The population in this study consisted of male and female (non-fertile or of childbearing potential using 
a medically approved birth control method) with T2DM, 18-80 years old and with Body Mass Index 
(BMI) ≥22 to ≤45 kg/m2 at Visit 1. 
Patients were to be inadequately controlled (HbA1c ≥8.5% and ≤11.0%) with metformin (≥1500 mg) 
monotherapy, or patients inadequately controlled (HbA1c ≥7.5 and ≤11.0%) with a combination of 
metformin (≥1500 mg) plus an SU, glinide or TZD.  
Eligible patients on background therapy with OAD other than glimepiride were switched to glimepiride 
and underwent titration and stabilization period as described in above. 
At the end of stabilization period only patients with HbA1c levels of ≥7.5 and ≤11% at Week - 1 (Visit 
105) were eligible for randomization at Visit 2 (BL). The dose of metformin was maintained unchanged 
throughout the study.  
Patients were excluded if treated with weight control products, DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 
analogues/mimetics or insulin within the previous 6 months, growth hormone within the previous 6 
months and any oral anti-diabetic therapy other than metformin, SU, TZD and glinide within 12 weeks 
of Visit 1. 
Patients with a history or evidence of serious medical conditions, including current diagnosis of 
congestive heart failure (NYHA III or IV), myocardial infarction (MI) within the past 6 months, coronary 
artery bypass surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention within the past 6 months, stroke or 
transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the past 6 months, unstable angina within the past 3 months or 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/568007/2012

sustained and clinically relevant ventricular arrhythmia were also excluded as were patients with 
second or third degree AV block without a pace maker or long QT syndrome or QTc > 500ms. 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were adequate. Of note, patients with significant CV disease were 
excluded. This is acceptable. Current experience regarding CV safety with vildagliptin and use in 
patients with CHF has been assessed both in procedures EMEA/H/C/771/WS/06/G and 
EMEA/H/771/WS/187. It was concluded that there was no indication of an increased risk of CV events 
with vildagliptin in a population which included 16-18 % high risk patients. Furthermore, analysis of 
data in patients with documented CHF did not indicate an increased incidence of overall AEs or cardiac 
(i.e. arrhythmic, heart failure-related or ischaemic) AEs with vildagliptin relative to all comparators. 
Although there are limitations to the available data, there are currently no safety signals with regards 
to cardiac safety.  
Treatments 
Permitted dose adjustments and interruptions of study treatment 
Vildagliptin/placebo 
Study drug dose adjustments were not permitted. 
Metformin 
The dose of metformin (≥ 1500 mg) used at Visit 1 was to be maintained unchanged throughout the 
study. A patient whose dose of metformin was changed was to be discontinued from the trial. 
Glimepiride (blister pack 2 mg/ 4 mg): guidelines for dose reduction 
The dose of glimepiride (blister pack 2 mg/4 mg) could be adjusted downward to a maximum tolerated 
dose at the investigators discretion after Visit 2 for the following reasons: 
• 
hypoglycemic event requiring the assistance of another person to treat 
•  3 hypoglycemic events per week 
•  3 asymptomatic low glucose values (i.e. plasma glucose values <3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL) or 
blood glucose values <2.8 mmol/L (50 mg/dL)) per week 
If the dose was reduced, the patient remained on that dose of glimepiride for the remainder of the 
trial. Patients who could not tolerate the minimal dose of glimepiride 2 mg were discontinued. 
Study treatment could be temporarily interrupted for documented reasons such as AEs. However, 
treatment was restarted as soon as possible.  
Rescue medication 
Rescue medication (per investigator discretion, insulin or pioglitazone) could be used in addition to 
ongoing study medication at or after Visit 3 (Week 6) for those patients who were not achieving a 
satisfactory therapeutic effect and whose elevated glucose was not due to illness, or other incidental 
circumstance potentially causing deterioration of glucose control. 
Rescue medication was to be prescribed according to clinical judgment and the corresponding package 
insert. 
Unsatisfactory therapeutic effect (UTE) was defined as follows: 
•  Starting from Visit 3 (Week 6) up to Visit 4 (Week 12): FPG >240 mg/dL* (13.3 mmol/L), 
confirmed by a repeat measure within 3 working days in the absence of an intercurrent illness 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/568007/2012  
Page 7/46 
 
 
 
 
•  Starting from Visit 4 (Week 12) up to Visit 6 (Week 24): FPG >200 mg/dL* (11.1 mmol/L), 
confirmed by a repeat measure within 3 working days in the absence of an intercurrent illness 
•  Symptoms of worsening hyperglycemia (i.e. polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss) regardless of 
visit, in the absence of any intercurrent illness or other incidental circumstances potentially 
causing deterioration of glucose control. 
* Two elevated FPG levels within 3 days, at least one of which was completed by the central laboratory, in the 
absence of any intercurrent illness or other incidental circumstances potentially causing deterioration of glucose 
control. 
Use of rescue medication was to be recorded on the eCRF with an indication of whether the rescue 
treatment was administered for ≥5 consecutive days or ≥7 days over a 30 day period. 
Concomitant treatment 
Treatment with GLP-1 analogues or mimetics, other DPP-4 inhibitors, any oral anti-diabetic therapy 
other than study medication, chronic corticosteroid treatment or growth hormone analogs was 
prohibited. 
All other prior and concomitant non-study medications (not specifically contraindicated in the exclusion 
criteria) were allowed. 
Treatments given during the study were adequate. Instructions for when to introduce rescue 
medication were in place and it should be noted that the criteria were strengthened over time. 
Objectives and endpoints 
The primary efficacy objective was to demonstrate the efficacy of add-on therapy with vildagliptin 50 
mg bid to metformin and glimepiride in patients with T2DM by testing the hypothesis that the HbA1c 
reduction with vildagliptin 50 mg bid is superior to that with placebo added to metformin and 
glimepiride after 24 weeks of treatment. Primary efficacy parameter was the change in HbA1c from 
baseline to study endpoint in the FAS. 
Secondary efficacy objectives were: 
• 
• 
• 
To demonstrate the efficacy of add-on therapy with vildagliptin 50 mg bid to metformin and 
glimepiride in patients with T2DM by testing the hypothesis that the FPG reduction with 
vildagliptin 50 mg bid was superior to that with placebo after 24 weeks of treatment. 
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of vildagliptin as add-on therapy to metformin and 
glimepiride in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with combination of 
metformin and glimepiride as compared to placebo after 24-week treatment. 
To evaluate the responder rate of vildagliptin 50 mg bid as add-on therapy to metformin and 
glimepiride in patients with type 2 diabetes, as compared to placebo after 24-week treatment. 
The chosen objectives and endpoints were adequate. The primary objective is in line with the recently 
adopted “Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of diabetes” 
(CPMP/EWP/1080 Rev.1). 
Sample size 
A sample size of 246 completed patients (123 per arm) was targeted. Assuming a drop-out rate of 
15%, about 290 patients (145 patients per arm) were to be randomized with an equal randomization 
ratio 1:1 to the two treatment groups. This sample size would generally ensure 90% power with a one-
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/568007/2012  
Page 8/46 
 
 
 
 
 
sided significance level of 2.5% to declare superiority of vildagliptin 50mg bid over placebo in HbA1c 
reduction (%) from baseline after 24weeks of treatment, assuming a clinically relevant difference of 
0.5 absolute units to placebo and a standard deviation of 1.2 %, which was consistent with the results 
of the study LAF237A2305 and LAF237A2303, which had similar designs. 
The sample size calculations were adequate. 
Randomisation and blinding 
Eligible patients were randomized at Visit 2 via Interactive Response Technology (IRT) to receive either 
vildagliptin 50 mg bid or placebo in a ratio of 1:1 in addition to their continued metformin ≥1500 mg 
plus glimepiride ≥4 mg treatment.  
Patients, investigator staff, persons performing the assessments, and data analysts remained blind to 
the identity of the treatment from the time of randomization until database lock. 
Unblinding only occurred in the cases of patient emergencies and at the conclusion of the study. Once 
the patient was unblinded during the study, he/she was to be discontinued. 
Only after the trial was completed, the data file verified, and protocol violations determined, were the 
remaining drug codes broken and used for data analysis. 
The randomisation and blinding procedures were adequate. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis sets 
The following analysis data sets were defined: 
The Randomized Set (RAN) consisted of all randomized patients. 
The Full analysis set (FAS) consisted of all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study 
medication and had at least one post-randomization efficacy parameter measurement. Following the 
intent-to-treat principle, subjects were analyzed according to the treatment they are assigned to at 
randomization. 
The Safety Set (SAF) consisted of all patients that received at least one dose of study drug. Patients 
were analyzed according to the treatment received. Note that the safety set allowed the inclusion of 
non-randomized patients who received the study drug in error. 
The Per Protocol set (PP) included patients in one of the following three categories: 
• 
• 
• 
FAS patients who did not take rescue medication and completed at least 22 weeks of treatment 
with no major protocol deviations and had a valid assessment of the primary efficacy variable 
HbA1c within 7 days after the last dose of study drug. 
FAS patients who took rescue medication according to criteria mentioned in the protocol, and 
had no major protocol deviations prior to taking rescue medication, and had a valid 
assessment of the primary efficacy variable HbA1c prior to or at initiation of rescue medication. 
FAS patients that discontinued from study drug due to unsatisfactory therapeutic response as 
per protocol, had a valid assessment of the primary efficacy variable HbA1c within 7 days after 
the last dose of study drug, and had no major protocol deviations prior to discontinuation. 
Major protocol deviations were pre-specified prior to unblinding treatment analysis. Patients who added 
rescue medication and then discontinued for unsatisfactory therapeutic response were considered in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/568007/2012  
Page 9/46 
 
 
 
 
the second category. Major protocol deviations were pre-specified prior to unblinding treatment codes 
for analyses. 
Statistical hypothesis, model, and method of analysis 
The primary efficacy variable was change from baseline in HbA1c at study endpoint, assessed in the 
Full analysis set. The test for the superiority of vildagliptin 50 mg bid to placebo as add-on therapy to 
metformin plus glimepiride for the effect of reducing HbA1c after 24 weeks of treatment, was based on 
the following null hypotheses and one-sided alternative hypotheses at an alpha level of 2.5%: 
H0: δ Vilda 50 mg bid=δ Placebo versus Ha: δ Vilda 50 mg bid < δ Placebo, 
Where δs are the mean change from baseline at Week 24 endpoint in HbA1c in the treatment group 
indicated. 
An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model including terms for treatment, baseline HbA1c (centered by 
subtracting the overall mean baseline HbA1c of all treatment groups and pooled center was used to 
compare the treatment effect. The possibility of a treatment by pooled center interaction or a 
treatment by baseline HbA1c interaction was examined, although the interaction terms were not 
included in the primary analysis model. The least squares mean (“adjusted mean”) change from 
baseline for each treatment group, the difference in the least squares mean changes between the two 
treatment groups (vildagliptin – placebo), and the two-sided adjusted 95% confidence interval along 
with the p-value for the difference was obtained from the primary analysis model. The analysis of the 
primary efficacy variable using the FAS was the primary basis of conclusion. The analysis based on the 
Per Protocol Set was performed to assess the robustness of the conclusion. The same testing 
procedure as for the FAS analysis was used. 
For the secondary efficacy variable, the percentage of patients meeting predefined responder criteria 
based on HbA1c targets at study endpoint as well as the percentage of patients meeting was computed 
and compared using a Chi-square test in the FAS. Three definitions of responders were defined: 
1.  HbA1c endpoint < 7% 
2.  HbA1c endpoint <7% in patients with baseline HbA1c ≤ 8% 
3.  HbA1c endpoint ≤ 6.5% 
The change from baseline in FPG at study endpoint was analyzed using ANCOVA model in the same 
way as the primary efficacy variable. 
Subgroup analysis 
The primary efficacy variable change from baseline in HbA1c was assessed in the FAS by descriptive 
statistics across subpopulations of patients defined by baseline HbA1c category (≤ 8% and >8%, and 
≤ 9% and > 9%),  BMI (< 30 kg/m2, ≥ 30 kg/m2, at Visit 1), age (< 65 years, ≥ 65 years at Visit 1), 
gender and race. 
Within each subgroup, summaries of absolute values and changes from baseline in HbA1c by visit were 
presented. The analysis and summaries used the FAS.  
Sensitivity analysis with regard to handling rescue medication 
As sensitivity analysis to the method of handing rescue medication related data (censored at the start 
of rescue medication), a similar ANCOVA model as for the primary variable change from baseline at 
Week 24 in HbA1c was performed in FAS with all data collected up to and including Week 24. For this 
sensitivity analysis, the Week 24 endpoint was defined as the measurement obtained at the last post-
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/568007/2012  
Page 10/46 
 
 
 
 
 
baseline study visit prior to or at scheduled Visit 6 (Week 24), regardless of whether it is obtained at a 
scheduled or unscheduled visit, and regardless of whether patients take rescue medication or not. 
Repeated measures analysis 
As a sensitivity analysis to the LOCF approach, the change from baseline in HbA1c at all available time 
points from all patients in the FAS was analyzed using a restricted maximum likelihood (REML)-based 
repeated measure approach. The treatment effects at the end of study visit were estimated from the 
model and compared.  
Handling on missing values/discontinuations 
Data after discontinuations for any reason were imputed by carrying the last on-treatment 
measurement (scheduled or unscheduled) forward (LOCF) through the end of trial. 
Patients who started rescue medication were considered as censored from the start date of the rescue 
medication onward. Data after the start of rescue medication were imputed by the last on-treatment 
measurement before or at the start of rescue medication, carried forward (LOCF) through the final 
schedule study visit. 
Patients without a baseline or without a post-baseline measurement were excluded from the primary 
efficacy analysis. 
Safety and demographic data 
The number and percentage of patients with treatment emergent adverse events was summarized by 
primary system organ class, preferred term, maximum severity and relationship to study drug. The 
number and percentage of patients who died, had serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse events 
leading to discontinuation and adverse events requiring temporarily study drug interruption were 
tabulated separately. The incidence rates of AEs confirmed by various adjudication committees, AEs of 
predefined risk and hypoglycemic events were also summarized. 
Hematology and biochemistry data were summarized for absolute values, changes from baseline, and 
treatment emergent notable abnormalities. Vital signs, body weight ECG findings and urinalysis by 
category were evaluated descriptively. 
Patient disposition, Demographic and baseline background characteristics data were summarized by 
treatment. 
The statistical methods were adequate. 
2.3.2.  Results 
Disposition of patients 
A total of 564 patients were enrolled out of which 246 patients were discontinued during the screening 
period. The randomization scheme in study CLAF237A23152 resulted in 1:1 allocation for vildagliptin 
50 mg bid + metformin + glimepiride (hereunder referred to as “vildagliptin”) and placebo + 
metformin + glimepiride (hereunder referred to as “placebo”); 158 and 160 patients respectively 
enrolled in the trial. There from, 144 and 155 patients respectively completed the study. The 
percentage of patients who discontinued was higher in the vildagliptin group (8.9%) than in the 
placebo group (3.1%) mainly due to a greater percentage of patients who withdrew consent (4.4% vs. 
1.3%). Discontinuations due to AEs were infrequent and similar in both treatment groups (one patient, 
0.6%, in each group) (Table 2). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/568007/2012  
Page 11/46 
 
 
 
 
Table 2 Patient disposition (Randomized Set) 
Discontinuations were more common in the vildagliptin treated group compared to placebo, mainly due 
to more withdrawals of consent and administrative problems. Although withdrawal of consent may 
include patients who are not satisfied with the treatment, the overall discontinuation rates were low 
and balanced between groups, especially with regards to AEs (only two patients discontinued for this 
reason, one in each group). 
Recruitment 
A total of 40 centers in 11 countries enrolled at least one patient (number of centers in brackets): 
Australia (3), Germany (3), Hungary (2), India (10), Italy (2), Korea (5), Mexico (4), Philippines (2), 
Romania (4), Taiwan (4) and United Kingdom (1). Fifteen out of 40 centers were located in Europe. 
Study initiation date: 12-Oct-2010 (first patient first visit) 
Study completion date: 21-Nov-2011 (last patient last visit) 
Conduct of the study 
There were no amendments to the protocol. 
There were no changes from the protocol in study conduct. 
Some changes and clarifications to the planned analyses were made. 
Protocol deviations  
The most frequent major protocol deviation that led to an exclusion from the PP set was “less than 22 
weeks of randomized double-blind treatment and patient discontinued due to reasons other than 
unsatisfactory therapeutic response”. This deviation was reported in 8.2% patients in the vildagliptin 
group and 3.1% of patients in the placebo group, which is consistent with the higher discontinuation 
rate in the vildagliptin group as shown in Table 2. These patients were included in the full analysis set. 
All other protocol deviations leading to exclusion from any analysis population were infrequent and 
with no major differences between treatment groups.  
No major differences between treatment groups were observed for other protocol deviations not 
leading to exclusion from any analysis population except “FPG ≥200 mg/dL at weeks 12- 24 and no 
repeat or study drug not stopped”. This deviation was more frequently reported in the placebo group 
(11.3% of patients) compared to the vildagliptin group (4.4%).

The changes and clarifications made to the planned analyses are not considered to affect the outcome 
or the interpretation of the study. Protocol deviations were rather few and do not evoke any concerns 
regarding the conduct of the study.  
Baseline data 
In pivotal study CLAF237A23152, both treatment groups were well-balanced for all patient 
demographic characteristics at baseline (Table 3). Mean age was 55 years in both groups, and 
approximately 20% of patients were ≥65 years of age. 
The proportion of male/female patients was almost balanced in both treatment groups. Approximately 
73% of the patients were Asian (mostly Indians: 49.7%, and Chinese: 10.4%), followed by Caucasian 
(22.6%), with a balanced distribution between treatment groups. Mean BMI was 28 kg/m2 for both 
treatment groups. Most patients (72.6%) were non-obese (BMI < 30 kg/m2). Overall, there were no 
major differences between the treatment groups.

Demography information is collected on the day of the screening measurement (Week -14, Visit 1). 
The groups were well balanced with regards to demographic characteristics. About 20 % of patients 
were elderly although only about 4 % were older than 75 years. The majority of patients were Asian 
(73 %) and only 23 % were Caucasian, consequently the BMI was rather low. This is acceptable since 
no clinically relevant differences in the effect of vildagliptin have been observed between Asians and 
Caucasians. 
Patient baseline background characteristics in study CLAF237A23152 were comparable between both 
treatment groups (Table 4). Mean HbA1c values was 8.7% and mean FPG value was 9.3 mmol/L for 
the vildagliptin group, while the mean HbA1c was 8.8% and mean FPG was 9.5 mmol/L for the placebo 
group. The vildagliptin group had a few more patients with HbA1c less or equal to 8% (30.4% vs. 
22.5% in the placebo group). Mean duration of type 2 diabetes was similar between the two treatment 
groups (vildagliptin: 7.1 and placebo: 7.5 years). Also renal function, as measured by GFR (MDRD), 
was similarly distributed between treatment groups. Overall, there were no major differences between 
the treatment groups.

Most patients (122 vildagliptin patients and 132 placebo patients) received metformin ≥1500 mg/day 
+ glimepiride at study entry. The mean duration of metformin use (vildagliptin group: 43.8 months 
and placebo group: 41.3 months) and mean metformin daily dose (1790 mg/day vs. 1769 mg/day, 
respectively) in these patients was comparable for both treatment groups. 
The mean duration of glimepiride use (26.5 vs. 25.7 months, respectively) and mean daily dose (4.4 
vs. 4.5 mg/day, respectively) in these patients was also comparable for both treatment groups.

Notably some patients with HbA1c below the inclusion criterion of 7.5 % were included in both 
treatment groups. Overall, 36 % of patients had mild to moderate renal impairment. According to the 
SmPC, patients with moderate renal impairment should be treated with vildagliptin 50 mg rather 100 
mg. Exclusion criteria includes: “Clinically significant renal dysfunction as indicated by serum creatinine 
levels at Visit 1 and Visit 105: serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL (132 μmol/L) for males and ≥ 1.4 mg/dL 
(123 μmol/L) for females”. Thus, ten patients are outside the inclusion criteria. 
Concomitant medication 
The majority of the patients were taking concomitant medications during the randomized double-blind 
period as well as significant non-drug therapies (vildagliptin group: 90.5% and placebo group: 80.6%).

Most commonly taken concomitant medications during the study period were antihypertensive 
medications (vildagliptin group: 53.8% vs. placebo group: 57.5%) and lipid lowering medications 
(vildagliptin group: 36.7% vs. placebo group: 37.5%). The main classes of the antihypertensive 
medication were plain ACE inhibitors (vildagliptin group: 19.6% vs. placebo group: 17.5%), plain 
angiotensin II antagonists (vildagliptin group: 13.3% vs. placebo group: 18.1%) and dihydropyridine 
derivatives (vildagliptin group: 17.1% vs. placebo group: 21.3%). The main lipid-lowering medications 
were statins (vildagliptin group: 29.7% vs. placebo group: 30.6%). 
The baseline background characteristics were balanced between groups and are as expected for the 
target population.  
Numbers analysed 
Populations for analyses are summarized in Table 5. Almost all patients were included in the Full 
analysis set and the Safety set, and more than 90% of patients in both treatment groups were 
included in the Per protocol set. 
Table 5 Number (%) of patients in the analysis sets (Randomized Set) 
More patients in the vildagliptin group than in the placebo group were excluded from the FAS and the 
PP sets, however, exclusion rates were low. 
Outcomes and estimation 
In the pivotal study [Study CLAF237A23152], the primary efficacy endpoint was the change in HbA1c 
from baseline to study endpoint, censored by rescue medication, in the FAS. The ANCOVA results for 
the change in HbA1c from baseline to endpoint for both FAS and Per protocol set are summarized in 
Table 6. 
Baseline HbA1c values were comparable between both treatment groups. Vildagliptin 50 mg bid as 
add-on to metformin and glimepiride therapy demonstrated a clinically significant reduction in HbA1c 
from baseline to study endpoint of -1.01% compared to -0.25% with placebo, and the difference to 
placebo of -0.76% was statistically significant (p<0.001). 
Results in the Per Protocol set were similar as observed for the FAS.

A clinically relevant reduction of HbA1c was observed when vildagliptin was added to dual therapy with 
metformin and glimepiride, compared to placebo. Similar results were observed for both the FAS and 
the PP populations. 
Secondary efficacy variables in study CLAF237A23152 were responder rates based on the proportion of 
patients reaching predefined HbA1c and change in FPG. 
Responder rates based on HbA1c reduction were distinctly higher in the vildagliptin group than in the 
placebo group for all defined categories, and differences between treatment groups were statistically 
significant for all responder categories (Table 7). Almost 30% of vildagliptin-treated patients reached 
HbA1c < 7% target compared to 6% of placebo-treated patients and 13.2% patients in the vildagliptin 
group achieved HbA1c ≤ 6.5% vs. 1.3% in the placebo group.

ANCOVA results for the change from baseline to endpoint in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) are 
summarized in Table 8. 
Baseline FPG values were comparable between both treatment groups. Consistent with the results for 
HbA1c, the addition of vildagliptin to treatment with metformin and glimepiride resulted in a clinically 
relevant reduction in FPG of -1.11 mmol/L compared to nearly no change in the placebo group 
(+0.02 mmol/L). The difference to placebo of -1.13 mmol/L was clinically and statistically significant 
(p<0.001). Results for the Per Protocol set were similar as observed for the Full analysis set.

The outcomes of the secondary endpoints both support the primary endpoint. A relevant responder 
rate would remain if the entire randomized set was taken into account (43/158 = 27.2 %). 
Ancillary analyses 
In study CLAF237A23152, mean changes in HbA1c were summarized for the subgroups by HbA1c 
baseline category, baseline BMI, age, gender and race. 
Change in HbA1c by HbA1c baseline category 
Consistent with previous studies in the vildagliptin program, patients with a higher baseline value 
(HbA1c > 8%) showed a greater mean reduction in HbA1c from baseline to study endpoint (vildagliptin 
group: -1.10% and placebo group -0.38%) compared to patients with HbA1c ≤ 8% (vildagliptin group: 
-0.67% and placebo group: +0.23%). 
Similar results were obtained for baseline categories HbA1c > 9% and ≤ 9%. Change from baseline to 
study endpoint in patients with HbA1c >9% were -1.38% in the vildagliptin group and -0.76% in the 
placebo group and in patients with baseline HbA1c ≤ 9% mean changes were -0.72% for vildagliptin 
and +0.05% for placebo. 
Change in HbA1c by BMI category at baseline 
No effect of baseline BMI on changes in HbA1c was observed. Patients with a BMI <30 kg/m2 showed 
a mean change in HbA1c from baseline at study endpoint of -0.98% in the vildagliptin and -0.25% in 
the placebo groups; patients with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 had a mean change of - 0.96% in the vildagliptin 
and -0.22% in the placebo group. 
Change in HbA1c by age category 
No age-related effect on the difference between vildagliptin and placebo for the endpoint change in 
HbA1c was determined. Mean change in HbA1c from baseline at study endpoint in patients < 65 years 
were -0.92% for the vildagliptin group and -0.21% for the placebo group; the corresponding changes 
in patients ≥ 65 years were -1.20 % for the vildagliptin group and - 0.34% for the placebo group. 
Change in HbA1c by gender 
There were no differences between genders with regard to the difference between vildagliptin 
and placebo for the changes from baseline in HbA1c. The mean changes in HbA1c from baseline at 
study endpoint in male patients were -1.03% for the vildagliptin group and -0.38% for the placebo 
group; and the corresponding changes in females were -0.92% for the vildagliptin group and -0.12% 
for the placebo group. 
Change in HbA1c by race 
Vildagliptin demonstrated similar glucose-lowering efficacy in sub-groups by race category. Asian 
patients (73% of all study population, including mostly Indians, see Table 3) showed a mean change in 
HbA1c from baseline to study endpoint of -0.96% in the vildagliptin group and -0.23% in the placebo 
group (baseline HbA1c 8.80% for the vildagliptin group and 8.92% for the placebo group); for 
Caucasian patients (23% of all study population) the mean changes in HbA1c were -1.05% for the 
vildagliptin group and -0.21% for the placebo group (baseline HbA1c 8.58% for the vildagliptin group 
and 8.47% for the placebo group). The HbA1c reduction in these sub-groups was clinically relevant and 
similar to HbA1c reduction in the overall study population. The number of patients in the other race 
categories were too small to draw meaningful conclusions. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/568007/2012  
Page 19/46 
 
 
 
 
 
The subgroups analysis did not reveal any new findings. A greater effect was observed for patients 
with higher HbA1c at baseline, which is in line with previous findings. No change in effect by age, BMI, 
gender or race was observed.  
Clinical studies in special populations 
No studies in special population were performed. It should be noted that 21 % of patients were older 
than 65 (29 on vildagliptin and 38 on placebo) and overall 33 % of patients had mild renal impairment 
and 3 % had moderate renal impairment.  
2.3.3.  Discussion 
The scope of the current type II variation is to add a new indication for both vildagliptin and the fixed 
vildagliptin/metformin combination for use of vildagliptin in triple combination with metformin and SU. 
Data from one clinical study has been provided. No dose finding study was performed. The vildagliptin 
dose selected corresponds to the already approved dosing regimen for the combination of vildagliptin 
with metformin (50 mg BID). It should be noted that the approved posology for vildagliptin in 
combination with SU is 50 mg OD as the additional effect of vildagliptin 100 mg daily was not 
considered to outweigh the observed increase in hypoglycaemia. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The study was generally well designed and conducted as reflected by relatively few protocol deviations. 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria were adequate and would identify a representative population. Of 
note, patients with significant CV disease were excluded. However, current experience regarding CV 
safety with vildagliptin and use in patients with CHF has been assessed both in procedures 
EMEA/H/C/771/WS/06/G and EMEA/H/771/WS/187. Although there are limitations to the available 
data, there are currently no safety signals with regards to cardiac safety. The exclusion of these 
patients can be accepted since the study is not sized to detect rare events. 
The study included titration and stabilisation periods of sufficient duration to ensure that patients 
included in the study were on adequate doses of both metformin and glimepiride. Instructions for when 
to introduce rescue medication were in place and it should be noted that the criteria were strengthened 
over time. 
The primary objective, HbA1c change from baseline, is in line with the recently adopted “Guideline on 
clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of diabetes” (CPMP/EWP/1080 Rev.1). The 
secondary endpoints (FPG change from baseline and responder rates) are relevant. Statistical methods 
were adequate. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The baseline demographic and background characteristics were balanced between groups and the 
population recruited is considered representative for the target population. The mean baseline HbA1c 
was 8.7 and 8.8 % for vildagliptin and placebo respectively. About 20 % of patients were elderly 
although only about 4 % were older than 75 years. The majority of patients were Asian (73 %) and 
only 23 % were Caucasian. This is acceptable since no clinically relevant differences in the effect of 
vildagliptin have been observed between Asians and Caucasians. Overall, 36 % of patients had mild to 
moderate renal impairment. 
Discontinuations were few but slightly more common in the vildagliptin treated group compared to 
placebo, mainly due to more withdrawals of consent and administrative problems. Slightly more

patients in the vildagliptin group than in the placebo group were excluded from the FAS and the PP 
sets, however, exclusion rates were low. 
A clinically relevant reduction of HbA1c was observed when vildagliptin was added to dual therapy with 
metformin and glimepiride, compared to placebo (-0.76 %, placebo-adjusted). Similar results were 
observed for both the FAS and the PP populations. 
The outcomes of the secondary endpoints both support the primary endpoint. Responder rates (at least 
one criterion met) were significantly higher for the vildagliptin group (28.3 % vs 5.6 % for vildagliptin 
and placebo respectively). A relevant responder rate would remain if the entire randomized set was 
taken into account (43/158 = 27.2 %). A significant difference with regards to lowering of FPG was 
also observed.  
Subgroups analysis showed a greater effect for patients with higher HbA1c at baseline, which is in line 
with previous findings. No change in effect by age, BMI, gender or race was observed.  
Long-term data on the efficacy of vildagliptin 50 mg bid add-on therapy in patients with T2DM 
inadequately controlled by dual combination of metformin (≥1500 mg) and glimepiride (≥4 mg) 
beyond the 24 week treatment period in study CLAF237A23152 are not available. However, the long 
term efficacy of vildagliptin has been established in earlier clinical studies in other indications. 
Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of vildagliptin 50 mg BID in combination with metformin and SU has been adequately 
shown. 
2.4.  Clinical Safety aspects  
2.4.1.  Patient exposure 
The mean duration of overall exposure to study medication was similar in both treatment groups (23.1 
weeks for vildagliptin and 24.0 weeks for the placebo group). Also rescue medication free exposure 
was comparable between both treatment groups (Table 9). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/568007/2012  
Page 21/46 
 
 
 
 
Table 9 Duration of exposure to study drug during the randomized double-blind period by treatment 
(Randomized Set) 
A patient is counted in only one duration range, per treatment. 
Duration of exposure (weeks) disregarding any treatment interruptions: (last known date of drug intake – 
treatment start date + 1)/7, or if date of last study drug intake was not known: (last visit date – treatment start 
date)/7. 
Duration of rescue medication free exposure (weeks) disregarding any treatment interruptions: (last study drug 
date without rescue medication – Visit 2 date+ 1)/7, or if the subject never took rescue medication rescue-free 
duration is set to the corresponding overall duration of exposure. 
Rescue medication use 
Rescue medication was used by fewer patients in the vildagliptin group (n= 6/158, 3.8%) compared to 
the placebo group (n= 22/160, 13.8%). The mean exposure to rescue medication for patients who 
used rescue medication was 8.9 weeks in the vildagliptin group and 10.4 weeks in the placebo group. 
Most frequently used was insulin, with distinctly more patients in the placebo group taking insulin 
rescue medication (n=13) compared to one patient in the vildagliptin group. Pioglitazone alone was 
used by 5 patients in the vildagliptin group and by 4 patients in the placebo group. Also 5 patients in 
the placebo group and none in the vildagliptin group took insulin together with pioglitazone as rescue 
medication.

Glimepiride dose reductions during the study 
Glimepiride dose reductions at any point during the study were reported for 3 patients in the 
vildagliptin and 1 patient in the placebo group. 
Duration of exposure was slightly lower in the vildagliptin treated group due to more early 
discontinuations. However, a higher proportion of patients in the vildagliptin group completed the 
study without the need for rescue. Dose reductions of glimepiride were more common in the 
vildagliptin treated group; however, numbers were very low (3 vs 1 patients). 
Adverse events 
The percentage of patients with any AEs was comparable in the vildagliptin and the placebo group 
(50.3% vs. 47.5%). The System Organ Class (SOC) with the highest number of events was the 
Infections and infestations SOC, with slightly lower incidence rates in vildagliptin patients compared to 
placebo (19.1% vs. 21.3%) (Table 10). 
Overall the incidences of AEs in the following SOCs were more frequent (5% or more difference) in the 
vildagliptin group than in the placebo group: Nervous system disorders (15.9% vs. 8.1%), and Skin 
and subcutaneous tissue disorders (11.5% vs. 3.1%). The overall difference in the incidences of AEs 
by the Nervous system disorders SOC was driven by more dizziness and tremor events in vildagliptin 
(7.0% vs. 1.9% in the placebo group and 4.5% vs. 1.3% in the placebo group, respectively). The 
overall difference in the Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders was driven by more hyperhidrosis 
events on vildagliptin (6.4% vs. 0.6% in the placebo group). The majority of these events was mild 
and might be a reflection of mild hypoglycemia in light of better glycaemic control in the vildagliptin 
group. None of these events led to study discontinuation.

The reporting rates were only slightly higher for the vildagliptin group. Apart from Nervous system 
disorders and Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders discussed above, a slightly higher reporting of GI 
events was observed. This is in line with previous submissions. Of note, no malignancies were 
observed in the vildagliptin treated group. 
Most frequently occurring adverse events 
Overall the most frequent AEs (reported in ≥ 2% of patients in either treatment group) were 
comparable between treatments (Table 11). The event with the highest reporting rate was urinary 
tract infections, with similar incidence rates in both groups (vildagliptin group: 6.4% and placebo 
group:  8.1%). AEs that were more frequently reported in the vildagliptin group than in the placebo 
group were hypoglycemia-like events, i.e. dizziness and hyperhidrosis. Hypoglycemia was slightly more 
frequent in the vildagliptin than in the placebo groups (5.1% vs. 1.9%).  
Five patients (3.2%) in the vildagliptin group reported anemia events. Four of them presented 
decreased hemoglobin levels at baseline and the anemia events were considered mild and not 
suspected to be related to the study drug. One patient, with a history of uterine haemorrhages, 
reported an anemia AE after planned surgery, which was not suspected to be related to the study drug

by the investigator. None of these 5 anemia cases were reported as SAEs or led to study drug 
discontinuation.

The MAH provided a review of all anaemia events across the study program for vildagliptin showing 
that there is no relevant imbalance in the reporting when compared to placebo or active comparators. 
The overall reporting rates were 1.7 % for vildagliptin, 0.7 % for placebo and 1.8 % for comparators. 
Drug-related adverse events 
The overall incidence rate of AEs that were suspected to be drug-related was higher in the vildagliptin 
treatment group (12.7%) compared with the placebo group (4.4%). The difference was mainly driven 
by dizziness (vildagliptin: 3.8% vs. placebo: 0%) and tremor (vildagliptin: 3.2% vs. placebo 0%) 
observed in nervous system disorders SOC. 
More drug-related AEs were reported in the vildagliptin group. These AES are mainly dizziness, tremor, 
but also hypoglycaemia (vildagliptin: 2.5% vs. placebo: 0.6%) and skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders (vildagliptin: 3.8% versus placebo: 0.6%, including hyperhidrosis and 2 events of pruritus 
generalised in the vildagliptin group). 
Severity of adverse events 
Most events were assessed as mild (vildagliptin: 39.5% vs. placebo: 35.0%) or moderate (vildagliptin: 
10.2% vs. placebo: 10.6%). Severe AEs were reported in 1 patient in the vildagliptin group (severe 
hypoglycemia) and in 3 patients in the placebo group (severe acute cholecystitis, severe headache, 
severe asphyxia and suicide).

The incidence of SAEs was very low (3 patients (1.9%) in the vildagliptin and 2 patients (1.3%) in the 
placebo group). All SAEs were singular events and reported in not more than one patient, and no 
particular trends were noted for any type of events. One hypoglycemia SAE was reported in a 
vildagliptin-treated patient as a result of decrease in food intake during postsurgical period, which was 
not suspected be drug-related by the investigator.  
SAEs were few without trends were observed. 
Adverse events of predefined risk  
A comprehensive Risk Management Plan (RMP) is in place for vildagliptin since its original approval. It 
defines the following identified and potential risks: hepatic, muscle, skin and/or vascular, 
neuropsychiatric-related events, acute pancreatitis, breast cancer, serious infections, hypoglycemia 
and angioedema. The RMP for the fixed dose combination of vildagliptin and metformin includes lactic 
acidosis as an additional identified risk due to the metformin component.  
There were no relevant differences in the incidence rates of predefined risk AEs of hepatic, muscle, 
skin and/or vascular, neuropsychiatric-related events, and infections between vildagliptin and placebo 
groups. The incidence rates of these events are summarized inTable 13. In addition, there were no 
acute pancreatitis and lactic acidosis AEs reported in this study and no breast cancer or angioedema

The reporting of AEs of special interest was balanced between treatment groups. 
Hypoglycaemic events 
The proportion of patients who experienced hypoglycaemic events was low in both treatment groups, 
but was slightly higher in the vildagliptin than in the placebo group (n=8, 5.1% vs. n=3, 1.9%), 
(Table 14). Most of these patients had a single episode of hypoglycaemic event; multiple 
hypoglycaemic events (two or more) were only reported for one patient in each treatment group. None 
of these hypoglycaemic events led to study discontinuation and only one of these events was 
considered grade 2 as a result of reduced food intake after planned surgery, which was not suspected 
by the investigator to be drug-related.

Hypoglycaemic event was taken into account when patients have symptoms of hypoglycaemia and a 
plasma glucose < 3.1 mmol/L. 
Hypoglycaemias were more common in the vildagliptin treated group as could have been expected 
considering the lowering in HbA1c observed in this group. However, events were mostly mild. As 
discussed above, the only severe hypoglycaemic episode occurred in the post-surgical period and was 
due to inadequate food intake. In addition, three reductions of doses of glimepiride were needed 
during the study. A statement recommending that a lower dose of SU may be considered to reduce the 
risk of hypoglycaemia and a special warnings and precautions for use is included in the SmPC. The 
higher dose of 50 mg BID in combination with SU used in this study, however, appears safe and 
tolerable. 
Laboratory findings 
Changes from baseline to endpoint were small for all clinical chemistry, hematology and urinalysis 
variables and no major differences between both treatment groups were observed.  
Persistent hepatic enzyme elevations (ALT or AST) were not reported in the vildagliptin group. Two 
patients in the vildagliptin group had CPK elevations >10 x ULN at the last study visit. Both cases were 
from Korea. The patients were clinically asymptomatic and the events were not considered to be AEs 
by the investigators. One case was associated with excessive alcohol use; the other was confounded by 
omeprazole therapy, known to be associated with myopathies including rhabdomyolysis (Clark and 
Strandell, 2006). Both events resolved after treatment discontinuation. Muscle events are being 
continuously monitored by the MAH and in the recent renewal procedure it was decided that in the 
next PSUR, the MAH should perform a cumulative review of all cases of myalgia, and discuss whether 
or not this adverse event should be added to section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
ECGs, vital signs, body weight and physical examinations 
There were no clinically significant changes in ECG findings at study endpoint reported in the 
vildagliptin group. There were no major changes in vital signs over time and mean values at Week 24 
were similar for both treatment groups. Mean body weight slightly increased by 0.6 kg in the 
vildagliptin group from 73.1 kg at baseline to 73.7 kg at study end and remained almost unchanged in 
the placebo group 72.4 kg at baseline vs. 72.3 kg at study end. 
Thus, no relevant weight increase was observed when vildagliptin was used in triple combination.  
Adverse drug reactions 
Safety data from Study CLAF237A23152 were analyzed according to a pre-defined algorithm used to 
define ADRs for previously approved indications. The following set of criteria was used to assess if an 
AE was an ADR: 
•  A difference of AE ≥2% in the vildagliptin group than in placebo group, and 
• 
For suspected drug-related events, a difference of AE >0.2% in the incidence rate and 
difference in incidence of AEs >1 event 
For events meeting the above two criteria and therefore qualifying as ADRs, the Council for 
International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) frequency category was determined based on 
the incidence of suspected drug-related AEs (Table 17).

Based on the criteria for ADR determination, the following events were classified as ADRs: dizziness 
(common), hyperhidrosis (common), hypoglycemia (common), asthenia (common) and tremor 
(common) (Table 16 and Table 17).

Dizziness, tremor  
General disorders and administration site condition

Asthenia  
Metabolism and nutritional disorders 
Common 
Hypoglycaemia

There were no withdrawals reported due to adverse reactions in the vildagliptin + metformin + 
glimepiride treatment group vs. 0.6% in the placebo + metformin + glimepiride treatment group. 
The incidence of hypoglycemia was common in both treatment groups (5.1% for the vildagliptin + 
metformin + glimepiride vs. 1.9 % for the placebo + metformin + glimepiride group). One severe 
hypoglycaemic event was reported in the vildagliptin group.  
At the end of the study, effect on mean body weight was neutral (+0.6 kg in the vildagliptin group and 
-0.1 kg in the placebo group). Considering the improvement in HbA1c (which usually would result in 
some weight gain) with vildagliptin, the MAH’s conclusion that the effect on body weight was neutral is 
endorsed. 
This ADR list for the indication will be included in the appropriate section of the product information. 
Safety in special populations 
Patients in the Primary safety population (CLAF237A23152) were evaluated for AEs and hypoglycaemic 
events by age categories <65 and ≥65 years of age. 
Adverse events 
In Study CLAF237A23152, the overall incidence of AEs for patients <65 years was 51.6% in the 
vildagliptin group and 41.0% in the placebo group. For patients ≥65 years, the overall incidence of AEs 
was 44.8% in the vildagliptin group and 68.4% in the placebo group. 
The most frequent AEs for patients <65 years were infections (incidence of AEs was 22.7% in the 
vildagliptin group and 16.4% in the placebo group). This was driven mainly by more upper respiratory 
tract infection events in the vildagliptin group (5.5%) compared with the placebo group (1.6%). 
For patients ≥65 years, the most frequent AEs were also infections, with substantially more patients in 
the placebo group (36.8%) reporting infection AEs compared with the vildagliptin group (3.4%). 
However, the number of patients ≥65 years was relatively low (29 vildagliptin patients and 38 placebo 
patients). 
Notwithstanding the small subgroup size, the analysis by age did not indicate an increased risk of AEs 
in the older population. The analyses with regards to age do not evoke any safety concerns. 
Hypoglycaemia 
In Study CLAF237A23152, 8 patients in the vildagliptin group experienced hypoglycaemic events, of 
which 6 patients, were <65 years of age, and 2 patients were ≥65 years of age. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/568007/2012  
Page 31/46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Three patients in the placebo group experienced hypoglycaemic events, of which 2 patients were <65 
years and 1 patient was ≥65 years. 
Overall, there were no differences between age subgroups with respect to percentages of patients 
reporting hypoglycaemic events in either treatment group. 
The subgroup analyses with regards to age do not evoke any safety concerns. No conclusion could be 
drawn from the analysis of hypoglycaemic events in elderly patients, given the low number of elderly 
patients including in the study. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
In Study CLAF237A23152, AEs resulting in discontinuation were reported by 1 patient in the 
vildagliptin group (pruritus) and by 2 patients in the placebo group (one patient with tinnitus, tremor 
and dizziness, and one patient who committed suicide by asphyxia) (Table 18). 
One patient in the vildagliptin group presented with generalized pruritus of moderate severity from Day 
1 to Day 27, leading to study discontinuation. The event (pruritus generalized) resolved after study 
drug discontinuation. The investigator suspected a relationship between the event and the study 
medication. 
Overall, the incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation was very low in both treatment groups. 
However, given the low number of elderly patients including in the study, no conclusions can be drawn.

Vildagliptin is approved in more than 95 countries worldwide. On the basis of sales data, the 
cumulative patient exposure for vildagliptin and the fixed dose combination of vildagliptin/metformin 
(Eucreas) since the first launch of the product through Dec-2011 is estimated to be approximately 
993,969 patient treatment years (PTY) and 1,651,940 PTY, respectively. The combined (vildagliptin 
and vildagliptin/metformin) total exposure as of Dec-2011 is estimated to be 2,645,910 PTY. 
Vildagliptin is not marketed for the triple combination therapy with metformin and glimepiride in any 
country.  
The safety profile of vildagliptin is well established in its present indications and combinations with 
regular safety updates being provided to Heath Authorities. The safety data from study 
Assessment report

Page 32/46 
 
 
 
 
 
CLAF237A23152 in the present application are consistent with the safety data obtained through 
marketed use of vildagliptin in the approved indications. 
2.4.2.  Discussion 
In support of the current application for the new indication “Vildagliptin is indicated in the treatment of 
type 2 diabetes mellitus in triple combination with a SU and metformin when diet and exercise plus 
dual therapy with these agents do not provide adequate glycaemic control.” safety data from the 
24-week clinical study CLAF237A23152 has been provided. 
The duration of exposure was slightly lower in the vildagliptin treated group due to more early 
discontinuations. However, a higher proportion of patients in the vildagliptin group completed the 
study without the need for rescue medication. Dose reductions of glimepiride were more common in 
the vildagliptin treated group; however, numbers were very low (3 vs 1 patient). 
The AE reporting rates were only slightly higher for the vildagliptin group than for placebo (50.3 % vs 
47.5 %). The imbalance was driven by a higher reporting within the SOCs “Nervous system disorders” 
(vildagliptin: 15.9% vs. placebo: 8.1%) and “Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders” (vildagliptin: 
11.5% vs. placebo: 3.1%). This could be explained by a higher reporting of hypoglycaemia and 
possibly hypoglycaemia events such as dizziness, hyperhidrosis and tremor within these groups. 
Further to this, a slightly higher reporting of GI events was observed. This is in line with previous 
submissions. Of note, no malignancies were observed in the vildagliptin treated group. 
A higher reporting of anaemia events (5 vs 0 events) was observed in the vildagliptin treated group. 
These events have been classified as “not suspected to be related to the study drug”. A review of 
anaemia events across the vildagliptin study program have been provided, showing no over-reporting 
of such events in the large safety data base. 
SAEs were reported in few patients in the vildagliptin (n=3) and the placebo group (n=2). 2 events of 
pruritus generalised have been observed in the vildagliptin group, pruritus being a well-known side 
effect of vildagliptin. 
The reporting of AEs of special interest related to the identified and potential risks in the RMP was low 
and balanced between treatment groups. 
Hypoglycaemias were more common in the vildagliptin treated group (11 vs 4 events) as could have 
been expected considering the lowering in HbA1c observed in this group. However, events were mostly 
mild. The only severe hypoglycaemic episode occurred in the post-surgical period and was due to 
inadequate food intake. More reductions of doses of glimepiride were need in the vildagliptin group 
versus placebo group (3 versus 1). A statement recommending that a lower dose of SU may be 
considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia has been amended to the SmPC. The dose of 
vildagliptin 50 mg BID in combination with SU used in this study, however, appears safe and tolerable. 
There were no significant findings with regards to laboratory findings and vital signs apart from two 
cases with CPK elevations. Muscle events are being continuously monitored by the MAH and in the 
recent renewal procedure it was decided that in the next PSUR, the MAH should perform a cumulative 
review of all cases of myalgia, and discuss whether or not this adverse event should be added to 
section 4.8 of the SmPC. The two new cases observed do not call for any changes to this commitment. 
Adverse events that met both the criteria for adverse drug reactions set out by the MAH were selected 
for presentation in the SmPC. This is acceptable and the SmPC is amended with this information. No 
withdrawals due to listed adverse events were reported in the vildagliptin treated group. One patient in 
each treatment groups discontinued due to AEs. The event (generalized pruritus) that led to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/568007/2012  
Page 33/46 
 
 
 
 
discontinuation of the vildagliptin treated patient was suspected to be treatment related. One 
additional patient in the placebo group discontinued due to death. 
Taking the improvement in HbA1c into consideration (which usually would result in some weight gain) t 
can be concluded that the effect of vildagliptin on body weight is neutral, when used in triple 
combination with metformin and SU.  
The subgroup analyses with regards to age do not evoke any safety concerns.  
Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety data provided with this application indicates that the use of vildagliptin in triple combination 
with metformin and SU is well tolerated. No new safety concerns are evoked and the safety profile for 
vildagliptin appears unchanged.

2.6.  Changes to the Product Information 
The MAH proposed the following changes to the Product Information (PI), to which the CHMP agreed:  
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Vildagliptin is indicated in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults: 
As monotherapy 
- 
in patients inadequately controlled by diet and exercise alone and for whom metformin is 
inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance. 
As dual oral therapy in combination with 
- 
metformin, in patients with insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated dose of 
monotherapy with metformin, 
a sulphonylurea, in patients with insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated dose of 
a sulphonylurea and for whom metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance, 
a thiazolidinedione, in patients with insufficient glycaemic control and for whom the use of a 
thiazolidinedione is appropriate. 
- 
- 
As triple oral therapy in combination with 
- 
a sulphonylurea and metformin when diet and exercise plus dual therapy with these medicinal 
products do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
4.2 
Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Adults 
When used as monotherapy, or in dual combination with metformin or a thiazolidinedione, or 
in combination with metformin and a sulphonylurea, the recommended daily dose of vildagliptin is 
100 mg, administered as one dose of 50 mg in the morning and one dose of 50 mg in the evening. 
When used in dual combination with a sulphonylurea, the recommended dose of vildagliptin is 50 mg 
once daily administered in the morning. In this patient population, vildagliptin 100 mg daily was no 
more effective than vildagliptin 50 mg once daily. 
When used in combination with a sulphonylurea, a lower dose of the sulphonylurea may be considered 
to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. 
Doses higher than 100 mg are not recommended. 
If a dose of Galvus is missed, it should be taken as soon as the patient remembers. A double dose 
should not be taken on the same day. 
The safety and efficacy of vildagliptin as triple oral therapy in combination with metformin and a 
thiazolidinedione or with metformin and a sulphonylurea hasve not been established. 
[…] 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
[…] 
Hypoglycaemia 
Sulphonylureas are known to cause hypoglycaemia. Patients receiving vildagliptin in combination with 
a sulphonylurea may be at risk for hypoglycaemia. Therefore, a lower dose of sulphonylurea may be 
considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia.

There were no withdrawals due to adverse reactions reported in the vildagliptin + metformin + 
glimepiride treatment group versus 0.6% in the placebo + metformin + glimepiride treatment group. 
The incidence of hypoglycaemia was common in both treatment groups (5.1% for the vildagliptin + 
metformin + glimepiride group versus 1.9% for the placebo + metformin + glimepiride group). One 
severe hypoglycaemic event was reported in the vildagliptin group. 
At the end of the study, effect on mean body weight was neutral (+0.6 kg in the vildagliptin group 
and -0.1 kg in the placebo group).

5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
[…] 
A 24-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 318 patients to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) in combination with metformin 
(≥1500 mg daily) and glimepiride (≥4 mg daily). Vildagliptin in combination with metformin and 
glimepiride significantly decreased HbA1c compared with placebo. The placebo-adjusted mean 
reduction from a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.8% was -0.76%.

3.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
Vildagliptin was approved in the EU in September 2007. Vildagliptin is currently approved as 
monotherapy (when metformin is inappropriate) and in combination with metformin, SU and 
thiazolidinedione. The fixed dose combination with metformin was approved in November 2007. 
The current type II variation is an application for a new indication: “Vildagliptin is indicated in triple 
combination with a SU and metformin when diet and exercise plus dual therapy with these agents do 
not provide adequate glycaemic control.” for Galvus/Jalra/Xiliarx (vildagliptin) and to include the triple 
combination with metformin in the indication for Eucreas/Icandra/Zomarist (vildagliptin and 
metformin). 
Benefits  
Beneficial effects 
With the currently submitted study the MAH has adequately shown that the addition of vildagliptin to 
dual therapy with metformin and SU results in further HbA1c lowering. The observed placebo-adjusted 
reduction of 0.76 % is considered clinically relevant and was further supported by the secondary 
endpoints with significantly higher responder rates for vildagliptin (28 % vs 6 %, vildagliptin and 
placebo respectively) as well as a significant effect on FPG. These results were obtained with 
vildagliptin dose already approved for the combination of vildagliptin with metformin (50 mg bid). It 
should be noted that the approved posology for vildagliptin in combination with SU is 50 mg once daily 
as the additional effect of vildagliptin 100 mg daily was not considered to outweigh the observed 
increase in hypoglycaemia at the time of approval of this combination. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Long-term data on the efficacy of vildagliptin 50 mg bid add-on therapy in patients with T2DM, 
inadequately controlled by a combination of metformin and SU, beyond 24 weeks are not available. 
However, studies with longer duration were included in the MAA for vildagliptin, which is considered 
sufficient.

Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
With this application 24-week safety data in 318 patients (158 in the vildagliptin treated group) has 
been provided.  The AE reporting rates were only slightly higher for the vildagliptin treated group than 
for placebo (50.3 % vs 47.5 %). The imbalance was driven by a higher reporting of hypoglycaemia and 
possibly hypoglycaemia related events such as dizziness, hyperhidrosis and tremor. Further to this, a 
slightly higher reporting of GI events was observed. This is in line with previous submissions. Of note, 
no malignancies were observed in the vildagliptin treated group. SAEs were few with 3 patients in the 
vildagliptin treated group and 2 patients in the placebo group reporting events. Due to the low 
numbers, no trends could be observed. 
With regards to the identified and potential risks: hepatic, muscle, skin and/or vascular, 
neuropsychiatric-related events, acute pancreatitis and infections, the reporting was low and balanced 
between treatment groups. No cases of acute pancreatitis were observed. 
Hypoglycaemias were more common in the vildagliptin treated group (11 vs 4 events) as could have 
been expected considering the lowering in HbA1c observed in this group. However, events were few 
and mostly mild. Only one severe hypoglycaemic episode occurred in the vildagliptin treated group vs 
none in the placebo group. More reductions of doses of glimepiride were observed in the vildagliptin 
group versus placebo group (3 versus 1).  
During the MAA, it has been shown in a previous study 2305 that vildagliptin 100 mg is no more 
effective than vildagliptin 50 mg once daily in combination with a SU. In this study, the incidence of 
hypoglycaemia was low in combination with SU, but there was more hypoglycaemia events observed 
with vildagliptin 100 mg/day (6 patients = 3.6% of patients) than with placebo (2 patients = 0.6% of 
patients).  
The increase in hypoglycaemia risk was in the same range in study 23152 (5.1% of patients versus 
1.9%) with 50 mg bid as was observed for the 100 mg daily dose in the dual therapy study, but a 
lower dose was not investigated in study 23152. However, in this setting, the dose of vildagliptin 
50 mg bid in combination with SU appears safe and tolerable with regards to hypoglycaemias. Thus, 
based on the new data available with study 23152 the higher dose of vildagliptin for the triple 
combination is acceptable provided that the proposed recommendations for lowering the SU dose in 
case of hypoglycaemia are included in the SmPC, sections 4.2 and 4.4, as a safety measure. 
There were no significant findings with regards to laboratory findings and vital signs apart from two 
cases with CPK elevations (further discussed below). 
Adverse events that met both the criteria for adverse drug reactions set out by the MAH were selected 
for presentation in the SmPC. This is acceptable and the SmPC have been amended with this 
information.  
Taking the improvement in HbA1c (which usually would result in some weight gain) with vildagliptin 
into account, it can be concluded that the effect of vildagliptin on body weight was neutral when used 
in triple combination with metformin and SU.  
Neither the safety data from the overall population nor the subgroup analyses with regards to age 
evoke any new safety concerns.  
Assessment report

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The patients of the study are rather young and with few co-morbidities and co-medications.  The risks 
of the triple combination, notably regarding hypoglycaemic events, are unknown in a more vulnerable 
population.  
Two cases with CPK elevations were observed in the study. None of these CPK elevations were 
considered an AE or study drug suspected by the investigators. Muscle events are being continuously 
monitored by the MAH and in the recent renewal procedure it was decided that in the next PSUR, the 
MAH should perform a cumulative review of all cases of myalgia, and discuss whether or not this 
adverse event should be added to section 4.8 of the SmPC. The two new cases observed do not call for 
any changes to this commitment. 
Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The data provided has adequately shown that adding vildagliptin to the combinations therapy with 
metformin and SU results in a clinically relevant lowering of HbA1c.  
This effect was achieved without an unacceptable increase in hypoglycaemic events or weight gain. 
The safety profile remained unchanged and no new safety issues emerged with this new combination. 
The risk of hypoglycaemia could be managed in clinical practice but the prescribers should be informed 
on this risk.  Section 4.2 in the SmPC has been amended to include information to consider a reduction 
of the dose of SU to avoid hypoglycaemic event, in line with the texts of other DPP-4 inhibitors and a 
warning regarding hypoglycaemia in section 4.4 has also been amended.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
The combination of metformin plus a SU is a broadly used dual therapy for the treatment of T2DM. 
However, many patients on dual-combination therapy with metformin and a SU agent do not achieve 
or maintain glycaemic control. The data presented show that adding a third drug with a different

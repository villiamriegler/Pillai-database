1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

and older weighing at least 40 kg and receiving 
supplemental oxygen, who have a negative SARS-
CoV-2 antibody test result for Ronapreve; as a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 4.9, 5.1 
,5.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC are updated.  
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary 
of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

SmPC new text 
to add a new warning for convulsive syncope to the 
list of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) with frequency 
not known, following a signal assessment conducted 
by MAH. 
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
In the current variation the convulsive syncope is added to 
sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. This has been observed 
following intravenous and subcutaneous administration. 
Convulsive syncope is a sign or symptom of infusion-
related reactions, hypersensitivity reaction or considered to 
be part of a vasovagal reflex reaction associated with 
orthostatic hypotension... Convulsive syncope should be 
differentiated from seizures and managed as clinically 
indicated. 
For more information, please refer to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics.

Introduction 
Cymbalta (duloxetine) hard capsules are currently authorised in the European Union for the following 
indication: 
“Treatment of major depressive episodes” 
The variation relates to an update of section 4.1 of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) to 
add the indication "Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain (DPNP) in adults. In addition, consequential 
changes were made to sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SPC. The relevant sections of the Package 
Leaflet (PL) were updated accordingly. 
Duloxetine  is  classified  as  a  serotonin  norepinephrine  reuptake  inhibitor  (SNRI).  It  is  a  selective 
inhibitor of both serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) receptors. Both 5-HT and NE have been 
implicated in the mediation of endogenous pain inhibitory mechanisms via the descending inhibitory 
pain pathways in the brain and spinal cord.  
Diabetes is the leading cause of neuropathy in the Western world, and neuropathy is the most common 
complication  and  greatest  source  of  morbidity  and  mortality  in  diabetes  patients.  The  primary  risk 
factor  for  diabetic  neuropathy  is  hyperglycaemia.  The  duration  of  diabetes  also  increases  the  risk  of 
neuropathy, but the association between duration and prevalence may depend in part upon patient age, 
which  itself  is  a  risk  factor.  Cigarette  smoking,  alcohol  consumption,  hypertension,  height,  and 
hypercholesterolemia are all considered independent risk factors for diabetic neuropathy. Neuropathic 
pain can be defined as pain initiated or caused by primary lesion or dysfunction in the nervous system. 
They result from the damage to the nervous system leading to peripheral or central neuropathic pain. 
Patients affected by DPNP may benefit from duloxetine therapy.

Quality aspects 
Not applicable. 
3. 
Pre-clinical aspects 
The maximum recommended clinical dose for DPNP is identical to that for major depressive disorder. 
The  sections  4.6,  5.2  and  5.3  of  the  SPC  that  include  nonclinical  data  remain  unchanged  and  as 
approved.  
The  effect  of  duloxetine  in  the  treatment  of  DPNP  is  linked  to  its  capacity  to  dose-dependently 
increase  extracellular  levels  of  serotonin  and  noradrenaline  in  various  brain  areas  of  animals. 
Duloxetine normalised pain thresholds in several preclinical models of neuropathic and inflammatory 
pain,  and  attenuated  pain  behaviour  in  a  model  of  persistent  pain.  The  pain  inhibitory  action  of 
duloxetine is believed to be a result of potentiation of descending inhibitory pain pathways within the 
central nervous system. 
The following paragraph was proposed to be included in section 5.1 of the SPC in order to describe 
the activity of duloxetine in preclinical models of pain: 
“Duloxetine  normalised  pain  thresholds  in  several  preclinical  models  of  neuropathic  and 
inflammatory  pain  and  attenuated  pain  behaviour  in  a  model  of  persistent  pain.  The  pain 
inhibitory  action  of  duloxetine  is  believed  to  be  a  result  of  potentiation  of  descending 
inhibitory pain pathways within the central nervous system.” 
The CHMP considered the wording acceptable.

Clinical efficacy and safety 
4.2.1 
Introduction 
The  efficacy  of  duloxetine  in  patients  with  diabetic  neuropathic  pain  (DPNP)  was  evaluated  in  two 
randomised,  placebo-controlled  acute  studies  (Study  HMAW-Acute  and  Study  HMAV-Acute). 
Further safety data were provided in Study F1J-MC-HMBT (28-week, open-label, safety study) with 
the  primary  objective  of  gathering  safety  data  in  the  treatment  of  painful  symptoms  associated  with 
diabetic  neuropathy,  as  well  as  Study  F1J-MC-HMAW  –  Extension  (52-week  extension  phase  of 
Study HMAW) giving further safety data on duloxetine in comparison with routine care.  
4.2.2 
Clinical efficacy 
A  total  of  475  and  334  patients  in  Study  HMAW-Acute  and  HMAV-Acute,  respectively,  were 
randomly assigned to receive different dosage regimens of duloxetine or placebo.  
The objectives of both studies were similar; to compare the efficacy of duloxetine in different doses 
with placebo on the reduction of pain severity in the acute treatment of patients who met criteria for 
painful  diabetic  neuropathy  but  did  not  meet  DSM-IV  criteria  for  major  depression.  Male  or  female 
outpatients at least 18 years of age with pain due to bilateral peripheral neuropathy caused by Type 1 
or Type 2 diabetes mellitus were included in these studies. The pain must have begun in the feet, with 
relatively symmetrical onset. Daily pain should have been present for at least 6 months. The diagnosis 
must have been confirmed by a score of at least 3 on the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument.  
Study HMAW Acute  
Study  HMAW-Acute  was  a  double-blind,  randomised,  placebo-controlled,  study  comparing 
duloxetine 20 mg QD, 60 mg QD, and 60 mg BID with placebo over 12 weeks of acute treatment in 
patients  aged  ≥18  years  with  DPNP.  The  study  consisted  of  two  periods;  a  1-  to  2-week  screening 
phase during which patients were screened for eligibility and a 12-week period of double blind acute 
treatment.  
The  protocol-specified  primary  efficacy  evaluation  in  this  study  was  a  comparison  between  the 
duloxetine  60  mg  BID  and  placebo  treatment  groups  after  12  weeks  of  treatment,  using  repeated 
measures analysis of the  change from baseline in the primary efficacy analysis, the  24-hour average 
pain  scale.  Results  from  the  repeated  measures  analysis  were  consistent  with  those  from  the  mean 
change analysis. 
Results from the primary efficacy measure show that doses of duloxetine 60 mg QD and 60 mg BID 
were statistically significantly better than placebo in the reduction of the severity of pain, which was 
seen  from  the  first  week  after  starting  treatment  to  the  end  of  the  acute  phase.  No  differences  were 
seen  between  60  mg  BID  and  60  mg  QD  or  between  20  mg  QD  and  placebo.  The  responders  rate 
using  a  more  strict  criteria  (50%  reduction  in  pain  severity)  were  52%,  49%,  41%  and  26%  for 
duloxetine  60  mg  BID,  60  mg  QD,  20  mg  QD  and  placebo,  respectively,  which  were  statistically 
significantly superior for the three dosage regimen of duloxetine compared with placebo.  
Overall, results from secondary measures [Response Rates, The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) – Severity 
and  Interference,  The  Clinical  Global  Impressions  of  Severity  (CGI-Severity),The  Patient’s  Global 
Impressions of Improvement (PGI Improvement), The Sensory Portion of the Short-Form McGill Pain 
Questionnaire  (SF-MPQ),  Dynamic  allodynia,  The  Beck  Depression  Inventory-II  (BDI-II),  the  Beck 
Anxiety  Inventory    (BAI),  and  the  HAMD17;  Health  Outcome  Measures:  The  36-item  Short-Form 
Health  Survey  (SF-36),  the  Euro-Qol  Questionnaire  –  5  Day  (EQ-5D)]  were  consistent  with  those 
from the primary endpoints,  except for dynamic allodynia,  most items of BPI-interference scale and 
BAI, BDI scores. Quality of life measures showed a statistically significant improvement in the body 
pain and mental health domain, with only numerical differences in the remaining aspects such as the 
functioning.

Study HMAV Acute 
Study HMAV-Acute was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study comparing duloxetine 
60 mg QD and 60 mg BID with placebo over 12 weeks of acute treatment in patients aged ≥18 years 
with DPNP.  
The  primary efficacy  evaluation  in  this  study  was  a  comparison  between  the  duloxetine  60  mg  BID 
and placebo treatment groups after 12 weeks of treatment, using mean change analysis of the change 
from baseline in the primary efficacy analysis, the 24-hour average pain scale. 
Consistently  with  the  results  of  Study  HMAW-Acute,  duloxetine  60  mg  QD  and  duloxetine  60  mg 
BID were both statistically significantly better than placebo at reducing the 24-hour average pain score 
in  the  mean  change  analysis  in  Study  HMAV-Acute.  Again,  an  analysis  of  the  score  using  repeated 
measures  showed  duloxetine  60  mg  QD  and  duloxetine  60  mg  BID  were  statistically  significantly 
better than placebo at reducing the score from one week after starting therapy to the end of the acute 
therapy  phase.  The  rate  of  responders  using  the  strict  definition  were  53%,  43%  and  27%  for 
duloxetine 60 mg BID, 60 mg QD and placebo groups, respectively.  
Conclusions on efficacy 
In  the  two  pivotal  studies,  the  difference  for  duloxetine  60  mg  QD  and  60  mg  BID  compared  with 
placebo  in  pain  reduction  varied  between  1.17  –  1.45,  on  a  0-10  Lickert  scale.  This  difference  is 
statistically  significant  (p<0.001).  The  statistical  significance  demonstrated  for  the  primary  endpoint 
was based on an ITT analysis for change from baseline to endpoint using LOCF.  
The proposed dosage regimen is 60 mg once daily, which could be titrated up to 120 mg per day if an 
adequate pain relief, is not achieved. The dosage recommendation was supported by Study HMAVa in 
which the efficacy of duloxetine 60 mg once daily and 60 mg twice daily were consistently superior to 
placebo. The proposal to up-titrate to a maximum of 120 mg/day in those patients with an insufficient 
response was not clearly supported by these results, since 60 mg BID was not statistically significantly 
superior to 60 mg QD in any study. However, it is recognised that studies were not powered to show 
statistically significant differences between dosages. Duloxetine 120 mg/day was numerically superior 
to the lower dose for the primary endpoint and also for most of the secondary endpoints, including the 
responders’ rate (for which a difference of up to 10% between dosages was seen). Therefore, it must 
be recognised that some patients might benefit from the highest dose.  
The rate of response was also statistically significantly superior for duloxetine 60 mg BID and 60 mg 
QD  compared  with  placebo  (around  50%  vs.  26%  for  duloxetine  60  mg  BID/QD  and  placebo, 
respectively,  using  the  strict  criteria),  which  was  also  clinically  relevant.  About  30%  of  the  patients 
reported no benefit of the active drug.  
Hitherto  there  seems  no  way  to  identify  responders  or  non-responders  but  to  use  the  product  ex 
juvantibus. If a response has not been achieved within 60 days, this seems to indicate a persistent non-
response. The SPC states that the response should be evaluated after 2 months of treatment and that 
additional response after this time is unlikely.  
Overall,  results  from  secondary  measures  were  consistent  with  those  from  the  primary  endpoints, 
except for dynamic allodynia, and some items of BPI-interference scale. Consistency between studies 
and between the repeated measure analysis and the mean change analysis were also demonstrated.  
4.2.3 
Clinical safety 
The  total  duloxetine  clinical  trial  safety  database  consisted  of  over  11000  patients  in  all  indications. 
The  primary  DPNP  data  safety  database  comprised  a  total  of  1074  patients  who  were  exposed  to 
duloxetine  for  the  equivalent  to  471.7  patient  years.  Among  these  patients,  484  had  ≥6  months  of 
exposure to duloxetine, and 158 had ≥12 months of exposure to duloxetine.  
Nausea was the  most frequently reported adverse event, occurring at the beginning of treatment and 
decreasing  over  time.  The  most  common  AEs  were  nausea  (23.6%),  somnolence  (15.5%),  dizziness 
(13.4%), insomnia (10.2 %), constipation (11.3 %). Diarrhoea, fatigue, dry mouth, and hyperhydrosis 
occurred in 5-10% of the duloxetine patients.  
Cymbalta-H-572-II-03 
4/12 
EMEA 2006 
The safety profile of duloxetine in the claimed indication was similar, although numerically superior 
to  that  seen  in  other  indications,  with  the  only  exception  of  somnolence  for  which  a  statistically 
significant  difference  were  noted  (reported  in  up  to  23.9%  in  DPNP  vs.  13.4%  in  other  duloxetine-
treated  patients  indications).  This  could  be  explained  because  the  population  enrolled  in  clinical 
development for DPNP was older, with higher concomitant medications and concurrent illnesses. 
Nausea  and  diarrhoea  tended  to  appear  early  in  duloxetine  treatment  and  subside  quickly,  whilst 
somnolence, dizziness, constipation and dry mouth decreased slightly over time and insomnia, fatigue 
and hyperhidrosis seemed to persist during treatment with duloxetine. 
Most  adverse  events  were  reported  as  mild  or  moderate.  Severe  adverse  events  tended  to  be  more 
commonly  reported  in  females  and  in  patients  older  than  75  years  old.  However,  these  were  not 
considered  of  clinical  relevance,  and  the  data  provided  demonstrated  that  the  safety  profile  of 
duloxetine in patients older than 75 years old was consistent to that seen in younger patients. 
In the long-term studies, the incidence of TEAEs in duloxetine-treated patients was relatively low and 
confirmed the safety profile obtained in the short-term studies. 
A total of 214 (19.9%) patients discontinued due to adverse events in the primary safety database. This 
was  slightly  higher  than  that  seen  in  previous  indications  (9.5%  vs.  13.9%),  and  maybe  due  to  the 
higher  proportion  of  elderly  patients,  more  prone  to  suffer  adverse  events.  The  most  frequently 
reported  adverse  events  associated  with  discontinuation  for  all  duloxetine  treatment  groups  were 
nausea, dizziness, somnolence, and fatigue. A total of 135 (20.1%) patients discontinued due to AEs in 
the  long-term  DPNP  dataset.  The  most  frequently  reported  adverse  events  associated  with 
discontinuation were consistent to that seen in the placebo-controlled studies. 
When discontinuing duloxetine after  more than 1 week of therapy, it is generally recommended that 
the dose be tapered over no less than 2 weeks before discontinuation in an effort to decrease the risk of 
discontinuation  symptoms.  As  a  general  recommendation,  the  dose  should  be  reduced  by  half  or 
administered on alternate days during this period. The precise regimen followed should however take 
into  account  the  individual  circumstances  of  the  patient,  such  as  duration  of  treatment,  dose  at 
discontinuation.  
As with other medicinal products with similar pharmacological action (antidepressants), isolated cases 
of suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviours have been reported during duloxetine therapy or early after 
treatment  discontinuation.  Adequate  warning  information  on  reported  cases  of  suicidal  ideation  and 
behaviour  with  the  use  of  duloxetine  has  been  included  in  the  SPC.    The  SPC  also  requests  close 
supervision for patients who report any distressing thoughts or feelings at any time. 
Overall  the  safety  profile  was  as  expected  for  a  drug  with  this  pharmacological  profile.  No 
unexpected, serious adverse events were detected in the extensive DPNP programme. 
4.2.4 
Changes to the SPC  
The  MAH  made  proposals  for  changes  in  sections  4.2,  4.4,  4.8  and  5.1  of  the  SPC  in  order  to 
incorporate the DPNP indication. All other sections remain unchanged and as previously approved for 
Cymbalta.  
Section 4.1 
The MAH proposed to add the following wording for the new indication: 
“Treatment of major depressive episodes.  
Treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain in adults.” 
The CHMP considered the wording acceptable. 
Section 4.2 
The MAH proposed to add the following wording:  
“Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain: 
The  starting  and  recommended  maintenance  dose  is  60 mg  daily  with  or  without  food. 
Dosages above 60 mg once daily, up to a maximum dose of 120 mg per day administered in 
evenly  divided  doses,  have  been  evaluated  from  a  safety  perspective  in  clinical  trials.    The 
Cymbalta-H-572-II-03 
5/12 
EMEA 2006 
plasma  concentration  of  duloxetine  displays  large  inter-individual  variability  (see  5.2). 
Hence, some patients that respond insufficiently to 60 mg may benefit from a higher dose. 
The medicinal product response should be evaluated after 2 months’ of treatment. Additional 
response after this time is unlikely (see 5.1). 
The therapeutic benefit should regularly (at least every three months) be reassessed.” 
Additionally, for clarity’s sake, two subheaders were added to ensure that information relevant to each 
separate indication, as well as information that is relevant to both indications, is clearly understood by 
the prescribing physician: “Major Depressive Episodes”, “Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain” . 
The CHMP considered the wordings acceptable. 
Section 4.4 
The existing warning on suicide as per the currently approved Cymbalta SPC remains unchanged. The 
MAH proposed to add the following wording on suicide: 
“Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain 
As  with  other  medicinal  products  with  similar  pharmacological  action  (antidepressants), 
isolated  cases  of  suicidal  ideation  and  suicidal  behaviours  have  been  reported  during 
duloxetine  therapy  or  early  after  treatment  discontinuation.  Physicians  should  encourage 
patients to report any distressing thoughts or feelings at any time. 
For clarity subheaders were added for each indication. 
The CHMP considered the wordings acceptable. 
Section 4.8 
The MAH proposed to subdivide the section by indication.  
Following the initial assessment, it was considered that the section was too extensive and difficult to 
read and that data should be presented as of the ADRs that occurred with a frequency of ≥1% in both 
MDE and DPNP clinical trials and were reported significantly more often in patients taking duloxetine 
than  placebo,  or  where  the  event  was  considered  clinically  relevant,  as  well  as  rewording  common 
paragraphs  to  be  applicable  to  both  entities  and  only  appear  once  in  the  section.  Consequently,  the 
MAH reorganised the section as follows: 
“Tables  1  and  2  give  the  frequency  of  adverse  reactions  from  placebo-controlled  clinical 
trials  in  depression  and  diabetic  neuropathic  pain.  The  adverse  reactions  reported  in  these 
tables  are those  events that occurred  in 1%  or  more  of  patients  treated  with  duloxetine and 
were  reported  significantly  more  often  in  patients  taking  duloxetine  than  placebo,  or  where 
the event was considered clinically relevant.  
The  most  commonly  reported  adverse  reactions  in  patients  with  depression  treated  with 
CYMBALTA  were  nausea,  dry  mouth  and  constipation.  However,  the  majority  of  common 
adverse  reactions  were  mild  to  moderate,  they  usually  started  early  in  therapy,  and  most 
tended  to  subside  even  as  therapy  was  continued.  The  most  commonly  observed  adverse 
reactions in patients with diabetic neuropathic pain treated with CYMBALTA were: nausea; 
somnolence; dizziness; constipation and fatigue.

Values rounded from a frequency of 1.3% (duloxetine) and 0.6% (placebo) 
In clinical trials of duloxetine in patients with diabetic neuropathic pain, small but statistically 
significant  increases  in  fasting  blood  glucose  were  observed  in  duloxetine-treated  patients 
compared to placebo at 12 weeks and routine care at 52 weeks. The increase was similar at 
both  time  points  and  was  not  considered  clinically  relevant.  Relative  to  placebo  or  routine 
care,  mean  HbA1c  values  were  stable,  there  was  no  mean  weight  gain,  mean  lipid 
concentrations  (cholesterol,  LDL,  HDL,  triglycerides)  were  stable,  and  there  were  no 
differences in incidence of serious and non-serious diabetes-related adverse reactions. 
Electrocardiograms  were  obtained  from  1139  duloxetine  treated  patients  and  777  placebo-
treated  patients  in  8-week  clinical  trials  in  major  depressive  disorder,  and  from  528 
duloxetine-treated and 205 placebo-treated patients with diabetic neuropathic pain in clinical 
trials  lasting  up  to  13-weeks.  The  heart  rate-corrected  QT  interval  in  duloxetine-treated 
patients  did  not  differ  from  that  seen  in  placebo-treated  patients.  No  clinically  significant 
differences  were  observed  for  QT,  PR,  QRS,  or  QTcB  measurements  between  duloxetine-
treated and placebo-treated patients.” 
The CHMP considered the wordings acceptable. 
Section 5.1 
The final ATC code (Other antidepressants N06AX21) was added. 
For  clarity  subheaders  were  added  for  each  indication.  The  MAH  proposed  to  add  three  paragraphs 
describing the results of clinical trials in DPNP.  
“Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain: The efficacy of duloxetine as a treatment for diabetic 
neuropathic  pain  was  established  in  2  randomised,  12-week,  double-blind,  placebo-
controlled, fixed dose studies in adults (22 to 88 years) having diabetic neuropathic pain for 
at  least  6  months.  Patients  meeting  diagnostic  criteria  for  major  depressive  disorder  were 
excluded  from  these  trials.  The  primary  outcome  measure  was  the  weekly  mean  of  24-hour 
average pain, which was collected in a daily diary by patients on an 11-point Likert scale. 
In both studies, duloxetine 60 mg once daily and 60 mg twice daily significantly reduced pain 
compared  with  placebo.  The  effect  in  some  patients  was  apparent  in  the  first  week  of 
treatment.  The  difference  in  mean  improvement  between  the  two  active  treatment  arms  was 
not significant. At least 30% reported pain reduction was recorded in approximately 65% of 
duloxetine  treated  patients  versus  40%  for  placebo.  The  corresponding  figures  for  at  least 
Cymbalta-H-572-II-03 
7/12 
EMEA 2006 
 
50% pain reduction were 50% and 26% respectively. Clinical response rates (50% or greater 
improvement  in  pain)  were  analysed  according  to  whether  or  not  the  patient  experienced 
somnolence  during  treatment.  For  patients  not  experiencing  somnolence,  clinical  response 
was observed in 47% of patients receiving duloxetine and 27% patients on placebo.  Clinical 
response  rates  in  patients  experiencing  somnolence  were  60%  on  duloxetine  and  30%  on 
placebo. Patients not demonstrating a pain reduction of 30% within 60 days of treatment were 
unlikely to reach this level during further treatment. 
Although data from a one-year open label study offer some evidence for longer-term efficacy, 
no conclusive efficacy data for treatments longer than 12 weeks duration are available from 
placebo-controlled studies.” 
In  addition,  the  MAH  proposed  to  include  the  following  paragraph  describing  the  activity  of 
duloxetine in preclinical models of pain: 
“Duloxetine  normalised  pain  thresholds  in  several  preclinical  models  of  neuropathic  and 
inflammatory  pain  and  attenuated  pain  behaviour  in  a  model  of  persistent  pain.  The  pain 
inhibitory  action  of  duloxetine  is  believed  to  be  a  result  of  potentiation  of  descending 
inhibitory pain pathways within the central nervous system.” 
The CHMP considered the wordings acceptable. 
4.2.5 
Changes to the PL 
Section 1  
The MAH proposed to include the DPNP indication and description of the disease state and time to 
onset of action: 
“You  have  been  given  CYMBALTA  to  treat  your  depression  or  to  treat  a  condition  called 
diabetic neuropathic pain. 
Neuropathic pain is a medical condition in which the pain is commonly described as burning, 
stabbing, stinging, shooting or aching or like an electric shock. There may be loss of feeling in 
the affected area, or sensations such as touch, heat, cold or pressure may cause pain.”  
“Cymbalta  starts  to  work  in  most  people  with  depression  within  two  weeks  of  starting 
treatment.  Your  doctor  may  continue  to  give  you  Cymbalta  when  you  are  feeling  better  to 
prevent  your  depression  from  returning.  The  effect  of  Cymbalta  may  be  noticeable  in  many 
patients with diabetic neuropathic pain within 1 week of treatment.” 
The CHMP considered the wordings acceptable.

The MAH proposed to include the following additional side effects for the DPNP population: 
≥10%)  side  effects  with  CYMBALTA  may  include  feeling  sick  (nausea),  dry 
“Very  common  
mouth and constipation, dizziness, tiredness, and trouble sleeping. 
Common (≥1 and <10%) side effects may include diarrhoea, being sick (vomiting), tiredness, 
lethargy, tremor, blurred eyesight, lack appetite or decrease in appetite, weight loss, dizziness, 
difficulty  sleeping,  feeling  sleepy,  increased  sweating  or  night  sweats,  hot  flushes,  sexual 
problems (including problems getting an erection, changes in ejaculation, less sex drive, not 
being able to have an orgasm).  
A few men have experienced some difficulty in starting to pass urine.“

Overall conclusions and benefit/risk assessment  
Efficacy 
The  efficacy  of  duloxetine  in  patients  with  diabetic  neuropathic  pain  (DPNP)  was  evaluated  in  two 
randomised,  placebo-controlled  studies  (Study  HMAW-Acute  and  Study  HMAV-Acute)  in  patients 
with painful diabetic neuropathy, during a 12-week acute therapy phase. 
Male or female outpatients at least 18 years of age with pain due to bilateral peripheral neuropathy for 
at  least  6  months,  caused  by  Type  1  or  Type  2  diabetes  mellitus  were  included  in  these  studies. 
Patients meeting diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder were excluded from these trials. The 
primary  outcome  measure  was  the  weekly  mean  of  24-hour  average  pain,  which  was  collected  in  a 
daily diary by patients on an 11-point Likert scale. 
In  both  studies,  duloxetine  60 mg  once  daily  and  60 mg  twice  daily  significantly  reduced  pain 
compared with placebo. The effect in some patients was apparent in the first week of treatment. The 
difference in mean improvement between the two active treatment arms was not significant.  At least 
30% reported pain reduction was recorded in approximately 65% of duloxetine treated patients versus 
40% for placebo. The corresponding figures for at least 50% pain reduction were about 50% and 26% 
respectively. 
Safety 
The  duloxetine  database  consisted  of  over  11,000  patients  in  all  indications.  The  primary  safety 
database comprises a total of 1074 patients who were exposed to duloxetine over the course of both 
acute  and  long-term  treatment  in  Studies  HMAW,  HMAV-Acute,  and  HMBT,  equivalent  to  471.7 
patient  years  of  exposure.  Duloxetine  is  a  drug  with  highly  variable  pharmacokinetics  and  many 
factors affect the systemic exposure (gender, age, renal and hepatic function, smoking status, CYP2D6 
status, drug-drug interactions) 
Adverse  reactions  occurred  significantly  more  often  in  the  duloxetine  than  in  the  placebo  group, 
nausea  (23.6%),  being  the  most  frequently  reported  adverse  event.  Other  common  adverse  reactions 
were  somnolence  (15.5%),  dizziness  (13.4%),  insomnia  (10.2  %),  constipation  (11.3  %).  Diarrhoea, 
fatigue,  dry  mouth,  and  hyperhydrosis  occurred  in  5-10%  of  the  duloxetine  patients.  Nausea  and 
diarrhoea  tended  to  appear  early  in  duloxetine  treatment  and  subside  quickly,  whilst  somnolence, 
dizziness,  constipation  and  dry  mouth  decreased  slightly  over  time  and  insomnia,  fatigue  and 
hyperhidrosis seemed to persist during treatment with duloxetine. 
A total of 214 (19.9%) patients discontinued due to adverse events in the primary safety database. This 
was  slightly  higher  than  that  seen  in  previous  indications  (9.5%  vs.  13.9%),  and  maybe  due  to  the 
higher  proportion  of  elderly  patients,  more  prone  to  suffer  adverse  events.  The  adverse  event  most 
frequently leading to discontinuation of patients was nausea. 
In  conclusion,  the  safety  profile  of  duloxetine  did  not  identify  any  unexpected  serious  adverse 
reaction, which would cause special concern. 
Benefit/risk assessment 
The MAH has provided evidence of efficacy of duloxetine as a treatment for diabetic neuropathic pain 
through  two  2  randomised,  12-week,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  fixed  dose  studies  in  adult 
diabetic  neuropathic  pain.    In  the  two  studies,  duloxetine  60 mg  once  daily  and  60 mg  twice  daily 
significantly reduced pain compared with placebo.  
Although some concerns  remain, in particular the lack of adequate demonstration of maintenance of 
the effect of duloxetine in diabetic peripheral neuropathy, the tolerability profile of duloxetine seems 
acceptable. Therefore, duloxetine may have a place in the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic 
pain in adults, and the CHMP concluded that there was a positive benefit/risk in DPNP. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  this  variation  to  incorporate  the  indication  “Diabetic  Peripheral 
Neuropathic  Pain  (DPNP)  in  adults”  was  acceptable  and  that  the  following  wordings  should  be 
implemented in the SPC with corresponding changes to the PL: 
Cymbalta-H-572-II-03 
9/12 
EMEA 2006 
 
Section 4.1 of the SPC 
“Treatment of major depressive episodes.  
Treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain in adults.” 
Section 1 of the PL 
“You  have  been  given  CYMBALTA  to  treat  your  depression  or  to  treat  a  condition  called 
diabetic neuropathic pain. 
Neuropathic pain is a medical condition in which the pain is commonly described as burning, 
stabbing, stinging, shooting or aching or like an electric shock.  There may be loss of feeling 
in the affected area, or sensations such as touch, heat, cold or pressure may cause pain.”  
“Cymbalta  starts  to  work  in  most  people  with  depression  within  two  weeks  of  starting 
treatment.  Your  doctor  may  continue  to  give  you  Cymbalta  when  you  are  feeling  better  to 
prevent  your  depression  from  returning.  The  effect  of  Cymbalta  may  be  noticeable  in  many 
patients with diabetic neuropathic pain within 1 week of treatment.” 
Section 4.2 of the SPC 
“Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain: The starting and recommended maintenance dose is 
60 mg daily with or without food. Dosages above 60 mg once daily, up to a maximum dose of 
120 mg  per  day  administered  in  evenly  divided  doses,  have  been  evaluated  from  a  safety 
perspective  in  clinical  trials.    The  plasma  concentration  of  duloxetine  displays  large  inter-
individual variability (see 5.2). Hence, some patients that respond insufficiently to 60 mg may 
benefit from a higher dose. 
The medicinal product response should be evaluated after 2 months’ of treatment. Additional 
response after this time is unlikely (see 5.1). 
The therapeutic benefit should regularly (at least every three months) be reassessed.” 
Section 4.4 of the SPC 
“Diabetic  Peripheral  Neuropathic  Pain:  As  with  other  medicinal  products  with  similar 
pharmacological  action  (antidepressants),  isolated  cases  of  suicidal  ideation  and  suicidal 
behaviours  have  been  reported  during  duloxetine  therapy  or  early  after  treatment 
discontinuation.  Physicians  should  encourage  patients  to  report  any  distressing  thoughts  or 
feelings at any time. 
Section 4.8 of the SPC  
“Tables  1  and  2  give  the  frequency  of  adverse  reactions  from  placebo-controlled  clinical 
trials  in  depression  and  diabetic  neuropathic  pain.  The  adverse  reactions  reported  in  these 
tables  are those  events that occurred  in 1%  or  more  of  patients  treated  with  duloxetine and 
were  reported  significantly  more  often  in  patients  taking  duloxetine  than  placebo,  or  where 
the event was considered clinically relevant.  
The  most  commonly  reported  adverse  reactions  in  patients  with  depression  treated  with 
CYMBALTA  were  nausea,  dry  mouth  and  constipation.  However,  the  majority  of  common 
adverse  reactions  were  mild  to  moderate,  they  usually  started  early  in  therapy,  and  most 
tended  to  subside  even  as  therapy  was  continued.  The  most  commonly  observed  adverse 
reactions in patients with diabetic neuropathic pain treated with CYMBALTA were: nausea; 
somnolence; dizziness; constipation and fatigue.

Adjusted for gender (N Males = Duloxetine 660, Placebo 375) 
Values rounded from a frequency of 1.3% (duloxetine) and 0.6% (placebo) 
In clinical trials of duloxetine in patients with diabetic neuropathic pain, small but statistically 
significant  increases  in  fasting  blood  glucose  were  observed  in  duloxetine-treated  patients 
compared to placebo at 12 weeks and routine care at 52 weeks. The increase was similar at 
both  time  points  and  was  not  considered  clinically  relevant.  Relative  to  placebo  or  routine 
care,  mean  HbA1c  values  were  stable,  there  was  no  mean  weight  gain,  mean  lipid 
concentrations  (cholesterol,  LDL,  HDL,  triglycerides)  were  stable,  and  there  were  no 
differences in incidence of serious and non-serious diabetes-related adverse reactions. 
Electrocardiograms  were  obtained  from  1139  duloxetine  treated  patients  and  777  placebo-
treated  patients  in  8-week  clinical  trials  in  major  depressive  disorder,  and  from  528 
duloxetine-treated and 205 placebo-treated patients with diabetic neuropathic pain in clinical 
trials  lasting  up  to  13-weeks.  The  heart  rate-corrected  QT  interval  in  duloxetine-treated 
patients  did  not  differ  from  that  seen  in  placebo-treated  patients.  No  clinically  significant 
differences  were  observed  for  QT,  PR,  QRS,  or  QTcB  measurements  between  duloxetine-
treated and placebo-treated patients.” 
Section 4 of the PL 
“Very  common (≥10%) side  effects with  CYMBALTA  may include feeling  sick (nausea),  dry 
mouth and constipation, dizziness, tiredness, and trouble sleeping. 
Common (≥1 and <10%) side effects may include diarrhoea, being sick (vomiting), dry mouth, 
tiredness,  lethargy,  tremor,  blurred  eyesight,  lack  appetite  or  decrease  in  appetite,  weight 
loss,  dizziness,  difficulty  sleeping,  feeling  sleepy,  increased  sweating  or  night  sweats,  hot 
flushes, sexual problems (including problems getting an erection, changes in ejaculation, less 
sex drive, not being able to have an orgasm).  
A few men have experienced some difficulty in starting to pass urine.“ 
Section 5.1 of the SPC 
“Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain: The efficacy of duloxetine as a treatment for diabetic 
neuropathic  pain  was  established  in  2  randomised,  12-week,  double-blind,  placebo-
controlled, fixed dose studies in adults (22 to 88 years) having diabetic neuropathic pain for 
at  least  6  months.  Patients  meeting  diagnostic  criteria  for  major  depressive  disorder  were

excluded  from  these  trials.  The  primary  outcome  measure  was  the  weekly  mean  of  24-hour 
average pain, which was collected in a daily diary by patients on an 11-point Likert scale. 
In both studies, duloxetine 60 mg once daily and 60 mg twice daily significantly reduced pain 
compared  with  placebo.  The  effect  in  some  patients  was  apparent  in  the  first  week  of 
treatment.  The  difference  in  mean  improvement  between  the  two  active  treatment  arms  was 
not significant. At least 30% reported pain reduction was recorded in approximately 65% of 
duloxetine  treated  patients  versus  40%  for  placebo.  The  corresponding  figures  for  at  least 
50% pain reduction were 50% and 26% respectively. Clinical response rates (50% or greater 
improvement  in  pain)  were  analysed  according  to  whether  or  not  the  patient  experienced 
somnolence  during  treatment.  For  patients  not  experiencing  somnolence,  clinical  response 
was observed in 47% of patients receiving duloxetine and 27% patients on placebo.  Clinical 
response  rates  in  patients  experiencing  somnolence  were  60%  on  duloxetine  and  30%  on 
placebo. Patients not demonstrating a pain reduction of 30% within 60 days of treatment were 
unlikely to reach this level during further treatment. 
Although data from a one-year open label study offer some evidence for longer-term efficacy, 
no conclusive efficacy data for treatments longer than 12 weeks duration are available from 
placebo-controlled studies.” 
“Duloxetine  normalised  pain  thresholds  in  several  preclinical  models  of  neuropathic  and 
inflammatory  pain  and  attenuated  pain  behaviour  in  a  model  of  persistent  pain.  The  pain 
inhibitory  action  of  duloxetine  is  believed  to  be  a  result  of  potentiation  of  descending 
inhibitory pain pathways within the central nervous system.” 
The MAH has implemented the above-mentioned changes in the SPC and the PL.

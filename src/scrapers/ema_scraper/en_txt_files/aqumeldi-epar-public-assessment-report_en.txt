2.  Scientific discussion
2.1.  Problem statement
Enalapril was the second angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor to become widely available for 
therapeutic use after captopril, the first registered oral ACE inhibitor (ACEI). In children, whilst in 
clinical practice enalapril is used for similar indications as adults, in the European Union it is only 
licensed for use in children with hypertension and a body weight over 20 kg. In particular, in the 
harmonised SmPC for enalapril following Art 30 Referral for Renitec and associated names 
(CPMP/3175; 4 Dec 2003) it was agreed to include a statement in section 4.4 that enalapril is not 
recommended in children in indications other than hypertension. Current dose recommendations in 
children with heart failure (HF) are based on empirical evidence combined with data extrapolated from 
adult studies. A further challenge regarding dosing of ACE-I in paediatrics is the lack of authorised age-
appropriate formulations licensed for use in paediatric HF throughout Europe. 
The importance of pharmacological treatment in children with HF, especially dilated cardiomyopathies 
(DCM), is emphasized by the low availability of donor hearts. Owing to this scarcity, mortality within 
the first year of presentation remains extremely high, highlighting the need for optimal treatment in 
children to prevent or to postpone heart transplantation. 
To address the unmet medical need for a licensed enalapril product for children with heart failure, a 
Framework 7 project (“Labeling of Enalapril from Neonates up to Adolescents”, LENA) was conducted 
between November 2013 and April 2019.
2.1.1.  Disease or condition
Paediatric heart failure (PHF) represents an important cause of morbidity and mortality in childhood. 
Etiology and pathogenesis are different between adults and children: the first mainly relates to 
ischemia, the latter is a consequence of congenital heart diseases (CHDs) or cardiomyopathies in most 
cases.
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
Although the estimated incidence of heart failure is relatively low at 0.9–7.4 per 100,000 children, it is 
a disease that carries a high burden of morbidity and mortality, with an in-hospital mortality rate of 7–
26%. Infants account for the majority (64%) of heart failure admissions in patients ≤18 years of age 
(Burstain DS at all; Am Heart J 2019, 209: 9 – 19; Rossano JW J Card Fail 2012; 18: 459 – 70). 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis
In children, cardiac failure is most often due to CHDs and cardiomyopathies. The underlying 
pathophysiology of the PHF in CHD could be left to right shunt with volume overload, valvular 
regurgitation, outflow tract obstruction or coronary insufficiency. In cardiomyopathies the 
pathophysiology is related often to systolic dysfunction with low cardiac output or to diastolic 
dysfunction with elevated pulmonary capillary pressure. Other causes of HF in children could be 
arrhythmias or infection resulting in systolic dysfunction. 
Assessment report 
EMA/481595/2023 
Page 10/85
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
In infant and young children the typical presentation is characterized by difficulty in feeding, cyanosis, 
tachypnea, sinus tachycardia, and diaphoresis. 
Older children and adolescence often present symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, tachypnea, 
and exercise intolerance. Abdominal pain, oliguria, and leg pitting edema may also be present. The 
severity of HF in children is usually staged according to the Ross modified classification that recognizes 
four functional classes with increasing severity of clinical features from I to IV. 
The diagnostic approach in patients with PHF is based on noninvasive clinical investigations: 
electrocardiography, chest radiography, echocardiography, laboratory investigation. These can be 
followed in some more complex cases by cardiac magnetic resonance, cardiac catheterisation and 
endomyocardial biopsy. 
2.1.5.  Management
Currently, there are well-established guidelines for the management of heart failure in the adult 
population. Due to the lack of research trials in children, the clinical guidelines for the treatment of PHF 
have historically been reliant on expert consensus, and the extrapolation of data from trials performed 
in adults.
In the clinical setting, diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) are used, with 
beta-blockers and devices for electric therapy as other options. In the end-stage disease, heart 
transplantation is the best choice of treatment, while a left ventricular assist device can be used as a 
bridge to transplantation (due to the difficulties in finding organ donors), recovery (in the case of 
myocarditis), or destination therapy (for patients with systemic disease). In adults, enalapril is licensed 
for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure, as well as for reducing proteinuria in chronic 
kidney disease (CKD). The SmPC for Renitec reference medicinal product states that there is only 
limited experience of the use of enalapril in hypertensive paediatric patients in greater than 6 years of 
age. The mechanism of action of enalapril and its potential pharmacodynamic interactions are believed 
to be similar in adults and paediatric patients.
The importance of pharmacological treatment in PHF, especially dilated cardiomyopathies, is 
emphasized by the low availability of donor hearts. Owing to this scarcity, mortality within the first 
year of presentation remains extremely high, highlighting the need for optimal treatment in children to 
prevent or postpone transplantation. In children, whilst in clinical practice enalapril is used for similar 
indications as adults, in the European Union (EU) it is only licensed for use in children with 
hypertension and a body weight over 20 kg. In children with heart failure the doses of enalapril used 
(off-label) are based on empirical evidence combined with data extrapolated from adult studies. A 
further challenge regarding dosing of ACE-I in paediatrics is the lack of authorised age-appropriate 
formulations licensed for use in paediatric heart failure throughout EU.
Therefore, there is an unmet medical need for a licensed medicinal product for children with heart 
failure that could be administered with age-appropriate formulations.
2.2.  About the product
Enalapril is an ethyl ester pro-drug, and its pharmacological effects are mediated by its active 
metabolite, enalaprilat (also known as MK422). The main effect of enalaprilat is the inhibition of ACE, a 
key component in the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS). This leads to a decrease in the 
formation of angiotensin II and thereby to peripheral vasodilation. This is followed by a diminished 
Assessment report 
EMA/481595/2023 
Page 11/85
secretion of aldosterone, causing less sodium and fluid retention. These two mechanisms cause a 
decrease in blood pressure (BP), and a decreased preload and afterload of the heart as summarised by 
Brunner (1981). In addition to its stimulatory effect on aldosterone secretion, angiotensin II is able to 
directly increase the activity of the epithelial sodium channel (Zaika 2013). This leads to maximum 
sodium reabsorption, a process that is also reduced by ACE inhibitors. In adults, enalapril is licensed 
for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure, as well as for reducing proteinuria in chronic 
kidney disease (CKD). In addition to their BP lowering effect, ACE inhibitors have a role in the 
treatment of patients with heart failure, because they prevent (further) cardiac remodelling, as shown 
by Konstam (1993). In CKD the beneficial effect of enalapril is mostly the result of a decrease in 
glomerular pressure due to a relaxation of the efferent arterioles (Zhang 2017).
In children, whilst in clinical practice enalapril is used for similar indications as adults, in the European 
Union it is only recommended for use in children with hypertension and a body weight over 20 kg. In 
the harmonised  SmPC for enalapril (CPMP/3175; 4 Dec 2003) a statement was included that enalapril 
is not recommended in children in indications other than hypertension. Despite a positive benefit/risk 
ratio of enalapril in the treatment of hypertension in children over 20kg, an evaluation by the European 
Medicines Agency concluded that data on the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of 
enalapril in this population appear scarce (CPMP/3175; 4 Dec 2003). In children below the weight of 20 
kg, even less data is available.
Current dose recommendations in children with HF are based on empirical evidence combined with 
data extrapolated from adult studies. A further challenge regarding dosing of ACE-I in paediatrics up 
until now was the lack of authorised age-appropriate formulations licensed for use in paediatric HF 
throughout Europe.
2.3.  Type of application and aspects on development
This is a Paediatric Use Marketing Authorisation (PUMA) application for Aqumeldi 0.25 mg oro-
dispersible tablets (ODMT). The applicant applied initially for registration of both enalapril ODMT 
strengths: 0.25mg and 1 mg. The 1 mg strength was withdrawn during the procedure.
The proposed indication was:
Aqumeldi is indicated for the treatment of heart failure in children from birth to less than 18 years.
The applicant submitted four clinical studies WP07-WP10. WP07 is a relative bioavailability trial 
between Aqumeldi ODMTs and one of the current enalapril medicinal products in the market. Relative 
bioavailability was demonstrated for the Aqumeldi ODMT formulation in two methods of administration: 
swallowing or dispersing in the voluntary’s tongue. 
Studies WP08 and WP09 had similar design and conduct but directed to different patient conditions, 
dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and congenital heart disease (CHD), respectively. PK data generated 
underwent non-compartmental analysis aimed at the comparison between treatment status (naïve or 
pre-treated patients) and between age groups. On the basis of these results the applicant proposed a 
joint population PK (popPK) analysis of the whole data with covariates such as sex, age, weight, 
height, disease score, GFR, aetiology of disease and further relevant covariates. The two studies 
provided relevant data to support dosing recommendations in all the proposed population except 
neonates. Further extrapolation exercise permitted to agree the dosing for the youngest age group.

2.4.  Quality aspects
2.4.1.  Introduction
The finished product is presented as orodispersible tablets containing 0.25 of enalapril maleate 
(equivalent to 0.19 mg of enalapril) as active substance.
Initially, the strength of 1 mg of of enalapril maleate (equivalent to 0.76 mg of enalapril) was also 
applied but this strength was withdrawn during evaluation.
Other ingredients are: mannitol (E421), crospovidone, poly(vinyl acetate), povidone, sodium 
laurilsulfate, sodium stearyl fumarate, and silica, colloidal anhydrous  
The product is available in a high density polyethylene bottle with polypropylene cap equipped with a 
child-resistant, tamper evident closure system and a silica desiccant and one scoop to allow extraction 
of the tablets from the bottle as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.4.2.  Active Substance
General information
The 
chemical  name  of  enalapril  maleate 
is 
(2S)-1-[(2S)-2-[[(1S)-1-(Ethoxycarbonyl)-3-
phenylpropyl]amino]propanoyl]pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic  acid  hydrogen  (Z)-butenedioate  corresponding 
to  the  molecular  formula  C24H32N2O9.  It  has  a  relative  molecular  weigth  of  492.5    and  the  following 
structure:
Figure 1: Active substance structure
As there is a monograph of the active substance in the European Pharmacopoeia, the manufacturer of 
the active substance has been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP) 
which has been provided within the current Marketing Authorisation Application.
The chemical structure elucidation of the active substance is subject to CEP. 
The active substance is a white or almost white, crystalline powder, sparingly soluble in water, freely 
soluble  in  methanol  and  practically  insoluble  in  methylene  chloride.  It  dissolves  in  dilute  solutions  of 
alkali hydroxides. Its hygroscopicity is low.
Enalapril maleate exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of three chiral centres. Two polymorphic 
forms have been observed as per literature: Forms I and II.

EMA/481595/2023 
Page 13/85
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls
The supplier of the active substance enalapril maleate has a CEP used in the MAA.
The relevant information has been assessed by the EDQM before issuing the Certificate of Suitability.
The active substance is packaged in a clear low density polyethylene bag which complies with the EC 
directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. This bag is placed inside a low density 
polyethylene bag and each bag is individually tied. This double polyethylene bag pack is placed in a 
HDPE container with a lid and this outer container is also sealed. Silica gel is placed between HDPE 
drum and polythene bag. 
Specification
Enalapril maleate complies with the Ph. Eur monograph and is controlled by the suppliers in accordance 
with the current relevant CEP.
The active substance specification tested by the finished product manufacturer includes tests for 
appearance (Ph. Eur.), identification  (Ph. Eur.), appearance of solution (Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. Eur.), 
specific optical rotation (Ph. Eur.), related substances (Ph. Eur.), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), sulfated ash 
(Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), residual solvents (CEP), microbiological contamination (Ph. Eur), and particle 
size distribution (Laser diffraction). 
The control tests were carried out to comply with the specifications and test methods of the Ph. Eur. 
monograph.  In addition to the tests covered by the Ph, Eur. monograph, supplementary tests for a 
residual solvents have been added to the specification in line with the CEP. All additional methods have 
been adequately validated and described according to ICH Q2. 
Stability
Long-term stability studies were conducted on five active substance batches stored in the proposed 
packaging in conditions of 25°C / 60% RH. Sixty months’ data are available for all batches except for 
one batch, where 48 months’ data are submitted and two batches where 36 months’ data are 
submitted. Studies under accelerated conditions (40°C / 75% RH in line with ICH Q1A) were provided 
for three batches. One batch was tested at intermediate conditions of 30°C / 75% RH. Parameters 
tested included: loss on drying, specific optical rotation, related substances, assay and appearance.
All the results are within acceptance limits and no trends of concern were observed. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance is sufficiently stable. The stability results justify 
the proposed retest period of 60 months stored at 25°C (excursions allowed between 15°C and 30°C) 
in the proposed container.
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product
The finished product is presented as: white, round, biconvex orodispersible tablets, 2 mm in diameter 
containing 0.25mg enalapril maleate as the active substance.
Assessment report 
EMA/481595/2023 
Page 14/85
The product is provided with a plastic (high impact polystyrene) scoop to facilitate the removal of the 
orodispersible tablets from the bottle. The scoop is not intended for counting or measuring purposes.
The aim of the pharmaceutical development programme was to develop a stable age-appropriate 
dosage form that would allow accurate and yet flexible dosing to paediatric patients from birth. 
Although oral liquids are considered to be acceptable for the whole paediatric age range, including 
neonates, the development of an age-appropriate flexible solid oral dosage form was required due to 
the limited aqueous stability of enalapril maleate; mini-tablets offer the advantages of ease of 
swallowing and dose flexibility and may be produced by conventional manufacturing processes. In 
addition, mini-tablets (2 mm diameter) have been shown to be accepted by both infants and neonates. 
Orodispersible mini-tablets which exhibit similar dimensions to mini tablets but disintegrate quickly 
upon contact with water (or saliva) thereby reducing the potential risk of choking have been 
developed, and were selected as the dosage form for enalapril maleate.
The quality of the active substance is covered by a Certificate of Suitability (CEP) of the European 
Directorate of Quality of Medicines (EDQM). 
A solubility study using the highest therapeutic dose in 250 mL across a pH range of pH 1.0, pH 4.5, 
and pH 7.5 was carried out on the active substance. All results comply to the acceptance criteria. 
Although two polymorphs of enalapril maleate exist (forms I and II), the relatively high solubility of the 
material, together with data suggesting the polymorphs exhibit similar pharmaceutical properties 
negate the value or requirement to control the crystalline form of the enalapril maleate. XRPD analysis 
confirms the crystalline form II is not altered by the manufacturing process or storage conditions.
The excipients and their concentrations were selected based on their accepted use in orodispersible 
tablets  manufactured by direct compression, their acceptability in the proposed patient population, 
and through pharmaceutical development studies. A number of concerns regarding the processed 
material of one of the excipients have been satisfactorily addressed by the applicant. During the 
assessment the CHMP recommended that additional data on intermediate precision (determination of 
saponification value and photometric determination of povidone) and accuracy (gravimetric assay of 
crospovidone) should be provided. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their 
quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards except iron oxide yellow which is controlled for USP/NF. 
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included 
in section 6.1 of the SmPC.
In relation to formulation development of the finished product, a Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) 
was defined at the beginning of the development programme, and was subsequently updated, following 
process  development  studies  and  the  generation  of  clinical  and  stability  data.  The  possible  variables 
during  various  stages  involved  in  manufacturing  process  were  identified  and  the  effect  of  the  critical 
variables on the performance of the formulation were evaluated. The parameters which form part of the 
QTPP are considered suitable.
During formulation development different prototypes containing varying amounts of active substance as 
well as various excipients of different functions  were evaluated together in order to determine the most 
suitable combination. In order to achieve this, the applicant used the principles of Quality by Design but 
did not claim a full design space. 
A dissolution method was developed based upon the USP monograph for enalapril maleate tablets and 
in  accordance  with  Ph  Eur  2.9.3.  Comparative  dissolution  study  results  between  test  product  and 
reference  product  batches  all  showed  more  than  85%  dissolution  in  15  minutes.  Furthermore,  the 
applicant developed a disintegration method which showed Enalapril maleate ODMTs disintegrate in no 
Assessment report 
EMA/481595/2023 
Page 15/85
more  than  3  minutes.  The  CHMP  requested  as  a  major  objection  (MO)  the  dissolution  method  .The 
applicant  addressed  the  issue  and  the  responses  were  considered  satisfactory  Therefore,  since  it  has 
been demonstrated that, due to the BCS classification of the active substance (which has high solubility), 
dissolution  and  disintegration  are  very  fast,  ensuring  the  quick  release  of  the  active  substance,  the 
change from a dissolution to a disintegration method was accepted.
A  series  of  experiments  were  conducted  to  investigate  the  dispersion  of  the  orodispersible  tablets  in 
water  and  the  administration  of  aliquots  of  the  resulting  solution  to  allow  the  required  dosing  to  the 
group of patients which require an initial dose less than 0.25 mg (low-weight neonates). Two approaches 
were investigated: approach using measuring cylinder and approach using syringe. The assay results of 
doses administered using the measuring cylinder dispersion procedure showed uniform doses of 0.125 
mg enalapril maleate could be administered, but not the lower dose of 0.025 mg. In addition, the mean 
assay results were consistently high. The results for doses administered using the oral syringe dispersion 
were provided, the application of this dispersion method complied with Ph. Eur. 2.9.6. acceptance criteria 
for uniformity of content. The syringe method of dispersion was therefore considered to be acceptable, 
especially since it had the added benefit of being less complex to execute compared to the measuring 
cylinder approach. The syringe dispersion method was successfully used in the clinical studies for initial 
dose titration of low-weight neonates.
Patients  may  require  medicine  administration  via  nasogastric  tube  (NGT)  and  the  feasibility  of 
administering the orodispersible tablets  via this route was investigated. Dose recovery and NGT blocking 
were considered and evaluated with polyurethane (PUR), silicone and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) NGTs. The 
results  showed  that  no  evidence  of  blockage  was  observed,  showing  that  the  dispersion  could  be 
successfully administered through NGTs.
The primary packaging is high density polyethylene bottle with polypropylene cap equipped with a child-
resistant, tamper evident closure system. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The 
choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been  validated  by  stability  data  and  is  adequate  for  the 
intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls
The finished product is manufactured by one manufacturing site.
The manufacturing process consists of a standard dry powder blending and direct compression process. 
The tablets are then filled into high density polyethylene bottles which are closed with a polypropylene 
screw cap equipped with a child-resistant, tamper evident closure system and a silica desiccant. The 
manufacturing process consists of 4 main steps: blending, compression, and packaging. The process is 
considered to be a  standard manufacturing process.
A major objection was raised with respect to the lack of homogeneity of 0.25 mg and 1 mg  strengths. 
The applicant withdrew the 1 mg strength prior to the CHMP opinion and the issue was considered 
resolved. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process of the 0.25 mg strength is capable of producing the 
finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for 
this pharmaceutical form.

Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf life specification  include appropriate tests for this kind of 
dosage form: appearance (visual), diameter, water content (KF), identity (UV, HPLC), assay (HPLC), 
purity (HPLC, LC-MS), disintegration (Ph. Eur.), and microbial contamination (Ph. Eur.). 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities Based on the risk 
assessment and the presented batch data it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any 
elemental impurity controls.
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product 
has been performed (as requested as MO) considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with 
the “Questions and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for 
the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal 
products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation 
EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based 
on the information provided, nitrosamine impurities were tested for and found in the finished product. 
However, amounts were less than 10% of the LOQ and therefore no specific control measures are 
deemed necessary. The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference 
standards used for testing has been presented.
Batch analysis results are provided for 3 commercial scale batches per strength confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification. 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing.
Stability of the product
Stability data from 13 commercial scale batches of the finished product stored for up to 48 months 
under long term conditions (25°C / 60% RH), under intermediate conditions (30°C/65% RH) for up 12 
months and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40°C / 75% RH) according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for 
marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. 
Samples were tested for appearance, water content, assay, purity, disintegration, dissolution and 
microbial contamination. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
The 0.25 mg showed degradation at the higher temperatures of accelerated and intermediate storage 
conditions. There was a decreasing trend of assay values with the 6 month data at the accelerated 
storage conditions for most of batches going out of specification. The assay values showed a 
degradation at the intermediate storage conditions but stayed within the specification at the 12 month 
time point. A significant change was observed in the assay values for some of the batches and 
therefore as per the ICH Q1E Guidelines – Evaluation of Stability data, the shelf life will be based on 
the long term stability data. Based on the stability data so far, the 0.25mg strength is expected to 
meet the specification for at least 24 months.
In-use stability studies have been performed to establish a period of time during which the multi-dose 
product can be used whilst retaining quality within an accepted specification once the container has 
Assessment report 
EMA/481595/2023 
Page 17/85
been opened. At intervals appropriate quantities of drug product were removed from the primary 
container by the intended dispensing method and under normal conditions of use. 
During investigation of in-use stability at beginning of shelf-life, samples were stored under ambient 
conditions (15-25°C). Samples to be analysed at end of shelf life are stored under ICH long term 
conditions of 25°C ± 2°C / 60% ± 5% RH until the start of the in-use stability study and throughout 
investigation of in-use stability.  All the results stayed within the specification parameters over the 
storage period of 101 days.
Forced degradation studies have been performed to establish the stability indicating nature of the 
finished product analytical methods and to identify the degradation mechanisms of the finished 
product. The testing was done at acidic stress (5M hydrochloric acid, 50°C, 60 mins), alkaline stress 
(1M NaOH solution, RT, 60 mins), peroxidic stress (3% H2O2, RT, 10 min)  and thermal stress (80°C, 
20h) conditions. Subsequent studies were performed under stronger conditions in order to achieve 
degradation of at least 10% for alkaline stress,  peroxidic stress, and thermal stress conditions..The 
product is specifically sensitive to the acidic and thermal stress and shows resistance to oxidative 
stress.
In addition,  one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. Based on the results of the photostability study, exposure to light 
does not have  an impact on the stability, therefore the finished product is photostable.
A bulk hold time stability study was conducted to provide analytical data to support a hold time. The 
bulk product was sealed in a double-layer PE bag using a bag tie. The sealed PE-bag was transferred 
into a PE-container and the PE-container was closed with the corresponding lid. The container with the 
bulk product was stored in a climate-controlled warehouse, 15 to 25°C and humidity NMT 40% R.H. 
The bulk product was stored for 12 weeks from the date of manufacture. The results from the bulk 
hold time stability study confirm no significant change when stored in the bulk container closure 
system stored in warehouse storage conditions of 15-25°C and ≤40% R.H.
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years for 0.25 strength and do not store 
above 25°C as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. After first opening, use within 100 
days.
Adventitious agents
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.
During evaluation 5 major objections were raised by the CHMP in relation to dissolution results, 
dissolution test method, lack of homogeneity, proposed limits of impurities and risk assessment of 
nitrosamines. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no 
impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product which pertain to provide  additional data on 
intermediate precision (determination of saponification value and photometric determination of 
Assessment report 
EMA/481595/2023 
Page 18/85
povidone) and accuracy (gravimetric assay of crospovidone) for one excipient. This point is put forward 
and agreed as recommendations for future quality development.
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance and/or finished 
product and their manufacturing process. However, no design spaces were claimed for the 
manufacturing process of the active substance, nor for the finished product.
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.4.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation:
- To provide additional data on intermediate precision (determination of saponification value and 
photometric determination of povidone) and accuracy (gravimetric assay of crospovidone) for one 
excipient.
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects
2.5.1.  Introduction
This is a Paediatric Use Marketing Authorisation (PUMA) Application and no new non-clinical studies 
were submitted. Instead, only published data were provided. This was considered acceptable. 
Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of enalapril maleate are well known. 
Furthermore, among others, published non-clinical studies conducted with enalapril included studies 
with juvenile animals.  Information on available non-clinical data was included in the following sections. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology
No non-clinical pharmacology studies have been performed with Aqumeldi, which is acceptable. 
Enalapril (i.e., its active metabolite enalaprilat) is a potent and specific inhibitor of ACE in vitro and in 
vivo. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor 
substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. 
The beneficial effects of enalapril in hypertension and heart failure appear to result primarily from 
suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma 
angiotensin II, which leads to lower vasopressor activity, and to reduced aldosterone secretion. 
Following oral administration, enalapril is bioactivated by hydrolysis to enalaprilat, which is the 
pharmacologically active ACE inhibitor. 
Enalaprilat is a potent inhibitor of ACE in vitro (IC50 of 1.2 nM, hog plasma). ACE is identical to 
kininase II, which degrades bradykinin and other kinins that stimulate production of NO, cyclic GMP, 
and vasoactive eicosanoids. The inhibition is specific; i.e., enalapril and enalaprilat did not inhibit the in 
Assessment report 
EMA/481595/2023 
Page 19/85
vitro activity of various proteolytic enzymes such as trypsin, carboxypeptidase A and B, plasmin, 
chymotrypsin, and renin [FDA (1985)].
The inhibition of the acute pressor response to angiotensin I in anaesthetized and unanaesthetized rats 
and dogs was used to assess the in vivo ACE inhibitory activity of enalaprilat and enalapril. In 
anaesthetized rats, single doses of enalaprilat (100 μg/kg i.v.) and enalapril (60 μg/kg i.v.) produced a 
prolonged inhibition of ACE (over 2 hours). In anaesthetized dogs, the IC50 values for inhibition of the 
angiotensin I-induced pressor response were 6 μg/kg i.v. for enalaprilat and 278 μg/kg i.v. for 
enalapril. Oral ACE inhibitory activity of enalapril was demonstrated in rats and renal hypertensive 
dogs [FDA (1985)].
No formal safety pharmacology studies in accordance to ICH S7A were conducted with enalapril. 
Enalapril and enalaprilat (each 10 μM) were without activity in radiobinding assays in rat brain for 
dopamine, neuroleptic, serotonin-1 and -2, alpha-2-adrenergic, beta-adrenergic, muscarinic 
cholinergic, GABA, and benzodiazepine receptors. In conscious and anesthetized dogs, enalapril (1 
mg/kg, p.o. or 0.1-1 mg/kg i.v.) caused a slight increase in cardiac output and a decrease in peripheral 
resistance. Enalapril displayed no overt signs of central nervous system activity and had no significant 
effect on the respiratory system or on the gastrointestinal transit time [FDA (1985)]. The toxicity 
reported with enalapril in neonatal rats is viewed as relevant to humans, but the timing of exposure is 
a critical factor in the development of altered renal morphology as summarized by Zoetis and Hurtt 
(2003).
Considering that this is a Paediatric Use Marketing Authorisation (PUMA) application, data from juvenile 
animal safety studies from the published literature have been included in the non-clinical overview (see 
below).
Rats
Postnatal days 1-7
Nephrogenesis is normally accompanied by a tightly regulated and efficient vascularization. Yim et al 
(2016) investigated the effect of angiotensin II inhibition on angiogenesis in the developing rat kidney. 
Newborn rat pups were treated with enalapril (30 mg/kg/day) or vehicle (control) for 7 days after 
birth. Renal histological changes were checked using Hematoxylin & Eosin staining. Yim et al (2016) 
also investigated the intrarenal expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, VEGF 
receptor 1 (VEGFR1), VEGFR2, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-B, and PDGF receptor-β with 
Western blotting and immunohistochemical staining at postnatal day 8. Expression of the endothelial 
cell marker CD31 was examined to determine glomerular and peritubular capillary density. Enalapril-
treated rat kidneys showed disrupted tubules and vessels when compared with the control rat kidneys. 
In the enalapril-treated group, intrarenal VEGF-A protein expression was significantly higher, whereas 
VEGFR1 protein expression was lower than that in the control group (P<0.05). The expression of 
VEGFR2, PDGF-B, and PDGF receptor-β was not different between the 2 groups. The increased 
capillary CD31 expression on the western blots of enalapril-treated rat kidneys indicated that the total 
endothelial cell protein level was increased, while the cortical capillary density, assessed using CD31 
VEGF-VEGFR signalling and altered capillary repair may play a role in the deterioration of the kidney 
vasculature after blocking of angiotensin II during renal development.
Postnatal days 1-28
Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) during kidney development produces chronic alterations 
in renal morphology and function that have been characterized in detail in adult animals. The aim of a 
study by Guron (2005) was to determine the consequences of neonatal angiotensin-converting enzyme 
(ACE) inhibition on renal haemodynamics and function in rats at a much earlier age, namely 3-4 weeks. 
Male Wistar pups received daily intraperitoneal injections of enalapril (10 mg/kg) or isotonic saline from 
Assessment report 
EMA/481595/2023 
Page 20/85
birth until 24-28 days of age, when renal haemodynamics and function were assessed using clearance 
techniques  under  pentobarbital  anaesthesia.  Enalapril-treated  rats  showed  significant  reductions  in 
glomerular filtration rate (GFR; -44 +/- 6%; P < 0.05), effective renal plasma flow (ERPF; -33 +/- 6%; 
P < 0.05) and filtration fraction (-16 +/- 3%; P < 0.05) compared with saline-treated controls. Although 
mean arterial pressure tended to be lower in enalapril-treated rats, this group demonstrated a significant 
increase in renal vascular resistance compared with control rats (RVR; 46 +/- 6 vs 32 +/- 3 mmHg/mL 
per·min  per  g·kidney  weight,  respectively;  P  <  0.05).  In  enalapril-treated  rats,  urine  osmolality  was 
reduced (-59 +/- 5%; P < 0.05) and urine flow rate and fractional urinary excretion rates of sodium and 
potassium  were  markedly  elevated  compared  with  controls  (P  <  0.05).  Enalapril-treated  rats  showed 
severe renal histological abnormalities, including wall thickening of cortical arterioles, papillary atrophy 
and tubulointerstitial alterations, mimicking those described previously in similarly treated rats examined 
in adulthood. It was concluded by Guron (2005) that neonatal ACE inhibition in rats induces pronounced 
alterations in renal haemodynamics and function, characterized by reductions in ERPF and GFR, increased 
RVR and impaired tubular sodium and water reabsorption, which are evident at weaning.
Mice
Postnatal days 1-10
Inhibition of the RAS at different steps by postnatal administration of aliskiren as well as enalapril also 
caused a significant reduction in glomerular size in wild-type mice (Table 2.4-1).
Safety pharmacology studies in accordance with ICH S7A guideline are not available for enalapril, as 
some pharmacology studies were performed before the introduction of this battery of studies. Also 
based on its prolonged and widespread clinical use, the fact that specific safety studies are not 
available is not considered to be a limitation for this assessment.
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics
Studies with enalapril in several species of animals revealed differences in the extent of the 
systemically available fraction after oral administration. The estimated systemically available fraction 
was 44% in rats, 64% in dogs, and 78% in rhesus monkeys following oral administration. Peak plasma 
levels of radioactivity were attained within 1 hour in rats, in 2 hours in dogs, and in 7 hours in 
monkeys. Excretions after an i.v. dose occurred mainly via the kidney, the 72-hour urinary excretions 
being 69%, 78%, and 71% of the administered dose in dogs, rats, and monkeys, respectively. Faecal 
excretions, apparently via the bile, were between 14-19% in the three species. After oral dosing, 
urinary excretions were 40% of the dose in dogs, 20% of the dose in rats, and 25% of the dose in 
monkeys and faecal excretions were 35%, 72%, and 36% of the dose in the three species, 
respectively. In rats, dogs and hamsters, radioactivity from 14C-enalapril was distributed primarily in 
the liver, kidneys, and lungs; radioactivity did not accumulate in any tissue upon repeated 
administration to rats. Neither enalapril nor enalaprilat effectively crossed the blood-brain barrier, 
Assessment report 
EMA/481595/2023 
Page 21/85
whereas radioactivity from 14C-enalapril was transferred via the placenta in hamsters and was 
incorporated into milk in rats [FDA (1985)].
The major metabolite of enalapril in dog and monkey urine was the active diacid enalaprilat. In vitro 
studies showed that hydrolysis of enalapril to enalaprilat occurred in the plasma of rat, mouse, gerbil 
and, to a lesser extent, guinea-pig. The plasma of man, dog, rabbit, monkey, cat, and hamster did not 
hydrolyze enalapril whereas liver homogenates from rat, dog, and man were capable of the 
bioactivation. Evidence for metabolism of enalapril to enalaprilat in addition to hydrolysis was found 
only in monkeys where approximately 16% of the urinary radioactivity was identified as des-propyl 
enalaprilat [FDA (1985)].
As there are interspecies differences in absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion, human 
pharmacokinetics cannot reliably be predicted from animal studies. However, as bioactivation and 
pharmacological action such as effects on the RAAS are broadly similar, results derived from animal 
studies give a preliminary guidance with regard to safety and efficacy of enalapril in man [FDA 
(1985)].
2.5.4.  Toxicology
Enalapril was assessed in a series of nonclinical studies and has been used in therapy for many years. 
Toxicokinetic investigations were not included in most of the toxicity studies. Despite this, the available 
results still allow a toxicological evaluation. Although the studies were not always performed to the 
current state of the art, this is more than compensated for by the many years of clinical experience 
with enalapril. Toxicity studies with enalapril have been performed in mice, rats, rabbits, and dogs and 
were conducted according to Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations. 
Acute toxicity of enalapril in mice and rats was investigated after oral, intravenous and subcutaneous 
administration; the LD50 values were 2 g/kg in both species (males and females) after oral 
administration. Signs of acute toxicity in both species were decreased activity, ptosis, bradypnoea, and 
loss of righting reflex. In female mice, pre-treatment with oral doses of HCT (900 mg/kg) did not 
significantly affect the acute toxicity of enalapril given orally one hour later whereas pretreatment with 
27 mg/kg p.o. enalapril slightly increased the i.p. toxicity of HCT [FDA (1985)].
One-year toxicity studies were conducted with enalapril in rats at doses up to 90 mg/kg/day and in 
beagle dogs at doses up to 15 mg/kg/day. No drug-related histopathological lesions were reported in 
either study. With the exception of a slight reduction in body weight gain, rats tolerated a dose of 10 
mg/kg/day. In addition to body weight loss, higher doses (30 and 90 mg/kg/day) caused serum 
biochemical changes (increased blood urea nitrogen, electrolyte changes) and a suspected increase in 
mortality. Dogs tolerated doses up to 15 mg/kg/day for one year without any important toxicity; the 
no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) in dogs could not be established but is at least 15 
mg/kg/day. However, dogs given doses up to 90 mg/kg/day in subchronic studies exhibited renal 
functional changes (nephrosis, increases in serum urea nitrogen and glucose, electrolyte changes), 
increases in GOT, GPT and/or alkaline phosphatase in serum accompanied by liver lesions, and 
mortalities. Saline supplementation was shown to ameliorate the toxicity of 50 mg/kg/day enalapril in 
dogs [FDA (1985)].
Maternal and foetal toxicity occurred in some rabbits at doses of 1 mg/kg/day or more. Saline 
supplementation prevented the maternal and foetal toxicity seen at doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg/day, but 
not at 30 mg/kg/day. Enalapril was not teratogenic in rabbits. There was no foetotoxicity or 
teratogenicity in rats treated with up to 200 mg/kg/day of enalapril. Foetotoxicity expressed as a 
decrease in average foetal weight occurred in rats given 1200 mg/kg/day of enalapril but did not occur 
when these animals were supplemented with saline [FDA (1985)].
Assessment report 
EMA/481595/2023 
Page 22/85
Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, as a class, have been shown to be foetotoxic (causing injury 
and/or death to the foetus) when given in the second or third trimester [FDA (1985)].
Enalapril was not mutagenic in the Ames microbial mutagen test with or without metabolic activation, 
in the rec-assay, sister chromatid exchange with cultured Chinese hamster cells (up to 20 mg/ml), and 
the micro-nucleus test with mice. In the in vitro chromosomal aberration test, enalapril was clastogenic 
at 10 and 20 mg/ml but not at 5 mg/ml [FDA (1985)].
There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect when enalapril was administered for 106 weeks to rats 
at doses up to 90 mg/kg/day (150 times the maximum daily human dose). Enalapril has also been 
administered for 94 weeks to male and female mice at doses up to 90 and 180 mg/kg/day, 
respectively (150 and 300 times the MRHDD for humans based on body weight; 13 times and MRHDD 
on a body surface area basis), and no evidence of carcinogenicity was noted [FDA (1985)].
A full regulatory toxicology program has already demonstrated an adequate safety profile of enalapril. 
Non-clinical data for enalapril reveal no special hazard for humans (adults and paediatric age groups) 
based on conventional studies of ancillary pharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, genotoxicity and 
carcinogenic potential. Enalapril and its salt enalapril maleate have been adequately studied in 
extensive nonclinical toxicity studies reported in literature. There are no toxicological concerns.
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment
An environmental risk assessment has been performed to evaluate the potential environmental risk 
resulting from the use of enalapril 0.25 mg orodispersible tablet containing 0.25 mg (as maleate) per 
orodispersible tablet. No bioaccumulation of enalapril is expected since the logDow determined for 
enalapril according to OECD 107 under GLP conditions showed values below the threshold value of 4.5. 
Results from Phase I studies were:
As the predicted concentration in surface water is above the limit value of 0.01 μg/l, the calculation 
was further refined by the applicant using the prevalence data of heart failure in children from birth to 
17 years in Spain, since it is the only country where prevalence data of heart failure in the paediatric 
population was detected in the public domain. This data has been used as representative for other 
European countries. The refined calculated concentration of enalapril in surface water was well below 
the threshold of 0.01 μg/l. Since no other environmental concerns are apparent, it is agreed that the 
medicinal product is unlikely to represent a risk for the environment making further testing of 
environmental effects not necessary.  
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects
The legal basis of this submission falls under Article 10.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended (“Hybrid 
application”). This hybrid application relies on the results of pre-clinical tests conducted for the 
reference product RENITEC® enalapril maleate tablets. No new animal or in vitro studies have been 
conducted. Considering that this is a Paediatric Use Marketing Authorisation (PUMA) Application, data 
from juvenile animal safety studies have been included in the Non-clinical Overview. The Overview was 
based on literature review and was considered  appropriate. 
Assessment report 
EMA/481595/2023 
Page 23/85
Enalapril and its salt enalapril maleate have been adequately studied in extensive nonclinical toxicity 
studies reported in literature. There are no toxicological concerns identified. The non-clinical aspects of 
the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been discussed 
and is considered acceptable.
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects
The CHMP considered the application acceptable from non-clinical point of view. 
2.6.  Clinical aspects
2.6.1.  Introduction
To address the unmet medical need for a licensed enalapril product for children with HF, a Framework 
7 project (“Labeling of Enalapril from Neonates up to Adolescents”, LENA) was conducted between 
November 2013 and April 2019. Within this time frame, the task was to perform a paediatric drug 
development program and collectively generate all necessary data to lay the groundwork for a 
paediatric-use marketing authorization (PUMA). The LENA project generated core scientific data from 
four clinical trials WP07, WP08, WP09 and WP10. For the clinical trials, WP02 had developed Enalapril 
Orodispersible Mini-Tablets (ODMTs) of 1 mg and 0.25 mg. WP07 generated clinical data for Enalapril 
ODMTs in healthy adult volunteers. WP08, WP09 and WP10 generated clinical data for Enalapril ODMTs 
in children with heart failure. WP06 developed case report forms and performed data management for 
the clinical studies.
The clinical program includes a relative bioavailability study (WP07) between the new enalapril ODMT 
administration and the already marketed immediate release tablets. This relative bioavailability study 
was conducted with the highest strength (1 mg ODMT) and demonstrated equivalent pharmacokinetics 
/ bioequivalence to the reference product (Renitec® 5 mg tablets). A bioavailability study for the 
enalapril ODMT 0.25mg in adults was not required as part of the PIP as it was considered that a 
biowaiver would suffice. A BCS-based biowaiver for enalapril ODMT 0.25mg, is proposed according to 
the following grounds: 
- Enalapril maleate is classified as BCS class III, which corresponds to its classification by the WHO 
[Verbeeck 2017]. Enalapril maleate, the active substance present in both enalapril ODMT and the 
reference product, is “highly soluble” as defined by the EMA, FDA and WHO BCS guidelines (solubility is 
at least 5 mg/ml over the pH range 1.2 to 6.8), whereas it is assumed not to be highly permeable, as 
supported by a negative log D estimation. Notably in this sense, pharmacokinetic data show that only 
60-70% of an oral dose of enalapril maleate is absorbed from the intestinal tract into the enterocytes. 
Although estimates of enalapril’s effective intestinal permeability are high and the lack of complete 
absorption may be due to hydrolysis of enalapril to enalaprilat within the gut lumen, it cannot be 
unequivocally ruled out that absorption (fa) is less than the cutoff value, especially in light of the low 
log D value. Thus, enalapril cannot conclusively be considered a highly absorbable drug substance 
[Verbeeck 2017]. 
- Enalapril is not considered to have a narrow therapeutic index [Verbeeck 2017]. 
- A similar bioavailability was found for 10 x 1 mg ODMT formulation when compared to 2 x 5 mg 
Renitec® tablets as shown in PK study WP07. This allows the conclusion that, when administered as an 
ODMT, enalapril is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, while absorption in the oral cavity can be

Page 24/85
excluded. Therefore, extending the concept of BCS-based biowaiver, which applies to immediate-
release solid oral dosage forms, to enalapril ODMT appears endorsed. 
- Enalapril shows a linear pharmacokinetic in the dose range of 0.25 mg and 1 mg, as found in the PK 
studies WP08 and WP09 which were conducted using both the 0.25 mg and 1 mg ODMT depending on 
the required dose. Data extracted from the reports, for Cmax and AUC for enalapril for occasions 
where only the 0.25 mg or 1 mg strength was used, show that the rate and extent of absorption is 
proportional between strengths even if there is a wide variability.
- Neither of the ODMT formulations (0.25 mg and 1 mg) include excipients that might affect 
bioavailability. The qualitative compositions are very similar hence it is highly unlikely that these 
excipients at the quantities present would have a clinical impact on drug release or bioavailability. 
Based on the above-mentioned grounds and following recommendations from the Guideline on the 
Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr **), a BCS-based biowaiver 
was claimed by the applicant.

Methods

Study design 
This was an open label, single dose randomized 3-way crossover, 3-treatment, 3-period study. 
Twenty-four (24) healthy male and female subjects were planned to be enrolled and each administered 
a 10 mg enalapril dose on 3 occasions, at least one week apart, as follows:



Treatment A: 2 x 5mg of Renitec®, swallowed with 240ml of water (fasting);
Treatment B: 10 x 1mg of ODMT, swallowed with 240ml of water (fasting);
Treatment C: 10 x 1mg of ODMT, dispersed on the tongue following wetting of the mouth with 
20ml of water (fasting).
Blood samples (2.7 ml each) will be collected in serum tubes at predose and 10min, 20min, 30min, 
45min and at 1h, 1.25h, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hrs postdose 
This was an open study. No blinding procedures apply, but the bioanalysis was conducted blinded.

Population(s) studied
No a-priori-sample size calculation was done. The sample size was 24 healthy subjects in groups of 4 
subjects per treatment sequence.
Adult healthy non-smoking male and female subjects, 18-55 years old, with a BMI between 18.5 and 
30 kg/m2 inclusive. Women of childbearing potential had to agree to practice a highly effective method 
of birth control from screening until at least to the end of study visit.
Overall, 24 (100%) subjects were enrolled in this study. All 24 subjects received treatments B and C. 
Twenty-three (23, 95.8%) subjects received treatment A and was excluded from analysis.
 Analytical methods  
The same bioanalytical method is the same as in WP07 and has been used for both WP08 and WP 09.
Essential features: 
For determination of the PK of enalapril and its active metabolite enalaprilat, liquid chromatography- 
triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry followed by solid-phase extraction of serum samples was 
applied (Shimadzu HPLC 10 coupled with AB Sciex API 2000 mass spectrometer). The ion transitions 
were mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) 377.2 to 234.2 m/z for enalapril, 349.1 to 206.1 m/z for enalaprilat 
and 425.3 m/z to 351.2 m/z for the internal standard benazepril. Moreover, the applied bioanalytical 
method was characterized by a small sample volume of 50 μL serum encompassing a calibration range 
from 0.195 – 200 ng/mL for enalapril and 0.180 – 180 ng/mL for enalaprilat. 
The method was fully validated according to EMA and FDA bioanalytical method validation guidelines 
by using European Pharmacopoeia Reference Standard of enalapril and enalaprilat. Obtained mean 
accuracy values for enalapril ranged from 92.1% to 108.4% of the nominal concentration at the lower 
limit of quantification (LLOQ), from 91.6% to 100.2% at the low concentration level, from 94.3% to 
100.4% at the medium level and from 92.6% to 98% at the upper limit of quantification (ULOQ). The 
time different intermediate precision varied between 5.0 to 9.5% across all concentration levels and 
was subsequently well within the guideline limits of ±15% (±20% at LLOQ). Regarding the active 
metabolite enalaprilat, the mean accuracy values ranged as follows: At the LLOQ the mean accuracy 
ranged from 88.0% to 105.5%, at the low concentration level the mean accuracy ranged from 90.2% 
to 98.8%, at the medium level from 94.0% to 100.9% and from 93.2% to 106.4% at the ULOQ. Study 
samples measured below the LLOQ were set to 0 while samples above the ULOQ were re-measured as 
dilution.

To compare and evaluate the relative bioavailability of enalapril and enalaprilat after 
the single oral administration of the previously mentioned treatments (A, B, and C), 
the geometric mean ratios of each pair and the 90% confidence intervals of these 
ratios will be calculated for AUC0-tz and Cmax. 
An analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be performed on the natural logarithmic 
transformed Cmax, AUC0-tz, and AUC0-∞ and will include treatment, period, and 
sequence as fixed effects, and subject nested within sequence as random effect. The 
obtained confidence interval limits will be backtransformed via antilog.

Study WP08 and WP09
The primary objective of Studies WP08 and WP09 was to obtain paediatric pharmacokinetic data of 
enalapril and its active metabolite enalaprilat in paediatric patients treated with enalapril ODMTs. This 
data described the dose exposure in the paediatric population with heart failure due to DCM and CHD. 
The primary endpoint, bioavailability of enalapril and enalaprilat in children (0 month - <12 years) 
(AUC from 0 to time of last sampling point, Cmax and tmax), was investigated using descriptive 
pharmacokinetics. 
To explore the age dependency of the enalapril exposure, the bioavailability of enalapril and its active 
metabolite enalaprilat was furthermore descriptively described in the different age subsets (birth to 
less than 12 months, 12 months to less than 6 years, 6 years to less than 12 years) of the paediatric 
population (AUC from 0 to time of last sampling point, Cmax and tmax).


Study design 
This was a multi-centre, multi-national Phase II/III prospective, open-label, single and multiple dose 
PK bridging study with exploratory PD assessments in paediatric patients with DCM requiring ACE 
inhibitor treatment. The study was initiated in 8 sites in The Netherlands, Austria, Hungary, UK, 
Germany and Serbia. Two groups of children (ACEI pre-treated and treatment naïve children) with 
heart failure due to DCM were treated with enalapril ODMTs over a period of 8 weeks with the 
maximum tolerated dose following a defined dose titration scheme.

Population(s) studied
A minimum of 50 patients was originally planned to be enrolled in this trial. According to a modification 
to the PIP agreed by the PDCO, this number was changed to 25 patients in Substantial Amendment 
No. 2. Eligible were all male and female children (1 month - ˂12 years) with the diagnosis of heart 
failure secondary to DCM. Inclusion of (amended) sub-sets of patients was envisaged as follows:


A minimum of 10 infants (1 month to less than 12 months, increased from originally 8)
A  minimum  of  8  patients  aged  12  months  to  less  than  6  years  (decreased  from  originally  18 
patients).

Methods
Study design 
This was a multi-centre, multi-national Phase II/III prospective, open-label, single and multiple dose 
pharmacokinetic bridging study with exploratory pharmacodynamic assessments in paediatric patients 
with CHD requiring ACE inhibitor treatment. The study was initiated in 8 sites in The Netherlands, 
Austria, Hungary, UK, Germany and Serbia. Two groups of children (ACEI pre-treated and treatment-
naïve children) with heart failure due to CHD were treated with enalapril ODMTs over a period of 8 
weeks with the maximum tolerated dose following a defined dose titration scheme.

Population(s) studied
Number of patients (planned and analysed):
A minimum of 50 patients were originally planned to be enrolled. In accordance with an agreed 
Request for Modification of an approved PIP, this was increased to a minimum of 60 evaluable patients 
for the primary endpoint (full PK). Up to 15 additional patients were permitted to be enrolled to ensure 
sufficient evaluable patients.
Common features of studies WP08 and WP09
 Analytical methods  
The same bioanalytical method is the same as in WP07 and has been used for both WP08 and WP 09.

Pharmacokinetic Variables
The same pharmacokinetic data analysis was used for both WP08 and WP 09.
The bioavailability of enalapril and its active metabolite enalaprilat in young children (1 month to ˂ 12 
years) was determined using descriptive PK investigations of area under the curve (AUC) from 0 to 
time of last sampling point and maximal concentration (Cmax) as well as time to maximal 
concentrations (tmax). This primary endpoint was depicted to obtain paediatric PK data of enalapril 
and its active metabolite enalaprilat in patients treated with enalapril ODMTs to describe the dose 
exposure in the paediatric population with DCM.
Separate NCA analyses were conducted for naïve patients and those pre-treated with ACE inhibitors, 
where a full serum profile was performed at the initial dose visit and at steady-state respectively. 
steady state for pre-treated patients was defined as treatment with the ODMTs for more than 7 days 
after the patient had been switched from their ACE inhibitor pre-treatment to the study treatment. A 
full serum profile for naïve patients at the initial dose visit consisted of 6 serum samples taken at 0h 
(pre-dose) and at 1h, 2h, 4h, 6h, and 12h after the administration of the dose. A full sampling profile 
Assessment report 
EMA/481595/2023 
Page 31/85
for patients taken at steady state dosing consisted of 5 serum samples taken at 0h, 1h, 2h, 4h and 6h. 
With twice daily dosing, the sample taken before dosing (trough) could be used as the 12h sample.
PK parameters Cmax, tmax, and AUC were calculated by non-compartmental procedures where the 
following abbreviations were defined:

Furthermore, parameters of non-compartmental PK were normalized by dose as well as body weight 
with abbreviations such as Cmax,ss,norm for Cmax,ss and AUCss,norm for AUCtau,ss. PK data analysis 
was conducted at the Institute of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacotherapy, Heinrich-Heine Universität 
Düsseldorf, Germany.

Statistical methods 
The same statistical methods were used for both WP08 and WP09, for the age groups as indicated 
below.
Primary endpoints
Pharmacokinetics: The bioavailability of enalapril and its active metabolite enalaprilat in children (1 
month - < 12 years) (AUC from 0 to time of last sampling point, Cmax and tmax); descriptive 
pharmacokinetic investigation.
Secondary endpoint analysis of pharmacokinetics
To determine the secondary endpoint (bioavailability of enalapril and its active metabolite enalaprilat in 
the different age subsets) the dose and weight normalized AUCtau, Cmax,ss and tmax,ss of enalapril 
and enalaprilat were compared between the age subsets 
- WP 08 (age group 1, 1 to ˂12 months, age group 2, 12 months to ˂6 years and age group 3, 6 years 
to >12 years); 
- WP 09 (age group 1; 1 to ˂12 months, age group 2; 12 months to ˂6 years and age group 3; 6 years 
to >12 years). 
Based on this, the relative bioavailability of the ODMTs as comparison drug exposure (AUC) and rate 
and extend of absorption (Cmax and tmax) within the given age cohorts of paediatric patients were 
calculated. In addition, weight and dose normalized AUCtau,ss, Cmax, ss and tmax, ss) were 
compared between the different age subsets using statistical testing for two group comparison (t-
test(x~y) for two samples).
Population pharmacokinetic analysis
In addition to the non-compartmental analysis of the full PK profiles, population PK modelling was 
performed on collected PK and PD data from the start to the end of the study. A covariate analysis was 
Assessment report 
EMA/481595/2023

performed to investigate sources of variability of the resultant dose exposure relationship, and 
covariates were included from various patient characteristics collected in this study such as sex, age, 
weight, height, disease score, GFR, aetiology of disease and further relevant covariates, which are 
listed in the flow charts of the study. 
To maximise the value of the PK/PD data, the analysis was performed on the complete paediatric HF 
data set from the PK/PD Study in CHD or DCM patients Protocol Nr. 2015-602295-02, EudraCT Nr. 
2015- 002396-18 (WP09) and Safety Study Protocol Nr. 2015-602295-03, EudraCT Nr. 2015- 002397-
21 (WP10) in addition to this study, using a non-linear mixed-effects modelling approach. The final 
model was then used to calculate PK parameters such as AUCtau,ss, and Cmax,ss to support the 
recommended doses of enalapril in patients by simulating dose recommendations for enalapril ODMTs.

Safety data
Adverse Events
WP08
The administered enalapril ODMT doses were well tolerated. Eleven (34.5%) patients did not experience 
any AEs during their study participation. Forty-two AEs occurred in 21 of the 32 (65.6%) patients enrolled 
into this study. Most frequently observed AEs were pyrexia in 4 patients (12.5%), nasopharyngitis and 
rash in 3 children each (9.4%). 1 SAE (syncope due to hypotension in the context of a gastro-intestinal 
infection and hospitalisation for observational purposes), unrelated to IMP intake, was reported.
No deaths occurred. No rehospitalisation due to heart failure including the need for heart transplantation 
or the institution of mechanical circulatory support occurred.
WP09
The  administered  enalapril  ODMT  doses  were  well  tolerated.  Eighteen  (25.7%)  patients  did  not 
experience any AE during their study participation. In 52 of the 70 (74.3%) patients enrolled into this 
study 118 AEs occurred. Only 7 AEs (5.9%), were assessed as possibly, probably or certainly related 
with IMP intake. Eight (6.8%) AEs were of severe intensity, 32 (27.1%) AEs were of moderate intensity 
and  78  AEs  (66.1%)  of  mild  intensity.  Most  frequently  observed  AEs  were  cardiac  operation  (15 
AEs,12.7%), pyrexia (14 AEs, 11.9%), and rhinitis (9 AEs, 7.6%). All other AEs described below occurred 
less frequently. Five SAEs without causal relationship with the IMP occurred; all but one (paresis right 
hemidiaphragma after cardiac surgery) resolved without sequela. No deaths occurred.

Secondary endpoint
WP08
For  enalapril,  the  bioavailability  concerning  the  rate  and  extent  of  exposure  is  shown  below  and  this 
indicates a lower bioavailability of enalapril in infants compared to older age groups.

For enalaprilat, the bioavailability concerning the rate and extent of exposure is shown below and this 
indicates  a  lower  bioavailability  of  enalaprilat  in  infants  compared  to  older  age  groups.  The  relative 
bioavailability of enalapril and enalaprilat according to age group is shown in Figure 8.
The comparisons of the bioavailability for enalapril and enalaprilat between age groups indicate a lower 
rate and extent of exposure in infants compared to older children with DCM. It has to be noted that the

number of patients in the age subsets is small (n=6 to n=11). Therefore, a population PK analysis was 
performed  with  the  combined  patient  cohort  of  paediatric  heart  failure  patients  due  to  DCM  and  CHD 
(WP09) (section 16) and will lead to dosing recommendations based on the PK exposition in combination 
with the PD results.
WP09
The  bioavailability  of  enalapril  and  its  active  metabolite  enalaprilat  in  the  different  age  subsets  (age 
group 1 (AG1) 0 to ˂12 months and age group 2 (AG2) 12 months to ˂6 years) of the paediatric study 
population  (AUCtau,  Cmax  and  t-max)  were  described.  Based  on  the  median  of  the  age  groups,  the 
relative  bioavailability  of  PK  parameters  AUCtau,ss,norm  and  Cmax,  ss  according  to  age  groups  of 
enalapril (ENA) and enalaprilat (ENAAT) were calculated and are provided in Tables below.
The bioavailability of enalapril indicates a lower rate of exposure in the young age group compared to 
the older age group (54% in age group 2 compared to age group 1).
It should be noted that the number of patients in age group 2 is small (n=7) compared to age group 1 
(n=56).  Furthermore,  by  combining  all  patients  below  one  year  together,  age  dependent  differences 
between neonates and young and older infants can be masked.
Therefore, a population PK analysis was performed with the combined patient cohort of paediatric HF 
patients due to DCM and CHD and will lead based on the PK exposition in combination with the PD results.
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics
Mechanism of action
After oral administration in adults, enalapril is hydrolysed via hepatic carboxylesterase (CES) 1 to the 
Assessment report 
EMA/481595/2023 
Page 36/85
active metabolite enalaprilat, which acts as an ACE inhibitor. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase which 
catalyses the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance angiotensin II and hence 
inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II. This also leads to increased plasma renin 
activity (due to removal of negative feedback of renin release), and decreased aldosterone secretion. 
The mechanism of action of enalapril is therefore primarily via the suppression of the RAAS. However, 
ACE is identical to kininase II, and so enalapril may also exert its effects by blocking the degradation of 
bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology
Exploratory pharmacodynamics for brain natriuretic peptides (Nt-proBNP), shortening fraction and 
RAAS associated with enalapril orodispersible tablets in children with heart failure were studied in two 
clinical studies; 32 children aged 1 month to <12 years with heart failure due to dilated 
cardiomyopathy (DCM) (WP08) and 70 children aged birth to 6 years with heart failure due to 
congenital heart disease (CHD) (WP09): mean age 555 days, mean weight 8.92 kg and height 
74.01 cm; 46% were females and 54% were males. The data are presented below.
In children with DCM, Nt-proBNP median values (range) did not change from 32 (5 to 1 777) pmol/L at 
the start to 35 (3 to 1 302) pmol/L (p=ns) at the end of the study. Only 10% of patients in this cohort 
were ACEi naïve. In children with CHD, Nt-proBNP levels were lower at the end of the study compared 
to the beginning. The median Nt-proBNP value at the start of the study were 171 (1 to 2 789) pmol/L 
and 73 (5 to 2 165) pmol/L (p=ns) at the end. In this cohort 44% of patients were naïve to ACEi 
treatment. 
In patients with DCM, echocardiography (shortening fraction) mean values (±SD)) slightly, but 
significantly increased in all patients from 22.3% (SD 7.3) to 25.1% (SD 7.8) (p < 0.05, t-test) 
reflecting an improvement of the cardiac conditions of the patients in all age groups. In patients with 
CHD, shortening fraction remained almost the same during the study period. Mean values (±SD) at the 
screening and end of study visits were 38.7% (SD 8.6) and 38.5% (SD 6.2), respectively.
In terms of effects on the RAAS, renin, plasma renin activity and angiotensin I, all increased at the end 
of the two studies compared to pre-dose values. Aldosterone concentrations decreased at 4 hours after 
administration of enalapril orodispersible tablets as well as at the end of the study. The observed 
changes were unlikely to be a consequence of the natural course of disease or maturation-dependent 
changes of the RAAS system. A comparable trend for the four parameters of the RAAS system was 
observed in ACEi naïve and ACEi pre-treated cohorts, with the main difference being in the baseline 
pre-dose values. The observed changes in markers of the RAAS during the course of enalapril 
orodispersible tablets treatment lie within the expected pattern of ACE inhibition.
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology
To support the application, the applicant has submitted one bioequivalence study, two 
pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic studies, no therapeutic equivalence studies. 
In congenital heart diseases (CHD) the child’s heart is subject to volume overload that is accompanied 
by the initial signs of congestion such as increased ventricle thickness as a compensatory response. 
Enalapril is used to treat these patients prior to closure of the left-right shunts since the clinical picture 
correlates with the cardiac situation in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). After surgery, enalapril 
treatment may still be used in a small proportion of patients in whom the shunt may not be adequately 
closed, prior to repeat surgery. This patient group has been neglected until now. However, since the 
LENA trials addressed this situation, therapeutic options available to this group have opened up. This 
Assessment report 
EMA/481595/2023 
Page 37/85
group included mainly young infants and neonates, expanding the age range in which enalapril ODMTs 
were studied.
The design of the enalapril ODMT study in children with CHD and HF (WP09) had the same goals and 
design as that described for the enalapril ODMT study in children with DCM and HF (WP08). The 
studies were performed as part of an agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) and hence all criteria 
were discussed and agreed upon by the EMA Paediatric Committee (PDCO) in addition to local 
regulatory agencies and Ethics Committees. 
All paediatric clinical trials were performed between January 2016 and July 2018 in 7 investigational 
sites in The Netherlands, Austria, Hungary, Germany and Serbia. It is of note, that the PDCO 
recommendation had an impact on the age range investigated. The investigation for the paediatric 
cohort with heart failure from aged 1 month to below 12 years of age consisted of patients with dilated 
cardiomyopathy (DCM; WP08) and patients from birth to below 6 years of age in patients with 
congenital heart diseases (CHD; WP09). In the agreed PIP the PDCO agreed not to include adolescents 
into the WP8 and WP9 studies but rather to substitute the age range from 12 to 17 years with a 
modelling and simulation exercise to delineate dosing. With this approach the whole patient age range 
was covered.
Pharmacokinetics
The report on population pharmacokinetics was provided on request during the procedure. The Report 
supported the data and conclusions of the PK study WP07. The main PK analysis performed was based 
on a non-compartmental (NCA) evaluation of the PK data from the clinical trials (Laeer, 2022). This 
approach allowed comparison of relevant PK metrics across age groups as well as with adults. The 
population PK analysis was used to complement the NCA. This was endorsed by the CHMP. 
A major objection regarding a biowaiver for the 0.25 mg strength was raised during the assessment. A 
biowaiver for the 0.25mg strength, based on the bioequivalence established for the 1.0 mg strength, 
could be viewed from two perspectives: (1) as an additional strength biowaiver, meaning that the 
application contains enough information to meet the requirements in the BE guideline, except for the 
proportionality of the ratio of the amount of excipients to the active, and pharmacokinetic linearity not 
yet being demonstrated and different manufacturing processes for the two strengths, which needed a 
thorough justification; and (2) it is stated that enalapril is a BCS class III drug substance; however, in 
order to accept a BCS based biowaiver, there was a lack of an appropriate reference comparator. Even 
if the CHMP would accept Renitec 1.0 mg as a comparator, the BCS class III based biowaiver requires 
same qualitative composition and that no critical excipients (eg, mannitol) are present. This 
requirement was not met and the applicant was requested to provide an appropriate justification. 
Alternatively, the applicant was asked to justify that further data are not needed for the 0.25 mg 
strength, in particular taking into account the data with this strength from the clinical studies in 
children (W08 and 09). In the response provided the applicant stated that the pharmacokinetic 
evaluation of enalapril and its active metabolite enalaprilat in paediatric patients treated with enalapril 
ODMTs (either 0.25 mg or 1 mg) was the primary objective of the clinical studies WP08 and WP09. 
Dose was titrated to the effect by the clinicians using both strengths. In addition, the pharmacokinetic 
studies WP08 and WP09 showed that the dose corrected AUC and Cmax (in paediatric patients 
receiving, as a first dose, 0.25 mg or 1 mg ODMTs) are proportional for both strengths of enalapril 
ODMTs within the acceptable limit of ±25% described in the Guideline on the Investigation of 
Bioequivalence for immediate release drug products (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr**). 
Therefore, it was agreed that further data was not needed for the 0.25 mg strength. 
Pharmacodynamics
Assessment report 
EMA/481595/2023 
Page 38/85
The applicant presented data regarding the effect of enalapril in secondary pharmacodynamics (PD) 
endpoints on studies WP08, WP09 and WP10. Some of the PD endpoints studied were related to the 
mechanism of action of enalapril and aimed to support the effect of enalapril on the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone axis (RAA). The endpoints studied were: renin levels, plasma renin activity, angiontensin 1 
levels and aldosterone levels.
In studies WP08 and WP09 the study population included both ACEI-naïve subjects and subjects 
already on ACEI willing to switch to enalapril ODMTs.
The number of ACE-inhibitor naïve patients, however, was low (n=3) with one patient below 12 
months of age and two patients between 1 year and 6 years of age. The applicant stated that it can be 
expected that renin levels are higher in ACEI-treated subjects, related to the inhibition of ACE and of a 
positive feedback upstream of the RAA axis, which is clearly supported by the literature. However, 
when analysing the ACEI-group of WP08 (excluding the 3 ACEI-naïve subjects), and also the ACEI-
group (non-naïve) of study WP09, the renin levels were lower at the End of Study Visit (mean 662.5 
pg/mL vs 1992 pg/mL) although plasma renin activity was higher. The applicant has discussed these 
results. Apart from the expected effect of enalapril on the RAAS system, it has been reported that age 
dependent changes and the natural course of the disease can interact with the RAAS system and renin 
and plasma renin activity are decreased with increasing age. The small sample size in some age groups 
and the absence of a control group can also have an impact on the interpretation of the generated 
exploratory efficacy/PD data presented in the applicant’s response. Although, qualitatively, the PD 
results in RAA markers general can be expected mechanistically and are supported by evidence, there 
was a lack of rational regarding the translation of its clinical significance in terms of dose/exposure of 
enalapril and magnitude of aldosterone reduction (and elevation of renin, angiotensin I) when 
compared to what is described in adults. Additionally, the PK/PD relationship results presented by the 
applicant were not satisfactory in providing a PK/PD bridging. The applicant was asked to present data 
would allow for translation of the magnitude of effect on the RAA markers. The applicant presented the 
requested data, but also stated that generating more data to allow translation of the magnitude of 
effect on the RAA markers is not considered feasible due to both constraints in paediatric research and 
the difficulties in defining and justifying the inclusion of a control arm in children which are in clear 
need of treatment.
Given the observed high values of angiotensin I as well as renin and plasma renin activity after 
enalapril treatment, a question was posed regarding the quantification of angiotensin II. Knowing that 
high angiotensin I levels can lead to angiotensin II conversion by non-ACE pathways, the applicant was 
asked why angiotensin II was not considered as RAA marker along with aldosterone given the more 
relevant role of angiotensin II in cardiac remodelling mechanisms. The applicant responded, that 
considering the role of angiotensin II in cardiac remodelling mechanisms, data related to the effect of 
enalapril on angiotensin II could have provided some additional information on the pharmacodynamic 
effects of enalapril in the paediatric population with heart failure. However, this endpoint was not 
included in the WP08 and WP09 studies. The goal of the clinical development was to confirm the initial 
dose exposure equivalence to the adult starting doses, with the new paediatric ODMT.
The PD results from studies WP08, WP09 and WP10 were upon request from the CHMP included in 
section 5.1, under “Pharmacodynamic effects”. 
The applicant has presented data regarding two PD markers (other than the mechanistic PD markers 
related to RAA inhibition): effect on Nt-proBNP levels and on the Shortening Fraction by 
Echocardiography.
The absence of a control group prevented the observation of a relation between enalapril 
administration and a positive effect on the pharmacodynamic biomarkers chosen, limiting the 
establishment of a primary pharmacodynamic effect.
Assessment report 
EMA/481595/2023 
Page 39/85
Echocardiography
On study WP08, the echocardiographic analysis shows a slight increase in the shortening fraction (SF) 
in the “End of Study Visit” although a relation to ACEI cannot be performed due to possible bias with 
the natural disease progression. Additionally, analysis by age groups show (Initial Dose Visit vs End of 
Study Visit): an absence of effect for the lowest age group (under 1 y.o.), represented by 20.3% (15.9 
– 26%) vs 21.1% (15.6 – 26%); a significant effect for the medium age group (1-6 y.o.), represented 
by 22.8% (17.8 – 26.9%) vs 28.6% (24 – 31.8); and a decrease on SF on the top age group (6 -12 
y.o.), represented by 24.9% (18.3 – 29.8%) vs 22.3% (15 – 29%). Although the third age group is 
associated with a lower subject number when compared to the lowest age group for example (5-6 vs 
9-12 subjects), the standard deviation for both groups is not as different (7-8 for the lowest age group 
vs 8.3-8.9 for the highest age group).
This is line what was observed in study WP09, where none of the age groups were found to have 
statistical differences.
In study WP08, the evaluation of PD outcomes Nt-proBNP and echocardiography showed that the 
differences between the results of the Initial Visit and End of Study Visit are clearer in the 1-6 age 
groups, with an absence of statistical significance on the other age groups. On study WP09 no 
statistical difference was observed in any age group when comparing echocardiography results. 
Although Nt-proBNP results from study WP09 were statistically significant in the two age groups 
evaluated, clinical guidelines and scientific literature have devalued Nt-proBNP as biomarkers for 
treatment efficacy, recommending instead their use for the diagnosis stage and as heart failure 
exclusion criteria. Given the scarcity of pharmacodynamic evidence generated in these studies, the 
applicant was asked to justify the extrapolation amongst the different age groups. In response the 
applicant stated that the definition of paediatric doses per age group is based on PK data targeting a 
similar intial exposure in paediatric patients as in adults because the expected effect of ACEi is similar 
in adults and children. Extrapolation between age groups is based on pharmacokinetic considerations. 
The PD data collection was intended for exploratory purposes. The highly heterogenous population of 
cardiovascular paediatric patients and the limited sample size for which PD data is available do not 
allow to draw conclusions based on the generated pharmacodynamic evidence. The high variability of 
the PD observations does not allow to conclude if differences between age groups are related to 
differences in growth and maturation on the PD endpoint or just related to variability in the age groups 
associated to sample size limitations.
Although some literature exists regarding the beneficial effect of ACEI in paediatric heart failure, many 
questions remain regarding the magnitude of the beneficial effect regarding different age groups. The 
applicant was asked to discuss the effect of enalapril on heart failure biomarkers according to different 
age groups and also according to disease severity in paediatrics. In the response provided the 
applicant argued that in adults enalapril has a positive effect on heart-failure parameters beyond its 
BP-lowering effect. This effect is less apparent in the paediatric population, in which studies show 
conflicting results. The studies in the LENA work packages were designed to determine the PK profiles 
of enalapril ODMT and any PD endpoints were exploratory in nature. As such, no specific determinants 
can be made regarding the effect of enalapril on heart failure biomarkers according to different age 
groups and also according to disease severity in paediatrics. 
The applicant has not initially provided clinical data related to hyperkalemia incidence nor addressed 
the relevance of hyperkalemia in the paediatric population although the available literature points out 
renal impairment, hypotension and hyperkalemia as common adverse reactions in children. The 
applicant was asked to discuss the potential for hyperkalemia in the paediatric population and any 
variability in the several age groups. The applicant provided a discussion on hyperkalaemia based on 
literature data and this point is adequately addressed in the agreed SmPC. 
Assessment report 
EMA/481595/2023 
Page 40/85
The applicant addressed the known information specific to enalapril PD interactions in the paediatric 
age range, highlighting the relevant role of potassium supplements, with the data that interaction of 
enalapril with potassium chloride is within the top five drug-drug interactions that are most frequently 
observed in a paediatric hospital. Additionally, the applicant indicated that coadministration of 
furosemide is an independent risk factor for developing acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients.
Taking into consideration the variability of the RAA axis activation throughout the paediatric age range 
and the known variability in the plasma levels of renin and aldosterone in individuals of African 
ancestry, the applicant presented as well the pharmacodynamic effect of enalapril in this specific 
paediatric population.
The applicant has initially failed to present a clear relationship between the pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamic profiles. Although the applicant has cited some publications that give some PK/PD 
support, they are generally limited to studies with a small population and of limited age span, not 
allowing for a complete extrapolation to all of the paediatric age range. There are however other 
studies that point out the existence of conflicting results, mainly related to the variability of the RAA 
axis activation throughout the paediatric age range.
The applicant was asked to elaborate, discuss and provide stronger support on the extrapolation of 
results to all age sub-groups within the paediatric range. Several publications have shown that 
activation of RAA axis varies significantly along the paediatric age range and issues remain 
controversial in the PK/PD relationship depending on the paediatric age, not only on pure 
pharmacodynamic markers, but also on more clinically PD/efficacy biomarkers. In response provided 
the applicant admitted that taking into account the heterogeneity of paediatric heart failure and the 
diversity of the study population (age, naïve vs. non naïve patients, etc.) and considering the 
exploratory nature of the pharmacodynamic and efficacy endpoints used in the applicant’s WP08 and 
WP09 studies, a clear conclusion on the extrapolation of results to all age sub-groups within the 
paediatric age range could not be drawn. However, enalapril is considered to be a first-line treatment 
for chronic heart failure in children and has been extensively used off-label for decades in this patient 
population. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology
The CHMP considered application approvable from clinical pharmacology point of view. 
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy
This application relies in part on the results of pre-clinical tests and clinical trials for the reference 
product (Renitec®) enalapril maleate tablets and in part on new clinical data.
New clinical studies were done in the frame of LENA project. The LENA project generated core scientific 
data out of the four clinical trials WP07, WP08, WP09 and WP10. WP07 generated clinical data for 
enalapril orodispersible mini-tablets (ODMTs) in healthy volunteers. WP08, WP09 and WP10 generated 
clinical data for enalapril ODMTs in children with heart failure.

This was a multi-centre, multi-national Phase II/III prospective, open-label, single and multiple dose PK 
bridging study with exploratory PD assessments in paediatric patients with Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM) 
requiring ACE inhibitor treatment. The study was initiated in 8 sites in The Netherlands, Austria, Hungary, 
UK, Germany and Serbia. Two groups of children (ACEI pre-treated and treatment-naïve children) with 
heart failure due to DCM were treated with enalapril Orodispersible Minitablets (ODMTs) over a period of 
8 weeks with the maximum tolerated dose following a defined dose titration scheme. 
Primary endpoints WP08 
Pharmacokinetic: The bioavailability of enalapril and its active metabolite enalaprilat in children (1 month 
- < 12 years) (AUC from 0 to time of last sampling point, Cmax and tmax); descriptive pharmacokinetic 
investigation (– this section is discussed under PK part).
Secondary endpoints WP08 
Bioavailability by age group – this study is discussed under PK and safety part of AR only a short summary 
is given here.
Markers of the RAAS
The  investigated  4  parameters  of  the  RAAS  system  (Renin,  Angiotensin  I,  Aldosterone,  Plasma  Renin 
Activity)  showed  a  trend  that  the  RAAS  markers  changed  in  the  patient  cohort  during  the  course  of 
enalapril ODMT administration in the expected pattern of ACE inhibition. Statistical testing, however, was 
precluded as only three ACEI pre-treatment naïve patients were entered into this trial.

Brain Natriuretic Peptides (BNP)
In the whole paediatric patient cohort Nt-proBNP values did not change in median values from 32 pmol/L 
before to 35 pmol/L at the end of the study. Patients demonstrated a high variability in Nt- proBNP values 
with minimum and maximum values of 5 to 1777 pmol/L before enalapril ODMT treatment compared to 
3 to 1302 pmol/L at the end of the study.
Shortening Fraction
Shortening  fraction  slightly,  but  significantly  increased  in  all  patients  from  22.3±7.3%  to  25.1±7.8% 
(p<0.05) reflecting an improvement of the cardiac conditions of the patients in all age groups. Although 
an effect of ACEI could not be excluded, this could also be explained by the natural course of the disease.
Acceptability, Palatability
Acceptability of the 1 mg and the 0.25 mg enalapril ODMTs administered as single or multiple ODMTs up 
to 10 per dose, was 100% in all age groups. The same was true for swallowability with the exception of 
the 6 months to 5 years age group where swallowability was still high at 84.7%. Palatability was rated 
either as “positive” or “neutral” in patients of 1 month to 5 years of age. Older patient palatability ratings 
for taste, size of ODMT and ease of swallowing were rated more variably but in nearly all cases as “very 
good”, “good or “not sure”.

Statistical methods
For the safety endpoints (vital parameters, renal function, adverse events, rehospitalisation and death) 
and  the  other  secondary  endpoints  (RAA-markers,  echocardiography,  acceptability  and  palatability) 
descriptive statistics for the intention to treat (ITT) and the per protocol (PP) population have been done. 
These included the number of observations (N), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, min, max, 1st 
quartile  and  3rd  quartile  (where  indicated).  In  addition,  exploratory  pharmacodynamic  and 
pharmacokinetic analyses have been done for hypothesis generating purposes using Wilcoxon test and 
t-Test. Although these studies were not designed and powered to provide confirmation of efficacy, these

Study WP10
Follow-up Safety trial in children with chronic Heart Failure therapy receiving Orodispersible 
Minitablets of Enalapril (86 paediatric patients) 
Protocol Number 2015-602295-03 
Clinical Phase 2/3 
EudraCT Number 2015-002397-21
The Primary Objective of this study was the assessment of safety.
The Secondary Objectives:



To describe the acceptability and palatability of enalapril ODMTs.
To  collect  additional  information  about  pharmacokinetics  and  pharmacodynamics  of  enalapril 
ODMTs during long term treatment
NT-proBNP values
WP10  contained  a  Phase  II/III  prospective,  open-label,  safety  follow-up  study  in  infants  and  children 
enrolled in the trials 2015-602295-01 (WP08) and 2015-602295-02 (WP09) under stable optimal dose 
or no longer under enalapril ODMT treatment, with exploratory pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic 
assessments in children under IMP treatment.
Patients  in  the  previous  WP8  and  WP9  trials  were  up-titrated  under  close  clinical  observation  to  an 
optimal  dose  and  maintained  this  dose  for  the  remaining  duration  of  2  months  in  these  LENA  trials. 
Patients  who  had  completed  this  treatment  period  under  enalapril  ODMT  treatment  those  who  had 
received enalapril ODMTs for at least 3 days but had stopped, were invited to join the open long-term 
observation safety study “WP10” for an additional 10 months. Of the 102 patients enrolled in WP08 and 
WP09 trials 86 continued into the WP10 trial.
Number of patients
All  patients  from  the  previous  LENA  trials  (WP08  and  WP09)  trials  who  received  at  least  three  days 
treatment with enalapril ODMT, were asked to participate in the study conducted in WP10 (originally it 
was planned to enroll at least 100 patients however this was reduced to at least 85 patients following an 
agreed Request for Modification of an approved PIP). A minimum of 40 patients recruited as neonates or 
infants in WP08 and WP09 were planned to be enrolled, with at least 10 patients in each of the following 
age subsets at time of enrolment into WP08 or WP09; 0-˂3 months, 3-˂6 months and 6-˂12 month (see 
Table below).

Results
In the cohort of children that were included in WP08 and WP09, half were already on ACEI and in most 
of them the enalapril-ODMTs were not up-titrated after inclusion. Thus, the effects of increasing doses 
of ACEI on pharmacodynamic parameters could not be reliably estimated. Pharmacodynamic and safety 
parameters were analysed in a descriptive fashion as secondary endpoints. For the following parameters, 
statistical comparisons before and after the end of the study or between age groups were performed (t-
test or Wilcoxon test).
Echocardiography (Shortening Fraction)
Assessment report 
EMA/481595/2023 
Page 46/85
In  patients  with  dilated  cardiomyopathy  (WP08),  shortening  fraction  (SF)  slightly,  but  significantly 
increased in all patients from 22.3±7.3% to 25.1±7.8% (p<0.05, t-test) reflecting an improvement of 
the cardiac conditions of the patients in all age groups (see figure below). Although an effect of ACEI 
could not be excluded, this could also be explained by the natural course of the disease.
In patients with congenital heart disease (WP09), SF remained almost the same during the trial period, 
which was expected from the aetiology of the disease. Mean value at the Screening Visit was 38.7% and 
mean value at the End of Study Visit was 38.5%.
RAAS
The  investigated  4  parameters  of  the  RAAS  system  (renin,  angiotensin  I,  aldosterone,  plasma  renin 
activity)  supported  the  probability  that  the  administration  of  the  enalapril  ODMT  was  related  to  the 
changes seen in the RAAS parameters. A comparable trend for the 4 parameters of the RAAS system 
was  observed  in  ACEI  naïve  and  ACEI  pre-treated  cohorts,  with  the  main  difference  residing  in  the 
baseline pre-dose values. 
Figure : Shortening fraction in WP08 (black boxplots and bars) and WP09 patients (grey boxplots and 
bars) in patients pre-treated or naive to ACEI. T-test with p<0.05 indicate significant improvement in 
shortening fraction of pre-treated WP08 patients
These  observations  are  in  line  with  expected  changes  in  the  RAAS  system  related  to  ACE  inhibition. 
Enalaprilat as the active metabolite of enalapril inhibits the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and 
reduces  the  formation  of  angiotensin  II  as  well  as  aldosterone.  Lower  angiotensin  II  concentrations 
reduce the negative feedback for renin and increases renin concentrations. Hence, plasma renin activity 
increases  as  well  as  angiotensin  I  concentrations.  In  summary,  due  to  ACE  inhibition,  lower 
concentrations of aldosterone and higher concentrations of renin, plasma renin activity and angiotensin 
I would be expected.
All markers of the RAAS were measured in this patient cohort. The observed changes in markers of the 
RAAS during the course of enalapril ODMT treatment lies within the expected pattern of ACE inhibition.
The statement that RAAS parameter changes are related to enalapril ODMTs is strongly supported by 
the data. Even if no control group was included for comparison, and despite the natural course of disease 
can lead to a stimulation of the RAAS system, these factors are unable to explain the decrease in the 
aldosterone concentrations seen 4 hours after ODMT administration and that aldosterone concentrations 
remained decreased until the end of the study, both in ACEI naïve and ACEI pre-treated cohorts. Age 
Assessment report

dependent changes can also interact with the RAAS system and decreasing aldosterone concentrations 
had been reported with increasing age. Renin, angiotensin I and plasma renin activity have also been 
reported to be decreased with increasing age. Instead, in this patient cohort, renin, angiotensin I and 
plasma  renin  activity  were  increased  during  the  course  of  studies  WP08  and  WP09.  Thus,  the 
investigation of 4 parameters in parallel and at the same time strongly supports the probability that it is 
more likely that the administration of the enalapril ODMTs is associated with the changes in the RAAS 
parameters seen and that the changes were not due to the course of disease or maturation dependent 
changes of the RAAS system.

2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy
Enalapril is an ACE inhibitor used in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. It may also be 
given prophylactically to patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction to delay the onset of 
symptomatic heart failure, and has been used in patients with left ventricular dysfunction to reduce the 
incidence of coronary ischaemic events, including myocardial infarction.
Enalapril owes its activity to enalaprilat to which it is converted after oral doses. The haemodynamic 
effects are seen within 1 hour of a single oral dose and the maximum effect occurs after about 4 to 6 
hours, although the full effect may not develop for several weeks during chronic dosing. The 
haemodynamic action lasts for about 24 hours, allowing once-daily dosing. Enalapril is given orally as 
the maleate.
Enalaprilat is not absorbed orally but is given by intravenous injection; its haemodynamic effects 
Assessment report 
EMA/481595/2023 
Page 53/85
develop within 15 minutes of injection and reach a peak in 1 to 4 hours. The action lasts for about 6 
hours at recommended doses. Enalaprilat is given as the dihydrate, but doses are expressed in terms 
of the anhydrous substance. Enalaprilat 1.38 mg as the dihydrate is equivalent to about 1.25 mg of 
anhydrous enalaprilat.
In the management of heart failure, severe first-dose hypotension on introduction of an ACE inhibitor 
is common in patients on loop diuretics, but their temporary withdrawal may cause rebound pulmonary 
oedema. Thus, treatment should begin with a low dose under close medical supervision. In patients 
with heart failure or asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction enalapril maleate is given orally in an 
initial dose of 2.5 mg daily. The usual maintenance dose is 20 mg daily as a single dose or in 2 divided 
doses although up to 40 mg daily in 2 divided doses has been given.
Enalapril has been subject to both dose-finding and efficacy studies in children with hypertension or 
heart failure and is licensed for use in hypertension in both the EU and the USA.
In the UK, recommended oral doses of enalapril maleate for hypertension are given according to 
weight as follows:
•
20 kg to < 50 kg: initial dose of 2.5 mg once daily, increased if necessary to a maximum of 20 
mg once daily
≥ 50 kg: initial dose of 5 mg once daily, increased if necessary to a maximum of 40 mg once 
•
daily
In the USA, an initial dose of 80 micrograms/kg (maximum of 5 mg) once daily is recommended.
The BNFC suggests the following doses, which may be given to neonates and children in the treatment 
of hypertension, heart failure, or proteinuria in nephritis:
•
neonate: initial dose of 10 micrograms/kg once daily with careful monitoring of blood pressure 
for 1 to 2 hours after the first dose, increased if necessary to a maximum of 500 micrograms/kg daily 
in 1 to 3 divided doses
•
1 month to 11 years: initial dose of 100 micrograms/kg once daily with careful monitoring of 
blood pressure for 1 to 2 hours after the first dose, increased if necessary to a maximum of 1 mg/kg 
daily in 1 or 2 divided doses
•
12 to 17 years: initial dose of 2.5 mg once daily with careful monitoring of blood pressure for 1 
to 2 hours after the first dose, increased to a usual maintenance dose of 10 to 20 mg daily in 1 or 2 
divided doses. Those weighing 50 kg and over may be given up to 40 mg daily in 1 or 2 divided doses
The bioavailability of enalapril is approximately 60%. Tmax for enalapril is 1 hour after oral 
administration for enalaprilat metabolite (active), 3 to 4.8 hours in adults, whereas in children and 
infants it is 3 – 6 hours. When food is taken with orally administered tablets no effect on PK 
parameters were demonstrated, whereas with enalapril suspension, the effect of food was following: 
Cmax decreased by 46%, Tmax delayed by 20 minutes with a high-fat meal; Enalaprilat metabolite 
(active), Cmax decreased by 36%, Tmax delayed by 62 minutes, AUC reduced by 23% with a high-fat 
meal.
In the report from the Expert Group Meeting on Paediatric Heart Failure organised by the European 
Medicines Agency in 2010 enalapril was considered a first-line treatment for chronic heart failure in 
children. 
As the pathophysiology of heart failure in children is believed to be similar to that in adults with chronic 
heart failure caused by DCM, the applicant conducted a PK bridging study (WP08) in paediatric patients 
with DCM aged 1 month to less than 18 years. The primary objective of this study was to obtain 
Assessment report 
EMA/481595/2023 
Page 54/85
paediatric PK data of enalapril ODMTs to describe the dose exposure in paediatric DCM patients in 
order to identify the doses that lead to an equivalent systemic exposure to that achieved during the 
treatment of adults. Neonates were not included in the study WP08 since DCM generally does not occur 
in newborns’ but develops in infancy. 
The younger population was therefore investigated in a study of children with congenital heart disease 
(CHD) (WP09). This study recruited paediatric patients aged from birth to less than 6 years, excluding 
neonates born at less than 35 weeks of gestational age to obtain paediatric PK data of enalapril ODMTs 
to describe the dose exposure in young children with CHD.
In response to the major objection raised at D120 LoQs regarding the proposed indication including 
neonates from birth, the applicant submitted a step by step presentation of the popPK model 
documentation. 
The applicant agreed initially to restrict the indication to treatment of heart failure in children from one 
month, to less than 18 years. Consequently the major objection was considered resolved. 
However, due to unmet medical need and the split opinion of clinical experts regarding the off-label 
use of enalapril in neonates the applicant was invited to reconsider the exclusion of neonates <1 
month. The applicant presented a PK/PD justification on the extrapolation approach that considered 
data available from neonates demonstrating acceptable exposure margins. Pop. PK analysis was done 
with model simulations, fixed exponents for allometric scaling, maturation functions, simulation of 
exposure parameters provided and compared with older age groups can be used/provided. The 
applicant demonstrated that the available PK data are sufficient to establish the bridge between adults 
and the youngest children. This reassurance also took into account not only the target/maintenance 
dose but the initial dose that an go as low as 0.01 mg/kg/day. The applicant provided the full popPK 
analysis report, including diagnostic plots and updated the maturation function for clearance. The 
adequacy of extrapolating efficacy and safety from adults/older children to neonates was justified, 
including the discussion related to  publication by Ku et al. (Pediatr Cardiol. 2017 Jan; 38(1): 155–
161), which demonstrated severe adverse effects of enalapril particularly in infants <30 days of age. 
Also, the scarcity of subjects <30 days in clinical studies (n=4) is now reflected in SmPC section 4.4 
and section 5.1.
The applicant in their response provided data that allowed to state that final covariate model described 
in the LENA project (“run051”) has been used to perform population modelling of the PK of enalaprilat. 
It was shown that administration of enalapril ODMT to children from birth to adolescents provides 
overall exposures matching those expected in adults taking into account both the target/maintenance 
dose and the initial dose (as low as 0.01 mg/kg/day). 
It can be agreed that the pathophysiological process leading to heart failure in DCM in children is 
considered to be similar to that in adults. Hence, based on PK and safety data, extrapolation from 
adults to neonates can be justified.
The applicant has presented a PK/PD justification on the extrapolation approach from birth to indicate 
the administration of the drug product should not be excluded in neonates <1 month. The extrapolated 
exposure, along with the limited data generated in the population <1 month on PD endpoints and 
safety, demonstrated acceptable exposure margins and support the use of the Aqumeldi from birth. As 
far as the PK aspects of this response are concerned, the methods employed are adequate and the 
results consistent with the original data.
Enalapril is used to treat hypertension and congestive heart failure in infants and is approved in USA 
for patients from 1 month of age. Ku et al, 2017 identified all infants exposed to enalapril in the first 
120 days of life and discharged from 348 NICUs from 1997 to 2012. This author demonstrated in this 
study that from a cohort of 887,910 infants, there were 662 (0.07%) infants identified who were 
Assessment report 
EMA/481595/2023 
Page 55/85
exposed to enalapril during their initial hospitalization. Enalapril was used in 0.03% to 0.09% infants 
from 1997 to 2002 and in 0.07% to 0.10% infants from 2003 to 2012 – thus the use remained 
relatively constant. A total of 142 infants (21%) experienced the composite outcome of death (3), 
hypotension requiring pressors (25), hyperkalaemia (83), or elevated serum creatinine during 
exposure to enalapril (34). Infants <30 days postnatal age at first exposure were more likely to 
experience hyperkalaemia, elevated serum creatinine, and hypotension. Longer durations of exposure 
to enalapril were associated with increased odds of hyperkalaemia and death, but not elevated 
creatinine or hypotension. Approximately one in five infants exposed to enalapril experienced at least 
one AE during treatment, with hyperkalaemia being the most common AE. Among infants without 
congenital anomalies such as congenital heart disease, death during enalapril therapy was extremely 
rare (Ku et al 2017). 
Elimination of enalapril and its active metabolite enalaprilat is primarily renal with reduced kidney 
function leading to increased exposures. This could potentially explain why infants age <30 days are at 
increased risk for other AEs (of which hypotension is the earliest and most often reported AE). In a 
study of enalapril and enalaprilat pharmacokinetics in 12 subjects age 10 days to 6.5 years with 
congestive heart failure, mean area under the curve values of active metabolite per enalapril dose 
normalized for body weight and body surface area were five-fold greater in the three subjects age <20 
days compared to subjects >20 days old (Nakamura et al 1994). This suggests that infants <20 days 
old would require a significantly lower dose than their older counterparts. Hypotension, acute renal 
failure, decreased urine output, and azotaemia associated with use of enalapril have been reported in 
preterm and term infants (Ku et al 2017). 
The applicant in their response stated that it is agreed that lack of data alone should not lead to a 
contraindication in accordance with the EMA SmPC Guideline. In line with the recommendations, 
sections 4.2 and 4.4 have been amended in the Product Information to state that: No data is available 
for treatment of paediatric subjects with liver impairment. Dose adjustment is not considered 
necessary however such children should only be treated with enalapril under strict monitoring. 
Treatment of children below the age of 1 month with hepatic impairment is not recommended. For 
children less than 30 days of age it is stated that treatment of infants < 30 days of age should only be 
conducted with rigorous monitoring, including blood pressure, serum potassium levels and renal 
function.
applicant has also agreed with the following indication: AQUMELDI is indicated for the treatment of 
heart failure in children from birth to less than 18 years.
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy
The CHMP considered all issues related to the assessment of efficacy of enalapril orodispersible tablets 
to be solved and that the product is approvable from the clinical efficacy point of view.
2.6.8.  Clinical safety
Safety data were analysed from studies: WP07, WP08, WP09 and WP10.
Study WP07 safety results
Enalapril Orodispersible Minitablets (ODMTs) have been administered in a bioequivalence study in a 
total of 24 healthy adult male and female volunteers. The drug was well tolerated and no clinically 
Assessment report 
EMA/481595/2023 
Page 56/85
relevant differences in safety and tolerability were seen compared with currently approved solid oral 
dosage forms of enalapril.
Study WP08 safety results
This was a multi-centre, multi-national Phase II/III prospective, open-label, single and multiple dose 
PK bridging study with exploratory PD assessments in paediatric patients with Dilated Cardiomyopathy 
(DCM) requiring ACE inhibitor treatment. The study was initiated in 8 sites in The Netherlands, Austria, 
Hungary, UK, Germany and Serbia. Two groups of children (ACEI pre-treated and treatment-naïve 
children) with heart failure due to DCM were treated with enalapril Orodispersible Minitablets (ODMTs) 
over a period of 8 weeks with the maximum tolerated dose following a defined dose titration scheme. 
Ross Score
Clinical symptoms measured using the Ross scoring system were low with 0 points with a range of 0 to 
2 points at the entry into the study and did not change over time during the trial with 0 points and a 
range of 0 to 2 points at the end of the study.
Blood Pressure and Heart Rate
During the 8 weeks of therapy the mean values of blood pressure did not change over time. The same 
trend was observed for heart rate. Also, during the 8-h blood pressure and heart rate observation after 
ingestion of the first enalapril ODMTs at the Initial Dose Visit no changes were reported in blood 
pressure or heart rate in naïve or ACEI pre-treated patients.
Renal Safety Parameters
At various time points the numbers of creatinine values that were out of range varied from 6-19%. 
Higher than normal creatinine levels expected for patient age was found in only one patient. At 
inclusion, creatinine was less than 2xULN in all patients and remained stable throughout time although 
the level did not fall to normal values. Some patients had lower than expected creatinine levels, but 
this decrease was not consistently detected in the majority of patients at all study time points.
GFR was estimated by calculation of the CrCl out of serum creatinine levels according to the modified 
Schwartz formula. However, GFR was constant over time in the study.
Potassium levels were generally within normal range, although in 10 children potassium levels were 
increased above ULN at single time points. There were no cases where potassium was systematically 
increased at the majority of visits. In all but one case potassium levels were ≤ 5.5 mmol/L. In one 
case a potassium level of 5.8 mmol/L was found, and this resolved spontaneously. This child was on 
enalapril and carvedilol, but without diuretics (spironolactone). Kidney function in this child was normal 
as measured by serum creatinine and BUN.
In 7/32 children BUN levels were increased above the ULN at single time points. In three children BUN 
was increased in the majority of tests and ranged between 6-10 mmol/L. In all other cases the 
increase in BUN was incidental, while all other values were within normal range. In 12/32 cases BUN 
levels were low at one or more visits.
Microalbuminuria was reported as percentage (%) of children above the ULN. It was consistently 
reported in only one patient as of the first visit. As this patient prematurely left the study and was lost 
to follow-up, only limited data are available. Microalbuminuria was incidentally reported in three other 
cases, but at other visits microalbumin was within normal range.
Haematology Parameters
Assessment report 
EMA/481595/2023 
Page 57/85
Haematology results (number of leucocytes, platelets, haematocrit and haemoglobin values), showed 
no systematic changes between the Screening and the End-of-Study Visits. In the majority of cases 
the deviation from normal was only mild without the need for any therapeutic intervention.
However, in one child haemoglobin dropped from 111 g/L at the Initial Dose Visit to 72 g/L at the End-
of-Study Visit. Notably this child also suffered from recurrent airway infection.
Platelets were mildly increased in a number of patients, which is common in young children at times of 
mild (viral) infection. In one patient platelets were 64 at the first visit but had increased to the normal 
range at the last visit.
Finally, white blood cell count was slightly increased at the Initial Dose Visit in 3 cases and slightly 
decreased in one patient at the End-of-Study Visit. No relationship with the underlying disease or the 
use of drugs was suspected.
Adverse Events
The administered enalapril ODMT doses were well tolerated. Eleven (34.5%) patients did not 
experience any AEs during their study participation. Forty-two AEs occurred in 21 of the 32 (65.6%) 
patients enrolled into this study. Most frequently observed AEs were pyrexia in 4 patients (12.5%), 
nasopharyngitis and rash in 3 children each (9.4%).
Serious Adverse Events
One SAE (syncope due to hypotension in the context of a gastro-intestinal infection and hospitalisation 
for observational purposes), unrelated to IMP intake, was reported.
Deaths
No deaths occurred.
Rehospitalization 
No rehospitalisation due to heart failure including the need for heart transplantation or the institution 
of mechanical circulatory support occurred.
Applicant’s conclusion regarding safety issues in Study WP08
Blood pressure to renal safety, Ross Score, markers of the RAAS and Nt-proBNP did not show IMP 
related alterations in the studied patient population over the 8 week treatment period.
With only 2 (4.9%) IMP-related adverse events and 1 unrelated SAE that occurred in 21 of the 32 
(65.5%) enrolled patients assessed in possible relationship with IMP administration, the individually 
adapted dosing of 0.25 mg and 1 mg enalapril ODMTs showed a very satisfactory safety profile.
Acceptability of administration of 1 to 10 ODMTs (0.25 mg and 1 mg) in patients aged between 1 
month and 12 years was 100%. All assessments (100%) in children below 6 months and above 6 
years revealed complete swallowability. In the age group of 6 months to 5 years complete 
swallowability was achieved in 84.7% of the assessments. Palatability of both dose strengths of 
enalapril ODMT was also rated positive or neutral in 97% of cases.
Study WP09 safety results
This study was a multi-centre, multi-national Phase II/III prospective, open-label, single and multiple 
dose pharmacokinetic bridging study with exploratory pharmacodynamic assessments in paediatric 
patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) requiring ACE inhibitor treatment. The study was initiated 
in 8 sites in The Netherlands, Austria, Hungary, UK, Germany and Serbia. Two groups of children (ACEI 
Assessment report 
EMA/481595/2023 
Page 58/85
pre-treated and treatment-naïve children) with heart failure due to CHD were treated with enalapril 
ODMTs over a period of 8 weeks with the maximum tolerated dose following a defined dose titration 
scheme.
Safety Parameters
Ross Score
In 61 patients younger than 12 months of age the mean Ross Score value significantly decreased 
(p<0.0001) from 4.1 at the Screening Visit to 2.0, at the End-of-Study Visit. More than half of the 
patients (N= 32) aged up to 12 months were treated with enalapril ODMTs for the first time in addition 
to standard decongestive therapy. Eight patients out of 61 were successfully and safely up-titrated to 
the target dose defined by the protocol. All other patients (N= 38) were successfully and safely 
switched to an equivalent dose of enalapril ODMT. The Ross Score mean value significantly decreased 
in both, naïve and ACEI pre-treated children at the End-of- Study Visit, from 5.1 to 2,5, (p<0.0001); 
and from 2.7 to 1.2 (p<0.001) respectively (Figure ).
Figure : Ross score in WP09 (grey boxplots and bars) patients naïve or pretreated with ACEI. Wilcoxon 
test p<0.05 indicate significant improvement in the Ross clinical symptom score of naïve and 
pretreated patients with heart failure due to congenital heart disease.
Blood Pressure and Heart Rate
During the 8 weeks of therapy the mean values of blood pressure did not change over time. The same 
trend was observed for heart rate. After ingestion of enalapril ODMTs no obvious changes were 
reported in blood pressure in naïve or ACEI pre-treated patients. The lowest blood pressure values, 
both systolic and diastolic, were noted three hours after enalapril ODMT intake. However, hypotension, 
an AE related to enalapril ODMT was recorded twice in one patient.
Renal Safety Parameters
Assessment report 
EMA/481595/2023 
Page 59/85
The mean value for the renal safety parameter potassium did not change over the 8 weeks of therapy 
at any time points. However, hyperkalaemia was observed in two patients as an AE related to enalapril 
ODMT. Median values of urea/BUN did not vary between Screening and End-of-Study Visits and 
remained within reference range values. All serum creatinine values were lower than 2x ULN at any 
timepoint in the study. In four or less children per visit, microalbumin values were not within normal 
limits and belonged to the upper limit of normal (ULN).
Haematology Parameters
Haematology results (number of leucocytes, platelets, haematocrit and haemoglobin values), showed 
no systematic changes between the Screening and the End-of-Study Visit. In the majority of cases the 
deviation from normal was only mild without the need for any therapeutic intervention.
Lower haemoglobin values were noted in 16 cases at the Screening Visit, and in slightly larger number 
at the End-of-Study Visit; in 18 cases. The mean value of haemoglobin at the Screening Visit was 
118.76 g/l, and a bit lower at the End-of-Study Visit, namely 114.73 g/l. No relationship with the the 
use of IMP was suspected.
Adverse events
The administered enalapril ODMT doses were well tolerated. Eighteen (25.7%) patients did not 
experience any AE during their study participation. In 52 of the 70 (74.3%) patients enrolled into this 
study 118 AEs occurred. Only 7 AEs (5.9%), were assessed as possibly, probably or certainly related 
with IMP intake. Eight (6.8%) AEs were of severe intensity, 32 (27.1%) AEs were of moderate 
intensity and 78 AEs (66.1%) of mild intensity. Most frequently observed AEs were cardiac operation 
(15 AEs,12.7%), pyrexia (14 AEs, 11.9%), and rhinitis (9 AEs, 7.6%). All other AEs described below 
occurred less frequently.
Serous adverse events (SAE)
Five SAEs without causal relationship with the IMP occurred; all but one (paresis right hemidiaphragma 
after cardiac surgery) resolved without sequela.
Deaths
No deaths occurred.
Applicant’s conclusions regarding safety in WP9:
With 118 AEs (average 2.3 AEs/patient) in 52 of the 70 patients (74.3%) and the fact that only 6.5% 
of the AEs and none of the 5 SAEs had causal relationship with IMP administration, enalapril ODMTs of 
0.25 mg and 1 mg administered in individually adapted doses between 0.125 mg and 4 mg 
demonstrated a satisfactory safety profile.
Acceptability of one to four enalapril ODMTs with a content of 0.25 mg and 1 mg enalapril reached a 
level of 100% in all age groups. Palatability of both dose strengths of enalapril ODMTs was also rated 
positive or neutral in 96.9% of cases.
Study WP10 - open long-term observation safety study
This was a Phase II/III prospective, open-label, safety follow-up study in infants and children enrolled 
in the trials 2015-602295-01 (WP08) and 2015-602295-02 (WP09) under stable optimal dose or no 
longer under enalapril ODMT treatment, with exploratory pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic 
assessments in children under IMP treatment.
Assessment report 
EMA/481595/2023 
Page 60/85
Patients in the previous WP8 and WP9 trials were up-titrated under close clinical observation to an 
optimal dose and maintained this dose for the remaining duration of 2 months in these LENA trials. 
Patients who had completed this treatment period under enalapril ODMT treatment those who had 
received enalapril ODMTs for at least 3 days but had stopped, were invited to join the open long-term 
observation safety study “WP10” for an additional 10 months. Of the 102 patients enrolled in WP08 
and WP09 trials 86 continued into the WP10 trial.
Primary endpoint 
To demonstrate the safety of enalapril ODMTs.
The administered enalapril ODMT doses were well tolerated. Thirty-seven (43.02%) patients did not 
experience any adverse event during their study participation. In 49 of the 86 (56.98%) patients 
enrolled into this study 137 AEs occurred. Six of these events were classified as medical events as they 
occurred in 3 patients that were not or no longer under IMP (tonsillopharyngitis, 2 x prolonged 
mechanical ventilation in the same patient, vomiting and diarrhoea, running nose and neutropenia). 
Only 1 adverse event (0.76%) (intermittent dizziness and blurred vision when sitting or standing up) 
was rated possibly related with IMP intake by the investigator. All other 130 adverse events had no 
causal relationship with the intake of study medication. Eleven adverse events (8.40%) were of severe 
intensity, 57 AEs (43.51%) were of moderate intensity, but also 2 of the 6 medical events (33.33%) 
were of moderate intensity. 63 AEs (48.09%) were of mild intensity and 4 (66.66%) medical events 
were also classified as mild. Most frequently observed AEs were epistaxis (8 AEs in 1 patient), rhinitis 
(7 AEs in 5 patients), upper respiratory tract infections (7 AEs in 7 patients), and cardiac failure (7 AEs 
in 2 patients).
Eighty eight (67.18%) AEs occurred in patients who were below one year of age when they joined the 
previous WP08 or WP09 study.
Serious adverse events
Seven SAEs occurred in 7 patients and were assessed as being without causal relationship with IMP 
administration. Four Serious Medical Events occurred in 2 patients who were not or no longer under 
IMP when the Serious Medical Event occurred.
Deaths
No deaths occurred, and no rehospitalisation due to heart failure including the need for heart 
transplantation was reported.
Secondary Outcomes WP10 devoted to safety and tolerance of study drug
Acceptability and palatability of enalapril ODMTs.
Acceptability:
In total, 256 acceptability tests were performed: A total of 74 (28.9%) acceptability assessments were 
performed at the 1st Follow-up Visit, 136 (53.1%) assessments during the 2nd., 3rd., or 4th. Follow-
up Visit and 46 (18.0%) assessments during the Close-out Visit. In total, 95 (37.1%) assessments 
were performed with the 1 mg enalapril ODMT, 148 (57.8%) assessments with the 0.25 mg enalapril 
ODMT. In 13 assessments both dose strengths were administered simultaneously. In 203 (79.3%) 
assessments complete swallowability was observed. In 53 (20.7%) observations children aged 2 
months to 12 years only partially swallowed the ODMT or chewed on it. No other levels of acceptability 
were observed. As acceptability is a composite of the two observed criteria level, acceptability of 
administration of 1 to 10 ODMTs in patients between 2 months and 12 years was 100%.
Palatability
Assessment report 
EMA/481595/2023 
Page 61/85
The percentage of children showing pleasant reactions at the 1st Follow-up Visit appeared to be higher 
in children older than 5 months with exception of “Taste” in the 6 to 12 years Age Group. All other 
patients showed “Neutral” reactions or rated the palatability as “good”. Only one older patient rated 
the size of the ODMTs as “Not sure”. In the course of the further Follow- up Visits and the Close-out 
Visit the rating of “pleasant” and “very good” dominated. The patients in Age Group 3 (6 to 12 years) 
were somewhat more critical than the observing investigators but overall, their assessment of the 
palatability of the enalapril ODMTs was also very satisfactory. There was no difference between the 1 
mg and the 0.25 mg enalapril ODMTs because the percentage of their overall rating of 
“Pleasant”/“Neutral” and “Really good”/”Good”/”Not sure” versus “Unpleasant” and ”Bad” was 
comparable. The two ratings of “unpleasant reactions” occurred after administration of four and six 
0.25 mg ODMTs respectively, the one rating “bad taste” after administration of four 1 mg enalapril 
ODMTs. Overall, a favourable or neutral palatability rating could be observed in more than 90% of the 
assessments and thus could be considered satisfactory in all age groups.
The applicant concluded that by reviewing the acceptability and palatability of enalapril minitablets, it 
was found that the majority of patients had a positive experience when taking the both the 0.25 mg 
and 1 mg enalapril ODMT.
Clinical Laboratory Evaluations
Renal function in paediatric patients under and after enalapril ODMT treatment
Renal function was assessed based on the measurements of several variables:


Potassium levels: No significant difference in mean serum potassium levels between 1st 
Follow-up Visit and Close-out Visit were observed in any of the age groups. 
Blood urea nitrogen levels: blood urea nitrogen levels were significantly higher at the Close-out 
visit in the youngest age group compared to the start of the study. For all other age groups, no 
significant difference in mean blood urea nitrogen level existed between 1st Follow-up Visit and 
Close-out Visit. 

Creatinine levels: mean serum creatinine levels were similar at time of 1st Follow-up Visit and 
the Close-out Visit in all age groups. 
 Microalbuminuria: no surprising results were seen in the presence of microalbuminuria as 
values were similar in all age groups at the time of 1st Follow-up Visit and the Close-out Visit. 
 GFR values: mean and median GFR levels were comparable to reference GFR values corrected 
for age, indicating proper renal function in patients. 
A similar percentage of patients had laboratory values below or above normal ranges at start 
compared to the end of the study, thus demonstrating excellent safety.
Clinical laboratory values were evaluated, including leucocyte levels, haematocrit, haemoglobin and 
thrombocyte levels. Both haematocrit as well as thrombocyte levels changed statistically significantly 
over the course of the study in the youngest age group. However, these changes are not clinically 
relevant and, in the case of haematocrit, can be partly explained by the effect of age on these 
parameters.
Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety

Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was calculated based on measure systolic and diastolic blood pressure. 
MAP increased in every Age Group throughout the duration of the study except for children aged 6-12 
months where it showed a minor decrease.
 General safety
General safety was assessed based on several variables: 
o
o
o
ECG: No changes other than disease-related changes were detected, and no changes in 
clinical management resulted from the ECG analyses. 
Shortening fraction (ECHO): mean and median values increased over the course of the 
study, an effect that can be attributed to age-related changes. 
Ross score: mean and median Ross scores were slightly higher at the 1st Follow-up 
Visit compared to the Close-out Visit in Age Group 1a, 1b and 2, whereas in Age Group 
1c and 3, mean and median Ross scores were somewhat higher at the end of study. 
However, these changes were very minor.

2.6.8.1.  Post marketing experience
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country.
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety
This application relies in part on the results of pre-clinical tests and clinical trials for the reference 
product (Renitec®) enalapril maleate tablets which have been marketed for more than 20 years and in 
part on new clinical data. The reference product is indicated for use in heart failure in adults only. 
Safety data available from the reference product are summarized below:
Contraindications:
•
•
•
•
•
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients or any other ACE inhibitor
History of angioedema associated with previous ACE inhibitor therapy
Hereditary or idiopathic angioedema
Second and third trimesters of pregnancy
The concomitant use of enalapril maleate tablets with aliskiren-containing products is 
contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2)
•
Combination with sacubitril/valsartan due to the increased risk of angioedema. Do not 
administer enalapril maleate tablets within 36 hours of switching to or from sacubitril/valsartan, a 
product containing a neprilysin inhibitor [SPC Renitec]
All four trials provided within IMA (WP07, WP08, WP09, WP10) were performed as part of an agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) and hence all criteria were discussed and agreed upon by the EMA 
Paediatric Committee (PDCO).
Patients in the previous WP08 and WP09 trials that were included in study WP10 were up-titrated 
under close clinical observation to an optimal dose and maintained this dose for the remaining duration 
Assessment report 
EMA/481595/2023 
Page 66/85
of 2 months in these LENA trials. Patients who had completed this treatment period under enalapril 
ODMT treatment and those who had received enalapril ODMTs for at least 3 days but had stopped, 
were invited to join the open long-term observation safety study “WP10” for an additional 10 months. 
Of the 102 patients enrolled in WP08 and WP09 trials 86 continued into the WP10 trial. The primary 
objective of this trial was to demonstrate the safety of enalapril ODMTs. Safety observations made in 
the reporting period showed that the IMPs were very well tolerated. The one adverse event that was 
considered as having a possible causality was mild (hypotensive reaction to enalapril). No drug-related 
SAEs and thus no SUSARs occurred. Also, no death occurred. Other safety parameters comprised blood 
pressure, renal monitoring, Ross score, Echocardiography, ECG and safety laboratory tests. Mean 
arterial pressure slightly increased in every Age Group throughout the duration of the study except for 
children between the ages of 6 and 12 months where a minor decrease was seen. Statistically 
significant differences between start and end of the study were observed in serum levels of BUN and 
creatinine in the youngest age group. However, these were minor and considered as not clinically 
relevant. Other secondary safety parameters did not show a statistically significant difference in mean 
levels at the start compared to the end of study visit in any age group and thus, this did not lead to 
concerns regarding the safety of enalapril ODMTs.
Also, the analysis of general safety parameters, including shortening fraction, Ross score and physical 
examination did not reveal any alarming or surprising results. Lastly, clinical laboratory values were 
evaluated, including leucocyte levels, haematocrit, haemoglobin and thrombocyte levels. Both 
haematocrit as well as thrombocyte levels changed statistically significantly over the course of the 
study in the youngest age group. However, these changes are not clinically relevant and, in the case of 
haematocrit, can be partly explained by the effect of age on these parameters.
The secondary objectives of this trial were to describe the acceptability and palatability of enalapril 
ODMTs, as well as to collect additional information about pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 
enalapril ODMTs during long term treatment.
Enalapril and enalaprilat were measured at each of the five study visits under IMP administration. The 
number of samples decreased from initially 80 to 31 until the end of the study as patients with 
congenital heart disease stopped IMP administration after surgery during the trial, or improved and 
therefore stopped medication. The mean weight and dose normalized concentrations were between 
13.0 and 48.0 [ng/mL/mg*kg] for enalapril and 81.2 and 105.7 [ng/mL/mg*kg] for enalaprilat. 
Several concentrations for enalapril had “0” values. Enalapril has a short half-life of 2 to 4 hours. Since 
the samples were taken at the end of the dosing interval before the next dose was taken, enalapril 
concentrations could have been below the limit of quantification in several samples. Enalaprilat, 
however, has a longer half-life of 8 to 12 hours. The measured concentrations of “0” for enalaprilat 
indicate potential adherence problems to their medication during the follow up study.
Since children had already been treated with enalapril ODMT before the beginning of the trial, IMP 
related changes could not be investigated in WP10. Renin, plasma renin activity, angiotensin I and 
aldosterone concentrations decreased over time. At the beginning of the trial, renin, plasma renin 
activity, angiotensin I and aldosterone values were to 1095 pg/mL, 60.4 ng/mL/h , 3.2 ng/mL and 
363.9 pg/mL respectively, and at the end of the trial values were 285.9 pg/mL, 20.6 ng/mL/h 1.4 
ng/mL and 184.5 pg/mL respectively. As it is known that the investigated RAAS parameters decrease 
in concentrations throughout the first years of life, this might explain the observed decrease in 
concentrations in the investigated patient population and thus has demonstrated the likely maturation 
of the RAAS system.
By reviewing the acceptability and palatability of enalapril minitablets, it was found that the majority of 
patients had a positive experience when taking the both the 0.25 mg and 1 mg enalapril ODMT.

The proposed earlier contraindication for “Paediatric patients with pre-existing liver abnormalities” or 
“Children < 1 month of age with liver abnormalities” was not considered appropriate since lack of data 
alone should not lead to a contraindication. Taking also into consideration both that “liver 
abnormalities” represent a very broad array of clinical conditions, it was agreed to introduce a warning 
statement in sections 4.2 and 4.4 that no data are available for children with pre-existing liver 
conditions, that children (any age) with hepatic impairment should only be treated with enalapril under 
very strict monitoring and that treatment of children below the age of 1 month is not recommended.
The very low initial dose used did not produce in the submitted trials any hepatobiliary disorders, which 
could be also due to the very low number of neonates with AE reported in the trials. Despite this, the 
applicant has introduced a contraindication that lowers the risk of developing hepatobiliary disorders 
(group of patients excluded “Paediatric patients with pre-existing liver abnormalities”) in neonates with 
circulatory failure. This is important since structured recommendations on the management of liver 
dysfunction in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) are scarce. Several factors can contribute 
to causing liver dysfunction in patients with CHD. The cause for liver impairment can be the result from 
a wide spectrum of various different causes, including liver congestion, hypoxemia or low cardiac 
output. Liver congestion from backward failure of the heart is a frequent phenomenon that can result 
in the development of cardiac fibrosis and cirrhosis. Not only venous congestion itself is responsible for 
hemodynamic related liver dysfunction in CHD, as oxygen supply can be affected by multiple factors in 
CHD such as low cardiac output, cyanosis or impaired oxygenation because of lung problems related to 
CHD. Impaired lung function is observed frequently as non-cardiac problem in CHD. The impaired 
oxygen supply becomes particularly relevant when sinusoidal pressure is already elevated due to 
venous congestion. This in turn reduces portal inflow and makes the liver more susceptible to ischemic 
alterations due to a reduced flow of the hepatic artery such as in ischemic hepatitis. Chronic hepatic 
ischemia (resulting from cardiac insufficiency) is a known factor for the development of liver fibrosis. 
Hemodynamic pathophysiology of CHD related liver disease should be seen in the context of both 
forward and backward cardiac failure. Liver diseases in CHD do not only occur in the context of 
hemodynamic alterations (this is especially true in the adult population).
Pathophysiologically, liver changes occur in a wide variety of CHDs, and the mechanisms are different, 
but reported in literature.
Concluding, no important risks were associated with enalapril ODMT administration in paediatric 
patients from one month to 12 years of age. The scarcity of subjects <30 days in clinical studies (n=4) 
is reflected in SmPC sections 4.4 and 5.1.
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety
Based on the presented bioequivalence study(ies)against the reference product, Renitec®, which 
demonstrated bioequivalence between the 1 mg strength, and taking in to account the availability of in 
vivo data for the 0.25 mg strength from paediatric clinical studies WP08 and WP09, these in vivo data 
were considered to be sufficient to support the approval of the 0.25 mg strength without the need for 
further data. 
In addition, the proposed indication, i.e. treatment of heart failure in children from birth to 18 years, is 
based on an extrapolation approach with PK bridging, targeting the equivalent systemic exposure to 
that achieved during the treatment of adults.
However, considering that the indication also covers pre-term and term neonates the applicant was 
asked and adequately justified during the procedure, that the extrapolation approach is adequate also 
for this age group (neonates) considering potential differences in PK/PD relationship and safety 
compared to adults. In addition, the applicant demonstrated that the available PK data are sufficient to 
Assessment report 
EMA/481595/2023 
Page 68/85
establish the bridge between adults and the youngest children. The reassurance was provided also 
taking into account not only the target/maintenance dose but the initial dose that can go as low as 
0.01 mg/kg/day. 
The applicant was asked to consider the use of enalapril in the treatment of neonates further justifying 
(presenting efficacy/safety data and adequacy of extrapolation of all data to neonates) in particular 
based on the findings published by Ku et al. (Pediatr Cardiol. 2017 Jan; 38(1): 155–161), which 
demonstrated severe adverse effects of enalapril particularly in infants <30 days of age.
This is mainly due to the fact that many cases of nephrotoxic effects of RAAS inhibitors (acute renal 
failure, renal tubular dysplasia) have been reported in foetuses and newborns exposed to RAAS 
inhibitors during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy in humans. Ku et al. (2017) examined 
the safety of enalapril in young infants and found that treatment in the first 30 days of life led to 
severe adverse effects (death, hyperkalaemia, elevated serum creatinine and hypotension) in up to 20 
% of infants. The mechanisms involved in ACE inhibitor-induced acute renal failure are reduced renal 
blood flow and increased renal vascular resistance with decreased glomerular filtration rate at birth in 
combination with hypotension and decreased renal elimination of enalapril rendering young infants 
particularly sensitive to ACE inhibitor-induced renal failure.
The European Medicines Agency Expert Group Meeting on Paediatric Heart Failure considered enalapril 
a first-line treatment for chronic heart failure in children. The literature regarding this is heterogenous 
in outcome and studied population. However, it can be agreed that the expected effect of ACEi is 
similar in adults and children and therefore, extrapolation from adults to children of all ages based on 
PK data targeting a similar exposure in paediatric patients as in adults could be acceptable. 
The applicant has performed a Population PK (popPK) model including allometric exponents and 
maturation functions for the relevant PK parameters of enalaprilat. Predictions were made covering all 
paediatric age groups from neonates to adolescents and compared with adult exposure margins at the 
starting dose as well as the maintenance dose of enalapril. The PK data from studies WP08 and WP09 
has been used in this analysis to establish a bridge between adults and the youngest children focusing 
on exposure. Population modelling of the PK of enalaprilat was performed based on the final covariate 
model described in the LENA project (“run051”) and using the NONMEM® datastream as reported. The 
paediatric PK parameters for a 1st order absorption 1-compartment PK model were estimated by 
applying allometric scales on the clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (V).
Throughout the simulation process, the full compounded population variability was extracted from both 
the parameter and weight distributions at each age group. The allometric scales were applied for the 
proposed age, but weights for allometric scaling were extracted from the corresponding age dependent 
distributions from typical Age-Weight listings (CDC 2000). Weight distributions were constructed using 
the reported 95th quantile and these distributions were sampled together with the random effects for 
CL and V2.
In order to increase resolution, a dense simulation grid was built with 69 time points for each of the 
age – dose levels. The full PK cycles, Day 1 and Day 11, had 19 time points each.
The PK exposures were evaluated across fourteen age levels at 1 day, 28 days then 4-year-old (yo), 
12 yo and adult (20 yo). Additionally, the dose of 0.01 mg/kg/day was simulated as adjusted only by 
the paediatric weight (3.5 kg) for the 1-day-old neonate.
As far as the PK aspects of this response are concerned, the methods employed are adequate and the 
results consistent with the original data.
The applicant in their response provided data that allowed to state that final covariate model described 
in the LENA project (“run051”) has been used to perform population modelling of the PK of enalaprilat.

It was shown that administration of enalapril ODMT to children from birth to adolescents provides 
overall exposures matching those expected in adults taking into account both the target/maintenance 
dose and the initial dose (as low as 0.01 mg/kg/day). 
It was agreed that the pathophysiological process leading to heart failure in DCM in children is 
considered to be similar to that in adults. Hence, based on PK and safety data, extrapolation from 
adults to neonates can be justified.
The applicant has presented a PK/PD justification on the extrapolation approach from birth to indicate 
the administration of the drug product should not be excluded in neonates <1 month. The extrapolated 
exposure, along with the limited data generated in the population <1 month on PD endpoints and 
safety, demonstrate acceptable exposure margins and support the use of the Aqumeldi from birth. 
As far as the PK aspects of this response are concerned, the methods employed are adequate and the 
results consistent with the original data.
The referred to study (Ku et al 2017) has shown that from a cohort of 887,910 infants, we identified 
662 (0.07%) infants who were exposed to enalapril during their initial hospitalization. Enalapril was 
used in 0.03% to 0.09% infants from 1997 to 2002 and in 0.07% to 0.10% infants from 2003 to 2012 
– thus the use remained relatively constant. A total of 142 infants (21%) experienced the composite 
outcome of death (3), hypotension requiring pressors (25), hyperkalaemia (83), or elevated serum 
creatinine during exposure to enalapril (34). Infants <30 days postnatal age at first exposure were 
more likely to experience hyperkalaemia, elevated serum creatinine, and hypotension. Longer 
durations of exposure to enalapril were associated with increased odds of hyperkalaemia and death, 
but not elevated creatinine or hypotension. Approximately one in five infants exposed to enalapril 
experienced at least one AE during treatment, with hyperkalaemia being the most common AE. Among 
infants without congenital anomalies such as congenital heart disease, death during enalapril therapy 
was extremely rare (Ku et al 2017).
Elimination of enalapril and its active metabolite enalaprilat is primarily renal, reduced kidney function 
leading to increased exposure could potentially explain why infants age <30 days are at increased risk 
for other AEs (of which hypotension is the earliest and most often reported AE). In a study of enalapril 
and enalaprilat pharmacokinetics in 12 subjects aged 10 days to 6.5 years with congestive heart 
failure, mean area under the curve values of active metabolite per enalapril dose normalized for body 
weight and body surface area were five-fold greater in the three subjects age <20 days compared to 
subjects >20 days old (Nakamura et al 1994). This suggests that infants <20 days old would require a 
significantly lower dose than their older counterparts. Hypotension, acute renal failure, decreased urine 
output, and azotaemia associated with use of enalapril have been reported in preterm and term infants 
(Ku et al 2017). 
The CHMP considered that the initially applied therapeutic indication: “AQUMELDI is indicated for the 
treatment of heart failure in children from birth to less than 18 years.’’ is approvable from the clinical 
safety perspective.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance
2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC.
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements
Currently, the PSUR frequency for enalapril is five years with DLP for the next PSUR 23-03-31. A five-
year PSUR cycle for Aqumeldi, being the first ACE inhibitor indicated from birth, is considered too long. 
On the other hand, enalapril is a very well established and common substance used in large number of 
medical products. To increase the PSUR frequency for all enalapril containing products would therefore 
be unnecessary. 
Based on this reasoning, a separate entry in the EURD list for enalapril (centrally authorised product 
for use in children below the age of 18) is needed, as it cannot follow the already existing entry for 
enalapril maleate. 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. 
Assessment report 
EMA/481595/2023 
Page 71/85
To facilitate a potential alignment in the future of the “paediatric” enalapril PSUR with the overall 
enalapril PSUR, it is proposed that the same DLP (i.e., XX-03-31) should be used in the EURD.
The new EURD entry to be created will be named “Enalapril (centrally authorised product for use in 
children below the age of 18)”.
The applicant for Aqumeldi agrees to align their DLP for DD/MM with the one existing for the enalapril 
5 PSUR frequency. The new EURD entry for Enalapril (centrally authorised product for use in children 
below the age of 18) will therefore have a DLP of 31/03/XX and a 1 year PSUR frequency while the 
existing enalapril entry will remain with the DLP of 31/03/23, next DLP of 31/03/2028 and a 5 y PSUR 
frequency.
2.9.  Product information
2.9.1.  User consultation
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context
3.1.1.  Disease or condition
This is a Paediatric Use Marketing Authorisation (PUMA) Application for Aqumeldi 0.25 mg oro-
dispersible tablets. The agreed therapeutic indication is: Aqumeldi is indicated for the treatment of 
heart failure in children from birth to less than 18 years.
Paediatric heart failure (PHF) represents an important cause of morbidity and mortality in childhood. 
Etiology and pathogenesis are different between adults and children: the first mainly relates to 
ischemia, the latter is a consequence of congenital heart diseases (CHDs) or cardiomyopathies in most 
cases. 
More than 50% of paediatric patients have heart failure due to CHD, with this aetiology being 
disproportionately high in the first year of life. It is associated with ventricular dysfunction, volume or 
pressure overload. Heart failure in paediatric patients with CHD has various aetiologies and the risk of 
ventricular dysfunction depends on the specific type of malformation. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need
Currently, there are well-established guidelines for the management of heart failure in the adult 
population. Due to the lack of research trials in children, the clinical guidelines for the treatment of PHF 
Assessment report 
EMA/481595/2023 
Page 72/85
have historically been reliant on expert consensus, and the extrapolation of data from trials performed 
in adults.
In the clinical setting, diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) are used, with 
beta-blockers and devices for electric therapy as other options. In the end-stage disease, heart 
transplantation is the best choice of treatment, while a left ventricular assist device can be used as a 
bridge to transplantation (due to the difficulties in finding organ donors), recovery (in the case of 
myocarditis), or destination therapy (for patients with systemic disease). In adults, enalapril is licensed 
for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure (HF), as well as for reducing proteinuria in chronic 
kidney disease (CKD). The SmPC for Renitec reference medicinal product states that there is only 
limited experience of the use of enalapril in hypertensive paediatric patients older than 6 years of age. 
The mechanism of action of enalapril and its potential pharmacodynamic interactions are believed to be 
similar in adults and paediatric patients.
The importance of pharmacological treatment in PHF, especially dilated cardiomyopathies (DCM), is 
emphasized by the low availability of donor hearts. Owing to this scarcity, mortality within the first 
year of presentation remains extremely high, highlighting the need for optimal treatment in children to 
prevent or postpone transplantation. In children, whilst in clinical practice enalapril is used for similar 
indications as adults, in the European Union (EU) it is only recommended for use in children with 
hypertension and a body weight over 20 kg. In children with HF the doses of enalapril used off-label 
are based on empirical evidence combined with data extrapolated from adult studies. A further 
challenge regarding dosing of ACE-I in paediatrics is the lack of authorised age-appropriate 
formulations licensed for use in PHF throughout EU.
Therefore, there is an unmet medical need for a licensed medicinal product for children with HF that 
could be administered with age-appropriate formulations.
This application concerns a hybrid version of Aqumeldi 0.25 mg oro-dispersible tablets.
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies
This application relies in part on the results of pre-clinical tests and clinical trials for the reference 
product (RENITEC®) enalapril maleate tablets and in part on new clinical data.
The new clinical data were generated within a EU 7th Framework Program where the LENA project was 
conducted (“Labeling of Enalapril from Neonates up to Adolescents”, LENA). 
The LENA project generated core scientific data from four clinical trials WP07, WP08, WP09 and WP10. 
With respect to clinical trials, WP02 developed the Enalapril Orodispersible Mini-Tablets (ODMTs) of 1 
mg and 0.25 mg strengths. WP07 generated clinical data for Enalapril ODMTs in healthy adult 
volunteers. WP08, WP09 and WP10 generated clinical data for Enalapril ODMTs in children with HF. 
WP07: Relative Bioavailability of Enalapril Administered as Orodispersible Mini-Tablets in 24 healthy 
adult volunteers. This was an open label, single dose randomized 3-way crossover, 3-treatment, 3-
period study in 24 healthy male and female subjects, each administered a 10 mg enalapril dose on 3 
occasions, at least one week apart. The primary objective of this study was to assess the relative 
bioavailability of a single 10 mg dose of enalapril administered as ten (10) times 1.0 mg ODMTs taken 
with water and dispersed in the oral cavity versus an authorized standard enalapril tablet formulation 
(reference product: Renitec® 2 x 5 mg tablets, MSD Belgium) taken with water. Secondary endpoints 
were general safety and tolerability including local tolerability and palatability of enalapril administered 
as ODMT.

WP08: This was a multi-centre, multi-national Phase II/III prospective, open-label, single and multiple 
dose pharmacokinetic (PK) bridging study with exploratory pharmacodynamic (PD) assessments in 
paediatric patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) requiring ACE inhibitor treatment. Two groups 
of children (ACEI pre-treated and treatment naïve children) with HF due to DCM were treated with 
enalapril ODMTs over a period of 8 weeks with the maximum tolerated dose following a defined dose 
titration scheme.
WP09: This was a multi-centre, multi-national Phase II/III prospective, open-label, single and multiple 
dose PK bridging study with exploratory PD assessments in paediatric patients with Congenital Heart 
Disease (CHD) requiring ACE inhibitor treatment. Two groups of children (ACEI pre-treated and 
treatment-naïve children) with HF due to CHD were treated with enalapril ODMTs over a period of 8 
weeks with the maximum tolerated dose following a defined dose titration scheme.
The primary objective of Studies WP08 and WP09 was to obtain paediatric PK data of enalapril and its 
active metabolite enalaprilat in paediatric patients treated with enalapril ODMTs. This data described 
the dose exposure in the paediatric population with HF due to DCM and CHD. The studies were 
conducted using both strengths (1mg and 0.25mg) of the ODMTs. The primary endpoint, bioavailability 
of enalapril and enalaprilat in children (0 month - <12 years) (AUC from 0 to time of last sampling 
point, Cmax and tmax), was investigated using descriptive pharmacokinetics.
The secondary endpoint was the bioavailability of enalapril and its active metabolite enalaprilat in the 
different age subsets. To determine it the dose and weight normalized AUCtau, Cmax,ss and tmax,ss 
of enalapril and enalaprilat were compared between the age subsets: 
- WP08 (age group 1, 1 to ˂12 months, age group 2, 12 months to ˂6 years and age group 3, 6 years 
to >12 years); 
- WP09 (age group 1; 0 to ˂12 months, age group 2; 12 months to ˂6 years). 
Based on this, the relative bioavailability of the ODMTs as comparison drug exposure (AUC) and rate 
and extend of absorption (Cmax and tmax) within the given age cohorts of paediatric patients were 
calculated. In addition, weight and dose normalized AUCtau,ss, Cmax, ss and tmax, ss) were 
compared between the different age subsets using statistical testing for two group comparison (t-
test(x~y) for two samples).
In addition to the non-compartmental analysis of the full PK profiles, population PK modelling was 
performed on collected PK and PD data from the start to the end of the studies.
WP10: This was a multi-centre, multi-national Phase II/III prospective, open-label, safety follow up 
study in infants and children enrolled in the trials WP08 and WP09. The duration of treatment was up 
to 10 months. The primary objective of this study were safety issues. The secondary objectives were to 
describe the acceptability and palatability of enalapril ODMTs and to collect additional information 
about pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of enalapril ODMTs during long term treatment.
3.2.  Favourable effects
Enalapril owes its activity to enalaprilat to which it is converted after oral doses. The haemodynamic 
effects are seen within 1 hour of a single oral dose and the maximum effect occurs after about 4 to 6 
hours, although the full effect may not develop for several weeks during chronic dosing. The 
haemodynamic action lasts for about 24 hours, allowing once-daily dosing. Enalapril is given orally as 
the maleate.
Enalaprilat is not absorbed orally but is given by intravenous injection; its haemodynamic effects 
develop within 15 minutes of injection and reach a peak in 1 to 4 hours. The action lasts for about 6 
Assessment report 
EMA/481595/2023 
Page 74/85
hours at recommended doses. Enalaprilat is given as the dihydrate, but doses are expressed in terms 
of the anhydrous substance. Enalaprilat 1.38 mg as the dihydrate is equivalent to about 1.25 mg of 
anhydrous enalaprilat.
In the management of HF, severe first-dose hypotension on introduction of an ACE inhibitor is common 
in patients on loop diuretics, but their temporary withdrawal may cause rebound pulmonary oedema. 
Thus, treatment should begin with a low dose under close medical supervision. In patients with HF or 
asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction enalapril maleate is given orally in an initial dose of 2.5 mg 
daily. The usual maintenance dose is 20 mg daily as a single dose or in 2 divided doses although up to 
40 mg daily in 2 divided doses has been given.
In the UK, recommended oral doses of enalapril maleate for hypertension are given according to 
weight as follows:

20 kg to < 50 kg: initial dose of 2.5 mg once daily, increased if necessary to a maximum of 20 
mg once daily
 ≥ 50 kg: initial dose of 5 mg once daily, increased if necessary to a maximum of 40 mg once 
daily
In the USA, an initial dose of 80 micrograms/kg (maximum of 5 mg) once daily is recommended.
The British National Formulary for Children (BNFC) suggests the following doses, which may be given 
to neonates and children in the treatment of hypertension, heart failure, or proteinuria in nephritis:

neonate: initial dose of 10 micrograms/kg once daily with careful monitoring of blood pressure 
for 1 to 2 hours after the first dose, increased if necessary to a maximum of 500 
micrograms/kg daily in 1 to 3 divided doses

1 month to 11 years: initial dose of 100 micrograms/kg once daily with careful monitoring of 
blood pressure for 1 to 2 hours after the first dose, increased if necessary to a maximum of 1 
mg/kg daily in 1 or 2 divided doses

12 to 17 years: initial dose of 2.5 mg once daily with careful monitoring of blood pressure for 1 
to 2 hours after the first dose, increased to a usual maintenance dose of 10 to 20 mg daily in 1 
or 2 divided doses. Those weighing 50 kg and over may be given up to 40 mg daily in 1 or 2 
divided doses
The bioavailability of enalapril is approximately 60%. Tmax for enalapril is 1 hour after oral 
administration and for enalaprilat metabolite (active) it is 3 to 4.8 hours in adults, whereas in children 
and infants it is 3 – 6 hours. With regards to the impact of food with orally administered tablets, no 
effect on PK parameters were demonstrated, whereas on enalapril suspension, the effect of food Cmax 
decreased by 46%, Tmax delayed by 20 minutes with a high-fat meal; Enalaprilat metabolite (active), 
Cmax decreased by 36%, Tmax delayed by 62 minutes, AUC reduced by 23% with a high-fat meal.
In adults, enalapril is a drug with well-established medical use and proven efficacy for the treatment of 
CHF and hypertension as well as for prevention of symptomatic HF in patients with EF below 35%.
Scientific literature, submitted by the applicant in support of this hybrid application, shows that 
enalapril is considered a standard pharmacological therapy for PHF which is based on studies in adults 
with HF. Fourteen studies in the public domain report on the efficacy of enalapril in children with HF; 
two of these studies were double-blind placebo-controlled randomised trials (RCT’s). These two RCTs 
comparing enalapril to placebo were conducted in PHF patients with single ventricle physiology [Hsu et 
al (2010) and Smeets et al (2020)]. These children have a special haemodynamic situation, and the 
clinical effects of enalapril might not be comparable to other forms of HF.

To date studies reporting paediatric PK data are: 1) study in 40 hypertensive children aged 2 months 
to 16 years [Wells 2001] and 2)  study in 22 patients with CHF [Lloyd 1989; Nakamura 1994]. Only 3 
patients were neonates, 17 were infants below 1 year of age, and 2 were children between 2.8 and 6.5 
years. Therefore, reliable PK data of enalapril to delineate a dosing regimen for paediatric patients with 
HF are not available from current literature data.
A clinical program (LENA project) was therefore undertaken to generate appropriate PK data in the 
paediatric population to allow bridging to adult data to demonstrate efficacy of enalapril in congestive 
heart failure.
The newly developed mini-tablets disintegrate immediately upon contact with water or saliva. The 
objectives of the paediatric trials were achieved. Where paediatric pharmacokinetic data of enalapril 
and its active metabolite enalaprilat were obtained for the enalapril ODMT and a dose exposure in the 
paediatric population with HF due to DCM and CHD. The comparisons of the bioavailability for enalapril 
and enalaprilat between age groups indicated a lower rate and extent of exposure of the enalapril 
ODMT in infants compared to older children when assessed globally.  
WP07: The results indicated that the 10 x 1 mg ODMT formulation when swallowed fell within the 
bioequivalence criteria limits when compared to 2 x 5 mg Renitec® tablets. Following dispersion in the 
mouth, a slightly higher Cmax for enalapril was observed as compared to the reference formulation. 
However, the rate and extent of exposure of the active metabolite enalaprilat were within the criteria 
limits for bioequivalence. Finally, it was demonstrated that the method of administration of the ODMT, 
swallowed or dispersed, did not significantly affect the bioavailability of enalapril.
WP08: 
Primary endpoint: paediatric PK data of enalapril and its active metabolite enalaprilat in patients 
treated with enalapril ODMTs were obtained and a dose exposure in the paediatric population with DCM 
was described.
Dose and weight normalized exposure for enalapril was 496 ng/mL*h/mg*kg and that for enalaprilat 
was 1327 ng/mL*h/mg*kg with a high coefficient of variation of 46% and 62% respectively. Dose and 
weight normalised maximum plasma concentrations were 203 ng/mL/mg*kg for enalapril and 155 
ng/mL/mg*kg for enalaprilat. They also had high coefficients of variation of 73% for enalapril and 61% 
respectively. Maximum plasma concentrations were achieved expectedly about 3 hours earlier for 
enalapril with 1.7 hours after dosing compared to the active metabolite enalaprilat with 4.6 hours after 
ODMT dosing. 
The non-compartmental descriptive PK results presented are in line with the objectives of the study. 
Extent and rate of absorption for the comparison between ACEI pre-treated and naïve patients are 
quite similar in the case of enalapril but not in the case of enalaprilat.
Secondary endpoint: A comparison between age groups with respect to rate and extent of exposure 
show lower values in infants with CHD. This result have implications on the dose recommendations 
according to age groups which are ascertained on the basis of the population pharmacokinetics 
analysis.
Exploratory pharmacodynamics for brain natriuretic peptides (Nt-proBNP), shortening fraction and 
RAAS associated with enalapril ODMTs in children with HF were also studied. In children with DCM, Nt-
proBNP median values (range) did not change from 32 (5 to 1 777) pmol/L at the start to 35 (3 to 1 
302) pmol/L (p=ns) at the end of the study. Only 10% of patients in this cohort were ACEi naïve. 
In patients with DCM, echocardiography (shortening fraction) mean values (±SD)  slightly, but 
significantly increased in all patients from 22.3% (SD 7.3)% to 25.1%  ±(SD 7.8)% (p < 0.05, t-test) 
reflecting an improvement of the cardiac conditions of the patients in all age groups.

WP09:
Primary endpoint: paediatric PK data of enalapril and its active metabolite enalaprilat in patients 
treated with enalapril ODMTs were obtained and a dose exposure in the paediatric population with CHD 
was described.
AUCss,norm and Cmax,ss,norm point estimates were similar for enalapril for the pre-treated and the 
naïve patient group (950 and 711 ng/mL*h/mg*kg; 283 versus 269 ng/mL/mg*kg). The point 
estimates were similar and in the same range for enalaprilat (1409 versus 1401 ng/mL*h/mg*kg; 203 
versus 157 ng/mL/mg*kg). This indicates that enalapril PK in this patient cohort is dose proportional 
and that naïve and pre-treated patients can be jointly analysed.
The non-compartmental descriptive PK results presented are in line with the objectives of the study. 
Extent and rate of absorption for the comparison between ACEI pre-treated and naïve patients are 
quite similar in the case of enalapril but not in the case of enalaprilat for Cmax.
Secondary endpoint: The bioavailability of enalaprilat between both age groups for children with CHD 
did not show substantial differences in the rate and extent of exposure between them. No difference 
could be found for the active metabolite enalaprilat. 
In children with CHD, Nt-proBNP levels were lower at the end of the study compared to the beginning. 
The median Nt-proBNP value at the start of the study were 171 (1 to 2 789) pmol/L and 73 (5 to 2 
165) pmol/l (p=ns) at the end. In this cohort 44% of patients were naïve to ACEi treatment.
In patients with CHD, shortening fraction remained almost the same during the study period. Mean 
values (±SD) at the screening and end of study visits were 38.7% (SD 8.6) and 38.5% (SD 6.2) 
respectively.
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects
•
Biowaiver: The clinical program includes a bioequivalence study (WP07) between the enalapril 
ODMT administration and the marketed immediate release tablets. This bioequivalence study was 
conducted with the highest strength (1 mg ODMT) and confirmed equivalent pharmacokinetics to the 
reference product (Renitec® 5 mg tablets). A bioavailability study for the enalapril ODMT 0.25mg in 
adults was not required as part of the PIP as it was considered that a biowaiver would suffice. The 
applicant proposed a BCS-based biowaiver that would cover the enalapril ODMT 0.25mg strength since 
a biowaiver for additional strength (the 0.25mg strength), based on the bioequivalence established for 
the 1.0 mg strength, was not agreed upon. For an additional strength biowaiver, the application 
contained information that did not meet the requirements of the Guideline on the investigation of 
bioequivalence (BE) (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr ** ), with respect to the proportionality of 
the ratio of excipients amounts to the active, different manufacturing processes for the two strengths, 
and pharmacokinetic linearity not being demonstrated. In their BCS-based biowaiver request, the 
applicant stated that enalapril is a BCS class III drug substance.  However, according to ICH M9 
Guideline, for BCS Class III drugs, all of the excipients should be qualitatively the same and 
quantitatively similar. Therefore, the completely different excipient composition between the 
applicant’s formulation and the reference precludes a BCS-based approach to be successful. Also, BCS 
biowaiver requires the same strength for test and reference products which was not met. However, the 
CHMP considered the results of both clinical studies, W08 and W09, were conducted using both the 1 
mg and the 0.25 mg strengths, where the availability of in vivo data for the 0.25 mg strength was 
considered to be sufficient to support the approval of the 0.25 mg strength without the need for 
further in vivo data.

Proposed therapeutic indication (paediatric patients from birth). There were uncertainties with 
respect to posology (and safety) in children < 30 days of age. The full popPK analysis report, including 
diagnostic plots was provided as well as  additional scientific justifications regarding PK/PD for the 
extrapolation approach to indicate the administration of the drug product to children from birth. In the 
submitted responses the applicant produced data that allowed to state that the final covariate model 
described in the LENA project (“run051”) has been used to perform population modelling of the PK of 
enalaprilat. It was shown that administration of enalapril ODMT to children from birth to adolescents 
provides overall exposures matching those expected in adults taking into account both the 
target/maintenance dose and the initial dose (as low as 0.01 mg/kg/day).
Thus, uncertainties and limitations that initially appeared were considered resolved.
3.4.  Unfavourable effects
In total 86 children with HF received enalapril ODMT for up to 1 year in clinical studies with Aqumeldi. 
As such the data are considered limited. Data on the use of Aqumeldi in children below 1 month of age 
in the clinical studies is scarce (n=4) and this information was included in the product information. 
WP08:
In study WP08 no adverse events (AE) were reported in 11 patients (34,5%). Altogether 42 AE were 
reported in 21 of the 32 children included in the study (65,5%). Most frequently observed AEs were 
pyrexia in 4 patients (12.5%), nasopharyngitis and rash in 3 children each (9.4%).
WP09:
In study WP09 no AE were reported in 18 (25,7%) patients. In 52 of the 70 (74.3%) patients enrolled 
into this study 118 AEs occurred. Only 7 AEs (5.9%), were assessed as possibly, probably or certainly 
related with investigational medicinal product (IMP) intake. Eight (6.8%) AEs were of severe intensity, 
32 (27.1%) AEs were of moderate intensity and 78 AEs (66.1%) of mild intensity. Most frequently 
observed AEs were cardiac operation (15 AEs,12.7%), pyrexia (14 AEs, 11.9%), and rhinitis (9 AEs, 
7.6%).
WP10:
Of the 102 patients enrolled in WP08 and WP09 trials 86 continued into the WP10 trial. The primary 
objective of WP10 trial was to demonstrate the safety of enalapril ODMTs. 
The administered enalapril ODMT doses were well tolerated. Thirty-seven (43.02%) patients did not 
experience any adverse event during their study participation. In 49 of the 86 (56.98%) patients 
enrolled into this study 137 AEs occurred. Six of these events were classified as medical events as they 
occurred in 3 patients that were not or no longer under IMP (tonsillopharyngitis, 2 x prolonged 
mechanical ventilation in the same patient, vomiting and diarrhoea, running nose and neutropenia). 
Only 1 adverse event (0.76%) (intermittent dizziness and blurred vision when sitting or standing up) 
was rated possibly related with IMP intake by the investigator. All other 130 adverse events had no 
causal relationship with the intake of study medication. Eleven adverse events (8.40%) were of severe 
intensity, 57 AEs (43.51%) were of moderate intensity, but also 2 of the 6 medical events (33.33%) 
were of moderate intensity. 63 AEs (48.09%) were of mild intensity and 4 (66.66%) medical events 
were also classified as mild. Most frequently observed AEs were epistaxis (8 AEs in 1 patient), rhinitis 
(7 AEs in 5 patients), upper respiratory tract infections (7 AEs in 7 patients), and cardiac failure (7 AEs 
in 2 patients). Eighty eight (67.18%) AEs occurred in patients who were below one year of age when 
they joined the previous WP08 or WP09 study.

By reviewing the acceptability and palatability of enalapril minitablets, it was found that the majority of 
patients had a positive experience when taking both the 0.25 mg and 1 mg enalapril ODMT.
Serious Adverse Events (SAE)
A small number of SAE was recorded in clinical studies with Aqumeldi.
No deaths occurred in the assessed studies.
In study WP08 – One SAE was reported (syncope due to hypotension in the context of a gastro-
intestinal infection and hospitalisation for observational purposes) that was considered unrelated to 
IMP intake.
In study WP09 - five SAEs without causal relationship with the IMP occurred; all but one (paresis right 
hemidiaphragm after cardiac surgery) resolved without sequela.
.
In Study WP10 – 7 safety adverse events were recorded were assessed as being without causal 
relationship with IMP administration. Four Serious Medical Events occurred in 2 patients who were not 
or no longer under IMP when the Serious Medical Event occurred.
No rehospitalisation due to HF including the need for heart transplantation was reported.
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects

Neonates were not included in the study WP08 since DCM generally does not occur in 
newborns but develops in infancy. The younger population was therefore investigated in a 
study of children with CHD in WP09. This study recruited paediatric patients aged from birth to 
less than 6 years, excluding neonates born at less than 35 weeks to obtain paediatric PK data 
of enalapril ODMTs, to describe the dose exposure in young children with CHD.

In the cohort of children that were included in WP08 and WP09, half were already on ACEI and 
in most of them the enalapril-ODMTs were not up-titrated after inclusion. Thus, the effects of 
increasing doses of ACEI on pharmacodynamic parameters could not be reliably estimated in 
all the proposed population. 


Pharmacodynamic and safety parameters were analysed in a descriptive fashion as secondary 
endpoints.  
Based on the presented bioequivalence study(ies) against the reference product, Renitec®, 
which demonstrated bioequivalence between the 1 mg strength, and taking in to account the 
availability of in vivo data for the 0.25 mg strength from paediatric clinical studies WP08 and 
WP09, these in vivo data were considered to be sufficient to support the approval of the 0.25 
mg strength without the need for further data. The bioequivalence study was conducted with 
the 1 mg ODMT strength (higher strength) and confirmed equivalent pharmacokinetics to the 
reference product (Renitec® 2 x 5 mg tablets). A biowaiver for lower, 0.25 mg strength, based 
on the bioequivalence established for the 1.0 mg strength, was not agreed upon since the 
requirements of the Guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 
Rev. 1/ Corr ** ), with respect to the proportionality of the ratio of excipients amounts to the 
active, different manufacturing processes for the two strengths, and pharmacokinetic linearity 
were  not fulfilled. Also BCS-based biowaiver considering enalapril is a BCS class III drug 
substance was not agreed as according to ICH M9 Guideline, for BCS Class III drugs, all of the 
excipients should be qualitatively the same and quantitatively similar and the BCS biowaiver 
requires the same strength for test and reference products which was not met. However, the

CHMP considered the results of both clinical studies, W08 and W09, were conducted using both 
the 1 mg and the 0.25 mg strengths, where the availability of in vivo data for the 0.25 mg 
strength was considered to be sufficient to support the approval of the 0.25 mg strength 
without the need for further data. 

The proposed indication, i.e. treatment of heart failure in children from birth to 18 years, is 
based on an extrapolation approach based on PK bridging, targeting the equivalent systemic 
exposure to that achieved during the treatment of adults. However, there are uncertainties 
with respect to the safety (and posology) in children < 30 days of age. The popPK model 
documentation was not considered to be sufficiently detailed and it was unclear if the current 
model is relevant for simulating exposure in patients younger than 28 days. In particular, the 
equation describing clearance adjusted for the maturation appears unphysiological with the 
value of CL drastically approaching the value 0 L/h with decreasing age. An alternative model 
accounting for a basal ability to eliminate enalapril in new-borns (such as a slope-intercept 
model) would be more physiological for the maturation function. It is not only the median, but 
also the 5-95th of AUC and Cmax in patients 1-30 days of age that would need to reasonably 
overlap with observed data in older age groups for an extrapolation based on PK to be 
acceptable. If the exposure is simulated to be higher in 1 day old patients, the safety 
consequences should be discussed. The applicant provided the full popPK analysis report, 
including diagnostic plots (goodness of fit, virtual predictive checks), and updated the 
maturation function for clearance.  The applicant provided analysis of  potential safety issues in 
children< 30 days of age. The findings published by Ku et al. [Pediatr Cardiol. 2017 Jan; 
38(1): 155-161], which demonstrated severe adverse effects of enalapril particularly in infants 
<30 days of age were discussed and a comprehensive literature search for ACEi/ARB exposure 
in infants <30 days of age was performed. The scarcity of subjects <30 days in clinical studies 
(n=4) was reflected in the SmPC sections 4.4 and 5.1. This is mainly due to the fact that many 
cases of nephrotoxic effects of RAAS inhibitors (acute renal failure, renal tubular dysplasia) 
have been reported in foetuses and newborns exposed to RAAS inhibitors during the second 
and third trimesters of pregnancy in humans. Ku et al. (2017) examined the safety of enalapril 
in young infants and found that treatment in the first 30 days of life led to severe adverse 
effects (death, hyperkalaemia, elevated serum creatinine and hypotension) in up to 20 % of 
infants. The mechanisms involved in ACE inhibitor-induced acute renal failure are reduced renal 
blood flow and increased renal vascular resistance with decreased glomerular filtration rate at 
birth in combination with hypotension and decreased renal elimination of enalapril rendering 
young infants particularly sensitive to ACE inhibitor-induced renal failure. In the submitted 
responses the applicant has produced data that allowed to state that the final covariate model 
described in the LENA project (“run051”) has been used to perform population modelling of the 
PK of enalaprilat. It was shown that administration of enalapril ODMT to children from birth to 
adolescents provides overall exposures matching those expected in adults taking into account 
both the target/maintenance dose and the initial dose (as low as 0.01 mg/kg/day). Thus, 
uncertainties and limitations that initially appeared have been resolved.

3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects
The mechanism of action of enalapril and its potential pharmacodynamic interactions are believed to be 
similar in adults and paediatric patients. The mechanism of action of enalapril is therefore primarily via 
the suppression of the RAAS. Enalapril has been subject to both dose-finding and efficacy studies in 
children with hypertension or HF and is licensed for use in hypertension.
This application for the treatment of heart failure in children from birth to less than 18 years relies in 
part on the results of pre-clinical tests and clinical trials for the reference product (RENITEC®) 
enalapril maleate tablets and in part on new clinical data. The new data were generated within the EU 
LENA project that was aiming at developing the age appropriate formulation for the use in children and 
at extrapolation from adults to children of all ages based on new PK data targeting a similar exposure 
in paediatric patients as in adults. The generated PD/efficacy data in the current program were 
supplemented by the published data on the (off-label) use of enalapril in children. 
The LENA project generated core scientific data from four clinical trials WP07, WP08, WP09 and WP10. 
WP07 generated clinical data for enalapril orodispersible mini-tablets (ODMTs) in healthy volunteers. 
WP08, WP09 and WP10 generated clinical data for enalapril ODMTs in children with HF. As the 
pathophysiology of heart failure in children is considered to be similar to that in adults with chronic 
heart failure caused by DCM, the applicant conducted a PK bridging study (WP08) in paediatric patients 
with DCM aged 1 month to less than 18 years. The primary objective of this study was to obtain 
paediatric PK data of enalapril ODMTs to describe the dose exposure in paediatric DCM patients in 
order to identify the doses that lead to an equivalent systemic exposure to that achieved during the 
treatment of adults.
Neonates were not included in the study WP08 since DCM generally does not occur in newborns but 
develops in infancy. The younger population was therefore investigated in a study of children with 
congenital heart disease (CHD) (WP09). This recruited paediatric patients aged from birth to less than 
6 years, excluding neonates born at less than 35 weeks to obtain paediatric PK data of enalapril 
ODMTs, to describe the dose exposure in young children with CHD.
The primary objectives of these studies were achieved. 
In the cohort of children that were included in WP08 and WP09, half were already on ACEI and in most 
of them the enalapril-ODMTs were not up-titrated after inclusion. Thus, the effects of increasing doses 
of ACEI on pharmacodynamic parameters could not be reliably estimated in all the proposed 
population. 
Pharmacodynamic and safety parameters were analysed in a descriptive fashion as secondary 
endpoints.  Based on the presented bioequivalence study(ies) against the reference product, Renitec®, 
which demonstrated bioequivalence between the 1 mg strength, and taking in to account the 
availability of in vivo data for the 0.25 mg strength from paediatric clinical studies WP08 and WP09, 
these in vivo data were considered to be sufficient to support the approval of the 0.25 mg strength 
without the need for further data. The CHMP considered the results of both clinical studies, W08 and 
W09, were conducted using both the 1 mg and the 0.25 mg strengths, where the availability of in vivo 
data for the 0.25 mg strength was considered to be sufficient to support the approval of the 0.25 mg 
strength without the need for further data.
In addition, the proposed indication, i.e. treatment of heart failure in children from birth to 18 years, is 
supported by an extrapolation approach based on PK bridging, targeting the equivalent systemic

exposure to that achieved during the treatment of adults. However, there were uncertainties with 
respect to the posology and safety in children < 30 days of age: the popPK model documentation was 
not considered to be sufficiently detailed and it was unclear if the current model was relevant for 
simulating exposure in patients younger than 28 days. The findings published by Ku et al. [Pediatr 
Cardiol. 2017 Jan; 38(1): 155-161], which demonstrated severe adverse effects of enalapril 
particularly in infants <30 days of age were analised and discussed as well as a comprehensive 
literature search for ACEi/ARB exposure in infants <30 days of age was performed. This is mainly due 
to the fact that many cases of nephrotoxic effects of RAAS inhibitors (acute renal failure, renal tubular 
dysplasia) have been reported in foetuses and newborns exposed to RAAS inhibitors during the second 
and third trimesters of pregnancy in humans. Ku et al. (2017) examined the safety of enalapril in 
young infants and found that treatment in the first 30 days of life led to severe adverse effects (death, 
hyperkalaemia, elevated serum creatinine and hypotension) in up to 20 % of infants. The mechanisms 
involved in ACE inhibitor-induced acute renal failure are reduced renal blood flow and increased renal 
vascular resistance with decreased glomerular filtration rate at birth in combination with hypotension 
and decreased renal elimination of enalapril rendering young infants particularly sensitive to ACE 
inhibitor-induced renal failure.
The applicant produced data that allowed to state that the final covariate model described in the LENA 
project (“run051”) has been used to perform population modelling of the PK of enalaprilat. It was 
shown that administration of enalapril ODMT to children from birth to adolescents provides overall 
exposures matching those expected in adults taking into account both the target/maintenance dose 
and the initial dose (as low as 0.01 mg/kg/day). Thus, uncertainties and limitations that initially 
appeared have been resolved.
The proposed earlier contraindications for “Paediatric patients with pre-existing liver abnormalities” or 
“Children < 1 month of age” were not considered appropriate considering that the lack of data alone 
should not lead to a contraindication. Taking also into consideration that “liver abnormalities” 
represents a very broad array of clinical conditions, the applicant introduced a warning statement in 
sections 4.2 and 4.4 that no data is available for children with pre-existing liver conditions, that 
children (any age) with hepatic impairment should only be treated with enalapril under very strict 
monitoring and that treatment of children below the age of 1 month is not recommended should justify 
which safety issues with treatment of patients with liver abnormalities in the entire paediatric 
population are justifying a contraindication, taking into consideration both that “liver abnormalities” 
represents a very broad array of clinical conditions. Also, the scarcity of subjects <30 days in clinical 
studies (n=4) should be reflected in SmPC section 4.4 and section 5.1.
Having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference 
medicinal product, no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the 
product information currently at this stage of the procedure.
Safety of enalapril ODMTs was studied in WP08, WP09 and for a period of up to 10 months in WP10. 
Safety observations made in the reporting period of WP10 showed that enalapril ODMTs was well 
tolerated. The adverse event considered as having a possible causality was mild (hypotensive reaction 
to enalapril). No SAEs and SUSARs occurred. No deaths occurred. 
Other safety parameters studied in WP10 comprised blood pressure, renal monitoring, Ross score, 
echocardiography, ECG and safety laboratory tests. Mean arterial pressure slightly increased in every 
age group throughout the duration of the study except for children between the ages of 6 and 12 
months where a minor decrease was seen. Statistically significant differences between start and end of 
the study were observed in serum levels of BUN and creatinine in the youngest age group. However, 
these were minor and considered as not clinically relevant, furthermore the potential risks with long-

term treatment of small children have been discussed by the applicant and no new risk has been 
identified.
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks
There is an unmet medical need for a licensed medicinal product for children with HF that would be 
possible to be administered with age-appropriate formulations. The Expert Group Meeting on Paediatric 
Heart Failure organised at the European Medicines Agency in 2010 considered enalapril a first-line 
treatment for CHF in children. It was concluded in the report from this meeting that PK studies should 
be conducted in children to achieve systemic exposures similar to those in adults. 
Enalapril is licenced in adults for the treatment of HF and the mechanism of action of enalapril and its 
potential PD interactions are believed to be similar in adults and paediatric patients. This application for 
the treatment of heart failure in children from birth to less than 18 years relies in part on the results of 
pre-clinical tests and clinical trials for the reference product and in part on new clinical data. 
Extrapolation from adults to children of all ages is based on new PK data (generated within LENA 
project) targeting a similar exposure in paediatric patients as in adults. Considering that the indication 
also covers pre-term neonates and term neonates a justification was analysed and accepted that the 
extrapolation approach is relevant also for this age group considering potential differences in PK/PD 
relationship and safety compared to adults. The applicant demonstrated clearly that the available PK 
data is sufficient to establish the bridge between adults and the youngest children. The age appropriate 
formulation for the use in children were developed within the LENA project (ODMTs). The generated 
PD/efficacy data in the current program were supplemented by the published data on the (off-label) 
use of enalapril in PHF.
In the submitted responses the applicant has produced data that allowed to state that the final 
covariate model described in the LENA project (“run051”) has been used to perform population 
modelling of the PK of enalaprilat. It was shown that administration of enalapril ODMT to children from 
birth to adolescents provides overall exposures matching those expected in adults taking into account 
both the target/maintenance dose and the initial dose (as low as 0.01 mg/kg/day).
Safety of enalapril ODMTs was studied in PHF within LENA project WP08, WP09 and up to 10 months in 
WP10. Safety observations made in the reporting period showed that the enalapril ODMTs was well 
tolerated with only one adverse event that was considered as having a possible causality that was 
mild. There were no deaths reported. No drug-related SAEs and thus no SUSARs occurred.
New clinical data in children were obtained within WP08, WP09 and WP10 and support the 
extrapolation of efficacy and safety of the product for use in children. Additional  justification was 
requested, taking into account the unmet medical need for this product as well as enalapril’s off-label 
use in children.  If enalapril ODMT are suitable for neonates was initially not clear.  The applicant 
demonstrated that the available PK data are sufficient to establish the bridge between adults and the 
youngest children. In particular there were uncertainties with respect to the posology and safety in 
children < 30 days of age: the popPK model documentation was not considered to be sufficiently 
detailed and it was unclear if the current model is relevant for simulating exposure in patients younger 
than 28 days and the findings published by Ku et al. [Pediatr Cardiol. 2017 Jan; 38(1): 155-161], 
which demonstrated severe adverse effects of enalapril particularly in infants <30 days of age were 
discussed. 
The proposed earlier contraindication for “Paediatric patients with pre-existing liver abnormalities” or: 
“Children < 1 month of age with liver abnormalities” were not considered appropriate considering that 
lack of data alone should not lead to a contraindication. Taking also into consideration that “liver 
abnormalities” represents a very broad array of clinical conditions, the applicant  introduced a warning 
Assessment report 
EMA/481595/2023 
Page 83/85
statements in sections 4.2 and 4.4 that that no data is available for children with pre-existing liver 
conditions, that children (any age) with hepatic impairment should only be treated with enalapril under 
very strict monitoring and that treatment of children below the age of 1 month is not recommended.
The safety of enalapril in neonates was of particular concern during the assessment. Enalapril is used 
to treat hypertension and congestive heart failure in infants (approved in USA from 1 month of age). 
The study by Ku et al 2017 has shown that from a cohort of 887,910 infants, 662 (0.07%) infants were 
identified who were exposed to enalapril during their initial hospitalization. Enalapril was used in 0.03% 
to 0.09% infants from 1997 to 2002 and in 0.07% to 0.10% infants from 2003 to 2012 – thus the use 
remained relatively constant. A total of 142 infants (21%) experienced the composite outcome of 
death (3), hypotension requiring pressors (25), hyperkalaemia (83), or elevated serum creatinine 
during exposure to enalapril (34). Infants <30 days postnatal age at first exposure were more likely to 
experience hyperkalaemia, elevated serum creatinine, and hypotension. Longer durations of exposure 
to enalapril were associated with increased odds of hyperkalaemia and death, but not elevated 
creatinine or hypotension. Approximately one in five infants exposed to enalapril experienced at least 
one AE during treatment, with hyperkalaemia being the most common AE. Among infants without 
congenital anomalies such as congenital heart disease, death during enalapril therapy was extremely 
rare. Elimination of enalapril and its active metabolite enalaprilat is primarily renal, reduced kidney 
function leading to increased exposures could potentially explain why infants age <30 days are at 
increased risk for other AEs (of which hypotension is the earliest and most often reported AE). In a 
study of enalapril and enalaprilat pharmacokinetics in 12 subjects age 10 days to 6.5 years with 
congestive heart failure, mean area under the curve values of active metabolite per enalapril dose 
normalized for body weight and body surface area were fivefold greater in the three subjects age <20 
days compared to subjects >20 days old (Nakamura et al 1994). This suggests that infants <20 days 
old would require a significantly lower dose than their older counterparts. Hypotension, acute renal 
failure, decreased urine output, and azotaemia associated with use of enalapril have been reported in 
preterm and term infants (Ku et al 2017). Therefore a warning was introduced in section 4.4 of the 
SmPC that AQUMELDI is not recommended in children in indications other than heart failure, that 
caution is advised in children below 1 month of age as they may be very sensitive to the medical 
product and that data on the use of Aqumeldi in children below 1 month of age in the clinical studies is 
scarce (n=4). Any signs of adverse events and electrolytes should be closely monitored.
The applicant applied initially for registration of both enalapril ODMT strengths: 0.25mg and 1 mg. The 
1 mg strength was withdrawn during the procedure. In conclusion, the CHMP concluded that the 
benefit-risk balance of enalapril 0.25 mg ODMTs is considered positive.
3.7.  Conclusions
The overall benefit/risk balance of Aqumeldi is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’.

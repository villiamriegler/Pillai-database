  Description 
A  phase  II,  observer-blind  follow-up  study  with  two  groups  to  assess  the  reactogenicity  and 
immunogenicity  of  GlaxoSmithKline  (GSK)  Biologicals’  10-valent  pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccine 
(GSK1024850A), when either given as a booster dose (at 20-23 months of age) in children previously 
primed with three doses of the study vaccine, or when given as a two-dose catch-up immunization (at 
18-21 and 20-23 months of age) in unprimed children, all previously enrolled in the 10PN-PD-DIT-005 
primary vaccination study. The study was conducted in Chile. 
  Methods 
•  Objective(s) 
Primary: 
• 
To  assess  the  reactogenicity  of  study  vaccines  in  terms  of  the  occurrence  of  adverse  events 
with intensity grade 3. 
Secondary: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To assess the safety and reactogenicity of GSK Biologicals’ 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccine after the administration of any vaccine dose. 
To  assess,  12  to  15  months  after  completion  of  the  3-dose  primary  vaccination  course,  the 
persistence  of  antibodies  induced  by  GSK  Biologicals’  10-valent  pneumococcal  conjugate 
vaccine. 
To  assess,  one  month  post-booster,  the  immunogenicity  of  GSK  Biologicals’  10-valent 
pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccine  in  subjects  primed  with  GSK  Biologicals’  10-valent 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. 
To assess, one month after the second catch-up dose, the immunogenicity of GSK Biologicals’ 
10- valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in subjects primed with hepatitis A vaccine. 
To assess, three months after the hepatitis A dose, the immunogenicity of hepatitis A vaccine, 
when  co-administered  with  DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib  vaccine,  in  subjects  unprimed  with  hepatitis  A 
vaccine. 
•  Study design 
Observer-blind follow-up study with two groups: 
• 
Primed  10V  group  (referred  as  ‘HAV-Pn’  in  result  tables  and  figures):  approximately  120 
subjects received hepatitis A + DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib (dose 1) and 10Pn-PD-DiT (dose 2). 
•  Unprimed  10V  group  (referred  as  ‘Pn-Pn’  in  result  tables  and  figures):  approximately  120 
subjects  received  10Pn-PD-DiT  +  DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib  (catch-up  dose  1)  and  10Pn-PD-DiT 
(catch-up dose 2). 
Booster  vaccination  study  of  the  primary  vaccination  study  10PN-PD-DIT-005  (106208)  at  18-21  and 
20-23 months of age, with at least 2 months between the 2 vaccinations. 
Two blood samples were collected: prior to dose 1 and one month post-dose 2. 
•  Study population /Sample size 
Diagnosis and criteria for inclusion: 
•  Male or female between, and including 18-21 months of age at the time of vaccination. 
•  Subjects  who  received  3  doses  of  study  or  control  vaccines  in  the  primary  vaccination  study 
10PNPD- DIT-005 (106208). 
•  Written informed consent obtained from the parents or guardians of the subject. 
• 
Free  of  obvious  health  problems  as  established  by  medical  history  and  clinical  examination 
before entering into the study.

Sample size 
The  sample  size  was  contingent  on  the  number  of  subjects  eligible  after  the  primary  course.  In  the 
primary  vaccination  study  10PN-PD-DIT-005  (106208),  240  subjects  (120  subjects  per  group)  were 
planned  to  be  enrolled.  Assuming  that  approximately  10%  of  these  subjects  might  not  enter  the 
booster  study,  one  could  consider  approximately  216  subjects  receiving  the  booster  doses  (108 
subjects in each group). 
•

Incidence  of  solicited  and/or  unsolicited  local  and  general  adverse  events  during  the  31-day 
postvaccination  follow-up  period  was  calculated  with  95%  CI,  after  each  vaccine  dose  and 
overall, according to the type of adverse event, the intensity and relationship to vaccination; 
Incidence  of  each  local  and  each  general  solicited  adverse  events  reported  during  the  4-day 
postvaccination  follow-up  period  was  calculated  with  95%  CI,  after  each  vaccine  dose  and 
overall, according to the type of adverse events, the intensity and relationship to vaccination; 
The  percentages  of  subjects  with  an  unsolicited  adverse  events  reported  within  the  31-day 
postvaccination  follow-up  period  were  summarized  according  to  the  Medical  Dictionary  for 
Regulatory  Activities  (MedDRA),  with  95%  CI  according  to  the  intensity  and  relationship  to 
vaccination; 
Prevalence  of  concomitant  antipyretic/medication  during  the  4-day  post-vaccination  follow-up 
period was computed with 95% CI, after each vaccine dose and overall; 
•  Serious  adverse  events  (SAEs),  large  swelling  reactions  and  withdrawals  due  to  adverse 
event(s)  reported  during  the  active  phase  of  the  study  (Visit  1  to  Visit  3)  were  described  in 
detail; 
•  SAEs  recorded  throughout  the  entire  study  period  starting  from  Visit  1  up  to  the  end  of  the 
extended 6 months safety follow-up were described in detail. 
Immunogenicity: 
Descriptive analyses: 
•  Geometric mean antibody concentrations/titres (GMCs/GMTs) with 95% CIs were tabulated for 
each appropriate serotype/antigen at each applicable blood sampling time point. 
•  Seropositivity rates with exact 95% CIs were calculated for each appropriate serotype/antigen 
• 
at each applicable blood sampling time point. 
The distribution of antibody concentrations/titres was displayed by using tables and/or reverse 
cumulative  distribution  curves  for  each  appropriate  serotype/antigen  at  each  applicable  blood 
sampling time point. 
•  Geometric mean of ratios of opsonophagocytic titres/ELISA antibody concentrations with 95% 
CIs  was  tabulated  for  each  appropriate  pneumococcal  serotype  at  each  applicable  blood 
sampling time point. 
  Results 
•  Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Demography: 
Out  of  the  163  enrolled  subjects,  155  completed  the  study.  The  mean  age  at  the  first  visit  (dose  1) 
was 18.3 months. Overall, 50.9% of the subjects were female and 99.4% were White/Caucasian. 
• 
Efficacy results 
Immunogenicity: 
The  analysis  was  performed  on  the  ATP  cohort  of  antibody  persistence  or  on  the  ATP  cohort  of 
immunogenicity  according  to  the  objective.  Data  on  OPA  analysis  and  the  immune  response  to  the 
hepatitis A vaccine  need to be interpreted with caution because of the relatively small sample size of 
the groups. The results are summarized in Table 31 and 32 below.  
Persistence: 
At  least  88.9%  of  subjects  in  the  HAV-Pn  group  remained  seropositive  (antibody 
concentrations  ≥  0.05  µg/mL)  to  each  of  the  vaccine  pneumococcal  serotypes  indicative  for 
persistence  of  the  antibodies  to  the  pneumococcal  vaccine  antigens  15  to  18  months  after 
completion of the three-dose primary vaccination course. 
Before administration of dose 1 in the booster vaccination study, the percentage of subjects in 
the  10Pn  group  with  opsonophagocytic  activity  ≥  8  was  at  least  86.4%  for  serotypes  7F,  9V, 
14 and 23F and between 38.9% and 65.0% for serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B and 18C. 
All  subjects  in  the  Pn-Pn  group  remained  seropositive  for  antibodies  against  hepatitis  A 
indicative for persistence of the immune response to the hepatitis A vaccine 15 to 18 months 
after completion of the three-dose primary vaccination course (data not shown in this AR). 
Booster response to the pneumococcal vaccine: 
One  month  following  the  2-dose  catch-up  vaccination  in  the  Pn-Pn  group,  the  percentage  of 
subjects with pneumococcal antibody concentrations ≥ 0.2 µg/mL was high (over 94.0%) and 
in  the  same  range  compared  to  the  HAV-Pn  group  for  most  serotypes  except  serotype  6B

(84.3% in the Pn-Pn group and 97.4% in the HAV-Pn group). The antibody GMCs  were lower 
for serotypes 1, 5, 6B, 9V, 14, 19F and 23F in the Pn-Pn group compared to the HAV-Pn group 
(no  overlap  of  95%  CIs).  There  was  also  a  trend  for  lower  GMCs  for  the  other  vaccine 
pneumococcal serotypes in the Pn-Pn group compared to the HAV-Pn group.  
For the HAV-Pn group, for each of the vaccine pneumococcal serotypes, one month postdose 2, 
at least 96.2% of subjects had opsonophagocytic activity ≥8, except for serotype 6B (91.7%). 
One  month  post-dose  2,  at  least  95.2%  of  the  subjects  in  the  Pn-Pn  group  had 
opsonophagocytic activity ≥ 8 except for serotypes 6B (48.1%), 1 (52.0%) and 5 (84.0%) and 
this percentage was lower for serotypes 1 and 6B compared to the HAV-Pn group (no overlap 
of 95% CIs). The OPA GMTs were lower for serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B and 19F in the Pn-Pn group 
compared to the HAV-Pn group (no overlap of 95% CIs).

Assessor’s comment: The OPA GMTs to serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6B and 19F after two catch-up doses were 
considerably  lower  than  the  responses  to  a  single  booster  dose  in  the  previously  primed  infants.  The 
percentage  of  subjects  with  OPA  titers  ≥8  were  also  low  for  serotypes  1  and  6B.  Similarly  low  OPA 
responses  to  serotypes  1  and  5  were  seen  in  study  013,  assessed  in  the  original  MAA.  The  OPA 
responder rates after the primary three doses in group HAV-Pn were considerably higher for serotypes 
1,  5  and  6B  compared  to  the  response  rate  after  2  catch-up  doses  the  Pn-Pn  group.  However,  the 
sample  size  is  small  and  the  95%  CI  are  wide  in  all  cases,  which  preclude  any  firm  conclusions.  The 
MAH already has a FUM to evaluate the booster response following a 2-dose catch-up vaccination. 
•  Safety results 
Safety/reactogenicity: 
The safety analysis was performed on the Total vaccinated cohort. 
Redness in the HAV-Pn group and pain in the Pn-Pn group were the most frequently reported grade 3 
solicited  local  adverse  events  (maximum  15.3%)  whereas  pain  was  the  most  frequently  reported  in 
both groups, regardless the injection site (51.5% and 66.0%, respectively). 
No  increase  in  the  overall  incidence  of  local  adverse  events  was  observed  in  the  Pn-Pn  group  with 
consecutive doses of the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine during the catch-up vaccination course. 
The observed percentage of doses followed by at least one unsolicited adverse event, classified by the 
MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and Preferred Term, was 35.3% in the HAV-Pn group and 41.3% 
in  the  Pn-Pn  group.  The  most  frequently  reported  unsolicited  adverse  event  in  both  groups  was 
bronchitis.

•  MAH’s conclusions 
•  Redness in the HAV-Pn group and pain in the Pn-Pn group were the most frequently reported 
grade 3 solicited local adverse events (maximum 15.3%). A low overall/dose incidence of most 
grade 3 solicited general adverse events (reported following maximum 5 doses and 12 doses in 
the  HAV-Pn  and  Pn-Pn  group,  respectively)  as  well  as  those  assessed  by  the  investigator  as 
causally  related  to  vaccination  was  observed  in  both  groups.  The  incidence  of  grade  3 
unsolicited adverse events was low in both groups (reported following 4 doses and 3 doses in 
the  HAV-Pn  and  Pn-Pn  group,  respectively)  and  none  of  these  was  considered  as  causally 
related to vaccination. 
•  No  fatal  SAEs  were  reported.  One  subject  of  the  HAV-Pn  group  reported  a  SAE  during  the 
active phase of the study. The SAE was assessed by the investigator not to be causally related 
to the vaccination and resolved without sequelae. 
• 
•  A  high  persistence  of  the  immune  response  to  the  pneumococcal  vaccine  antigens  and  the 
hepatitis  A  vaccine  15  to  18  months  after  completion  of  the  three-dose  primary  vaccination 
course was observed in the Pn group and HAV group, respectively. 
The  immune  response  to  the  10Pn-PD-DiT  vaccine,  one  month  following  the  2-dose  catch-up 
vaccination in the Pn-Pn group, was in the same range compared to the response observed one 
month  following  booster  vaccination  in  group  HAV-Pn  for  most  serotypes  except  serotypes  1 
and  6B  for  which  a  lower  percentage  of  subjects  with  opsonophagocytic  activity  ≥8  was 
observed.  All  subjects  in  each  group  had  measurable  antibodies  against  protein  D  (≥100 
EL.U/mL). 
Three months after the administration of the hepatitis A vaccine in the HAV-Pn group, 94.7% 
of subjects were seropositive.

• 
The 10Pn-PD-DiT booster vaccination following a 3-dose primary vaccination course as well as 
a 2-dose catch-up vaccination in Chilean children in the second year of life were shown to be 
generally well tolerated and immunogenic. 
Assessor’s comments: See also specific comment on immunogenicity above. The MAH’s safety 
conclusions are endorsed. The relatively low OPA responses to some serotypes, as seen in the 
original  MAA,  enhances  the  concern  that  two  catch-up  doses  may  require  a  booster  dose  to 
provide  protection.  The  MAH  has  a  post-approval  commitment  to  study  booster  vaccinations 
following the catch-up schedule.

  Methods 
•  Objective(s) 
Primary: 
• 
To  demonstrate  that  a  booster  dose  of  GSK  Biologicals  10-valent  pneumococcal  conjugate 
vaccine is non-inferior to Prevenar when co-administered with DTPw-HBV/Hib and OPV or IPV 
vaccines, in terms of post-immunization booster reactions with rectal temperature > 39.0°C in 
children at 12 to 18 months of age.

•  Study population /Sample size 
Diagnosis and criteria for inclusion: 
•  Subjects  for  whom  the  investigator  believed  that  their  parents/guardians  could  and  would 
comply  with  the  requirements  of  the  protocol  (e.g.,  completion  of  the  diary  cards,  return  for 
follow-up visits). 
•  Male  or  female  between,  and  including,  12-18  months  of  age  at  the  time  of  the  booster 
vaccination. 
•  Male or female who previously participated in study 10PN-PD-DIT-012 (107007) and received 
three doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. 
•  Written informed consent obtained from the parent or guardian of the subject.  
• 
Free  of  obvious  health  problems  as  established  by  medical  history  and  clinical  examination 
before entering into the study. 
The  sample  size  was  contingent  on  the  number  of  subjects  eligible  after  the  primary  vaccination 
course.  In  the  primary  study  10PN-PD-DIT-012  (107007),  800  subjects  (600  in  10Pn-PD-DiT  group 
and 200 in Prevenar group) were planned to be enrolled. Assuming that approximately 15% of these 
subjects  would  not  enter  the  booster  study,  one  could  consider  approximately  680  subjects  (510  in 
10Pn-PD-DiT group and 170 in Prevenar group) receiving the booster dose. 
• 
Treatments 
The vaccination schedules are summarised below. All subjects received a single booster vaccination of 
10-PD-DiT (Synflorix) or Prevenar at 12-18 months of age.

Efficacy results 
Persistence of antibodies against pneumococcal antigens and opsonophagocytic activity 
A decline in antibody GMCs was observed in all groups in the time period between primary and booster 
vaccination for each of the vaccine pneumococcal serotypes for which subjects were primed (Tables 35 
and 36). 
Booster immune response to pneumococcal antigens 
For each of the pneumococcal serotypes common to both vaccines, one month after the booster dose 
robust booster immune responses were observed in both groups for all serotypes (Tables 35 and 36). 
Immune responses to co-administered vaccines 
Seropositivity/seroprotection/booster  vaccine  response  rates  for  antibodies  against  the  antigens 
contained  in  the  co-administered  DTPw-HBV/Hib  and  OPV  vaccines  were  in  line  with  previous 
observations for these co-administered vaccines (Data not shown in this AR).

•  Safety results 
Confirmatory inferential analysis: 
The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  reached  as  the  upper  limit  of  the  95%  CI  (5.59%)  of  the 
difference  between  groups  (10Pn  minus  Prev)  in  terms  of  the  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  fever 
with rectal temperature > 39.0°C was below the pre-defined limit of 10.3% (P-value < 0.1%). Thus a 
booster dose of the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine did not induce more fever with rectal temperature > 39.0°C 
than Prevenar when co-administered with DTPw-HBV/Hib and OPV or IPV vaccines (Table 18). 
Descriptive analysis: 
6-10-14 weeks + 12-18 months of age schedule: 
After  booster  vaccination,  85.7%  of  the  subjects  in  the  10PnEPI  group  and  83.9%  of  the  subjects  in 
the PrevEPI group reported at least one adverse event (solicited or unsolicited, local or general). 
The  most  frequently  reported  solicited  local  adverse  event  was  pain  in  both  groups  and  the  most 
frequently reported solicited general adverse event was irritability in both groups (Table 2). 
Large swelling reactions were reported by 5 subjects (4 subjects in the 10PnEPI group and 1 subject in 
the  PrevEPI  group).  Four  of  these  large  swelling  reactions  were  reported  at  the  DTPw-HBV/Hib 
injection site and one at the 10Pn-PD-DiT injection site. All were local or diffuse swelling reactions not 
involving adjacent joints that resolved without sequelae. 
No cases of grade 3 fever (rectal temperature > 40° C) were reported in any of the groups (Table 3).  
Low incidences of grade 3 solicited general adverse events, assessed by the investigator to be causally 
related to vaccination, were reported in both groups (maximum 4.3%). 
The  observed  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  at  least  one  unsolicited  adverse  event  within  31  days 
after booster vaccination was 8.9% in the 10PnEPI group and 9.7% in the PrevEPI group. Up to 0.7% 
of  the  subjects  reported  at  least  one  unsolicited  adverse  event  with  grade  3  intensity.  None  of  the

reported  unsolicited  adverse  events  were  assessed  by  the  investigator  to  be  causally  related  to 
vaccination. 
2-4-6 months + 12-18 months of age schedule: 
After  booster  vaccination,  a  higher  incidence  of  adverse  events  (solicited  or  unsolicited,  local  or 
general) was reported in both groups compared to the incidence reported in the 6-10-14 weeks + 12- 
18  months  schedule.  99.3%  of  the  subjects  in  the  10Pn246  group  and  96.9%  of  the  subjects  in  the 
Prev246 group reported at least one adverse event (solicited or unsolicited, local or general). 
The most frequently reported solicited local adverse event was pain in both groups with high incidences 
of solicited local grade 3 pain (up to 42.1%). Higher incidences of grade 3 pain were reported at the 
DTPw-HBV/Hib injection site (40.4%) compared to the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine injection sites 
(up to 26.3%) (Table 2). 
Large  swelling  reactions  were  reported  by  14  subjects  (12  subjects  in  the  10Pn246  group  and  2 
subjects  in  the  Prev246  group).  Ten  of  these  large  swelling  reactions  were  reported  at  the  DTPw- 
HBV/Hib injection site, 3 at the 10Pn-PD-DiT injection site and 1 at the IPV injection site. All were local 
or diffuse swelling reactions not involving adjacent joints that resolved without sequelae.  
The most frequently reported solicited general adverse event was irritability in both groups. One case 
of grade 3 fever (rectal temperature > 40° C), assessed by the investigator to be causally related to 
vaccination, was reported in the 10Pn246 group. (Table 3) 
Low incidences of grade 3 solicited general adverse events, assessed by the investigator to be causally 
related to vaccination (up to 4.7%), were reported in both groups, except for irritability (up to 14.4%).  
The  observed  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  at  least  one  unsolicited  adverse  event  within  31  days 
after  booster  vaccination  was  37.2%  in  the  10Pn246  group  and  35.7%  in  the  Prev246  group.  A  low 
percentage of subjects reported at least one adverse event with intensity grade 3 (up to 6.7%) or an 
adverse  event  which  was  assessed  by  the  investigator  to  be  causally  related  to  vaccination  (up  to 
6.3%).

Serious adverse events: 
During the active phase of the study, 9 subjects reported at least one SAE: 2 subjects out of 280 in the 
10PnEPI  group,  5  subjects  out  of 285  in  the 10Pn246  group  and 2  subjects  out  of  98  in  the  Prev246 
group. No fatal SAEs were reported. One of the reported SAEs in the 10Pn246 group (pharyngitis with 
febrile  condition)  was  assessed  by  the  investigator  to  be  causally  related  to  vaccination.  All  SAEs 
resolved without sequelae. 
During the extended safety follow-up of the study,  18 subjects reported at least one SAE: 4 subjects 
out  of  280  in  the  10PnEPI,  1  subject  out  of  93  in  the  PrevEPI  group,  10  subjects  out  of  272  in  the 
10Pn246  group  and  3  subjects  out  of  95  in  the  Prev246  group.  One  fatal  SAE  was  reported  in  the 
PrevEPI  group  (subject  904  died  from  acute  respiratory  distress  syndrome)  but  was  not  assessed  by 
the investigator to be causally related to vaccination. None of the other reported SAEs were assessed 
by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination and all resolved without sequelae.

•  MAH’s conclusions 
Immunogenicity 
For the 6-10-14 weeks + 12-18 months of age schedule, high persisting antibody concentrations ≥ 0.2 
μg/mL  were  observed  prior  to  booster  vaccination  especially  in  the  10PnEPI  group.  Robust  booster 
immune  responses  were  observed  in  both  groups  and  were  within  the  same  range  for  all  serotypes 
common to both vaccines. In the 10PnEPI group higher antibody GMCs and OPA GMTs were observed 
for the common serotypes 18C and 19F compared to the PrevEPI goup. 
For the 2-4-6- months +  12-18 months of age schedule persisting immune responses were observed 
prior  to  booster  vaccination.  Post-booster  vaccination,  the  observed  percentage  of  subjects  with 
antibody concentrations ≥ 0.2 μg/mL and the percentage of subjects with opsonophagocytic activity ≥ 
8 was within the same range in both groups for each of the pneumococcal serotypes common to both 
vaccines.  The  antibody  GMCs  and  OPA  GMTs  were  higher  for  most  of  the  common  serotypes  in  the 
Prev246 group compared to the 10Pn246 group except for serotype 19F (higher in the 10Pn246 group) 
and serotype 18C (within the same range for both groups). 
Safety 
The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  reached:  a  booster  dose  of  the  10Pn-PD-DiT  vaccine 
coadministered  with  DTPw-HBV/Hib  and  poliovirus  vaccines  did  not  induce  more  fever  with  rectal 
temperature > 39° C than a booster dose of Prevenar co-administered with the same vaccines. 
High overall incidences of adverse events (solicited and unsolicited, general and local) were reported in 
the 2-4-6 months + 12-18 months of age schedule with high incidences of grade 3 pain. 
Only one case of grade 3 fever was reported in the 2-4-6 months + 12-18 months of age schedule. 
Low  incidences  of  unsolicited  adverse  events  were  observed  in  the  6-10-14  weeks  +  12-18  months 
schedule (less than 9.7%). 
Large  swelling  reactions  were  reported  by  19  subjects  (5  subjects  in  the  6-10-14  weeks  +  12-18 
months schedule and 14 subjects in the 2-4-6 months + 12-18 months of age schedule). Most of these 
large  swelling  reactions  were  reported  at  the  DTPw-HBV/Hib  injection  site  (reported  by  14  subjects). 
All were local or diffuse swelling reactions not involving adjacent joints that resolved without sequelae. 
9  subjects  reported  at  least  one  SAE  during  the  active  phase  of  the  study.  No  fatal  SAEs  were 
reported.  One  of  the  reported  SAEs  was  assessed  by  the  investigator  to  be  causally  related  to 
vaccination. All SAEs resolved without sequelae. 
18  subjects  reported  at  least  one  SAE  during  the  extended  safety  follow-up.  One  fatal  SAE  was 
reported.  None  of  the  reported  SAEs  were  assessed  by  the  investigator  to  be  causally  related  to 
vaccination. All SAEs resolved without sequelae. 
Assessor’s  comments:  The  conclusions  of  the  MAH  are  endorsed.  The  relatively  large  difference  in 
antibody  responses  (GMCs  and  GMTs)  and  reacotgenicity  between  the  EPI  schedule  and  the  2-4-6 
months  schedule  could  be  explained  by  the  different  study  populations  (Philippines  and  Poland),  and 
the  design  of  this  study  does  not  allow  any  conclusion  on  the  different  priming  schedules.  The  study 
generally confirms the previously shown results on persistence and booster at 12-18 months of age.

DIT-001 study, 200 evaluable subjects provided at least 98% or 85% power (under equal mean or in 
case  of  1.2-fold  decrease  in  antibody  GMC,  respectively)  to  show  non-inferiority  (limit  of  2)  of  the 
10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine in the current study compared to the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine in the 10PN-PD-DIT-
001 study with respect to ELISA antibody GMC ratios for the 10 vaccine pneumococcal serotypes and 
protein D. Considering that up to 13% of the subjects enrolled would be excluded from the ATP cohort 
for analysis of immunogenicity, 230 subjects were to be enrolled.

•  Statistical Methods 
Immunogenicity: 
Confirmatory inferential analysis 
95% CIs for the ELISA antibody GMC ratio (antibody GMCs from 10PN-PD-DIT-001 study over antibody 
GMCs from current study), one month post-dose III, was computed for antibodies against each of the 
10  vaccine  pneumococcal  serotypes  and  protein  D,  using  an  ANOVA  model  on  the  logarithm10 
transformation of the concentrations (pooled variance). 
The  primary  objective  of  comparison  of  immunogenicity  data  from  the  current  study  to  the  10PN-
PDDIT- 001 study would be reached if the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 
on the antibody GMC ratios (antibody GMCs from 10PN-PD-DIT-001 study over antibody GMCs in the 
current study) was below a limit of 2 for all of the 10 vaccine pneumococcal serotypes and protein D. 
Descriptive analysis: 
Geometric  mean  antibody 
(antibody  GMCs/OPA  GMTs)  and 
seropositivity/seroprotection  rates  were  calculated  with  their  95%  CI  for  each  serotype/antigen,  one 
month post-dose III.

The primary objective of non-inferiority of the immune response of the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine in Mexican 
children compared to the immunogenicity in the pivotal 10PN-PD-DIT-001 study in Europe was reached 
since the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for ELISA antibody GMC ratios (10Pn group in study 10PN-
PD-DIT-001 / 10Pn group in study 10PN-PD-DIT-029) was below the protocol defined limit of 2 for all 
of the 10 vaccine pneumococcal serotypes and protein D. 
ELISA  antibody  GMCs  from  the  10Pn  group  in  study  10PN-PD-DIT-029  were  statistically  significantly 
higher  than  for  the  10Pn  group  in  study  10PN-PD-DIT-001,  for  all  of  the  10  vaccine  pneumococcal

Unsolicited adverse events 
48.9%  of  administered  doses  were  followed  by  at  least  one  unsolicited  AE.  The  most  frequently 
reported unsolicited AE was nasopharyngitis. Low overall/dose incidences of unsolicited AEs considered 
by  the  investigator  to  be causally  related  to  vaccination  (maximum  3.8%)  or grade  3  unsolicited  AEs 
(maximum 4.8%) were observed. 
Serious adverse events 
One  subject  experienced  a  fatal  SAE  (nasopharyngitis  and  bronchopneumonia)  which  was  not 
considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination. 
14 out of 230 vaccinated subjects reported at least one non-fatal SAE during the entire study period. 
None  was  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  causally  related  to  vaccination.  One  subject  reported

one  SAE  (convulsive  disorder)  which  was  still  ongoing  at  the  end  of  the  study.  The  same  subject 
reported 2 other SAEs which both resolved with sequelae. 
Withdrawals due to adverse events /serious adverse events: 
2 subjects were withdrawn due to a serious adverse event (SAE): 
One  subject  was  diagnosed  with  an  infarction  of  the  germinal  matrix  of  the  brain  on  the  day  of 
administration of the second dose of study vaccines. The event resolved without sequelae and was not 
considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination. 
One  subject  died  3  days  after  study  vaccination  due  to  nasopharyngitis  and  bronchopneumonia.  An 
autopsy was not performed. The events were not considered by the investigator to be causally related 
to vaccination.

One month post-dose III, for each of the vaccine pneumococcal serotypes, at least 93.3% of subjects 
in the 10Pn group had opsonophagocytic activity ≥8, except for serotypes 1 (87.6%) and 6B (85.4%) 
(Table 2). 
One month post-dose III, all subjects in the 10Pn group had measurable antibodies against protein D 
(≥100 EL.U/mL). A higher anti-protein D GMC was observed in the 10Pn group in Mali than in Nigeria 
(no overlap of 95% CIs). 
Immune response to the co-administered DTPw-HBV/Hib vaccine: 
One  month  post-dose  III,  all  subjects  of  the  10Pn  group  and  all  subjects  except  one  in  the  Zilbrix 
group had anti-PRP antibody concentrations ≥ 0.15 µg/mL. 97.3% and 91.1% of subjects in the 10Pn 
group  and  Zilbrix  group,  respectively,  had  anti-PRP  antibody  concentrations  ≥1.0  µg/mL.  All  subjects 
were  seroprotected/seropositive  for  antibodies  against  the  other  antigens  in  the  DTPw-  HBV/Hib 
vaccine  except  two  subjects  in  the  10Pn  group  who  were  not  seroprotected  for  HBs.  Antitetanus  and 
anti-PRP  antibody  GMCs  were  higher  in  the  10Pn  group  than  in  the  Zilbrix  group  (no  overlap of  95% 
CIs). 
•  Safety results 
Similar incidences of solicited local and general adverse events were observed in each group during the 
4- day (days 0-3) post-vaccination period.

Solicited local adverse events: 
Pain was the most frequently reported solicited local adverse event in each group. 
Swelling  was  the  most  frequently  reported  grade  3  solicited  local  adverse  event  in  each  group 
(following 3.1% of doses). In the 10Pn group, higher incidences of pain, swelling and grade 3 swelling 
were reported at the DTPw-HBV/Hib injection site than at the 10Pn-PD-DiT injection site (no overlap of 
95% CIs). 
In general, there was no increase in the incidence of each solicited local adverse event with successive 
doses during the primary vaccination course. 
Solicited general adverse events: 
Fever  was  the  most  frequently  reported  solicited  general  adverse  event  in  each  group.  The 
overall/dose incidence of fever >39.0°C (rectal temperature) was within the same range in each group 
(maximum  6.2%).  One  subject  in  the  10Pn  group  reported  grade  3  fever  (rectal  temperature 
>40.0°C).

Low  overall/dose  incidences  of  grade  3  solicited  general  adverse  events  were  reported  (ranging  from 
0% to 0.8%). All of these were considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination. 
In  general,  there  was  no  increase  in  the  incidence  of  each  solicited  general  adverse  event  with 
successive doses during the primary vaccination course. 
Unsolicited adverse events: 
The percentage of administered doses followed by at least one unsolicited adverse event was 53.0% in 
the  10Pn  group  and  57.3%  in  the  Zilbrix  group.  The  most  frequently  reported  unsolicited  adverse 
events in each group were rhinitis and allergic bronchitis (both reported only in Mali). 5.7% and 9.7% 
of administered doses in the 10Pn group and Zilbrix group, respectively, were followed by at least one 
unsolicited adverse event assessed by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination. 
A  low  percentage  of  doses  was  followed  by  at  least  one  grade  3  unsolicited  adverse  event  (1.1%  in 
each  group)  with  no  differences  observed  between  countries.  None  of  these  were  assessed  by  the 
investigator to be causally related to vaccination. 
Serious adverse events: 
Five  subjects  of  the  10Pn  group  reported  at  least  one  serious  adverse  event.  None  of  these  serious 
adverse events were assessed by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination and all resolved 
without sequelae. 
No fatal events have been reported in this study.  
No subjects were withdrawn due to a non-serious adverse event. One subject (subject number 528 in 
the 10Pn group) was withdrawn due to a serious adverse event (bronchopneumonia). 
Assessor’s comment: The overall incidence of fever was very high in this study, but the incidence was 
similar in both groups and in most cases <38.5°C. The incidence of high fever was not unusually high.

•  Safety results 
Overall incidence of adverse events 
During  the  31-day  post-vaccination  period,  83.1%  and  84.2%  of  documented  doses  in  the  10Pn  and 
Hiberix groups respectively were followed by at least one AE (solicited and unsolicited). Local AEs were 
more frequently reported than general AEs in both groups. 
No increase in the incidences of any AEs (solicited and unsolicited) was observed with successive doses 
during the primary vaccination course. 
Solicited local adverse events 
Pain was the most frequently reported solicited local adverse event in both groups.

Observed  overall/dose  incidences  of  any  solicited  local  AEs  were  within  the  same  ranges  in  both 
groups. 
High  overall/dose  incidences  of  pain  (any  and  grade  3)  were  reported  in  both  groups  which  were 
however  in  the  same  range  in  both  groups  (i.e.  71.0%  and  70.6%  of  doses  in  the  10Pn  and  Hiberix 
groups  respectively  for  any  pain  and  27.7%  and  24.9%  of  doses  in  the  10Pn  and  Hiberix  groups 
respectively for grade 3 pain). These rates of overall/dose incidences of pain (any and grade 3) are in 
line with those observed in other studies where 10Pn-PD-DiT was co-administered with DTPw combined 
vaccine (e.g. Poland, The Philippines). 
The  overall/dose  incidences  of  grade  3  solicited  local  AEs  ranged  from  1.3%  (for  redness)  to  27.7% 
(for pain) in the 10Pn group and between 0.8% (for redness) to 24.9% (for pain) in the Hiberix group, 
whatever the injection site. 
There  was  no  increase  in  the  incidence of  solicited local  adverse events  with successive  doses  during 
the primary vaccination course.

Irritability was the most frequently reported solicited general AE in both groups (52.8% and 49.2% of 
doses in the 10Pn and Hiberix groups, respectively). 
Except  for  any  fever,  the  overall/dose  incidences  of  any  solicited  general  AEs  were  within  the  same 
ranges in both groups. Although any fever seemed to be reported more frequently in the 10Pn group 
than in the Hiberix group (no overlap of 95% CI), the incidences of grade 3 fever (rectal temperature 
>40°C)  were  within  the  same  range  in  both  groups.  Fever  >39°C  (rectal  temperature)  was  reported 
following 3.7% of doses in the 10Pn group and 1.4% of doses in the Hiberix group. 
The overall/dose incidences of grade 3 solicited general AEs ranged from 0.0% (for fever) to 8.3% (for 
irritability), whatever the group. Except for drowsiness, most of the grade 3 solicited general AEs were 
considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination. 
There  was  no  increase  in  the  incidence  of  solicited  general  AEs  with  successive  doses  during  the 
primary vaccination course. 
Unsolicited adverse events 
6.0% and 4.8% of administered doses in the 10Pn and Hiberix groups, respectively were followed by 
at least one unsolicited AE, classified by MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and Preferred Term. The 
most  frequently  reported  unsolicited  AE  was  rhinitis  and  cough  in  the  10Pn  group  and  rhinitis  in  the 
Hiberix group. 
Low overall/dose incidences of grade 3 unsolicited AEs were observed in both groups (0.3% and 0.0% 
of  doses  in  the  10Pn  and  Hiberix  groups,  respectively).  None  of  the  grade  3  unsolicited  AEs  was 
considered by the investigator to be causally related to the vaccination. 
Serious adverse events: 
One subject in the 10Pn group (subject number 680) died 14 days after the third dose of 10Pn-PDDiT 
vaccine co-administered with DTPw-HBV/Hib vaccine. The medical diagnosis for the cause of death was

aspiration  pneumonia.  An  autopsy  was  not  performed.  The  event  was  not  considered  by  the 
investigator to be causally related to vaccination. 
Four  subjects  out  of  240  vaccinated  subjects  in  the  10Pn  group  (1.7%)  and  1  subject  out  of  120 
vaccinated  subjects  in  the  Hiberix  group  (1%)  reported  at  least  one  non-fatal  SAE  during  the  entire 
study period. None of the non-fatal SAEs was considered by the investigator to be causally related to 
vaccination and all resolved without sequelae. 
One subject was withdrawn due to a SAE (subject number 680 in the 10Pn group) as described above.

•  Statistical Methods 
Immunogenicity 
Confirmatory analysis: 
95% CIs for the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) adjusted GMCs ratio (GMCs of the phase 
III  clinical  lot  over  the  GMCs  of  the  commercial  lot),  one  month  after  administration  of  the  third 
vaccine  dose,  were  computed  for  each  of  the  10  vaccine  pneumococcal  serotypes  and  for  protein  D, 
using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model on the logarithm 10 transformation of the concentrations 
(pooled variance). The ANOVA model included the group and the country as fixed effects. 
The  primary  objective  was  reached  if  the  upper  limit  of  the  two-sided  95%  CIs  on  the  adjusted  GMC 
ratios [GMCs of the phase III clinical lot over the GMCs of the commercial lot] was below a limit of 2- 
fold for antibodies against all vaccine pneumococcal serotypes and protein D as measured by ELISA. 
Descriptive analysis: 
GMCs/GMTs with 95% CIs were tabulated for each serotype/antigen overall and by country. 
Seropositivity/seroprotection  rates  with  exact  95%  CIs  were  calculated  for  each  appropriate

(Day 0-Day 3) follow-up period were tabulated after each vaccine dose and overall, with exact 95% CI. 
The percentage of doses followed by each individual solicited local and general AE were tabulated, over 
the whole vaccination course, with exact 95% CI. 
The  same  tabulation  was  performed:  for  grade  3  solicited  AEs  and  for  solicited  AEs  with  causal 
relationship to vaccination. For redness and swelling, grade 2 or 3 AEs were also tabulated. 
Occurrence of fever was reported per 0.5°C cumulative increments. 
The  proportion  of  subjects/doses  with  at  least  one  report  of  unsolicited  AE  classified  by  the  Medical 
Dictionary  for  Regulatory  Activities  and  reported  up  to  30  days  after  vaccination  was  tabulated  with 
exact 95% CI. The same tabulation was performed for grade 3 unsolicited AEs and for unsolicited AEs 
with a relationship to vaccination. 
The proportion of AEs resulting in a medically attended visit was also tabulated.  
The number and percentage of subjects who took concomitant antipyretic or other medication at least 
once during the 4-day (Day 0-Day 3) solicited follow-up period were tabulated after each vaccine dose 
and  overall,  with  exact  95%  CI.  The  number  and  percentage  of  doses  for  which  the  subjects  took 
concomitant  antipyretic  or  other  medication  at  least  once  during  the  4-day  (Day  0-  Day  3)  solicited 
follow-up period were tabulated over the full vaccination course, with exact 95% CI. 
SAEs and withdrawal due to AE(s) were described in detail. 
  Results 
•  Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Of the 466 enrolled and vaccinated subjects, 464 subjects completed the study. 
The mean age of subjects in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity at the time of the first vaccination was 
7.3 weeks. 
In  the  ATP  cohort  for  immunogenicity,  46.5%  of  subjects  were  female  and  99.3%  of  subjects  were 
Asian (South East Asian heritage).

Efficacy results 
Pneumococcal vaccine - Confirmatory inferential analysis results: 
The primary objective was reached because the upper limits of the two-sided 95% CIs of the adjusted 
GMC ratios (GMCs of the phase III clinical lot over the GMCs of the commercial lot) were below a limit 
of 2-fold for antibodies against each of the 10 vaccine pneumococcal serotypes (≤ 1.45) and protein D 
(1.58) as measured by ELISA.

Pneumococcal vaccine - Descriptive analysis results: 
One month post-dose III, at least 96.3% of all subjects in the Clin group and 93.6% in the Com group 
had antibody concentrations ≥0.2 µg/mL for each of the 10 vaccine pneumococcal serotypes. 
At  least  88.5%  of  all  subjects  in  the  Clin  group  and  90.0%  in  the  Com  group  had  opsonophagocytic 
titres ≥8 for each of the 10 vaccine pneumococcal serotypes one month post-dose III. 
All  subjects,  except  one  in  the  Com  group,  had  measurable  antibodies  against  protein  D  (≥  100 
EL.U/mL).

Co-administered DTPa-combined and HRV vaccines - Descriptive analysis results 
All  subjects  were  seroprotected/seropositive  for  antibodies  against  diphtheria,  tetanus,  each  of  the 
pertussis antigens (PT, FHA and PRN), the hepatitis B surface (HBs) antigen (except one subject in the 
Clin group), poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 and PRP one month post-dose III. 
Three  months  after  the  second  dose  of  HRV  vaccine,  at  least  81.9%  of  subjects  in  each  group  had 
seropositive anti-HRV levels ( ≥20 U/mL). 
•  Safety results 
Solicited local adverse events: 
Within  the  4-day  post-vaccination  period,  pain  was  the  most  frequently  reported  solicited  local  AE  in 
each group (48.7% and 48.4% of overall doses in the Clin group and in the Com group, respectively). 
The observed overall/dose incidences for each of the solicited local AE were in the same ranges across 
the groups. 
The overall/dose incidence of grade 3 solicited local AEs ranged from 0.4% to 5.7%, for any injection 
site and group.

Solicited general adverse events: 
The  most  frequently  reported  solicited  general  AE  during  the  4-day  post-vaccination  period  in  each 
group  was  irritability  (49.6%  and  49.7%  of  overall  doses  in  the  Clin  and  Com  groups,  respectively).

The  incidence  of  grade  3  solicited  general  AEs  was  at  most  3.3%  (diarrhoea  in  the  Com  group).  No 
cases of grade 3 fever (defined as rectal temperature > 40°C) were reported. 
Unsolicited adverse events: 
The  percentage  of  doses  followed  by  at  least  one  unsolicited  symptom  in  the  31-day  postvaccination 
period  was  16.2%  in  the  Clin  group  and  17.0%  in  the  Com  group.  The  most  frequently  reported 
unsolicited AE in each group was upper respiratory tract infection (5.0% in the Clin group and 6.0% in 
the Com group).

The percentage of doses followed by at least one unsolicited symptom considered by the investigator 
to  be  causally  related to  vaccination  and  the percentage of  doses  with  grade 3  unsolicited  AEs  in  the 
31-day post-vaccination period was at most 1.0% in both groups. 
No grade 3 unsolicited AEs were considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination. 
Serious adverse events: 
No fatal SAEs were reported in this study. A total of 36 non-fatal SAEs were reported for 25 (5.4%) out 
of  466  vaccinated  subjects:  18  subjects  (7.7%)  in  the  Clin  group  and  7  subjects  (3.0%)  in  the  Com 
group. No SAEs were considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination. One SAE did 
not  resolve  (spinal  muscular  atrophy)  and  one  SAE  (tuberculous  meningitis)  was  still  ongoing  at  the 
end of this study. 
No subjects were withdrawn due to an AE or SAE during this study. 
Assessor’s comment: The results of this study confirm the previously reported results for Synflorix. No 
further regulatory action is required based on this study. 
3. Discussion on clinical aspects 
The majority of the above described studies do not provide new results that change the overall benefit 
risk of Synflorix, or require any further regulatory action. Study 009 cause some concern regarding the 
relatively  low  responses  to  some  serotypes  following  the  catch-up  vaccinations  in  children  12-23 
months of age. However, as the MAH already has a commitment to study booster vaccination after the 
catch-up schedule, no further action is currently needed.

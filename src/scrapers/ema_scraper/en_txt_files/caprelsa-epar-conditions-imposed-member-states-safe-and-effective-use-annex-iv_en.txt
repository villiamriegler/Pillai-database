Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of medicinal product to be 
implemented by the member states 
The Member States should ensure that all conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and 
effective use of the medicinal product described below are implemented: 
Prior to launch of the product in each Member State, the Marketing Authorisation Holder shall agree 
the content and format of the educational material with the national competent authority. 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) should ensure that, at launch and thereafter, all 
Healthcare Professionals who are expected to use and/or prescribe Caprelsa are provided with an 
Educational pack.  
The educational pack should contain the following: 
•  Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet 
•  Educational material for Healthcare Professionals 
•  Patient Alert Cards (text as agreed by the CHMP) 
The educational material for Healthcare Professionals should contain the following key elements: 
•  Vandetanib prolongs the QTc interval and can cause Torsades de Pointes and sudden death  
•  Vandetanib treatment must not be started in patients: 
•  Whose ECG QTc interval is greater than 480 msec 
•  Who have congenital long QTc syndrome 
• Who have a history of Torsades de Pointes unless all risk factors that contributed to 
Torsades have been corrected. 
• The need for an ECG, and serum levels of potassium, calcium and magnesium and thyroid 
stimulating hormone (TSH) and the times and situations when it should be performed 
• Patients who develop a single value of corrected ECG QTc interval of at least 500 msec should 
stop taking vandetanib. Dosing can be resumed at a reduced dose after return of the ECG QTc 
interval to pretreatment status has been confirmed and correction of possible electrolyte 
imbalance has been made. 
• If QTc increases markedly but stays below 500 msec, the advice  of a cardiologist should be 
sought. 
• Details of medicinal products where the co-administration of vandetanib is either 
contraindicated or not recommended.  
• That vandetanib may cause Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) also known 
as Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) 
• PRES should be considered in any patient presenting with seizures, headache, visual 
disturbances, confusion or altered mental function. Brain MRI should be performed in any 
patient presenting with seizures, confusion or altered mental status. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• The need to counsel patients about the risk of prolonged QTc and PRES and inform them of 
what symptoms and signs to be aware of and the actions to take 
•  The role and use of the Patient Alert Card

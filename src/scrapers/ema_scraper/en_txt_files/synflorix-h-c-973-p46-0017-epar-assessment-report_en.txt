I. 
INTRODUCTION 
On June 7, 2012 the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Synflorix, in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended, on medicinal products for paediatric use. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
The  MAH  stated  that  the  submitted  paediatric  study  does  not  influence  the  benefit  risk  for  Synflorix 
and that there is no consequential regulatory action.  
This  study  report  is  also  part  of  a  follow-up  measure  for  Synflorix,  with  the  aim  to  evaluate  the 
boostability of the immune response following the 2-dose catch-up vaccinatin in children 12-23 months 
of  age.  The  study  was  performed  in  accordance  with  an  agreed  paediatric  investigation  plan  (EMEA-
000673-PIP01-09).

Clinical aspects 
1. Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
- 
10PN-PD-DIT-062;  Booster  vaccination  with  pneumococcal  vaccine  GSK1024850A  in  primed 
children and catch-up vaccination in unprimed children. 
2. Clinical study 
10PN-PD-DIT-062;  Booster  vaccination  with  pneumococcal  vaccine  GSK1024850A  in  primed  children 
and catch-up vaccination in unprimed children. 
  Description 
A phase III, open study in children previously enrolled in study 10PN-PD-DIT-037 (111188) to assess 
the  immunogenicity,  safety  and  reactogenicity  of  GlaxoSmithKline  (GSK)  Biologicals’  10-valent 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine when administered as a booster dose at either 9-18 or 15-18 months 
of age in primed children or when administered as a catch-up vaccination (2+1 schedule) in unprimed 
children during the second year of life. 
  Methods 
•  Objective(s) 
Primary: 
• 
To assess the immune responses following vaccination with a booster dose of the 10Pn-PD-DiT 
vaccine administered at either 9-12 or 15-18 months of age in children previously vaccinated 
with  the  10Pn-PD-DiT  vaccine  in  study  10PN-PD-DIT-037  (111188)  according  to  a  3-dose 
primary vaccination at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age. 
Note: In the Pn-Pn9 group, following protocol amendment 1, the age range for receiving booster dose 
was  changed  from  9-12  to  9-18  months  of  age.  Therefore,  for  analysis  purposes,  the  group  was 
divided in two sub-groups [Pn-Pn9 (9-12) and Pn-Pn9 (13-18)] in order to allow evaluation of the early 
booster subset (9-12 months of age) for the primary objective.

Assessor’s  comment:  It  is  unfortunate  that  the  design  of  the  study  was  not  in  accordance  with  the 
primary  objective.  The  consequence  of  the  protocol  amendment  was  that  there  were  fewer  children 
with an early booster. 
Secondary: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To assess, prior to booster vaccination, the antibody persistence following primary vaccination 
with the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine. 
To  assess  the  immunogenicity  of  the  10Pn-PD-DiT  vaccine  following  a  2-dose  primary 
vaccination administered as a catch-up immunization according to a 2+1 vaccination schedule 
in unprimed children during the second year of life. 
To  assess  the  immunogenicity  of  the  10Pn-PD-DiT  vaccine  following  booster  vaccination 
administered as a catch-up immunization according to a 2+1 vaccination schedule in unprimed 
children during the second year of life. 
To  assess  the  safety  and  reactogenicity  of  the  10Pn-PD-DiT  vaccine  when  administered  as  a 
catchup immunization according to a 2+1 vaccination schedule in unprimed children during the 
second year of life. 
To  assess  the  safety  and  reactogenicity  of  a  booster  dose  of  the  10Pn-PD-DiT  vaccine  when 
administered  at  either  9-18  or  15-18  months  of  age  in  children  primed  with  the  10Pn-PD-DiT 
vaccine  in  study  10PN-PD-DIT-037  (111188)  according  to  a  3-dose  primary  vaccination  at  6, 
10 and 14 weeks of age. 
To assess the antibody persistence following booster vaccination with the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine 
up to approximately 24 months of age in the primed groups. 
•  Study design 
This  was  a  phase  III,  partially  randomized,  open  study  with  3  parallel  groups  (as  described  above). 
Randomization  of  subjects  primed  in  study  10PN-PD-DIT-037  (111188)  into  two  groups;  Pn-Pn9  and 
Pn-Pn15, in a 1:1 ratio was done at 9-18 months of age (Randomisation visit or Visit 1).  
Blood samples: 
Pn-Pn9  and  Pn-Pn15  groups:  prior  to  vaccination,  one  month  post-vaccination,  and  at  approximately 
24 months of age. 
Hib-Pn  group:  prior  to  dose  1,  one  month  post-dose  2,  prior  to  and  one  month  post-booster 
vaccination. 
•  Study population /Sample size 
Healthy  male  or  female  for  whom  the  investigator  believes  that  their  parents/  guardian(s)  could  and 
would  comply  with  the  requirements  of  the  protocol.  Written,  signed  or  thumb-printed  informed 
consent  obtained  from  the  parent(s)/guardian(s)  of  the  child/ward.  Where  parent(s)/guardian(s)  are 
illiterate, the consent form was countersigned by a witness. 
For primed subjects: 
•  Completion of the full vaccination course in study 10PN-PD-DIT-037 (111188). 
•  9-18 months at the time of randomization. 
•  9-18 months of age at the time of booster vaccination for the Pn-Pn9 group. 
•  15-18 months of age at the time of booster vaccination for the Pn-Pn15 group 
For unprimed subjects: 
• 
•  12-18 months of age at the time of first vaccination in the present study. 
Enrolled in study 10PN-PD-DIT-037 (111188). 
The sample size was contingent on the number of subjects who received a 3-dose primary vaccination 
course with the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine for primed subjects or who were enrolled in study 10PN-PD-DIT-
037 (111188) for the unprimed group. (Assessors’ note: 240 subjects received priming vaccination in 
study 10PN-PD-DIT-037 and 120 subjects were included in the control group).  
Assuming  that  around  20%  of  these  subjects  did  not  enter  this  study,  it  could  be  considered  that 
approximately  96  subjects  per  group  received  a  booster  vaccine  dose  or  catch-up  vaccine  dose(s)  in 
the current study.

Considering that 96 subjects per group (288 subjects in total) were to be enrolled and included in the 
Total vaccinated cohort, and up to 10% of the subjects might have been excluded from the ATP cohort 
for analysis of immunogenicity, there would be 86 evaluable subjects per group (258 subjects in total) 
in the current study. 
• 
Treatments 
The study groups were as follows: 
• 
• 
Pn-Pn9 group: 50% of subjects (randomly selected) previously primed with the 10Pn-
PDDiT  vaccine  in  study  10PN-PD-DIT-037  (111188)  and  receiving  a  booster  dose  of 
10Pn-PDDiT at 9-18 months of age. 
Pn-Pn15 group: 50% of subjects (randomly selected) previously primed with the 10Pn-
PDDiT  vaccine  in  study  10PN-PD-DIT-037  (111188)  and  receiving  a  booster  dose  of 
10Pn-PDDiT at 15-18 months of age. 
•  Hib-Pn  group:  unprimed  subjects  previously  vaccinated  with  DTPw-HBV  and  Hib 
vaccines  in  the  control  group  of  study  10PN-PD-DIT-037  (111188)  and  receiving  a 
catch-up  vaccination  with  10Pn-PD-DiT  (2+1  schedule)  during  the  second  year  of  life. 
Dose 1 was given at 12-18 months of age, dose 2 at 14-20 months and dose 3 at 18-
24 months of age. 
Notes:  
1.  During the study subjects might have been vaccinated with a measles-containing vaccine and 
with  the  Infanrix/Hiberix  (DTPa/Hib)  vaccine  according  to  the  national  recommended 
vaccination  program.  These  vaccines  were  not  considered  as  study  vaccines  and  could  be 
administered either at any “protocol defined study visit” or at any time during the study except 
in the period 30 days before and 30 days after the administration of the study vaccine (10Pn-
PD-DiT).  
2.  In  the  Pn-Pn9  group,  following  protocol  amendment  1,  the  age  range  for  receiving  booster 
dose  was  changed  from  9-12  to  9-18  months  of  age.  Therefore,  for  analysis  purposes,  the 
group  was  divided  in  two  sub-groups  [Pn-Pn9  (9-12)  and  Pn-Pn9  (13-18)]  in  order  to  allow 
evaluation of the early booster subset (9-12 months of age) for the primary objective.

•  Statistical Methods 
Demography: 
•  Demographic characteristics (age in months, gender and race) were tabulated for each 
• 
• 
study cohort as a whole and per group. 
The mean age in months  (plus range and standard  deviation) of the enrolled subjects 
at the time of booster or first vaccination with 10Pn-PD-DiT, as a whole, and per group, 
was  calculated.  The  mean  age  in  months  (plus  range  and  standard  deviation)  at  the 
time  of  randomization  (screening  visit)  was  also  calculated  for  the  primed  Pn-Pn15 
group. 
The distribution of subjects enrolled among the study centres was tabulated as a whole 
and per group. 
•  A summary of the tracking log-sheet that documented outcomes of the contacts made 
with subjects for enrolment in this study was provided. 
Analysis of immunogenicity: 
The  primary  analysis  was  based  on  the  ATP  cohort  for  persistence  or  on  the  ATP  cohort  for 
immunogenicity  according  to  the  objective.  As,  in  at  least  one  group,  the  percentage  of 
vaccinated subjects with serological data excluded from this ATP cohort was more than 5%, a 
second  analysis  based  on  the  Total  vaccinated  cohort  was  performed  to  complement  the  ATP 
analysis. 
Descriptive analysis: 
•  Geometric  mean  concentrations/titres  (GMCs/GMTs),  seropositivity  rates  were 
calculated  with  their  95%  confidence  interval  (CI)  for  each  group  and  each 
pneumococcal  serotype  and  protein  D,  at  each  timepoint  that  a  blood  sample  result 
was available. 
•  Distribution of antibody concentrations/titres was displayed using tables and/or reverse 
cumulative  curves  for  each  group  and  each  pneumococcal  serotype  and  protein  D,  at 
each timepoint that a blood sample result was available. 
Exploratory Inferential analysis: 
•  95%  CIs  for  the  ELISA  GMCs  ratio  (GMCs  Pn-Pn15  group  over  GMCs  Pn-Pn9  group), 
one month after booster dose, was computed for each of the pneumococcal serotypes, 
for the cross-reactive pneumococcal serotypes 6A and 19A and for protein D, using an 
ANOVA  model  on  the  logarithm10  transformation  of  the  concentrations  (pooled 
variance). 
•  95% CIs for the OPA GMTs ratio (GMTs Pn-Pn15 group over GMTs Pn-Pn9 group), one 
month after booster dose, was computed for each of the pneumococcal serotypes and 
for the cross-reactive pneumococcal serotypes 6A and 19A, using an ANOVA model on 
the logarithm10 transformation of the titres (pooled variance). 
•  95%  CIs  for  the  ELISA  GMCs  ratio  [GMCs  Pn-Pn15  group  over  GMCs  Pn-Pn9  (9-12) 
group],  one  month  after  booster  dose,  was  computed  for  each  of  the  vaccine 
pneumococcal  serotypes,  for  the  cross-reactive  pneumococcal  serotypes  6A  and  19A 
and  for  protein  D  using  an  ANOVA  model  on  the  logarithm10  transformation  of  the 
concentrations (pooled variance). 
•  95%  CIs  for  the  OPA  GMTs  ratio  [GMTs  Pn-Pn15  group  over  GMTs  Pn-Pn9  (9-12) 
group],  one  month  after  booster  dose,  was  computed  for  each  of  the  vaccine 
pneumococcal  serotypes  and  for  the  cross-reactive  pneumococcal  serotypes  6A  and

19A,  using  an  ANOVA  model  on  the  logarithm10  transformation  of  the  titres  (pooled 
variance). 
Analysis of safety: 
• 
The  primary  analysis  was  based  on  the  Total  vaccinated  cohort.  As,  in  at  least  one 
group, the percentage of vaccinated subjects excluded from the ATP cohort for analysis 
of safety was more than 5%, a second analysis based on the ATP cohort for safety was 
performed to complement the primary analysis. 
Descriptive analyses: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Incidence  of  solicited  and/or  unsolicited  local  and/or  general  AEs  during  the  31-day 
postvaccination  period  was  calculated  with  exact  95%  CI  after  each  vaccine  dose  and 
overall, according to the type of symptom, intensity and relationship to vaccination. 
Incidence of each local and each general solicited symptom reported during the 4-day 
postvaccination  period  was  calculated  with  exact  95%  CI  after  each  vaccine  dose  and 
overall, according to the type of symptom, intensity and relationship to vaccination. 
The  percentages  of  subjects/doses  with  unsolicited  symptoms  reported  within  the  31-
days  postvaccination  period  were  summarized  according  to  the  Medical  Dictionary  for 
Regulatory  Activities  (MedDRA),  with  exact  95%  CI,  according  to  the  intensity  and 
relationship  to  vaccination.  The  same  tabulation  was  done  for  unsolicited  symptoms 
resulting in a medically attended visit. 
The  number  and  percentage  of  subjects  who  took  concomitant  antipyretic/medication 
at  least  once during  the  4-day  post-vaccination  period  was  computed  with  exact  95% 
CI after each vaccine dose and overall. The number and percentage of doses for which 
the  subjects  took  concomitant  antipyretic/medication  at  least  once  during  the  4-day 
(day 0-day 3) solicited follow-up period were tabulated over the full vaccination course, 
with exact 95% CI. 
•  Serious adverse events (SAEs), large swelling reactions and withdrawal(s) due to AE(s) 
reported during the entire study period were described in detail.

Efficacy results 
Persistence of immune response to pneumococcal serotype specific polysaccharides prior to 
booster vaccination 
22F Inhibition ELISA 
For each of the vaccine pneumococcal serotypes: 
At  least  94.3%  of  subjects  in  the  Pn-Pn9  and  Pn-Pn15  groups  had  antibody  concentrations  ≥  0.05 
µg/mL (Table 27). 
At  least  80.7%  of  subjects  in  the  Pn-Pn9  group  and  78.9%  of  subjects  in  the  Pn-Pn15  group  had 
antibody concentrations ≥0.2 µg/mL except for serotype 1 (65.9% in the Pn-Pn9 group and 64.4% in 
the Pn-Pn15 group) (Table 27). 
For cross-reactive serotypes: 
The observed percentage of subjects with antibody concentrations ≥0.05 µg/mL was 78.7% for 6A and 
79.5% for 19A in the Pn-Pn9 group and 86.2% for 6A and 89.9% for 19A in the Pn-Pn15 group (Table 
29). 
The observed percentage of subjects with antibody concentrations ≥0.2 µg/mL was 46.1% for 6A and 
62.5% for 19A in the Pn-Pn9 group and 52.9% for 6A and 69.7% for 19A in the Pn-Pn15 group (Table 
29). 
Opsonophagocytic activity 
For each of the vaccine pneumococcal serotypes, at least 64.4% of subjects in the Pn-Pn9 group and 
60.5%  of  subjects  in  the  Pn-Pn15  group,  respectively,  had  OPA  titres  ≥8  except  for  serotypes  1 
(41.4% in the Pn-Pn9 group and 40.5% in the Pn-Pn15 group) and 5 (48.3% in the Pn-Pn9 group and 
44.4% in the Pn-Pn15 group) (Table 31). 
For  cross-reactive  serotypes,  the  observed  percentage  of  subjects  with  OPA  titres  ≥8  was  40.7%  for 
6A and 25.6% for 19A in the Pn-Pn9 group and 47.6% for 6A and 23.2% for 19A in the Pn-Pn15 group 
(Table 33). 
Assessor’s comment: The antibody titres decline for most serotypes prior to booster vaccination, which 
is in agreement with other studies and as expected.

Immune response to catch-up (2+1 schedule) vaccination in the unprimed Hib-Pn group (22-inhibition 
ELISA): 
One month after dose 2 of catch-up vaccination: 
For  each  of  the  vaccine  pneumococcal  serotypes,  at  least  94.4%  of  subjects  had  antibody 
concentrations ≥0.2 µg/mL except for serotypes 6B (88.6%) and 23F (90.1%). 
For  cross-reactive  serotypes,  the  observed  percentage  of  subjects  with  antibody  concentrations  ≥0.2 
µg/mL was 65.7% for 6A and 94.4% for 19A. 
Four months after dose 2 of catch-up vaccination: 
For  each  of  the  vaccine  pneumococcal  serotypes,  at  least  93.8%  of  subjects  had  antibody 
concentrations ≥0.2 µg/mL except for serotype 6B (87.7%). 
For cross-reactive serotypes, the observed percentage of subjects with antibody concentrations   ≥0.2 
µg/mL was 60.0% for 6A and 95.4% for 19A. 
One month after dose 3 of catch-up vaccination: 
For  each  of  the  vaccine  pneumococcal  serotypes,  at  least  96.3%  of  subjects  had  antibody 
concentrations ≥0.2 µg/mL. 
For  cross-reactive  serotypes,  the  observed  percentage  of  subjects  with  antibody  concentrations  ≥0.2 
µg/mL was 87.0% for 6A and 100.0% for 19A. 
Assessor’s  comment:  The  study  was  not  powered  to  detect  any  differences  between  an  early  or  late 
booster dose. The ELISA results do not indicate any major differences between the groups,  while the 
OPA GMTs were numerically higher in the late booster group compared to the early booster group for 
several  serotypes.  The  titres  had  generally  declined  to  a  lower  level  in  the  late  booster  group,  which 
favours  an  early  booster  dose  in  order  to  decrease  the  risk  of  breakthrough  cases  due  to  waning 
immunity before the booster dose.  
The responses after the third dose in the catch-up group (i.e. PIII(M7) in the HibPn group) were similar 
to  the  responses  to  the  booster  response  in  the  children  primed  with  the  EPI  schedule  in  terms  of 
number of subjects achieving ELISA antibody levels ≥0.2 µg/mL. In some cases, e.g. serotype 1 and 
6B the GMCs and the OPA GMTs were lower in the catch-up group and for serotypes 18C and 19F they 
were higher in the catch-up group. The ELISA GMCs and the OPA GMTs for all serotypes following the 
third dose in the catch-up schedule were consistently numerically higher compared to the second dose. 
Taken together these results indicate that a third dose given during the second year of life after the 2-
dose catch-up schedule induces a booster response. However, from this relatively small study in Indian 
children it is not possible to draw conclusions on when or if a booster dose should be given to children 
who received a 2-dose catch-up vaccination during the second year of life. In addition, the relevance to 
an EU population is unclear.

MAH conclusions 
• 
The  data  in  this  study  showed  that  the  10Pn-PD-DiT  vaccine  induced  an  immune  response 
against vaccine pneumococcal serotypes when given as an early or late booster dose at either 
9-12 or 15-18 months of age, respectively, following 3-dose primary immunization course at 6, 
10  and  14  weeks  of  age  in  Indian  children.  One  month  after  booster  vaccination,  for  each  of 
the  10  vaccine  pneumococcal  serotypes,  at  least  96.8%  and  98.4%  of  subjects  boosted  with 
10Pn-PD-DiT  at  9-12  or  15-18  months  of  age,  respectively  had  antibody  concentrations  ≥0.2 
µg/mL except for serotype 6B (95.2% of subjects boosted at 9-12 months of age and 93.8% of 
subjects boosted at 15-18 months of age). 
•  10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine was generally well tolerated.  
•  During the 31-day post-booster vaccination period, at least one unsolicited AE was reported by 
7.0% and 1.1% of subjects boosted at either 9-18 or 15-18 months of age, respectively. In the 
group  that  received  3-dose  (2+1  schedule)  catch-up  vaccination  with  10Pn-PD-DiT  in  second 
year  of  life,  at  least  one  unsolicited  AE  was  reported  following  the  administration  of  2.5%  of 
doses (5.7% of subjects). 
Three  subjects  reported  at  least  one  SAE  during  the  entire  study  period:  two  out  of  100 
subjects  boosted  at  9-18  months  of  age  and  one  out  of  87  subjects  that  received  2+1  dose 
catch-up vaccination in second year of life. None of the reported SAEs were fatal or considered 
by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination.

•  No  confirmatory  analysis  was  performed  with  regards  to  the  primary  and  secondary 
immunogenicity and reactogenicity/safety objectives. 
3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The  submitted  study  report  describes  booster  responses  at  9-12  months  of  age  or  15-18  months  of 
age in Indian children who had received three primary doses according to the EPI schedule, i.e. at 6, 
10 and 14 weeks of age. In addition, a secondary objective was to study immune responses to 2 catch-
up  doses  followed  by  a  single  booster  dose  within  the  second  year  of  life.  The  catch-up  part  of  this 
study fulfils FUM, regarding boostability of the catch-up vaccination. The study design was not optimal 
to achieve the primary objective, since the children were recruited to either the 9-18 months group or 
15-18 months group, instead of the intended 9-12 and 15-18 months age groups. This was apparently 
done for practical reasons, as the study start was delayed.  
The study was not powered to detect differences between an early or late booster dose. The titres had 
generally  declined  more  in  the  late  booster  group  before  the  booster  dose,  compared  to  the  early 
booster group, and the responses tended to be higher in the late booster group. However, the groups 
were relatively small, and the relevance of these data for a European population is unclear. Therefore, 
in conclusion, there is no need to make any SPC changes based on the booster data presented in this 
submission.  
The catch-up part of this study was a secondary objective, but represents the first data on boostability 
of  a  2-dose  catch-up  schedule  during  the  second  year  of  life.  The  responses  to  a  third  dose  given 
during  the  second  year  of  life  have  the  characteristics  of  a  booster  response,  i.e.  higher  GMCs  and 
GMTs  following  the  third  dose  compared  to  the  second  priming  dose.  The  interval  between  the  two 
primary doses and the booster dose was relatively short, and no data on duration of the immunological 
memory  are  available.  Taken  together,  the  catch-up  data  indicate  that  a  third  dose  given  during  the 
second year of life increases the antibody titres, but these data are not considered sufficient to change 
the dosing recommendations for the catch-up schedule. In addition, the relevance of the data from this 
study conducted in India to a European population is questioned.  
No new safety signal was detected in this study.  
Thus, no further regulatory action is required.

RAPPORTEUR’S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION 
  Overall conclusion 
This  Paediatric  submission  is  considered  fulfilled,  and  in  addition  FUM  is  also  considered  fulfilled.  The 
presented  data  on  a  booster  dose  following  the  2-dose  catch-up  during  the  second  year  of  life  are 
considered novel, but not sufficient to request a change to the booster recommendations for the catch-
up dose in the EU SPC.

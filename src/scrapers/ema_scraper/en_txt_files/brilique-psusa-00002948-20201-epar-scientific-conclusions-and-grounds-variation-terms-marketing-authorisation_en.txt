Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for ticagrelor, the  scientific 
conclusions of CHMP  are as follows:  
During PSUSA of ezetimibe / rosuvastatin (procedure PSUSA/00010271/202007)  the PRAC considered 
that  the ticagrelor and rosuvastatin interaction for which  an extrapolation is proposed would also be 
relevant to be included in products containing ticagrelor as all the reported cases presented positive 
dechallenge for ticagrelor and provided a plausible mechanism of action. In addition,  no warning 
regarding renal injury or potential mechanisms for interaction with  rosuvastatin is included in the 
present product information of ticagrelor. During the  PSUSA procedure of ezetimibe / rosuvastatin, the 
interaction causing rhabdomyolysis has been established between rosuvastatin and ticagrelor. The PRAC 
assessed the additional information submitted during the  present PSUSA and concluded that the  section 
4.5 of the SmPC of products containing  ticagrelor should be amended accordingly, to add the interaction 
with  rosuvastatin. 
The Package leaflet is updated accordingly.  
The CHMP agrees with  the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation  to the  terms of the marketing  authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the  scientific conclusions for ticagrelor the CHMP  is of the  opinion that the  benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing ticagrelor is unchanged subject to the  proposed changes 
to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that  the terms of the  marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

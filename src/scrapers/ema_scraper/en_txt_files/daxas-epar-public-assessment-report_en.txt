2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is the fourth leading cause of death in Europe, and is a major 
public health problem. COPD is generally but not exclusively associated with tobacco smoking. Tobacco 
smoke is considered the most important risk factor for COPD worldwide. 
COPD  comprises  pathological  changes  in  four  different  compartments  of  the  lungs  (central  airways, 
peripheral  airways,  lung  parenchyma,  pulmonary  vasculature),  which,  in  turn,  give  rise  to  the 
physiological abnormalities in COPD: mucous hypersecretion and cilliary dysfunction, airflow limitation 
and hyperinflation, gas exchange abnormalities, pulmonary hypertension, and systemic effects.  
Prevalence and morbidity data greatly underestimate the total burden of COPD because the disease is 
usually not diagnosed until it is clinically apparent and moderately advanced.  
The most widely accepted classification of the severity of COPD is according to The Global Initiative for 
Chronic  Obstructive  Lung  Disease  (GOLD).  The  GOLD  classification  is  based  on  the  degree  of 
impairment  of  lung  function.  Four  categories  are  recognised:  mild,  moderate,  severe,  very  severe 
(Stages I-IV).  
The  most  important  aspect  of  management  of  the  condition  is  educational  and  social:  the  avoidance 
and cessation of tobacco smoking. The medications for COPD currently available can reduce or abolish 
symptoms, increase exercise capacity, reduce the number and severity of exacerbations, and improve 
health  status.  At  present  no  treatment  is  shown  to  modify  the  rate  of  decline  in  lung  function. 
Combining different agents produces a greater change in spirometry and symptoms than single agents 
alone. 
Roflumilast is a selective phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) inhibitor. PDE4 is an important regulator of 
cyclic  AMP  in  most  cell  types  involved  in  inflammatory  processes.  Inhibition  of  PDE4  reduces  the 
breakdown of cAMP, which in turn down-regulates the inflammatory process.  
A  so-called  full  application  for  marketing  authorisation  has  been  submitted,  i.e.  a  complete  and 
independent/stand-alone Marketing Authorisation Application. The applicant submitted a request for an 
accelerated assessment. However, the CHMP did not conclude that the availability of roflumilast in the 
community would be of major interest from a public health perspective given that roflumilast does not 
seem to modify the long term decline of the lung function or to have a modifying effect on the disease. 
Hence, the criteria for accelerated assessment were not considered to be met. 
Roflumilast  was  object  of  a  previous  registration  procedure  for  the  treatment  of  COPD  and  asthma 
which was withdrawn by the Applicant.  
Roflumilast  was  also  investigated  in  allergic  rhinitis,  osteoarthritis  and  rheumatoid  arthritis  but  these 
indications have not been further investigated.  
Formal Scientific Advice was given by CHMP on the questions of the primary and secondary endpoints, 
the statistical approach, the investigation of a PK/PD correlation. The Applicant did not fully adhere to 
the advice given with regards to the design of the pivotal trials. 
The  safety  and  efficacy  of  roflumilast  in  COPD  have  not  been  assessed  in  patients  younger  than  18 
years of age due to the nature of the indication. A paediatric waiver has been granted by the EMA for 
roflumilast for the indication COPD as, according to GOLD, the condition should only be considered in 
an individual over the age of 40 with characteristic symptoms. 
The therapeutic indication claimed in the present application is “the maintenance treatment of chronic 
obstructive  pulmonary  disease  (COPD)  associated  with  chronic  bronchitis  in  patients  at  risk  of 
exacerbations”.  
CHMP assessment report

The approved indication is “Daxas is indicated for maintenance treatment of severe chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) (FEV1 post-bronchodilator less than 50% predicted) associated with chronic 
bronchitis  in  adult  patients  with  a  history  of  frequent  exacerbations  as  add  on  to  bronchodilator 
treatment.” 
The medicinal product is a film-coated tablet containing 500 microgram roflumilast. The recommended 
dose is one 500 microgram tablet once daily.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The  medicinal  product  Daxas  is  presented  as  film-coated  tablets  (immediate  release)  containing  500 
microgram  of  the  active  substance  roflumilast.  The  tablets  are  D-shaped,  coated  with  a  yellow  non-
functional film coating and embossed with “D” on one side. The tablet core contains besides the active 
substance  roflumilast  the  following  excipients;  lactose  monohydrate,  maize  starch,  povidone  (K90), 
magnesium stearate. The tablet coating contains hypromellose 2910, macrogol 4000, titanium dioxide 
(E171) and iron oxide yellow (E172). The medicinal product is packed in PVC/PVDC aluminium blisters. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
Roflumilast is a novel phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE 4) -inhibitor with the chemical name: 3-
(cyclopropylmethoxy)-N-(3,5-dichloropyridin-4-yl)-4-(difluoromethoxy) benzamide N-(3,5-
dichloropyridin-4-yl)-3-cyclopropylmethoxy-4-difluoromethoxy-benzamide. The molecular formula is 
C17H14Cl2F2N2O3 and the molecular weight is 403.22 g/mol. The structural formula is shown below:

Roflumilast  is  a  white  to  off-white  powder.  It  is  practically  insoluble  in  water  (0.52  –  0.56  mg/l  at 
22°C)  and  hexane,  sparingly  soluble  in  ethanol  and  freely  soluble  in  acetone.  Since  it  is  a  weak  acid 
with  a  pKa  of  8.74,  the  solubility  in  aqueous  solvents  increases  from  about  0.8  mg/l  under  neutral 
conditions  to  about  35.8  mg/l  at  pH  10.  The  pH  of  a  saturated  solution  at  21  –  22°C  is  6.35.  The 
partition  coefficient  between  1-octanol  and  aqueous  phosphate  buffer  at  pH  7.4  is  log  P  =  3.99.  The 
melting  point  was  determined  at  159.7°C.  Roflumilast  contains  no  asymmetric  centres  and  it  is  not 
hygroscopic. Based on the results of DSC and X-ray powder diffraction, it is concluded that there is no 
evidence  of  polymorphic  forms.  Due  to  its  low  solubility  roflumilast  is  micronized.  There  is  no  PhEur 
monograph for roflumilast. Roflumilast is not known to have polymorphic forms. The chemical structure 
of roflumilast has been confirmed by elemental analysis, UV, IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, 19F NMR and mass 
spectra and crystal X-ray analysis. All data are consistent with the proposed structure.

2.2.2.1. 
 Manufacture 
The  manufacture  of  roflumilast  consists  of  a  four-step  process.  Detailed  information  on  the 
manufacturing  process,  control  of  starting  materials,  reagents  and  solvents,  control  of  critical  steps 
and  intermediates,  process  development  and  process  validation  of  the  active  substance  have  been 
provided  by  the  applicant.  All  manufacturing  steps  are  adequately  described.  Adequate  in-process 
controls  are  in  place  and  appropriate  specifications  have  been  adopted  for  the  starting  materials, 
solvents  and  reagents.  All  relevant  impurities,  degradation  products  and  residual  solvents  have  been 
appropriately  characterized.  Potential  impurities  arising  from  the  starting  materials,  reagents  or  the 
route of synthesis have been discussed. Five of these impurities are controlled in the active substance 
specifications.  No  single  structurally  known  organic  impurity is  limited  above  the  limit  of  max.0.15%, 
which  would  require  specific  toxicological  qualification.  Validation  batches  results  confirm  the 
reproducibility  of  the  manufacturing  process  to  produce  the  drug  substance  with  the  quality 
established. Roflumilast is supplied by two active substance manufacturers. 
2.2.2.2. 
 Specification 
As  no  PhEur.  monograph  exists  for  roflumilast,  in-house  specifications  have  been  set  for  the  active 
substance, in accordance with the principles of the relevant ICH guidelines.  
The active substance specifications include appropriate tests for appearance, identification (IR spectra 
and  HPLC),  assay  of  roflumilast  (titration,  HPLC)  and  related  substances  (HPLC),  particle  size  (laser 
diffraction), residual solvents (GC), water content (Karl Fischer), heavy metals and sulphated ash.  
The analytical test procedures have been satisfactorily described and validated in accordance with the 
ICH  guidelines.  The  impurity  limits  are  acceptable  and  there  is  no  concern  from  the  point  of  view  of 
safety.  Batch  analysis  data  been  presented  and  all  batches  were  in  compliance  with  the  predefined 
active substance specification. 
2.2.2.3. 
 Stability 
Stability studies have been performed at long term (25 ± 2C, 60 ± 5% RH), intermediate (30 ± 2C, 
65  ±  5%  RH),  and  accelerated  (40ºC  ±  2C  /  75%RH  ±  5%  RH)  conditions  on  at  least  five  batches. 
These  include  batches  from  both  active  substance  manufacturers.  Up  to  60  months  of  long  term 
stability  data  has  been  provided,  confirming  the  stability  of  roflumilast.  All  batches  tested  were 
produced  using  the  current  manufacturing  procedure  and  subsequently  micronized.  The  routine  HPLC 
method  has  shown  to  separate  and  detect  all  degradation  products  and  is  therefore  considered  as 
stability indicating.  The  test  parameters  evaluated  in  these  studies  were  appearance,  assay  by  HPLC, 
related substances, water content and particle size. 
Forced  degradation  studies  have  been  performed  on  roflumilast  to  identify  potential  degradation 
products that might be formed in drug substance. When roflumilast (in solid state) is stored in a drying 
oven  at  100  °C  for  up  to  14  days,  no  change  in  content  nor  an  increase  in  impurities  could  be 
observed. 
Furthermore,  photostability  testing  has  been  performed  according  to  ICH  Q1B.  Roflumilast  in  solid 
state is not affected by exposure to light, however, solutions in acetonitrile of the drug substance are 
sensitive  to  light.  At  room  temperature,  solutions  of  roflumilast  in  0.1  M  hydrochloric  acid, 
demineralised water and 0.1 M sodium hydroxide are stable within 24 hours.

In  addition,  three  batches  have  been  tested  for  microbiological  purity,  at  the  beginning  and  after  36 
months of storage under different conditions. No trend for a change in the microbiological profile was 
found. The CHMP considers that the stability data provided justify the proposed retest period when the 
active substance is stored with no special storage conditions. In accordance with EU GMP guidelines1, 
any  confirmed  out  of  specification  result,  or  significant  negative  trend,  should  be  reported  to  the 
Rapporteur and the EMA. 
2.2.3.   Finished Medicinal Product 
2.2.3.1. 
 Pharmaceutical Development 
The  aim  of  the  pharmaceutical  development  was  to  develop  an  immediate-release  tablet  that  can  be 
handled  easily  by  the  target  patient  population  of  elderly  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease 
(COPD) patients.  
Physicochemical  and  biological  properties  of  the  drug  substance  have  been  studied.  The  active 
substance can be classified as a Class II active substance (high permeability, low solubility) according 
to  the  Biopharmaceutics  Classification  System  (BCS).  This  implies  that  particle  size  is  expected  to 
impact  dissolution  of  the  active  substance  and  thus  bioavailability.  Therefore  the  active  substance  is 
micronized in order to improve its solubility.  
Dissolution studies have been performed to support the specification of the particle size range for the 
active substance. Due to the low drug content (500 microgram) in the tablets, special focus was taken 
on  blend  and  content  uniformity  during  development,  scale-up  and  validation,  and  that  the 
homogeneous  distribution  of  the  drug  substance  and  homogeneity  of  the  granules  is  determined  for 
each batch during release testing by content uniformity.  
Different excipients were investigated by preparing binary combinations containing the drug substance 
and  the  excipient  and  stored  in  different  ambient  conditions.  Only  those  excipients  with  a  proven 
compatibility  with  roflumilast  were  selected  for  development.  All  excipients  comply  with  the  current 
versions of compendial monographs. 
The development of the formulation has been adequately explained and justified. Different immediate-
release tablet formulations were used throughout drug development and the amount of excipients was 
changed  to  increase  the  tablet  weight  and  volume.  This  leads  to  improved  patient  handling  of  the 
dosage form. Finally a film-coated formulation was chosen for marketing authorisation. To allow easy 
tablet  differentiation,  the  tablets  were  given  a  unique  D-shaped  form  and  it  was  decided  to  coat  the 
tablets  with  a  yellow  (non  functional)  coating.  A  satisfactory  dissolution  method  has  been  developed 
and the dissolution results provided indicate that the commercial formulation has a comparable in-vitro 
dissolution  profile  to  that  of  the  formulation  used  in  clinical  studies,  and  a  bioequivalence  study 
confirmed that the two formulations are bioequivalent. 
A stability study with different packaging materials was performed to assess the suitability of different 
blisters  materials.  The  different  packaging  materials  were  compared  and  drug  product  stability  was 
evaluated. The proposed primary packaging materials are adequate for marketing.

2.2.3.2. 
 Adventitious agents 
The  only  excipient  of  animal  origin  in  the  finished  product  is  lactose  monohydrate.  It  is  derived  from 
milk  collected  from  healthy  animals  as  used  for  human  consumption.  According  to  the  Note  for 
Guidance  EMEA/410/01,  milk  and  its  derivatives  are  regarded  as  unlikely  to  present  any  risk  of 
contamination  in  the  light  of  the  current  scientific  knowledge  and  irrespective  of  the  geographical 
origin. Excipients of human origin are not contained.  
2.2.3.3. 
 Manufacture of the product 
Daxas  film-coated  tablets  are  manufactured  by  a  conventional  wet  granulation  process  with  a  final 
film-coating.  The  manufacturing  process  has  been  adequately  described  and  validated.  Taking  into 
account  the  very  small  quantity  of  active  substance  in  the  finished  product  (<  2  %)  this  process  is 
considered  a  non-standard  process,  as  per  Annex  II  to  Note  for  Guidance  on  Process  Validation 
(CPMP/QWP/2054/03). Therefore critical steps must be identified. All critical process parameters have 
been  identified  and  are  controlled  by  appropriate  in-process  controls.  The  manufacturing  process 
demonstrates to be reproducible and provides a finished product that complies with the in-process and 
finished product specifications. 
2.2.3.4. 
 Product specification 
The medicinal product specifications for Daxas at batch release include the following tests: appearance, 
identity  of  roflumilast  (UV  and  HPLC)  and  the  colourant  iron  oxide  (colour  reaction),  water  content 
(PhEur),  purity  (HPLC),  assay  of  roflumilast  by  UV  or  HPLC),  content  uniformity,  dissolution  and 
microbiological  purity  (all  three  according  to  PhEur).  The  product  specification  is  standard  for 
immediate-release tablets. The proposed test  procedures and acceptance  criteria follow the principles 
of the ICH Q6A guideline. 
All tests included in the specification have been satisfactorily described and validated. Appropriate data 
have  been  presented  to  justify  the  release  specifications  for  each  quality  characteristic  that  is 
controlled.  All  excipients  used  in  the  formulation  comply  with  the  requirements  of  the  European 
Pharmacopoeia  (PhEur)  and/or  the  European  Food  Colors  Directive.  Impurities  and  degradation 
products  have  been  evaluated  and  found  to  be  acceptable  from  the  point  of  view  of  safety.  Eight 
batches  of  the  finished  product  proposed  for  marketing,  manufactured  on  full  scale  have  been 
analysed.  Batch  analysis  results  comply  with  the  proposed  specification  and  confirm  consistency  & 
uniformity of manufacture and indicate that the process is under control.  
2.2.3.5. 
 Stability of the product 
Stability studies have been carried out under long term (25°C/60% RH), intermediate (30°C/75% RH) 
and  accelerated  (40°C/75% RH)  conditions  according  to  the  ICH  requirements  for  three  production 
scale batches. The use of a higher humidity level at the intermediate storage condition (75% instead of 
65%) is considered acceptable. Twenty-four months stability data have been provided under long term 
and  intermediate  conditions  and  six  months  under  accelerated  conditions.  All  batches  placed  on 
stability studies were manufactured at the proposed site of finished product manufacture, according to 
the  proposed  process  and  using  active  substance  obtained  from  the  proposed  active  substance 
manufacturer.  All  batches  were  packaged  as  proposed  for  marketing  (transparent  PVC/PVDC  -Al 
blisters).  The  parameters  tested  and  analytical  methods  used  were  identical  to  those  used  for  the 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/464905/2010

release specifications. However, some release tests (such as identity and content uniformity) were not 
repeated at the end of shelf-life.  
Furthermore,  a  photostability  study  was  performed  on  one  batch  of  the  film-coated  tablets  in 
accordance  with  ICH  Q1B.  The  tablets  were  exposed  directly  to  light  without  packaging  material.  No 
changes in the specified test parameters were observed. 
The  stability  results  presented  were  satisfactory  and  support  the  proposed  shelf  life  for  the 
commercially  packaged  product  under  the  conditions  specified  in  the  SmPC.  In  accordance  with  EU 
GMP  guidelines 2 ,  any  confirmed  out  of  specification  result,  or  significant  negative  trend,  should  be 
reported to the Rapporteur and the EMA. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on manufacture, control and stability of the active substance and medicinal product have 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The excipients are commonly used in this type of formulation 
and  comply  with  PhEur  and/or  the  European  Food  Colors  Directive.  The  packaging  material  is 
commonly used and well documented. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform 
clinical  performance  of  the  product  have  been  investigated  and  are  controlled  in  a  satisfactory  way. 
Batch analysis results indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, 
and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the  conclusion  that  the  product  should  have  a  satisfactory  and  uniform 
performance  in  the  clinic.  Stability  tests  performed  under  ICH  conditions  indicate  that  the  product  is 
chemically stable for the proposed shelf life. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The  quality  of  Daxas 
is  adequately  established.  Satisfactory  chemical  and  pharmaceutical 
documentation has been submitted for marketing authorisation. There are no major deviations from EU 
and ICH requirements. 
The quality of this medicinal product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the 
conditions defined in the SmPC. At the time of the CHMP opinion there are no unresolved quality issues 
which have a negative impact on the benefit/risk balance of the product.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The  Applicant  conducted  a  full  non-clinical  development  program.  This  program  is  in  general 
agreement with the applicable guidelines.  
With  the  exception  of  safety  pharmacology,  for  which  the  studies  were  performed  prior  to  the 
implementation of the CPMP/ICH/539/00 Note for Guidance ICH S7A, the pivotal safety pharmacology 
and toxicity studies have been conducted in compliance with GLP.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
2.3.2.1. 
 Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In  vitro  roflumilast,  and  its  major  metabolite  roflumilast  N-oxide,  have  been  shown  to  be  highly 
selective  PDE4  antagonists.  PDE4  is  a  major  cyclic  adenosine  monophosphate  (cAMP)-metabolizing 
enzyme  found  in  inflammatory  and  immunomodulatory  cells.  Inhibition  of  PDE4  leads  to  elevated 
intracellular cAMP levels and mitigates COPD-related malfunctions of leukocytes, airway and pulmonary 
vascular  smooth  muscle  cells,  endothelial  and  airway  epithelial  cells  and  fibroblasts  in  experimental 
models.  Upon  in  vitro  stimulation  of  human  neutrophils,  monocytes,  macrophages  or  lymphocytes, 
roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide suppress the release of inflammatory mediators. In vitro roflumilast 
and  roflumilast  N-oxide  has  been  shown  to  weakly  inhibit  serotonin  or  methacholine-induced  airways 
contraction  in  different  in  vitro  test  systems.  Roflumilast  was  demonstrated  in  vitro  to  stimulate  the 
airway ciliary beat frequency in proximal and distal airways. 
When administered orally following LPS-challenge to mice and rats, roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide 
significantly  reduced  the    circulating  TNF-α,  the  TNF-α  in  BAL  (pro-inflammatory  mediator)  and 
increased IL-10 (anti-inflammatory mediator). Increase in the incidence of chest infections and cancers 
was observed in COPD patients treated with TNF-α inhibitors.  
In  vivo  studies  showed  that  roflumilast  prevented  the  cigarette-smoke  induced  pulmonary  changes, 
reduced the experimentally induced goblet-cell hyperplasia and influenced the experimentally induced 
pulmonary  remodelling  and  hypertension  in  mice  and  rats.  In  in  vivo  models,  roflumilast  and 
roflumilast N-oxide inhibited bronchoconstriction. 
2.3.2.2. 
 Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Potential receptor interactions have been investigated in vitro. Roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide did 
not  interact  with  muscarinic,  histaminergic,  purinergic,  and  adrenergic  receptors.  Lowered  binding 
affinity  of  rolipram  and  prazosin  binding  to  rolipram  R  (PDE4  receptor)  and  α1A-receptors  was 
observed.  However  no  interactions  are  expected  at  those  levels  since  the  effect  on  rolipram  binding 
was expectable, and antagonistic pharmacological profile of the functional α1-adrenoceptor population 
was demonstrated to be sensitive to the influence of the cellular environment. 
2.3.2.3. 
 Safety pharmacology programme 
The Applicant conducted safety pharmacology studies to assess the effect of roflumilast on the central 
and  autonomic  nervous  system,  cardiovascular  system  and  respiratory,  renal,  and  gastrointestinal 
functions.  
No  concerns  were  raised  from  the  safety  pharmacology  studies  on  central  and  autonomous  nervous 
system since the first effects occur at doses higher than the clinical dose, and these effects have not 
been reported in humans.  
Cardiovascular  effects  have  been  observed  in  dogs  given  roflumilast.  The  dog  species  was  very 
sensitive to roflumilast effects. However, no cardiovascular risk for the use of roflumilast in humans is 
assumed  in  view  of  the  dog-specificity  of  the  cardiac  lesions  and  the  high  safety  margins  in  other 
species.

Effects  of  increased  gastric  acid  secretion  and  delayed  gastric  emptying  were  observed  during  the 
safety pharmacology studies. These effects are possibly related to the class of compound. No concerns 
were  raised  from  the  findings  on  renal  functional  parameters  in  rats  at  high  exposure  since  no  renal 
findings were noted in standard toxicity studies. 
2.3.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
In  in  vitro  studies,  roflumilast  did  not  potentiate  the  β1-mediated  chronotropic  or  inotropic  effect  of 
isoprenaline. However, the combination of roflumilast N-oxide and isoprenaline resulted in a relaxation 
of the trachea via an additive synergistic effect on the β2-adrenoreceptors.  
In  vivo  studies  demonstrated  that  roflumilast  had  a  synergistic  anti-inflammatory  effect  with 
dexamethasone  in  a  COPD  model.  Roflumilast  showed  a  significant  synergistic  bronchodilatory  effect 
when  administered  with  formoterol  or  montelukast.  In  addition,  roflumilast  inhibitory  effect  on 
bronchoconstriction  was  potentiated  when  co-administered  with  cetirizine  and  muscarinic  receptor 
antagonists  (i.e.  revatropate  and  tiotropium).  None  the  above  compounds  showed  this  effect  when 
administered alone.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic program mainly consisted of single-dose studies in mouse, rat, hamster, guinea 
pig, rabbit, minipig, dog and monkey. Roflumilast was administered per os or intravenously. Validation 
of  bioanalytical  methods  for  roflumilast  and  its  metabolites  (roflumilast  N-oxide,  ADCP  and  ADCP  N-
oxide) was performed. The routine quantification of roflumilast from serum and plasma was performed 
either  by  HPLC  with  fluorescence  detection  or  by LC/MS/MS.  The  quantification  limit  ranged  from  0.1 
μg/L to 1 μg/L.  
Absorption 
Dose-linearity  was  established  for  the  low-dose  range;  at  high  doses,  non-linearity  was  often 
encountered.  Low  gastrointestinal  absorption  of  oral  roflumilast  was  apparent  in  several  species, 
variation  of  which  may  account  in  part  for  the  observed  non-linearity.  Moderate  bioavailability 
suggested the presence of a first-pass effect.  
Roflumilast is non-ionised at pH<8 and absorption occurs via non-ionic dissolution.  
Distribution 
Volumes  of  distribution  were  highest  in  the  rat  whereas  in  mice,  dogs  and  monkeys  a  more  limited 
distribution  to  organs  and  tissues  was  noted.  Following  multiple  oral  administrations  in  rats,  plasma 
concentrations of 14C-roflumilast attained a steady state after about 4 days with a slight accumulation 
of about 2-fold. 
Roflumilast is highly bound to plasma/serum proteins with an unbound fraction being lowest in humans 
and  minipigs  (1.1%),  and  slightly  higher  in  various  animal  species  (1.6  to  4.8%  in  mouse,  rat, 
hamster, guinea pig, rabbit, dog and monkey). The free fraction of the metabolite, roflumilast N-oxide 
was  3.4%  in  human  plasma  and  clearly  higher  in  the  animal  species  evaluated  (6.4  to  12.9%).    In 
addition,  roflumilast  N-oxide  showed  a  fewer  binding  to  human  albumin  and  α1-glicoprotein  than 
roflumilast.  The  observed  differences  in  unbound  fraction  of  roflumilast  and  roflumilast  N-oxide 
between  humans  and  animals  supports  the  comparison  of  drug  levels  across  species  based  on  the 
concentration of the free fraction.  
Roflumilast  has  been  demonstrated  to  cross  the  placenta  in  pregnant  rats.  In  addition  it  is  secreted 
into milk of breeding dams. This information is adequately reflected in the SPC. 
Metabolism 
The percentage of [14C]-roflumilast N-oxide and its glucuronide decreased among animal species in the 
following order: monkey, rat, hamster, mouse, dog. Various products of O-dealkylation and oxidative 
CHMP assessment report

Page 12/46
 
 
 
 
mono-dechlorination  followed  by  conjugation  were  identified  in  animal  plasma  except  in  rat,  monkey 
and human. ADCP and ADCP N-oxide were identified in rodent plasma as products of amide cleavage. 
The metabolite patterns in rat and monkey plasma were the closer to human.  In some species, some 
metabolites were found in urine although they were not identified in plasma.  
Excretion 
Terminal  half-lives  were  comparable  in  rat,  rabbit,  dog  and  monkey  (6-8h),  while  roflumilast  was 
eliminated  much  more  rapidly  from  guinea  pig  and  mouse  plasma  (2  h)  and  slowly  from  hamster, 
minipig and human plasma (12-14h).  
The plasma/serum clearance ranged from 1.83 L/h/kg in mice to 3.9 L/h/kg in rats; while clearance in 
dogs, monkeys and cats was significantly lower (0.38 l/h/kg, 0.32 l/h/kg and 0.18 l/h/k, respectively).  
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
No pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies have been performed in animals. Given the availability of 
human data on the pharmacokinetic drug interaction, this was considered acceptable to the CHMP. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
2.3.4.1. 
 Single dose toxicity 
The single-dose toxicity of roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide has been investigated in mice, rats, and 
dogs. Compound administration was followed by 14-days observation period. The results show a range 
of  non-lethal  doses  of  at  least  100  mg/kg  in  rodents  (10,000-times  the  human  dose)  after  oral  drug 
administration  and  of  at  least  20  mg/kg  after  intravenous  administration.  The  causes  of  death  after 
administration  of  lethal  doses  were  not  established.  Target  organs  at  necropsy  were  the  forestomach 
(hyperplasia),  glandular  stomach  (ulcer,  hemorrhage),  small  intestine  (thickening,  submucosal  cell 
infiltration,  serositis),  testes  (atrophy),  and  olfactory  epithelium  (inflammation).  In  dogs,  the  highest 
dose of 18 mg/kg roflumilast or its N-oxide induced vomiting and tremor but caused no mortality.  
2.3.4.2. 
 Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics) 
All  pivotal  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  of  roflumilast  (and  in  some  instances  of  roflumilast  N-oxide) 
were  performed  by  oral  route  in  five  animal  species  (longest  duration  in  parentheses):  mouse  (6 
months), rat (6 months), hamster (3 months), dog (12 months) and monkey (42 weeks). Please refer 
to table 1 for a summary of the studies.

Olfactory mucosa lesions were seen in mouse, rat and hamster, all rodent species, but in none of the 
non-rodent  species  tested  in  the  repeat-dose  toxicity  program.  Dose-related  changes  in  rodent 
olfactory  mucosa  consisted  of  disorganization,  degeneration/necrosis  accompanied  by  basal  cell 
hyperplasia  and  inflammatory  changes  of  Bowman's  gland  and  submucosa.  The  rat  was  the  most 
sensitive  species  (NOAEL  0.8  mg/kg/day),  while  mice  and  hamsters  were  less  sensitive  (NOAELs  4 
mg/kg/day).  Olfactory  toxicity  was  shown  by  mechanistic  studies  to  be  rodent  specific.  The  dog  and 
monkey  did  not  demonstrate  this  effect,  even  at  higher  levels  of  roflumilast  than  what  rodents  were 
exposed to. All this data support the lack of risk of this effect in humans. 
Gastrointestinal toxicity 
In  dogs,  vomiting  was  induced  by  roflumilast  and  roflumilast  N-oxide  in  a  dose-dependent  manner. 
This  finding  can  be  attributed  to  the  high  inhibition  potency  of  roflumilast  and  roflumilast  N-oxide  on 
PDE4D,  which  theoretically  accounts 
for  gastrointestinal  effects  as  nausea  and  vomiting. 
Hypersalivation was seen in animals administered roflumilast N-oxide. No morphological lesions of the 
gastrointestinal  tract  were  seen  in  mice,  hamsters  or  dogs.    Morphologic  changes  in  the 
gastrointestinal  tract  (i.e.  erosion,  ulceration  and/or  inflammation)  were  seen  both  in  rats  and 
monkeys. Considering that the safety margins in the sensitive species for gastrointestinal findings are 
between 3.7 and 15-fold higher than the expected exposure in humans and clinical dose, morphologic 
changes in the gastrointestinal tract are not expected at therapeutic dose in humans. 
Cardiac toxicity 
Cardiac lesions such as focal hemorrhages, hemosiderin deposits and lympho-histiocytic cell infiltration 
in the right atria/auricles were found in repeat-dose toxicity studies with roflumilast and roflumilast N-
oxide  in  dogs.  No  other  species  suffered  any  cardiac  affection,  even  at  higher  roflumilast  exposures 
than dogs. PDE inhibitors are well known for dog-specific cardiac toxicity. In addition, considering there 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/464905/2010

are  safety  margins,  wider  for  roflumilast  (21-fold)  than  for  its  main  metabolite  roflumilast  N-oxide 
(4.4-fold), cardiotoxic effects would not be expected in humans at roflumilast therapeutic dose.  
Male reproductive organ toxicity 
Testicular  tubular  dilation  in  some  cases  associated  with  tubular  degeneration  and  epididymal  sperm 
granulomas  were  found  in  rats.  No  toxic  effect  was noted  on  male  reproductive  organs  in  any  of  the 
other  species  tested.  The  safety  margin  for  roflumilast  and  roflumilast  N-oxide  exposure  levels  in 
relation  with  these  effects  were  quite  narrow,  1.7  and  6  respectively.  However,  considering  safety 
margins in other species were at least 20-fold higher than clinical human exposure, and no effect was 
observed in healthy volunteers, there is no further concern regarding potential toxicity of roflumilast on 
male reproductive organs. 
Female reproductive organ toxicity 
Prolongation of oestrus cycle length was observed in monkeys despite of the absence of alterations in 
reproductive hormones. The oestrus cycle prolongation observed in these studies is likely to be related 
to general stress patterns in the animal given high dose roflumilast. In specific fertility studies in rats, 
there  were  no  effects  on  reproductive  function.  Also,  the  AUC  exposure  multiples  in  monkeys  are 
sufficiently high for this not to warrant concern at the therapeutic dose level in humans.

Roflumilast induced a low number of micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocytes after 300 mg/kg/day in 
males and after 900 mg/kg/day in males and females. Reported values seem to be in the range of the 
spontaneous  incidence  number  of  micronuclei  in  this  species.  It  should  also  be  considered  that  weak 
positive  in  vivo  micronucleus  tests  have  been  reported  for  compounds  that  induce  hypothermia  or 
cause  hematopoiesis,  effects  observed  after  roflumilast  administration  in  safety  pharmacology  and 
toxicology mechanistic studies. In a mechanistic study, roflumilast induced an activation of erythrocyte 
parameters  (erythrocyte  count,  hemoglobin,  hematocrit)  within  24  and  48  hours  after  single  oral 
administration of 300 and 900 mg/kg roflumilast to male NMRI mice. This result indicates that the low

number of micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocytes observed in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test 
assay  have  been  caused  by  an  increase  in  erythropoiesis  rather  than  by  a  mutagenic  effect.  In 
addition, the exposure ratio in mice at 100 mg/kg/day (NOEL) is higher than 200-fold the human AUC 
at 500 μg/day. Therefore no clastogenic risk is expected.  
The rest of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity battery of studies with roflumilast, roflumilast N-oxide and 
metabolite ADCP gave negative results. Therefore, these compounds were not considered genotoxic. 
2.3.4.4. 
 Carcinogenicity 
The carcinogenic potential of roflumilast was assessed in two rodent species (mouse and hamster) with 
daily  drug  administration  by  gavage  for  2  years.  Mice  and  hamsters  were  the  species  chosen  for 
carcinogenicity  assessment  since  the  dose  limiting  olfactory  mucosa  toxicity  in  rats  precluded  long-
term dosing of rats. In the 2-year carcinogenicity study in the B6C3F1 mice, at roflumilast doses that 
achieved  maximum  tolerated  dose,  there  was  no  evidence  for  roflumilast-related  neoplasia  nor  were 
there  any  statistical  differences  in  the  incidences  of  tumors  in  either  sex.  These  results  indicate  that 
roflumilast  does  not  exhibit  carcinogenic  potential  in  this  species.  Roflumilast-related  tumors  in 
olfactory  mucosa  were  observed  at  8  and  16  mg/kg/day  in  the  2-year  carcinogenicity  studies  in 
hamsters.  These  effects  have  been  demonstrated  in  specific  mechanistic  toxicity  studies  to  be  due  to 
the  formation  of  local  SH-reactive  metabolites  within  the  nasal  epithelium  following  the  cleavage  of 
ADCP  and  subsequent  oxidation  to  ADCP  N-oxide  (metabolites  of  roflumilast)  that  bind  to  olfactory 
mucosa. The presence of degenerative and hyperplastic processes in the olfactory mucosa, as well as 
the lack of genotoxic results for ADCP and ADCP N-oxide in genotoxicity studies reflect the long-term 
exposure seems to be the more feasible cause of these effects. In addition, these two metabolites are 
not formed by human olfactory mucosa and the safety margins are large. It could be concluded that it 
seems  to  be  a  species-specific  effect  and  there  is  no  special  concern  regarding  roflumilast  use  in 
humans. 
2.3.4.5. 
 Reproduction Toxicity 
The  effects  of  orally  administered  roflumilast  on  reproductive  parameters  were  studied  in  mice  (male 
fertility,  pre-  and  postnatal  development),  rats  (fertility,  early  embryonic  development,  embryo-fetal 
development), and rabbits (embryo-fetal development). Male fertility was tested in mice at the end of 
the  6-month  toxicity  studies  with  roflumilast  and  roflumilast  N-oxide.  Drug  administration  in  the 
pre/postnatal  study  was  suspended  before  delivery  because  of  a  pronounced  tocolytic  effect  of 
roflumilast. Roflumilast is not considered teratogenic. 
Effects  on  male  reproductive  performance  were  confined  to  the  rat  and  were  considered  due  to  a 
disturbance of ion exchange and fluid absorption causing leakiness of the efferent ductular epithelium, 
emigration of sperm into the extraductular space and granuloma formation. The anatomical differences 
between rats and humans contribute to the assurance that this effect is rat specific. No other species 
showed this effect. The NOAEL for this effect was only at approximately 1 -2 fold the human AUC.  
The  increased  incidence  of  incomplete  ossification  in  the  embryo-foetal  development  study  in  rats 
correlated  with  a  significant  maternal  toxicity  at  roflumilast  dose  of  1.8  mg/kg,  and  thus  is  not 
regarded as a direct effect of roflumilast. The exposure multiples between pregnant rats and humans 
at  therapeutic  dose  is  not  significantly  wide.  However,  it  was  considered  unlikely  that  the  incomplete 
ossification  noted  in  rat  studies  should  present  a  contraindication  to  the  use  of  roflumilast  in 
pregnancy.  This  is  based  on  the  fact  that  there  is  much  variation  in  skull  bone  ossification  at  term, 
most  of  skull  bone  ossification  occurs  after  birth  and  that  there  are  no  consequences  to  physical  and 
mental development.  
Roflumilast treatment was associated with signs of tocolytic activity resulting in delivery retardation in 
the  mouse.  These  effects  occurred  at  systemic  drug  exposures  in  the  range  of  those  in  humans. 
However, the relevance of these findings to humans is unknown. 
2.3.4.6. 
 Toxicokinetic data 
No  gender  differences  in  exposure  were  noted  in  either  the  species  tested.  In  general,  roflumilast, 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/464905/2010  
Page 16/46
 
 
 
roflumilast  N-oxide  and  ADCP  exposure  levels  increased  proportionally  with  dose.  This  increase  was 
over-proportional  at  high  doses  in  mice  (25  mg/kg/day,  6-month  oral  study),  and  in  Cynomolgus 
monkeys. Biotransformation of roflumilast was specially pronounced in the hamster resulting in a 23- 
to 38- fold higher exposure to roflumilast N-oxide, and 1.2 to 2 and 7 to 10 higher to ADCP and ADCP 
N-oxide  than  to  the  parent  compound.  ADCP  N-oxide  was  not  detectable  in  dog  and  cynomolgus 
monkey plasma samples. Roflumilast N-oxide was neither detected in dog plasma samples. 
2.3.4.7. 
 Local Tolerance  
No  significant  local  intolerance  following  intramuscular,  intravenous,  paravenous  or  intraarterial 
roflumilast administration in rats and rabbits. The following gastrointestinal local tolerance effects have 
been  observed  in  safety  pharmacology  and  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies,  regarding:  stomach  erosions 
and  intestine  inflammation  in  1  month  study  on  rats;  inflammation  of  the  stomach  1  month  study  in 
monkeys.  
2.3.4.8. 
 Other toxicity studies 
Studies on antigenicity and immunotoxicity were conducted. Neither roflumilast nor roflumilast N-oxide 
had skin-sensitizing properties in the guinea pig maximization test. The findings of the immunotoxicity 
studies did not raise concerns. 
Neither  of  the  compounds  administration  resulted  in  any  direct  compound-related  effects  on 
lymphohematopoietic organs in mice, rats, hamsters, dogs or monkeys even after repeat doses for up 
to 52 weeks. 
The  main  roflumilast  metabolites  (roflumilast  N-oxide,  ADCP  and  ADCP  N-oxide)  toxicological  profile 
has been adequately covered along the non-clinical roflumilast toxicity development. 
The  presence  of  five  potential  genotoxic  impurities  in  roflumilast  drug  substance  is  limited  by  a 
specification limit of no more than 0.15%, consistent with the qualification threshold of the applicable 
guidelines.  Therefore, there is no requirement for further qualification. 
Impurities and residual solvents are limited to acceptable amounts as recommended in the applicable 
guidelines.  
In line with the applicable guideline, no photosafety testing would be warranted for roflumilast. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An environment risk assessment for roflumilast was performed. Roflumilast PEC surfacewater value is 
2.5  x  10-3  μg/L  below  the  action  limit  of  0.01  μg/L  and  is  not  a  PBT  substance  as  log  Kow  does  not 
exceed 4.5. 
Considering the above data, roflumilast should be used according to the precautions stated in the SPC 
in order to minimize any potential risks to the environment. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Eighteen  phase  II  and  III  studies  were  conducted  in  patients  with  COPD  to  establish  the  therapeutic 
dose  and  to  assess  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  roflumilast  compared  to  placebo.  The  bases  for  the 
assessment  of  the  present  application  are  the  efficacy  and  safety  data  in  patients  with  severe  COPD 
(associated  with  chronic  bronchitis)  in  the  two  pivotal  studies  M2-124  and  M2-125.  Please  refer  to 
table 3. 
There are four important supportive studies: two additional supportive 1-year studies M2-111 and M2-
112 as well as two 6-month studies in patients with moderate to severe COPD on salmeterol (M2-127) 
or tiotropium (M2-128).

2.4.2.  GCP 
The  Clinical  trials  were  performed  in  accordance  with  GCP  as  claimed  by  the  applicant.  The  applicant 
has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the  community  were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
A  routine  GCP  inspection  has  been  performed  on  the  request  from  the  CHMP  on  3  sponsor  sites 
(Germany,  Poland,  South  Africa)  for  Study  M2-125.  During  this  inspection,  three  critical  deficiencies 
were identified However, following response from the Applicant, it was clarified that the findings from 
the  inspection  have  not  altered  the  results  of  the  individual  studies  or  the  pooled  analysis.  Table  3

2.4.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic data were obtained from a number of clinical studies, from healthy volunteers but also 
patients with COPD, asthma, hepatic or renal impairment.  
Roflumilast  is  rapidly  metabolized  to  its  N-oxide  which  also  exerts  PDE4  inhibitory  activity 
(approximately 3-fold lower potency as compared to the parent compound) with 10-fold higher plasma 
AUC,  and  a  3-fold  higher  free  fraction  in  plasma.  The  N-oxide  contributes  about  90%  of  the  overall 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/464905/2010  
Page 18/46
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PDE4  inhibitory  activity  and  is  assumed  to  contribute  largely  to  the  pharmacodynamic  activity  of 
roflumilast. To estimate the combined PDE4 inhibitory activities of roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide, 
the  concept  of  ‘total  PDE4  inhibitory  activity’  (tPDE4i)  was  established  and  used  to  characterize  the 
pharmacokinetics  of  roflumilast.  The  tPDE4i  accounts  for  differences  in  intrinsic  PDE4  inhibitory 
activity,  free  concentration  in  plasma,  and  in-vivo  exposures  (AUC)  of  roflumilast  and  roflumilast  N-
oxide.  The  calculated  tPDE4i    was  used  to  evaluate  potential  precautions  and/or  dose  adjustment 
requirements in special populations or drug interaction scenarios.  
2.4.3.1. 
 Absorption  
Absorption  following  single  oral  dosing  with  500 µg  roflumilast  is  rapid,  with  C max  occurring  within 
1 hour  for  roflumilast.  Plateau-like  maximum  concentrations  of  the  N-oxide  metabolite  are  reached 
after  8 hours.  The  mean  Cmax  of  roflumilast  and  its  N-oxide  after  repeated  dosing  under  fasted 
conditions  are  between  5  and  10 µg/L  and  22  to  43 µg/L  respectively.  Steady-state  plasma 
concentrations  following  repeated  dosing  with  500 µg  are  reached  after  approximately  4 days  and  6 
days  for  roflumilast,  and  the  N-oxide,  respectively.  The  systemic  exposure  of  roflumilast  and 
roflumilast N-oxide increase proportionally after single and repeated roflumilast doses between 250 µg 
and 1000 µg.  
2.4.3.2. 
 Distribution 
With  a  volume  of  distribution  of  2.9 L/kg,  binding  of  roflumilast  and  its  N-oxide  to  human  plasma 
proteins is approximately 99% and 97%, respectively. Distribution of roflumilast into lipophilic tissues, 
its  potential  accumulation  and  the  associated  influence  of  weight  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of 
roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide is unknown.  
Studies in rats with radiolabeled roflumilast indicated low penetration across the blood-brain barrier.  
2.4.3.3. 
 Elimination 
Roflumilast is extensively metabolized via phase I (CYP450) and phase II (conjugation) reactions. The 
major  metabolite  found  in  human  plasma  is  roflumilast  N-oxide  and  its  formation  is  catalyzed  by 
cytochrome  CYP450 3A4  and  1A2,  with  the  former  being  the  major  contributor  to  the  N-oxide 
formation.  
Excretion  in humans  after  oral  or  intravenous  administration  occurs  almost  exclusively in  the  form  of 
roflumilast metabolites and mainly via the kidneys (~70% of the dose). The fecal elimination accounts 
for  approximately  20%  of  the  dose.  The  effective  half-life  of  roflumilast  after  a  500 µg  dose  ranges 
between  8  and  31 hours;  for  the  N-oxide  the  terminal  half-life  ranges  from  11  to  47 hours,  which 
favours  the  once-daily  dosing  regimen.  The  total  plasma  clearance  of  roflumilast  after  intravenous 
administration is slow.  
Polymorphisms  of  cytochrome  P450  enzymes  appear  to  have  no  relevant  influence  on  roflumilast 
metabolism.  
2.4.3.4. 
 Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose  proportionality  can  be  assumed  as  the  systemic  exposure  of  roflumilast  and  roflumilast  N-oxide 
increased  proportionally  after  single  and  repeated  roflumilast  doses  of  250  μg  and  500  μg,  and  after 
repeated doses of 500 μg, 750 μg and 1000 μg.  
2.4.3.5. 
 Special populations 
Special populations are assessed based on the concept of the tPDE4i and a population-based 
pharmacokinetic  model.  Differences  between  observed  (in  studies)  and  predicted  (derived 
from  the  model)  pharmacokinetics  were  seen.  The  population  model  is  based  on  a 
comprehensive set of all available pharmacokinetic data. Thus, the model-based values are 
considered to be more reliable and robust compared to observed values from single studies. 
A  modest  variability  of  both,  observed  or  predicted,  roflumilast  pharmacokinetics  was  seen  in  some 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/464905/2010  
Page 19/46
 
 
 
populations  but  none  of  them  is  deemed  to  be  of  clinical  relevance.  However,  the  results  obtained  in 
clinical  trials  in  some  populations  (patients  aged  >  65  years,  patients  with  a  body  weight  <  60  kg, 
women)  differ  significantly  from  the  ones  obtained  in  the  pharmacokinetic  population  model.  Hence, 
the  robustness  of  this  model  was  questioned  during  the  assessment  and,  at  the  CHMP’s  request,  the 
Applicant  commits  to  conduct  a  clinical  program,  in  the  context  of  the  post-marketing  randomized 
controlled study, in order to better characterize the PK profile of roflumilast in populations of particular 
interest (elderly and very elderly patients, patients with a body weight < 60 kg, women). 
Gender 
No  relevant  differences  in  safety  or  tolerability  between  males  and  females  were  observed  in  the 
pooled data of COPD phase II and III studies. Hence, no dose adjustment is necessary with regard to 
gender.  
Elderly 
The tPDE4i of roflumilast was comparable in young (18 to 45 years) and middle-aged (46 to 64 years) 
healthy  subjects.  A  19%  higher  mean  tPDE4i  was  observed  in  the  elderly  (65 years  and  older)  when 
compared with the young. The population model predicted a 8% to 14% higher tPDE4i of roflumilast in 
healthy  subjects  aged  60 years  to  80 years  compared  to  those  being  40 years  of  age.  No  relevant 
differences  in  safety  or  tolerability  between  age  groups  were  observed  in  the  pooled  data  of  COPD 
phase II and III studies.  
Race 
The population model predicted a 42% and 28% higher ‘total PDE4 inhibitory activity’ of roflumilast in 
Blacks  and  Hispanics,  respectively,  as  compared  with  Whites.  No  relevant  differences  in  safety  or 
tolerability between race groups were observed in the pooled data of COPD phase II and III studies. 
Impaired liver function 
Based  on  ex vivo  data,  a 18%  and  87%46%  higher  mean  tPDE4i  was  observed  in  patients  with liver 
impairment  Child-Pugh  A  and  Child  Pugh  B,  respectively  after  repeated  administration  of  roflumilast 
250 µg  QD,  compared  to  healthy  controls.  Metabolic  in-vitro  data  and  simulations  suggest  dose-
proportionality between roflumilast 250 µg and 500 µg in patients with liver impairment Child-Pugh A 
or B. Predictions for the roflumilast 500 µg dose in this population indicate that mean tPDE4i values are 
similar  to  those  extrapolated  from  data  of  the  study  with  the  250 µg  dose.  As  roflumilast  is  only 
available  in  500µg  dose,  the  use  of  roflumilast  cannot  be  indicated  in  this  population.    The 
pharmacokinetics  of  roflumilast  in  patients  with  severe  liver  impairment  (Child-Pugh C)  has  not  been 
evaluated,  and  therefore  its  use  cannot  be  recommended  in  these  patients.  The  SPC  adequately 
reflects this information. 
Impaired renal function 
In patients with severe renal impairment, the tPDE4i was 9% lower compared to healthy controls. No 
differences in safety or tolerability between healthy subjects and patients with renal impairment were 
observed. 
2.4.3.6.  Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Inhibition and induction of CYP 3A4  
CYP 3A4 is the main isoenzyme involved in roflumilast metabolism. Its inhibition by repeated doses of 
erythromycin (moderate CYP 3A4 inhibitor) or ketoconazole (strong CYP 3A4 inhibitor) did not increase 
tPDE4i  of  a  single  dose  of  roflumilast  in  healthy  male  subjects.  With  rifampicin  (strong  CYP 3A4 
inducer)  a  58%  lower  mean  tPDE4i  was  observed  compared  to  values  when  roflumilast  was  given 
alone.  
Inhibition and induction of CYP 1A2 
With  fluvoxamine  (strong  CYP  1A2  inhibitor)  a  59%  higher  mean  total  PDE4  inhibition  was  observed 
compared to values when roflumilast was given alone. This is reflected in the SPC.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/464905/2010  
Page 20/46
 
 
 
Cigarette  smoke,  a  CYP 1A2  inducer,  resulted  in  a  4%  lower  tPDE4i.  Pharmacokinetic  population 
models indicated a 19% lower tPDE4i in smoking healthy subjects compared to non-smoking ones.  
Theophylline, a CYP 1A2 substrate, did not change total PDE4 inhibition.  
Co-medications 
An  increase  of  the  tPDE4i  of  roflumilast  by  47%  and  25%  was  observed  after  co-administration  of 
cimetidine (weak CYP 1A2 and 3A4 inhibitor) and enoxacin (moderate CYP 1A2 inhibitor and weak CYP 
3A4  inhibitor),  respectively.  These  increases  are  not  assumed  to  result  in  clinically  relevant 
interactions; however, these data are included in the SPC.  
No  pharmacokinetic  interaction  of  roflumilast  with  digoxin  (substrate  for  P-glycoprotein,  membrane-
localized drug transport mechanism) was demonstrated.  
Co-administration  of  an  antacid  containing  aluminium  hydroxide  and  magnesium  hydroxide  which 
increased  gastric  pH,  did  not  affect  tPDE4i.  Consequently  roflumilast  absorption  is  unlikely  to  be 
influenced by gastric pH.  
No  relevant  pharmacokinetic  interaction  was  observed  with  inhaled  salbutamol,  formoterol, 
budesonide, oral theophylline, montelukast, digoxin, warfarin, sildenafil, and midazolam.  
A slight increase of tPDE4i was noted with a hormonal oral contraceptive (gestodene, ethinylestradiol). 
These data are included in the SPC. 
2.4.3.7. 
 Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials  
An in vitro program was conducted to assess the inhibitory potential of roflumilast and its N-oxide on 
major human liver CYP450 enzymes (CYP 1A2, 2A6, 3A4/5, 4A9/11, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1). 
There  was  either  no  inhibition,  or  inhibition  was  only  seen  at  concentrations  more  than  100-times 
higher  than  the  maximum  plasma  levels  at  therapeutic  doses.  In  cultured  human  hepatocytes, 
roflumilast did not cause induction of CYP 1A2, 2A6, 3A4/5, 2C9, or 2C19 and only a week induction of 
CYP 2B6.  
2.4.4.  Pharmacodynamics 
The therapeutic rationale to develop roflumilast as treatment of COPD is mainly based on the chronic 
inflammatory  nature  of  the  disease.  In  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  non-clinical  studies,  roflumilast  and  its  N-
oxide  demonstrated  potent  anti-inflammatory  activities,  which  are  expected  to  have  implications  on 
the  inflammatory  processes  of  the  disease.  Both  compounds  modulated  the  mediator  release  from 
neutrophils,  eosinophils,  monocytes,  macrophages,  dendritic  cells,  CD4+  and  CD8+ T-cells  at 
concentrations  achieved  in  human  plasma  with  therapeutic  doses.  The  pharmacodynamic  effects  of 
roflumilast in humans have been assessed using various biochemical markers and surrogate indicators 
of anti-inflammatory activity.  
2.4.4.1. 
 Mechanism of action 
In-vitro  studies  have  shown  that  roflumilast  and  roflumilast  N-oxide  selectively  and  potently  inhibit 
PDE4  activity.  The  synthesis  of leukotriene  B4, interleukins  (IL-2,  IL-4,  IL-5), interferon ,  and  tumor 
necrosis factor  (TNF), as well as the formation of reactive oxygen species in human leukocytes were 
reduced by both compounds. In addition to its anti-inflammatory activity, roflumilast increased ciliary 
beat  frequency  in  proximal  as  well  as  distal  airways  in  vitro,  demonstrating  its  potential  to  improve 
mucociliary clearance of the lungs. 
Assessment  of  biomarkers  in  blood,  sputum,  and  BALF  were  used  to  provide  evidence  of  the  in-vivo 
anti-inflammatory effects of roflumilast and confirm results of in-vitro and animal studies. Roflumilast 
significantly  reduced  the  influx  of  absolute  numbers  of  neutrophils,  eosinophils,  and  total  cells  into 
airways.  In  COPD  patients,  the  reduced  influx  of  cells  into  airways  was  paralleled  by  a  decrease  of 
TNFα formation (in whole blood ex vivo after in-vitro LPS stimulation).  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/464905/2010  
Page 21/46
 
 
 
The  relationship  between  roflumilast  plasma  concentrations  and  effect  has  not  been  fully  addressed. 
The tPDE4i concept should be further explored, especially to evaluate its impact on efficacy and safety 
and  to  help  to  establish  treatment  recommendations  for  at  least  black,  non-smoking  females,  potent 
CYP1A2 inhibitors and dual 1A2-3A4 inhibitors in the SPC.  Hence, at the CHMP’s request, the Applicant 
committed  to  conduct  a  clinical  program,  in  the  context  of  the  post-marketing  randomized  controlled 
study,  in  order  to  further  characterize  the  PK/PD  relationship  of  Daxas,  in  terms  of  both  efficacy  and 
relevant safety aspects especially in populations of special safety concern as listed above. 
2.4.4.2. 
 Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The  pharmacodynamic  effects  of  roflumilast  on  the  abnormal  inflammatory  response  observed  in 
COPD,  have  been  explored  not  only  considering  lung  function  variables  (e.g.  FEV1)  or  the  effect  on 
exacerbations,  but  evaluating  various  biochemical  markers  and  surrogate  indicators  of  anti-
inflammatory  activity,  including  TNF  formation,  presence  of  inflammatory  cells  in  sputum  and  in 
broncho-alveolar lavage  fluid  (BALF).  The  inference  of  the  effects  of  roflumilast  based  on  biochemical 
markers  and  surrogate  indicators  of  inflammation,  though  showed  a  positive  trend  in  some  of  the 
tests,  failed  to  show  consistency  across  all  the  different  evaluations,  especially  in  the  in  vivo  tests 
performed  in  healthy  volunteers  that  measured  TNF  levels  in  BALF  and  blood.  Only  as  a  result  of  a 
post-hoc analysis, the absolute inflammatory cell numbers were proven to be reduced in sputum, while 
differential cell counts used to measure changes in the inflammatory indexes did not show significant 
differences.  
A  thorough  QT/QTc  study  was  performed  in  which  administration  of  roflumilast  up  to  1,000  μg  once 
daily  for  14  days  had  no  effect  on  the  QTc  interval.  Cardiac  findings  after  the  administration  of 
roflumilast in this study do not seem to raise safety concerns. 
2.4.5.  Clinical efficacy  
2.4.5.1. 
 Dose response study(ies) 
Two dose-finding studies (Study FK1 101 and M2-107) were conducted. Roflumilast was used at doses 
of 250 μg and 500 μg in these studies as both doses were shown to be safe and well tolerated in phase 
I studies.  
Study FK1 101  
This dose ranging study was a double blind, evaluation of the safety and efficacy of placebo, roflumilast 
250 μg and 500 μg, in COPD. The trial duration was 26 weeks. Eligible patients were 40– 75 years old, 
with an FEV1 of 35% to 75% predicted normal, and no more than 12% response (FEV1) to salbutamol. 
They had a history of at least ten pack-years cigarette smoking and stable disease as indicated by lack 
of change in spirometry in the two-week baseline run-in period.  Patients with concurrent disease likely 
to interfere with study procedures were excluded.  
Patients were allowed to use rescue inhaled salbutamol and inhaled anticholinergics at constant dose; 
other common COPD treatments were not allowed during the study.  
The  primary  efficacy  criteria  were  change  from  baseline  in  pre-bronchodilator-FEV1  and  in  the  St. 
George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score.  
The primary analysis was on the ITT population and the comparison of roflumilast 500 µg to placebo. 
Changes in the primary endpoints within treatment groups, including placebo (baseline to end point), 
were  observed;  however,  the  between  treatment  differences  were  not  statistically  different.  This  is 
probably due to insufficient statistical power. 
Study M2-107 
The  study  design  was  similar  to  Study  FK1  101.  However,  Study  M2-107  was  larger  than  Study  FK1 
101 and included a more representative COPD patient population.  
Compared to placebo, there was a statistically significant increase in pre- and post-bronchodilator FEV1

with  both  roflumilast  doses  at  end  of  treatment.  The  Jonckheere-Terpstra  test  demonstrated  a 
significant  dose-response  relationship  (ie.  higher  increases  with  higher  doses)  for  both  primary 
endpoints, post-bronchodilator FEV1 (p < 0.0001) and the SGRQ total score (p = 0.0485) (two-sided 
test). A dose ordering with a higher response to the 500 μg dose was also seen for the number of mild, 
moderate, or severe exacerbations per patient (p = 0.0059, 2-sided; Jonckheere-Terpstra test).  
2.4.5.2. 
 Main studies 
 This  application  is  based  on  two  pivotal  phase  III  studies  (M2-124,  M2-125)  in  a  total  of  3,096 
patients  with  severe  to  very  severe  COPD  associated  with  chronic  bronchitis  and  a  history  of 
exacerbations.  Both  studies  were  52-week,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  studies  evaluating 
roflumilast 500 μg QD. 
2.4.5.2.1. 
 Methods 
2.4.5.2.1.1.  Study Participants  
Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion:  
The main inclusion criteria were the following: age ≥ 40 years; patients with a history of COPD for at 
least  12  months  as  defined  in  the  ATS  (American  Thoracic  Society)  /  ERS  (European  Respiratory 
Society) consensus statement and chronic productive cough for 3 months in each of the 2 years prior 
to baseline visit V0 (if other causes of productive cough had been excluded); FEV1 / FVC (Forced vital 
capacity) ratio (post-bronchodilator) ≤ 70%; FEV1 (post-bronchodilator) ≤ 50% of predicted; at least 
one documented COPD exacerbation (as defined by the need for oral or parenteral glucocorticosteroid 
intake  and/or  hospitalization)  within  one  year  prior  to  study  baseline  visit  V0;  current  smoker  or 
former  smoker  (smoking  cessation  at  least  one  year  ago)  with  a  smoking  history  of  at  least  20  pack 
years. Patients with emphysema only and patients with moderate COPD disease (those populations not 
responding to roflumilast in the earlier one-year supportive studies) were not planned to be included in 
pivotal trials M2-124 and M2-125. 
Exclusion criteria 
Pregnant  and  lactating  females  as  well  as  patients  with  a  diagnosis  of  relevant  lung  disease  were 
excluded. 
2.4.5.2.1.2.  Treatments 
The two pivotal studies M2-124 and M2-125 included a run-in period of 4 weeks followed by a double-
blind treatment period of 52 weeks, in which patients received roflumilast 500 µg or placebo tablets of 
identical appearance, orally, once-daily. Please refer to figure 1 for study details. 
Figure 1 - Flow-chart of visits during pivotal studies M2-124 and M2-125 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/464905/2010  
Page 23/46
 
 
 
 
Concomitant  medications  allowed  during  the  treatment  period  included  Short-acting  2-agonists  
(SABAs),  long-acting  β2-agonists  (LABAs)  and  short-acting  anticholinergics(SAMAs)  (only  if  patients 
were  not  taking  LABAs).  Inhaled  corticosteroid  (ICS)  or  oral  glucocorticosteroids  were  not  allowed 
during  the  maintenance  treatment;  however,  they  were  allowed  to  treat  the  exacerbations.  Oral  2-
agonists,  long-acting  anticholinergics  (LAMAs),  theophylline,  lipoxygenase  inhibitors  and  leukotriene 
antagonists were prohibited during the studies. 
2.4.5.2.1.3.  Objectives 
o  To  investigate  the  effect  of  500  µg  roflumilast  od  (once  daily)  on  exacerbation  rate,  lung 
function,  COPD  symptoms,  dyspnoea,  health  related  quality  of  life  and  health  care  resource 
use; 
o  To investigate the safety and tolerability of roflumilast. 
These objectives are considered appropriate for the purpose of investigating the efficacy and safety of 
a new compound in patients with COPD. 
2.4.5.2.1.4.  Outcomes/endpoints 
(Co) primary efficacy endpoints:  
o  Mean change from baseline (V2) during the treatment period in pre-bronchodilator FEV1. 
o  Mean  rate  of  COPD  exacerbations  requiring  oral  or  parenteral  corticosteroids  (moderate),  or 
requiring hospitalization, or leading to death (severe), per patient per year. 
Secondary key endpoints of efficacy:  
o  Mean change in post-bronchodilator FEV1 from baseline (V2) to each post-randomization visit 
during the treatment period. 
o  Time to mortality due to any reason.  
o  Natural log-transformed CRP (C-reactive protein) [mg/L] (mean change from baseline (V2) to 
last scheduled study visit). 
o  Mean transition dyspnea index (TDI) focal score during the treatment period. 
2.4.5.2.1.5.  Sample size 
The  sample  size  calculation  was  based  on  the  assumption  of  a  rate  of  1.25  moderate-/severe 
exacerbations in the placebo group, a reduction of 20% with roflumilast 500 µg and an overdispersion 
factor of 2. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/464905/2010  
Page 24/46
 
 
 
 
 
2.4.5.2.1.6.  Randomisation 
The  randomisation  methods  included  a  randomisation  schedule  based  on  a  computer  generated 
randomisation  list  and  stratification  by  smoking  status  and  pre-treatment  with  LABA  to  ensure  a 
balanced randomisation of patients in each subgroup.  
2.4.5.2.1.7.  Blinding (masking) 
Blinding was achieved by supplying roflumilast and placebo tablets of identical appearance (both white 
to  off-white  tablets,  packed  in  blister  packs  containing  10  tablets)  and  secondly,  by  means  of  code-
labelling of the study medication. 
2.4.5.2.1.8.  Statistical methods 
The  two  primary  variables  were  tested  in  a  hierarchical  manner  with  a  two-sided  test  using  a 
significance  level  of  5%,  and  pre-bronchodilator  FEV1  being  tested  first,  on  an  ITT  basis.  If  the  first 
primary  endpoint  proved  to  be  significant,  the  second  primary  endpoint,  rate  of  moderate/severe 
exacerbations, was tested. For the primary analysis of the primary endpoint “pre-bronchodilator FEV1” 
a  repeated  measurements  analysis  of  covariance  (ANCOVA)  model  was  used.  For  the  “rate  of 
moderate/severe  COPD  exacerbations”  a  Poisson  regression  model  with  time-in-study  as  an  offset 
variable  (correction  for  the  time  a  patient  was  in  the  study)  was  used.  The  following  factors  and 
covariates were included in the model: treatment, country (or region), smoking status, baseline FEV1 
%  predicted,  concomitant  LABA  treatment,  gender  and  age.  The  Pearson  Chi-Square  correction  for 
scale was applied, in order to account for potential overdispersion resulting from lack of independence 
of the events and/or zero inflation.

Demographic characteristics were comparable for the roflumilast and placebo treatment groups in both 
individual  studies  and  the  pooled  analyses.  The  majority  of  patients  were  White  (≥71%).  The 
proportion  of  patients  of  other  races  was  generally  below  5%  with  the  exception  of  Asians,  which 
comprised 23% of patients in Study M2-125 and 12% in the pooled analysis.  
Baseline values for lung function and COPD severity were similar in both treatment groups of the two 
individual studies, of the pooled analysis, and across studies and pooled analyses.

The percentage of patients having taken acetylcysteine or smoking cessation drugs during the pivotal 
studies  was  small.  Only  few  patients  reported  change  in  smoking  status.  These  characteristics  were 
balanced between groups. 
The percentage of patients completing the study (around 70%) or discontinuing prematurely (around 
30%) was comparable between treatment groups, both within the individual studies and among 
studies. In both pivotal studies, patients on roflumilast withdrew the study due to AEs earlier and to a 
higher extent than those on placebo. On the contrary, withdrawal rates due to COPD exacerbation in 
patients receiving placebo were higher than that of patients on roflumilast. 
2.4.5.2.2.3.  Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoints 
Pre-FEV1: 
The  LSMean  changes  in  pre-bronchodilator  FEV1  showed  increases  in  the  roflumilast  by  40  mL  and 
decreases in the placebo group by 9 mL during the treatment period (M2-124 and M2-125 pool), with a 
mean difference by 48 ml (95%CI: 35 to 62; p < 0.0001). The results were consistent in both pivotal 
studies (differences by 39 ml and 58 ml in favour of roflumilast versus placebo in studies M2-124 and 
M2-125 respectively).  
Roflumilast  significantly  improved  pre-bronchodilator  FEV1  %predicted  as  compared  to  placebo  in 
pivotal studies M2-124 and M2-125. Please refer to Table 7.

Moderate/severe COPD exacerbations 
The  results  on  moderate/severe  exacerbations  rates  in  the  primary  analysis  (ITT  population,  Poisson 
regression  model)  were  consistent  in  studies  M2-124  and  M2-125,  being  statistically  significant  in 
favour  of  roflumilast  compared  with  placebo  in  individual  studies  as  well  as  in  the  pooled  analysis 
(mean  exacerbations  per  patient  per  year:  Rof.  1.142  vs  Placebo  1.374;  RR:  0.831;  95%CI:  0.75  to 
0.92; RR reduction: 16.9%; p = 0.0003). The results are presented in Table 8.

The  effect  size  in  the  PP  population  is  of  the  same  magnitude  than  the  ITT  analysis  in  study  M2-125 
either in with the Poisson regression model or the negative binomial regression model. 
Secondary endpoints 
Significant  results  in  favour  of  roflumilast  were  shown  in  both  trials  in  the  following  secondary 
endpoints:  post-FEV1,  rates  of  patients  with  at  least  one  moderate/severe  exacerbation,  time  to  first 
and second moderate/severe exacerbation, mean differences in TDI score. Significant results in favour 
of roflumilast were also shown in the need for rescue medication in study M2-125 only. No statistically 
significant  differences  were  found  in  mortality  rates  (pooled  analysis:  42  deaths  each  group;  2.7% 
each group), rate of patients with at least one point improvement in the TDI score, C-reactive protein 
levels, symptom scores or quality of life scores, which were similar in patients treated with roflumilast 
or placebo.  
Patients experiencing a COPD exacerbation 
The number of patients with at least one moderate/severe exacerbation during the 1-year study period 
was  significantly  lower  in  patients  receiving  roflumilast  than  in  patients  treated  with  placebo  in  both 
studies and the pooled analysis (risk ratio each: 0.89). The results are presented in Table 10.

Time to first moderate to severe exacerbation 
In  the  pooled  analysis  of  the  two  pivotal  studies,  differences  on  median  time  to  first  moderate  to 
severe exacerbation were statistically significant in favour of roflumilast (Rof500 80 d vs placebo 71 d; 
Hazards ratio: 0.89; 95%CI: 0.80 to 0.98; p = 0.0185; Cox proportional hazards regression).  
The  Kaplan-Meier  Plot  for  the  time  to  first  moderate  or  severe  exacerbation  based  on  the  pooled 
analysis is shown in figure 3.

studies pool (ITT) 
Time to second moderate to severe exacerbation:  
The  median  time  to  onset  of  second  moderate  or  severe  exacerbation  was  statistically  significant  in 
favor of roflumilast in study M2-124 (Rof500 172 d vs placebo 159 d; Hazard ratio: 0.79; 95%CI: 0.64 
to 0.98; p = 0.0290) and study M2-125 (Rof500 188 d vs placebo 144 d; Hazard ratio: 0.79; 95%CI: 
0.65 to 0.97; p = 0.0214). 
2.4.5.2.2.4.  Ancillary analyses 
The  results  on  exacerbations  in  the  ancillary  analysis  (ITT  population,  negative  binomial  regression 
model)  are  consistent  in  studies  M2-124  and  M2-125,  being  statistically  significant  in  favour  of 
roflumilast compared with placebo. 
2.4.5.3.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The efficacy data from Phase II and Phase III studies for roflumilast were pooled. All efficacy analyses 
were exploratory. All analyses were made on an ITT basis. All selected efficacy endpoints were primary 
or  key  secondary  endpoints,  or  secondary  endpoints  related  to  COPD  exacerbations  in  the  pivotal 
studies.  
The main results from planned subgroup analyses in the COPD pivotal studies are shown in figure 4:

European countries), SAMA = short-acting muscarinic agonist = short-acting anticholinergic. 
The modest effect of roflumilast on pre-FEV1 was generally consistent among the subgroups analysed 
in the planned analyses in the different pool of trials:  
o  The  modest  effect  of  roflumilast  versus  placebo  on  the  reduction  of  moderate/severe 
exacerbations  were  in  favour  of  roflumilast  in  patients  with  severe/very  severe  disease  and 
consistently disappointing in patients with moderate COPD disease.  
o  The  modest  effect  of  roflumilast  versus  placebo  on  the  reduction  of  moderate/severe 
exacerbations  were  consistently  in  favour  of  roflumilast  in  patients  with  bronchitis  and 
consistently disappointing in patients with emphysema only. 
Subgroup analysis of patients with frequent exacerbations (pivotal COPD studies pool) 
In patients with severe COPD associated with chronic bronchitis and history of frequent exacerbations 
(at least 2 exacerbations in the last year), the relative risk reduction on exacerbation rates was 21.3% 
(absolute risk reduction: 0.415 exacerbations per patient per year; NNT: 2.4).  
Secondary  variables,  such  as  the  time  to  second  moderate/severe  exacerbation,  change  in  pre-
bronchodilator FEV1, post-bronchodilator FEV1 and transition dyspnoea index in the target population, 
were statistically significant in favour of roflumilast versus placebo in the study M2-124 + M2-125 pool.  
The time to first exacerbation or death with roflumilast were not significantly different from placebo in 
the target population. 
Responders’ analysis 
When  all  adverse  events  leading  to  study  discontinuation  were  considered,  there  were  no  differences 
between roflumilast and placebo in the rate of responders. However, when only serious adverse events 
were considered, the rate of responders was significantly higher with roflumilast than with placebo. 
Additional  sensitivity  analyses  of  moderate  or  severe  exacerbations  with  imputation  and  simulation 
methods  were  performed  to  assess  the  impact  of  patient  withdrawal  on  effect  size  estimates  for 
exacerbations. The results from these studies suggest that the part of the effect size which may be due 
to patients dropping out is less than 2% for study M2-124 and less than 3.5% for study M2-125.  
Completers analysis 
The completers analysis was pre-specified in the protocol and the effect on reduction of exacerbations 
was similar in patients who completed the study (-13.9%) compared with the overall study population

(-16.9%). 
2.4.5.4. 
 Clinical studies in special populations 
The applicant did not submit clinical studies to assess the efficacy of roflumilast in special populations. 
2.4.5.5. 
 Supportive study(ies) 
Of  the  supportive  studies provided  by  the  Applicant,  the  following  ones  were  of  interest  and  included 
patients  with  moderate  to  very  severe  COPD.  All  supportive  studies  were  double-blind,  randomized, 
and  placebo-controlled  studies  of  24  to  52  weeks  treatment  and  included  roflumilast  at  a  dose  of 
500μg QD. Some studies in addition used roflumilast at a dose of 250μg QD.  
Studies M2-111 and M2-112:  
These  two  1-year  studies  investigated  the  effect  of  roflumilast  on  exacerbations  and  lung  function  in 
patients with severe to very severe COPD. These studies were similar in design to the pivotal studies 
but patients in Studies M2-111 and M2-112 had a lower risk of exacerbations than that included in the 
pivotal studies. A total of 2,690 patients were included and randomized. A history of chronic bronchitis 
and of COPD exacerbations was not requested in these studies, and patients without a history of COPD 
exacerbations  as  well  as  patients  with  emphysema  were  included.  Patients  were  also  not  required  to 
show  symptoms  of  cough  and  sputum  during  run-in  as  in  the  pivotal  studies.  ICS  were  used  in  809 
(61%) of the roflumilast treated patients, whereas the use of LABAs and theophylline was prohibited.  
Daxas  500µg  once  daily  significantly  improved  lung  function  compared  to  placebo,  on  average  by  51 
ml (pre-bronchodilator FEV 1, p<0.0001), and by 53 ml (post-bronchodilator FEV 1, p<0.0001). The rate 
of moderate  or severe exacerbations was not significantly reduced by roflumilast in individual studies 
(relative risk reduction: 13.5% in study M2-111 and 6.6% in study M2-112; p = not significant). There 
was  no  clinically  meaningful  difference  between  treatments  for  SGRQ  total  score  in  both  studies. 
Adverse events rates were independent of concomitant treatment with inhaled corticosteroids. 
Studies M2-127 (228/2008) and M2-128 (225/2008):  
These two 24-week studies investigated the benefit of roflumilast treatment in patients with moderate 
to  severe  COPD  who  were  receiving  maintenance  therapy  with either  salmeterol  (Study M2-127;  n  = 
933 patients) or tiotropium (Study M2-128; n = 743 patients). The main focus of these studies was to 
evaluate  if  roflumilast  adds  additional  benefit  on  lung  function  beyond  the  effects  of  long-acting 
bronchodilators.  
In  both  studies,  roflumilast  significantly  improved  lung  function  in  patients  on  long-acting 
bronchodilators.  In  study  M2-128,  statistically  significant  improvements  in  TDI  score  and  SOBQ 
(Shortness of Breath Questionnaire) were found with roflumilast, but not in study M2-127. 
2.4.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Though statistical significance was reached for the two primary endpoints of the pivotal trials, concerns 
were raised by the CHMP with regards to the modest efficacy observed with roflumilast. Moreover, the 
effects  of  the  product  on  exacerbations  were  inconsistent  depending  on  the  severity  of  the  affection 
and the concomitance of chronic bronchitis. Finally, the clinical relevance of the modest effect observed 
was difficult to interpret due to the lack of active comparator and the absence of data on top of LABAs 
and ICS. Hence, an ad hoc expert group meeting was convened by the CHMP to discuss the questions 
of the clinical relevance of the effect of roflumilast and the identification of a population for which the 
benefit of roflumilast could be regarded as particularly relevant. 
With  regards  to  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  effect  of  roflumilast  on  the  pulmonary  endpoint,  the 
experts  considered  that  the  change  in  FEV1  was  lower  than  seen  with  other  compounds.  However,  it 
was  noted  -  also  with  reference  to  recent  ATS/ERS  publications  -  that  there  are  no  defined  limits  of 
significance  for  this  endpoint  in  the  concerned  patient  population.  The  issue  that  there  are  no 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/464905/2010  
Page 31/46
 
 
 
 
  
supportive  data  to  further  substantiate  the  marginal  effect  seen  was  raised  and  particular  emphasis 
was laid on the lack of robust quality of life data. The experts agreed that the lack of standardisation 
for  the  concomitant  medications  makes  the  interpretation  of  the  results  difficult  due  to  the  potential 
confounding effects.  
It was noted however that FEV1 might not be the most relevant endpoint for this compound due to its 
action as anti-inflammatory agent.  
Overall, the experts agreed that the clinical relevance of the effect of roflumilast on FEV1 was difficult 
to judge based on the available data since the current first line treatment (combination of LABA / ICS) 
was  not  used  in  the  trials,  neither  as  concomitant  medication  nor  as  a  comparator.  However,  taking 
into  account  the  severity  of  the  disease  in  the  patients  enrolled  in  the  trials,  in  which  a  very  small 
variation of FEV1 is expected according to the natural history of the disease, some experts felt that the 
effect shown by roflumilast on this parameter might not be negligible. 
With regard to the effect of roflumilast on the second primary endpoint, exacerbation rate, the experts 
agreed  that  this  was  closer  to  demonstrate  clinically  relevance.  However,  as  discussed  above,  the 
design of the trials could potentially introduce bias in the results. 
On the question of the population for which would particularly benefit of treatment with roflumilast, the 
experts agreed that in principle the patients with severe to very severe COPD, high exacerbation rate 
and chronic bronchitis seem to be benefiting from treatment with roflumilast therefore representing the 
correct  target  population.  For  this  population  there  is  an  unmet  need  with  available  therapies. 
However,  as  discussed  above,  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  effect  of  the  compound  in  this  population 
was difficult to assess based on the available data. 
Finally,  the  experts  felt  that  the  use  of  roflumilast  would  in  principle  only  be  foreseen  as  an  add-on 
treatment to the current first line treatment (combination of LABA / ICS) in the patients with severe to 
very severe COPD, high exacerbation rate and chronic bronchitis. Some experts could also foresee its 
use  as  an  alternative  in  the  same  patient  population  for  which  other  medications  (e.g.  combined 
LABA/ICS) are contraindicated or have been shown to have limited efficacy. However, there is no data 
to support an efficacy demonstration in this setting. 
2.4.7.  Clinical safety 
2.4.7.1.  Patient exposure 
More than 24,000 subjects were enrolled in 114 clinical studies investigating oral roflumilast, of whom 
more  than  14,000  were  exposed  to  roflumilast  at  a  variety  of  dose  levels.  The  majority  of  patients 
included in the clinical program were males and Caucasians. Even though the current application was 
intended for an indication in patients with COPD associated with chronic bronchitis, roflumilast has also 
been  studied  in  asthma,  and  in  a  limited  number  of  other  affections.  All  these  populations  are 
considered, however the Applicant focuses on an integrated safety analysis of pooled clinical studies in 
patients with COPD. The broad clinical database is complemented with results from non-clinical studies, 
and pooled data analyses based on roflumilast studies in patients with asthma are used supportively. 
Baseline  characteristics  and  medication  allowed  at  inclusion  and  during  the  studies  reflect  well  an 
overall  COPD  population,  though  the  effect  of  concomitant  use  of  roflumilast  and  ICS  was  not 
assessed. Further information is provided in table 11.

2.4.7.2.  Adverse events  
Causality 
In  the  COPD  safety  data  base,  more  than  17%  of  the  AEs  were  deemed  to  be  related  to  the 
administration of roflumilast 500 μg QD (5.4% in the placebo group).  
Common adverse events 
In addition to AEs such as nausea and diarrhoea, body weight decrease and insomnia are registered as 
common AEs. Table 12 presents the frequent AEs by system organ class and preferred term. Further 
information is provided in table 12. 
Table 12 - Patients with frequent AEs by system organ class and preferred term (frequency  
2%  of  patients  with  regard  to  preferred  term  in  any  treatment  group)  –  pivotal  COPD 
studies and COPD safety pools 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/464905/2010  
Page 33/46
 
 
 
Diarrhea 
Diarrhea,  usually  mild  or  moderate  in  intensity,  is  an  identified  common  adverse  reaction  of 
roflumilast:  585  cases  were  reported  in  5766  patients  treated  with  roflumilast  500  µg  (COPD  safety 
pool).  Of  these,  10  cases  were  considered  serious.  The  majority  of  patients  had  other  causes  for 
diarrhea, or a negative re-challenge, and resolved without sequel.  
Psychiatric AEs 
The rate of psychiatric AEs in the COPD safety pool is significantly higher in patients on roflumilast 500 
micrograms than in patients on placebo. 
Weight loss 
Weight loss registered as an AE in the roflumilast-treated patients during the first year seems small in 
magnitude  (≈  -2  kg),  and  did  not  show  a  relevant  progression  after  the  first  6  months  of  treatment. 
The  magnitude  and  incidence  of  this  effect  appears  to  be  sufficiently  and  consistently  characterised; 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/464905/2010  
Page 34/46
 
 
 
 
 
however,  the  causality  assessment  remains  unclear  as  multiple  factors  may  contribute  to  the  effect. 
Hence, given that weight loss is associated to a worse prognosis in COPD, this AE should be proactively 
monitored  and  it  should  be  considered  to  stop  the  treatment  in  case  of  unexplained  and  pronounced 
weight decrease.  
Cardiac safety 
Fewer patients in the roflumilast 500 μg than in the placebo group experienced cardiac AEs of interest 
(5.2% vs 5.7%). In all studies, the ECG recordings at the last visit were compared with those at the 
baseline visit and results from the ECG analysis show no arrhythmogenic potential of roflumilast.   
Infections 
An  increased  risk  of  infections  associated  with  the  administration  of  roflumilast  has  not  been  shown. 
However,  given  the  lack  of  clinical  experience,  treatment  with  roflumilast  should  not  be  initiated  or 
existing  treatment  should  be  stopped  in  patients  with  severe  immunological  diseases,  severe  acute 
infectious  diseases  or  patients  treated  with  immunosuppressive  medicinal  products.    Experience  in 
patients  with  latent  infections  such  as  tuberculosis,  viral  hepatitis,  herpes  viral  infection  and  herpes 
zoster is limited. 
Endocrine disorders 
Gynaecomastia  was  observed  in  clinical  trials.  In  9  out  of  the  12  cases  reported,  a  temporal 
relationship between the incidence of gynaecomastia and the administration of roflumilast was found, 
even  though  in  6  of  these  cases  other  drugs  could  also  explain  the  event.  The  pharmacology  studies 
performed  were  not  specifically  designed  to  explore  the  influence  of  the  hormones  commonly 
associated to gynaecomastia.   
2.4.7.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
In the COPD safety pool, a total of 84 deaths were reported in the roflumilast 500 μg group, 7 in the 
250  μg  group,  and  86  in  the  placebo  group.  Most  of  the  AEs  leading  to  death  were  related  to 
respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, followed by cardiac disorders. COPD exacerbation was 
the most frequently documented AE leading to death in both treatment arms, balanced in both groups. 
No death was considered treatment-related by either the investigator or the sponsor.  
Risk of suicidality 
Despite the absence of presence of concomitant causes, a causal relationship between roflumilast and 
triggering suicide is biologically plausible from a pharmacodynamic point of view and was considered as 
a “potential risk” in the safety specification. Five cases of suicide (3 completed and 2 attempted) were 
reported  in  the  treatment  group  compared  to  none  under  placebo  group.  Hence,  a  relationship 
between  risk  of  triggering  suicide  and  roflumilast  cannot  be  excluded.  Therefore,  roflumilast  is  not 
recommended in patients with a history of depression associated with suicidal ideation or behavior.  
Tumors 
Roflumilast  does  not  seem  to  have  carcinogenic  potential.  However,  as  this  population  has  been 
excluded from the clinical plan, roflumilast is not recommended in patients with cancer.  
2.4.7.4. 
 Laboratory findings 
No evidence of medically relevant pathological laboratory findings associated with roflumilast treatment 
was shown, except from the slight decrease in haemoglobin. No effects on renal function were detected 
in the studies with roflumilast. The data does not imply an increased risk of liver toxicity.   
2.4.7.5. 
 Safety in special populations 
The  AE  pattern  in  all  subgroups  analyzed  was  generally  similar  to  that  seen  in  the  overall  study 
population.  Also,  there  were  no  noteworthy  differences  amongst  the  subgroups  in  the  occurrence  of 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/464905/2010  
Page 35/46
 
 
 
individual  AEs  with  roflumilast  treatment  as  compared  to  placebo.  Weight  decreased,  diarrhoea,  and 
nausea were generally the most frequent AEs associated with roflumilast in all subgroups. Differences 
observed between subgroups were small and of no clinical relevance.  
2.4.7.6. 
 Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
During  the  clinical  program,  particularly  in  the  pivotal  studies,  no  safety  issues  have  been  registered 
with the COPD co-mediations used in the clinical study program.  
2.4.7.7. 
 Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Across  all  treatment  groups,  between  8.9%  and  14.3%  of  the  patients  experienced  AEs  leading  to 
withdrawal. The overall frequencies were slightly higher in the roflumilast 500 μg QD group compared 
to  the  placebo  group.  In  both,  roflumilast  and  placebo  groups,  COPD  exacerbation  was  the  most 
frequent AE leading to withdrawal. In the placebo group, pneumonia and dyspnea were other frequent 
AEs leading to withdrawal. Exacerbations leading to withdrawal were considered likely to be based on 
the underlying disease. 
2.4.7.8. 
 Post marketing experience 
Roflumilast  has  not  been  approved  for  use  in  any  country;  therefore,  there  are  no  postmarketing 
reports. 
2.5.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In  both  the  pivotal  COPD  studies  pool  and  the  COPD  safety  pool,  the  overall  incidence  of  adverse 
events  (AEs)  was  higher  in  the  roflumilast  500  μg  QD  groups  than  in  the  placebo  groups.  Adverse 
events judged to be causally related by the investigator, and AEs leading to study discontinuation were 
more frequent under roflumilast 500 μg QD than under placebo. Weight loss is of particular concern as 
this  adverse  event  is  associated  to  a  worse  prognosis  in  COPD.  Deaths  were  infrequent  with  little 
difference  observed  between  treatment  arms,  and  no  death  was  considered  treatment-related  by 
either  the  investigator  or  the  sponsor.  The  incidence  of  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  was  also  low 
and  similar  for  the  roflumilast  500  μg  QD  and  placebo  groups.  A  comparable  distribution  of  SAE 
incidences  under  roflumilast  500 μg  QD  and  placebo  was  generally  observed  in  the  COPD,  1-year, 6-
month,  and  3-month  study  duration  pools,  with  the  exception  of  the  COPD  3-month,  studies  pool, 
where the incidence of SAEs was low overall, but somewhat higher under roflumilast 500 μg QD than 
under placebo. A relationship between risk of triggering suicide and roflumilast cannot be excluded. In 
order to better address the safety profile of roflumilast, the Applicant commits to explore the feasibility 
of developing alternative doses. 
The proposed SPC reflects information obtained from the clinical COPD pool. The same source has been 
considered for the description of intensity and duration of AEs. The risks identified with roflumilast are 
addressed in the risk management plan and the Applicant proposed educational material for Healthcare 
Professionals.  
2.6.  Pharmacovigilance  
2.6.1.  Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The  Rapporteur  considers  that  the  Pharmacovigilance system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements and provides adequate evidence that the applicant has the services of a qualified person 
responsible  for  pharmacovigilance  and  has  the  necessary  means  for  the  notification  of  any  adverse 
reaction suspected of occurring either in the Community or in a third country.

Section 4.4 of the SmPC: In 1-year studies 
(M2-124, M2-125), a decrease of body 
weight occurred more frequently in patients 
treated with Daxas compared to placebo-
treated patients. After discontinuation of 
Daxas, the majority of patients had 
regained body weight after 3 months.  
Body weight of underweight patients should 
be checked at each visit. Patients should be 
advised to check their body weight on a 
regular basis. In the event of an 
unexplained and clinically concerning 
weight decrease, the intake of Daxas 
should be stopped and body weight should 
be further followed-up. 
SmPC Section 4.8: Weight decreased is 
included as common adverse reaction. 
Educational material for prescribers and 
patients will be distributed. 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC states that Daxas 
treatment is associated with an increased 
risk of psychiatric disorders such as 
insomnia, anxiety, nervousness and 
depression and that the risks and benefits 
of starting or continuing treatment with 
Daxas should be carefully assessed if 
patients reported previous or existing 
psychiatric symptoms or if concomitant 
treatment with other medications likely to 
cause psychiatric events is intended. 
In section 4.8 of the SmPC insomnia is 
considered as common adverse reaction of 
roflumilast treatment. Anxiety is labelled as 
uncommon adverse reaction and 
nervousness and depression as rare 
adverse reactions.

Section 4.4 of the SmPC states that due to 
lack of relevant experience, treatment with 
Daxas should not be initiated and existing 
treatment with Daxas should be stopped in 
patients with severe acute infectious 
diseases. Experience in patients with latent 
infections such as tuberculosis, viral 
hepatits, herpes viral infection or herpes 
zoster is limited. 
Educational material for prescribers and 
patients will be distributed. 
As no specific risk for mesenteric vasculitis 
/ ischemic colitis has been detected, no risk 
minimisation activities are deemed 
necessary. 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC states that 
patients with congestive heart failure 
(NYHA grades 3 and 4) have not been 
studied and therefore treatment of these 
patients is not recommended.  
Educational material for prescribers will be 
distributed. 
In section 4.4 of the SmPC a warning is 
included concerning rare instances of 
suicidal ideation and behaviour, including 
completed suicide observed in clinical trials. 
The risks and benefits of starting or 
continuing treatment with Daxas should be 
carefully assessed if patients report 
previous or existing psychiatric symptoms 
or if concomitant treatment with medicinal 
products likely to cause psychiatric events 
is intended. Patients should be instructed to 
notify their prescriber of any changes in 
behaviour or mood and of any suicidal 
ideation. Moreover, Daxas is not 
recommended in patients with a history of 
depression associated with suicidal ideation 
or behaviour. 
In section 4.8 of the SmPC a statement is 
included to point out that in clinical studies, 
rare instances of suicidal thinking and 
behaviour (including completed suicide) 
were reported. Patients should be 
instructed to notify their prescriber of any 
suicidal ideation. 
Educational material for prescribers and 
patients will be distributed. 
Diarrhoea is considered a common adverse 
reaction of roflumilast treatment (section 
4.8 of the SmPC). No reference to serious 
diarrhoea in the SmPC is deemed 
necessary. However, as information on 
serious diarrhoea is limited, further 
monitoring of events is considered 
appropriate. 
Gynaecomastia is considered a rare adverse 
reaction of roflumilast treatment (section 
4.8 of the SmPC). No further risk 
minimisation activities are considered 
necessary.

Use of Daxas in populations such as black, 
non-smoking females, might lead to an 
increase of exposure and persistent 
intolerability. In this case, Daxas treatment 
should be reassessed (see section 4.4 of 
the SmPC).  
Educational material for prescribers will be 
distributed. 
The proposed indication is defined in 
section 4.1 of the SmPC as: Daxas is 
indicated for maintenance treatment of 
severe COPD (FEV1 post-bronchodilator less 
than 50% predicted) associated with 
chronic bronchitis in adult patients with a 
history of frequent exacerbations as add on 
to bronchodilator treatment. 
Section 4.2 of the SmPC: There is no 
relevant use of Daxas in the paediatric 
population (under 18 years).  
Educational material for prescribers will be 
distributed. 
Section 4.6 of the SmPC: There are limited 
amount of data from the use of roflumilast 
in pregnant women. Studies in animals 
have shown reproductive toxicity (see 
section 5.3). Daxas is not recommended 
during pregnancy and in women of 
childbearing potential not using 
contraception. 
Roflumilast has been demonstrated to cross 
the placenta in pregnant rats. 
Breastfeeding  
Available pharmacokinetic data in animals 
have shown excretion of roflumilast or its 
metabolites in milk. A risk to the suckling 
child cannot be excluded. Daxas should not 
be used during breast-feeding.  
Pregnancies will be closely monitored 
according to established company 
procedures. 
Considering the very low likelihood of a 
pregnancy in the indicated patients, no 
further risk minimisation activities were 
considered necessary.

No further risk minimisation activities are 
considered necessary. 
The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  MA  application  is  of  the  opinion  that  the 
following  risk  minimisation  activities  are  necessary  for  the  safe  and  effective  use  of  the  medicinal 
product:   
The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) should ensure that, at launch, all Healthcare Professionals 
who are expected to prescribe Daxas are provided with an Educational pack. 
The educational pack should contain the following: 
• Summary of Product Characteristics and Patient Information Leaflet for Daxas 
• Educational material for the physician. 
 Copies of the patient card to be given to patients before they receive Daxas 
The educational material for the prescriber should include information on the following key elements: 
  The specific indication approved. The fact that Daxas is not indicated for the treatment of 
COPD patients other than those covered by the approved indication, nor for use in patients 
with asthma or alpha 1 anti trypsine deficiency. 
  The need to inform patients about the risks of Daxas and the precautions for safe use 
  The risk of weight decrease in underweight patients and the need to monitor the body weight 
at each visit and to stop the treatment in the event of an unexplained and clinically concerning 
weight decrease. Patients should be advised to weigh themselves at regular intervals and 
record the weight in the patient card. 
  The risk of psychiatric disorders such as insomnia, anxiety, depression in patients receiving 
Daxas and the potential risk of suicide. Hence, the need to carefully assess the benefit risk 
balance of this treatment in patients with existing psychiatric symptoms or with history of 
depression  and to inform  patients to report any changes in behaviour, mood and any suicidal 
ideation. Daxas is not recommended in patients with a history of depression associated with 
suicidal ideation or behaviour.

Page 41/46
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  The potential risk of malignant tumours and the lack of experience in patients with past history 
of cancer. Daxas should not be initiated or should be stopped in patients with cancers (except 
basal cell carcinoma). 
  That increased exposure might occur in certain populations and increase the risk of persistent 
intolerability: 
o  Special populations who have increased PDE4 inhibition such as black non smoking 
females 
o  Patients concomitantly treated with CYP1A2 inhibitors (such as fluvoxamine) or dual 
CYP3A4/1A2 inhibitors (such as enoxacin and cimetidine) 
  The potential risk of infections: Daxas should not be initiated, or treatment should be stopped, 
in patients with severe acute infectious diseases. The limited experience in patients with latent 
infections such as tuberculosis, viral hepatitis or herpes infections.  
  The lack of experience in patients with HIV infection or active hepatitis, with severe 
immunological diseases (e.g.multiple sclerosis, lupus erythematous, multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy) or treated with immunosuppressive therapy (other than short-term 
systemic corticosteroids) and that Daxas should not be initiated or should be stopped in these 
patients. 
  The potential cardiac risk: Daxas has not been studied in patients in congestive heart failure 
(NYHA grade 3 and 4); hence, it is not recommended in this population. 
  The limited or missing information in patients with liver impairment. Daxas is contraindicated 
in patients with moderate or severe liver impairment (Child Pugh B or C).  Clinical data are 
considered insufficient to recommend dose adjustment and caution should be observed in 
patients with mild liver impairment (child Pugh A).  
  The lack of clinical data to support the combination with theophylline and that such 
combination is not recommended. 
Patient Card 
The patient card should contain the following key elements: 
cancer 
insomnia, anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation or behaviour 
That they should tell their doctor if they have a history of any of the following conditions  
 
 
  multiple sclerosis or SLE 
 
infection with tuberculosis, herpes, hepatitis, HIV 
That patients should tell their doctor if they develop symptoms indicative of: 
insomnia, anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation or behaviour 
severe infection 
 
 
That patients should tell their doctor if they are taking any other medicines. 
That Daxas may cause weight loss and patients should weigh themselves regularly and record their 
weight on the patient card. 
The patient card should include an area where patients can record their weight and the date they 
weighed themselves and they should be asked to bring the patient card with them at each visit.

2.6.3.  Benefit-risk balance  
Quality 
The  quality  of  Daxas 
is  adequately  established.  Satisfactory  chemical  and  pharmaceutical 
documentation has been submitted for marketing authorisation. There are no major deviations from EU 
and ICH requirements. 
The quality of this medicinal product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the 
conditions defined in the SmPC. At the time of the CHMP opinion there are no unresolved quality issues 
which have a negative impact on the benefit/risk balance of the product.  
Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology 
Toxicity  studies  were  conducted  in  mice,  rats,  hamsters,  dogs  and  monkeys.  Single  dose  toxicity 
studies showed that doses of 10000 times the human oral dose were required for mortality, causes of 
which were not established.  
Subchronic  and  chronic  repeat  dose  studies  showed  compound  related  histologic  changes  in  the 
olfactory  mucosa  of  rodents, in  the  male  reproductive  organs  of  rats, in  the heart  of  dogs  and in  the 
gastro-intestinal tract of rats and monkeys. Nasal toxicity was dose-limiting in the rats and resulted in 
the mouse and hamster being selected for carcinogenicity studies.  
o  Olfactory toxicity was shown by mechanistic studies to be rodent specific. The dog and monkey 
did not demonstrate this effect. These data support the lack of risk of this effect in humans.  
o  Cardiac  lesions  were  found  in  repeat  dose  studies  in  dogs.  No  such  cardiac  lesions  were 
observed  in  other  species.  This  effect  is  linked  to  phosphodiesterase  inhibition,  and  is  well 
known to be dog-specific.  
o  Gastrointestinal  changes  were  seen  in  rats  and  monkeys  at  50  to  200  fold  the  clinical  dose. 
Effects in monkeys were considered transient. 
o  Effects  on  male  reproductive  performance  were  confined  to  the  rat.  Effects  on  female 
reproductive parameters were stress related and not considered roflumilast specific. 
The  product  was  not  considered  genotoxic  nor  has irritant  potential if  applied  to  the  skin or  eye.  The 
product is neither phototoxic nor allergenic. Roflumilast does not exhibit carcinogenic potential in mice. 
Roflumilast-related tumors in olfactory mucosa were observed in the 2-year carcinogenicity studies in 
hamsters.  It  was  concluded  that  this  finding  was  a  species-specific  effect  which  did  not  raise  special 
concern regarding the use of roflumilast in humans. 
No  embryofoetal  effects  were  noted  in  the  rabbit.  Roflumilast  is  not  considered  teratogenic.  Tocolytic 
effects and decreased postnatal survival were noted in mice at similar exposures to those in humans. 
The relevance of this finding in humans is unknown. 
The  impurity  profile  for  the  roflumilast  product  is  considered  qualified.  No  risk  to  the  environment  is 
considered through normal clinical use of the compound. 
Efficacy 
The  efficacy  demonstration  in  the  two  pivotal  trials  was  based  on  changes  to  FEV1  and  exacerbation 
rate, respectively.  
Despite reaching statistical significance, the effect of roflumilast on the FEV1 parameter is modest and 
below the range of the changes recognised as clinically relevant. Likewise, the overall effect size on the 
reduction  of  moderate  and  severe  exacerbations  is  lower  than  the  relative  change  considered  as 
minimal important differences in the literature. However, the effect of roflumilast on the lung function 
parameter is difficult to interpret because of the concomitant use of bronchodilators agents during the 
trial and the claimed anti-inflammatory properties of the compound. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/464905/2010  
Page 43/46
 
 
 
 
Roflumilast did not show an effect in the reduction of exacerbations in patients with moderate severity 
of COPD disease. In patients with severe to very severe COPD, type chronic bronchitis, and history of 
frequent exacerbations (at least 2 exacerbations in the last year), roflumilast 500μg showed significant 
effect  versus  placebo  for  both  endpoints.  Hence,  the  CHMP  requested  that  the  Applicant  limits  the 
indication  to  the  patients  with  severe  to  very  severe  COPD,  type  chronic  bronchitis,  and  history  of 
frequent exacerbations (at least 2 exacerbations in the last year). 
Secondary outcomes were generally significant in favor of roflumilast compared with placebo. The net 
benefit on the reduction of moderate to severe exacerbations was generally consistent across different 
subgroups.  
Mortality  rates  and  time  to  death  were  similar  in  the  roflumilast  and  placebo  groups,  with  a  non-
significant  trend  in  favor  of  placebo  in  the  time  to  death.  Therefore,  the  benefit  in  the  reduction  of 
exacerbations and in the improvement in FEV1 afforded by roflumilast versus placebo seems not to be 
translated into differences in survival. 
Safety 
The overall incidence of adverse events (AEs) was higher in the roflumilast 500 μg QD groups than in 
the placebo groups. Adverse events judged to be causally related by the investigator, and AEs leading 
to study discontinuation were more frequent under roflumilast 500 μg QD than under placebo. Weight 
loss is of particular concern as this adverse event is associated to a worse prognosis in COPD. Deaths 
were infrequent with little difference observed between treatment arms, and no death was considered 
treatment-related  by  either  the  investigator  or  the  sponsor.  The  incidence  of  serious  adverse  events 
was also low and similar for the roflumilast 500 μg QD and placebo groups. A comparable distribution 
of  SAE  incidences  under  roflumilast  500  μg  QD  and  placebo  was  generally  observed  in  the  COPD,  1-
year,  6-month,  and  3-month  study  duration  pools,  with  the  exception  of  the  COPD  3-month,  studies 
pool, where the incidence of SAEs was low overall, but somewhat higher under roflumilast 500 μg QD 
than  under  placebo.  A  relationship  between  risk  of  triggering  suicide  and  roflumilast  cannot  be 
excluded. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Having  considered  the  safety  concerns  in  the  risk  management  plan,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the 
proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these.

  User consultation 
The Applicant performed a readability testing (“user consultation”) and a satisfactory report has been

Risk-benefit assessment 
Benefit 
Patients  with  severe  COPD  remain  symptomatic  and  poorly  controlled  despite  available  treatment. 
Roflumilast  has  a  novel  mode  of  action  working  in  a  different  way  than  any  of  the  current  COPD 
treatment. Hence, roflumilast could be a useful adjunct to currently existing COPD treatments.  
Despite  reaching  statistical  significance,  the  effect  of  roflumilast  on  the  primary  endpoint  is  modest. 
However,  these  effects  were  observed  in  a  population  with  severe  COPD  (type  chronic  bronchitis) 
patients  with  very  poor  lung  function  and  minimal  reversibility  at  baseline.  In  addition,  the  effect  of 
roflumilast on exacerbations was reached on top of bronchodilators, not in addition to placebo. 
The lack of standardisation for the concomitant medications and potentially the lack of standardisation 
of  the  study  population  in  the  treatment  arms  were  considered  as  a  potential  bias  to  the  results.  In 
addition, the current first line treatment (combination of LABA / ICS) was not used in the trials, neither 
as concomitant medication nor as a comparator. Hence, at the CHMP’s request, the applicant commits 
to conduct a controlled study to evaluate the use of roflumilast as an add on therapy on top of LABA 
and ICS in the population defined in the indication of the current SPC. The design of the study should 
be appropriate to demonstrate a clinically relevant effect of roflumilast as add-on therapy.

An  ad  hoc  expert  group  meeting  was  convened  by  the  CHMP.  Overall,  the  experts  agreed  that  the 
clinical relevance of the effect of roflumilast on FEV1 was difficult to judge based on the available data 
since the current first line treatment was not used in the trials, neither as concomitant medication nor 
as  a  comparator.  However,  taking  into  account  the  severity  of  the  disease  in  the  patients  enrolled  in 
the  trials,  in  which  a  very  small  variation  of  FEV1  is  expected  according  to  the  natural  history  of  the 
disease,  some  experts  felt  that  the  effect  shown  by  roflumilast  on  this  parameter  might  not  be 
negligible.  With  regard  to  the  effect  of  roflumilast  on  the  exacerbation  rate  endpoint,  the  experts 
agreed  that  this was  closer  to  demonstrate  clinically  relevance in  patients  with  severe  to very  severe 
COPD, high exacerbation rate and chronic bronchitis.  
Risk 
The  following  adverse  events  were  documented  with  higher  rates  in  the  roflumilast  arm  than  in  the 
placebo arm: weight decrease, diarrhoea, nausea, headache, decreased appetite, back pain, dizziness 
and insomnia. The intensity of these events was generally of mild to moderate intensity. Weight loss is 
of  particular  concern  as  this  adverse  event  is  associated  to  a  worse  prognosis  in  COPD.  In  pivotal 
studies, the rate of AEs leading to withdrawal was superior in the roflumilast group than in the placebo 
group. In addition, a relationship between risk of triggering suicide and roflumilast cannot be excluded. 
Hence, at the CHMP’s request, the Applicant will conduct a long-term comparative observational safety 
study to further assess the risks associated with the use of roflumilast. 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
There  is  a  medical  need  for  new  treatments  for  COPD.  The  availability  of  a  new  anti-inflammatory 
treatment in severe COPD may be seen as an additional chance for severe COPD patients.  
Both  roflumilast  pivotal  studies  had  a  positive  outcome  on  the  primary  endpoints.  The  effect  of 
roflumilast is modest and the clinical relevance of these finding remain unclear. The limited reduction 
in  exacerbation  rate  is  consistent  with  the  modest  effect  observed  with  roflumilast.  The  treatment 
benefit  on  the  lung  function  parameter  is  below  the  usual  limit  of  minimally  clinically  important 
difference. Nevertheless, this modest benefit may be of interest in a severe to very severe population 
and  this  effect  was  reached  on  top  of  bronchodilators.  Hence,  the  CHMP  requested  to  restrict  the 
indication to the subgroup of patients with severe COPD disease, type chronic bronchitis and frequent 
exacerbations (at least 2 exacerbations in the last year). 
The  main  risks  associated  with  the  use  of  roflumilast  are  diarrhea,  nausea  and  weight  loss.  A 
relationship between risk of triggering suicide and roflumilast cannot be excluded.  
Overall,  the  available  data  justify  the  use  of  roflumilast  in  the  restricted  subgroup  of  patients  with 
severe  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  (COPD)  (FEV1  post-bronchodilator  less  than  50% 
predicted) associated with chronic bronchitis in adult patients with a history of frequent exacerbations. 
In order to better demonstrate the clinical relevance of the effect of roflumilast as add-on therapy, the 
Applicant will conduct a controlled study to evaluate the use of roflumilast as an add on therapy on top 
of  LABA  and  ICS  in  this  population.  In  addition,  the  Applicant  will  conduct  a  long-term  comparative 
observational safety study to further assess the risks associated with the use of roflumilast. 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that:  
 
pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed to 
investigate further some of the safety concerns.  
 
the following additional risk minimisation activities were required: see section 3.6.2.

2.6.4.1. 
 Normal opinion 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by  majority 
decision that the risk-benefit balance of Daxas in the following indication: 
Daxas is indicated for the maintenance treatment of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) (FEV1 post-bronchodilator less than 50% predicted) associated with chronic bronchitis in adult 
patients with a history of frequent exacerbations as add on to bronchodilator treatment. 
was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.

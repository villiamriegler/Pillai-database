2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Genvoya (and hence TAF, EVG and COBI when presented as components of this FDC) is currently 
approved for use in adults and adolescents from 12 years and 35 kg.  
The new data in this dossier concern the clinical safety, efficacy and PK of Genvoya when given to 
children aged from 8-<12 years. The initial dossier did not include an overview or summary of existing 
nonclinical data of possible relevance to the use of Genvoya in children aged 6-<12 years. A summary of 
relevant nonclinical information has been subsequently provided to support the use of E/C/F/TAF to treat 
HIV-1 infection in 6 year olds weighing more than 25 kg.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
In the original marketing application for Genvoya any juvenile toxicity and reproductive toxicity data that 
were available of potential relevance to children aged 6-<12 years would not have been considered since 
the application was for use in adults. This was extended during the procedure to adolescents based on 
available clinical data. Initially, the MAH has not provided a comprehensive review and integrated 
nonclinical risk assessment for use of Genvoya in children aged 6-<12 years at the proposed dose. 
Relevant nonclinical findings in adult and juvenile animals were provided during the evaluation.  
2.2.2.  Toxicology 
Toxicological findings of TFV in SIV efficacy models 
Investigators  from  the  California  Regional  Primate  Research  Centre  have  reported  results  of  antiviral 
efficacy studies of TFV in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected and non-infected rhesus monkeys.

Study 1787 included administration of TFV to 12 gravid rhesus macaques and to more than 85 infant and 
juvenile rhesus macaques from 1 day to 7.5 years of age at initiation of dosing. This age range covers the 
human  equivalent  of  prenatal,  infant,  juvenile  and  adolescent  phases  of  growth.  The  duration  of 
treatment ranged from 12 weeks to 13 years. Clinically relevant renal and bone pathology occurred only 
in  rhesus  monkeys  in  which  TFV  was  chronically  administered  at  30  mg/kg/day  by  daily  subcutaneous 
injection. Exposure levels (AUCss 140 µg·h/mL) at this dose were more than 30-fold higher than those in 
adults (4.4 µg·h/mL) after 300 mg/day TDF. Effects in rhesus monkeys were reversible by decreasing or 
stopping  exposure.  Administration  of  lower  doses  of  TFV  did  not  cause  renal  dysfunction  or  abnormal 
bone density or growth. 
Studies  were  conducted  to  assess  the  safety,  efficacy  and  placental  transfer  of  TFV  when  administered 
once daily subcutaneously to gravid rhesus monkeys during the second and third trimesters and to their 
offspring  (30  mg/kg/day).  Foetuses  (SIV-infected,  N  =  6;  non-infected;  N  =  6)  were  monitored 
sonographically and maternal/fetal blood samples were collected at selected time points for haematology, 
clinical  chemistry,  virology,  immunology  and  pharmacology  assessments.    Newborns  were  delivered  by 
caesarean section at term and nursery reared for postnatal studies. Infants were administered TFV once 
daily  beginning  on  Day  2  of  life  until  9  months  postnatal  age.  Results  showed  significant  placental 
transport  of  TFV,  with  peak  fetal  levels  at  1  to  3  hours  post-maternal  administration,  significant  and 
sustained  reductions  in  viral  load  in  SIV-infected  foetuses  and  infants  and  marked  improvements  in 
outcome (survival, growth, health) in SIV-infected offspring.  
However,  decreased  infant  body  weights  and  alterations  of  select  serum  biochemical  parameters  (e.g. 
decreased  phosphorus  levels,  elevated  ALP)  have  been  shown  to  occur  in  67%  of  TFV-treated  infants, 
with severe growth restriction and bone-related toxicity in approximately 25% of animals studied. These 
data  suggest  that there  is  the  potential  for  bone-related  toxicity  at  chronic  high  dosages,  particularly  in 
infants. 
In  Study  12968,  daily  subcutaneous  doses  of  TFV  at  10  mg/kg/day  were  given  to  2  newborn  rhesus 
monkeys  for  more than  5 years.  No  observed  adverse  effect on  their  bone  density  or  growth  was  seen. 
The steady state AUC for these 2 rhesus monkeys was approximately 19 μg·h/mL (~4.3-fold exposure in 
adult human populations). Although data were variable, no drug-related changes occurred in the urinary 
excretion  of  phosphorus,  calcium,  potassium,  protein,  magnesium  or  chloride.  Radiographs  and  DXA 
scans  of  the  animals  were  collected  regularly  from  birth  to  5  years  of  age.  There  was  no  radiological 
evidence  of  decreased  bone  opacity,  changes  in  growth  plates,  bone  formation,  or  bone  resorption 
compared  to  controls.  Bone  biopsies  at  3.5  years  of  age  showed  no  significant  differences  in  bone 
structure measurements. 
In study 7311, subcutaneous administration of TFV from 4 to 30 mg/kg/day to 39 infant rhesus monkeys 
for  up  to  3  months  had  no  observed  adverse  effect  on  health  or  growth.  No  proximal  renal  tubular 
dysfunction (PRTD) or growth restriction or bone abnormalities were observed after 12 weeks of dosing or 
at 3.5 months to 14 months after the end of treatment. 
EMA/776917/2017 
Page 8/48 
 
  
  
  
However,  in  another  study  subcutaneous  administration  of  TFV  at  30  mg/kg/day  to  13  rhesus  monkeys 
for  at  least  8  months  resulted  in  PRTD  with  glycosuria,  aminoaciduria,  hypophosphataemia,  growth 
restriction, osteomalacia and reduced clearance of TFV. Bone lesions were only observed in animals that 
also had PRTD.  
The  long  bone  metaphyses  and  the  physes  and  metaphyses  of  the  vertebral  bodies  were  incompletely 
ossified and there was overall decreased bone opacity. In 4 of the more severely affected animals, there 
were bone deformations and/or pathological fractures in the long bones or ribs. Serum phosphorus levels 
were  markedly  decreased  and  bone-ALP  isoenzyme  levels  were  increased.  Urine  samples  collected  by 
cystocentesis generally showed increased glucose and amino acid levels.  
Pharmacokinetic data collected after 11 to 24 months of TFV administration from 4 of the rhesus monkeys 
with  moderate  to  severe  bone  disease  had  a  mean  AUC  of  140  μg·h/mL  (range  101  to  222  μg·h/mL), 
more than 30-fold that in adult subjects. The adverse effects were partially or totally reversible following 
either  complete  withdrawal  of  TFV  or  reduction  of  the  daily  regimen  from  30  mg/kg/day  to  2.5  or  10 
mg/kg/day.  
In another study (26057) 13 rhesus monkeys chronically treated with TFV at 30 mg/kg/day. Six animals 
were killed. A reduction in TFV dose (n = 6), or discontinuation of dosing (n = 1) occurred as a result. In 
the  animals  killed  there  were  severe  skeletal  lesions.  Bone  histology  revealed  irregular  hyperplastic 
growth  plates  and  trabecular  hyperplasia  with  widened  osteoid  seams.  In  the  animal  with  severe  bone 
disease  and  in  which  administration  of  TFV  was  discontinued,  the  serum  phosphorus  and  ALP 
concentrations returned to normal in about 6 and 8 months, and the metaphyseal osteopenia resolved by 
18 months. For the other 6 animals whose TFV dosage was decreased to either 30 mg/kg twice weekly (n 
= 1) or 10 mg/kg once daily (n = 5), there was improvement in serum phosphorus levels and radiological 
bone opacity, and a resumption of growth within approximately 6 months. 
Van Rompay et al. (study 7311) extended their observations and reported on the longer-term safety and 
pharmacokinetics  of  TFV  in  32  infant  and  juvenile  rhesus  monkeys.  As  reported  earlier,  the  primary 
toxicity of prolonged subcutaneous TFV administration was PRTD, characterised by glycosuria, decreased 
serum  phosphorus  and  increased  serum  ALP  levels.  The  effect  of  daily  subcutaneous  administration  of 
TFV at 10 to 30 mg/kg/day for 7 weeks to 25 months was described for 29 animals.  
Seven animals given 10 to 30 mg/kg/day TFV had minimal to no evidence of persistent PRTD which was 
associated with a relatively high TFV clearance. Twenty two animals with relatively reduced TFV clearance 
had  evidence  of  PRTD  based  on  urine  and  serum  markers.  Five  of  these  animals  dosed  at  10  to  30 
mg/kg/day with PRTD had DXA scans performed. DXA confirmed low BMD in 3/5 with growth retardation 
and severe bone lesions. Two animals with PRTD that had their doses reduced and dietary supplements 
provided had normal BMD or reduced BMD. Animals that received low-dose regimens of TFV and had no 
persistent PRTD had relatively normal BMD. 
Juvenile Toxicity 
Elvitegravir 
In  a  GLP-compliant  developmental  perinatal/postnatal  reproduction  toxicity  study  that  included  a 
postnatal behavioural  evaluation  and  a  28-day  juvenile  toxicity  evaluation,  EVG  was  orally  administered 
to parental generation (F0) female Crl:CD(SD) rats (25 rats per group) at 0 (0.5% MC), 300, 1000, and 
2000  mg/kg/day  from  GD7  through  Day  20  of  lactation  (LD  20)  or  GD  24  (rats  that  did  not  deliver  a 
litter)  at  a  dose  volume  of  10  mL/kg.  F1  generation  rats  (10  rats/sex/group)  assigned  to  the  juvenile 
toxicity evaluation study were orally administered EVG from Day 1 of study, (DS 1, Day 22 postpartum) 
EMA/776917/2017 
Page 9/48 
 
  
  
  
through  DS  28  (Day  49  postpartum)  at  dosages  of  0  (0.5%  MC),  300,  1000,  and  2000  mg/kg/day  in  a 
dose volume of 10 mL/kg. 
Male and female rats assigned to the main portion of the juvenile toxicity evaluation were killed on DS 29 
(Day  50  postpartum).  Assessment  of  toxicity  was  based  on  mortality,  clinical  signs,  body  weight,  food 
consumption, clinical and anatomic pathology. 
There  were  no  test  article-related  effects  on  body  weights,  body  weight gains  and  absolute  and  relative 
feed consumption. There were no effects on haematology, coagulation and clinical chemistry parameters 
in  both  sexes.  Weights  of  the  caecum  (with  contents)  and  ratios  of  this  weight  to  terminal  body  weight 
and  brain  weight  were  increased  in  males  at  2000  mg/kg/day  and  in  females  at  1000  and  2000 
mg/kg/day; however, these increases were not statistically significant. No microscopic lesions observed in 
either sex.  
There  was  an  overall  dose-related  exposure  on  DS  1  and  28  for  the  F1  generation  male  and  female 
juvenile  rats  to  EVG  and  metabolite  GS-9200.  Low  levels  of  the  metabolite  GS-9202  were  observed.  In 
general, exposure increased with dose, in a less than dose-proportional manner for EVG and GS-9200 on 
both study days. Female rats tended to have higher EVG exposure on DS 28 than on DS 1. There did not 
appear to be any accumulation of EVG in male rats on DS 28. Based on the DS 1 and DS 28 exposures, 
there did not appear to be any accumulation of GS-9200 and GS-9202 in males and females. 
The NOAEL was considered to be 2000 mg/kg/day for juvenile male and female rats (Day 28 AUC0-t:169 
μg·h/mL).

COBI 
In  the  development  and  peri-natal/postnatal  reproduction  phase  of  the  study  (Study  number:  TX-216-
2033),  including  a  postnatal  behavioural/functional  evaluation,  daily  oral  gavage  administration  of  COBI 
resulted  in  lower  body  weights  and  food  consumption  at  75  mg/kg/day  during  gestation  and  lactation, 
however  there  were  no  effects  on  maternal  performance.  In  the  untreated  offspring  (F1  generation), 
there were no effects on survival, growth, physical and behavioural development, reflex responses, visual 
function,  gross  pathology  or  reproductive  parameters.  Based  on  these  results,  the  NOAEL  for  maternal 
toxicity for the F0 generation was considered to be 30 mg/kg/day, and the NOAEL for the reproduction in 
the  dams  and  viability,  growth,  and  development  of  the  offspring  was  considered  to  be  75  mg/kg/day 
(Maternal PND 10: Cmax and AUC0-t: 1.9 µg/mL and 9.9 µg.h/mL, respectively). 
In the juvenile toxicity phase of the study, daily oral gavage administration of COBI to F1 generation pups 
from PND 22 to 49 resulted in slight decreases in body weight and food consumption, non-adverse clinical 
chemistry changes, and adaptive changes in liver and thyroid. Based on these results, the NOAEL for the 
juvenile males and females was considered to be 75 mg/kg/day (PND 49 Cmax and AUC0-t: 3.2 and 3.1 
μg/mL, and 20.6 and 21.2 μg.h/mL, in males and females, respectively).

TAF/TFV 
No specific juvenile toxicity studies have been conducted with TAF or TDF, however data are available 
from efficacy studies of TFV in SIV-infected and non-infected rhesus macaques (Tarantal 1999, Van 
EMA/776917/2017 
Page 11/48 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
Rompay 2004, Van Rompay 2008). These studies included 12 gravid rhesus macaques, and more than 85 
infant and juvenile rhesus macaques treated from ages ranging from 1 day to 7.5 years at initiation of 
dosing. This age range covers the human equivalent of prenatal, infant, juvenile and adolescent phases of 
growth. The duration of treatment ranged from 12 weeks to 13 years.  
Clinically relevant renal and bone pathology (including reduced bone mineral density, joint swellings, and 
bone fractures) occurred in animals in which TFV was chronically administered at 30 mg/kg/day by daily 
subcutaneous injection. Exposure levels (TFV AUC 150 μg·h/ml) at this dose were more than 564-fold 
higher than those of adults after a 25 mg dose of TAF (30-fold higher than those of adults subjects after a 
300 mg/day dose of TDF). Effects in rhesus monkeys were reversible by decreasing or stopping exposure. 
Administration of lower doses of TFV (10 mg/kg/day, ~15 μg·h/ml) did not cause renal dysfunction or 
abnormal bone density or growth.  
When administered to newborn or infant rhesus monkeys at 4 to 30 mg/kg/day TFV did not cause 
adverse effects in short term studies (up to 12 weeks). However, prolonged TFV treatment (generally 
more than 4 months of daily treatment at 30 mg/kg/day administered subcutaneously) resulted in a 
Fanconi-like syndrome with glycosuria, aminoaciduria, hypophosphatemia, growth restriction, and bone 
pathology (osteomalacia) {Van Rompay 2004}. Clinical, biochemical, and radiographic 
resolution/improvement occurred with dose reduction (from 30 to ≤ 10 mg/kg/day) or discontinuation of 
treatment. 
Three animals (1 SIV-infected) were dosed chronically, beginning as neonates, at 10 mg/kg/day 
subcutaneously. After more than 5 years of treatment, there were no clinical, radiographic, or dual-
emission X-ray absorptiometry scan {Van Rompay 2004} findings of an adverse effect on bone. The 
mean AUC associated with this dosage (18 μg·h/mL) 68-fold greater than the human AUCss following a 
25 mg/day dose of TAF. 
E/C/F/TAF 
There were no notable findings in the juvenile toxicity studies with EVG or with COBI. Although TDF and 
COBI have produced effects in reproductive toxicity studies, effects on rat fetuses have been observed at 
doses  associated  with  significant  maternal  toxicity.  Neither  compound  has  shown  an  effect  on  rabbit 
fetuses. For all four agents, EVG, COBI, FTC and TDF, NOELs and NOAELs have been clearly identified and 
were  at  exposures  above  human  exposures.  No  additive  effects  are  anticipated  with  the  four  drug 
combination. No specific studies were conducted with the E/C/F/TAF FDC. 
Exposure Margins at NOAEL 
Exposure margins were calculated based upon PK derived from administration of GEN (E/C/F/TAF 
150/150/200/10 mg) to 23 HIV-infected paediatric subjects (8 to < 12 years of age and weighing ≥ 25 
kg in Study GS-US-292-0106 (Cohort 2 Part A)), 24 weeks of treatment. For Study GS-US-292-0106, 
EVG, COBI, FTC, TAF, and TFV exposures in subjects 6 to < 12 years of age were compared with 
exposures in adult subjects in Phase 2 and/or Phase 3 populations. Exposures (AUC, Cmax, and/or Ctau) 
of EVG, COBI, FTC, TAF, and TFV, except EVG Ctau, upon administration of GEN to HIV-infected children 
were modestly higher (20%-80%) as compared with exposures achieved in adults. The mean EVG Ctau, 
although lower in this paediatric population versus adult reference comparator values, was > 8-fold above 
the IC95 for wild-type virus (44.5 ng/mL). TFV AUCtau (440.2 ng•hr/mL) was markedly lower as 
compared to adult exposures derived from administration of TDF 300 mg (Gilead Sciences Inc 2016a, 
Gilead Sciences Inc 2016b). The exposures of all analytes were within the efficacious and safe exposure 
ranges established in the GEN and Stribild (elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate) adult programs.

The  MAH  states that  while  the exposure  margins are not large, effects above the NOAELs were minimal 
and  some  effects  were  species-specific.  At  doses  above  the  NOAEL  in  male  mice,  liver  changes 
(transaminase  elevations  and  minimal  hepatocellular  hypertrophy)  were  observed;  female  mice  were 
notably  less  sensitive.  In  rats,  notable  effects  were  limited  to  decreased  body  weight  gain  and  food 
consumption,  with  slight  changes  in  hematology,  clinical  chemistry,  and  urinalysis  parameters,  and 
adaptive liver and thyroid changes. In dogs, salivation and emesis, decreased body weight gain and food 
consumption, slight changes in some clinical chemistry parameters, and minimal adaptive changes in the 
liver were noted above the NOAEL.

Dog was the most sensitive species to renal and bone effects of TAF. The NOEL for renal effects in 
monkeys is greater than 30 mg/kg/day. The rat and dog showed some loss of bone mineral density at 
relatively high doses. Clinically relevant bone pathology (osteomalacia) was documented in rhesus 
monkeys (only) in which TFV was chronically administered at 30 mg/kg by daily subcutaneous injection to 
infant and juvenile monkeys at exposure levels (AUCss 150 μg•h/mL) that were more than 650-fold 
higher than those of adult subjects administered E/C/F/TAF (0.230 μg•h/mL) and 340-fold higher than 
HIV-1 infected subjects 6 to < 12 years old administered E/C/F/TAF (0.440 μg•h/mL). 
MAH conclusions 
Elvitegravir and FTC have established clinical safety profiles with no significant toxicities observed. No 
clinically relevant changes have been observed in PR interval and liver toxicity, potential toxicities related 
to COBI. Minor anaemia changes related to FTC and COBI administration were identified at doses with 
large multiples of clinical exposure; therefore, these haematological findings were not considered relevant 
to clinical use and should not cause overlapping toxicity. 
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), also a prodrug of TFV, bone and kidney are target organs for TFV, 
TDF, and TAF, and although the mechanisms of action are not known, the activity is likely related to TFV 
exposure. At the FDC TAF dose of 10 mg, TFV levels are reduced by 90% in subjects receiving E/C/F/TAF 
compared to E/C/F/TDF. The lower systemic levels of TFV and the higher intracellular levels of TFV-DP 
translate into less risk of nephrotoxicity and reduced bone mineral density loss, which are known risks 
with TDF administration. 
EMA/776917/2017 
Page 14/48 
 
  
  
  
 
In Phase 3 studies with E/C/F/TAF (GEN MAA, 0000, m5.3.5.1, GS-US-292-0102), compared to 
E/C/F/TDF, the mean percent decrease in BMD was lower in the E/C/F/TAF group and there was no 
evidence of nephrotoxicity. 
Data are available from efficacy studies of TFV in SIV-infected and non-infected rhesus Macaques have 
previously been discussed – see above.  
With respect to signs of mitochondrial toxicity, it is noted that the related clinical manifestation of 
lipodystrophy has been frequently observed with the thymidine analogs d4T and AZT, however is not 
typically associated with the cytosine analogue FTC. TAF is unlikely to cause any mitochondrial toxicity. 
TAF did not affect the amount of mitochondrial DNA levels up to 1 μM (approximately 3-fold higher than 
Cmax in 6 to < 12 year olds), the highest concentration tested, in HepG2 cells in a 10-day assay (GEN 
MAA, 0000, m4.2.1.1, PC-120-2006). The active form of TAF, TFV-DP is highly discriminated as a 
substrate by mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ relative to the natural substrate, ATP (> 10,000-fold). 
Therefore, TAF is unlikely to inhibit mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ under clinically relevant conditions.  
EVG, FTC, TAF and COBI have not shown significant adverse effects in reproductive and developmental 
toxicity studies. In the COBI juvenile toxicity phase of the pre/postnatal study in rats, daily oral gavage 
administration of COBI to F1 generation pups from PND 22 to 49 was well tolerated at doses up to 75 
mg/kg/day, with adaptive liver and thyroid changes observed at similar dose levels and exposures to 
adult animals. The NOAEL for toxicity of COBI is 75 mg/kg/day for juvenile rats where exposure on PND 
49 (20.9 μg.h/mL) was 1.3-fold higher than therapeutic human exposures at the 150 mg dose in HIV-1 
infected subjects 6 to < 12 years old administered E/C/F/TAF. 
No specific cause for concern has been identified in genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies with the 
individual agents. The combination of the 4 components is not expected to have an altered genotoxicity 
profile as compared with that of the individual agents. Because of the non-genotoxic nature of TAF, and 
the lack of pre-neoplastic lesions in chronic studies performed in rats and dogs with TAF, and achievable 
TFV exposure in mice and rats less than previously tested in chronic and carcinogenicity studies with TDF, 
the CHMP agreed that additional carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats with TAF were not warranted as 
they would not add to the overall risk evaluation or risk management of TAF. The CHMP confirmed that 
the ‘overall evidence suggests that carcinogenicity of GS-7340 is not expected to be a major risk, in 
particular since human exposure will also be low. It was agreed that the conduct of rodent carcinogenicity 
studies will not add knowledge to the already existing evidence and are therefore not needed 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/629722/2012, Procedure No: EMEA/H/SA/2410/1/2012/I). 
While the immune system in humans is not considered to be fully developed until 12 years of age (Doc. 
Ref. EMEA/CHMP/SWP/169215/2005), there have been no findings in nonclinical (including adolescent 
animals) or clinical studies to suggest any adverse effects on the immune system of children below 12. 
Additional testing in animals would be unlikely to provide clinically relevant insights regarding 
immunotoxicity. 
2.2.3.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The EMA guideline on the ERA states that “the evaluation of the environmental impact should be made if 
there is an increase in the environmental exposure, e.g. a new indication may result in a significant 
increase in the extent of the use.” The MAH provided a justification for not providing an updated ERA 
within this application. The potential use of Genvoya in children aged 6-12 years of age is not considered 
to significantly impact the sales volume. The predicted increase in sales volume for children ages 6-12 
would be less than 0.5%. 
EMA/776917/2017 
Page 15/48 
 
  
  
  
The Phase II calculations presented in these ERAs used predicted sales figures that took into 
consideration the forecasted use of FTC, COBI, EVG and TAF for the treatment of HIV-1 infection across 
the European Union (EU) economic area. As detailed in the ERAs, the highest Risk Quotient (RQ) is for 
EVG in fish (0.0004), therefore an increase in sales for Genvoya of 2500 times would be needed to pose 
an unacceptable risk. 
Given the predicted increase in sales volume (less than 0.5%) for this age group and the forecasted 
numbers use for FTC, COBI, EVG and TAF in the original submissions, the CHMP considered that the 
current ERAs remain applicable for this variation. The current ERAs are therefore considered applicable to 
the current Type II variation application.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Suitable margins of exposure fold cover exist for the findings seen in the chronic non-human primate 
studies. The conclusions of the MAH are agreed. There is now a large clinical (both adult and paediatric) 
safety data set on which the safety of Genvoya is based for the proposed patient population. In addition 
the toxicology data support the proposed patient population.   
Sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC are acceptable.  
2.2.5.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
There are no objections from a non-clinical point of view in regard to this extension of the indication in 
children form 6-12 years of age. Sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC are acceptable. 
Based on the predicted increase in sales volume (less than 0.5%) for this age group, the extended 
indication does not lead to a significant increase in environmental exposure further to the use of FTC, 
COBI, EVG and TAF. Considering the above data, FTC, COBI, EVG and TAF is not expected to pose a risk 
to the environment.

Please  refer  to  section  2.4.for  a  complete  description  of  study  GS-US-292-0106,  including  the  dose 
regimen and dosing conditions.  
This section reports the PK data from Cohort 2 Part A only.  
An  intensive  PK  evaluation  was  performed  at  Week  4  for  patients  enrolled  in  Cohort  2  Part  A.  Blood 
samples were collected pre-dose (0 hours), 5 minutes post-dose, and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 5, 8, and 24 
hours post-dose. In addition, a single PK blood samples were collected at Weeks 8 and 16. See previous 
reports regarding the bioanalytical methods, which may be summarised as shown below.

To determine whether GEN (E/C/F/TAF 150/150/200/10 mg) in children aged 8 to < 12 years weighing ≥ 
25  kg  achieved  similar  systemic  exposure  to  those  in  adults,  statistical  comparisons  were  performed 
using combined adult data from other GEN studies, as described in the following:

• 
For TAF and TFV, PK parameters from POPPK modelling in GEN-treated adults in GS-US-292-0104 
and  GS-US-292-0111  (N  =  539  for  TAF  and  N  =  841  for  TFV)  were  used  as  the  reference  for 
comparison 
For  EVG,  COBI  and  FTC,  the  statistical  comparison  was  the  GEN-treated  adults  in  the  PK  sub-
study of GS-US-292-0102 (N = 19) 
For  TAF,  a  1-way  ANOVA  model  was  fitted  to  the  natural  logarithmic  transformed  values  of  AUClast  and 
Cmax  with  treatment  group  as  a  fixed  effect.  Treatment  groups  were  defined  as  the  test  treatment 
(children in this study) and reference treatment (adults from historical studies). For EVG, COBI, FTC and 
TFV, the PK parameters of AUCtau, Cmax, and Ctau were analysed similarly. 
For each analyte, 90% CIs for the ratio of GLSMs were calculated for each parameter, consistent with the 
two 1-sided tests each performed at an alpha level of 0.05. The 90% CI were constructed and assessed 
with a boundary of 70% to 143%.  
Geometric  mean  estimates  of  CL/F  and  Vz/F  were  also  calculated  for  each  analyte  and  the  ratios  of the 
lower  and  upper  bounds  of  the  95%  CIs  versus  the  point  estimate  of  the  geometric  means  were 
compared to the interval of 60% and 140% of each parameter. 
In Cohort 2 Part A of GS-US-292-0106, intensive PK data were available for 23 children aged 8 to < 12 
years weighing ≥ 25 kg who received GEN.  
EVG AUCtau and Cmax were 34.1% and 41.3% higher, respectively, in children vs. adults and the upper 
bound of the 90% CI of the GLSM ratio for each parameter extended beyond 143%. EVG Ctau was 14.5% 
lower in children with a lower bound of the 90% CI of the GLSM ratio below 70%, but mean EVG Ctau was 
> 8-fold above the IC95 for wild-type virus (44.5 ng/mL).

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
According to the CHMP guidance (as revised and published 2016) on development of anti-HIV agents: 
A specific demonstration of antiviral efficacy in paediatric patients is not required. As it is assumed that 
the PK/PD relation for a direct acting antiviral is roughly similar regardless of the age of the patient, the 
efficacy of a dose that yields sufficiently similar exposure in children, compared to adults, would be 
inferred. The parameters that would be applied to conclude on similarity should be based on available 
data from the entire development programme, including PK and efficacy data in adults. Therefore non-
comparative data in children on the tolerability and safety of the proposed dose regimens as well as 
documentation of adherence should be generated over appropriate time-spans. Data collected over 24 
weeks would form a reasonable basis for the evaluation of a paediatric indication. 
Large inter-individual variability in pharmacokinetics is common for antiretroviral agents, and particularly 
in children, making population PK an important objective of these studies.  
The  number  of  treatment  naïve  children  is  low  in  the  EU,  and  mostly  limited  to  the  very  young.  Older 
children  and  adolescents  are  to  a  great  extent  suppressed  on  successful  therapies  and  those  failing  in 
many  cases  do  so  for  reasons  of  poor  adherence,  making  them  less  suitable  for  clinical  trials  (and 
particularly  where  PK  evaluation  is  crucial).  Therefore,  switch  studies  in  suppressed  children,  if  deemed 
feasible for the new agent with respect to the drug qualities, is one possible way forward.  
GS-US-292-0106 is in compliance with this guidance (see also sections 4 and 5). The MAH proposes that 
in children aged 6-<12 years and weighing at least 25 kg no age-specific formulation is needed. 
In the treatment-naïve adolescents (Cohort 1) in GS-US-292-0106, the plasma exposures to the relevant 
analytes at steady state were very similar to those in adults. The tables show the mean POPPK-predicted 
values for TAF and TFV in adolescents and adults.

As reported in the Genvoya application dossier, COBI exposures were lower in adolescents (Cohort 1)  vs. 
adults  in  studies  0102  and  0103  (based  on  ratio  and  90%  CI  within  80,  125%)  but  the  EVG  Cmax  and 
AUC were comparable and only the EVG Ctrough was lower (69.3%; CI 52.8, 91). FTC exposures were also 
comparable between age groups. See Table 5 in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
In  Cohort  2  Part  A  it  is  clear  that  plasma  exposures  (AUC,  Cmax  and  Ctau)  are  higher  for  all  analytes 
except  for  EVG  Ctau,  which  still  considerably  exceeds  (>8-fold)  the  in-vitro  IC95  value.  See  Table  6  in 
section 5.1 of the SmPC. Use of the adult dose of Genvoya in children aged from 6 years and 25 kg does 
not  raise  any  concerns  regarding  efficacy.  The  potential  concern  is  with  regard  to  safety,  taking  into 
account that at this time only 50 patients aged 12-<17 years have been followed and there are only 23 
treated in the age range 8-<12 years, with current complete follow-up limited to 6 months.

The MAH effectively dismiss any concerns based on the PK comparisons, describing the GM increases in 
AUC (TAF 70.7%, TFV 52.2%, EVG 34.1%, COBI 57.7% and FTC 75.0%) as modest and within the safe 
and efficacious ranges of the adult exposures in the GEN and STB programmes. In this regard, note that 
the CV% for AUCs were ~50% for TAF, EVG and COBI but ~20% for TFV and FTC. There is no discussion 
of  the  actual  range  of  plasma  exposures  or  the  potential  that  the  adult  dose  of  Genvoya,  when 
administered  to  children  with  other  intrinsic  or  extrinsic  factors  that  are  known  to  increase  plasma 
exposures  to  one  or  more  of  the  5  compounds  of  interest,  could  result  in  very  much  higher  plasma 
concentrations than are covered by the adult safety data. For example, there are several recognised DDIs 
leading  to  increased  plasma  TAF  and  TFV  for  which  no  dose  modification  is  considered  necessary  in 
adults. However, against a background of already higher exposures in children aged 6-<12 years, it is not 
possible to predict the resulting safety profile. Furthermore, the actual lowest age of children in Cohort 2 
was 8 years and the Q1 for the body weight range was 27.5 kg. 
The greatest concern has to be the plasma levels of TFV that could occur and the unknown effect of very 
chronic exposure to plasma levels much lower than those observed with TDF yet with unknown long-term 
effects on bone and renal targets in children. In this regard, the MAH points out that the mean TFV AUCtau 
(440.2  ng•hr/mL)  was  ~5-fold  lower  as  compared  to  adult  exposures  from  TDF  300  mg.  It  should  be 
noted  that  this  is  ~1.6  x  the  mean  AUC  in  adolescents  and  adults  (POPPK-predicted;  see  above)  dosed 
with Genvoya. As already pointed out in the SmPCs for TAF-containing products, the long term effects of 
exposure  to  such  levels  of  plasma  TFV  cannot  be  determined  at  this  time.  Whilst  the  risk  in  adults  and 
adolescents was deemed to be low, the higher exposures in the younger children, especially if there are 
other factors serving to further increase plasma TFV, pose risks that cannot be assessed at this time. 
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
There was concern regarding the lack of safety data to support acceptance of the higher plasma 
exposures associated with use of the adult dose of Genvoya in children aged 8-<12 years and from 25 
kg. In particular, there is concern that even higher exposures could occur chronically in the presence of 
other factors (intrinsic and extrinsic) that could further increase plasma levels of one or more of the 5 
compounds of interest. A warning has been introduced in section 4.4 of the SmPC to reflect this.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
GS-US-292-0106 
This study was confined to paediatric HIV-infected patients and commenced in May 2013.  
The design of the study overall and the safety, efficacy and PK data obtained from adolescents up to 48 
weeks  on  study  has  been  previously  assessed  in  a  series  of  application  dossiers  as  data  were  collected 
from  this  cohort  (Cohort  1;  Part  A  and  B).  These  data  have  supported  approvals  for  use  of  the  adult 
dose regimens of Genvoya, Descovy, Odefsey (HIV) and Vemlidy (HBV) in patients from 12 years of age 
and body weight 35 kg.  
The  most  recent  interim  report  submitted  in  the  current  application  covers  data  collected  from  patients 
aged 6 to < 12 years who weighed ≥ 25 kg (Cohort 2; Part A). These patients were enrolled at 5 study 
centres (1 in Thailand, 1 in Uganda and 3 in the US). Data are reported up to April 2016, at which time all 
patients  in  Cohort  2  Part  A  had  completed  the  Week  24  visit  or  previously  discontinued.  The  interim 
report submitted was completed in August 2016.

Methods 
This is an open label uncontrolled study in age-defined cohorts. 
Part A: An initial group of patients was enrolled in Part A to evaluate the steady-state PK and confirm the 
dose of GEN, in particular, to evaluate the EVG and TAF plasma PK to confirm the doses of these agents. 
All  patients  participated  in  an  intensive  PK  evaluation  at  Week  4  and  may  continue  to  receive  GEN 
through Week 48. 
Part  B:  Following  confirmation  of  EVG  and  TAF  exposures  in  Part  A  and  an  IDMC  review  of  preliminary 
safety  and  efficacy  data,  additional  patients  were  to  be  enrolled  in  Part  B  to  evaluate  the  safety  and 
antiviral activity of GEN through Week 48. No data are currently reported from Cohort 2 Part B. 
Study visits were at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24, then every 8 weeks through Week 48. Patients who 
complete  48  weeks  of  study  treatment  are  given  the  option  to  continue  to  receive  GEN  in  an  extension 
phase of the study. 
Study participants 
Patients eligible for Cohort 2 were to meet the following criteria: 
•  6 to < 12 years of age at baseline and weight ≥ 25 kg (55 lbs) at screening 
• 
Plasma  HIV-1  RNA  <  50  copies/mL  (or  undetectable  HIV-1  RNA  level  according  to  the  local  assay 
being used if the limit of detection was > 50 copies/mL) for ≥ 180 consecutive days (6 months) prior 
to screening on a stable ARV regimen, without documented history of resistance to any component 
of  GEN;  an  unconfirmed  HIV-1  RNA  ≥  50  copies/mL  after  previously  reaching  virologic  suppression 
(transient detectable viraemia, or “blip”) prior to screening was acceptable 
•  Currently receiving an ARV regimen that had been stable for ≥ 180 consecutive days (6 months) or 
had been newly initiated within 6 months for reasons other than virologic failure. 
eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 (using the Schwartz formula) 
• 
•  Clinically normal ECG 
•  Negative screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis per local standard of care within prior 6 months  
•  AST and ALT ≤ 5 ULN and total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL or normal direct bilirubin 
•  ANC ≥ 500/mm3, platelets ≥ 50,000/mm3, haemoglobin ≥ 8.5 g/dL 
Exclusions included (but were not limited to): 
•  A new AIDS-defining condition diagnosed within the 30 days prior to screening  
•  HCV or HBV infection 
•  Decompensated cirrhosis (e.g. ascites, encephalopathy) 
• 
Treatment  with  immunosuppressant  therapies  or  chemotherapeutic  agents  within  3  months  of 
study screening or expected to receive these agents during the study 
•  Concomitant  treatment  with  a  list  of  forbidden  medications  (see  previous  ARs)  with  significant 
DDI potential 
Treatments 
All patients receive 1 GEN tablet daily with food. In Part A, GEN was to be taken at breakfast. On the day 
of the intensive PK evaluation, patients received GEN in the clinic with food and after an overnight fast of 
at least 8 hours.

Objectives 
For Cohort 2 Part A, the primary objectives are: 
• 
To evaluate the PK of EVG and TAF in virologically suppressed HIV-infected children 6 to < 12 years 
of age weighing ≥ 25 kg when administered GEN 
• 
To evaluate the safety of GEN through Week 24 in virologically suppressed HIV-infected children 6 to 
< 12 years of age weighing ≥ 25 kg 
For Cohort 2 Part A, the secondary objectives are: 
• 
To evaluate the effect on viral load of switching virologically suppressed HIV-infected children 6 to < 
12 years of age weighing ≥ 25 kg to GEN 
To evaluate the PK of COBI, FTC and TFV in virologically suppressed HIV-infected children 6 to < 12 
years of age administered GEN 
To evaluate the safety of GEN through Week 48 in virologically suppressed HIV-infected children 6 to 
• 
• 
< 12 years of age weighing ≥ 25 kg 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  on-study  assessments  of  plasma  viral  load  (HIV  RNA)  were  conducted  in  a  central  laboratory  using 
the Roche COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 Test, Version 2.0. 
The resistance analysis population (RAP) was to include any treated patient with: 
•  Virologic Rebound (VR): a rebound in HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL, which was subsequently confirmed 
and with ≥ 400 copies/mL at the next visit 
•  Viraemic  at  the  Final  Time  point:  HIV-1  RNA  ≥  400  copies/mL  at  the  study  endpoint  or  study 
discontinuation who did not meet any of the criteria above 
Resistance testing included genotyping and phenotyping of protease (PR), reverse transcriptase (RT) and 
IN at the virologic failure (VF) time point. Monogram Biosciences, Inc. (South San Francisco, CA) was the 
designated reference laboratory for all resistance analyses at VF. Resistance testing was only conducted 
when  HIV-1  RNA  was  ≥  400  copies/mL,  which  is  close  to  the  validated  LLOD  of  the  assays  (500 
copies/mL). The PhenoSense® GT assay, GenoSure® IN assay, and PhenoSense® IN assay (Monogram 
Biosciences, South San Francisco, CA) were used to determine virus genotypes and phenotypes for PR/RT 
and  IN  at  the  time  of  confirmed  VF.  The  PhenoSense  GT  assay  tests  for  genotypic  and  phenotypic 
resistance to all currently approved antiretroviral drugs in the NRTI, NNRTI, and PI classes. The GenoSure 
IN assay tests for IN genotype, while the PhenoSense IN assay tests for IN phenotype. These data were 
made available to study investigators in real time for cases of VR. 
Historical  baseline  PR  and  RT  sequences  were  analysed  for  the  presence  of  previously  identified 
resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) to antiretroviral agents. 
Sample size 
For  Cohort  2  Part  A  it  was  planned  to  enrol  18-24  patients.  Using  adult  data  as  historical  control  for 
comparison  (see  under  Pharmacokinetics)  23  patients  in  Cohort  2  Part  A  would  provide  90%  power  for 
EVG  AUCtau  and  88%  power  for  TAF  AUClast  to  conclude  exposure  equivalence  between  adults  and 
children. In this power analysis, it was assumed that the geometric mean ratios were equal to 1, that the 
inter-subject  standard  deviation  (natural  log  scale)  of  EVG  AUCtau  and  TAF  AUClast  were  0.34  ng•hr/mL 
and  0.52  ng•hr/mL,  respectively,  that  the  2  one-sided  statistical  tests  were  done  at  an  alpha  level  of 
0.05, and that the equivalency boundary was 70% to 143%. 
EMA/776917/2017 
Page 24/48 
 
  
  
  
 
 
A total of 23 patients in Cohort 2 Part A would also provide > 86% power to target a 95% CI within 60% 
and 140% of the geometric mean estimate of CL and Vz of TAF respectively, assuming a CV of 53% for 
CL and 76% for Vz (based on POPPK data from GS-US-292-0104 and GS-US-292-0111 combined). 
Statistical methods 
See  under  Pharmacokinetics  regarding  the  analysis  of  the  PK  data.  The  efficacy  data  were  analysed 
descriptively. The efficacy endpoints for Cohort 2 are as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
The percentage with plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Weeks 24 and 48 as defined by the US 
FDA-defined snapshot algorithm 
The change from baseline in CD4 cell count (cells/μL) and percentage at Weeks 24 and 48 
The percentages with HIV-1 RNA < 50 at Weeks 24 and 48 (M = F and M = E) 
The Week 24 analysis window was defined as from Study Day 140 to Study Day 195 (inclusive). All HIV-1 
RNA data collected on treatment were used in the US FDA-defined snapshot algorithm. 
Results 
All  23  patients  enrolled  into  Cohort  2  Part  A  were  still  on  study  at  the  time  of  the  data  cut-off  for  the 
current report.  
There had been three important protocol deviations through 20 April 2016 that involved protocol-specified 
assessments or procedures. Two  were deviations related to DXA scan procedures and one was due to a 
laboratory sample received outside of the specified window. 
Baseline data 
Among the 23 children, 14 were female and 9 male and 18/23 were Black. The median age was 10 years 
(range  8  to 11  years).  The  median  (Q1,  Q3) body weight  at  baseline  was  30.5  (27.5,  33.0)  kg  and  the 
median (Q1, Q3) baseline Z-score for weight was −0.25 (−1.16, 0.39) with a median (Q1, Q3) baseline 
Z-score  for  height  of  −0.43  (−1.04,  0.37).  The  median  (Q1,  Q3)  value  for  BMI  at  baseline  was  15.9 
(15.2,  18.1)  kg/m2.  Median  eGFR  was  150.0  (134.7,  165.6)  mL/min/1.73  m2  (Schwarz  formula)  and 
110.5  (104.8,  122.9)  mL/min/1.73  m2  (modified  Schwarz  formula).  The  pubertal  stage  at  baseline  was 
Tanner  stages  1-3  for  all  patients.  Baseline  disease  characteristics  are  shown  below.  All  patients  had 
acquired HIV by vertical transmission and none had concurrent HCV or HBV.

Table 22.  GS-US-292-0106: Baseline Disease Characteristics of Cohort 2 Subjects (Safety Analysis Set) 
All  patients  were  receiving  a  NRTI  at  study  entry  (82.6%,  60.9%  and  52.2%  for  3TC,  ABV  and  ZDV, 
respectively), 11 were receiving a NNRTI (efavirenz or nevirapine), 5 were receiving PIs (4 LPV/r and one 
ATV/r), 2 were taking RAL and 2 TDF. 
Mean adherence to Genvoya up to Week 24 (pill count) was 96.8% and all had an adherence rate ≥ 95%. 
Outcomes and estimation 
At Week 24, all patients remained suppressed at < 50 copies/mL (US FDA-defined snapshot algorithm). 
The mean (SD) baseline CD 4 cell count was 966 (201.7) cells/μL and no patient had < 500 cells/μL.  
A  mean  (SD)  decrease  from  baseline in  CD 4  cell  count  was  observed  at  Week  2  (162  [144.6]  cells/μL), 
which  was  stable  through  Week  24  (150  [164.6]  cells/μL).  For  19/23  who  had  reached  Week  32,  the 
mean (SD) CD 4 cell count had returned to near baseline value (900 [237.7] cells/μL). 
Four  patients  had  CD 4  cell  declines  to  <  500  cells/μL  at  a  single  visit  and  all  had  resolved  by  the  next 
visit. Two had concurrent AEs of acute respiratory tract infection with a CD 4 count of 468 cells/μL and one 
had tonsillar hypertrophy with pyrexia and thrombocytopenia with a CD4 count of 359 cells/μL. 
The mean (SD) baseline CD 4% was 39.6% and the mean (SD) changes from baseline in CD4% at Week 2 
and Week 24 were 0.5%  (3.01%) and −1.5% (3.67%), respectively. For 19/23 who had reached Week 
32, the mean (SD) change from baseline in CD4% was −1.2% (4.25%). 
Only one of the 23 patients had historical genotype data available, showing HIV-1 subtype B without any 
primary RT or PR RAMs. The CSR indicates that HIV-1 subtype was not determined under the protocol.

2.4.1.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
See section 2.3.3 regarding the study design, which is compliant with current CHMP guidance. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
All the children have maintained virologic suppression for at least 24 weeks after switching to GEN. They 
all had relatively high CD4 counts at baseline. Although an initial decline in CD4 count was noted at Week 
2, the mean count at Week 32 for 19/23 who had reached that visit was near baseline, with little change 
in CD4% over the course of treatment. The finding may reflect variability in CD4 counts in small numbers 
of patients. It cannot be ruled out that very high intracellular TFV-PP levels might have impacted on CD4 
counts but the slow return to baseline provides some reassurance. Therefore this is an issue that needs to 
be monitored but it does not preclude approval from 6 years of age and 25 kg.  
Treatment adherence was high and no patient discontinued study drug. In terms of tablet palatability and 
size, one patient reported the tablet to have abnormal taste at baseline but not at Week 4 and one had a 
tablet size issue at baseline and Week 4. Both continued taking Genvoya. 
CHMP requested to investigate other possibilities to administer the current formulation to children in the 
target age and weight range who may have difficulties swallowing whole tablets. The MAH proposed the 
tablet to be split and the two halves taken in rapid sequence. This strategy will assist in swallowing and is 
less likely to cause palatability issues compared to crushing. Given that by splitting the tablet in half the 
surface area of the tablet is reduced and thus there is less exposure to the bitter taste. Stability data 
following tablets split was provided. In addition, the MAH provided a plan to address the formulation of a 
lower dose tablet that could be more appropriate for children from 6 years and 17 kg. Furthermore, a 
subset of patients from 6 to less than 12 years is to be switched to the age appropriate STR formulation 
before the end of the study. 
The CHMP considered the proposal of cutting the tablets in half and taking them in swift succession as 
acceptable. This alternative is reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC and in the PL. 
2.4.2.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
There are no concerns so far regarding efficacy of the adult dose of Genvoya in virologically suppressed 
children aged from 8 years and 25.5 kg (the actual minima included). As discussed in section 2.3.3, 
provided that children take the medication as recommended, the PK data raise no concerns over the 
potential longer-term efficacy of once daily dosing of Genvoya with food in this paediatric subset. 
Genvoya has not been studied in ART-naïve children in the age range 6-<12 years but the CHMP 
guidance acknowledges the scarcity of such children for study and that the efficacy already shown in 
treatment-naïve adults and adolescents can be assumed to apply to the children based on comparisons of 
plasma levels. It is noted that HIV-1 subtype is apparently not known for 22 children. However, all have 
maintained virologic suppression so that no analysis of response by type is anyway possible. In addition, 
it may be assumed that the data in adults on responses by subtype would be applicable.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
See  section  2.4.  for  details  of  the  design  of  GS-US-292-0106  and  the  baseline  characteristics  of  the 
patient population. 
Patient exposure 
The  median  (Q1,  Q3)  duration  of  exposure  to  GEN  was  32.1  weeks  (31.7,  32.1).  At  the  time  of  the 
interim Week 24 analysis, 15 children (65.2%) had received ≥32 weeks.  
Adverse events 
Most patients (17/23) had at least 1 AE, all of which were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity, including 9 with 
AEs considered related to Genvoya by the investigator. Adverse events reported in ≥ 5% (≥ 2 patients) 
are shown in Table 23. 
Table 23.  GS-US-292-0106: Adverse Events Occurring in at Least 5% of Subjects (Safety Analysis Set) 
MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
a Adverse events were coded using MedDRA 19.0. 
b Multiple AEs were counted only once per subject for each system organ class and preferred term, respectively. System organ class was presented 
alphabetically and preferred term was presented by descending order of the total frequencies. 
The AEs considered to be related to study drug are shown in Table 24.

b Multiple AEs were counted only once per subject for each system organ class and preferred term, respectively. System organ class was presented 
alphabetically and preferred term was presented by descending order of the total frequencies 
No  AEs  of  fractures  were  reported.  Mean  increases  from  baseline  of  2.9%  and  1.7%  in  spine  and  TBLH 
BMD, respectively, were observed at Week 24. 
Table 25.  GS-US-292-0106: Baseline Value and Percentage Change from Baseline in Spine and Total-
Body-Less-Head BMD at Week 24 (Spine and TBLH DXA Analysis Sets) 
Two patients had ≥4% decrease in spine BMD at week 24 (values were -5.276% and -6.555%) but none 
had such a change in TBLH BMD. 
The Z-score for any BMD value is the number of SDs that the value lies below or above the mean BMD of 
an age, sex and race-matched control group. A Z-score ≤ −2.0 is “below the expected range for age” and 
is considered to reflect a low bone mass or BMD, while a Z-score > −2.0 is “within the expected range for 
age”. BMD Z-scores were also calculated adjusted for height-age. A height-age adjusted BMD Z score at 
baseline that  changes  from  >  −2  to  ≤  −2  has  been  used  as  means  to  identify  possible  significant  bone 
loss as this is considered a “low-for-age” outcome. The diagnosis of osteoporosis in children is appropriate 
only  when  both  low  bone  mass  (BMD  Z  scores  <  −2)  and  a  clinically  significant  fracture  history  are 
present, which was not observed in this cohort.

Table 27.  GS-US-292-0106: Total-Body-Less-Head Standard and Height-Age BMD Z-Scores at Baseline, 
and Change from Baseline at Week 24 (TBLH DXA Analysis Set) 
For spine BMD height-age Z scores there was no change in clinical status for the 20 patients with baseline 
Z score > −2 or in the patient with baseline Z score ≤ −2. For TBLD BMD height-age Z scores there was 
no change in clinical status for the 19 patients with baseline Z score > −2 or in the patient with baseline 
Z score ≤ −2. 
Fluctuation in the bone biomarkers measured through Week 24 was consistent with the effects of growth, 
skeletal  size  and  pubertal  maturation  expected  in  children  in  this  age  range.  No  clinical  relevance  was 
derived from the changes in any of the bone biomarkers from baseline to 24 weeks.

There  were  no  renal  AEs  (including  tubulopathy/Fanconi  syndrome).  For  serum  creatinine  there  was  an 
increase  from  baseline  observed  at  Week  4  that  remained  stable  through  Week  24  (ascribed  to  COBI).

The median (Q1, Q3) changes from baseline were Week 4: 0.04 (−0.02, 0.08) mg/dL and Week 24: 0.04 
(0.01, 0.07) mg/dL. No graded serum creatinine abnormalities were reported. 
For eGFR using the Schwartz formula there was a decrease from baseline observed at Weeks 4 and 24. 
The median (Q1, Q3) changes from baseline were Week 4: −9.9 (−18.9, 4.3) mL/min/1.73 m2 and Week 
24: −6.5 (−18.7, 5.9) mL/min/1.73 m2. For eGFR using the modified Schwartz formula the corresponding 
changes were −6.7 (−14.0, −2.5) mL/min/1.73 m2 and −9.0 (−15.4, 0.0) mL/min/1.73 m2. 
No  graded  abnormalities  in  serum  phosphorus  or  urine  glucose  were  reported.  Transient  Grade  1 
proteinuria  was  reported  for  3  patients.  A  decrease  in  UPCR  from  baseline  was  observed  at  Week  1 
(−26.53%),  which  persisted  through  Week  24  (−30.33%).  For  both  urine  RBP  and  urine  beta-2 
microglobulin to creatinine ratios there were declining trends from baseline to Weeks 8, 12 and 24. The 
urine RBP to creatinine ratio percentage change from baseline to Week 24 was −31.13% and the change 
for the urine beta-2 microglobulin to creatinine ratio was −6.2%. 
No patient had a SAE or an AE that led to study drug discontinuation. 
There  were  no  clinically  relevant  changes  from  baseline  in  median  values  for  haematology  or  chemistry 
parameters through Week 24. Generally, median values were within normal ranges. However, 21/23 had 
at least 1 laboratory abnormality reported. Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities were reported for 5 patients 
but most were isolated and none was reported as an AE. Grade 3 low neutrophil count was reported for 4 
patients. Single patients had Grade 3 hypocalcaemia plus Grade 3 hypomagnesaemia at Week 4 and one 
had  Grade  3  haematuria  by  quantitative  assessment  at  Week  16.  No  Grade  4  abnormalities  were 
reported.  
No patients had elevations > 3 × ULN in AST or ALT in addition to > 2 × ULN in total bilirubin and ALP < 
2 × ULN. 
One  patient  had  Grade  1  fasting  hyperglycaemia  and  2  had  Grade 1  fasting  hypoglycaemia.  There  were 
small increases in median cholesterol (total and LDL).

Changes from baseline to Week 24 of Tanner stage in the 9 male patients were as follows: 2 males with 
baseline Tanner stage 1 for pubic hair and 4 with baseline Tanner stage 1 for genitalia had progressed to 
Tanner stage 2 at Week 24. Changes from baseline to Week 24 in Tanner stage in the 14 females were as 
follows: 4 with baseline Tanner stage 1 for pubic hair and 3 with baseline Tanner stage 1 for breasts had 
progressed  to  Tanner  stage  2  at  Week  24.  Two  females  with  baseline  Tanner  stage  2  for  breasts  had 
progressed to Tanner stage 3 at Week 24. 
Body  weight  Z-scores  increased  during  the  study.  Change  from  baseline  at  Week  24  were  median  (Q1,

Additional safety data form Study GS-US-292-0106 
The updated interim report covers the 23 subjects enrolled in Part A, all of whom completed the 48-week 
main  treatment  phase  with  22  entering  the  extension  phase.  As  of  27  February  2017,  3  subjects  had 
been enrolled into Part B and all were on study treatment.

Figure 1.  Subject disposition  
Disposition as of 27 February 2017 
At Week 48, all of the 23 subjects in the Part A FAS had HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL (US FDA-defined 
snapshot algorithm) as did the 3 subjects in Part B at Week 4 (M = E analysis). 
For Part A subjects the mean baseline CD4 cell count was 966 cells/μL, falling to 816 cells/μL at Week 24 
but increasing to 875 cells/μL at Week 48 (mean change from baseline −90 cells/μL). The median change 
(Q1, Q3) from baseline of CD4 cell counts was −130 (−299, −44) and −67 (−256, 53) cells/μL at Weeks 
24 and 48, respectively. Mean CD4% was 39.6% at baseline and 38.1% and 38.3% at Weeks 24 and 48, 
respectively. The median (Q1, Q3) change from baseline CD4% was −2.1% (−3.8%, 1.9%) and −0.2% 
(−3.7%, 1.9%) at Weeks 24 and 48, respectively. 
For Part B the mean baseline CD4 cell count was 669 cells/μL, increasing at Week 8 to reach 843 cells/μL. 
Mean CD4% was 39.2% at baseline and 39.7% at Week 8.  
One subject in Part A had historical genotype data available showing HIV-1 subtype B without any 
primary RT or PR RAMs. One subject was included in the resistance analysis population due to confirmed 
virologic rebound at the Week 40 retest visit with an HIV-1 RNA level of 1330 copies/mL. No emergent 
resistance to the actives in Genvoya was observed. Low adherence to drug was suspected, but 
confirmation was not possible as the subject failed to return a bottle of pills at Week 40. The subject re-
suppressed HIV-1 RNA to < 50 copies/mL at the Week 48 retest visit with continued treatment. 
No additional PK analyses have been generated since the prior interim CSR. Pharmacokinetic-
pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) analyses for each analyte and the most commonly reported AEs (abdominal 
pain, vomiting or respiratory tract infection) were conducted. These AEs were the 3 most frequently 
reported AEs as of this interim analysis (occurred in > 20% of subjects). Using logistic regression 
analysis, the MAH concluded there was no association between these AEs and AUC or Cmax of EVG, 
COBI, FTC, TAF or TFV. The assessor concludes (as before) that there may be a relationship between EVG 
exposures and GI events (abdominal pain and vomiting; see plot for EVG AUCtau).

Subjects had a median (Q1, Q3) exposure to treatment of 72.1 (71.7, 72.1) weeks in Part A and 8.1 (7.6, 
12.1) weeks in Part B. 
As of 27 February 2017 most subjects (84.6% [22 of 26]) experienced an AE. No AEs ≥ Grade 3 and no 
SAEs were reported. No AEs resulted in discontinuation from study drug. No deaths have occurred.  
The most frequently reported AEs were respiratory tract infection (34.6%, 9 subjects), abdominal pain 
(30.8%, 8 subjects), vomiting (26.9%, 7 subjects) and diarrhoea (19.2%, 5 subjects). All of these AEs 
were Grade 1 and most resolved within 4 days. Subjects generally experienced these AEs only once 
during the study.

Table 30.  GS-US-292-0106: Adverse Events in ≥ 5% of Subjects in Cohort 2 Part A or Part B by System 
Organ Class and Preferred Term (Safety Analysis Set) 
None of the AEs of respiratory tract infection were considered related to study drug. Four subjects had 
abdominal pain considered related to study drug on Day 1 that resolved within 4 days. Three of these 
subjects also experienced vomiting of 1-day duration on Day 1 or 2. Vomiting was considered related to 
study drug for 4 subjects. None of the AEs of diarrhoea were considered related to study drug. 
Laboratory data are available up to 21 March 2017. Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities were observed in 7 
of 26 (26.9%) subjects but no Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities were reported. Consistent with the Week 
24 analysis, Grade 3 low neutrophils was observed in 5 (19.2%) while Grade 3 albumin corrected calcium 
(hypocalcaemia) and Grade 3 magnesium (hypomagnesaemia) was each observed in one subject (3.8%).

Only subjects in Part A were included in the bone analyses because they were expected to have 
completed their Week 48 visit. BMD status was assessed using BMD Z-scores (Z-score ≤ −2.0 is “below 
the expected range for age” and is considered to reflect a low bone mass or BMD, while a Z-score > −2.0 
is “within the expected range for age” based on ISCD 2013). 
Mean (SD) increases from baseline of approximately 2.9% (4.9%) and 5.1% (6.6%) in spine BMD were 
observed at Weeks 24 and 48, respectively. Mean (SD) increases from baseline of approximately 1.7% 
(2.5%) and 4.3% (4.4%) in TBLH BMD were observed at Weeks 24 and 48, respectively. 
However, mean spine and TBLH standard Z-scores decreased during the study. The mean (SD) spine 
standard Z-score was −0.82 (0.864), −0.88 (0.860) and −0.98 (0.941) at baseline, Week 24 and Week 
48, respectively.

Mean spine and TBLH BMD height-age Z-scores were almost unchanged from baseline at Week 48, with a 
mean (SD) change of 0.01 (0.487) and −0.06 (0.351), respectively.  
One subject had a traumatic (due to a fall) Grade 1 radius fracture on Day 304 that was not considered 
related to study drug. At Week 48, this subject’s spine BMD value was 0.525 g/cm2, with a percent 
change from baseline of 8.696; the standard Z-score was −1.38 and the height-age Z-score was −0.31. 
At Week 48, this subject’s TBLH BMD value was 0.644 g/cm2, with a percent change from baseline of 
3.074; the standard Z-score was −1.43 (no height-age Z-score was available because this subject’s 
height was outside of the BMD reference data for Z-score).  
Three subjects had a ≥ 4% decrease from baseline in spine (n = 2) or TBLH (n = 1) BMD during the 
study.  None of the 3 subjects had an adverse bone outcome such as a fracture.

Table 33.  GS-US-292-0106: Part A Subjects with ≥ 4% change from baseline in Spine or TBLH BMD 
Two of the three had a ≥ 4% decrease from baseline in spine BMD at Week 24. One of these continued to 
have a ≥ 4% decrease in spine BMD at week 48 while the other (7547-2072) had a percent change in 
spine BMD of −3.894 at Week 48. The height-age adjusted spine and TBLH Z-scores were > −2.0 at 
Weeks 24 and 48 for these subjects. The TFV AUC and Cmax were similar to the mean values (mean 
[CV%] AUC: 440.2 h*ng/mL [20.9]; mean Cmax: 26.1 ng/mL [20.8]) for Cohort 2 Part A. 
The third subject had a 4.173% decline in TBLH BMD from baseline at Week 48. This subject did not have 
a baseline spine BMD value but spine BMD was 0.538 g/cm2 at Week 24 and 0.541 g/cm2 at Week 48. 
For subjects in Part A, the median (Q1, Q3) baseline serum creatinine was 0.52 (0.45, 0.55) mg/dL and 
an increase of 0.04 mg/dL from baseline was observed at Week 4 that remained stable through Week 48. 
For subjects in Part B (n = 3), the median (Q1, Q3) baseline serum creatinine was 0.51 (0.44, 0.53) 
mg/dL and a decrease of 0.02 mg/dL was observed at Week 8. No Grade 3 or 4 serum creatinine 
abnormalities were reported. One subject in Part B had an AE of Grade 1 increase of blood creatinine and 
Grade 1 AEs of leukopenia and neutropenia; all 3 AEs had an onset on Day 8 (17 January 2017) and were 
continuing at the data cut-off date. None of the AEs was considered related to study drug and none 
required treatment.  
For subjects in Part A (n = 23), the median (Q1, Q3) baseline eGFR using the Schwartz formula was 
150.0 (134.7, 165.6) mL/min/1.73 m2. A decrease from baseline was observed from Week 4 with median 
(Q1, Q3) changes from baseline as follows: 
•  Week 4: −9.9 (−18.9, 4.3) mL/min/1.73 m2 
•  Week 24: −6.5 (−18.7, 5.9) mL/min/1.73 m2 
•  Week 48: −1.5 (−17.4, 16.0) mL/min/1.73 m2 
For subjects in Part B (n = 3), the median (Q1, Q3) baseline eGFR using the Schwartz formula was 139.6 
(138.3, 177.3) mL/min/1.73 m2. An increase of 5.7 (−35.9, 29.7) mL/min/1.73 m2 was observed at 
Week 8.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  safety  data  currently comprise  23  children  aged  from  8  years  and  25.5  kg  who  have  been  followed 
for at least 24 weeks, including 15 who had been followed for 32 weeks or more at the time of the report. 
In  this  uncontrolled  study  in  which  GEN  was  commenced  in  children  who  were  already  taking 
antiretroviral  therapy,  albeit  mainly  NRTIs  and  frequently  only  NRTI-containing  regimens,  it  is  not 
possible  to  draw  any  clear  conclusions  regarding  the  safety  of  using  the  adult  dose  of  Genvoya  in  this 
paediatric subset.  
This  fact  alone  would  not  preclude  an  approval  for  use  at  least  from  8  years  and  ~30  kg  (near  to  the 
mean/median baseline body weight) if the plasma exposures were very comparable to those observed in 
adults.  However,  as  discussed  in  section  2.3.3,  plasma  exposures  are  substantially  higher  in  children 
aged  8-<12  years  and  with  CV%  values  ~50%  for  AUCs  of  TAF,  EVG  and  COBI  and  ~20%  for  AUCs  of 
TFV  and  FTC.  Graphical  representations  of  AUCs  by  actual  baseline  body  weight  are  not  found  in  the 
application, nor is there any discussion of the nonclinical safety margins that would apply to the paediatric 
exposures.  Furthermore,  these  children  were  treated  under  a  protocol  in  which  a  large  number  of 
potentially  interacting  concomitant  medications  were  forbidden  and  in  which  the  actual  concomitant 
medications were almost all antibacterial agents, analgesics and vaccines. 
The actual safety data appear to be as expected based on prior data in older patients.  No Grade 3 or 4 
clinical AEs were reported so far and the range of events is not unexpected for the population treated. 
The effects on serum creatinine and eGFR most likely reflect initiation of COBI, with stable values after ~ 
Week 4. There was a decrease from baseline in proteinuria assessed by UPCR. Thus far the data do not 
suggest renal toxicity in the population studied. 
The safety profile over 48 weeks is similar to that reported at 24 weeks. Mean spine and TBLH standard 
Z-scores  decreased  during  the  study  but  mean  spine  and  TBLH  BMD  height-age  Z-scores  were  almost 
unchanged from baseline at Week 48. Three of 23 subjects had a ≥  4% decrease from baseline in spine 
(2)  or  TBLH  (1)  BMD  at  Week  24  and/or  Week  48.  For  two  the  height-age  adjusted  spine  and  TBLH  Z-
scores were > −2.0 at Weeks 24 and 48. The third subject (9983-2061) had a 4.173% decline in TBLH 
BMD  from  baseline  at  Week  48.  With  a  safety  dataset  of  23  exposed  for  48  weeks  and  3  others  for  8 
weeks the data are very limited. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The actual safety data reported do not raise any very major concerns but they are very limited in terms 
of number of patients and duration of treatment. In light of the potential concerns raised by the plasma 
concentrations, especially those of TFV, it is not possible to conclude that the long-term safety profile of 
the  adult  dose  of  Genvoya  in  children  aged  6-12  years  and  from  25  kg  is  acceptable.  Furthermore,  the 
actual minimum age treated was 8 years and it appears that very few children weighed < 30 kg.  
The  safety  profile  over  48  weeks  is  similar  to  that  reported  at  24  weeks.  With  a  safety  dataset  of  23 
exposed for 48 weeks and 3 others for 8 weeks the data are very limited. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

Section 4.6 of the SmPC provides information on 
pregnancy in humans for the emtricitabine 
component and in animals for all components of 
Genvoya, and notes that Genvoya should be used 
during pregnancy only if the potential benefit 
justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 
Section 4.6 of the SmPC also provides information 
on excretion of emtricitabine in human milk, that it 
is unknown whether elvitegravir, cobicistat and

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.1.  Main clinical study 
The MAH has an ongoing study (GS-US-292-0106) in paediatric patients. An updated clinical study report 
on Cohort 2 was provided with the responses during this procedure. This reports data to at least week 48 
(median 72 weeks) for 23 subjects in Cohort 2 Part A (aged from 8 years and 25.5kg) and short term 
data (median 8 weeks) for 3 subjects enrolled into Part B. The approach that has been taken by the MAH 
to evaluate the use of Genvoya in HIV-infected children is compliant with current CHMP guidance. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
All the children in Cohort 2 Part A of the study have maintained their pre-study virologic suppression for 
at least 48 weeks after switching to GEN. They all had relatively high CD4 counts at baseline. Although an 
initial decline in CD4 count was noted at Week 2, the mean count then increased to near baseline by 
week 48, with little change in CD4% over the course of treatment. The finding may reflect variability in 
CD4 counts in small numbers of patients. It cannot be ruled out that very high intracellular TFV-PP levels 
might have impacted on CD4 counts but the slow return to baseline provides some reassurance. 
Therefore this is an issue that needs to be monitored but it does not preclude approval from 6 years of 
age and 25 kg.   
Treatment adherence was high and no patient discontinued study drug. In terms of tablet palatability and 
size, one patient reported the tablet to have abnormal taste at baseline but not at Week 4 and one had a 
tablet size issue at baseline and Week 4. Both continued taking Genvoya. Therefore it seems that the 
adult dose form is acceptable in children from 8 years of age (the minimum age studied).In addition, the 
MAH committed to develop an age appropriate formulation and a subset of patients from 6 to less than 
12 years are to be switched to the age appropriate STR formulation before the end of the study. 
Comparisons of PK data obtained from these children at Week 4 and prior data obtained from adolescents 
and adults (as reflected tables 5 and 6 in section 5.2 of the SmPC) show that plasma exposures (AUC, 
Cmax and Ctau) are higher for all analytes in Cohort 2 Part A children except for EVG Ctau, which is still >8-
fold the in-vitro IC95 value.  
Thus, based on 48-Week data and the PK comparisons, the use of the adult dose of Genvoya in children 
aged from 8 years and 25 kg does not raise any concerns regarding efficacy. Furthermore, use from 6 
years is acceptable. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There are only 23 children in Cohort 2 Part A (with 3 so far in Part B) and the data extend to completion 
of 48 weeks dosing. Nevertheless, if adherence remains high as they enter adolescence there is no a 
priori reason to expect that virologic suppression will not be maintained. Similarly, although all children 
were already virologically suppressed when they commenced Genvoya, the plasma exposures support 
expectation that responses in treatment–naïve children in this age group would be similar to those in 
adults assuming a similar level of adherence prevails. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The actual safety profile appears to be as expected based on prior data in older patients. No Grade 3 or 4 
clinical AEs were reported so far (27 February 2017 cut-off date) and the range of events is not 
EMA/776917/2017 
Page 43/48 
 
  
  
  
unexpected for the population treated. The effects on serum creatinine and eGFR most likely reflect 
initiation of COBI, with stable values after ~ Week 4. There was a decrease from baseline in proteinuria 
assessed by UPCR. Thus far the data do not suggest renal toxicity in the population studied. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety data currently comprise 23 children in Cohort 2 Part A aged from 8 years and 25.5 kg who 
have been followed for a median of 72 weeks and data to week 8 (median) for another 3 children. Since 
this is an uncontrolled study, and since all children were already taking antiretroviral therapy, albeit 
mainly NRTIs and frequently only NRTI-containing regimens, it is not possible to draw firm conclusions 
regarding the safety of using the adult dose of Genvoya in this paediatric subset.  
This fact alone would not preclude an approval for use at from 6 years and 25 kg body weight if the 
plasma exposures were very comparable to those observed in adults. However, plasma exposures are 
substantially higher in children aged 8-<12 years, with CV% values ~50% for AUCs of TAF, EVG and 
COBI and ~20% for AUCs of TFV and FTC. Furthermore, these children were treated under a protocol in 
which a large number of potentially interacting concomitant medications were forbidden and in which the 
actual concomitant medications were almost all antibacterial agents, analgesics and vaccines. 
The MAH describes the GM increases in AUC (TAF 70.7%, TFV 52.2%, EVG 34.1%, COBI 57.7% and FTC 
75.0%) as modest and within the safe and efficacious ranges of the adult exposures in the GEN and STB 
programmes. In this regard, note that the CV% for AUCs were ~50% for TAF, EVG and COBI but ~20% 
for TFV and FTC. There remains a potential that when the adult dose of Genvoya is administered to 
children with other intrinsic or extrinsic factors known to increase plasma exposures to one or more of the 
analytes of interest could result in higher plasma concentrations than are covered by the adult safety 
data. For example, there are several recognised DDIs leading to increased plasma TAF and TFV for which 
no dose modification is considered necessary in adults. However, against a background of already higher 
exposures in children aged 6-<12 years, it is not possible to predict the resulting safety profile.  
The greatest concern has to be the plasma levels of TFV that could occur and the unknown effect of very 
chronic exposure to plasma levels much lower than those observed with TDF yet with unknown long-term 
effects on bone and renal targets in children. In Cohort 2 Part A the mean TFV AUCtau (440.2 ng•hr/mL) 
was ~5-fold lower as compared to adult exposures from TDF 300 mg. It should be noted that this is ~1.6 
x the mean AUC in adolescents and adults (POPPK-predicted) dosed with Genvoya.  
Furthermore, the MAH compares TFV exposures in children aged 6-<12 years dosed with Genvoya to 
those in children aged 6-<12 years and adolescents dosed with regimens containing TDF. For TDF there 
are alternative formulations available for use in children aged < 12 years. The recommended daily doses 
of TDF for HIV-1 infected paediatric patients aged 6 to < 12 years are 123, 163 or 204 mg using reduced 
dose tablets for weights 17-22, 22 kg to < 28 kg and 28 kg to < 35 kg, respectively. Alternatively, 
equivalent doses can be administered using 33 mg/g granules with further dose adjustments for patients 
aged 2 to < 12 years who weigh < 17 kg. Importantly, the use of TDF in paediatric patients from 2 years 
and Truvada from 12 years is restricted to patients with resistance or toxicities that preclude the use of 
alternative first line agents. In contrast, use of Genvoya in adolescents and adults is restricted to patients 
with HIV-1 that does not have mutations associated with resistance to EVG, FTC or TFV.  
It is accepted that the higher exposures observed to TAF, FTC, EVG and COBI may not be a major 
concern based on what is known about their safety profiles. It is also accepted that TFV exposures in the 
paediatric subjects dosed with Genvoya in study 106 are much lower than those documented in small 
numbers of children aged 6 to < 12 years treated with TDF and adolescents aged 12 to < 18 years 
treated with Stribild. However, it must be remembered that in the review of the TAF-containing products 
EMA/776917/2017 
Page 44/48 
 
  
  
  
the concerns regarding the unknown effect of long-term exposure to TFV levels typically associated with 
TAF was reflected in all the SmPCs as follows:  
Nephrotoxicity 
A potential risk of nephrotoxicity resulting from chronic exposure to low levels of tenofovir due to dosing 
with tenofovir alafenamide cannot be excluded (see section 5.3). 
The comparisons made between TFV exposures in children aged 6-<12 years and adults with moderate 
renal impairment (eGFR: 30 to 60 mL/min) after daily dosing with Genvoya do not take into account the 
fact that use in the latter was mainly based on considerations of the relative effects of TAF vs. TDF on 
renal function markers. It is not agreed with the MAH that safety has been established for the range of 
exposures in these adults, only that the data available suggested there were lesser safety issues with TAF 
vs. TDF. Therefore the comparison made does not address the concerns regarding long-term exposure of 
children aged 6-<12 years to TFV at the levels observed with the adult dose of Genvoya. 
Taking into account the TFV levels, mean increases from baseline of 2.9% and 5.1% in spine BMD were 
observed at Weeks 24 and 48, respectively, while corresponding mean increases from baseline in TBLH 
BMD were 1.7% and 4.3%. Mean spine and TBLH standard Z-scores decreased during the study but 
mean spine and TBLH BMD height-age Z-scores were almost unchanged from baseline at Week 48. Three 
subjects had a ≥ 4% decrease from baseline in spine (n = 2) or TBLH (n = 1) BMD during the study.  
Two had a ≥ 4% decrease from baseline in spine BMD at Week 24. One continued to have a ≥ 4% 
decrease in spine BMD at week 48 while the other had a percent change in spine BMD of −3.894 at Week 
48. The height-age adjusted spine and TBLH Z-scores were > −2.0 at Weeks 24 and 48 for these 
subjects and they had TFV AUC and Cmax values similar to the mean values. The third subject had a 
4.173% decline in TBLH BMD from baseline at Week 48.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
There is a need for better and simple HIV treatment regimens for children. There are no concerns so far 
regarding efficacy of the adult dose of Genvoya in virologically suppressed children aged from 8 years and 
25.5 kg (the actual minima included). Provided that children take the medication as recommended, the 
PK data raise no concerns over the potential longer-term efficacy of once daily dosing of Genvoya with 
food in this paediatric subset.   
Genvoya has not been studied in ART-naïve children in the age range 6-<12 years but the CHMP 
guidance acknowledges the scarcity of such children for study and that the efficacy already shown in 
treatment-naïve adults and adolescents can be assumed to apply to ART-naïve children based on 
comparisons of plasma levels.  
There is an important potential concern with regard to safety due to the plasma exposures reported and 
the potential effects, especially for TFV in growing children. This concern takes into account that that at 
this time only 50 patients aged 12-<17 years have been followed and there are only 23 treated in the age 
range 8-<12 years for whom there is a median follow-up of 72 weeks.  
While the actual safety data reported do not raise any very major concerns, they are very limited in 
number of patients and duration of treatment. In light of the potential concerns raised by the plasma 
concentrations, especially those of TFV, it is not possible to conclude that the long-term safety profile of 
the adult dose of Genvoya in children aged 6-12 years and from 25 kg will resemble that in older 
subjects. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The concerns regarding the safety of long-term use of the adult dose of Genvoya in children aged from 6-
< 12 years and from 25 kg body weight cannot be resolved by the data available from study 106 and 
based on comparisons of plasma levels across age groups, studies and formulations. Nevertheless, taking 
into account that use of Genvoya is anyway restricted to treatment of HIV-1 without mutations associated 
with resistance to EVG, FTC TFV it is proposed that use could be allowed in this age and weight range if it 
is additionally restricted to children with toxicities precluding the use of alternative first-line regimens.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
There are potential safety concerns raised by the PK data that cannot be addressed by the data currently 
available. However, recognising the efficacy of Genvoya and the need for simple treatment regimens, it is 
proposed that the benefit-risk could be favourable if use in children aged from 6-<12 years and from 25 
kg is restricted such that section 4.1 of the SmPC reads as follows: 
Genvoya is indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV 1) infection without any

known mutations associated with resistance to the integrase inhibitor class, emtricitabine or tenofovir as 
follows: 
- 
- 
In adults and adolescents aged from 12 years and with body weight at least 35 kg 
In children aged from 6 years and with body weight at least 25 kg for whom alternative regimens 
are unsuitable due to toxicities.   
See sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1. 
4.  Recommendations

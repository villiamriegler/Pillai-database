1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

In line with the results of the clinical study EP00-501 
'headache' and 'hypothyroidism' to the list of adverse 
drug reactions (ADRs) with frequency not known 
(PATRO children), SmPC section 4.8 was updated as to 
include that two adverse drug reactions ('headache' and

based on final results from study EP00-501 (PATRO 
children), which were assessed in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006; this is a 
an international, non-interventional, non-controlled, 
longitudinal, open and multicenter study, designed to 
record the safety and effectiveness data of paediatric 
patients treated with Omnitrope in various 
indications within routine clinical practice; the 
Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. Section 5.1 
of the SmPC was updated to include the study results 
of study EP00-501. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to align the summary of the safety 
profile and the tabulated list of ADRs, to introduce 
statements in the PI as per the Excipients guideline 
and to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD 
template version 10.2. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to

relationship between somatropin and acute pancreatitis is 
at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC Rapporteur 
concludes that Section 4.4 of the SmPC of products 
containing somatropin should be amended to add a warning 
on pancreatitis. 
Additionally, the PRAC Rapporteur considers a causal 
relationship between somatropin and gynecomastia is 
established and concludes that section 4.8 of the SmPC of 
products containing somatropin should be amended, to add 
the adverse reaction gynecomastia with a frequency 
uncommon.  
The Package leaflet is updated accordingly.

request set out in the conclusions of PSU 031.1 
assessment report, in order to include a new warning

II, Labelling 
proposed to align the PI to the current European PI of 
and PL 
Genotropin. The proposed amendments comprised of 
rephrasing the available information and adding 
information available in Genotropin’s PI. 
Furthermore, in section 4.4 and 4.8 a warning on 
pancreatitis was included and the ADR was listed in the 
ADR table respectively, according to the CHMP request set 
out in the AR conclusions of PSU 31.1. 
The CHMP considered that the proposed PI changes for

Please refer to the Assessment Report: Omnitrope-H-607-

A20-21-Assessment Report-Article 20 
On 10 December 2010, the European Commission 
initiated a procedure under Article 20 of Regulation 
(EC) No 726/2004 for somatropin-containing 
medicinal products authorised in the centralised 
procedure and requested the CHMP to assess all the 
available data and its impact on the risk benefit 
balance for somatropin-containing medicinal 
products and to give its opinion on measures 
necessary to ensure the safe and effective use of 
these medicinal products and whether the marketing 
authorisations for these products should be 
maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. 
The scope of the review was to assess the long-term 
safety of growth hormone treatments in light of the 
emerging safety data from the French SAGHE study 
in particular with regards the potential increased risk 
of mortality due to diseases of the circulatory 
system, bone tumours and subarachnoid or 
intracerebral haemorrhage in children and when high 
doses are used.

The new formulation has been modified compared to the 
marketed Omnitrope 5 mg/ml powder for solution for 
injection and the Genotropin 5 mg/ml formulations.  
The MAH has applied for all clinical indications for the new 
formulation, which have previously been approved for the 
Omnitrope 5.0 mg/ml formulation. 
In view of the demonstrated physicochemical comparability 
and the comparable pharmacokinetic profiles, no clinically 
relevant differences are to be expected between the 
various formulations tested. In line with the previous 
extension procedure for the 6.7 mg/ml formulation the 
balance of the benefits and risks of treatment with the 
newly proposed 10 mg/ml formulation is therefore the 
same as for the already registered 5 mg/ml powder 
formulation.

efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of teriflunomide administered orally once daily in 
paediatric patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) followed by an open-label extension.  
The RMP version 8.0 has also been submitted. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
With the current variation, the MAH provided the final study report of the open-label extension period 
of study EFC11759, a two-year, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel 
group trial to evaluate efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of teriflunomide administered 
orally once daily - at the dose of 7 mg or 14 mg adults equivalent - in paediatric patients with 
relapsing forms of MS followed by an open-label extension.  
The open-label (OL) period that followed the double-blind (DB) period lasted until 192 weeks after 
randomisation. Its duration for a given patient depended on when the patient entered this period. The 
duration of the OL period was 96 weeks for participants who completed the 96-week DB period on 
treatment and longer for patients who switched to the OL period early during the initial 96-week DB 
period due to a confirmed relapse or in case of high MRI activity.  
Although specific objectives for the open-label extension were not pre-defined, the open-label period of 
study EFC11759 focussed on long-term safety and tolerability. 
Interim analyses were performed while the study was ongoing. Results of the first interim analysis with 
the data cut-off date 27 November 2019 were presented in support of the line extension for Aubagio to 
include paediatric patients with RRMS. With regard to safety, these results were subsequently updated 
during the course of EMEA/H/C/002514/X/0031/G (second interim analysis with cut-off date 12 
September 2020). Overall, paediatric subjects were exposed to teriflunomide for up to 1418 days 
during the combined double-blind and open-label period as per the final database lock on 13 October 
2021. 
The final clinical study report of the open-label period with teriflunomide in paediatric patients does not 
change the conclusions on clinical efficacy and safety assessed during the line extension.  
With regard to efficacy the results of the updated and final long-term data of study EFC11759 suggest 
maintenance of effect of teriflunomide in paediatric patients with RMS. Efficacy findings are generally in 
line with the respective findings of the DB treatment period, as well as the preliminary long-term study 
data evaluated during the initial MAA for teriflunomide in the paediatric population.

No new or worsening of existing safety issues have been identified since the most recent open-label 
interim report of study EFC11759. As a consequence, no amendments to the product information have 
been proposed by the Applicant. This is agreed to. 
A revised RMP version 8.0 was submitted as a result of the completion of study EFC11759. Taking into 
account that no new safety issues or worsening of existing ones have been identified, it is agreed that 
only general remarks have been added reflecting that teriflunomide has been well tolerated with a 
manageable safety profile during the open-label extension phase. However, it is noted that the section 
on the potential risk of teratogenicity has been completely revised in relation to data from the Sanofi 
Pharmacovigilance database with the new DLP. This is generally endorsed. However, the wording 
requires revision as detailed in section 11 below. As these required revisions are considered minor, 
they can be provided with the next RMP update (please also refer to section 9.7).  
Following a request for supplementary information, a revised RMP version 8.1 was submitted. Since 
the open-label period of Study EFC11759/TERIKIDS has been completed and data on the long-term 
safety in children is now available, the missing information “long-term safety in paediatric patients” 
was removed from the summary of safety concerns in the RMP but will be further monitored within the 
PSURs. 
The pharmacovigilance plan was updated to remove study EFC11759/TERIKIDS from the list of 
ongoing pharmacovigilance activities, as it has been completed, which is considered acceptable.  
The benefit-risk balance of AUBAGIO remains positive.

5.  Introduction 
Aubagio (synonyms: teriflunomide, HMR 1726) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients and 
paediatric patients aged 10 years and older with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) and is 
distributed as film-coated tablets containing 7 mg or 14 mg of teriflunomide as active substance. In 
adults, the recommended dose of teriflunomide is 14 mg once daily. In paediatric patients (10 years of 
age and above), the recommended dose is dependent on body weight: 
- Paediatric patients with body weight >40 kg: 14 mg once daily.  
- Paediatric patients with body weight ≤40 kg: 7 mg once daily.  
Paediatric patients who reach a stable body weight above 40 kg should be switched to 14 mg once 
daily. 
Teriflunomide  is  an  immunomodulatory  agent  with  anti-inflammatory  properties  that  selectively  and 
reversibly inhibits the mitochondrial enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHO-DH), required for the 
de novo  pyrimidine  synthesis.  Consequently,  teriflunomide  blocks  the  activation  and  proliferation  of 
rapidly dividing cells including activated lymphocytes, which depend on de novo synthesis of pyrimidine 
to expand. Slowly dividing or resting cells which rely on the salvage pathway for pyrimidine synthesis 
are claimed to be unaffected by teriflunomide. The exact mechanism by which teriflunomide exerts its 
therapeutic effect in MS is not fully understood, but likely includes the reduction of activated lymphocytes 
available to migrate into the CNS. Teriflunomide is the active metabolite of leflunomide (Arava) indicated 
for rheumatoid arthritis and for psoriatic arthritis. In vivo, leflunomide is rapidly and almost completely 
metabolised to teriflunomide which is active in vitro and is presumed to be responsible for the therapeutic 
effect of Arava. 
Aubagio received approval of marketing authorisation for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing 
remitting multiple sclerosis on 26 August 2013 (centralised procedure; EMEA/H/C/002514). Studies 
that have been conducted with teriflunomide in support of the indication in adult patients with RRMS 
included one phase 2 study (study 2001), and three phase 3 studies (TEMSO: a 2 year, placebo-
controlled study; TOWER: a placebo-controlled, 48 to 152 weeks study; TENERE: active-controlled 
study, with a minimum duration of 48 weeks and a maximum duration of 118 weeks). 
On 17 June 2021, a European Commission (EC) decision was issued for the extension of the indication 
to include treatment of paediatric patients aged 10 years and older with relapsing remitting multiple 
sclerosis (MS), rendering Aubagio the first oral first-line therapy for children and adolescents aged 10 
to 17 years in the EU. Moreover, the EC granted an additional year of marketing protection in the EU. 
Reference is made to EMEA/H/C/002514/X/0031/G. 
In support of the line extension procedure starting in 2020, the Applicant provided results of a single 
Phase 3 study EFC11759 (TERIKIDS), a two-year, multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, parallel group trial to evaluate efficacy, safety, tolerability, and PK of teriflunomide 
administered orally once daily in paediatric patients with RMS followed by an OL extension. At the time 
of the MAA for Aubagio in paediatric patients, the open-label extension period of study EFC11759 was 
still ongoing. Results of the double-blind (DB) treatment period of up to 96 weeks (including a blinded 
PK run-in phase of 8 weeks) and interim results of the open-label (OL) treatment period of up to 
192 weeks (original data cut-off 27 November 2019 with an additional safety data cut-off 12 
September 2020) were submitted and assessed during EMEA/H/C/002514/X/0031/G. 
The primary objective of the DB period in study EFC11759 was to assess the effect of teriflunomide in 
comparison to placebo on disease activity as measured by time to first clinical relapse after 
randomisation in children and adolescents 10 to 17 years of age with relapsing forms of MS. Secondary 
EMA/CHMP/224365/2023

objectives were to assess the effect of teriflunomide in comparison to placebo on disease 
activity/progression measured by brain MRI and on cognitive function; to evaluate safety and 
tolerability of teriflunomide compared to placebo and to evaluate the PK of teriflunomide. Exploratory 
objectives of the study were to assess the effect of teriflunomide in comparison to placebo on disease 
activity/progression measured by brain MRI and on cognitive function and to explore long-term 
treatment effects in teriflunomide/teriflunomide and placebo/teriflunomide group. Specific objectives 
for the open-label extension were not defined. 
For the design details of study EFC11759, reference is made to the assessment reports/ EPAR of the 
Aubagio line extension (EMEA/H/C/002514/X/0031/G). 
There were five global and 2 local amendments implemented subsequent to the original protocol 
(dated 30 May 2013) while study EFC11759 was ongoing. Global amendments 1 to 4 are described in 
detail in the assessment reports/ EPAR of the Aubagio line extension (EMEA/H/C/002514/X/0031/G). 
An additional amendment (No.5) to the protocol dated 10 December 2020. This amendment was made 
due to the emerging COVID-19 pandemic in order to implement changes to the conduct of the study 
for patients in the open-label period and optional extension period, to ensure continuation of patient 
treatment, while reducing personal contact with patients.  
The Aubagio EU RMP version 7.3 has been updated by the MAH as a result of the completion of study 
EFC11759 to version 8.0. Please refer to section 9 for assessment of the proposed changes. 
The data in the EU Summary of Product Characteristics are not affected by the final study results and 
therefore, no changes are proposed to the labelling. 
6.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
6.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
As methods and results of the double-blind period of study EFC11759 as well as methods and 
preliminary long-term data (as of cut-off date of 27 November 2019) of the open-label extension have 
already been assessed during the initial MAA for Aubagio in the paediatric population, the general 
design of the study is only briefly described in the following. 
The OL extension period of Study EFC11759 was a long-term phase of the study to evaluate the long-
term effect with focus on long-term safety of teriflunomide. 
The first patient has been enrolled in the open-label period: 02 April 2015  
Study completion date: 06 October 2021 (last participant last visit) 
An interim analysis regarding efficacy has been provided with cut-off date: 27 November 2019. The now 
presented final results are based on database lock date of 13 October 2021. 
All subjects who were previously treated with placebo or teriflunomide received teriflunomide. All patients 
started with a 8 weeks PK run-in phase. Those who were in the teriflunomide arm remained on their 
adjusted 14 mg adult equivalent dose and those who were in the placebo arm underwent the PK run-in 
with “7 mg adult equivalent to adjust the dose”. The blinded PK run-in phase was intended to provide 
individual  PK  parameters  to  allow  individual  dose  adjustment  to  ensure  that  patients  would  reach 
exposure  similar  to  that  seen  in  adults  treated  with  14  mg  adult-equivalent  dose  (the  “14  mg  adult-
equivalent dose”) for the remainder of the study. 
EMA/CHMP/224365/2023  
Page 7/45 
 
  
 
 
For  subjects  discontinuing  study  treatment  or  who  were  not  interested  to  continue  treatment  with 
teriflunomide after study completion, teriflunomide was cleared from the body through an accelerated 
elimination procedure with either cholestyramine or activated charcoal. 
The  duration  of  the  OL  period  was  96  weeks  for  patients  who  completed  the  96  week  BD  period  on 
treatment, and longer for patients who switched to the OL period early during the initial 96 week DB 
period due to a confirmed relapse or in case of high MRI activity (for a total follow-up of 192 weeks). 
Patient enrolled in the OL period were patients included in the DB period of the study who had the option 
to continue in the OL period because patients experienced a relapse after the DB period PK run-in phase 
(8 weeks) confirmed by the RAP; or patients had high MRI activity meeting protocol criteria, during the 
DB period; or patients completed the 96-week DB period. 
Study population 
Participants of 10 to below 18 year of age, with relapsing form of multiple sclerosis meeting the criteria 
of MS based on McDonald criteria 2010 and IPMSSG criteria for paediatric MS, version of 2012 and had 
at least 1 relapse (or attack) in the 12 months preceding screening or at least 2 relapses (or attacks) in 
the 24 months preceding screening. Completed the double-blind period of the study and were below 18 
years of age at open-label entry. 
Dose regimen: 
• During PK run-in period: 7 mg adult equivalent once daily dose of teriflunomide (1 tablet of 3.5 mg for 
participants with body weight of ≤40 kg or 1 tablet of 7 mg for participant with body weight >40 kg) for 
those previously in placebo arm and 14 mg adult equivalent (see below) for those who were previously 
in the teriflunomide arm during double-blind period. 
• After PK run-in period: 14 mg adult equivalent once daily dose of teriflunomide based on the individual 
predicted PK parameters defined in the PK run-in period as follows: 
-  If  individual  predicted  PK  parameters  ≤95th  percentile  of  adult  range  of  predicted  PK  parameters 
(repeated doses of 7 mg): 1 tablet of 7 mg for participants with a body weight of ≤40 kg or 1 tablet of 
14 mg for participants with a body weight >40 kg. 
- If individual predicted PK parameters > 95th percentile of the adult range of predicted PK parameters 
(repeated doses of 7 mg): 1 tablet of 3.5 mg for participants with a body weight of ≤40 kg or 1 tablet 
of 7 mg for participants with a body weight >40 kg. 
Statistical methods: 
Efficacy analyses for primary and secondary endpoints of the open-label period were of exploratory intent 
in  principle  to  better  understand  treatment  effects  of  teriflunomide  monotherapy  beyond  the  double-
blind period in the paediatric population. 
The  first  clinical  confirmed  relapse  occurred  from  randomization  in  the  double-blind  period  (including 
relapses  during  the  PK  run-in  [8  weeks]  phase)  to the  end  of  the  open-label  period  was  included  for 
analysis. Treatment effect as measured by the hazard ratio and its associated 95% confidence interval 
(CI)  was  estimated  using  a  Cox’s  proportional-hazards  model  with  robust  variance  estimation.  Cox’s 
model included factors for treatment group, region, baseline pubertal status, age at study entry, and 
number of relapses in the year prior to randomization. The duration of time to the event was included in 
EMA/CHMP/224365/2023  
Page 8/45 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
the modelling to offset the lengths of individual observations. Kaplan-Meier estimates of probability of 
clinical relapse at Week 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168 and 192 were estimated. The complementary log-
log transformation was used to construct 95% CIs. Kaplan-Meier survival curves from randomization in 
double-blind period to the end of open-label period were presented. A stratified log-rank test with time 
to first clinical relapse as the dependent variable, treatment group as a test variable, region, and baseline 
pubertal  status  as  covariates  was  provided  as  supportive.  The  proportion  of  participants  with  clinical 
relapse-free  at  Weeks  24,  48,  72,  96,  120,  144,  168  and  192  was  estimated based  on  Kaplan-Meier 
methods. 
The  number  of  new  or  enlarged  T2  lesions  per  MRI  scan  was  analysed  using  a  negative  binomial 
regression model with robust variance estimation. The number of T1 Gd-enhancing lesions per MRI scan 
and  the  number  of  new  T1  hypointense  lesions  per  MRI  scan  were  analysed  using  a  similar  negative 
binomial regression model as described above for T2 lesions. The proportion of participants free of new 
or enlarged T2 lesions at Weeks 48, 96, 144 and 192 was summarised based on all participants having 
an MRI at these time points. Kaplan-Meier method was used for estimation. 
The  change  from  baseline  in  Cognitive  Battery  tests  and  symbol  digit  modalities  test  (SDMT)  was 
summarised descriptively. Box plot was provided as well. 
The proportion of disease-free participant was summarised at Weeks 48, 96, 144 and 192 based on all 
participants having an MRI at these time points. Kaplan-Meier methods was used for estimation. 
Adjusted  annualized  relapse  rate  (ARR)  was  performed  using  a  Poisson  regression  model  with  robust 
error variance that would accommodate the potential over-dispersed data appropriately. The estimated 
relapse rates and 2-sided 95% CIs were provided for each treatment group. 
6.2.  Results 
Study population 
152 patients were enrolled in the OL period: 100 patients in the teriflunomide/teriflunomide group and 
52 patients in the placebo/teriflunomide group.

Table 1 Participants disposition 
Most of the 166 participants randomized in the double-blind period of the study entered the open-label 
period (100 [91.7%] participants in the teriflunomide group and 52 [91.2%] participants in the placebo 
group) to receive teriflunomide treatment. 
Of the enrolled 152 participants, 104 (68.4%) participants completed the open-label period: 31 (59.6%) 
participants 
in 
the  placebo/teriflunomide  group  and  73 
(73.0%)  participants 
in 
the 
teriflunomide/teriflunomide group. 
Overall,  48  (31.6%)  participants  (21  [40.4%]  participants  in  the  placebo/teriflunomide  group  and  27 
[27.0%]  participants  in  the  teriflunomide/teriflunomide  group)  discontinued  from  the  open-label 
treatment  period  of  the  study;  19.2%  in  the  placebo/teriflunomide  group  and  14.0%  in  the 
teriflunomide/teriflunomide group due to lack of efficacy and 13.5% in the placebo/teriflunomide group 
and 5.0% in the teriflunomide/teriflunomide group due to adverse events.

Figure 1 Primary analysis: Kaplan-Meier (KM) plot of time to first confirmed clinical relapse during 
combined double-blind and open-label treatment period - Efficacy population 
The participants who received teriflunomide since the start of the DB period had a numerically lower risk 
of confirmed clinical relapse over the combined DB and OL periods than the participants who received 
teriflunomide only from the start of the open-label period (relative risk reduction of 38.3%; hazard ratio 
(HR): 0.62; 95% CI (confidence interval): 0.39 to 0.98; p = 0.1058).  
The estimated adjusted annualised relapse rates (ARR) in the open-label period were 13.4% and 15.0% 
in participants in the teriflunomide/teriflunomide group and placebo/teriflunomide group, respectively, 
which  were  close  to  the  unadjusted  relapse  rates  of  18.4%  and  20.6%  in  participants  in  the 
teriflunomide/teriflunomide group and placebo/teriflunomide group, respectively, since enrolment of the 
open-label period as of the data cut-off. 
The participants who received teriflunomide since the start of double-blind study had also a lower risk of 
disability  progression  sustained  over  the  combined  double-blind  and  open-label  periods  than  the 
participants who received teriflunomide only from the start of the open-label (HR: 0.465; 95% CI: 0.226 
to 0.959). 
Regarding the MRI secondary endpoints, teriflunomide reduced the number of new or enlarged T2-lesion 
per scan and the number of Gd-enhancing T1 lesions per scan, when comparing participants previously 
treated  with  teriflunomide  since  the  start  of  the  double-blind  period  to  participants  treated  with 
teriflunomide  only  from  the  start  of  the  open-label  period.  Furthermore,  teriflunomide  reduced  the 
number of new hypointense T1 lesions per scan, when comparing participants previously treated with 
teriflunomide since the start of the double-blind period to participants treated with teriflunomide only 
from the start of the open-label period.

There  was  a  higher  proportion  of  clinical  relapse-free  participants  in  the  teriflunomide/teriflunomide 
group versus the placebo/teriflunomide group. 
No  meaningful  difference  between  groups  was  observed  for  the  cognitive  tests.  The  number  of 
participants evaluated at the end of the study was low and limited the interpretation of the results. 
6.3.  Discussion 
Study EFC11759 (TERIKIDS) was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-
group study (duration 96 weeks), followed by an open-label (OL) period that could last up to 
192 weeks from randomisation to EOT. Efficacy data received from this long-term extension period 
support the efficacy results observed in the prior double-blind period of study EFC11759 and indicate 
maintenance of efficacy. However, due to the uncontrolled design of the OL period as well as due to 
the attrition bias, the extension period of study EFC11759 is generally of limited value with regard to 
efficacy. 
7.  Clinical Safety aspects 
7.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
For a detailed method description of study EFC11759, it should be referred to the assessment reports 
of the original application procedure (EMEA/H/C/002514/X/0031/G). 
The safety analysis was conducted on the safety population defined as: 
• all randomised patients exposed to study medication, during the DB period; 
• all patients enrolled in the OL treatment period and who received any dose of teriflunomide.  
Safety analyses were conducted according to the study treatment that the participants actually 
received in the DB period (placebo versus teriflunomide) and in the OL period (placebo/teriflunomide 
versus teriflunomide/teriflunomide, and, if applicable, overall). 
Moreover, long-term safety analysis of Study EFC11759 focused on data of all teriflunomide-treated 
participants from randomisation in the DB period to the end of OL period. The safety results during this 
combined DB and OL period are summarised. 
The safety information presented is based on TEAEs, SAEs, clinical laboratory data, vital sign 
measurements, ECGs, body weight, height and Tanner stage assessment with the following 
assessment schedule: 
EMA/CHMP/224365/2023

Table 3 Safety assessments study schedule 
The following terms have been defined as adverse events of special interest (AESIs): gastrointestinal 
disorders (nausea and diarrhoea), hepatic disorders, pancreatic disorders, bone marrow disorders, 
infections and infestations, hypersensitivity/severe skin disorders, malignancy, hypertension, cardiac 
arrhythmias, pulmonary disorders (interstitial lung disease), embolic and thrombotic events, 
haemorrhage, peripheral neuropathy, convulsions, alopecia and psychiatric disorders, and pregnancy. 
Tanner stages (scale of physical development in children, adolescents and adults) were assessed at 
baseline for each location (pubic hair and breasts in girls, pubic hair and testes in boys) by gender and 
treatment group, and every 24 weeks, and EOT or until complete sexual maturity (Tanner stage V). 
7.2.  Results 
For the results of the DB period of study EFC11759, reference is made to the clinical 
assessment report and overview documents and the EPAR for 
EMEA/H/C/002514/X/0031/G. 
The presentation of results in the following paragraphs pertains to the final data from the OL period 
with the data cut-off 13 October 2021. 
Patient exposure 
152 patients (52 patients in the placebo/ teriflunomide group and 100 patients in the teriflunomide/ 
teriflunomide group) were treated in the OL period of study EFC11759. Cumulative duration of 
treatment exposure from enrolment in the DB period to the final cut-off date in the OL period was 
36.18 patient-years for the patients receiving 7 mg teriflunomide group and 265.82 patient-years for 
the patients receiving 14 mg teriflunomide (most of the patients received 14 mg). Median duration of 
study treatment was 683 days for the teriflunomide 7 mg group and 680 days for the 14 mg group. 
Most of the patients received IMP (62.5% in the 7 mg group and 62.9% in the 14 mg group) for more 
than 96 weeks.

Table 4 Extent of exposure to investigational medicinal product in OL period - Safety population - 
Study EFC11759 OL period (cut-off date 13 October 2021) 
During the OL period, the demographic, medical history and disease characteristics at baseline of the 
population enrolled were similar to the randomised population demographic characteristics (DB 
period). 
Adverse events 
Common adverse events 
During the OL period, the proportion of patients with any TEAEs, treatment emergent SAEs, and any 
TEAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation was lower in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide 
group compared with the placebo/ teriflunomide group (Table 5).

Long-term safety analysis 
TEAEs and treatment-emergent SAEs with teriflunomide were reported for 95% and 22.4% of patients 
from the randomisation in the DB period to the end of the OL period. TEAEs leading to permanent 
treatment discontinuation were reported in 11.2% of participants. No participant died during the study. 
Display of AEs 
The following TEAEs at the SOC level were reported more frequently in the placebo/ teriflunomide 
group than in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group (with a difference of ≥5%): Psychiatric disorders 
(17.3% vs. 11%), Nervous system disorders (34.6% vs. 27%), Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal 
disorders (23.1% vs. 11%), Gastrointestinal disorders (34.6% vs. 28%), Musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders (19.2% vs. 11%), Investigations (28.8% vs. 20%), and Renal and urinary 
disorders (11.5% vs. 3%). The following TEAEs at the SOC level were reported more frequently in the 
teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group than in the placebo/ teriflunomide group (with a difference of ≥5% 
by decreasing order in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group): Infections and infestations (57% and 
50%), and Blood and lymphatic system disorders (10% and 3.8%), respectively. 
The following TEAEs at the PT level were reported more frequently in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide 
group than in the placebo/ teriflunomide group (with a difference ≥5% by decreasing order in the 
teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group): upper respiratory tract infection (22% of participants in the 
teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group and 13.5% of participants in the placebo/ teriflunomide group) and 
accidental overdose (10% and 3.8%), respectively. The following TEAEs at the PT level were more 
frequently reported in the placebo/ teriflunomide group than in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group 
(with a difference of ≥5% by decreasing order in the placebo/ teriflunomide group): alopecia (17.3% 
and 10%), ALT increased (15.5% and 3%), dizziness (11.5% and 3%), micturition urgency (9.6% and 
none), depression (7.7% and 2%), acute sinusitis (5.8% and none), bronchitis (5.8% and none), and 
asthma (5.8% and none) (Table 6). 
In both groups, the majority of the TEAEs were of mild or moderate intensity. Severe TEAEs were 
reported in 10% of patients in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group and 13.5% of patients in the 
placebo/ teriflunomide group.  
Treatment-related TEAEs were reported by 42% of participants in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide and 
40.4% of participants in the placebo/ teriflunomide group. The most frequently reported TEAEs with an 
incidence of ≥5% in either treatment group were: alopecia (9% of participants on teriflunomide/ 
teriflunomide and 17.3% of participants on placebo/ teriflunomide) and ALT increased (none and 
7.7%).

Long-term safety analysis 
The most frequently reported TEAEs at the SOC level (≥20% of teriflunomide-exposed participants 
from the randomisation in the DB period to the end of the OL period) were: Infections and infestations 
(67.7%), Nervous system disorders (41%), GI disorders (43.5%), Skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders (37.9%), Investigations (32.3%), Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (23.6%), 
Injury, poisoning and procedural complications (23.6%), and General disorders and administration site 
conditions (22.4%). 
The most frequently reported TEAEs at the PT level (≥10% of teriflunomide exposed participants) were: 
nasopharyngitis (26.7%), alopecia (23%), upper respiratory tract infection (23%), headache (19.9%), 
abdominal pain (11.2%), influenza (11.8%), diarrhoea (12.4%), and dizziness (9.9%). The majority of 
the TEAEs were of mild or moderate intensity. 15.5% of teriflunomide-exposed participants reported 
TEAEs that were considered severe. All reported severe TEAEs occurred in less than 1% of participants 
except blood creatine phosphokinase increased (2.5%), headache (1.2%), and pancreatitis acute 
(1.2%). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No deaths occurred during the study. 
Serious adverse events 
Overall, the proportion of participants with treatment-emergent SAEs was lower in the teriflunomide/ 
teriflunomide group (14% participants) than in the placebo/ teriflunomide group (28.8% participants). 
The most frequently reported SAEs (≥2% by SOC level) in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group were 
Nervous system disorders (6%), Psychiatric disorders (3%), GI disorders (3%), Infections and 
infestations (2%), Investigations (2%), and Injury, poisoning and procedural complications (2%). For 
the placebo/ teriflunomide group, the most frequently reported SAEs by SOC included Investigations 
(5.8%), Infections and infestations (3.8%), Psychiatric disorders (3.8%), Nervous system disorders 
(3.8%), Respiratory thoracic and mediastinal disorders (3.8%), and General disorders and 
administration site conditions (3.8 %). 
The most frequently reported SAEs by preferred terms in ≥2.0% of patients in either treatment group 
were blood creatine phosphokinase increased, suicide attempt, Uhthoff’s phenomenon, pancreatitis 
acute, asthma, and ALT increased (Table 7).

participants had SAEs that were considered related, by the Investigator. The frequency was low for 
each type of events. The most commonly reported SAEs (≥2% by SOC level) were from the Nervous 
system disorders (5.6%), GI disorders (3.7%), Investigation (3.7%), Infections and infestations 
(3.1%), Psychiatric disorders (3.1%), and Injury, poisoning and procedural complications (2.5%) 
SOCs. The related SAEs occurred in less than 1% of participants except ALT increased (1.3%), blood 
creatinine phosphokinase increased (1.2%), and pancreatitis acute (1.2%). 
Adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation 
4% of patients in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group and 13.5% of patients in the placebo/ 
teriflunomide group reported TEAE leading to treatment discontinuation (Table 8). In the 
teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group, two patients reported serious “pancreatitis acute” and one patient 
reported “amylase increased and lipase increased” (in a context of serious pancreatitis diagnosis). In 
the placebo/ teriflunomide group, one patient each discontinued due to neuropathy peripheral and 
pregnancy, and five patients discontinued due to ALT increased.

by SOC internationally agreed order and by decreasing frequency of PT in overall group. 
Long-term safety analysis: TEAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation were reported in 
11.2% of teriflunomide-exposed participants, from randomisation in the DB period to the end of the OL 
period. The most commonly reported TEAEs (≥2 participants) leading to permanent treatment 
discontinuation by PT were: ALT increased (3.7%) and pancreatitis acute (2.5%). TEAEs of other PTs 
that led to treatment discontinuation were reported in one participant each. 
Adverse events of special interest 
Gastrointestinal disorders – nausea and diarrhoea 
GI disorders reported as AESI (i.e. nausea and diarrhoea) were reported less frequently in the 
teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group than in the placebo/ teriflunomide group (9% vs. 15.4%). Of the 17 
patients who experienced nausea or diarrhoea, 16 patients were recovered or recovering up to the last 
available report. All cases were non-serious and of mild or moderate intensity. No patient discontinued 
EMA/CHMP/224365/2023  
Page 23/45 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
due to nausea or diarrhoea events. In the placebo/ teriflunomide group, a majority of TEAEs of 
diarrhoea and nausea occurred between 24 and 36 weeks, and between 4 and 12 weeks, respectively. 
In the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group, the incidence for both AESIs was similar for all time 
intervals. One patient experienced diarrhoea and two patients experienced nausea during the 
accelerated elimination period, all in the placebo/ teriflunomide group. Vomiting was reported by 1% of 
patients in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group and 3.8% in the placebo/ teriflunomide group (of 
which 1 patient also experienced nausea). 
Long-term safety analysis: The incidence of teriflunomide-exposed participants with nausea or 
diarrhoea TEAEs from randomisation in the DB period until the end of the OL period was 19.3%. 
Hepatic disorders (including liver function parameter) 
Liver function 
The mean ALT levels increased in both teriflunomide/ teriflunomide and placebo/ teriflunomide groups 
at the time of entry in the OL period. This increase was transient in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide 
group. Then the ALT stabilized in both groups. No clinically relevant difference between groups were 
observed for the other parameters (ALP, AST, LDH, and GGT).  
The proportion of patients with ALT >1x ULN in post-baseline visits was similar in both treatment 
groups. Other PCSA are depicted in (Table 9).  
Table 9 Liver function - Number of patients with ALT >1 ULN in post-baseline visits – OL period - 
Safety population 
No patient had PCSA of ALT > 20 x ULN level. No patient experienced PCSAs that met the criteria of 
Hy’s Law (the plot of distribution of peak values of ALT versus peak values of total bilirubin for the OL 
period was similar to the DB period; see Figure 2).

Hepatic disorders 
were less frequently reported in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group than in the placebo/ 
teriflunomide group (6.0% vs. 17.3%). All events were asymptomatic laboratory abnormalities. The 
most frequently reported treatment-emergent hepatic disorder (≥5% at PT level) was ALT increased 
(15.4% in the placebo/ teriflunomide group and 3% in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group) (Table 
10).  
Three patients in the placebo/ teriflunomide group had SAEs leading to treatment discontinuation 
(already been described and assessed during EMEA/H/C/002514/X/0031/G). For one patient, the final 
diagnosis was drug induced liver injury due to IMP with a long half-life.  
Nine patients with treatment-emergent hepatic disorders experienced nonserious hepatic laboratory 
abnormalities (8 ALT increased and 1 transaminase increased): 5 patients in the placebo/ teriflunomide 
group and 4 patients in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group. Two patients discontinued from 
treatment because of hepatic laboratory abnormality TEAEs. All events were recovered up to the cut-
off date of this report except for one event in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group (no information 
available). 
The highest percentage of hepatic disorder TEAEs had an initial onset within the first week.

Long-term safety analysis:  The incidence of teriflunomide-exposed participants with hepatic disorder 
TEAEs from randomisation in the DB period until the end of OL period was 11.8%. The most frequently 
reported treatment-emergent hepatic disorder (≥5% at PT level) was ALT increased (8.7%). 
Pancreatic disorders and laboratory (pancreatic enzyme) parameters 
Pancreatic enzymes 
No clinically relevant differences between groups were observed for changes over time for mean lipase 
and amylase values. 
Pancreatic disorders 
Pancreatic disorders TEAEs were reported in 4 participants (4%) in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide 
group and 1 participant (1.9%) in the placebo/ teriflunomide group; overall it concerned 5 patients 
(3.3% in total) (Table 11). 
In the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group, two patients experienced SAEs of pancreatitis and 
pancreatitis acute, leading to treatment discontinuation (and AEP). These cases have already been 
described and assessed during EMEA/H/C/002514/X/0031/G (two patients). Of note, one patient has 
been described in the interim report as experiencing acute pancreatitis with pancreatic nodules 
(pseudo-papilloma; coded as pancreatic neoplasm). The coding changed from pancreatic neoplasm to 
pancreatic disorder (now not recognized by CMQ grouping). 
Another participant in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group experienced pancreatic disorders TEAEs 
(pancreatitis acute) during the accelerated elimination period after discontinuation from treatment due 
to nonserious amylase and lipase increased.  
In the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group, two Participants experienced nonserious increase in both 
amylase and lipase ≥2 × ULN and in the placebo/ teriflunomide group, one participant experienced 
nonserious lipase increase ≥ 2 × ULN. 
All cases were recovered up to the cut-off date of this report. 
No additional case of pancreatic disorders has been reported from the first interims report (safety data 
cut-off 12 September 2020) until the final data cut-off date 13 October 2021.

Long-term safety analysis: Overall, 8 (5%) of teriflunomide-exposed participants experienced 
pancreatic disorders from randomisation in the DB period until the end of OL period. Five participants 
(3.1%) experienced pancreatitis acute, two participants of whom were of severe intensity and two 
participants experienced pancreatitis of moderate intensity. 
Bone marrow disorders 
Bone marrow disorders were more frequently reported in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group than 
in the placebo/ teriflunomide groups (9% and 3.8%) during the OL period. The most commonly 
reported TEAEs derived from the investigations SOC and were white blood cell count decreased and 
monocyte count decreased (5% and 3% in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group). All cases were of 
mild or moderate intensity. One case of neutropenia was considered serious (Patient with a known pre-
existing cyclic neutropenia) and no case led to treatment discontinuation. 
Among the 11 patients who experienced bone marrow disorder TEAEs, one patient was not recovered 
from the event as of the cut-off date of this report. 
The majority of TEAEs related to bone marrow disorders had an initial onset between 4 weeks and 12 
weeks and 24 to 36 weeks of treatment. 
For further details of abnormalities in haematology parameters see laboratory parameter section. 
Long-term safety analysis: Overall, 15 (9.3%) of teriflunomide-exposed participants experienced bone 
marrow disorders TEAEs from randomisation in the DB period until the end of OL period, all mild or 
moderate in severity. The most commonly reported treatment-emergent bone marrow disorders (≥2% 
at PT level) were white blood cell count decreased (6.2%), neutrophil count decrease (3.1%) and 
monocyte count decrease (2.5%). 
Infections and infestations 
The incidence of patients with infections and infestations TEAEs was similar between the teriflunomide/ 
teriflunomide (57%) and the placebo/ teriflunomide group (51.9%). Most of the infections and 
infestations TEAEs were balanced between the two groups. The most frequently reported (≥5% in any 
treatment groups) TEAEs were: upper respiratory tract infections (teriflunomide/ teriflunomide and the 
placebo/ teriflunomide: 22% and 13.5%), nasopharyngitis (20% and 15.4%), rhinitis (6% and 3.8%), 
influenza (5% and 9.6%), gastroenteritis (5% and 3.8%), urinary tract infection (5% and 3.8%), 
respiratory tract infection (5% and 1.9%), tonsillitis (4% and 5.8%), acute sinusitis (none and 5.8%), 
EMA/CHMP/224365/2023  
Page 27/45 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
and bronchitis (0.0% and 5.8%). Overall, 4 patients experienced infections and infestations SAEs 
(already reported and assessed during EMEA/H/C/002514/X/0031/G), i.e. central nervous system 
infection (a similar infection of “viral encephalitis” was reported in the past medical history for this 
participant), upper respiratory tract infection and lung infection, bronchitis and tonsillitis, acute 
sinusitis and food poisoning. None of the TEAEs led to treatment discontinuation. 
Long-term safety analysis: Overall, 110 (68.3%) of teriflunomide-exposed participants experienced 
bone marrow disorders TEAEs from randomisation in the DB period until the end of OL period, most of 
them of mild or moderate severity. The most commonly reported TEAEs (≥ 5% at PT level) were 
nasopharyngitis (26.7%), upper respiratory tract infection (23%), influenza (11.8%), tonsillitis 
(6.8%), pharyngitis (6.2%), rhinitis (6.2%), gastroenteritis (5.6%), urinary tract infection (5.6%), 
bronchitis (5%) and sinusitis (5%). Four events were of severe intensity (PT: upper respiratory tract 
infection, pilonidal cyst, pneumonia, and pulmonary tuberculosis). 
Covid-19 related adverse events 
Two participants (2%) experienced mild to moderate coronavirus infection in the teriflunomide/ 
teriflunomide group that did not lead to treatment discontinuation. One was a SAE, which was not 
considered related to the treatment by the Investigator. Both participants recovered from the events. 
Hypersensitivity and severe skin reactions, malignancies and cardiac arrhythmias: were not reported in 
EFC11759. 
Hypertension 
Hypertension was only reported in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group (3%) (reference is made to 
EMEA/H/C/002514/X/0031/G). 
Long-term safety analysis: The incidence of hypertension TEAEs in teriflunomide-exposed participants 
from randomisation in the DB period to the end of the OL period was 1.9%. All events were mild or 
moderate in intensity. 
Pulmonary disorders 
The proportion of patients who experienced pulmonary disorder TEAEs was similar between the 
teriflunomide/ teriflunomide and the placebo/ teriflunomide group (53% and 46.2%). 
The most frequently (≥5% in any treatment groups) reported TEAEs by PT were upper respiratory 
tract infections (22.0% in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group and 13.5% in the placebo/ 
teriflunomide group), nasopharyngitis (20% and 15.4%), oropharyngeal pain (7% and 3.8%), rhinitis 
(6% and 3.8%), influenza (5% and 9.6%), respiratory tract infection (5% and 1.9%), tonsillitis (4.0% 
and 5.8%), acute sinusitis (none and 5.8%), asthma (none and 5.8%), bronchitis (0% and 5.8%). 
Overall, 5 patients (one in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group and 4 in the placebo/ teriflunomide 
group) experienced SAEs already described and assessed during EMEA/H/C/002514/X/0031/G: lung 
infection and upper respiratory tract infection, acute sinusitis, bronchitis and tonsillitis, and two 
participants had asthma. No case of interstitial lung disorders was reported. 
Long-term safety analysis: The incidence of pulmonary disorder TEAEs for teriflunomide-exposed 
participants from randomisation in the DB period to the end of the OL period was 63.4%. The most 
frequently (≥5%) reported TEAEs were: nasopharyngitis (26.7%), upper respiratory tract infection 
EMA/CHMP/224365/2023  
Page 28/45 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
(23%), influenza (11.8%), oropharyngeal pain (9.3%), tonsillitis (6.8%), pharyngitis (6.2%), rhinitis 
(6.2%), bronchitis (5%), cough (5%), and sinusitis (5%). Most of the events were of mild to moderate 
in severity, except for 3 cases of pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infection, and pulmonary 
tuberculosis of severe intensity. 
Embolic and thrombotic events: were not reported during the OL period. 
Haemorrhage 
During the OL period, two (2%) patients in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group and one (1.9%) 
patient in the placebo/ teriflunomide group reported treatment-emergent, nonserious haemorrhage 
events (epistaxis and contusion). The events were of mild or moderate intensity.  
Peripheral neuropathy 
Three (3%) participants in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group and 2 (3.8%) participants in the 
placebo/ teriflunomide group experienced treatment-emergent peripheral neuropathy during the OL 
period. All events were non-serious including neuralgia of mild intensity and sensory loss of mild 
intensity in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group; neuralgia of mild intensity and neuropathy 
peripheral of moderate intensity in the placebo/ teriflunomide group. One patient discontinued 
treatment because of peripheral neuropathy. In this patient, electromyogram findings were consistent 
with polyneuropathic involvement characterized by mild loss of axons, predominantly in the lower 
extremities and sensory fibers. The event was rated related by the investigator. All cases have already 
been assessed during EMEA/H/C/002514/X/0031/G. 
Long-term safety analysis: The incidence of peripheral neuropathy TEAEs for teriflunomide-exposed 
participants from randomisation in the DB period to the end of the OL period was 3.1%. A total of 4 
teriflunomide-exposed participants experienced peripheral neuropathy disorders of mild or moderate 
intensity and 1 participant of severe intensity (PT: neuralgia). All events were nonserious. One event of 
peripheral neuropathy led to treatment discontinuation. 
Convulsions 
One event of epilepsy was reported in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group (not reported previously). 
The event was serious and moderate in intensity and led to hospitalisation. No medical history of 
epilepsy was reported. The event did not lead to treatment discontinuation and the patient recovered. 
It was not rated related to treatment by the investigator.  
Long-term safety analysis: The incidence of convulsion TEAEs for teriflunomide-exposed participants 
from randomisation in the DB period to the end of the OL period was 1.9%, including two events of 
epilepsy of moderate and severe intensity and seizure of mild intensity.  
Alopecia/ hair loss 
During the OL period, alopecia/hair loss was less frequently reported in the teriflunomide/ 
teriflunomide group (10%) than in the placebo/ teriflunomide group (17.3%). All events were 
nonserious and did not lead to treatment discontinuation. All events were of mild or moderate intensity 
except one severe. Among the 19 participants, 13 participants recovered, 5 participants had not 
recovered and 1 participant was recovering at the end of the study. 
EMA/CHMP/224365/2023

Long-term safety analysis: The overall incidence of teriflunomide-exposed participants with alopecia 
TEAEs from the randomisation in the DB period to the end of the OL period was 23.6%. All events were 
mild or moderate in intensity except for one event that was of severe intensity. All the events were 
nonserious and did not lead to treatment discontinuation. During the DB period, one participant 
experienced a nonserious adverse event of alopecia areata of severe intensity. Corrective treatment 
was given. Participant wanted to continue IMP despite the event and finally decided to stop it during 
the OL period. The IMP was permanently discontinued due to non-recovery of the TEAE. 
Psychiatric disorders 
Psychiatric disorders were more frequently reported for patients from the placebo/ teriflunomide group 
as compared to those from the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group (19.2% vs. 11%; Table 12). The 
most frequently reported TEAE was depression. Five participants experienced treatment-emergent 
SAEs of psychiatric disorders, including two SAEs of suicide. None of the events led to treatment 
discontinuation. Psychiatric disorders TEAEs were most frequently reported between from 12 to 
24 weeks.

Long-term safety analysis: The overall incidence of psychiatric disorder TEAEs in teriflunomide-exposed 
participants from randomisation in the DB period to the end of the OL period was 21.1%. The most 
frequently reported (≥2% at PT level) TEAEs were depression (5.0%) and anxiety (4.3%). All events 
were of mild or moderate intensity except 3 events which were of severe intensity. One severe event 
(affective disorder) led to treatment discontinuation. Five participants experienced treatment-emergent 
SAEs of psychiatric disorders.  
Pregnancies 
One participant in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group became pregnant during the OL period 
(already reported during EMEA/H/C/002514/X/0031/G). No structural defect or functional 
abnormalities were reported to date for the newborn, who was breastfed. 
In addition, one participant in the placebo/ teriflunomide group became pregnant during the OL period 
which was considered serious, and had a non-serious adverse event of vaginal bacterial infection of 
mild intensity. She underwent termination of pregnancy and recovered from the vaginal bacterial 
infection. The IMP was permanently discontinued due to the pregnancy. 
Other significant adverse events – adverse events of pre-specified monitoring  
Overdose 
A total of 12 patients, 10 (10%) patients in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group and 2 (3.8%) 
patients in the placebo/ teriflunomide group reported accidental overdose (intake of 2 tablets in less 
than 24 hours). None was associated with clinical symptoms. In one patient in the teriflunomide/ 
teriflunomide group, an SAE was reported related to suicide attempt in a patient who took a total of 18 
tablets of teriflunomide leading to hospitalisation (see EMEA/H/C/002514/X/0031/G).  
Long-term safety analysis: 9.3% of teriflunomide-exposed participants reported intake of 2 tablets in 
< 24 hours coded as accidental overdose, from the randomisation in the DB to the end of the OL 
period. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Laboratory values over time 
There was a decrease in mean platelet count in the placebo/ teriflunomide group from baseline when 
the patients entered the OL period and up to Week 8 thereafter, and no change for the teriflunomide/ 
teriflunomide group (plots can be derived from the CSR). 
No clinically relevant difference between groups were observed for changes over time of haematocrit, 
erythrocyte count, prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time during the on-treatment 
period. 
A slight decrease in leukocyte counts, neutrophils and lymphocytes from baseline was observed in the 
teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group compared with placebo/ teriflunomide during the first 20 weeks in 
the DB period stabilising thereafter. No apparent differences between groups were evident after 
entering the OL period. 
Individual participant changes and clinically abnormalities

Red blood cell, platelets and coagulation: 
Overall, the proportion of participants with abnormalities in haemoglobin, erythrocytes, and platelet 
count was low and similar between groups from the randomisation up to the end of the OL period. 
The proportion of PCSA values were higher in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group than in the 
placebo/ teriflunomide group for haematocrit (high abnormal values) and haemoglobin (haemoglobin 
decrease from baseline ≥20 g/L) during the on-treatment period. 
The proportion of participants with erythrocytes value adults ≥6 × 1012/L was higher in the 
teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group compared with the placebo/ teriflunomide group, while the overall 
incidence was low. 
White blood cells 
The proportion of participants with PCSAs of high leukocyte values was lower in the teriflunomide/ 
teriflunomide group than in the placebo/ teriflunomide group and was similar between groups of low 
leukocyte values during the on-treatment period. The proportion of participants with high neutrophils 
and eosinophils were lower in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group than in the placebo/ teriflunomide 
group. The proportion of participants with basophils value adults: >0.1 × 109/L was greater in the 
teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group compared with the placebo/teriflunomide group. The proportion of 
participants with abnormalities in lymphocytes and monocytes were similar between groups. 
Three participants (2.0%) had leukopenia; 2 participants (1.3%) had neutropenia; and 1 participant 
(0.7%) had leukocytosis. Of these TEAEs, 1 event of neutropenia was considered serious and related 
to the treatment by the Investigator which was reported in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group. 
Clinical chemistry 
The mean phosphorus levels were stable. 
No clinically relevant difference between groups were observed for electrolytes and metabolic function 
parameters. No participant reported any TEAEs related to abnormalities in electrolyte parameters 
including hypokalaemia, that were considered serious or leading to treatment discontinuation. Two 
(2.0%) participants in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide and 1 participant in the placebo/ teriflunomide 
group reported a SAE of blood creatine phosphokinase increased. 
Liver function (see AESI “hepatic disorders) 
Renal function 
During the OL period, mean uric acid in the placebo/ teriflunomide group dropped steadily through the 
first 12 weeks, and stabilised afterwards. No changes were observed in the teriflunomide/ 
teriflunomide group. No clinically relevant difference between groups were observed for the other 
parameters. One participant in the placebo/ teriflunomide group had serum creatinine >2 × baseline. 
No other clinically relevant abnormalities in renal function parameters were reported as TEAEs. 
Regarding individual patient changes, the proportion of patients with renal function PCSAs for 
creatinine, glomerular filtration rate and urea nitrogen was similar between groups. The incidence of 
patients with creatinine clearance values indicative of mild renal impairment (adults: ≥60 - <90 
mL/min) was lower in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group compared with placebo/ teriflunomide 
(14.6% and 25%). 
The proportion of patients with creatinine value adults: ≥30% change from baseline was higher in the 
teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group compared with the placebo/ teriflunomide (14.6% and 8.3%).

Thyroid stimulating hormone 
Mean TSH values were stable during the OL period. 
Vital signs and other observations related to safety 
Weight 
From Week 24 in the DB period, body weight increased in both groups. Mean change (SD) from 
baseline to last on-treatment value was 3.6 (7.6) kg in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group and 1.3 
(6.6) in the placebo/ teriflunomide group. 
The proportion of participants with the on-treatment PCSA of ≥5% increase or ≥5% decrease in weight 
from baseline was similar between the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group and the placebo/ 
teriflunomide group (19% versus 11.5% and 48% versus 53.8%, respectively). 
Vital signs 
The mean changes from baseline in SBP and DBP in standing and supine position were similar between 
treatment groups in the OL period and there were no clinically relevant changes observed from 
baseline across visits. The slight increase over time for SBP and DBP in supine position observed 
during the DB period became stable when entering the OL period. 
Long-term safety analysis: Mean changes from baseline in DBP and SBP in standing and supine 
position were similar between treatment groups and there were no clinically relevant changes observed 
from baseline across visits. The same was observed for heart rate. The proportion of participants with 
on-treatment PCSAs in increased supine DBP and SBP was similar between the teriflunomide/ 
teriflunomide and the placebo/ teriflunomide group (57% vs. 57.7% and 39% vs. 25%, respectively). 
The proportion of participants with on-treatment PCSAs in decreased supine DBP and SBP was similar 
between the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide and the placebo/ teriflunomide group (9% vs. 13.5% and 2% 
vs. 7.7%, respectively). There were no PCSA values reported for heart rate. 
Electrocardiogram 
No clinically relevant changes were observed for ECG parameters during the OL period. 
A few patients had PCSAs for ECG parameters. The proportion of patients with an increase in QTc 
interval was similar between groups during the OL period. 
Tanner stage 
A majority (more than 90%) of patients in both arms was Tanner stage >I (pubertal) at DB baseline. 
During the DB period, both treatment groups showed pubertal development (in patients not yet fully 
pubertal) of no more than 2 stages, which is in line with the expectation of a progress rate in sexual 
maturation of approx. one Tanner stage per year retrieved from scientific literature1. However, this is 
based on a rather small number of paediatric patients with less than Tanner Stage IV or V at baseline, 
who completed the 96-week DB period in study EFC11759. Moreover, variability in progression of 
Tanner Stages between treatment groups was observed during the combined DB and OL periods in 
either gender, which cannot be further clarified given the limited number of patients included in this 
additional analysis. In the OL period, patients in both treatment groups progressed to higher Tanner 
stages without relevant differences. No clinically relevant differences between groups were observed.

Safety in special populations 
The incidences of any TEAEs, SAEs, TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation, and AESIs for patients 
on placebo/ teriflunomide and teriflunomide/ teriflunomide were analysed based on: 
• 
Intrinsic factors: Age group, Gender group (Male or Female), Race, Pubertal status, Pubertal 
status at disease onset, Weight group, MS subtypes, Number of relapses experienced overall, 
High disease activity (defined as 2 or more relapses in the past year, and 1 or more 
Gadolinium (Gd) enhancing lesions on baseline MRI). 
Some differences overall in both treatment groups were observed, in particular for infections 
and hepatic disorders regarding age, race, and weight. For example, regarding age (<13 years 
vs. ≥13 years) TEAEs from the following SOCs were reported more frequently in the younger 
versus the older paediatric subjects: infections and infestations (mainly seasonal infections), 
nervous system disorders (mainly headache), respiratory, and thoracic and mediastinal 
disorders (oropharyngeal pain). Moreover, it appears from the data that more male patients 
experienced TEAEs in line with hepatic disorders as compared to female patients. All pancreatic 
disorders were recorded in female patients. Interpretation of these differences is clearly 
hampered by the small number of patients in specific subgroups (e.g., patients <13 years, 
subgroups by race). In summary, no specific increase was noted in the teriflunomide group or 
teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group as compared to the placebo group or placebo/ teriflunomide 
group. The teriflunomide safety profile was generally consistent across subgroups.  
• 
Extrinsic factors, i.e. region and previous MS treatment. The safety profile of teriflunomide was 
generally consistent across subgroups during the study. 
Immunogenicity results 
During the DB and the OL periods, a slight decrease in mean values of IgA, IgG, and IgM, was 
observed up to the end of the periods in the patients treated with teriflunomide. 
Postmarketing experience 
Reference is made to EMEA/H/C/002514/X/0031/G (postmarketing experience up to the cut-off date 
17 January 2020 in paediatric patients up to 17 years of age). 
An additional interval analysis in the Sanofi Global Pharmacovigilance Database has been performed to 
include data from 18 January 2020 to 22 July 2022. This search was performed to identify all cases 
from postmarketing sources (solicited and unsolicited cases) reported with teriflunomide as a suspect 
drug in patients up to 17 years of age. Cumulatively, a total of 43 unique case reports were retrieved 
in patients ranging from 10 to 17 years of age. 29 reports from solicited sources (non-interventional 
postmarketing studies) and 14 reports from unsolicited spontaneous sources. Among the 43 case 
reports, there were 10 cases reported as serious, and 33 reported as non-serious; the gender was 
female in 30 cases, male for 11 cases, and unknown in 2 cases. Among the 43 case reports, 41 were 
new cases and the remaining 2 were cases included in the initial submission, which received follow-up 
information during this interval. 
8 of the 41 new cases were not related to an AE, and the remaining 33 cases included reporting of 
Aes. The Aes were related to MS in 6 cases and not related to MS in 27 cases. The 6 cases with Aes 
related to the underlying disease of MS (reported as Aes) included evocative signs such paraesthesia, 
gait disturbance, or MS relapse. Among the 27 cases with Aes not related to MS, there were 22 non-
EMA/CHMP/224365/2023

serious cases and 5 serious cases. Based on individual case assessment, no likely or possible case was 
identified, among the 22 non-serious cases. All cases were unassessable due to limited information 
regarding medical history, concomitant medication or clinical course of adverse events. 
Among the 5 SAEs not related to MS, 1 possible case was identified (neutropenia). The remaining 
cases were unassessable due to a lack of clinical background information. 
Among the 41 new case reports, 15 cases reported off-label use. All of the off-label reported 
prescriptions were related to the effective treatment of MS in a young population with indication for 
oral treatment with teriflunomide, per neurologist prescription. Additionally, there were 3 new case 
reports for children below the age of 10 years. The reported age was 9 years in 2 cases and 8 years in 
1 case. All cases were reported as non-serious. Among these, 1 case (Id: 2015SA009873) reported 
Aes (Affect lability, Diarrhoea, Gastroenteritis viral, Vomiting). The case was unassessable due to a 
lack of clinical background information. 
7.3.  Discussion 
Study EFC11759 (TERIKIDS) was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-
group study (duration 96 weeks), followed by an open-label (OL) period that could last up to 
192 weeks from randomisation to EOT. The OL period focusses on the long-term safety and treatment 
effects in the placebo/ teriflunomide and in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group, for which results 
are based on the database lock 13 October 2021.  
In the OL period, 132 of 152 patients (87%) received the 14 mg dose. Cumulatively, open-label data 
for teriflunomide 14 mg of more than 96 weeks are available for 83 (62.9%) paediatric patients. The 
highest cumulative duration of OL treatment with teriflunomide 14 mg was ~3.5 years for 12 patients.  
TEAEs reported in the OL period of study EFC11759, their frequency, severity, and relation to 
treatment were found along expectations for teriflunomide in the double-blind period. No additional 
concerns or worsening of safety issues reported during the DB period have been identified in the OL 
period. 
84.2% of patients reported at least 1 TEAE during the OL period. Most of the TEAEs in both treatment 
groups  were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity,  with  <  14%  of  TEAEs  rated  as  severe.  No  deaths  were 
reported. More patients from the placebo/ teriflunomide group reported TEAEs, SAEs, and TEAEs leading 
to  permanent  treatment  discontinuation  as  compared  to  those  from  the  teriflunomide/  teriflunomide 
group. Thus, data imply that a majority of events occur early during treatment with teriflunomide. 
The most common TEAEs (≥10% of teriflunomide exposed participants) from randomisation in the DB 
period to the end of the OL period were nasopharyngitis (26.7%), alopecia (23%), upper respiratory 
tract infection (23%), headache (19.9%), abdominal pain (11.2%), influenza (11.8%), diarrhoea 
(12.4%), and dizziness (9.9%).  
SAEs during the OL period were basically in line with those from the DB period and were reported by a 
higher percentage of patients in the placebo/ teriflunomide group (28.8%) vs. 14% in the 
teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent SAEs (≥2% of 
patients in either group) were blood creatine phosphokinase increased, suicide attempt, Uhthoff’s 
phenomenon, pancreatitis acute, asthma, and ALT increased (1.9% and 2%, 0% and 2%, 0% and 2%, 
0% and 2%, 3.8% and 0%, and 3.8% and 0% in the placebo/ teriflunomide group and teriflunomide/ 
teriflunomide group, respectively). SAEs that were rated related to teriflunomide were pancreatitis 
acute, two SAEs of blood CPK increased, headache, two SAEs of ALT increased, acute sinusitis, 
neutropenia, upper respiratory tract infection, and intentional overdose. 
EMA/CHMP/224365/2023  
Page 35/45 
 
  
 
 
Discontinuations due to TEAEs in the OL period were similar to the DB period and driven by patients in 
the  placebo/  teriflunomide  group.  TEAEs  occurred  in  single  patients  only  except  for  ALT  increased  (5 
patients in the placebo/ teriflunomide group [9.6%]). 
Adverse events of special interest up to the final data cut-off date did not significantly change in 
incidence, severity, relationship to treatment, and discontinuations as compared to those reported in 
the open-label interim analysis during EMEA/H/C/002514/X/0031/G for GI disorders, hepatic disorders, 
bone marrow disorders, infections, hypertension, pulmonary disorders, peripheral neuropathy, 
alopecia. 
For psychiatric disorders, two SAEs of suicidal attempt occurred in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide 
group, one of which was already reported as “intentional overdose” in the interim report of the OL 
period. Both were not rated related to teriflunomide. 
Pancreatic effects are an important identified risk with teriflunomide treatment based on nonclinical data, 
clinical adult studies, and from post-marketing reports. Mean amylase and lipase values did not show 
noticeable differences between treatment groups during the DB and OL period. 
During EMEA/H/C/002514/X/0031/G, TEAEs related to pancreatic effects included isolated and 
asymptomatic pancreatic enzyme increases, that were found increased in paediatric patients treated 
with teriflunomide compared to placebo (3.7% vs. 1.8%). However, pancreatitis (acute) was reported 
in 5 teriflunomide-treated patients (2 during the DB and 3 during the OL treatment) confirmed by 
imaging data. No additional case of pancreatic disorders has been reported up to the final data cut-off 
date 13 October 2021. 
No AESI related to hypersensitivity and severe skin reactions, malignancies and cardiac arrhythmias 
were not reported during the DB and OL period in EFC11759. 
Teriflunomide  is  not  considered  to  evoke  convulsions,  for  which  a  signal  has  been  raised  during 
EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010135/201709  (finally  not  confirmed).  The  incidence  of  epilepsy  was  low  and 
similar  in  both  groups  during  the  DB  phase.  The  only  SAE  in  the  teriflunomide  group  was  rated  not 
related (patient had a medical history of epilepsy). An additional TEAE of “epilepsy” was reported in the 
teriflunomide/  teriflunomide  group  during  the  OL  period,  which  was  a  SAE  of  moderate  severity  and 
rated not related to teriflunomide, although, the narrative did not indicate an alternative explanation for 
the event. 
Teriflunomide  can  cause  serious  birth  defects  when  administered  during  pregnancy  and  is  thus 
contraindicated (SmPC section 4.3). However, a total of 3 patients treated with teriflunomide became 
pregnant during the study. Two of them underwent termination of a pregnancy procedure and the third 
gave  birth  to  a  normal  infant,  without  structural  defect  or  functional  abnormalities.  Undesired 
pregnancies are of special importance in female adolescents and have been taken into account by an 
update of the educational material on teriflunomide. Adolescent pregnancies will also be monitored via 
an enhanced pharmacovigilance process. 
Accidental overdose and/or overdose was defined in the protocol as at least twice the intended dose 
(i.e. 2 tablets) within 24 hours. No increase in events was observed up to the data cut-off date in the 
OL period and all of them were asymptomatic except for a single TEAE that was related to attempted 
suicide (sensory disorders and tingling sensations for < 2 hours was reported). 
No  new  concerns  derived from  laboratory  parameters  with  regard  to haematology,  clinical  chemistry, 
liver, pancreas and renal function.  
There were no relevant changes or new findings in vital signs with regard to weight changes, blood 
pressure, heart rate, QTc interval or any other quantitative or qualitative ECG parameter changes.  
EMA/CHMP/224365/2023  
Page 36/45 
 
  
 
 
As indicated during EMEA/H/C/002514/X/0031/G, special attention needs to be paid to TEAEs affecting 
sexual maturation, cognition, endocrine function and other aspects of development. Tanner staging 
was assessed for each location (pubic hair and breasts in girls, pubic hair and testes in boys) by 
gender and treatment group, every 24 weeks, and at EOT or until complete sexual maturity (Tanner 
Stage V). However, the small number of patients with Tanner Stages < IV and V at baseline having 
had a full course of 96-week DB treatment hampers interpretation of sexual maturation with 
teriflunomide treatment. Based on the final open-label data, patients in both treatment groups 
progressed to higher Tanner stages without relevant differences. 
Special populations have been studied, including intrinsic factors, i.e. age, gender, race, pubertal status, 
BW, and disease-related subgroups. Overall, there seems to be no specific subgroup for which the safety 
profile of teriflunomide is continuously worse than for the others taking into account the limitations that 
derive  from  very  small  numbers  of  patients  included  in  subgroups.  The  SOC  depicting  the  highest 
variability  in  frequency  of  events  in  different  subgroups  is  infections  and  infestations  (generally  the 
younger, pre-pubertal paediatrics and those with lower BW are more affected by PTs from this SOC). 
Postmarketing data for approximately 10 years of teriflunomide treatment have been presented and 
comprise off-label use data (prior to the approval of Aubagio in paediatrics) and 41 new cases reported 
after approval of the paediatric indication (EMEA/H/C/002514/X/0031/G). Of these, 5 SAEs were 
reported and only a single SAE was rated related (neutropenia). Interpretation of nonserious or serious 
AEs reported in the remaining cases is hampered by the lack of (medical) background information. 
8.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version 8.0 with this application. The (main) proposed RMP 
changes were the following: 
8.1.  Safety Specification 
Identified and potential risks 
In Part II Module SVII.3.1 the section on exposure to teriflunomide in the paediatric population was 
updated to include patients from the double-blind as well as the open-label treatment phases of Study 
EFC11759/TERIKIDS, which is acknowledged. 
A total of 152 participants (100 participants in the teriflunomide/teriflunomide group and 52 
participants in the placebo/teriflunomide group) were treated in the open-label period of the study. The 
cumulative duration of treatment exposure (the sum of all participants’ duration of treatment exposure 
per treatment group) from enrollment to the open-label period was 36.18 participant-years for the 
teriflunomide 7 mg dose and 265.82 participant-years for the 14 mg dose. 
In Part II Module SVII.3.1 in the tables describing the identified risks as well as the potential risks the 
data lock point for analysis of cases from the Sanofi PhV database was updated to 12 September 2022, 
which is considered acceptable. No new relevant data is described as a consequence of the new date of 
analysis. With regard to Study EFC11759/TERIKIDS, only general remarks concerning the open-label 
extension phase were added such as “overall, teriflunomide was well-tolerated with a manageable 
safety profile, consistent with the experience observed in the double-blind period” and “no additional 
unexpected events were identified in the open-label period (for the identified risk infections and acute 
pancreatitis and the potential risks teratogenicity and serious opportunistic infections, including PML). 
Taking into account that no new safety issues or worsening of existing ones has been identified since 
EMA/CHMP/224365/2023  
Page 37/45 
 
  
 
 
the most recent open-label interim report of study EFC11759, this is agreed to. However, it is noted 
that the section on the potential risk teratogenicity regarding data from the Sanofi Pharmacovigilance 
database was completely revised. In response to the RSI, the MAH explained that the information on 
the potential risk of teratogenicity was updated to reflect the information reported in the MAH 
Database with the updated DLP and the overall text was reviewed to improve the readability. 
Missing information  
Following completion of the open-label period of Study EFC11759/TERIKIDS, the following information 
was added to the section on missing information with regard to the safety concern long-term safety in 
paediatric patients: 
In children, the double-blind part and the open-label part of EFC11759/TERIKIDS with a 
maximum treatment duration of 8 years has been completed. No additional unexpected events 
were identified in the open-label period. Overall, teriflunomide was well-tolerated with a 
manageable safety profile, consistent with the experience observed in the double-blind period. 
This wording is generally agreed. Since the open-label period of Study EFC11759/TERIKIDS has been 
completed and data on the long-term safety in children is now available, the missing information 
“long-term safety in paediatric patients” was removed from the summary of safety concerns in the 
RMP. Please also refer to section 9.2 below. 
8.2.  Summary of the safety concerns 
In response to the RSI, the MAH submitted a revised RMP version 8.1 with the following summary of

The open-label period of Study EFC11759/TERIKIDS has been completed and data on the long-term 
safety in children is now available and no longer considered missing information. Study 
EFC11759/TERIKIDS was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group 
study (duration 96 weeks), followed by an open-label period that could last up to 192 weeks from 
randomisation to EOT. Cumulatively, open-label data for teriflunomide 14 mg of more than 96 weeks 
are available for 83 (62.9%) paediatric patients. The highest cumulative duration of open-label 
treatment with teriflunomide 14 mg was approximately 3.5 years for 12 patients. As discussed in 
Section 7 (Clinical safety aspects) above, TEAEs reported in the open-label period of study EFC11759, 
including frequency and severity, were found along expectations for teriflunomide in the double-blind 
EMA/CHMP/224365/2023

period. No additional concerns or worsening of safety issues were reported during the open-label 
phase. An increased risk of pancreatic disorders in children as compared to adults had been identified 
during interim reports of the study (reports used in support of the line extension for Aubagio to include 
paediatric patients with RRMS). However, this risk is considered sufficiently minimised by extensive 
wording in the product information and no further information on this risk could be retrieved from the 
open-label period of Study EFC11759/TERIKIDS. 
As requested in the RSI, the missing information “long-term safety in paediatric patients” was removed 
from the summary of safety concerns and all relevant Parts of the RMP. The MAH confirmed that “long-
term safety in paediatric patients” will be retained in the PSUR summary of safety concerns in order to 
ensure regular analysis of all available data regarding this topic, so that potential changes in the safety 
profile, which might become visible when post-marketing exposure will increase, can be identified in a 
timely manner.  
Considering the data in the safety specification, the safety concerns listed above are appropriate. 
8.3.  Pharmacovigilance plan 
Study EFC11759 TERIKIDS was removed from the list of additional pharmacovigilance activities 
following the completion of the open-label period of the study (Parts III.2 and III.3), which is 
acceptable. 
Overall conclusions on the PhV Plan  
The proposed post-authorisation PhV development plan is sufficient to identify and characterise the 
risks of the product. 
Routine PhV is sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of the risk minimisation measures. 
8.4.  Risk minimisation measures 
Reference to Study EFC11759 TERIKIDS has been removed from RMP Part V.3 Summary of risk 
minimization measures following completion of the open-label period of the study, which is acceptable. 
Overall conclusions on risk minimisation measures 
The proposed risk minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the 
proposed indication(s). 
8.5.  Elements for a public summary of the RMP 
The elements for a public summary of the RMP require revision following the conclusion of the 
procedure: 
-  Removal of “long-term safety in paeditaric patients” as missing information 
8.6.  Annexes 
In Annex 2 Study EFC11759 was removed from Table 1 describing planned and ongoing studies and 
added to Table 2 describing completed studies, which is endorsed. 
EMA/CHMP/224365/2023  
Page 39/45 
 
  
 
 
 
In Annex 3 Study EFC11759 was removed from Part C describing previously agreed protocols for 
ongoing studies, which is acceptable. 
8.7.  Overall conclusion on the RMP 
 The changes to the RMP are acceptable. 
The MAH should take the following points into consideration at the next RMP update: 
The following conclusion on study EFC11759 with regard to the risk of teratogenicity in section 
SVII.3.1 is not appropriate and is to be deleted:  
“Overall, teriflunomide was well tolerated with a manageable safety profile, consistent with the 
experience observed in the double blind period.” 
The statement on the relatedness between teriflunomide and congenital malformation should be 
revised as follows: 
“Therefore, a total of 1274 cases of drug exposure via parent were retrieved. Of which, 30 pregnancies 
(considering a total exposure of 621 859 patient years as of DLP 12 Sep 2022) involved possible 
congenital malformations, for which causal relatedness was not could neither be established nor 
denied:”

RMP aspects 
1.)  It is noted that the section on the potential risk teratogenicity in Part II Module SVII.3.1 
regarding data from the Sanofi Pharmacovigilance database was completely revised. The MAH 
is asked to explain why this revision was performed and to justify all changes in this section. 
2.)  The MAH should remove “long-term safety in paediatric patients” as missing information from 
the summary of safety concerns as well as all other Parts of the RMP.  
EMA/CHMP/224365/2023  
Page 40/45 
 
  
 
 
3.)  The MAH is asked to confirm that “long-term safety in paediatric patients” will be retained in 
the summary of safety concerns in PSURs in order to ensure regular analysis of all available 
data regarding this topic, so that potential changes in the safety profile, which might become 
visible when post-marketing exposure will increase, can be identified in a timely manner.  
4.)  In RMP Part III.2 information was added about an ongoing optional additional extension period 
of Study EFC11759 with teriflunomide offered to participants when they completed the study, 
to provide treatment until they are 18 years old and/or can switch to teriflunomide commercial 
product. However, it is not clear why this optional additional extension phase is needed, as 
teriflunomide is already approved in children 10 years and older in the EU. The MAH is asked to 
elaborate on this and to explain if submission of further data from this optional additional 
extension period of the study is planned, for example in PSURs. If this is not the case, it is not 
considered necessary to include the information about this optional extension in the RMP. 
5.)  In Annex 2 Study EFC11759 was added to Table 2 describing completed studies. This is 
generally endorsed, however, the new entry in Table 2 should not be restricted to the open-
label period but to the complete study. The wording should be changed as follows: 
EFC11759: Open label period of a A multicenter, randomized, double blind, parallel 
group trial to evaluate efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of 
teriflunomide in comparison to placebo followed by a long-term open label extension 
phase, in children and adolescents 10 to 17 years of age with MS with relapses. […] 
6.)  The MAH is reminded to provide the complete RMP, including annexes, in track-changes-mode 
in all further steps of this procedure and any future procedures.

Question 1 
It is noted that the section on the potential risk teratogenicity in Part II Module SVII.3.1 regarding data 
from the Sanofi Pharmacovigilance database was completely revised. The MAH is asked to explain why 
this revision was performed and to justify all changes in this section. 
MAH’s response 
The previous RMP v7.3 had a DLP of 12 Sep 2020, all the tables of risks have been reviewed in the 
EMA/CHMP/224365/2023  
Page 41/45 
 
  
 
 
RMP v 8.0 with an updated DLP of 12 Sep 2022. The Part II Module SVII.3.1 of RMP v8.0 regarding the 
potential risk of teratogenicity was updated to reflect the information reported in the MAH Database. 
The overall text was reviewed to improved readability and to update the potential risk of 
teratogenicity. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The information on the potential risk teratogenicity in RMP section SVII.3.1 was updated to reflect the 
information included in the MAH’s database with the updated DLP and to improve the readability of the 
section. This is endorsed. However, the following conclusion on study EFC11759 with regard to the risk 
of teratogenicity is not appropriate and is to be deleted with the next RMP update (page 73 in tracked 
version):  
“Overall, teriflunomide was well-tolerated with a manageable safety profile, consistent with the 
experience observed in the double-blind period.” 
The statement on the relatedness between teriflunomide and congenital malformation (page 73 of 
tracked version) should be revised as follows with the next RMP update:  
“Therefore, a total of 1274 cases of drug exposure via parent were retrieved. Of which, 30 pregnancies 
(considering a total exposure of 621 859 patient years as of DLP 12-Sep-2022) involved possible 
congenital malformations, for which causal relatedness was not could neither be established nor 
denied:” 
No detailed assessment of individual case reports was provided, however, it is doubted that a causal 
relationship between teriflunomide exposure during pregnancy and the congenital malformations 
reported can be excluded in the majority of the 30 cases. 
The RMP should be revised accordingly, with the next RMP update.  
Conclusion 
 Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly 
No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance 
Question 2 
The MAH should remove “long-term safety in paediatric patients” as missing information from the 
summary of safety concerns as well as all other Parts of the RMP  
MAH’s response 
The MAH acknowledges the Agency’s comment and has modified the RMP accordingly. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The missing information ‘long-term safety in paediatric patients’ has been removed from the summary 
of safety concerns and all relevant sections of the RMP. 
Issue resolved.  
Conclusion 
Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly

Question 3 
The MAH is asked to confirm that “long-term safety in paediatric patients” will be retained in the 
summary of safety concerns in PSURs in order to ensure regular analysis of all available data regarding 
this topic, so that potential changes in the safety profile, which might become visible when post-
marketing exposure will increase, can be identified in a timely manner.  
MAH’s response 
The MAH confirms that long-term safety in paediatric patients will be retained in the summary of safety 
concerns in PSURs 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH confirmed to retain long-term safety in paediatric patients in the PSUR summary of safety 
concerns. 
Issue resolved.  
Conclusion 
Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly 
No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance  
Question 4 
In RMP Part III.2 information was added about an ongoing optional additional extension period of 
Study EFC11759 with teriflunomide offered to participants when they completed the study, to provide 
treatment until they are 18 years old and/or can switch to teriflunomide commercial product. However, 
it is not clear why this optional additional extension phase is needed, as teriflunomide is already 
approved in children 10 years and older in the EU. The MAH is asked to elaborate on this and to 
explain if submission of further data from this optional additional extension period of the study is 
planned, for example in PSURs. If this is not the case, it is not considered necessary to include the 
information about this optional extension in the RMP. 
MAH’s response 
In the RMP Part III, in the paragraph informing on the removal of the completed pediatric clinical study 
(EFC11759) from the PV plan (both double-blind, and open-label periods), information related to an 
ongoing optional additional extension period was included for transparency reasons. The primary aim 
of this extension is not the collection of safety data but rather to provide access to the drug product to 
pediatric patients in countries outside of Europe, where it is not marketed yet. 
The MAH acknowledges that this information related to the extension period of Study EFC11759 may 
convey some confusion; therefore the MAH proposes to remove it from the RMP. Cases reports related 
to patients enrolled in this optional extension phase will be reviewed as part of the routine PV 
surveillance process, as included in the PSUR. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Reference to the ongoing additional extension period of Study EFC11759 was removed from RMP 
section III.2. The MAH explained that this optional extension is aimed at providing access to 
EMA/CHMP/224365/2023  
Page 43/45 
 
  
 
 
terflunomide for paediatric patients outside Europe, where it is not yet marketed. A deletion in the EU 
RMP is therefore considered justified. However, all safety-related information from this extension study 
will be reported as part of routine PhV monitoring. 
Issue resolved.  
Conclusion 
Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly 
No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance  
Question 5 
In Annex 2 Study EFC11759 was added to Table 2 describing completed studies. This is generally 
endorsed, however, the new entry in Table 2 should not be restricted to the open-label period but to 
the complete study. The wording should be changed as follows: 
EFC11759: Open label period of a A multicenter, randomized, double blind, parallel 
group trial to evaluate efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of 
teriflunomide in comparison to placebo followed by a long-term open label extension 
phase, in children and adolescents 10 to 17 years of age with MS with relapses. […] 
MAH’s response 
The MAH agrees with the Agency’s comment and has updated the Table 2 of Annex 2 accordingly. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Annex 2 has been revised as requested. 
Issue resolved.  
Conclusion 
Overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance has/have been updated accordingly 
No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance  
Question 6 
The MAH is reminded to provide the complete RMP, including annexes, in track-changes-mode in all 
further steps of this procedure and any future procedures. 
MAH’s response 
The MAH acknowledges the request from the Agency and hereby provides the complete RMP, including 
annexes, in track-changes mode taking into account updates following the PRAC preliminary 
assessment report received on 28-Feb-2023. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH provided the complete RMP in track-changes-mode, including annexes, as requested.

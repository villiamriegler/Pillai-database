1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

SmPC and PL 
In accordance with Article 45 of the Paediatric Regulation 
Product Characteristics (SPC) further to the request 
of the CHMP following the assessment of paediatric 
data submitted in accordance with Article 45 of 
Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended (P45-
012). 
1901/2006, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) 
submitted available paediatric data. Following the 
assessment of these paediatric data, the CHMP concluded 
that although demonstrating an effect that appears to be 
similar to that seen in adults, the submitted study does not 
allow any conclusions on posology in children and

Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the 
MAH 
However, safety data is available in 42 children, aged 8 
months to 19 years. The data indicate that the safety 
profile of Optison is similar in this age group when 
compared to adults. This information could be of use to the 
prescriber and CHMP recommended that sections 4.2 and 
5.1 were amended with these observations.

Renewal of the marketing authorisation. 
19/03/2008 
12/06/2008 
SmPC, Annex 
Based on the CHMP review of the available information and 
II, Labelling 
on the basis of a re-evaluation of the benefit risk balance, 
and PL 
the CHMP is of the opinion that the safety and efficacy of 
this medicinal product continues to be adequately and 
sufficiently demonstrated and therefore considered that the 
benefit risk profile of Optison continues to be favourable.  
The CHMP was also of the opinion that the renewal can be 
granted with unlimited validity. However, due to limited 
exposure and in light of the ongoing discussions with the 
US FDA regarding the changes to the USPI in the context of 
the safety concern on micro-bubble contrast agents, the 
CHMP is of the opinion that the MAH should continue to 
provide annual PSURs. 
Notwithstanding the above, the CHMP noted that the MAH 
was not able to present an authorised importer for Optison 
to ensure the supply of the medicinal product at the 
EU/EEA market and to proof GMP compliance of the 
manufacturing process at the US manufacturing site at the 
time of this Renewal. Therefore, the CHMP recommends 
that the marketing authorisation of Optison should be 
suspended. 
The following changes were included to Section 4.4 and 
Section 4.8 of the SPC including corresponding changes to 
the package leaflet: 
Section 4.4 was amended in that the warning on 
Page 13/17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hypersensitivity was made broader and is no longer linked 
to human albumin and protein allergy. Furthermore, the 
recommended time for monitoring of severely ill patients 
with certain conditions (with cardiac, pulmonary, renal, 
hepatic diseases) was extended to during and after 
administration of Optison. Finally, a recommendation to use 
end-diastolic triggering to avoid biological side effects of 
the contrast agent due to interaction with the ultrasound 
beam was included. 
In the Section 4.8, the term anaphylactoid shock was 
included.

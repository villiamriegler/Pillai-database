SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
This  module  reflects  the  initial  scientific  discussion  and  scientific  discussion  on  procedures, 
which have been finalised before 1 January 2003. For scientific information on procedures after 
this date please refer to module 8B. 
1. 
Introduction 
Puregon  contains  the  active  substance,  follitropin  beta  (INN),  a  recombinant  human  Follicle 
Stimulating Hormone (r-hFSH). 
This medicinal product is referred to List A in the Annex of the Council Regulation (EEC) 2309/93 as 
it is developed via recombinant DNA technology. 
FSH is a gonadotropic hormone produced by the anterior lobe of the mammalian pituitary gland. It is a 
heterodimeric  glycoprotein  consisting  of  two  subunits,  a  92-amino  acid  α-chain  (common  to  other 
glycoprotein hormones) and a specific 111-amino acid β-chain. The hormone can exist in a variety of 
isoforms  and  its  activity  varies  according  to  the  degree  of  glycosylation.  FSH  is  indispensable  for 
normal  female  and  male  gamete  growth  and  maturation,  and  normal  gonadal  steroid  production. 
Deficient endogenous production of FSH is a known cause of infertility. Administration of exogenous 
gonadotropins  is  used  to  treat  infertility,  and  gonadotropins  extracted  from  the  urine  of 
postmenopausal women have been on the market for over 30 years. 
The manufacture of gonadotropins via recombinant DNA technology is independent of the collection 
of  large  volumes  of  urine  and  results  in  a  highly  pure  product.  It  is  devoid  of  infectious  or 
pharmacological contaminants such as LH, proteinacious or potentially allergenic materials. 
The  action  of  Puregon  is  similar  to  that  of  the  natural  Follicle  Stimulating  Hormone  (FSH).  In  the 
female  the  level  of  FSH  is  critical  for  the  onset  and  duration  of  follicular  development,  and 
consequently  for  the  timing  and  number  of  follicles  reaching  maturity.  Puregon  can  thus  be  used  to 
stimulate  follicular  development  and  steroid  production  in  selected  cases  of  disturbed  gonadal 
function. Furthermore Puregon can be used to promote multiple follicular developments in medically 
assisted  reproduction  programs  [e.g.  in  vitro  fertilisation/embryo  transfer  (IVF/ET),  gamete  intra-
fallopian  transfer  (GIFT)  and  intracytoplasmic  sperm  injection  (ICSI)].    Treatment  with  Puregon  is 
generally followed by administration of hCG to induce the final phase of oocyte maturation including 
resumption of meiosis, rupture of the follicle to release the oocyte and formation of corpus luteum. 
In males deficient in FSH, Puregon should be used concomitantly with HCG for at least four months 
to promote spermatogenesis. 
Puregon powder for solution for injection is presented as a lyophilised cake (75 I.U.) or as lyophilised 
sphere, a so-called lyosphere (50 I.U., 100 I.U. or 150 I.U.). Each box of Puregon powder for solution 
for  injection  contains  1,  3,  5  or  10  ampoules  or  vials  of  follitropin  (plus  1,  3,  5  or  10  ampoules  of 
solvent  for  reconstitution  containing  1ml  of  saline  solution  0,45%).  Puregon  can  be  used  for 
intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. In order to avoid injection of large volumes, 3 to 4 ampoules 
or vials of Puregon may be dissolved in 1 ml of solvent. When only 1 or 2 ampoules/vials are required, 
the volume may be reduced to 0.5 ml. 
Puregon solution for injection is presented in the following strengths: 50 IU/0.5ml, 75 IU/0.5 ml, 100 
IU/0.5  ml,  150  IU/0.5  ml,  200  IU/0.5  ml,  225  IU/0.5  ml  and  250  IU/0.5  ml.  Each  box  of  Puregon 
solution  for  injections  contains  1,  5  or  10  vials  with  solution  for  intramuscular  or  subcutaneous 
injection. There are also two multidose formulations, containing 300 IU/0.36 ml and 600 IU/0.72 ml 
solutions  for  injection,  filled  in  cartridge.  These  presentations  are  to  be  used  with  a  pen-injector 
device. Each box contains 1 cartridges and 7 injection needles.

Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Puregon consists of a powder for solution for injection containing r-hFSH in a lyophilised form and a 
solvent  for  reconstitution.  It  has  high  biochemical  purity  (>  99%)  and  a  high  specific  biological

activity  (approximately  10  000  I.U./mg  1).  Puregon  also  exists  as  a  solution  for  injection.  For  the 
multidose formulation, benzylalcohol has been added as an anti-microbial agent. 
The active substance, follitropin beta, a recombinant human Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) is a 
glycoprotein. Recombinant human FSH is a heterodimer comprising 2 subunits, namely, an α- and a 
β-  subunit,  which  are,  associated  non-convalently.  The  α-subunit  is  common  to  the  glycoprotein 
hormone family consisting of Luteinising Hormone (LH), Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), and 
human  Chorionic  Gonadotrophin  (hCG)  whereas  the  specific  β-subunit  determines  the  specific 
biological activity of each hormone. 
Follitropin  beta  is  expressed  in  a  Chinese  Hamster  Ovary  (CHO-K1)  cell-line  used  as  the  host  cell 
system, which has been transfected with two plasmids containing respectively: 
-  the human FSH α and β genes; 
-  selector markers. 
The  Working  Cell  Bank,  obtained  from  one  stable  clone  producing  biologically  active  human  FSH 
referred  to  as  the  Master  Cell  Bank,  undergoes  a  fermentation  process  divided  into  two  phases:  the 
pre-production  or  initiation  of  a  production  run  and  the  production  phase.  The  fermentation,  which 
requires defined growth media at 37°C is continuously harvested and filtered aseptically to give a cell-
free  supernatant  containing  the  recombinant  protein.  The  purification  process  involves  nine  separate 
steps;  each  designed  to  remove  specific  contaminants,  leading  to  the  final  bulk  product  for  the 
preparation  of  the  finished  product.  A  batch  is  defined  as  the  purified  half  of  each  harvest  from  a 
complete production volume of a 10 litres fermenter. A variation (submitted in July 1996, approved by 
the  Commission  in  November  1996)  increased  the  batch  size  of  the  active  substance:  the  complete 
harvest or half of each harvest of the complete production volume of the 10 l fermentor can be used 
for purification. 
The characterisation of the active substance revealed that the preparation contains less relatively acidic 
and more relatively basic isoforms than urine derived FSH. 
Post-marketing Activities 
In  July  1999,  the  company  submitted  a  type  II  variation  related  to  the  release  tests  on  the  active 
substance  (follitropin  beta).  On  basis  of  the  submitted  information,  the  European  Commission 
approved in 22 December 1999 this variation and the new release test/specifications. 
Further, the CPMP issued on 28 August 2000 a positive Opinion on a Type II variation concerning  
changes in test methods and release specifications for the active substance (follitropin beta) of Puregon 
solution for injection in cartridges. The Commission Decision was amended on 19 January 2001. 
The EMEA issued on 22 September 2000 a positive Notification on a Type I variation concerning a 
change in the in-process control for Puregon solution for injection in vials. 
The  Company  submitted  a  type  II  variation  on  8  December  2000  to  demonstrate  compliance  with 
Directive  1999/82/EC  and  the  Note  for  Guidance  on  minimising  the  risk  of  transmitting  animal 
spongiform encephalopathy agents via medicinal products. The corresponding Commission Decision 
was issued on 10 April 2001.   
On  12  November  2001,  the  Company  submitted  a  Type  II  variation  concerning  a  change  of  test 
methods  and/or  specifications  for  the  active  substance.  The  respective  Commission  Decision  was 
issued on 19 March 2002. 
The EMEA issued on 30 May 2002 a positive Notification on a Type I variation concerning a minor 
change of manufacturing process of the active substance, which did not require any amendment to the 
Community Marketing Authorisation.

The EMEA issued on 27 June 2002 a positive Notification on a Type I variation concerning a change 
in the test procedure of the active substance, which did not require any amendment to the Community 
Marketing Authorisation. 
Finished product manufacture for the powder for solution for injection:  
The  aseptic  manufacturing  process  of  the  finished  product  includes  two  phases,  the  bulk  solution 
preparation and the preparation of a freeze-dried cake or sphere (lyosphere). 
The  lyosphere  formulation,  which  is  a  new  lyophilised  presentation  form  of  spherical  shape,  is 
bioequivalent with that developed for the cake presentation. Cakes are freeze-dried from 0,5 ml bulk 
solution and lyospheres from 0,1 ml.  
The formulated product is contained in a colourless glass ampoule (lyosphere) or glass vial (cake) (Ph. 
Eur. glass Type 1), sterilised. 
Finished product manufacture for the solution for injection:  
The excipients are dissolved in water for injections. Follitropin beta in dissolved in the solution. The 
pH is adjusted to 7.0 if necessary, the solution is diluted to volume with water for injections and the 
solution  is  filtered  through  0.22  µm  membrane  filters.  The  filtered  solution  is  filled  aseptically  into 
sterilised vials or cartridges.  
The product is presented as an aqueous solution filled in a colourless 3 ml injection vial of hydrolytic 
resistant glass, type I closed with chlorobutyl rubber closures. The multidose presentation is filled in 
1.5 ml cartridges of hydrolytic resistant glass, type I. The cartridges were initially filled with 0.525 ml 
solution (833 IU/ml) in the 300 IU process and with 0.885 ml in the 600 IU process. 
Process  validation  has  been  described  for  at  least  one  batch  for  each  product  strength.  The 
specifications for release of the finished product were judged adequate. 
The  shelf  life  for  the  powder  for  solution  for  injection  is  two  years  when  the  medicinal  product  is 
stored in the containers in which they are supplied, under temperatures below 30 °C, not frozen and 
protected from light.  
For the solution for injection (single-dose and multidose presentations), a 2-year shelf life at 2 °C – 8 
°C was initially approved.  
Post marketing activities 
On 8 December 2000, the European Commission approved a type II variation concerning a change in 
storage  conditions  for  the  Puregon  solution  for  injection  (vials  and  multidose  cartridges).  The 
Company provided stability data to justify that the product can be stored below 25°C for a maximum 
of 3 months. The SPC, labelling and Package Leaflet have been updated accordingly to indicate that 
the patient may store the product outside the refrigerator.  
On 18 October 2001, the European Commission issued a Commission Decision for a type I variation 
concerning  an  extension  of  the  shelf  life  of  Puregon  solution  for  injection  in  vials  and  Puregon 
solution for injection in cartridges from 2 years to 3 years. The scope of this variation was to extend 
the shelf life as foreseen at the time of authorisation. The EMEA notified the European Commission 
on 13 July 2001 that the variation was accepted.  
During  the  initial assessment  procedure  of  the  powder  for solution for  injection, quality points were 
raised and resolved by the company: 
1. 
2. 
The use of ampoules for lyophilised products, instead of vials has been justified by showing the 
minimisation of the microbiological risks of contamination. 
In response to the objections regarding the genetic development of Puregon and the construction 
of the plasmid, further information was provided.

The company has clarified points with regard to the purification steps and to the quality criteria 
to justify reprocessing. 
Additional information on the pharmaceutical dossier were provided during a hearing held on 13-14 
November at the CPMP Working Party Biotechnology/Pharmacy (BWP) on the issues listed below: 
1. 
2. 
Validation data on the ISOQUANT method used to study the deamidation of asparagine.

sialic acid content.  
3. 
Data on the development of a vial to replace the ampoule presentation. 
The  BWP considered the responses  satisfactory but recommended that the company should  provide, 
before a positive opinion is granted, at least 2 pilot scale batches analysis data for each strength and 
each formulation generated at the Irish manufacturing facility to reassure batch-to-batch consistency. 
Few quality points were identified for which additional information has to be provided on an ongoing 
basis.  The  company,  after  having  being  consulted,  committed  to  provide  this  information  in  the 
timeframe agreed with the CPMP.  
During the assessment procedure of the multidose solution for injection, the BWP was asked for their 
position on the acceptability of a multidose presentation. The BWP accepted that the Company have 
provided assurance that the risk of microbial contamination has been minimised, although, as with all 
multi-dose  presentations, not  eliminated. The  company, during  an oral  explanation at the September 
1999 CPMP meeting, provided further assurance on this issue.

Toxico-pharmacological aspects 
In  the  framework  of  non-clinical  safety  and  efficacy  testing,  Puregon  was  compared  to  two  widely 
used  commercial  preparations:  a  urine-derived  extract  with  FSH  activity  virtually  devoid  of  LH 
activity and a urinary extract with FSH and LH activities. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The  biological  properties  of  Puregon  have  been  compared  to  reference  substances  (urinary  human 
FSH and pituitary human FSH) in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies. The receptor binding affinity 
of follitropin was 2-3 fold higher than that of the urinary or pituitary FSH reference preparations when 
determined  on  the  basis  of  their  declared  in  vivo  bioactivity  (the  rat  ovarian  weight  augmentation 
assay). With regard to the isohormone  profile, which is considered to be important in predicting the 
biological  characteristics  of  the  various  FSH  preparations,  Puregon  was  compared  to  a  urinary  FSH 
preparation using the chromatofocusing technique (pH range 3-6). Similarity in the in vitro and in vivo 
bioactivity  of  the  2  preparations  was  concluded  from  comparable  results  obtained  for  both 
preparations. However, the isohormone distribution indicated that Puregon contains a two-fold lower 
proportion  of  relatively  acidic  and  a  two-fold  higher  proportion  of  relatively  basic  isohormones.  No 
potential drug interactions were explored. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The  isohormone  composition  of  FSH  preparations,  i.e.  the  proportion  of  relatively  acidic  or  basic 
isoforms,  influences  their  kinetic  behaviour,  and,  therefore,  their  in  vivo  bioactivities.  The  company 
stated  that  the  effects  of  a  change  in  the  isohormone  composition  of  follitropin  beta  should  not 
represent  problems  in  administering  the  correct  dose,  since  the  doses  are  adjusted  according  to 
individual patient need.

The pharmacokinetic profile was assessed in rats and dogs and included distribution and elimination 
studies. Both in dogs and in man, the rate and extent of absorption did not differ for intramuscular and 
subcutaneous administration. 
Toxicology  
The package of toxicity studies provided includes 2 single dose intramuscular toxicity studies, repeat 
dose  intramuscular  toxicity  studies    (2-4  weeks),  and  mutagenicity  (Ames  test)  and  local  tolerance 
investigations. 
Observed toxicity of Puregon was almost entirely related to the pharmacological activity of follitropin 
beta. 
Questions  were  raised  during  the  assessment  procedure  and  resolved  by  the  company  by  providing 
additional data: 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
To  assess  the  toxicological  profile  of  the  product  after  repeated  intramuscular  administration 
and to examine the induction of antibodies against r-hFSH, a 13-week study was performed in 
female and male Beagle dogs, at levels up to approximately 10 times the maximum daily human 
dose. No overt signs of toxicity were observed. In most animals, Puregon induced the formation 
of  anti-r-hFSH  antibodies.  An  in  vivo  neutralising  effect  of  these  antibodies  seems  however 
unlikely because similar exaggerated ovarian stimulation was found in all female animals at all 
dose levels tested. 
The absence of reproduction toxicity studies in male animals was justified because these studies 
are considered not to be relevant for the proposed female indications. 
The use of only one or two dose groups in many toxicity studies is justified by the absence of 
intrinsic  toxicity  of  Puregon,  therefore  the  exposure  to  low  doses  was  not  considered  to  be 
relevant. 
Adequate  explanation  of  the  choice  of intramuscular route in the toxicity studies,  whereas the 
administration route in man is also subcutaneous was submitted by the applicant.  
An in vitro cytogenetic assay in human peripheral lymphocytes, which revealed no clastogenic 
activity, was also provided.

Introduction 
The  physiological  function  of  FSH  in  follicular  development  is  well  known.  It  is  claimed  that  only 
minor  changes  exist  between  the  naturally  occurring  human  pituitary  FSH  and  Puregon.    These  are 
thought  not  to  affect  the  receptor  binding  affinity  or  the  intrinsic  bioactivity  of  this  recombinant 
product. 
As stated in the SPC, the therapeutic indications are: 
In the female: 
Puregon is indicated for the treatment of female infertility in the following clinical situations: 
• 
• 
Anovulation  (including  polycystic  ovarian  disease,  PCOD)  in  women  who  have  been 
unresponsive to treatment with clomiphene citrate. 
Controlled  ovarian  hyperstimulation  to  induce  the  development  of  multiple  follicles  in 
medically  assisted  reproduction  programmes  [e.g.  in  vitro  fertilisation/embryo  transfer 
(IVF/ET), gamete intra-fallopian transfer (GIFT) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)]. 
In the male: 
Deficient spermatogenesis due to hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism. 
Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics 
Six  studies  have  addressed  the  primary  and  secondary  pharmacodynamics  and  pharmacokinetics  of 
Puregon (See tables 1 and 2). From these studies Puregon appears to have similar pharmacodynamic 
activities to the urinary FSH comparator in terms of inducing ovum growth and maturation as judged 
by ultrasound and laparoscopic harvesting. 
Recombinant  FSH  is  biochemically  very  similar  to  human  pituitary  FSH  and  is  distributed, 
metabolised and excreted in the same way.  
In  all  pharmacokinetic  studies,  dosing  of  Puregon  and  comparator  products  was  based  on  in  vivo 
bioactivity, whereas immunoreactive FSH plasma levels were measured for kinetic evaluation. 
The pharmacokinetics of a single intramuscular dose or of multiple intramuscular doses were analysed 
in  a  pharmacodynamic  study  versus  the  urinary  FSH  comparator.  However  data  were  presented  on 
small numbers of patients with large interpatient variability, making interpretation difficult. 
After  intramuscular  or  subcutaneous  administration  of  Puregon,  maximum  plasma  concentrations  of 
FSH  are  reached  within  12  hours.  Owing  to  the  sustained  release  from  the  injection  site  and  the 
8/16                                                                          EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
relatively long elimination half-life  of about 40 hours (ranging from 12 to  70 hours), FSH remained 
increased for 24-48 hours. After single dose administration of Puregon, the absolute bioavailability for 
the intramuscular and subcutaneous route was approximately 77%. These two routes of administration, 
although no bioequivalent for Tmax, were bioequivalent for Cmax and AUC. 
Efficacy data 
In  clinical  conditions  with  virtually  no  endogenous  FSH  and  LH  activity  (i.e.  in  extremely 
gonadotropin-deficient  women),  Puregon  induces  normal  follicular  growth,  yet  estrogen  production 
was severely impaired due to insufficient LH-dependent androgen production.  
A full clinical development programme  was carried out for studying Puregon (see overview in table 
3).  The  comparator  considered  as  appropriate  was  a  urinary  FSH  preparation  with  negligible 
luteinising activity. 
The  initial  Puregon  clinical  programme  consisted  of  one  large  randomised  assessor-blind  group-
comparative  study  involving  1000  patients  (Study  37608  with  a  Puregon:  urinary  FSH  comparator 
ratio of 3 : 2). The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Puregon versus 
comparator  in  the  induction  of  controlled  ovarian  hyperstimulation  prior  to  in  vitro  fertilisation 
(IVF)/embryo transfer (ET). The number of  oocytes recovered and the ongoing pregnancy rate were 
defined as main efficacy parameters. 
In this study Puregon has been demonstrated to be at least as effective as the comparator. With respect 
to  the  other  main  efficacy  parameter,  ongoing  pregnancy  rate,  no  statistically  significant  difference 
between Puregon and comparator groups was found. With inclusion of frozen embryo cycles, Puregon 
showed a significantly higher pregnancy rate.  
It  was  considered  that  the  indication,  controlled  ovarian  hyperstimulation,  was  acceptable  based  on 
results obtained from this trial. 
In  relation  to  the  indication  of  infertility  caused  by  anovulation,  the  company  submitted  results 
obtained from a randomised comparative multicentre safety and efficacy study of Puregon and urinary 
FSH  comparator  in  women  with  chronic  anovulation  (WHO  group  II-  pituitary/ovarian  dysfunction 
yielding  a  synchronised  secretion  of  both  gonadotropin  and  oestrogen  in  the  presence  of  normal 
lactotrophic  function)  who  failed  to  ovulate  and/or  to  conceive  during  clomiphene  citrate  treatment 
(study 37609). 
The primary efficacy parameters for this study were: 
• 
• 
the number of cycles needed to achieve ovulation. 
the cumulative ovulation rate after 3 cycles (using the life-table method). 
200  subjects  were  planned  to  complete  this  study.    The  actual  number  of  subjects  recruited  into  the 
study was 172.  In the Per Protocol (PP) statistical analysis, the number of subjects included was 141, 
given  that  protocol  violators  or  patients  who  could  not  fully  complete  the  study  protocol  were 
excluded.  
During  the  assessment  of  the  application,  the  company  was  requested  to  submit  a  new  analysis 
restricted to the PP group of subjects who fully completed the study protocol (Restricted Per Protocol 
RPP involving 122 subjects). 
The overall results of this study are presented in table 4.

Considering  these  results,  there  are  hardly  any  differences  between  the  two  PP  analyses.  After 
analysing  the  impact  of  the  early  termination  on  the  power  of  the  study,  it  was  concluded  that  the 
differences in ovulation rate after  3 cycles  were so small that a reduced sample size did  not  make a 
difference. 
With  regard  to  these  results,  which  demonstrate  the  efficacy  of  Puregon  relative  to  urinary  FSH 
comparator  with  respect  to  inducing  ovulation  in  anovulatory  women  whatever  method  of  analysis 
used, this indication was considered acceptable. 
Questions on efficacy were raised during the assessment and resolved by the company: 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Efficacy  data  indicate  a  stronger  potency  of  Puregon  in  comparison  with  urinary  FSH,  so  the 
recommended dosage schedule may need adaptation. 
Additional  clinical  data  on  the  treatment  of  male  infertility  were  requested.  However,  the 
company decided not to pursue this indication. 
As  further  clinical  data  were  requested  to  support  the  indication  “defective  follicular  ripening 
and/or corpus luteum insufficiency” the company decided to withdraw this indication. 
In  relation  to  the  requested  indication  in  fertility  caused  by  anovulation,  it  was  considered 
necessary  to  state  that  patients  should  be  unresponsive  to  clomiphene  citrate  and  to  request 
further data analysis on this study. 
Safety profile 
During the assessment, in addition to the initial data submitted, further detailed information on safety 
as  well  as  results  on  the  newborn  were  requested.  The  company  resolved  these  two  points  by 
providing an updated safety report. 
This report on safety data available from 1074 (Puregon) and 498 (urinary FSH comparator) patients 
who had completed clinical studies with Puregon or urinary FSH (9 clinical efficacy studies and safety 
studies; 5 studies on the safety, tolerance, pharmacodynamics/pharmacokinetics) was submitted by the 
company during the assessment procedure.  
Most of the reported adverse effects are primarily attributable to the pharmacological properties of the 
drug, and the character of the treatment. These are related essentially to reproductive system disorders 
(ovarian  hyperstimulation  syndrome,  ectopic  pregnancy,  miscarriage,  ovarian  cyst,  vaginal 
haemorrhage).  The  other  main  side  effects  are  related  to  gastro-intestinal  system  disorders,  mostly 
abdominal pain.

In the light of these results, it seemed that the overall incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome 
observed was slightly higher in the Puregon group. However in those studies that allowed statistical 
analysis,  including  the  IVF  and  ovulation  induction  studies,  this  difference  was  not  significant.  The 
Puregon and comparator groups behaved similarly with respect to the total number of serious adverse 
effects reported. 
In none of the Puregon-treated subjects analysed (treated for either one, two, or three cycles) evidence 
was found for the induction of specific antibodies, neither anti-FSH nor anti-CHO cell-derived protein 
antibodies. 
With regard to the subcutaneous route, further data were provided to support the evidence of the local 
tolerance for this route.  The applicant submitted further post-marketing safety data with regard to this 
route of administration. This information supported the local tolerance of the subcutaneous route. 
Questions  on  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  (SPC)  were  raised  during  the  assessment 
procedure. To reflect the data submitted and to address comments by CPMP Members, amendments to 
the SPC were requested and performed. 
Post authorisation activities 
Since  the  approval  of  the  original  Marketing  Authorisation  a  number  of  variations  have  been 
authorised  which  amend  the  clinical  parts  of  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  and  relevant 
parts of the Package leaflet.  
On 5 October 1998, the European Commission approved a variation to amend the SPC and PL to give 
additional guidance in order to avoid injection of large volumes and to reduce pain at injection site.  
On 21 February 2000, the European Commission approved a variation to amend the dosing advice in 
point 4.2 of the SPC. In the initial Product Information, it was stated that Puregon is more efficacious 
than  urinary  FSH  and  therefore  may  require  a  lower  dose.  However,  the  actual  dosing  advice  was 
based  on the  dosages used for  urinary FSH. The following changes to the  product information have 
been approved in this variation:  
• 
• 
Recommended  starting  dose  of  50  IU  (instead  of  75  IU)  FSH  activity  in  the  indication 
‘Anovulation’. 
Recommended  starting  dose  of  100  IU  (instead  of  150  IU)  FSH  activity  in  the  indication 
‘Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation in medically assisted reproduction programmes’. 
Clinical  trials  and  published  data  have  been  provided  to  support  this  lower  starting  dose  for  both 
indications.  
During  an  oral  explanation  before  the  CPMP  (September  1999),  the  company  provided  their 
justification for a lower starting dose for both indications. At the September 1999 meeting, the CPMP 
approved the variation lowering the starting dose for Puregon in the approved indications. 
Two extensions of the marketing authorisation have also been authorised by the Commission (26 April 
1999 and 23 September 1999, respectively) for additional strengths/pharmaceutical forms (single dose 
and multiple dose solution for injection). The report of study 37624 (see table 2) has been submitted, 
11/16                                                                          EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
confirming dose proportionality with the existing formulation (powder for solution for injection). The 
report of study 37626 (An open label, single-dose, cross-over study to study the pharmacokinetics of 
FSH after administration of two pharmaceutical formulations of Org 32489 in healthy female subjects 
whose pituitary function has been suppressed by Lyndiol) demonstrates the bioequivalence of the pen-
injector  solution  and  the  powder  for  solution  for  injection.  However,  this  study  shows  that  a  higher 
dose is delivered using the pen injector than when using a conventional syringe. A statement has been 
included in the SPC of the multidose presentations to reflect this higher delivery with the pen-injector. 
At the September 1999 CPMP meeting, the company justified the rationale/clinical necessity for the 
multidose  presentation  (cartridge)  and  provided  further  reassurance  on  the  quality  of  the  multidose 
presentation with respect to reducing the risk on in-use microbial contamination.  
On 8 December 2000, the European Commission approved a type II variation related to a number of 
changes to the SPC and PL for Puregon.  
The main change entails the addition of an extra precaution to the SPC (section 4.4) and PL (section 2) 
in  order  to  highlight  that  women  with  generally  recognised  risk  factors  for  thrombosis,  such  as  a 
personal or family history, severe obesity (Body Mass Index > 30 kg/m2) or thrombophilia, may have 
an  increased  risk  of  venous  or  arterial  thrombo-embolic  events,  during  or  following  treatment  with 
gonadotropins, even without concurrent OHSS. In these women the benefits of IVF treatment need to 
be  weighed  against  the  risks.  It  should  be  noted,  however,  that  pregnancy  itself  also  carries  an 
increased risk of thrombosis. 
As supporting evidence of the proposed change, the Company provided a review article, a selection of 
haemostatic  studies  and  case-reports  and  a  line  listing  of  three  reports  of  thrombosis  in  association 
with  Puregon  therapy.  The  references  submitted  demonstrate  that  arterial  and  venous  thrombo-
embolism in a variety of sites is a significant problem in association with the use of gonadotropins in 
assisted reproduction. Also, based on 3 case-reports of thrombo-embolism associated with Puregon, an 
additional statement has been added in Section 4.8 (Undesirable Effects) of the SPC.   
Secondly,  in  section  4.2  of  the  SPC,  the  sentence  on  possible  interaction  of  Puregon  and  GnRH 
agonists  has  been  adapted  to  reflect  the  recent  approval  of  GnRH  antagonists  for  the  indication 
“prevention of premature LH rises”.  The amended text reflects the requirement for an increased total 
dose  of  Puregon  when  using  a  GnRH  agonist  as  compared  to  a  GnRH  antagonist  to  achieve  an 
adequate follicular response. 
Thirdly,  in  the  SPC  for  the  powder  and  solvent  for  solution  for  injection,  a  warning  on  possible 
hypersensitivity  and  a  statement  on  antibody  formation  (in  sections  4.4  and  4.8,  respectively)  have 
been deleted. This was done to bring the text for the powder and solvent for solution for injection, in 
line with the recently approved text for the solution for injection.  
Extension of indication: Treatment of males with deficient spermatogenesis due to hypogonadotropic 
hypogonadism 
On 10 April 2001, the European Commission approved a type II variation concerning the addition of a 
new indication for Puregon (all strengths and presentations), namely treatment of male subjects who 
suffer from deficient spermatogenesis due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. As a consequence of 
the new indication, several sections of the SPC and PL were amended.  
In addition, the instructions for ‘intramuscular administration’ in the PL for the ‘Powder and solvent 
for  solution  for  injection’  presentations,  were  changed  in  accordance  with  the  instructions  in  the 
approved PL for the ‘Solution for injection’ presentations.   
Toxico-pharmacological aspects 
No  new  toxico-pharmacological  studies  were  submitted  in  support  of  the  male  indication.    Puregon 
has  been  tested  at  levels  of  up  to  50  IU·kg-1  in  the  rat  and  dog  for  4  and  13  weeks,  respectively.  In 
addition, levels of up to 500 IU·kg-1 have been tested in the rat for up to 2 weeks.  No mortalities or 
toxic effects were observed.  Antibody formation was observed in both species, as would be expected.  
12/16                                                                          EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the dog, increase in testicular size and reductions in the adrenal gland weight and prostate gland size 
were observed in response to the expected pharmacological action of the product. 
No long-term toxicity or carcinogenicity studies have been performed, as the formation of neutralising 
antibodies precludes sustained exposure. 
Puregon showed no mutagenic potential in a battery of genotoxicity tests. 
Intramuscular injection of Puregon for up to 13 weeks in the dog only resulted in findings consistent 
with the known pharmacology of the product. Longer-term treatment in animals was considered to be 
impractical  due  to  the  formation  of  neutralising  antibodies.  The  main  difference  between  the  use  in 
man and in woman is that female use is over a 2 to 3 week period, repeated up to several times. Men 
will receive Puregon 3 times a week for up to a maximum of 18 months or longer. However, there is 
no reason to suppose that long-term use of Puregon in man should be any less safe than the use of the 
other licensed (recombinant) FSH. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Puregon,  as  other  FSH  preparations,  acts  by  stimulating  Sertoli  cells,  which  are  active  in 
spermatogenesis.  In  a  rising  dose  study  in  which  9  gonadotrophin  deficient  but  otherwise  healthy 
males  received  weekly  rising  doses  of  75,  150  and  225  IU  of  Puregon,  median  serum  inhibin 
concentrations  (a  marker  of  Sertoli  cell  activity)  increased  from  165U/L  at  baseline  to  466U/L  at 
maximum. LH concentrations remained very low throughout treatment. 
Pharmacokinetics 
With  reference  to  pharmacokinetics,  there  is  a  great  deal  of  interindividual  variability.  In  addition, 
there is a statistically significant difference between males and females for Cmax and tmax and between 
Puregon and Metrodin (urine derived FSH) for Cmax and AUC 0-00. 
The  difference  between  males  and  females  is  thought  to  be  related  to  subcutaneous  fat  thickness, 
leading to a slower drug absorption in females. 
Multiple dose studies indicated an accumulation factor of 1.5 to 2.5 over single dose AUCs. 
Efficacy  
The  effective  use  of  FSH  for  the  treatment  of  deficient  spermatogenesis  in  hypogonadotrophic 
hypogonadism  is  proven  and  there  is  already  a  preparation  of  recombinant  FSH  licensed  in  this 
indication.  
The Company has submitted one completed phase III study in support of the indication.  This was an 
open, multicentre, multinational, parallel group, 2-dose regimen (150 IU Puregon sc thrice weekly and 
225 IU Puregon sc twice weekly) efficacy and safety study in hypogonadotrophic hypogonadal males 
aged between 18 and 60.   
The  primary  efficacy  parameter  was  the  percentage  of  men  in  whom  treatment  was  successful.  
Treatment  was  judged  successful  if  the  mean  sperm  concentration  of  the  last  two  non-missing 
treatment  assessments  for  that  subject  was  more  than  1  million/ml,  irrespective  of  the  duration  of 
treatment. The overall success rate was 43%; the success rate by treatment received was 40% for the 
thrice  weekly  and  47%  for  twice  weekly  groups  respectively.  Ten  men  (5  in  each  group)  remained 
completely azoospermic throughout the treatment period. 
Safety 
Overall, the incidence of AEs was 80% in the thrice weekly and 60% in the twice-weekly groups. This 
was an increase from 34% as compared with the frequency of AEs during pretreatment with Pregnyl . 
The  AEs  were  scattered  throughout  the  body  systems.  Six  patients  experienced  AEs  during  the 
treatment  period,  which  were  thought  to  be  due  to  the  study  drug.  Among  these  were  two  cases  of 
acne, injection site reaction, injection site pain and single cases of varicose veins, gynaecomastia and a 
dermoid cyst. Distribution of AEs was similar between the two groups. 
There were no serious adverse events occurring in the treatment period that were considered related to 
the treatment drug. There were no deaths.

Renewal of the Marketing Authorisation 
The  CPMP  issued  on  29  March  2001  a  positive  Opinion  on  an  application  for  a  renewal  of  the 
Marketing Authorisation for Puregon. The Commission Decision was amended on 26 July 2001. 
Postmarketing clinical safety evaluated as part of the renewal procedure 
In  the  34  clinical  trials  completed  at  the  time  of  the  application  for  the  renewal  of  the  MA, 
approximately  4,400  patients  were  exposed  to  Puregon.  Additionally,  sales  worldwide  during  the 
reviewed  period  amounted  to  about  1,415.900  IU.  This  would  equate  to  an  overall  maximum  of 
1,474,900-ovulation induction treatment cycles or 662,400 IVF treatment cycles. This post-marketing 
review  of  the  clinical  safety  covers  the  4  1/2  year  period  from  May  1996-November  2000  and 
comprised  a  total  of  6  PSURs.  No  new  safety  issues  were  identified  in  PSURs  1-4  and  no  SPC 
changes were made in this regard. 
The cumulative 4 ½ year PSUR contained 138 spontaneous reports detailing 193 serious ADRs. There 
were  65  serious  ADRs  (61  OHSS,  2  abdominal  pain  and  2  ovarian  disorder)  arising  from  clinical 
trials. There was a single spontaneous report of a fatal reaction (sudden death unexplained at autopsy) 
nine days after finishing Puregon treatment. There were two reports of malignant melanoma, both in 
women  with  a  previous  history  of  skin  lesion  excision.  There  were  exceedingly  few  spontaneous 
reports of adverse pregnancy outcomes.  
Although  women  undergoing  ART  are  generally  very healthy,  adverse  reactions  are  to  be  expected. 
The  extremely  low  reporting  rate  may  be  attributable  to  incorrect  prescriber  perceptions  of  adverse 
event  reporting  requirements  (most  ADRs  are  probably  either  well-known  reactions  or  common 
adverse pregnancy outcomes). Ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage/perinatal death arising from clinical 
trials was not reported as part of these safety reports, since they were considered unrelated to the study 
drug by the MAH.  
During  the  recent  marketing  authorisation  renewal  procedure  for  another  recombinant  follitropin, 
CPMP  requested  the  addition,  clarification  or  relocation  of  several  non  product-specific  SPC 
warnings,  which  were  subsequently submitted  as  part of a  variation application. For  consistency the 
MAH was therefore requested during the renewal of Puregon to implement the same SPC warnings as 
part of a future variation application. 
On  5 February 2002, the  European Commission  approved  a type II variation related to  a  number  of 
changes  to  the  SPC  and  PL  for  Puregon.  These  changes  were  proposed  by  the  CPMP  during  the 
renewal procedure and the MAH had made a commitment to submit the variation. 
In section 4.4 (Specific warnings and precautions for use), the warning regarding an increased risk of 
multiple  gestation  was  supplemented  with  a  statement  highlighting  that  appropriate  FSH  dose 
adjustment(s) should prevent multiple follicle development and that multiple gestation, especially high 
order,  carries  an  increased  risk  of  adverse  maternal  and  perinatal  outcomes.Moreover,  the  parents 
should be advised of the potential risks of multiple births before starting treatment. 
There have been only two reports of foetal disorder associated with Puregon (one case each of spina 
bifida and of bilateral iris coloboma). This is possibly an underestimate, as the background incidence 
in  the  general  population  is  likely  to  be  increased  due  to  the  relatively  advanced  age  of  assisted 
reproduction patients. A warning was therefore considered necessary. For consistency, the following 
wording  already  agreed  by  the  CPMP  for  another  recombinant  follitropin  was  added  to  section  4.4: 
“the  incidence  of  congenital  malformations  after  Assisted  Reproductive  technologies  (ART)  may  be 
slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental 
characteristics (e.g maternal age, sperm characteristics) and multiple gestations.” 
In  section  4.4,  a  general  statement  concerning  reproductive  neoplasms  was  added,  since  there  have 
been reports of ovarian, breast and uterine neoplasms in women who have received drugs for ovulation 
induction, including gonadotrophins. The risk of these types of cancer in women who have received

recombinant FSH such as Puregon is unknown. For consistency, the following wording already agreed 
by the CPMP for another follitropin was added to section 4.4: “There have been reports of ovarian and 
other  reproductive  system  neoplasms,  both  benign  and  malignant,  in  women  who  have  undergone 
multiple drug regimens for infertility treatment. It is not yet established whether or not treatment with 
gonadotrophins increases the baseline risk of these tumours in infertile women”. 
In  section  4.6  (Pregnancy  and  lactation),  an  additional  text  was  added  in  order  to  provide  limited 
information  in  the  case  of  inadvertent  exposure  during  pregnancy.  For  consistency,  the  following 
wording  already  agreed  by  the  CPMP  for  another  recombinant  follitropin  was  added:  “there  is  no 
indication  to  use  Puregon  during  pregnancy.  No  teratogenic  risk  has  been  reported,  following 
controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, in clinical use with urinary gonadotrophins. In case of exposure 
of  during  pregnancy,  clinical  data  are  not  sufficient  to  exclude  a  teratogenic  effect  of  recombinant 
FSH. No teratogenic effect has been observed in animals studies.” 
On 28 October 2002, the European Commission approved a Type II variation concerning an update of 
section 4.4 of SPC and section 2 of the PL as requested by the CPMP following the assessment of a 
pharmaceutical  Follow-up  Measure  related  to  the  manufacturing  process.  Information  regarding  the 
possibility  of  Puregon  to  contain  traces  of  streptomycin  and/or  neomycin  that  may  cause 
hypersensitivity  reactions  was  included  in  these  sections.  In  addition,  section  4.8  of  the  SPC  and 
section 4 of the PL were updated to include information regarding the occurrence of rash and erythema 
based on data from post-marketing experience and assessment of the 6th PSUR.

Overall conclusions and benefit/risk assessment 
Infertility  caused  by  deficient  endogenous  production  of  FSH  may  be  treated  by  administration  of 
exogenous  gonadotropin.  Puregon,  a  biotechnologically  prepared  medicinal  product,  can  serve  as  a 
substitute for natural FSH. 
The CPMP has agreed that the application for marketing authorisation contains sufficient clinical data 
based  on  a  large  randomised  group-comparative  study  to  support  use  of  Puregon  in  Assisted 
Reproductive Technologies in women. 
The  additional  data  submitted  related  to  the  study  evaluating  the  impact  of  Puregon  in  infertility 
caused by anovulation reassured the CPMP Members about the efficacy of Puregon in that indication. 
Based  on  bioequivalence  study,  the  use  of  Puregon  via  the  intramuscular  and  subcutaneous  route  is 
supported.After  considerable  discussion  the  chemistry,  pharmaceutical  and  biological  issues  were 
resolved by the applicant. The batch analysis results obtained from the Irish manufacturing site were in 
compliance  with the specifications. The data  submitted  demonstrated therefore satisfactory batch-to-
batch consistency. 
The preclinical studies submitted were judged sufficient to support product safety.Consequently, in the 
light  of  all  data  available,  the  CPMP  issued  favourable  opinions  for  different  strengths  and 
presentations for granting a marketing authorisation on the following indications: 
“In the female: 
Puregon is indicated for the treatment of female infertility in the following clinical situations: 
• 
• 
Anovulation  (including  polycystic  ovarian  disease,  PCOD)  in  women  who  have  been 
unresponsive to treatment with clomiphene citrate; 
Controlled  ovarian  hyperstimulation  to  induce  the  development  of  multiple  follicles  in 
medically  assisted  reproduction  programmes  [e.g.  in  vitro  fertilisation/embryo  transfer 
(IVF/ET), gamete intra-fallopian transfer (GIFT) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)].” 
Following the review of additional clinical data submitted by the MAH post-approval (see above), the 
CPMP considered that the use of Puregon with hCG can offer a specific subpopulation of infertile men 
a  chance  of  fertility.  The  benefit-risk  should  be  no  different  from  the  other  rFSH  licensed  for  this 
indication  and  there  is  certainly  no  indication  of  any  difference  based  on  the  limited  safety  data 
available  from  the  pivotal  study  undertaken  in  support  of  the  male  indication.  There  is,  of  course,  a 
15/16                                                                          EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
substantial  body  of  reassuring  safety  data  from  the  use  of  Puregon  in  women,  although  in  women 
treatment is over a shorter time period. 
Consequently, in the light of all data available, the CPMP issued favourable opinions for the extension 
of the indication to include also the following clinical situation: 
“In the male: 
Deficient spermatogenesis due to hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism.” 
Further, during the period covered by the cumulative safety data provided with the renewal application 
(May  1996  –  November  2000)  (see  above),  no  major  new  safety  signals  have  arisen  and  the  CPMP 
concluded that the benefit/risk for Puregon remains positive. 
Benefit/risk assessment 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the 
benefit/risk profile of Puregon was favourable in the treatment of infertility in women who either have 
not  responded  to  treatment  with  another  ovulation  stimulant  (clomiphene  citrate)  or  who  are 
undergoing treatment for assisted reproduction techniques, like in vitro fertilisation and in  men with 
deficient spermatogenesis due to hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism.

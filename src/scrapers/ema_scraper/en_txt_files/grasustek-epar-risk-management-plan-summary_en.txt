II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further 
characterise the risks  
Important  risks  of  Grasustek  6  mg  solution  for  injection  in  pre-filled  syringe,  together  with 
measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies for learning more about Grasustek 6 mg 
solution for injection in pre-filled syringe's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment and signal management activity, so that immediate 
action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Grasustek 6 mg solution for injection in 
pre-filled syringe is not yet available, it is listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Grasustek 6 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe are risks that need 
special risk management activities to further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal 
product  can  be  safely  administered.  Important  risks  can  be  regarded  as  identified  or  potential.

Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
Acute myeloid leukaemia/myelodysplastic 
syndrome (cancer of the blood and a disorder that 
can occur when the blood-forming cells of the bone 
marrow are damaged) has been identified as an 
important potential risk in Neulasta® post-marketing 
adverse event reporting, Ristempa® (pegfilgrastim) 
public assessment report and literature. 
AML: 
Relatives of patients with leukemia are at higher risk 
of contracting AML (by approximately 2- to 7-fold). 
There is evidence that a sibling of an AML patient 
who becomes a bone marrow or PBPC donor may 
develop AML later in life independent of drugs or 
techniques used to facilitate the donation. 
Chemotherapy and/or radiation treatment for a 
primary malignancy is associated with risk of 
secondary AML. Alkylating agents and 
topoisomerase II inhibitors have been implicated as 
being leukemogenic.  
Environmental risk factors for AML may include 
ionizing radiation, non-ionizing radiation, benzene, 
pesticides, smoking, diet, diagnostic radiology, 
medications (eg, chloramphenicol), viruses, and 
other occupational exposure such as from the leather 
and printing industry. 
MDS: 
First-degree relatives of adults with MDS have a 
15-fold increased risk of MDS. Chemotherapy 
and/or radiation treatment for a primary malignancy 
is also a risk factor for MDS. Other risk factors 
include aplastic anemia, paroxysmal nocturnal 
hemoglobinuria, ionizing radiation, alkylating 
agents, occupational and environmental carcinogens 
(eg, halogenated organics, metals, copper, arc 
welding fumes, exhaust gases, pesticides, smoking, 
hair dye, benzene, polyaromatic hydrocarbons in air 
pollution).

Important Potential Risk: Cytokine release syndrome 
Additional risk minimisation measures: 
None 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
Cytokine release syndrome (a severe inflammatory 
response caused by the release of immune-
stimulating proteins) can be associated with a 
collection of symptoms including fever, pain, low 
blood pressure, rapid heart rate, headache, delirium, 
seizures and tremors. It has been identified as an 
important potential risk in Neulasta® post-marketing 
adverse event reporting following PRAC review of 
case reports in EudraVigilance, Ristempa® 
(pegfilgrastim) public assessment report and 
literature. 
The administration of monoclonal antibodies and 
other drugs elicit infusion reactions, and the risk 
factors for cytokine release syndrome-mediated 
infusion reactions remain unclear. The severity of 
the infusion reaction might be related to the number 
of circulating lymphocytes. During the first infusion 
of rituximab to patients with relapsed B-cell chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia or low grade B-cell 
lymphoma, patients with lymphocyte counts >50 x 
109/L were significantly more likely to have severe 
symptoms than those having lower baseline 
lymphocyte counts (p = 0.0017). A person's risk for 
an infusion reaction to a monoclonal antibody is 
influenced by the route and rate of administration, 
drug form, whether the drug is given in combination 
or as a single agent, and concomitant medications. 
Geographic location may elevate the risk for an 
infusion reaction from cetuximab.

Risk minimisation measures 
Drug interaction with lithium has been identified as 
an important potential risk in Neulasta® clinical 
studies, post-marketing adverse event reporting and 
Ristempa® (pegfilgrastim) public assessment report. 
Therapeutic uses of lithium for hematologic 
conditions include: idiopathic neutropenia, Felty's 
Syndrome, several childhood neutropenic disorders, 
infectious and iatrogenic neutropenia, clozapine and 
carbamazepine-induced granulocytopenia, aplastic 
anemia, and post chemo-/ radio-therapy. Although 
lithium use is frequently associated with 
leukocytosis,  
(White blood Cell count [WCC] >100 X 109/L) 
represents a clinical emergency because of the risk 
of cerebral infarction and haemorrhage" but that 
"WCC induced does not exceed 1 to 5 times the 
upper limit of the normal range" and is "reversible 
on withdrawing the drug [lithium]".

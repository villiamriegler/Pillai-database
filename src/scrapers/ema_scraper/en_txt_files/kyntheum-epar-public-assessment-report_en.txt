2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Kyntheum is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who are 
candidates for systemic therapy. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Psoriasis is one of the most common human skin diseases affecting 2 to 3% of the general population with 
significant variation by geographic location and age. The prevalence of psoriasis varies in the EU from 
0.6% to 8.5%. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The interleukin-17 (IL-17) cytokine family consists of 6 cytokines (IL-17A to 17F) and 5 receptor subunits 
(IL-17RA to IL-17RE). IL-17RA is required for mediating the biological activities of multiple IL-17 cytokine 
family members, including IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-17A/F heterodimer, IL-17C, and IL-25 (also known as 
IL-17E) (Johansen et al 2009). 
Interleukin-17A, IL-17F, and IL-17A/F are hallmark proinflammatory cytokines produced by T-helper 
cells producing IL-17 (Th17) cells and innate immune cells that have been shown to contribute to an 
inflammatory response in models of autoimmune disorders. Interleukin-17A, IL-17F, and IL-17A/F have 
pleiotropic activities, including the induction of proinflammatory mediators from epithelial cells, 
endothelial cells and fibroblasts that promote tissue inflammation and destruction; the proliferation, 
maturation, and chemotaxis of neutrophils; and the maturation of dendritic cells.

The IL-17 receptor plays a central role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Blocking the IL-17 receptor on 
keratinocytes and immune cell types has emerged as a critical target for the treatment of psoriasis. 
IL-17R blocking has been shown to reduce inflammation, hyperproliferation, and skin thickening in a 
number of experimental models1. Pharmacodynamically, inhibition of IL-17 signalling is associated with 
improvements in lesional skin mRNA levels for a number of IL-17-modulated factors and other 
inflammatory pathway mediators, resulting in successful treatment with reduction of inflammation2. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation 
Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease associated with serious comorbidities 
and substantial impairment of physical and psychological quality of life. The uncontrolled inflammation of 
psoriasis may contribute to commonly associated comorbidities, including cardiovascular (CV) disease 
(including hypertension and increased risk for myocardial infarction, stroke, and CV death), obesity, type 
2 diabetes, arthritis, and chronic renal disease. Psoriasis is also associated with serious psychiatric 
comorbidities, including depression, anxiety, and suicidality, as well as substance abuse. 
2.1.5.  Management 
The current therapeutic options for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis include phototherapy, topical 
agents (e.g., corticosteroids), conventional systemic therapy (e.g., cyclosporine, methotrexate, and oral 
retinoids), and biologic therapy including TNF-α antagonists (adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab) and 
anti-IL12/IL23 (ustekinumab and most recently, secukinumab). The conventional therapies are 
associated with dose- and treatment-limiting options. The most common reasons for discontinuation of 
these therapies are lack of efficacy, adverse events (AEs), and treatment inconvenience. The biologic 
agents have been associated with higher objective response rates in clinical trials. Since its approval in 
2009, ustekinumab has been shown to be the most effective biologic agent available. However, even with 
these newer agents, most patients do not achieve optimal efficacy, such as total skin clearance. Although 
newer treatment options provide improved outcomes compared with traditional systemic therapies, there 
remains a significant unmet patient need for novel agents and mechanisms that can provide a rapid onset 
of effect, improved and sustained skin clearance, and minimization of drug-specific safety concerns (e.g. 
serious infections including opportunistic infections and tuberculosis, malignancies including lymphoma, 
immunogenicity and demyelinating neurologic events). 
About the product 
Brodalumab (AMG 827) is a recombinant fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2) antibody, 
that  binds  with  high  affinity  to  human  interleukin-17  receptor  A  (IL-17RA)  and  blocks  the  biological 
activities of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-17A/F heterodimer, and IL-25, resulting in 
inhibition of the inflammation and clinical symptoms associated with psoriasis.  
IL-17RA is a protein expressed on the cell surface and is a required component of receptor complexes 
utilized by multiple IL-17 family cytokines. IL-17 family cytokine concentrations have been reported to be 
increased in psoriasis. IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-17A/F heterodimer have pleiotropic activities including the 
induction of pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-6, GROα, and G-CSF from epithelial cells, endothelial 
cells and fibroblasts that promote tissue inflammation. Blocking IL-17RA inhibits IL-17 cytokine-induced 
responses resulting in normalization of inflammation in the skin.

The proposed and approved indication is: 
Kyntheum is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who are 
candidates for systemic therapy. 
The recommended dose is 210 mg administered by subcutaneous injection at weeks 0, 1, and 2 followed 
by 210 mg every 2 weeks. 
Consideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who have shown no response after 
12-16 weeks of treatment. Some patients with initial partial response may subsequently improve with 
continued treatment beyond 16 weeks. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
This application concerns a centralised procedure (according to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004), 
mandatory scope (Article 3(1)), Annex (1) Biotech medicinal product. The application has been submitted 
in accordance with Article 8.3 in Directive 2001/83/EC (i.e. dossier with administrative, quality, 
non-clinical and clinical data), as new active substance. 
Scientific  Advice  from  EMA  was  requested  for  brodalumab  (by  Amgen)  with  regards  to  quality  issues 
(EMEA/H/SA/2172/1/2011/I, 22 September 2011) and clinical development in other indication (psoriatic 
arthritis,  EMEA/H/SA/2172/2/2013/II,  25  July  2013).  The  Applicant  did  not  request  CHMP  Scientific 
Advice on clinical development in psoriasis for this product. 
Pursuant  to  Article  7  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006,  the  application  included  an  EMA  Decision 
P/0235/2014 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP) for the treatment of chronic severe 
plaque  psoriasis.  The  PIP  and  request  for  a  waiver  for  brodalumab  was  submitted  in  2013 
(EMEA-001089-PIP02013).  The  PDCO  opinion  (P/0235/2014)  granted  a  waiver  with  respect  to  the 
population from birth to less than 4 years old and a deferral for studies in population from 4 to 18 years 
of age for completion of studies by January 2026. At the time of submission of the application, the PIP 
P/0235/2014 was not yet completed as some measures were deferred.

heterodimer, and IL-25. It contains 18 disulfide bonds and a N-linked glycosylation site at Asn292 on each 
heavy chain. The molecular mass is 146.8 kDa (143.8 kDa deglycosylated). 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Process description 
The brodalumab active substance is manufactured at Immunex Rhode Island, 40 Technology Way, West 
Greenwich, RI 02817, USA.  
The brodalumab active substance manufacturing comprises typical production steps, i.e. cell culture 
expansion starting from a Working Cell Bank (WCB) vial of brodalumab in a bioreactor, harvesting, 
purification and formulation.  
The brodalumab active substance container closure system is a container sealed with a screw cap closure. 
Control of materials & intermediates 
No raw materials derived from animal origin are used during the active substance manufacture. The 
Applicant uses a tiered quality strategy for raw materials, consisting of supplier qualification, routine 
testing, and auditing to ensure reliable performance against requirements. Qualification consists of 
auditing the supplier, testing raw materials and establishing Quality Agreements. 
The development of fully human monoclonal antibodies directed against human IL-17A receptor was 
undertaken. 
A two-tiered cell banking system of MCB and working cell bank (WCB) was generated in accordance with 
cGMP. The MCB and WCB vials are maintained in controlled conditions.  
Testing and characterisation of the MCB and WCB were performed according to the ICH Q5D guideline.  
The MCB and WCB are sterile and free of detectable mycoplasma and viruses 
Any new WCB will be created from a MCB vial following established manufacturing procedures as 
described and will be qualified to ensure comparability to the existing WCB with respect to safety, genetic 
stability, cell viability after thaw, cell growth, protein production and product quality. 
Control of critical steps & intermediates 
The brodalumab integrated control strategy incorporates operational controls as well as in-process, 
specification, and periodic testing controls. The integrated control strategy reflects knowledge of product 
attributes and their potential to impact patient safety and product efficacy, as well as an understanding of 
the means by which these attributes are controlled through integrated control elements during active 
substance manufacturing. As part of the lifecycle management of the commercial process, these 
assessments are reviewed periodically and updated as needed to ensure that the most current knowledge 
of the product and process are incorporated into the integrated control strategy. 
The control strategy includes: 
- Input controls (e.g. raw materials); 
- Procedural controls (e.g. process design and operational controls); 
- Testing controls, which include controls applied to all lots (e.g., in-process controls (IPCs), active 
substance (and finished product) specification testing), and periodic controls (e.g., process validation, 
product comparability, and stability testing).

IPCs are performance indicators (outputs) used to evaluate in-process performance. Limits for IPCs are 
categorised as performance indicator, rejection limit, action limit, control limit and in-process controls. 
The IPCs are part of a comprehensive analytical control strategy. IPCs which impact critical quality 
attributes are designated as critical. 
Product quality IPCs include product- and process-related impurities, product-related substances and 
general quality attributes. The justification for selection of product quality IPCs and limits are presented.  
These process-related impurity IPCs and their associated limits have been selected for testing in routine 
production based on process understanding and product quality considerations.  
Results from extensive characterisation and challenge studies performed during brodalumab 
development demonstrate that process-related impurity levels are consistently reduced to low levels. 
Process validation 
The process validation lifecycle of the brodalumab active substance process started with the process 
design stage (Process Evaluation) where development of product and process understanding led to design 
of the manufacturing process, evaluation at pilot scale and establishment of the commercial control 
strategy. The completion of the process design stage led to the start of the qualification stage (Process 
Verification) of the process which is followed by continued process verification (Ongoing Process 
Verification) to provide ongoing assurance during commercial manufacturing that the process remains in 
a state of control. 
Characterisation studies demonstrated control of product quality and process consistency when the 
process is operated within defined ranges. The integrated product and process knowledge was used to 
establish the various elements of the control strategy, including identification of process parameters and 
performance indicators and their associated ranges. 
The brodalumab commercial manufacturing process was validated. Acceptance criteria for performance 
indicators were established. Main process validation for brodalumab included cell culture, harvest and 
purification. 
Brodalumab active substance is transported without impact to product. All shipping containers were 
qualified to demonstrate that temperature is controlled for a predefined temperature range and duration.   
Manufacturing process development 
Analytical data are provided supporting comparability of the active substance during development. The 
overall strategy for demonstration of comparability throughout development was based on considerations 
outlined in the ICH Q5E. 
Characterisation 
Brodalumab was characterised using biochemical, biophysical, biological and forced degradation studies 
to provide a comprehensive understanding of its structural and functional properties and to support an 
assessment of the criticality of product quality attributes. 
Specification  
The specifications  include control of identity, purity, potency and other general tests.  
Batch data 
Batch analyses data, for all brodalumab active substance lots used during clinical development and for 
product manufactured at the commercial manufacturing facility have been provided. The batch analyses 
data demonstrate that brodalumab active substance can be manufactured reproducibly to a high level of 
Assessment report

purity,  with  very  low  levels  of  impurities  and  consistent  levels  of  minor  product  variants  throughout 
development. 
Reference standards of materials 
Brodalumab reference standards have been produced and the history of the reference standards has been 
provided. The specified primary reference standard will be used to qualify future primary and working 
reference standards which will be created, as needed, to ensure sufficient supply for release and stability 
testing. The reference standard stability data has also been provided. In addition, the lot that will be used 
to test commercial active substance and finished product lots upon its implementation has been specified. 
Stability 
The stability studies were performed in accordance to ICH Q5C. Stability studies were conducted to 
support the proposed shelf-life.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development 
The finished product is supplied as a sterile, single-use, preservative-free solution for subcutaneous 
injection in a pre-filled syringe (PFS). The presentation contains 140 mg/mL brodalumab in glutamate, 
proline, and polysorbate 20, filled to deliver a volume of 1.5 mL to provide 210 mg of brodalumab.  
The main changes during the development of the 140 mg/mL PFS are the manufacturing site, the primary 
container (different syringes) and the manufacturing scale.   
Results of lot release and stability testing and additional characterisation studies were comparable for the 
commercial product.  
The container closure system complies with Ph. Eur. requirements. Integrity from microbial 
contamination has been demonstrated. Compatibility studies include extractables, leachables and 
sorption. The results give no reason for concern.     
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Process description 
The process includes active substance thaw, formulation (active substance pooling and mixing), 
bioburden reduction filtration, filtered formulated finished product hold, sterile filtration, aseptic filling 
and plunger-stopper placement, inspection and storage.  
Process validation 
Process validation consisted of process design and characterisation studies.  All IPCs and relevant process 
parameters were met, batch homogeneity was confirmed, and the validation batches passed the 
commercial release specifications, demonstrating consistency of the manufacturing process. 
Product specification 
The finished product test methods and acceptance criteria include control of identity, purity, potency and 
other general tests. 
Assessment report  
EMA/381484/2017 
Page 13/135 
 
 
 
 
 
The same reference standards are used for both brodalumab active substance and finished product 
testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data for finished product filled in the 1.5 mL prefilled syringe (PFS) are available.  
Stability data up to 48 months were provided for the PFS to further support the proposed shelf life of 48 
months at 5°C.  
On the basis of the data provided, the acceptable shelf life is 4 years stored at 2°C-8°C. 
Kyntheum may be stored at room temperature (up to 25°C) once, in the outer carton, for a maximum 
single period of 14 days. Once Kyntheum has been removed from the refrigerator and has reached room 
temperature (up to 25°C) it must either be used within 14 days or discarded. 
Adventitious agents 
The information provided on non-viral adventitious agents is sufficient. No material of animal origin is 
used in the manufacturing process of brodalumab.  
Virus safety evaluation of the cell banks was performed in accordance with ICH Q5A.  
Virus clearance studies were performed using appropriate model viruses (xenotropic murine leukemia 
virus (XMuLV), pseudorabies virus (PRV), reovirus type 3 (Reo-3), and/or minute virus of mice (MMV)).  
The results of the virus clearance studies show acceptable reduction of the model virus studied.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Active substance 
Manufacture 
The active substance production process steps are standard for monoclonal manufacture and have been 
appropriately described. Holding times for product intermediates provided were supported by small-scale 
characterisation studies to evaluate the chemical stability. The Applicant’s approach as regards the pool 
holds which are controlled within the validated hold times but may be extended within the characterised 
acceptable hold times through additional validation studies, is considered acceptable. As per request, the 
maximal holding time for the low pH pool was reduced.  
Control of materials 
The presence of the heavy chain variant is one of the main observations of the brodalumab dossier. Its 
presence has been the subject of EMA Scientific advice (EMEA/H/SA/2172/1/2011/1). The CHMP 
concluded that the variant could be considered as a product-related substance provided the variant was 
qualified. Upon request, a rejection limit is set for the heavy chain variant.  
Control of critical steps & intermediates 
Rejection limits are set for safety-related cIPC. Action limits were set for critical IPCs (cIPCs). Upon 
request, these were changed to rejection limits for those cIPCs for which no active substance specification 
Assessment report  
EMA/381484/2017 
Page 14/135 
 
 
 
 
 
is proposed. In addition, detailed description for the analytical procedures controlling these quality 
attributes and their validation is provided, demonstrating suitability for their intended use. 
Process validation 
Results from the process validation studies indicate that the process consistently delivers product that 
meets the acceptance criteria. The requested information on the process demonstrates that mid-range 
target settings have been used (as is appropriate for the PPQ runs). 
Manufacturing process development 
Extensive information is provided on the process characterisation which has resulted in good process 
understanding of both upstream (cell culture and harvest) and downstream processes (purification). 
Upon request, further detailed information and clarification is provided on the various QbD elements used 
in the process characterisation studies. In general, the additional information gives no reason for concern. 
Characterisation 
The information on product characterisation gave rise to a number of other concerns that have been 
satisfactorily addressed by the Applicant. The additional information provided supports the applicant’s 
position that brodalumab has no complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent 
cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity. As per request, the Applicant provided an additional study 
investigating the effect of partial reduction of brodalumab on its potency.  Taken together, the answer is 
considered acceptable.  
Control of active substance 
The provided analytical method descriptions and validation reports are sufficient. 
The Applicant explained the integrated control strategy employed for brodalumab active substance in 
detail. Severity, occurrence and detection scores have been defined and assigned. The overall approach 
that is used to determine risk levels is considered reasonable.  
As indicated in ICH guideline Q6B, the setting of specifications for active substance and finished product 
is part of an overall control strategy which includes control of raw materials and excipients, in-process 
testing, process evaluation or validation, adherence to Good Manufacturing Practices, stability testing, 
and testing for consistency of lots. When combined, all these elements provide assurance that the 
appropriate quality of the product will be maintained. 
Initially, the Applicant proposed to apply limited active substance routine release testing However, 
because also limited IPCs are envisaged, assurance of product quality would rely largely on the control of 
manufacturing process conditions (i.e. by control of process parameters) during commercial production. 
This strategy was not accepted; a Major Objection and several related Other Concerns were raised 
because the proposed control strategy was considered too limited.  In response, the Applicant revised its 
testing strategy. All quality attributes that are tested as critical IPCs and other tests have been added to 
the active substance release specification testing with their respective rejection limit(s). In general, the 
revision of the control strategy sufficiently addresses the concerns raised and the Major Objection was 
considered solved.  
Stability 
Updated stability data from ongoing real-time studies provided during the review further support the 
proposed shelf life. 
Assessment report

Finished product 
Manufacturing process and development 
The finished product (140 mg/mL brodalumab in pre-filled syringe (PFS); fill volume 1.5 mL) 
manufacturing process and development are sufficiently described. No critical process parameters have 
been identified in the manufacturing process. This is acceptable as process conditions can be well 
controlled and monitored.  
Process validation 
The finished product manufacturing process is appropriately validated. Validation of hold-times, filters, 
aseptic process, and transport were included. All IPCs and relevant process parameters were met, batch 
homogeneity was confirmed, and the validation batches passed the commercial release specifications, 
demonstrating consistency of the manufacturing process.  
Finished product control 
The initially proposed finished product specification was considered too limited to ensure consistent 
product quality at release and during shelf life as no criteria were defined for finished product potency, 
and important tests, for example to control product-related impurities and ensure process consistency, 
were missing. This issue was raised as a Major Objection. In their response, the Applicant extended the 
finished product specifications with additional tests. This is considered to solve the Major Objection.   
Upon request, the acceptance criteria for endotoxin, HMW-species, and clarity were justified or revised.   
Stability 
The proposed finished product shelf life is based on 48 months stability data from ‘primary’ lots that are 
not fully representative of the commercial finished product. Data from representative lots were limited to 
3 months stability, but were updated with additional stability data during the procedure. The results are 
in line with the results from the primary lots mentioned above. The available stability data are considered 
sufficient to support the proposed shelf life of 48 months at 5°C.  
Adventitious agents 
The adventitious agents safety evaluation gives no reason for concern. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Overall, the quality of Kyntheum is considered to be in line with the quality of other approved monoclonal 
antibodies. The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological documentation comply 
with existing guidelines. The fermentation and purification of the active substance are adequately 
described, controlled and validated. The active substance is well characterised with regard to its 
physicochemical and biological characteristics, using state-of-the-art methods, and appropriate 
specifications are set. The manufacturing process of the finished product has been satisfactorily described 
and validated. The quality of the finished product is controlled by adequate test methods and 
specifications. 
Viral safety and the safety concerning other adventitious agents including TSE have been sufficiently 
assured. 
The overall quality of Kyntheum is considered acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC.

2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommended a point for investigation. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The pivotal toxicology and toxicokinetic studies were performed in accordance with GLP. No scientific 
advice was obtained from the CHMP regarding non-clinical matters. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Brodalumab is a human monoclonal IgG2 antibody indicated for the treatment of psoriasis, expressed in 
a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line. Brodalumab binds with high affinity to human interleukin-17 
receptor A (IL-17RA) and blocks the biological activities of multiple IL-17 family cytokines including 
IL-17A, IL-17A/F, IL-17F, and IL-25. Brodalumab partially inhibits the biologic activity of IL-17C at a high 
dose. Brodalumab did not bind to (recombinant) human IL-17RB or IL-17RC expressed in mouse 
fibroblasts. 
Brodalumab inhibited IL-6 mRNA production induced by IL-17A plus TNFα in human whole blood in a 
dose-dependent manner. Brodalumab inhibited growth-regulated oncogene alpha (GROα) production 
induced by IL-17A, IL-17F or heterodimeric IL-17A/F in human foreskin fibroblasts, human lung 
fibroblasts and human dermal fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 mostly 21 – 96 pM, in one 
experiment in lung fibroblasts 660 pM). Brodalumab inhibited IL-5 production induced by IL-25 plus IL-2 
in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in a dose-dependent manner. IL-17C was only partially 
inhibited by brodalumab in human epidermal keratinocytes (inhibition of 40% of IL-17C- plus 
TNFα-induced production of beta-defensin 2 gene at 1 µM). 
Brodalumab was found to bind to lymphocytes, macrophages, histiocytes, and dendritic cells, to 
myocytes (smooth myocytes and striated skeletal myocytes) and myofibroblasts and to epithelial cells. 
Brodalumab binding was largely comparable in human, monkey and rabbit tissues. The binding pattern 
largely corresponds to reported expression of IL-17RA, although IL-17RA expression has also been 
reported on osteoblasts and endothelial cells. 
Brodalumab showed cross-reactivity with IL-17RA from cynomolgus monkeys; IL-6 production, induced 
by IL-17A or IL-17F, was inhibited in monkey dermal fibroblasts with comparable potency as in human 
dermal fibroblasts (IC50 human 33-143 ng/ml and monkey 33-383 ng/ml if induced by IL-17A and IC50 
human 0.29-2.46 ng/ml and monkey 0.83-54 ng/ml if induced by IL-17F). Brodalumab also inhibited IL-6 
production from rabbit dermal fibroblasts, but with considerably less potency (IC50 2670 ng/ml). No 
cross-reactivity was found with rat or mouse IL-17RA. Due to consistently high background staining, it 
was not possible to determine brodalumab binding to dog IL-17RA. 
In order to demonstrate the proof of concept, in vivo activity was investigated using surrogate antibodies 
against mouse IL-17RA. Surrogate antibodies that were used were M750, a rat anti-mouse IL-17RA 
monoclonal antibody IgG2b, and M751, a chimeric rat anti-mouse IL-17RA monoclonal antibody with a 
mouse IgG1. In a mouse model of skin inflammation induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate 
Assessment report  
EMA/381484/2017 
Page 17/135 
 
 
 
 
(TPA), prophylactic treatment with M751 at 500 µg IP (application of TPA twice with M751 treatment one 
day earlier) diminished epidermal hyperplasia and inflammatory cells in the dermis and prevented 
parakeratotic scaling and the formation of intra-epidermal pustules. Also the upregulation of a number of 
inflammation-related chemokines and cytokines was inhibited by M751. The activity of M750 and M751 
was also investigated in mouse models of arthritis and asthma. These studies confirmed the ability of 
M750 / M751 to inhibit IL-17RA-mediated effects in inflammatory diseases in vivo. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
IL-17 cytokines play a role in a range of homeostatic and pathogenic processes. Consequently, blockade 
of IL-17RA may have unintended consequences. To address this concern, the applicant has performed a 
review of published literature on IL-17RA, IL-17A and Th17 cells.  
Non-clinical data are conflicting regarding the role of IL-17 signalling in murine models of inflammatory 
bowel disease. In some murine models of chemically-induced colitis, the absence of IL-17A, IL-17F, or 
IL-17RA appears to be protective, while in others no effect was found or the use of IL-17A or IL-17RA 
neutralizing antibody or knockout mice resulted in worsening of the disease. 
Non-clinical data revealed no clear evidence of neutropenia in the toxicology studies in cynomolgus 
monkeys, except at the highest administered dose, in the 1-month study.  
Data from the literature from mouse models of infection and the mechanism of action of brodalumab 
suggest a potential for an increased risk of infections. In mouse models of infection of multiple origins, 
genetic deletion of IL-17RA, IL-17A/IL-17F, or pharmacologic neutralization of IL-17A resulted in 
aggravation of the infection. In the 6-month study with brodalumab performed in cynomolgus monkeys, 
there was also some evidence of infections: treatment-related skin lesions were observed which were 
sometimes associated with yeast or bacteria and minimal to slight glossitis was sometimes associated 
with the presence of yeast.  
Repeated dose studies regarding safety pharmacology and histopathology do not indicate a significant 
risk of cardiovascular events. Studies with cynomolgus monkeys revealed no histopathological effects on 
the CNS or overtly abnormal behavioural effects. It is not known whether brodalumab is distributed to the 
brain, but IgG antibodies can reach the brain, though in low amounts.     
A hypothetical effect, based on the mechanism of action, is a reduction of vaccination effectiveness. 
However, data with brodalumab in monkeys do not indicate a clear risk of a reduction of vaccination 
effectiveness (no effects were observed on organs/tissues of the immune system and no clear effect on 
the T-cell dependent antibody response). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety pharmacology evaluations were incorporated in the repeat dose toxicology studies in cynomolgus 
monkeys. No effects were observed on heart rate, ECG, blood pressure and respiration. A functional test 
of the central nervous system was not performed, as a functional observational battery in rodents was not 
possible because brodalumab is not pharmacologically active in rodents. However, clinical observation of 
monkeys in the toxicology studies and macroscopic and microscopic evaluation of the brain and spinal 
cord did not reveal indications for neurobehavioral effects. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No specific nonclinical drug interaction studies were conducted as no drug-drug interactions were 
expected based on the putative mechanism of brodalumab.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of brodalumab has been investigated upon a single dose intravenous and 
subcutaneous administration in monkeys. Multiple dose toxicokinetics was examined mainly upon weekly 
SC administration, which is the intended clinical route, in monkeys and pregnant monkeys and pregnant 
rabbit. IV multiple dose toxicokinetics was examined in monkey 1-month toxicology study. 
Unbound serum brodalumab concentrations in rabbit and cynomolgus monkey serum and milk were 
determined using a validated ELISA method with a lower limit of quantification of 50 ng/mL. Binding 
anti-brodalumab antibodies in serum of monkey and rabbit were detected using a validated 
electrochemiluminescent bridging immunoassay. Anti-brodalumab positive samples from monkeys were 
further analysed for neutralizing antibodies in a validated cell-based bioassay. 
In general, administration of brodalumab to cynomolgus monkey resulted in a more or less 
dose-proportional increase in Cmax over a dose range 0.5 mg/kg to 200 mg/kg and a greater than 
dose-proportional increase in AUC over a dose range 0.5 mg/kg to 5 mg/kg and a dose-proportional 
increase in AUC over a dose range of 5 to 350 mg/kg.  
Based on AUC after SC administration compared to AUC after IV administration, SC bioavailability in 
monkeys was 44 – 74% after single dose administration of 0.5 – 200 mg/kg and 31 – 52% after repeated 
dose administration of 350 mg/kg/week.   
After repeated dose subcutaneous administration for up to 6 months, no gender differences and no 
unanticipated accumulation were found. Upon subcutaneous administration to monkey absorption was 
relatively slow, having Tmax at 48 – 72 hrs after administration on the first day and 24 – 48 hrs upon 
multiple dosing.  
Formal tissue distribution studies with brodalumab were not conducted, which was agreed by CHMP 
considering that IgG antibodies have limited diffusional distribution from serum to tissue due to their 
molecular size.  
Placental transfer and excretion in milk was evaluated in a cynomolgus monkey maternal, embryo-fetal, 
and neonatal toxicity study. 
The low volume of distribution in cynomolgus monkeys ranging between 15 and 224 ml/kg suggests a 
distribution to the plasma and the extravascular fluid as it is within 2 to 5 times that of plasma volume (45 
mL/kg). This is consistent with the known biodistribution of monoclonal antibodies. 
Evidence of placental transfer of brodalumab was provided by neonatal exposure in some infants at 25 
and 90 mg/kg on birth days 14 (both doses) and 28 (90 mg/kg only) and levels were comparable to or 
slightly higher than maternal serum levels. Brodalumab was present in maternal milk at 90 mg/kg on 
postpartum day 14 only, at very low levels as compared to maternal serum levels (0.1%). However no 
milk sample was analysed immediately after parturition. As an IgG, brodalumab would be expected to be 
present in the first milk. Information on distribution into milk has been included in section 4.6 of the 
SmPC. 
No metabolism studies with brodalumab were conducted in animals. The absence of metabolism studies 
is in accordance with ICH S6(R1). 
As brodalumab is a monoclonal antibody, no renal excretion is anticipated due to its molecular size 
therefore, no specific studies to measure excretion of brodalumab were conducted. The absence of 
excretion studies is in accordance with ICH S6(R1). 
Drug-drug interaction at the PK level is highly unlikely for this type of product since biotechnology-derived 
substances do not metabolize via CYP P450 enzymes.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
In line with ICH S6 (R1) single dose toxicity studies have not been conducted. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies were performed in cynomolgus monkeys, because comparable potency was 
shown for brodalumab for the inhibition of monkey IL-17RA compared to human IL-17RA, whereas 
brodalumab does not cross-react with rodent IL-17RA and assessment of binding to dog IL-17RA was 
inconclusive.

The exposure in the repeated dose studies was sufficiently high compared to the human exposure and 
compared to the IC50 of brodalumab in the in vitro pharmacology tests.  
Mild, focal skin effects (crusts, acanthosis / hyperkeratosis, minimal inflammation) were found 
consistently in all studies. With longer duration, these effects occurred at lower doses. In the 6-month 
study, minimal to slight glossitis was found, sometimes associated with the presence of yeast. Also in the 
6-month study, the skin findings described above were sometimes associated with increased numbers of 
yeast and/or bacteria.  
Literature data from mouse infection models with genetic deletion or pharmacologic neutralization of 
IL-17RA, IL-17A or IL-17F suggest a potential to increase the incidence of infections. 
Apart from the skin, the tongue and the injection site, no target organs for toxicity were found and no 
clear effect on the T-cell dependent antibody response in a KLH test.

Genotoxicity 
Brodalumab is a monoclonal antibody composed entirely of naturally-occurring amino acids and contains 
no inorganic or synthetic organic linkers or other nonprotein portions. Thus, it is highly unlikely that 
brodalumab would react directly with DNA or other chromosomal material. In accordance with 
ICHS6(R1), no genotoxicity studies were conducted. 
Carcinogenicity 
In line with ICH S6 (R1), a weight-of-evidence approach was applied to evaluate the carcinogenic 
potential of brodalumab. 
A risk assessment was provided based on published literature and data from the repeated dose studies 
with evaluation of generalized immune suppression. In the literature, both pro-tumorigenic and 
anti-tumorigenic effects of the IL-17 pathway have been described. Overall, there does not seem to be an 
indication for a dominant anti-tumorigenic effect of IL-17. Also, the absence of effects on the organs of 
the immune system and the absence of a significant effect on the T-cell dependent antibody response to 
KLH indicate that brodalumab is not a general immunosuppressant.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
Fertility-related endpoints were included in the 6-month repeat dose toxicity study in sexually mature 
cynomolgus monkeys, where there were no brodalumab-related effects on sperm motility, density, or 
morphology or on organ weights and microscopic evaluation of reproductive organs. Reproductive and 
developmental toxicity studies included a dose range-finding study in rabbits and an enhanced pre- and 
postnatal  developmental  toxicity  study  in  cynomolgus  monkeys.  The  rabbit  study  was  limited  by 
immunogenicity and the rabbit was not further used for evaluation of reproductive and developmental 
toxicity.

In  accordance  with  ICH  S6(R1)  no  fertility  studies were  conducted.  In  the  repeated  dose  studies,  no 
effects were observed on the reproductive organs or on sperm motility, count and morphology 
Serum  concentrations  in  monkey  infants  and  in  foetal  rabbits  indicate  considerable  passage  of 
brodalumab from the mother to the foetus at the end of pregnancy. 
No adverse effects were found on the embryo-foetal development of cynomolgus monkeys.   
No significant effects were found on pre- and postnatal development of cynomolgus monkeys.  
Only a very small amount of brodalumab was found in milk of high dose animals on post-natal day 14. No 
milk sample was analysed immediately after parturition.

Local Tolerance  
Subcutaneous administration of the formulation containing 140 mg/ml brodalumab caused very slight to 
well-defined erythema and moderate to severe edema in rabbits, whereas no erythema or edema were 
observed after administration of two formulations containing 70 mg/ml. Microscopically there were 
however no differences between the formulations. In the repeated dose studies, dose concentrations 
administered SC to monkeys were all up to approximately 70 mg/ml. Treatment-related reactions such as 
inflammation and scabs at the injection site were observed in the 3-month and 6-month studies. 
Other toxicity studies  
Immunotoxicity was investigated in cynomolgus monkeys by means of standard endpoints in repeated 
dose toxicity studies as well as immunophenotyping and T-cell dependent antibody response assays (KLH 
test) in adult and in juvenile monkeys. No significant effects were observed. There was however a 
tendency for a decreased IgG response in infants exposed to brodalumab in utero. Literature data suggest 
an increased risk of infections and evidence for infection was also found in the 6-month repeated dose 
study and possibly also in the case of a monkey infant that died from septicaemia likely of umbilical origin. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Brodalumab is an antibody; brodalumab is considered to be a non-hazardous, biodegradable product. As 
such, the environmental risk in terms of use and disposal is considered to be negligible, and in accordance 
with the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2, 1 June 2006), ERA studies are not required. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The proof of concept for brodalumab was demonstrated in a mouse model of skin inflammation by the use 
of surrogate antibodies against mouse IL-17RA. The inhibition of IL-17RA in this disease model resulted 
in inhibitory effects which are relevant for the indication. 
Data from the literature suggest an increased risk of infections, which was confirmed by some 
observations in the 6-month monkey study. On the other hand, no effect was observed on organs/tissues

of the immune system and on the T-cell dependent antibody response in adult monkeys. The risk of 
infections may therefore not be particularly high in adults. Because T-cell immunity is decreased during 
pregnancy, the risk of infections may be higher in neonates than in adults. 
It is not possible to draw a conclusion regarding a potential effect of brodalumab on suicidal behaviour 
based on non-clinical data. Literature data are diverse and its interpretation is hampered by the fact that 
it often concerns IL-17 inhibition, while brodalumab inhibits the receptor, and not the ligand. Because 
literature suggests that IgG antibodies can reach the brain, though in low amounts, and that the 
Th17/IL-17 axis can play a role in depression, it can only be concluded that some influence of brodalumab 
on behavioural processes cannot be completely excluded. 
Effects on skin were found in the monkey studies which were not limited to the sites of injection. In a local 
tolerance study in rabbits, moderate to severe oedema was observed at the clinical concentration of 140 
mg/ml brodalumab. Considering the indication for brodalumab, which is psoriasis, these findings could 
potentially be considered adverse. However, the events were of mild character and there was absence of 
effect on the wellbeing of the animals. Also, these were not observed in humans and in clinical studies, 
worsening of psoriasis due to brodalumab treatment was not observed. As such, this was not considered 
to be a major safety concern. 
Otherwise, brodalumab was tolerated well in the repeated dose studies. 
Carcinogenicity studies with brodalumab have not been conducted. However, there were no proliferative 
changes in cynomolgus monkeys administered weekly subcutaneous doses of brodalumab at 90 mg/kg 
for 6 months (AUC exposure 47-fold higher than in human patients receiving Kyntheum 210 mg every 2 
weeks). The mutagenic potential of brodalumab was not evaluated; however, monoclonal antibodies are 
not expected to alter DNA or chromosomes. 
It is unknown whether brodalumab passes the placenta.  For an antibody it seems unlikely that it will pass 
the placenta during the first trimester, but exceptions are possible, such as trastuzumab which appears to 
cross the placenta of cynomolgus monkeys also in early pregnancy. It is unknown whether this is the case 
for brodalumab, but significant placental passage occurred at the end of pregnancy in rabbits and 
monkeys. Therefore, a recommendation was added to the SmPC that women of childbearing potential 
should use an effective method of contraception during treatment and for at least 12 weeks after 
treatment. 
Only a very small amount of brodalumab was found in milk. However, as an IgG, brodalumab would be 
expected to be present in the first milk. As such, appropriate recommendations have been included in 
section 4.6 of the SmPC.

Six studies were primarily designed as clinical pharmacology studies subcategorized as healthy subject 
pharmacokinetics and initial tolerability, patient pharmacokinetics and initial tolerability, intrinsic, and 
extrinsic factor pharmacokinetics. Eight clinical studies in other study categories provided supportive data 
for the safety (including immunogenicity), pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic properties of 
brodalumab. These studies included three biopharmaceutics studies and five efficacy and safety studies 
(see Figure 1 and Table 6 and Table 7 above). 
Pharmacokinetics of brodalumab has been studied in healthy volunteers and patients with psoriasis. 
Non-compartmental PK analysis was conducted in the studies with intensive PK data and some with 
sparser PK data. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed to evaluate covariate factors and to 
evaluate concentration-effect relationships. This population PK model was essential to the program as 
brodalumab appeared to display non-linear elimination characteristics. 
Analytical assays 
A validated ELISA has been used to quantify unbound brodalumab in serum. The assay was validated 
according to current standards. Validation experiments investigated verification of assay range, inter- 
and intra-assay accuracy and precision, selectivity (matrix effect), specificity, stability, dilutional 
linearity, incurred sample re-analysis and robustness (e.g. incubation time, equipment and analyst) for all 
labs showed adequate performance and met the criteria of the relevant guidance. Accuracy and precision 
data for the bioanalytical assays that supported serum brodalumab concentration determinations showed 
that for the QC samples accuracy (%bias) was within the ranges of -12% to +5% and precision (%CV) 
was within the ranges of 3% to 19% for all clinical studies (all < 20%).

Development of antibodies against brodalumab was tested via a two-tiered strategy including a 
screening, confirmatory and neutralization assay in agreement with the Guideline on immunogenicity 
assessment of monoclonal antibodies intended for in vivo clinical use (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/86289/2010). 
The method was validated and cross-validated for the use at different laboratories. Drug tolerance of the 
anti-brodalumab assay was 100 μg/mL brodalumab and no interference of the immunoassay by SC 
brodalumab is to be expected. The bioassay for neutralising antibodies could tolerate 0.75 or 1.25 μg/mL 
of brodalumab in order to detect 2.5 μg/mL of antibodies. Mean brodalumab trough concentration for 210 
mg SC Q2W was 9-11 µg/ml in the phase 3 efficacy studies. Therefore, drug levels in the test samples will 
interfere with the detection of neutralising antibodies. Only samples with high concentration of 
neutralising antibodies can be detected and the presence of neutralising antibodies may be 
underestimated. 
Absorption 
Brodalumab absolute bioavailability was estimated to be approximately 54.7%. The estimate for ka in a 
typical individual was 0.33 day-1. The predicted median time to maximum brodalumab concentration was 
approximately 3 days, which is consistent with results from non-compartmental analyses. Absolute 
bioavailability was estimated using population PK modeling in the absence of SC and intravenous (IV) 
data using the same dose available from the same group of subjects.  
Bioequivalence/formulations 
Bioequivalence has been demonstrated between the PFS product used in Phase 3 for SC dosing of 210 mg 
with two injections (1.0 mL and 0.5 mL of 140 mg/ml brodalumab ) and the PFS product to be marketed 
with one (1.5 mL of 140 mg/ml) PFS injection. The reported analysis resulted in a treatment ratio [90% 
CI] of 0.89 [0.82-0.98], thus the single injection leads to less exposure as the average difference between 
both treatments of 11% was statistically significant (although this is usually not considered clinically 
relevant). 
Drug product manufacturing process (process 1 ATO versus process 2 ATO) was formally tested in the 
population PK modeling on drug bioavailability, drug clearance and absorption rate. No statistically 
significant effect was detected on any of these PK parameters at α = 0.01, and the maximum change in 
each of these model parameters was < 5%.  
Site of injection 
Site of SC injection has not been specifically investigated in the clinical program. In the method of 
administration, SC injection into the abdomen, thigh or upper arm is recommended. This is acceptable as 
the majority of brodalumab injections in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies with brodalumab were 
into the upper limb (around 50%) or abdomen (around 30%), although there was a small proportion of 
injections into the lower limb (around 10%). Site of injection was into the abdomen for most of the 
healthy volunteer studies. 
Distribution 
Plasma protein binding studies are not relevant for monoclonal antibodies since these are not known to 
bind non-specifically to plasma proteins. Based on population PK modeling, the estimated mean 
steady-state volume of distribution of brodalumab was approximately 7.24 L. 
Monoclonal antibodies are eliminated by a combination of catabolic processes, which have been found to 
act similarly across all monoclonal antibodies. Additionally, monoclonal antibodies may undergo 
Assessment report  
EMA/381484/2017 
Page 30/135 
 
 
 
 
target-mediated elimination, in which the drug-target complex is cleared (by internalization in the case of 
a receptor target) in proportion to target turnover rate and/or prevalence. 
Elimination 
Model-based simulations were used to predict the time after last steady state dose for brodalumab 
concentrations to drop below the quantification limit (BQL). The time for 50% of subjects to get to BQL is 
13 days and 26 days for the 140 and 210 mg doses. The time for 95% of subjects to get to BQL is 32 days 
and 63 days for the 140 and 210 mg doses. The estimated half-life of brodalumab was 10.9 days at 
steady-state after every other week subcutaneous dose of 210 mg. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Non-linear pharmacokinetics 
Following intravenous administration, the PK profiles showed bi-phasic disposition of brodalumab.  
Additionally, these profiles showed a clear dose-dependent change in the shape of the terminal phase, 
where higher doses resulted in slower brodalumab elimination. This is indicative of the presence of a 
saturable (or non-linear) component to brodalumab elimination. Upon subcutaneous administration in 
subjects within the same study and across studies, the bi-phasic disposition pattern seems to be masked 
by the prolonged absorption phase, but the dose-dependent change in the shape of the terminal phase 
was still apparent. As a consequence, brodalumab exposures increased in a more than dose-proportional 
manner. 
The non-linear portion of elimination was especially profound at lower doses, which has been described 
for numerous monoclonal antibodies and is assumed to be due to target binding (target-mediated 
disposition). Given the finite pool of the target IL-17 receptor, this elimination pathway becomes 
saturable, where the rate of uptake and elimination is a function of dose and the expression level of the 
target. These findings suggest the non-linear nature of brodalumab PK. 
Special populations 
Sex, age, race, and disease category (healthy vs. patient) did not affect exposure to brodalumab. 
Exposure to brodalumab decreases with increasing body weight and with increasing baseline PASI score. 
Renal impairment is not anticipated to impact the pharmacokinetic exposure to brodalumab. No renal 
excretion is anticipated due to the molecular size of brodalumab, and therefore no specific studies to 
measure excretion of brodalumab were conducted (Keizer et al, 2010). The relationship between renal 
function category (Lalonde et al, 2009; Guidance for Industry, 2010) and week 12 trough serum 
concentrations of brodalumab after steady-state administration of 140 and 210 mg Q2W week from 
studies 20120102, 20120103, and 20120104 for the different renal function categories was examined. At 
each dose level, there were no apparent differences in the median and distribution of brodalumab 
concentrations for the different renal function categories. 
As a monoclonal antibody, hepatic impairment is not expected to impact the pharmacokinetic exposure to 
brodalumab. The normal catabolic degradation of brodalumab to small peptides and individual amino 
acids is not expected to be impacted by hepatic impairment. 
The majority of subjects in the population PK data pool (approximately 90% of the analysis population) 
were white. Nevertheless, the relationship between different race groups and week 12 trough serum 
concentration of brodalumab after steady-state administration of 140 and 210 mg Q2W from Studies 
Assessment report

20120102, 20120103, and 20120104 was examined. At both dose levels, there was no apparent 
difference between trough brodalumab concentrations and white and other race groups. Furthermore, 
single dose pharmacokinetics was similar between white subjects (Study 20060279) and Japanese 
subjects (Study KHK-4827-001) for both healthy subjects and subjects with psoriasis as assessed by 
non-compartmental analysis. 
Body weight 
Body weight was a significant predictor of brodalumab clearance and volume parameters. Steady-state 
exposures appeared to be > 1.5-fold higher for lighter subjects (60 kg) or < 50% for heavier subjects 
(130 kg) as compared to exposures in a typical individual (weighing 80 kg). A boxplot presentation for 
various weight classes showed that for the 210 mg SC dose for the lowest weight class (39-72 kg) the 
box, containing the middle 50% of observations, is completely above the box for the highest weight group 
(107-234 kg) and the median exposure is a factor 5 higher, despite the overlap in the individual 
concentration range. The estimated clearance-BW exponent of 0.9 indicates (Wang et al., 2009, Fixed 
Dosing Versus Body Size–Based Dosing of Monoclonal Antibodies in Adult Clinical Trials) that body weight 
adjusted dosing would have been more appropriate for brodalumab in order to ensure comparable 
exposure in all weight groups. 
Population PK modeling 
For population PK modeling data from 7 studies have been used. The data set mainly consisted of white 
men in a wide age (18-76 yrs) and weight range (39-234 kg) and a mean psoriasis baseline PASI score of 
17. No PK data were available for subjects < 18 yrs and < 39 kg BW. Brodalumab pharmacokinetics, after 
single and/or multiple administrations through IV or SC routes in subjects with psoriasis (with and without 
psoriatic arthritis), was adequately described by a 2-compartmental pharmacokinetic model with linear 
and saturable elimination processes from the central compartment. All model parameters were estimated 
with acceptable precision. Study 20120103 was used for external validation. The absorption and 
disposition parameter estimates were consistent with findings from previous analyses of brodalumab 
pharmacokinetics and other monoclonal antibodies. 
The following intrinsic and extrinsic factors/covariates were considered for the population PK analyses: 
baseline demographic factors (sex, baseline age, race, and body weight), disease category indicators 
(healthy versus psoriasis versus psoriatic arthritis), disease severity (baseline PASI scores), and drug 
product manufacturing process (Process 1 ATO versus Process 2 ATO). Because anti-brodalumab 
antibody incidence was < 3% of the subject population, anti-brodalumab antibody status was not 
included as a covariate on the population pharmacokinetic model. No trends were observed to suggest 
reduction in pharmacokinetics due to the presence of binding anti-brodalumab antibodies. 
Variability 
Estimates of inter-individual variability (CV %) for (linear) clearance (CL), volume of distribution for 
central compartment (V1) and volume of distribution for peripheral compartment (V2) were 49.1%, 
13.3%, and 135%, respectively. Intra- and inter-subject variability in brodalumab exposure after SC 
administration appears to be high. Inter-subject variability after IV administration was notably less, thus 
the SC administration contributes to the variability. 
Throughout the studies there was a fraction of subjects with very low exposure as compared to group 
means, sometimes a factor 10, 50 or 200 lower, and there were also subjects with all concentration 
values below LLOQ. This did not only occur in the three pivotal phase 3 studies included in the popPK 
modeling, but also in smaller, more controlled phase 1 studies like 20130307, 20090480, KHK4827-001 
and 20110184 (only the last study [cohort 2]) was included in the popPK modeling dataset). According to 
the applicant, a combination of factors including high body weight, high baseline disease burden (PASI) 
Assessment report

Page 32/135 
 
 
 
 
and occasional missed doses, along with large unexplained variability in PK, may have combined to 
produce the observed low PK subjects.  
From a modelling perspective, the unexplained interindividual variability (IIV) of PK parameters as 
observed after accounting for all covariate effects (esp. weight) in the final model was very high. The 
prediction-corrected VPC plots for the first and the steady-state dosing in the population PK report 
showed that the 5th percentile line of observed concentrations was clearly below the lower predicted area 
of corresponding simulation-based percentiles, which means that there is a large fraction of unexpected 
low exposures, which may not have been completely captured by the model. Therefore, there remain 
some uncertainties with the population PK model and the model should be used with caution. 
Based on study 20120337, inter- and intra-subject variability on AUC were 108.9% and 56.3%, 
respectively, after repeated administration of two SC doses of brodalumab 140 mg in two periods.  
Overall, all PK studies showed high inter-subject variability on brodalumab exposure with CV values 
ranging from 50 to 100%, in line with the observed variability in the individual PK profiles. 
Antibodies 
Development of antibodies against brodalumab was measured throughout the clinical program. No signs 
of antibody formation were detected upon reviewing the pharmacokinetic data in general. No evidence of 
altered pharmacokinetic or safety profiles has been observed in subjects who tested positive for binding 
antibodies in phase 3 studies.  
Overall, < 2.6% of brodalumab-treated subjects with psoriasis in the efficacy and safety studies was 
positive for the development of binding anti-brodalumab antibodies. Of the ≥ 6300 subjects who received 
at least one dose of brodalumab in all the clinical studies, 2 subjects with neutralizing antibodies were 
detected. The probability to detect neutralizing antibodies (Nab) after a positive screening result was very 
low: ADA detection by the screening assay in the first step was very sensitive, but qualification as 
“neutralising“ ADA was less sensitive due to the much lower drug tolerance of the assay for measuring 
neutralizing capacity of anti-brodalumab antibodies. At the time of immunogenicity measurement (end of 
dose interval) about 2/3 of all Ctrough values at week 12 were > 2.5 µg/mL and thus higher than the drug 
tolerance of the Nab assay of 1.25 µg/ml. This means that only very strong Nab signals would have been 
detectable.  
As stated the risk of ADA formation is low 2.3% (107/4461). Moreover ADA formation seldom was 
persistent 0.45% (20/4461). However, this could not be related to a loss of efficacy or to hypersensitivity 
reactions. In several subjects a positive titre resulted in a dip in response on the PASI in other patients 
with a positive titre there was no effect on PASI score.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The formation of CYP450 enzymes can be altered by increased levels of certain cytokines (e.g. IL-1, IL-6, 
IL-10, TNFα, IFN) during chronic inflammation. Although a role for IL-17A and IL-17RA in the regulation 
of CYP450 enzymes has not been reported, the effect of brodalumab on CYP3A4/3A5 activity was 
evaluated in a disease-drug-drug interaction study. This study showed that in patients with moderate to 
severe plaque psoriasis, a single subcutaneous dose of 210 mg brodalumab increased the exposure to the 
Assessment report

CYP3A4/3A5 substrate midazolam by 24% (which means that midazolam clearance was decreased by 
24%).  
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
Because brodalumab is a monoclonal antibody, no in vitro permeability, in vitro metabolism, or in vitro 
metabolic drug-drug interaction studies that used human biomaterials were performed. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Pharmacodynamics relevant to this application was assessed in six studies across the brodalumab clinical 
program. The key elements of the pharmacodynamic biomarker program included measures of 
biochemical coverage in early phase 1 studies and analyses of molecular and cellular markers related to 
psoriasis or activity of brodalumab in subjects with psoriasis. 
Mechanism of action 
IL-17RA receptor occupancy was examined in studies 20060279 (psoriasis patients), 20070264 (patients 
with rheumatoid arthritis), and KHK 4827-001 (psoriasis patients). Receptor occupancy on circulating 
granulocytes, lymphocytes, and monocytes was consistently >80% across the studies, and increased in 
a dose-dependent manner. The results from the ex vivo whole blood stimulation (WBS) assay on 
EC50-shift after brodalumab administration support the dose-dependent inhibition of IL-17 receptor. This 
observation supports the hypothesis that brodalumab acts as a competitive inhibitor of IL-17 signaling.  
From the relationship between in vivo receptor occupancy versus (free) brodalumab plasma 
concentrations no value for Ki of brodalumab can be derived due to fact that occupancy < 80% occurs at 
concentrations which could not be detected in the PK assay. It can only be deduced that “Ki in vivo” is < 
0.05 µg/mL (LLOQ of the PK assay). However, this is well in line with the dissociation constant KD of 
brodalumab determined in vitro (0.24 nM ≈ 0.04 µg/mL).  
Competitive antagonism modeling of the WBS data estimated a range of WBS concentrations that 
produced 90% inhibition (IC90) from 2.75 to 15.4 μg/mL for brodalumab.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Effects on skin biomarkers 
Effects of brodalumab on skin biomarkers were examined in studies 20060279, 20090062 and 20120102. 
Molecular and histological analyses of skin biopsies in studies of subjects with psoriasis were conducted in 
Studies 20060279, Study 20090062, and molecular analyses were conducted in Study 20120102. 
In study 20060279, significant reductions (p < 0.05) in epidermal thickness and KRT16 mRNA were 
observed at Day 15 across all dose groups (140 or 350 mg SC, or 700 mg IV). Significant reductions in 
Ki67 expressing cell counts were observed in the highest dose groups. Among subjects who received 
higher doses of AMG 827 (700 mg IV and 350 mg SC), 15 of 16 subjects had decreases in each of the 
biomarker measurements. In the 140 mg SC group, only 1 of 4 subjects had notable reductions in skin 
biomarker measurements. 
In study 20090062, significant reductions (p < 0.05) in all epidermal thickness, CD3 expressing dermal 
cell count, and keratin-16 (KRT 16 were observed in the 140 and 210 mg Q2WK treatment groups at 12 
weeks. The reductions in biomarkers were dose-dependent, apart from the CD3 count. 
Assessment report  
EMA/381484/2017 
Page 34/135 
 
 
 
 
In the biopsy substudy of phase 3 study 20120102, the quantities of 5 inflammatory cytokine mRNAs in 
lesional biopsies were measured IL-17A, IL-17, IL-17F, IL-12B and IL-23A at baseline and week 12, 16, 
24 and 52. The quantity of IL17A, IL17C, and IL17F mRNA was each significantly decreased in lesional 
skin from subjects who received brodalumab 140 mg or 210 mg Q2W at week12 compared with lesional 
skin from placebo subjects (p ≤ 0.001 for all comparisons). Also the quantity of IL12B and IL23A mRNA 
was significantly decreased in lesional skin from brodalumab 140 mg (p = 0.002) or brodalumab 210 mg 
(p ≤ 0.001) at week12 compared to lesional skin from placebo subjects. 
Across the three pivotal studies, circulating c-reactive protein levels were reduced with brodalumab 
treatment.  
Brodalumab population PK/PD modelling 
A semi-mechanistic PK/PD model describing the relationship between serum brodalumab concentrations 
and PASI and sPGA response over time was developed. The time course of PASI and sPGA response was 
best modelled by a signalling compartment followed by modulation of psoriatic plaque turnover through 
inhibition of plaque formation rate modelled via an indirect response model, which is suitable and 
appropriate for this type of data. Modelling indicated a clear exposure-response relationship.  
Total body weight was found to be a statistically significant covariate on the psoriatic plaque removal rate 
constant (Kdeg) and on the concentration of half-maximal inhibition IC50. Thus, subjects with higher body 
weight had decreased Kdeg and increased IC50 – acting both to reduce predicted response and prolong 
time to steady-state response for heavier subjects (independent of dose selection). 
Modelling and simulation indicated superiority of response for 210 mg vs 140 mg for all weight groups by 
week 52. For subjects induced on 210 mg and then continuing on 210 mg vs. switching to 140 mg at week 
12 there is clear separation of doses for all weight groups, with increasing benefit for continued 210 mg 
treatment as weight increased. 
A clear positive relationship between brodalumab exposure (week 12 Ctrough) and efficacy outcome (sPGA 
0 and 0/1) was observed. Further analysis confirmed that, due to the BW-effect on exposure, also efficacy 
was clearly dependent on body weight continuously decreasing from light to heavy body weight. 
Simulations with the population PK/PD model showed that only 40% of the heavy patients (107-234 kg 
BW) are predicted to achieve sPGA 0 at week 52 of treatment with 210 mg SC (induction and 
maintenance), in comparison to 80% of the light patients (39-72 kg).  
A dose adjustment by weight ensuring that all patients reach an effective exposure leading to a similar 
response as in the < 83 kg body weight category was considered. Dose simulations were provided 
showing several different dosing regimens, with the 210 mg dose are predicted to give an exposure 
comparable to, or higher, than the predicted AUC for the weight categories below 83 kg with the tested 
regimen of 210 mg Q2W brodalumab. For patients above 120 kg, the likelihood of an adequate treatment 
response is decreased. However, the applicant predicted the exposure after different dosing scenarios for 
the two BW quintiles (93-107 kg) and (107-234 kg) and concluded that from an exposure and a patient 
compliance point of view, 210 mg three times per month might be the most appropriate dose for the 
group of high weight patients not meeting the response criteria of PASI 75.  
Based on an explorative, descriptive analysis, no relationship was observed between exposure and 
incidence of serious infections and infestations, candida infections, viral infections, and suicidal ideation 
and behaviour events. 
No formal studies of pharmacodynamic interactions have been conducted.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics of brodalumab has been studied in healthy volunteers and patients with psoriasis. 
The absorption and disposition parameter estimates are consistent with findings from other monoclonal 
antibodies. Bioequivalence has been demonstrated between the PFS product presentation used in Phase 
3 trials and the marketed prefilled autoinjector/pen. Drug product manufacturing process (process 1 ATO 
versus process 2 ATO) was formally tested in the population PK and it is concluded that there are no major 
differences in exposures between the SC drug product coming from ATO processes 1 and 2. 
Plasma protein binding studies are considered to be not relevant for mAbs. Results obtained from the 
population PK modelling indicate that brodlaumab suffers limited tissue penetration and distribution 
mainly in serum. 
Sex, age, race, and disease category (healthy vs. patient) did not affect exposure to brodalumab. This 
means that pharmacokinetics of brodalumab in healthy subjects and psoriasis patients are shown to be 
similar. 
Renal impairment is not anticipated to impact the pharmacokinetic exposure to brodalumab. No renal 
excretion is anticipated due to the molecular size of brodalumab, and therefore no specific studies to 
measure excretion of brodalumab were conducted which is considered acceptable by CHMP. 
As a monoclonal antibody, hepatic impairment is not expected to impact the pharmacokinetic exposure to 
brodalumab. The normal catabolic degradation of brodalumab to small peptides and individual amino 
acids is not expected to be impacted by hepatic impairment.                                  
Exposure to brodalumab decreases with increasing body weight and with increasing baseline PASI score.  
There is a concern that subjects in the higher body weight class may be under dosed. However, the CHMP 
decided that for the time being no dose adjustment is warranted in patients with higher body weight. In 
order to explore if a higher efficacy can be achieved with a higher dose and to establish the safety of a 
higher dose in the high-weight population a post-authorisation study will be conducted. The applicant will 
perform a post-authorisation clinical study to establish the optimal dose/dosing regimen in the high 
weight group of patients ensuring that all patients reach an effective exposure leading to the same 
response as in the < 83 kg body weight category. 
The risk of ADA formation is low and ADA formation seldom was persistent. ADA formation could not be 
directly related to loss of efficacy or to hypersensitivity reactions. In several subjects a positive titre 
resulted in a dip in response on the PASI and, in other patients with a positive titre there was no effect on 
PASI score. No firm conclusions can be drawn whether antibody formation, if occurring, does affect 
efficacy and safety. This information is appropriately reflected in the SmPC. 
The effect of brodalumab on CYP3A4/3A5 was evaluated in a drug-drug interaction study. Based on the 
magnitude of the change in exposure of midazolam (24% increase with a single subcutaneous dose of 210 
mg brodalumab), no dose adjustment of CYP3A4/3A5 substrates is necessary when administered 
concomitantly with brodalumab. This information is appropriately reflected in section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
The chosen skin biomarkers are established biomarkers in examining pharmacodynamics of drugs for the 
treatment of psoriasis. Although the analysed numbers are low, statistically significant effects of 
brodalumab on skin biomarkers were observed. A clear dose-response relationship was observed for 
epidermal thickness, Ki67 cell counts and keratin-16 expression. This applies also to the reductions in 
inflammatory cytokine expression. For CD3 cell counts, dose-response relationship was not shown. 
The PK/PD model is considered adequately developed and validated. Total body weight was found to be a 
statistically significant covariate on the psoriatic plaque removal rate constant (Kdeg) and on the

concentration of half-maximal inhibition IC50. In addition, modelling and simulation indicated superiority 
of response for 210 mg vs 140 mg for all weight groups by week 52. These observations were later 
confirmed in the pivotal efficacy studies. 
With some caution, due to the earlier mentioned remaining uncertainties around the population PK model, 
the model could be useful for the purpose of simulation of alternative doses and regimens. For instance, 
the model could be used for simulating scenarios of fixed dosing versus dosing on body weight. 
No formal studies of pharmacodynamic interactions have been conducted which was considered 
acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacological characterisation of brodalumab is considered adequate by the CHMP. The developed 
PK/PD model is considered useful for the purpose of simulation of alternative doses and regimens.   
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of brodalumab in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis has been investigated in one phase 2 
study (study 20090062) and three pivotal studies (studies 20120102, 20120103, 20120104). Data on 
maintenance of efficacy is also available from the open-label extensions of the three pivotal studies.  
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
Study 20090062 was a 22-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose study to 
evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of brodalumab in subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis.  
Study population 
Eligible subjects were men and women between 18 and 70 years of age who had moderate to severe 
plaque psoriasis (BSA ≥ 10% and PASI ≥ 12) at screening and baseline. Subjects were to have had stable 
disease for ≥ 6 months and to have either received ≥ 1 photo/systemic therapy or been a candidate to 
receive phototherapy or systemic psoriasis therapy in the opinion of the investigator. 
Treatments 
 
Placebo 
  Brodalumab 70 mg SC day 1 and wks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 
  Brodalumab 140 mg SC day 1 and wks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 
  Brodalumab 210 mg SC day 1 and wks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 
  Brodalumab 280 mg SC day 1 and wks 4 and 8 
The selection of doses for the study was based a) safety, b) pharmacokinetic modelling, and c) 
pharmacodynamic data from the single-dose first-in-human study in healthy volunteers (20060279).  
Study 20060279 explored the result of 3 levels of brodalumab serum concentrations: 
1.  Repeated but transient full engagement of IL-17RA (i.e. receptor occupancy [RO] approximately 
90%), with expected transient return to negligible drug levels between doses; 
2.  Sustained exposure with predicted mean trough concentrations targeting the whole blood stimulation 
(WBS) IC90 level as determined in an ex vivo functional assay using a competitive antagonism model; 
3.  Sustained exposure well above the IC90 level for the duration of the study. A fourth arm, which 
provided coverage over the 90% receptor occupancy (RO) level for the majority of an every 4-week

(Q4WK) dosing interval, explored whether less frequent dosing with expected transient return to 
negligible drug levels could maintain clinical effect in the setting of psoriasis. 
To maximize the likelihood of rapid skin clearing, a week 1 dose was added to quickly attain steady state 
concentrations for these doses. 
The no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) observed in the 3-month cynomolgus monkey toxicology 
study (90 mg/kg weekly SC) provided significant exposure multiples over the anticipated human 
exposures, and the preclinical toxicology data supported the proposed clinical study plan. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to establish a dose-response efficacy profile of brodalumab to identify an 
appropriate dose regimen for phase 3 studies. 
The secondary objectives were to evaluate the efficacy of brodalumab with regard to PASI, sPGA and BSA 
involvement; safety and PK of brodalumab.

With respect to PASI improvement, all adjusted p-values for brodalumab treatment compared with 
placebo were < 0.0001. Higher doses showed statistically significant higher percent improvement in PASI 
scores than the brodalumab 70 mg Q2WK group (p < 0.0001). The comparisons among brodalumab 280 
mg Q4WK, 140 and 210 mg Q2WK did not show statistically significant differences between these dose 
groups (p > 0.05). 
The PASI 50, 75, 90 and 100 responses at week 12 demonstrated statistically significant difference in 
comparison to placebo for each brodalumab treatment arm (p < 0.05; all p-values in the non-primary 
analyses are nominal and not adjusted for multiplicity. 
The p-values comparing each brodalumab treatment arm with placebo for a sPGA response of clear or 
almost clear (0 or 1) were all < 0.004. 
A subgroup analysis based of body weight was performed. Although the results should be interpreted with 
caution as subgroups were relative low in number of subjects, the overall trend was that response with 
respect to PASI and sPGA decreased with increasing body weight. The results in weight subgroups in 
percent PASI reduction, PASI 75, PASI 100 and sPGA success (0/1) are presented in Table 10.

Assessment report  
EMA/381484/2017 
Page 41/135 
 
 
 
 
 
Induction (12 weeks) 
Patients were assigned in a ratio of 1:1:1 to one of the following 3 treatment arms: 
  Brodalumab 140 mg SC (one 1 mL pre-filled syringe brodalumab + one 0.5 mL placebo) 
  Brodalumab 210 mg SC (one 1 mL + one 0.5 mL pre-filled syringe brodalumab) 
 
Placebo (one 1 mL + 0.5 mL pre-filled syringe placebo) 
All treatments were administered on day 1 and weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10. 
Withdrawal and re-treatment 
At week 12, patients with success on sPGA originally randomised to either one of the brodalumab arms 
were re-randomised to either continue on their brodalumab dose or placebo. All subjects originally 
randomised to placebo and patients not meeting the re-randomization criteria received 210 mg 
brodalumab. All patients received injections (1.0 mL + 0.5 mL syringe) at week 12, 13, 14 and then every 
other week. 
Return of disease (defined as an sPGA ≥ 3) at or after week 16 and through week 52 triggered 
retreatment. Retreatment started with the subject receiving 3 weekly doses of IP (2 injections each; one 
1.0 mL and one 0.5 mL): 
1.  For a subject re-randomised to continued brodalumab, these 3 weekly doses were brodalumab at 
the subject’s induction dose (week 1 and 3) and placebo (week 2). 
2.  For a subject re-randomised to placebo, all 3 of the weekly doses were brodalumab at his or her 
induction dose. 
3.  For  a  subject  who  was  originally  randomised  to  placebo,  these  3  weekly  doses  were  210  mg 
brodalumab (week 1 and 3) and placebo (week 2). 
After this, a subject received brodalumab at his or her originally randomised (induction) dose every other 
week (or 210 mg Q2W for subjects originally randomised to placebo). 
Rescue treatment 
Subjects could receive rescue treatment with 210 mg Q2W brodalumab according to the following rules: 
 
Through week 52, rescue treatment was available for a subject who had return of disease, 
subsequent retreatment with at least 12 weeks at his or her induction dose, and still has an 
inadequate response (persistent sPGAs of 2 over at least a 4-week period or a single sPGA ≥ 3).  
 
after week 52, rescue treatment was available for a subject who had return of disease or an 
inadequate response (persistent sPGAs of 2 over at least a 4-week period or a single sPGA ≥ 3). 
Objectives 
The primary study objective was to evaluate the efficacy of brodalumab (210 mg Q2W and 140 mg Q2W) 
in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, as compared to placebo; measured by the 
proportion of subjects who achieved success (clear [0] or almost clear [1]) on the static physician’s global 
assessment (sPGA) at week 12 and by the proportion of subjects who achieved 75% improvement in 
Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI;PASI 75) at week 12. 
Secondary objectives included evaluation of efficacy of the brodalumab treatment arms as compared to 
placebo in clearing psoriasis (sPGA, PASI 100); maintenance of efficacy with continued brodalumab 
treatment, effect of brodalumab on patient-reported symptoms; the short- and long-term safety of 
brodalumab 
Assessment report  
EMA/381484/2017 
Page 42/135 
 
 
 
 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Co-primary endpoint: PASI 75 and sPGA success (0/1 i.e. clear/almost clear) at week 12. 
Key secondary endpoints: PASI 100 at week 12, sPGA of 0 at week 12, sPGA success at week 52 (in 
re-randomised subjects), and PSI responder definition (total score ≤ 8, with no item score > 1) at week 
12. 
Other efficacy endpoints included NAPSI, Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (PSSI), Scalp Surface Area (SSA) 
involvement, DLQI, EQ-5D and SF-36. 
Sample size 
This study had co-primary endpoints (PASI 75 and sPGA success between brodalumab 210 mg and 
placebo, and between brodalumab 140 mg and placebo); therefore, the sample size estimation was based 
on all 4 comparisons. The study needed to achieve success on all co-primary endpoints at alpha = 0.05 
(2-sided level). No multiplicity adjustment was made for the co-primary endpoints. PASI 75 success rates 
at week 12 of 77% for the brodalumab 140 mg group, 82.5% for the brodalumab 210 mg group and 10% 
for the placebo group were assumed. For sPGA success, rates of 72% for the brodalumab 140 mg group, 
77% for the brodalumab 210 mg group and 10% for the placebo group were assumed. Using a 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel model stratified by total body weight group, 200 subjects per arm (N = 600 
total subjects) would provide > 90% power to detect a difference between either dose of brodalumab 
(210  mg or 140 mg) and the placebo treatment arms for both the sPGA and PASI 75 success rates. 
For the randomised withdrawal phase, it was assumed that 72% and 77% of subjects initially randomised 
to the 140 mg dose and the 210 mg dose of brodalumab were to be re-randomised at week 12. The sPGA 
success rate at week 52 for both of the brodalumab groups was assumed to be 65%, and 35% for the 
withdrawal group. Under these assumptions, the power to detect a difference between the proportion of 
responders at week 52 would be more than 90% for both doses of brodalumab, at alpha = 0.05 2-sided 
level. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomised at baseline to receive 210 mg brodalumab, 140 mg brodalumab, or placebo in 
a 1:1:1 ratio stratified by baseline total body weight (≤ 100 kg; > 100 kg), by prior biologic use (subjects 
with prior biologic use were capped at 50% of the study population), and by geographic region (defined 
by country for non-US countries and by geographic region in the US [US-West, US-Midwest, 
US-Northeast, US-South]). Subjects who were originally randomised to either of the brodalumab arms 
and who had an sPGA = 0 or 1 at the week-12 visit were re-randomised via IVRS at the week-12 visit to 
receive brodalumab at their originally randomised dose or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. 
Blinding (masking) 
The original randomization and the second randomization for the withdrawal phase remained blinded to 
all subjects, investigators, and the Amgen clinical study team until data through week 52 were finalized, 
at which time an unblinded analysis of all data through week 52 (including the co-primary endpoints) was 
performed. Throughout the study, subjects received placebo as needed to maintain the blind until it was 
broken. Placebo was presented in identical containers and was stored/packaged the same as brodalumab 
during the blinded portion of the study.

Statistical methods 
The efficacy analysis through week 52 was based on the randomised treatment assignment regardless of 
the actual treatment received during the study.  All primary, secondary, and exploratory efficacy 
endpoints up to week 12 were evaluated using the full analysis set. For endpoints evaluated after the 
re-randomization, the efficacy evaluable subset for the withdrawal phase (re-randomised subjects) 
analysis set was used. Subjects were analysed according to their re-randomised treatment arm. 
Based on results of simulations of previous datasets, which showed that multiple imputation performed 
better than LOCF and the mixed effects model, the company has chosen to use multiple imputation was 
used as the primary analysis method for handling missing continuous data. Last observation carried 
forward was performed as sensitivity analysis for the primary and key secondary endpoints. In multiple 
imputation, all post-baseline missing values for continuous efficacy endpoints were imputed separately 
resulting in 3 complete sets by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for each endpoint. The 
imputations were conducted based on all visits, simultaneously. Then the missing percent improvement 
of PASI score, the missing improvement of BSA, NAPSI score and Psoriasis Symptom Inventory total 
score were derived accordingly. The imputation models were stratified by the induction treatment group. 
For withdrawal phase endpoints through week 52, missing categorical variables were imputed as 
non-responders for binary endpoints and worst-cases for ordinal endpoints. Missing continuous variables 
were imputed by last observation carried forward (LOCF). Observed analysis was be used as sensitivity 
analysis. 
The analysis methods were dependent on whether the variable for the efficacy endpoint was continuous, 
dichotomous, or ordinal. The analysis methods and corresponding covariates included in the analysis 
model are summarized in Table 11.

Adjustment for multiple comparisons:  
In order to maintain the family-wise type-1 error rate at 5% 2-sided, a sequential testing approach will be 
followed. The co-primary endpoints, sPGA success and PASI 75, for the comparisons between brodalumab 
210 mg Q2W group and placebo will be tested simultaneously each at alpha = 0.05 level. If the null 
hypothesis for both of the co-primary endpoints is rejected, the hypotheses for the co-primary endpoints 
for the comparisons between brodalumab 140 mg Q2W group and placebo will be tested simultaneously. 
If either hypothesis is not rejected, all the subsequent hypotheses for key secondary endpoints will not be 
tested. If the hypotheses for co-primary endpoints are rejected, the hypotheses corresponding to the key 
secondary endpoints will be tested sequentially in the order listed above (see Figure 2 below).

This study was conducted at 73 centres in Europe (France, Germany, Poland, and Switzerland), Canada, 
and the United States (US). The study was initiated 29th of August 2012. Primary analysis data cut-off was 
12th of March 2014. 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol for the study was approved on 20 February 2012 and was amended three times till 
the data cut-off point. Most important amendment was the implementation of the Columbia-Suicide 
Severity Rating Scale, and Patient Health Questionnaire-8 depression scale assessments in March 2014 
after reports of suicidal behaviour and ideation occurred. 
Two changes in statistical analysis occurred. First amendment concerned exclusion of a patient from the 
per protocol analysis set. This was originally to be done if a patient missed >2 consecutive doses of active 
IP. However in the analysis the definition was 2 or more. The second amendment concerned a change in 
study visit window on study week 52 and 53.

Co-primary endpoint (adjusted p-values presented) 
Brodalumab 210 mg and 140 mg Q2W demonstrated superior efficacy (p<0.001) to placebo in PASI 75 
responders, sPGA success at week 12.  
The results in the per-protocol group analysis were consistent with the full analysis set, and sensitivity 
analyses (as observed i.e. no imputation and LOCF) were consistent with the primary analysis (NR 
imputation). 
Key secondary endpoints 
Brodalumab 140 mg QW2 and 210 mg Q2W demonstrated superior efficacy (p<0.001) to placebo in 
complete clearance of lesions as measure by PASI 100 responders and sPGA 0 responders at week 12.  
Both brodalumab strengths were also superior to placebo with respect to the patient reported outcome 
scale PSI responders (p<0.001). 
The results in the per-protocol group analysis were consistent with the full analysis set, and sensitivity 
analyses (as observed i.e. no imputation and LOCF) were consistent with the primary analysis (NR 
imputation).

Other secondary endpoints 
Both brodalumab doses demonstrated superiority to placebo in NAPSI score at week 12 (nominal p 
<0.001). The same applies to improvement at week 12 in PSSI score and SSA score, as well as the 
percentage of subjects who had a ≥ 5 point improvement at week 12 in DLQI score.  
Maintenance of effect 
Maintenance of effect was measured by the proportion of subjects with sPGA success at week 52 2. As the 
analysis of the withdrawal endpoint of sPGA success at week 52 was limited to subjects who achieved 
success at week 12, estimates of the maintenance effect with continued brodalumab treatment should be 
interpreted within the context of a subject having already responded to treatment with brodalumab. 
Among subjects originally randomised to 210 mg Q2W in the induction phase, no subject re-randomised 
to placebo and withdrawn from brodalumab treatment maintained sPGA success at week 52, while 83.1% 
of subjects re-randomised to continued treatment with 210 mg Q2W maintained sPGA success at week 
52. Among subjects who were originally randomised to 140 mg Q2W in the induction phase and 
re-randomised to placebo, 5.1% maintained sPGA success at week 52. In contrast, 70.2% of subjects 
who were re-randomised to continued treatment with 140 mg Q2W in the withdrawal phase maintained 
sPGA success at week 52. 
Patients who were re-treated after inadequate response during the withdrawal phase started responding 
to treatment within 2 weeks. The Kaplan Meier estimates of median time to sPGA success in subjects 
re-randomised to placebo and re-treated with brodalumab were 6.14 days (95% CI 5.71 – 6.43) in the 
140 mg Q2W group and 4.29 days (95% CI 2.29 – 4.14) in the 210 mg Q2W group. 
The Kaplan Meier estimates of median time to PASI 75 response in subjects re-randomised to placebo and 
re-treated with brodalumab were 3.7 days (95% CI 2.14 – 4.14) in the 140 mg Q2W group and 4.14 days 
(95% CI 4.14 – 6.14) in the 210 mg Q2W group. 
Figure 3 presents the Kaplan-Meyer estimates of time to first loss of sPGA ≤2 response. Two weeks after 
re-randomization to placebo, 69.5% and 88.1% remained sPGA success responders in the initial 
brodalumab 140 mg Q2W group and 210 mg Q2W group, respectively.  
Two weeks after the re-randomization to placebo, 79.6% and 94.0% were PASI 75 responders in the 
initial brodalumab 140 mg Q2W group and 210 mg Q2W group, respectively.

Ancillary analyses 
657 patients were tested for anti-Brodalumab antibodies. Out of 645 treated patients 4 (0.6%) were 
tested positive for pre-existing binding antibodies. 14 Patients (2.2%) developed binding 
anti-Brodalumab antibodies following Brodalumab administration. Neutralizing anti-Brodalumab 
antibodies were not detected in any subject in the study. 
A Phase 3 Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Induction and Maintenance Regimens 
of Brodalumab Compared With Placebo and Ustekinumab in Subjects with Moderate to Severe 
Plaque Psoriasis: AMAGINE-2 (Study 20120103) 
Methods 
Study Participants  
The eligibility criteria were mainly the same as for study 20090062: 
Eligible subjects were men and women who were ≥ 18 and ≤ 75 years of age at the time of screening with 
stable, moderate to severe plaque psoriasis diagnosed ≥ 6 months before first dose of investigational 
product, involved body surface area (BSA) ≥  10%, PASI ≥  12, and sPGA ≥  3 at screening and at 
baseline. Subjects must have completed appropriate washout periods for drugs and must have been free 
of infections requiring systemic anti-infectives and of significant concurrent medical conditions. If 
applicable, women must have been willing to use highly effective birth control. 
But there were some additions: 
-  Subject has used topical therapy as follows: 
  Super-potent or potent topical steroids or topical anthralin/Dithranol within 28 days 
before first dose of IP 
  Any other formulation or potency of topical therapy within 14 days before first dose of IP 
(exception: upper mid-strength or lower potency topical steroids permitted on the face, 
axillae, and groin; bland emollients [without urea or alpha or beta hydroxy acids]; 
shampoo without steroids). 
-  Subject has received live vaccine(s) within 28 days of the first dose of IP (or longer, according to 
local requirements for ustekinumab [e.g., 1 year in the United States for BCG vaccination]). 
-  Subject has used ustekinumab and/or anti-IL-17 biologic therapy ever or other experimental or 
commercially available biologic immune modulator(s) within 12 weeks prior to the first IP dose. 
- 
For women (except if surgically sterile or at least 2 years postmenopausal, with postmenopausal 
status confirmed by FSH in the postmenopausal range): not willing to use highly effective 
methods of birth control during treatment and for 15 weeks after the last dose (if discontinuing 
before week 52) or for 8 weeks after the last dose (if discontinuing at or after week 52). 
- 
For women: pregnant or breast feeding, or planning to become pregnant while enrolled in the 
study and for 15 weeks after the last dose (if discontinuing before week 52) or for 8 weeks after 
the last dose (if discontinuing at or after week 52).

Treatments 
Amgen investigational product:  
Brodalumab and/or matching placebo were administered as 2 blinded subcutaneous (SC) injections (one 
1.0-mL [140 mg] and one 0.5-mL [70 mg]) Q2W starting on day 1, with additional doses at week 1 and 
week 13. In addition, to maintain the blind to rescue treatment, Amgen investigational product 
(Brodalumab and/or placebo) was also administered at week 17. Amgen investigational product was 
administered as a SC injection to the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm. 
Non-Amgen investigational product:  
Ustekinumab or matching placebo were administered as 1 or 2 blinded SC injections (0.5 mL [45 mg]) at 
day 1 and weeks 4, 16, 28, and 40, depending on subject weight at the baseline visit (1 injection if ≤100 
kg and 2 injections if > 100 kg). For subjects who received 2 injections of non-Amgen IP per dose, the 2 
injections were to be administered in different body regions (upper arms, gluteal regions, thighs, or 
abdomen). 
Induction 
After the screening period, subjects entered a 12-week, double-blind, active comparator and 
placebo-controlled induction phase where they were randomised in a 2:2:1:1 ratio to 1 of the following 
treatment groups: Brodalumab 210 mg Q2W, Brodalumab 140 mg Q2W, ustekinumab (45 mg if ≤  100 kg 
at the baseline visit, 90 mg if > 100 kg at the baseline visit) or placebo. Randomization was stratified by 
baseline total body weight (≤  100 kg; > 100 kg), by prior biologic use, and by geographic region. 
All subjects received 2 injections of Amgen IP at day 1 and weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. These injections 
were Brodalumab and/or placebo for Brodalumab, depending upon randomised arm. 
All subjects also received non-Amgen IP at day 1 and week 4. These injections were ustekinumab or 
placebo for ustekinumab, depending upon randomised arm. Subjects ≤ 100 kg at the baseline visit 
received one 0.5 ml injection of non-Amgen IP at day 1 and week 4 while subjects > 100 kg at the 
baseline visit received two 0.5 ml injections of non-Amgen IP at day 1 and week 4. 
At week 12 visit subjects originally randomised to either Brodalumab groups were rerandomised 
(2:2:2:1) into the maintenance phase to receive Brodalumab 210 mg Q2W, 140 mg Q2W, 140 mg every 
4 weeks (Q4W), or 140 mg every 8 weeks (Q8W). 
Rerandomization was stratified by total body weight, original induction regimen and week-12 response 
(sPGA 0 vs sPGA ≥1). 
Subjects originally randomised to ustekinumab continued to receive ustekinumab while subjects who 
received placebo were switched to Brodalumab 210 mg Q2W. 
Maintenance 
All subjects continued to receive Amgen and non-Amgen IP (2 injections of Amgen IP at weeks 12, 13, 14, 
16, 17, 18 and every 2 weeks, non-Amgen IP [1 injection for subjects ≤  100 kg at the baseline visit, 2 
injections for subjects > 100 kg at the baseline visit] at weeks 16, 28, and 40. 
Subjects with inadequate response (defined as a single sPGA of ≥ 3 or persistent sPGA values of 2 over ≥ 
a 4-week period) may have qualified for rescue treatment at or after week 16.  
Rescue treatment was with Brodalumab 210 mg for all subjects, including those on ustekinumab at week 
16. After week 16 and through week 52, subjects on Brodalumab rescued with Brodalumab 210 mg Q2W 
and subjects on ustekinumab rescued with ustekinumab. Rescue treatment was blinded. At week 52, 
Assessment report

subjects who were on Brodalumab continued to receive Brodalumab at their maintenance or rescue phase 
dose; subjects who were originally randomised to ustekinumab received Brodalumab 210 mg Q2W. 
Long-term Extension 
• 
All subjects received Amgen IP (Amgen IP at weeks 52, 53, 54, and every 2 weeks). Until the 
blind was broken, these were 2 injections. After the blind was broken, subjects received 1 
injection if receiving 140 mg or 2 injections if receiving 210 mg. 
Objectives 
Primary 
Compared with placebo: 
 
to evaluate the efficacy of Brodalumab (210 mg every 2 weeks [Q2W]; and 140 mg Q2W) in 
subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, as measured by the proportion of subjects 
achieving 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI; PASI 75) at week 12 and  
the proportion of subjects achieving success (clear [0] or almost clear[1]) on the static 
Physician´s Global assessment (sPGA) at week 12. 
Compared with ustekinumab: 
 
to evaluate the efficacy of Brodalumab (210 mg Q2W; and 140 mg Q2W for subjects ≤  100 kg 
and 210 mg Q2W for subjects > 100 kg) in clearing psoriasis in subjects with moderate to severe 
plaque psoriasis, as measured by the proportion of subjects achieving PASI 100 at week 12.

Sample size 
Sample size calculations for studies 2012103 and 2012104 (see below) were identical. Both studies had 
two families of null hypotheses (Brodalumab vs placebo and Brodalumab vs ustekinumab).  The two 
families of null hypotheses were to be tested in parallel at alpha = 0.01 (2-sided) and 0.04 (2-sided) for 
the Brodalumab vs placebo and the Brodalumab vs ustekinumab families, respectively.  
The following assumptions regarding success- / response rates were made for sample size calculation:

It was calculated that for a logistic regression model adjusted by total body weight group, with alpha = 
0.01 (2-sided), the sample sizes of 600 subjects in the 210 mg Q2W Brodalumab group, 600 subjects in 
the 140 mg Q2W Brodalumab group, and 300 subjects in the placebo group, provide more than 90% 
power to detect the difference in all the comparisons within the placebo family of co-primary and key 
secondary endpoints (for a definition of the hypothesis families refer to section ‘statistical methods’). 
Similarly, a logistic regression model adjusted by total body weight group, with alpha = 0.04 (2-sided), a 
total of 600 subjects in the 210 mg Q2W Brodalumab group, 600 subjects in the 140 mg Q2W Brodalumab 
group, and 300 subjects in the ustekinumab group would provide at least 90% power to detect the 
difference in all the PASI 100 comparisons within the ustekinumab family of primary and key secondary 
endpoints.  
For the maintenance phase it was assumed that 1152 subjects (of the 1200 subjects initially randomised 
to either Brodalumab arm at baseline) were eligible for re-randomization at week 12. The following 
success rates at week 52 were anticipated: 70% (210 mg Q2W Brodalumab), 55%(140 mg Q2W 
Brodalumab), 40% (140 mg Q4W Brodalumab) and 25%(140 mg Q8W Brodalumab). Under these 
assumptions, the power to detect a difference between the proportion of responders between 210 mg 
Q2W vs 140 mg Q8W, 140 mg Q2W vs 140 mg Q8W, 210 Q2W vs 140 mg Q4W, 140 mg Q2W vs 140 mg 
Q4W, and 210 mg Q2W vs 140 mg Q2W treatment groups at week 52 was calculated to be more than 
90%, at alpha = 0.05 (2-sided) 
Randomisation 
In studies 20120103 and 20120104 (see below) subjects were randomised at baseline to receive 210 mg 
Brodalumab, 140 mg Brodalumab, ustekinumab, or placebo in a 2:2:1:1 ratio. Randomization used 
permuted blocks within each stratum (same as mentioned above). Subjects with prior use of biologics 
were to be capped at no more than 50% of the global study population. 
Subjects who were originally randomised to either Brodalumab arm were to be pooled and then 
re-randomised at week 12 to receive 210 mg Q2W Brodalumab, 140 mg Q2W Brodalumab, 140 mg Q4W 
Brodalumab, or 140 mg Q8W Brodalumab in a 2:2:2:1 ratio, again using permuted blocks within each 
stratum (total body weight, week 12 sPGA response and the subject’s original randomised treatment 
group). 
Blinding (masking) 
Studies 20130103 and 20120104 (see below) were performed as double-blind, double-dummy studies. 
The blind was maintained until all subjects reached week 52 or terminated the study, whichever came 
first. Placebo was presented in identical containers and was stored and packaged the same as the 
respective investigational products. Until the blind was broken, subjects received placebo for Brodalumab 
and/or ustekinumab as needed to maintain the blind.  
Rescue treatment remained blinded until the study was unblinded (i.e. subjects continued to received 
blinded Brodalumab and  ustekinumab per dosing schedule of the maintenance phase, with 
administration of placebo as necessary to maintain the blind).

Statistical methods 
In studies 20120103 and 20120104 (see below) treatment comparisons for binary endpoints were done 
by means of Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) tests. The analyses were generally stratified by baseline 
total body weight (≤  100 kg, > 100 kg), prior biologic use, and geographic region. For PASI 75 response, 
baseline PASI (≤  median, > median) was an additional stratification factor. Baseline sPGA (3, 4, 5) was 
an additional stratification factor for sPGA. Continuous data were analysed by means of ANCOVA models 
applying the above mentioned stratification factors and – where appropriate - including baseline as a 
covariate. For all analyses through week 12, missing data for dichotomous endpoints were imputed as 
non-responders while missing continuous data were imputed by multiple imputation. Sensitivity analyses 
included as-observed and last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation. 
In all studies the primary efficacy analysis as well as the secondary analyses regarding the induction 
phase were done on the FAS (including all randomised patients and patients treated as randomised). 
In studies 2012103 and 2012104 there were two families of primary hypotheses . The first set of primary 
hypotheses (placebo family) was that Brodalumab at 210 mg Q2W and 140 mg Q2W would demonstrate 
superior efficacy over placebo with regard to sPGA success and PASI 75 response at week 12. The second 
set of primary hypotheses (ustekinumab family) was that Brodalumab (at the 210 mg dosage and at the 
140 mg dosage for subjects ≤  100 kg with 210 mg dosage for subjects > 100 kg) would demonstrate 
superior ability to clear psoriasis compared with ustekinumab regarding PASI 100 response at week 12. 
To control the type 1 error alpha was split between both families:  alpha = 0.01 (2-sided) was allocated 
to the placebo family and alpha = 0.04 (2-sided) was allocated to the ustekinumab family.  
To maintain the type I error of 0.01 for the placebo family a sequential testing strategy was applied (the 
procedure had to stop in case of a p-value > 0.01): In step 1 the superiority of Brodalumab 210 mg over 
placebo with regard to PASI 75 response and sPGA success (both at week 12) had to be shown. Only if this 
condition was fulfilled the superiority of Brodalumab 140 mg over placebo for PASI 75 response and for 
sPGA success (both at week 12) was tested. Only in case of a significant result for both primary endpoints 
the key secondary endpoints were to be tested in hierarchical order: PASI100 at week 12 (210 mg vs. 
placebo), sPGA of 0 at week 12 (210 mg vs. placebo), PASI100 at week 12 (140 mg vs. placebo), sPGA 
of 0 at week 12 (140 mg vs. placebo), PSI response at week 12 (210 mg v. placebo) and PSI response at 
week 12 (140 mg v. placebo). 
To maintain the type I error for the ustekinumab family a sequential testing procedure was applied (the 
procedure had to stop in case of a p-value > 0.04): in step 1 for PASI 75 response as well as for sPGA 
success (both at week 12) superiority of Brodalumab 210 mg over placebo had to be shown. In step 2 
superiority of weight adjusted Brodalumab over placebo with regard to both endpoints had to be shown. 
The key secondary endpoints were then to be tested in the following order: PASI100 at week 12 (140 mg 
vs. ustekinumab), PASI75 at week 12 (210 mg vs. ustekinumab) and PASI75 at week 12 (weight adjusted 
Brodalumab vs. ustekinumab). 
For maintenance treatment it was hypothesized that subjects who continued to receive Brodalumab 210 
mg Q2W or 140 mg Q2W would demonstrate superior sPGA success at week 52 compared to those 
randomised to receive Brodalumab at lower frequencies in the maintenance phase (140 mg Q4W and 140 
mg Q8W). After re-randomization at week 12, the maintenance phase endpoint was tested at full alpha = 
0.05.

Recruitment 
The first subject was enrolled on 22 August 2012. 
Primary analysis data cut-off date was the 22 September 2014. 
The total duration of treatment including the induction, maintenance and long-term extension was 
planned to be 266 weeks 
Conduct of the study 
Changes in Statistical Methods: 
The SAR was amended to provide details of statistical analysis outlined in Protocol Amendments 2 and 3. 
Analyses were performed as described in the final SAR approved 07 October 2014. 
Protocol Deviations: 
Important protocol deviations were reported for 122 of 1831 subjects (6.7%) during the induction phase. 
Important protocol deviations were reported at similar rates across treatment groups (range of 5.6% to 
6.5%), with the exception of the ustekinumab group (9.7%). Overall, “efficacy assessments conducted 
by non-certified assessors” was the most commonly reported important protocol deviation during this 
phase (2.3%). 
Between weeks 12 and 52, important protocol deviations were reported for 145 of 1760 subjects (8.2%). 
Deviations were more common in the Brodalumab 140 mg Q8W group (14.3%) compared with the other 
treatment groups (range of 6.1% to 9.3%). Differences were primarily driven by a higher incidence of the 
following deviations, which each occurred in 3.6% of subjects in this treatment group: “subject dosed 
with compromised investigational product,” “treatment received is different from assigned,” and “rescue 
sPGA incorrect.” 
An  IVRS  programming  error  was  identified  that  affected  treatment  assignments  at  week  17  for  33 
ustekinumab subjects who rescued at week 16 with Brodalumab 210 mg. Because of the error, these

subjects received a placebo loading dose at week 17 instead of Brodalumab 210 mg as specified in the 
protocol. 
No subject data were excluded from the Full Analysis Set because of protocol deviations. 
Baseline data 
A total of 1831 subjects were enrolled in the study, of which 1258(68.7%) were men and the mean age 
was 44.6 (18to 76) years. 1652 were White (90.2%), 68 were Asian (3.7%), 53 were Black (2.9%) and 
58 others (3.1%).

Outcomes and estimation 
Induction Endpoints at Week 12 
Co-primary Endpoints- Compared with placebo: 
 
PASI 75 at week 12 
The differences in response rates from the placebo group for both the 210 mg Q2W and 140 mg Q2W 
groups were statistically significant based on the adjusted p-values (p < 0.001). The percentage of PASI 
75 responders at week 12 was 86.3% in the 210 mg Q2W group, 66.6% in the 140 mg Q2W group, and 
8.1% in the placebo group. The results at week 12 in the Per-protocol Analysis Set were consistent with 
those observed using the Full Analysis Set. 
 
sPGA Success 8= or 1) at week 12 
The differences in response rates from the placebo group for both the 210 mg Q2W and 140 mg Q2W 
groups were statistically significant based on the adjusted p-values (p < 0.001). The percentage of 
subjects who achieved sPGA success at week 12 was 78.6% in the 210 mg Q2W group, 58.0% in the 140 
mg Q2W group, and 3.9% in the placebo group. The results at week 12 in the Per-protocol Analysis Set 
were consistent with those observed using the Full Analysis Set. 
Analysis results of the co-primary and key secondary endpoints at week 12 are summarized below. 
Key secondary endpoints- compared to placebo 
 
PASI 100 at week 12 
The differences in response rates from the placebo group for the 210 mg Q2W and 140 mg Q2W groups 
were statistically significant based on the adjusted p-values (p < 0.001). The percentage of PASI 100 
responders at week 12 was 44.4% in the 210 mg Q2W group, 25.7% in the 140 mg Q2W group, and 0.6% 
in the placebo group. 
 
sPGA 0 (Clear) at week 12 
The differences in response rates from the placebo group for the 210 mg Q2W and 140 mg Q2W groups 
were statistically significant based on the adjusted p-values (p < 0.001). The percentage of sPGA 0 
responders at week 12 was 44.8% in the 210 mg Q2W group, 25.7% in the 140 mg Q2W group, and 0.6% 
in the placebo group. 
 
PSI Responder at week 12 
The percentage of PSI responders at week 12 was 67.6% in the 210 mg Q2W group, 51.5% in the 140 mg 
Q2W group, and 6.8% in the placebo group. These differences were statistically significant based on the 
adjusted p-value (p<0.001).

Table 19: Analysis results of the co-primary and key secondary endpoints at week 12 
Comparisons with placebo yielded statistically significant results in favour of Brodalumab 210 mg Q2W 
and 140 mg Q2W for both co-primary endpoints and the key secondary endpoints (adjusted p < 0.001). 
Primary Endpoints- Compared with ustekinumab: 
The difference in response rate from the ustekinumab group for the 210 mg Q2W group was statistically 
significant based on the adjusted p-value (p < 0.001). The percentage of PASI 100 responders at week 12 
was 44.4% in the 210 mg Q2W group and 21.7% in the ustekinumab group. 
The difference in response rate from the ustekinumab group for the weight-based Brodalumab subgroup 
(140 mg Q2W for subjects ≤  100 kg and 210 mg Q2W for subjects > 100 kg) was statistically significant 
based on the adjusted p-value (p < 0.001). The percentage of PASI 100 responders at week 12 was 
33.6% in the weight-based Brodalumab group and 21.7% in the ustekinumab group. 
Comparisons with ustekinumab yielded statistically significant results in favour of Brodalumab 210 mg 
Q2W and the weight-based group for the primary endpoint.  
Results of the first key secondary endpoint, PASI 100 at week 12 (140 mg Q2W vs ustekinumab; p = 
0.078), were not statistically significant, and therefore subsequent endpoints were not formally tested as 
a consequence of the sequential testing procedure.  
Therefore, statistical significance was not demonstrated for differences in PASI 75 at week 12 for the 
Brodalumab 210 mg Q2W and Brodalumab weight-based groups compared with ustekinumab, though the 
response rates for PASI 75 in the Brodalumab 210 mg Q2W and Brodalumab weight-based groups were 
both nominally significantly greater compared with ustekinumab.  
Results of the co-primary and key secondary endpoints at week 12 are presented below. 
Key Secondary Endpoints – Compared to ustekinumab 
 
PASI 100 at Week 12 (Brodalumab 140 mg Q2W vs Ustekinumab) 
The percentage of PASI 100 responders at week 12 was 25.7% in the 140 mg Q2W group and 21.7% in 
the ustekinumab group. This difference in response was not statistically significant based on the adjusted 
p-value (p=0.078).

 
PASI 75 at Week 12 in (Brodalumab 210 mg Q2W and Weight-based vs Ustekinumab) 
Based on the sequential testing procedure, all subsequent endpoints were not rejected regardless of their 
nominal significance, for the reason the previously tested endpoint did not reach statistical significance. 
The nominal p-value for the difference in response rate from the ustekinumab group for the 210 mg Q2W 
was <0.001, but was not statistically significant based on the adjusted p-value (p = 0.078). The 
percentage of PASI 75 responders at week 12 was 86.3% in the 210 mg Q2W group and 70.0% in the 
ustekinumab group.  
Similarly, the difference in response rate from the ustekinumab group for the weight-based Brodalumab 
group was not statistically 
significant.
Maintenance Endpoint at Week 52: 
 
sPGA Success (0 or 1) at Week 52 
The maintenance of effect was measured by the proportion of subjects with sPGA success at week 52 
among subjects rerandomised to 1 of 4 maintenance arms of Brodalumab at week 12. Subjects with an 
inadequate response who qualified for rescue on or after week 16 were imputed as non-responders at the 
time of inadequate response. This non-responder imputation applied to all rerandomised subjects. 
62.6% in subjects rerandomised to Brodalumab 210 mg Q2W, 42.7% in subjects rerandomised to 140 mg 
Q2W, 9.0% in subjects rerandomised to 140 mg Q4W, and 4.8% in subjects rerandomised to 140 mg 
Q8W achieved sPGA success at week 52.  
All planned comparisons between the Brodalumab groups yielded statistically significant results in favour 
of the higher dose and more frequent dosing regimen (adjusted p-values of < 0.001) with the 210 mg 
Q2W group achieving the highest rates of sPGA success at week 52. 
Assessment report  
EMA/381484/2017 
Page 65/135 
 
 
 
 
 
For subjects who received Brodalumab 210 mg Q2W in the induction phase, sPGA success (0/1) was 
achieved by 64.9% in subjects who continued 210 mg Q2W, 47.3% in subjects rerandomised to 140 mg 
Q2W, 8.9% in subjects rerandomised to 140 mg Q4W, and 1.2% in subjects rerandomised to 140 mg 
Q8W. 
The percentage of subjects from the 140 mg Q2W group in the induction phase who achieved sPGA 
success at week 52 were 60.2% in subjects rerandomised to 210 mg Q2W, 38.1% in subjects who 
continued to receive 140 mg Q2W, 9.0% in subjects rerandomised to 140 mg Q4W, and 8.4% in subjects 
rerandomised to 140 mg Q8W. 
Using Non-Responder Imputation after a protocol-specified treatment change after experiencing an 
inadequate response, the percentage of subject who achieved sPGA success (0 or 1) at week 52 was 
74.4% for subjects who received Brodalumab 210 mg Q2W during induction and maintenance and 74.7% 
for subjects who received Brodalumab 140 mg Q2W during induction and 210 mg Q2W during 
maintenance. 
For subjects who received placebo in the induction phase and were switched to Brodalumab 210 mg Q2W, 
215 of 248 (86.7%) still on study at week 52 achieved sPGA success (0/1). 
Among subjects who remained on ustekinumab during induction and maintenance, 50.9% achieved sPGA 
success at week 52. 
Onset of response: 
Summary of PASI 75 during the induction phase shows that Brodalumab has a rapid onset of efficacy. At 
week 4 PASI 75 was achieved by 61.4% in the 210 mg and 47.3% in the 140 mg Brodalumab group and 
19% in the ustekinumab group.  
Assessment report  
EMA/381484/2017

For PASI 90 the response rates at week 4 were 29.7% (Brodalumab 210mg Q2W), 23.1% (Brodalumab 
140 mg Q2W), 4.7% (ustekinumab) and 0.3% (placebo). At week 8 the response rates were 61.8% (210 
mg), 44.1% (140 mg), 31.0% (ustekinumab) and 1.9% (placebo). 
For PASI 100 the response rate at week 4 was 9.2% for 210 mg Brodalumab Q2W, 9.9% for 140 mg 
Brodalumab Q2W and 0.8% for ustekinumab. At week 8 the rates were already 35.4% for 210 mg 
Brodalumab Q2W, 23.1% for 140 mg Brodalumab Q2W and 11.4 % for ustekinumab.

Key findings from other endpoints: 
  DLQI 
Among subjects with a DLQI ≥  5 at baseline, the percentage of subjects who had a ≥  5 point 
improvement at week 12 was 88.4% for the 210 mg Q2W group, 77.1% for the 140 mg Q2W group, 
82.8% for the ustekinumab group, and 29.5% for the placebo group. For the weight-based Brodalumab 
group, 83.5% had a ≥  5 point improvement at week 12. At week 12, the percentage of subjects who 
achieved a DLQI score of 0 or 1 was 60.8% for the Brodalumab 210 mg Q2W group, 46.6% for the 
Brodalumab 140 mg Q2W group, 44.3% for the ustekinumab group, and 4.5% for the placebo group. 
  NAPSI 
At week 12, among subjects with nail involvement at baseline, the mean improvement from baseline in 
NAPSI score at week 12 was 4.4 in the Brodalumab 210 mg Q2W group, 3.3 in the 140 mg Q2W, and 1.3 
in the placebo group. At week 52, among subjects with nail involvement at baseline, the mean 
improvement from baseline in NAPSI score at week 52 in rerandomised subjects was 7.8 for the 
Brodalumab 210 mg Q2W group, 8.8 for the 140 mg Q2W group, 6.7 for the 140 mg Q4W group, and 4.7 
for the 140 mg Q8W group. 
Subgroup Efficacy Analysis 
Response rates in Brodalumab subjects for sPGA (0 or 1), PASI 75, and PASI 100 at week 12 were similar 
across subgroups of subjects who did or did not have systemic agent failures or contraindications. 
Response rates in Brodalumab subjects for sPGA (0 or 1), PASI 75, and PASI 100 at week 12 were lower 
in subgroups of subjects who had a baseline body weight of > 100 kg. For the 210 mg Brodalumab Q2W 
group sPGA (0 or 1) response rates were 66.8% for subjects >100kg and 83.6% for subjects <100kg 
while for PASI 75 response rates in the Brodalumab 210 mg Q2W group were 76.6% for subjects > 100 
kg and 90.4% for subjects ≤  100 kg. For subjects in the Brodalumab 140 mg Q2W group, response rates 
measured by sPGA (0 or1) were 31.0% (> 100 kg) and 69.7% (≤ 100 kg), measured by PASI 75 were 
41.8% (> 100 kg) and 77.2% (≤ 100 kg). For PASI 100 the response rates were 33.7% (210mg Q2W; 
>100kg), 49.1% (210mg Q2W; ≤100kg), 7.6% (140 mg Q2W; >100kg) and 33.6% (140 mg Q2W; ≤100 
kg). 
For subjects who did or did not have prior use of biologic psoriasis therapies the response rates in 
Brodalumab for or sPGA (0 or 1), PASI 75, and PASI 100 at week 12 were similar across subgroups. 
For subjects ≥ 65 years of age, comparisons vs ustekinumab were nominally significant for the 210 mg 
Q2W group (p = 0.010), but not the weight-based group (p = 0.088). Of note, only 27 subjects ≥ 65

years of age were included in the 210 mg Q2W, and 35 subjects were included in the weight-based 
subgroup. 
Ancillary analyses 
Samples from 34 Brodalumab subjects (2.0%) tested positive for binding anti-Brodalumab antibodies 
after Brodalumab administration through the data cut-off. Neutralizing anti Brodalumab antibodies were 
not detected in samples from any subjects. No impact of anti-Brodalumab antibodies on subject safety 
was observed. 
A Phase 3 Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Induction and Maintenance Regimens 
of Brodalumab Compared With Placebo and Ustekinumab in Subjects with Moderate to Severe 
Plaque Psoriasis: AMAGINE-3 (Study 20120104) 
Methods 
Study Participants  
The eligibility criteria were the same as for study 20120103 (see Study 20120103). 
Eligible subjects were men and women who were ≥ 18 and ≤75 years of age at time of screening with 
stable, moderate to severe plaque psoriasis for at least 6 months before the first dose of the 
investigational product, with involved body surface area (BSA) ≥ 10%, PASI ≥12, and sPGA ≥ 3 at 
screening and at baseline. 
Treatments 
Brodalumab (Amgen Investigational Product) 
Brodalumab was supplied as a 140 mg/mL injectable solution (process 2 Amgen Thousand Oaks drug 
substance). During the blinded portion of the study, Amgen investigational product was administered as 
2 blinded SC injections (1 x 1.0 mL [140 mg] and 1 x 0.5 mL [70 mg]) of Brodalumab and/or matching 
placebo Q2W starting on day 1. Rescue treatment remained blinded until the study was unblinded. 
Brodalumab was administered to the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm. 
Ustekinumab (Non-Amgen Investigational Product) 
Ustekinumab was manufactured by Janssen Biotech and was packaged and distributed by Amgen. During 
the induction phase all subjects received ustekinumab and/or placebo SC at day 1 and week 4. Subjects 
received ustekinumab (one 0.5-mL injection [45 mg] if ≤ 100 kg at the baseline visit and two 0.5-mL 
injections (90 mg) if > 100 kg at the baseline visit) or placebo, depending upon randomised arm.  
During the maintenance phase of the study all subjects received ustekinumab and/or placebo at weeks 
16, 28, and 40. Subjects received ustekinumab or placebo, depending upon randomised arm, with 1 
injection for subjects ≤ 100 kg and 2 injections for those > 100 kg. 
For subjects who received 2 injections of ustekinumab per dose, the 2 injections were to be administered 
in different body regions (upper arms, gluteal regions, thighs, or abdomen). 
Induction Phase 
In the induction phase, subjects were randomised in a 2:2:1:1 ratio to receive subcutaneous (SC) 
injections of 210 mg Q2W Brodalumab, 140 mg Q2W Brodalumab, ustekinumab (45 mg if ≤ 100 kg at the 
Assessment report

baseline visit, 90 mg if > 100 kg at the baseline visit), or matching placebo (randomization was stratified 
by baseline total body weight, by prior biologic use, and by geographic region.  
Subjects with prior biologic use were limited to 50% of the study population. 
At the week- 12 visit: 
Subjects originally randomised to either Brodalumab arm were re-randomised (2:2:2:1) into the 
maintenance phase to receive Brodalumab at 210 mg Q2W, 140 mg Q2W, 140 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W), 
or 140 mg every 8 weeks (Q8W). Rerandomization was stratified by week 12 total body weight (≤ 100 kg; 
> 100 kg), original induction regimen, and week 12 response (sPGA 0 versus sPGA ≥ 1). 
Subjects originally randomised to ustekinumab continued to receive ustekinumab while subjects 
originally randomised to receive placebo began receiving 210 mg Q2W Brodalumab.  
Through week 52, all subjects received Amgen investigational product (Brodalumab and/or placebo) Q2W 
with an additional loading dose at week 13 and non-Amgen investigational product (ustekinumab or 
placebo) at weeks 16, 28, and 40. In addition, to maintain the blind to rescue treatment, Amgen IP was 
also administered at week 17. 
Subjects with an inadequate response (defined as a single sPGA of ≥  3 or persistent sPGA values of 2 over 
at least a 4-week period) may have qualified for rescue treatment at or after week 16 with an inadequate 
response. At week 16 rescue treatment was with Brodalumab for all subjects, including those on 
ustekinumab. After week 16 subjects on ustekinumab remained on ustekinumab even after qualifying for 
rescue.  
At week 52, subjects who were on Brodalumab continued to receive Brodalumab at their maintenance or 
rescue phase dose; subjects who were originally randomised to ustekinumab received Brodalumab 210 
mg Q2W.

Recruitment 
Study Initiation Date: The first patient enrolled on 11 September 2012. 
Primary Analysis Data Cut-off Date: 30 August 2014. 
Conduct of the study 
Amendments: 
Amendment 1 (31 May 2012): 
 
In compliance with a requirement contained in the current version of the European Union 
Clinical Trial Directive, the safety reporting language in Protocol Section 9.2.2  “Reporting 
Procedures for Serious Adverse Events” was updated. 
 
Language regarding topical therapy was clarified to specify that topical therapy containing 
urea was not permitted through week 64. 
Amendment 2 (17 October 2013): 
 
The protocol was amended to provide clarity regarding safety follow-up in Protocol Section 7 
and the hepatotoxicity criteria denoted in Protocol Appendix B. 
  A safety follow-up visit/end of study visit was added to ensure the investigational sites 
captured information regarding any ongoing or new adverse events that occurred 30 days 
from the last dose of investigational product for each subject. As a result of this addition, the 
study duration was updated throughout the protocol to reflect this change. 
Amendment 3 (26 March 2014): 
  Based on identification of suicidal behaviour and suicidal ideation as a potential risk and after 
discussion with regulatory agencies, the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Score and the 
Patient Health Questionnaire-8 were added as instruments to monitor subject safety (i.e., 
stopping rules) as a protocol amendment. 
  As a result of this addition, the post primary interim analysis was revised to reflect the current 
analysis plan. 
Protocol Deviations 
Important protocol deviations were reported for 135 of 1881 subjects (7.2%) during the induction phase 
and the percentage of subjects with important deviations was similar across the groups. Efficacy 
assessments conducted by non-certified assessors was the most commonly reported deviation during this 
phase (52 subjects, 2.8%), which occurred more frequently in the Brodalumab and placebo groups 
compared to the ustekinumab group.  
Between weeks 12 and 52, important protocol deviations were reported for 121 subjects (6.7). Receiving 
excluded systemic/biologic/phototherapy was the most commonly reported deviation across most of the 
groups (total of 29 subjects, 1.6%). 
During the conduct of the study, an IVRS programming error was identified that affected treatment 
assignments at week 17 for 49 ustekinumab subjects who rescued at week 16 with Brodalumab 210 mg. 
Because of the error, these subjects received a placebo loading dose at week 17 instead of Brodalumab 
210 mg as specified in the protocol.

Time to response 
The median time to a 75% improvement in PASI was 4.14 (4.14, 4.29) weeks for the 210 mg Q2W group, 
5.86 (4.43, 6.14) weeks for the 140 mg Q2W group, and 8.14 (8.14, 9.86) weeks for the ustekinumab 
group. 
The median time to a 90% improvement in PASI was 7.86 (6.29, 8.14) weeks for the 210 mg Q2W group, 
8.29 (8.14, 10.14) weeks for the 140 mg Q2W group, and 12.14 (12.14, 12.29) weeks for the 
ustekinumab group.  
The median time to a 100% improvement in PASI was not estimable for any treatment group; however, 
the lower limit of the 95% CI was 12.43 weeks for the 210 mg Q2W group and 12.57 weeks for the 140 
mg Q2W group. 
 
sPGA of 0 at week 12 (vs. ustekinumab) 
The percentage of sPGA 0 responders at week 12 was 36.7% in the 210 mg Q2W group, 27.0% in the 140 
mg Q2W group, and 18.5% in the ustekinumab group. (p < 0.001) 
  DLQI at week 12 
At baseline, the mean (SD) DLQI score was 14.5 (7.2) in the full study population and was generally 
balanced across the treatment groups. Among subjects with at least a DLQI ≥  5 at baseline, the 
percentage of subjects who had a ≥  5 point improvement at week 12 was 86.7% for the 210 mg Q2W

group, 75.8% for the 140 mg Q2W group, 84.6% for the ustekinumab group, and 31.2% for the placebo 
group. (p < 0.001) 
  DLQI score of 0 or 1 
At week 12, 59.0% for the Brodalumab 210 mg Q2W group, 43.4% for the Brodalumab 140 mg Q2W 
group, 43.8% for the ustekinumab group, and 7.0% for the placebo group achieved DLQI of 0 or 1. 
(Nominal p-value < 0.001) 
 
Prior use of biologic psoriasis therapies 
For the co-primary endpoints of PASI 75 at week 12 and sPGA success at week 12, response after 
treatment with 210 mg Q2W or 140 mg Q2W demonstrated similar results for both the biologic naïve and 
biologic experienced subgroups, with lower efficacy for subjects who had previous biologic use. The 
nominal p-values were < 0.001 for the response rates for both doses compared with placebo in both 
subgroups for PASI 75 at week 12 and sPGA success at week 12. 
Ancillary analyses 
A total of 1830 of 1881 subjects were tested for anti-Brodalumab antibodies. Of the 1684 subjects 
exposed to Brodalumab, 5 subjects (0.3%) tested positive for pre-existing binding antibodies, defined as 
at least 1 positive binding antibody before the first dose of Brodalumab. Thirty-eight subjects (2.3%) 
developed binding anti-Brodalumab antibodies after Brodalumab administration through the data cut-off 
(30/08/2014). Sixteen subjects (1.0%) who tested positive for anti-Brodalumab antibodies during the 
study were negative for anti-Brodalumab antibodies at the last time point tested within the study period. 
Of the 243 subjects exposed to ustekinumab at 52 weeks, 2 subjects (0.8%) tested positive for 
anti-Brodalumab binding antibodies, before the first dose of Brodalumab. These antibodies may be cross 
reactive antibodies generated due exposure to ustekinumab. Neutralizing anti-Brodalumab antibodies 
were not detected in any subjects in the study.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The pooled efficacy analyses are based on a Full Analysis Set (FAS) consisting of 4373 patients with 
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis included in the three pivotal studies 20120102, 20120103, 
20120104. Pooled analysis has been performed to examine the primary efficacy across studies and in 
efficacy in subpopulations. Regarding maintenance of effect, studies 20120103 and 20120104 have been 
pooled as their design was identical. 
Figure 10 presents the results of a meta-analysis across the studies with respect to PASI 75 and Figure 11 
with respect to sPGA success.

Results of pooled analysis with respect to maintenance of effect as measured by the proportion of patients 
who were sPGA success responders at week 52 are presented in Table 28. This pooled analysis included 
2964 patients from studies 20120103 and 20120104.

and 20120104. 
Pooled analysis on efficacy in subgroups 
Key endpoints were evaluated by the pre-specified subgroups of baseline demographics, baseline disease 
characteristics, and concomitant and previous therapy. Of note, concomitant therapy is based on 
post-randomization data so its interpretation is limited. 
Selected results of the subgroup analyses of PASI 75 for comparisons between brodalumab dose groups 
and placebo during the induction phase in Studies 20120102, 20120103, and 20120104 are summarized 
by demographic characteristics and previous therapy in Figure 12.

Clinical studies in special populations 
No analyses were made regarding hepatic or renal impairment. Children were excluded in the pivotal 
trials. A weight-based subgroup analysis was performed but the results demonstrate a higher efficacy and 
similar safety profile for the 210 mg Q2W in both weight groups. 
The eligibility criteria of the 3 pivotal phase III studies only allowed study participants between 18 and 75 
years of age. The percentage of subjects older than 65 was 8.2% in study 20120102, 5.3% in study 
20120103 and 6.5% in study 20120104. 
Supportive studies 
Study KHK 4827-002 was a Phase II randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Comparative Study in 
Subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (psoriasis vulgaris, psoriatic arthritis). The efficacy and 
Assessment report  
EMA/381484/2017 
Page 92/135 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
safety of KHK4827 were assessed in 151 subjects. The Week-12 PASI score improvement rate, the 
primary endpoint, was significantly (p < 0.001) higher across all KHK4827 groups than in the placebo 
group, and the improvement rate increased in a dose-dependent manner. With respect to all secondary 
endpoints, the response was greater in a dose-dependent manner across all KHK 4827 groups than in the 
placebo group. The incidences of AEs and treatment related adverse events were higher in the KHK4827 
groups than in the placebo group, but none of the events occurred at a markedly higher incidence. 
Study KHK 4827-003 was a phase III long-term extension study of study KHK Study 4827-002. Efficacy 
evaluations based on PASI score improvements, PASI 50/ PASI 75/ PASI 90/ PASI 100, sPGA of 0 or 0/1, 
and change in BSA involvement all increased over time and remained high through week 52 in both 
Brodalumab groups, regardless of treatment in the controlled study. A comparison between the 2 
Brodalumab groups demonstrated higher improvement rates in subjects treated with Brodalumab 210 
mg. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The clinical development plan consists of a standard clinical package for a new product for the treatment 
of plaque psoriasis and is in line with the Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products indicated 
for the treatment of psoriasis (CHMP/EWP/2454/02 corr).  
The pivotal studies are randomised double-blind placebo- and active-controlled and study duration and 
clinical endpoints are standard for studies in psoriasis. In addition to the conventional clinical endpoints, 
the applicant has developed a patient reported outcome instrument, psoriasis symptom inventory (PSI), 
which is appreciated. The development and validation of the instrument is agreed, as well as the chosen 
PSI responder definition, which indicates complete absence of signs and symptoms or only mild in terms 
of severity – a desired treatment success outcome. 
The included patient population corresponds to the definition of moderate to mild plaque psoriasis. 
Patients with a variable treatment history were included i.e. varying from completely treatment naïve to 
prior failure to other biologics for the treatment of psoriasis. Thus the included patient population is 
consistent with the target population. The active comparator i.e. ustekinumab is an appropriate 
comparator as the target population of ustekinumab in psoriasis is similar. Moreover it also targets the 
IL-pathway. 
Different dosing intervals have been evaluated in the maintenance phase of studies 20120103 and 
20120104. The decision not to explore less frequent doses with the 210 mg strength was made based on 
the dose-response study 20090062 which indicated similar efficacy of 140 mg Q2W and 210 mg Q2W. Not 
exploring longer administration intervals with the 210 mg is considered a limitation in light of the results 
of the pivotal studies which clearly demonstrate a larger response rate to the 210 mg strength in all 
clinical endpoints, see further below. 
The randomised withdrawal and re-treatment phase in study 20120102 allows examining the duration of 
response, rebound and time to relapse.  
Standard statistical methods were applied. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A dose response relationship was demonstrated in study 20090062, although with respect to percent 
PASI improvement there seemed to be a plateau at 140 mg Q2W and 210 mg Q2W. However the pivotal 
Assessment report  
EMA/381484/2017 
Page 93/135 
 
 
 
 
trials do demonstrate a relevant benefit of 210 mg Q2W over 140 mg Q2W. The study results also suggest 
that response is reduced in heavier subjects; this is particularly clear in patients weighing over 100 kg. 
In the pivotal studies 20120103 and 20120104, the vast majority of patients completed the double-blind 
phase. Drop-out due to adverse events or need of other therapy was low across all active treatment arms. 
There was no difference in drop-out or reasons for drop-out between the study arms. There were no 
notable differences between the treatment arms in demographic or disease specific characteristics. 
Discontinuation rates during the maintenance phase were low, however many patients required rescue 
treatment due to an inadequate response (defined as a single sPGA of ≥  3 or persistent sPGA values of 2 
over at least a 4-week period). The percentage of patients entering the rescue phase was in particular 
high in brodalumab 140 mg every 4 weeks and every 8 weeks groups as compared to brodalumab 140 mg 
every two weeks, brodalumab 210 mg every two weeks and monthly ustekinumab. This clearly shows 
that with longer dosing intervals with the 140 mg dose; the exposure is not maintained on an effective 
level.  
In studies 20120103 and 20120104, both brodalumab doses demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo 
with respect to PASI 75 and sPGA responders. In study 20120103, the percentage of PASI 75 responders 
was 8.1% (95%CI 5.3 - 11.7) in the placebo arm as compared to 66.6% (95%CI 62.7 - 70.3) and 86.3% 
(95%CI 83.3 - 88.9) in the brodalumab 140 mg Q2W and 210 mg Q2W arm, respectively. In study 
20120104, the percentage of PASI 75 responders was 6.0% (95%CI 3.7 – 9.3) in the placebo arm, as 
compared to 69.2% (95%CI 65.4 – 72.7) and 85.1% (95%CI 82.1 - 87.8) in the brodalumab 140 mg 
Q2W and 210 mg Q2W arm, respectively. In study 20120103, the percentage of sPGA responders was 
3.9% (95%CI (2.0 – 6.7) in the placebo arm as compared to 58.0% (95%CI 54.0 – 62.0)  and 78.6% 
(95%CI 75.1 – 81.8) in the brodalumab 140 mg Q2W and 210 mg Q2W arm, respectively.. In study 
20120104, the percentage of sPGA responders was 4.1% (95%CI 2.2 – 7.0) in the placebo arm, as 
compared to 59.9% (95%CI 56.0 – 63.8) and 79.6% (95%CI 76.3 – 82.7) in the brodalumab 140 mg 
Q2W and 210 mg Q2W arm, respectively. 
Further, brodalumab 210 mg Q2W demonstrated superior efficacy to ustekinumab with respect to PASI 
100. In the pooled analysis of studies 20120103 and 20120104, the percentage of PASI 100 responders 
was 20.1% (95%CI 17.0 – 23.5) in the ustekinumab arm, 26.4.7% (95%CI 24.0 – 28.9)  in the 
brodalumab 140 mg Q2W arm and 40.5% (95%CI 37.8 – 43.3) in the brodalumab 210 mg Q2W arm. In 
addition, the median time to PASI 75 response was shorter with brodalumab as compared to 
ustekinumab: 12.1, 8.4 and 6.4 for ustekinumab, brodalumab 140 mg Q2W and brodalumab 210 mg 
Q2W, respectively. 
The results of the key secondary endpoints support the primary efficacy analysis. The results of the 
patient reported outcome scale PSI support the other clinical endpoints demonstrating significant 
improvement in signs and symptoms of psoriasis. The 210 mg Q2W dose is consistently more effective 
than the 140 mg Q2W dose for all clinical endpoints. The applicant has chosen to present odds ratios for 
treatment effect. Rate differences are presented for the pooled analysis above also for the individual 
studies. In general a rate ratio is preferred over OR as the OR may overestimate the magnitude of effect. 
However in this case the incidence under placebo is small and the OR and RR are almost identical.  
However rate differences are preferred over ratios as this concerns curative treatment and the absolute 
changes are preserved with rate difference.  In the response to the questions the rate differences and 
corresponding confidence intervals for the individual studies were presented for both the primary and 
secondary endpoints. Overall consistency of effect was shown for the primary and secondary endpoints. 
Maintenance of effect is considered demonstrated. In studies 20120103/4 maintenance of response was 
clearly superior for the 210 mg Q2W dose regime as compared to the 140 mg Q2W, 140 mg Q4W and 140 
mg Q8W dose regime. Response rates at 52 weeks were 65%, 48%, 10.3% and 2.9% respectively. 
However for the 280 mg dose only the Q2W dose interval was studied. It remains uncertain whether for 
Assessment report  
EMA/381484/2017 
Page 94/135 
 
 
 
 
the 280 mg dose larger dose intervals are possible. Based on PK/PD modelling a clear relationship was 
observed between brodalumab exposures (week 12 Cthrough and efficacy outcome (sPGA 0/1). Further 
PK/PD modelling showed that longer dose intervals for the 210 mg e.g. Q3W resulted in a substantial 
decrease of Css,ave and Cmin. This probably would be of clinical relevance; hence large dose intervals are 
not considered an option. In study 20120102 which included a randomised withdrawal and re-treatment 
phase, the vast majority of patients completed the double-blind phase, and there were no differences 
between the treatment groups in discontinuation rate or reasons for discontinuation. There were also no 
notable differences between the treatment arms in demographic or disease specific characteristics.  
In study 20120102 both brodalumab doses demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo with respect to 
PASI 75 and sPGA responders at 12 weeks. The percentage of PASI 75 responders was 2.7% (95%CI 1.0 
– 5.8) in the placebo arm as compared to 60.3% (95%CI 53.5 – 66.8)  and 83.3% (95%CI 77.8 – 88.0) 
in the brodalumab 140 mg Q2W and 210 mg Q2W arm, respectively. The percentage of sPGA responders 
was 1.4% (95%CI 0.3 – 3.9) in the placebo arm, as compared to 53.9% (95%CI 47.0 – 60.6) and 75.7% 
(95%CI 69.5 – 81.2) in the brodalumab 140 mg Q2W and 210 mg Q2W arm, respectively.  
The results of the key secondary endpoints i.e. PASI 100, sPGA 0 and PSI are in line with the primary 
efficacy analysis, demonstrating superiority of both brodalumab arms to placebo. In overall, the response 
with the 210 mg Q2W dosing regimen was larger as compared to the 140 mg Q2W dosing regimen.  
After re-randomization to placebo at week 12, the responder rate declined slowly. Two weeks after 
re-randomization, the majority of patients were still sPGA and PASI 75 responders..  The data show also 
that re-treatment after inadequate response was effective and patients started responding within a few 
days.  
Approximately 90% of the sPGA responders who were re-randomised to receive placebo at week 12 
required re-treatment during the withdrawal/re-treatment phase while only 6% of patients continuing on 
brodalumab 210 mg Q2W required re-treatment. Additional data were presented regarding the duration 
of remission and the effectiveness of re-treatment after recurrence in this study. The median time to 
inadequate response in subjects switched to placebo after receiving 210 mg Q2W was 8.1 weeks (range 
3.9 - 36.0 weeks). The median time to achieve a sPGA <2 following retreatment was 4 weeks. This 
suggests that an on- demand treatment regime is not a realistic option. 
A recommendation has been included in section 4.2 of the SmPC that consideration should be given to 
discontinuing treatment in patients who have shown no response after 12-16 weeks of treatment. 
The pooled analysis across studies support the results of the individual studies i.e. a clear superiority of 
both brodalumab strengths over placebo across studies is demonstrated. Also a larger benefit of the 210 
mg Q2W strength as compared to 140 mg Q2W is demonstrated in all studies. The 210 mg Q2W 
brodalumab strength is also clearly superior to ustekinumab at week 12 with respect to PASI 75 
responders. 
The subgroup analyses demonstrate that there is little effect modification on PASI 75 responders by 
baseline demographics, baseline disease characteristics, and previous therapy, except with respect to 
weight. The effect modification by weight is even more pronounced in sPGA 0/1 responders, PASI 100 
responders and sPGA 0 responders, also in the 210 mg Q2W group. The sPGA responder rate is 84.2% in 
patients weighing ≤100 kg as compared to 64.7% in patients weighing >100 kg.  The PASI 100 responder 
rate is 46.0% in patients weighing ≤100 kg as compared to 27.6% in patients weighing >100 kg. The 
sPGA 0 responder rate is 46.2% in patients weighing ≤100 kg as compared to 27.6% in patients weighing 
>100 kg. While it is acknowledged that efficacy in heavier patients is established, these patients may 
benefit from a higher dose as there is a clear exposure-response relationship as well as a 
clear relationship between response and body weight. In their response company did insufficiently justify 
the 210 mg Q2W dosing recommendation being independently from body weight. As the prevalence of 
Assessment report  
EMA/381484/2017 
Page 95/135 
 
 
 
 
obesity is increased in psoriasis patients as compared to the general population, and as there is 
correlation between obesity and severity of psoriasis, dosing in heavier subjects is considered highly 
relevant. The applicant will perform a post-authorization clinical study to establish the optimal 
dose/dosing regimen in patients with a very high weight. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The clinical development plan consists of a standard clinical package for a new product for the treatment 
of plaque psoriasis and is in line with the Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products indicated 
for the treatment of psoriasis (CHMP/EWP/2454/02 corr). The pivotal clinical studies are standard 
randomised controlled trials. The studies are agreed with respect to study design, duration, patient 
population and clinical endpoints.  
Short-term efficacy of brodalumab 140 mg Q2W and 210 mg Q2W was demonstrated. The response to 
the 210 mg Q2W dosing regimen was larger as compared to the 140 mg Q2W dosing regimen across all 
endpoints. Brodalumab 210 mg Q2W was also more efficacious than ustekinumab and the time to 
response was shorter.  Maintenance of the effect is considered established. An on-demand dose regime 
and increased dose interval has been discussed but was not considered realistic.  
There is an underexposure in the highest weight categories which correlates with reduced response rates. 
While it is acknowledged that efficacy also in heavier patients is established with the current posology, 
these patients might benefit more from a higher dose and the applicant will perform a post-authorization 
clinical study to establish the optimal dose/dosing regimen in the high weight group of patients.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The Integrated Safety Analysis Set in psoriasis (ISAS Psoriasis subset) includes all subjects who received 
≥1 dose of investigational product in any of the Phase 2 and 3 psoriasis studies. Up to data cut-off, a total 
of 4461 patients with moderate to severe psoriasis had received brodalumab, representing a total of 
5448.8 subject-years exposed. At least 1 year of follow-up time is available for 3141 patients. 
Three data pools were generated based on the study treatment period and study design to characterize 
the safety profile of brodalumab.  These are presented in Figure 13.

Figure 13: Psoriasis safety sets 
Analyses at week 12 (Pool A) are considered “as randomised.”  Due to the small number of subjects in the 
70 mg Q2W and 280 mg Q4W dose groups, these groups are not displayed in the in-text tables of this 
report.  However, the data from these treatment groups are included in the all-brodalumab group.  
Because the study designs included re-randomization at week 12 and protocol-defined rescue treatment 
for eligible subjects, the week 52 analysis (Pool B) is based on the  baseline treatment  allocation and 
subsequent re-randomization and rescue treatment. These treatment groups are not “as-randomised.”  
They are the planned treatment groups based on study design, and due to the re-treatment or rescue 
paradigms  built  into  the  study  designs,  the  balance  of  randomization  was  no  longer  maintained.  
Treatment group definitions for pool B are presented in Table 29. 
Table 29: Treatment group definitions in pool B

Subjects who within each period, with (by study design) no planned 
interruptions in treatment, were randomised (and re-randomised, if 
applicable) to a constant dose of 210 mg Q2W or who based on their planned 
sequence of treatments by study design were assigned to receive a constant 
dose of 210 mg Q2W.  
140 mg Q2W 
Subjects who within each period, with (by study design) no planned 
interruptions in treatment, were randomised (and re-randomised, if 
applicable) to a constant dose of 140 mg Q2W.

Mixed-dose 
Subjects with (by study design) no planned interruptions in treatment were 
randomised and re-randomised to both 140 mg Q2W and 210 mg Q2W, or 
who based on their planned sequence of  treatments by study design were 
assigned to both 140 mg Q2W and 210 mg Q2W.  
Subjects who were randomised and re-randomised to receive different 
brodalumab dosages over the course of exposure (e.g.  140 mg Q4W, 140 mg 
Q8W) or subjects who had treatment interruptions that occurred while on 
study (i.e. periods of placebo treatment during the withdrawal periods [based 
on study design], gaps between controlled study and open-label extension). 
210 mg Q2W after ustekinumab 
Subjects initially randomised to ustekinumab who qualified at week 16 to 
receive brodalumab 210 mg Q2W. Ustekinumab subjects are initially 
represented in the “ustekinumab”  treatment group up until the time they 
received their first dose of brodalumab as a rescue therapy at week 16. 
ustekinumab 
All subjects originally randomised to ustekinumab. Subjects  originally 
randomised to ustekinumab and subsequently qualified for rescue to 
brodalumab at week 16 are included in the ustekinumab dosing group until 
their first dose of  brodalumab after rescue, and then included in the ‘210 mg 
Q2W after ustekinumab dosing group’. 
In pool C, the treatment grouping is based on longitudinal exposure of subjects to brodalumab rather than 
on the original randomised (or re-randomised) treatment groups. Subjects in Pool C were assigned to 1 
of 4 brodalumab treatment groups as presented in Table 30. These are defined based on the proportion 
of doses that were either 140 mg or 210 mg among all planned doses after the first dose of brodalumab.

Adverse events 
An overall summary of the incidence of AEs and rates of exposure-adjusted AEs for Pool A (up to 12 
weeks) are displayed in Table 31. Severity of AEs was determined using the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI) CTCAE version 4.0 or 4.03 (i.e. 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3-severe, 4=life threatening).

Note: For exposure-adjusted events, multiple occurrences of the same event for a subject are counted as multiple events.  Treatment 
groups are defined as planned (randomised) treatment.  Data for the brodalumab 70 mg Q2W group and the brodalumab 280 mg Q4W 
group are not shown, on the basis of the very small n’s for these groups, but are represented within the all-brodalumab group. Events 
are coded with CTCAE v. 4.0 or 4.03 (depending on study) and MedDRA v. 17.1.  
Adverse events occurring in ≥2% of subjects in the all-brodalumab treatment group during the initial 
double-blind treatment period are shown by treatment group in table 37.  
The percentage of subjects with any AE was generally similar between all-brodalumab-treated subjects 
and ustekinumab-treated subjects, although lower incidences for arthralgia (2.4% vs 4.8%), 
oropharyngeal pain (1.3% vs 2.1%) and diarrhoea (0.8% vs 2.0%) were reported for ustekinumab 
compared to all-brodalumab; both treatments had a slightly higher incidence of AEs than that reported for 
subjects who received placebo.

Adverse events with exposure-adjusted rates >5 per 100 subject-years in the all-brodalumab group in 
Pool B are shown in Table 34. 
Consistent with the results in Pool A, the events of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, 
arthralgia, and headache had the highest exposure-adjusted rates in Pool B. Upper respiratory tract 
infection events had a lower exposure-adjusted rate in the all-brodalumab group (19.2 per 100 
subject-years) when compared with the ustekinumab group (25.3 per 100 subject-years). Arthralgia and 
headache events had slightly higher rates in the all-brodalumab group (14.0 and 12.4 per 100 
subject-years, respectively) when compared with the ustekinumab group (11.5 and 10.9 per 100

Through the data cut-off (Pool C), the exposure-adjusted event rate of AEs (per 100 subject-years) was 
346.5 for the all-brodalumab group. The exposure-adjusted event rates of serious AEs (7.5 
all-brodalumab), AEs leading to investigational product discontinuation (3.2 all-brodalumab), and AEs 
leading to discontinuation from study (1.9 all-brodalumab) were low across the brodalumab groups. 
The events of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, arthralgia, and headache occurred with 
the highest exposure-adjusted event rates in the all-brodalumab group in Pool C, consistent with the 
results observed in Pools A and B for the all-brodalumab group

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths  
As of the data cut-off, a total of 18 fatal events were reported across the psoriasis program; however, 1 
of these events was not a fatal outcome in a study participant (a spontaneous abortion in the partner of 
a male study participant was reported by an investigator).  16 of the fatal events occurred in the 
brodalumab arms and two in the ustekinumab arm. The follow-up time-adjusted event rate was 0.3 per 
100 patient years in the all-brodalumab group and 0.4 in the ustekinumab group. Comorbidity or 
additional risk factors could explain all of these deaths and the relationship to brodalumab is unlikely. 
Summary of fatal events is presented in Table 35.

Serious adverse events 
Subject incidence rates of serious AEs were low (1.0% to 1.9%) and were generally similar between 
treatment groups during the double-blind period (pool A). Serious AEs with the highest subject incidence 
rates were from the Infections and Infestations SOC (0.5% brodalumab 210 mg Q2W, 0.5% brodalumab 
140 mg Q2W, 0.3% ustekinumab, and 0.2% placebo) and the Gastrointestinal Disorders SOC (0.1% 
brodalumab 210 mg Q2W, 0.3% brodalumab 140 mg Q2W, 0.0% ustekinumab, and 0.1% placebo). The 
most common SAE was cellulitis. Through week 12, there was 1 subject (210 mg Q2W) who had 2 suicide 
attempts reported as SAEs. 
The exposure-adjusted rate of serious AEs up to week 52 was 8.3 in the all-brodalumab group and 8.5 in 
the ustekinumab group. The incidence was slightly higher in the constant brodalumab groups as 
compared to others: 9.8 per 100 subject years in the constant 140 mg Q2W group and 9.6 per 100 
subject years in the constant 210 mg Q2W group, as compared to 5.3 – 8.5 in the other groups.  The SOCs 
with the highest exposure-adjusted event rates (per 100 subject years) of serious AEs were Infections 
and Infestations (1.3 all-brodalumab group, 1.0 ustekinumab); Injury, Poisoning, and Procedural 
Complications (1.0 all-brodalumab group, 1.2 ustekinumab); and Cardiac Disorders (1.1 all-brodalumab 
group, 0.6 ustekinumab). The most common serious AEs were myocardial infarction (0.3 in the 
all-brodalumab group, 0.2 ustekinumab) and cellulitis (0.2 in the all-brodalumab group, 0.2 
ustekinumab). 
Through the data cut-off, the exposure-adjusted incidence of serious AEs was 7.5 in the all-brodalumab 
group. The SOCs with the highest exposure-adjusted serious AE rates (per 100 subject years) were 
Infections and Infestations (1.2); Cardiac Disorders (1.0); and Injury, Poisoning and Procedural 
Complications (0.9) consistent with results observed in Pool B for the all-brodalumab group. 
Adverse events of interest 
Crohn’s disease 
A new onset of Crohn’s disease occurred in one patient during the psoriasis studies.

Infections and infestations 
The Th17/IL-17 axis plays an important role in host defence against infectious pathogens, in particular 
extracellular bacteria and fungi. Therefore infections and infestations were identified as an AE of interest 
for brodalumab. 
During the induction phase, subject incidence rates through week 12 for AEs in the Infections and 
Infestations SOC were higher in the brodalumab 210 mg Q2W group (27.5%) compared with brodalumab 
140 mg Q2W (22.8%), ustekinumab (25.4%), and placebo (23.4%). The most frequent infections (≥1% 
of all-brodalumab subjects) were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, urinary 
tract infections, bronchitis, and influenza.  
Through week 52, the exposure-adjusted event rates (per 100 subject-years) of AEs in the Infections and 
Infestations SOC were 114.6 for the all-brodalumab group and 118.1 for the ustekinumab group. The 
most frequent events (≥4.0 events per 100 subject-years) in the all-brodalumab group were 
nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infections, sinusitis, and bronchitis. All 
grade 4 adverse events occurred in patients treated with brodalumab. 
Serious infections occurred in 0.5% in the brodalumab 210 mg Q2W group as well as 140 mg Q2W group, 
as compared to 0.2% and 0.3% in the placebo group and ustekinumab group, respectively.  The 
exposure-adjusted event rates (per 100 subject-years) of serious AEs in the Infections and Infestations 
SOC were 1.3 in all-brodalumab group and 1.0 in ustekinumab group. As in the induction phase, the most 
common serious infectious AE in the all-brodalumab group was cellulitis. 
Two subjects reported a serious opportunistic infection: coccidioidomycosis (grade 2) and meningitis 
cryptococcal (grade 3), both in patients treated with brodalumab 210 mg Q2W. 
Amongst fungal infections, candida infections were the most frequently reported. Subject incidence rates 
of AEs mapping to the candidiasis high-level term (HLT) through week 12 increased with increasing 
brodalumab dose (0.9% brodalumab 210 mg Q2W, 0.6% brodalumab 140 mg Q2W) compared with 
ustekinumab (0.0%) and placebo (0.2%). The incidence of fungal infections, including candida, remained 
stable in the brodalumab treated patients through the treatment period up to data cut-off. 
Neutropenia 
Interleukin-17A, IL-17F, and IL-17A/F play a role in the proliferation, maturation, and chemotaxis of 
neutrophils. Therefore neutropenia has been recognized as an identified risk in association with 
administration of brodalumab. 
Subject incidence rates through week 12 for AEs mapping to neutropenia were highest in the brodalumab 
210 mg Q2W dose group (1.0%) compared with the brodalumab 140 mg Q2W (0.7%), ustekinumab 
(0.8%), and placebo (0.5%) groups. Through week 52, the exposure-adjusted event rates (per 100 
subject-years) of AEs mapping to neutropenia were similar for the all-brodalumab (2.3) and the 
ustekinumab (2.4) groups. Please see also section Laboratory findings. 
Suicidal ideation and behaviour 
Suicidal ideation and behaviour (SIB) was identified as an important potential risk in the brodalumab 
program in early 2014 based on reports of SIB events in ongoing psoriasis Phase 3 studies. The electronic 
Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (eC-SSRS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8) were 
implemented across the program in May 2014. 
A retrospective analysis of potential SIB events was performed to events reported prior to 
implementation of the eC-SSRS. The SIB events were adjudicated based on the Columbia-Classification 
Algorithm for Suicide Assessment (C-CASA) by a blinded committee which received all available 
information on any potential event.

Overall subject incidence rate of SIB in the brodalumab program (all indications) 
The overall subject incidence rates of SIB in brodalumab exposed subjects up to data cut-off of March 
2015 is presented in Table 36. In total, six completed suicides have occurred in the entire brodalumab 
clinical program up to data cut-off (N=5208, 8519.0 subject-years). 
Table  36:  Follow-up  observation  time-adjusted  subject  incidence  rates  of  SIB  events  from 
first brodalumab dose (subjects who received brodalumab in unblinded Phase 2/3 Sponsor 
studies) 
SIB in brodalumab psoriasis program 
During the initial 12-week treatment period of the psoriasis studies, there was 1 subject with 2 suicide 
attempts (0.07%) in the brodalumab 210 mg Q2W group, compared with none in the other groups. The 
overall subject incidence of SIB was 0.03% (1 subject) in the all-brodalumab group. (The subject with 2 
suicide attempts was counted once). 
Follow-up observation time-adjusted subject incidence rates of SIB events through week 52 are 
presented in Table 37. Looking at the incidence of SIB events up to 52 weeks, the follow-up 
observation-time adjusted rates are lower in the all-brodalumab than in the ustekinumab groups.  
There seems to be an increase of SIB events over the time course. However this observation is 
confounded by the fact that the eC-SSRS questionnaire was implemented after 52 weeks.

Follow-up observation time-adjusted subject incidence rates of SIB events from first dose of brodalumab 
- March 2015 data cut-off was 0.33 in the all-brodalumab group. 
Time to SIB event 
Review of the individual SIB cases did not reveal any notable trends: the time to onset of events from first 
dose of brodalumab ranged from 23 days to more than 800 days; the time to onset from last dose ranged 
from <14 days to 58 days. Based on evaluation of the timing of suicides relative to brodalumab dosing 
interval in the psoriasis studies, there was no clear pattern of timing relative to the withdrawal of dosing.  
Assessment of SIB by prior history 
In the brodalumab psoriasis studies, there were no specific exclusion criteria based on the presence or 
history of psychiatric disorders or substance abuse, and psychiatric medical history was initially based on 
subject self-report. 
The follow-up time-adjusted incidence rates of SIB in subjects with and without a prior history of 
depression and suicidality is presented in Table 38.

a Includes completed suicide and all other suicidal behaviors. 
b An eC-SSRS is administered at the start of a study to collect information on prior suicidality history, known as a “lifetime response”. 
At subsequent visits, information collected is known as the “since last contact response”. Given that the eC-SSRS was implemented 
midway through the psoriasis program, an additional questionnaire was administered to determine “since study start response”. Based 
on the responses provided, subjects were categorized as either having a prior history of suicidality or no prior history of suicidality. For 
a subset of subjects who had both lifetime and since study- start responses, lifetime history was categorized as “unknown”.  
In the brodalumab psoriasis development program, completed suicides were reported for 4 subjects; 2 of 
these subjects had a history of depression, and 2 did not report any psychiatric risk factors but reported 
psychosocial triggers (financial trouble, legal problems). 
Neuropsychiatric AEs of anxiety and depression in the controlled treatment periods in the psoriasis 
studies 
An increased frequency of neuropsychiatric AEs, including depression and/or anxiety, was not observed 
with brodalumab use in the psoriasis program. 
Through week 52, the exposure-adjusted event rates (per 100 subject-years) of adverse events in the 
Psychiatric Disorders SOC were 7.5 for the all-brodalumab group and 8.9 for the ustekinumab group. The 
most frequent events (≥1.0 events per 100 subject-years) in the all-brodalumab group were depression, 
anxiety, and insomnia. 
Exposure-adjusted rates for serious adverse events were 0.3 for the all-brodalumab group and 1.0 for the 
ustekinumab group. 
Epidemiological data and comparison with externally-derived rates from other clinical trials or registries 
for psoriasis 
To better understand the context of the SIB incidence rates observed in the brodalumab program, the 
applicant has gathered data from literature concerning epidemiology of SIB in the general population, 
psoriasis, other indications in which brodalumab is studied, as well as information from clinical trials and 
registries on specific AEs of interest in adults with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis treated with biological 
agents or other recently approved agents. 
Based on an analysis performed in the US adult population by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 
in the past year, 3.7% of adults reported suicidal thoughts, 1.0% reported having made suicide plans, 
and 0.5% reported making a suicide attempt. The overall suicide rate in US adults in 2013 was 0.013 per 
100 patient-years. 
Assessment report  
EMA/381484/2017 
Page 107/135 
 
 
 
 
 
A recent multi-national cross-sectional study (Dahlgard et al 2015) found an overall prevalence of 
reported suicidal ideation of 17.3% among patients with psoriasis; among those reporting suicidal 
ideation, 67.6% attributed it to their psoriasis. Compared to controls without any skin conditions, patients 
with psoriasis were more likely to report suicidal ideation, adjusted Odds Ratio (OR) 1.94, (95% CI: 1.33, 
2.82), and of all of the skin conditions studied, only psoriasis was found to be statistically significantly 
associated with suicidal ideation.  
The pooled estimate of rates of SIB events per 100 subject-years in patients with psoriasis participating 
in clinical trials irrespective of treatment was 0.109 (95% CI: 0.023 to 0.320) for suicidal ideation or 
behaviour, 0.040 (95% CI: 0.011 to 0.101) for suicide attempts, and 0.028 (95% CI: 0.012 to 0.055) for 
completed suicide. The comparison of these numbers and the incidence of SIB is complicated by the fact 
that the external rate includes a variety of studies with different populations and other study 
characteristics. It should also be noted that in some studies, patients with pre-existing psychological 
comorbidity were excluded. 
Biological plausibility of a brodalumab effect on SIB 
IL-17RA – target of brodalumab - is widely expressed at low levels across many regions of the human 
brain. Highest mRNA expression of IL-17RA in the brain occurs in the caudate, putamen and nucleus 
accumbens regions of the brain. Compared to human neutrophils, these levels are low. 
The levels of IL-17 and IL-17R appear to be very low in the healthy brain, while the expression is 
increased under inflammation or injury. It is not known whether IL-17 and IL-17R have any physiological 
role in healthy brain.  
Studies examining the possible correlation of IL-17 and other cytokines with psychiatric conditions have 
not shown a causal relationship between the changes in serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and 
suicidal behaviour or suicidal ideation (Chen et al 2011, Serafini et al 2013, Haroon et al 2012, Lindqvist 
et al 2009, Liu et al 2012). 
Based on the current knowledge biological plausibility of causal relationship between brodalumab and SIB 
cannot be concluded. However it also cannot be excluded, as too little is known over the effects of IL-17 
in CNS.  
Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) 
During the induction phase, a total of 3 subjects (0.1%) had cardiovascular events committee 
(CEC)-adjudicated MACE (2 myocardial infarctions and 1 stroke). All 3 events occurred in the brodalumab 
140 mg Q2W group. The low incidence of MACE during the induction period does not indicate a 
predisposition to serious cardiovascular events. 
Up to week 52, an additional 19 MACE were reported. Two events occurred in patients treated with 
ustekinumab, the rest in the all-brodalumab group, leading to a total of 20 events in the all-brodalumab 
group as compared to two in the ustekinumab group. Myocardial infarction was the most common MACE. 
Altogether up to 52 weeks (thus including the events in the induction phase), the incidence of MACE was 
0.6 per 100 subject-years for all-brodalumab group and 0.4 per 100 subjects years in the ustekinumab 
group. 
There were 4 additional MACE reported in the week-52 period that occurred beyond the exposure window 
(as defined by the dosing regimen) for the brodalumab treatment group. These events included a CV 
death (87 days after last investigational product exposure), 2 events of myocardial infarction (18 and 19 
days, respectively, after last investigational product exposure), and an event of stroke (24 days after 
investigational product exposure). No dose-response relationship in the brodalumab treated subjects was 
observed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/381484/2017 
Page 108/135 
 
 
 
 
All subjects for whom a MACE was reported had ≥1 major CV risk factor and additional confounding 
comorbidities, with most with ≥3 risk factors. 
Hypersensitivity 
During the induction phase, subject incidence rates for AEs mapping to Hypersensitivity (and occurring 
within 1 day of investigational product exposure) were 1.7% in the brodalumab 210 mg Q2W group, 2.6% 
in the brodalumab 140 mg Q2W group, 1.3% in the ustekinumab group, and 3.1% in the placebo group. 
The most common event was pruritus. None of the events was serious. 
Through week 52, the exposure-adjusted event rates of hypersensitivity events (per 100 subject-years) 
were 6.4 for the all-brodalumab group and 2.2 for the ustekinumab group. Pruritus remained the most 
common hypersensitivity event. 
Injection site reactions 
During the induction phase, subject incidence rates through week 12 for AEs mapping to injection site 
reaction were highest in the ustekinumab group (2.0%) compared with the brodalumab 210 mg Q2W 
(1.5%), brodalumab 140 mg Q2W (1.7%) and placebo (1.3%) groups. The most frequent injection site 
reaction events (≥0.3% events) for the all-brodalumab group were injection site pain, injection site 
erythema, and injection site bruising. 
Through week 52, the exposure-adjusted event rates of injection site reactions (per 100 subject-years) 
were 6.8 for the all-brodalumab group and 5.5 for the ustekinumab group. The most frequent injection 
site reaction events (≥0.4% events) for the all-brodalumab group were injection site pain, injection site 
erythema, injection site reaction, injection site bruising and injection site pruritus.  
Malignancies 
Up to 52 weeks, exposure-adjusted rates of AEs (per 100 subject-years) in the Neoplasms Benign, 
Malignant and Unspecified (Incl Cysts and Polyps) SOC were 3.9 in the all-brodalumab group and 4.6 in 
the ustekinumab group. The preferred term with the highest exposure-adjusted event rate (per 100 
subject-years) in this SOC was skin papilloma (0.7 all-brodalumab, 0.8 ustekinumab). 
The applicant calculated the standardised incidence risk (SIR) to compare the rates of all SEER 
malignancies combined in brodalumab-treated subjects with rates in the general population while 
adjusting for the sex and age distributions. For brodalumab-treated subjects, the SIRs with 95% CIs for 
SEER-adjudicated events based on worldwide, Europe, and US incidences were <1, suggesting that there 
is no evidence of increased risk of malignancy for brodalumab treated subjects compared to the general 
population. 
The applicant has also compared malignancy rate for other psoriasis therapies (obtained via s systemic 
review) and brodalumab. The estimated malignancy rate for the category of all psoriasis agents’ 
treatments (n=36465.5 subject-years) was 1.429 per 100 subject-years (95% CI: 1.309, 1.557). The 
follow up observation time-adjusted rate of malignancies in the brodalumab program through the data 
cut-off was 0.9 per 100 subject-years (95% CI: 0.68, 1.20). 
Laboratory findings 
Across the studies, haematology and clinical chemistry parameters were assessed by shifts from baseline 
by CTCAE grade. The majority of patients remained at baseline values through week 12. In approximately 
30% of patients, glucose increased with 1 grade but this occurred across all study arms. There were very 
limited cases of grade 3 or 4 increases. No discontinuations due to laboratory abnormalities were 
reported.

Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and liver tests were laboratory assessments of interest and are 
described separately below. 
Absolute neutrophil count 
Most subjects had ANC values of grade 0 from baseline throughout the initial double blind treatment 
period, with similar proportions across treatment groups (92.4% to 100.0%). A dose-dependent 
decrease in absolute neutrophil count were observed in subjects with normal ANC at baseline (6.8% in the 
brodalumab 210 mg Q2W group, 4.7% in the brodalumab 140 mg Q2W group, 3.3% in the ustekinumab 
group, and 3.6% in the placebo group), as presented in Table 39.  
Table 39: Summary of subjects with normal baseline and post-baseline decreases in absolute 
neutrophil count during initial double-blind period (Pool A) 
Two subjects with grade 4 decreased ANC were discontinued from treatment and withdrew from the 
study, due to an grade 3 AE of neutropenia (patient on brodalumab 140 mg Q2W) and grade 1 AE of 
neutrophil count (patient on ustekinumab). ANC values returned to baseline values within 2 weeks after 
discontinuation of treatment. 
Four subjects (all on brodalumab) with grade 3 decreased ANC were discontinued from the IP due to an 
AE related to the ANC. 
Most subjects had ANC values of grade 0 from baseline through week 52, with similar proportions across 
treatment groups and no apparent trend related to brodalumab dose (87.9% to 92.5%). Grade 1 
decreases were observed in 7.8% of patients in the all-brodalumab group and 5.5%in the ustekinumab, 
the corresponding percentages for grade 2 were 2.2% and 1.1%, for grade 3 0.4% and 0.2% and for 
grade 4 0.1% and 0.2%.  
Up to data-cut off, grade 1 decreases were observed in 8.0% of patients in the all-brodalumab group, 
grade 2 in 2.3%, grade 3 in 0.4% and grade 4 in 0.1% of patients.  
Through the study periods, approximately 10% of patients had a decrease in ANC.  Although the 
percentage of patients with grade 3 or 4 decrease in ANC was low, it is noted that in many cases it took 
long (>2 weeks) before the neutrophil count returned to baseline after discontinuing the treatment.

Elevations in liver tests 
The descriptions of cases with grade 3 or 4 elevations on liver enzymes do not raise a signal of liver 
toxicity. The elevated levels returned to baseline in most cases without changes in study drug 
administration.  
Comorbidities may have contributed to the observed increases in liver enzyme levels. 
Safety in special populations 
The integrated psoriasis studies contained no paediatric subjects (<18 years of age), 4268 subjects 
(93.6%) who were <65 years old, and 290 subjects (6.4%) who were ≥65 years old. There was no 
differential trend of adverse events between elderly and patients <65 years old. 
The integrated psoriasis studies contained 3267 subjects (71.7%) who weighed ≤100 kg, and 1291 
subjects (28.3%) who weighed >100 kg at baseline. No differential safety profile was observed between 
patients weighing ≤100 kg and >100 kg. The safety profiles of 210 mg Q2W and 140 mg Q2W were 
similar in patients weighing ≤70 kg as compared to heavier subjects. 
The integrated Phase 3 psoriasis studies included 1584 subjects (36.3%) who had prior failure of a 
systemic agent or contraindication and 2779 subjects (63.7%) who had not had failure of a systemic 
agent or contraindication. The subject incidence rate for Brodalumab subjects who had ≥ 1 treatment 
emergent AE or AE of interest was similar regardless of status of prior failure of a systemic agent or 
contraindication. Treatment-emergent AEs were reported for 61.7% of Brodalumab subjects who had a 
prior failure of a systemic agent or contraindication compared with 54.3% of subjects without a prior 
failure. The subject incidence rate of treatment-emergent AEs in those with prior failure was also higher 
for ustekinumab subjects. No notable differences in safety were observed for subjects based on prior 
failure of a systemic agent or contraindication. Similar findings were observed when the subject incidence 
rate of treatment-emergent AEs, serious AEs, and AEs of interest were analysed by prior failure of a 
systemic agent or contraindication for Pool B. 3377 subjects (74.1%) who had prior use of systemic or 
photo therapies. Treatment-emergent AEs were reported for 59.1% of Brodalumab subjects who had 
prior use of systemic or photo therapies compared with 53.0% of subjects without a prior use. Similar 
findings were observed when the subject incidence rate of treatment-emergent AEs, serious AEs, and AEs 
of interest were analysed by prior use of systemic or phototherapies for Pools B and C. 
No studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. No studies of Brodalumab 
have been conducted in pregnant women. Also, no studies have been conducted to determine whether 
Brodalumab is present in human breast milk or to assess the effects of Brodalumab in breast fed infants.  
Analyses of treatment-emergent AEs, serious AEs, and AEs of interest were performed by the subgroup 
for region (Europe, North America, and rest of world) and did not reveal significant differences across 
treatment groups for any of the subgroups.

Immunological events 
The incidence of anti-brodalumab antibody development across clinical studies was low. 
In phase 1 biopharmaceutical and clinical pharmacology studies mainly in healthy volunteers, 
development of anti-brodalumab binding antibodies was 2.8% (12 out of 433) across all studies and 
neutralizing antibodies were not found in any subject.

In the phase 1, 2 and 3 biopharmaceutical, clinical pharmacology and efficacy studies in psoriasis, 
development of anti-brodalumab binding antibodies was 2.7% (120 out of 4447) across all studies and 
neutralizing antibodies were not found in any subject. 
The incidence rate of positive anti-brodalumab antibodies was similar across dosing groups. 
No serious adverse events were temporally associated with a positive antibody result. Based on a review 
of adverse events for the subjects with positive binding antibodies, there were no adverse events (i.e. 
hypersensitivity) determined to be due to the presence of a binding antibody 
Anti-brodalumab binding antibodies were found in similar rates (2%) across the studies performed so far 
in different indications. Two subjects in 210 mg dose developed neutralizing antibodies (in rheumatoid 
arthritis study). Both subjects reverted to a seronegative ADA at a subsequent time point when 
brodalumab levels were undetectable. 
Binding antibodies in the baseline sample were detected in 0.3% (19 out of 6539) of subjects in all clinical 
studies. Neutralizing antibodies were not detected in any subject. Positive results from these baseline 
samples may be due to the presence of pre-existing antibodies capable of binding to brodalumab. These 
cross-reacting antibodies may have previously developed against another antigen which contains a 
region of homology with brodalumab. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No in vitro or non-clinical drug-drug interaction studies were performed. 
One Phase 1 study (Study 20110184) in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis was conducted 
to evaluate the effect of a single SC dose of brodalumab 210 mg on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam. 
Based on the degree of midazolam pharmacokinetics exposure change (<25% increase) after 
co-administration of brodalumab, the presence of a drug-drug interaction in patients with moderate to 
severe psoriasis is plausible but unlikely to be of clinical significance. 
In patients with concomitant topical treatment (any or psoriasis therapy), no difference in 
treatment-emergent AEs were observed as compared to patients without concomitant treatment. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Discontinuation of the investigational product and/or from the study due to an AE are discussed above. 
Post marketing experience 
At the time of the submission of this application brodalumab was not marketed in any country. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The generated safety database is substantial. Up to the data cut-off, 4461 patients (5448.8 subject years) 
with psoriasis were exposed to at least one dose of brodalumab and over 3000 patients had a cumulative 
exposure of at least 1 year.  
The safety data was presented in three pools i.e. up to 12 weeks (pool A), up to 52 weeks (pool B) and up 
to the data cut-off (pool C). Pools A and B are the most relevant as these data allow comparison to 
placebo and/or ustekinumab. Pool C allows an estimation of development of adverse events of 
brodalumab in long-term in comparison to the short term controlled phase. Due to the study designs 
Assessment report  
EMA/381484/2017 
Page 113/135 
 
 
 
 
(re-randomization, rescue treatment), the treatment groups in week 52 and up to data cut-off analysis 
are not ‘as-randomised’ but based on subjects’ entire dosing trajectory. The applicant’s definitions on 
treatment groups and the rationale behind them are accepted. The most relevant data with respect to 
safety effects of brodalumab treatment in pools B and C comes from treatment groups ‘constant 
brodalumab dose groups’ and ‘overall 210 mg Q2W/140 Q2W’. Results from other brodalumab treatment 
groups are difficult to interpret as patients shifted to other treatment arms throughout the study course. 
Adverse events 
The overall incidence of adverse events up to week 12 was comparable between the treatment arms: 
58.2 % in the brodalumab 210 mg Q2W arm, 56.7%in the brodalumab 140 mg Q2W arm, 56.3% in the 
ustekinumab arm and 51.3% in the placebo arm. Most common adverse events were nasopharyngitis, 
upper respiratory tract infection, headache, arthralgia, fatigue, pruritus, oropharyngeal pain, 
hypertension and diarrhoea.  
The exposure-adjusted event rate up to week 52 was comparable between the ustekinumab and 
all-brodalumab arm: 394.6 versus 401.3, respectively.  There were no major differences between 
brodalumab exposed treatment groups. Most common adverse events were as in pool A, plus back pain 
and cough. 
The exposure-adjusted event rate up to data cut-off was 346.5 in the all-brodalumab arm.  There were no 
major differences between brodalumab exposed treatment groups. Most common adverse events were 
nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, arthralgia, headache and back pain.  
Mild, focal skin effects (crusts, acanthosis / hyperkeratosis, minimal inflammation) were found 
consistently in all non-clinical repeated-dose studies. These observations were not confirmed in human 
data.  Pruritus was the only skin-related adverse event reported in ≥2% subjects. Across studies, 
drop-out due to lack of efficacy was very low, also indicating that worsening of psoriasis is not a concern 
with brodalumab treatment. 
Deaths and serious adverse events 
Up to the data cut-off, 18 deaths were reported. However one of these was not a fatal outcome in a study 
subject. Causality to brodalumab is not suspected, as patient’s comorbidity or additional risk factors could 
explain all cases. Deaths were primarily from cardiovascular causes, which is not unexpected in a patient 
population with high frequency of type II diabetes, obesity, hypertension and hyperlipidemia. 
The incidence of serious adverse events was below 2% across the treatment groups during the induction 
phase with no imbalance between the study arms. Throughout the entire reporting period, the SOC with 
the highest exposure-adjusted event rates of serious AEs was Infections and Infestations. The incidence 
of serious adverse events was slightly higher in the constant brodalumab group and overall 210 mg Q2W 
group as compared to other brodalumab groups.  
Adverse events of interest 
Adverse events of special interest, based on previous experience with biologicals (targeting the 
IL-pathway) were infections, neutropenia, hypersensitivity, injection site reactions and malignancies. 
Major adverse cardiac events were an adverse event of interest due to the high background risk in 
psoriasis patient population. In addition, due to signals from brodalumab studies, Crohn’s disease and 
suicidality became AEs of special interest. 
Crohn’s disease 
One case of new onset of Crohn’s disease was reported. It is unclear whether the observed case of Crohn’s 
disease is related to brodalumab or whether it is representative of expected comorbidity. However as 
observed worsening of symptoms in subjects with a history or active Crohn’s disease (in >22% of 
Assessment report  
EMA/381484/2017 
Page 114/135 
 
 
 
 
patients) in two studies of subjects with Crohn’s disease, Crohn’s disease in patients with active Crohn’s 
disease is specified as an important identified risk and active Crohn’s disease is a contra-indication in the 
SmPC. Also, in the brodalumab psoriasis program, patients with a known history of Crohn’s disease were 
excluded. A warning has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC for patients with a history of Crohn’s 
disease and an advice to discontinue brodalumab if Crohn’s disease develops.   
Infections and infestations 
The overall incidence of infections and infestations was comparable between brodalumab and 
ustekinumab, also with respect to serious infections. However, all grade 4 serious infections occurred in 
patients treated with brodalumab. Nevertheless, all but one patient continued to receive brodalumab and 
recovered without further events. The incidence of infections remained stable in the brodalumab treated 
patients through the treatment period up to data cut-off.  
Candida infections were the most commonly occurring fungal infections with brodalumab treatment, and 
occurred clearly more in the brodalumab group as compared to ustekinumab. Only one case led to 
discontinuation of treatment. 
Opportunistic infections were reported in two subjects, i.e. coccidioidomycosis and meningitis 
cryptococcal, which was of concern. The 2 cases were reviewed in detail. Whereas these 2 cases provide 
inconclusive evidence for a causal association between brodalumab and serious fungal infections this also 
cannot be excluded either. In the coccidioidomycosis case it cannot be excluded that brodalumab 
triggered a flare of a pre-existing lung infection. For the Cryptococcus case brodalumab use remains a 
possible explanation.  These data do not trigger the need for additional risk management measures. The 
current SmPC warnings with respect to cautious use in subjects with (a history of) chronic infections, to 
seek medical advice if an infection occur and to stop treatment in case of a serious infection, are 
considered sufficient. Also, Kyntheum is contra-indicated in patients with clinically important active 
infections e.g. active tuberculosis (see SmPC section 4.3).  
Neutropenia 
There seems to be a slight dose-response relationship with respect to neutropenia, which was also 
observed in laboratory findings in absolute neutrophil count. A decrease in absolute neutrophil count was 
observed in approximately 10% of patients up to data cut-off. No serious infections were associated with 
neutropenia. Although the percentage of patients with grade 3 or 4 decrease in ANC was low, it is noted 
that in many cases it took more than 2 weeks before the neutrophil count returned to baseline after 
discontinuing the treatment.   
The need for leucocytes monitoring during brodalumab treatment was discussed and considered to be not 
necessary. The incidence of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia is low (n=25) and did not lead to serious clinical 
outcomes. . Moreover generally, subjects recovered and were able to continue on treatment. However, 
the incidence of neutropenia was dose related and occurred in excess of ustekinumab and therefore 
neutropenia is an identified risk for brodalumab.  
Information on grade 3 /4 neutropenia has been included in the SmPC in section 4.8.  
Suicidal ideation and behaviour 
Due to reported suicidal ideation and behaviour events during the brodalumab studies (all indications), 
suicidal ideation and behaviour (SIB) was identified as an important potential risk in the brodalumab 
program early in 2014. Up to data cut-off in March 2015, 26 SIB events were reported in psoriasis 
patients exposed to brodalumab, including four completed suicides. The follow-up observation 
time-adjusted subject incidence rates (per 100 subjects years) of SIB events were 0.33 for total SIB 
events, 0.14 for suicidal behaviour, 0.23 for suicidal ideation and 0.05 for completed suicide. Looking at 
the incidence of SIB events up to 52 weeks, the follow-up observation-time adjusted rates are lower in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/381484/2017 
Page 115/135 
 
 
 
 
all-brodalumab group (0.20) than in the ustekinumab (0.4) group. Assessing possible differences in the 
event rate between treatment groups in the long-term extension phase is difficult, as at this point patients 
had gone through a variety of dosing patterns and the majority had received brodalumab 210 mg Q2W. 
It is noted that the highest incidence of SIB occurred in patients with constant 210 mg Q2W dose in pool 
B (up to 52 weeks) and patients in ‘overall 210 mg Q2W treatment group’ in pool C. However the data are 
too limited to draw conclusions on any dose-response relationship. 
All patients but one with SIB discontinued treatment; apparently none re-started treatment with 
brodalumab.  The applicant has made an effort to identify any explanations for the SIB events. Based on 
the current knowledge biological plausibility of causal relationship between brodalumab and SIB cannot 
be concluded. However it also cannot be excluded, as too little is known over the effects of IL-17 presence 
of IL-17RA receptors in the CNS.  
All subjects with SIB events may be considered to have had comorbidities or risk factors contributing to 
developing SIB. The current SmPC includes a warning and a recommendation to carefully weigh the risk 
and benefit of treatment with brodalumab for patients with a history of depression and/or suicidal ideation 
or behaviour, or patients who develop such symptoms while on brodalumab.  It was discussed whether 
this is sufficient or additional measures are needed to control the risk of SIB in patients with history of 
depression and/or SIB.  
There was no imbalance between the treatment groups in psychiatric AEs during the studies. However 
depression and anxiety were not assessed systematically with a rating scale except in study 20120102, 
and most likely not all changes in mood and anxiety were captured by AE reporting. However in study 
20120102 patients seemed to improve in depression and anxiety, as measured by the HADS. 
Background risk of depression and suicidality in patients with psoriasis has been established in several 
studies. The comparison to other psoriasis agents on the market suggests that the incidence of SIB is 
higher with brodalumab than with other agents: the pooled estimate of SIB events per 100 subject-years 
in patients with psoriasis participating in clinical trials irrespective of treatment was 0.109 (95% CI: 0.023 
to 0.320) (0.33 in brodalumab program). However this is an indirect comparison, and in some studies 
included in the analysis, patients with psychiatric comorbidities were excluded. 
An additional factor on developing SIB could be patient’s disappointment in treatment i.e. patient’s 
expectations on the treatment effect were not met. However, based on the individual subject data 
presented, a relationship of SIB events and treatment failure is unlikely, as there is no temporal 
relationship between the SIB event and PASI score before the event. Disappointment about early 
termination of the study and/or worsening of psoriasis following discontinuation after study termination 
may have played a role in the occurrence of serious depression in some subjects.  
SIB events in other indications 
Up to data cut-off, two cases of SIB occurred in the phase 2 psoriatic arthritis (PsA) study (one completed 
suicide and one suicidal ideation) and two in the phase 2 rheumatoid arthritis study (one completed 
suicide and one suicide attempt). In addition, one case of suicidal ideation occurred in the ongoing Phase 
3 PsA study, the study treatment was still under blind at the time of the data cut-off. In addition, in the 
ongoing study in asthma, two cases of suicidal ideation, one in the brodalumab 210 mg Q2W arms and 
one in the placebo arm) were included in the safety database.  Majority of patients with SIB events had 
a history of psychiatric illness or psychosocial triggers. Overall, based on the data submitted, a causal 
relationship between brodalumab and SIB cannot be established or excluded.  
An updated analysis of SIB and depression events including data from all studies (psoriasis, Asthma. 
Crohn, Psoriatic arthritis Rheumatoid arthritis) that was ongoing at the time of the MAA data cut-off was 
submitted. The updated analysis provides an additional 1325.7 subject-years of exposure and 1270.8 
subject-years of follow-up compared with the March 2015 data cut-off used for the updated SIB analyses.  
Assessment report

SIB 
Across all brodalumab studies the follow-up observation time-adjusted subject incidence rate of SIB was 
0.37 per 100 subject-years (39 out of 6243 subjects; 10438 subject-years). The incidence rate is similar 
to that observed in the initial MAA i.e. 0.35 per 100 subject-years (30 out of 5208 subjects; 8519 
subject-years.  
There have been 8 new brodalumab-treated subjects in the psoriasis subset with SIB events reported 
since this initial MAA. In the psoriasis studies the event rate was 0.37 per 100 subject years (34 out of 
4464 subjects; 9161.8 subject years). For Ustekinumab the incidence rate of SIB was 0.40 per 100 
subject-years (2 of 613 subjects; 503.6 subject-years). 
There was no suggestion of a clustering of these events at the beginning of treatment. There was also no 
suggestion of an increased risk of SIB with increasing subject-years of exposure to brodalumab.  
A comparison of SIB events across recently approved products for moderate to severe psoriasis was 
submitted during the MAA. See table below. Based on the ex- and inclusion criteria it cannot be concluded 
that the populations included in the different psoriasis development programmes differ with respect to 
neuropsychiatric comorbidity. This with the exception of ixekizumab, where suicide risk was an explicit 
exclusion criterion. Moreover, incidences of depression and anxiety with brodalumab treatment do not 
appear to be different relative to other recent psoriasis products.

f   Patient-year not provided instead back-calculated from the rate and the number of attempts. 
There were a total 17 reports of suicidal behaviour in the brodalumab programme i.e. 11 suicide attempt 
and 6 completed suicides. Overall the incidence rate of suicidal behaviour was 0.16 per 100 
subject-years. This was 0.068 per 100 person years in the meta-analysis. In the brodalumab psoriasis 
trials there were 4 completed suicides (incidence rate 0.04/100 subject years) and 1 completed suicide 
each in the Psoriatic arthritis and Rheumatoid arthritis programme (incidence rates 0.1 and 0.63 per 100 
subject years respectively).   
There have been no new completed suicides reported since the 29 March 2015 SIB data cut-off presented 
in the MAA. 
Depression  
Follow-up observation time-adjusted event rate of depression was 2.4 per 100 subject-years in the 
all-brodalumab psoriasis subset (221 out of 4464 subjects; 9173.9 subject years). For ustekinumab, the 
incidence rate of depression was 4.2 per 100 subject-years (21 of 613 subjects; 504 subject-years).  
There was no unique risk factors pattern beyond that of prior history of suicidality and depression that 
predict the occurrence of SIB events or depression in subjects treated with brodalumab.

A causal association between brodalumab and SIB / depression cannot be assumed. On the one hand the 
observed data could be also compatible with the view that the observed events reflect the background 
comorbidity of the psoriasis population. On the other hand suicidal ideation and behaviour has been 
identified as an important potential risk in the brodalumab program as early in 2014. It is agreed that 
current analyses of the data could not confirm this.  
As stated, a causal association between brodalumab and SIB cannot be assumed. However, the issue is 
more whether these data are sufficient to fully excluded suicide risk due to brodalumab. Whereas positive 
data would be conclusive, the absence of positive data does not allow the opposite answer. 
A warning has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC in order to reflect these uncertainties: 
Suicidal ideation and behaviour, including completed suicide, have been reported in patients treated with 
Kyntheum. The majority of patients with suicidal behaviour had a history of depression and/or suicidal 
ideation or behaviour. A causal association between treatment with Kyntheum and increased risk of 
suicidal ideation and behaviour has not been established.  
The risk and benefit of treatment with Kyntheum should be carefully weighed for patients with a history 
of depression and/or suicidal ideation or behaviour, or for patients who develop such symptoms. Patients, 
caregivers, and families should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of 
depression, suicidal ideation, anxiety, or other mood changes, and they should contact their healthcare 
provider if such events occur. If a patient suffers from new or worsening symptoms of depression and/or 
suicidal ideation or behaviour is identified, it is recommended to discontinue treatment with Kyntheum. 
Other post-approval measurements to further evaluate the risk of suicidal behaviour/ideation under 
brodalumab use were discussed. The use of available psoriasis registries was evaluated and it was 
concluded that these are not well-fitted to address the evaluation of the safety of brodalumab versus 
alternative treatment, especially with respect suicide behaviour. Instead an observational PASS will be 
conducted. 
The currently proposed PASS study includes a case-time-control and a parallel cohort analysis. The 
case-time-control study and parallel cohort study aim to address different questions in relation to suicidal 
behaviour. The case-time-control analysis will assess the risk while exposed to brodalumab relative to the 
risk while not being exposed to brodalumab in the population treated with brodalumab at some point in 
time. The parallel cohort analysis will assess the risk of suicidal behaviour for brodalumab relative to other 
treatments, both in the full population and a population restricted by excluding patients with previous 
psychiatric disorders including prior suicide attempts. 
The PRAC provided advice on the proposal for the PASS design during the evaluation phase and concluded 
that it would be unlikely that the study would deliver any interpretable results. This is due to the fact that 
the case-time-control study is designed to evaluate transitory exposures with an immediate effect; 
however, patients taking brodalumab are likely to continue treatment on a chronic basis. Furthermore, 
subjects who completed suicide while receiving the product during clinical trials did not commit suicide 
immediately after receiving the product for the first time, but months or years after the first intake.  
In addition, concerns were expressed on the validity of the database(s) used and the collection of 
information on the event of SIB, its severity, the PASI score, previous psychiatric history or past 
treatments.  
The PRAC considered that the limitations above were unlikely to be addressed and that, as a 
consequence, the proposal for the case-time-control study might not be the most suitable.

The CHMP valued the advice from the PRAC but considered that the case-time-control study, although 
with some limitations, could still provide some valuable information.  
Major cardiac events (MACE) 
During the induction phase, MACE occurred in three subjects, all in the brodalumab 140 mg Q2W group. 
The low incidence in the initial treatment period does not indicate predisposition to serious cardiovascular 
events with brodalumab use.  The follow-up observation time-adjusted MACE rate was 0.7 in the 
all-brodalumab group up to data cut-off as compared to 0.4 in the ustekinumab group. The observed 
event rate for brodalumab seems to be somewhat higher that what is observed for other psoriasis 
treatments. However based on indirect comparison no firm conclusion can be made. All the patients with 
MACE events had risk factors and confounding comorbidities. Several studies have found an increased 
risk of myocardial infarction and stroke in the psoriasis population. For example, a prospective 
population-based cohort study in the UK including >130 000 psoriasis patients and      >550 000 controls 
reported an MI incidence (per 1000 patient years) of 3.58 (95% CI 3.52-3.65) for control patients, 4.04 
(95% CI 3.88-4.21) for patients with mild psoriasis (defined as not requiring systemic therapy), and 5.13 
(95% CI 4.22-6.17) for patients with severe psoriasis (defined as requiring systemic therapy) (Gelfand et 
al).  
Whether brodalumab increases the risk of CV events in psoriasis patients with cardiovascular comorbidity 
is unclear based on the current data. However, the low incidence of MACE during the induction period is 
reassuring. MACE is included in the RMP as an important potential risk, which is considered appropriate 
and sufficient at the present time. Furthermore MACE is included in the PASS study which will provide 
additional data to be analysed within the parallel cohort analysis. 
Hypersensitivity and injection site reactions 
Hypersensitivity rates were higher in the 210 mg Q2W group 6.0% compared to ustekinumab with 2.2%. 
The highest rates of hypersensitivity were seen in the group that switched from ustekinumab to 210 mg 
Q2W (15.7%). However, with regard to hypersensitivity and injection site reactions, there was no signal 
that would warrant special warnings in the SmPC or additional pharmacovigilance activities at the present 
time.  
Malignancies 
Through data cut-off, exposure-adjusted rate (per 100 subject years) of AEs in the Neoplasms Benign, 
Malignant and Unspecified (Incl Cysts and Polyps) SOC in the all-brodalumab group was 3.5.  There was 
no signal that the risk of malignancies is increased with brodalumab treatment. However, due to the 
mechanism of action of brodalumab and as long-term data is missing, malignancies is included in the 
safety specification as an important potential risk and the PASS will provide further data to be analysed 
within the parallel cohort analysis. 
Immunogenicity 
The risk of immunogenicity with brodalumab is considered low: binding ADAs were detected in 2.7% of 
patients in the psoriasis studies. No neutralizing antibodies were detected in the psoriasis clinical 
program, two cases were observed in a study in another indication, but returned to seronegative ADA on 
later time-point. No dose-response effect in ADA development was observed.  
The risk of ADA formation was low 2.3%, seldom was persistent 0.45% and if so could not be related to 
a loss of efficacy or to increase in hypersensitivity reactions. This information is reflected in the SmPC.   
Safety in patient subgroups 
No differential safety profile was observed in elderly as compared to younger patients or patients 
weighing over 100 kg as compared to lighter patients.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The overall safety profile of brodalumab is in line with other biological medicinal products targeting the 
IL-pathway for the treatment of psoriasis, with the most common adverse events and serious events 
falling under the infections and infestations SOC. 
No causality between brodalumab and SIB could be established based on the current data. However, SIB 
events remain a potential risk. This potential risk is considered balanced with implemented information 
for the prescriber and the patient in the product information and will be followed up upon by means of a 
post authorisation safety study.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that brodalumab has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in the 
European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers brodalumab to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
Assessment report  
EMA/381484/2017 
Page 125/135 
 
 
 
 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Kyntheum (brodalumab) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Kyntheum is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who are 
candidates for systemic therapy. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Current therapeutic options for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis include phototherapy, topical agents 
(e.g., corticosteroids), conventional systemic therapy (e.g., cyclosporine, methotrexate, and oral 
retinoids), and biologic therapy including TNF-α antagonists (adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab) and 
anti-IL12/IL23 (ustekinumab and most recently, secukinumab).  
The conventional therapies are associated with dose- and treatment-limiting options. The most common 
reasons for discontinuation of these therapies are lack of efficacy, adverse events (AEs), and treatment 
inconvenience. The biologic agents have been associated with higher response rates in clinical trials.  
Since its approval in 2009, ustekinumab has been shown to be the most effective biologic agent available.  
Although newer treatment options provide improved outcomes compared with traditional systemic 
therapies, there remains a significant unmet patient need for novel agents and mechanisms that can 
provide a rapid onset of effect, improved and sustained skin clearance, and minimization of drug-specific 
safety concerns (e.g. serious infections including opportunistic infections and tuberculosis, malignancies 
including lymphoma, immunogenicity and demyelinating neurologic events). 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The efficacy and safety of Kyntheum was assessed in 4373 adult plaque psoriasis patients across three 
multinational, randomised, double-blind, phase 3, placebo-controlled clinical trials (studies 20120102, 
20120103, 20120104). 20120103 and 20120104 were also active comparator (ustekinumab)-controlled. 
All three trials included a 12-week placebo-controlled induction phase, a double-blind duration of 52 
weeks, and an open-label long-term extension.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
Dose response was demonstrated in study 20090062, although with respect to percent PASI 
improvement there seemed to be a plateau at 140 mg Q2W and 210 mg Q2W. Percent PASI improvement 
(SD) was 16.0% (27.0) in the placebo group, 45.0% (41.7) in the brodalumab 70 mg Q2W group, 85.9% 
(22.5) in the brodalumab 140 Q2W group, 86.3% (27.6) in the brodalumab 210 mg Q2W group and 
76.0% (32.7) in the brodalumab 280 mg Q4W group. P values against placebo were all <0.0001. 
In pooled analysis across pivotal studies both brodalumab doses demonstrated superior efficacy to 
placebo with respect to PASI 75 and sPGA responders. The response rates for PASI 75 were 5.9% (95% 
CI 4.4 – 7.7) in the placebo arm as compared to 66.7% (95% CI 64.3 – 69.2), 85.3% (95% CI 83.4 – 
87.1) and 69.70% (95% CI 65.8 – 73.3) in the brodalumab 140 mg Q2W, 210 mg Q2W and ustekinumab 
arm, respectively. The response rates for sPGA success were 3.3% (95% CI 2.2 – 4.8), 58.2% (95% CI 
55.7 – 60.8), 78.6% (95% CI 76.4 – 80.7) and 69.1% (95% CI 55.0 – 63.0) for the placebo, brodalumab 
140 mg Q2W,  210 mg Q2W arm and ustekinumab arm, respectively. All p values were <0.001.  
Further, brodalumab 210 mg Q2W demonstrated superior efficacy to ustekinumab with respect to PASI 
100. In the pooled analysis across studies 20120103 and 20120104, the response rates for PASI 100 
were  20.1% (95% CI 17.0 – 23.5), 26.4% (95% CI 24.0 – 28.9) and 40.5% (95% CI 38.7 – 43.3) in the 
ustekinumab, brodalumab 140 mg Q2W and 210 mg Q2W arm, respectively. All p values (210 mg Q2W 
vs. ustekinumab) were <0.001. Time to effect was shorter with brodalumab as compared to 
ustekinumab. In the pooled analysis of studies 20120103 and 20120104, median time to PASI 75 
response in days was 12.1, 8.4 and 6.4 for ustekinumab, brodalumab 140 mg Q2W and brodalumab 210 
mg Q2W, respectively. 
The results of the key secondary endpoints, including PSI, were in line with the primary efficacy analysis. 
Maintenance of effect was shown. A higher proportion of patients re-randomised into the 210 mg Q2W 
group were responders at week 52 as compared to the other brodalumab arms or ustekinumab. All 
comparisons for the maintenance endpoint were statistically significant (p< 0.001). 
The maintenance of effect was shown in study 20120102. During the randomised withdrawal phase of 
study 20120102, among subjects originally randomised to 210 mg Q2W in the induction phase, no 
subject re-randomised to placebo and withdrawn from brodalumab treatment maintained sPGA success 
at week 52, while 83.1% of subjects re-randomised to continued treatment with 210 mg Q2W maintained 
sPGA success at week 52. Among subjects who were originally randomised to 140 mg Q2W in the 
induction phase and re-randomised to placebo, 5.1% maintained sPGA success at week 52. In contrast, 
70.2% of subjects who were re-randomised to continued treatment with 140 mg Q2W in the withdrawal 
phase maintained sPGA success at week 52. 
Re-treatment with brodalumab after return of disease was effective. Patients who were re-treated after 
inadequate response during the withdrawal phase started responding to treatment within 2 weeks. The 
Kaplan Meier estimates of median time to sPGA success in subjects re-randomised to placebo and 
re-treated with brodalumab were 6.14 days (95% CI 5.71 – 6.43) in the 140 mg Q2W group and 4.29 
days (95% CI 2.29 – 4.14) in the 210 mg Q2W group. 
The applicant has opted for the 210 mg Q2W dose over 140 mg Q2W dose. This is supported by efficacy 
data as response to the 210 mg Q2W dosing regimen was larger as compared to the 140 mg Q2W dosing 
regimen across all endpoints. The pharmacodynamics studies also support the dose selection, as 
dose-response relationship was observed in receptor occupancy and established skin biomarkers. 
The subgroup analyses demonstrate that there is little effect modification on PASI 75 responders by 
baseline demographics, baseline disease characteristics, including severity, and previous therapy.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Uncertainties with respect to efficacy were related to dosing strategy in long-term and dosing in heavier 
subjects.   
Brodalumab 210 mg Q2W is considered the most optimal dose regime. However, for the 210 mg dose 
intervals longer than 2 weeks were not evaluated.  
The design of the randomised withdrawal and re-treatment phase of study 20120102 allowed examining 
duration of remission and effectiveness of re-treatment. Little attention has been given to these aspects, 
which are relevant for establishing the best dosing strategy for long-term treatment with brodalumab. In 
study 20120102, after re-randomization to placebo at week 12, the responder rate declined slowly. The 
Kaplan Meier estimates of time to first loss of sPGA response show that eight weeks after switching to 
placebo, in approximately 50% of patients efficacy was still maintained (as measured by sPGA response). 
These data suggest that a less frequent dose or treatment by demand rather than continuous 
administration every two weeks may be an option. The data show that re-treatment after inadequate 
response was effective and patients started responding within a few days. Additional data were presented 
regarding the duration of remission and the effectiveness of re-treatment after recurrence in this study. 
The median time to inadequate response in subjects switched to placebo after receiving 210 mg Q2W was 
8.1 weeks (range 3.9 - 36.0 weeks). The median time to achieve a sPGA <2 following retreatment was 4 
weeks. This suggests that an ON- demand treatment regime is not a realistic option. In addition, further 
PK/PD modelling showed that longer dose intervals than Q2W resulted in a substantial decrease of Css, 
ave and Cmin. Hence longer dose intervals also appear not a valuable option.  
As it remains uncertain for how long treatment should continue a stopping algorithm was included in the 
SmPC advising the treating physician to reconsider continuing treatment in case of an insufficient 
response after 12-16 weeks of treatment. 
The subgroup analyses demonstrate effect modification on PASI 75 responders by weight. The effect 
modification by weight is even more pronounced in sPGA 0/1 responders, PASI 100 responders and sPGA 
0 responders, also in the 210 mg Q2W group. While efficacy in heavier patients is sufficiently 
demonstrated with the current dose regimen, these patients may benefit more from a higher dose. First 
there appears to be a relevant linear relationship between weight and response. Second there was a linear 
relationship between doses weight and exposure. Combining these two observations, a weight based 
dose regime was discussed.  As the prevalence of obesity is increased in psoriasis patients as compared 
to the general population, and as there is correlation between obesity and severity of psoriasis, optimal 
dosing in heavier subjects is considered relevant. The applicant will perform a post-authorization clinical 
study aiming to investigate whether higher efficacy can be achieved with a higher dose and to establish 
the safety of a higher dose in the high-weight population. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The overall safety profile of brodalumab is in line with other biologicals targeting the IL-pathway for the 
treatment of psoriasis, with the most common adverse events and serious events falling under the 
infections and infestations SOC. The incidence of adverse events and the most common adverse events 
were similar between brodalumab and the active comparator ustekinumab. 
No such differences between the 140 mg Q2W and 210 mg Q2W doses were observed that would clearly 
point towards favouring one dose regime above the other, neither in incidence of adverse events nor in 
type of adverse events. 
The overall incidence of infections and infestations was comparable between brodalumab and 
ustekinumab. All grade 4 serious infections (appendicitis, sepsis, cholecystitis, furuncle, septic shock) 
Assessment report  
EMA/381484/2017 
Page 128/135 
 
 
 
 
occurred in patients treated with brodalumab. Nevertheless, all but one patient of these continued to 
receive brodalumab and recovered without further events. The incidence of infections remained stable in 
the brodalumab treated patients through the treatment period up to data cut-off.  
Candida infections were the most commonly occurring fungal infections with brodalumab treatment, and 
occurred clearly more in the brodalumab group as compared to ustekinumab. Only one case led to 
discontinuation of treatment. The incidence of fungal infections, including candida, remained stable in the 
brodalumab treated patients through the treatment period up to data cut-off. Opportunistic infections 
were reported in two subjects, i.e. coccidioidomycosis and meningitis cryptococcal. The risk of infections 
is adequately addressed in various chapters of the SmPC. 
There seems to be a slight dose-response relationship with respect to neutropenia, which was also 
observed in laboratory findings in absolute neutrophil count. Decrease in absolute neutrophil count was 
observed in approximately 10% of patients up to data cut-off.  The risk of neutropenia is addressed within 
the SmPC. 
34 major cardiac events occurred up to the data cut-off, two in the ustekinumab group and 32 in the 
all-brodalumab group. The majority of events were myocardial infarctions (53%). The observed event 
rate for brodalumab seems to be somewhat higher that what is observed for other psoriasis treatments, 
however based on indirect comparison no firm conclusion can be made. All the patients with MACE events 
had risk factors and confounding comorbidities. Whether brodalumab increases the risk of CV events in 
these patients with cardiovascular comorbidity is unclear based on the current data. However, the low 
incidence of MACE during the induction period (3 events) is reassuring. MACE is included in the RMP as an 
important potential risk. 
Through data cut-off, exposure-adjusted rate (per 100 subject years) of AEs in the Neoplasms Benign, 
Malignant and Unspecified (Incl Cysts and Polyps) SOC in the all-brodalumab group was 3.5.  There was 
no signal that the risk of malignancies is increased with brodalumab treatment. 
The risk of ADA formation is low i.e. 2.3%, seldom was persistent 0.45% and if so could not be related to 
a loss of efficacy or to increase in hypersensitivity reactions.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Uncertainties in the safety profile of brodalumab concern the risk of infections, neutropenia and the 
difficulties in interpreting the suicidality data. In addition, worsening of Crohn´s disease is reported for 
brodalumab and the product is contraindicated in active Crohn’s disease, but it is unclear whether similar 
effects on Colitis Ulcerosa   can be expected and there are no data available.  
Opportunistic fungal infections were reported in two subjects, which is unfavourable, in particular since 
the reported infections, coccidioidomycosis and meningitis cryptococcal, are serious. The underlying risk 
factors for developing these infections apart from brodalumab use are not fully elucidated. Further data 
on cases of serious infections will be granted post authorisation in an observational study as described in 
the RMP. 
Up to data cut-off in March 2015, 26 suicidal ideation and behaviour events were reported in psoriasis 
patients exposed to brodalumab, including four completed suicides. The follow-up observation 
time-adjusted subject incidence rates (per 100 subjects years) of SIB events were 0.33 for total SIB 
events, 0.14 for suicidal behaviour, 0.23 for suicidal ideation and 0.05 for completed suicide. Looking at 
the incidence of SIB events up to 52 weeks, the follow-up observation-time adjusted rates are lower in the 
all-brodalumab group (0.20) than in the ustekinumab (0.40) group. An updated analysis of SIB events 
including data from all studies, the follow-up observation time-adjusted subject incidence rate of SIB was 
0.37 per 100 subject-years (39 out of 6243 subjects; 10438 subject-years). In total 17 cases of suicidal 
Assessment report  
EMA/381484/2017 
Page 129/135 
 
 
 
 
behaviour i.e. 11 suicide attempts and 6 completed suicides were reported. There have been no new 
completed suicides reported since the 29 March 2015 SIB data cut-off presented in the initial MAA. Overall 
the incidence rate of suicidal behaviour was 0.16 per 100 subject-years. There was no clustering of these 
events at the beginning of treatment or an increased risk of SIB with increasing subject-years of exposure 
to brodalumab.   
It is noted that the highest incidence of SIB occurred in patients with constant 210 mg Q2W dose in pool 
B (up to 52 weeks) and patients in ‘overall 210 mg Q2W treatment group’ in pool C. However, the data are 
too limited to draw conclusions on any dose-response relationship. 
All patients but one with SIB discontinued treatment; apparently, none re-started treatment with 
brodalumab. There are no follow-up data with respect to recovery of SIB/depression.  
All subjects with SIB events may be considered to have had co-morbidity or risk factors contributing to 
developing SIB. There was no unique risk factors pattern beyond that of prior history of suicidality and 
depression that predicted the occurrence of SIB events/ or depression. As a temporal relationship 
between the SIB event and PASI score was absent it is considered unlikely that not meeting treatment 
expectations contributed to the SIB events.  
Based on the current knowledge biological plausibility of causal relationship between brodalumab and SIB 
cannot be concluded. However, it also cannot be excluded, as too little is known over the effects of IL-17 
in CNS. The IL-17 receptor is expressed in CNS-resident cells which suggests direct physiological role of 
IL-17 in the CNS, although this role is largely unknown due to the lack specific studies. Moreover, receptor 
blockade inhibits signalling of multiple IL-17 family members in contrast to monoclonal anti-IL-17A 
antibodies. 
The SmPC includes warning statements and advises to carefully weigh the risk and benefit of treatment 
with brodalumab for patients with a history of depression and/or suicidal ideation or behaviour, or 
patients who develop such symptoms while on brodalumab.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Brodalumab selectively targets the human IL-17RA receptor which represents a novel mechanism to 
inhibit the inflammation and clinical symptoms associated with psoriasis. 
Efficacy of brodalumab in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis was demonstrated in a 
clinical program with adequately designed studies with respect to treatment duration, patient population 
and clinical endpoints. The effect size was large, in terms of PASI 75 and sPGA responders. The effect size 
of complete clearance – the desired treatment outcome - as measured by PASI 100 and sPGA-0 
responders was also large. Superiority of the 210 mg Q2W brodalumab dosing regimen over ustekinumab 
in complete clearance was demonstrated and time to effect was shorter for brodalumab as compared to 
ustekinumab. Secondary endpoints, including patient reported outcomes, were consistent with the 
primary endpoints.  
Maintenance of effect was demonstrated. The vast majority of patients with continuous brodalumab 
treatment were sPGA responders at week 52. 
There were no notable differences in efficacy between systemic treatment naïve patients and patients 
previously treated with systemic treatment, including other biologicals and/or failure to respond to these. 
The magnitude of effect was larger for the 210 mg Q2W dose as compared to the 140 mg Q2W dose 
across endpoints. This is supported by pharmacodynamics data which established dose-response 
relationship in receptor occupancy and skin biomarkers. No such differences in incidence of adverse 
events or type of adverse events were observed that would prevent selecting the 210 mg Q2W dose 
regimen above 140 mg Q2W. Moreover, the magnitude of effect of brodalumab 210 mg Q2W was larger 
than of ustekinumab consistently in both studies in which ustekinumab was included as an active control.  
Even though the risk of opportunistic infections is appropriately managed by routine risk minimisation 
measures they are important in the benefit risk evaluation, in particular since reported infections, i.e. 
coccidioidomycosis and meningitis cryptococcal, were serious.  
The potential risk of suicidal ideation and especially suicidal behaviour (combination of suicidal attempts 
and suicides) was made potential risk in the risk management plan as, based on the data it can neither be 
concluded nor excluded that SIB is drug-related.  
Restricting the indication to a patient population that benefits the most clearly would reduce exposure to 
brodalumab and the potential risk of SIB if it is drug related. However, this will have the implicit 
assumption that the potential risk of SIB can already be categorised as an identified risk. Following this 
line of reasoning to the end one may argue that if the potential risk of suicides is perceived as serious 
enough to restrict the indication it could be questioned to licence the drug at all, considering that there are 
sufficient alternative treatment options. A counter argument against this is that in the controlled studies 
brodalumab was clearly superior to ustekinumab.  
In their response the Applicant argued that a restriction of the indication to a subpopulation is not 
appropriate as a subpopulation that benefits the most could not be defined.   
In light of the available data and knowledge, a potential causal association of suicidality with brodalumab 
cannot be excluded or confirmed. If a causal relationship would be true, a restriction to a population that 
may artificially increase the incidence of suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviour would not be adequate 
because this restricted population most likely has a higher risk of depression and anxiety as compared to 
Assessment report  
EMA/381484/2017 
Page 133/135 
 
 
 
 
the unrestricted population. If a causal relationship is not true a broad indication would incorrectly be 
denied. 
As such, the CHMP is currently of the opinion that the uncertainty with respect to the risk of suicidal 
behaviour under use of brodalumab does not warrant a restriction of the indication to a population with an 
insufficient response to other biologicals. This provided that any potential risk will be correctly addressed 
with information available in the SmPC and that this risk will be further evaluated in a PASS study. 
Suicidal behaviour and serious infection will be further evaluated by means of a case-time-control study 
post authorisation as described in the RMP. This study will also sample data on MACE and Malignancies.  
In addition, careful proactive follow-up via routine pharmacovigilance activities will be performed by 
means of a thorough assessment on SIB in each PSUR, including an analysis on reporting rate by country 
on SIB cases with a comparison to the background incidence expected in this population. Follow-up 
questionnaires will be used to retrieve additional information on spontaneous reports of suicidal ideation 
and behaviour to have most complete case reports available to allow proper assessment. 
No established biomarkers exist that are predictive for suicidal ideation or suicide. The Applicant proposed 
to include the C-SSRS in all future randomised controlled clinical trials with brodalumab. The inclusion of 
potential biomarkers, clinical risk assessments that may discriminate between low and high suicidal 
ideation / suicide might be considered and would be welcomed (AB Niculescu 2015, F Levey 2016). In 
addition, it has been proposed by the PRAC that a DHPC should be distributed at the launch of the product 
to properly communicate the potential risks of suicidal ideation and behaviour to prescribers. This was not 
adopted by the CHMP since a DHPC at the time of launching might create over-reporting of SIB for 
brodalumab. This could create an imbalance on the reported post-marketing events for brodalumab that 
might not reflect a true difference between various products and the risk of the SIB. Any information 
considered relevant to properly inform the prescribers has been reflected throughout the SmPC. 
CHMP considered that warning statements in SmPC and package leaflet concerning the potential 
increased risk of suicidality with brodalumab and a recommendation to discontinue therapy in 
non-responders allied to the PASS are sufficient for the time being to balance the potential risk of SIB. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Efficacy of brodalumab in the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis was demonstrated, both in 
systemic treatment naïve patients and patients previously treated with systemic agents, including 
biologicals. The effect size was large, also with respect to complete clearance. Secondary endpoints 
including patient reported outcomes were in line with the primary analysis. Maintenance of effect was also 
demonstrated. The demonstrated high efficacy is considered to outweigh the typical identified 
unfavourable effects i.e. serious infection and potential malignancies. In particular the uncertainties with 
respect to suicidal behaviour (suicide attempt/suicide) will be further evaluated in a case-time control 
study and the parallel cohort study.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the risk-benefit balance of Kyntheum is favourable in the following indication: 
Treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic 
therapy. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that brodalumab is considered to be 
a new active substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the 
European Union.

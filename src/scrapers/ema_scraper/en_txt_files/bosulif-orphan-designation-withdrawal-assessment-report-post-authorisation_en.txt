Following communication of the outcome of the discussion, the sponsor formally requested the 
withdrawal of the orphan designation on 15 March 2018, prior to final opinion. 
2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion at the designation stage 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product designation in 2010 was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
chronic myeloid leukaemia (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to be 
affecting approximately 1.6 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, at the time the application 
was made; 
the condition is chronically debilitating and life-threatening, in particular due to high mortality rate 
of refractory or relapsed disease; 
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the European 
Union, sufficient justification has been provided that bosutinib may be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. This seems justified based on a potential clinically relevant 
advantage based on the preclinical and preliminary clinical data provided in the condition. The 
preliminary clinical data in patients resistant to currently authorised products might offer a 
clinically relevant advantage in those populations. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
type II variation 
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
CML is a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by a reciprocal t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation that 
results in the formation of the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome containing the p210 BCR-ABL1 (hereafter 
referred to as BCR-ABL) oncogene.  
The approved therapeutic indication “treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia 
Chromosome positive (Ph+) Chronic Phase (CP) Chronic Myelogenous Leukaemia (CML)” falls within 
the scope of the designated orphan indication “treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
Based on the CHMP assessment, the intention to treat the condition has been justified. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
At the time of initial designation and at the time of initial marketing authorisation, the COMP agreed 
that the condition was chronically debilitating and life-threatening. At the time of this review CML is 
presented to remain a life-threatening disease with a median natural survival of approximately 4 years. 
Although the newer treatment options have provided a significant clinical benefit with a majority of 
Withdrawal Assessment Report - Orphan Maintenance  
EMA/214220/2018  
Page 4/11 
 
 
 
 
patients obtaining MMR and a near normal life expectancy, these patients are not cured, and thus 
there is still an unmet medical need.   
The COMP concluded that the condition remains life threatening and chronically debilitating due to the 
consequences of the bone marrow dysfunction, such as intracranial or gastro-intestinal haemorrhagic 
episodes, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and the risk of severe infections. The condition 
progresses rapidly and is fatal within days to weeks or a few months if left untreated.  
Number of people affected or at risk 
At the time of designation the prevalence was agreed to be 1.6 per 10,000. At the time of the initial 
marketing authorisation, the prevalence was estimated to be approximately 1 per 10,000.  
For this review the prevalence was presented to the COMP to remain less than 5 per 10,000 and was 
estimated to be 1.32 per 10,000. GLOBOCAN crude incidence data on ‘leukaemia’ was the basis for the 
prevalence calculation. Subsequently, it was assumed that 15% of all ‘leukaemias’ as reported by 
GLOBOCAN would be CML. It was further substantiated that incidence has remained stable, thus a 5 
year partial prevalence from 2012 to 2017 was calculated. 
This presented prevalence figure might not represent the prevalence at the time of marketing 
authorisation in 2018 as the EUCAN data is from 2012 and the disease duration stems from relatively 
old publications. The disease duration could have improved over the last 8 years and CML could 
possibly even be considered a chronic condition. In this context, the 5 year partial prevalence needs to 
be further substantiated. Furthermore, the assumption of a 15% CML rate of all leukaemias should be 
further justified. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
The following products can be identified to be authorised for the treatment of CML: hydroxyurea, 
interferon alfa-2b, imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib. 
The COMP also takes into consideration the current European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 
treatment guideline from Hochhaus and colleagues 2017 (Ann Oncol (2017) 28 (suppl 4): iv41–iv51). 
Significant benefit 
Significant benefit needs to be demonstrated in adult patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia 
Chromosome positive (Ph+) Chronic Phase (CP) Chronic Myelogenous Leukaemia (CML). In this 
context the ESMO guideline outlines the options for first-line therapy in CML to be imatinib, nilotinib or 
dasatinib. Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) selection should be based on treatment goals, age and 
comorbidities and should take into consideration the adverse event profile of the available drugs. 
Taking into consideration the ESMO guideline and the authorisation status of medicinal products, it was 
considered that significant benefit would need to be established versus imatinib, dasitinib and nilotinib.  
Significant benefit over imatinib is argued on the basis of clinical trial AV001 [BFORE]. This trial was 
assessed as pivotal evidence by the CHMP (please also refer to the EPAR of Bosulif). This was a 
multicenter Phase 3 randomised, open-label study of Bosulif versus imatinib in adult patients with 
Withdrawal Assessment Report - Orphan Maintenance

newly diagnosed chronic phase CML. The primary objective of Study AV001 was to compare the 
proportion of patients demonstrating major molecular response (MMR) at 12 months (48 weeks) in the 
Bosulif arm with that of the imatinib arm in newly diagnosed Ph+ CP CML patients harboring b2a2 
and/or b3a2 transcripts and baseline BCR-ABL copies >0 in order to demonstrate statistically 
significant superiority. The primary endpoint was MMR defined as ≤0.1% BCR-ABL/ABL ratio by 
international scale (corresponding to ≥3 log reduction from standardized baseline) by RQ-PCR with at 
least 3,000 ABL transcripts analysed by the central laboratory. The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) 
population was the primary analysis population and was used for the primary efficacy comparison (487 
patients, 246 in the Bosulif arm, 241 in the imatinib arm). Treatment with Bosulif 400 mg once daily 
resulted in a statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of MMR at 12 months (48 
weeks) compared to imatinib (47.2% vs 36.9%, 1-sided p-value=0.0100). Therefore, the pivotal trial 
reached its primary objective and demonstrated adequately the claimed superiority over imatinib in the 
intended first line CP-CML target population. With respect to secondary endpoint MMR at 18 months 
the superiority seems to be also robust in both analysis populations: 56.9% in the Bosulif arm vs. 
47.7% in the imatinib arm (1-sided p-value=0.0208) in the mITT population, and 56.7% in the Bosulif 
arm vs 46.6% in the imatinib arm (1-sided p-value=0.0099) in the ITT population. In conclusion, the 
COMP established significant benefit of Bosulif over imatinib based on a clinically relevant advantage, 
taking into consideration the clinical data submitted to the COMP and the CHMP assessment of the 
benefit-risk.

a. Not MMR included subjects not having a MMR at the Month 12 (Week 48) assessment.  
b. The p-value was based on a CMH test for general association between treatment and response with stratification 
by Sokal risk group (low, intermediate, high) and Region (1-3) as determined at time of randomization. If odds 
ratio of bosutinib vs imatinib >1 then the 1-sided p-value=1-probnorm (square root (CMH statistic)). If the odds 
ratio is ≤1 then the 1-sided p-value=1-probnorm (-square root (CMH statistic)), where probnorm=normal 
distribution function. Note: Percentages were based on number of subjects in each treatment arm. MMR was 
defined as ≤0.1% BCR-ABL ratio on international scale (corresponding to ≥3 log reduction from standardized 
baseline) with a minimum of 3000 ABL transcripts assessed by the central laboratory.  
Indirect comparisons on efficacy and safety are presented for the support of significant benefit versus 
the authorised second generation TKIs dasitinib and nilotinib. Table 2 presents the outcome of an 
indirect comparison of efficacy data from trials of Bosulif, dasatinib and nilotinib. The differences and 
similarities of the enrolled patient populations across clinical trials have not been discussed, which 
would be important to understand the validity of the indirect comparisons. Furthermore, not all 
endpoints were consistently collected with the same methodology across all three development plans 
so therefore indirect comparisons might not be adequate. The indirect comparison of MMR rate at 12 
months versus nilotinib shows a slightly better rate for Bosulif (47% versus 44%). Regarding CCyR, 
the indirect comparison of CCyR rate by 12 months between all three compounds doesn’t show an 
improved rate for Bosulif (77% versus 83% and 80%). Regarding overall survival, the OS rate at 12

months shows improved survival for Bosulif (99.6% versus 97% and 95%). In conclusion, the better 
outcome in survival and MMR rate should be juxtaposed versus the comparably worse outcome on 
CCyR. In addition, the provided indirect comparison data needs to be contextualised with patient 
population characteristics across trials in order to understand the validity of the indirect comparison.  
Significant benefit over authorised second generation TKIs nilotinib and dasatinib is also suggested on 
the grounds of an improved safety. Table 3 presents an overview of the overall safety profiles of the 
authorised TKIs as reported by published Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPCs). The provided 
tabulated overview needs to be accompanied with a comparative discussion in order to identify a 
significant benefit based on improved safety taking into consideration the full safety profile.

Significant benefit on improved safety is specifically claimed regarding major arterial events. Table 4 
presents the outcome of a published meta-analysis of 29 studies with over 15,000 patients on the 
incidence rate of major arterial events for Bosulif compared to other second-generation TKIs (Chai-
Adisaksopha et al, J Thromb Haemost. 2015 Nov;13(11):2012-20.). Indeed, this study suggests that 
Bosulif compares favourably with dasatinib and nilotinib. In detail, incidence rates of major arterial 
events were 0.8 per 100 patient-years for non-TKI treatments, 1.1 per 100 patient-years for dasatinib, 
0.1 per 100 patient-years for imatinib, 0.4 per 100 patient-years for Bosulif, 2.8 per 100 patient-years 
for nilotinib and 10.6 per 100 patient years for ponatinib. It is acknowledged by the current ESMO 
guideline that the selection of TKI is mainly based on adverse effect profile of individual compounds. If 
the suggested higher incidence rate in major arterial events is a significant benefit to patients when

Finally, it is argued that Bosulif provides a significant benefit to patients by improving or maintaining 
quality of life in patients as measured in study AV001. The results of trial AV001 however showed 
comparable quality of life of Bosulif and imatinib. No comparative discussion versus quality of life of 
dasatinib or nilotinib could be provided due to a lack of quality of life data form their clinical 
development. Hence, significant benefit on a major contribution to patient care due to an improved 
quality of life cannot be established without the provision of further comparative data. 
In conclusion, the currently provided data is sufficient to demonstrate significant benefit on clinically 
relevant advantage versus imatinib based on comparative clinical trial data. In contrast, the currently 
provided indirect comparative evidence on efficacy and safety cannot be considered sufficient to 
establish significant benefit versus the second-generation TKIs dasatinib and nilotinib. The validity of 
the indirect comparison on efficacy is currently questioned without a scientific discussion on the 
comparability of patient populations and without further clarification if the compared endpoints were 
measured by using a common methodology. Furthermore, the full safety profile should be outlined as 
part of the comparative discussion to substantiate significant benefit on the grounds of improved 
safety. In this context, a quantitative element should be provided to understand the patient population 
that would benefit from Bosulif treatment due to safety concerns associated with the other compounds.

4.  COMP list of issues 
Regarding the prevalence estimate, the sponsor proposes 5 year partial prevalence based on 
GLOBOCAN data by indirect estimation. Please justify the chosen epidemiological index and consult the 
HMRN database from York University (UK) for specific data for CML.  
Regarding significant benefit claim on improved efficacy, the sponsor should justify the methodology 
and robustness of the presented indirect comparison with second generation TKIs. Furthermore, the 
sponsor should discuss the OS outcome as a secondary endpoint in trial AV001 and discuss it in the 
context of authorised products.  
Regarding significant benefit claim on improved safety, the sponsor should present more background 
and further justification of significant benefit based on the full safety profile of Bosulif. It is noted that 
at the time of initial marketing authorisation the safety profile (including first line data) was under 
CHMP scrutiny due to observed hepatotoxicity and gastrointestinal toxicity. In addition, the sponsor is 
requested to identify, characterise and quantify the patient population that cannot receive the other 
TKI products due to their adverse event profile and would benefit from Bosulif treatment.

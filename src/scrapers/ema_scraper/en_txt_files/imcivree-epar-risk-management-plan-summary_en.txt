Summary of risk management plan for IMCIVREE 
(setmelanotide) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for IMCIVREE. The RMP details important risks of 
IMCIVREE,  how  these  risks  can  be  minimised,  and  how  more  information  will  be  obtained  about 
IMCIVREE’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
IMCIVREE’s  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  (PL)  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how IMCIVREE should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for IMCIVREE should be read in the context of all this information including 
the  assessment  report  of  the  evaluation  and  its  plain-language  summary,  all  which  is  part  of  the 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of IMCIVREE's RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for
IMCIVREE is  authorised  for  the  treatment  of  obesity  and  the  control  of  hunger  associated  with 
genetically confirmed loss-of-function  biallelic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), including Proprotein 
Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 1 (PCSK1),  deficiency or biallelic leptin receptor (LEPR) deficiency in 
adults and children 6 years of age and  above. (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains 
setmelanotide as the active substance and it is given  by subcutaneous injection.  
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  IMCIVREE’s  benefits  can  be  found  in  IMCIVREE’s  EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines Agency website, under 
the medicine’s webpage https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/imcivree 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to
minimise or further characterise the risks
Important risks of IMCIVREE, together with measures to minimise such risks are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•
•
•
•
Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the
medicine is used correctly;
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
Information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected continuously and regularly analysed, including  PSUR 
assessment so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of IMCIVREE is not yet available, it is listed under 
‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of IMCIVREE are risks that need special risk management activities to further investigate 
or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important risks can be 
regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a 
link with the use of IMCIVREE. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this 
medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs 
further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that 
is currently missing and needs to be collected:

II.B Summary of important risks 
Important identified risk: None 
Important potential risk: Melanoma 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
There is no evidence from non-clinical data, clinical data or 
the drug class for the development of melanoma, however 
given the limited clinical data in IMCIVREE-treated patients, 
melanoma is considered an important potential risk. 
Skin  darkening  was  seen  in  clinical  trials  and  in  several  of 
the non-clinical studies, and in both settings was reversible 
upon withdrawal of the drug. In the non-clinical setting, this 
skin  darkening  was  not  associated  with  differentiation  or 
proliferation of melanocytes and is a pharmacological effect 
of setmelanotide activity at the MC1R. 
Four TEAEs within the SOC ‘Neoplasm benign, malignant 
and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps)’ that led to study 
drug discontinuation were reported in the setmelanotide 
clinical development programme. 
Risk  factors  for  the  development  of  melanoma  include 
ultraviolet  light  exposure,  moles,  fair  skin,  freckling  and 
light  hair,  family  or  personal  history  of  melanoma, having 
a weakened immune system, being older,  being  male,  and 
xeroderma pigmentosum. 
PL section 2 and 4 
Routine risk minimisation measures 
  SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8 
 
  SmPC section 4.4 recommends full body  skin 
examinations be  conducted before and during 
treatment with setmelanotide to monitor  pre-
existing and new  skin pigmentary  lesions. 
PL section 2 recommends a skin examination be 
conducted before and during treatment.

Important potential risk: Prolonged penile erections 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Spontaneous  penile  erections,  an  effect  associated  with 
MC4R  agonism,  have  been  reported  in  IMCIVREE-treated 
patients.  Occurrence  of  these  events  did  not  appear  to 
correlate with dose or duration of dosing, as the number of 
events did not increase with dose or duration of dosing. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Risk factors and risk groups 
No risk factors or risk groups have been identified to date in 
IMCIVREE-treated patients. 
Patients with sickle cell anaemia or trait, thrombocythemia, 
polycythaemia  or  multiple  myeloma  or  who  are  prone  to 
venous thrombosis or who have  a hyperviscosity syndrome 
may be at increased risk of priapism. 
Risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
  SmPC section 4.4 
 
PL section 2 and 4 
  SmPC section 4.4 includes the statement that 
patients who have an erection lasting greater than 
4 hours should seek emergency medical attention. 
PL section 2 recommends patients seek urgent 
medical care if they experience an erection lasting 
greater than 4 hours.

A Registry of Patients with POMC or LEPR Deficiency Obesity Treated with Setmelanotide 
Purpose of the study: 
This observational registry will provide data to further assess the long-term safety of IMCIVREE as 
prescribed in routine practice for patients with bi-allelic homozygous POMC or LEPR deficiency 
obesity,  with a focus on characterising and quantifying the important potential risks of special 
interest, as well as describing the safety in populations underrepresented in the clinical trial 
development programme.

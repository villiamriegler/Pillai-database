double-blind capsules size A (yellow, opaque) with an overfill (mix of magnesium stearate and avicel), 
in dose of CBZ-CR 200mg and CBZ-CR matching placebo double-blind capsules size A (yellow, opaque) 
with an overfill (mix of magnesium stearate and avicel) were administered. 
2.1.  Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
Study SP0994 entitled “A Multicenter, Double blind, Double dummy, Follow up Study Evaluating the 
Long term Safety of Lacosamide (200 to 600mg/day) in Comparison with Controlled release 
Carbamazepine (400 to 1200mg/day), Used as Monotherapy in Subjects with Partial onset or 
Generalized Tonic clonic Seizures ≥16 Years of Age Coming from the SP0993 Study “ 
Lacosamide was first approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2008 and is indicated as 
monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without 
secondary generalization in adults, adolescents and children from 4 years of age with epilepsy.

Comparison with Controlled release Carbamazepine (400 to 1200mg/day), 
Used as Monotherapy in Subjects with Partial onset or Generalized Tonic 
clonic Seizures ≥16 Years of Age Coming from the SP0993 Study “ 
Description 
SP0994 was a double-blind, double-dummy extension study for subjects who completed SP0993 or for 
subjects who experienced a seizure at the first or second target doses in the Maintenance Phase of 
SP0993.  
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The objectives of this study were:  
• 
• 
To obtain information about the long-term safety of LCM in comparison with CBZ-CR when 
used as monotherapy in subjects with recently diagnosed partial-onset or generalized tonic-
clonic seizures  
To allow subjects who completed the monotherapy study SP0993 to continue to receive LCM or 
CBZ-CR  
Study design 
SP0994 was a double-blind, double-dummy extension study for subjects who completed SP0993 or for 
subjects who experienced a seizure at the first or second target doses in the Maintenance Phase of 
SP0993. Following the database lock and unblinding of SP0993, SP0994 was unblinded and was closed 
for all subjects when follow-up access to LCM monotherapy was established outside of SP0994.  
A clinic visit occurred approximately every 13 weeks relative to the SP0994 Visit 1 date with the 
exception of subjects requiring a higher target dose (ie, for dose optimization). Subjects requiring a 
higher target dose returned to the clinic for an Escalation Visit (ES) followed by a Stabilization Visit 
(SV); subsequent regularly scheduled visits occurred at 13-week intervals relative to the SV.  
Visit 1 for SP0994 was the same as the second Maintenance Visit (MV2-1, MV2-2, or MV2-3) or the 
Early Termination Visit (ETV) for SP0993. The ETV of SP0993 as Visit 1 for SP0994 was applicable only 
for subjects on the first or second target dose. Subjects who were withdrawn from SP0993 while at the 
third target dose level were not allowed to participate in SP0994 with the exception of subjects who 
were terminated from SP0993 due to SP0993 Protocol Amendment 6.2. 
Subjects who terminated from SP0993 due to Protocol Amendment 6.2 and who required taper were 
dispensed a taper kit in SP0994. Across the 2 studies (SP0993 and SP0994), subjects were allowed a 
maximum of 2 dose escalations due to the occurrence of a seizure and 1 dose reduction due to poor 
tolerability in accordance with the target dose levels defined in SP0993. If, in the opinion of the 
investigator, the subject’s AEs indicated that the dose was at an intolerable level, the subject’s dose 
may have been decreased. This dose reduction was managed via an Unscheduled Visit, phone call, or a 
regularly scheduled clinic visit. If the subject experienced a seizure at the first or second dose levels, 
the subject was to be brought in for a dose escalation visit.  
This document summarizes disposition, subject demographics, history of epilepsy, extent of exposure, 
and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) for the 7 subjects from SP0994 who were <18 years 
old at the time of study entry in order to fulfill the requirement of reporting pediatric data as outlined

in Article 46. Data from the overall subject population in SP0994 are provided for comparison in the 
accompanying SP0994 final CSR (Module 5.3.5.1). The exploratory efficacy data in SP0994 were not 
summarized separately for subjects who were <18 years of age at the time of study entry.”  
• 
Study population /Sample size 
The study population of SP0994 consisted from subjects who had remained seizure free and completed 
SP0993 or subjects who experienced a seizure at the first or second target doses in the Maintenance 
Phase of SP0993. Subject was expected to benefit from participation in SP0994 in the opinion of the 
investigator.  
• 
Treatments 
In SP0994, subjects received a dose of LCM 200mg/day, 300mg/day, 400mg/day, 500mg/day, or 
600mg/day or a dose of CBZ-CR 400mg/day, 600mg/day, 800mg/day, 1000mg/day, or 1200mg/day. 
Study medication was orally administered twice daily (bid; at approximately 12-hour intervals in the 
morning and in the evening) in 2 equally divided doses. 
Treatment randomizations and subject numbers were assigned at the beginning of SP0993 and 
remained the same in SP0994.  
• 
Outcomes/endpoints 
As this was primarily a safety study, only exploratory efficacy variables were assessed.  
The primary safety variables were as follows:  
•  Adverse events reported spontaneously by the subject and/or caregiver or observed by the 
investigator  
•  Subject withdrawals due to AEs  
•  Serious AEs  
The other safety variables were as follows:  
•  Changes in hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis parameters  
•  Changes in 12-lead ECGs  
•  Changes in vital sign measurements (ie, blood pressure [BP] and heart rate [HR])  
•  Changes in physical or neurological examination findings  
•  Changes in body weight  
Efficacy evaluations were based on subject diaries where types, dates, and number of seizures were 
recorded. The exploratory efficacy variables were: 1) Percentage of subjects seizure free and 2) Time 
to discontinuation. 
The exploratory health outcomes variables were: Health care resource use: Additional health care 
provider visits unforeseen by the protocol and hospitalizations.

Results 
• 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Among the 548 total subjects in the SS, 7 subjects were <18 years of age at the time of study entry.  
• 
Efficacy results 
The exploratory efficacy variables were the percentage of subjects seizure free and time to 
discontinuation. Seizure control was maintained for most subjects in both treatment groups during the 
study.  
• 
Safety results 
Of the 7 total subjects <18 years of age, 5 subjects (71.4%) completed the study and 2 subjects 
(28.6%) discontinued from the study. Overall, 6 subjects (85.7%) <18 years of age remained in 
SP0994 until SP0993 unblinding and 1 subject (14.3%) discontinued from SP0994 prior to SP0993 
unblinding. Both subjects who discontinued from the study were in the CBZ-CR treatment group. The 
reasons for discontinuation were lack of efficacy (1 subject [14.3%] prior to SP0993 unblinding) and 
“other” (1 subject [14.3%] after SP0993 unblinding). 
Among the small group of subjects <18 years of age, all 7 subjects were 17 years of age at entry into 
SP0994. There were 6 (85.7%) female subjects and 1 (14.3%) male subject. A total of 4 subjects 
(57.1%) were white and 3 subjects (42.9%) were Asian; no subjects were Hispanic or Latino. Mean 
weight, height, and BMI were 59.20kg, 163.83cm, and 22.03kg/m2, respectively. There were no 
subjects with a BMI ≥30kg/m2.  
Among subjects <18 years of age in the LCM treatment group, the median age at diagnosis for 
subjects was 15.5 years and the median time since first diagnosis at SP0994 Visit 1 was 1.19 years. 
The median time since first seizure at SP0994 Visit 1 was 1.63 years. In the LCM treatment group, the 
median number of seizures in the past 3 months prior to SP0993 Visit 1 was 3.0 and the majority of 
subjects reported more than 2 seizures in the past year prior to SP0993 Visit 1. In the CBZ-CR 
treatment group, the median age at diagnosis for subjects was 16.0 years and the median time since 
first diagnosis at SP0994 Visit 1 was 1.17 years. The median time since first seizure at SP0994 Visit 1 
was 1.23 years. In the CBZ-CR treatment group, the median number of seizures in the past 3 months 
prior to SP0993 Visit 1 was 2.0 and the majority of subjects reported 2 seizures in the past year prior 
to SP0993 Visit 1. One subject (25.0%) in the LCM treatment group and 1 subject (33.3%) in the CBZ-
CR treatment group reported a temporal focus of localization at SP0993 Visit 1.  
The median duration of exposure and subject-years exposed were longer in the LCM treatment group 
compared with the CBZ-CR treatment group (463.5 days [6.3 subject-years exposed] in the LCM 
treatment group compared with 354.0 days [3.7 subject-years exposed] in the CBZ-CR treatment 
group). 
The median of the mean exposure to LCM per subject was 200.00mg/day and the median of the mean 
exposure to CBZ-CR per subject was 400.00mg/day during the Treatment Period, consistent with the 
overall observation for the study that most subjects remained at the first dose level (>100 to 
200mg/day for LCM and >200 to 400mg/day for CBZ-CR). The maximum mean exposure to LCM per 
subject was 234.0mg/day and the maximum mean exposure to CBZ-CR per subject was 
1050.4mg/day.

Among subjects <18 years of age at entry into SP0994, a total of 1 subject (25.0%) in the LCM 
treatment group reported 2 TEAEs and 2 subjects (66.7%) in the CBZ-CR treatment group reported 7 
TEAEs during the study. One subject (25.0%) in the LCM treatment group and no subjects in the CBZ-
CR treatment group reported TEAEs that were serious (Section 5.5.4). No subjects <18 years of age 
reported TEAEs leading to discontinuation, TEAEs considered related to study medication per the 
investigator, or severe TEAEs. There were no deaths among subjects <18 years of age.  
Among subjects <18 years of age at entry into SP0994, the TEAEs reported in the LCM treatment 
group were appendicitis and postoperative wound infection (1 subject [25.0%] each). The TEAEs 
reported in the CBZ-CR treatment group were pyrexia, contusion, fall, fractured coccyx, road traffic 
accident, and weight decreased (1 subject [33.3%] each). The event of weight decreased was 
considered non-serious and did not lead to discontinuation.  
One subject (25.0%, Subject [Protected Personal Data removed]) in the LCM treatment group reported 
1 event of appendicitis that was serious, moderate in intensity, considered not related to study 
medication per the investigator, and that resolved. 
Discussion on clinical aspects 
All patients < 18 years old (n=4) treated with lacosamide in the SP0994 study were 17 years old at 
entry into the SP0994 study. All of them completed the study staying in the study for an average 
463.5 days with the median of the mean exposure of 200mg/day. Based on these limited results long-
term treatment with LCM was generally well tolerated in subjects < 18 years newly or recently 
diagnosed with epilepsy and experiencing partial-onset seizures or tonic-clonic seizures at doses up to 
600mg/day when used as monotherapy. The overall safety profile of LCM observed, including among 
subjects <18 years of age, is consistent with the currently-known safety profile of LCM and no new 
safety concerns were observed. However, due to small number of patients the results for subjects <18 
years of age should be interpreted with caution. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The MAH submitted the results of SP0994 in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 
1901/2006 (The Paediatric Regulation). The limited number and character of the reported TEAEs in 
four subjects <18 years of age treated with lacosamide in the study SP0994 does not raise new safety 
concerns. The MAH does not propose any changes of the currently approved SmPC based on the 
presented data, which is supported.  
  Fulfilled:

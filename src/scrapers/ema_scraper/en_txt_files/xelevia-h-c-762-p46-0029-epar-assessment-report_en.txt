1.  Introduction 
1.1.  Type of application and aspects on development 
This application concerns a follow-up measures P046 for Januvia/ Xelevia/Tesavel/Ristaben (CHMP 
adoption 21 February 2008) wherein the MAH committed to submit a proposal for a study design and 
timetable for paediatric studies. 
A clinical study report (CSR) was submitted pertaining to study 081 – A Single-Dose Study to Assess 
the Pharmacokinetics, Safety and Tolerability of Sitagliptin in Adolescents (Januvia and related 
products, EMEA-000470-PIP01-08). 
This submission is in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, which obliges the 
MAH to submit to the EMA any MAH-sponsored studies involving the use in the paediatric population of 
a centrally authorised medicinal product. 
2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
2.1.1.  Introduction 
Sitagliptin, an orally active, well-tolerated, potent and selective inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase IV 
(DPP-4), provides glycemic improvement by increasing the concentration of incretin hormones, 
including the key glucoregulatory hormones, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent 
insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), which act to lower glucose through enhancement of insulin 
biosynthesis and release and suppression of glucagon secretion. Studies in the adult sitagliptin 
development program have shown that sitagliptin monotherapy improves HbA1c, fasting plasma 
glucose (FPG), and post-meal glucose (PMG) in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 
manner. When coadministered with metformin, sulfonylurea, a PPAR-γ agonist, insulin, metformin plus 
a sulfonylurea, metformin plus a PPAR-γ agonist, and metformin plus insulin, sitagliptin results in 
statistically significant and clinically meaningful incremental glycemic improvements in HbA1c and FPG. 
Sitagliptin is presently indicated/approved for the treatment of adults with T2DM as monotherapy or in 
combination with metformin, sulfonylurea, PPAR-γ agonist, as well as part of triple combination 
therapy with metformin plus sulfonylurea or metformin plus PPAR-γ agonists. It has also been 
approved for use with insulin. Based upon its mechanisms of action and the similar pathophysiology 
underlying T2DM in youths and adults, the favorable safety and efficacy profiles of sitagliptin are 
predicted to be similar for youths relative to adults. 
The study report included in this submission (MK-0431, PN081) presents data from the first clinical 
study in which sitagliptin was administered to subjects under the age of 18 years. This single-dose, 
placebo-controlled, double-blind study was conducted in 10 – 17 year old patients with T2DM, and 
evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of sitagliptin in this 
pediatric patient population. Single oral doses of 50-, 100-, and 200-mg sitagliptin or matching placebo 
were administered to 35 adolescent patients (ages 10 – 17 years) with T2DM.

2.1.2.  Methods 
• 
Study Design 
This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple panel, single-dose study 
involving 10- to 17-year-old patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Up to 3 panels (Panels A, 
B, and C) of up to 12 patients each were randomized to receive single oral doses of sitagliptin or 
placebo (in a 3:1 ratio, respectively). Panel A patients were administered single doses of 50 mg 
sitagliptin or placebo and Panel B subjects were administered single doses of 100 mg sitagliptin or 
placebo. There was a minimum of 48 hours between Panels A (after completion of 8 subjects) and B to 
allow for assessment of safety and tolerability. Initiation of Panel C was dependent on the review of 
safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) data from Panels A and B after completion of 16 subjects, which 
occurred at the completion of 8 subjects from Panel B. The dose of sitagliptin selected for 
administration in Panel C was 200 mg and was based upon the review of partial safety and PK data 
from Panels A and B. 
The age of the subjects was 10 -17 years and the weight ranged from 50 to 180 kg. 
Demographic information for the 35 patients is given in the Table 10-1

There is a wide range in weight from 50 up to 180.0 kg. Included are 11 males and 24 females.  
Baseline patient characteristics are given in Table 10-2 
In the placebo group there are 8 females versus one male. It could be of interest for interpretation of 
the study data whether the one male in the placebo-group weighed 180 kg, as might be concluded 
from Table 10-1.  
None of the concomitant therapies could affect the study objectives. 
Patients fasted for at least 8 hours prior to study drug administration. All doses were taken orally with 
approximately 240 mL of water, with water restricted 1 hour prior to and after study drug 
administration.  
Blood samples (4 mL) for plasma sitagliptin and DPP-4 activity will be collected predose and at the 
following time points postdose: 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4 (pre-meal), 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 32, 48, and 72 
hours. 
The plasma pharmacokinetic parameters (e.g., AUC0-∞, Cmax, Tmax, and apparent t 1/2) of sitagliptin 
after oral administration of single doses were determined.  
Urine for determination of sitagliptin concentrations was collected predose and at intervals up to 24-
hours postdose in all panels. 
Assessors Comments 
The study design is considered acceptable. That the study was conducted as a multi centre (7 centres 
in the USA), parallel group design with only 8 patients in each group and the time span of the study 
was 28 months, this study is considered of low power and the results should be interpreted with care.     
Analytical methods 
Plasma samples were directly injected onto a High Turbulent Liquid Chromatography (HTLC) system. 
Analyte and internal standard were detected by MS/MS using selected reaction monitoring (SRM) with 
turbo-ionspray interface in the positive ion mode. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) for the plasma 
assay was 0.50 ng/mL and the linear calibration range was 0.50 to 1000 ng/mL.  
Urine samples were analyzed by MRL (Merck Research Laboratories) (West Point, PA, U.S.A.). Urine 
samples were diluted and injected directly onto a HPLC system. Analyte and its isotopic internal

standard were detected by MS/MS using SRM with turboionspray interface in the positive ion mode. 
The LLOQ for urine assay was 0.1 µg/mL and the linear calibration range was 0.10 to 50.0 µg/mL. 
The long term stability was tested over a period of 527 days. 
Assessor’s comment 
The analytical method used for determination of sitagliptin in plasma and urine is considered 
acceptable. 
•  Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
Actual sampling times were used to estimate each patient’s plasma sitagliptin pharmacokinetic 
parameters. AUC0-∞, Cmax, C24hr, Tmax, and the apparent terminal t 1/2 were calculated for sitagliptin. 
Plasma sitagliptin concentrations were converted into molar units (nM) prior to analysis using the 
molecular weight of 407.32 g/mol. Values below the LLOQ (LLOQ = 0.50 ng/mL = 1.23 nM) were 
replaced with 0. The pharmacokinetic variables were calculated model independently.  
Sitagliptin urine concentrations, urine volumes from individual collection intervals, and actual time of 
the total collection interval were used to calculate urinary pharmacokinetic parameters. The fraction of 
the sitagliptin dose that was excreted unchanged in urine over the dosing intervals was determined by 
the quotient of the sum of sitagliptin collected over all dosing intervals and the dose administered 
(corrected for assayed potency of the formulation).  
Assessor’s comment 
The methods for estimation of the pharmacokinetic variables are acceptable. 
2.1.3.  Between Population Comparison 
Between-Population Comparison 
The appropriate dose-adjusted AUC0-∞ from MK-0431 PN005 (N=7 adult patients with T2DM, 25 mg 
and 200 mg doses) was used for comparison with adolescent patients with T2DM. Pharmacokinetics of 
sitagliptin in healthy adults obtained from MK-0431 PN033, a study to evaluate dose proportionality of 
MK-0431 final market image tablets in healthy volunteers, indicate that the range of doses to be 
studied here is dose proportional with respect to AUC0-∞. The dose-adjusted (to 100 mg) AUC0-∞ from 
MK- 0431 PN005 (N=7 diabetic patients, 25 mg and 200 mg doses) was used for comparison with 
adolescent patients with T2DM. 
The dose-adjusted AUC0-∞ (to 100 mg) for sitagliptin was analyzed using linear mixed effect model 
with treatment (25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg) and population as fixed effects and patient as a 
random effect. The ninety percent confidence interval (90% CI) was generated for the least square 
mean ratio (GMR, adolescents/adults) for sitagliptin AUC0-∞, based upon the t-distribution. If this 90% 
CI of the GMR for AUC0-∞ fell within the pre-specified bounds [0.50, 2.00], similarity between the 
adults and the adolescents would be concluded. 
In addition, since MK-0431 PN005 is a crossover study, the AUC0-∞ from 25 mg and 200 mg for each 
patient was dose-adjusted to 100 mg and the mean of these 2 readings for each patient was used as 
historic data in analysis. An ANOVA model with population (adolescent patients with T2DM vs. adult 
patients with T2DM) as a factor for the dose adjusted (to 100 mg) AUC0-∞ was performed as 
supplemental analysis.

the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/191361/2013  
Page 6/20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Due to non-dose proportionality, sitagliptin Cmax and C24hr at 200 mg for both adolescents and adults 
were analyzed using an ANOVA model with population (diabetic adolescents vs. diabetic adults) as a 
factor. 
By including the historic adult patients in the model, it was assumed that time and any differences 
between the protocols (site, country, etc.) have negligible effects on the sitagliptin pharmacokinetic 
comparisons. 
Assessor’s comment 
The methods described for comparison the data in adolescent patients and historical data from adult 
patients are considered adequate. The assumptions made on the pharmacokinetic behaviour of 
sitagliptin as dose linearity, the influence of weight and the pre-specified range of 0.5 – 2.0 for clinical 
relevant differences are acceptable in comparison of the pharmacokinetic data.  
However, as the number of possible covariables, e.g. the issues mentioned above and the differences 
between protocols like site, country analytical method etc., in this comparison is rather large the value 
of this comparison is of low significance.

The conclusions of the applicant on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin in adolescent subjects were: 
•  Single oral doses of sitagliptin up to 200 mg are generally safe and well-tolerated in 10 to 17 
year old adolescent patients with T2DM. 
•  Adolescent patients with T2DM treated with single doses of sitagliptin have an approximately 
18% lower AUC0-∞ as compared to adult patients with T2DM but this difference is not thought 
to be clinically meaningful. 
•  Adolescent patients with T2DM treated with a 200 mg single dose of sitagliptin have an 
approximately 4% higher Cmax and 26% lower C24hr compared to adult patients with T2DM 
treated with a 200 mg single dose of sitagliptin. 
Assessors Comments 
Considering the results from this study the conclusions of the applicant can be endorsed.

In adolescent subjects, despite the fact of the drawbacks of this study (parallel design, low number of 
subjects in each group, multi centre, long period of the study) the results showed acceptable variability 
and an acceptable comparison with the historical adult characteristics could be made. 
In adolescent patients the pharmacokinetics showed also linear relationship with the dose with respect 
to the extent of absorption and a small deviation with respect to the rate of absorption. This is also in 
accordance with the data in adult patients. 
In Conclusion 
The exposure to sitagliptin in addolescent patients older than 10 years of age is considered not 
clinically significantly different from the exposure in adult patients. 
2.2.  Pharmacodynamics  
Blood samples for determination of plasma DPP-4 activity were collected predose and at selected time 
points through 72 hours postdose in all Panels.  
DPP-4 enzyme activity was assessed in plasma by measuring the release of paranitroanaline (pNA) 
from the added substrate glylcyl-prolyl-paranitroaniline (Gly-PropNA). 
The change in absorbance at 390 nm was determined at 30 second intervals over 20 minutes. The 
enzyme activity was defined as the slope (in mOD/min) from 4 to 14 minutes. The LLOQ for the DPP-4 
assay was 0.6 mOD/min. 
Percent Inhibition of Plasma DDP-4 Activity after sitagliptin 
The geometric mean (± standard error) for % inhibition of DPP-4 activity after administration of 
sitagliptin 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg or placebo is depicted in Figure 11-8.

Exploratory PK/PD Analysis 
Time-matched DPP-4 inhibition and plasma concentration data were evaluated in an exploratory PK/PD 
analysis. Plotting the data (Figure 11-31) demonstrates that DPP-4 inhibition vs. plasma concentration  
follows a sigmoidal curve. An exploratory Emax model was fit to the adolescent data, shown with a 
dashed line. The estimated IC50 from this analysis was 25.4 +/- 1.5 nM. A similar analysis was 
performed with data generated in healthy adult subjects from protocol 001 and 002, receiving single 
oral doses of sitagliptin ranging from 1.5 to 600 mg. The estimated IC50 for adults in this previous 
study was 25.7 +/- 0.7 nM [16.1.12.46]. The Emax model fit for adults from P001/P002 is shown in 
Figure 11-31 with a solid gray line. 
The PK/PD relationship between sitagliptin plasma concentration and DPP-4 inhibition was similar 
between adolescents and adults. The(modest) reduction in plasma sitagliptin exposure in adolescents 
translated to differences in plasma DPP-4 inhibition which were most marked at 24-hours post-dose. A 
single dose of 100 mg sitagliptin in healthy adult subjects achieves ~ 75% trough inhibition and ~ 
83% change from placebo in weighted average inhibition (historical data from study MK-0431-
PN001/002). The steady state trough DPP-4 inhibition in adults for 100 mg sitagliptin increases to 
~80% following multiple dosing. 
That a single dose of 100 mg sitagliptin in adolescent patients achieves a numerically lower placebo-
adjusted DPP-4 inhibition, both on Day 1 "trough" inhibition (59.2%) and on weighted average 
inhibition (73.8%), reflects the small but observable differences in PK between adolescents and adults. 
However, it should be realised that this is a cross study comparison. In adults, sitagliptin dose-related 
reductions in trough DPP-4 inhibition have translated into only small differences in glycemic efficacy 
(historical data from MK-0431, PN001,PN002, PN014,  PN07).

Assessor’s comments: 
Considering the results of this pharmacodynamic study on the inhibition of DPP-4 activity the 
conclusions of applicant are endorsed.  
The pharmacodynamic effects of sitagliptin were evaluated further in an exploratory fashion. Plasma 
glucose, glucagon, insulin, C-peptide and GLP-1 (active and total) concentrations were measured in the 
context of an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) administered 2 hours postdose, and/or in the context 
of a standardized meal administered 4 hours postdose. 
Glucose 
The LS mean with corresponding 95% CI for plasma glucose concentrations (mg/dL) after single dose 
administration of sitagliptin 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg and placebo are given in Figure 11-11.

Mean plasma glucose after sitagliptin wasa numerically lower than placebo over 72 hours. 
2 Hours Post-OGTT Weighted Mean Glucose (WMG) 
The LS mean (with 95% CIs) for plasma glucose concentrations (mg/dL) through 2 hours post OGTT, 
after administration of sitagliptin 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg and placebo, are in Figure 11-12. The 
summary statistics and comparisons with placebo for the 2-hour post-OGTT weighted mean glucose 
concentration are provided in Table 11-14. 
The differences (sitagliptin - placebo) and 95% CI for the 2-hour post-OGTT weighted mean glucose 
concentration were -15.75 (-79.75, 48.27) mg/dL (-0.87 (-4.43, 2.68) mmol/L) for sitagliptin 50 mg, -

48.17 (-112.18, 15.84) mg /dL (-2.67 (-6.23, 0.88) mmol/L) for sitagliptin 100 mg, and -42.48 (-
108.35, 23.38) mg/dL (-2.36 (-6.01, 1.30) mmol/L) for sitagliptin 200 mg. 
The magnitude of the mean sitagliptin effect on post-OGTT WMG was smallest for the 50-mg dose, and 
larger for the 100- and 200-mg doses. 
Glucagon 
Mean plasma glucagon concentrations following the OGTT are given in Table 11-17. Mean plasma 
glucagon is similar between placebo and 50-mg sitagliptin, but lower for sitagliptin 100- and 200-mg 
doses. 
Insulin 
The summary statistics and comparisons with placebo for the 2-hour post-OGTT weighted mean insulin 
concentration are provided in Table 11-19.  
The differences (sitagliptin - placebo) and 95% CI for the 2-hour post-OGTT weighted mean insulin 
concentration were 75.25 (-49.22, 199.72) microIU/mL (522 (-341.86, 1387.04) pmol/L), 26.42 (-
101.41, 152.25) microIU/mL (183.47 (-704.30, 1071.25) pmol/L) and 46.99 (-90.42, 184.40)

microIU/mL (326.34 (-627.99, 1280.66) pmol/L), respectively, for 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg 
sitagliptin. 
For the 2 hour period following the OGTT, the weighted mean insulin was greater than placebo for all 
three doses of sitagliptin. 
GLP-1

comparisons with placebo for the 2-hour post-OGTT weighted mean active GLP-1 concentration are 
provided in Table 11-23.  
The GMRs (sitagliptin / placebo) and 95% CI for the 2-hour post-OGTT weighted average active GLP-1 
concentration were 3.24 (1.81, 5.80), 2.38 (1.33, 4.25) and 1.89 (1.04, 3.43), respectively, for 
sitagliptin 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg.

2.2.1.  Assessor’s overall conclusion on pharmacodynamics 
This is a single-dose, placebo-controlled, double-blind in adolescents with T2DM. The term 
“adolescents” is used to refer to the 10-17 year old pediatric patient. The pharmacodynamic data in 
adolescents are consistent with those previously demonstrated in adults.  
Based on the observed PK profile following single doses of 200 mg, increasing the daily sitagliptin dose 
in adolescents to above 100 mg in order to closely match adult trough DPP-4 inhibition would be 
accompanied by a sitagliptin Cmax in adolescents exceeding that associated with the usual 100 mg 
daily dose in adults. This daily dose exceeding 100 mg could induce risks in this vulnerable pediatric 
population.  
Therefore, as based on the data presented, the balance of evidence indicates that 100 mg sitagliptin 
per day should be the dose for adolescent patients to be enrolled in Phase III studies. 
3.  Clinical safety 
3.1.  Assessor’s overall conclusions on clinical safety 
Discussion on clinical safety 
All 35 patients were included in the assessment of safety and tolerability. Eight (8) patients reported a 
total of 18 clinical AEs (13 while on sitagliptin, 5 while on placebo), none of which was serious. Six (6) 
of the 18 clinical AEs were considered possibly related to study drug by the Investigator. 
Seventeen (17) of the 18 reported clinical AEs were rated by the Investigator to be mild in intensity, 
and one was reported to be moderate in intensity (AN 0025, infusion site pain). All patients recovered 
from their adverse experiences. 
There were no laboratory adverse experiences, serious adverse experiences (AEs) or deaths reported 
in this study. No patients were discontinued from the study due to an adverse experience. There were 
no consistent treatment-related changes in laboratory, vital sign, or ECG safety parameters. 
Conclusions on clinical safety 
In this single-dose, placebo-controlled, double-blind in adolescents with T2DM sitagliptin was safe and 
well tolerated. However, it should be noted that this is an exploratory PK/PD study of short duration. 
4.  Overall conclusion 
As a corollary to the follow-up measures FUM 006 for Januvia/Xelevia and FUM 004 for Tesavel the 
clinical study report: “A single-dose study to assess the Pharmacokinetics, Safety and Tolerablity of 
Sitagliptin in Adolescents” has been sumitted. This is a single dose, placebo-controlled, double-blind 
study in adolescents with T2DM. 
The exposure to sitagliptin in adolescents is clinically not significantly different from the exposure in 
adult patients.

assessing the ability of fosnetupitant to inhibit all 
UGTs of interest: UGT1A1, 1A3, 1A4, 1A6, 1A9, and 
2B7 following a recommendation from the CHMP. 
Update of section 4.5 of the SmPC in order to include 
a warning on the concomitant use of fosnetupitant 
with oral substrates of UGT2B7/UGT2B15. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
UGT2B15. Similar to concomitant use of netupitant with 
oral substrates of UGT2B7 (e.g. zidovudine, valproic acid, 
morphine) caution is recommended when fosnetupitant is 
combined with such medicines.

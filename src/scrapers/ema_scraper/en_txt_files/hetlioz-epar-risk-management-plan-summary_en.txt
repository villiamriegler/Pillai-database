Summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Hetlioz 
(tasimelteon) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Hetlioz, which details the measures to be 
taken in order to ensure that Hetlioz is used as safely as possible. For more information on RMP 
summaries, see here. 
This RMP summary should be read in conjunction with the EPAR summary and the product information 
for Hetlioz, which can be found on Hetlioz’s EPAR page. 
Overview of disease epidemiology 
Hetlioz (tasimelteon) is a medicine used to treat non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder in totally blind 
adults. Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder is a condition that occurs almost exclusively in people who 
are completely blind, where patients have sleep patterns that are not synchronised with day and night 
and often follow a cycle that is longer than the standard 24-hour clock. As a result, patients fall asleep 
and wake up at different times compared with the general population. 
In Europe, between 1 and 4 per 1,000 people are blind and 10% of these will be considered to be 
totally blind (i.e. people who do not have any light perception). Between 50 and 70% of totally blind 
people are expected to have non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder. In the EU, the prevalence of non-24-
hour sleep-wake disorder is therefore estimated to be not more than 3.3 per 10,000 people. 
Summary of treatment benefits 
Hetlioz has been shown to be effective at helping patients adjust to the standard 24-hour clock in 2 
main studies.  
The first study, which involved a total of 84 totally blind patients with non-24-hour sleep-wake 
disorder, compared Hetlioz with placebo (a dummy treatment). The main measure of effectiveness was 
the percentage of patients who were able to adjust to the 24-hour clock, which was calculated by 
looking at how the amount of melatonin breakdown products changed in the patient’s urine over time. 
20% of patients who received Hetlioz (8 out of 40) were able to adjust to the 24-hour clock after 6 
months of treatment, compared with around 3% of patients on placebo (1 out of 38). 
In the second study, 57 patients first received Hetlioz for around 11 weeks. Those patients who were 
able to adjust to the 24-hour clock (20 patients in total) were then given Hetlioz or placebo for a 
further 8 weeks to study how well the effect of Hetlioz was maintained. Of the 10 patients who 
remained on Hetlioz, 9 people remained adjusted to 24-hour clock at the end of the study, compared 
with 2 of the 10 patients who were switched to placebo. 
Unknowns relating to treatment benefits 
Patients under the age of 18 years were not included in clinical studies with Hetlioz and the effect of 
the medicine in these patients is therefore not known. The effect of Hetlioz when used in pregnancy or 
breastfeeding is also not known.

Missing information 
Risk 
What is known 
Use in patients under 18 years 
Clinical studies with Hetlioz have not included patients under 18 
of age 
years of age and so currently the effect and safety of the medicine 
in these patients is not known. Studies are planned to investigate 
Hetlioz use in children with non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder. 
Use in elderly 
There is limited information regarding the use of Hetlioz in elderly 
patients and thus safety in these patients is not well established. 
Use in pregnancy and 
breastfeeding women 
There are no data on the use of Hetlioz in pregnant and 
breastfeeding women and so it is not known if Hetlioz has any 
effect on the unborn child or the breast-fed infant. However, tests 
in animals have shown that Hetlioz has not produced any 
abnormalities in offspring apart from reduced weight. 
Long-term use  
In clinical studies, 111 patients used Hetlioz for one year and 36 for 
2 years. Thus there are limited data on the long-term use of

What is known 
Hetlioz. 
Off-label (unapproved) use 
Hetlioz is only approved for patients with non-24-hour sleep-wake 
disorder in totally blind adults. Medicines that are chemically similar 
to Hetlioz have been approved for other disorders but such uses are 
outside of the approved indication for Hetlioz. 
Summary of risk minimisation measures by safety concern 
All medicines have a summary of product characteristics (SmPC) which provides physicians, 
pharmacists and other healthcare professionals with details on how to use the medicine, and also 
describes the risks and recommendations for minimising them. Information for patients is available in 
lay language in the package leaflet. The measures listed in these documents are known as ‘routine risk 
minimisation measures’. 
The SmPC and the package leaflet are part of the medicine’s product information. The product 
information for Hetlioz can be found on Hetlioz’s EPAR page. 
This medicine has no additional risk minimisation measures.

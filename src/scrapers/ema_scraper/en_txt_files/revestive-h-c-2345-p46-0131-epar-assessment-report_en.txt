1.  Introduction 
On 02 May 2022, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Revestive (teduglutide), in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study SHP633-305 is part of a clinical development program.  
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Teduglutide [rDNA origin] is an analog of naturally occurring human glucagon-like peptide-2, a peptide 
secreted by L-cells of the distal intestine. Teduglutide under the trade name Revestive® first received 
marketing authorization in the European Union via a centralized procedure for the treatment of short 
bowel syndrome (SBS) on 30 Aug 2012. On 29 Jun 2016, the European Commission granted an 
extension of the market authorization for teduglutide (Revestive) for the treatment of patients aged 1 
year and above with SBS. 
The investigational product (IP) was teduglutide, which was provided in 3 mL vials containing 5 mg or 
1.25 mg teduglutide as a white lyophilized powder that was reconstituted using 0.5 mL sterile water 
for injection. The formulation also contained L-histidine, mannitol, monobasic sodium phosphate 
monohydrate, and dibasic sodium phosphate as excipients. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH has submitted the results of SHP633-305, a study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
teduglutide in a population of Japanese paediatric subjects with SBS and who were dependent on 
parenteral support (PS). 
SHP633-305 was a Phase 3, prospective, open-label, long-term extension study that was conducted to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of teduglutide in a population of Japanese paediatric subjects with SBS 
who completed Study SHP633-302 (core study).

Description 
Methods 
Study participants 
Subjects who previously received teduglutide and completed the core study were eligible for this 
extension study. Eligibility for teduglutide treatment was assessed separately. Subjects could 
participate in multiple no-teduglutide treatment (NTT) periods and/or multiple 28-week teduglutide 
treatment cycles depending on the disease course. 
Treatments 
The investigational product (IP) was teduglutide, which was provided in 3 mL vials containing 5 mg or 
1.25 mg teduglutide as a white lyophilized powder that was reconstituted using 0.5 mL sterile water 
for injection. The formulation also contained L-histidine, mannitol, monobasic sodium phosphate 
monohydrate, and dibasic sodium phosphate as excipients. 
After screening, subjects who met at least 1 of the teduglutide treatment inclusion criteria and none of 
the teduglutide treatment exclusion criteria were eligible for teduglutide treatment if the investigator 
and the subject (and/or parent/guardian) agreed to proceed with teduglutide treatment.

A schematic representation of the study design is presented in Figure 1. 
Objective(s) 
To evaluate the safety and efficacy of teduglutide in a population of Japanese paediatric subjects with 
SBS and who were dependent on parenteral support (PS) 
Outcomes/endpoints and measurements 
The analyses of weekly PS volume were based on 2 data sources: each subject’s diary data and the 
investigator-prescribed data. The diary weekly PS volume was calculated based on the daily diary 
volumes within 7 days prior to each scheduled visit. Investigator-prescribed data were captured from 
electronic case report forms. 
Treatment-emergent adverse events were defined as any adverse events (AEs) whose onset occurred, 
severity worsened, or intensity increased after receiving the IP in the core study or this extension 
study. 
The investigator conducted the prespecified examinations, observations, and evaluations at the 
designated time points shown in Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3. 
Subjects who dropped out of the study prior to the final visit had all early termination procedures 
performed, whenever possible.

Assessor´s comments 
The MAH has submitted the results of SHP633-305, a study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
teduglutide in a population of Japanese paediatric subjects with SBS and who were dependent on 
parenteral support (PS). SHP633-305 was a Phase 3, prospective, open-label, long-term extension 
study that was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of teduglutide in a population of Japanese 
paediatric subjects with SBS who completed Study SHP633-302 (core study). 
Subjects who previously received teduglutide and completed the core study were eligible for this 
extension study. Eligibility for teduglutide treatment was assessed separately. Subjects could 
participate in multiple no-teduglutide treatment (NTT) periods and/or multiple 28-week teduglutide 
treatment cycles depending on the disease course. 
The investigational product (IP) was teduglutide, which was provided in 3 mL vials containing 5 mg or 
1.25 mg teduglutide. 
The MAH is asked to clarify the age-limits selected and the number of patients in each age-group 
included in study SHP633-005 (extension).  Furthermore, as only Japanese paediatric subjects were 
included the present study, the MAH should discuss the contribution of data from the Japanese 
paediatric population with respect to extrapolation to the general paediatric population e.g. in by 
integrating covariate information on race in the Pop PK model previously presented (OC).

Baseline data 
Demographics and Baseline Characteristics: 
The disposition of the subjects in the Safety population is summarized in Table 4. One subject 
received teduglutide in the core study and is counted in the Safety Population, despite the subject not 
receiving teduglutide in this extension study. This subject had achieved enteral autonomy at Week 12 
of the core study and has maintained it; this subject was monitored in the NTT periods of the study to 
provide safety data. Of the 7 total children who received IP treatment, 1 discontinued treatment due to 
a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE), but all children completed the study. Both infants were 
treated with IP; 1 discontinued the study due to a TEAE. 
The mean (± standard deviation) age of the total children was 6.70 (±3.754) years at the beginning of 
the core study, and males accounted for 85.7% (6 of 7 subjects).

The mean corrected gestational age of the total infant cohort enrolled at the beginning of the core 
study was 9.95 ±1.202 months, with 1 infant of each sex.

In total children, the mean duration of SBS was 6.66 ±3.737 years. The main underlying cause of SBS 
was midgut volvulus (6 subjects [85.7%]). The mean remaining small intestine length was 22.00 
±17.056 cm. The children had at least 30% of their colon remaining, with a mean of 90.00 ±26.458%, 
and none had a stoma. Five of the 7 total children (71.4%) had a distal or terminal ileum and 4 
(80.0%) retained an ileocecal valve. In the 2 infants, the mean duration of SBS was 10.66 ±1.928 
months (approximately since birth).

The main underlying cause of SBS was midgut volvulus for 1 infant and congenital absence of the 
midgut for the other. Neither infant had a stoma. The mean remaining small intestine length was 6.00 
±5.657 cm. One infant had 50% of the colon remaining, and the other had 100%. One infant had a 
distal or terminal ileum and retained an ileocecal valve. 
Assessor´s comments  
The mean (± standard deviation) age of the total children was 6.70 (±3.754) years at the beginning of 
the core study, and males accounted for 85.7% (6 of 7 subjects).  
The MAH is asked to present demographic and baseline data more detailed:  
a)  The MAH is asked to add individual age specific data on all subjects in the Table 4 
b)  The MAH is asked to add median and range for all parameters in table 8 and 9 
(OC). 
Efficacy results 
The MAH states that generally, no remarkable discrepancy between the diary and prescribed-based 
data was found in efficacy endpoints. The diary data were considered a more representative measure 
of efficacy than the investigator-prescribed data by the MAH; therefore, the efficacy summary focuses 
on the diary data results. As the tabulated data indicate, the number of subjects participating in each 
treatment cycle decreased, such that only 3 of the total children cohort had data for Cycle 5, 2 for 
Cycle 6, and only 1 had data for Cycles 7, 8, and 9. 
Change From Core Study Baseline in Parenteral Support 
Change in Weekly Parenteral Support Volume from Baseline Based on Subject  
Diary Data 
The diary data are presented by cycle in Table 5. 
In total children (n=7), the mean diary PS volume at core study baseline was 61.5 ±33.57 mL/kg/day. 
The mean change from baseline at end of treatment (EOT) of Cycle 1 was -21.5 ±11.83 mL/kg/day 
(median= -25.3 mL/kg/day) or -39.6 ±34.86%. The Week 28 mean percentage change from baseline 
for Cycle 1 of -36.8% suggests that clinically meaningful reduction was mostly maintained during the 
4-week untreated follow-up period from EOT to Week 28. 
In infants (n=2), the mean diary PS volume at core study baseline was 99.7 ±5.56 mL/kg/day.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/514430/2021  
Page 14/47 
 
 
 
 
The mean change from baseline at EOT of Cycle 1 was -31.9 ±16.24 mL/kg/day or -32.5 ±18.10%, 
which is similar to that for total children in Cycle 1. 
The data for subsequent treatment cycles indicate a trend towards increasing IP efficacy, as reflected 
by increasing percentage decreases from baseline in mean diary PS volumes. This trend was evident 
for both total children and infants. The descriptive analysis of PS volume diary data is shown by cycle 
and visit for the safety population in SHP633-305 CSR. 
At Least 20% Reduction From Baseline in Parenteral Support Volume 
The results of the number and percentage of subjects who achieved at least a 20% reduction in 
weight-normalized PS volume at Cycle 1 time points based on diary and prescribed data are shown in 
Table 6. 
In total children, 2 subjects (33.3%) were recorded at Day 1 (initiation of this study) in the diary and 
prescribed data who achieved at least a 20% reduction in weight-normalized PS volume compared to 
baseline in the core study, and this increased to 4 subjects (66.7%) in diary data and 5 subjects 
(83.3%) in prescribed data as the visits progressed to the EOT in Cycle 1. These subjects maintained 
their status during the 4-week untreated follow-up period. 
Both infant subjects (100%) achieved at least a 20% reduction in weight-normalized PS volume at Day 
1 (initiation of this study) in diary data and 1 subject (50%) in prescribed data. 
For NTT periods, reduction in PS volume by visit based on diary/prescribed data is summarized in 
SHP633-305 CSR.

Achievement of Enteral Autonomy 
There were 2 subjects in the total children cohort that achieved enteral autonomy—1 subject sustained 
from the core study and the second subject achieved enteral autonomy during the extension study. 
The SBS characteristics at baseline and the changes in PS volume at EOT by subject are summarized in 
Table 7. The number of subjects achieving enteral autonomy by cycle and visit are presented in 
SHP633-305 CSR and for diary data in SHP633-305 CSR. 
One child achieved enteral autonomy at Cycle 1 Week 4, which was sustained through Cycle 2 Week 
12. This subject had SBS due to intestinal atresia. The residual small bowel length was estimated at 
48 cm, with no distal or terminal ileum, no ileocecal valve, but 100% of colon remaining. 
The other child achieved enteral autonomy at Week 12 in the core study, did not receive teduglutide in 
this extension study, and maintained enteral autonomy during NTT periods. This subject had SBS due 
to midgut volvulus. The residual small bowel length was estimated at 25 cm, with distal or terminal 
ileum and ileocecal valve present and 100% of colon remaining. 
While both infants achieved the 20% milestone reduction in PS volume based on diary data, only 1 
achieved enteral autonomy. One subject achieved enteral autonomy at Cycle 4 Week 4, which was 
sustained for 28 days to the end of study participation. This subject had SBS due to midgut volvulus. 
The residual small bowel length was estimated at 10 cm, with distal or terminal ileum and ileocecal 
valve present and 100% of colon remaining.

a Age is shown as years for total children and for infants as age in months/corrected gestational age in months. 
b A subject was considered to have achieved enteral autonomy when the investigator prescribed no PS and there was 
no use of PS recorded in the diary during the 7 days prior to the visit, and sustained throughout the treatment 
period. 
c Achieved enteral autonomy in the core study at Week 12; sustained in this study. 
d Subject was enrolled preamendment 3 in the core study and preamendment 2 in this extension study, but 
approximately 80% of total enrolled days were postamendment. 
Note: End of treatment was defined as the last available measurement during the 24-week treatment period. 
Decrease of Number of Days Per Week in Parenteral Support Usage 
At core study baseline, all subjects had 7 days per week of PS usage. There were 2 total children who 
achieved enteral autonomy (Section 5.2.1.3). The mean results for change in days per week of PS 
usage for total children and infants are presented in Table 8. 
In total children, the mean change from baseline at EOT of each cycle based on diary data was -1.2 
±2.86 days/week for Cycles 1, 2, and 3; -1.4 ±3.13 days/week for Cycle 4; and 0.0 days/week for 
Cycles 5, 6, 7, and 8. The Week 28 mean change from baseline for Cycle 1 of -1.2 days/week suggests 
that the reduction was maintained during the 4-week untreated follow-up period from EOT to Week 28. 
In infants, the number of days per week in PS usage were not reduced until Cycle 4, when 1 infant 
achieved enteral autonomy. The other infant required PS 7 days/week both at baseline and throughout 
the study.

Change From Core Study Baseline in Parenteral Support 
Change in Weekly Parenteral Support Volume from Baseline Based on Subject  
Diary Data 
In total children (n=7), the mean diary PS volume at core study baseline was 61.5 ±33.57 mL/kg/day. 
The mean change from baseline at end of treatment (EOT) of Cycle 1 was -21.5 ±11.83 mL/kg/day 
(median= -25.3 mL/kg/day) or -39.6 ±34.86%. The Week 28 mean percentage change from baseline 
for Cycle 1 of -36.8% suggests that clinically meaningful reduction was mostly maintained during the 
4-week untreated follow-up period from EOT to Week 28. 
In infants (n=2), the mean diary PS volume at core study baseline was 99.7 ±5.56 mL/kg/day. 
The mean change from baseline at EOT of Cycle 1 was -31.9 ±16.24 mL/kg/day or -32.5 ±18.10%, 
which is similar to that for total children in Cycle 1. 
At Least 20% Reduction From Baseline in Parenteral Support Volume 
In total children, 2 subjects (33.3%) were recorded at Day 1 (initiation of this study) in the diary and 
prescribed data who achieved at least a 20% reduction in weight-normalized PS volume compared to 
baseline in the core study, and this increased to 4 subjects (66.7%) in diary data and 5 subjects 
(83.3%) in prescribed data as the visits progressed to the EOT in Cycle 1. These subjects maintained 
their status during the 4-week untreated follow-up period. 
Both infant subjects (100%) achieved at least a 20% reduction in weight-normalized PS volume at Day 
1 (initiation of this study) in diary data and 1 subject (50%) in prescribed data. 
Achievement of Enteral Autonomy 
There were 2 subjects in the total children cohort that achieved enteral autonomy—1 subject sustained 
from the core study and the second subject achieved enteral autonomy during the extension study.  
One infant achieved enteral autonomy. The subject chieved enteral autonomy at Cycle 4 Week 4, 
which was sustained for 28 days to the end of study participation. This subject had SBS due to midgut 
volvulus. The residual small bowel length was estimated at 10 cm, with distal or terminal ileum and 
ileocecal valve present and 100% of colon remaining. 
Decrease of Number of Days Per Week in Parenteral Support Usage 
In total children, the mean change from baseline at EOT of each cycle based on diary data was -1.2 
±2.86 days/week for Cycles 1, 2, and 3; -1.4 ±3.13 days/week for Cycle 4; and 0.0 days/week for 
Cycles 5, 6, 7, and 8. The Week 28 mean change from baseline for Cycle 1 of -1.2 days/week suggests 
that the reduction was maintained during the 4-week untreated follow-up period from EOT to Week 28. 
In infants, the number of days per week in PS usage were not reduced until Cycle 4, when 1 infant 
achieved enteral autonomy. The other infant required PS 7 days/week both at baseline and throughout 
the study.

In SHP633-302, administration of teduglutide appeared to reduce PS in Japanese children and infants 
with SBS in line with previously submitted data. The MAH is asked to discuss whether the results 
presented add any new age-specific knowledge in treatment of infants and/or children with SBS, 
whether or not intended for inclusion in the SmPC and/or Risk Management Plan (OC). 
Safety results 
Exposure 
The summary of exposure to teduglutide is shown in Table 9. In total, the mean duration of overall 
exposure to teduglutide, including core study exposure, was 123.16 ±60.582 weeks (range: 24.0 to 
223.0 weeks). All 7 subjects in the total children cohort had at least 24 weeks of treatment. One 
subject achieved enteral autonomy at Week 12 in the core study, did not receive teduglutide in this 
extension study, and maintained enteral autonomy during NTT periods. In infants, the mean duration 
of overall exposure to teduglutide was 70.14 ±45.861 weeks;1 infant received teduglutide treatment 
for 37.7 weeks and the other for 102.6 weeks. 
Adverse Events 
Treatment Emergent Adverse Events 
Treatment-emergent adverse events were defined as any adverse events (AEs) whose onset occurred, 
severity worsened, or intensity increased after receiving the IP in the core study or this extension 
study. Adverse events recorded in the core study are not summarized in this report. An overview of 
TEAEs reported from all subjects in the safety population is presented in Table 10. 
In total children, 164 TEAEs were reported in 7 subjects (100%). Of those, 5 TEAEs were related to 
teduglutide treatment in 4 subjects (57.1%). All TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. A total of 34 
treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs) were noted in 7 subjects (100.0%); none were

teduglutide related. No subject experienced a TEAE leading to study discontinuation. No deaths or 
TEAEs of special interest were reported. 
A total of 34 TEAEs were reported in both infants, of which 9 were TESAEs. Most TEAEs experienced in 
infants were mild or moderate in severity. There were 2 severe TESAEs. 
One subject had a severe TESAE of pancreatitis acute, and the IP was withdrawn. 
Another subject had a severe TESAE of central catheter infection. There were no teduglutide-related 
TEAEs, deaths, or TEAEs of special interest. 
Two TEAEs led to IP discontinuation; 1 was the pancreatitis TESAE with permanent IP discontinuation, 
and the other was an interruption of IP dosing  for 2 days due to catheter issues.

The incidence of TEAEs by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) is summarized in Table 
11. For readability, the table has been sorted by decreasing incidence in the total children group. 
As stated above, there were 164 TEAEs in 7 total children (100.0%) and 34 TEAEs in 2 infants 
(100.0%). 
In children, the SOCs with the highest percentage of subjects reporting TEAEs were Gastrointestinal 
disorders (100.0%), Infections and infestations (85.7%), Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
(85.7%), Product issues (71.4%), and Injury, poisoning and procedural complications (71.4%). 
The most frequently reported TEAEs by PT were viral upper respiratory tract infection (25 events in 4 
subjects [57.1%]), device breakage (8 events in 3 subjects [42.9%]), device related infection (6 
events in 4 subjects [57.1%]), enteritis (6 events in 2 subjects [28.6%]), dehydration (6 events in 2 
subjects [28.6%]), and metabolic acidosis (6 events in 1 subject [14.3%]). All of the device-related 
TEAEs were complications of central venous catheters used to prepare and administer PS, not the 
device used to prepare or administer teduglutide. 
In infants, the only SOCs reported in both subjects were Infections and infestations and Investigations. 
All TEAEs by PT were experienced by 1 infant.

Adverse Events by Relationship 
The incidence of TEAEs by relationship based on SOC and PT is shown in Table 12. In total children, 5 
treatment-related TEAEs were reported by 4 subjects (57.1%). These TEAEs were gastric disorder, 
injection site pain, lipase increased, skin induration, and eczema. No TEAEs related to teduglutide were 
reported in either infant.

Adverse Events by Severity 
All TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity for all subjects, except for 2 severe TESAEs. One subject 
had a severe TESAE of pancreatitis acute, and the IP was withdrawn. Another subject had a severe 
TESAE of central catheter infection. Neither TESAE was treatment related. 
Deaths 
There were no deaths during the study. 
Other Serious Adverse Events 
The incidence of TESAEs by SOC and PT is shown in Table 13. In total children, 34 TESAEs were 
reported in 7 subjects (100.0%). The TESAEs noted in at least 2 subjects by PT were device related 
infection (6 events in 4 subjects [57.1%]), device breakage (8 events in 3 subjects [42.9%]), and 
device damage (2 events in 2 subjects [28.6%]). All of the device-related TEAEs were considered as 
complications of central venous catheters used to prepare and administer PS, not the device used to 
prepare or administer teduglutide. No TESAEs were treatment related. 
All TESAEs were experienced by only 1 infant. A TESAE of acute pancreatitis was reported; IP 
treatment was interrupted, and study participation was subsequently discontinued). Other TESAEs 
reported by an infant subject included device related infection, gastroenteritis adenovirus, otitis media, 
upper respiratory tract infection, viral upper respiratory tract infection, device breakage, and seizure. 
No TESAEs in infants were treatment related.

Discontinuations Resulting From Adverse Events 
A female infant experienced a severe TESAE of acute pancreatitis in 2019, 306 days after initiating IP 
treatment. Investigational product treatment was interrupted and the subject subsequently 
discontinued from the study due to severe acute pancreatitis. The TESAE was not treatment related. 
Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
Chemistry 
Out-of-range high or low chemistry values were observed for most subjects for various chemistry tests 
at various visits. These results were not remarkable, except as discussed below. 
One subject experienced a treatment-related TEAE of blood lipase increased of moderate severity 
(Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Grade 4), which was ongoing at the end of the 
study). 
One subject had high amylase values for most of Cycles 1 through 9 and high aspartate 
aminotransferase and gamma glutamyl transferase values during Cycles 1 through 4. 
One subject had high alkaline phosphatase and amylase values for most of Cycles 1 through 6. 
One subject had high alanine aminotransferase and gamma glutamyl transferase values for most of 
Cycles 1 through 5. 
One subject had high alanine aminotransferase values for most of Cycles 1 through 4 and high 
triglycerides during Cycles 1, 2, and 4.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/514430/2021  
Page 30/47 
 
 
 
 
One infant subject had alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutamyl transferase, 
and lipase levels greater than 3 × the upper limit of normal (ULN) at most visits of Cycle 1, alanine 
aminotransferase levels of 2 to 3 × ULN at most visits of the study, and intermittent elevations of 
aspartate aminotransferase, amylase, and triglycerides. 
One TEAE of ALP increased, 1 of ALT increase, 1 of AST increased, and 1 of transaminases increased 
were reported as TEAEs. 
Hematology 
Out-of-range high or low hematology values were observed for most subjects for various hematology 
tests at various visits. These results were not remarkable during either period in any cycle except for 
one subject, who had an abnormally low platelet value of 62 ×109/L (normal range 140 to 450 
×109/L) at Cycle 2, Week 16 (Day 692). 
Coagulation 
Pretreatment coagulation testing included prothrombin international normalized ratio (INR) and 
prothrombin time. One subject had INR and prothrombin time values that were abnormally high at 
Cycles 1 through 9. 
Urinalysis 
Some subjects had tests that were out of range: one subject had high leukocytes at Cycle 1 EOT; one 
subject had high erythrocytes at baseline; and one subject had high leukocytes at baseline, Cycle 1 
Week 12, Cycle 1 Week 20, Cycle 2 Week 1, Cycle 3 Week 9, Cycle 3 Week 16, and Cycle 4 Week 4. 
These results were not remarkable. 
Pregnancy Testing 
There were no females of childbearing potential; pregnancy tests were not performed. 
Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety 
Vital Signs 
Overall, no clinically meaningful vital sign changes in pulse rate, blood pressure, or body temperature 
were reported in the study. 
Physical Examination Findings 
For all subjects, there were no new findings from physical examinations in the study. 
Z-scores For Body Weight, Height, Body Mass Index, and Head Circumference 
In children 1 to 15 years of age, no clinically meaningful changes in growth parameters, such as 
weight, height, BMI, or head circumference z-scores were reported, indicating that the reductions in PS 
due to teduglutide treatment were appropriately titrated to match the subjects’ nutritional needs. In 
the infants, weight gains were observed, indicating that improvements in nutrient absorption by the 
small intestine were not entirely captured by the reduction in PS calories. 
Antibodies to Teduglutide 
In Cycle 1 on Day 1, 1 child (16.7%) and 1 infant (50%) had ADAs detected prior to teduglutide 
dosing, which increased to up to 3 children and both infants at Week 12. However, at Week 28, the 
number had decreased to that of Day 1 again.

In subsequent cycles, the rates of positivity continued to trend in a similar fashion. On average, 
subjects who tested positive for ADAs, including the subjects with neutralizing ADAs, had sustained 
reduction from baseline in PS, and there was no association between ADAs and lack of efficacy. 
The 2 infants only completed Cycle 1, and 1 infant completed through Cycle 4. 
There were no reports of teduglutide-related hypersensitivity reaction in the subjects who tested ADA 
positive. No association between ADA status and hypersensitivity was noted.

Assessor´s comments  
In total children, the mean duration of overall exposure to teduglutide, including core study exposure, 
was 123.16 ±60.582 weeks (range: 24.0 to 223.0 weeks).  
In total children 164 TEAEs were reported in 7 subjects (100%). Of those, 5 TEAEs were related to 
teduglutide treatment in 4 subjects (57.1%). All TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. A total of 34 
treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs) were noted in 7 subjects (100.0%); none were 
teduglutide related. No subject experienced a TEAE leading to study discontinuation. No deaths or 
TEAEs of special interest were reported. 
A total of 34 TEAEs were reported in both infants, of which 9 were TESAEs. Most TEAEs experienced in 
infants were mild or moderate in severity. There were 2 severe TESAEs. 
One subject had a severe TESAE of pancreatitis acute, and the IP was withdrawn. 
One subject had a severe TESAE of central catheter infection. There were no teduglutide-related 
TEAEs, deaths, or TEAEs of special interest. Two TEAEs led to IP discontinuation.  
In children, the SOCs with the highest percentage of subjects reporting TEAEs were Gastrointestinal 
disorders (100.0%), Infections and infestations (85.7%), Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
(85.7%), Product issues (71.4%), and Injury, poisoning and procedural complications (71.4%). 
In infants, the only SOCs reported in both infants were Infections and infestations and Investigations. 
All TEAEs by PT were experienced by 1 infant. 
5 children and 1 infant experienced abnormally high value for enzymes, including alkaline 
phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma glutamyl transferase, 
amylase, and lipase over multiple treatment cycles. 
On average, subjects who tested positive for antidrug antibodies (ADAs), including the subjects with 
neutralizing ADAs, had sustained reduction from baseline in PS, and there was no association between 
ADAs and lack of efficacy. There were no reports of teduglutide-related hypersensitivity reaction in the 
subjects who tested ADA positive.  
The MAH states that children 1 to 15 years of age, no clinically meaningful changes in growth 
parameters. 
The MAH states that TEAEs reported in this study were generally consistent with the underlying disease 
and those reported in the core study and in previous studies of pediatric patients with SBS. However, 
the MAH is asked to describe the 1 case of pancreatitis TESAE in narratives (OC).

2.4.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The MAH has submitted the results of SHP633-305, a study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
teduglutide in a population of Japanese paediatric subjects with SBS and who were dependent on 
parenteral support (PS). SHP633-305 was a Phase 3, prospective, open-label, long-term extension 
study that was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of teduglutide in a population of Japanese 
paediatric subjects with SBS who completed Study SHP633-302 (core study).  
Subjects who previously received teduglutide and completed the core study were eligible for this 
extension study. Eligibility for teduglutide treatment was assessed separately. Subjects could 
participate in multiple no-teduglutide treatment (NTT) periods and/or multiple 28-week teduglutide 
treatment cycles depending on the disease course. 
The investigational product (IP) was teduglutide, which was provided in 3 mL vials containing 5 mg or 
1.25 mg teduglutide. 
The MAH is asked to clarify the age-limits selected and the number of patients in each age-group 
included in both study SHP633-002 (core) and -005 (extension). Furthermore, as only Japanese 
paediatric subjects were included the present study, the MAH should discuss the selection and use of 
data from this paediatric population with respect to the modelling and extrapolation exercise in the 
ongoing variation II-54 (OC). 
The mean (± standard deviation) age of the total children was 6.70 (±3.754) years at the beginning of 
the core study, and males accounted for 85.7% (6 of 7 subjects). The MAH is asked to present 
demographic and baseline data more detailed (OC). 
In SHP633-302, administration of teduglutide appeared to reduce PS in Japanese children and infants 
with SBS in line with previously submitted data. The MAH is asked to discuss whether the results 
presented add any new age-specific knowledge in treatment of infants and/or children with SBS, 
whether or not intended for inclusion in the SmPC and/or Risk Management Plan (OC). 
The MAH states that TEAEs reported in this study were generally consistent with the underlying disease 
and those reported in the core study and in previous studies of pediatric patients with SBS. However, 
the MAH is asked to describe the 1 case of pancreatitis TESAE in narratives (OC). 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
On 29 Jun 2016, the European Commission granted an extension of the market authorization for 
teduglutide (Revestive) for the treatment of patients aged 1 year and above with SBS. In the present 
application, the MAH has submitted the results of SHP633-305, a study to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of teduglutide in a population of Japanese paediatric subjects with SBS and who were 
dependent on parenteral support (PS). The MAH claims that the benefit-risk profile for teduglutide 
remains favorable and unchanged and that there are no regulatory consequences identified by the 
marketing authorization holder as consequence of study. However, before final approval, four other 
concerns have to be solved, please refer to RSI in section 4.  
  Not fulfilled: 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide response to the additional clarifications 
requested per study as part of this procedure. (see section “Request for supplementary information”)

4.  Request for supplementary information 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this 
procedure: 
Other concerns: 
1.  The MAH is asked to clarify the age-limits selected and the number of patients in each age-
group included in study SHP633-005 (extension).  Furthermore, as only Japanese paediatric 
subjects were included the present study, the MAH should discuss the contribution of data 
from the Japanese pediatric population with respect to extrapolation to the general pediatric 
population e.g. in by integrating covariate information on race in the Pop PK model previously 
presented (OC).” 
2.  The mean (± standard deviation) age of the total children was 6.70 (±3.754) years at the 
beginning of the core study, and males accounted for 85.7% (6 of 7 subjects).

5.  Assessment of MAH responses to Request for 
supplementary information 
Other Concerns 
Question 1 
The MAH is asked to clarify the age-limits selected and the number of patients in each age-group 
included in study SHP633-305 (extension). Furthermore, as only Japanese paediatric subjects were 
included in the present study, the MAH should discuss the contribution of data from the Japanese 
paediatric population with respect to extrapolation to the general paediatric population e.g. by 
integrating covariate information on race in the Pop PK model previously presented. 
MAH`s Response 
All subjects in Study SHP633-305 were rolled over from Study SHP633-302. The results of Study 
SHP633-302 were evaluated by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) through the procedure number 
EMA/H/C/002345/P46/10, approved on 28 January 2021 and were also part of the support 
documentation for the grouped Type II variation requesting the extension of indication to patients from 
4 months of corrected gestational age, submitted to the EMA via procedure number 
EMEA/H/C/002345/II/0054/G and which is currently ongoing. Procedure number 
EMEA/H/C/002345/II/0054/G also included the interim results of Study SHP633-305. The subjects 
from Study SHP633-302 were included in the pharmacokinetic (PK) datasets for the formal population 
PK analyses (PPK), submitted with procedure EMEA/H/C/002345/II/0053 and 
EMEA/H/C/002345/II/0054/G. As such, there were no predetermined age limits or number of subjects 
in each age group for this extension study (SHP633-305). The core study (SHP633-302) plan was to 
enroll a minimum of 5 subjects aged 1 through 15 years and a minimum of 2 subjects of 4 through 
less than 12 months of age. The actual enrollment in this core study included 8 Japanese pediatric 
subjects aged 1 through 15 years and 2 infants aged 4 through less than 12 months. Additionally, no 
PK samples were collected in Study SHP633-305 in the subjects rolled over from Study SHP633-302. 
As such, no subjects from Study SHP633-305 were included in the PPK. The corresponding PPK 
reports, submitted also with sequence 0144, procedure EMEA/H/C/002345/II/0053, are linked for your 
reference in this response (SHIR-CSC-129-PKglobal; SHIR-CSC-129-Japanese). Age distributions at 
baseline for subjects in Study SHP633-302 were provided in Appendix 11.6 of the PPK report (SHIR-
CSC-129-PKglobal). Further, the MAH has formally evaluated the potential effect of race on PK 
between Japanese and global pediatrics in the PPK. The results confirmed a lack of race differences in 
PK of teduglutide between the populations (SHIR-CSC-129-Japanese).

Assessment of the Applicant’s Response 
The MAH states that all subjects in Study SHP633-305 were rolled over from Study SHP633-302. The 
subjects from Study SHP633-302 were included in the pharmacokinetic (PK) datasets for the formal 
population PK analyses (PPK). There were no predetermined age limits or number of subjects in each 
age group for the extension study (SHP633-305). The core study (SHP633-302) plan was to enroll a 
minimum of 5 subjects aged 1 through 15 years and a minimum of 2 subjects of 4 through less than 
12 months of age. The actual enrollment in this core study included 8 Japanese paediatric subjects 
aged 1 through 15 years and 2 infants aged 4 through less than 12 months. Additionally, no PK 
samples were collected in Study SHP633-305 in the subjects rolled over from Study SHP633-302. As 
such, no subjects from Study SHP633-305 were included in the PPK. Furthermore, the MAH states 
previous submitted PK analysis revealed no race differences in PK of teduglutide between the 
populations (SHIR-CSC-129-Japanese). This is accepted. 
Conclusion 
The issue has not been solved but will not be further pursued. 
Question 2 
The mean (± standard deviation) age of the total children was 6.70 (±3.754) years at the beginning of 
the core study, and males accounted for 85.7% (6 of 7 subjects). 
The MAH is asked to present demographic and baseline data more detailed: 
a)  The MAH is asked to add individual age specific data on all subjects in Table 4. 
b)  The MAH is asked to add median and range for all parameters in Tables 8 and 9. 
MAH`s Response 
a)  Table 4 of the clinical study report (CSR; provided below) provides individual age-specific 
enrollment and disposition data for subjects receiving teduglutide. 
b)  The requested data for Table 8 and Table 9 were provided in SHP633-305 CSR, but are also 
provided below (red font) for convenience for the parameters where median and range are 
applicable (exceptions are sex, race, reason for diagnosis, answers to questions). Note that 
since there were only 2 infants, the mean and median values are the same and the age range 
corresponds to the age of each infant.

Question 3 
The MAH is asked to discuss whether the results presented add any new age-specific knowledge in 
treatment of infants and/or children with SBS, whether or not intended for inclusion in the SmPC 
and/or Risk Management Plan. 
MAH`s Response 
On 27 July 2021, the MAH submitted a grouped Type II variation to request the extension of indication 
to patients from 4 months by corrected gestational age. The variation included as support 
documentation the study results from 2 core studies (SHP633-301, SHP633-302) and 2 extension 
long-term safety and efficacy studies (SHP633-304, SHP633-305). 
Study SHP633-305 was still ongoing at the time of submission. The Type II variation is still under 
evaluation with the EMA via procedure number EMEA/H/C/002345/II/0054/G. The data showed 
sustained efficacy of teduglutide in infants and children from the core through the extension studies. In 
addition, these data are consistent with the data from the adult population. The nature and frequency 
of the adverse events reported in this study were similar in nature to those observed in the core study 
and in previous pediatric studies of teduglutide. 
Furthermore, Study 305 showed that teduglutide was generally safe and well tolerated in children with 
SBS who were treated for a mean of 123.16 weeks and infants with SBS who were treated for a mean 
of 70.14 weeks in the core study and in this extension study. Based on the results of long-term Studies 
SHP633-305 and other studies, the MAH plans to propose removal of the “Missing Information: Long-
term safety in the paediatric population” from the European Union Risk Management Plan (EU-RMP) at 
the next opportunity.

The subject is a girl with SBS. She completed the preceding Study SHP633-302 and started treatment 
with 0.05 mg/kg/day of teduglutide on 2019 in Study SHP633-305. 
Pancreatitis Acute 
In 2019, the subject had an episode. She was admitted to the hospital for vomiting that resulted from 
certain condition, which was her concomitant disease. Adjustment of her therapy was initiated. 
In 2019, her lipase level began to rise significantly to a high of 2328 IU/L (started 50 IU/L or below, 
353 IU/L the next day, and 173 IU/L the day after) associated with tachypnoea. Abdominal 
echocardiography and computed tomography (CT) were performed. Severe acute pancreatitis of 
second degree was considered. 
The subject was transferred to an intensive care unit for systemic management. Teduglutide dosing 
was suspended. A large volume of fluid replacement, and respiratory management with ventilator were 
started for deteriorated circulatory dynamics and acidosis. In addition, deep sedation with a muscle 
relaxant was performed for her unstable condition with muscle tightness and poor oxygenation. 
Treatment with an enzyme inhibitor was started for acute pancreatitis. 
On 2020 (day 0), the lipase level improved to 212 U/L and amylase dropped to 39 U/L. 
On day 1, treatment with the muscle relaxant was stopped and a drug was started. 
On day 5, the respiratory management with ventilator was stopped as her general condition improved. 
She received nasal high flow oxygen. 
On day 8, the therapy was changed to nasal oxygen with favorable oxygenation, then the therapy was 
stopped. Oxygen therapy was performed as appropriate depending on the oxygenation maintenance 
status. In addition, the enzyme inhibitor was discontinued due to drip leakage from the periphery. 
On day 10, the subject was transferred to the general pediatric ward as her general condition had 
stabilized. 
On day 17, her symptoms had stabilized and relieved after the transfer to the general pediatric ward. 
On day 19, her lipase and amylase levels were elevated again to 589 U/L and 81 U/L, respectively. 
However, abdominal ultrasound showed no findings suggestive of aggravation of pancreatitis. 
On day 20, her lipase level was remarkably increased to 1231 U/L, while abdominal CT showed no 
findings of pancreatitis. 
On day 21, her lipase and amylase levels were increased to 2440 U/L and 164 U/L, respectively. 
On day 28, her lipase and amylase levels were slightly decreased to 901 U/L and 60 U/L, respectively. 
On day 44, the enzyme inhibitor was resumed as the lipase level increased again to 2705 U/L. 
Abdominal echocardiography showed slight pancreatic enlargement with no findings of pancreatitis. 
On day 52, the treatment with the enzyme inhibitor was stopped as there had been no flare up of the 
pancreatitis. 
On day 76, the 2019 episode was considered to be resolved with sequelae. 
On day 82, abdominal CT showed that pancreatic enlargement remained, but it was improved with no 
flare up of pancreatitis. 
On day 121, her lipase level had remained within reference range with no flare up of pancreatitis since 
day 97. Her general condition was also stable. Thus, the subject recovered from the event and was 
eventually discharged from the hospital.

The outcome of pancreatitis acute was reported as recovered/resolved with the severity as severe, and 
the dosing of teduglutide was withdrawn. On causality, the investigator judged the event as not related 
to teduglutide based on the below findings: 
The subject was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis in 2019 with lipase level of 3000 U/L when a drug 
was administered; in the intensive care unit, the treatment of the drug and teduglutide were stopped, 
and lipase level improved immediately. However, the prior lipase value was increasing slightly without 
teduglutide, and the subject was being treated with the drug again. Therefore, the investigator 
considered that pancreatitis might be related to the other drug and not related to teduglutide. 
The company pharmacovigilance physician also assessed the events and acute pancreatitis as not 
related to teduglutide, in agreement with the investigator. The alternative explanation for the acute 
pancreatitis was worsening of the patient’s concomitant disease and underlying SBS. The acute 
pancreatitis occurred 10 days after the onset of worsening condition. Prolonged condition activity may 
increase intraduodenal pressure leading to the reflux of the duodenal contents into the pancreatic duct, 
altered metabolism of oxygen-derived free radicals, and hypoxia/ischemia resulting in pancreatic 
acinar cell injury. The concomitant medications alfacalcidol, famotidine, and other drugs might have 
been confounding factors.  
Assessment of the Applicant’s Response   
The MAH has described the 1 case of pancreatitis TESAE in infant subject, in narratives as requested. 
The subject is a girl with SBS. She completed the preceding Study SHP633-302 and started treatment 
with 0.05 mg/kg/day of teduglutide on 2019 in Study SHP633-305. On 2019, her lipase level began to 
rise significantly in 2019 to a high of 2328 IU/L (started on 50 IU/L or below, 353 IU/L on the next 
day, and 173 IU/L the day after) associated with tachypnoea. Abdominal echocardiography and 
computed tomography (CT) showed severe acute pancreatitis of second. The MAH suggest that the 
incident of acute pancreatitis was not related to teduglutide treatment but to prolonged event, leading 
to reflux of the duodenal contents into the pancreatic duct. This is questioned since acute pancreatitis 
is specified as a common adverse drug effects in the SmPC and due to the questionable temporal 
coincidences. The MAH is asked to address a possible risk of acute pancreatitis in the pediatric 
population adequately in the SmPC.

6.  Rapporteur’s updated overall conclusion and 
recommendation 
The MAH has submitted the results of SHP633-305 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of teduglutide in 
a population of Japanese paediatric subjects with SBS and who were dependent on parenteral support 
(PS). One other concern remains to be addressed, see section 7.

8.  Assessment of MAH responses to 2. Request for 
supplementary information 
Question 
1.  The MAH is asked to address a possible risk of acute pancreatitis in the pediatric population 
adequately in the SmPC. 
MAH’s Response 
Upon further review of the circumstances for the 1 treatment-emergent serious adverse event of 
pancreatitis in one subject and considering that pancreatitis is already a common adverse drug 
reaction of teduglutide, the MAH has reassessed the causality of acute pancreatitis as possibly related 
to the study medication and updated the safety database accordingly. However, an alternative 
explanation is the use of a medication, because following reintroduction of this medication, the level of 
lipase increased again (ie, positive rechallenge). 
Section 4.4 “Special warnings and precautions for use” of the SmPC already provides a cautionary 
statement about pancreatic diseases in both adults and pediatric populations for both the 1.25 mg and 
5 mg strengths of REVESTIVE. The analysis of the global safety database did not reveal any increased 
incidence of pancreatic events in the pediatric population. In particular, the analysis of available data in 
Study TED-R13-002, a prospective, multicenter registry for patients with SBS, as of the latest cutoff 
date of 30 Jun 2022 and comparing teduglutide “ever treated” and “never treated” cohorts, did not 
reveal any increase in the incidence of acute pancreatitis in children. 
Based on the above, the MAH considers that no further updates are needed to the REVESTIVE product 
information, as acute pancreatitis is sufficiently and adequately described in both Section 4.4 and 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC, for both adults and pediatric population and for both 1.25 mg and 5 mg 
strengths. 
Assessment of the Applicant’s Response 
The MAH states that upon further review of the circumstances for the 1 treatment-emergent serious 
adverse event of pancreatitis in one subject and considering that pancreatitis is already a common

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
This  extension  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation  for  RoActemra  concerns  a  new  pharmaceutical 
form  “solution  for  injection”,  a  new  strength  162  mg  with  two  new  presentations  pre-filled 
syringe and pre-filled pen and a new route of administration for subcutaneous use. 
Rheumatoid  arthritis  (RA)  is  a  progressive,  systemic  auto-immune  disease  characterised  by 
synovitis  that  damages  diarthroidal  joints  and  is  accompanied  by  fatigue,  anemia,  and 
osteopenia. RA has a prevalence of 0.5% to 1.0% and a peak incidence between 40 and 60 years 
of age and affects primarily women.  
Non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs)  provide  only  symptomatic  relief.  Disease-
modifying  anti-rheumatic  drugs  (DMARDs),  the  cornerstone  of  RA  treatment  throughout  all 
RoActemra

Page 8/157 
 
  
stages  of  the  disease,  maintain  or  improve  physical  function  and  retard  radiographic  joint 
damage. More recently, biologic compounds that target tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), B 
cells,  or  T  cells  have  been  used  successfully  to  treat  RA,  but  approximately  30%  to  40%  of 
patients fail to respond to these therapies. 
IL-6  is  a  pleiotropic,  pro-inflammatory,  multifunctional  cytokine  produced  by  a  variety  of  cell 
types, and it has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory and autoimmune 
disorders, including RA. Elevated IL-6 levels have been observed in the serum and synovial fluid 
of RA patients, and levels correlate with disease activity.  
About the product 
TCZ  is  a  recombinant  humanised  anti-human  IgG1  monoclonal  antibody  directed  against  the 
interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) that binds specifically to both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6R, 
thereby inhibiting IL-6-mediated signalling.  
The  authorised  formulation  of  TCZ  is  for  IV  administration  given  over  60  minutes.  IV  infusion 
requires  administration  by  a  healthcare  professional  (HCP)  in  a  clinical  setting.  For  the  SC 
formulation,  it  is  intended  that  after  proper  training  in  injection  technique  by  an  HCP,  patients 
may self-inject at home if their physician determines that it is appropriate. 
In  several  chronic  conditions,  including  RA,  in  which  patients  are  required  to  self-administer 
injectable drugs (e.g. diabetes, multiple sclerosis), a preference for an auto injector (AI) over a 
syringe has been reported (Korytkowski 2003, Summers 2004, Mikol 2005, Kivitz 2006). 
Type of application and aspects on development 
This  Extension  Application  as  referred  to  in  Article  19  of  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No 
1234/2008 and Annex I is to register the following:  
•  A new pharmaceutical form “solution for injection” 
•  A new strength 162 mg with two new presentations Pre-filled syringe and pre-filled pen 
•  A new route of administration for subcutaneous route. 
The  development  program  comprises  six  Phase  I  or  Phase  I/II  clinical  pharmacology  studies 
(studies  WP18097,  BP22065,  NP25539,  BP21894,  MRA227JP  and  NP22623)  and  two  pivotal 
Phase  III  studies  (studies  WA22762  and  NA25220)  in  patients  with  RA.  The  Phase  III  study 
MRA229JP, conducted exclusively in Japanese patients with RA, is supportive only of the efficacy 
and safety of TZC SC when given as monotherapy. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The  formulation  development  program  was  to  obtain  a  stable  highly  concentrated  liquid 
formulation for subcutaneous (SC) administration of tocilizumab (RoActemra SC). A 180 mg/mL 
concentration was selected for SC administration of 162 mg/0.9 mL of tocilizumab in a single-use 
prefilled syringe (PFS) mounted with a needle safety device (NSD) or assembled as a single-use 
prefilled pen (also referred to as an “auto-injector” (AI)). 
RoActemra 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/606295/2013 
Page 9/157 
 
  
The  RoActemra  SC  finished  product  formulation  consists  of  180  mg/mL  tocilizumab  in  L-
histidine/L-histidine 
hydrochloride, 
L-arginine/L-arginine 
hydrochloride, 
L-methionine, 
polysorbate 80, at a pH of approximately 6.0. 
Tocilizumab  for  SC  formulation  was  developed  by  modifying  the  latest  tocilizumab  G5  process 
version at the Chugai Utsunomiya (UT) facility (G5U). 
To  maintain  the  Phase  III  clinical  supply  and  for  future  commercial  supply,  the  manufacturing 
process for the G5.2 active substance was transferred to Genentech’s Oceanside (OCN) facility. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Currently  global  commercial  supply  of  active  substance  for  IV  administration  is  provided  by  the 
G5U fifth generation process in UT. For SC administration, active substance derived from the fifth 
generation  process  at  OCN  will  be  used.  The  initial  G5U  manufacturing  process  approved  for 
tocilizumab active substance was validated to ensure consistent product quality.  
The  manufacturing  process  for  subcutaneous  (SC)  administration  (G5.2)  was  transferred  from 
the clinical site in Vacaville (VV) to the Oceanside (OCN) facility. The OCN facility is the intended 
commercial  manufacturing  site  for  SC  Active  substance.  The  G5.2  manufacturing  process  is 
identical to the manufacturing process for the tocilizumab active substance for IV administration, 
except  for  higher  bulk  active  substance  concentration.  Additional  validation  was  required  to 
support  the  changes,  as  well  as  to  support  the  facility  and  equipment  differences  between  the 
licensed UT site and the OCN site.  
The  process  qualification  (PQ)  of  the  tocilizumab  SC  process  was  performed  to  qualify  the 
manufacturing process at the OCN site.. The G5.2 qualification runs met the established ranges. 
Additionally,  in-process  testing  and  Certificate  of  Analysis  (CofA)  results  were  reviewed  to 
demonstrate that the quality attributes of the qualification runs meet the quality control release 
criteria.  Verification  that  the  process  parameters  are  maintained  within  the  established 
acceptable  ranges  for  all  steps  in  common  between  the  G5.2  and  IV  formulation  process  was 
demonstrated.  The  summary  of  the  results  indicate  that  the  tocilizumab  G5.2  manufacturing 
process is capable of consistently producing active substance that meets the established quality 
specifications and attributes.  
To demonstrate the comparability of the tocilizumab G5.2 active substance manufactured at OCN 
facility to G5.2 active substance produced at Genentech Vacaville facility, G5.2 Active substance 
batches produced at the OCN facility (OCN G5.2 active substance batches) were compared to the 
Reference Standard (RS) and G5.2 active substance batches produced at the VV facility (VV G5.2 
active  substance  batches).  In  addition  to  meeting  the  active  substance  specification,  further 
characterisation  was  performed  with  respect  to  the  primary  structure  of  the  G5.2  active 
substance  and  included  an  assessment  of  the  heterogeneity  of  the  G5.2  active  substance  with 
respect to glycosylation, size, and charge-based isoforms. It was demonstrated that, with respect 
to  the  structure  of  the  tocilizumab  molecule,  the  OCN  G5.2  active  substance  batches  are 
consistent  with  and  comparable  to  the  VV  G5.2  active  substance  batches  and  the  RS. 
Comparability data for batches manufactured with the currently approved G5U and the proposed 
G5.2 OCN process were also provided. Tocilizumab G5.2 batches were evaluated with respect to 
the  removal of  process-  and  product-related impurities.  The  results  demonstrate that  the  levels 
of  process-  and  product-related  impurities  are  consistently  removed  to  levels  below  or  at  the 
level of detection of the respective assay.

Specifications  contain  standard  criteria  for  the  acceptance  or  rejection  of  batches  based  on 
features  that  are  important  to  assure  the  identity,  purity,  content,  potency,  and  safety  of  G5.2 
tocilizumab  Active  substance.  The  proposed  specification  is  based  upon  knowledge  from 
preclinical  development  as  well  as  the  approved  tocilizumab  intravenous  (IV)  active  substance 
specification.  Furthermore,  the  specification  complies  with  current  regulatory  requirements. 
Appropriateness  of  the  proposed  specification  was  evaluated  based  on  the  results  from  batches 
of G5.2 tocilizumab active substance. The batch analysis data demonstrate that the G5.2 process 
is validated to produce tocilizumab that meets all current release specifications.  
The  results  of  the  stability  studies  indicate  consistency  of  tocilizumab  manufactured  at  the 
commercial  scale.    Real-time  and  accelerated  stability  studies  were  initiated  in  accordance  with 
ICH  guidelines  and  per  protocol  (PP)  to  monitor  the  time-temperature  stability  of  finished 
product. On the basis of the data provided, the approvable shelf life for the finished product is 30 
months at 2-8°C. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
RoActemra (tocilizumab) is supplied as a sterile, colorless to slightly yellowish, preservative-free 
liquid  solution  in  a  single-use  1  mL  prefilled  syringe  (PFS)  for  subcutaneous  (SC)  injection, 
delivering 162 mg tocilizumab in a 0.9 mL solution. 
A) Finished product in prefilled syringe (PFS) 
Galenical bulk production of RoActemra SC prefilled syringes (PFSs) 162 mg/0.9 mL is performed 
by  Vetter  Pharma-Fertigung  GmbH  &  Co  KG  Schützenstrasse  87  and  99-101  D-88212 
Ravensburg Germany. 
RoActemra  (tocilizumab)  active  substance  is  thawed  in  the  primary  container  and  stirred  for 
homogenization.  The  filtered  finished  product  bulk  solution  is  sterile-filtered  in-line  and 
aseptically  filled  into  1  mL  pre-sterilised  syringes.  Immediately  after  filling,  the  syringes  are 
stoppered  with  sterilized  plunger  stoppers  and  stored  at  2°C  -  8°C  prior  to  visual  inspection. 
After  the  visual inspection  is  completed,  syringes  are  bulk  packaged  and  stored  at  2°C  - 8°C. 
Final  automated  assembly  of  the  PFS  with  the  plunger  rod  and  needle  safety  device  (NSD)  is 
performed  at  the  Roche  Kaiseraugst  facility  on  a  fully  automated  assembly  line.  The  final 
assembled  PFS  +  NSD  and  patient  leaflets  are  packaged  together  in  a  printed  carton.  After 
packaging, the final product is transferred to cold storage (2°C - 8°C) until final distribution. 
Validation  activities  were  conducted  to  ensure  that  appropriate  process  parameters  and  ranges 
are defined for the manufacture of the commercial batch sizes.  
To  validate  the  sterile  filtration  process,  a  microbial  retention  test  was  performed.  Hold  time 
study results support the proposed hold times. 
In general the specifications are set according to the requirements of the ICH Q6B Guidance. The 
European Pharmacopoeia monograph “Monoclonal antibodies for human use” (2031) requires for 
appearance  that  liquid  preparations  are  without  visible  particles,  unless  otherwise  justified.  The 
applicant  was  asked  to  set  the  specifications  according  to  the  monograph  or  to  justify  the 
proposed specification. The analytical procedures for RoActemra SC prefilled syringes have been 
established based on the validated analytical procedures previously submitted for RoActemra IV 
vials. The minor differences and adjustment have no impact on the test performance. The batch 
analysis  data  indicate  that  all  acceptance  criteria  were  met.  The  actual  values  for  the  potency

determination should be provided. The proposed RoActemra SC finished product release and end-
of-shelf-life  specifications  are  based  upon  knowledge  from  clinical  development  as  well  as  the 
approved RoActemra IV.  
The  materials  of  the  primary  packaging  material  are  in  compliance  with  the  Ph.  Eur. 
requirements.  
A maximum product expiry for the RoActemra PFS + NSD combination product of 30 months at 
the recommended storage condition of 2°C − 8°C was considered acceptable based on:  
- Real-time and accelerated data for the PFS; 
- Supportive Real-time and accelerated data for the PFS; 
- Real-time and accelerated data for the PFS + NSD; 
-  Functionality  data  on  PFS  +  NSDs  assembled  on  the  semi-automated  assembly  line  at 
recommended storage conditions; 
-  Supportive  container  closure  integrity  (CCI)  study  of  assembled  media-filled  syringes  into  the 
PFS + NSD. 
On 20 December 2013, the MAH reported an issue affecting the PFS-NSD device: at the 9-month 
time point of the long term functionality testing performed in June 2013, one PFS-NSD device out 
of  60  units  exceeded  the  acceptance  criterion  of  peak  force  before  the  finished  product  is 
expelled  from  the  syringe.  Testing  of  the  0,  3,  6  and  12  month  time  points  were  successfully 
completed with all syringes meeting the acceptance criteria. The possible root cause is a clogged 
needle  due  to  solidified  finished  product  at  the  tip.  The  MAH  already  reported  clogging  as  a 
possible root cause for a clinical complaint in the submission documentation.  
As  an  immediate  action  the  MAH  proposed  changes  to  the  product  information  in  sections  6.3 
and 6.6 of the SmPC as well as in the Package Leaflet in sections 5 and 6 (Instructions for Use 
Steps 2 and 5). This is supported by CHMP. 
Overall  it  was  concluded  that  that  clogging  incidents,  including  clogging  incidents  prior  to  cap 
removal, are very rare events. Furthermore, the risk assessment provided by the MAH indicated 
that if in the very rare event a patient were to attempt to perform an injection using a PSF-NSD 
or PFP with a clogged needle, it is highly unlikely there would be any impact on clinical efficacy or 
safety. 
It  is  concluded  that  there  is  no  impact  on  clinical  efficacy  or  safety  due  to  clogging  incidents 
when using the PFS-NSD device. 
B) Finished product in prefilled pen (AI-auto injector) 
An  assessment  of  the  potential  influence  of  the  assembly  process  on  finished  product 
performance was conducted. The degradation behaviour of tocilizumab at 2°C − 8°C and 25°C 
in  the  bulk  PFS  and  in  the  AI  configurations  is  considered  very  similar.  Furthermore  the  results 
are well within specification limits for the recommended storage condition of 2°C − 8°C. 
The AI delivers RoActemra to the patient by a mechanical spring that pushes the plunger stopper 
towards  the  needle,  initiating  the  injection  of  the  finished  product  solution.  An  additional  risk 
assessment  for  the  AI  was  performed  in  order  to  evaluate  the  influence  of  the  assembly  and

packaging  process  on  CCI  integrity.  Supporting  microbiological  CCI  testing  on  commercial 
representative media-filled syringes in the assembled system were additionally performed. 
Galenical  bulk  production  of  RoActemra  SC  prefilled  syringes  (PFSs)  162  mg/0.9  mL:  Vetter 
Pharma-Fertigung  GmbH  &  Co  KG.  The  autoinjector  (AI)  is  composed  of  front  and  rear 
subassembly parts that are assembled to hold the prefilled syringe (PFS). Final assembly of the 
PFS into the AI is performed at the Roche Kaiseraugst facility on a fully automated assembly line 
in a controlled, non-sterile environment.  
As part of validation, in-line controls and functionality were checked and the correct assembly of 
the AIs was demonstrated by a visual and functional test.  
The degradation behaviour of tocilizumab at 2°C − 8°C and 25°C in the bulk PFS and in the AI 
configurations  is  considered  very  similar.  Furthermore  the  results  are  well  within  specification 
limits for the recommended storage condition of 2°C − 8°C. The shelf life for the RoActemra AI 
combination  product  is  further  supported  by  the  results  from  all  assembled  AI  batches  and 
available studies for the components and will be assigned to each assembled AI batch based on 
the component having the shortest remaining shelf life. 
On  29  January  2014,  the  applicant  reported  several  out-of-specification  results  with  the  PFP  at 
the  24  month  time  point  of  the  long-term  functionality  testing:  several  examples  exceeded  the 
injection  time  limit.  This  acceptance  limit  for  the  injection  time  into  air  is  based  on  the 
performance  capability  of  the  spring-driven  PFP  auto-injector  to  deliver  the  full  dose  of 
RoActemra 162 mg/0.9 mL. The possible root cause of these events is not fully understood. As a 
consequence,  on  11  February  2014  the  MAH  decided  to  remove  the  PFP  presentation  from  the 
scope of this line extension. The MAH also confirmed their ability to ensure commercial supply of 
the  PFS  to  all  rheumatoid  arthritis  patients  once  approved  and  to  subjects  enrolled  in  on-going 
clinical studies. 
C) Adventitious agents safety evaluation 
The G5U manufacturing process of tocilizumab was used as the basis for the initial manufacture 
of  RoActemra  SC.  Modifications  to  the  G5U  purification  process  were  made  to  accommodate 
facility-related  differences,  including  larger  mass  produced  in  Genentech  bioreactors  relative  to 
those  used  in  the  G5U  process.  No  new  TSE  risk  material  has  been  introduced.  For  all  viral 
clearance  steps  that  did  not  change  from  G5U  to  G5.2  virus  removal  and  inactivation  studies 
have not been repeated. 
In  summary,  the  virus  safety  for  the  new  G5.2  active  substance  manufacturing  process  is 
considered sufficiently demonstrated. 
2.2.4.  Conclusions  on  the  chemical,  pharmaceutical  and  biological 
aspects 
The  overall  Quality  of  RoActemra  in  a  pre-filled  pen  syringe  equipped  with  needle  safety  device 
(PFS+NSD) is considered acceptable. 
2.2.5.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Tocilizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) 
class  that  binds  both  soluble  and  membrane-bound  human  interleukin-6  receptor  (IL-6R). 
Tocilizumab has been shown to be pharmacologically active in cynomolgus monkeys. To support 
the  original  marketing  authorisation  application  (MAA),  an  extensive  number  of  pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics  and  toxicities  studies  were  conducted.  Authorisation  of  the  IV  route  of 
administration  was  mainly  based  on  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and  toxicology  data  using 
this route of exposure in cynomolgus monkeys. Pharmacology, PK and toxicity data (reproductive 
toxicity  and  juvenile  toxicity  studies)  were  also  provided  using  a  murine  surrogate  antibody 
MR16-1 with IV infusion in the mouse. 
To  bridge  this  comprehensive  dataset  to  the  subcutaneous  (SC)  route  of  administration,  a  PK 
study  was  conducted  in  the  minipig  to  assess  the  absorption  behavior  from  the  high 
concentration  SC  formulation  of  tocilizumab  (180  mg/mL)  intended  for  clinical  use.  An  IV  dose 
arm  allowed  for  the  estimation of  the  bioavailability  of tocilizumab  after  SC  dosing.  The  minipig 
was  selected  for  this  purpose  as  this  species  represents  an  animal  model  with  skin  and 
subcutaneous tissue texture similar to humans making it appropriate to study the absorption of 
SC formulations. 
Further, the safety of tocilizumab SC with respect to any local reactions at the site of injection, 
the effects on the draining lymphatic system specific to this site of administration, a comparison 
of exposure and an assessment of anti-drug antibody formation with this subcutaneous mode of 
administration  versus  the  IV  route,  the  elimination  phase  of  tocilizumab  and  the  possible 
reversibility  of  any  observations  in  a  treatment-free  phase  of  the  study  were  assessed  in  a  9-
week  SC  repeat-dose  toxicity  study  in  the  cynomolgus  monkey,  which  included  a  16-week 
treatment-free observation period. 
These studies were conducted with the high concentration preparation of 180 mg/mL tocilizumab 
that  is  also  used  for  the  human  SC  formulation.  Thus,  these  data  also  bridge  the  non-clinical 
kinetic and safety data to the human preparation including the excipients used. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The pharmacodynamics studies performed with tocilizumab in support of the original application 
showed that tocilizumab specifically binds to the IL-6 binding site of both sIL-6R and mIL-6R with 
similar  affinity.  Therefore,  tocilizumab  is  able  to  block  IL-6  from  binding  to  both  receptors  and 
thereby blocks the activity of IL-6. In vitro studies demonstrated that tocilizumab can inhibit IL-6 
binding  to  and  displace  already  bound  IL-6  from  sIL-6R  and  that tocilizumab  has  a  strong  anti- 
IL-6 effect. Tocilizumab is specific to the IL-6R with no binding to other receptors associated with 
gp130 or to receptors for other cytokines. Pre-clinical studies showed specificity of tocilizumab to 
the IL-6R with no direct cross-reactive inhibitory effect on TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-15 or IL-2 in vitro.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
A non-GLP  PK study (study No 165.001) was conducted in the minipig to assess the absorption 
behavior  of  the  high  concentration  SC  formulation  of  tocilizumab  (180  mg/mL)  intended  for 
clinical  use.  An  IV  dose  arm  allowed  for  the  estimation  of  the  relative  bioavailability  of 
tocilizumab after SC dosing. The bioavailability was  estimated at 83.5%, which indicates a very 
good absorption of tocilizumab SC from this formulation. 
No  repeated  dose  PK  studies  have  been  performed  with  tocilizumab  SC.  Information  on  the 
repeated  dose  PK  of  tocilizumab  SC  was  obtained  in  a  repeated  dose  SC  toxicology  study  in 
cynomolgus monkeys (study 1029905). 
Method of analysis 
Assay for quantification of tocilizumab in cynomologus monkey plasma 
Concentrations  of  tocilizumab  after  repeated  doses  in  cynomolgus  monkey  plasma  were 
determined with a validated sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 
The  ELISA  used  for  analysis  of  tocilizumab  concentrations  in  the  single  SC  dose  study  in 
cynomolgus  monkey  was  already  described  in  the  original  MAA  for  the  tocilizumab  IV 
formulation. 
Assay for quantification of tocilizumab in minipig plasma 
Concentrations  of  tocilizumab  in  minipig  plasma  were  determined  with  an  exploratory  sandwich 
ELISA  which  was  adapted  from  the  assay  validated  for  cynomolgus  monkey  plasma.  The  assay 
closely  followed  the  procedure  for  cynomolgus  monkey  plasma,  with  calibration  and  quality 
control samples made up in minipig plasma. 
Assay for detection of anti-tocilizumab antibodies in cynomologus monkey plasma 
A  validated  sandwich  ELISA  was  used  to  detect  and  confirm  the  presence  of  antitocilizumab 
antibodies  after  repeated  doses  in  cynomolgus  monkey  plasma.  This  assay  uses  a  mouse  anti-
human IL-6R monoclonal antibody (mPM- 1) which has the same CDR as tocilizumab. This assay 
system only detects monkey antibodies that bind to the CDR of tocilizumab. 
Absorption 
Single-dose  intravenous  and  subcutaneous  administration  in  minipigs  (study  No. 
165.001) 
A  PK  study  was  conducted  with  tocilizumab  SC  in  minipigs  to  explore  the  PK  of  the  high 
concentration  SC  formulation  of  tocilizumab  (concentration  180  mg/mL).  The  study  included  an 
IV dosing arm to allow estimation of absolute bioavailability. In additional dose arms, the PK of 
two  alternative  formulations  was  studied  containing  different  concentrations  of  recombinant 
human  hyaluronidase  (rHuPH20)  as  a  permeation  enhancer.  The  tocilizumab  SC  formulations 
containing  rHuPH20  are  not  relevant  for  this  application,  as  the  clinical  tocilizumab  SC 
formulation  does  not  contain  rHuPH20.  Therefore  the  results  for  the  rHuPH20  containing 
formulations will not be discussed further. 
Female  Göttingen  minipigs  (n=3  and  5  for  IV  and  SC  administration,  respectively)  received  a 
single  IV  dose of  tocilizumab  at 20.3  mg/kg  or  a  single  SC  dose  at 180  mg/animal  (about  20.2 
mg/kg). The SC injection volume was 1 mL. Plasma concentrations of tocilizumab were analyzed

with a specific ELISA. PK analysis was conducted by both non-compartmental and compartmental 
methods. The figure below shows the average plasma concentration-time profiles after IV and SC 
dosing.

Equivalent  to  ca.  20.2  mg/kg)  Administration  of  Tocilizumab  (n  =  3  or  5, 
respectively) (mean ± SD) 
After  IV  administration,  the  plasma  concentration-time  curve  showed  a  biphasic  disposition  of 
TCZ. Non-compartmental PK analysis indicated a terminal half-life of 286 ± 182 hours. Clearance 
was estimated at 0.00435 ± 0.00179 mL/min/kg (equivalent to 6.26 ± 2.58 mL/day/kg), and the 
volume  of  distribution  at  steady-state  (Vss)  was  estimated  to  be  84.9  ±  19.2  mL/kg  (mean  ± 
SD).  
After  SC  administration,  maximum  TCZ  plasma  concentrations  were  190  ±  14  µg/mL  (mean  ± 
SD).  They  were  reached  after  48  hours  (median  value;  range:  24  to  72  hours).  The  terminal 
half-life  (262  ±  40  hours;  mean  ±  SD)  was  similar  to  that  after  IV  administration.  The  SC 
bioavailability  from  non-compartmental  PK  analysis  was  83.5  ±  23.1%.  Compartmental  PK 
modeling  revealed  a  first  order  absorption  rate  constant  ka  of  0.0359  h-1  and  a  fraction 
absorbed of 81.2% (population estimates). 
Single-dose  subcutaneous  administration  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  (study  No  ADM04-
0014) 
This SC PK study in male cynomolgus monkeys was already described in the original MAA for the 
tocilizumab IV formulation. The results of this study were used to support the planning of the SC 
GLP  toxicology  study  in  cynomolgus  monkeys.  Therefore,  the  results  of  this  study  are  again 
briefly summarized. 
Male  cynomolgus  monkeys  (n=4/dose  group)  received  a  single  SC  tocilizumab  dose  at  a  dose 
level  of  1,  5,  or  15  mg/kg.  Plasma  concentrations  of  tocilizumab  were  analyzed  with  a  specific 
ELISA.  PK  analysis  was  conducted  by  non-compartmental  analysis.  The  figure  below  shows  the 
average plasma concentration-time profiles.

Following SC administration maximum tocilizumab plasma concentrations were reached at about 
2  to  3  days  post  dose  at  all  dose  levels.  Cmax  and  AUC  values  increased  more  than  dose-
proportionately,  which  is  in  line  with  the  non-linear  PK  of  tocilizumab  in  cynomolgus  monkeys 
observed after IV administration. At the 5 mg/kg dose level the SC bioavailability was estimated 
at 72.1%.

Repeated-dose subcutaneous administration  
Information  on  the  repeated-dose  PK  of  tocilizumab  SC  was  obtained  in  a  repeated  dose 
toxicology study (study 1029905). Cynomolgus monkeys (n=5/gender) received weekly doses of 
tocilizumab  SC  at  100  mg/kg  over  9  weeks.  Average  maximum  plasma  concentrations  of 
tocilizumab  increased  from  1110  μg/mL  after  the  first  dose  to  3280  μg/mL  after  the  8th
while average AUC(0-168h) values increased from 151,000 to 478,000 μg·h/mL. 
  dose, 
Anti-tocilizumab antibodies were measured in the recovery animals (n=2/gender) during and at 
the  end  of  the  16-week  recovery  phase.  No  anti-tocilizumab  antibodies  were  detected  in  any 
cynomolgus monkeys during the recovery phase. 
Metabolism (interspecies comparison) 
No  dedicated  studies  on  the  metabolism/catabolism  of  tocilizumab  SC  have  been  performed. 
Tocilizumab  is  expected  to  undergo  catabolism  similar  to  that  of  other  IgGs.  There  is  broad 
evidence  in  the  literature  that  IgG  is  cleared  from  the  body  predominantly  via  catabolism.  The 
neonatal  Fc  receptor  (FcRn)  plays  a  key  role  in  maintaining  IgG  homeostasis  by  protecting  IgG 
from catabolism. 
The FcRn mediated protection process is also relevant during the SC absorption process. Studies 
in  mice  have  shown  a  marked  reduction  in  SC  bioavailability  for  an  IgG  in  FcRn  knockout  mice 
relative to wild-type mice. It is known that most of IgGs given subcutaneously are absorbed into 
blood flow through lymph. 
Dedicated studies to assess the fate of tocilizumab in the subcutaneous interstitial space and the 
lymphatic system were not considered to be necessary. This was supported by the CHMP. Uptake 
of IgGs from the interstitial space into the lymphatic system and subsequent back transport into 
blood circulation also occurs following IV administration as part of the normal distribution and re-
circulation process of IgGs. Therefore, catabolic processes unique to SC administration are quite 
unlikely. 
Overall,  the  catabolism  processes  of  tocilizumab  administered  SC  are  expected  to  be  similar  to 
those after IV administration. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
No  PK  drug  interaction  studies  have  been  performed  with  tocilizumab  SC.  The  potential  for  PK 
drug  interaction  with  tocilizumab  SC  is  not  expected  to  differ  from  that  of  the  tocilizumab  IV 
formulation,  since  after  having  reached  systemic  circulation  tocilizumab  will  behave  the  same 
irrespective of the administration route. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Tocilizumab has been extensively characterized in the cynomolgus monkey in single and repeat-
dose toxicity studies with intravenous (IV) administration of this antibody. In order to bridge the 
IV  toxicity  study  program  to  the  new  subcutaneous  (SC)  formulation  program,  a  single  9-week 
SC repeat-dose toxicity study followed by a 16-week recovery phase in the cynomolgus monkey 
was  conducted.  The  treatment  duration  of  this  study  and  the  recovery  phase  was  based  on 
steady state and elimination expectations. 
RoActemra 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/606295/2013 
Page 18/157 
 
  
Any concerns regarding systemic toxicity of tocilizumab are sufficiently characterized using the IV 
route  of  exposure  in  cynomolgus  monkey  studies  and  in  studies  using  MR16-1,  a  surrogate 
antibody  blocking  the  mouse  IL-6  receptor.  Hence,  the  toxicology  bridging  program  for  the  SC 
route focused on the following objectives: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
any local reactions at the site of injection 
the effects on the draining lymphatic system specific to this site of administration 
a  comparison  of  exposure  and  an  assessment  of  anti-drug  antibody  formation  with  this 
subcutaneous mode of administration versus the intravenous route 
the elimination phase of tocilizumab and the possible reversibility of any observations in 
a treatment-free phase of the study. 
One high dose of 100 mg/kg weekly was administered subcutaneously for this purpose. This dose 
was  also  used  as  a  high  dose  in  the  IV  toxicity  program  with  tocilizumab  in  the  cynomolgus 
monkey  with  weekly  administrations  for  six  months.  The  exposure  and  clearance  of  tocilizumab 
did  not  substantially  differ  between  the  two  modes  of  administration.  The  somewhat  higher 
trough values with SC administration are related to a slower absorption with this route compared 
to  the  IV  route  but otherwise  the  two  administration  routes  had  similar  elimination  kinetics.  No 
evidence for anti-drug antibodies was found in the animals investigated during and at the end of 
the  treatment  free  phase  of  the  SC  study  (n=2/gender).  The  low  levels  of  tocilizumab  towards 
the  end  of  the  treatment-free  period  together  with  the  high  drug  tolerance  of  the  anti-drug 
antibody  assay  allowed  a  reliable  assessment  of  recovery  animals  for  presence  of  antidrug 
antibodies.  Hence,  the  formation  of  anti-drug  antibodies  did  not  have  an  impact  on  the  study 
data. There were no specific reactions to the local SC administration of tocilizumab in the area of 
administration or in the draining lymphatic system, in this 9- week cynomolgus monkey SC study 
followed  by  a  16-week  recovery  period.  Thus,  this  study  bridges  the  previously  characterized 
acute and chronic dosing animal safety program of tocilizumab using the IV route with the new 
intended  route  of  a  SC  administration.  No  new  safety  concerns,  which  can  be  addressed  by 
animal studies using tocilizumab, have emerged from this change in the route of administration.

The  objective  of  the  repeat-dose  toxicity  study  was  to  determine  the  toxicity  of  tocilizumab, 
following  weekly  SC  administrations  to  cynomolgus  monkeys  for  9  weeks  and  to  assess  the 
reversibility of the adverse effects during a 16-week recovery phase. 
Assessment of toxicity was based on observation of mortality, clinical signs, injection sites, and 
on  measurement  of  body  weight,  testicular  volume,  haematology,  clinical  chemistry,  urine 
analysis,  toxicokinetics,  and  on  terminal  procedures  (organ  weights,  macroscopic  findings  and 
histopathology) and on bone marrow evaluation. 
The dosing design was as follows in the table below.

Consistent  high  systemic  exposure  to  tocilizumab  was  seen  in  this  study.  Mean  Cmax 
concentrations  of  3410  and  3140  μg/mL  and  mean  AUC  (0-168h)  of  507000  and  448000 
h.μg/mL  were  reached  in  this  study  in  males  and  females  respectively,  after  the  8th 
administration on day 50. 
Systemic  exposure  was  characterized  by  a  normal  inter-individual  variability  with  no  relevant 
gender  differences.  As  expected  from  the  long  plasma  half-life,  exposure  to  tocilizumab, 
accumulated during the course of the treatment period with an overall average day 50 to day 1 
ratio  of  3.16  for  AUC(0-168h)  and  2.96  for  Cmax.  Due  to  the  slow  plasma  clearance  of 
tocilizumab,  3  of  the  4  animals  were  continuously  exposed  to  tocilizumab  during  the  entire 
recovery  period  of  16  weeks,  with  terminal  tocilizumab  plasma  concentrations between  2.9  and 
43.1 μg/mL. 
Tocilizumab  demonstrated  no  immunogenic  potential  in  this  study.  Anti-tocilizumab  antibodies, 
measured under non-GLP conditions were not detected in any sample taken during the treatment 
period or during the recovery period. Accelerated clearance of tocilizumab was neither observed 
during the treatment phase nor was it observed during the 16-week treatment free period in the 
4 recovery sub-group animals. 
Exposure  to  tocilizumab  by  weekly  SC  injections  did  not  induce  any  noteworthy  or  significant 
adverse effects. Similar to the repeat-dose studies with IV administration, there was in particular 
no  effect  on  absolute  neutrophil  counts  or  any  other  hematological  dyscrasia  observed  at  any 
phase of the study. A slight decrease in serum fibrinogen as the only potential treatment-related 
observation was considered to be of minor physiological relevance. All values were within or close 
to normal ranges. 
The  histological  examination  of  organs  and  tissues,  including  the  axillary  lymph  node  as  the 
injection  site  draining  lymph  node,  did  not  reveal  any  histopathological  differences between  the 
control and treated animals. 
Local reactions at the injection sites were clinically insignificant and macroscopically comparable 
between control and dosed animals. The injection site reactions were histologically seen as mild 
focal  and  predominantly  mononuclear  and  perivascular  inflammatory  reactions.  Such  reactions 
were  found  in  control  and  treated  animals  of  both  sexes  with  insignificant  differences  in  the 
severity between the two groups. Control animals were injected with physiological saline. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Consistent  high  systemic  exposure  to  tocilizumab  was  seen  in  the  9-week  SC  toxicity  study. 
Mean  Cmax  concentrations  of  3410  and  3140  μg/mL  and  mean  AUC  (0-168h)  of  507000  and

448000  h.μg/mL  were  reached  in  this  study  in  males  and  females  respectively,  after  the  8th 
administration on day 50. 
As  expected  from  the  long  plasma  half-life,  tocilizumab  accumulated  over  time  with  an  overall 
average day 50 to day 1 ratio of 3.16 for AUC(0-168h) and 2.96 for Cmax, respectively. Due to 
the  slow  plasma  clearance  of  tocilizumab,  3  of  the  4  animals  were  continuously  exposed  to 
tocilizumab  during  the  entire  recovery  period  of  16  weeks,  with  terminal  tocilizumab  plasma 
concentrations between 2.9 and 43.1 μg/mL. 
Comparison of different administration routes 
The  dose  level  of  100  mg/kg  chosen  for  the  9-week  SC  study  was  equivalent  to  that  was  used 
previously in a 6-month repeat-dose IV toxicity study. Cmin exposure at 168 h (7 days) after the 
eighth weekly dose in the SC study is approximately 40 % higher than the exposure at 168 h (7 
days) after the eighth weekly dose in the 6-month IV study.

Local Tolerance 
The local tolerance of the SC formulation was assessed as part of the repeat-dose toxicity study 
in  the  cynomolgus  monkey  carried  out  to  bridge  the  previous  IV  animal  toxicity  program  to 
support a SC administration of tocilizumab.  
Local reactions at the injection sites were clinically insignificant and macroscopically comparable 
between control and treated animals. The histological findings were mild focal and predominantly 
mononuclear and perivascular inflammatory reactions. 
The  SC  formulation  of  tocilizumab  was  well  tolerated,  so  this  result  supports  the  SC 
administration of tocilizumab.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No  dedicated  ecotoxicity/environmental  risk  assessment  was  performed  for  this  medicinal 
product, which is in accordance with the applicable guidance. The active substance is a protein, 
the use of which is unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. Therefore, tocilizumab 
is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacokinetics 
The PK of tocilizumab after SC administration was studied in minipigs and cynomolgus monkeys. 
The studies focused on the absorption behavior of tocilizumab after SC administration, since the 
disposition  PK  of  tocilizumab  after  IV  administration  has  been  well  characterized  previously 
during the development of tocilizumab for IV administration. 
The species selection served the needs of the non-clinical SC development program. 
The SC PK data in cynomolgus monkeys supported the planning of the GLP cynomolgus monkey 
toxicology study. 
Minipigs  were  used  to  assess  the  absorption  behavior  of  the  high  concentration  tocilizumab 
formulation.  The  minipig  was  chosen  for  this  study  because  its  skin  and  the  texture  of  the  SC 
tissue are considered to be similar to those of humans with a fibrous tissue network connecting 
dermis and deep fascia/muscle. It was not assessed whether the minipig is a responder species 
to tocilizumab. This was considered irrelevant for the interpretation of the present study, as this 
focused on the absorption behavior rather than on the general disposition PK of tocilizumab. 
Tocilizumab showed high SC bioavailability in both species, i.e. 83.5 and 72.1% in minipigs and 
cynomolgus  monkeys,  respectively,  estimated  by  non-compartmental  PK  analysis.  Time  to 
maximum plasma concentration was in the expected range for SC administration of IgGs. 
As  a  result  of  above  studies,  the  PK  of  tocilizumab  were  well  characterized  after  SC 
administration to animals. The data provided a basis for planning of the SC toxicology study and 
gave support for the clinical development program of tocilizumab SC. 
Toxicology 
The evaluation of the potential toxicity of tocilizumab SC extends previous evaluations following 
an  IV  administration.  The  bridging  strategy  to  non-clinical  safety  data  focused  on  the  elements 
specific to the SC route of administration versus the IV route, i.e. local tolerance at the injection 
site,  effects  on  the  local  and  draining  immune  system  via  assessment  of  the  draining  lymph 
nodes,  an  assessment  of  the  exposure,  and  possible  formation  of  anti-drug  antibodies  in 
relationship to the IV route at the same dose. 
Furthermore, the reversibility of any changes, if observed, was assessed. 
One high dose level of 100 mg/kg weekly given subcutaneously was chosen for this purpose. This 
is the same high dose that was used previously in a 6-month repeat-dose toxicity study using the 
IV  route  of  administration  in  cynomolgus  monkeys.  Cmin  exposure  at  168  h  (7  days)  after  the 
eighth  weekly  dose  in  the  9-week  cynomolgus  monkey  SC  study  (100  mg/kg)  is  approximately 
RoActemra 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/606295/2013 
Page 22/157 
 
  
40%  higher  than  the  exposure  at  168  h  (7  days)  after  the  eighth  weekly  dose  in  the  6-month 
cynomolgus monkey IV study (100 mg/kg). 
Hence,  taking  into  account  the  high  subcutaneous  bioavailability  and  the  generally  slower 
absorption phase for SC mode of administration compared to the IV route, the somewhat higher 
Cmin  values  for  the  SC  dose  in  this  sub-chronic  study  are  to  be  expected.  Overall,  taking 
variability into account, comparable exposures between the same nominal doses used for IV and 
SC  administration  to  cynomolgus  monkeys  have  been  observed.  This  justifies  a  complete 
bridging of systemic effects observed between these two modes of administration. 
As local reactions and effects on the draining lymphatic system specific to the SC administration 
of  tocilizumab  were  not  apparent  from  the  study  with  SC  administration,  no  additional  safety 
concerns  have  emerged  from  this  administration  mode  of  tocilizumab.  Further,  there  was  no 
evidence of formation of anti-drug antibodies in the animals of the 16 weeks recovery phase of 
the study. 
In the submitted 9-week subcutaneous administration toxicity study in the cynomolgus monkey 
with  a  16-week  recovery phase,  only  a  very  rough reference  to the  IV  study was  made.  Higher 
trough values for the subcutaneous dose were observed with comparable elimination kinetics in a 
sub-chronic  study.  Since  a  lot  of  data  from  clinical  studies  using  the  SC  administration  are 
available  no  further  animal  studies  are  considered  required.  Nevertheless  the  applicant  was 
requested  during  the  evaluation  to  review  the  PK  data  from  IV  and  SC  administration  in 
cynomolgus monkeys.   
The  MAH  argued  that  comparable  exposures  between  the  same  nominal  doses  used  for  IV  and 
SC  administration  to  cynomolgus  monkeys  in  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies  cannot  be  concluded 
from  the  measured  data  alone.  This  is  mainly  due  to  the  fact  that  the  chronic  IV  toxicity  study 
included  trough  sampling  only  for  toxicokinetic  (TK)  assessment  and  hence  no  full  profile  is 
available  for  this  study.  Full  profiles  are  available  for  the  (newer)  9  week  SC  toxicity  study.  To 
bridge these two data sets, the MAH  simulated the full profile for the 6 month IV toxicity study 
and compared it with the measured values in the 9 week SC toxicity study. The simulation of IV 
PK  profiles  was  done  using  a  non-linear  PK  model.  The  non-linear  PK  model  was  fitted  to  data 
from  a  single  dose  PK  study  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  (IV  dose  levels  of  0.5,  5,  and  50  mg/kg) 
and from the 6 months IV toxicity study. Contrary to the 6 months IV toxicity study, in the single 
dose IV PK study, the full PK profiles were available. 
The simulated PK after weekly IV dosing of 100 mg/kg tocilizumab to cynomolgus monkeys over 
26  weeks  were  in  agreement  with  both  the  observed  trough  levels  and  levels  in  the  recovery 
phase  from  the  6  months  IV  toxicity  study.  This  match  between  PK  model-projected  plasma 
levels and measured levels indicates that the PK model captures tocilizumab levels during the 6 
months  IV  toxicity  study  in  an  adequate  manner.  A  comparison  of  the  average  post-hoc 
estimated clearance and population clearance indicates a maximal mismatch of 20%. 
AUC(0-168h)  values  are  nearly  identical  after  IV  and  SC  administration  at  100  mg/kg/week  for 
each  dosing  route.  As  expected  both  Cmax  and  Cmin  data  differ  between  both  dosing  routes. 
Cmax  levels  are  slightly  lower  after  SC  administration,  while  Cmin  values  tended  to  be  higher 
after SC administration. These differences are consistent with the relatively slow SC absorption of 
immunoglobulins,  as  was  also  evident  in  the  9  week  SC  toxicity  study.  This  was  indicated  by 
times to maximum plasma concentrations ranging from 24 to 72 h. The justification provided by 
the  MAH  was  considered  acceptable  by  the  CHMP.  The  data  provided  indicate  a  comparable

exposure to tocilizumab in terms of AUC after SC and IV administration at the dose level of 100 
mg/kg/week used in both the SC and IV toxicity studies. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Tocilizumab  and  its  murine  surrogate  antibody  MR16-1  have  been  extensively  characterized  in 
the cynomolgus monkey and in the mouse in pharmacology, PK and toxicity studies using the IV 
route of administration. These data have been the basis for approval of the IV formulation. 
In  order  to  bridge  the  IV  non-clinical  study  program  to  the  new  SC  formulation  program,  a 
bridging program consisting of a single-dose SC PK study in the minipig and a 9-week SC repeat-
dose  toxicity  study  followed  by  a  16-week  recovery  phase  in  the  cynomolgus  monkey  was 
conducted.  These  studies  were  conducted  using  the  same  dose  strength  (180  mg/mL) 
formulations as in humans containing the same excipients. 
The  bridging  strategy  to  non-clinical  safety  data  focused  on  the  safety  elements  specific  to  the 
SC route of administration versus the IV route, i.e. local tolerance at the injection site, effects on 
the  local  and  draining  immune  system  via  assessment  of  the  draining  lymph  nodes  and  an 
assessment of the exposure, and possible formation of anti-drug antibodies in relationship to the 
IV  route  at  the  same  dose.  Furthermore,  the  reversibility  of  any  changes,  if  observed,  was 
assessed. 
One high dose level of 100 mg/kg weekly given subcutaneously was chosen for this purpose. This 
was  the  same  high  dose  used  previously  in  a  6-month  repeat-dose  toxicity  study  using  the  IV 
route of administration in cynomolgus monkeys. SC weekly dosing of tocilizumab to cynomolgus 
monkeys  at  100  mg/kg  for  nine  weeks  was  well  tolerated,  without  any  relevant  tocilizumab-
induced finding. The NOAEL was considered to be at the dose of 100 mg/kg. Exposure at 168 h 
(7 days) after the eighth weekly dose in the 9-week cynomolgus monkey SC study (100 mg/kg) 
was approximately 40% higher than the exposure at 168 h (7 days) after the eighth weekly dose 
in the 6 month cynomolgus monkey IV study (100 mg/kg). Hence, taking into account the high 
subcutaneous  bioavailability  and  the  generally  slower  absorption  phase  for  the  subcutaneous 
route of administration compared to the intravenous route, the slightly higher trough values for 
the subcutaneous dose are to be expected with comparable elimination kinetics in a sub-chronic 
study. Overall, taking variability into account, comparable exposures between the same nominal 
doses  used  for  IV  and  SC  administration  to  cynomolgus  monkeys  have  been  observed.  This 
justifies  a  complete  bridging  of  systemic  effects  observed  between  these  two  modes  of 
administration. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. The MAH has 
provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the  Union  were  carried 
out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
In  study  WA22762,  critical  GCP  issues  were  identified  in  one  centre  in  Lithuania  following  an 
unscheduled Health Authority and Ethics Committee inspection. These included: 1) late reporting 
RoActemra 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/606295/2013

of  serious  adverse events (SAEs)  and  adverse  events  of  special interest  (AESI)  for  one  patient, 
and 2) instances of non-compliance with the study protocol requirements (failure to use the 24-
hour  medical  line  for  support,  failure  to  examine  the  patient  and  perform  necessary  tests  per 
protocol  requirements,  and  failure  to  include  an  unscheduled  visit).  Corrective  and  preventative 
actions were undertaken, including the appointment of a new site principal investigator. This was 
considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
The  clinical  development  program  comprises  six  Phase  I  or  Phase  I/II  clinical  pharmacology 
studies  (studies  WP18097,  BP22065,  NP25539,  BP21894,  MRA227JP  and  NP22623)  and  two 
pivotal  Phase  III  studies  (studies  WA22762  and  NA25220)  in  patients  with  RA.  The  Phase  III 
study  MRA229JP,  conducted  exclusively  in  Japanese  patients  with  RA,  is  supportive  only  of  the 
efficacy and safety of TZC SC when given as monotherapy.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  clinical  pharmacology  program  was  designed  to  characterize  the  PK  and  PD  profiles  of  TCZ 
following  IV  and  SC  administration  and  to  evaluate  the  immunogenicity  of  TCZ  when 
administered subcutaneously.  
PK characteristics of TCZ SC 
The PK of TCZ following multiple IV and SC administration in RA patients was best described by a 
two-compartment PK model with first-order absorption (following SC administration) and parallel 
linear  and  Michaelis-Menten  (non-linear)  eliminations.  The  population  estimate  of  bioavailability 
following SC administration of TCZ was 79.5%, and the absorption half-life was approximately 4 
days. 
The  total  clearance  of  tocilizumab  was  concentration-dependent  and  is  the  sum  of  linear 
clearance and non-linear clearance. Exposure following the administration of a single dose of TCZ 
to  healthy  volunteers  increased  in  a  greater  than  proportional  manner  when  the  SC  dose  was 
increased from 81 mg to 162 mg; AUCinf increased 6.4-fold and Cmax increased 4-fold as the dose 
was doubled. 
For  both  the  162  mg  qw  SC  and  8  mg/kg  q4w  IV  regimens,  nearly  complete  target  saturation 
was achieved at steady state during the entire dosing interval. The contribution of non-linear CL 
to  total  CL  was  small,  and  the  average  steady-state  concentration  (AUC/dosing  interval)  was 
similar  for  both  dose  regimens.  By  virtue  of  the  different  routes  of  administration  and  the 
extended  absorption  following  SC  dosing,  Cmax  was  higher  following  IV  dosing,  whereas  Ctrough 
was higher following SC administration. 
For  the  162  mg  q2w  SC  dosing  regimen,  the  target-mediated  elimination  pathway  was  not 
saturated at steady state, which led to high total clearance and high fluctuation of clearance over 
RoActemra 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/606295/2013 
Page 26/157 
 
  
 
the  dosing  interval.  The  nonlinear  clearance  led  to  a  more  than  dose-proportional  increase  in 
exposure following the 162 mg qw dosing regimen compared with the q2w SC dosing regimen. 
After  multiple  dosing  with  162  mg  qw  and  q2w  SC,  steady-state  for  AUC  and  Ctrough  was 
achieved after the 12th injection for the qw regimen and the 6th
162 mg qw SC, the accumulation ratio was high for AUC, Cmax, and Ctrough (6.83, 5.47, and 6.37 
 injection for the q2w regimen. For 
respectively).Ffor 162 mg q2w SC, the accumulation was small for AUC and Cmax (2.67 and 2.12 
respectively) but higher for Ctrough (5.6). 
Based  on  parameter  estimates  from  the  population  PK  model,  the  effective  t 1/2  at  steady-state 
ranged from 12.1 to 13.0 days for 162 mg qw SC and from 1.8 to 4.9 days for 162 mg q2w SC. 
Comparison  of  the pharmacokinetics  of  PK  of  TCZ  following  IV  and  SC 
administration 
The  PK  profile  of  TCZ  following  SC  and  IV  dosing  differed  as  expected  on  the  basis  of  the 
different route of administration and dosing frequency. IV administration of TCZ is infused over a 
short period of time (i.e. over 1 hour) directly into the venous system, which leads to a high Cmax 
followed  by  the  disposition  phase.  After  SC  administration,  TCZ  is  absorbed  from  the 
subcutaneous  tissue  into  the  venous  system,  resulting  in  lower  bioavailability,  lower  Cmax,  and 
longer  Tmax  compared  with  IV  administration.  At  steady-state  after  multiple  dosing,  the 
fluctuation of TCZ concentration for SC regimens is small over the dosing interval and the peak-
to-trough TCZ ratios of SC regimens are much lower than those of corresponding IV regimens. IV 
dosing  was  also  based  on  body  weight−adjusted  dosing  regimens,  whereas  SC  administration 
applied flat dosing regimens.  
In  study  WA22762,  the  average  steady-state  concentration  (Cmean)  was  similar  for  the  162  mg 
SC qw and IV 8 mg/kg q4w regimens. However, Cmax was three times lower for the SC regimen 
compared  with  the  IV  regimen,  whereas  Ctrough  was  2.4  times  higher  with the  SC  regimen  (see 
table  below).  The  exposure  level  of  the  IV  8  mg/kg  regimen  in  this  study  is  comparable  to 
historical  IV  8  mg/kg  data,  with  the  exception  of  a  2-fold  higher  Ctrough  value  that  was  highly 
variable (CV% of approximately 80%). 
In  study  NA25220,  the  average  steady-state  concentration  (Cmean)  following  TCZ  SC  q2w 
administration  was  1.9 times  lower  than  historical IV  4  mg/kg  q4w  data  (see  table  below).  The 
Cmax  values  for  the  SC  q2w  regimen  were  6.8  times  lower  than  the  IV  4  mg/kg  regimen,  but 
Ctrough values were four times higher with SC q2w. 
In study MRA229JP, the observed Ctrough was comparable between the SC q2w and 8 mg/kg IV 
q4w  groups  from  Week  4  onwards  (~11−12  μg/mL  at  Week  24).  The  observed  Ctrough  levels  at 
Week 24 in these Japanese patients following SC q2w dosing were higher than those observed in 
similarly  treated,  but  comparatively  heavier,  patients  (54  kg  vs.  70  kg)  from  study  NA25220 
(approximately 11 μg/mL vs. approximately 7 μg/mL).

Parameters for Different SC and IV Dose Regimens 
Effect of intrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of TCZ 
The following intrinsic covariates were found to have a statistically significant influence on the PK 
parameters of TCZ: 
•  Body weight and HDL cholesterol on CL 
•  Body weight, total protein, and albumin on central and peripheral volume of distribution 
•  Normalized  creatinine  clearance  on  the  maximum  elimination  rate,  and  age  on  the 
absorption rate constant. 
Among  all  identified  covariate  relationships,  the  only  strong  covariate  dependence  was  the 
influence  of  body  size  on  TCZ  clearance  and  volume  parameters.  No  other  covariate  influence 
had a clinically relevant effect on TCZ PK. 
Body  weight  was  identified  as  the  best  predictor  among  three  body  size  parameters  (body 
weight,  body  surface  area,  and  body  mass  index).  TCZ  clearance  and  volumes  increased  with 
increasing body weight. For IV administration, the effect of body weight was accounted for with a 
body  weight−adjusted  dosing  regimen  (maximum  of  800  mg  for  patients  with  a  body  weight  of 
ε100  kg);  however,  this  body-weight  adjustment  resulted  in  a  higher  exposure  for  patients  of 
high  body  weight.  For  SC  administration,  flat  dosing  regimens  were  applied  and  TCZ  exposure 
decreased with increasing body weight. For the 162 mg SC qw and q2w regimens, steady-state 
exposure was consistently low for patients of ε100 kg and higher for patients of <60 kg compared 
with the majority of patients with body weight of 60 to <100 kg. In study WA22762, the steady-
state Cmean for the 162 mg SC qw regimen was slightly lower for patients with body weight of 60 
to  100  kg  compared  with  the  8  mg/kg  IV  regimen,  whereas  Ctrough  was  2.3-fold  higher.  For 
patients of ε100kg, steady-state Cmean and Ctrough for 162 mg SC qw were 3-fold and 30% lower 
than  those  of  8  mg/kg  IV,  respectively;  whereas  steady-state  Cmean  and  Ctrough  for  162  mg  SC 
qw were 30% and 4.7-fold higher than those of 8 mg/kg IV for patients of <60kg, respectively.

Effect of extrinsic factors on the pharmacokinetics of TCZ 
Neither  smoking  nor  the  route  of  administration  had  a  noticeable  effect  on  the  TCZ  PK 
parameters and thus were not included in the final PK model. Among three tested injection sites 
for  SC  regimens  (arm,  abdomen,  and  thigh),  the  effect  of  administration  into  the  thigh  on 
bioavailability  was  greater  than  those  of  arm  and  abdomen.  However,  the  difference  was  small 
(11%) and not clinically relevant. 
Pharmacokinetics of TCZ following administration with an autoinjector 
or prefilled syringe 
Study NP25539 
The  relative  bioavailability  of  TCZ  in  healthy  subjects  following  a  single  SC  dose  of  162  mg 
administered via a disposable AI or PFS was assessed in study NP25539. 
The data showed similar PK parameters of TCZ following administration via PFS and AI. Although 
the bioequivalence criterion was met for the secondary PK parameter, AUCinf, the bioequivalence 
of the AI compared with the PFS could not be claimed because the upper 90% CIs for geometric 
mean ratios (GMRs) for the primary PK parameters Cmax and AUClast (1.27 for both) fell slightly 
above the prospectively defined upper bound of the bioequivalence range (0.80, 1.25). 
Although  the  primary  analyses  did  not  show  the  two  devices  to  be  bioequivalent,  the  results 
showed that the time course for TCZ was very similar following administration of TCZ via the PFS 
and  AI.  The  estimated  GMRs  (AI  compared  to  PFS)  for  Cmax,  AUClast,  and  AUCinf  were 
approximately  1.09,  1.07,  and  1.04,  respectively.  These  values,  along  with  the  90%  CIs  for 
GMRs,  indicated  slightly  higher  average  exposure  to  TCZ  following  administration  via  the  AI.  It 
was  noted,  however,  that  all  individual  exposure  values  following  AI  administration  were  within 
the range of values observed with PFS, with the exception of the maximal Cmax value following AI 
(33.1  μg/mL,  compared  with  29.2  μg/mL  following  PFS).  Furthermore,  safety  results  from  both 
treatment groups were comparable. 
Study NA25220 
Study  NA25220  also  evaluated  administration  of  TCZ  SC  via  a  PFS  or  AI  in  the  LTE  phase  (i.e. 
from Week 24 onwards). Regardless of treatment up to Week 24, Ctrough levels were comparable 
between  the  PFS  and  AI  from  Weeks  24  through  36,  indicating  that  both  devices  delivered  a 
comparable dose of TCZ with each injection up to that point. Compared with the PFS, the Week 
40 and Week 48 Ctrough values for the AI were lower in patients who switched from placebo and 
higher  in  those  who  switched  from  active  TCZ  treatment.  Interpretation  of  this  finding  was 
limited by the low numbers of evaluable patients compared with available data up to Week 36. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Tocilizumab  binds  specifically  to  both  soluble  and  membrane-bound  IL-6  receptors  (sIL-6R  and 
mIL-6R). Tocilizumab has been shown to inhibit sIL-6R and mIL-6R-mediated signalling. IL-6 is a 
pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by a variety of cell types including T- and B-cells, 
monocytes  and  fibroblasts.  IL-6  is  involved  in  diverse  physiological  processes  such  as  T-cell 
RoActemra 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/606295/2013 
Page 29/157 
 
  
activation,  induction  of  immunoglobulin  secretion,  induction  of  hepatic  acute  phase  protein 
synthesis  and  stimulation  of  haemopoiesis.  IL-6  has  been  implicated  in  the  pathogenesis  of 
diseases including inflammatory diseases, osteoporosis and neoplasia. 
Primary pharmacology 
In clinical studies with tocilizumab, rapid decreases in CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 
and serum amyloid A (SAA) were observed. Consistent with the effect on acute phase reactants, 
treatment  with  tocilizumab  was  associated  with  reduction  in  platelet  count  within  the  normal 
range.  Increases  in  haemoglobin levels  were observed,  through  tocilizumab  decreasing  the  IL-6 
driven effects on hepcidin production to increase iron availability. In tocilizumab-treated patients, 
decreases  in  the  levels  of  CRP  to  within  normal  ranges  were  seen  as  early  as  week  2,  with 
decreases maintained while on treatment. 
Effect of TCZ SC on CRP and sIL-6R Levels 
The  sIL-6R-bound  TCZ  complex  and  CRP  are  two  key  PD  markers  for  the  TCZ  mechanism  of 
action. Greater increases in sIL-6R levels suggest more binding of TCZ to sIL-6R. CRP levels are 
suppressed after blockade of the IL-6 pathway by TCZ. 
The  profiles  of  sIL-6R  (see  figure  below)  and  CRP  (see  figure  below)  for  RA  patients  receiving 
TCZ  162  mg  SC  qw  closely  mirrored  those  receiving  TCZ  8  mg/kg  IV,  with  respect  to  both  the 
rate and magnitude of change. For patients on the TCZ SC qw regimen, there was a substantial 
increase  in  sIL-6R  levels  which  were  comparable  to  those  achieved  with  the  8  mg/kg  IV  q4w 
regimen  (study  WA22762).  An  increase  in  sIL-6R  levels  was  also  observed  with  the  SC  q2w 
regimen,  but  to  a  lesser  extent  than  was  observed  with  the  SC  qw  regimen.  However,  sIL-6R 
levels were notably higher for TCZ SC q2w compared with historical TCZ 4 mg/kg IV q4w data. 
The SC qw regimen provided complete suppression of CRP from Week 2 onwards, with mean CRP 
levels  slightly  lower  than  those  achieved  with  8  mg/kg  IV  from  Weeks  4  to  24,  consistent  with 
higher  trough  TCZ  concentrations  in  this  group  (see  figure  below).  The  SC  q2w  regimen  also 
provided  suppression  of  CRP  from  Week  2  onwards,  but  CRP  levels  remained higher  than  those 
achieved with SC qw or 8 mg/kg IV, but lower than those seen with historical 4 mg/kg IV data. 
These results indicate that the SC q2w regimen provides adequate suppression of CRP, but to a 
lesser extent than with the qw regimen.

Pharmacodynamic  effects  following  administration  of  TCZ  with  an 
autoinjector or prefilled syringe in study NA25220 
In study NA25220, following re-randomization, and irrespective of treatment up to Week 24, the 
levels of the various PD markers (sIL-6R, CRP, and ESR) were comparable between the PFS and 
AI  from  Weeks  24  through  48.  This  indicates  that  the  differences  in  TCZ  exposure  noted  at 
RoActemra 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/606295/2013 
Page 31/157 
 
  
 
 
Weeks  40  and  48  did  not  translate  into  a  discernible  difference  in  PD  effect.  However,  the  low 
numbers of patients at Weeks 40 and 48 limits this analysis. 
Immunogenicity 
The  overall  immunogenicity  rate  (defined  as  the  development  of  a  confirmed  postbaseline  anti-
TCZ antibody response) with TCZ SC was low and comparable to that previously reported for TCZ 
IV. 
At Week 24, the proportion of patients who developed anti-TCZ antibodies was 0.8% with the SC 
qw  regimen,  0.8%  with  the  8  mg/kg  IV  regimen,  and  1.6%  with  the  SC  q2w  regimen.  The 
proportion  of  patients  who  developed  neutralizing  anti-TCZ  antibodies  was  0.8%  with  both  the 
SC qw and 8 mg/kg IV regimens, and 1.4% with the SC q2w regimen. These rates are consistent 
with those previously reported for TCZ IV (0.6% and 1.0%, respectively). 
In the SC qw and q2w studies, data from the LTE phase showed that the proportion of patients 
who developed anti-TCZ antibodies was consistent with the Week 24 results. 
It should be noted with the 162 mg TCZ SC qw regimen used in study WA22762, there was the 
possibility for interference with the immunogenicity assay (because of high Ctrough TCZ levels); 
this  could  potentially  have  led  to  an  underestimation  of  the  incidence  of  immunogenicity.  As  a 
consequence,  the  protocol  for  study  WA22762  was  amended  (amendment  C),  to  allow  the 
collection  of  an  additional  serum  sample  to  analyze  anti-TCZ  antibodies  in  patients  who  had 
prematurely  withdrawn  from  the  study,  completed  the  study,  or  missed  TCZ  treatment  during 
the study. The data for the 162 mg TCZ SC q2w regimen used in study NA25220 are considered 
robust,  as  the  TCZ  Ctrough  levels  were  lower  and  were  not  expected  to  interfere  with  the 
immunogenicity assay. 
Effect of anti-TCZ antibodies on the pharmacokinetics of TCZ  
Anti-TCZ  antibodies  had  no  impact  on  the  PK  profiles  of  TCZ,  except  for  one  patient  in  study 
NA25220  for  whom  anti-TCZ  antibodies  may  be  related  to  the  change  in  PK/PD  profile  for  this 
particular patient. 
In  the  population  PK  covariate  analysis,  anti-TCZ  antibodies  were  not  identified  as  a  covariate 
influencing  the  PK  of  TCZ.  Neutralizing  anti-TCZ  antibodies  did  not  affect  the  evaluated 
exposure−safety and exposure−efficacy relationships. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Central  to  the  PK/PD  assessment  are  the  two  pivotal  studies  (studies  WA22762  and  NA25220), 
which  provide  data  on  SC  dosing  at  the  fixed  dose  of  162  mg  administered  via  the  prefilled 
syringe (PFS). The dose regimen proposed by the MAH i.e. q1w was studied in WA22762 only. In 
study NA25220 a q2w regimen was investigated.  
The use of single-use auto-injector (AI) was investigated in study NA25220 open-label extension 
part (q2w). Additional data on the comparison of PFS versus AI are derived from the single dose 
study NP25539 in healthy volunteers. 
Study  WA22762  directly  compared  the  already  approved  IV  posology  (8  mg/kg  q4w)  with  the 
162 mg SC fixed q1w dose that the MAH applied for as part of this extension application.

Assessment report

Of note, the observed Ctrough level was approximately 18 μg/mL in the IV arm which is nearly 
twice as high as the historical value (9.74 μg/mL) currently reflected in the SmPC. The MAH shall 
submit a variation to align section 5.2 of the SmPC for the IV and the SC route of administration 
with the corrected Ctrough value.  
For both the IV and SC route of administrations steady state was reached around week 12. The 
increase from baseline was in the SC group 5-fold and in the IV group 2-fold. Ctrough level were 
approximately 40 μg/mL in the SC qw arm and approximately 18 μg/mL in the IV q4w arm. With 
a KD value of about 1nM (corresponding to 0.15 μg/ml) for the binding of tocilizumab to IL-6R, 
this corresponds to 267 and 120 times the KD value respectively.  
Ctrough is highest at low body weight and decreases with body weight. This is mainly due to the 
flat dose in contrast to the weight adjusted IV dose, which led to a relative increase in exposure 
in  patients  with  low  body  weight.  In  comparison  to  IV  dosing  at  comparable  body  weight, 
Ctrough after SC administration in the low body weight category is 4-fold higher, in the mid body 
weight group 2-fold higher and about equal in patients with high body weight. This means that, 
in  patients  with  a  body  weight  below  100  kg,  steady  state  exposure  to  tocilizumab  is  at  least 
twice as high as with the approved IV posology. Even in patients with body weight > 100 kg, the 
Ctrough at week 24 after q1w SC application is as high as in the IV group corresponding to 120 
times the KD value. 
The results indicate that for patients >100 kg, the SC qw dose is required to achieve an adequate 
response  to  therapy.  Study  NA25220  demonstrated  that  as  expected  lower  Ctrough  level  are 
observed with the q2w SC dose regimen compared to weekly SC dosing. Steady state is reached 
later at week 20 with a 3.9-fold increase around week 24. The mean steady-state predose TCZ 
concentration  at  Week  24  was  approximately  7.4  μg/mL  following  SC  dosing  q2w  (higher  than 
previously reported in the small sized study NP22623). This corresponds to 49 times KD value for 
the binding of tocilizumab to IL6-R.  
Similar  to  the  q1w  SC  regimen,  increasing  exposure  with  decreasing  body  weight  is  also 
observed  with  the  SC  q1w  162  fixed  dose.  Ctrough  increases  by  2-fold  in  patients  <60kg 
compared  to  patients  with  average  body  weight  (60-100kg).  In  contrast  to  the  weekly  dose 
regimen,  however,  the  results  indicate  a  steeper  decline  of  Ctrough  in  patients  >100kg.  Given 
the low number of patients in this body weight category (5.8%), the results may be interpreted 
with  cautions.  However, they  could  also be  related to the low  serum  concentration level,  where 
non-linear  clearance  manifests,  and  thus  indicate  that  the  q2w  SC  dose  regimen  may  not  be 
appropriate for obese patients in providing reliably a sufficient Ctrough level for target saturation.  
In  patients  with  body  weight  >  100  kg,  the  variability  of  Ctrough  was  also  high,  which  may 
further  explain  why  despite  a  mean  Ctrough  at  wk24  after  q2w  SC  application  of  2.0  μg/mL 
corresponding to 13 times the KD value. 
A similar pattern arises with the q2w dosing as seen with q1w or IV dosing with regard to CRP, 
sIL-6R and ESR response. The drop in CRP below the ULN is observed also at wk2. A level below 
the  ULN  is  maintained  throughout  treatment,  which  is  only  slightly  higher  than  after  IV  or  2wq 
SC administration. 
SC bioavailability derived by population PK modelling (79.5%) is higher than previously reported 
from single dose studies (48.8% and 56.5% for the respective dose range of 162 mg). However, 
the CHMP is of the view that the most reliable assessment of bioavailability, which is affected by 
RoActemra 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/606295/2013 
Page 33/157 
 
  
clearance,  is  the  population  PK  approach,  since  it  takes  the  concentration-dependent  variability 
of the clearance into account. When applying compartmental modelling to the single dose study 
results  to  address  clearance  more  properly,  the  bioavailability  is  estimated  as  77%  (95%  CI: 
69% to 85%).  
With  regard  to  Ka  and  elimination  half-life,  since  it  could  not  be  determined  what  definitely 
caused  the  discrepancy  (of  ~2  days)  between  the  two  pivotal  studies  (sampling  intervals, 
differences  in  elimination  between  the  dose  regimens), Tmax  instead  of  absorption  half-life  has 
been included in section 5.2 of the SC SmPC and also the bioavailability is expressed in %. 
While there was no clear correlation between Ctrough and incidence of AEs there is a reduction of 
overall AEs and of infection/infestations in the q2w SC dose group compared to the q1w SC dose 
regimen and IV dosing. This could be related to the reduced incidence of grade 1-2 neutropenia 
observed with SC q2w dosing. These data suggest a trend towards reduced infection/infestation 
risk  with  162  mg  q2w  SC  dos  regimen.  There  was  no  apparent  association  between 
concentrations of tocilizumab and the occurrence of SAEs. This observation is consistent with the 
analysis  of  pooled  IV  data  from  four  Phase  III  studies.  The  incidence  of  SAE  was  comparable 
between the treatment regimens 
In general, the model parameters are similar to the estimates obtained earlier with the IV data 
suggesting  that  there  are  no  major  differences  between  exposure-response  relationships 
between the IV and SC formulations.  
There was a slight covariate effect of the injection site (arm, abdomen, thigh or “unknown”) on 
bioavailability  with  an  increase  in  Fsc  after  injection  into  the  thigh  by  11%.  There  are  however 
differences  in  the  covariate  effects.  Previously  identified  influences  on  the  population  PK-safety 
analysis  were  only  partially  confirmed  (CRP,  PCOR,  gender,  IL-6  level).  Age  was  a  newly 
identified effect on Kout in the current model, resulting in increased neutrophil reduction rate in 
older patients. Nevertheless, in none of the dose regimens did this result in a clinical meaningful 
difference.  
Overall,  the  influence  of  covariates  on  neutrophil  counts  over  time  depicted  in  simulations  was 
small and clinically not significant. 
With  regard  to  immunogenicity,  albeit  the  same  DP  was  used  in  all  three  phase  III  studies 
(WA22762,  NA25220,  MRA229JP),  there  is  discrepancy  between  the  studies  in  the  incidence  of 
ADA development after SC (0.8(q1w), 1.6(q2w), 15% (q2w)) as well as after IV dosing (0.8, na., 
5%  respectively).  The  MAH  clarified  that  the  differences  observed  were  due  to  different 
immunogenicity assay strategies, and were not related to assay methodology or other influences. 
This was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  TCZ  following  single  multiple  SC  administrations  were  studied  in  six 
Phase  I  and  II  studies  in  healthy  volunteers  and  RA  patients.  In  addition  PK  data  have  been 
collected from the two pivotal phase III studies (studies NA25220 and WA22762) for population 
PK modelling. 
The  PK  profile  of  TCZ  following  SC  and  IV  administration  differed  as  expected  based  on  the 
different route of administration and dosing regimen. IV administration of TCZ is infused over a 
short  period  of  time  leading  to  a  high  Cmax  followed  by  a  disposition  phase.  After  SC 
RoActemra 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/606295/2013 
Page 34/157 
 
  
administration, TCZ is absorbed through the lymphatic system into the venous system resulting 
in  a  lower  bioavailability,  lower  Cmax  and  longer  Tmax  compared  with  IV  administration.  The 
inter-subject  variability  of  plasma  levels  significantly  increased  but  is  more  pronounced  after 
single  administration  than  at  steady-state.  Steady  state  was  reached  after  12  weeks  for  AUC, 
Cmin, and Cmax like with the IV route of administration. 
After a single dose, the mean AUCinf for the 162-mg SC dose was approximately 6.4-fold higher 
than the AUCinf for the 81 mg SC dose while the corresponding ratio for Cmax was 4. The non-
linear clearance of TZC was more marked in the SC route than in the IV route. 
In  conclusion,  though  the  predefined  margins  for  bioequivalence  between  the  AI  and  PFS  were 
not met for primary PK parameters (AUClast and Cmax), the bioequivalence criterion was met for 
the  secondary  PK  parameter  (AUCinf).  In  addition,  the  mean  TCZ  concentration−time  profiles  of 
PFS and AI were near superimposable, which indicated that the rate and extent of absorption are 
comparable  following  AI  and  PFS  administrations.  Considering  the  variability  in  PK  parameters, 
the fact that the pre-specified margins for the upper 90% CIs for AUClast and Cmax were exceeded 
by 2%, this is not considered to be clinically relevant. 
In the population PK, among all identified covariate relationships, the only strong covariate was 
body size impacting on TCZ clearance and volume parameters. No other covariate influence had 
a clinically relevant effect on TCZ PK. The strong influence of body weight was already observed 
with the IV route hence the dosing regimen is expressed per body weight. In contrast, the TZC 
dose is a flat one at 162 mg for the SC route.  
The mechanism of action of TCZ administered via the SC route is not expected to differ from TCZ 
administered via the IV route. Therefore no new PD studies were submitted by the MAH with this 
extension  application  which  is  considered  acceptable  by  the  CHMP.  The  relationships  between 
concentration and effect and also concentration and safety have been satisfactorily discussed by 
the MAH for the new SC route of administration. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
No formal exposure-response evaluation has been performed by the MAH to register the SC route 
of administration. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Study NA25220 
Study  NA25220  was  a  phase  III,  two  arms,  two  years,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo 
controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study in patients with moderate to severe active RA who 
had  an  inadequate  response  to  DMARD(s)  that  may  have  included  one  or  more  anti−TNF-α 
agents  (with  the  percentage  of  patients  who  had  failed  one  or  more  anti−TNF  biologic  agents 
being capped at approximately 20%). The primary endpoint was evaluated at 24 weeks.

Treatments 
During  the  double-blind  period,  a  fixed  dose  of  162  mg  TCZ  or  matching  placebo  was 
administered by SC injection q2w until Week 24. The open-label period began at Week 24, when 
all patients who did not initiate escape therapy received a fixed dose of 162 mg of SC TCZ q2w. 
Escape therapy: 
• 
From Weeks 12 to 48, patients initially randomized to receive either TCZ or placebo could 
move to escape therapy with TCZ 162 mg SC qw if there was < 20% improvement in SJC 
and  TJC  from  baseline.  Such  patients  could  receive  open  label  treatment  until  the 
completion of the trial. 
•  After Week 48, if a ≥ 70% improvement from baseline in SJC and TJC was not reached, 
patients could be switched to treatment with TCZ 162 mg SC qw. 
If  a  patient  discontinued  for  any  reason  from  the  study  prior  to  Week  12,  he  or  she  was  not 
eligible  to  receive  escape  therapy.  All  patients  who  received  escape  therapy  had  radiographic 
assessments scheduled at Weeks 24 and 48. 
Study  drug  was  supplied  in  a  1-mL  ready-to-use,  single-use  PFS,  with  a  needle  safety  device, 
delivering  either  162  mg/0.9  mL  solution  of  TCZ  or  matching  placebo  and  stored  at  2ºC−8ºC. 
One PFS was used for each SC administration that was warmed to room temperature before use.

characteristics of these assays TCZ pharmacokinetic (PK)−safety and PK−efficacy 
relationships were also explored. 
Outcome/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
The  primary  endpoint  was  identified  as  the  percentage  of  patients  with  an  ACR20  response  at 
Week 24. The primary comparison was between the group of patients who received TCZ 162 mg 
SC q2w (Group A) and the group who received placebo SC q2w (Group B). 
Main efficacy secondary endpoints 
The main secondary efficacy endpoints were the following: 
1.  Proportion of patients with ACR50 response at Week 24 
2.  Proportion of patients with ACR70 response at Week 24 
3.  Change in Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) from baseline at Week 24 
4.  Proportion of patients with DAS28 < 2.6 (DAS28 remission) at Week 24

Sample size 
The  primary  analysis  was  based  on  the  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  population.  Based  on  previous 
ACR20  response  rates  of  patients  in  the  placebo  and  4-mg/kg  groups  in  the  Phase  III  TCZ  IV 
studies,  OPTION  (study  WA17822),  LITHE  (study  WA17823),  and  RADIATE  (study  WA18062), 
the expected ACR20 response was 23% in the placebo arm and 46% in patients treated with IV 
TCZ.  These  assumptions  were  used  to  generate  the  sample  size  for  this  trial.  A  sample  size  of 
600 patients, randomized at a ratio 2:1 (400:200 patients), would ensure at least 90% power to 
detect this difference with a significance level of 5%. 
The analysis of the progression of structural damage was a critical secondary objective. 
Assuming that patients treated with TCZ 162 mg SC q2w showed the same response as patients 
treated  with  TCZ  4  mg/kg  IV  in  the  LITHE  study,  and  the  response  of  the  placebo  SC  arm  was 
identical to the placebo IV arm in the LITHE study, then 600 patients randomized in a 2:1 ratio 
provided a power > 90% to detect a treatment difference between both arms. 
The  power  calculation  of  the  radiographic  analysis  was  based  on  simulations  of  the  Week  24 
LITHE  data  followed  by  analysis  with  the  van  Elteren  test.  This  non-parametric  statistical  test 
provides a p-value but not an estimate of the treatment effect. 
Randomisation 
Eligible  patients  who  fulfilled  the  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  were  randomly  assigned  at  a 
ratio  of  2:1  to  either  162  mg  SC  q2w  or  placebo  at  baseline  for  the  double-blind  period  and 
subsequently re−randomized at a 1:1 ratio within each treatment group at Week 24 for the open-
label period, utilizing an interactive voice response system (IVRS). 
The two sets of randomization numbers were generated by Perceptive Informatics, Inc. and were 
linked  to  a  unique  patient  identification  number  through  the  IVRS.  At  baseline,  randomization 
was  by  minimization,  stratified  by  geographic  region  (Europe,  North  America,  South  America, 
and  rest  of  world)  and  body  weight  category  (<  60  kg,  60  to  <  100  kg,  and  ≥  100  kg).  The 
minimization  procedure  was  implemented  by  Perceptive  Informatics.  This  involved  maintaining 
an updated record of treatment assignments by stratification factors and was used to determine 
the treatment of choice for a newly recruited patient. The minimization procedure was based on 
an  80:20  random  element  (i.e.  a  patient  was  assigned  to  the  treatment  of  choice  with  a 
probability of 0.8).Randomization at Week 24 was implemented by permuted block. 
Blinding (masking) 
This  study  was  blinded  during  the  first  24  weeks  and  a  “dual  assessor”  approach  was  used  to 
evaluate first efficacy and then safety data to prevent potential unblinding because of observed 
efficacy  or  laboratory  changes.  The  efficacy  assessor  was  a  rheumatologist  or  other  skilled 
arthritis  assessor  but  could  not  be  the  Principal  Investigator.  The  efficacy  assessor  was 
responsible  for  assessing  the  joint  counts  and  the  Physician’s  Global  Assessment  of  Disease 
visual  analog  scale  (VAS)  components  but  was  not  allowed  access  to  other  patient  data.  The 
safety  assessor  was  a  rheumatologist  or  medically  qualified  physician  with  access  to  both  the 
safety and efficacy data and was permitted to be the Principal Investigator. 
RoActemra 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/606295/2013 
Page 40/157 
 
  
Assessments completed by the patient and by the efficacy assessor were to be made before the 
assessments by the safety assessor. 
The  study  centers,  Roche  monitors,  project  statisticians,  and  the  project  team  were  blinded  to 
specific laboratory data (i.e., TCZ, IL-6, sIL-6R, and CRP) before the primary analysis. 
Blinding  of  the  treatment  received  was  maintained  for  patients  and  site  personnel  until  all 
patients completed Week 48 and all data for all patients up to that time point had been collected 
and reported. Unblinding by the Sponsor occurred at the time of the Week 24 primary analysis. 
Per  regulatory  requirements,  study  treatment  was  to  be  unblinded  for  all  unexpected  serious 
adverse events that were considered by the investigator to be related to study drug. There were 
no cases of treatment code breaks during the double-blind period of the study. 
After  the  Week  48  data  analysis  and  following  specific  instructions  from  the  Sponsor,  a  single 
assessor  approach  (using  a  qualified  physician  to  perform  all  efficacy  and  safety  assessments) 
could be used for subsequent visits during the open-label part of the study. 
Statistical methods 
The  primary  analysis  tested  the  null  hypothesis  that  the  percentage  of  patients  with  an  ACR20 
response  at  Week  24  in  Group  A  (TCZ  162  mg  SC  q2w)  was  the  same  as  the  percentage  of 
patients with an ACR20 response at Week 24 in Group B (placebo SC q2w). The null hypothesis 
was rejected if the percentage of ACR20 responders in Group A differed from Group B. 
To test whether treatment assignment by minimization did not affect the outcome of the study, 
the primary and secondary analyses were re-analyzed by the re-randomization or permutation  
Results 
Participants flow 
Of the 1034 patients screened, a total of 656 patients were randomized into the study. The main 
reason for screen failure was a lack of radiographic evidence of at least one joint with a definite 
erosion attributable to RA, as determined by the central reading site. 
Of  the  656  patients  enrolled  into  the  study,  437  patients  were  randomized  to  receive  TCZ  and 
219 patients were randomized to receive placebo (see figure below). 
All patients received at least one dose of study drug. However, 1 patient inadvertently received 
the wrong treatment. Patient 12001 received TCZ instead of placebo at baseline.

Conduct of the study 
There were two amendments of the protocol. 
Amendment B (24 February 2011):  
•  A TCZ AI was made available for use in the open−label portion of the study. 
•  Additional details for the analyses of the radiographic endpoint were included. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The  required  tests  for  the  liver  profile  were  clarified,  liver  profile  testing  was  added  at 
Week 36, and vital sign measurements were added at Weeks 10 and 36. 
The adjustment of the random element used to ensure a baseline randomization ratio of 
2:1 was clarified. 
To  prevent  any  potential  unblinding,  a  dual  assessor  approach  was  used  until  the 
completion of Week 48 data analysis. 
The  reporting  period  for  AESI,  including  nonserious  AESI  to  Roche  Drug  Safety  was 
clarified (i.e. within 24 hours of learning of the event). 
The requirement for an X−ray image at the initiation of escape therapy was clarified. 
Amendment C (26 April 2011) 
•  An  optional  ease-of-use  substudy  was  added  to  the  open-label  period  for  the  sites  in 
Canada and the United States in order to evaluate the ability of patients, caregivers and 
healthcare professionals to handle and use the PFS or AI. 
These two amendments of the protocol did not impact on the safety and efficacy analysis of the 
study. 
The change in the planed analysis (sensitivity analyses) was implemented prior to the unblinding, 
and had no impact on the efficacy and safety analysis.  
Baseline data 
Demographic data 
The  study  population  comprised  predominantly  Caucasian  (72.1%)  females  (84.7%),  with  a 
mean  age  of  approximately  52  years  (range  18−82  years,  see  table  below).  The  two  treatment 
arms  were  balanced  with  respect  to  all  baseline  demographic  characteristics  recorded.  The 
majority  of  the  patients  (67%)  weighed  between  60  and  <  100  kg,  with  27%  weighing  <  60  kg 
and  5.6%  weighing  ≥  100  kg.  The  maximum  weight  was  capped  at  150  kg  (per  the  exclusion 
criterion). 
The  baseline  demographic  characteristics  of  patients  in  the  ITT  population  were  consistent  with 
those observed in the safety population. A listing of baseline demographic characteristics for all 
patients randomized is provided.

Baseline RA disease characteristics 
Overall, the treatment arms were balanced with respect to RA disease characteristics. 
The duration of RA was 11.1 years in both arms (see table below). 
As  part  of  the  study  eligibility  criteria,  patients  were  required  to  take  DMARDs  (only  those 
permitted) at a stable dose for at least 8 weeks prior to baseline. Oral NSAIDs were permitted if 
a patient was on a stable dose regimen for ≥ 4 weeks prior to baseline. 
Patients enrolled in the study had been on a mean of 1.3 and 1.4 previous DMARDs in the TCZ 
and  placebo  arms,  respectively,  prior  to  baseline.  Patients  had  been  on  a  mean  of  1.1  and  1.2 
previous  NSAIDs,  respectively.  Approximately  20%  of  the  patients  in  each  treatment  arm  had 
failed prior anti-TNF treatment. 
Approximately  65%  of  patients  in  the  TCZ  arm  and  56%  of  patients  in  the  placebo  arm  were 
treated  with  oral  corticosteroids  at  baseline,  for  which  the  dose  was  similar  (median  dose  of  5 
mg/day in both arms). The majority of patients tested positive for rheumatoid factor (81% in the

TCZ  arm  and  82%  in  the  placebo  arm)  and  were  anti−cyclic  citrullinated  peptide  positive  at 
baseline (84% TCZ arm vs. 83% placebo arm). 
The percentage of the patients who failed prior anti-TNF treatment was 20.4% and 21.6% in the 
TCZ  and  placebo  arms,  respectively,  which  was  reflective  of  the  capping  rule  (the  protocol 
stipulated the percentage of patients who failed one or more anti−TNFs should be approximately 
20%).  The  baseline  RA  disease  characteristics  of  the  ITT  population  were  consistent  with  those 
observed in the safety population.

Van der Heijde modified total sharp radiographic score (mTSS) 
The mean change from baseline in the van der Heijde modified total Sharp radiographic score at 
Week  24  was  less  for  TCZ  (0.62  ±  2.692)  than  with  placebo  (1.23  ±  2.816),  suggesting  there 
was less joint damage following TCZ treatment.

A total of 410 patients in the TCZ arm and 209 patients in the placebo arm (including 70 and 88 
of the patients, respectively, who received escape therapy prior to Week 24) completed the 24-
week treatment period. As specified in the protocol, patients who withdrew prior to Week 24 and 
those who received escape therapy prior to Week 24 were not re-randomized at Week 24. 
An additional 7 patients received open-label treatment in the extension, although they had no re-
randomized dates in IVRS.

As of the clinical cut-off date (28 May 2012), a total of 11 patients withdrew from the study after 
Week  24,  including  3  (1.8%)  patients  from  the  TCZ  PFS  arm,  6  (3.6%)  patients  from  the  TCZ 
PFS-to-AI switch arm and 2 (3.3%) patients from the placebo to TCZ PFS switch arm. The most 
common reasons for withdrawal were AEs (5 patients overall).  
Among  the  escape  patients  who  received  escape  therapy  as  early  as  Week  12,  14  patients 
withdrew from the study: 3 were assigned to the TCZ q2w arm at baseline and 11 were assigned 
to the placebo arm at baseline. The most common reasons for withdrawal among escape patients 
were withdrawn consent (5 patients overall) and AEs (4 patients overall).

Baseline data 
Safety Population 
The study population was comprised predominantly of Caucasian (>70%) females (>80%) with a 
mean age of approximately 52 years (range 18-82 years). The four re-randomization treatment 
arms  were  balanced  with  respect  to  all  baseline  demographic  characteristics.  The  majority  of 
patients  (>65%)  weighed  between  60  and  100  kg,  with  <30%  weighing  60  kg  and  less,  and 
<5% of patients weighing 100 kg or more. The maximum weight was capped at 150 kg (per the 
exclusion criterion). 
Generally, the four treatment arms were balanced with respect to RA disease characteristics. The 
mean  duration  of  RA  disease  was  approximately  11  years  in  all  treatment  arms.  Median  oral 
corticosteroid  dose  at  baseline  was  5.0  mg/day  for  each  arm.  The  majority  of  patients  were 
positive  for  rheumatoid  factor  (ranging  from  78%  to  81%  in  the  treatment  arms),  and  the 
proportion  of  patients  with  a  positive  baseline  for  anti-cyclic  citrullinated  peptide  (CCP)  ranged 
from 76% to 85% in the treatment arms. 
Consistent  with  the  capping  rule  imposed  in  the  protocol,  the  proportion  of  the  patients  with 
inadequate response to anti-TNFs prior to study participation was 20.3% for the placebo to TCZ 
AI switchers treatment arm and was <20% in all other treatment arms. 
There were no noteworthy differences between the treatment arms with respect to the ACR core 
set  (the  number  of  swollen  and  tender  joints,  the  functional  status  [HAQ-DI]  at  baseline,  the 
patient and physician’s assessment of global disease status and patient pain rating, and CRP and 
ESR levels). The study population had moderate to severe RA disease, as reflected by the mean 
DAS28 ranging from 6.3 to 6.7 in the treatment arms. 
Escape Patients 
As mentioned previously, only those patients who initiated escape therapy between Week 12 and 
Week 24 are summarized and described in this report. Data for the seven patients who initiated 
escape therapy after Week 24 are included only in the listings. 
The  baseline  demographics  of  patients  who  received  escape  therapy  were  generally  consistent 
with  that  of  the  overall  safety  population.  The  proportion  of  patients  in  each  body  weight 
category was similar in the prior TCZ and placebo arms. Approximately 68% of patients in each 
treatment  arm  weighed  between  60  and  100  kg;  <30%  weighed  less  than  60  kg;  and 
approximately 6% of patients weighed more than 100 kg. More patients from North America and 
Rest of World received escape therapy compared with patients from Europe. 
The RA disease characteristics of the escape patients showed that the proportion of patients who 
were RF positive, anti-CCP positive, and who had failed one or more previous anti-TNF therapies 
was  higher  among  patients  who  received  escape  therapy  as  compared  to  the  overall  safety 
population.  The  ACR  core  set  and  DAS28  characteristics  for  escape  patients  at  the  initiation  of 
escape therapy were generally unchanged from baseline (with the exception of ESR and  CRP in 
the prior TCZ arm) and reflected the inadequate response in these patients.

Study WA22762  
Methods 
Study  WA22762,  otherwise  known  as  SUMMACTA,  was  a  Phase  III,  two-arm,  2-year, 
randomized,  double-blind,  double-dummy,  active-controlled,  parallel-group,  multicentre  trial  in 
patients with moderate to severe active RA who had an inadequate response to a stable dose of 
DMARDs  that  may  have  included  one  or  more  anti-TNF  biologic  agents  (with  the  percentage  of 
patients who had failed one or more anti-TNF biologic agents capped at approximately 20%). The 
primary endpoint was evaluated at 24 weeks.

Treatments 
IV Tocilizumab/Placebo 
During  the  double-blind  period,  patients  received  an  IV  infusion  of  8  mg/kg  of  TCZ  or  placebo 
q4w on an outpatient basis for a total of six infusions (baseline [Week 0, Day 1], Weeks 4, 8, 12, 
16, and 20). The last recorded body weight of a patient was used for calculating the TCZ dose for 
each  infusion.  No  study  treatment  was  scheduled  at  Week  24.  All  patients  were  to  be  re-
randomized for the open-label period at Week 24. 
After a 1-week dose interruption, patients assigned to receive 8 mg/kg of IV TCZ were to receive 
this  dose  q4w,  starting  at  Week  25  until  Week  93.  Infusions  were  administered  under  close 
supervision  of  the  investigator  in  a  setting  where  medications  and  resuscitation  facilities  were 
available. 
SC Tocilizumab/Placebo 
During  the  double-blind  period,  a  fixed  dose  of  162  mg  of  TCZ  or  matching  placebo  was 
administered by SC injection qw until Week 23. No study treatment was scheduled at Week 24. 
SC  injections  of  study  drug  (TCZ  or  placebo)  were given  using  a  pre-filled  syringe  (PFS)  with  a 
needle  safety  device.  The recommended  injection  sites  were  the  front of  the middle  part  of  the 
thigh  and  the  lower  part  of  the  abdomen  below  the  navel  (belly  button),  except  for  the  2-inch 
area directly around the navel. If a caregiver was giving the injection, the outer area of the upper 
arms could also be used. Injections were not to be made into areas where the skin was not intact 
or was tender, bruised, red, or hard. All patients were re-randomized for the open-label period at 
Week 24. After a 1-week dose interruption, patients assigned to receive 162 mg of SC TCZ were 
to receive this dose qw, starting at Week 25 until Week 96.

Objectives 
The primary objectives of the study were to assess: 
• 
• 
The efficacy of treatment with 162 mg TCZ given subcutaneously weekly versus 8 mg/kg 
TCZ given intravenously every 4 weeks with regard to non-inferiority of the proportion of 
patients who achieved American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response at Week 24 
The safety of treatment with 162 mg TCZ given subcutaneously weekly versus 8 mg/kg 
TCZ  given  intravenously  every  4  weeks,  with  regard  to  adverse  events  (AEs)  and 
laboratory assessments. 
The secondary objectives of the study were to assess: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Long-term safety and efficacy 
Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of TCZ following SC administration 
Immunogenicity of TCZ following SC administration 
Effect  of 
IV 
to  SC  switch  on 
the  safety,  efficacy,  pharmacokinetics,  and 
pharmacodynamics of TCZ. 
Specimens stored in the Roche Clinical Repository (RCR) were to be used to: 
•  Study  the  association  of  biomarkers  with  efficacy  and/or  AEs  associated  with  medicinal 
products; and/or 
• 
Increase the knowledge and understanding of disease biology; and/or 
•  Develop  biomarker  or  diagnostic  assays;  establish  the  performance  characteristics  of 
these  assays  TCZ  pharmacokinetic  (PK)−safety  and  PK−efficacy  relationships  were  also 
explored. 
Outcome/endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the ACR20 response rate at Week 24. 
For  the  ACR20  response  to  be  considered  positive,  a  ≥  20%  improvement  (i.e.  reduction) 
compared  with  baseline  was  required  for  both  TJC68  and  SJC66,  as  well  as  for  three  of  the 
additional five ACR core set variables: patient’s assessment of pain, patient’s global assessment 
of  disease  activity,  physician’s  global  assessment  of  disease  activity,  Health  Assessment 
Questionnaire (HAQ), and acute-phase reactant (either CRP or ESR). 
The secondary efficacy endpoints were the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Proportion of patients with an ACR50 response at Week 24 
Proportion of patients with an ACR70 response at Week 24 
Proportion of patients with a Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) < 2.6 (DAS remission) at 
Week 24 
Proportion of patients achieving a decrease of ≥ 0.3 in the HAQ-DI from baseline to Week 
24 
RoActemra 
Assessment report

Page 62/157 
 
  
• 
Proportion of patients who withdrew because of lack of therapeutic response at Week 24. 
Sample size 
The primary analysis was based on the PP population. Data from the initial three pivotal Phase III 
studies (studies WA17823, WA17822, and WA18063), evaluating 8 mg/kg of TCZ in combination 
with  MTX  versus  placebo  in  combination  with  MTX  in  DMARD−inadequate  responders  (-IRs), 
showed  ACR20  response  rates  for  the  PP  population  at  Week  24  of  58.5%  (study  WA17823), 
63.3%  (study  WA17822),  and  64.3%  (study  WA18063).  The  pooled  ACR20  response  rate  for 
these three studies was 62.5%. 
Assuming that Group B had an ACR20 response rate of 62.5%, 450 patients per treatment arm 
would be required to provide 90% power to demonstrate that Group A was non-inferior to Group 
B using a 12-percentage point non-inferiority margin and assuming that Group A was 1% worse 
than  Group  B.  Based  on  the  Phase  III  IV  TCZ  studies  described  above,  it  was  estimated  that 
approximately  25%  of  patients  would  not  be  eligible  for  the  PP  population.  Therefore,  a  total 
sample  size  of  600  patients  per  arm  was  planned  to  be  randomized  into  the  study  to  ensure 
adequate patient numbers for the primary analysis. 
In  addition,  a  sample  size  of  600  patients  per  arm  also  allowed  a  95%  chance  of  observing  at 
least 1 patient with a specific AE, if the AE had an event rate of at least 0.5%. 
Randomisation 
Eligible patients who fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomly assigned to two 
treatment groups at baseline for the double-blind period and subsequently re-randomized within 
each  treatment  group  at  Week  24  for  the  open-label  period,  utilizing  an  interactive  voice 
response  system  (IVRS).  These  two  sets  of  randomization  numbers  were  generated  by 
Perceptive  Informatics,  Inc.  and  were  linked  to  a  unique  patient  identification  number  through 
the  IVRS.  At  baseline,  randomization  was  by  minimization  and  stratified  by  geographic  region 
(Europe, North America, South America, rest of world) and body weight category (< 60 kg, 60 to 
100  kg,  ≥  100  kg).  The  minimization  procedure  was  implemented  by  Perceptive.  This  involved 
maintaining an updated record of treatment assignments by stratification factors and was used to 
determine the treatment of choice for a newly recruited patient. The minimization procedure was 
based on an 80:20 random element, i.e., a patient was assigned to the treatment of choice with 
a probability of 0.8. 
Randomization at Week 24 was implemented by permuted block. 
Blinding (masking) 
This  study  was  blinded  during  the  first  24  weeks,  and  a  “dual  assessor”  approach  was  used  to 
evaluate first efficacy and then safety data to prevent potential unblinding because of observed 
efficacy  or  laboratory  changes.  The  efficacy  assessor  was  a  rheumatologist  or  other  skilled 
arthritis  assessor  but  could  not  be  the  principal  investigator.  The  efficacy  assessor  was 
responsible for assessing the joint counts and the Physician’s Global Assessment of Disease VAS 
components  but  was  not  allowed  access  to  other  patient  data.  The  safety  assessor  was  a 
rheumatologist or  medically  qualified  physician  with  access  to  both  the  safety and  efficacy  data 
and was permitted to be the principal investigator. The study centres, Roche monitors, and study 
RoActemra 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/606295/2013 
Page 63/157 
 
  
team members were blinded to some laboratory data (i.e. TCZ, CRP, IL-6, and sIL-6R) before the 
primary analysis. 
Blinding  of  the  treatment  received  was  maintained  for  patients,  investigators,  and  Roche 
personnel  until  after  completion  of  the  last  patient  visit  at  Week  24  and  subsequent  database 
lock.  The  initial  randomization  for  the  double-blind treatment  will  be  unblended  to  investigators 
and patients after the primary analysis result is reported. 
Per regulatory requirements, study treatment was to be unblinded for all unexpected SAEs that 
were considered by the investigator to be related to study drug.  
After  the  Week  24  data  analysis  and  following  specific  instructions  from  the  Sponsor,  a  single 
assessor  approach  (using  a  qualified  physician  to  perform  all  efficacy  and  safety  assessments) 
could be used for subsequent visits in the open-label part of the study. 
Statistical methods 
Non-inferiority of 162 mg SC TCZ qw (group A) compared to 8 mg/kg IV TCZ q4w (group B) with 
regard  to  ACR20  response  at  week  24  was  to  be  concluded  if  the  lower  limit  of  the  two-sided 
95%  confidence  interval  (CI)  for  the  difference  in  percentage  of  ACR20  responders  on  group  A 
minus  group  B  was  not  less  than  −12%.  The  primary  analysis  was  performed  on  the  PP 
population,  excluding  all  patients  with  pre-defined  major  protocol  violations.  Patients  in  whom 
week  24  ACR20  was  not  available,  were  considered  non-responder  in  the  primary  analysis.  In 
case the null-hypothesis of inferiority of group A compared to group B was rejected, the analysis 
was to be repeated with a non-inferiority margin of -10%. 
As  a  sensitivity  analysis,  the  primary  analysis  was  repeated  for  the  ITT  population.  To  assess 
homogeneity of treatment effect, explorative analyses on the primary endpoint were performed, 
if  appropriate,  in  patient  subgroups  defined  by  region,  weight  at  baseline,  or  any  relevant 
clinically  meaningful  characteristics  at  baseline.  All  exploratory  efficacy  subgroup  analyses  were 
based on the PP population. 
To investigate whether treatment assignment by dynamic randomisation did affect the outcome 
of the study, the primary analysis was re-analysed using a re-randomization test. 
For secondary endpoints treatment effects at week 24 were characterised by point estimates and 
the  corresponding  95%  CI.  The  analyses  were  carried  out  using  the  PP  population.  No  formal 
tests for non-inferiority were performed given that a non-inferiority margin was only defined for 
the primary endpoint. 
No  formal  statistical  analyses  of  exploratory  efficacy  endpoints  were  performed  to  compare 
treatment arms at week 24. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Of the 2157 patients screened, a total of 1262 patients were randomized into the study. 
The main reason for screening failure was CRP < 10 mg/L (1 mg/dL) and ESR < 28 mm/hr prior to 
baseline (unvalidated data obtained from the IVRS).

Of  the  1262  patients  enrolled  into  the  study,  631  patients  were  randomized  into  each  of  the 
study arms (see figure below). All patients received at least one dose of study drug. 
Figure 8.  Overview of Patient Disposition 
Recruitment 
Patients  were  enrolled  at  209  centres  in  25  countries.  The  highest  recruiting  centres  were  in 
Bulgaria,  which  enrolled  1.9%  of  the  total  number  of  patients,  and  Poland,  Brazil,  and  Mexico, 
each of which enrolled 1.7%. 
The  first  patient  was  screened  on  18  August  2010,  and  the  first  patient  was  randomized  on  1 
September 2010. The last patient was randomized on 1 August 2011, and the date of the clinical 
cut-off for the 24-week analysis was 16 January 2012. 
Conduct of the study 
The  protocol  was  amended  twice:  on  19  November  2010  (Amendment  B)  and  on  2  December 
2011  (Amendment  C).  The  final  protocol  used  for  the  double-blind  period  of  the  study  was 
Amendment C.

Amendment B (19 November 2010) 
• 
• 
Following  one  case  of  a  fatal  hypersensitivity  reaction  in  an  IV  TCZ-treated  patient  that 
occurred in the post-marketing setting, additional guidance was added to the protocol.  
Event-driven blood sample collection for the analysis of anti-TCZ antibodies was included 
in  the  amendment  for  patients  who  withdrew  because  of  anaphylaxis  or  serious 
hypersensitivity 
Amendment C (2 December 2011) 
•  Additional  serum  sample  collection  for  the  analysis  of  anti-TCZ  antibodies  from  patients 
who had terminated from the study early, completed the study, or missed TCZ treatment 
during  the  study  in  order  to  adjust  for  the  higher  than  expected  mean  TCZ  trough 
concentration in the TCZ SC group. A longer washout period was required.   
These two amendments of the protocol did no impact on the safety and efficacy analysis of the 
study. 
There  were  no  key  changes  to  the  analysis  of  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  or  key  secondary 
endpoints after database lock. 
Baseline data 
Demographic Data 
The study population comprised predominantly Caucasian (76%) females (83%), at a mean age 
of  approximately  53  years  (range:  18-86;  see  table  below).  The  two  treatment  arms  were 
balanced with respect to all baseline demographic characteristics recorded. 
Geographic  region  and  body  weight  category  were  baseline  stratification 
factors  at 
randomization.  The  majority  of  the  patients  (67%)  weighed  between  60  and  100  kg,  with  23% 
weighing < 60 kg and 10% weighing ≥ 100 kg. The maximum weight was capped at 150 kg (per 
an exclusion criterion). 
The baseline demographic characteristics of patients in the PP population were consistent with of 
the safety population.

Baseline RA Disease Characteristics 
Overall,  the  treatment  arms  were  balanced  with  respect  to  RA  disease  characteristics.  The 
duration of RA was 8.7 years for patients in the SC arm and 8.6 years in the IV arm (see table 
below). 
From  6  months  prior  to  screening  to  baseline,  patients  enrolled  in  the  study  in  each  arm  had 
been treated with a mean of 1.4 of DMARDs (see table below). Approximately 55% of patients in 
the SC arm and 54% of patients in the IV arm were treated with oral corticosteroids at baseline 
for  which  the  dose  was  similar  (mean  of  7  mg/day).  The  majority  of  patients  were  positive  for 
rheumatoid  factor  (74%  in  each  arm)  and  anti−cyclic  citrullinated  peptide  positive  at  baseline 
(72%  SC  arm  vs.  76%  IV  arm).  The  study  population  had  moderate  to  severe  RA  disease,  as 
reflected by the mean DAS28 score of 6.6 (range: 3−9) for the SC arm and 6.7 (range: 4−9) for 
the IV arm. 
The  proportion  of  the  patients  who  were  anti−TNF-IRs  was  22.5%  in  the  SC  arm  and  21.6%  in 
the  IV  arm,  reflecting  the  capping  rule  (the  protocol  stipulated  the  proportion  of  patients  who 
failed one or more anti-TNF agents should be approximately 20%). 
The baseline RA disease characteristics of the PP population were consistent with those observed 
in the safety population.

Numbers analysed 
Of  the  1262  patients  enrolled  into  the  study  (631  in  each  of  the  treatment  arms),  all  patients 
received study treatment and were eligible for inclusion in the ITT and safety populations. 
The PP population comprised 1095 patients (558 SC arm, 537 IV arm), with approximately 13% 
of  the  overall  population  being  excluded  from  the  PP  population  for  one  or  more  reasons  (see 
table below). 
More patients in the IV arm (15%) compared with the SC arm (12%) were excluded from the PP 
population.  The  most  common  reason  for  exclusion  from  the  PP  population  in  both  arms  was 
because of the background DMARD not remaining at a stable dose (38 patients in the SC arm vs. 
37 patients in the IV arm). 
There was an imbalance in the number of patients excluded for receiving less than two-thirds or 
more than four-thirds of the total allocated SC treatment of TCZ or placebo (6 patients SC arm 
vs. 19 patients IV arm), and this was the second most common reason for exclusion from the PP 
population  in  the  IV  arm.  In  addition,  more  patients  in  the  IV  arm  than  in  the  SC  arm  were 
excluded  because  they  received  less  than  the  two-thirds  or  more  than  four-thirds  of  the  total 
allocated IV TCZ or placebo (5 patients SC arm vs. 9 patients IV arm). 
In  the  SC  arm,  the  third most  common  reason  for exclusion  was  “patients do  not  have  at  least 
one permitted DMARD with a stable dose for at least 8 weeks prior to baseline.” 
Eight  patients  were  excluded  despite  this  being  an  inclusion  criterion.  A  similar  number  of 
patients (7) were excluded from the IV arm for this reason. 
All  patients  who  reached  Week  24  (a  total  of  1136  patients:  572  in  the  SC  arm,  564  in  the  IV 
arm) were re-randomized to the 72-week open-label treatment period. Of note, 1 patient in the 
SC  arm  who  completed  the  double-blind  period  died  after  re-randomization  and  did  not  receive 
any open-label drug.

Table 20.  Analysis Population  
More patients in the IV arm (15%) compared with the SC arm (12%) were excluded from the PP 
population.  The  most  common  reason  for  exclusion  from  the  PP  population  in  both  arms  was 
because of the background DMARD not remaining at a stable dose (38 patients in the SC arm vs. 
37 patients in the IV arm). 
Six  patients  (2  patients  in  the  SC  arm;  4  patients  in  the  IV  arm)  were  excluded  from  the  PP 
population because of a treatment code break. 
In  2011  an  unscheduled  health  authority/ethics  committee  inspection  occurred  at  a  Lithuanian 
center.  As  a  result of  this  inspection,  critical  findings  related  to  GCP  were  reported.  Nine  of  the 
12  patients  randomised  at  the  site  were  eligible  to  be  included  in  the  per-protocol  (PP) 
population, 6 in the SC arm and 3 in the IV arm. An ACR20 response at Week 24 was achieved in 
2  of  the  6  patients  (33%)  in  the  SC  arm  compared with  3  of  3  patients  (100%)  in  the  IV  arm. 
Since  removal  of  these  patients  would  favor  the  efficacy  of  the  SC  arm,  it  was  decided  to 
maintain  patients  randomized  to  this  site  in  the  analysis  in  order  to  be  conservative  in  the 
primary  analysis,  which  was  based  on  the  PP  population.  No  sensitivity  analysis  was  performed 
on the data. All 12 patients were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Data from the 
12 patients were also included in the safety population as a conservative approach. 
Outcomes and estimation  
The  data  presented  are  based  on  the  primary  analysis,  which  was  conducted  after  all  patients 
had  completed  the  double-blind  treatment  period,  i.e.  24  weeks  of  study  treatment  unless 
prematurely withdrawn.  
The  population  used  for  the  primary  and  secondary  analyses  was  the  PP  population.  The  ITT 
population was used for sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint.

Study WA22762 LTE 
Results 
Participant flow 
The  first  patient  was  screened  on  18  August  2010  and  the  first  patient  was  randomized  on  1 
September 2010. The last patient was randomized on 1 August 2011 and the date of the clinical 
cut-off was 16 January 2012. 
From  2157  patients  screened,  a  total  of  1262  patients  at  209  centers  in  25  countries  were 
randomized into the study: 631 to TCZ SC and 631 to TCZ IV. The main reason for screen failure 
was CRP < 10 mg/L (1 mg/dL) and ESR < 28 mm/h prior to baseline. 
All of the 1262 patients received at least one dose of study medication. Of the 1262 patients, 572 
patients (91%) in the TCZ SC arm and 564 (89%) in the TCZ IV arm completed the double-blind 
phase  to  Week  24;  59  patients  (9%)  in  the  SC  arm  and  67  patients  (11%)  in  the  IV  arm 
withdrew from the study before reaching Week 24. One patient in the IV arm completed Week 24 
but subsequently withdrew before re-randomization due to lack of therapeutic response. 
At  Week  24,  patients  from  the  SC  arm  were  re-randomized  in  a  ratio  of  11:1  to  SC  and  IV, 
respectively, whilst patients from the IV arm were re-randomized in a ratio of 2:1 to IV and SC, 
respectively. The re-randomization resulted in 48 patients in the SC arm being re-randomized to 
IV (SC-IV switch arm) and 524 patients continuing with SC (SC arm). 
In the IV arm, the re-randomization resulted in 186 patients being re-randomized to SC (IV-SC 
switch arm) and 377 patients continuing with IV (IV arm). 
As  of  the  clinical  cut-off  date  of  16  January  2012,  21/524  (4.0%)  patients  in  the  SC  arm  and 
17/377  (4.5%)  patients  in  the  IV  arm  had  withdrawn  prematurely  since  re-randomization  (i.e. 
during  the  open-label  period).  Thus,  overall,  including  the  59  patients  who  were  withdrawn 
during  the  double-blind  period  from  the  SC  arm  and  the 68  patients  who  were  withdrawn  from 
the  IV  arm,  a  total  of  80/583  (13.7%)  patients  in  the  SC  arm  and  85/445  (19.1%)  patients  in 
the IV arm had withdrawn prematurely from the study by the time of the clinical cut-off. In the 
SC-IV  and  IV-SC  switch  arms,  there  were  1/48  (2.1%)  and  7/186  (3.8%)  withdrawals, 
respectively, between re-randomization and the clinical cut-off date. 
Baseline data 
Overall, the baseline demographic characteristics were well balanced across the treatment arms. 
The  majority  of  patients  in  each  treatment  arm  were  female  (75%  to  84%  across  arms),  white 
(74% to 83% across arms), and of non-hispanic ethnicity (65% to 70% across arms). The mean 
age ranged from 52.2 to 54.7 years across arms. The majority of patients weighed between 60 
and <100 kg (67% to 69% across arms), with 22% to 25% weighing < 60 kg and 6% to 10% 
weighing ≥ 100 kg. The maximum weight was capped at 150 kg (per the exclusion criterion). The 
majority of patients in all arms had never smoked (60% to 65% across arms) and had no known 
family history of chronic heart disease (73% to 82% across arms). 
The SC and IV treatment arms were well balanced with respect to RA disease characteristics at 
baseline.  Baseline  RA  disease  characteristics  in  the  smaller  IV-SC  and  SC-IV  switch  arms  were 
RoActemra 
Assessment report

Page 74/157 
 
  
comparable with those in the IV and SC arms, respectively. Some differences between arms were 
observed for baseline anti-CCP positivity, RF positivity, and certain ACR core set parameters. 
Numbers analysed 
Table 24.  Overview of analysis population (all patients) 
Based  on  the  original  randomized  SC  and  IV  populations,  110/583  (18.9%)  patients  in  the  SC 
arm  and  107/445  (24.0%)  patients  in  the  IV  arm  were  excluded  from  the  PP  population;  the 
most common reason for exclusion in these arms was not being re-randomized at Week 24 due 
to withdrawal during the double-blind period. The next most common reason was the background 
DMARD not remaining at a stable dose.

SC and IV Arms 
Within  the  SC  and  IV  treatment  arms,  ACR20  response  rates  tended  to  be  higher  in  patients 
weighing <60 kg (78% to 85% SC vs. 82% to 87% IV) and 60 to <100 kg (75% to 76% SC vs. 
71%  to  78%  IV)  compared  with  patients  weighing  ≥  100  kg  (55% to 58%  SC  vs.  39%  to  59% 
IV) from Weeks 24 to 49. The same was true for ACR50 and ACR70 response rates. 
Within  subgroups,  ACR20  response  rates  in  the  SC  and  IV  arms  were  comparable  at  Weeks  24 
and  37  in  all  three  body  weight  categories.  The  same  was  true  in  the  <60  and  60  to  <100  kg 
subgroups at  Week  49.  In  the  ≥  100  kg  subgroup,  the  response  rate  at  Week  49  was  higher  in 
the  SC  arm  than  in  the  IV  arm  (58%  vs.  39%);  however,  Week  49  data  for  the  ≥  100  kg 
subgroup  should  be  interpreted  with  caution  due  to  the  low  patient  numbers  (N=19  SC  and  13 
IV). 
More  variability  was  observed  for  ACR50  and  ACR70  responses.  Response  rates  in  the  SC  arm 
tended  to  be  lower  than  those  of  the  IV  arm  in  the  <60  kg  subgroup  but  comparable  with  or 
higher than those of the IV arm in the 60 to <100 kg and ≥ 100 kg subgroups. 
IV-SC and SC-IV Switch Arms 
Meaningful analyses of ACR20/50/70 by body weight at baseline were not possible for the switch 
arms due to the low numbers of patients and responses, particularly at the week 49 time point.

Pharmacodynamics  
Mean  sIL-6R  concentrations  were  generally  comparable  in  the  SC  and  IV  arms  during  both  the 
double-blind  and  open-label  extension  periods,  but  with  an  overall  trend  for  slightly  higher 
concentrations following SC dosing. 
Mean CRP concentrations in the SC arm were lower than in the IV arm at all time points between 
Week  4  and  Week  37.  At  Week  49,  mean  concentrations  were  0.11  mg/dL  in  the  SC  arm  and 
0.18 mg/dL in the IV arm. The trend for lower mean CRP concentrations in the SC arm compared 
with the IV arm is consistent with the observed trend for higher sIL-6R concentrations in the SC 
arm compared with the IV arm.

Baseline  RA  characteristics  were  balanced  across  the  two  SC  pivotal  studies  and  the  historical 
pooled IV pooled studies, with the following exceptions: 
• 
• 
• 
The  mean  duration  of  RA  was  longer  in  study  NA25220  (11.1  years)  than  in  Study 
WA22762 (8.6− 8.7 years) and the IV historical control studies (9.2− 9.7 years). 
The mean number of previous DMARDs was greater in the historical control studies (1.8− 
2.1 units) then in the two pivotal SC studies (1.3−1.4 units). 
The  proportion  of  patients  who  were  RF  positive  was  also  higher  in  study  NA25220  (81 
−82%)  compared  in  study  WA22762  (74%)  and  historical  IV  control  (77  −80%).  The 
proportion  of  patients  receiving  background  oral  corticosteroids  was  higher  on  both  SC 
pivotal  studies  (54%−  55%  on  Study  WA22762,  65%−  56%  in  study  NA25220) 
compared with historical IV control (37−45%). 
The  proportion  of  patients  who  were  anti−TNF-IRs  was  20  −  23%  across  the  four  arms  in  the 
pivotal studies, reflecting the capping rule (the protocol stipulated the proportion of patients who 
failed one or more anti-TNF agents should be approximately 20%) but was lower in the historical 
pooled IV control population (10.8− 20.8% across the arms).

Figure 12. ACR 70 response to week 24 (ITT population) 
Over  time,  the  ACR20/50/70  response  profiles  were  similar  for  the  SC  and  IV  route  of 
administration. Interestingly, at each time point, response rates for 8 mg/kg IV (WA22762) and 
placebo  SC  q2w  (study  NA25220)  were  higher  on  the  SC  pivotal  studies  than  the  historical 
pooled IV data.  
The response profile for 162 mg SC qw in study WA22762 was comparable to 8 mg/kg IV.  
Taking  into  account  the  different  placebo  rates  for  study  NA25220  vs.  historical  pooled  IV,  the 
response rates for 162 mg SC q2w over time were lower than SC qw and more comparable to 4 
mg/kg IV.  
The same trend was observed for the DAS28 reduction over time up to week 24. Decreases were 
similar in  the  SC  qw  and IV  arms  of  study  WA22762  and  greater  than  those in  the  q2w  arm in 
study NA25220 at all time points. Compared with the historical IV data, and taking into account 
the different placebo rates on NA25220 vs. historical pooled IV, the mean changes with SC q2w 
fell between those from the 4 and 8 mg/kg historical IV groups.

Clinical studies in special populations 
In  both  studies  NA25220  and  WA22762,  efficacy  in  various  subgroups  was  evaluated.  Notable 
differences in response were seen in both studies in the analysis by bodyweight. ACR 20, 50 and 
70 response rates indicated a comparable response rate in the TCZ SC treatment group for all 3 
parameters in the < 60 kg and in the 60 to < 100kg, whereas patients in the > 100 kg showed 
lower  response  rate  for  these  parameters.  Interestingly,  for  ACR  50  and  70  response  in  the 
highest body weight group was lower for the weight adjusted IV TCZ treatment than for the fixed 
SC TCZ dose.

Supportive studies 
Study MRA229JP 
Study MRA229JP is an ongoing Phase III study comparing TCZ SC with TCZ IV as monotherapy in 
patients with RA.  
The study objectives were to assess: 
• 
• 
The  efficacy  and  safety  of  TCZ  162  mg  SC  q2w  administered  for  24  weeks  in  patients 
with RA. 
Efficacy and safety of long-term administration of TCZ SC (up to 108 weeks), including in 
patients  who  performed  self-injections  using  either  the  PFS  (same  device  as  in  studies 
WA22762 and NA25220) or the AI (same device as in study NA25220). 
The  primary  endpoint  was  the  ACR20  response  rate  at  Week  24.  Non-inferiority  of  TCZ  SC  was 
claimed if the lower bound of the adjusted 95% CI for the difference between the response rates, 
TCZ SC minus TCZ IV, was not smaller than – 18 percentage points. The non-inferiority limit was 
defined to ensure maintenance of at least 70% of the ACR20 response seen with TCZ 8 mg/kg IV 
q4w versus placebo in previous trials conducted by Chugai.

The study enrolled 348 RA patients who were randomized 1:1 to one of the two treatment arms; 
12  patients  in  each  arm  were  prematurely  withdrawn  during  the  double-blind  period  and  one 
patient  in  each  arm  withdrew  prior  to  administration  of  study  drug.  Withdrawals  for  AEs  were 
reported in 3 and 9 patients in the TCZ SC and TCZ IV arm, respectively.

Study NP22623 
Study  NP22623  was  a  Phase  Ib,  two-arm,  randomized,  open-label,  parallel  group,  multi-centre 
12-week  study  in  patients  with  active  RA  who  had  an  inadequate  response  to  current  MTX 
therapy.  Patients  received  all  SC  injections  into  the abdominal  region  at  the  clinic  by  study site 
personnel, using a TCZ vial + syringe. 
The objectives were to investigate PK, PD, efficacy and safety of in patients with active RA. 
A  total  of  24  patients  were  planned  (12  per  group),  however  29  (15  qw  and  14  q2w)  were 
randomized. 
Patients in both groups showed clinical response, with 75% in the qw group and 64% in the q2w 
group  showing  an  ACR20  response  at  Week  12,  respectively,  while  the  mean  DAS28  score 
decreased from a value above 5.3 and 6.0 at baseline, respectively, for the qw and q2w groups 
to  2.9  in  both  treatment  groups  at  Week  12.  At  least  50%  of  patients  attained  good  response 
according to the EULAR classification at Week 12 in both groups.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  clinical  efficacy  is  supported  by  two  pivotal  Phase  III  trials  (study  NA25220  and  study 
WA22762).  Both  of  the  pivotal  studies  were  multi-centre,  two-arm,  randomized,  double-blind, 
controlled trials. 
The objectives of the studies were to assess the efficacy and safety of TCZ given subcutaneously.  
Study  WA22762  was  active  controlled,  the  comparator  was  TCZ  IV  and  in  study  NA25220,  the 
comparator  was  placebo.  Both  studies  had  24-week  double-blind  periods  followed  by  72-week 
open-label extensions in which patients were re-randomized to four arms of various treatments.  
In both studies, the open-label extensions are on going. The submission of the final clinical study 
report for study NA25220 and study WA22762 has been included as milestone in the RMP. 
Patients  with  moderate  to  severe  active  RA  who  had  an  inadequate  response  to  their  current 
DMARD,  which  may  have  included one  or  more  anti-TNF  agents  in  up  to  20%  of  patients,  were 
enrolled into the study. In general the disease defining inclusion criteria applied for both studies; 
with the exception of SJC and TJC. Less diseased patients with regard to the number of swollen 
and tender joints were accepted for study WA 22762. However this had no impact on the disease 
characteristics;  the  baseline  RA  disease  characteristics  (i.e.  baseline  ACR  and  DAS 
characteristics)  were  consistent  between  studies.  The  study  population  was  consistent  with  the 
population included in the Phase III IV TCZ program and represents the patients who receive IV 
TCZ. The disease duration was slightly longer in study NA25220 than in Study WA22762. Overall, 
the  demographic  characteristics  and  baseline  criteria  are  well  balanced  between  the  two 
treatment groups as well as between the two pivotal studies. 
In study NA25220, patients received TCZ 162 mg SC q2w or placebo SC q2w. Patients on escape 
therapy  received  open-label  TCZ  162  mg  SC  PFS  weekly.  In  study  WA22762,  patients  received 
TCZ  162  mg  SC  qw  or  TCZ  8  mg/kg  IV  q4w.  In  both  trials,  study  medication  was  given  in 
combination  with  DMARD  therapy.  All  patients  had  received  at  least  one  permitted  non-biologic 
DMARD at a stable dose at least 8 weeks prior to baseline and throughout the study. All patients 
who  completed  to  Week  24  were  re-randomized  for  the  open-label  period  (LTE)  at  Week  24. 
Although  the  applied  SC  TCZ  dose  was  identical  in  both  studies;  the  treatment  schedule  was 
different.  The  weekly  schedule  chosen  for  study  WA22762  is  supporting  the  claimed  dosing 
regimen  for  this  extension  application.  The  approach  to  investigate  in  the  two pivotal  trials  two 
different  TCZ  SC  schemes  namely  TCZ  162  mg  SC  q2w  and  TCZ  162  mg  SC  qw,  each  tested 
against a different comparator is not fully comprehensible. The development program would have 
benefited  from  a  head  to  head  comparison  of  the  TCZ  SC  regime  which  is  intended  to  be 
recommended  for  therapeutic  use  i.e.  TCZ  SC  qw  with  placebo,  especially  with  regard  to  the 
safety evaluation. Furthermore a direct comparison of both TCZ SC schemes with the authorised 
TCZ  IV  8  mg/kg  q4w  would  have  provided  further  meaningful  results  on  the  comparative 
efficacy.  
For study NA25220 the primary efficacy objective was to demonstrate the superiority of TCZ SC 
versus  placebo  SC  with  respect  to  ACR20  response  at  Week  24.  For  the  primary  analysis, 
patients  that  received  escape  therapy  were  considered  non-responders.  Secondary  objectives 
included prevention of progression of structural joint damage at Weeks 24 and 48; improvement

of physical function; long-term safety and efficacy; PK and PD of TCZ SC; and immunogenicity of 
TCZ SC.  
The primary efficacy objective of study WA22762 was to demonstrate the non-inferiority of TCZ 
SC  versus  TCZ  IV  with  respect  to  the  ACR  20  response  rate  at  Week  24.  Secondary  objectives 
included  long-term  efficacy;  as  well  PK  and  PD  of  TCZ  SC;  immunogenicity  of  TCZ  SC;  and  the 
effect of an IV to SC switch on the safety, efficacy, PK, and PD of TCZ. TCZ SC was considered to 
be non-inferior to TCZ IV if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference 
in ACR20 response between the two treatment arms was not less than −12% (SC minus IV). If 
the  primary  hypothesis  was  rejected,  the  95%  CI  calculated  from  the  primary  hypothesis  test 
was  to  be  used  to  test  against  a  10%  non-inferiority  limit.  The  MAH  was  requested  during  the 
evaluation to provide a clinical and statistical justification for the non-inferiority margin.  
In providing the clinical rationale for the non-inferiority margin (NIM), the MAH considered that if 
the  subcutaneous  (SC)  and  intravenous  (IV)  doses  to  be  studied  in  the  pivotal  study  WA22762 
were  equivalent,  due  to  natural  variability,  it  is  unlikely  that  the  difference  between  the  two 
doses in a clinical trial would be exactly equal to zero. 
Therefore, assuming that the SC dose is marginally inferior to the IV dose, the MAH considered 
what  treatment  difference  would  be  clinically  acceptable.  Presuming  2  or  3  out  of  10  (20-30%) 
patients  achieve  an  ACR20  response  on  methotrexate  (MTX)  alone,  an  additional  2  out  of  10 
patients (20%) achieving an ACR20 response provide a clinically meaningful difference between 
treatments. Thus, at least 20% more patients would need to achieve an ACR20 response at week 
24  with  tocilizumab  (TCZ),  compared  to  receiving  MTX  alone  to  provide  a  clinically  meaningful 
difference. 
To  define the  NIM,  ACR20  response data  from  the per  protocol population  (PPP)  of  three  Phase 
III  studies  of  TCZ  8mg/kg  IV  +  MTX  (WA17823  -  LITHE,  WA17822  -  OPTION  and  WA18063  - 
TOWARD)  vs.  placebo  +  MTX,  were  used.  The  populations  in  these  three  Phase  III  studies 
reflected  the  population  in  WA22762,  namely  patients  with  moderate  to  severe,  active 
rheumatoid arthritis who were MTX-IR / DMARD-IR, with no more than 20% prior anti-TNF use. 
The TCZ 8mg/kg IV ACR20 responses at week 24 for the studies were 58.5% (WA17823), 63.3% 
(WA17822)  and  64.3%  (WA18063),  and  28.1%,  29.8%  &  27.6%  for  placebo  +  MTX, 
respectively.  The  pooled  ACR20  response  for  TCZ  8mg/kg  IV  was  62.5%,  the  pooled  placebo  + 
MTX response was 28.2% resulting in a pooled treatment difference of 34.3%. 
Given  that  the  treatment  differences  between  placebo  +  MTX  vs.  TCZ  +  MTX  seen  in  the 
historical  IV  studies  gave  a  mean  treatment  difference  of  34.3%,  a  reduction  by  approximately 
one third meant a treatment difference greater than the minimum meaningful clinical difference 
of  20%  would  be  maintained.  Using  a  maximum  reduction  of  this  treatment  effect  of  35%, 
maintaining 65% of the treatment difference, would retain a treatment effect of 22.3% over MTX 
alone,  keeping  a  clinically  meaningful  improvement in  signs  and  symptoms.  The  NIM  of  12%  is 
then defined by 34.3% minus 22.3%, which equals 12.0%.  
The  MAH  therefore  believes  that  the  12%  NIM  is  statistically  sound  and  ensured  clinically 
meaningful  improvements  were  demonstrated  in  the  pivotal  study  WA22762.  The  CHMP 
concluded  that  the  MAH  provided  a  satisfactory  justification  for  the  non-inferiority  margin  in 
study WA22762 although done post-hoc.

The endpoints in both studies reflect study objectives and are in line with development program 
proposed in the draft Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products other than NSAIDs 
for  treatment  rheumatoid  arthritis  (CPMP/EWP/556/95  Rev.2).  Moreover  the  endpoints  are 
consistent with the development program of the IV formulation.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In study NA25220 the primary objective, demonstrating superiority of TCZ SC q2w over placebo 
SC  q2w  with  regard  to  ACR  20  response  rate  at  week  24  was  met.  The  ACR20  response  was 
60.9% in the TCZ SC arm vs. 31.5% in the placebo SC arm, the weighted difference between the 
treatment  and  placebo  arm  of  29.5%  (22.0,  37.0)  was  statistically  significant.  The  sensitivity 
analysis  of  the  ACR  response  rate  in  the  completer  population  (patients  with  a  valid  efficacy 
assessment at week 24; escape patients are excluded) demonstrated a response rate of 76.7% 
in  the  TCZ  group  vs.  55.6%  in  the  placebo  arm,  with  a  weighted  difference  of  22.2%  and  thus 
support  the  result  of  the  main  efficacy  analysis.  The  observed  difference  can  be  considered  as 
clinically meaningful. 
This result was supported by the analysis of the secondary endpoints e.g. the harder to achieve 
ACR50/70  response,  DAS28  remission,  and  decrease  in  HAQ-DI  of  ≥0.3.  The  mTSS  results 
indicate a greater reduction in the progression of joint damage between baseline and week 24 for 
the TCZ SC group compared to placebo. The adjusted mean difference of −0.598 was associated 
with  a  p-value  of  0.0149  or  0.0145  using  the  non-parametric  van  Elteren  test  or  analysis  of 
variance, respectively.  
According  the  protocol  patients  who  showed  less  than  20%  improvement  in  their  SJC  and  TJC 
from  baseline  could  receive  open  label  escape  therapy  (TCZ  162  mg  SC  qw)  from  week  12 
onwards.  Placebo  patients  who  switched  to  escape  therapy  showed  12  and  24  weeks  after 
initiation  of  the  therapy  an  ACR  20  /50/50  response  in  the  same  range  as  patients  in  study 
WA22762 study (using the same treatment regimen as for escape therapy).  
Furthermore, the patients who switched from TCZ SC q2w-to-qw escape therapy showed a lower 
response  rate  than  the  placebo  patients  but  had  still  a  benefit  from  the  switch  in  treatment 
schedule. The MAH suggested that the lower response rate for patients in the TCZ SC q2w-to-qw 
escape  group  compared  to  placebo  patients  switching  to  escape  therapy  probably  reflects  the 
inclusion  patients  who  were  true  TCZ  non-responders.  Of  note,  no  differences  in  the 
demographics  disease  characteristics  of  the  escape  patients  and  the  overall  safety  population 
were observed. However, the RA disease characteristics of the escape patients showed that the 
proportion of patients who were RF positive, anti-CCP positive, and who had failed one or more 
previous  anti-TNF  therapies  was  higher  among  patients  who  received  escape  therapy  as 
compared  to  the  overall  safety  population.  The  ACR  core  set  and  DAS28  characteristics  for 
escape patients at the initiation of escape therapy were generally unchanged from baseline (with 
the  exception  of  ESR  and  CRP  in  the  prior  TCZ  arm)  and  reflected  the  inadequate  response  in 
these  patients.  The  CHMP  agreed  that  there  might  be  a  true  TCZ  non-responder  population, 
however to date no robust biomarkers are available to identify these patients.  
According  to  the  study  protocol  the  patients  received  concomitant  DMARDs,  the  choice  of  the 
medication  was  left  to  the  investigator.  It  is  understood  majority  of  patients  received  MTX.  No 
analysis if the efficacy result with regard to the concomitant DMARDs is provided.

During  the  evaluation,  the  MAH  clarified  that  both  Phase  III  studies  WA22762  and  NA25220, 
required  patients  to  receive  background  stable  doses  of  at  least  one  non-biologic  DMARD. 
Permitted  non-biologic  DMARDs  were:  azathioprine,  chloroquine,  hydroxychloroquine, 
leflunomide, MTX and sulfasalazine. DMARDs could be given alone or in combination, except for 
the  combination of  MTX  and  leflunomide  which  was  prohibited  due  to  hepatotoxicity.  Data  from 
these  two  studies  were  analysed  separately:  the  primary  endpoint  ACR20  at  week  24,  and  key 
secondary  endpoints  (which  represented  a  range  of  efficacy  measures  that  had  been  pre-
specified  in  the  protocols  and  Statistical  Analysis  Plans),  stratified  by  MTX  use  in  a  post  hoc 
analysis. 
In study WA22762, in the Per Protocol (PP) population at baseline, of the TCZ-SC qw group there 
were 453 (81.2%) patients who received MTX (alone or in combination with other DMARDs) from 
a total of 558; in the TCZ-IV 8mg/kg every 4  weeks group 444 (82.7%) patients received MTX 
(alone or in combination with other DMARDs), from a total of 537 patients. 
For  the  primary  end  point,  the  proportion  of  patients  achieving  an  ACR20  response  for  TCZ-SC 
qw+MTX  were  comparable  to  those  in  the  overall  study  population  who  were  receiving 
background  MTX  and/or  other  non-biologic  DMARDs.  ACR20  reponses  were  also  similar  for 
patients receiving TCZ-IV 8mg/kg every 4 weeks + MTX to those in the overall study population 
who  were  receiving  background  MTX  and/or  other  non-biologic  DMARDs.  Additonally,responses 
were  similar  overall  between  TCZ-SC  qw+MTX  a  TCZ-IV  8mg/kg  4  weekly+MTX.  Analyses 
stratified by MTX use were also performed on the following secondary end points: ACR50 and 70, 
proportion  of  patients  achieving  DAS  28  remission  (<2.6),  and  proportion  of  patients  achieving 
decrease  in  HAQ-DI  score  of  ≥0.3.  Across  all  the  secondary  end  points  analysed:  signs  and 
symptoms (ACR50/70 and DAS28 remission) and physical function (HAQ-DI), efficacy responses 
were  similar  between  the  TCZ-SC  qw  and  TCZ-IV  8  mg/kg  groups  with  background  MTX  or  the 
overall patient population. 
In study NA25220, in the Intent to Treat (ITT) population at baseline, of the 437 patients in the 
TCZ-SC q2w group, 361 (82.6%) received MTX (alone or in combination with other DMARDs); of 
the  219  patients  in  the  PBO  group,  174  (79.5%)  patients  were  receiving  MTX  (alone  or  in 
combination with other DMARDs). 
For  the  primary  end  point,  the  proportion  of  patients  achieving  an  ACR20  response  for  TCZ-SC 
q2w  were  comparable  for  patients  receiving  background  MTX  and  those  in  the  overall  study 
population  who  were  receiving  background  MTX  and/or  other  non-biologic  DMARDs.  ACR20 
response rates for TCZ-SC q2w were substantially higher than the rates observed with placebo, 
for  both  patients  on  background  MTX  and  those  in  the  overall  study  population.  An  analysis 
stratified by MTX use  was also performed on the following key secondary efficacy end points at 
week  24:  proportion  of  patients  achieving  ACR50  and  70,  proportion  of  patients  achieving  DAS 
28  remission(  <2.6),  proportion  of  patients  achieving  decrease  in  HAQ-DI  score  of  ≥0.3,  and 
mean difference in mTSS  from baseline to week 24. As with the overall study population, there 
was a substantial efficacy advantage for TCZ-SC q2w over PBO for patients on MTX across all key 
secondary  endpoints,  including  reduction  in  the  signs  and  symptoms  of  RA  (ACR20/50  and 
DAS28),  improvement  in  physical  function  (HAQDI),  and  reduction  in  progression  of  joint 
damage (mTSS).

The  post-hoc  analysis  provided  by  the  MAH  showed  comparable  efficacy  with  regard  to  the 
primary  and  key  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  in  patients  receiving  TCZ  with  background  MTX 
and the overall study population.  
The  clinical  study  report  NA25220-LTE  presented  data  up  to  the  clinical  cut-off  date  of  28  May 
2012. The data analysis provides data up to 48 weeks. So far the data indicated that the efficacy 
of  TCZ  162  mg  SC  q2w  was  maintained  after  the  24-week  double-blind  period  of  the  study. 
Evaluation  of  the  efficacy  data  in  patients  who  switched  from  PFS  to  AI  showed  in  general 
comparative  efficacy.  For  the  patients  who  received  placebo  during  the  double-blind  phase  and 
were  then  re-randomized  at  week  24  to  receive  TCZ  162  mg  q2w  using  either  the  AI  or  PFS 
comparable  results  were  obtained  for  the  PFS  vs.  AI  for  ACR20,  mean  change  in  HAQ-DI,  and 
decrease  in  HAQ-DI  ≥  0.3,  but  numerically  higher  responses  were  observed  with  the  PFS  for 
ACR50/70, mean DAS28, mean change in DAS28 from baseline, and DAS28 remission. However 
no  robust  conclusion  can  be  drawn  since  the  sample  size  in  these  arms  is  rather  small  (i.e.  60 
and 59 patients per group). Of note, the MAA is limited to the use of PFS.  
During  the  evaluation,  the  MAH  provided  further  data  from  ongoing  study  NA25220-LTE  at  the 
clinical cut-off of 29 October 2012. These data indicate that the treatment response was largely 
maintained.  Reduction  in  progression  of  joint  damage  (assessed  by  change  in  mTSS  and  APR) 
was also maintained through Week 48. The submission of the final clinical study report for study 
NA25220 has been included as a milestone in the RMP. 
In study WA22762 the primary objective demonstrating the non-inferiority of TCZ SC to TCZ IV 
was met. In the PP population, 69.4% (95% CI: 65.5%, 73.2%) of patients in the TCZ SC arm 
achieved an ACR20 response at Week 24 compared with 73.4% (95% CI: 69.6%, 77.1%) in the 
TCZ IV arm, with a weighted difference between the arms of −4.0% (95% CI: -9.2%, 1.2%), the 
lower  limit  of  the  95%-CI  for  the  difference  between  arms  (-9.2%)  was  above  the  pre-defined 
non-inferiority margin of -12%. These results were confirmed in robustness analyses on the ITT 
population, ACR20: −2.7% (lower boundary of the 95% CI −7.6%). Again, according the study 
protocol  the  patients  received  concomitant DMARDs.  However  the  choice of  the  medication  was 
left  to  the  investigator.  During  the  evaluation  the  MAH  provided  a  post-hoc  analysis  on 
concomitant  DMARDs  use.  For  the  primary  end  point,  the  proportion  of  patients  achieving  an 
ACR20  response  for  TCZ-SC  qw+MTX  were  comparable  to  those  in  the  overall  study  population 
who were receiving background MTX and/or other non-biologic DMARDs. ACR20 responses were 
also  similar  for  patients  receiving  TCZ-IV  8mg/kg  every  4  weeks  +  MTX  to  those  in  the  overall 
study  population  who  were  receiving  background  MTX  and/or  other  non-biologic  DMARDs. 
Additionally,  responses  were  similar  overall  between  TCZ-SC  qw+MTX  a  TCZ-IV  8mg/kg  4 
weekly+MTX.  
The clinical cut-off date for the extension phase study WA22762 LTE was 16 January 2012. The 
efficacy  of  TCZ  162  mg  SC  qw  was  maintained  after  the  24-week  double-blind  period  of  the 
study.  The  ACR  response  rate  in  the  SC-IV  switch  arm  was  lower  than  in  the  other  arms,  at 
various  time  points,  including  week  24,  however  the  sample  size  for  is  limited,  thus  no  robust 
conclusion can be drawn.  
During  the  evaluation  the  MAH  provided  further  data  from  ongoing  study  WA22762-LTE  at  the 
clinical  cut-off  of  12  October  2012.  These  data  indicate  that  the  treatment  response  was 
maintained  in  TCZ  treated  patients.  The  submission  of  the  final  clinical  study  report  for  study 
WA22762 has been included as a milestone in the RMP.

In  both  studies  efficacy  in  various  subgroups  was  evaluated.  Notable  differences  in  response 
were  seen  in  both  studies  in  the  analysis  by  bodyweight.  ACR  20,  50  and  70  response  rates 
indicated a comparable response rate in the TCZ SC treatment group for all 3 parameters in the 
< 60 kg and in the 60 to < 100kg, whereas patients in the > 100 kg showed lower response rate 
for  these  parameters.  Interestingly,  for  ACR  50  and  70,  response  in  the  highest  body  weight 
group was lower for the weight adjusted IV TCZ treatment than for the fixed SC TCZ dose.  
Analysis  of  ACR  response  by  regions  revealed  comparable  response  rates  across  the  different 
regions  (Europe,  South  America,  others)  but  North  America.  Irrespective  of  the  treatment 
received,  patients  in  North  America  demonstrated  a  lower  response  to  therapy  compared  with 
those from other regions. This finding is consistent with the results from the historical IV data.  
The  applicant  provided  a  comparative  analysis  of  the  week  24  results  for  the  two  pivotal  SC 
studies  NA25220  and  WA22762  and  a  comparison  of  the  results  with  the  24-week  pooled  IV 
historical  data  (TCZ  application).  In  general  the  baseline  demographic  characteristics  were  well 
balanced  across  the  studies.  Baseline  RA  characteristics  were  also  well  balanced  between  the 
studies with exception of RA duration which was longer in study NA25220; the proportion of RF 
positive  patients,  which  was  also  higher  in study  NA25220;  the  proportion  of  patients  receiving 
background corticosteroids, which was higher in the SC studies and the mean number of previous 
DMARDS which was higher in the pivotal studies.  
TCZ  treated  patients  in  the  SC  studies  had  a  higher  ACR  20/50/70  responses  rate  than  the 
historical  control,  this  was  also  seen  in  the  placebo  groups.  When  taking  into  account  the 
difference  in  placebo  response  at  Week  24,  the  ACR20  response  rate  for  TCZ  SC  q2w  fell 
between  that  of  historical  4  mg/kg  IV  and  8  mg/kg  IV  data,  whereas  for  the  higher  hurdles  of 
ACR50 and ACR70, the SC q2w responses were closer to the response seen with the historical 8 
mg/kg IV data.  
Analysis of the escape data demonstrated that patients who initially failed to respond adequately 
to the TCZ SC q2w regimen may benefit from the  weekly TCZ SC regimen and thus these data 
support  the  dosing  regimen  claimed  by  the  MAH.  However  under  the  light  of  the  comparative 
data  with  the  historic  IV  data,  one  can  argue  that  initiating  treatment  with  a  weekly  schedule 
might  be  appropriate.  In  case  of  inadequate  response  the  patient  might  switch  to  a  weekly 
regimen. Based on the collected clinical evidence supporting TCZ administered SC qw, the  MAH 
believed that 162 mg every week is the most effective dosing regimen for all patients across all 
body weights and patient subpopulation. According to the MAH, the most important arguments is 
that  the  PD,  efficacy  and  safety  results  for  TCZ  SC  qw  are  comparable  with  the  approved  IV 
8mg/kg every 4 weeks regimen which provides rapid and sustained reduction in disease activity. 
The  MAH  therefore  concluded  that  TCZ  SC  qw  is  the  most  appropriate  dose  regimen  to  initiate 
and continue therapy for patients with RA. The CHMP was in agreement with the MAH’s position. 
The  preliminary  results  (24  weeks)  of  the  smaller  monotherapy  study  in  Japanese  RA  patients, 
comparing  TCZ  162  mg  SC  q2w  or  TCZ  8  mg/kg  IV  q4w  showed  consistent  results  with  the 
pivotal  studies  with  regard  to  the  ACR20/50/70  response,  the  primary  endpoint  demonstrating 
non-inferiority  between  the  two  arms  with  regard  to  the  proportion  of  ACR20  responders  was 
met.  
On  20  December  2013,  the  MAH  reported  a  needle  clogging  issue  affecting  the  new  pre-filled 
syringe  presentation  (see  section  2.2.3  Finished  Medicinal  Product).  To  further  strengthen  the 
mitigation  statements  already  included  in  the  SmPC  and  PL,  the  MAH  proposed  to  add  some 
RoActemra 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/606295/2013 
Page 103/157 
 
  
further changes to sections 6.3 and 6.6 of the SmPC and sections 5 and 6 of the PL. The CHMP 
considered the  proposed  changes  suitable  to  reduce  the  probability  of  a  clogged  syringe  due  to 
handling errors. The MAH in addition discussed what happens if a patient uses a pre-filled syringe 
with such defect. It was clarified that if a patient attempt to administer an injection with a pre-
filled syringe that is clogged, the patient would unlikely be able to expel any drug product from 
the syringe. The failure mode is considered highly detectable. Assuming a replacement pre-filled 
syringe  is  at  hand,  the  dose  would  not  be  missed.  If  no  replacement  pre-filled  syringe  is 
available,  the  dose  would  be  delayed  or  missed.  Results  from  studies  WA22762  and  NA25220 
indicate that if a patient on the TCZ QW regimen has a single dose missed or delayed or a partial 
dose of TCZ SC there would be no impact on efficacy. The probability of receiving a partial dose 
from  a  clogged  needle  is  extremely  low  as  a  needle  clog  is  more  likely  to  completely  block  the 
needle  so  no  injection  can  be  given.  The  CHMP  concluded  that  there  is  no  impact  on  clinical 
efficacy due to clogging incidents when using the pre-filled syringe.  
With  regards  to  the  exceeded  limit  of  the  injection  time  with  the  pre-filled  pen  reported  by  the 
MAH  on  31/01/2014,  the  MAH  withdrew  this  new  presentation  on  11  February  2014.  The  MAH 
also  confirmed  their  ability  to  ensure  commercial  supply  of  the  pre-filled  syringe  to  all 
rheumatoid arthritis patients once approved and to subjects enrolled in on-going clinical studies. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
TCZ  IV  in  combination  with  methotrexate  (MTX)  is  an  established  treatment  option  for  adult 
patients with RA. In study WA22762 the non-inferiority of TCZ 162mg SC qw to TCZ 8mg/kg IV 
q4w  in  terms  of  efficacy  was  demonstrated.  The  primary  objective  demonstrating  the  non-
inferiority of TCZ SC qw over TCZ IV q4w with regard to ACR 20 response rate at week 24 was 
met. These results are supported by the secondary objectives, comparable response rates were 
observed for e.g. ACR 50/ 70 response.  
The  clinical  cut-off  date  of  for  the  extension  phase  study  WA22762  LTE  allowing  for  a  switch 
between  IV  and  SC  application  was  16  January  2012.  The  efficacy  of  TCZ  162  mg  SC  qw  was 
maintained after the 24-week double-blind period of the study. However the ACR response rate 
in the SC-IV switch arm was lower than in the other arms, at various time points, including week 
24.  Since  the  sample  size  is  limited,  long-term  safety  in  patients in  the  switcher  patient  will  be 
further investigated in the BSRBR registry as detailed in the RMP. 
Notable  difference  in  response  was  seen  in  the  analysis  by  bodyweight.  ACR  20,  50  and  70 
response  rates  indicated  a  comparable  response  rate  in  the  TCZ  SC  treatment  group  for  all  3 
parameters in the < 60 kg and in the 60 to < 100kg, whereas patients in the > 100 kg showed 
lower  response  rate  for  these  parameters.  Interestingly,  for  ACR  50  and  70  response  in  the 
highest body weight group was lower for the weight adjusted IV TCZ treatment than for the fixed 
SC TCZ dose. A statement has been included in section 5.1 of the SmPC regarding the impact of 
switching from IV to SC on exposure particularly in light and heavy body weight patients 
According  to  the  study  protocol  the  patients  received  concomitant  DMARDs,  the  choice  of  the 
medication  was  left  to  the  investigator.  It  is  understood  that  the  majority  of  patients  received 
MTX.  The  post  hoc  analysis  from  study  NA25220  and  study  WA22762  comparing  efficacy  in 
patients  receiving  TCZ  with  background  MTX  with  the  overall  study  population  showed 
comparable efficacy on the primary and key secondary endpoints.

Following reports of clogging of the needle with the new pre-filled syringe presentation, the MAH 
proposed  changes to the product information  in  sections  6.3  and 6.6  of the  SmPC  as  well  as in 
the Package Leaflet. This is supported by CHMP. The CHMP concluded that there is no impact on 
clinical efficacy  due  to  clogging  incidents  when  using  the pre-filled  syringe device.  With  regards 
to  the  exceeded  limit  of  the  injection  time  with  the  pre-filled  pen,  the  MAH  withdrew  this  new 
presentation.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The  safety  assessment  of  TCZ  SC  is  based  on  two  pivotal  phase  III  clinical  studies  (studies 
NA25220 / LTE and WA22762 / LTE).  
A  safety  analysis  from  the  original  Phase  III  clinical  development  program  for  the  intravenous 
(IV) dosage form of TCZ in adult RA following 24 weeks of treatment (data submitted as part of 
initial MAA) are also summarised. 
This data base is further supported by data from the safety analysis analyses on SC TCZ from a 
completed  Phase  Ib  study  NP22623  in  RA  patients  and  two  Chugai  monotherapy  trials,  the 
complete Phase I/II study MRA227JP, and the phase III study MRA229JP. 
Additionally a summary of safety information from the Phase I clinical development program for 
SC TCZ in healthy volunteers is also included in the submission.

Patient exposure 
The safety population included all patients who received at least one dose of TCZ (SC or IV) and 
had least one post-dose safety assessment.  
In  the  pivotal  studies  a  total  of  1465  patients  were  exposed  to  TCZ  SC.  This  includes  patients 
treated  with  TCZ  SC  during  the  24  weeks  core  and  the  LTE  part  of  study  NA25220  and  study 
WA25220  as  well  as  patients  who  switched  from  placebo  to  TSZ  SC  in  the  LTE  part  of  study 
NA25220 and who switched from TCZ IV to TCZ SC in study WA25220 LTE.

Table 46.  Overview of all AEs in pooled TCZ SZ and IV TCZ application all exposure 
population 
In study NA25220 the most common SOCs (≥ 10% of patients in either arm) in which AEs were 
reported were: 
• 
• 
Infections  and  infestations  (30.0%  TCZ  arm  vs.  28.0%  placebo  arm):  most  commonly, 
upper respiratory tract infections (6.4% in each treatment arm), urinary tract infections 
(4.1% vs. 3.2%), and nasopharyngitis (4.3% vs. 2.3%) 
Investigations (16.9% TCZ arm vs. 6.9% placebo arm): most commonly, increased ALT 
(13.3% vs. 5.0%, respectively) and increased AST (8.2% vs. 3.7%) 
•  GI  Disorders  (11.9%  TCZ  arm  vs.  10.1%  placebo  arm):  most  commonly,  diarrhoea 
(1.8% vs. 1.4%), dyspepsia (2.1% vs. 0.9%), and nausea (1.4% vs. 0.9%, respectively) 
•  Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (8.7% TCZ arm vs. 12.4% placebo arm): 
most commonly, arthralgia (2.3% vs. 0.5%) and RA (1.1% vs. 1.8%). 
A  greater  percentage  of  patients  experienced  injection  site  reactions  (IRS)  in  the  TCZ  arm 
(7.1%)  than  in  the  placebo  arm  (4.1%).  Similarly,  a  greater  percentage  of  patients  in  the  TCZ 
arm experienced hypersensitivity events (retrieved events occurring during or within 24 hours of 
an  injection  or  infusion  (excluding  ISRs)  and  not  deemed  by  the  investigator  as  unrelated  to 
treatment)  compared  with  patients  in  the  placebo  arm,  4.3%  vs.  3.7%,  respectively. 
Musculoskeletal  and  Connective  Tissue  Disorders  was  the  only  SOC  with  a  notably  higher 
percentage of patients reporting events in the placebo arm (12.4%) compared with the TCZ arm 
(8.7%), most commonly arthralgia. The majority of AEs in both arms (95% each) were Grade 1 
or  2  in  intensity.  The  proportion  of  patients  experiencing  at  least  one  Grade  3  event  was  the 
same in both arms (5.0% each). In the SC arm, 0.9% of patients experience at least one Grade 
4 event, while no patients in placebo had such an event.

Table 48.  Study NA25220 LTE adverse event rates until clinical cut-off (all safety 
population) 
In study NA25220 LTE patients were re-randomised at Week 24. Adverse event data in the TCZ 
PFS  Arm  included  all  patient  data  for  patients  who  received  TCZ  PFS  up  to  Week  24,  data  for 
patients  who  received  TCZ  PFS  up  to  the  time  of  escape  therapy,  and  data  for  patients  who 
continued  to  use  the  PFS  during  the  open  label  treatment  period  up  to  the  date  of  the  clinical 
data  cut.  In  the  TCZ  PFS  Arm  a  total  of  292  patients  experienced  947  AEs.  The  most  common 
SOCs (≥ 10.0%) in which AEs were reported were as follows: 
• 
• 
Infections  and  infestations  (34.1%):  most  commonly  upper  respiratory  tract  infections 
(8.2%), nasopharyngitis (5.3%), urinary tract infection (4.3%), and sinusitis (2.5%).  
Investigations  (16.2%):  most  commonly  increased  ALT  (12.8%)  and  increased  AST 
(8.5%).  
•  GI Disorders (14.2%): most commonly diarrhea (3.0%) and dyspepsia (2.3%) 
•  General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (10.8%): most commonly injection-
site erythema (2.5%), injection site pain (2.5%), and injection site haematoma (0.7%). 
Among  the  168  patients in study  NA25220  LTE  who  switched  from  TCZ  PFS  to  TCZ  AI  at  Week 
24, 74 patients had 201 AEs. Most (51/54) of these AEs were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in intensity and 
resolved  within  7  days,  on  average.  The  most  common  SOCs  (≥  10.0%)  in  which  AEs  were 
reported were as follows: 
• 
Infections  and  infestations  (22.6%):  most  commonly  upper  respiratory  tract  infections 
(4.2%), nasopharyngitis (3.0%), urinary tract infection (2.4%), and sinusitis (2.4%).

• 
Investigations  (11.3%  AI):  most  commonly  increased  ALT  (8.3%,  respectively)  and 
increased AST (4.2%).  
Sixty  one  patients  switched  from  Placebo  to  TCZ  PFS.  Twenty-seven  of  these  patients  had  56 
AEs.  The  most  common  AEs  (SOC)  reported  after  the  switch  from  Placebo  to  TCZ  PFS  was 
infections and infestations (24.6%). The incidence for all other SOCs was ≤ 10.0%. Individual AEs 
(preferred  terms)  reported  in  ≥  5.0%  of  patients  were  ALT  increased  (5  patients;  8.2%),  AST 
increased  (4  patients;  6.6%),  dyslipidemia  (4  patients;  6.6%),  and  upper  respiratory  tract 
infection (4 patients; 6.6%).  
Among the 59 patients who switched from Placebo to TCZ AI, 25 patients had 51 AEs. The most 
common  AEs  (SOC)  in  this  treatment  arm  were  investigations  (11.9%)  and  gastrointestinal 
disorders (10.2%). The incidence for all other SOCs were ALT increased (5 patients; 8.5%), AST 
increased (4 patients; 6.8%), and hypertriglyceridemia (4 patients; 6.8%).   
In  the  Escape  Patients  (study  NA25220  LTE)  the  most  common  AEs  (SOC)  were  infections  and 
infestations (29.2% and 34.4%, respectively]). The next most common AEs were gastrointestinal 
disorders  (16.7%  and  17.8%),  investigations  (11.1%  and  21.1%),  musculoskeletal  and 
connective  tissue  disorders  (12.5%  and  11.1%),  blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders  (8.3% 
and  12.2%),  and  general  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  (12.5%  and  4.4%).  The 
incidence for all other SOCs was ≤ 10.0%. 
In  study  WA22762  the  proportion  of  patients  who  experienced  at  least  one  AE  during  the  24 
weeks was 631 patients (76.2%) in the SC arm vs. 486 of 631 patients (77.0%) in the IV arm.

•  Skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders  (11.6%  SC  arm  vs.  13.0%  IV  arm):  most 
commonly, rash (2.9% vs. 2.7%, respectively), and pruritus (2.4% vs. 1.7%) 
•  General  disorders  and  administration-site  conditions  (14.9%  SC  arm  vs.  7.0%  IV  arm): 
most  commonly,  injection-site  erythema  (4.4%  vs.  0.8%,  respectively),  and  peripheral 
edema (1.7% vs. 1.4%, respectively) 
•  Nervous system disorders (9.4% SC arm vs. 11.6% IV arm): most commonly, headache 
(4.4% vs. 5.2%, respectively) and dizziness (2.1% vs. 2.4%). 
The majority of AEs in both arms (1436 of 1515 events (94.8%) in the SC arm vs. 1387 of 1479 
events  (93.8%)  in  the  IV  arm)  were  Grade  1  or  2  in  intensity.  The  proportion  of  patients 
experiencing  at  least  one  Grade  3  event  was  comparable  for  the  SC  and  IV  arms  (9.4%  vs. 
10.0%, respectively), as was the proportion of patients experiencing at least one Grade 4 event 
(1.0%  vs.0.8%,  respectively).  The  most  common  SOCs  in  which  Grade  ≥  3  AEs  were  reported 
were infections and infestations, with no single event being predominant, and investigations (i.e. 
increased ALT and AST liver enzymes). 
In  study  WA22762  LTE  the  data  based  on  the  safety  population,  this  includes  data  from  the 
double-blind  and open-label  periods  in the  SC  and  IV  arms  but  only  from the open-label  period

35%  of  AEs  in  both  the  SC  and  IV  arms  were  reported  by  the  investigator  as  being  related  to 
treatment; 748 of 2128 events [35.2%] vs. 662 of 1863 events [35.5%], respectively. The most 
common related AEs in both treatment arms were ‘infections and infestations’ and ‘investigations’ 
SOCs (mainly increased liver enzymes).  
In study WA22762 LTE 186 patients switched after the 24 weeks period form IV TCZ to TCZ SC. 
In this IV-SC Switch Arm the rate of AEs was 633.88 (95% CI: 570.93; 701.87) events per 100 
PY.  The  most  common  AEs  (SOC)  were  infections  and  infestations  (50/186  patients  (26.9%)). 
The  next  most  common  AEs  were  musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders  (27/186 
(14.5%)). The incidence for all other SOCs was ≤ 8.0%. Individual AEs (preferred terms) with an 
incidence ≥ 5.0% (≥ 10/186 patients) were nasopharyngitis (14/186 (8%)) and upper respiratory 
tract infection (11/186 (6%)). The proportion of patients with a related AE was 48/186 (25.8%). 
The most common related AEs were infections. 
In the SC-IV Switch Arm the rate of AEs was 300.52 [95% CI: 213.70; 410.82] events per 100

incidence  for  all  other  SOCs  was  ≤  10.0%.  Individual  AEs  (preferred  terms)  with  an  incidence ≥ 
5.0% ( ≥ 3/48 patients) were nasopharyngitis (4/48 (8.3%)) and upper respiratory tract infection 
(3/48  (6.3%)).  A  total  of  9/48  (18.8%)  patients  experienced  an  AE  that  was  reported  by  the 
investigator as being related to treatment.   
Table 51.  Study  WA22762  LTE  summary  of  adverse  events  by  intensity  (safety 
population) 
For study WA22762 LTE the incidence of AEs was  analysed by body weight at baseline. In both 
the SC and IV treatment arms, a higher proportion of heavier patients (≥ 100 kg) experienced at 
least one AE compared with patients in the lighter subgroups. 
Table 52.  Adverse events by body weight at baseline (safety population) 
In  study  NP22623,  73  treatment-emergent  AEs  were  reported  in  22/29  patients  (76%)  during 
the  randomized  SC  treatment  phase.  The  SOC  with  the  highest  frequency  of  AEs  were 
gastrointestinal disorders (most commonly nausea), infections and infestations (most commonly 
upper respiratory tract infection) and musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders SOC (most 
commonly RA).

Two AEs (both injection site erythema) in 2 patients were considered as probably related to trial 
treatment and 19 AEs in 9 patients were considered as possibly related by the investigator. The 
remaining 52 AEs were classified as either remotely related or unrelated. 
In  the  ongoing  supportive  monotherapy  Study  MRA229JP  AEs  were  reported  for  154  patients 
(89.0%) in the SC TCZ group (q2w) and for 157 patients (90.8%) in the IV TCZ group. The most 
common SOCs in which AEs were reported were:  
• 
• 
Investigations:  93  patients  (53.8%)  and  89  patients  (51.4%)  (most  commonly  blood 
cholesterol increased (19.1% vs. 17.9%), low density lipoprotein (LDL] increased (17.3% 
vs.  13.9%),  blood  triglycerides  increased  (0.4%  in  both  groups),  and  ALT  increased 
(10.4% vs. 9.8%) 
Infections  and  infestations:  72  patients  (41.6%)  and  78  patients  (45.1%)  (most 
commonly  nasopharyngitis  (20.8%  vs.  17.9%)  and  upper  respiratory  tract  infection 
(9.2% vs. 7.5%) 
•  Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: 39 patients (22.5%) and 42 patients (24.3%) 
•  Gastrointestinal disorders: 34 patients (19.7%) and 43 patients (24.9%) 
•  General  disorders  and  administration  site  Conditions:  33  patients  (19.1%)  and  13 
patients (7.5%) 
•  Metabolism and nutrition Disorders: 9 patients (5.2%) and 20 patients (11.6%) Nervous 
System Disorders: 18 patients (10.4%) and 5 patients (2.9%). 
Injection  site  reactions  (mostly  injection  site  erythema)  at  the  site  of  subcutaneous 
administration (of active substance or placebo) were more frequent in the SC TCZ group with an 
incidence of 12.1% than in the IV TCZ group (5.2%). 
In the dose escalation study MRA227JP (monotherapy) all of the 32 patients experienced AEs By 
SOC, the most frequently reported AEs included: investigations (with most commonly increased 
blood  triglycerides,  followed  by  low  density  lipoprotein,  and  increased  ALT);  infections  and 
infestations (most commonly nasopharyngitis) and gastrointestinal disorders.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Table 53.  Overview  of  SAEs  at  week  24  in  SC  TCZ  and  IV  TCZ  clinical  studies 
(safety population) 
In study NA25220 the percentage of patients who experienced at least one SAE during the study 
was similar in both arms 4.6% of patients in the TCZ arm vs. 3.7% in the placebo arm. The most 
common  SOC  in  which  SAEs  were  reported  was  infections/infestations  (TCZ  2.1%)  and  placebo 
1.8%.  These  cases  were  all  rated  as  treatment  related.    Three  patients  were  reported  with 
malignancies (one classified as non-serious AE) during the study, all in the TCZ arm. The events 
were  considered  unrelated  by  the  investigator.  One  SAE  of  bleeding  was  reported,  an  event  of 
haemorrhage in the TCZ arm. 
In study WA22762 core the proportion of patients who experienced at least one SAE during the 
study was similar in both arms (4.6% of patients in the SC arm vs. 5.2% in the IV arm), with the 
total number of SAEs higher in the IV arm (33 SC arm vs. 41, IV arm). The most common SOC in 
which SAEs were reported was infections and infestations, which occurred at a similar frequency 
in both arms (1.4% each), with no specific type of event being predominant. Musculoskeletal and 
connective  tissue  disorders  were  the  next  most  commonly  reported  SAEs  (3  patients  in  the  SC 
arm vs. 6 patients in the IV arm), followed by nervous system disorders (2 patients SC arm vs. 6 
patients  IV  arm),  with  higher  numbers  of  SAEs  in  the  IV  arm.  Two  events  of  haemorrhage 
(haemorrhoidal  haemorrhage  and  rectal  haemorrhage  were  reported.  The  two  cases  were  not 
associated with Grade 2 or 3 decreased platelet count. The proportion of SAEs considered by the 
investigator  to  be  related  to  treatment  was  balanced  across  the  two  arms  at  27%  (9  of  33 
events) in the SC arm and 29% (12 of 41 events) in the IV arm. The most frequent treatment-
related SAEs were from the infections and infestations SOC (5 of 33 events in SC arm vs. 7 of 41 
events IV arm).

Table 54.  Overview of SAEs in studies WA22762 and NA25220 until clinical cut-off 
(safety population) 
In  the  supportive  monotherapy  study  MRA229JP  SAEs  were  recorded  for  13  of  173  patients 
(7.5%)  in  the  SC  TCZ  group  and  for  10  of  173  patients  (5.8%)  in  the  IV  TCZ  group.  Events 
classified in the SOC of infections and infestations were reported for 2 patients (1.2%) in the SC 
TCZ group and for 5 patients (2.9%) in the IV TCZ group. The only types of events reported for 
more  than  one  patient  in  a  given  treatment  group  were  2  patients  each  with  herpes  zoster  or 
pneumonia in the IV TCZ group. 
One  SAE  was  reported  in  the  supportive  phase  I/II  study  MRA227JP,  a  causal  relationship 
between TCZ and the pyelonephritis could not be excluded. 
There were no SAEs during the randomized SC treatment phase of the phase Ib study NP22623.

Table 56.  Overview  of  death  in  studies WA22762  and  NA252220  until  clinical  cut-
off (safety population) 
Three deaths were reported in study NA25220 during 24 weeks period in the TCZ arm, two as a 
result  of  a  sepsis  and  one  death  as  result  of  a  lower  respiratory  tract  infection.  One  additional 
death due to angina pectoris was reported in study NA25220 LTE. 
In  study  WA22762  one  death  due  to  sepsis,  secondary  to  bacterial  arthritis  of  the  right  tarsus, 
was reported in the TCZ IV group during the 24 weeks treatment period. Two more deaths were 
reported in in study WA22762 LTE, one in the SC arm and one in the IV arm. The patient in the 
SC arm died of shock (unknown cause) associated with pelvic pain 11 days after her last dose of 
TCZ.  The  investigator  considered  the  death  as  well  as  the  pelvic  pain  and  shock  SAEs  to  be 
related to study treatment. The patient in the IV arm died approximately 6 months after her last 
dose of TCZ due to hyperkalaemia and hypocalcaemia AEs. The investigator considered the death

to be unrelated to study treatment. At the time of the data cut, the cause of death was unknown; 
however, the death has since been attributed to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. 
There  were  no  deaths  in  any  of  the  supporting  studies,  including  the  monotherapy  study

In patients receiving TCZ SC who developed neutralizing anti-TCZ antibodies post-baseline, there 
appeared to be no impact on efficacy. None of these patients withdrew for lack of efficacy or loss 
of  efficacy  (defined  as  achieving  an  ACR50  or  DAS28-EULAR  good  response  prior  to  withdrawal 
for insufficient therapeutic response). 
Of  patients  treated  with  TCZ  SC  who  experienced  a  serious  or  clinically  significant 
hypersensitivity  reaction,  none  were  positive  for  anti-TCZ  antibodies.  Only  one  patient  who 
experienced an ISR had a positive ADA result. 
Adverse events of special interest 
The  types  of  AEs  were  predefined  based  on  findings  from  nonclinical  and  clinical  studies  with 
TCZ,  safety  concerns  for  the  RA  population  (e.g.  cardiovascular  risk,  malignancies),  as  well  as 
the  safety  profile  of  other  monoclonal  antibodies  used  in  RA.  These  AEs  of  special  interest 
(AESIs)  were  defined  using  published  standardized  MedDRA  queries  (SMQs),  SOCs,  high-level 
terms (HLT), or AE group terms (AEGTs) defined by Roche Drug Safety. No new unexpected AEs 
occurred in the SC TCZ clinical studies.

In study NA25220 the rates of infections and serious infections through week 24 were similar in 
the SC TCZ and the placebo arm. Nine patients in the TCZ arm (2.1%) and four patients in the 
placebo arm (1.8%) experienced at least one serious infection. Sepsis and lower respiratory tract 
infection were observed in 2 patients in the TCZ arm, and pneumonia was observed in 2 patients 
in the placebo arm. None of the serious infections was associated with Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. 
One SAE of pulmonary tuberculosis was reported in the SC TCZ arm.  
Three deaths were reported as a result of infections, all in the SC TCZ arm (see above).  
During  the  long  term  follow  up  in  study  NA25220  LTE  the  rates  of  infections  and  serious 
infections in the TCZ PFS Arm up to the clinical cut-off were consistent with the rates at week 24. 
No  additional  serious  infections  were  reported  in  patients  in  the  TCZ  PFS  arm  after  re-
randomization.   
The rate of infections was higher in the patients who switched from TCZ PFS to TCZ AI (142.48 
[95% CI: 106.72, 186.36] per 100 PY) compared to the rate observed in the TCZ PFS Arm up to 
week  24  (96.34  [95%  CI:  82.63,  111.67]).  One  patient  in  the  TCZ  PFS-to-TCZ  AI  arm 
experienced  Grade  4  bacterial  arthritis,  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to  study 
treatment. No additional serious infections were reported. 
The  rate  of  infection  and  infestation  AEs  in  patients  who  switched  from  Placebo-to-TCZ  PFS 
(144.74 per 100 PY) was higher than the rate in patients who switched from placebo to TCZ AI 
(43.63 per 100 PY) or the rate in the placebo arm in the 24-week double-blind treatment period 
(97.41 per 100 PY). 
No events of opportunistic infection were reported in patients treated with TCZ up to the clinical 
cut-off. There were no cases of tuberculosis reported during the LTE at the clinical cut-off. 
The  rate  of  infections  in  Escape  Patients  was  similar  in  the  prior  TCZ  arm  (108.23  [95%  CI: 
75.80, 149.84] per 100 PY) and the prior placebo arm (114.2 [95% CI: 83.30, 152.81] per 100 
PY). The rate of serious infections following escape therapy was 9.02 (95% CI: 1.86, 26.36) per 
100  PY  in  the  prior  TCZ  arm  and  7.61  (95%  CI:  1.57,  22.25)  per  100  PY  in  the  prior  placebo 
arm. Three patients each in the prior TCZ arm (4.2%) and prior placebo arm (3.3%) experienced 
serious infections. One event of new onset pulmonary tuberculosis (an SAE) occurred in a patient 
who was on TCZ Escape treatment, and led to discontinuation of treatment. 
The  rates  for  all  infections  and  serious  infections  observed  in  the  first  24  weeks  of  study 
WA22762 were similar between the SC and IV treatment arms. Of a total of 19 serious infections 
were  reported.  None  of  the  serious  infections  were  associated  with  Grade  3  or  4  neutropenia. 
During  the  long  term  extension  study  WA22762  LTE  again,  the  overall  rates  of  infections  and 
serious  infections  were  similar  between  SC  and  IV  treatment  arms  and  similar  to  the  rates 
observed in the initial 24 weeks of the study.  
There were no cases of tuberculosis reported at the clinical cut-off. 
In the monotherapy study MRA229JP AEs classified under the SOC of infections and infestations 
occurred in 72 patients (41.6%) and 78 patients (45.1%) in the 162 mg SC TCZ q2w and the 8 
mg/kg  IV  TCZ  q4w  groups,  respectively.  Serious  infections  were  experienced  by  2  patients 
(1.2%) and 5 patients (2.9%) in the SC and IV TCZ groups, respectively.  
In  study  MRA2227JP  AEs  classified  under  the  SOC  of  infections  and  infestations  occurred  in  17 
patients (53.1%) in the three treatment groups combined. Although the sample size was small, 
RoActemra 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/606295/2013 
Page 123/157 
 
  
the  incidence  of  Infections  and  Infestations  tended  to  increase  with  dose.  One  infection 
(pyelonephritis in the 81 mg q2w group) was assessed as severe in intensity; this event was also 
reported  as  a  SAE.  A  causal  relationship  to  TCZ  could  not  be  excluded  for  the  event.  All  other 
infections were mild in intensity 
Malignancies 
The  rate  of  malignancies  per  100  PY  of  exposure  was  comparable  between  the  SC  and  IV  all-
exposure. The review of the events did not identify any clear pattern of event types. 
No malignancies were reported in studies MRA229JP or MRA227JP. 
Anaphylaxis 
No events of anaphylaxis related to SC TCZ administration have occurred in the pivotal studies or 
study MRA229JP.  
Two  anaphylactic  reactions  were  reported  in  the  TCZ  IV  arm  in  study  WA22762  LTE.  Both 
anaphylaxis AEs occurred more than 24 hours after TCZ IV infusion.  
In study MRA227JP, one AE of anaphylactoid reaction was reported in 1 of 12 patients (8.3%) in 
the 162 mg q2w group in Period III.

Table 68.  Number  and  percentage  of  patients  with  neutropenia  (worst  neutrophil 
value from baseline normal value), by observed week 24 Cthrough Quartiles (PK-
ITT population) 
Neutropenia  (including  “decreased  neutrophil  count”)  was  reported  as  an  AE  for  5%  patients  in 
the TCZ arm. One patient was withdrawn because of the event. For an additional 8 patients (2%) 
of the 437 patients in the TCZ arm, the neutropenia led to dose modification or interruption. Of 
the 16 patients with NCI CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 non-serious neutropenia, 2 patients in the TCZ arm 
experienced a non-serious infection with onset after the episode neutropenia. 
Platelet count 
In  the  TCZ  arm,  mean  and  median  platelet  counts decreased  within  the  normal  range  after the 
first study drug dose and remained lower for the remainder of the 24-week treatment period 
Markedly low platelet counts (< 100 × 109/L and a ≥ 30% change from baseline) were reported 
in less than 1% of TCZ treated patients. In one patient this resulted in a dose modification. 
During  the  long  term  extension  in  study  NA25220  LTE  the  results  on  platelet  counts  were 
consistent with the week 24 data.

TCZ groups. In both groups, Grade 3 or 4 decreases in neutrophil count occurred in 5 patients. 
Among these patients, non-serious infections were  recorded for 2 patients in the SC  TCZ group 
and 3 patients in the IV TCZ group; all infections were mild. 
In  study  MRA227JP,  mean  neutrophil  count  decreased  by  Week  35,  in  each  of  the  three 
treatment groups. A reduction in neutrophil count of two or more grades occurred in 1 patient in 
the 81 mg q2w and in 3 patients in the 162 mg q2w group. Among these patients, non-serious 
infections of pharyngitis and nasopharyngitis (all mild) and one event of pyelonephritis (severe) 
were recorded. 
Platelet count 
Table 72.  Incidence  of  thrombocytopenia  by  CTC  Grade  at  week  24  (safety 
population) 
The  data  in  the  long  term  extension  in  study  NA25220  LTE  and  study  WA22762  LTE  were 
consistent with the 24 weeks data. In study WA22762 LTE one new Grade 3  decreased platelet 
count  was  observed  in  the  IV-SC  Switch  Arm.  All  other  newly  observed  cases  in  both  studies 
were Grade 1 or 2. 
No association between decreases in platelet counts and serious bleeding events were reported. 
There was no relationship between body weight and the incidence of thrombocytopenia 
In study MRA229JP, mean platelet counts decreased by approximately 25% from baseline values 
after  4  weeks,  and  these  levels  were  sustained  through  24  weeks.  Decreases  in  platelet  count 
were similar between the SC TCZ and IV TCZ groups. There were no Grade 3 or 4 decreases in 
platelet  count  in  either  treatment  group.  No  serious  bleeding  events  were  associated  with 
decreased platelet count. 
In study MRA227JP, mean platelet count decreased by Week 35; the reduction in platelet count 
occurred  in  each  of  the  three  treatment  groups.    A  reduction  in  platelet  count  of  two  or  more 
grades occurred in 1 patient in the 162 mg q2w group. 
Liver enzymes 
The  liver  profile  consisted  of  AST,  ALT,  total  bilirubin,  and  alkaline  phosphatase.  Direct  and 
indirect bilirubin levels were tested only if total bilirubin was greater than the ULN.

Table 73.  Study  NA25220  shifts  in  ALT  and  AST  from  normal  at  baseline  to  worst 
post-baseline value above the ULN (safety population) 
In escape patients a similar proportion of patients in the prior TCZ and placebo arms experienced 
markedly  high  AST  levels  following  escape  therapy.  The  incidence  of  markedly  high  ALT  levels 
was  higher  in  the  prior  placebo  arm  as  compared  to  the  prior  TCZ  arm  (8/90  (9%)  vs  3/72 
(4%)). None of the elevations in transaminases were associated with simultaneous elevations in 
total  bilirubin  of  >2  ULN.  Following  the  initiation  of  escape  therapy,  the  incidence  of  AEs 
associated  with  elevated  ALT  and  AST  was  higher  in  the  patients  who  previously  received 
placebo. 
In  study  NA25220  no  notable  differences  in  total  bilirubin  or  alkaline  phosphatase  levels  were 
observed between the TCZ and placebo treatment arms. A greater percentage of patients within 
the 60 to < 100 kg body weight category in both treatment arms showed an increase in ALT or

AST as compared with the < 60 kg and ≥ 100 kg categories. There were no patients who met the 
laboratory criteria for Hy’s law, i.e. no patients in this study were identified as having a > 3 × the 
ULN elevation in AST or ALT and 2 × ULN in total bilirubin. 
During the long term extension in study NA25220 LTE the results the results were consistent with 
the 24 weeks data. 
Table 74.  Study WA 22762 shifts in ALT and AST from normal at baseline to worst 
post-baseline value above the ULN (ITT population)  
The majority of elevations in both arms occurred at a single time point only: 19 patients (3.6%) 
in  the  SC  arm  and  15  patients  (4.0%)  in  the  IV  arm.  Non-consecutive  elevations  were 
experienced by 8 (1.5%) and 6 patients (1.6%) in the SC and IV arms, respectively. One patient 
in the SC arm experienced a sustained consecutive elevation (i.e. from time of first elevation to 
the  last  record).  Among  patients  with  an  increased  ALT  and/or  AST  level,  the  majority 
experienced a Grade 1 elevation at worst; Grade 1 elevations were reported for a slightly higher 
proportion of patients in the SC arm compared with the IV arm for ALT (48% vs. 42%), whereas 
no  notable  difference  between  arms  was  seen  for  AST  (38%  vs.  37%).  No  notable  differences 
between arms were observed for Grade 2, 3, or 4 elevations. Grade 3 or 4 elevations in ALT and 
AST occurred in ~1% of patients.

Increased  ALT  and  increased  AST  were  reported  as  AEs  for  9  (4.8%)  and  7  (3.8%)  patients  in 
the  IV-SC  arm,  respectively.  One  patient  was  withdrawn  due  to  increased  ALT  and  AST  AEs. 
There were no hepatic AEs in the IV-SC Switch Arm.   
Table 75.  Study WA22762 patients with an increase in AST and Alt from < 3x ULN 
at baseline to worst value > 3x ULN by weight at baseline (ITT population) 
In  both  treatment  arms  of  Study  WA22762  mean  and  median  total  bilirubin  levels  increased 
within the normal range following initiation of TCZ treatment and remained stable at the higher 
levels  for  the  duration  of treatment.  No  notable  differences  were observed  between  the  SC  and 
IV  treatment  arms.  Markedly  high  bilirubin  levels  (>2  ×  ULN)  were  rare,  occurring  in  2%  of 
patients  in  each  treatment  arm,  and  were  all  elevations  of  indirect  bilirubin.  There  were  no 
occurrences  of  markedly  high  direct  bilirubin.  The  results  in  the  long  term  extension  study 
WA22762 LTE were consistent with the week 24 data.  
In  study  MRA229JP,  the  time  courses  of  ALT,  AST  and  ALP  levels  were  similar  in  the  two 
treatment  groups.  Grade  3  or  4  increases  were  recorded  in  the  SC  TCZ  and  IV  TCZ  groups  for 
ALT (1 and 3 subjects, respectively) and AST (1 and 0 patients, respectively). One patient in the 
IV TCZ group experienced a SAE of hepatic function abnormal. 
In study MRA227JP, some fluctuation was noted in the mean values of the liver function-related 
test  variables,  but  mean  values  remained  within  the  normal  range  for  all  the  liver  function 
parameters. For ALT, the CTC Grade worsened by at least two grades for 1 patient in each of the 
81  mg  q2w  and  162  mg  q2w  groups,  and  for  2  patients  in the  162  mg  qw  group.  For  AST,  the 
CTC  Grade  worsened  by  at  least  two  grades  for  two  patients  in  the  162  mg  qw  group.  Two 
patients experienced an AE of hepatic function abnormal.

Lipid parameters 
Changes  in  each  lipid  profile  (total  cholesterol,  low-density  lipoprotein  (LDL)  cholesterol,  high-
density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol, and triglycerides) at Week 24 were similar for TCZ SC and 
TCZ IV in both frequency and grade across SC (qw and q2w) and TCZ IV populations.  
At Week 24, the proportion of patients who experienced a sustained elevation in total cholesterol 
of  ≥6.2  mmol/L  (240  mg/dL),  or  in  LDL of  ≥4.1  mmol/L  (160  mg/dL),  was  comparable  between 
both TCZ SC dosing regimens (qw and q2w) and TCZ IV populations. 
Following  an  initial  increase  after  the  first  administration  of  TCZ  SC,  the  mean  values  for  lipid 
profile parameters remained stable throughout the remainder of the studies. There was no trend 
for  an  increased  risk  of  cholesterol  increases  over  time,  which  is  a  known  risk  in  patients 
receiving  TCZ  IV.  Changes  in  the  lipid  profiles  for  the  SC  and  IV  all-exposure  populations  were 
comparable. 
Safety in special populations 
Bodyweight  
Table 76.  Pivotal  studies:  Key  Safety  Parameters  by  body  weight  category  (24 
weeks data) 
In the long-term extension phases of study NA25520 and study WA22672, subgroup analyses of 
selected AE parameters by body weight category at baseline (< 60 kg, 60 to < 100 kg, and ≥100 
kg) indicated a trend for higher incidences of all AEs and SAEs among patients weighing ≥ 100 kg 
at baseline compared with patients weighing < 100 kg.

In subgroup analyses of laboratory parameters, the incidence of newly occurring Grade 1 and 2 
neutropenia showed a trend for increase with decreasing body weight. However, this effect was 
not observed with Grade 3 or 4 events.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events

clinical studies (safety population) 
Table 78.  Overview of AEs leading to withdrawal in pooled SC TCZ and IV TCZ (all 
exposure population) 
During the 24 weeks treatment period in study NA252209 most common reasons for treatment 
discontinuation were attributed to infections and infestations (individual events in each arm, with 
the exception of two cases of lower respiratory tract infection in the TCZ arm) and investigations 
SOCs  (individual  events  of  elevated  ALT  and  increased  body  weight).  Other  SOCs  included  1 
patient  withdrawal  each  because  of  blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders  (neutropenia); 
hepatobiliary  disorders  (hepatic  steatosis);  neoplasms  benign,  malignant  and  unspecified 
(including  Cysts  and  Polyps;  adenocarcinoma  pancreas);  and  respiratory,  thoracic  and 
mediastinal disorders (pulmonary fibrosis).

In study WA22762 the most common reasons for treatment discontinuation during the 24 weeks 
period were infections and infestations (individual events in each arm, with the exception of two 
cases  of  bacterial  arthritis  in  the  IV  arm)  and  investigations  SOCs  (due  to  elevated  liver 
enzymes).  Other  SOCs  occurring  at  an  incidence  of  1%  in  either  arm  were  immune  system 
disorders  (hypersensitivity  reactions)  and  skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders  (including 
urticaria,  rash,  and  erythema).  Two  patients  in  the  SOC  respiratory,  thoracic,  and  mediastinal 
disorders with interstitial lung disease and pulmonary fibrosis had pre-existing conditions. 
In the randomized SC treatment phase of study NP22623, no patients withdrew due to an AE.  
In study MRA229JP AEs leading to withdrawal of the investigational product were recorded for 3 
patients  (1.7%)  in  the  SC  TCZ  group  and  9  patients  (5.2%)  in  the  IV  TCZ  group.  The  events 
include  subileus  and  hyponatraemia  in  the  TCZ  SC  group  and  herpes  zoster,  hepatic  function 
abnormal, colitis ischemic, large intestine perforation, spinal column stenosis, Meniere’s disease, 
spinal compression fracture and anaphylactic reaction in the TCZ IV group. 
On  patient  withdrew  from  study  MRA227JP  due  to  decreases  in  neutrophils  and  in  white  blood 
cells (two events). A causal relationship to TCZ could not be excluded for either event. 
Table 79. 
Overview of AEs leading to dose modifications at week 24 in the 
SC TCZ and IV TCZ clinical studies (safety population) 
In  the  SC  all-exposure  population,  the  most  common  events  leading  to  dose  modification  were 
reported  in  the  investigations  (mainly  elevation  in  hepatic  transaminase)  and  Blood  and 
lymphatic  system  (neutropenia,  leucopaenia  and  thrombocytopaenia)  SOCs.  In  the  IV  all-
exposure population, the most common AEs leading to dose modifications were in the Infections 
(most  commonly  URTI,  bronchitis,  nasopharyngitis,  and  sinusitis)  and  Investigations  SOCs 
(mainly elevation in hepatic transaminase). 
In  the  randomized  SC  treatment  phase  of  study  NP22623,  3  patients,  all  in  the  q2w  group, 
experienced AEs (tracheitis, bronchitis, and diarrhea, respectively) that led to dose modification. 
AEs leading to modification of the dosing interval or temporary suspension of treatment occurred 
in 25 patients (14.5%) in the SC TCZ group and in 22 patients (12.7%) in the IV TCZ group of 
Study MRA229JP.  There were no events with a marked difference in incidence between the two 
groups.

AEs  resulting  in  modification  of  the  dosing  interval  occurred  in  5  patients  (15.6%)  in  study 
MRA227JP. By treatment group, the incidence was 1 patient (12.5%) in the 81 mg q2w group, 1 
patient (8.3%) in the 162 mg q2w group and 3 patients (25.0%) in the 162 mg qw group. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  safety  assessment  of  TCZ  SC  is  based  on  the  two  pivotal  phase  III  clinical  studies  (studies 
NA25220 and WA22762). This database is further supported by the data from the safety analysis 
analyses  on  SC  TCZ  from  a  completed  Phase  Ib  study  NP22623  in  RA  patients  and  two  Chugai 
monotherapy trials, the complete Phase I/II study MRA227JP, and the Phase III study MRA229JP. 
Safety  data  from  the  original  Phase  III  clinical  development  program  for  the  intravenous  (IV) 
dosage form of TCZ in adult RA following 24 weeks of treatment (data submitted as part of initial 
MAA) are also summarised. 
In  the  pivotal  studies  a  total  of  1465  patients  were  exposed  to  TCZ  SC.  This  includes  patients 
treated  with  TCZ  SC  during  the  24  weeks  core  and  the  LTE  part  of  study  NA25220  and  study 
WA25220  as  well  as  patients  who  switched  from  placebo  to  TSZ  SC  in  the  LTE  part  of  study 
NA25220 and who switched from TCZ IV to TCZ SC in study WA25220 LTE. So far 1095 of these 
patients completed 24 weeks of treatment, 483 patients completed 40 weeks of treatment, and 
239 patients have completed 48 weeks of treatment with TCZ SC. This gives a robust database 
to  assess  the  safety  TCZ  SC.  However  the  data  on  the  long  term  safety  of  TCZ  SC  are  limited, 
the submission of the final clinical study report for study NA25220 and study WA22762 has been 
included as milestone in the RMP. 
The design of the pivotal study WA22762 further allows a head to head comparison of the safety 
of  the  requested  dosage  scheme  for  TCZ  SC  and  the  authorised  TCZ  IV  scheme.  In  both 
treatment  groups  patients  had  comparable  exposure  to  the  respective  treatment.  Further,  in  a 
smaller  population,  the  preliminary  data  on  the  safety  of  the  switch  IV-SC  and  vice  versa  were 
provided.  Nevertheless  the  patient  population  who  switched  from  IV  to  SC  or  vice  versa  is  still 
small. The safety in “switchers” directly after the switch needs to be further evaluated, especially 
with  regard  to  hypersensitivity.  Long-term  safety  in  patients  in  the  switcher  patient  population 
will  be  further  investigated  in  the  BSRBR  registry  as  detailed  in  the  RMP.  A  statement  has  also 
been included in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
In the pivotal studies the overall AE rate until clinical cut-off was comparable in the SC TCZ and 
TCZ IV groups, and the AE profile of TCZ SC was consistent with the established safety profile of 
IV TCZ profile with exception of the higher of injection site reaction in the TCZ arm. However the 
AE rate in Study WA22762 was higher in both groups, TCZ SC and TCZ IV, than in the historical 
control.  
The  MAH  attributed  the  higher  overall  adverse  events  rates  in  study  WA22762  compared  to 
historical  control  to  partly  design  issues  e.g.  open  design  and  thus  the  knowledge  of  treatment 
might have introduced a bias as well as increased interaction between patient and study site due 
to  weekly  study  drug  applications.  The  second  argument  presented  by  the  MAH  during  the 
evaluation  was  not  considered  acceptable by  the  CHMP  since  self-administration  of  TCZ  SC  was 
foreseen if feasible. 
The main difference between reported AEs in WA22762 and the historical TCZ IV studies was in 
the Investigation SOC i.e. ALT increase. Of note, the 24-week analyses of laboratory parameters 
RoActemra 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/606295/2013 
Page 139/157 
 
  
from study WA22672 showed that the shifts in ALT (and similarly AST) were comparable between 
TCZ  SC  and  TCZ  IV  treatment  arms  in  study  WA22762  and  the  TCZ  IV  historical  studies.  This 
was considered reassuring by the CHMP.  
Another contributing factor to the numerically higher frequency of AEs in study WA22762 versus 
historical  control  may  be  due  to  AEs  in  the  SOC  General  Disorders  and  Administration  Site 
Conditions. A higher incidence of these AEs can be expected due to the SC application.  
Beyond  week  24,  at  the  time  of  the  clinical  cut-off  of  16  January  2012,  the  types  and  overall 
pattern  of  AEs  occurring  after  SC  TCZ  treatment  were  similar  to  those  for  IV  TCZ  treatment 
(except for injection site reactions [ISRs]), with no new safety signals identified. 
The overall AE rate was higher in the SC TCZ arm of study WA22762 (qw dosing) than in the SC 
TCZ  arm  of  study  NA25220  (q2w  dosing).  This  might  be  due  the  higher exposure.  Of  note,  the 
AE rate in the TCZ SC group in study WA22762 was comparable to the rate in TCZ IV patients. 
However, comparing all-exposure TCZ SC and all-exposure TCZ IV data a higher incidence of AEs 
in the TCZ SC patients is observed. 
A significant higher AE rate (633.88 (95% CI: 570.93; 701.87) events per 100 PY) was observed 
in  the  IV-SC  Switch  Arm  as  compared  to  the  SC-IV  Switch  Arm  (300.52  [95%  CI:  213.70; 
410.82]  events  per  100  PY).  The  sample  size  however,  is  still  small,  thus  to  data  a  robust 
conclusion cannot on the clinical significance cannot be drawn.  
However, comparing all-exposure TCZ SC and all-exposure TCZ IV data a higher incidence of AEs 
in the TCZ SC patients is observed.  
The  most  common  body  system  and  organ  classes in  which  AEs  were  reported  were:  infections 
and infestations, gastrointestinal disorders and investigations.  
The rate of AEs decreases with prolonged treatment duration for both the SC TCZ and the IV TCZ 
all-exposure populations, however the number of patients completing beyond 36 weeks TCZ SC 
treatment  is  still  low.  The  submission  of  the  final  clinical  study  report  for  study  NA25220  and 
study WA22762 has been included as milestone in the RMP. 
According to the study protocol the patients received concomitant DMARDs. However the choice 
of  the  medication  was  left  to  the  investigator.  It  is  understood  that  the  majority  of  patients 
received MTX. The MAH was requested during the evaluation to provide an analysis of the safety 
results regarding concomitant use of DMARDs. The  MAH provided post hoc analyses from study 
NA25220  and  from  study  WA22672  comparing  safety  data  of  patients  taking  TCZ  with  MTX 
against the overall study population. The safety profile was consistent among patients receiving 
TCZ with background MTX and the overall study population. 
Following 24 weeks of treatment, the incidence of SAEs and the rates of SAEs per 100 PY were 
very similar between SC TCZ and IV TCZ as well as between the different dose groups (162 mg 
SC TCZ qw or q2w, IV TCZ doses of 4 or 8 mg/kg q4w) in the pivotal studies and the historical 
controls. 
The  most  common  SOC  in  which  SAEs  were  reported  was  infections  and  infestations.  In  both 
pivotal studies, SAEs in this SOC occurred at similar frequencies in both the SC TCZ and control 
arms  and  within  the  Week  24  analysis  and  in  the  long-term  extension,  with  no  specific  type  of 
event being predominant. However the long term SC exposure is still low, the submission of the 
RoActemra 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/606295/2013 
Page 140/157 
 
  
final  clinical  study  report  for  study  NA25220  and  study  WA22762  has  been  included  as  a 
milestone in the RMP.  
The death rate per 100 PY in the SC TCZ pooled population was 0.56 (95% CI: 0.18, 1.31). This 
death rate is comparable with the rate observed in the historical IV TCZ all-exposure population 
of 0.58 (95% CI: 0.41, 0.71).  
No patients died during the course of the study MRA227JP, study MRA229JP and study NP22623.  
Consistent  with  TCZ  IV,  SC  administration  of  TCZ  induced  a  dose  dependent  decrease  in 
neutrophil  counts,  with  the  most  notable  change  being  observed  within  the  first  4  weeks  of 
treatment.  
Infections,  malignancies,  anaphylaxis,  hypersensitivity,  ISRs,  serious  myocardial  infarction 
events, and serious haemorrhagic and ischemic stroke, were defined as adverse events of special 
interest. Most of the events occurred with comparable rates in the TCZ SC and TCZ IV group with 
a  few  exceptions.  The  rate  of  infections  was  higher  under  TCZ  SC  treatment;  however  the  rate 
for  serious  infections  was  comparable.  Although  the  rate  of  hypersensitivity  reactions  was  low, 
the  rate  of  serious  clinically  significant  reactions  was  higher  in  the  TCZ  SC  group.  However  no 
anaphylactic relations occurred under TCZ SC treatment. As expected the in the TCZ SC groups a 
high rate of injection site reactions were reported. 
In both pivotal studies analysis of the key safety parameters by body weight revealed no obvious 
differences  between  the  treatment  arms  in  the  two  lower  weight  categories,  however  a 
numerically higher rate of AEs and infections is patients with higher bodyweight of (≥100kg) was 
observed in the TCZ SC and IV arms of WA22762 study as well as the historical TCZ IV treatment 
arm.  
Analysis of the baseline and disease characteristics indicated that a higher proportion of patients 
in the high body weight category have been found to have a history of previous TNF failures, as 
well as baseline COPD and diabetes contributing to poorer healthy status than in the other weight 
groups.  The  CHMP  concluded  that  there  is  no  established  exposure-safety  relationship  between 
high body weight patients and the occurrence of AEs and SAEs.  
Considering  the  above  the  analysis  suggests  that  the  numerically  higher  incidence  of  AEs  and 
infections  is  patients  with  higher  bodyweight  are  triggered  rather  by  comorbidity  than  by  TCZ 
exposure.   
The overall AE rate was higher in the SC TCZ arm of study WA22762 (qw dosing) than in the SC 
TCZ arm of study NA25220 (q2w dosing) suggesting an exposure related rate of AEs. The MAH 
was requested during the evaluation to present the AE rates by Cthrough  Quartiles. There was no 
association between TCZ exposure and AE rates looking at AE rates by Cthrough Quartiles.  
Further  events  were  defined  as  events  of  special  interest  such  as  gastrointestinal  perforation, 
demyelinating  disorders,  serious  hepatic  events,  serious  haemorrhagic  cerebrovascular  events, 
serious  ischaemic  cerebrovascular  events,  and  serious  bleeding  that  either  did  not  occur  or 
occurred at a low frequency with TCZ SC. 
On 20 December 2013, the MAH reported a needle clogging issue affecting the new pre-filled 
syringe presentation (see section 2.2.3 Finished Medicinal Product). To further strengthen the 
mitigation statements already included in the SmPC and PL, the MAH proposed to add some 
further changes to sections 6.3 and 6.6 of the SmPC and sections 5 and 6 of the PL. The CHMP 
RoActemra 
Assessment report

Page 141/157 
 
  
considered the proposed changes suitable to reduce the probability of a clogged syringe due to 
handling errors. The MAH in addition discussed what happens if a patient uses a pre-filled syringe 
with such an injection force defect. It was clarified that if a patient attempt to administer an 
injection with a pre-filled syringe that is clogged, the patient would unlikely be able to expel any 
drug product from the syringe. The failure mode is considered highly detectable. Assuming a 
replacement pre-filled syringe is at hand, the dose would not be missed. If no replacement pre-
filled syringe is available, the dose would be delayed or missed. Results from studies WA22762 
and NA25220 indicate that if a patient on the TCZ QW regimen has a single dose missed or 
delayed or a partial dose of TCZ SC safety would not be affected. The probability of receiving a 
partial dose from a clogged needle is extremely low as a needle clog is more likely to completely 
block the needle so no injection can be given. The CHMP concluded that there is no impact on 
clinical safety due to clogging incidents when using the pre-filled syringe.  
With regards to the exceeded limit of the injection time with the pre-filled pen reported by the 
MAH on 31/01/2014, the MAH withdrew this new presentation on 11 February 2014. The MAH 
also confirmed their ability to ensure commercial supply of the pre-filled syringe to all 
rheumatoid arthritis patients once approved and to subjects enrolled in on-going clinical studies. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of TCZ SC is comparable with the safety profile of the TCZ IV preparation. No 
new safety signals were identified.  
Comparing  the  two  TCZ  SC  dosage  schemes,  SC  TCZ  q2w  and  SC  TCZ  qw,  the  two  weekly 
scheme has a slightly favourable safety profile with regard to adverse events, however the rates 
of adverse events for the SC TCZ qw scheme are still comparable with the rates for the IV TCZ 
scheme. No such differences were seen with regard to SAEs. 
The  data  on  the  long  term  safety  of  TCZ  SC  are  limited  since  only  a  small  patient  number 
continued treatment beyond week 36. The submission of the final clinical study report for study 
NA25220 and study WA22762 has therefore been included as milestone in the RMP. 
The  data  suggest  that  for  patients  switching  from  TCZ  IV  to  TCZ  SC,  subcutaneous 
administration is safe and well-tolerated with the pattern of AEs observed being consistent with 
the known safety profile of TCZ. However, as the patient population who switched from IV to SC 
or vice versa is still small, the safety in “switchers” directly after the switch needs to be further 
evaluated,  especially  with  regard  to  hypersensitivity.  IgE  data  following  TCZ  SC  treatment  and 
long-term safety in patients in the switcher patient population will be further investigated in the 
final CSR for studies NA25220 and WA22762, and in the BSRBR registry respectively as detailed 
in the RMP. 
Following reports of clogging of the needle with the new pre-filled syringe presentation, the MAH 
proposed  changes to the product information  in  sections  6.3  and  6.6  of the  SmPC as  well  as in 
the Package Leaflet. This is supported by CHMP. The CHMP concluded that there is no impact on 
clinical safety due to clogging incidents when using the pre-filled syringe device. With regards to 
the  exceeded  limit  of  the  injection  time  with  the  pre-filled  pen,  the  MAH  withdrew  this  new 
presentation.

Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils 
the legislative requirements. 
2.8.  Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
PRAC Advice 
Based  on  the  PRAC  review  of  the  Risk  Management  Plan  version  14.2,  the  PRAC  considers  by 
consensus  that  the  risk  management  system  for  tocilizumab  (RoActemra)  in  the  proposed 
indication: 
RoActemra, in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is indicated for the treatment of moderate 
to  severe  active  rheumatoid  arthritis  (RA)  in  adult  patients  who  have  either  responded 
inadequately to, or who were intolerant to, previous therapy with one or more disease-modifying 
anti-rheumatic  drugs  (DMARDs)  or  tumour  necrosis  factor  (TNF)  antagonists.  In  these  patients, 
RoActemra  can  be  given  as  monotherapy  in  case  of  intolerance  to  MTX  or  where  continued 
treatment with MTX is inappropriate.   
RoActemra has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-
ray and to improve physical function when given in combination with methotrexate. 
could  be  acceptable  provided  an  updated  risk  management  plan  and  satisfactory  responses  to 
the questions detailed in this section are submitted. 
This advice is based on the following content of the Risk Management Plan:

patients developed positive anti-tocilizumab 
antibodies with one of these patients having a 
hypersensitivity reaction leading to withdrawal. The 
incidence of anti-tocilizumab antibody formation 
might be underestimated because of interference of 
tocilizumab with the assay and higher drug 
concentration observed in children compared to 
adults.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
TCZ  IV  in  combination  with  methotrexate  (MTX)  is  an  established  treatment  option  for  adult 
patients with RA. In study WA22762 the non-inferiority of TCZ 162mg SC qw to TCZ 8mg/kg IV 
q4w  in  terms  of  efficacy  was  demonstrated.  The  primary  objective  demonstrating  the  non-
inferiority of TCZ SC qw over TCZ IV q4w with regard to ACR 20 response rate at week 24 was 
met  (study  NA25220).  These  results  are  supported  by  the  secondary  objectives,  comparable 
response rates were observed for e.g. ACR 50/ 70 response.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The  clinical  cut-off  date  of  for  the  extension  phase  study  WA22762  LTE  allowing  for  a  switch 
between  IV  and  SC  application  was  16  January  2012.  The  efficacy  of  TCZ  162  mg  SC  qw  was 
maintained after the 24-week double-blind period of the study. However the ACR response rate 
in the SC-IV switch arm was lower than in the other arms, at various time points, including week 
24.  Since  the  sample  size  is  limited,  no  robust  conclusion  could  be  drawn.  Long-term  safety  in 
patients  in  the  switcher  patient  population  will  be  further  investigated  in  the  BSRBR  registry as 
detailed in the RMP. 
Notable  difference  in  response  was  seen  in  the  analysis  by  bodyweight.  ACR  20,  50  and  70 
response  rates  indicated  a  comparable  response  rate  in  the  TCZ  SC  treatment  group  for  all  3 
parameters in the < 60 kg and in the 60 to < 100kg, whereas patients in the > 100 kg showed 
lower  response  rate  for  these  parameters.  Interestingly,  for  ACR  50  and  70  response  in  the 
highest body weight group was lower for the weight adjusted IV TCZ treatment than for the fixed 
SC TCZ dose.  A statement has been included in section 5.1 of the SmPC regarding the impact of 
switching from IV to SC on exposure particularly in light and heavy body weight patients. 
On  20  December  2013,  the  MAH  reported  a  needle  clogging  issue  affecting  the  new  pre-filled 
syringe  presentation  (see  section  2.2.3  Finished  Medicinal  Product).  To  further  strengthen  the 
mitigation  statements  already  included  in  the  SmPC  and  PL,  the  MAH  proposed  changes  to  the 
product  information  in  sections  6.3  and  6.6  of  the  SmPC  as  well  as  in  the  Package  Leaflet  in 
sections 5 and 6 (Instructions for Use Steps 2 and 5). This is supported by CHMP. 
Overall  it  was  concluded  that  the  data  indicate  that  clogging  incidents,  including  clogging 
incidents prior to cap removal, are very rare events. Furthermore, the risk assessment provided 
by  the  MAH  indicated  that  if  in  the  very  rare  event  a  patient  were  to  attempt  to  perform  an 
injection  using  a  pre-filled  syringe  or  pre-filled  pen  with  a  clogged  needle,  it  is highly 
unlikely there would be any impact on clinical efficacy or safety. 
The  CHMP  concluded  that  there  is  no  impact  on  clinical  efficacy  due  to  clogging  incidents  when 
using the pre-filled syringe device. 
With  regards  to  the  exceeded  limit  of  the  injection  time  with  the  pre-filled  pen  reported  by  the 
MAH  on  31/01/2014,  the  MAH  withdrew  this  new  presentation  on  11  February  2014.  The  MAH 
also  confirmed  their  ability  to  ensure  commercial  supply  of  the  pre-filled  syringe  to  all 
rheumatoid arthritis patients once approved and to subjects enrolled in on-going clinical studies.

Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The unfavourable effects of TCZ are established and include infection, gastro-intestinal disorders, 
infusion  reactions,  skin  disorders,  neutropenia,  elevation  in  hepatic  enzymes  and  lipid 
parameters. 
No  new  safety  signals  were  identified  with  the  new  route  of  administration.  The  AE  profiles  of 
TCZ  162  mg  SC  qw  and  q2w  are  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  of TCZ  IV  with  a  few 
exceptions.  
The  rate  of  infections  was  higher  under  TCZ  SC  treatment;  however  the  rate  for  serious 
infections  was  comparable.  Although  the  rate  of  hypersensitivity  reactions  was  low,  the  rate  of 
serious clinically significant reactions was higher in the TCZ SC group; however no anaphylactic 
relations occurred under TCZ SC treatment. As expected high rate of injection site reactions were 
reported in the TCZ SC groups. A numerically higher incidence of Grade 1 and 2 neutropenia (not 
Grade  3  or  4)  and  ALT  elevations  to  below  3×  ULN  were  found  with  the  TCZ  SC  162  mg  qw 
dosing  regimen  compared  with  the  TCZ  SC  162  mg  q2w  regimen.  However,  the  rates  of  these 
laboratory abnormalities with the qw regimen were comparable to those seen in the pooled TCZ 
8 mg/kg IV pivotal data (as well as the 8 mg/kg IV arm of study WA22762).  
Injection site reactions (ISRs) were only described in the TCZ SC groups. The incidence of ISRs 
was also comparable between the TCZ SC qw (10.1%) and q2w (7.1%) regimens and within the 
range reported for other biologics.  
Further  events  characterising  the  safety  profile  of  TCZ  e.g.  gastrointestinal  perforation, 
demyelinating  disorders,  serious  hepatic  events,  serious  haemorrhagic  cerebrovascular  events, 
serious  ischaemic  cerebrovascular  events,  and  serious  bleeding  that  either  did  not  occur  or 
occurred at a low frequency with TCZ SC. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The long term safety of TCZ SC is limited. Especially safety regarding potential or identified risks 
such  as  gastrointestinal  perforation,  demyelinating  disorders,  serious  hepatic  events,  serious 
haemorrhagic  cerebrovascular  events,  serious  ischaemic  cerebrovascular  events,  and  serious 
bleeding should be further established (as mentioned in the RMP). 
The  data  suggest  that  for  patients  switching  from  TCZ  IV  to  TCZ  SC,  subcutaneous 
administration is safe and well-tolerated with the pattern of AEs observed being consistent with 
the known safety profile of TCZ. However the patient population who switched from IV to SC or 
vice  versa  is  still  small,  the  safety  in  “switchers”  directly  after  the  switch  needs  to  be  further 
evaluated, especially with regard to hypersensitivity. Long-term safety in patients in the switcher 
patient  population  will  be  further  investigated  in  the  BSRBR  registry  as  detailed  in  the  RMP.  A 
statement has also been included in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
A  numerically  higher  rate  of  AEs  and  infections  is  patients  with  higher  bodyweight  of  (≥100kg) 
was  observed  in  the  TCZ  SC  and  IV  arms  of  WA22762  study  as  well  as  the  historical  TCZ  IV

treatment arm. Higher rates for AEs and infections were observed in heavier patients (≥ 100 kg), 
consistent  for  TCZ  SC  and  TCZ  IV,  however,  the  number  of  patients  in  the  highest  weight 
category was small.  
On  20  December  2013,  the  MAH  reported  a  needle  clogging  issue  affecting  the  new  pre-filled 
syringe  presentation  (see  section  2.2.3  Finished  Medicinal  Product).  To  further  strengthen  the 
mitigation  statements  already  included  in  the  SmPC  and  PL,  the  MAH  proposed  changes  to  the 
product  information  in  sections  6.3  and  6.6  of  the  SmPC  as  well  as  in  the  Package  Leaflet  in 
sections 5 and 6 (Instructions for Use Steps 2 and 5). This is supported by CHMP. 
Overall  it  was  concluded  that  the  data  indicate  that  clogging  incidents,  including  clogging 
incidents prior to cap removal, are very rare events. Furthermore, the risk assessment provided 
by  the  MAH  indicated  that  if  in  the  very  rare  event  a  patient  were  to  attempt  to  perform  an 
injection  using  a  pre-filled  syringe  or  pre-filled  pen  with  a  clogged  needle,  it  is highly 
unlikely there would be any impact on clinical efficacy or safety. 
The  CHMP  concluded  that  there  is  no  impact  on  clinical  safety  due  to  clogging  incidents  when 
using the pre-filled syringe device. 
With  regards  to  the  exceeded  limit  of  the  injection  time  with  the  pre-filled  pen  reported  by  the 
MAH  on  31/01/2014,  the  MAH  withdrew  this  new  presentation  on  11  February  2014.  The  MAH 
also  confirmed  their  ability  to  ensure  commercial  supply  of  the  pre-filled  syringe  to  all 
rheumatoid arthritis patients once approved and to subjects enrolled in on-going clinical studies. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Rheumatoid  arthritis  is  a  chronic  inflammatory  and  potentially  disabling  chronic  systemic 
inflammatory  disease,  characterised  by  inflammation  of  the  synovium  leading  to  irreversible 
destruction of the joints and disability. An established treatment option for patients with adult RA 
is TCZ IV in combination with MTX. However IV infusion requires administration by a healthcare 
professional (HCP) in a clinical setting, which affects the quality of life of the patient.  
The SC formulation will be a valid option for patients. From the medical point of view, one benefit 
of  the  SC  route  of  administration  is  that  it  does  not  require  an  IV  access,  which  is  especially 
important  for  patients  with  poor  venous  access.  The  shorter  administration  time  and  the  option 
to  receive  the  treatment  independent  for  a  HCP  are  additional  advantages  of  the  SC  route 
compared to the IV route.  
The unfavourable effects of TCZ are established and include infection, gastro-intestinal disorders, 
infusion  reactions,  skin  disorders,  neutropenia,  elevation  in  hepatic  enzymes  and  lipid 
parameters. 
Following reports of clogging of the needle with the new pre-filled syringe presentation, the MAH 
proposed  changes to the product information  in  sections  6.3  and  6.6  of the  SmPC as  well  as in 
the Package Leaflet in sections 5 and 6 (Instructions for Use Steps 2 and 5). This is supported by 
CHMP. The CHMP concluded that there is no impact on clinical efficacy or safety due to clogging

incidents  when  using  the  pre-filled  syringe  device.  With  regards  to  the  exceeded  limit  of  the 
injection time with the pre-filled pen, the MAH withdrew this new presentation.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
TCZ  IV  in  combination  with  methotrexate  (MTX)  is  an  established  treatment  option  for  adult 
patients with RA. For the proposed dose regimen of TCZ via the SC route, non-inferiority to the 
established  TCZ  IV  regimen  was  demonstrated  with  a  comparable  safety  profile.  The  risks  are 
well addressed in the SmPC and appropriate additional Pharmacovigilance and risk minimisation 
activities are included in the RMP. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considers  by 
consensus that the risk-benefit balance of RoActemra 162 mg solution for injection in a pre-filled 
syringe (subcutaneous injection) in the treatment of: 
RoActemra, in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is indicated for the treatment of moderate 
to  severe  active  rheumatoid  arthritis  (RA)  in  adult  patients  who  have  either  responded 
inadequately to, or who were intolerant to, previous therapy with one or more disease-modifying 
anti-rheumatic  drugs  (DMARDs)  or  tumour  necrosis  factor  (TNF)  antagonists.  In  these  patients, 
RoActemra  can  be  given  as  monotherapy  in  case  of  intolerance  to  MTX  or  where  continued 
treatment with MTX is inappropriate. 
RoActemra has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-
ray and to improve physical function when given in combination with methotrexate. 
is favourable and therefore recommends  the granting of the marketing authorisation.

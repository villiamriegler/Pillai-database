1.  Introduction 
On 16 November 2015, the MAH submitted the completed paediatric study A3L39 for Hexaxim/ 
Hexacima/ Hexyon, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric study does not influence the benefit risk balance for 
Hexaxim™/Hexacima™/Hexyon™ and that no consequential regulatory action is required. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that A3L39  ‘Immunogenicity and Safety Study of a Hexavalent DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib 
Combined Vaccine in a 3-dose Primary Series in Healthy Infants in Europe’  is a stand-alone study. 
The MAH stated that the booster part of A3L39 (=A3L40) will end November 2015. A3L40 final clinical 
study report will be submitted in Q2 2016 (=MEA 006). 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Commercially available lots of Hexyon, Pentavac and Infanrix hexa as well as concomitant vaccines 
(Prevenar 13, RotaTeq, NeisVac-C) were used.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Hexaxim™/Hexacima™/Hexyon™ is indicated for active immunisation (primary and booster 
vaccination) of infants and toddlers from six weeks to 24 months of age against diphtheria (D), 
tetanus (T), pertussis, Hepatitis B (Hep B), poliomyelitis and invasive diseases caused by 
Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). 
The MAH submitted the final report for: 
A3L39: Immunogenicity and Safety Study of a Hexavalent DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib 
Combined Vaccine in a 3-dose Primary Series in Healthy Infants in Europe. 
To simplify matters, this report mentions only Hexyon as study vaccine. However, the information 
equally applies to Hexacima and Hexaxim. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Description 
The purpose of the Phase III study A3L39 is to assess the immunogenicity and safety of Hexyon and 
compare it to the control Infanrix hexa in infants in a 3-dose regimen for primary immunization at 2, 3, 
and 4 months of age (MoA) in the Czech Republic and Germany. However, another immunization 
schedule in use in Europe, the mixed, so-called ‘Hexa/Penta/Hexa’ schedule, has still not been 
addressed in a clinical study; this schedule consists of the investigational hexavalent vaccine 
(containing Hep B) to be administered at 2 and 6 MoA and a pediatric combination pentavalent vaccine

(Pentavac®) containing all the antigens of the hexavalent vaccine except Hep B, at 4 MoA. For this 
purpose, the Phase III study A3L39 is also designed to assess, in an open-label manner, the 
immunogenicity and safety of the mixed schedule in Spain, in infants who had received a first dose of 
Hep B vaccine prior to the study.  
The study is designed i) to test the non-inferiority against Hep B, Hib and pertussis toxoid (PT), 
filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) of Hexyon compared to Infanrix hexa; ii) to descriptively evaluate the 
immunogenicity of Hexyon compared to Infanrix hexa; iii) to descriptively evaluate the immunogenicity 
of the mixed Hexa/Penta/Hexa schedule; iv) to descriptively evaluate the immunogenicity of 
concomitantly administered routine vaccines (Prevenar™ 13 [PCV13] in Czech Republic and Germany; 
and RotaTeq® in Czech Republic, Germany, and Spain); and v) to describe the safety profile of Hexyon 
when given in a 3-dose regimen or a mixed schedule and when administered with commonly licensed 
pediatric vaccines. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
a)  Immunogenicity: 
•  Primary – Groups 1 and 2 only: To demonstrate the non-inferiority of Hexyon to Infanrix

b)  Safety:  
•  Secondary only - To describe the safety profile after each and any injection for each study 
group. 
Study design 
This was a Phase III multi-centre study in the Czech Republic, Germany, and Spain in 795 infants of 2 
months of age (MoA).  
The subjects from the Czech Republic and Germany (total 530) were 1:1 randomized to receive in an 
observer-blinded manner at 2, 3, and 4 MoA 
Group 1  - Hexyon, concomitantly with Prevenar 13 and RotaTeq 
Group 2  - Infanrix hexa, concomitantly with Prevenar 13 and RotaTeq  
The subjects were to be followed up for a total of 3 months. 
Subjects from Spain (total 265) who had been administered a first dose of hepatitis B vaccine prior to 
study start were automatically assigned to Group 3 (open-label). They received  
   - Hexyon at 2 and 6 MoA, and Pentavac at 4 MoA, concomitantly with 
   - Prevenar 13 at 2 and 4 MoA or at 2, 4 and 6 MoA,  
     depending upon local use and the Investigator’s judgment  
   - and NeisVac-C at 2 MoA,  
   - and RotaTeq at 2, 4 and 6 MoA.  
The subjects were to be followed up for a total of 5 months. 
There were 4 visits (V) scheduled with vaccinations at V01, V02, and V03 and blood samplings (5 mL 
each) at V01 and V04 (30 days after the 3rd vaccination). 
Diary Cards (DCs) were provided at V01, V02, and V03. At 2 to 3 days, then 8 to 10 days following 
each vaccination, the subjects’ parents/legally acceptable representatives were contacted by phone to 
ensure that the DCs were completed.  
Solicited reactions were to be collected for Hexyon, Infanrix hexa, Pentavac and Prevenar 13. 
Trial period: 21 Jan 2014 (FVFS) to 27 Nov 2014 (LVLS).

The sample size of Group 3 (265 subjects) was arbitrarily defined since the data for Group 3 were used 
for descriptive purposes only. 
A sample size of 265 subjects allowed detecting with 0.95 probability, an AE occurring with a true 
frequency of at least 1.12%. 
Treatments 
Groups 1 and 2: 
Subjects were to receive 3 doses of either Hexyon or Infanrix hexa, respectively, both co-administered 
with Prevenar 13 and RotaTeq at 2, 3, and 4 MoA. 
Group 3: 
Subjects were to receive 2 doses of Hexyon at 2 MoA and 6 MoA and 1 dose of Pentavac at 4 MoA. 
Prevenar 13 was co-administered at 2 and 4 MoA or at 2, 4, and 6 MoA depending upon local use and 
the Investigator’s judgment, NeisVac-C was co-administered at 2 MoA, and RotaTeq at 2, 4, and 6 
MoA.

Pre-defined AESIs: 
Extensive limb swelling (ELS), hypotonic hyporesponsive episode (HHE) and convulsions (whether 
febrile or not), anaphylactic reactions, apnea, severe neurological conditions were considered important 
identified or potential risks. In addition, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or sudden unexpected 
death (SUD) were closely monitored although not associated with multivalent pediatric vaccines. 
Immunoassays applied: 
All immunological assays were carried out at the Sponsor’s laboratory in Swiftwater, Pennsylvania, 
USA, or at qualified contract laboratories. Results thus correlated to results obtained in previous studies 
with Hexyon /Hexacima /Hexaxim. 
Priority of determinations was as follows: anti-Hep B, anti-PRP, anti-PT, and anti-FHA, anti-D, anti-T, 
anti-poliovirus type 1, 2, 3, pneumococcal serotypes 1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, 19A, 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and

CHMP comment: 
Established correlates and accepted surrogates of protection were applied to calculate seroprotection 
rates (D, T, IPV, HepB, PRP, pneumococcal PS, RV) and vaccine response rates (PT, FHA). The 
serological assays were in accordance to those used in previous studies with Hexyon and concomitant 
vaccines. 
Furthermore, the safety observations were in accordance to those applied in previous vaccine studies 
conducted in the EU.

Statistical Methods 
Hypotheses and Statistical Methods for Primary Objective 
The objective was to demonstrate that the immune response to Hexyon was non-inferior to that to the 
Infanrix hexa, both co-administered with Prevenar 13, in terms of seroprotection/vaccine response 
rates for Hep B, PT, FHA and PRP antigens 1 month after a 3-dose schedule (2, 4, 6 MoA). 
The individual tested hypotheses for the valence i were as follows: 
With   P = seroprotection or vaccine response rate 
tested = tested study vaccine 
reference = reference vaccine 
δ = clinically acceptable limit to conclude to non-inferiority (10%) 
Non-inferiority was demonstrated if the hypothesis H0 was rejected. 
For each antigen, a non-inferiority test was performed using the 95% 2-sided CI of the difference 
PTested-PReference between the seroprotection/vaccine response rates (α=2.5%). The 95% CI was 
calculated based on the Wilson score method without continuity correction as quoted by Newcombe. 
For each antigen, non-inferiority was demonstrated if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI of the 
difference of proportions was greater than -δi%. The primary objective was reached if the non-
inferiority was proven for all the antigens. The hypothesis of non-inferiority was tested on the per-
protocol (PP) analysis set and was to be confirmed using the full analysis set (FAS). 
Statistical Methods for Secondary and Observational Objectives 
Only descriptive statistics were provided.  
The 95% CI was calculated: 
•  Using the exact binomial method (Clopper-Pearson method) for single proportions

Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed  
A total of 794 subjects (266, 263 and 265 subjects in Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively) were 
randomized, all but 1 (in Group 1) were vaccinated at V01.  
Adherence to vaccination schedule was high; there were 4 subjects with early termination, none of 
which was due to an AE or SAE.  
There were 791 subjects included in the FAS (264 in Group 1, 262 in Group 2 and 265 in Group 3). 
Besides the 1 subject not vaccinated at V01 two additional subjects with improper unblinding were 
excluded from the FAS.   
None of the subjects discontinued the study due to an SAE. However, an SAE (convulsions) related to 
Hexyon observed for one subject in Group 1 led to the subject’s discontinuation for the subsequent 
dose (see safety section). 
A total of 712 subjects were included in the PP analysis set. The 82 subjects (10.3%) excluded from 
the PP analysis set had at least one protocol deviation. The most prevalent violation types were 
vaccination at an improper time window (51 subjects/ 6.4%) and either no provision of 2nd blood 
sample or 2nd blood drawn at an improper time window (24 subjects/ 3%; for details refer to Table 
4.3, A3L39 CSR).  
Overall, 791 subjects were included in the safety analysis set (SafAS): 265 (99.6%) in Group 1, 261 
(99.6%) in Group 2 and 265 (100%) in Group 3. 
The mean age of the subjects at baseline was between 62 days in Group 3 and 63 days in Groups 1 
and 2, with an age range between 55 and 75 days. For German subjects from Groups 1 and 2, the 
age was not calculated as the date of birth was not collected. 
Within the FAS of the various groups, between 48 and 52% of subjects were female; the mean weight 
at baseline was 5.2 kg (range 2.7 – 8.5 kg). Most of the subjects (96 to 98% in Groups 1, 2 and 3) 
were White (Table 5). 
CHMP comment: 
It is not clear why 2 subjects were excluded from the FAS due to improper unblinding. The MAH is 
asked to comment on this.

Immunogenicity results 
Primary 
The primary immunogenicity objective was to demonstrate the non-inferiority of Hexyon to the control, 
Infanrix hexa, both co-administered with Prevenar 13, in terms of seroprotection or vaccine response 
rates to PT, FHA, Hep B and PRP antigens, 1 month after a 3-dose primary series (Table 6).

Non-inferiority of Hexyon compared to Infanrix hexa in terms of seroprotection rates (for Hep B and 
PRP) and vaccine response rates (for PT and FHA) was demonstrated as the lower bound of the 2-sided 
95% CI of the difference in response rates between groups was greater than -10% for each of the 4 
vaccine components. 
High proportions of subjects in each group showed immunoprotection against the 4 antigens following 
a 3-dose primary vaccination: 96% and 99% of vaccinees, respectively, in Groups 1 (Hexyon) and 2 
(Infanrix hexa) were protected against Hep B at ≥ 10 mIU/mL and 91% and 86%, respectively, were 
protected against HiB PRP at ≥ 0.15 µg/mL. In addition, for 98% of subjects in both groups vaccine 
response against PT was shown and for 99% and 95% of subjects in Groups 1 and 2, respectively, 
vaccine response against FHA was demonstrated.  
Similar results were obtained for the FAS. 
CHMP comment: 
Non-inferiority of Hexyon compared to Infanrix hexa was demonstrated with regard to seroprotection 
against Hep B and PRP and vaccine response against the pertussis antigens PT and FHA at 1 month 
post-dose 3 following primary vaccination at 2, 3 and 4 MoA with hexavalent vaccine administered 
concomitantly with PCV13 and RotaTeq. 
Regarding PRP, in the present study the seroprotection rate was somewhat lower than that observed in 
previous studies following a 3-dose primary vaccination, i.e., in the SmPC 96% seroprotection at ≥ 
0.15 µg/mL has been documented whereas in the present study 91% of subjects in the Hexyon group 
were protected at ≥ 0.15 µg/mL.  
Secondary Immunogenicity Objectives 
Hexyon vs. Infanrix hexa (Groups 1 and 2); primary vaccination at 2, 3, 4 MoA: 
Following the 3-dose primary vaccination at 2, 3 and 4 MoA all subjects in the Hexyon and Infanrix 
hexa groups reached the short-term protection levels of ≥0.01 IU/mL against diphtheria (Table 7).  
62% and 58% of subjects, respectively, showed long-term protective Ab levels of ≥0.1 IU/mL.  
Every subject in the Hexyon and Infanrix hexa groups reached the long-term protective Ab level of 
≥0.1 IU/mL against tetanus at 1 month-post Dose 3. Furthermore, every subject showed anti-polio 
type 1, 2, and 3 titers ≥8 (1/dil).  
90% of subjects in both groups showed an at least 4-fold increase in anti-PT antibody levels from 
baseline to 1-month post-Dose 3 (defined as ‘seroconversion’). For 89% of subjects in the Hexyon 
group and 76% in the Infanrix hexa group, seroconversion for FHA following the 3-dose primary 
vaccination was shown. 
Regarding Hep B, in the Hexyon group 72% of subjects reached long-term protective Ab levels of ≥100 
mIU/mL. This proportion is lower than that for the Infanrix hexa group (87% of subjects, with non-
overlapping 95% CI). This has already been observed in previous comparative studies with Hexyon 
and Infanrix hexa. Regarding PRP, 59% of subjects in the Hexyon group and 37% in the Infanrix hexa 
group reached long-term protective Ab levels at ≥1 µg/mL.  These effects are reflected by higher Ab 
concentrations against PRP but lower Ab levels against Hep B in the Hexyon group following the 3-dose 
primary vaccination at 2, 3 and 4 MoA compared to the Infanrix hexa group(Table 8).  
Overall, immunogenicity data for each of the Hexyon antigens are in accordance to respective data in 
the SmPC except for PRP for which somewhat lower seroprotection rates were detected in the present 
study.

Immune response against concomitant vaccines: 
At least 90% of subjects in both groups reached protective anti-rotavirus (RV) IgA levels of ≥20 U/mL 
at 1 month-post 3rd dose. At least 87% of subjects showed seroconversion defined as anti-RV IgA 
levels ≥20 U/mL in infants seronegative at baseline (<20 U/mL) (Table 9).  
At least 93% of subjects in both groups were protected at ≥0.35 µg/mL against each of the PCV13 
pneumococcal serotypes at 1 month-post-3rd vaccination. Exceptions were serotype 6B for which 
seroprotection rates of 77% and 86% in Group 1 and Group 2, respectively, were found and serotype 5 
with a protection rate of 87% in Group 1 (Table 9). Overall, anti-pneumococcal GMCs tended to be 
lower in Group 1 compared to Group 2 (Table 10). 
Hexyon (Group 3); primary vaccination at 2, 4, 6 MoA: 
Following the 3 dose vaccination at 2, 4 and 6 MoA, all subjects were seroprotected against diphtheria 
at ≥0.01 IU/mL; and for even 98% of vaccinees long-term seroprotection at ≥0.1 IU/mL was shown 1 
month after the 3rd Hexyon dose. In addition, all subjects had long-term protective anti-tetanus Ab 
levels of ≥0.1 IU/mL at this timepoint. All but one subjects showed vaccine response against PT and 
FHA (99.5% and 100%, respectively) and 90% and 96% of subjects had an at least 4-fold Ab increase 
(‘seroconversion’) against PT and FHA, respectively, from baseline to 1 month-post 3rd dose  
(Table 11).   
All subjects in this group showed seroprotection against poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 at ≥8 (1/dil.), 
except for one subject that missed this titre for type 2.  
All but 2 subjects (99%) reached the short-term seroprotective anti-Hep B Ab level of ≥10 mIU/mL 
and even 97% showed seroprotection at the more conservative long-term level of ≥100 mIU/mL. 
Furthermore, all subjects were protected against HiB PRP at ≥0.15 µg/mL and 92% were protected at 
the long-term level of ≥1 µg/mL. 
In general, much higher GMCs/GMTs for each of the valences were measured following the 2, 4, 6 
months vaccination schedule than after the condensed 2, 3, 4 months schedule (Table 12). Only for 
PT and FHA, the differences between Group 1 and Group 3 were much lower.  
Please note that Group 3 subjects received a monovalent Hep B vaccine at birth. Subjects, however, 
were only twice vaccinated with Hexyon at 2 and 6 MoA. At 4 MoA, Pentavac (without Hep B) was 
given. 
RV seroprotection rates following the 2, 4, 6 months vaccination schedule were in the range of those 
following the condensed schedule (2, 3, 4 months). At 1 month-post 3rd dose, 91% of subjects reached 
serum IgA levels of ≥20 U/mL, and 88% of subjects seronegative at baseline were seroprotected at  
≥20 U/mL one month after the 3rd dose (Table 13).  
Similar immunogenicity results were obtained in the FAS. 
CHMP comment: 
Seroprotection and vaccine response rates following the 3-dose primary vaccination at 2, 3 and 4 
months were in accordance to those of previous studies with Hexyon/ Hexacima/ Hexaxim except for 
PRP, for which a somewhat lower seroprotection rate at ≥0.15 µg/mL was observed (91% compared to 
96% mentioned in the SmPC). 
Seroprotection rates against the 13 serotypes contained in PCV13 were in the range of those 
previously obtained with PCV13.

Furthermore, immunogenicity results obtained for Group 3 with the 3-dose vaccination schedule at 2, 
4, and 6 MoA were concordant to those obtained in previous studies with Hexyon. The high Hep B 
GMCs obtained in this group very probably result from the extended Hep B vaccination schedule, i.e., 1 
monovalent Hep B dose at birth, then 2 doses Hexyon at 2 and at 6 MoA. However, the GMCs / GMTs 
for the other valences of Hexyon were also generally higher than after the condensed 2, 3, 4 months-
vaccination schedule. This is also known from other studies with hexavalent DTaP-IPV-HepB-HiB 
vaccines administered at 2, 4, and 6 MoA.

Safety results (Tables 14 to 18) 
Within 30 minutes after any vaccine injection, 5 subjects (1.9%) in Group 1 and 2 subjects (0.8%) in 
Group 2 experienced at least 1 immediate unsolicited AE. For 3 subjects in Group 1 and both subjects 
in Group 2 these AEs were documented as immediate unsolicited adverse reactions (ARs) (flatulence, 
cough, abdominal pain and restlessness of various grades). None of the subjects in Group 3 
experienced an immediate unsolicited AE/AR. 
Within 7 days after any vaccine injection, a vast majority of subjects (98 – 99%) in all groups 
experienced at least 1 solicited reaction. Solicited injection site reactions were reported with similar 
frequencies in Groups 1 and 2 after each vaccine injection (83% and 82%, respectively) and with a 
somewhat lower frequency (77%) in Group 3. The frequencies of solicited injection site reactions were 
similar at the Hexyon, Pentavac or Infanrix hexa site as compared to Prevenar 13 site (contralateral 
application) in all groups. The most frequent injection site reactions were pain, erythema, and swelling. 
Grade 3 injection site reactions were experienced with a frequency of 10% and 9%, respectively, in 
Groups 1 and 2 and 6% in Group 3. Most of the injection site reactions were reported within 3 days 
after injection, were of Grade 1 or 2 in intensity and lasted up to maximum 3 days. 
CHMP comment: 
Since Group 3 subjects were administered at 2 MoA PCV-13 and NeisVac-C at the same location, 
injection site reactions at this time point cannot be differentiated for these 2 vaccines. However, in this 
group, injection site reactions at the PCV13 (+ NeisVac-C) site following the 1st injection were either in 
the same range as those in Group 1 and Group 2 (for injection site pain) or even recorded at a lower 
frequency than in the other groups (for injection site erythema and swelling).  
Grade 3 systemic reactions were observed in 18%, 13% and 17% of subjects in Groups 1, 2, and 3, 
respectively. All subjects received a Prevenar 13 and RotaTeq dose concomitantly with the hexavalent 
study vaccines (plus a dose of NeisVac-C in Group 3 at 2 MoA). Therefore, it is not possible to 
discriminate if the systemic reactions reported were caused by the hexa-/ pentavalent vaccine or by

(one of the) concomitant vaccines. Overall, there were no notable differences in Groups 1, 2 and 3 in 
terms of proportions of subjects experiencing solicited systemic reactions within 7 days after any 
injection except for pyrexia which was reported at a higher frequency in Group 1 (73%) than in Group 
2 and 3 (57 and 59%, respectively).  
The most frequently reported solicited systemic reaction after any vaccine injection was irritability (up 
to 84% of subjects), followed by crying (up to 77%) and somnolence (up to 74%). The majority of 
solicited systemic reactions were of Grade 1 or Grade 2 intensity. Grade 3 solicited systemic reactions 
were infrequent. Most solicited systemic reactions occurred within 3 days after injection and resolved 
within 3 days, however, some were still ongoing at D8. 
Within 30 days after any vaccine injection, unsolicited AEs were reported for a similar proportion of 
subjects in Group 1 (41%) and Group 2 (40%) but for a higher proportion (70%) of Group 3 subjects. 
The most frequent unsolicited AEs were in the SOC ‘Infections and infestations’, followed by 
‘Gastrointestinal disorders’, ‘Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders’ and ‘Skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders’.  
Unsolicited ARs were reported for a low proportion of subjects in Group 1 (6%), Group 2 (3%) and 
Group 3 (2%). For all subjects, the unsolicited ARs were not serious, except for Subject [confidential 
information] in Group 1 who experienced convulsions after the second vaccine injection (see below). 
Most of these unsolicited ARs were of Grade 1 or Grade 2 intensity, emerged within 5 days after 
injection and lasted up to 5 days.  
Within 30 days after any vaccine injection, 9, 8 and 7 subjects in Groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively, 
experienced at least 1 SAE. During the study, a total of 36 SAEs were reported for 32 subjects. 12 and 
9 subjects in Groups 1 and 2, respectively, and 7 subjects in Group 3 experienced at least 1 SAE. None 
of the SAEs were related to treatment, except for Subject [confidential information] in Group 1 who 
experienced convulsions related to Hexyon according to the Investigator (also reported as AESI).  
There was no AE leading to study discontinuation. However, the SAE (convulsions) for Subject 
[confidential information] related to Hexyon vaccination led to the subject’s discontinuation for the 
subsequent dose.  
No death was reported during the study.  
Narrative of subject [confidential information]: 
The subject had convulsions 10 days after the 2nd dose of Hexyon, Prevenar 13 and RotaTeq; the event 
led to hospitalization. The subject experienced 3 other episodes of convulsions on the day of 
hospitalization and another episode 3 days later. The subject recovered under treatment 7 days after 
the first episode and was discharged from the hospital 4 days later. Although the subject continued the 
trial, the SAE led to the subject’s discontinuation for the subsequent dose. Therefore the subject did 
not receive the third Hexyon dose.  
The event of convulsions was reported by the Investigator as related to Hexyon and RotaTeq and 
unrelated to Prevenar 13 or to trial procedure. However, the time to onset of 10 days is rather 
suggestive of a relationship with a live vaccine (RotaTeq) than with inactivated vaccines (Hexyon and 
Prevenar). Therefore, the event was reported by the company as unrelated to Hexyon or Prevenar 13 
or to trial procedure, and related to RotaTeq. 
After completion of the study and 4 months after the first episode, the subject experienced another 
episode of convulsions and was hospitalized. The subject recovered after 4 days under treatment. This 
new episode was reported by the Investigator as unrelated to vaccination.

Other SAEs (hemangioma, head injury, inguinal hernia, hematemesis, various infections, exanthema 
subitum, myoclonus, poor weight gain) were considered by the Investigator as unrelated to 
vaccination.  
CHMP comment: 
From the narrative of the affected subject a causative relationship between the SAE of convulsions and 
vaccination, particularly with Hexyon, was very unlikely.   
The CHMP agrees that all other SAEs were unrelated to vaccination or study procedures.  
No new safety issues evolved.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects          
Non-inferiority of Hexyon compared to Infanrix hexa in terms of seroprotection/vaccine response rates 
1 month after the 3rd dose of the primary vaccination at 2, 3 and 4 months was demonstrated for PT, 
FHA, Hep B, and PRP antigens. 
Hexyon and Infanrix hexa were highly immunogenic. Most of the subjects were seroprotected against 
D, T, poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3, PRP and Hep B at 1 month-post 3rd dose. Most of the subjects 
showed a vaccine response to PT and FHA antigens 1 month after the third dose of the primary series. 
These results were consistent with the results obtained in other trials with these hexavalent vaccines.  
The immunogenicity data elicited by Prevenar 13 and RotaTeq were similar whether co-administered 
with Hexyon or Infanrix hexa. 
GMCs / GMTs following the 2, 4, 6 months vaccination schedule were either in the same range or 
higher than after the condensed 2, 3, 4 month schedule. The successive administrations of Hexyon and 
Pentavac in the ‘Hexa/Penta/Hexa’ schedule elicited a high immune response against Hep B in subjects 
who had received a first Hep B vaccine dose at birth. 
The safety profile of Hexyon administered at 2, 3, 4 MoA was good and similar to that of Infanrix hexa. 
Both vaccines were well tolerated. Similarly, the safety profile of Hexyon administered in the 
‘Hexa/Penta/Hexa’ schedule at 2, 4, and 6 MoA was good, too.  
No new safety concerns evolved. No death or AEs leading to study discontinuation were reported 
during the study. However, one SAE (convulsions) related to Hexyon vaccination (2nd dose) led to the 
subject’s discontinuation for the 3rd dose.

3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
Hexyon was non-inferior compared to Infanrix hexa in terms of seroprotection rates for Hep B and PRP 
and vaccine response rates for PT and FHA, determined at 1 month-post 3rd dose following the 
primary vaccination at 2, 3 and 4 months with co-administration of Prevenar 13 and RotaTeq. 
Hexyon and Infanrix hexa were highly immunogenic. At least 90% of the subjects in both groups were 
seroprotected against D, T, poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3, PRP and Hep B at 1 month-post 3rd dose at 
the pre-defined short-term protection thresholds except for PRP in the Infanrix hexa subjects (86% 
seroprotection). At least 95% of the subjects showed a vaccine response to PT and FHA antigens 1 
month after the third primary dose. In the Hexyon group, GMCs for PRP were somewhat higher and 
those for Hep B were somewhat lower than following vaccination with Infanrix hexa. This has already 
been observed in previous comparative studies using these hexavalent vaccines.  
Regarding PRP, in the present study the seroprotection rate at ≥0.15 µg/mL in the Hexyon group 
(91%; 95% CI: 87; 95%) was somewhat lower than, however still in the range of, that documented in 
the SmPC (96%). 
The seroprotection rates elicited by Prevenar 13 and RotaTeq (co-administered) were similar in the 
Hexyon and Infanrix hexa groups. 
Seroprotection /vaccine response rates and GMCs / GMTs for D, T, poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3, PT, 
FHA, PRP following the 2, 4, 6 months vaccination schedule were either in the same range or higher 
than after the condensed 2, 3, 4 month schedule. This is known from previous studies using this 
vaccination schedule.  
Hexyon and Pentavac administered alternately in the ‘Hexa/Penta/Hexa’ schedule elicited a very high 
immune response and long-term seroprotective Ab levels against Hep B in subjects who received a first 
Hep B vaccine dose at birth. 
The safety profile of Hexyon was good in both vaccination schedules. No death or AEs leading to study 
discontinuation were reported although one SAE of convulsions related to Hexyon led to the subject’s 
discontinuation for the subsequent dose. 
In summary, no new safety concerns evolved.

4.  Additional clarification requested 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this 
procedure: 
• 
It is not clear why 2 subjects were excluded from the FAS due to improper unblinding. The 
MAH is asked to comment on this. 
The timetable is a 30 day response timetable with clock stop. 
MAH response to Request for supplementary information 
Sanofi Pasteur, Sponsor of the Phase III A3L39 study was notified during the course of the study that 
RP Düsseldorf, Local Regulatory, was planning an inspection in the region of their responsibility.  Local 
Regulatory decision was to inspect the Investigational site #312, Dr. Donner (Dr. Matthias Donner & 
Dr. Martin Lüchtrath, Specialist for Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Neuropediatrics – Neonatology, 
Nordstraße 75, 41236 Mönchengladbach, Germany); the inspection was performed on December 17, 
2014 and February 04, 2015. 
It was noted during the inspection that a critical defect was determined regarding the blinding of 2 
patients. Therefore, the Inspectors’ request was that the data of the patients concerned cannot be 
used. 
Summary of the observation: 
‘The randomization (visit 1) along with the further allocation of vaccines for visits 2 and 3 is made via 
the company Clinphone’s IWR (Interactive Web Response) system. The randomization as well as the 
operations for visits 2 and 3 were carried out exclusively by the unblinded study staff. An unblinding 
IWRS confirmation email is sent to the unblinded study team. Within this email the unblinded co-
workers receive the instructions as to which medication is to be prepared for each respective patient 
(indication of medication numbers and vaccine names on the email). This email is filed in the unblinded 
study file. 
A corresponding blinded confirmation email (only the indication of the medication number) is sent to 
the blinded co-workers (blinded IWRS confirmation). 
On examining the blinded patient files the following was established: Patient [confidential information] 
and [confidential information] - In the blinded patient file, the unblinded IWRS confirmation emails for 
visits 2 or 3 were found. It was indicated on these emails which vaccine the patient received. Both 
email confirmations were dated and signed by Mr. Donner (blinded investigator). Both patients were 
thus unblinded by the study site.’ 
In answer to the Local Regulatory’s request to not use the data of Patients [confidential information]  
and [confidential information] , which were unblinded by the study site, Sanofi Pasteur (Sponsor of the 
study), acknowledged the Inspectors’ recommendation and these 2 subjects were not included in the 
immunogenicity and safety analyses. 
Immunogenicity analyses 
The 2 subjects were not in the Per Protocol Analysis set as the information on the group allocation is a 
violation to the defined procedures for a randomized blind-observer study. For the same reason, the 2 
subjects were not part of the Full Analysis set (randomized subjects who received at least one dose of 
the study vaccine).

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/245070/2016  
Page 32/33 
 
 
 
 
Nevertheless, testing of samples drawn at the successive time points was completed, and 
immunogenicity data were presented as listing for individual subjects only; information on the 
deviation to the study procedure for these 2 subjects was briefly presented in the Clinical Study Report 
(CSR). 
Safety analyses 
The 2 subjects were not included in the Safety Analysis Set (subjects who have received the study or 
control vaccine) as the information on the group allocation might have created a bias in the reporting 
of adverse events (AE) and reactions (AR). Moreover, considering that ruling out a subject from the 
safety analysis might be considered as removing AE or AR impacting the global safety profile, safety 
data for these 2 subjects were presented as individual listings. 
In Summary, due to the unblinding of the 2 patients, the decision was to not use the data of the 
patients in the study analyses as recommended by the Inspectors. 
CHMP comment: 
The exclusion of immunogenicity and safety data of 2 subjects not only from the PP set but also the 
FAS as well as the safety analysis set, respectively, was requested by GCP inspectors due to improper 
unblinding of the 2 subjects. Although in the opinion of the CHMP this is disproportionate, it is 
accepted. From the individual immunogenicity results of the subjects it can be inferred that both 
subjects reached seroprotective antibody levels at post-dose 3 against Hexyon and Rotavirus antigens. 
Issue has been solved.

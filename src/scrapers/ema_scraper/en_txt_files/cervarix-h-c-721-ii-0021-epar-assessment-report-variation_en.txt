3.  Scientific discussion 
3.1.  Introduction 
Cervarix (HPV-16/18 L1 AS04 vaccine) is a prophylactic vaccine which contains 20µg per 0.5 mL dose 
of HPV-16 L1 protein and 20µg per 0.5ml dose of HPV-18 L1 protein assembled as virus-like particles 
(VLPs) as active ingredients. The L1 proteins are formulated with AS04 adjuvant system, which is 
composed of 50µg of 3-O-desacyl-4'-mono-phosphoryl-lipid A (MPL) and 500µg of aluminium 
hydroxide salt. The vaccine is preservative-free. 
Cervarix was first registered in 2007 and the vaccine is currently licensed for use in more than 110 
countries. In Europe, Cervarix is indicated for the prevention of premalignant cervical lesions and 
cervical cancer causally related to certain oncogenic Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types. The indication 
is based on the demonstration of efficacy in women aged 15-25 years following vaccination with 
Cervarix and on the immunogenicity of the vaccine in girls and women aged 10-25 years. The 
vaccination course consists of three doses administered according to a 0, 1, 6 month schedule via 
intramuscular injection. 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) has conducted a pooled analysis on the three studies HPV-
029, HPV-030 and HPV-048 to evaluate the immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity in 9 year old 
subjects as compared to 10-14 and 15-25 year old subjects. 
The purpose of this variation is to update the summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for Cervarix 
with data obtained in subjects of 9 years of age and to extend the current indication as from 9 years. 
The data from the pooled analysis demonstrate that 9 year old subjects are non-inferior to 10-14 and 
15-25 year old subjects in terms of immune response and that the 9 year old subjects have a good 
safety and reactogenicity profile, therefore allowing for a change in the indication for the use of 
Cervarix as of the age of 9 years.

Information on Paediatric requirements 
 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 as amended, the application included an 
EMA decision (Decision P/11/2009 on the granting of a product-specific waiver).  
3.2.  Clinical aspects 
3.2.1.  Background 
The age at which HPV vaccination is recommended depends on National guidelines and Government 
vaccination schedules. Universal mass vaccination (UMV) is recommended at 12 years of age in Italy ( 
Assessment report  
Page 4/22
 
 
  
 
 
   
 
European Cervical Cancer Association, 2009; Dorleans F, 2010, Bonanni P, 2011), while in Spain UMV 
is recommended for girls from 11-14 years of age (European Cervical Cancer Association, 2009; 
Dorleans F, 2010, Bonanni P , 2011; Bermudez , 2011). In Austria UMV is recommended for girls from 
9-15 years of age (European Cervical Cancer Association, 2009; Bonanni P, 2011; Impfplan, 2011). 
Outside Europe, UMV is recommended from 9 years of age in some countries. In Canada UMV is 
recommended for girls from 9-14 years of age who have not yet become sexually active (Dube E, 
2007). In the USA, vaccination can be started beginning at 9 years of age but routine vaccination is 
recommended for females aged 11 or 12 years (MMWR, 2010;Recommended Immunizations, 2011). 
The WHO states that the primary target population is likely to be girls within the age range of 9 or 10 
years through to 13 years (WHO, 2009).  
In order to meet recommendations worldwide to vaccinate girls from the age of 9 years, the Company 
conducted a pooled analysis on three studies that enrolled female subjects from the age of 9 years. 
This pooling demonstrates non-inferiority in terms of GMT ratio to the age groups 10-14 and 15-25 
years of age, the latter being the age range for which efficacy of Cervarix has been demonstrated 
before. 
The data support an update of the following Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC). 
3.2.2.  Design and analysis of the pooled analysis 
The pooled analysis included 1792 subjects aged 9 to 25 years of age in the TVC and 1663 in the ATP 
cohort for immunogenicity. 
Subjects included were stratified by age (9 years, 10-14 years and 15-25 years) and pooled into three 
different vaccine groups: 
1.  The HPV only group had received three doses of Cervarix at Month 0, Month 1 and 
Month 6; 
2.  The HPV+co_ad group had received Cervarix and HepB or HAB vaccines co-
administered at Month 0, Month 1 and Month 6; 
3.  The Co_ad only group had received HepB or HAB vaccine at Month 0, Month 1 and 
Month 6. 
From study HPV-048 only subjects who received the standard 3-dose-schedule were included in the 
pooled analysis.  
An overview of each individual study is provided below.

Study HPV-049 title: A phase I/II, partially blind, randomized, multicenter, age-stratified, dose-
range study in healthy females aged 9 - 25 years to assess the safety and immunogenicity of HPV-
16/18 L1 
VLP AS04 vaccine administered intramuscularly according to a 2-dose schedule (0,2-month or 0,6-
month) when compared to a standard 3- dose schedule of HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine. 
HPV-049 study design 
In order to increase the number of evaluable 9 year old subjects for the analysis of the immunogenicity 
objective, an analysis was conducted to demonstrate non-inferiority of the HPV-16 and HPV-18 
immune response in the pooled 9 year old subjects who received Cervarix (HPV only) compared to the 
group of pooled 9 year old females who received Cervarix concomitantly with Engerix or Twinrix 
(HPV+co_ad) in terms of GMT ratio one month after completion of the three-dose vaccination schedule 
(Month 7). 
If non-inferiority was to be shown then the two vaccine groups HPV only and HPV+co_ad for the 9 year 
old subjects were to be pooled to form the group HPV_pool/9y to be used for the two non-inferiority 
analyses as described below. 
The pooled analysis had two objectives: 
 
Immunogenicity (assessed sequentially) 
1) 
To demonstrate non-inferiority of the HPV-16 and HPV-18 immune response between the pooled 
groups HPV only and HPV+co_ad for the 9 year old subjects (HPV_pool/9y) compared to the 
pooled groups HPV only and HPV+co_ad for the 10-14 year old subjects (HPV_pool/10-14y) in 
terms of GMT ratio one month after completion of three-dose vaccination (Month 7). 
2) 
To demonstrate non-inferiority of the HPV-16 and HPV-18 immune response between the pooled 
groups HPV only and HPV+co_ad for the 9 year old subjects (HPV_pool/9y) compared to the 
Assessment report  
Page 7/22
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
pooled groups HPV only and HPV+co_ad for the 15-25 year old subjects (HPV_pool/15-25y) in 
terms of GMT ratio one month after completion of three-dose vaccination (Month 7). 
 
Safety/Reactogenicity 
To evaluate the occurrence, intensity and causal relationship to vaccination of solicited local and 
general symptoms during the 7-day period (day 0 to 6) following each and any vaccination in the 
groups HPV only, HPV+co_ad and Co_ad only for 9 year old subjects; the occurrence, intensity and 
relationship to vaccination of unsolicited symptoms during the 30-day period (days 0 to 29) following 
each and any vaccination in the groups HPV only, HPV+co_ad and Co_ad only for 9 year old subjects; 
and the occurrence, intensity and relationship to vaccination of new onset chronic diseases (NOCDs), 
new onset autoimmune diseases (NOADs), medically significant adverse events (AEs) and serious 
adverse events (SAEs) in the groups HPV only, HPV+co_ad and Co_ad only for 9 year old subjects up 
to Month 7. 
Study power 
The pooled analysis had no power and is purely descriptive. The three individual studies enrolled 
sufficient subjects per group in order to assure an acceptable global power to reach their primary 
objectives 
Subjects evaluated 
In the three individual studies HPV-029, HPV-030 and HPV-048, healthy females were enrolled after 
checking eligibility criteria at study entry. Exclusion criteria aimed to prevent administration of the 
study vaccines to individuals with medical conditions that might have interfered with the immune 
response; to those individuals at risk of possible adverse reactions to the vaccine; those in whom 
previous exposure to the vaccine antigens through vaccination, disease or known exposure would 
prevent interpretation of the results; and those who were breastfeeding, pregnant or at risk of 
becoming pregnant during the study. 
All subjects included in the pooled analysis were females between 9 and 25 years. The subjects were 
stratified by age (9 years, 10-14 years and 15-25 years) and pooled into three different vaccine groups: 
HPV only group in which all subjects received Cervarix according to a three dose schedule at Months 0, 
1 and 6; HPV+co_ad group in which the subjects received Cervarix and Engerix or Twinrix co-
administered; and Co_ad only group in which the subjects received Engerix or Twinrix alone. 
The pooled analysis included 1792 subjects aged 9-25 years in the TVC (516 were 9 years old) and 
1663 in the ATP cohort (473 were 9 years old).  
The demographic characteristics for the TVC were similar to the ATP cohort for immunogenicity with no 
major differences. 
Methodology 
The primary cohort for the analysis of the immunogenicity of the pooled analysis was the According to 
protocol (ATP) cohort. The ATP immunogenicity cohort included all subjects who met all eligibility 
criteria, who complied with protocol-defined procedures, who had no elimination criteria during the 
study, and for whom data concerning immunogenicity endpoint measures were available. 
For the purpose of this pooled analysis geometric mean antibody concentration/titre (GMT), with 95% 
CI, was calculated using standard methods.   
In order to increase the evaluable number of 9 year old subjects, non-inferiority between the HPV only 
group and the HPV+co_ad group had to be demonstrated first to allow pooling of these two vaccine 
groups. 
Assessment report  
Page 8/22
 
 
 
   
 
 
To demonstrate non-inferiority for the 9 year old between the HPV only group and the HPV+co_ad 
group, the pre-required margin on the GMT ratios (HPV only / HPV+co_ad) was set at 2. 
The immunogenicity endpoints were the following: 
 
To demonstrate non-inferiority between the pooled groups HPV only and HPV+co_ad for the 9 year 
old subjects compared to the pooled groups HPV only and HPV+co_ad for the 10-14 year old 
subjects. The pre-required margin on the GMT ratios (HPV_pool/10-14y / HPV_pool/9y) was set at 
2; 
 
To demonstrate non-inferiority between the pooled groups HPV only and HPV+co_ad for the 9 year 
old subjects compared to the pooled groups HPV only and HPV+co_ad for the 15-25 year old 
subjects. The pre-required margin on the GMT ratios (HPV_pool/15-25y / HPV_pool/9y) was set at 
2.  
The safety endpoints are described below: 
 
The occurrence, intensity and causal relationship to vaccination of solicited local and general 
symptoms during the 7-day period (day 0 to 6) following each and any vaccination in the groups 
HPV only, HPV+co_ad and Co_ad only for 9 year old subjects. 
 
The occurrence, intensity and relationship to vaccination of unsolicited symptoms during the 30-
day period (days 0 to 29) following each and any vaccination in the groups HPV only, HPV+co_ad 
and Co_ad only for 9 year old subjects. 
 
The occurrence, intensity and relationship to vaccination of NOCDs, NOADs, medically significant 
AEs and SAEs in the groups HPV only, HPV+co_ad and Co_ad only for 9 year old subjects up to 
Month 7. 
Study cohorts 
In addition to the ATP cohort, a complementary analysis was conducted on the total vaccinated cohort 
(TVC) which included all vaccinated subjects for whom data concerning immunogenicity endpoint 
measures were available. The TVC included all vaccinated subjects for whom data were available. The 
TVC for analysis of immunogenicity included vaccinated subjects for whom data concerning 
immunogenicity endpoint measures were available. The TVC analysis was performed per treatment 
actually administered. 
Derived and transformed data 
A seronegative subject was a subject whose antibody titres were below the cut-off value. A 
seropositive subject was a subject whose antibody titre was greater than or equal to the cut-off value. 
Seroconversion was defined as the appearance of anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibodies (i.e. titre 
greater than or equal to the cut-off value) in the serum of subjects seronegative before vaccination. 
The GMT calculations were performed by taking the anti-log of the mean of the log antibody titers 
transformations. Antibody titers below the cut-off of the assay were given an arbitrary value of half the 
cut-off for the purpose of GMT calculation.

3.2.3.  Efficacy Study Results 
Immunogenicity 
Pooled study population 
For the pooled analysis, a total of 1663 subjects aged 9-25 years were included in the ATP cohort for 
immunogenicity. An overview about the numbers of subjects that were part of the different groups and 
age strata is provided in Table 1: 
Table 1.  Number of subjects per group and age strata (ATP cohort for immunogenicity) 
The mean age of all pooled 10-14 year old subjects at study entry in the ATP cohort for 
immunogenicity was 12.1 years with a SD of 1.41 years. The majority (92.6%) of the subjects was of 
White-Caucasian/European heritage. The mean age, race, height and weight were comparable between 
the 10-14 year old subjects in the different vaccine groups. 
The mean age of all pooled 15-25 year old subjects at study entry in the ATP cohort for 
immunogenicity was 17.4 years with a SD of 3.20 years. The majority (97.2%) of the subjects was of 
White-Caucasian/European heritage. The mean age is slightly different between the three groups as 
the pooled 15-25 age strata in the HPV+co_ad and the Co_ad only groups only contain 15 year old 
subjects of studies HPV-029 and HPV-030 which enrolled subjects 9-15 years. The pooled 15-25 age 
strata of the HPV only group has a mean age of 18.5 years with a SD of 3.30 years as it included 
subjects from study HPV-048. The race, height and weight were comparable between the 15-25 year 
old subjects in the different vaccine groups. 
The percentage of initially seronegative 9 year old subjects in the HPV only and HPV+co_ad groups 
with anti-HPV-16 titres ≥ 8 EL.U/mL and anti-HPV-16 GMTs are presented in Table 2. The percentage 
of initially seronegative subjects in the HPV only and the HPV+co_ad groups with anti-HPV-18 antibody 
titres ≥ 7 EL.U/mL and anti-HPV-18 GMTs are presented in Table 3.

Non-inferiority assessment between HPV only and HPV with coadministration for HPV-16 and HPV-18 
antigens for 9 year old subjects 
Non-inferiority of the pooled HPV only group to the pooled HPV+co_ad group with respect to the GMT 
ratio for 9 year old subjects was demonstrated for HPV-16 and HPV-18 since the UL of the 95% CIs on 
the GMT ratio was below the pre-defined limit of 2 (Table 4).

3.2.4.  Efficacy Conclusions 
Non-inferiority of the HPV-16/18 immune response, with respect to GMT ratio at Month 7, was 
demonstrated for the 9 year old subjects when Cervarix was administered alone at Month 0, 1 and 6, 
compared to when Cervarix was co-administered with Engerix or Twinrix at Month 0, 1 and 6. 
The pooling of these two groups of subjects increased the number of evaluable subjects for further 
analyses. 
For the pooled 9 year old subjects who received Cervarix with or without co-administration with 
Engerix or Twinrix, GMTs for anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibodies at Month 7 were the following: 
GMTs results for anti-HPV-16 antibodies at Month 7 were 29534.9 EL.U/mL in the HPV_pool/9y group, 
21152.2 EL.U/mL in the HPV_pool/10-14y group and 11926.2 EL.U/mL in the HPV_pool/15-25y group. 
GMTs for anti-HPV-16 antibodies at Month 7 in the HPV_pool/9y group were 1.4- fold higher than in 
the HPV_pool/10-14y group and 2.5-fold higher than in the HPV_pool/15-25y group. 
GMTs results for anti-HPV-18 antibodies at Month 7 were 11838.2 EL.U/mL in the HPV_pool/9y group, 
8608.0 EL.U/mL in the HPV_pool/10-14y group and 4905.3 EL.U/mL in the HPV_pool/15-25y group. 
GMTs for anti-HPV-18 antibodies at Month 7 in the HPV_pool/9y group were 1.4- fold higher than in 
the HPV_pool/10-14y group and 2.4-fold higher than in the HPV_pool/15-25y group. 
The immunogenicity objectives of this pooled analysis were met: 
Non-inferiority of the HPV-16/18 immune response, with respect to GMT ratio at Month 7, was 
demonstrated for the pooled 9 year old subjects (when Cervarix was administered alone or co- 
administered with Engerix or Twinrix), compared to the pooled 10-14 year old subjects (when Cervarix 
was administered alone or co-administered with Engerix or Twinrix). 
Non-inferiority of the HPV-16/18 immune response, with respect to GMT ratio at Month 7, was 
demonstrated for the pooled 9 year old subjects (when Cervarix was administered alone or co-
administered with Engerix or Twinrix), compared to the pooled 15-25 year old subjects (when Cervarix 
was administered alone or co-administered with Engerix or Twinrix). 
Assessment report  
Page 15/22
 
 
 
 
   
 
In conclusion, these data show that the 9 year old subjects are comparable to subjects aged 10-14 and 
15-25 years of age in terms of seroconversion rates and that the immunological response (GMTs) in 9 
year old subjects is non-inferior to the immune response in those older age groups. 
3.2.5.  Clinical safety 
In the pooled analysis, a total of 516 subjects aged 9 years were included in the Total Vaccinated 
Cohort. Of these, 175 subjects received 3 doses of Cervarix only, 171 received 3 doses of Cervarix co-
administered with HAB or HepB vaccines, and 170 received three doses of HAB or HepB only. 
Common Adverse Events 
The incidence and nature of symptoms (solicited only) reported during the 7-day (Days 0-6) post-
vaccination period following each dose and overall is presented in Table 9. 
Table 9.  Incidence and nature of symptoms (solicited only) reported during the 7-day (Days 0-6) 
post-vaccination period following each dose and overall for 9 year old subjects (Total vaccinated cohort) 
The overall percentage of doses followed by grade 3 solicited symptoms during the 7-day post-
vaccination period was 9.9%, 15.9% and 4.0% for the HPV only group, the HPV+co_ad group and the 
Co_ad only group, respectively (Table 10).

(Total vaccinated cohort) 
Solicited Local symptoms 
During the 7-day post-vaccination period, pain was the most frequently reported solicited local 
symptom in all groups overall per dose. Pain at the injection site was reported following 78.2%, 86.5% 
and 50.2% of doses in the HPV only, HPV+co_ad and Co_ad only group, respectively. 
Redness and swelling were reported more often for the HPV only and HPV+co_ad group than for the 
Co_ad only group. Redness was reported after 40.3%, 48.6% and 15.4% of the doses at the injection 
site for groups HPV only, HPV+co_ad and Co_ad only, respectively. 
Swelling was reported after 32.5%, 42.6% and 11.3% of the doses in the HPV only group, HPV+co_ad 
group and the Co_ad only group, respectively. 
An increase in the incidence in the reporting of swelling was observed with subsequent doses for the 
groups HPV only and HPV+co_ad. For group HPV only the reported swelling increased from 26.6% 
following Dose 1 to 42.0% following Dose 3. For group HPV+co_ad the reported swelling increased 
from 34.3% following Dose 1 to 51.8% following Dose 3. 
Grade 3 pain was reported after 4.3% of the doses at the injection site in the HPV only group versus 
9.8% of doses in the HPV+co_ad group and only 0.4% of the doses in the Co_ad only group. 
Grade 3 redness was reported after 2.1% of the doses in the HPV only group, 2.8% in the HPV+co_ad 
group and 0.2% in the Co_ad only group. Grade 3 swelling was reported more often for groups HPV 
only and HPV+co_ad than for the Co_ad only group with an overall incidence no more than 3.2%. The 
majority of solicited local symptoms resolved within two days and the majority of grade 3 local 
symptoms resolved within one day.

An increase in the incidence of swelling was observed with subsequent doses for the groups HPV only 
and HPV+co_ad. The majority of solicited local symptoms resolved within two days and the majority of 
grade 3 local symptoms resolved within one day. 
Solicited General symptoms 
The most commonly reported solicited general symptom in all groups was fatigue; with a frequency of 
21.2% in the HPV only group and of 26.3% in the HPV+co_ad group. For the Co_ad only group fatigue 
was similar to the HPV only group (21.9%). For all other solicited general symptoms, the incidences 
were within the same range across groups except for myalgia which was less pronounced in the Co_ad 
only group. No increase in solicited general symptoms was observed with subsequent doses. 
The rate of reported solicited grade 3 general symptoms was low and within the same range across 
groups. Solicited grade 3 symptoms were reported after no more than 1.8% of doses for any individual 
symptom. The majority of solicited grade 3 general symptoms were considered related to the 
vaccination by the investigator. Most solicited general symptoms resolved within two days. The 
majority of grade 3 general symptoms resolved within one day. 
Unsolicited symptoms 
There are no major differences between the groups in terms of the number of subjects reporting at 
least one unsolicited symptom within the 30-day post-vaccination period and the number of unsolicited 
symptoms reported. 
Medically significant adverse events 
During the entire study period, 60 subjects (17 in the HPV only group [9.7%], 16 in the HPV+co_ad 
group [9.4%] and 27 in the Co_ad only group [15.9%]) reported 71 medically significant adverse 
events classified by MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and Preferred Term. 
New onset chronic diseases and new onset of autoimmune diseases 
Six subjects reported the occurrence of a symptom classified as a new onset of chronic disease (NOCD) 
based on GSK assessment, as shown in Table 13. There were two subjects in each group with two 
cases of urticaria in the HPV group, one case of hypoaesthesia and one case of atopic dermatitis in the 
HPV+co_ad group and one case of allergic cough and one case of allergic rhinitis in the Co_ad only 
group. None of the NOCDs were classified as SAEs and none were assessed as possibly related to 
vaccination by the investigator (see individual CSR provided in Module 5 for investigator’s 
assessment). The incidence of reported new onset of chronic disease was within the same range in 
each group. None of the reported AEs was identified as a potential new onset of autoimmune disease 
(NOAD) (Company assessment).

Serious Adverse Events 
Fatal Events: none  
Non-Fatal SAE 
Two subjects reported two non-fatal SAE during the study in the 30-day post-vaccination period. One 
non-fatal event occurred in the HPV+co_ad group and one in the Co_ad only group. None of the non-
fatal SAEs were considered by the investigator to be related to the study vaccination.  
3.2.6.  Safety Conclusions 
The safety analysis of the 9 year old subjects from this pooled analysis of studies HPV- 029, HPV-030 
and HPV-048 did not show any clinically relevant differences between the different pooled vaccine 
groups. The rates of solicited local symptoms in the groups HPV only and HPV+co_ad tend to be higher 
when compared to the Co_ad only group. 
However, the symptoms were generally of short duration and compliance was high. 
The study vaccine administered in all three groups (either Cervarix alone (HPV only), Cervarix 
concomitantly with Engerix or Twinrix (HPV+co_ad) or Engerix or Twinrix alone (Co_ad only) was 
generally well tolerated. There were no new or unexpected safety issues following vaccination in any 
vaccine group. 
3.3.  Changes to the product information  
The detailed changes can be found in the final approved highlighted SmPC, Annex II and PL attached 
to this report.

Further to the assessment and the scientific discussions held at the CHMP, the following changes to the 
Product Information were requested by the CHMP and implemented:  
1) 
Section 4.1: The following revision was endorsed  
“Cervarix is a vaccine for use from the age of 9 years for the prevention of premalignant cervical 
lesions and cervical cancer causally related to certain oncogenic Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types. 
See sections 4.4 and 5.1 for important information on the data that support this indication.”  
2) 
Section 4.2: The following revision was endorsed: 
Paediatric population 
“Cervarix is not recommended for use in girls below 9 years of age due to lack of data on safety and 
immunogenicity in this age-group.” 
3) 
Section 5.1: Immunogenicity data were updated. 
3.4.  Overall conclusions and benefit-risk assessment 
In conclusion, non-inferiority of the HPV-16/18 immune response, with respect to GMT ratio at Month 
7, was demonstrated for the pooled 9 year old subjects compared to the pooled 10-14 year old 
subjects and to the pooled 15-25 year old subjects.  
These data showed that 9 year old subjects are comparable to subjects 10-14 and 15-25 years of age 
in terms of seroconversion rates and that the immunological response (GMTs) in 9 year old subjects is 
non-inferior to the immune response in those older age groups. No clinically relevant differences in the 
safety profile of the 9 year old subjects who received Cervarix alone or in co-administration with 
Engerix or Twinrix were observed. 
Based on the safety and immunogenicity data in this pooled analysis the CHMP concluded that the 
risk/benefit balance for Cervarix is favourable to extend the indication to 9 years and adopted the 
opinion of extending its use to subjects 9 years of age. 
4.  Conclusion 
On 20 October 2011 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the 
amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet.

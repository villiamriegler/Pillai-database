1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

SmPC, Annex 
SmPC new text 
To update section 4.2 of the SmPC to exclude re-
administration if surgery is delayed by less than 12 
hours.  
To update section 4.4 of the SmPC to add a warning 
(false positive and false negative fluorescence) 
following an analysis of the MAHs safety database.

Veterinary Medicinal Products - Other variation

II, Labelling 
If the surgery is delayed by more than 12 hours, surgery 
and PL 
should be re-scheduled for the next day or later. Another 
dose of this medicine can be taken 2 – 4 hours before 
anaesthesia. 
False negative and false positive results may occur with the 
use of 5-ALA for intraoperative visualisation of malignant 
glioma. Non-fluorescing tissue in the surgical field does not 
rule out the presence of tumour in patients with glioma. On 
the other hand, fluorescence may be seen in areas of 
abnormal brain tissue (such as reactive astrocytes, atypical 
cells), necrotic tissue, inflammation, infections (such as 
fungal or bacterial infections and abscesses), CNS 
lymphoma or metastases from other tumour types.

on the basis of a re-evaluation of the benefit risk balance, 
and PL 
the CHMP is of the opinion that the quality, safety and 
efficacy of this medicinal product continues to be 
adequately and sufficiently demonstrated and therefore 
considered that the benefit risk profile of Gliolan continues 
to be favourable. 
The CHMP is also of the opinion that the renewal can be 
granted with unlimited validity.

1.  Introduction 
This report covers the following post-authorisation commitments undertaken by the MAH: 
Study  D2560C00007  –  a  Phase  3  Open-label  Study  to  Evaluate  the  Safety  of  MEDI3250  in 
Healthy Japanese Children aged 2 years through 6 years.  
The rapporteur is of the opinion that the data do not support the requirement for a variation.

2.  Assessment of the post-authorisation measure P46 009 
This open label, single arm, multicentre study enrolled 100 subjects. The study was designed to gather 
the safety and tolerability data in Japanese children 2 to 6 years of age that would support approval of 
MEDI3250 (Fluenz Tetra /FluMist Quadrivalent) in Japan. 
For  children  age  2  years  through  6  years,  the  recommended  dosage  schedule  for  intranasal 
administration was 0.2 mL (0.1 mL per nostril). For children not previously vaccinated against seasonal 
influenza, a second dose was recommended to be given after an interval of at least 4 weeks.  
For the safety and tolerability endpoints, data were gathered on solicited symptoms, AEs and SAEs. 
The  study  was  conducted  at  3  sites  in  Japan  during  the  2014/2015  influenza  season.  Study  duration 
was 1 to 2 months for each participant.  No subjects withdrew  from  the  study  or  were  excluded from 
the safety population.

The  median  age  of  subjects  was  4.5  years  (mean  ±  standard  deviation  [SD]:  4.2  ±  1.4)  and  male 
subjects accounted for 45.0% (45 subjects). Ninety four subjects who had been previously vaccinated 
for  seasonal  influenza  received  one  dose  of  the  IP,  and  the  remaining  6  subjects  who  had  not  been 
previously  vaccinated  for  influenza  received  2  doses  of  the  IP  with  at  least  a  28  day-  interval.  A 
protocol  deviation  was  reported  in  one  subject  with  a  GCP  violation.  No  other  protocol  deviations  or 
inappropriate treatment compliance including overdose were noted during the study. 
The overall incidence of any solicited symptoms was 57.0% (57/100 subjects). The common solicited 
symptoms  (≥  5%)  were  runny/stuffy  nose  (51.0%),  cough  (35.0%),  fever  ≥  38.0°C  (11.0%),  sore 
throat (10.0%) and headache (5.0%).  
42 out of 100 of subjects (42%) experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAEs) 
after the first dose, and 2 out of 6 subjects (33.3%) after the second dose. 
The common TEAEs (≥ 4%) reported during  the  study were nasopharyngitis  (13.0%), gastroenteritis 
(4.0%),  pharyngitis  (4.0%),  and  dry  skin  (4.0%).  No  new  TEAEs,  by  preferred  term,  were  observed 
after the second dose. All TEAEs were graded as mild in severity. No deaths, SAEs or TEAEs leading to 
IP discontinuation were reported. 
MAH’s Conclusion 
No novel safety signals were detected in this small study conducted in 100 Japanese children 2 through 
6 years of age and the vaccine was safe and well tolerated. These data support the continued positive 
benefit/risk assessment for Fluenz Tetra. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion 
Regarding the study, the Rapporteur notes that:  
  The size of the sample permits to identify AEs with an incidence > 2.5% with a probability of ≥ 
90%;  
  AEs  solicited  in  the  study  are  already  rated  in  the  SmPC  to  be  common  or  very  common. 
However, the frequency of AEs was not compared to the same frequency measured in similar 
studies.  It  is  thus  not  possible  to  determine  whether  the  reactogenicity  during  2014/2015 
season  in  the  Japanese  population  was  higher  than  the  reactogenicity  in  other  seasons  or  in

other  populations.  It  is  also  not  possible  to  confirm  that  other  events,  such  as  asthma  or 
wheezing, are not more frequent than expected in the study population.  
In consequence, although results are reassuring, no significant information is gained from this study.  
The Rapporteur has no additional question to the MAH. No additional action is required.

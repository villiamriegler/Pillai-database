Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev1 (lutetium (177lu) chloride) 
An overview of Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev and why it is authorised in the 
EU 
What is Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev and what is it used for? 
Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev is a solution containing a radioactive form of lutetium (177lu) that is 
used for radiolabelling other medicines. Radiolabelling is a technique where a substance is labelled with 
a radioactive compound. Once the substance is radiolabelled with Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev, it 
then carries the radioactivity to where it is needed in the body (for example, the site of a tumour). 
 Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev is used to radiolabel medicines that have been specifically developed 
for use with lutetium (177lu) chloride. 
 Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev contains the active substance lutetium (177lu) chloride.  
How is Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev used? 
Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev is only to be used by specialists who have experience in radiolabelling.  
Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev is never given directly to a patient. Radiolabelling of a medicine takes 
place in a laboratory setting. The radiolabelled medicine is then given to the patient according to the 
instructions in that medicine’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC). 
How does Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev work? 
The active substance in Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev, lutetium (177lu) chloride, is a radioactive 
compound that emits mainly a type of radiation known as ‘beta-minus’, for treatment, and a small 
amount of gamma radiation, for imaging. When a medicine is radiolabelled with Lutetium (177Lu) 
chloride Billev, the medicine will carry the radiation to the particular site or type of cell in the body that 
is targeted by the medicine.

What benefits of Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev have been shown in 
studies? 
The company presented information from published clinical studies on the potential uses of Lutetium 
(177Lu) chloride Billev. Some of the data presented showed the usefulness of 177Lu in radiolabelling 
medicines for treating neuroendocrine tumors and prostate cancer, used together with imaging 
techniques to detect the site and spread of tumours. 
What are the risks associated with Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev? 
The side effects with Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev depend largely on the medicine it has been used 
to radiolabel and will be described in that medicine’s package leaflet. Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev 
itself is radioactive and so its use in radiolabelling may carry a risk of developing cancer and hereditary 
defects. The doctor will ensure that the risks linked to the radioactive exposure are lower than the risks 
from the disease itself.  
The most common side effects (which may affect more than 1 in 10 people) are anaemia (low red 
blood cell counts), thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet counts), leucopenia (low white blood cell 
counts), lymphopenia (low levels of lymphocytes, a particular type of white blood cell), nausea (feeling 
sick), vomiting and hair loss.  
 Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev must not be given directly to any patient. It must not be used in 
women who are known to be or may be pregnant, and when pregnancy has not been ruled out. For the 
full list of restrictions of Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev, see the package leaflet. 
Information on the restrictions on the use of medicines radiolabelled with Lutetium (177Lu) chloride 
Billev can be found in the respective package leaflets. 
Why is Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev authorised in the EU? 
The European Medicines Agency decided that Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev’s benefits for 
radiolabelling medicines are greater than its risks and it can be authorised for use in the EU. Given the 
well-known risks linked to radiation exposure, the Agency concluded Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev is 
only to be used if justified by the likely medical benefit.  
What measures are being taken to ensure the safe and effective use of 
Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev? 
Recommendations and precautions to be followed by healthcare professionals and patients for the safe 
and effective use of Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev have been included in the summary of product 
characteristics and the package leaflet. 
As for all medicines, data on the use of Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev are continuously monitored. 
Suspected side effects reported with Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev are carefully evaluated and any 
necessary action taken to protect patients.

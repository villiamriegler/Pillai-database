1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Janssen-Cilag International NV submitted on 29 April 2021 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Carvykti, through the centralised procedure 
falling within the Article 3(1) and point 1a of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to 
the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 28 March 2019  
Carvykti was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/20/2252.on 28 February 2020 in the 
following condition: Treatment of multiple myeloma. 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan 
Medicinal Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Carvykti as an orphan medicinal product in the 
approved indication. More information on the COMP’s review can be found in the Orphan maintenance 
assessment report published under the ‘Assessment history’ tab on the Agency’s website:  
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/Carvykti 
The applicant applied for the following indication:  
CARVYKTI is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, 
who have received at least three prior therapies, including a proteasome inhibitor, an 
immunomodulatory agent and an anti-CD38 antibody. 
1.2.  Legal basis and dossier content  
The legal basis for this application refers to: 
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated 
that ciltacabtagene autoleucel was considered to be a new active substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies) 
1.3.  Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0353/2019 on the granting of a (product-specific) waiver.  
1.4.  Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
1.4.1.  Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products.

Page 6/146 
 
 
 
1.5.  Applicant’s request(s) for consideration 
1.5.1.  Conditional marketing authorisation and accelerated assessment 
The applicant applied initially for a full marketing authorisation, but during the assessment, in response 
to CAT and CHMP concerns on the comprehensiveness of the data, requested consideration of its 
application for a conditional marketing authorisation in accordance with Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) 
No 726/2004. 
The applicant requested accelerated assessment in accordance to Article 14(9) of the same Regulation. 
1.5.2.  New active substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance ciltacabtagene autoleucel contained in the above 
medicinal product to be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
1.5.3.  Scientific recommendation on classification 
The applicant Janssen-Cilag International NV submitted on 4 May 2018 an application for Scientific 
recommendation on Classification to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Carvykti, which was 
designated as an Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 
1394/2007on 5 July 2018. Carvykti was classified as a gene therapy medicinal product. 
1.6.  PRIME 
Carvykti was granted eligibility to PRIME on 28 March 2019 in the following indication: treatment of 
adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, whose prior regimens included a 
proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent and an anti-CD38 antibody and who had disease 
progression on the last regimen. 
Eligibility to PRIME was granted at the time in view of the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
For patients that are not eligible for ASCT and have progressed following standard therapies 
(proteasome inhibitor (PI), anti-CD38 and immunomodulatory agent (iMID)), the prognosis is 
poor and there are few treatment options. Hence, the unmet medical need has been agreed.  
The non-clinical data has shown proof of principle in in vitro MM cell lines and in vivo models 
where a dose-dependent anti-tumour activity and prolongation of survival was demonstrated in 
nude mice.  
In the first phase 1 single arm trial CAR T cells in patients with relapsed/refractory MM (Legend 
-2), ORR for the total population was 87.8%, with 64% CR and 56.8% MRD negative, VGPR 
was 10.8%, PR was 12.2%, CR (64%) and ORR (87.8%) in patients that had relapsed 
following IMiDs and PI treatment. The estimated duration of response was 14.32 months 
(95%CI: 10.35, NE) and PFS was 14.85 months. In the one patient that was heavily pretreated 
and received anti-CD38 daratumumab, the patient achieved CR with MRD negativity.  
The magnitude of the effect seems convincing if compared with historical data and the data 
robust enough to demonstrate a compelling effect on efficacy in terms of ORR. Based on the 
mechanism of action, it could be cautiously possible to extrapolate the clinical efficacy to 
patients that have been previously heavily pretreated, depending on their prognostic factors.  
Therefore, it is considered that this product could potentially fulfil the criteria for PRIME 
Assessment report

eligibility and address the unmet medical need in patients that have been previously heavily 
pretreated with chemotherapy, mAb (anti-CD38), PI and/or IMiDs and hence, has the potential 
to be of major therapeutic advantage over current treatment options.  
Upon granting of eligibility to PRIME, Jan Mueller-Berghaus was appointed by the CHMP as rapporteur. 
A kick-off meeting was held on 19 June 2019. The objective of the meeting was to discuss the 
development programme and regulatory strategy for the product. The applicant was recommended to 
address the following key issues through relevant regulatory procedures: 
•  CMC: The EMA recommended that the lentiviral comparability plan should be included in a 
Scientific Advice request. EMA also recommended that the characterisation testing for both 
lentiviral vector and drug product should be included in a Scientific Advice request to ensure 
appropriate release specifications. Furthermore, a Scientific Advice request should be 
considered in order to clarify the exemption from batch release testing in the EU due to e,g., 
limited amount of material available or the short shelf life (GMP for ATMPs 11.27) of JNJ-
68284528. 
•  Non-clinical: To follow up on the potential cross-reactivity between JNJ-68284528 and claudin 
9, the Sponsor should consider cross-reactivity to other members of the claudin gene family. 
In addition, the acceptability of the follow up plan should be included as a separate question in 
the upcoming Scientific Advice request. In said request, the plan to validate/invalidate the 
binding of JNJ-68284528 to claudin 9, the clinical consequences of this potential off-target 
cross reactivity and its appropriate monitoring should be discussed. 
•  Clinical: The proposed clinical data package (~100 patients/single arm study) was considered 
limited in the context of a full marketing authorisation. The planned six months follow-up 
foreseen was also considered limited to sufficiently characterize the progression-free survival 
and durable response of JNJ-68284528. The EMA recommended that Janssen consider 
submitting the planned clinical pharmacology modelling to Scientific Advice prior to a 
marketing authorisation application and discuss the comparative evidence strategy including 
data sources.  
In the context, the applicant was invited to provide the statistical analysis plan for real world 
evidence, once available. 
•  Regulatory: In the context of the product-specific waiver EMA recommended to have further 
discussions with PDCO to identify the extent to which BCMA targeted CAR-T cells could be 
efficacious in other malignancies. 
• 
EMA recommended that an orphan designation should be filed as soon as possible in order to 
hold conversations with Janssen regarding the maintenance of the orphan designation and 
similarity exercise. Furthermore, EMA recommended that Janssen characterize the molecular 
structural features of the lentiviral vector more fully (not just the features of the CAR) during 
the similarity assessment against authorised orphan drugs in multiple myeloma and discuss 
this aspect in a Scientific Advice. 
• 
Post authorisation studies: EMA recommended early planning for development of an 
appropriate protocol for registries.  Early engagement with EBMT, as well as inclusion of EBMT 
representatives could be considered for participation in future Scientific Advice. 
1.7.  Scientific advice and protocol assistance

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Claimed therapeutic indication 
“CARVYKTI is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple 
myeloma, who have received at least three prior therapies, including a proteasome inhibitor, an 
immunomodulatory agent and an anti-CD38 antibody”. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a rare and incurable plasma cell neoplasm which typically affects adults 
mostly over 60 years of age. The median age at diagnosis is 65–70 years; MM is very rare in patients 
younger than 40 years old (2% of cases). 
MM accounts for 1%-1.8% of all cancers and is the second most common haematological malignancy 
(after non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma [NHL]) with an estimated incidence in Europe of 4.5-6/100 000/year, 
with approximately 176.404 new MM cases and 117,077 deaths due to MM anticipated in 2020 
worldwide (The Global Cancer Observatory 2020).  
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Multiple Myeloma is characterised by the increased proliferation of malignant monoclonal plasma cells 
in the bone marrow, with the subsequent bone marrow failure due to replacement of normal bone 
marrow haematopoiesis, the over-production of monoclonal immunoglobulins (M-protein, either intact 
immunoglobulins and/or free light chains [FLC]) which could be detected in the serum or urine, and

finally the presence of systemic symptoms named as CRAB (hyperCalcaemia, Renal impairment, 
Anaemia and Bone lesions). Increased susceptibility to infections (immunoparesis) and neurological 
complications are also present (Palumbo 2011). 
Based on karyotype, MM is classified as non-hyperdiploid and hyperdiploid, with the latter accounting 
for 50% to 60% of cases and characterised by trisomies in odd-numbered chromosomes. MM has a 
heterogeneous progression pathway, with multiple relapses over time, whereby several MM cell 
subclones coexist at baseline and compete for dominance over time, leading to the evolution of drug-
resistance clones [Laubach, 2014].  
Drug resistance to prior regimens in patients with relapsed/refractory (RR) MM is due to continuous 
changes in the disease biology, in which a higher proportion of malignant cells are expressing a more 
aggressive, highly proliferative phenotype over time (Anderson, 2008). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Multiple myeloma, a malignant disorder of the plasma cells characterised by uncontrolled and 
progressive proliferation of a plasma cell clone, and accounts for approximately 10% of haematological 
malignancies (Rodriguez-Abreu 2007; Rajkumar 2011). The proliferation of the malignant clonal 
plasma cells leads to subsequent replacement of normal bone marrow haematopoietic precursors and 
overproduction of monoclonal paraproteins (M-proteins). Characteristic hallmarks of multiple myeloma 
include osteolytic lesions, anaemia, increased susceptibility to infections, hypercalcaemia, renal 
insufficiency or failure, and neurological complications (Palumbo 2011). Profound intratumoural 
heterogeneity is observed throughout the disease course but is especially problematic after multiple 
lines of treatment. The coexistence of different tumour subclones displaying different drug sensitivities 
contributes to both progression of disease and development of drug resistance (Barlogie 2014). 
The criteria for diagnosis of MM as defined by the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG), 
requires 10% clonal BM plasma cells or biopsy proven bony or extra-medullary plasmacytoma and 
evidence of end organ damage that can be attributed to the underlying plasma cell proliferative 
disorder, or biomarkers of malignancy (60% clonal BM plasma cells or involved/uninvolved serum-free 
light chain ratio >100 or > 1 focal lesion on magnetic resonance imaging studies). 
The course of MM is characterised by a period of disease control after initial therapy followed by 
progression, typically with subsequently shorter periods of response and relapse with each successive 
therapy (Moreau, 2017). The treatment of MM has notably progressed with the availability of new 
drugs and its combinations, such way that survival of patients with newly diagnosed MM has increased 
from approximately 3 years in the years 1985 to 1998 (Kyle 2003) to 6 to 10 years (Moreau 2015) 
along the last 15 years. Despite the significant improvement in patients’ survival over the past 20 
years, only 10%-15% of patients achieve or exceed expected survival compared with the matched 
general population. 
The estimated 5-year survival rate for patients with multiple myeloma is approximately 54% 
(Cancer.net 2020). With each successive relapse, symptoms return, quality of life worsens, and the 
chance and duration of response typically decreases. Therefore, there remains a significant and critical 
unmet need for new therapeutic options directed at alternative mechanisms of action that can better 
control the disease; provide deeper, more sustained responses; and yield better long-term outcomes 
including maintenance of HRQoL. 
Despite advance in therapy, MM remains incurable. Although autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) 
has extended survival in newly diagnosed MM, practically all patients eventually relapse, and with each 
successive relapse, the chance of response and duration of response typically decreases and ultimately

the disease becomes refractory and results in cumulative end organ damage (e.g., renal, cytopenias, 
infections and bone complications). 
2.1.5.  Management 
The treatment landscape for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) has changed in recent 
years. Current treatment of MM includes glucocorticoids, chemotherapy, primarily alkylating agents, 
high dose chemotherapy followed by ASCT, proteasome inhibitors (PIs, such as bortezomib, carfilzomib 
and ixazomib), immunomodulatory agents (such as thalidomide, lenalidomide and pomalidomide), 
monoclonal antibodies ((mAbs), such as daratumumab, isatuximab and elotuzumab) and the histone 
deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat. Common standard regimens include either a PI or an IMiD in 
combination with dexamethasone with or without a monoclonal antibody such as daratumumab. The 
triplet combination of bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (VRd) is a standard of 
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) treatment 
guidelines (NCCN 2020 and Moreau 2017). Newer classes of medications including XPO1 inhibitors 
(selinexor) and antibody drug conjugates targeting BCMA (belantamab mafodotin-blmf) have recently 
been approved by the US food and drug administration (FDA), but have limited therapeutic activity and 
substantial toxicity. 
The choice of therapy in the relapse setting depends on several parameters such as age, performance 
status, comorbidities, the type, efficacy and tolerance of the previous treatment, the number of prior 
treatment lines, the available remaining treatment options, the interval since the last therapy and the 
type of relapse (i.e. clinical versus biochemical relapse; in the case of biochemical relapse, treatment 
can be delayed). 
Despite multiple therapeutic options, multiple myeloma remains incurable. All patients eventually 
relapse and become refractory to existing treatments. Median OS in patients who have received at 
least three prior multiple myeloma lines of therapy and are refractory to both an IMiD and a PI is only 
13 months (Kumar 2017). The reported ORR for approved therapies for the population of heavily pre-
treated and refractory patients with multiple myeloma, is approximately 30% (Table 1).

Table 1. 
Comparison of Efficacy of Therapies for the Treatment of Heavily Pre-treated 
Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma 
In a recently published chart review, investigators from 14 academic institutions analyzed 275 patients 
to determine the efficacy of subsequent treatments after disease progression on an anti-CD38 
monoclonal antibody treatment (Gandhi 2019). This multicentre, retrospective, observational study 
investigated the natural history and outcomes of patients with multiple myeloma refractory to CD38 
monoclonal antibodies (MAMMOTH study). Patients were heavily pre-treated with a median of 4 prior 
lines of therapy (range: 1-16). Regardless of the particular salvage regimen chosen, the observed 
efficacy of the next treatment after progression on PI, IMiD, and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody 
therapy was dismal. The median OS for the entire cohort was 8.6 months (95% [CI]: 7.5-9.9), ranging 
from 5.6 months for penta-refractory patients (refractory to anti-CD38 antibody, 2 PIs, and 2 IMiDs) to 
11.2 months for patients not simultaneously refractory to an IMiD and PI. Among patients who 
received ≥1 subsequent treatment after becoming refractory to anti-CD38 antibody therapy (90% of 
patients in the study), the response rate averaged 31%, with a median PFS and median OS of 3.4 
months and 9.3 months, respectively. The median OS for patients who received no further treatment 
was 1.3 months. The results of the MAMMOTH study were derived from real-world data and support 
the lack of options for patients who had prior exposure to a PI, IMiD, and anti-CD38 monoclonal 
antibody therapy. Despite new therapeutic achievements with novel mechanisms of action, multiple 
myeloma remains an incurable disease in which all patients eventually relapse. There remains an 
unmet medical need for new treatment options beyond the current classes of anti-myeloma therapy. 
B-cell maturation antigen, also known as CD269 and TNFRSF17, is a 20 kilodalton, type III membrane 
protein that is part of the tumour necrosis receptor superfamily. BCMA is predominantly expressed in 
B-lineage cells and plays a critical role in B-cell maturation and subsequent differentiation into plasma 
cells (Tai 2015). B-cell maturation antigen binds 2 ligands that induce B cell proliferation: a 
proliferation-inducing ligand ([APRIL]; CD256) and B-cell activating factor (BAFF; CD257) (Avery 
2003; Darce 2007; Patel 2004). Binding of BCMA monomers to the APRIL trimer triggers activation and 
phosphorylation of p38MAPK, ELK, and NF-κB through intracellular tumour necrosis factor receptor 
associated factor molecules leading to pro-survival gene regulation (Bossen 2006; Hsi 2008; Korde 
2011). Comparative studies have shown a lack of BCMA in most normal tissues and absence of

expression on CD34-positive haematopoietic stem cells (Carpenter 2013; Kimberley 2009). This 
selective expression and the biological importance for the proliferation and survival of myeloma cells 
makes BCMA a promising target for the treatment of multiple myeloma. 
Belantamab mafodotin-blmf is a humanised IgG1κ monoclonal antibody conjugated with a cytotoxic 
agent, maleimidocaproyl monomethyl auristatin F (mcMMAF) that binds to BCMA on myeloma cell 
surfaces causing cell cycle arrest and inducing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Belantamab 
mafodotin-blmf was recently approved on the basis of the Phase 2, open-label DREAMM-2 study 
designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of belantamab mafodotin monotherapy in patients with 
RRMM who had 4 or more prior lines of treatment, were refractory to a PI, an IMiD, and had failed 
treatment with an anti-CD38 antibody. The ORR of DREAMM-2 as assessed by IRC was 32% (97.5% 
CI: 20.8, 42.6). The achieved responses were deep, with more than half of responders (60%) 
achieving VGPR or better (Lonial 2020). 
Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy uses modified autologous T cells that are activated in 
a major histocompatibility complex independent manner upon binding to their target resulting in the 
lysis of the targeted cells. Immunotherapy using CAR-T technology to target the BCMA receptor has 
emerged as a highly promising therapy for patients with advanced multiple myeloma who have 
exhausted available therapies such as PI, IMiD, and CD38 monoclonal antibodies. 
Early data for idecabtagene vicleucel, a BCMA-directed CAR-T immunotherapy, indicated that BCMA 
CAR-T therapy could lead to an ORR of approximately 85%, a complete response (CR) rate of 45%, 
and median PFS of 11.8 months (Raje 2019). Of the 128 subjects who were infused with idecabtagene 
vicleucel, the ORR was 73.4% for all doses tested and 82% for subjects treated with 450 x 106 CAR-
positive T cells or higher. The rate of CR/sCR was 31%. The median PFS was 8.6 months. Eighty-four 
percent of the subjects experienced cytokine release syndrome that was generally mild (Munshi 2020). 
Most recently, data for idecabtagene vicleucel showed an ORR of approximately 73%, CR rate of 33%, 
a median PFS of 8.8 months, a median DoR of 10.7 months, and a median OS of 19.4 months (Munshi 
2021). On 18 August 2021, idecabtagene vicleucel received EMA conditional approval for the treatment 
of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least three prior 
therapies, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor and an anti-CD38 antibody 
and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. 
Overall, there is an unmet medical need for more treatment options capable of achieving deep and 
durable responses that afford the opportunity for treatment-free intervals and improved quality of life 
(QoL) for patients with RR MM who have received ≥ 3 prior therapies, including an immunomodulatory 
agent, a PI, and an anti-CD38 mAb. 
2.2.  About the product 
Ciltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta-cel) consists of autologous T cells genetically modified to express a 
chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) utilizing a lentiviral vector (LV). The target antigen of the CAR is 
BCMA, which is expressed on malignant plasma cells. The LV coding sequence is comprised of a human 
CD8 alpha signal peptide (CD8α SP), BCMA targeting single-domain antibodies (VHH1 and VHH2) 
designed to confer avidity, human CD8 alpha hinge and transmembrane domain (CD8α hinge+TM), 
human CD137 cytoplasmic domain (4-1BB), and a human CD3 zeta cytoplasmic domain (CD3ζ). The 
expression of the LV is driven/controlled by a human elongation factor 1 alpha promoter (hEF1α 
promoter). 
Cilta-cel is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma 
who have received at least three prior therapies, including a proteasome inhibitor, an 
immunomodulatory agent, and an anti-CD38 antibody. Cilta-cel is to be administered in a single 
Assessment report

infusion at a target dose of 0.75 x 106 CAR-positive viable T cells/kg (range: Patients 100 kg and 
below: 0.5 - 1.0 x 106 CAR-positive viable T cells/kg body weight. Patients above 100 kg: 0.5 - 1.0 x 
108 CAR-positive viable T cells (non-weight based). 
Upon binding to BCMA expressing cells which are primarily represented by late-stage B cells, plasma 
cells, and malignant B-lineage cells, the CAR promotes T-cell activation, expansion, and elimination of 
target cells.  
2.3.  Type of application and aspects on development 
Carvykti has been granted PRIME eligibility. 
Clinical development programme  
The clinical development programme for cilta-cel consists of one Phase-1 study (LEGEND-2) one Phase 
1b-2 study (MMY2001-CARTITUDE-1), one Phase 2 (MMY2002-CARTIFAN-1), one multicohort Phase 2 
study (MMY2003-CARTITUDE-2), one Phase 3 randomised study (MMY3002-CARTITUDE-4) and one 
long term (for up to 15 years) safety follow up study (68284528MMY4002). 
The clinical development plan for cilta-cel in the treatment of multiple myeloma is outlined in the 
following figure 1.

Accelerated assessment  
The CHMP and CAT agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on the potential of Carvykti to address 
an unmet need and to provide a valuable further treatment option for patients suffering from relapsed 
or refractory MM. For this patient population Carvykti thus may represent a therapeutic advantage over 
available treatment options. However, during the assessment, a GMP inspection and provision of a 
GMP certificate were considered necessary which did not allow maintenance of the accelerated 
assessment timetable.  
Conditional Marketing Authorisation (applicant claim) 
In light of the concerns raised during assessment on the comprehensiveness of the data set the 
applicant requested consideration of its application for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation in 
accordance with Article 14-a of the above-mentioned Regulation, based on the following criteria: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive in a patient population consistent with the CARTITUDE-1 
study. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data by post approval 
measures as described below: 
−  CARTITUDE-1 (MMY2001): A Phase 1b/2, open-label, multicentre study to evaluate the safety 
and efficacy of JNJ 68284528 in adult subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma 
(due date 31 December 2022) 
−  CARTITUDE-4 (MMY3002): A Phase 3 randomised study comparing JNJ-68284528, a CAR-T 
therapy directed against BCMA vs PVd or DPd in subjects with relapsed and lenalidomide-
refractory multiple myeloma (due date 31 December 2026). 
• 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as: 
−  Although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the EU, 
all patients with this disease will eventually relapse after initial response and require further 
therapy. Newer agents with novel therapeutic strategies that effectively target relevant and 
specific molecules on the surface of multiple myeloma cells benefit patients with 
relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma to improve and deepen ORR and prolong PFS and OS. 
Therefore, the applicant considers that cilta-cel addresses an unmet medical need for those 
affected by the condition. 
−  Major therapeutic advantage over pomalidomide, lenalidomide, bortezomib, carfilzomib, 
ixazomib, daratumumab, isatuximab, elotuzumab, and panobinostat has been established via 
the documentation of a favorable response (ORR) with ciltacabtagene autoleucel treatment in 
patients who had previously failed treatment containing these agents. 
−  Major therapeutic advantage over idecabtagene vicleucel, belantamab mafodotin, selinexor, 
and melphalan flufenamide has been established via indirect methods comparing ORR, CR, 
and PFS outcomes. Patients treated with cilta cel were more likely to show a favorable 
response (ORR, CR) and extended survival without disease progression (PFS) compared to 
patients treated with idecabtagene vicleucel, belantamab mafodotin, selinexor, and melphalan 
flufenamide. 
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required.  
−  With respect to public health, when patients have exhausted the most common classes of 
Assessment report  
EMA/594558/2022  
Page 18/146 
 
 
 
agents used in this setting (PIs, IMiDs, Anti-CD38 Abs), a highly efficacious, one-time 
treatment, is the best available option for the patient compared to all other existing therapies.  
−  For these reasons, making cilta-cel available to patients with relapsed or refractory multiple 
myeloma now is justified with the understanding that more efficacy and safety results from 
the CARTITUDE-1 and CARTITUDE-4 studies will be provided in due course. 
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Carvykti is presented as a dispersion for infusion containing 3.2 x 106 to 1 x 108 CAR-positive viable T 
cells of ciltacabtagene autoleucel as active substance. The other ingredient is the cryoprotectant 
Cryostor® CS5 which contains dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The product is available in ethylene vinyl 
acetate (EVA) 30 mL or 70 mL infusion bags with sealed addition tube and two available spike ports. 
Each infusion bag is packed in an aluminium cryo cassette. 
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
The section on the active substance is separated into two parts; part 1 for the lentiviral vector (starting 
materials) and part 2 for the transduced cells (active substance). 
Part 1: Lentiviral Vector starting material 
Lentiviral vector - General Information  
The lentiviral vector is a third-generation HIV-1-derived replication-incompetent and self-inactivating 
(SIN) vector pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G). The vector genome 
encodes the B cell maturation antigen (BCMA, also known as CD269 and TNFRSF17) specific CAR under 
the control of a human EF1α promotor. The CAR is comprised of a human CD8α signal peptide, llama-
derived single domain antibodies (VHH1 and VHH2) specific for recognizing BCMA antigen followed by a 
human CD8α hinge and transmembrane domain that is fused to the T cell cytoplasmic signalling 
domains of 4-1BB and CD3ζ. The packaged vector RNA encodes no viral genes. The LV is a critical 
starting material used to transduce the autologous T cells to manufacture cilta-cel. 
Lentiviral vector – Manufacture and process controls 
The LV is manufactured in a 70stage manufacturing process consisting of upstream and downstream 
steps. The upstream manufacturing process starts with thaw and preculture of a single WCB (working 
cell bank) vial in a shake flask followed by serial cell expansions in shake flasks and finally transfer to a 
culture bag. Subsequently, cells are harvested, transferred into bioreactors and transfected with the 
vector genome carrying transfer plasmid and three packaging and helper plasmids the harvest is 
pooled and clarified followed by a sterile filtration. Concerning the downstream manufacturing process, 
the LV undergoes a series of purification steps and finally, the purified bulk LV is filled into vials and 
stored frozen. Overall, the manufacturing process of the LV is adequately described.  
The LV is manufactured in compliance with GMP and manufacturing licenses have been provided for 
the different manufacturing and test sites.  
Assessment report  
EMA/594558/2022  
Page 19/146 
 
 
 
IPCs, PPs, and CPPs including acceptance criteria, proven acceptable ranges or operating ranges have 
been defined. The applicant differentiates between IPCs with an acceptance criterion and IPCs with a 
predefined instruction. IPCs with an acceptance criterion are controls to assess parameters at an in-
process sampling location and covers tests for safety. IPCs with predefined instructions are controls 
that may be used during routine manufacturing Acceptance criteria of the existing IPCs have been 
sufficiently justified. To identify the CPPs, each PP was evaluated for its potential effect on CQAs 
considering the degree of knowledge uncertainty.  
PARs have been justified based on one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) studies, design of experiment (DOE) 
studies and validation studies. In order to confirm the PARs, statistical consideration as well as 
extrapolated criteria have been used. These extrapolated criteria were derived from retrospective 
analysis of process characterisation data and represent limits that are expected at the respective 
manufacturing stage to produce LV, which meets LV release specification after further downstream 
processing. Furthermore, some process parameters controlled within an operating range have been 
justified based on manufacturing experience. CQAs have been defined based on the severity of their 
impact to patient safety as well as finished product efficacy, the degree of knowledge uncertainty for 
severity and regulatory expectations.  
The LV manufacturing process contains seven process intermediates whose hold conditions were 
evaluated to confirm their biochemical stability at the proposed hold time and temperature. Overall, 
the provided data support the proposed hold conditions of the process parameters. A cumulative 
extended hold study has also been performed.  
Lentiviral vector – Control of Materials 
The applicant provided a tabulated overview for all compendial and non-compendial materials. For the 
non-compendial materials test methods and acceptance criteria have been specified. A two-tiered cell 
banking system has been generated to ensure continuous supply of the vector production cell line. The 
overall testing strategy for the cells banks is adequately described. The applicant accepted a 
recommendation to qualify and perform an additional identity test on the WCB. Suitable stability 
programs for the MCB and WCB have been provided and the preparation of future WCBs has been 
described.  
The LV is manufactured by transient transfection using a 3rd generation packaging system comprising a 
transfer plasmid encoding the CAR transgene and three helper plasmids Development history, plasmid 
maps, manufacturing process for plasmid MCBs and plasmid DNAs, release specifications, summary of 
methods used to control the plasmids, and stability testing have been described. Stability data are 
presented supporting the proposed shelf life when stored frozen at the recommended storage 
condition. The applicant committed to implement recommendations related to the cell bank 
specification used to manufacture the plasmids.  
Lentiviral vector - Process validation  
For process validation of the commercial LV manufacturing process, commercial scale batches were 
manufactured and evaluated for CPPs, IPCs and release specifications. Moreover, data have been 
provided confirming the capability of the manufacturing process to consistently remove process-related 
impurities including those derived from media, buffers and process additives. Results of several further 
parameters that are not analysed routinely during commercial manufacturing has been additionally 
provided for these three validation batches as part of process characterisation. Generally, these data 
support consistent manufacturing. Some process parameters had been controlled during validation but 
are not controlled at the commercial process which has been sufficiently justified by the applicant. The 
applicant´s approach for the validation studies for the mixing equipment is considered acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/594558/2022  
Page 20/146 
 
 
 
Initial validation and routine revalidation of aseptic manufacturing deems in accordance with the 
requirements. To provide on-going assurance that the process remains in a state of control during 
commercial manufacture, continuous process verification that includes monitoring of release tests, 
IPCs and PPs is planned. The proposed programme on continuous process verification is considered 
acceptable.  
Adequate shipping qualification data has been provided. Qualification programme of future LV shipping 
systems has been sufficiently described and a temperature logger is used for shipment.  
Lentiviral vector – Manufacturing process development 
The initial changes implemented to the plasmids were designed to increase the safety of the vector.  
This included changing from a 2nd/3rd generation LV construct used in the First-in-Human study to a 3rd 
generation LV packaging system. During further clinical development, the antibiotic resistance gene of 
the plasmids was changed to further improve patient safety. To increase manufacturing capacity for 
clinical and commercial demands further changes were introduced late in development leading to the 
commercial process. 
Several studies were conducted to support comparability of the respective LV products from the 
different designs, processes and sites.  
Initially a Major Objection was raised in view of the observed differences for some CQAs and the low 
number of batches used for the comparability exercise even though more batches had been 
manufactured. Comparability of the clinical and commercial processes was not considered confirmed 
The applicant subsequently provided further data and statistical analysis to support the comparability 
assessment. This included justification for differences observed which were not expected to have a 
significant impact on the efficacy and safety of the final CAR-T finished product which was accepted. 
Lentiviral vector – Characterisation  
Characterisation of the lentiviral vector was performed during development and release of the lentiviral 
vector. The characterisation tests are performed for a more detailed understanding of the LV for 
process monitoring purposes. The assays were used to confirm the full vector sequence and integrity of 
the integrated proviral sequence in transduced T-cells together with additional analysis of LV 
composition.  Respective characterisation tests have been described by the applicant.  
All impurities are controlled at batch release and their removal has been analysed during process 
validation. Recommendations were made for the applicant to continue characterisation of the LV. 
Lentiviral vector - Specifications, analytical procedures, reference standards, batch analysis, and 
container closure  
Release specifications cover tests for safety, potency, identity, genomic integrity, quantity, general 
characteristics, and purity and are in line with the expectations given in Ph. Eur. 5.14. Acceptance 
criteria are considered sufficiently justified. 
The analytical procedures used for release testing of the LV have been adequately described. Validation 
of the non-compendial analytical procedures are generally in line with ICH Q2(R1) and compendial 
methods have been verified as appropriate. System suitability requirements have been described for 
each analytical procedure. For analytical procedures performed at different sites, co-validation have 
been performed and equivalence analysed.  
Batch data was provided from commercial batches and representative clinical batches including details 
such as manufacturing site, manufacturing date, scale and use. The analytical procedures used for 
release control have been provided. In general, the provided batch data support consistent

manufacturing of LV. Recommendations were made for the applicant continue to characterise 
appropriate reference materials to support LV. 
The primary container closure system is a preassembled, single use vial and stopper which is received 
ready to use. The container closure components meet the requirements for the corresponding Ph. Eur. 
monographs and container closure integrity was demonstrated. Leachable and extractable studies were 
performed.  
Lentiviral vector - Stability 
Long term stability studies are ongoing on multiple batches including those manufactured using the 
commercial process and supportive lots manufactured by the clinical manufacturing process considered 
representative of the commercial process. Test methods used for the stability study are a subset of 
those used for release testing which is in line with the expectations. Acceptance criteria are the same 
as for release.  
During review a concern was raised regarding the availability of data to support the shelf-life claim in 
line with the requirements of ICH Q1A_R2. In response the applicant provided predictive estimates to 
further support the shelf-life claim which was accepted. The applicant committed to provide additional 
stability data (meeting acceptance criteria to further support the assigned shelf life once available  
A post-approval stability programme was submitted and is considered adequate. 
Part 2: CAR-T active substance 
2.4.2.1.  General information 
Ciltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta-cel) is an engineered autologous T cell immunotherapy by which a 
patient´s own T cells are harvested and engineered ex vivo by lentiviral transduction of a chimeric 
antigen receptor (CAR) construct encoding an anti-BCMA CAR, which consists of two llama-derived 
single domain antibodies fused to CD137 (4-1BB) and CD3ζ intracellular signalling domains. The 
applicant has provided sufficient information concerning the CAR domains, architecture and function. 
Cilta-cel was designed to bind specifically to cells expressing BCMA and induce BCMA-dependent, CAR-
T mediated cytolysis.  
2.4.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The ciltacabtagene autoleucel finished product (FP) manufacturing process is a continuous process. 
First, fresh autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) procured by apheresis are 
cryopreserved centrally (Germany) or locally at cryopreservation sites spatially associated with the 
apheresis centres.   
Next the cryopreserved PBMCs are shipped to the AS (Active substance) and FP manufacturing site 
Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc, 1000 Route 202 South Raritan, New Jersey 08869, USA. A major 
objection was raised due to the lack of valid EU GMP certificate and an inspection took place during 
assessment and a certificate issued. Batch certification to the EU market is performed by Janssen 
Biologics, Leiden, The Netherlands and a valid MIA was provided. 
Upon cryopreservation, the frozen cell material is transported to the commercial AS/FP where 
manufacture of the final FP is continued in a 5-stage continuous manufacturing process. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/594558/2022  
Page 22/146 
 
 
 
manufacture starts with the acceptance and thawing of the apheresis material and T cell enrichment. 
Enriched T cells are then activated and transduced with LV and cells are expanded. At the end of the 
culture period cells are harvested, washed and cryopreserved.  
Manufacture and control of the FP have been sufficiently described and a continuous flow-scheme with 
all manufacturing and unit operations, hold-steps (intermediates) as well as IPCs/PPs/CPPs (in-process 
controls/ process parameters /critical process parameters) has been indicated. IPCs, PPs, and CPPs 
including acceptance criteria, proven acceptable ranges or operating ranges have been defined, 
justified and are deemed appropriate to assure sufficient process control. 
To provide justification to the proposed PARs (proven acceptable ranges), OFAT and/or DoE studies 
have been performed using healthy donor (HD) and/or surplus patient apheresis material in a qualified 
reduced-scale (RSM) model.  
Acceptance criteria used for the establishment of PARs during development studies are based on 
clinical assay specification at the time of study execution, which also meet the commercial 
specification. Hence, it is assured that specification compliant finished product can be manufactured at 
conditions that represent the PAR extremities. 
Control of materials 
Apheresis starting material 
Patient material is collected at apheresis sites assessed by the applicant according to FACT, JACIE and 
EBMT standards and in accordance with Directives 2004/23/EC, 2002/98/EC and 2006/17/EC. 
Acceptance criteria have been established for procured patient material, which is considered acceptable 
to not exclude patients, whose apheresis may not meet existing release criteria but may give rise to a 
successfully manufactured product. 
After procurement at the apheresis site, the fresh apheresis material is transported to cryopreservation 
facilities for formulation and cryopreservation. Hold time data supporting the transport and defined 
cryopreservation processes have been provided and are based on clinical manufacturing experience. 
Upon receipt at the cryopreservation facility the cell count is adjusted to an appropriate target range 
for formulation into cryopreservation media based on historical patient data as well as CPC 
(cryopreservation centre) and FP manufacturing capabilities Overall, the apheresis formulation and 
cryopreservation process has been adequately described. 
PARs have been proposed for relevant PPs in process characterisation studies for the impact on key 
process performance post-thaw attributes, such as cell counts, viability and cell phenotype.  
Concerning the control of materials used for apheresis formulation and cryopreservation, an impact 
assessment of the patient apheresis material and the cryoprotectant on pre-defined critical apheresis 
quality attributes has been provided.  
To lend support to the established apheresis starting material control strategy, information was 
compiled on multiple cryopreserved patient apheresis batches manufactured across several CPC sites, 
with regards to quality of apheresis as measured by process performance attributes (PPAs) Data 
presented suggests an overall robust manufacture of apheresis starting material using the established 
process across the involved CPC sites.  
Thermal shipper qualification and distribution studies have been performed that demonstrate the 
suitability of the transportation of fresh apheresis material to the cryopreservation sites within the EU.

Compendial and non-compendial raw materials 
The applicant provided a tabulated overview for all compendial and non-compendial materials including 
product-contacting consumables. For the non-compendial materials, acceptance criteria for test 
methods that are performed in addition to the testing performed by the vendor according to their 
certificates of analysis (CoAs) have been specified. Reference to the respective monographs (USP, JP 
and Ph. Eur.) has been provided for the compendial raw materials. The manufacturers of the raw 
materials and product-contacting consumables have been specified. Confirmation has been provided by 
the applicant that internal procedures do not require verification of compendial test methods.  
More information on raw human/animal derive materials can be found in the Adventitious agents 
section below. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
A comprehensive overview of critical in-process controls and critical in-process tests performed 
throughout the cita-cel active substance manufacturing process is given.  
CPPs and final FPs CQAs have been identified using a risk-based approach, taking into account the 
potential impact on safety and efficacy as well as the degree of knowledge uncertainty. Hold conditions 
for all AS/FP process intermediates have been qualified in a cumulative hold study for compliance with 
established IPCs, CPPs and FP release specifications. 
Process validation 
For process validation of the commercial AS/FP manufacturing process consecutive commercial scale 
batches were manufactured using multiple lots of cellular starting material and LV. 
All PV batches manufactured were within the specified acceptance limits for all PPs/CPPs and IPCs for 
apheresis thaw and T cell enrichment, T cell activation, T cell transduction and expansion, T cell 
harvest and wash manufacturing step and the final formulation, fill and cryopreservation.  Any results 
not in compliance with the release specifications were justified by the applicant and subject to 
corrective actions as appropriate These data supported by further data from multiple clinical batches 
manufactured at the commercial FP facility, suggest that the commercial process is consistently 
delivering a FP of defined quality, lending substantial support towards a successfully validated 
commercial manufacturing process.  
Process performance attributes (PPAs) have been defined for process stages 1-5, iAlert limits have 
been established for some but not all PPAs to indicate potential drift from clinical experience, Adequate 
justification has been provided for those parameters for which no alert limits are foreseen.  
It is noted that the applicant has made adjustment to IPCs and process parameters post-validation. 
While the changes to the IPCs are considered minor or improve the overall process, some of the 
process parameters for the commercial process are widened in contrast to the process validation 
ranges, and are supported by process development studies. Although performed after formal process 
validation, this was considered to be acceptable. 
Studies to qualify hold conditions for all process intermediate hold steps have been performed for the 
commercial manufacturing process challenging the maximum pre-defined hold-times for each 
intermediate (cumulative hold times). The presented FP release data are compliant with established FP 
release specifications, demonstrating that under worst-case hold conditions, FP of sufficient quality can 
be manufactured.  
Electronic and paper-based systems have been implemented to control, review, track and record the 
patient CoI/CoC (Chain of Identity / Chain of Custody). Validation data has been presented for both 
systems demonstrating their capability to ensure bidirectional tracking of cells contained in Carvykti in

accordance with provisions contained in the Guidelines on Good Manufacturing Practice specific to 
Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products.  
Risks to FP and/or patients safety stemming from polymeric materials used for apheresis, 
cryopreservation as well as LV and FP manufacture have been assessed in a risk analysis Apheresis 
centres are qualified by JACIE/EBMT standards using appropriately qualified materials for patient 
material procurement. 
The applicant´s control strategy to assure control of the final FP´s QAs is deemed overall well in 
agreement with the provisions contained in ICH Q11.  
Final FP CQAs have been identified using a risk-based approach, taking into account the potential 
impact on safety and efficacy as well as the degree of knowledge uncertainty  
To provide sufficient control to raw and starting materials as well as consumables entering the 
manufacturing process, the applicant confirmed that raw materials are controlled according to the 
provisions provided in Guidelines on Good Manufacturing Practice Specific to Advanced Therapy 
Medicinal Products and Ph. Eur. 5.2.12. Raw materials are produced in compliance with applicable GMP 
and controlled through routine release at least for identity, sterility and endotoxin. Raw materials have 
been assigned to risk categories and the underlying risk factors associated with the material, the 
vendor and/or utilisation of the material within the process justified.  
IPCs implemented to control for manufacturing consistency and final FP quality, together with their 
respective action or acceptance limits have been summarised. Action/acceptance limits have been 
justified based on available process development data and/or manufacturing experience. 
Process- and product-related impurities introduced during the AS/FP manufacturing process have been 
categorised during development regarding criticality in a risk assessment by calculating the safety 
margin separating the theoretical exposure limit from the predetermined safety level.  
Robust and sufficient depletion of critical process- and product-related impurities has been 
demonstrated for a sufficient number of patient batches using the commercial manufacturing process. 
Manufacturing process development 
Concerning manufacturing history, tabular summaries of process changes introduced during process 
development have been provided together with the rationales for changes. Commercial production will 
be performed at Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Raritan, USA. 
Changes to the AS/FP manufacturing process and site of manufacture have been introduced through 
clinical development.  
changes have also been made to the apheresis or LV starting materials used for FP manufacturing. 
To address the impact of changes implemented during development, a series of process development 
and formal comparability studies have been conducted, which were designed to demonstrate 
comparable process performance and FP quality after the changes were implemented. 
Common to all studies is parallel manufacturing using split-apheresis of variable number of healthy 
and/or patient apheresis lots, which was endorsed. In-process data as well as final FP release and 
characterisation data have been gathered for the individual study arms and assessed with regard to 
compliance with established in-process and/or release criteria, historical data (where established) and 
similarity based on side-by-side comparisons. Although the presented data appear to suggest some 
degree of comparability of the FP, it is noted however, that the applicant has not been able to define 
clear comparability criteria, based on which an unbiased decision on comparability of pre- and post-
change FP can be made. Due to unavailability of meaningful comparability criteria, comparability of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/594558/2022  
Page 25/146 
 
 
 
different vector starting materials and FP manufacturing processes is being assessed following a 
scientific approach based on the available in-process and release data. Hence, no further comparability 
criteria are requested. 
Changes to the analytical methods used for FP release testing have been summarised and are for the 
most part deemed minor with respect to assay comparability throughout development.  
In conclusion based on the information available, FP comparability for the different sites and vector 
starting materials could not be conclusively demonstrated. However, the presentation of further 
comparability data is not deemed to be required to resolve this issue as differences in batch release 
data from the different manufacturing processes should be clinically evaluated, when taking into 
account the autologous nature of the therapy and the characteristics of living cells which are expanding 
in vivo and are altering their therapeutic potential depending on tumour cell abundance as CAR-T cell 
stimulus. The applicant has further agreed to reconfirm to provide safety and efficacy updates on 
commercial-LV-treated patients, after marketing authorisation, as part of the ongoing clinical 
development of cilta-cel in study MMY2003, cohort A (2Q 2023) and study MMY3002. 
Characterisation 
Final FP batches manufactured by the commercial manufacturing process have been analysed for 
lymphocyte composition, T cell phenotype and in-vitro effector function. Batches investigated displayed 
a substantial uniformity with regard to T cell purity/lymphocyte composition.  
The effector function of FP has been studied in-vitro in co-culture experiments, suggesting BCMA-
specific cytokine induction and T cell proliferation.  
See also discussion on impurities in the process validation section above. 
The potential presence of nitrosamine impurities has been evaluated considering the raw materials and 
excipients used as well as the clearance capability of the manufacturing process. Based on the risk 
evaluation provided, a low likelihood for presence of nitrosamine impurities is concluded. 
2.4.2.3.  Specification 
Manufacture  of  Carvykti  is  a  continuous  process  and  thus,  the  respective  information  is  provided  in 
section (Finished medicinal product) below. 
2.4.2.4.  Stability 
Manufacture  of  Carvykti  is  a  continuous  process  and  thus,  the  respective  information  is  provided  in 
section (Finished medicinal product) below. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Carvykti FP is composed of CD3-positive T cells that have been transduced by a lentiviral vector 
encoding a CAR for BCMA, formulated with a cryoprotectant containing 5% DMSO. The finished product 
consists of 3.2 x 10e6 - 1 × 10e8 CAR+ viable cells which are formulated in either 30 mL or 70 mL 
CryoStor CS5 freezing medium depending on the total viable cell count. The target dose has been 
indicated as 0.75 x 10e6 CAR+ viable T cells/kg patient weight with a specification range of 0.5 – 1.0 x 
Assessment report  
EMA/594558/2022  
Page 26/146 
 
 
 
 
10e6 CAR+ viable T cells/kg patient weight for patients weighing 100.0 kg or below. The FP target 
dose for patients weighing above 100.0 kg is 0.75 x 10e8 CAR+ viable T cells with a specification 
range of 0.5 – 1.0 x 10e8 CAR+ viable T cells. The dose specification is set as a range to allow for 
variability during the formulation / fill finish process. 
The target dose is calculated based on the CAR+ expression percentage, patient weight, total viable 
cell concentration and bag volume.  
The only excipient used in the formulation of the finished product is CryoStor CS5, which is a 
cryoprotectant and cell stabilizer.  
Depending on the final volume, the final product is either filled in a 30 mL (50 mL bag) or 70 mL (250 
mL freezing bag. Samples for release testing are filled in 1 mL cryovials. Equivalence of both bag sizes 
and the cryovials has been addressed using healthy donor material including provision of Stability data 
This approach is considered acceptable. 
The suitability of the container closure system including discussion of extractables and leachables has 
been demonstrated. 
Pharmaceutical development activities included an evaluation of FP stability under accelerated 
conditions and use of FP from patients or healthy donors. In-use stability and FP compatibility were 
demonstrated up to 3.5 hrs when stored at RT in a bracketing approach using healthy donor apheresis 
material manufactured with the commercially-representative manufacturing process in-use study have 
been provided and generally support an in-use shelf life of 2.5 hrs as per the SmPC: “The medicinal 
product should be administered immediately after thawing and the infusion should be completed within 
2.5 hours of thawing”. 
The applicant committed to perform further in use stability study to assess additional quality attributes 
the intended in-use time of 2.5 hrs. 
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
As the manufacturing process is considered to be continuous, the complete manufacturing process and 
the involved manufacturing and test sites are described in the drug substance part. 
For shipment of the finished product, a qualification study, a real-time transportation study and a 
finished product simulated transport study using apheresis material as surrogate, shipped under worst-
case long-term transit conditions, have been performed.  The shipper is qualified to maintain 
temperature A temperature logger is used in every FP shipment. 
2.4.3.1.  Product specification 
Since the manufacturing process from receipt of the apheresis starting material to final product is 
continuous and no active substance is isolated, it is considered acceptable that specifications have only 
been defined for the finished product. The FP specifications include tests for appearance, identity, 
viability, quantity, safety and potency. The testing time point and kind of testing sample been indicated 
for each method. A recommendation was made for the applicant to provide further data demonstrating 
the representativeness of testing in process samples for a subset of the release tests. 
FP specifications were derived from multiple batches manufactured at the commercial manufacturing 
site that met the release specification. Most quantitative FP attributes were evaluated with a statistical 
approach. An exemption of retesting upon importation was requested and justified by the insufficient 
volume available for retesting. The strategy is in line with the Guideline on good manufacturing 
Assessment report  
EMA/594558/2022  
Page 27/146 
 
 
 
 
practice specific to Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products, 11.17 and the Q&A document on the 
exemption from batch controls carried out on ATMPs imported into the European Union from a third 
country (EMA/354272/2019) and is accepted. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines.    
A description and summary of validation as well as complete validation reports has been provided for 
each analytical procedure. System suitability requirements have been described for each assay. For 
test performed at different sites, co-validations have been performed using the same test material. 
A Major Objection was raised regarding the suitability of the proposed potency test (tumour killing).  
Further information was provided by the applicant in response but as there were several remaining 
concerns with regard to the commercial tumour killing assay the applicant proposed to replace it with 
an IFN-γ secretion assay as the commercial potency assay. The method has been adequately validated 
and a specification limit set based on statistical analysis of data from clinical batches available retains 
samples and clinical experience. With the introduction of the IFN-γ potency assay and associated data 
submitted the Major Objection was considered resolved. The applicant commits to re-evaluate the 
specification limit for the IFN-γ secretion assay following further manufacturing of commercial batches.  
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data for batches manufactured throughout development have been provided. Results for 
multiple batches were submitted covering the various manufacturing process versions including 
batches manufactured using the commercial LV. The majority of batches are within the specifications 
set at the time of production and comply also with the proposed commercial specifications. OOS 
batches and the respective OOS parameters were indicated.  
Container closure system 
The primary container closure system is commercially available and consists of CE marked ethylene 
vinyl acetate (EVA) 50 mL and 250 mL cryostorage bags specifically designed for storage of blood and 
blood components freezing bags are sterilised by gamma radiation.  
Reference materials 
The preparation and qualification of cells used as a positive control have been adequately described. 
2.4.3.1.  Stability of the product 
The applicant proposes a shelf life for the finished product of 9 months at ≤-120°C  
FP stability has been investigated using low and high concentrations of viable cells in long-term studies 
for storage at -120°C and in a temperature excursion study. The finished product lots used in primary 
and supportive stability studies are representative of the commercial process. For the process 
validation and commercial batches, 9-month data are currently available. The provided data support a 
FP shelf life of 9 months at ≤-120°C. 
Some deviations from the intended timepoints to the real testing timepoints in this study were 
apparent but have been appropriately justified. Omission of monthly testing for the first three months 
as required by ICH Q5C is justified by limited material availability. Currently, 9 months stability data 
are available for batches manufactured with the commercial process and no OOS results or trends have 
been observed, the data provided for the early time points are considered sufficient. 
Assessment report  
EMA/594558/2022  
Page 28/146 
 
 
 
No further batches are intended to be placed on stability. This is considered acceptable.  
2.4.3.2.  Post approval change management protocol 
The applicant has provided a post approval change management protocol in relation to the 
manufacturing production process of the LV and analytical methods used for the LV and finished 
product.  In general, this approach is considered acceptable.  
2.4.3.3.  Adventitious agents 
Donors of the T cells are of autologous origin, therefore, defined selection criteria with regard to CJD 
do not apply according to Directive 2006/17/EC. The manufacturing process of the lentiviral vector 
(LV) as well as of the T cells to manufacture ciltacabtagene autoleucel are both serum-free. 
Furthermore, both manufacturing processes are devoid of the usage of animal-derived materials. The 
cell bank used to manufacture the LV has also been produced without animal-derived materials, as 
these cells have been adapted to serum-free medium and to grow in suspension before generation of 
the cell banks.  
A number of materials of biological origin are used throughout the manufacturing process. 
Furthermore, Raw materials of animal or human origin are used in the manufacture of cilta-cel. The 
cryo-protectant medium is the only excipient and it is not of animal origin. TSE/BSE statements have 
been provided for all LV or ciltacabtagene autoleucel contact equipment. In summary, compliance with 
the TSE guideline for all raw materials has been sufficiently demonstrated and with EU directives for 
human derived materials. 
The autologous PBMCs are obtained from the patients by leukapheresis. Each patient/PBMC donor is 
tested according to EU guidelines 2002/98/EC, 2004/23/EC and their daughter directives as well as 
national and local guidelines, policies, and procedures. The testing procedure for a second apheresis, if 
needed, is also performed in compliance with Dir 2006/17/EC. Since HIV-positive patients are allowed 
for treatment with Carvykti, the risk of recombination and trans-complementation and thus 
reactivation of the LV in T cells derived from these patients has been discussed. Despite the fact that 
the risk cannot be finally excluded, there are several measures in place for risk minimisation, including 
the design of the LV and testing of the finished product for replication competent lentiviruses (RCL). 
Furthermore, there is a medical need for treating also HIV-positive patients with Carvykti and patients 
are advised to continue antiretroviral therapy following Carvykti treatment. Finally, due to the current 
missing experience with manufacturing Carvykti for patients testing positive for HIV, active HBV, or 
active HCV, the applicant will impose additional pharmacovigilance activities into the risk-management 
system for such patients as conditions to the marketing authorisation.  
The LV is produced by transient transfection. The cell line genealogy has been sufficiently described 
and the master cell bank (MCB), the working cell bank (WCB) as well as an End-of-production (EOP) 
cell bank have been generated and tested sufficiently for adventitious viruses according to Eur. Ph. 
5.2.3 and ICH Q5A. All tests failed to demonstrate the presence of any viral contaminant Study reports 
or certificates of analysis for all tests were provided. The testing strategy for any future WCBs has also 
been described and is found to be sufficient. The LV harvest will be tested routinely according to Eur. 
Ph. 5.14 and 2.6.16.  
No trypsin or bovine serum has been used for cell banking or is used in the LV manufacture. A fully 
established traceability system for plasma-derived products from individual donations to the plasma-
derived product via the ciltacabtagene autoleucel finished product and finally to the patient and vice 
versa is implemented. No other materials of human origin and no materials of animal origin are used in 
Assessment report  
EMA/594558/2022  
Page 29/146 
 
 
 
the LV and Carvykti T cell manufacturing processes. The only excipient is also not of animal or human 
origin.  
No adventitious virus testing is done on the finished product and no virus inactivation steps are 
implemented in the ciltacabtagene autoleucel manufacturing process due to the nature of the product 
which consists of living cells and which is in line with current guidelines. Virus safety, therefore, relies 
on the selection, qualification, testing and control of the starting and raw materials. In summary, virus 
safety of Carvykti has been demonstrated.  
In particular to the current Covid-19 pandemics, detailed risk assessments have been performed that 
demonstrate low contamination risk for LV and ciltacabtagene autoleucel finished product by SARS-
CoV-2.  
2.4.3.4.  GMO 
Environmental risk associated with cilta-cel is considered to be negligible. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
During the assessment, 3 Major Objections were raised related to lack of EU GMP certificate, 
comparability and potency assay. All of them were successfully addressed during assessment with 
some recommendations in place to address aspects not affecting the benefit-risk of this product. 
In general, Module 3 of the dossier is of an acceptable quality standard. The cilta-cel manufacturing 
process has been adequately described and process-parameters as well as in-process controls 
established to provide sufficient process control. Acceptable ranges have been justified based on 
relevant process development studies.  
Raw materials are overall appropriately controlled. Immediate starting material for cilta-cel 
manufacturing are the patient apheresis material and the LV to genetically modify the cells.  
The manufacturing process of the LV starting material is sufficiently described. During clinical 
development several changes have been introduced to the design of the LV, its manufacturing process 
and the site of manufacturing. Several studies were conducted to analyse comparability, which could 
not be fully established between the different vector processes (further information and 
recommendation below).  The applicant subsequently provided further data and statistical analysis to 
support the comparability assessment. This included justification for differences observed which were 
not expected to have a significant impact on the efficacy and safety of the final CAR-T finished product 
which was accepted. 
After procurement by apheresis, the cellular starting material is formulated and cryopreserved either at 
a central cryopreservation site or at local cryopreservation sites, which are spatially closely associated 
with the apheresis centres.  
The commercial AS/FP manufacturing process is considered sufficiently validated based on the 
available in-process and release data for clinical batches manufactured, which demonstrate consistent 
manufacture of specification-compliant final product.  
In the course of pharmaceutical and clinical development, several changes have been implemented to 
the AS/FP manufacturing process, the starting materials and the equipment. The impact of these 
changes on product quality and process performance has been assessed in a series of process 
development and formal comparability studies. Further evaluation will be pursued on a clinical level. 
For FP release the method for determination of potency has been changed from a tumour killing assay 
Assessment report  
EMA/594558/2022  
Page 30/146 
 
 
 
to an IFN-γ secretion assay, which is considered suitable assay. The commercial specification limit has 
been defined based on statistical analysis and clinical experience from retain samples.  
Some FP release tests are performed prior to cryopreservation. The applicant was therefore 
recommended to further demonstrate that the data obtained with material pre-formulation are 
indicative for the final product after cryopreservation  
The TSE and virus safety of cilta-cel has been sufficiently shown.  
Overall, based on the review of the data on quality, the marketing authorisation application for 
Carvykti is considered approvable from the quality point of view, taking into account the applicant’s 
commitments. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data have 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.4.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
The CAT/CHMP recommends some points for investigation as described above. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The nonclinical programme for cilta-cel comprises literature-based assessment of the BCMA expression 
profile, in vitro functional characterisation studies, in vivo pharmacology and safety studies, literature-
based evaluation of biodistribution, oncogenicity studies by Lentiviral vector (LVV) insertion site 
analysis, and in vitro safety studies by cytokine independent growth assay. 
During product development, the LVV has evolved. In the initial nonclinical studies, the second and 
third generation LV developed by Legend has been used. Later on, the third-generation LV Amp has 
been further developed. Final adaption of the LVV included replacement of the Amp resistance gene by 
the Kan resistance gene (LV Kan). Moreover, the LVV manufacturing process has been changed from 
using adherent to in suspension cell cultures. In the non-clinical package, CAR T cells from different LV 
manufacturing developmental stages have been used (refer to Section 2.4.2. ). In all cases, the CAR 
expressed by the CAR-T cells is identical.  
In nonclinical studies with cilta-cel, the drug product (test article) is identified as JNJ-68284528 for 
studies conducted or sponsored by Janssen and as CAR-T cells developed with the second/third 
generation hybrid or third generation LV for studies conducted or sponsored by Legend.

2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The presented in vitro and in vivo non-clinical primary pharmacodynamics data support expression of 
the BCMA CAR on transduced T-cells, specific activation of BCMA CAR T cells upon binding to the target 
BCMA antigen, and functional activity of the BCMA CAR T cells against target cells.  
In the in vitro and in vivo studies, BCMA CAR T cells have been used, which were generated by 
lentiviral transduction of T cells derived from both, healthy donors and MM patients. These data, 
together with characterisation data presented in the quality part of the dossier revealed cell viability, 
proliferation capacity, CAR T cell activation transduction efficiency, and potent cytotoxicity against 
BCMA-positive relevant target cells.  
For the cytotoxicity and cytokine release assays two different BCMA-positive cell lines have been used: 
Raji cells, which were shown to have a low expression level of BCMA, and RPMI8226 cells, which were 
shown to express BCMA at higher levels. The observed response of BCMA CAR T cells against Raji cells 
was of lower magnitude as compared to responses observed against RPMI8226 cells.  
In the in vivo proof-of concept studies, a multiple myeloma xenograft model of NCG mice was used.  
A single dose of 4x106 cilta-cel cell per mouse showed a statistically significant tumour inhibition and 
an increase in the survival of animals. In the dose-escalation study (2.46 x 104, 1.25 x 105, or 6.257 x 
105 CAR-positive cells per animal) dose-effect relationship was observed as well as CAR expansion and 
persistence demonstrated. 
In the in vitro studies BCMA-dependent CAR T cell activation and cytotoxicity have been demonstrated 
using CAR T cells manufactured with the second, second/third generation hybrid and third generation 
LV developed by Legend or using JNJ-68284528. Thereby, a comparable CAR T cell activation and 
cytotoxic potential has been demonstrated. In the in vivo dose-escalation study CAR-T cells 
manufactured with the second, second/third gen hybrid and third generation LV developed by Legend, 
respectively, were shown to have comparable anti-tumour activity. None of the pharmacology studies 
used JNJ-68284528 manufactured using the commercial manufacturing process. However, 
comparability data suggest that the anti-tumour activity of JNJ-68284528 manufactured using the 
commercial manufacturing process will not be reduced as compared to JNJ-68284528 manufactured 
using the same process as used for the in vitro study.    
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The absence of secondary pharmacodynamics studies is acceptable based on the nature of the product 
and the limitations of the available animal models. The restricted expression pattern of BCMA suggests 
on-target/off-tumour effects of cilta-cel on normal B cells. Such an on-target/off-tumour effect 
resulting in B-cell aplasia has been observed in the clinical study MMY2001.  
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
The applicant provided data, which shows that the LAB003-His, a recombinant protein containing the 
targeting domain, do not bind to mouse BCMA (data not shown). Therefore, the safety effects 
observed in mice would not be translatable to humans. The absence of safety pharmacology studies is 
therefore, acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/594558/2022  
Page 32/146 
 
 
 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Due to the lack of a pharmacologically relevant animal model for cilta-cel and the autologous nature of 
the cilta-cel product, the lack of pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies is acceptable. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
According to the regulatory guidance for gene therapy medicinal products (GTMPs) (Guideline on the 
quality, non-clinical and clinical aspects of gene therapy medicinal products, EMA/CAT/80183/2014), 
conventional pharmacokinetics studies evaluating ADME are not applicable to cilta-cel. Instead, it is 
acceptable to evaluate the in vivo persistence of cilta-cel, which depends on the dosing and the BCMA-
dependent activation and proliferation in vivo. Due to the lack of a pharmacologically relevant animal 
model, the applicant evaluated the persistence of CAR-T cells manufactured with second/third 
generation hybrid LV developed by Legend in the PD dose escalation study using NCG mice bearing 
BCMA-expressing tumour cells. A quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay was used for 
the quantification of CAR gene copy number in mouse whole blood samples collected as part of a 
primary pharmacology study that evaluated the efficacy, as well as expansion and persistence, of cilta-
cel following a single intravenous dose in a model of multiple myeloma with immune-deficient mice. 
This qPCR assay was developed for research use only. CAR gene copy number showed increases after 
Day 20 and peaked on Day 34, followed by decreases to baseline levels at study termination on Day 48 
(Figure 2). The control group (un-transduced T cells) did not demonstrate statistically significant 
increases in CAR gene copy number.

2.5.4.  Toxicology 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
The applicant performed one in vivo non-GLP toxicology pilot study in Cynomolgus monkeys using 
autologous CAR-T cells manufactured with the second/ third generation hybrid LV developed by 
Legend.  
Preparation of NHP Cilta-cel 
NHP cilta-cel was manufactured from autologous Cynomolgus monkey peripheral blood samples 
following a similar manufacturing method that would be used for human T cells. T cells were isolated 
from monkey peripheral blood samples and then pre-activated with a NHP T Cell Activation/Expansion 
Kit and human IL-2. The pre-activated T cells were transduced with the second/ third generation 
hybrid LV developed by Legend, followed by expansion for an additional 8 days. Frozen NHP cilta-cel 
was then administered to the animals. 
Study Design 
Three days prior to IV infusion of NHP cilta-cel, the 2 monkeys were pre-treated with 
cyclophosphamide at a single dose of 22.3 mg/kg body weight by IV injection to mimic patient pre-
conditioning. On the day of CAR-T treatment (Day 0), NHP cilta-cel was thawed in a 37°C water bath 
by gentle swirling and within 5 minutes administered by IV infusion. Animals were infused with all 
available cells present at the end of manufacturing; the percentage of CAR-positive cells was not 
determined. One male received 5 × 106 cells/kg, while the other male received 40 × 106 cells/kg. 
Neither T-cell viability, T-cell purity, nor the percent of T cells expressing the CAR was determined. In 
addition, neither proliferation nor persistence of the T cells postdose was evaluated. Both monkeys 
were monitored prior to dosing and for 30 days post infusion for body temperature (Days -3 and 0 to 
7, and then generally every 3 days), body weight (Days -3, 0, 3, 6, 19, and 30), and complete blood 
counts and serum chemistry (Days -13, -2, 3, 6, 19, and 30). 
Results 
Both animals survived to study completion on Day 30. There were no significant changes in body 
temperature or body weight. Transient and mild decreases in white blood cell, red blood cell, and 
hemoglobin counts in both animals and platelet count in 1 animal following NHP cilta-cel IV infusion 
were considered non-adverse. It is unclear if changes in complete blood counts were related to 
cyclophosphamide pretreatment or NHP cilta-cel because the study did not include cyclophosphamide 
only and/or vehicle control groups. 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
No repeat dose toxicity has been performed given there is no relevant nonclinical species and that 
cilta-cel is administered as a single dose to patients and is anticipated to undergo expansion and 
persistence following administration.  
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
No classical genotoxicity studies have been performed. However, integration studies have been carried 
out by shearing extension primer tag selection ligation-mediated PCR (S-EPTS/LM-PCR) and 
bioinformatics analysis including integration site analysis, diversity measurements, common integration 
site analysis, analysis of integration sites in proximity to cancer-related genes, and comparison of the 
Assessment report

vector integration profile with historical datasets.  A study has been performed using final drug product 
derived from 6 MM patients and 3 healthy donors. For analysis, different viral vectors, such as clinical 
LV or proposed commercial LV, were used for transduction. The results from the study demonstrate a 
high degree of polyclonality and an integration pattern typical for lentiviruses. Based on this study, the 
risk of insertional oncogenicity is expected to be very low (data not shown). In addition, clonal 
dominance might be regarded as an early step in the development of insertional oncogenesis and it is 
expected that additional steps are needed for T cell transformation.  
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies were not performed for cilta-cel. As indicated in the ICH S9 guidance, 
carcinogenicity studies are not warranted to support marketing for therapeutics intended to treat 
advanced cancer. In addition, cilta-cel is a human specific CAR-T cell product and lacks cross reactivity 
to mouse BCMA precluding the conduct of traditional rat and mouse bioassays. 
The lack of carcinogenicity studies is acceptable.  
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
No non-clinical reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have been conducted, which is 
acceptable based on the type of product and the BCMA expression pattern. In addition, no inadvertent 
germline transmission studies have been conducted. According to the Guideline on non-clinical testing 
for inadvertent germline transmission of gene transfer vectors, EMEA/273974/2005, this is acceptable.  
2.5.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
Not applicable. 
2.5.4.7.  Local tolerance  
Not applicable. 
2.5.4.8.  Other toxicity studies 
The applicant addressed the risk of on-target toxicity by a literature survey. Since literature data show 
that the expression of BCMA is highly restricted to B cells, on-target/off-tumour effects of cilta-cel on 
normal B cells are expected. Such an on-target/off-tumour effect resulting in B-cell aplasia or 
hypogammaglobulinaemia has been observed in the clinical study MMY2001. 
Potential off-target toxicity was investigated in two studies using CAR-T cells manufactured with the 
third generation LV developed by Legend or JNJ-68284528 in a human membrane surface protein 
array covering 4,955 or 5,647 full human membrane proteins. In the first study using CAR-T cells 
manufactured with third generation LV developed by Legend, none of the proteins presented in this 
array except BCMA were identified to interact with the CAR. However, in the later study using the CAR-
T manufactured by Janssen binding of the CAR was detected not only to BCMA but also to claudin-9 
(CLDN9). Although some members of the claudin family, such claudin-6 and claudin-4, show a high 
degree of homology with CLDN9 in the extracellular domain (ECD), no binding interaction was seen 
with other members of the claudin family. Amino acid sequence alignment of CLDN9 with BCMA 
identified 3 regions in CLDN9 with up to 55% sequence identity, one of which partially overlaps with 
Assessment report  
EMA/594558/2022  
Page 35/146 
 
 
 
the binding epitope in BCMA of cilta-cel. This overlapping region is even shared with CLDN6, CLDN4, 
and CLDN3, which nevertheless did not interact with cilta-cel. 
In subsequent orthogonal studies using FACS analysis, the applicant evaluated the binding of LAB003a 
recombinant protein containing the targeting domain or JNJ-68284528 to monocytes, dendritic cells, 
basophils, eosinophils, and neutrophils, all of which express CLDN9 endogenously, or cell lines 
exogenously expressing CLDN9. In addition, T, B, and NK cells have been analyzed for binding 
interaction to CLDN9, which do not express CLDN9. The data demonstrated that the binding domains 
in LAB003 and JNJ-68284528 bind only to cell lines that were engineered to express CLDN9 but do not 
interact with endogenously expressed CLDN9 on primary cells. The possible cause for the observed 
difference between endogenously and exogenously expressed CLDN9 is explained with reference to 
published studies showing that engineered protein overexpression can cause cellular defects which can 
result in overload of translation and folding, post-translational modifications (PTMs), and promiscuous 
protein-protein interactions (Andrell and Tate, 2013 Moriya 2015). 
Finally, in vitro studies were conducted to determine the potential for uncontrolled T cell proliferation 
after lentiviral transduction of T cells derived from 6 MM patients or 3 healthy donors. There was no 
evidence for IL-2 independent T cell proliferation after vector transduction when compared to 
untransduced T cells. The applicant demonstrated statistically significant mean differences in the 
proliferation of JNJ-68284528 (i) obtained from healthy donors or MM patients and (ii) generated with 
adherent or suspension LVV. These differences, however, were not considered relevant. This is agreed 
to based on (i) the low number of healthy donors included in the study and the different manufacturing 
processes used for production of the samples and (ii) the fact that a difference in proliferation has also 
been detected in donor matched untransduced T cells. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The risk for the environment in general and for transmission to third parties associated with the 
genetically modified T cells is considered negligible, as genetically modified cells cannot survive in the 
environment. If transmitted to third parties through direct contact the genetically modified cells are 
expected to be recognised by the immune system and cleared rapidly. A residual risk for the 
environment and third parties might only be associated with residual infectious viral particles present 
in the final cell suspension and/or replication-competent lentiviruses (RCL) contaminating the viral 
vector suspension or being generated following mobilisation of the integrated provirus. However, it has 
been shown that the amount of residual infectious particles in CARVIKTY will be reduced to negligible 
concentrations during manufacturing. Moreover, the absence of RCL has been confirmed at different 
stages of the manufacturing process. In addition, the risk of RCL formation during manufacturing is 
considered negligible due to the absence of the majority of the parental lentiviral sequence in the 
vector and the necessity of several independent recombination events for the generation of a 
functional RCL. 
Therefore, Carvykti is considered to have an overall negligible environment impact.  
2.5.6.  Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
The presented in vitro and in vivo non-clinical primary pharmacodynamics data support expression of 
the BCMA CAR on transduced T-cells, specific activation of BCMA CAR T cells upon binding to the target 
BCMA antigen, and functional activity of the BCMA CAR T cells against target cells.  
In the in vitro and in vivo studies, BCMA CAR T cells have been used, which were generated by 
lentiviral transduction of T cells derived from both, healthy donors and MM patients. These data, 
Assessment report  
EMA/594558/2022  
Page 36/146 
 
 
 
together with characterisation data presented in the quality part of the dossier demonstrated 
acceptable cell viability, acceptable transduction efficiencies, BCMA-induced CAR T cell activation and 
proliferation capacity, and potent cytotoxicity against BCMA-positive relevant target cells.  
The limited evidence on the efficacy of the BCMA CAR T cells in the setting of low BCMA expression, 
which was restricted to the use of Raji cells in an in vitro assay, is accepted based on the available 
clinical data.  
In addition to the in vitro studies, the applicant performed in vivo proof-of concept studies with CAR T 
cells manufactured with second/third generation or third generation LV from Legend in a multiple 
myeloma xenograft model using NCG mice. Despite the known limitations of this model such as the 
unspecific xenogenic response of the CAR T cells or lacking interactions between the CAR T cells and 
the murine immune cells, the animal model is considered adequate to assess in vivo efficacy against 
BCMA expressing tumour cells. 
None of the pharmacology studies used JNJ-68284528 manufactured using the commercial 
manufacturing process. However, based on the comparability data provided, it is expected that the 
anti-tumour activity of the commercial JNJ-68284528 batches will not be reduced as compared to JNJ-
68284538 batches from earlier manufacturing processes. Clinical data of the later cohorts of Study 
MMY2001 (CARTITUDE-1) dosed with JNJ-8284528 representative of commercial batches are expected 
to confirm this post approval in the context of the imposed SOB.  
The provided non-clinical pharmacokinetic investigations focused on the in vivo persistence of CAR-T 
cells manufactured with the second/ third generation hybrid LV developed by Legend in NCG mice 
bearing BCMA-expressing tumour cells within the PD dose escalation study. However, the results of 
this study are not considered translatable to humans since the tumour load in patients and thus in vivo 
proliferation of the CAR T cells are expected to differ as compared to the animal situation. In addition, 
human-derived CAR-T cells in mice respond to xeno-antigens, do not bind to mouse BCMA, and do not 
interact with the murine immune system, which very likely alters pharmacokinetics and persistence of 
human T cells in mice. The absence of biodistribution, metabolism and excretion studies are 
acceptable. Cilta-cel is a genetically modified cell-based therapy for which traditional pharmacokinetic 
studies are not suitable. Such studies would have very limited translatability to the clinical scenario 
since no animal species can be considered responsive to the product administration from a 
pharmacological standpoint. Despite this limitation, the nonclinical pharmacokinetic evaluation of cilta-
cel is considered acceptable. 
Similar to the pharmacokinetic evaluation, the non-clinical safety evaluation of cilta-cel was limited due 
to the lack of a relevant animal model. Therefore, no GLP-compliant formal toxicology studies were 
performed. The lack of repeat-dose toxicity studies is acceptable based on the fact that cilta-cel will be 
administered as a single IV infusion, and since cilta-cel is a patient specific product which is not 
appropriate to administer to immune competent animals. Nevertheless, the applicant performed one in 
vivo (non-GLP) safety study in Cynomolgus monkeys using autologous CAR-T cells manufactured with 
third generation LV developed by Legend. However, since LAB003 has been shown to not bind to 
Cynomolgus BCMA, the Cynomolgus monkey model is not considered relevant to evaluate potential 
safety risks of cilta-cel in humans. Due to the lack of a relevant animal model that could be used in 
toxicology studies, no other non-clinical safety evaluation has been performed in vivo.  
The applicant addressed the risk of on-target/off-tumour toxicity by literature-based assessment and 
the risk of off-target toxicity by various in vitro studies. Since BCMA expression is highly restricted to B 
cells, on-target/off-tumour effects of cilta-cel are expected only on normal B cells. Such an on-
target/off-tumour effect resulting in B-cell aplasia or hypogammaglobulinaemia has been observed in 
the clinical study MMY2001. To minimise those risks, guidance on the required monitoring of blood 
counts and immunoglobulin levels is provided in Section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
Assessment report  
EMA/594558/2022  
Page 37/146 
 
 
 
Potential off-target toxicity was investigated in two studies using CAR-T cells manufactured with the 
second/ third generation hybrid LV developed by Legend or JNJ-68284528 in a human membrane 
surface protein array.  
Data demonstrated different binding results for CAR-T cells manufactured with the second/third 
generation hybrid LV developed by Legend or JNJ-68284528 as JNJ-68284528 was also able to bind to 
CLDN9. Further analysis indicate that the binding domains in LAB003 and JNJ-68284528 bind only to 
cell lines that were engineered to express CLDN9 but do not interact with endogenously expressed 
CLDN9 on primary cells. Based on these findings, the risk of off-target functional consequence in 
treated patients by cilta-cel is expected to be low. The review of serious adverse events reported with 
the use of JNJ-68284528 in clinical studies was also not indicative of obvious CLDN9 off-target effects.  
In addition to the on- or off-target toxicity studies, the risk of insertional oncogenicity resulting from 
LVV integration into the T cell genome has been evaluated by integration analysis. In these studies, 
final drug product derived from 6 MM patients and 3 healthy donors has been used. Although the use 
of ex vivo cilta-cel would have been more suitable for the detection of dominant cell clones, the use of 
final product for integration analysis is considered acceptable based on the high resistance of mature T 
cells to oncogene transformation, which is well documented in the literature. For analysis, different 
viral vectors using clinical and proposed commercial processes were used for transduction. The results 
from the study demonstrate a high degree of polyclonality and an integration pattern typical for 
lentiviruses. Based on this study, the risk of insertional oncogenicity is expected to be very low. In 
addition, clonal dominance might be regarded as an early step in the development of insertional 
oncogenesis and it is expected that additional steps are needed for T cell transformation. Thus, 
although clonal dominance after cilta-cel administration cannot be unequivocally excluded, the clinical 
experience with CAR T cells so far still suggests that the incidence of T cell transformation resulting 
from insertional mutagenesis would be a very rare event. Despite the expected low likelihood, a risk 
monitoring approach is being used in clinical trials and the post-approval setting to characterize 
adverse events such as secondary malignancies (see section 4.4. of the proposed text of the SPC).  
Furthermore, the risk of uncontrolled CAR T cell proliferation has been evaluated by an in vitro study 
using cilta-cel derived from 6 MM patients or 3 healthy donors. There was no evidence for IL-2 
independent T cell proliferation after vector transduction when compared to untransduced T cells.  
In addition to the potential toxicities of cilta-cel, that are dependent either on the cross-reactivity of 
the chosen CAR with non-target antigens or on the insertion site of the vector, there are expected 
risks, that are associated with the general mode of action of CAR T cells, such as tumour lysis 
syndrome (TRS), cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). These 
toxic effects have not been investigated in non-clinical studies which is acceptable considering that 
these effects are general effects of CAR T cells and that the extent of these expected toxicities are 
largely based on patient-specific parameters such as the individual tumour load.  
The lack of any non-clinical reproductive and developmental toxicity studies is acceptable based on the 
type of product, the expression pattern of the target antigen and the lack of a relevant animal model. 
The risk of inadvertent germline transmission of the cilta-cel has not been addressed by the applicant. 
However, the Guideline on non-clinical testing for inadvertent germline transmission of gene transfer 
vectors, EMEA/273974/2005, indicates that the risk of germline transmission associated with the 
administration of genetically modified human cells is considered low and, since animal testing of 
human cells may be difficult or not meaningful, non-clinical germline transmission studies of human 
genetically modified cells are not recommended. In addition, the proposed text in section 4.6 of the 
SPC provides a thorough explanation of the potential risks to fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
including the recommendation of assessment of immunoglobulin levels in newborns of mothers treated 
with CARVIKTY.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
Clinical pharmacology data are presented from the Study 68284528MMY2001. 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods 
A validated sensitive method on the MSD platform was used to detect serum antibodies to cilta-cel in 
Study MMY2001. This assay was developed and validated to screen, confirm, and titer anti-drug 
antibody (ADA) to recombinant-expressed version of the extracellular BCMA-binding domain of cilta-cel 
in human serum samples. The screening method was used to detect potentially positive ADA to 
cilta-cel in human serum samples. The specificity (confirmation) method was used to determine 
whether potentially positive samples were either ADA positive or ADA negative. Positive samples were 
evaluated in a titration method to provide a quasi-quantitative assessment of ADA reactivity in serum 
samples.  
All PK parameters were calculated using conventional non-compartmental methods using actual times 
of sampling, unless otherwise stated in the clinical study report. Population PK analysis used a 
nonlinear mixed-effects approach to generate the PK parameters. 
Model evaluation/qualification assessed various goodness-of-fit measures, including parameter 
estimates relative standard error (RSE), standard diagnostic plots, and visual predictive check (VPC) 
based on 1,000 replicates. The final model should be consistent with the existing knowledge of CAR-T 
PK, provided a good description of the observed data with no apparent trend in the relevant goodness-

of-fit diagnostics. Because SAEM method was used, the typical criteria of successful FOCEI covariance 
step in NONMEM and condition number less than 1,000 were not applicable. 
For calculation of the individual PK parameters, cilta-cel CAR transgene and CD3+CAR+ cell levels 
below the LLOQ were treated as being zero in case of occurrence before the first or after the last 
measurable concentration. When more than half (>50%) of the individual blood and bone marrow 
concentrations of cilta-cel transgene, blood and bone marrow concentrations of CD3+CAR+ cells, and 
serum concentrations of sBCMA for a given time point were below the LLOQ, the mean, minimum, and 
median were reported as BQL while SD, coefficient of variation (%CV), and geometric mean were not 
reported. For graphical analysis, blood concentration values of cilta-cel CAR transgene, CD3+CAR+ 
cells, and serum concentrations values of sBCMA below LLOQ were treated as being zero for the linear 
plots and as missing for the semi-logarithmic plots. 
For values presented in boxplots the solid line in the box is the median. The boundaries of the box 
represent the 25th and 75th percentiles. The whiskers indicate the entire range of values. Any points 
beyond these values are outliers and are drawn individually. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Cilta-cel PK was characterised by transgene levels and CAR-positive cells in peripheral blood and bone 
marrow. The key PK findings for the study overall (Phase 1b and Phase 2 combined and comparisons 
between the phases) are based on transgene level data. In general, PK measurements using both 
transgene and cellular levels were concordant and showed similar expansion and persistence profiles. 
Following a single infusion, cilta-cel exhibited an initial expansion phase followed by a rapid decline and 
then a slower decline with both transgene and cellular persistence over months. 
The median time to reach peak levels of cilta-cel expansion in peripheral blood was 12.7 days (range: 
8.7 to 54.6 days) post-infusion. After cell expansion, the persistence phase of the cilta-cel levels was 
observed for all subjects. The median time to last measurable (non-below quantification limit [BQL]) 
cilta-cel transgene level included all 97 subjects and was comparable in Phase 1b (95.9 days [range: 
26.2 to 438.0 days]) and Phase 2 (99.7 days [range: 20.0 to 240.0 days]). Among 57 out of 97 
subjects who had cilta-cel transgene levels returned to the predose baseline level of BQL at the time of 
the data cut-off, the median time to return to BQL was shorter in Phase 1b than Phase 2, but ranges 
were overlapping. Overall, the median time to return to BQL was 79.7 days (range: 27.0 to 275.0 
days) post-infusion. 
Cilta-cel transgene exposure parameters maximum observed analyte concentration (Cmax), area under 
the analyte concentration-time curve (AUC) from time 0 to 28 days (AUC0-28d), AUC from time 0 to 6 
months (AUC0-6m), and AUC from time 0 to time of last measurable (non-BQL) analyte concentration 
(AUC0-last) showed higher mean values in Phase 2 than in Phase 1b, but with high interindividual 
variability (%CV: 49.8%-123.6%) and different sample sizes (29 in Phase 1b and 68 in Phase 2). 
Overall, the mean (SD) cilta-cel transgene values was 48501 (27362) copies/μg genomic DNA for Cmax, 
504561 (385428) copies*day/μg genomic DNA for AUC0-28d, 1036998 (1348041) copies*day/μg 
genomic DNA for AUC0-6m, and 990124 (1182015) copies*day/μg genomic DNA for AUC0-last. Detectable 
cilta-cel transgene exposures in bone marrow indicate a distribution of cilta-cel from systemic 
circulation to bone marrow. 
The observed cilta-cel CAR transgene PK-time data were adequately described by a 2-compartment 
model (with a fast and a slow decline rate from each compartment, respectively) and a chain of 4 
transit compartments with a lag time empirically representing the process from infused CAR-T cell to 
measurable CAR transgene. 
None of the covariates explored and tested in the population PK model had a statistically significant 
effect on CAR transgene systemic level. Therefore, the base model was also the final model. The model

predicted individual CAR transgene systemic level, Cmax and AUC0-28d were also compared across 
different strata for covariates of interest (a subset of all tested covariates), as shown in the figures 
below.

Hepatic Impairment 
No dedicated hepatic impairment study was planned as cilta-cel is a genetically modified cell-based 
therapy and major changes in cilta-cel exposure are not anticipated in subjects with hepatic 
insufficiency. Population PK analysis confirmed that cilta-cel CAR transgene Cmax and AUC0-28d in 
subjects with mild hepatic dysfunction (total bilirubin ≤ upper limit of normal [ULN] and aspartate 
aminotransferase > ULN or ULN < total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN) were similar to subjects with normal 
hepatic function. 
Renal Impairment 
No dedicated renal impairment study was planned as cilta-cel is a genetically modified cell-based 
therapy and major changes in cilta-cel exposure are not anticipated in subjects with renal insufficiency. 
Population PK analysis confirmed that cilta-cel CAR transgene Cmax and AUC0-28d in subjects with mild 
renal dysfunction (60 mL/min ≤ creatinine clearance [CRCL] < 90 mL/min) were similar to subjects 
with normal renal function (CRCL ≥ 90 mL/min).

Other Intrinsic/Extrinsic Factors 
Cilta-cel CAR transgene PK parameters were similar across age groups and across races. There was no 
apparent relationships between CAR transgene Cmax and AUC0-28d and manufactured product 
characteristics (percent CD4+ cells, percent CD8+ cells, CD4/CD8 ratio, transduction efficiency, CAR 
expression, percent CAR+ naïve, percent CAR+ effector, percent CAR+ central memory, percent CAR+ 
effector memory, percent CAR- naïve, percent CAR- effector, percent CAR- central memory, percent 
CAR- effector memory, percent CD3+ cells, CD3+ viability, in vitro tumour kill assay, vector copy 
number, viable nucleated cells, and post-thaw viability). 
Drug-Drug Interactions 
No dedicated drug-drug interaction studies were performed for cilta-cel. As cilta-cel is a single dose cell 
therapy treatment, no interactions with concomitant medications are expected. 
Tocilizumab, Corticosteroids, and Anakinra 
Median CAR transgene Cmax and AUC0-28d were higher among subjects who received tocilizumab, 
corticosteroids, or anakinra for CRS or ICANS management. Subjects treated with tocilizumab (n=67) 
had median Cmax and AUC0-28d 65% and 67% higher, respectively, compared with subjects who did not 
receive tocilizumab (n=30). Subjects treated with corticosteroids (n=28) had median Cmax and AUC0-28d 
90% and 144% higher, respectively, compared with subjects who did not receive corticosteroids 
(n=69). Similarly, subjects treated with anakinra (n=20) had median Cmax and AUC0-28d 35% and 72% 
higher, respectively, compared with subjects who did not receive anakinra (n=77). However, no 
conclusion regarding the effect of tocilizumab, corticosteroids, or anakinra on cilta-cel PK can be drawn 
due to the confounding concurrence of CRS and overlapping exposure range.

2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Carvykti is a BCMA-directed, genetically modified autologous T cell immunotherapy, which involves 
reprogramming a patient’s own T cells with a transgene encoding a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) 
Assessment report  
EMA/594558/2022  
Page 45/146 
 
 
 
 
 
that identifies and eliminates cells that express BCMA. BCMA is primarily expressed on the surface of 
malignant multiple myeloma B-lineage cells, as well as late-stage B cells and plasma cells. The 
Carvykti CAR protein features two BCMA-targeting single domain antibodies designed to confer high 
avidity against human BCMA, a 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain and a CD3-zeta (CD3ζ) signaling 
cytoplasmic domain. Upon binding to BCMA expressing cells, the CAR promotes T-cell activation, 
expansion, and elimination of target cells. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
soluble B-cell maturation antigen (sBCMA) in Serum 
After a single cilta-cel infusion, sBCMA decreased in all subjects with mean serum concentrations 
reaching nadir levels around the lower quantifiable concentration (LLOQ) value at Day 78 in Phase 1b 
and at Day 100 in Phase 2. Increases from nadir were seen in some subjects, but levels remained 
lower than baseline sBCMA. This reversal of sBCMA levels may reflect a reproduction of BCMA positive 
plasma cells. 
Cytokine Profiling 
Across all subjects, levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, interferon-gamma, and IL-2 receptor alpha 
increased post-infusion and peaked at Days 7–14. The serum levels of all cytokines generally returned 
to baseline levels within 2 months post-infusion. 
Minimal residual disease (MRD) Negativity 
MRD was monitored in subjects using next generation sequencing (NGS) of bone marrow samples DNA 
(Adaptive clonoSeq, version 2.0). At the time of the clinical cut-off (01 September 2020), 57 of the 97 
treated subjects (58.8%) had evaluable bone marrow samples for MRD analysis at the 10-5 level of 
sensitivity using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Evaluable samples were defined as those that 
passed calibration or quality control and included sufficient cells for evaluation at the respective testing 
threshold. Of the 57 evaluable subjects, 53 subjects (93.0%) were MRD negative in bone marrow at a 
sensitivity level of 10-5. 
Secondary pharmacology 
Replication-competent Lentivirus (RCL) 
At the time of the clinical cut-off date 80, 55 and 15 subjects had evaluable samples for RCL analysis 
at 3, 6 and 12 months, respectively. No positive samples for RCL had been detected in any subjects at 
any of the collection timepoints. 
Immunogenicity 
Among the 97 subjects with samples (29 subjects in Phase 1b and 68 subjects in Phase 2), 15 subjects 
(15.5%) were observed to be positive for treatment-emergent anti-cilta-cel antibodies (ADA; 9 
subjects [31.0%] in Phase 1b and 6 subjects [8.8%] in Phase 2). For the ADA-positive subjects, titers 
of anti-cilta-cel antibodies started to be detectable around the Day 100 visit. Based on the current 
data, there was no clear evidence to suggest an association between ADA and cilta-cel exposure, 
efficacy, or safety. 
Exposure-Response Relationships 
The exposure-response (E-R) relationship for ORR was evaluated according to 2 exposure metrics, CAR 
transgene Cmax and AUC0-28d. Given that the majority of treated subjects were responders 
(ORR=96.9%), it was not feasible to draw a conclusion on the E-R relationship between systemic cilta-

cel CAR transgene level and ORR. Similarly, the E-R relationship between systemic cilta-cel CAR 
transgene level and disease progression, as measured by DOR, PFS, and OS, could not be readily 
evaluated due to the limited number of subjects and events (deaths or disease progression). 
A trend of higher median systemic cilta-cel CAR transgene levels (Cmax and AUC0-28d) was observed 
in subjects with CRS or CAR-T cell neurotoxicity (ICANS and other neurotoxicities [including movement 
and neurocognitive treatment-emergent adverse events]) compared with subjects without these 
adverse events. However, given the overlapping CAR transgene levels across adverse event categories, 
this observation needs to be interpreted with caution. No apparent trend with the infused cilta-cel total 
dose (over the narrow target dose range) was observed for any of these safety endpoints. 
Exposure-efficacy 
The median predicted cilta-cel transgene Cmax in responders (n=94) was 61% higher compared with 
the corresponding level in non-responders (n=3) (34,298 [range: 5,088-114,244] versus 21,341 
[range: 7,639-38,543] copies/µg genomic DNA). The median predicted cilta-cel transgene AUC0-28d 
in responders (n=94) was 87% higher compared with the corresponding level in non-responders (n=3) 
(369,827 [range: 64,886-1,475,249] versus 197,433 [range: 88,249-270,032] days∙copies/µg 
genomic DNA).

Exposure-safety 
The median systemic CAR transgene levels (Cmax and AUC0-28d) in subjects with CRS, ICANS, or 
other neurotoxicities (including movement and neurocognitive TEAEs) were generally higher than that 
in subjects without CRS, ICANS, other neurotoxicities (including movement and neurocognitive TEAEs), 
or movement and neurocognitive TEAEs, respectively. Given the overlapping systemic CAR transgene 
levels across AE categories and the small number of subjects with Grade ≥3 CRS (n=5) or Grade ≥3 
ICANS (n=2), any trend observed needs to be interpreted with caution.

Clinical pharmacology data are presented from the Study 68284528MMY2001. 
PK. 
The analytical methods used for PK represent standard methods used in the field. Sampling frequency 
carried out during the clinical trial is considered adequate. Certain aspects of the PK model still need 
some clarifications (results of the bootstrap analysis, the large residual error).  
Assessment report  
EMA/594558/2022  
Page 50/146 
 
 
 
 
 
PK transgene and cellular levels in peripheral blood and bone marrow are concordant and expansion 
and persistence profiles are shown to be similar. The kinetic of expansion and persistence indicate an 
initial expansion phase followed by a rapid decline and then a slower decline with both transgene and 
cellular persistence over months.  The median time to reach peak levels of cilta-cel expansion in 
peripheral blood was 12.7 days (range: 8.7-54.6 days) post-infusion. After the cell expansion, the 
persistence phase of the cilta-cel transgene levels was observed for all subjects.  
Intraindividual variability is not testable, since cilta-cel is administered as a single dose. For the tested 
parameters, high interindividual variability was found. 
Covariate analysis indicate that none of the investigated subject demographics, baseline 
characteristics, or manufactured product characteristics had a statistically significant effect on 
population PK model parameters. Individual outlayers may have influenced some of the findings (e.g. 
influence of prior allogenic transplant, race, tumour burden); however, due to the low number of 
patients treated these discrepancies cannot be further addressed at this stage. Generally, the low 
number of patients treated leaves uncertainties, which could only be answered at higher patient 
numbers. Post marketing data will further provide data to fill in such gap. 
No dedicated renal and hepatic impairment study was planned as cilta-cel is a genetically modified cell-
based therapy and major changes in cilta-cel exposure are not anticipated in subjects with renal and 
hepatic insufficiency. Patients with inadequate renal or hepatic functions were excluded from the 
clinical trial. Mild hepatic or renal dysfunction had no negative impact on PK parameters in the Pop PK 
analysis. These aspects are all indicated in the SmPC. Gender, race, weight or age did not impact PK 
parameters. Cilta-cel is only indicated to treat adults; therefore, investigations in children are not 
required.  
The median systemic CAR transgene levels in subjects with CRS, ICANS, other neurotoxicities 
(including movement and neurocognitive TEAEs), and movement and neurocognitive TEAEs was higher 
than in subjects without CRS, ICANS or movement and neurocognitive TEAEs. These findings are 
expected and similar to previous observations in the literature (Pabst et al, 2020; Milone and Bhoj, 
2018. Additionally, median CAR transgene Cmax and AUC0-28d were higher among subjects who received 
tocilizumab, corticosteroids, or anakinra for CRS or ICANS management. Based on the above 
correlation, this is also expected. Patients having higher CAR+ cell concentrations tend to have CRS of 
higher grades, which then would correlate with the number of patients requiring rescue medications.  
No dedicated drug-drug interaction studies were performed for cilta-cel. 
The PK data provided are therefore considered adequate for the developed product  
PD 
Cilta-cel targets BCMA, which is only expressed on B-cells, plasma cells and malignant B-lineage cells. 
The experiments support the proposed MoA, ensuring a highly specific therapeutic approach.  
The cytolytic mechanism of action of cilta-cel relies on antigen-dependent activation and proliferation 
of anti-BCMA CAR-T-cells via engagement of BCMA expressed on the cell surface of normal or tumour 
plasma cells. 
Expansion of CAR-positive T cells coincided with decreases of serum sBCMA, serum M-protein, and/or 
free light chains. Several serum cytokines (eg, IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-gamma) increased, coinciding with 
expansion of cilta-cel and the onset of CRS. Concentrations of sBCMA in serum slowly decreased as a 
function of time, with mean serum BCMA concentrations reaching nadir levels around the LLOQ value 
(ie, <0.25000 μg/L) at Day 78 in Phase 1b and at Day 100 in Phase 2. 
Assessment report  
EMA/594558/2022  
Page 51/146 
 
 
 
Across all subjects, levels of IL-6, IL-10, INF-gamma, and IL-2 receptor alpha (IL-2Ra) increased post-
infusion and peaked at Days 7 to 14. The serum levels of all cytokines generally returned to baseline 
levels within 2 to 3 months post-infusion.  
Of the 57 evaluable subjects, 53 subjects (93.0%) were MRD negative in bone marrow at a sensitivity 
level of 10-5. 
The overall incidence of antibodies to cilta-cel was 15.5%. Based on the current data, there was no 
clear evidence to suggest an association between ADA and cilta-cel kinetics of initial expansion and 
persistence, efficacy, or safety. 
At the time of the clinical cut-off date, no positive samples for RCL had been detected in any subjects 
at any of the collection timepoints. 
Since cilta-cel was administered in a single dose, findings on E-R are somewhat limited. Given that the 
majority of treated subjects were responders (ORR=96.9%), it was not feasible to draw a conclusion 
on the E-R relationship between systemic cilta-cel CAR transgene level and ORR and, considering the 
limited number of subjects and events, disease progression, as measured by DOR, PFS, and OS could 
not be readily evaluated.  
A trend of higher systemic median cilta-cel CAR transgene level was observed in subjects with CRS or 
CAR-T cell neurotoxicity (ICANS and other neurotoxicities [including movement and neurocognitive 
TEAEs]) compared with subjects without these AEs. 
The PD data provided are therefore considered adequate for the developed product and are considered 
suitable for the SmPC. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The observed biological activity of cilta-cel supports the proposed mechanism of action. The data 
confirm a strong pharmacological rationale. The product can be approved on Pharmacology grounds. 
The CHMP endorses the CAT assessment regarding the conclusions on the Clinical pharmacology as 
described above.

Sample size 
A minimum of 24 and up to 50 subjects were planned to receive treatment to confirm treatment safety 
and provide information to be used in the selection of a recommended dose level (RP2D) for further 
investigation in the Phase 2 part of the study.  
With 24 treated subjects, if the true incidence rate of certain adverse events identified as potential 
risks was 10%, the probability of observing at least one subject experiencing the event would be more 
than 90%.  
Finally, the Phase 1b part included 29 subjects who received treatment. 
Treatment 
Each subject received a conditioning regimen of intravenous (IV) cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 and 
fludarabine 30 mg/m2 at 3 daily doses. The planned conditioning regimen lead to lymphodepletion and 
help promote CAR-T cell expansion in the subject. 
Cilta-cel (JNJ-68284528) was administered as a single infusion (Study Day 1) 5 to 7 days after the 
start of the conditioning regimen (the first day of conditioning is Day -7 to Day -5, and the day of JNJ-
68284528 infusion is Day 1).  
A staggered dosing strategy was initially used in Phase 1b, whereby an observation period was 
required between dosing of each of the first 4 subjects: an observation period of 4 weeks was 
implemented between the first and second subjects followed by a 2-week observation period between 
the second and third subjects and between the third and fourth subjects. 
No observation periods were mandated after the fourth subject received JNJ-68284528. 
A Safety Evaluation Team (SET) was established to ensure safety monitoring and Sponsor oversight 
during the Phase 1b portion and confirmation of the RP2D. 
The SET reviewed all available treatment-emergent data (e.g., pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamics, 
safety, efficacy) at predefined enrolment milestones to evaluate the need for dose level escalation or 
de-escalation.  
For the first 24 subjects enrolled, SET evaluation was required after every 6 subjects had received 
treatment at a given cilta-cel dose level and had been monitored for a 21-day dose de-escalation 
evaluation period. During this period, any observed dose limiting toxicities (DLT) may result in dose 
de-escalation for future subjects.  
Confirmation of the RP2D was to follow SET review of data from at least 24 subjects. 
Dose Level  
Subjects received the JNJ-68284528 (cilta-cel) infusion at one of the following three dose levels:  
•  Dose Level 1: 0.75×106 CAR-positive viable T-cells/kg (range: 0.5-1.0×106) 
•  Dose Level -1: 0.3×106 CAR-positive viable T-cells/kg (range: 0.1-<0.5×106) 
•  Dose Level 2: not to exceed 2.25×106 CAR-positive viable T-cells/kg (range: ±30%) 
Rationale of Dose and Administration Schedule Selection 
Cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 and fludarabine 30 mg/m2 before cilta-cel (JNJ-68284528) infusion 
(Day 1) is consistent with the lymphodepletion regimen used in the marketed CAR-T products Kymriah 
and Yescarta. 
Assessment report  
EMA/594558/2022  
Page 53/146 
 
 
 
 
JNJ-68284528 (cilta-cel) was administered at a targeted infused dose of 0.75 x 106 CAR-positive viable 
T cells/kg (range: 0.5-1.0 x 106 CAR-positive viable T cells/kg with a maximum total dose of 1.0 x 108 
CAR-positive viable T cells) for this Phase 1b-2 study.  
This dose was informed by the Legend-2 clinical study (see section 3.8, supportive studies) performed 
at 4 study sites across China and in which a different manufacturing process was used with differences 
potentially leading to an altered activity of the product. The number of viable CAR-positive T cells 
prepared for the 74 subjects from the Legend-2 study ranged from 0.07 to 2.10 x 106 CAR-positive 
viable T cells/kg (mean 0.642 x106 cells/kg, median 0.513 x106 cells/kg). 
Across all 74 subjects, the safety profile supports doses up to 1.5 x106 cells/kg with regards to 
occurrence of CRS. Analysis of the safety of doses above 1.5 x106 in the Legend-2 study is not possible 
due to the very small number of subjects who received a dose above this concentration.  
As stated above, the JNJ-68284528 (cilta-cel) drug product expresses the same CAR protein but is 
produced using a modified manufacturing process relative to the drug product used in the Legend-2 
study so that differences in clinical activity and safety profiles due to the updated manufacturing 
process are possible. Thus, the targeted infused dose (post-freeze) of 0.75 x 106 CAR-positive viable T 
cells/kg proposed for JNJ-68284528 was reduced to half of the prepared dose (pre-freeze) of 1.5 x 106 
cells/kg supported by the safety analysis summarised in the following table: 
Table 3. Summary of CRS Grade by Weight-adjusted Total CAR-positive T Cell Dose (Legend-
2 Study) 
At 3 of the 4 sites (65 of 74 subjects) in the Legend-2 study, the dose was split into more than 1 
infusion, the most common regimen was 3 infusions given over 7 days. At the 4th site, 9 subjects 
received CAR-T cells manufactured with the second and third generation LV developed by Legendas a 
single administration on Day 1. Review of safety (occurrence of CRS) and efficacy data from the 9 
subjects who received a single infusion of CAR-T cells manufactured with the second and third 
generation LV developed by Legend did not discern a meaningful difference between split doses versus 
single dose administration. Single dose administration is consistent with the dosing regimens of the 2 
currently approved CAR-T products (Kymriah, Yescarta), and bb2121 (Abecma). 
Based on totality of the Legend-2 clinical data, the applicant proposed a target starting dose of 0.75 x 
106 CAR-positive viable T cells/kg for JNJ-68284528 in single administration for testing in the clinic. As 
an added safety precaution (for the study as a whole), a dose de-escalation was planned to be 
performed in subjects in the event of excess toxicity being observed following dosing in the first 6 
subjects. Additionally, a dose escalation was considered if specified safety criteria were met. 
Dose de-escalation 
The dose de-escalation evaluation period was defined as 21 days after the infusion of JNJ-68284528. 
Toxicities that were considered at least possibly related to JNJ-68284528 and that occurred during the 
dose de-escalation evaluation period were considered for dose limiting toxicity (DLT) assessment.  
Assessment report  
EMA/594558/2022  
Page 54/146 
 
 
 
 
Table 4. Dose Limiting Toxicity Criteria 
If >1 out of the first 6 subjects at any dose level met DLT criteria during the 21-day evaluation period, 
a dose de-escalation to a target dose (dose level -1) of 0.3 x 106 CAR-positive viable T cells/kg 
(range: 0.1-0.5 x 106 cells/kg) for following subjects was mandated as determined by the SET. For the 
duration of the Phase 1b portion of the study, a dose de-escalation was mandated if, at the time of the 
SET meeting, DLT criteria are met for >20% of subjects for any dose level reaching the evaluation 
milestone (e.g., 6, 12, or 18 subjects). 
Adverse events were evaluated according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE Version 5.0), with the exception of CRS and CAR-T cell-related 
neurotoxicity (e.g., ICANS). CRS was evaluated according to the ASBMT consensus grading (Lee 
2019). CAR-T cell-related neurotoxicity (e.g., ICANS) was graded using the ASBMT consensus grading. 
Assessments for immune effector cell-associated encephalopathy (ICE) were performed as specified in 
the Time and Events Schedule in both the Phase 1b and Phase 2 portions of the study. 
Dose Escalation 
At the time of the SET meeting, if fewer than 20% of subjects enrolled in the study at the target 
starting dose (dose level 1) met DLT criteria during the 21-day dose de-escalation evaluation period 
described above, a dose escalation (dose level 2) could be approved by the SET. 
Target dose level and range for dose level 2 did not exceed 3 times dose increase from initial target 
dose (2.25 x 106 viable CAR-positive T cells / kg [range: ±30%, depending on the target dose chosen 
for dose level 2]). No dose increased beyond dose level 2. After dose increase, the same criteria for 
dose decrease previously described were used for mandatory reduction back to 0.75 x 106 cells / kg 
(dose level 1). 
The RP2D was confirmed by the SET after evaluation of safety, preliminary efficacy, pharmacokinetic, 
and pharmacodynamic data from at least 24 Phase 1b subjects. The RP2D was a dose level examined 
in Phase 1b at which <20% of subjects experienced a DLT.

Title of Study 
A Phase 1b-2, Open-Label Study of JNJ-68284528, a Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cell (CAR-T) Therapy 
Directed Against BCMA in Subjects with Relapsed or Refractory multiple myeloma 
(68284528MMY2001) 
•  Methods 
Subjects who satisfied all study inclusion and exclusion criteria during the Screening Phase were 
considered eligible for the study. Study intervention then comprised 3 steps: apheresis for collection of 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells, conditioning with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, and infusion 
of cilta-cel. Subjects were considered enrolled at the time of apheresis and were assessed before each 
of these steps to ensure that he or she remained eligible to continue intervention. 
Assessment report

Eligible subjects underwent apheresis for collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) on 
the day of study enrolment. Subjects could receive bridging therapy if clinically indicated to maintain 
disease stability while cilta-cel manufacturing was underway. After notification by the sponsor that 
manufacture and quality testing of cilta-cel had been completed, eligible subjects received a 
conditioning regimen of intravenous (IV) cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 and fludarabine 30 mg/m2 in 
3 daily doses. Five to 7 days after the start of the conditioning regimen, cilta-cel was administered as a 
single infusion with a total targeted dose of 0.75 x 106 CAR-positive viable T cells/kg (range: 0.5-1.0 x 
106 CAR-positive viable T cells/kg).

•  Treatments 
The cilta-cel pre-treatment/treatment phase included apheresis, bridging therapy (optional) and 
lymphodepletion chemotherapy (conditioning regimen: Cy-Flu) and cilta-cel infusion.  
Apheresis 
Eligible subjects underwent apheresis for collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) on 
the day of study enrollment. Apheresis was to be performed according to institutional standards, with a 
collection target of 6 x 109 PBMCs (range: 2 to 20 x 109 PBMCs); 2 apheresis collections could be 
performed to attain this target. The apheresis product was then shipped to the sponsor or designated 
facility for manufacture of cilta-cel. 
Bridging therapy 
Subjects could receive bridging therapy (anti-plasma cell directed treatment between apheresis and 
the first dose of the conditioning regimen) if clinically indicated to maintain disease stability while cilta-
cel manufacturing was underway. Bridging therapy required preapproval from the sponsor and must 
have been a short-term treatment which previously generated at least a response of stable disease for 
the subject. If a subject reached CR after bridging therapy, they were considered no longer eligible to 
receive cilta-cel. 
Conditioning therapy 
After notification by the sponsor that manufacture and quality testing of cilta-cel had been completed, 
eligible subjects received a conditioning regimen of intravenous (IV) cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 and 
fludarabine 30 mg/m2 in 3 daily doses.  
Cilta-cel administration 
Cilta-cel was administered as a single infusion 5 to 7 days after the start of the conditioning regimen 
(the first day of conditioning occurred on Day -7 to Day -5; cilta-cel infusion occurred on Day 1). On 
the day of cilta-cel infusion, subjects were premedicated with diphenhydramine (or the equivalent) 50 
mg and acetaminophen (or the equivalent) 650 to 1,000 mg. This was followed by a single infusion of 
cilta-cel at a targeted infused dose of 0.75 x 106 CAR-positive viable T cells/kg (range: 0.5-1.0 x 106 
CAR-positive viable T cells/kg with a maximum total dose of 1.0 x 108 CAR-positive viable T cells; 
Patients 100 kg and below: 0.5 - 1.0  x  106  CAR-positive viable T cells/kg body weight. Patients 
above 100 kg: 0.5  -  1.0  x  108  CAR-positive viable T cells (non-weight based)). 
Assessment report  
EMA/594558/2022  
Page 58/146 
 
 
 
 
Retreatment 
Subjects could be considered for retreatment with cilta-cel if the following pre-specified criteria were 
met, in addition to continuing to meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria, and obtaining approval from 
the sponsor: 
- Progressive disease after best response of minimal response (MR) or better. 
- No ongoing Grade 3 or higher haematologic toxicity. 
- No ongoing Grade 2 non-haematologic toxicity (with the exception of nausea, vomiting, hair 
loss, and constipation). 
- At least 6 months between first cilta-cel infusion and detection of PD. 
Permitted Medications 
The following are examples of supportive therapies that may have been used during the study: 
- Standard supportive care therapies (antiemetics, antidiarrheals, anticholinergics, antispasmodics, 
antipyretics, antihistamines, analgesics, antibiotics and other antimicrobials, histamine receptor [H2] 
antagonists or proton pump inhibitors, and other medications intended to treat symptoms or signs of 
disease) and therapies intended to treat CAR-T cell related toxicity (ie, CRS) as clinically indicated, 
according to institutional standards and as deemed necessary by the investigator. 
- Bisphosphonates may be initiated (if not already being administered) unless contraindicated within 1 
week prior to the first dose of study treatment and continued until disease progression is established. 
In the case of severe adverse events such as hypercalcaemia, bisphosphonates may be administrated 
as clinically indicated, according to institutional standards and as deemed necessary by the 
investigator. 
- Haematopoietic growth factor support and transfusions (irradiated blood products) are permitted to 
treat symptoms or signs of neutropenia, anaemia or thrombocytopenia according to local standards of 
care. Non-pegylated myeloid growth factors are permitted up to 1 day prior to the start of the 
conditioning regimen. 
- Documented infectious complications should be treated with oral or IV antibiotics or other anti-
infective agents as considered appropriate by the treating investigator, according to standard 
institutional practice. 
- Chemotherapy agents used to treat CAR-T cell-related toxicities are permitted upon consultation with 
the sponsor.  
Prohibited Therapies 
The following medications were prohibited during the study.  
- Corticosteroid use should be avoided, except for the treatment of CRS or CAR-T cell-related 
neurotoxicity (eg, ICANS). Alternative therapies, if feasible, should be given prior to corticosteroids. 
- Any chemotherapy, anticancer immunotherapy (other than cilta-cel), or experimental therapy, except 
as described in Section 3.1 (bridging therapy), or protocol- specific therapies which may be used in 
conjunction with cilta-cel. 
- While in follow-up, emergency orthopaedic surgery or radiotherapy is generally prohibited, but may 
be allowed in the absence of disease progression. Cases must be discussed and approved by the 
sponsor. Such emergency radiotherapy may consist of localised radiotherapy for pain control or for 
stabilisation of an extensive bone lesion at high risk of pathologic fracture or damage to surrounding 
tissues. 
Assessment report  
EMA/594558/2022  
Page 59/146 
 
 
 
 
 
- Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents should be avoided to minimize the risk of exacerbation of 
potential sub-clinical myeloma-related kidney disease. Based on the investigator’s clinical judgement, 
low-dose aspirin may be continued for thromboprophylaxis. 
- Other immunosuppressant agents unless used as protocol-specified pre- or post-treatment 
medications to treat an adverse event (eg, CRS). 
- Vaccination with live, attenuated vaccine after signing consent and in the ≤4 weeks prior to the 
infusion of cilta-cel, and for 100 days after infusion of cilta-cel. 
- The use of IV contrast infusions should be avoided to prevent myeloma-related kidney disease. If 
administration of IV contrast is necessary, then adequate precautions including hydration are 
indicated.

•  Sample size 
For the Phase 1b part of the study at least 24 and up to approximately 50 patients were planned to be 
treated in order to assess safety. The probability of detecting at least one subject experiencing a 
certain adverse event under the assumed true incidence rate based on plausible sample sizes is as 
follows: 
Table 5. Sample Size Scenarios in Phase 1b 
For the Phase 2 part of the study a sample size of 60 subjects were planned. With an assumed overall 
response rate of at least 50%, there were approximately 90% power to declare the ORR to be higher 
than 30% at the 1-sided significance level of 0.025. 
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Randomisation was not used in this study, and subjects were to receive study treatment if all inclusion 
and exclusion criteria were met. The use of a randomised study design was considered impractical 
given that the study population included subjects who had largely exhausted available treatment 
options leaving no available comparator to ensure equipoise. 
As this was an open-label study, blinding procedures were not employed. 
•  Statistical methods 
The ITT population was defined as all patients enrolled. The mITT population was defined as all 
subjects who received a JNJ-68284528 infusion at the targeted RP2D dose. The all treated analysis set 
consisted of subjects who received JNJ-68284528 infusion. This set was planned for the primary 
analysis set for safety summaries. 
The primary efficacy endpoint for the Phase 2 study was planned to be ORR. The first analysis was 
planned to be conducted 6 months after the last subject has received the initial dose of JNJ-68284528, 
based on the mITT analysis set. The response rate and its 95% Clopper-Pearson exact confidence 
interval (CI) were planned to be calculated based on binomial distribution. The null hypothesis were 
planned to be rejected if the lower bound of the confidence interval exceeds 30%. Analysis of VGPR or 
better response rate, DOR, PFS, and OS were planned to be conducted at the same cutoff as the ORR, 
and an update of these endpoints were planned to be provided at approximately 9-12 months after the 
last subject has received his or her initial dose of JNJ-68284528 and at the end of the study, which was 
defined as 2 years after the last subject has received his or her initial dose of JNJ-68284528.  
Sensitivity analyses for the primary efficacy analysis were planned to be performed on the mITT 
analysis set using disease response based on the computerised algorithm and investigator assessment 
according to the IMWG response criteria. The prevalence-adjusted-bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK) 
statistics1 and 95% CI were calculated for agreement between IRC assessment and computerised 
algorithm assessment for response (response [PR or better] vs. no response). Further sensitivity 
analysis of ORR analysis were planned on all enrolled analysis set, on all treated analysis set, and on 
subjects in the mITT set who received the JNJ-68284528 product that met all the pre-specified release 
criteria. 
The intercurrent event of subsequent antimyeloma therapy or retreatment with JNJ-68284528 were 
handled with the while on treatment strategy, meaning that responses after these intercurrent events 
Assessment report  
EMA/594558/2022

were not considered for the primary endpoint. There was no imputation planned for missing efficacy 
endpoints, however, patients with no post-baseline data were considered as non-responders. There 
was no plan for the correction for the type I error and no plan for interim analyses. Subgroup analyses 
were planned to be performed by descriptive summaries and forest plots. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints were analysed as follows: Response rates (VGPR, MRD status, clinical 
benefit rate etc) were planned according to ORR. The distribution (median and Kaplan-Meier curves) of 
time to event endpoints (DOR, time to response, PFS, OS, etc) were planned to be provided using 
Kaplan-Meier estimates for subjects who achieved response during the study. Similar analysis were 
planned to be performed for OS, PFS, and TTR for the mITT analysis set.

Prior therapy 
To be eligible for this study, subjects must have received at least 3 prior multiple myeloma treatment 
lines of therapy or have been double refractory to an IMiD and PI as defined by the IMWG consensus 
criteria. 
All subjects (100%) received at least 3 prior lines of multiple myeloma therapy, median of 6 prior lines 
(range: 3-18). A majority (49 subjects [50.5%]) received 5 or more. Seventeen subjects (17.5%) 
received exactly 3 prior lines of therapy. 
•  All subjects (100%) received prior PI, IMiD, corticosteroids, and anti-CD38 antibody therapy. 
• 
• 
Eighty-one subjects (83.5%) were penta-exposed (received prior treatment with at least 2 PIs, 
at least 2 IMiDs, and at least 1 anti-CD38 antibody). 
Eighty-seven (89.7%) subjects received one or more autologous stem cell transplantation 
(ASCT) and 8 subjects (8.2%) received allogenic transplantation. 
Note that eligibility for a subsequent ASCT was not collected in this study. 
The most commonly reported (≥20% of subjects) prior systemic therapies for multiple myeloma 
included the following: 
•  Antineoplastic agents 
o  Daratumumab: 94 subjects (96.9%), 
o  Bortezomib: 92 subjects (94.8%), 
o  Carfilzomib: 83 subjects (85.6%), 
o  Melphalan: 80 subjects (82.5%), 
o  Cyclophosphamide: 63 subjects (64.9%), 
o 
Ixazomib: 29 subjects (29.9%),

o  Etoposide: 28 subjects (28.9%), 
o  Doxorubicin: 27 subjects (27.8%), 
o  Cisplatin: 24 subjects (24.7%),

o 
Lenalidomide: 96 subjects (99.0%) 
o  Pomalidomide: 89 subjects (91.8%) 
o  Thalidomide: 21 subjects (21.6%) 
Ninety-six subjects (99.0%) were refractory to their last line of prior therapy. Eighty-five subjects 
(87.6%) were refractory to the 3 major classes of therapeutic agents for multiple myeloma (PI, IMiD, 
and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody therapy), referred to as “triple-refractory.” Forty-one subjects 
(42.3%) were refractory to 5 or more agents (including at least 2 PIs, at least 2 IMiDs, and at least 1 
anti-CD38 antibody therapy), referred to as “penta-refractory.”

Bridging Therapy 
Bridging therapy was administered for 73 subjects (75.3%) between the time of apheresis and the first

dose of the conditioning regimen. Proteasome inhibitors were used in 44 subjects (45.4%), IMiDs in 26 
subjects (26.8%) and Anti-CD38 antibodies in 15 subjects (15.5%). The most common agents used as 
bridging therapies (≥20% of subjects in the All Treated population) included: 
  Dexamethasone: 62 subjects (63.9%), 
Bortezomib: 26 subjects (26.8%), 
  Cyclophosphamide: 22 subjects (22.7%), and 
Pomalidomide: 21 subjects (21.6%). 
-
-
-
Among the 73 patients received any bridging therapy, 33 subjects (45.2%) had a transient decrease in 
-
tumour burden (defined as change in serum M-protein, urine M-protein, or difference between involved 
and uninvolved free light chain [dFLC]) between screening and cilta-cel infusion. Among those subjects 
who experienced a tumour burden decrease, 15 subjects (20.5%) experienced a decrease of >50%. 
However, despite the decrease in tumour burden in some subjects, no subjects achieved CR while on 
bridging therapy. 
Thirty-six of the subjects (49.3%) who received bridging therapy experienced an increase in tumour 
burden with 25 subjects (34.2%) experiencing an increase ≥25%. Two of the subjects (2.7%) who 
received bridging therapy did not experience a change in tumour burden as a result of bridging therapy 
any and additional 2 subjects (2.7%) were not evaluable for assessment of change in tumour burden. 
Thirty-seven subjects (38.1%) experienced adverse events related to bridging therapy with 31 
subjects (32.0%) experiencing Grade 3 or 4 adverse events.  
Apheresis 
Out of 143 subjects consented, 113 completed apheresis and were thus considered enrolled into the 
study. One hundred nine subjects (96.5%) required a single apheresis attempt to meet the collection 
target (6 x 109 PBMC). Three subjects (2.7%) required 2 apheresis attempts and 1 subject (0.9%) 
required 3 attempts at apheresis. The median duration of apheresis was 239 minutes (range: 127 to 
378 minutes), with a median of 185.5 mL collected (range 80 to 349 mL). 
Exposure to Study Treatment 
Cyclophosphamide and Fludarabine Conditioning 
Prior to cilta-cel infusion, subjects were to receive a conditioning regimen of IV cyclophosphamide 300 
mg/m2 and IV fludarabine 30 mg/m2 in 3 daily doses beginning on Day -7 to Day -5. The median 
cumulative dose of cyclophosphamide infusion was 897.8 mg/m2 (range; 748 to 946 mg/m2). The 
median cumulative dose of fludarabine infusion was 89.6 mg/m2 (range; 45 to 95 mg/m2).

Cilta-cel Infusion 
Cilta-cel infusion occurred on Day 1, which was 5 to 7 days after the start of the conditioning regimen. 
The median time from initial apheresis to cilta-cel infusion was 47 days (range: 41 to 167 days). 
Receipt to release (R2R) is calculated from the day after the receipt of leukapheresis material at the 
manufacturing facility up to, and inclusive of the day on which the CAR-T product is released for 
shipment to the clinical trial site. R2R for cilta-cel is a median 29 days (range: 23-64 days). The 
median total number of CAR-positive viable T cells infused was 54.30 x 106 (range: 23.5 x 106 to 93.1 
x 106 cells) with a median of 0.709 x106 cells/kg administered (range: 0.51 x 106 to 0.95 x106 
cells/kg). The median duration of cilta-cel infusion was 19.0 minutes (range: 5 to 71 minutes).

A total of 113 subjects, 35 in Phase 1b and 78 in Phase 2, were enrolled and underwent apheresis. A 
majority of enrolled subjects (97 subjects; 85.8%) were able to receive a cilta-cel infusion. Note that 
as all 97 treated subjects received the RP2D, the all-treated analysis set is equivalent to the modified

Twelve subjects (10.6%) discontinued between apheresis and the start of conditioning regimen; 8 
subjects (7.1%) discontinued due to death, 2 subjects (1.8%) due to PD and 2 subjects (1.8%) due to 
withdrawal of consent. Four subjects (3.5%) received conditioning regimen but did not receive JNJ-
68284528 infusion. Two of them refused future study treatment, one withdrew due to adverse event 
and one died. No subjects discontinued due to manufacturing failure. 
•  Outcomes and estimation 
Efficacy results are presented using a data cutoff date of 1 September 2020, which corresponds to a 
time point 6 months after the last subject received his or her initial dose of cilta-cel. At the time of 
clinical cut-off, the median duration of follow-up for all subjects was 12.42 months. Additional key 
efficacy data with a longer follow-up using a data cutoff of 11 February 2021 was submitted as a 
separate document. As of the 11 February 2021 cut-off, the median duration of follow-up was 18.0 
months. 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
Overall Response Rate 
The ORR (PR or better) as assessed by the IRC based on IMWG Criteria was: 
- All Treated population (n=97): 96.9% (95% CI: 91.2% to 99.4%) 
- All Enrolled population (n=113): 83.2% (95% CI: 75.0% to 89.6%) (Tables below).

Table 16.  Overall Best Response Based on Independent Review Committee (IRC) 
Assessment; All Treated Analysis Set (Study 68284528MMY2001) (data cut off 1 
September 2020) 
A sensitivity analysis of ORR in the All Treated population was conducted via computerised algorithm 
that combined all pertinent laboratory results and the results of imaging, as assessed by the 
investigator, for each patient and derived the outcome in accordance with IMWG Criteria (Palumbo 
2016). Assessment by computerised algorithm demonstrated an ORR of 92.8% (95% CI: 85.7% to 
97.0%). This assessment demonstrates a high degree of concordance between the IRC assessment 
and assessment by computerised algorithm, as indicated by Prevalence Adjusted and Bias Adjusted 
Kappa (PABAK)=0.92 (95% CI: 0.84 to 1.00) and observed agreement of 95.9%. 
A sensitivity analysis of ORR was conducted based upon investigator assessment demonstrating an 
ORR of 96.9% (95% CI: 91.2% to 99.4%). This is consistent with the primary analysis using IRC 
assessment according to IMWG response criteria.  
At the 11 February 2021 data cutoff date treatment of these subjects with cilta-cel resulted in an 
overall response rate (ORR) of 97.9% with 95 of 97 subjects in the All-treated analysis set achieving a 
partial response (PR) or better as assessed by Independent Review Committee (IRC) (based on 
International Myeloma Working Group [IMWG] criteria). Notably, the stringent complete response 
(sCR) rate was 80.4%. The ORR for the 113 subjects in the All Enrolled analysis set (includes 16 
subjects who did not receive a cilta-cel infusion) was 84.1%, with a sCR rate of 69.0%.

Major Secondary Analyses 
VGPR or Better Rate 
Very good partial response (VGPR) or better rate was defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved 
a sCR, CR, or VGPR according to IMWG response criteria. 
The overall response of VGPR or better as assessed by the IRC was: 
- All Treated population (n=97): 92.8% (95% CI: 85.7% to 97.0%) 
- All Enrolled population (n=113): 79.6% (95% CI: 71.0% to 86.6%) 
Duration of Response 
Duration of response (DOR) will be calculated among responders (with a PR or better response) from 
the date of initial documentation of a response (PR or better) to the date of first documented evidence 
of PD, as defined in the IMWG Criteria. Most responders’ DOR data (74.5% of subjects with PR or 
better) was censored at the time of clinical cut off, which resulted in a median DOR not reached based 
on IRC review.

Assessment of DOR based on IRC assessment of best response achieved is presented graphically in 
Figure 15 below. DOR for those with CR or better as the best response appears to be longer compared 
to those subjects with PR/VGPR as the best response, although neither group reached median duration 
of response (mDOR) at the time of data cut off.

Versus  Other  Responders;  Responders  in  All  Treated  Analysis  Set  (Study 
68284528MMY2001) (data cut off 1 September 2020) 
At the 11 February 2021 data cutoff date deep and durable responses were induced by cilta-cel as 
demonstrated by a very good partial response (VGPR) or better rate of 94.8% in the All-treated 
analysis set. Seventy-eight subjects (80.4%) achieved a sCR. At a median follow-up of 18.0 months, 
median duration of response (DOR) was 21.8 months (95% CI: 21.8 months, not estimable [NE]) at 
the time of the clinical cutoff. The probabilities of the responders remaining in response at 9 months 
and 12 months were 79.7% (95% CI: 70.0%, 86.5%) and 72.9% (95% CI: 62.6%, 80.9%), 
respectively. The median DOR for subjects achieving CR/sCR has not yet reached. 
MRD Negativity Rate 
Subjects were (or will be) assessed for MRD negativity by next-generation sequencing (NGS) 
(clonoSEQ version 2.0) at baseline, 28 days, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months post 
cilta-cel infusion and for subjects with suspected CR at the time of CR and then yearly for subjects that 
remain on study up to disease progression. At the time of clinical cutoff (1 September 2020), 95 
subjects (97.9%) had bone marrow samples available for MRD evaluation. However, not all baseline 
samples were evaluable. Identification of the clone at the baseline sample failed in 25 subjects 
(26.3%) and samples from 2 subjects had an unsuccessful assay run.  
Fifty-three subjects (54.6%) achieved MRD negativity at the 10-5 threshold of sensitivity with 33 
subjects (34.0%) also achieving CR/sCR. Note that for MRD negative CR/sCR, only MRD assessments 
(10 -5 testing threshold) within 3 months of achieving CR/sCR until death, progression, or subsequent 
therapy (exclusive) are considered. 
At the 11 February 2021 data cutoff date, 96 subjects (99.0%) had samples available for MRD 
evaluation (baseline and post-baseline sample). Of the 61 subjects with evaluable samples (ie, 
subjects with identifiable clone at baseline and had sufficient cells to be tested at sensitivity level of 10-
5 in post treatment samples), 56 (91.8%) achieved MRD negativity in bone marrow at a sensitivity 
level of 10-5. Among the 78 subjects who achieved sCR/CR, 47 subjects have evaluable samples. Of 
Assessment report

these 47 subjects, 42 (89.4%) achieved MRD negativity at a sensitivity level of 10-5. In the context of 
the all treated set MRD negativity Rate is 57.7% (N=56; 95% CI: (47.3, 67.7)) with MRD MRD 
negative patients with sCR of 43.3% N=42; 95% CI: 33.3, 53.7) and in the context of all 
Leukapheresed the MRD negativity Rate is 49.6% (N= 56; 95% CI: 40.0, 59.1) and the MRD negative 
patients with sCR is 37.2% (N=42; 95% CI: 28.3, 46.8. 
Time to Response

Committee  (IRC)  Assessment;  Responders  in  All  Treated  Analysis  Set  (Study 
68284528MMY2001) (data cut off 1 September 2020) 
At the 11 February 2021 data cutoff date, the median time to response was rapid, occurring after 1 
month of treatment. The median time to first response was 0.95 months (range: 0.9 to 10.7 months), 
median time to best response was 2.6 months (range: 0.9 to 15.2 months), and median time to CR or 
better was 2.63 months (range:0.9 to 15.2 months). 
Progression-free Survival 
In the all-treated population, 74.2% of subjects’ PFS data was censored at the clinical cut off (1 
September 2020), which resulted in a median PFS not reached for assessment based on IRC review. As 
of clinical cut off the 12-month PFS rates are as follows: 
- All Treated population (n=97): 76.6% (95% CI: 66.0% to 84.3%) 
- All Enrolled population (n=113): 70.7% (95% CI: 60.9% to 78.5%).

Figure 16.  Kaplan-Meier Plot for Progression-Free Survival Based on Independent Review 
Committee (IRC) Assessment; All Treated Analysis Set (Study 
68284528MMY2001) 
Seventeen  subjects  (17.5%)  had  PD.  The  most  common  reason  for  disease  progression  was  the 
development/increase in plasmacytomas (8 subjects [47.1%]), the development of new or worsening 
lytic disease (7 subjects [41.2%]) or an increase in serum or urine paraproteins (7 subjects [41.2%]).  
While data continue to mature, available data suggests that there may be a positive association between 
depth of response and PFS. Participants achieving CR or better had a 6-month PFS rate of 96.9% (95% 
CI: 88.3 to 99.2) versus 69.0% (95%CI: 48.8 to 82.5) for other responders.

Versus  Other  Responders;  Responders  in  All  Treated  Analysis  Set  (Study 
68284528MMY2001) 
All 72 subjects with data censored for PFS analysis in the All Treated analysis set are due to the timing 
of the clinical data cut off. No subjects have been lost to follow-up. 
At the 11 February 2021 data cutoff date, at a median duration of follow-up of 18.0 months, median 
progression-free survival (PFS) was 22.8 months (95% CI: 22.8, NE) and the median PFS for subjects 
who achieved CR/sCR was not yet reached. At 12 months post ciltacel infusion, 76.3% of subjects 
(95% CI: 66.5% to 83.6%) remained progression free.  
Overall Survival 
At the time of clinical cut off (1 September 2020), 14 subjects (14.4%) had died in the all-treated 
population. Overall survival data are yet to be mature enough to provide a reliable estimate for median 
OS. However, the estimated OS rates at 12 months were: 
- All Treated population (n=97): 88.5% (95% CI: 80.2% to 93.5%) 
- All Enrolled population (n=113): 81.3% (95% CI: 72.6% to 87.6%).

As reported by (Kapoor 2013), depth of response is prognostic of patients’ long-term outcome. 
Similar trend appears to be true based on limited OS events observed in this study.

At the 11 February 2021 data cutoff date, median overall survival (OS) has not been reached. The 12-
month OS rate was 87.6% (95% CI: 79.2% to 92.8%). While data continue to mature, available data 
suggests that there may be a positive association between depth of response and favorable PFS and 
OS. 
Efficacy Following Retreatment 
At the time of clinical cut off (1 September 2020), one subject received retreatment with cilta-cel. This 
subject initially progressed 511 days after the first cilta-cel infusion. The retreated subject developed 
new and worsening lytic disease and was diagnosed with PD 32 days after retreatment. 
Subsequent Anti-myeloma Therapy 
Seventeen subjects (17.5%) had PD after cilta-cel infusion. Eleven of these subjects received 
subsequent anti-myeloma therapy after disease progression.

Health-related Quality of Life 
Subjects in the Phase 2 portion of the study completed PRO measures related to their Health-Related 
Quality of Life (HRQoL). This included assessment of disease-related symptoms, functioning, and 
general wellbeing using 5 PRO measures: EORTC QLQ-C30, items from the EORTC QLQ-MY20, EQ-5D-
5L, Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), and the Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGIS). 
Compliance for the EORTC QLQ-C30 was 92.6% at baseline, 83.1% at Day 100, and declined in the 
post-treatment, follow-up phase. The rationale for the majority of questionnaires not completed was 
due to restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.

The hypothesis is that treatment with cilta-cel will demonstrate acceptable 
safety and will have significant anti-myeloma activity greater than 30% (ie, the 
lower limit of two-sided 95% confidence interval [CI] for ORR, as assessed by 
the IRC, is greater than 30%) at the targeted recommended Phase 2 dose

Notes 
As this is a single-arm trial the comparison with historical data is no 
confirmatory comparison. The comparison with an external control arm can 
only be interpreted in exploratory manner. Results may be biased in favour of 
the study treatment.  
For overall response rate, the weighted logistic regression model containing 
treatment group indicator only was adopted to estimate the treatment effect 
in terms of the odds ratio and its 95% CI using robust variance estimator.

No separate analysis/data in special populations is presented. The subgroup analysis contains data on 
age groups. There´s no significant change in efficacy for the elderly in the analysed age groups (<65, 
65-75, >75 yrs), although the number of patients in the >75 yrs is rather low (n=8).

In the absence of a direct comparator in the single arm CARTITUDE-1 study, the purpose of this 
analysis is to contextualize the efficacy results reported by using real-world data in patients treated 
with currently available treatment options. The MAMMOTH study (Monoclonal Antibodies in Multiple 
Myeloma: Outcomes after Therapy Failure) is a multi-centre, retrospective chart review study to 
investigate the natural history and outcomes of patients with multiple myeloma refractory to CD38 
monoclonal antibodies. A total of 275 patients were identified at 14 academic institutions in the US 
with diagnosis of active multiple myeloma who were refractory to CD38 monoclonal antibody 
administered alone or in combination. MAMMOTH study data were collected between January 2017 and 
June 2018 by myeloma investigators at the participating institutions. Eligible patients had received 
treatment with a CD38 monoclonal antibody for at least 4 weeks and had evidence of progressive 
disease as defined by International Myeloma WorkingGroup (IMWG) Response Criteria. 
The comparison between MAMMOTH cohort and CARTITUDE-1 cohort were made for ORR, progression-
free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for both ITT and mITT populations.

Clinical data on comparison of the two manufacturing processes: 
Preliminary clinical data provided by the applicant to compare the efficacy of the two manufacturing 
processes were obtained in the ongoing 68284528MMY2003 study. Cohort A includes subjects with 
progressive disease after 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy for multiple myeloma including a proteasome 
inhibitor (PI) and immunomodulatory therapy (IMiD) either individually or in combination. In addition, 
all study subjects were required to be refractory to lenalidomide. Subjects who received prior therapy 
that is targeted to BCMA were excluded from this cohort.

A total of 30 subjects received cilta-cel in Cohort A; 20 subjects received cilta-cel manufactured with 
clinical lentiviral vector (LV) and 10 subjects received cilta-cel manufactured with commercially 
representative LV(commercial product). The current preliminary data are insufficient to exclude 
efficacy differences. However, it is considered, that the patients treated with the commercial product 
still have a positive benefit/risk.

2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The MMY2001 pivotal study is the only study from which efficacy data are included for this MAA.  
The current ESMO GL (March 2021) allows inclusion of MM patients into clinical trials at a second or 
subsequent relapse. Given the chosen indication of patients with no further therapeutic option, and in 
the light of the efficacy results, the single arm design is acceptable. Additionally, the spplicant provided 
an analysis comparing efficacy with real world data derived external control, with the terms agreed in 
EMA SAs, which is deemed to be supportive.

No formal dose finding took place in the Legend-2 study, however, the design of the CARTITUDE-1 
study allowed for potential dose adjustments. The safety and efficacy data in the CARTITUDE-1 study 
represent strong arguments for the selected dose.  
By the inclusion criteria relapsed or double (PI and IMID) refractory state was required for enrolment. 
Patients should have received at least three lines of treatment being the median number reported of 6 
and these should have included a PI, an IMiD, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody (mAb). 
Refractoriness to an anti-CD38 mAb has been indirectly defined as an inclusion criteria, by requiring 
previous exposure and evidence of progressive disease. Patients previously exposed to e.g. anti-BCMA 
mAb were excluded for the MMY2001 study. These patients are expected to be investigated throughout 
the development programme.  
Eligibility for enrolment was determined prior to leukapheresis, and patients were considered enrolled 
at the time of leukapheresis. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are considered appropriate and in 
accordance with other clinical studies in RRMM.  
Overall, the objectives and endpoints of the study are acceptable. The primary endpoint was ORR 
according to the IMWG criteria assessed by an IRC. This is an acceptable primary endpoint in an 
uncontrolled trial as it is a direct measure of the drug´s antitumour activity. Additionally, data on 
duration of response, TTP/PFS, and available data on OS were also reported, although the 
interpretation of these measures is difficult without a randomised reference. The same is valid for 
clinical benefit rate data.  
The protocol allowed bridging therapy. This is acceptable. Subgroup analysis revealed that there is no 
obvious difference in the outcome of patients, who experienced tumour burden reduction following 
bridging therapy. Retreatment was allowed under certain conditions; however, as it is stated in the 
latter parts of the CSR, there was only one patient who was retreated, so the general efficacy/benefit 
aspects of retreatments cannot be evaluated at this stage.  
A standard CY + FLU lymphodepletion chemotherapy regimen was administered. This is considered 
acceptable. 
The first analysis was planned to be conducted approximately 6 months after the last subject received 
their initial dose of cilta-cel. An update of the analysis was planned to be provided at approximately 9–
12 months after last subject receives their initial dose of cilta-cel and at the end of the study, which is 
defined as 2 years after the last subject has received their initial dose. The planned time point for the 
initial analyses is earlier than those proposed for other similar (CAR-T) products. This issue could 
impact results and the interpretation of the data, given that responses to CAR-T cells are rapid, and 
relapse has been described in more than 50% of patients in around 12 months.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The baseline characteristics were relatively well balanced. However, in important prognostic factors, 
some discrepancies were observed: cytogenetic risk based grouping included 70.1% standard risk, 
23.7% high-risk patients, and a certain tilt towards younger patients was observed. ISS staging also 
indicated that about 2/3 of patients had stage I disease. It is also noted that the patients were heavily 
treated before study enrolment. 
The majority of patients (75.3%) received a bridging therapy between the time of apheresis and the 
first dose of the conditioning regimen. Among the 73 patients received any bridging therapy, 33 
subjects (45.2%) had a transient decrease in tumour burden. Subgroup analysis did not reveal an 
influence of bridging therapy on efficacy outcomes.  
The ORR (PR or better) as assessed by the IRC based on IMWG Criteria was: 
Assessment report  
EMA/594558/2022  
Page 102/146 
 
 
 
- All Treated population (n=97): 96.9% (95% CI: 91.2% to 99.4%) 
- All Enrolled population (n=113): 83.2% (95% CI: 75.0% to 89.6%). These values are statistically 
significant, and better than the null hypothesis.  
At the 11 February 2021 data cut-off date treatment of these subjects with cilta-cel resulted in an 
overall response rate (ORR) of 97.9% with 95 of 97 subjects in the All Treated analysis set achieving a 
partial response (PR) or better as assessed by Independent Review Committee (IRC) (based on 
International Myeloma Working Group [IMWG] criteria). The ORR for the 113 subjects in the All 
Enrolled analysis set (includes 16 subjects who did not receive a cilta-cel infusion) was 84.1%, 
representing a slight improvement over time for both measurements.  
Subgroup analyses were performed in the cilta-cel treated population. The observed ORR was 
consistent across all subgroups examined including evaluation by age, sex, race, total CAR-T positive 
cells infused, baseline ECOG performance score, baseline ISS staging, lines of prior therapy, disease 
type, refractory status, cytogenic risk groups, baseline bone marrow plasma cells, baseline BCMA 
expression, and study site.  
The only difference would be stem cell transplant history. Stem cell transplant history in an autologous 
setting was not found to have an impact on ORR. However, patients treated with allogeneic stem cells 
had an apparently lower ORR (87.5% vs. 97.8%) when compared to patients without prior allogeneic 
stem cell transplant history. Yet the low number of patients (n= 8) does not allow any conclusions at 
this stage- so this aspect may be relevant for post-MA follow-up.  
Very good partial response (VGPR) or better rate was defined as the proportion of subjects who 
achieved a sCR, CR, or VGPR according to IMWG response criteria. 
The overall response of VGPR or better as assessed by the IRC was: 
All Treated population (n=97): 92.8% (95% CI: 85.7% to 97.0%) 
All Enrolled population (n=113): 79.6% (95% CI: 71.0% to 86.6%) 
-
Duration of response (DOR) was not reached at first clinical cut-off. At the 11 February 2021 data cut-
-
off date deep and durable responses were induced by cilta-cel as demonstrated by a very good partial 
response (VGPR) or better rate of 94.8% in the allttreated analysis set. Seventy-eight subjects 
(80.4%) achieved a sCR. At a median follow-up of 18.0 months, median duration of response (DOR) 
was 21.8 months (95% CI: 21.8 months, not estimable [NE]) at the time of the clinical cut-off. The 
probabilities of the responders remaining in response at 9 months and 12 months were 79.7% (95% 
CI: 70.0%, 86.5%) and 72.9% (95% CI: 62.6%, 80.9%), respectively. The median DOR for subjects 
achieving CR/sCR has not yet reached. 
Fifty-three subjects achieved MRD negativity. At the 11 February 2021 data cut-off date, 56 subjects 
(91.8%) achieved MRD negativity in bone marrow at a sensitivity level of 10-5. MRD results indicate 
that a high proportion of complete responders achieved deep responses to the therapy. 
In the all-treated population, 74.2% of subjects’ PFS data was censored at the clinical cut off, which 
resulted in a median PFS not reached for assessment based on IRC review. As of clinical cut off the 12-
month PFS rates are as follows: 
All Treated population (n=97): 76.6% (95% CI: 66.0% to 84.3%) 
All Enrolled population (n=113): 70.7% (95% CI: 60.9% to 78.5%). 
-
At the 11 February 2021 data cut-off date, at a median duration of follow-up of 18.0 months, median 
-
progression-free survival (PFS) was 22.8 months (95% CI: 22.8, NE) and the median PFS for subjects 
who achieved CR/sCR was not yet reached. At 12 months post cilta-cel infusion, 76.3% of subjects 
(95% CI: 66.5% to 83.6%) remained progression free.  
Assessment report  
EMA/594558/2022  
Page 103/146 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At the time of clinical cut off, 14 subjects (14.4%) had died in the all treated population. Overall 
survival data are yet to be mature enough to provide a reliable estimate for median OS. However, the 
estimated OS rates at 12 months were: 
All Treated population (n=97): 88.5% (95% CI: 80.2% to 93.5%) 
All Enrolled population (n=113): 81.3% (95% CI: 72.6% to 87.6%). 
-
At the 11 February 2021 data cut-off date, median overall survival (OS) has not been reached. The 12-
-
month OS rate was 87.6% (95% CI: 79.2% to 92.8%). While data continue to mature, available data 
suggests that there may be a positive association between depth of response and favourable PFS and 
OS. 
While data on PFS and OS are presented in the efficacy assessment, single arm trials in oncology are 
not suitable to ascertain a treatment effect on OS or PFS due to the lack of a comparator. Data on 
these endpoints are therefore not included in the PI. 
To contextualize the efficacy results, namely time to event endpoints, the applicant has reported real-
world data from the retrospective MAMMOTH study, a multi-centre, retrospective chart review study to 
investigate the natural history and outcomes of patients with MM refractory to CD38-mAb. Limitations 
of these type comparisons are noted and data is considered to be supportive. 
Only one subject was retreated. This subject initially progressed 511 days after the first cilta-cel 
infusion. The retreated subject developed new and worsening lytic disease and was diagnosed with PD 
32 days after retreatment. The value of retreatment with cilta-cel is uncertain in terms of benefit/risk. 
Only one patient has been retreated in study MMY2001. 
Seventeen subjects (17.5%) had PD after cilta-cel infusion. Eleven of these subjects received 
subsequent anti-myeloma therapy after disease progression. 
Health-related Quality of Life assessment revealed meaningful improvements for all analysed 
parameters.  
Regarding the proposed commercial manufacturing process, comparability of commercial product with 
clinical trial lots could not be fully established at the quality level. Currently, only few clinical data are 
available for patients treated with lots from the commercial process, supporting the efficacy of these 
lots but not excluding slight differences. Thus, further clinical data on clinical safety and efficacy for 
clinical LV and commercially representative LV treated patients are requested as a post-authorisation 
measure (REC). 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
Following the MO relating to the comprehensiveness of data and granting of a full marketing 
authorisation, the applicant submitted a request for a conditional marketing authorisation in the 
proposed indication. As main deficiencies for lack of comprehensiveness, limited patient numbers and 
duration of follow-up were listed. The package submitted by the applicant is considered to fulfil the 
requirements of a CMA. 
The applicant will submit the final data after 24 month follow up of the main study for this application 
(study CARTITUDE-1; MMY2001)(due date December 2022) and data from a Phase 3 randomised 
study comparing JNJ-68284528, a CAR-T therapy directed against BCMA vs PVd or DPd in subjects 
with relapsed and lenalidomide-refractory multiple myeloma (study CARTITUDE-4; MMY3002) expected 
to release final results by December 2026. In principle, these studies are considered suitable as 
specific obligations to the MA.

2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Cilta-cel showed clinically significant response rates in a heavily pre-treated RRMM population. Since 
the pivotal study had a single-arm design, the applicant provided a comparison with real world data 
that can be considered as supportive evidence. Besides the ORR data, sCR is also showing convincing 
results. 
However, due to the missing randomised control group, uncertainties about the actual treatment effect 
exists. The proposed indication would also cover RRMM patients with at least three, but in total fewer 
prior lines of treatment than in the MMY2001 trial. A similar efficacy may be anticipated in these less 
pre-treated patients. Additionally, MRD results also indicate that the majority of complete responders 
achieved deep responses to the therapy. 
The CAT considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
• 
In order to further characterise the long-term safety and efficacy of Carvykti in adult patients 
with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, who have received at least three prior 
therapies, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent and an anti-CD38 
antibody and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy the MAH shall submit 
the results of the long-term follow-up study for participants previously treated with 
ciltacabtagene autoleucel. (68284528MMY4002). Due date: June 2043. 
The CAT considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the 
context of a conditional MA:

such as CRS, neurotoxicity, cytopenia etc. can be regarded comparable to those 
reported for the trials MMY2001 and MMY2003. No additional safety concerns could be 
identified as of DCO 15 April 2021, no death cases were reported. 
No major changes and clinical relevant additional safety signals, respectively, could be identified in the 
presented clinical safety update in subjects treated within the ongoing trials, late breaking information 
on neurotoxicity as of DCO April 2021 included. 
2.6.8.2.  Adverse events  
MMY2001 
All subjects who received cilta-cel had at least one adverse event and all subjects experienced one or 
more grade 3 or 4 treatment emerged adverse event (TEAE). The most common reported ≥ grade 3 or 
4 TEAEs were cytopenias (neutropenia [95.9%], anaemia [81.4%], thrombocytopenia [79.4%], 
leukopenia [61.9%], and lymphopenia [52.6%]) and CRS (94.8%) along with hypoalbuminaemia 
(n=27; 27.8%), alanine transferase increase (n=24; 24.7%) and aspartate aminotransferase increase 
(n=28; 28.9%). They were observed more often during the first 4-8 weeks after infusion of cilta-cel in 
comparison to ≥ 8 weeks post-infusion.  
There were no additional subjects enrolled in the trial MMY2001 (pivotal cohort and Japan cohort), and 
there are no changes reported for the subjects treated with regard to incidence and grading of adverse 
events in general and TEAEs, CRS, ICANS, neurotoxicity, MNTs, (movement and neurocognitive

TEAEs), cytopenia, infections or adverse drug reactions in particular since the 01 September 2020 cut-
off date. 
Deaths 
As of the cut-off date for the clinical safety update, 21 subjects (21.6%) have died, which means an 
increase of 7 death cases (5 due to PD, 1 due acute myeloid leukemia on Day718 and 1 due to ascites 
on Day45) since 01 September 2020 initial cut-off. The provided narratives reveal no major concerns; 
the death case due to ascites is considered attributed to clinical complications. All deaths cases are 
reported for the pivotal cohort of MMY2001; no deaths were reported for the Japan cohort.  
Second Primary Malignancy (SPM) 
Three new cases have been reported in addition to the 7 subjects as of 01 September 2020. All SPM 
were considered not related to cilta-cel by investigator assessment. 
CRS 
Eighty-eight subjects (90.7%) received supportive treatment for CRS. The most commonly prescribed 
medications (>15% of subjects) used to treat CRS included: paracetamol (72.2%), tocilizumab 
(69.1%), cefepime (27.8%), sodium chloride solution (23.7%), dexamethasone (20.6%) and anakinra 
(18.6%). Six subjects (6.2%) required oxygen as a supportive measure to treat CRS.  
There was one Grade 5 CRS. This patient received tocilizumab, anakinra, cyclophosphamide, 
etanercept and methylprednisolone. Supportive oxygen was also needed. First onset of CRS was on 
Day 11 and was never recovered. The patient also presented Grade 4 sepsis which was ongoing at the 
date of death. 
Neurotoxicity 
ICANS 
Sixteen subjects (16.5%) had an ICANS event, which included symptoms of aphasia, slow speech, 
dysgraphia, encephalopathy, depressed level of consciousness, and confusional state. For 15 of these 
subjects ICANS occurred concurrent with CRS and for 1 subject ICANS occurred 4 days after recovery 
from CRS. Most of ICANS events were reported as grade 1 or 2. One subject experienced a grade 3/4 
event. All 16 subjects recovered. The median time from cilta-cel infusion to ICANS onset was 8 days 
and the median duration was 4 days. 
At the time of clinical cutoff, all 16 subjects who had experienced ICANS had recovered. All subjects 
who experienced ICANS also experienced CRS. Fifteen subjects experienced ICANS concurrent with 
CRS, and 1 subject experienced ICANS 4 days after the recovery of CRS.

After Cilta-cel Infusion; All Treated Analysis Set 
Other Neurotoxicity 
Twelve subjects (12.4%) experienced Other Neurotoxicity not defined as ICANS assessed by the 
Investigator. Reported symptoms and severity of these events were varying (disturbances in 
consciousness, coordination and balance disturbances, movement disorders, mental impairment 
disorders, cranial nerve disorders, and peripheral neuropathies. The median time from cilta-cel infusion 
to first onset of other neurotoxicities was 26.5 days. Eight subjects (8.2%) experienced Grade 3 or 4 
toxicities and 1 subject (1.0%) experienced a Grade 5 toxicity. At the time of clinical cut off, 6 of these 
12 cases had resolved, 5 cases had not yet resolved, and 1 case was fatal. 
Other Neurotoxicity Characterised by Movement and Neurocognitive Treatment-Emergent 
Five of the above reported 12 subjects experienced a similar presentation of movement and 
neurocognitive TEAEs, reported to progress to an inability to work or care for oneself. These events 
had a median onset of 27.0 days from cilta-cel infusion. At the time of the clinical cut off 1 subject had

recovered, 1 subject had ongoing symptoms but was recovering, and 3 subjects died (neurotoxicity, 
septic shock, and lung abscess) and had ongoing neurotoxicity at the time of death. An analysis in 
these 5 patients was performed in order to identify underlying common (risk) factors. The movement 
and neurocognitive TEAEs in these 5 subjects appear to be potentially associated with a combination of 
2 or more factors such as high tumour burden, prior Grade 2 or higher CRS, prior ICANS, and high 
CAR-T cell expansion and persistence. 
TLS 
Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) was observed in one subject (1.0%), experiencing a Grade 3 increase in 
blood creatinine and Grade 4 TLS. These events were determined to be very likely related to cilta-cel, 
and both resolved. 
Hypogammaglobulinaemia  
The total number of subjects with hypogammaglobulinaemia was n=11(11.3%). Twenty-three subjects 
(23.7%) received IVIG as prophylaxis and 16 subjects (16.5%) were treated as response to the AE 
hypogammaglobulinaemia. 
Infections 
Infections occurred in 56 subjects (57.7%), with 19 subjects (20%) experiencing Grade 3 or 4 
infections. Three subjects (3.1%) had Grade 5 infections (lung abscess, sepsis, and septic shock). 
Viral infections were reported for 22 subjects (22.7%), and bacterial infections were reported in 8 
subjects (8.2%) with the most common infectious agent being Staphylococcal bacteraemia in 2 
subjects (2.1%). Fungal infections and protozoal infections were reported in 1 subject (1.0%). 
Hepatitis B reactivation was not reported for any subject.  
Other Adverse Events 
Cytopenias 
Cytopenias were reported for all 97 subjects (100.0%) in the All Treated population. Ninety-six 
subjects (99.0%) reported 1 or more Grade 3 or 4 cytopenic adverse events. No subjects experienced 
Grade 5 cytopenic adverse events. Among these events, 3 subjects (3.1%) experienced serious 
thrombocytopenia, and one subject (1.0%) experienced serious neutropenia. Overall, febrile 
neutropenia was observed in 10 subjects (10.3%) with 4 subjects (4.1%) experiencing serious febrile 
neutropenia. 
There were 60 subjects with Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia after Day 1 (cilta-cel infusion), 40 
subjects (41.2% of the all treated population) had not recovered by Day 30. At Day 60, 25 subjects 
(25.8% of the all treated population) continued to experience Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia. 
There were 95 subjects with Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia after Day 1 (cilta-cel infusion), all but 29 
subjects (29.9% of the all treated population) had recovered by Day 30. At Day 60, 10 subjects 
(10.3% of the all treated population) continued to experience Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. There were 96 
subjects with Grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia after Day 1 (cilta-cel infusion), all but 12 subjects (12.4% of 
the all treated population) had recovered by Day 30. At Day 60, 8 subjects (8.2% of the all treated 
population) continued to experience Grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia. There were some subjects who had 
initially recovered from cytopenias and developed Grade 3-4 cytopenias after Day 60: 6 (6.2%) 
subjects with thrombocytopenia, 12 (12.4%) reporting neutropenia and 30 (30.9%) presenting 
lymphopenia. 
Hypersensitivity Reactions 
Assessment report  
EMA/594558/2022  
Page 109/146 
 
 
 
Hypersensitivity reactions related to cilta-cel were reported in 4 subjects (4.1%). These reactions, all 
Grade 1, included flushing (3 subjects [3.1%]), chest discomfort (2 subjects [2.1%]), tremor (1 
subject [1.0%]), tachycardia (1 subject [1.0%]), and wheezing (1 subject [1.0%]). All of these events 
resolved on the day of infusion. 
2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious TEAEs were reported for 53 subjects (54.6%) with grade 3 or 4 TEAEs reported for 29 subjects 
(29%). The most common serious adverse event and reported in more than 5 patients was CRS 
(n=20; 20.6%) along with pneumonia (n= 5; 5.2%), sepsis (n=5; 5.2%) and ICANS (n=5; 5.2%). For 
forty-two subjects (43.3%) serious TEAEs related to cilta-cel have been observed. Grade 4 TEAEs were 
reported for 84 subjects (86.6%). At the time of clinical cut off, 14 subjects (14.4%) in the all treated 
population had died. All of these deaths occurred more than 30 days after cilta-cel infusion (range 45 
to 694 days) and 2 were within 100 days of infusion. Six subjects (6.2%) experienced an adverse 
event with an outcome of death (Grade 5), all of which were deemed to be related to the study drug.

Creatinine Clearance 
After an increase as a result of the conditioning regimen, baseline mean creatinine clearance was 94.23 
mL/min/1.73m2. Mean creatinine clearance reached a nadir of 84.72 mL/min at Day 7. After an increase 
in values through Day 14 with a mean value of 93.70 mL/min/1.73m2 a second decline was observed by 
Day 100 toward recovery with a mean value 85.39 mL/min/1.73m2 (range 18.8 to 216.8). Nearly the 
same  trend  was  observed  with  the  laboratory  values  for  alanine  aminotransferase  and  the  infection 
parameters C-reactive protein and ferritin, while return to levels by Day 100 were more slowly.

Haematology 
Neutrophils 
After a decline as a result of the conditioning regimen, baseline mean neutrophils values were 1.191 
x109/L (range 0.11 to 3.60). Neutrophil counts reached an initial nadir of 0.932 x109/L at Day 7. After 
an increase in values through Day 14 with a mean value of 2.007 x109/L (range 0.00 to 13.17), a 
second decline was seen through Day 28 with a mean value 1.248 x109/L. By Day 100, values have 
returned to slightly above baseline levels.

Coagulation  
In 19 subjects (19.6%), fibrinogen has been measured, and 9 of them (47.4%) were within normal 
limits. One subject (5.3%) experienced a grade 2 decrease, 5 subjects (26.3%) a grade 3 decrease 
and 4 subjects (21.1%) a grade 4 decrease. Grade 5-decreses have not been observed.  
Activated partial thromboplastin time was assessed in 18 subjects (18.6%), and 11 of them (61.1%) 
were within normal limits. Six subjects (33.3%) experienced grade 1 prolonged activation time and 1 
subject (5.6%) a grade 3 prolonged activation time. Grade 4 or 5 events have not been observed.  
International Normalization Rate (INR) was assessed in 17 subjects (17.5%), and 11 of them (64.7%) 
were within normal limits. Four subjects (23.5%) experienced grade 1 increase and 2 subjects (11.8%) 
a grade 2 increase in INR. 
Lymphocytes 
After a decline in lymphocytes as a result of the lymphodepletion/conditioning regimen, baseline mean 
lymphocyte values were 0.077 x109/L. Lymphocyte values increased from baseline to a maximum 
mean value of 2.100 x109/L on Day 14 (range 0.0 to 25.92) followed by return to pre-conditioning 
values through Day 100.

2.6.8.5.  Safety in special populations (MMY2001) 
Results on adverse events, considering frequency and grading, were evaluated among the subgroups 
of gender, age, race, total CAR-positive T cells infused, and bone marrow % plasma cells at baseline. 
There were no clinically meaningful differences in subgroup analyses observed. Rates of AEs, grade 3 
and 4 AEs, and the occurrence of SAEs were similar. There is one exemption of patients (all within the 
phase 2 of MMY2001), who experienced the cluster of movement and neurocognitive TEAEs. Regarding 
sex, a slightly higher rate of SAEs was observed in male compared with female (59.6% vs. 47.5%, 
respectively), including SAEs of infections (26.3% vs. 15.0%), CRS (22.8% vs. 17.5%), ICANS (7% 
vs. 2.5%) and Parkinsonism (5.3% vs. 0). 
2.6.8.6.  Immunological events (MMY2001) 
Among the 97 subjects in the all-treated population of the pivotal cohort of MMY2001 (29 subjects in 
Phase 1b and 68 subjects in Phase 2), 15 subjects (15.5%) were measured positive for anti-cilta-cel 
antibodies (9 subjects [31.0%] in Phase 1b and 6 subjects [8.8%] in Phase 2). For the ADA-positive 
subjects, titers of anti-cilta-cel antiodies started to be detectable around the Day 100 post-infusion. 
There were no major differences observed in the kinetic of expansion of cilta-cel between patients with 
positive ADA and patients with negative ADA. no clear evidence of association between ADA and cilta-
cel persistence has been concluded.

2.6.8.7.  Discontinuation due to adverse events (MMY2001) 
There were a total of 30 discontinuations (26.5%), and the majority was attributed to PD. There was 
one adverse event of thrombocytopenia related to lymphodepletion and one case of cardiac arrest on 
day 14 post-apheresis, which both led to withdrawal of the respective patient. 
MMY2003 
Taking the all-treated population, which is larger (n=73), the overall summary of adverse events as of 
DCO 01February 2021 can be considered more or less in line with the reported adverse events as of 
prior safety cut-off for n=18 subjects.

Four subjects experienced treatment-emergent HLH, including 2 subjects for whom HLH was identified 
by the investigator as a serious symptom of CRS. HLH was the only serious symptom of CRS reported 
for more than 1 subject.  
All-grade CAR-T cell neurotoxicity was reported for 15 subjects (20.5%) in the clinical safety update. 
All-grade ICANS was reported for 8 subjects (11.0%). Seven of 8 subjects had concurrent CRS at the 
time of ICANS onset, and ICANS had resolved for 7 of 8 subjects at the time of clinical cutoff. 
Other Neurotoxicity not defined as ICANS was reported for 8 subjects (11.0%). At the time of the 
latest clinical cutoff for this Safety Update, 1 subject (1.4%) had movement and neurocognitive TEAEs 
characterised by bradykinesia, bradyphrenia, cognitive disorder, gait disturbance, and motor 
dysfunction in addition to serious encephalopathy. 
Sixty-five of the 73 subjects (89.0%) included in the clinical safety update experienced 1 or more 
Grade 3 or 4 cytopenia adverse events and 30 subjects experienced serious treatment-emergent 
cytopenias. Treatment-emergent infections were reported for 23 subjects (31.5%) and serious 
infections were reported for 8 subjects (11.0%).  
Five subjects had died as of the clinical cutoff for the clinical safety update: Three subjects experienced 
Grade 5 TEAEs (COVID-19 pneumonia, subarachnoid haemorrhage in the setting of angio-invasive 
aspergillosis, and C. difficile colitis. The subjects who died due to subarachnoid haemorrhage and C. 
difficile colitis both experienced HLH within 16 days of receiving cilta-cel infusion. A fourth subject 
experienced Grade 5 acute respiratory failure with onset on Day 161 in the setting of COVID-19 
infection. A fifth subject died due to disease progression. HLH All-grade CRS was reported for 57 
subjects (78.1%) in the updated analysis with Grade 3 and Grade 4 CRS reported for 1 subject (1.4%) 
and 2 subjects (2.7%), respectively. 
There were no cases of TLS or second primary malignancy.

2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The overall assessment of the safety profile of cilta-cel is based on n= 97 subjects (pivotal cohort) plus 
n=9 subjects (supportive cohort), having been treated in the clinical trial MMY2001, a phase 1b/2 
study, and on n=73 subjects treated in the supportive trial MMY2003, a phase 2 study. The median 
safety follow up for the 97 subjects in the pivotal cohort of the trial MMY2001 is 18 months. For the 
patients in the supportive Japanese cohort of MMY2001, the median safety FU is 8 months. The median 
safety follow-up for n=73 subjects treated in the supportive trial MMY2003 is the following: a median 
safety FU of 6 months for n=18 subjects and a median safety FU of more than 3 months for n= 51 
subjects. 
No specific critical issues have been identified in the safety profile of cilta-cel, which is reported to be in 
line with the one of the products in the same class. Most common adverse events documented were 
neutropenia (95.9%), anaemia (81.4%), thrombocytopenia (79.4%), leukopenia (61.9%) and 
lymphopenia (52.6%). Serious TEAEs (grade 3 or 4) have been reported for 53 subjects (54.6%). CRS 
and CAR T cell neurotoxicity (ICANS included) occurred in 94.8 % in the pivotal cohort of MMY2001 
and in the supportive cohort of MMY2001 and in the supportive trial MMY2003. For the characterised 
safety adverse events (CRS, neurotoxicity, cytopenia, infection, etc), routine risk minimisation 
measures and risk management is widely described in section 4.4 of the SmPC. No consistent trends in 
the profile of adverse events could be identified by age, gender and the other subgroup analysis. For 
subjects older than 65 years compared with younger subjects, adverse events have been reported with 
Assessment report  
EMA/594558/2022  
Page 119/146 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a slightly higher frequency. These were fatigue, oedema, confusional state and hypertension. These 
differences, however, currently do not allow for recommendations on dose adjustment for patients 
older than 65 years.  
The majority of TEAEs recovered without sequelae, and most of the subjects (n=88; 90.7%) received 
supportive treatment for CRS, with 70 subjects (72.2%) receiving paracetamol and 67 subjects 
(69.1%) receiving tocilizumab, 21 subjects (21.6%) receiving corticosteroids, and 18 subjects (18.6%) 
receiving anakinra. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics 
Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
With respect to (long-term) safety data on Carvykti further data are needed and will be provided 
according to SOBs, the long term follow up studies and the registry studies. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of cilta-cel can be regarded consistent with the current knowledge on CAR T cell 
therapy and related toxicities. Cilta-cel related adverse advents of CRS and neurotoxicity were 
common in both clinical trials MMY2001 and MMY2003, and most of them were graded mild to 
moderate. The AEs were generally manageable in the administered dose ranges of cilta-cel by 
following the management recommendations according to the guidance provided in the SmPC.  
The CAT considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
• 
In order to further characterise the long-term safety and efficacy of Carvykti in adult patients 
with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, who have received at least three prior 
therapies, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent and an anti-CD38 
antibody and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy the MAH shall submit 
the results of the long-term follow-up study for participants previously treated with 
ciltacabtagene autoleucel. Due date: June 2043 
• 
In order to further characterise the long-term safety of Carvykti in adult patients with relapsed 
and refractory multiple myeloma, who have received at least three prior therapies, including a 
proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent and an anti-CD38 antibody and have 
demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy the MAH shall conduct and submit the 
results of an observational post-authorisation safety study based on a registry. Due date:

refractory multiple myeloma, who have received at least three prior therapies, including a 
proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent and an anti-CD38 antibody and have

2.7.4.  Conclusion 
The CAT considers that the risk management plan version 1.6 is acceptable. 
The CHMP endorses the CAT conclusion on the RMP as described above.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance  
2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP and CAT considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant 
fulfils the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CAT/CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the 
PSUR cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 28th February 2022. The new EURD list 
entry will therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that ciltacabtagene autoleucel has not been previously authorised in a medicinal 
product in the European Union. 
The CAT/CHMP, based on the available data, consider ciltacabtagene autoleucel to be a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The applicant will submit the results of a user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet that meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of the label 
Assessment report  
EMA/594558/2022  
Page 132/146 
 
 
 
and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use prior to placing the product on the market. 
2.10.2.  Labelling exemptions 
A request of translation exemption of the labelling as per Art.63.1 of Directive 2001/83/EC has been 
submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group. The applicant specifically 
requested that in countries where there is a requirement to have more than one official EU language 
expressed in the product labelling, the text is provided in English only for the infusion bag label and 
outer cassette label. The package leaflet will however be provided in all EU official languages, as 
applicable. The applicant also confirmed that the Lot Information Sheet will be provided in the local 
language. The Group accepted the request due to the orphan status of the medicinal product and low 
prevalence of the disease, the fact that the medicinal product will not be delivered directly to the 
patient for self-administration, and the space constraints encountered on the immediate and outer 
labels. As part of the outcome the applicant was made aware that in Maltese the outer carton, labelling 
and package leaflet could also be distributed in English, in order to facilitate the logistics. 
The labelling subject to translation exemption as per the QRD Group decision above will however be 
translated in all languages in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, but the printed 
materials will only be translated in the language(s) as agreed by the QRD Group. 
2.10.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Carvykti (ciltacabtagene autoleucel) is 
included in the additional monitoring list as: 
• 
• 
• 
It contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU; 
It has a PASS imposed either at the time of authorisation or afterwards; [REG Art 9(4)(cb), 
Art 10a(1)(a), DIR Art 21a(b), Art 22a(1)(a)]; 
It is approved under a conditional marketing authorisation [REG Art 14-a] 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Carvykti is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, 
who have received at least three prior therapies, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome 
inhibitor and an anti-CD38 antibody and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/594558/2022  
Page 133/146 
 
 
 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Despite multiple therapeutic options, multiple myeloma remains incurable. All patients eventually 
relapse and become refractory to existing treatments.  
The choice of therapy in the relapse setting depends on several parameters such as age, performance 
status, comorbidities, the type, response and tolerance to the previous treatment, the number of prior 
treatment lines, the remaining available treatment options, the interval since the last therapy and the 
type of relapse (i.e. clinical versus biochemical relapse; in the case of biochemical relapse, treatment 
can be delayed). 
Treatment of RRMM patients who received two or more prior lines of therapy is becoming challenging 
(Dimoupoulos, 2015). For patients who have been exposed or are refractory to both bortezomib and 
lenalidomide, and have not received a mAb, Dara-Kd or Isa-Kd are suitable options. 
The combinations of elotuzumab or isatuximab with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (EloPd and 
IsaPd, respectively) are suitable options for patients who have failed to >2 lines of previous therapies, 
including lenalidomide and a PI. The combination of daratumumab with pomalidomide and 
dexamethasone (DaraPd) is also a suitable option for patients who have failed >2 lines of previous 
therapies, including lenalidomide and a PI. 
For triple-class refractory patients, selinexor-dexamethasone (Sd) or belantamab-mafodotin 
monotherapy may be suitable options.  
The reported overall response rate (ORR) for approved therapies for the population of heavily pre-
treated and refractory patients with multiple myeloma, is approximately 30% (not including CARt cell 
treatment). 
With each successive relapse, symptoms return, quality of life worsens, and the chance and duration of 
response typically decreases. There is therefore an unmet medical need for more treatment options 
capable of achieving deep and durable responses that afford the opportunity for treatment-free 
intervals and improved quality of life (QoL) for patients with RR MM who have received ≥3 prior 
therapies, including an immunomodulatory agent, a PI, and an anti-CD38 mAb. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study MMY2001 is a Phase 1b-2, single arm, open-label, multicentre study investigating the safety and 
efficacy of cilta-cel in adult subjects with RRMM who had measurable disease at screening; had 
received at least 3 prior lines of therapy or are double refractory to a PI and an IMiD; received a PI, an 
IMiD, and anti-CD38 antibody; and had documented disease progression during, or within 12 months 
of their most recent anti-myeloma therapy. The study was conducted within the United States. 
Subjects who satisfied all study inclusion and exclusion criteria during the Screening Phase were 
considered eligible for the study. Study intervention then comprised 3 steps: apheresis for collection of 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells, conditioning with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, and infusion 
of cilta-cel. Subjects were considered enrolled at the time of apheresis and were assessed before each 
of these steps to ensure that he or she remained eligible to continue intervention. 
Eligible subjects underwent apheresis for collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) on 
the day of study enrolment. Subjects could receive bridging therapy if clinically indicated to maintain 
disease stability while cilta-cel manufacturing was underway. After notification by the sponsor that 
manufacture and quality testing of cilta-cel had been completed, eligible subjects received a 
conditioning regimen of intravenous (IV) cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 and fludarabine 30 mg/m2 in 
Assessment report

3 daily doses. Five to 7 days after the start of the conditioning regimen, cilta-cel was administered as a 
single infusion with a total targeted dose of 0.75 x 106 CAR-positive viable T cells/kg (range: 0.5-1.0 x 
106 CAR-positive viable T cells/kg). 
The primary efficacy endpoint was ORR defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve a partial 
response (PR) or better as assessed by the Independent Review Committee (IRC) and based on 
International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria. Secondary efficacy endpoints were very good 
partial response (VGPR) or better rate (defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved a stringent 
complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), or VGPR as assessed by the IRC and based on 
IMWG response criteria), DOR, MRD negativity rate, time to response, PFS and OS.  
The reported data in the current assessment report came from the data cutoff date of 1 
September/2020, which corresponds to a time point 6 months after the last subject received his or her 
initial dose of cilta-cel. At the time of clinical cut off the median duration of follow-up for all subjects 
was 12.42 months.  
An updated efficacy analysis has been also provided as of the clinical cut-off of 11 February/2021, the 
median duration of follow-up was 18.0 months (range: 1.5 months [subject died] to 30.5 months). The 
study will be completed 2 years after the last subject has received his or her initial dose of cilta-cel. 
The cut-off defining success was set at ORR >50% and contextualisation of the data was provided in 
terms of an adjusted, indirect treatment comparison to an external control arm, based on a global, 
non-interventional, retrospective study (MAMMOTH study). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In a median duration of follow-up of 18 months as per the second data cut off provided during the 
assessment, the primary endpoint was met with an ORR of 84.1% (95% CI: 76.0% to 90.3%) for the 
ITT population with 95 of 113 (ITT) subjects achieving a partial response (PR) or better as assessed by 
Independent Review Committee (IRC; based on International Myeloma Working Group [IMWG] 
criteria) and 97.9% (95% CI: 92.7% to 99.7%) for the mITT population.  
Clinically meaningful activity was also observed for key secondary efficacy endpoints:  
•  VPGR or better rate was 81.4% (95% CI: 73.0% to 88.1%) for the ITT and 94.8% (95% CI: 
88.4% to 98.3%) for the mITT population, whereas sCR was 69.0% (95% CI: 59.6% to 
77.4%) for the ITT and sCR: 80.4% (95% CI: 71.1% to 87.8%) for the mITT population.  
•  Responses were durable with median duration of response (DoR) was 21.8 months (95% CI: 
21.8 months, not estimable [NE]).  
•  Responses were rapid; the median time to first response was 0.95 months and a median time 
to best response was 2.56 months.  
•  MRD negativity at 10-5 threshold of sensitivity: 57.7% (N=56) with 34.0% (N=33) also 
achieving MRD negative CR/sCR.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Data were collected in a small, single arm trial. This poses well know limitations with regards to 
interpretation of data, in particular with regards to assessment of time to event endpoints.  
Clinical experience with cilta-cel is limited in terms of study size (97 subjects in the Phase 1b/2 Study 
MMY2001) and duration of follow-up (median 12.42 months; range: 1.5 months [subject died] to 24.9 
months). In the context of the conditional marketing authorisation, additional information will be 
collected from the imposed studies as specific obligations.

Of  note  mainly  young  patients  with  a  good  performance  (ECOG  PS  0-1)  were  recruited  in  the  study, 
which  raises  concern  with  regards  to  the  external  validity  of  data  generated  and  extrapolation  to  the 
overall population of patients with relapse and refractory MM in clinical practice.  
The evaluation of MRD negativity is impacted by the fact that not all subjects had evaluable samples.  
Regarding the proposed commercial manufacturing process, comparability of commercial product with 
clinical trial lots could not be fully established at the quality level. Currently, only few clinical data are 
available for patients treated with lots from the commercial process, supporting the efficacy of these 
lots but not excluding slight differences. Additional data on such regards will be provided post 
authorisation through a post authorisation (REC) submission. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Unfavourable effects of Carvykti correspond to the safety profile in the class of products; adequate risk 
minimisations and risk management have been included in the SmPC and the RMP in line with the 
expect safety profile of the product. 
At least one TEAE any grade has been reported for the majority of subjects in MMY2001 and MMY2003. 
CRS was common, but most cases were documented as grade 1 or 2. Grade 3-4 CRS was reported in 
only 4 (4.1%) subjects. 
Serious adverse events were reported for 53 subjects (54.6%) with Grade 3 or 4 serious adverse 
events reported in 29 subjects (29.9%). Six patients died due to treatment-related adverse events. 
Cases of neurotoxicity, ICANS and other neurotoxicity summarised, occurred in 20.6% of the subjects. 
Aside from ICANS, a specific cluster of symptoms of neurotoxicity was observed in 5/12 subjects.  
patients. Symptoms included changes in movement (micrographia, tremors, etc.), cognitive functions 
(memory loss, disturbance in attention, etc.) and personality (reduced facial expression, flat affect, 
etc.), resulting in their inability to work. The data on those adverse events are not yet sufficient to 
draw solid conclusion, and the identified MNT will be further pursued as postauthorisation measures in 
the imposed safety and efficacy studies for the Conditional Marketing Authorisation. The number of 
deaths has increased by additional 7 patients since last DCO 20 September 2020, most of them due to 
PD.  
Sixteen (16.5%) subjects experienced ICANS.  Of these, there was 1 Grade 3 and 1 Grade 4 adverse 
event. The median time to onset of ICANS was of 8 days (range: 3, 12) with a median duration of 4 
days (range: 1; 12). At the time of the DCO all events had resolved. In all cases ICANS was concurrent 
with CRS (15 patients) or occurred after CRS (1 patient; 4 days after CRS). All patients received 
treatment for ICANS, such as corticosteroids, anakinra and tocilizumab 
Pancytopenia ≥grade 3 or 4 was observed in nearly all patients and considered related to the 
treatment. The exact mechanism that leads to pancytopenia remains elusive, but may be related to 
conditioning as well as cilta-cel. 
Infections were reported by 56 (57.7%) subjects. For 19 (19.6%) subjects, these were of Grade 3-4 
severity and Grade 5 infections were reported by 3 (3.1%) subjects, as discussed above. Viral 
infections were more commonly reported than bacterial infections (22.7% vs. 8.2%) although the 
latest seemed more severe. 
All cases of second primary malignancy events have been assessed as not related to cilta-cel by the 
investigators.  
According to the PD data, the overall incidence of antibodies to cilta-cel was 15.5%. Based on the 
current data, there was no clear evidence to suggest an association between ADA and cilta-cel kinetics 
of initial expansion and persistence, efficacy, or safety.

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The clinical safety data has been increased as described by both number of patients treated and follow-
up periods, and may be considered sufficient for granting conditional marketing authorisation provided 
the current outstanding issues are addressed in a satisfactory manner. However, the fact remains that 
the cilta-cel safety profile is mainly based only on Study MMY2001, a single arm trial in heavily treated 
population and patients going through apheresis and conditioning regimen, even bridging therapy for a 
high percentage of subjects (75.3%).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Despite multiple and increasing available therapeutic options, MM remains incurable and all patients 
finally relapse. With each relapse, the chance and duration of response typically decreases, and the 
disease becomes refractory to the existing treatments. It is acknowledged that there is a significant 
unmet need for new therapeutic options that can achieve a better control of the disease; provide 
deeper, more sustained responses; and yield better long-term outcomes including maintenance of QoL. 
In this scenario, treatment with single infusion cilta-cel among the heavily pre-treated population of 
subjects in study MMY2001 showed efficacy with 84.1% of ORR in the ITT population (which includes 
16 subjects who did not receive cilta-cel).  
The reported ORR across multiple clinically relevant subgroups, including age, was consistent with that 
in the overall study population. Responses were durable, with a median DoR of 21.8 months; median 
follow up time for DoR of 18 months. Time to response was rapid and the depth of response in the ITT 
population was also notable for this highly refractory patient population.  
However, even if an outstanding rate of durable responses with cilta-cel has been achieved in a heavily 
pre-treated RR MM population a number of uncertainties remain. This mainly relate to a limited sample 
size in the context of an uncontrolled pivotal trial hampering assessment of clinically relevant (long-
term) outcomes and interpretation of subgroups. In addition, follow-up is not long, including for 
assessment of safety, and for a better understanding/estimation of reported results. 
Characterisation of cilta-cel safety profile based mainly on the results of Study MMY2001 is 
challenging: the single arm trial design, a heavily treated population and patients going through 
apheresis and conditioning regimen, even bridging therapy for a high percentage of subjects (75.3%), 
hamper any data interpretation. Therefore, it is not feasible to differentiate post-infusion toxicity of 
cilta-cel from adverse events related to previous therapies or the conditioning regimen. 
Another point to consider, as previously noted, is that overall, the safety population was comprised by 
relatively young patients with a good performance status, which raises concerns of the external validity 
of this data and the extrapolation to the overall population of patients with relapse and refractory MM 
in clinical practice, were no such strict restrictions can always be done. 
Overall, the currently reported safety profile of cilta-cel, provided updated safety information included, 
is generally consistent with the current understanding of the mechanism of action of CAR T therapies. 
CRS was common but most cases were low grade and seemed to have been managed effectively with 
supportive therapy. CAR-T cell neurotoxicity, including ICANS and other neurotoxicity, was reported in 
20.6% of subjects. However, a longer follow-up is still being needed to support the safety findings. 
Development of second primary malignancies (SPM) is also a major concern with CAR-T treatment. Up 
to now, none of them reported in the clinical trials has been assessed related to cilta-cel.   
In this regard, a 15-year follow-up of patients that have been included in the clinical trial in a long-
term follow-up study (68284528-MMY4002) and the conduct and submission of the results of an 
observational post-authorisation safety study (68284528MMY4004) together with the conduct and 
submission of the results of a post-authorisation safety study to evaluate the long-term safety of 
patients treated with ciltacabtagene autoleucel (68284528MMY4009) have been proposed. 
Comments received from HCP and patients are appreciated and consider that the primary and 
secondary objectives for the long-term FU studies MMY4002 and MMY4004, in essence, are considered 
Assessment report  
EMA/594558/2022 
Page 140/146 
 
 
 
acceptable. Specific recommendations expressed inter alia were inclusion of ‘physical and neurological 
examination’ in the follow-up measurements among ECOG performance status and validated quality of 
life measurements in order to assess long-term effect of neurotoxicity/ICANS/CRS, when earlier 
occurred. Further requirements expressed, are assessment of the effect of cilta-cel on comorbid 
conditions such as extramedular metastases/plasmocytoma as additional objective and inclusion of 
haematologic disorders and infection any grade (and not only grade 3 and 4) in the list of ‘new 
incidence of adverse events’. Those additional requirements are addressed in the LOI, as continuous 
and comprehensive assessment of long-term consequences of prior CRS, neurotoxicity and ICANS on 
patients having been treated with cilta-cel is of clinical importance. However, the proposed clinical trial 
protocols, and reporting of SAEs, will have to be further evaluated in the context of the applicant’s 
response. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Cilta-cel treatment leads to relevant response rates, which appear similar to a recently approved 
product and are much higher than the response rates reported with other current standard of care or 
in the literature. ORR, sCR or MDR negativity responses seem to be compelling and are considered 
clinically meaningful. Responses seem to be durable, however, uncertainty remains regarding the true 
magnitude and the duration of these effects, related to the uncontrolled trial, the limited patient 
numbers and the limited follow-up.  
Based on the pivotal cohort of MMY2001, the safety profile of cilta-cel overall appears to be acceptable 
in view of the therapeutic context, the observed benefits, and the fact that any remaining uncertainties 
are being addressed in the long-term follow-up studies. Even if in clinical practice the toxicity could be 
slightly higher, this is not expected to change the main conclusions. Although the majority of the 
adverse effects are likely to occur during the first months of treatment, delayed immunological 
responses and secondary expansion cannot be ruled out without sufficient safety data. For the long-
term safety, studies are proposed to further characterise the incidence and severity of selected adverse 
drug reactions. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
This application is based on a single arm trial which has been accepted for the purpose of MAA in 
scientific advice. Nevertheless, the evidence for efficacy generated in a single arm trial is less robust 
and subject to different types of bias, most notably selection bias. It is accepted that randomised trials 
are difficult to conduct in late line therapeutic setting as is the case here. Based on the observed data 
it is expected that this estimate for efficacy is reasonably precise for the studied population, but quite 
possibly biased. Even though ORR is accepted as an endpoint for regulatory purposes the ultimate 
patient benefit as reflected in OS cannot be reliably determined in a single arm trial. While some of the 
reported endpoints (ORR, sCR, MRD) suggest a significant efficacy of the therapy, the duration of 
efficacy cannot be fully estimated, as the efficacy follow-up is short and further data are required to 
estimate this aspect. As regards safety, several issues were identified that are still under further 
scrutiny. Although the subgroup analyses are reassuring, there is the observation that patients with 
good prognostic characteristics constitute the majority of the study population. From an efficacy 
perspective the main uncertainties therefore lie in the area of external validity with a small and a 
selected trial population. MoA is well understood and there are no doubts on causality of effects. There 
is a good understanding of the natural history of the disease. Historical data have been provided to put 
the trial data into context.  While the results need to be interpreted with caution due to several 
limitations, the comparison of effects with real world data provides some further perspectives and adds 
additional context to interpret the findings. In summary the data provided for MA are not regarded as 
Assessment report  
EMA/594558/2022 
Page 141/146 
 
 
 
comprehensive with respect to the duration of efficacy, and the exposure and length of follow-up for 
safety. 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available, a conditional marketing authorisation was 
proposed by the CAT/CHMP during the assessment, after having consulted the applicant, and the 
applicant submitted a formal request during the assessment. 
The product falls within the scope of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 concerning 
conditional marketing authorisations, as it aims at the treatment of a life-threatening disease. In 
addition, the product is designated as an orphan medicinal product.  
Furthermore, the CAT considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
authorisation: 
•  The benefit-risk balance is positive, as discussed above. 
• 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data by post-approval 
specific obligations as follow: 
As main deficiencies for lack of comprehensiveness, limited patient numbers and duration of 
follow-up were listed and the two ongoing studies (CARTITUDE-1 (MMY2001) and CARTITUDE-
4 (MMY3002)) will indeed provide further longer-term efficacy and safety data and will also 
consolidate efficacy outcome. Furthermore, in the ongoing phase 3 trials considering the 
enlargement of the number of subjects treated with Carvykti in a clinical study setting and the 
comparative nature of the study should provide more solid time-to-event outcomes in the 
proposed indication.  
The following 2 ongoing studies are agreed to provide the necessary information in a 
reasonable time frame. The wording of the SOBs is as described below:

In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of Carvykti in adult patients with relapsed 
and refractory multiple myeloma, who have received at least three prior therapies, 
including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent and an anti-CD38 
antibody and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy, the MAH 
should submit the final study results of the pivotal study CARTITUDE-1 (MMY2001). 
Expected date for submission is 31 December 2022 
In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of Carvykti in adult patients with relapsed 
and refractory multiple myeloma, who have received at least three prior therapies, 
including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent and an anti-CD38 
antibody and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy, the MAH 
should submit the results of the Phase 3 study CARTITUDE-4 (MMY3002). Expected 
date for submission is 31 December 2026 
•  Unmet medical needs will be addressed as follow: it is agreed that although there are 
authorised treatments of MM in the EU, all patients with this disease will eventually relapse 
after initial response and require further therapy. In patients who have received at least 3 prior 
therapies, and are refractory to at least one iMID, one PI, and one anti-CD38 antibody, there 
are available treatment options with a different mechanism of action, e.g. belantamab 
mafodotin or selinexor. These options, however, offer limited clinical benefit and the unmet 
medical need can be agreed. In the setting where patients are not triple refractory, the greater 
availability and efficacy of SOC treatment options with a different mechanism of action 
introduces higher uncertainty as to the true magnitude of cilta-cel effect. Nevertheless, the 
response rates achieved with cilta-cel in such less refractory patients seem compelling and 
major therapeutic advantage of cilta-cel can be considered demonstrated by providing a 
treatment alternative acting through a different mechanism of action and a distinct safety

profile. In this context, it is noted that the observed response rate and duration of response 
with cilta-cel is also expected to address the unmet medical need in the targeted patient 
population to a similar extent than idecabtagene vicleucel (Abecma) i.e. the first genetically 
modified autologous immunotherapy consisting of human T cells transduced with lentiviral 
vector (LVV) encoding a CAR that recognises BCMA, which is conditionally authorized in the EU 
for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who have 
received at least three prior therapies, including an iMID, a PI and an anti-CD38 antibody and 
have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. 
•  The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the 
fact that additional data are still required. As benefit-risk balance on basis of the current data 
is regarded positive, an additional therapy option for RR multiple myeloma patients with three 
or more previous systemic therapies is considered beneficial. 
The CHMP endorses the CAT conclusion on conditional marketing authorisation as described above.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Carvykti is positive, subject to the specific obligations and conditions imposed for 
the approved Conditional Marketing Authorisation in order to obtain further clinical data to generate a 
comprehensive clinical data set and inform the long-term efficacy and safety profile of the product.  
The CHMP endorses the CAT conclusion on Benefit Risk balance as described above  
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CAT by consensus decision is of the opinion that Carvykti is not similar to Darzalex, Farydak, 
Imnovid, Kyprolis, Ninlaro, Blenrep and Abecma within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission 
Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000.  
The CHMP endorses the CAT conclusion on similarity as described above.  
Outcome 
Based on the CAT review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CAT considers by consensus 
decision that the benefit- risk balance of Carvykti is favourable in the following indication(s): 
CARVYKTI is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple 
myeloma, who have received at least three prior therapies, including an immunomodulatory agent, a 
proteasome inhibitor and an anti-CD38 antibody and have demonstrated disease progression on the 
last therapy.  
The CAT therefore recommends the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation subject to the 
following conditions: 
Based on the draft CHMP opinion adopted by the CAT and the review of data on quality, safety and 
efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the benefit- risk balance of Carvykti in the treatment 
of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, who have received at least three prior 
therapies, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor and an anti-CD38 antibody 
and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy is favourable and therefore 
recommends the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation subject to the following

Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
•  Additional risk minimisation measures  
Controlled distribution programme and availability of tocilizumab 
To minimise the risks of CRS (including HLH) and neurotoxicity (including ICANS and other 
neurotoxicity) associated with the treatment of Carvykti the MAH will ensure that centres that dispense 
Carvykti are qualified in accordance with the agreed controlled distribution programme by:  
• 
ensuring immediate, on-site access to one dose of tocilizumab per patient prior to Carvykti infusion. 
The treatment centre must have access to an additional dose of tocilizumab within 8 hours of each 
previous dose. In the exceptional case where tocilizumab is not available due to a shortage that is 
listed in the European Medicines Agency shortage catalogue, the MAH will ensure that suitable 
alternative measures to treat CRS instead of tocilizumab are available on-site.  
Carvykti will only be supplied to centres that are qualified and only if the Healthcare professional (HCP) 
involved in the treatment of a patient has completed the HCP educational programme. 
Educational programme: Prior to the launch of Carvykti in each Member State the MAH must agree the 
content and format of the educational materials with the National Competent Authority. 
HCP educational programme 
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where Carvykti is marketed, all HCPs who are expected 
to prescribe, dispense, and administer Carvykti shall be provided with guidance:

to increase awareness of CRS (including HLH) and neurotoxicity (including ICANS and other 
neurotoxicity) and its appropriate monitoring, prevention, and management, including the 
importance of on-site availability of tocilizumab before treating a patient.  
to facilitate patient counseling relevant information. 
on reporting these serious adverse reactions associated with Carvykti. 
before treating a patient, to ensure that tocilizumab for each patient is available on site; in the 
exceptional case where tocilizumab is not available due to a shortage that is listed in the European 
Medicines Agency shortage catalogue, ensure that suitable alternative measures to treat CRS are 
available on site 
Medicinal product handling training 
The MAH shall ensure that all HCPs and other personnel involved in the transport, storage, thawing, 
preparation, or handling of Carvykti shall be provided training: 
• 
to increase awareness of the important potential risk of decrease in cell viability due to 
inappropriate handling or preparation of the medicinal product. 
to provide guidance on precautions to take before handling or administering Carvykti (i.e., how to 
check the medicinal product prior to administration, how to thaw, and how to administer). 
• 
Patient educational programme  
To inform and explain to patients:  
• 
the risks of CRS (including HLH) and neurotoxicity (including ICANS and other neurotoxicity) 
associated with Carvykti and increase awareness of symptoms requiring immediate medical 
attention. 
the need to carry the patient alert card at all times and share it with any HCP providing care 
(including emergency) so the HCP can contact the CAR-T treating HCP.

The CHMP endorses the CAT conclusion on the specific obligation to complete post-authorisation 
measures for the conditional marketing authorisation as described above.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the review of available data on the active substance, the CAT considers that 
ciltacabtagne autoleucel is to be qualified as a new active substance in itself as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.  
The CHMP endorses the CAT conclusion on the new active substance status claim.

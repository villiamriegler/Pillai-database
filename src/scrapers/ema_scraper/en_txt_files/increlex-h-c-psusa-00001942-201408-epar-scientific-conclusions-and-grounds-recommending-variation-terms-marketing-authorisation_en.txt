Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for mecasermin, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
A search of the MAHs Global Safety Database cumulative to 20 January 2015 identified 1 unique case 
of treatment emergent femoral epiphysiolysis and 3 unique cases of treatment emergent avascular 
necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head. 
Given (i) the medical importance of AVN, (ii) that AVN is a recognised complication of slipped capital 
femoral epiphysis (SCFE), (iii) that the risk of SCFE is higher in patients with growth hormone (GH) 
abnormalities, (iv) and that both SCFE and AVN are noted in Section 4.4 Special warnings and 
precautions for use and/or Section 4.8 Undesirable effects of UK SmPCs for human Growth Hormone, 
it is considered necessary to revise the wording of Section 4.4 of the EU SmPC. 
Therefore, in view of available data regarding mecasermin, the PRAC considered that changes to the 
product information were warranted.  
Furthermore, the MAH is asked to address this issue in the relevant sections of the EU RMP in the 
next regulatory procedure affecting the RMP. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for mecasermin the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product containing mecasermin is favourable subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

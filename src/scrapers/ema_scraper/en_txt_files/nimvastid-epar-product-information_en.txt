CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Symptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe Alzheimer’s dementia.
Symptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe dementia in patients with idiopathic Parkinson’s 
disease.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and 
treatment of Alzheimer’s dementia or dementia associated with Parkinson’s disease.
Diagnosis should be made according to current guidelines. Therapy with rivastigmine should only be 
started if a caregiver is available who will regularly monitor intake of the medicinal product by the 
patient.
2
Posology
Rivastigmine should be administered twice a day, with morning and evening meals. The capsules 
should be swallowed whole.
Initial dose
1.5 mg twice a day.
Dose titration
The starting dose is 1.5 mg twice a day. If this dose is well tolerated after a minimum of two weeks of 
treatment, the dose may be increased to 3 mg twice a day. Subsequent increases to 4.5 mg and then 
6 mg twice a day should also be based on good tolerability of the current dose and may be considered 
after a minimum of two weeks of treatment at that dose level.
If adverse reactions (e.g. nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or loss of appetite), weight decrease or 
worsening of extrapyramidal symptoms (e.g. tremor) in patients with dementia associated with 
Parkinson’s disease are observed during treatment, these may respond to omitting one or more doses. 
If adverse reactions persist, the daily dose should be temporarily reduced to the previous well-tolerated 
dose or the treatment may be discontinued.
Maintenance dose
The effective dose is 3 to 6 mg twice a day; to achieve maximum therapeutic benefit patients should 
be maintained on their highest well tolerated dose. The recommended maximum daily dose is 6 mg 
twice a day.
Maintenance treatment can be continued for as long as a therapeutic benefit for the patient exists.
Therefore, the clinical benefit of rivastigmine should be reassessed on a regular basis, especially for 
patients treated at doses less than 3 mg twice a day. If after 3 months of maintenance dose treatment 
the patient’s rate of decline in dementia symptoms is not altered favourably, the treatment should be 
discontinued. Discontinuation should also be considered when evidence of a therapeutic effect is no 
longer present.
Individual response to rivastigmine cannot be predicted. However, a greater treatment effect was seen 
in Parkinson’s disease patients with moderate dementia. Similarly a larger effect was observed in 
Parkinson’s disease patients with visual hallucinations (see section 5.1).
Treatment effect has not been studied in placebo-controlled trials beyond 6 months.
Re-initiation of therapy
If treatment is interrupted for more than three days, it should be re-initiated at 1.5 mg twice daily. 
Dose titration should then be carried out as described above.
Renal and hepatic impairment
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate renal or hepatic impairment. 
However, due to increased exposure in these populations dosing recommendations to titrate according to 
individual tolerability should be closely followed as patients with clinically significant renal or hepatic 
impairment might experience more dose-dependent adverse reactions. Patients with severe hepatic 
impairment have not been studied, however, Nimvastid capsules may be used in this patient population 
provided close monitoring is exercised (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).
Paediatric population
There is no relevant use of Nimvastid in the paediatric population in the treatment of Alzheimer’s 
disease.
4.3 Contraindications
The use of this medicinal product is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the active 
3
substance rivastigmine, to other carbamate derivatives or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
Previous history of application site reactions suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis with rivastigmine 
patch (see section 4.4).
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
The incidence and severity of adverse reactions generally increase with higher doses. If treatment is 
interrupted for more than three days, it should be re-initiated at 1.5 mg twice daily to reduce the 
possibility of adverse reactions (e.g. vomiting).
Skin application site reactions may occur with rivastigmine patch and are usually mild or moderate in 
intensity. These reactions are not in themselves an indication of sensitisation. However, use of 
rivastigmine patch may lead to allergic contact dermatitis.
Allergic contact dermatitis should be suspected if application site reactions spread beyond the patch 
size, if there is evidence of a more intense local reaction (e.g. increasing erythema, oedema, papules, 
vesicles) and if symptoms do not significantly improve within 48 hours after patch removal. In these 
cases, treatment should be discontinued (see section 4.3).
Patients who develop application site reactions suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis to rivastigmine 
patch and who still require rivastigmine treatment should only be switched to oral rivastigmine after 
negative allergy testing and under close medical supervision. It is possible that some patients 
sensitised to rivastigmine by exposure to rivastigmine patch may not be able to take rivastigmine in 
any form.
There have been rare post-marketing reports of patients experiencing allergic dermatitis 
(disseminated) when administered rivastigmine irrespective of the route of administration (oral, 
transdermal). In these cases, treatment should be discontinued (see section 4.3).
Patients and caregivers should be instructed accordingly.
Dose titration: Adverse reactions (e.g. hypertension and hallucinations in patients with Alzheimer’s 
dementia and worsening of extrapyramidal symptoms, in particular tremor, in patients with dementia 
associated with Parkinson’s disease) have been observed shortly after dose increase. They may 
respond to a dose reduction. In other cases, rivastigmine has been discontinued (see section 4.8).
Gastrointestinal disorders such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea are dose-related, and may occur 
particularly when initiating treatment and/or increasing the dose (see section 4.8). These adverse 
reactions occur more commonly in women. Patients who show signs or symptoms of dehydration 
resulting from prolonged vomiting or diarrhoea can be managed with intravenous fluids and dose 
reduction or discontinuation if recognised and treated promptly. Dehydration can be associated with 
serious outcomes.
Patients with Alzheimer’s disease may lose weight. Cholinesterase inhibitors, including rivastigmine, 
have been associated with weight loss in these patients. During therapy patient’s weight should be 
monitored.
In case of severe vomiting associated with rivastigmine treatment, appropriate dose adjustments as 
recommended in section 4.2 must be made. Some cases of severe vomiting were associated with 
oesophageal rupture (see section 4.8). Such events appeared to occur particularly after dose increments 
or high doses of rivastigmine.
Electrocardiogram QT prolongation may occur in patients treated with certain cholinesterase inhibitor 
products including rivastigmine. Rivastigmine may cause bradycardia which constitutes a risk factor 
in the occurrence of torsade de pointes, predominantly in patients with risk factors. Caution is advised 
in patients with pre-existing, or a family history of, QTc prolongation or at higher risk of developing 
4
torsade de pointes; for example, those with uncompensated heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, 
bradyarrhythmias, a predisposition to hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia, or concomitant use with 
medicinal products known to induce QT prolongation and/or torsade de pointes. Clinical monitoring 
(ECG) may also be required (see sections 4.5 and 4.8).
Care must be taken when using rivastigmine in patients with sick sinus syndrome or conduction 
defects (sino-atrial block, atrio-ventricular block) (see section 4.8).
Rivastigmine may cause increased gastric acid secretions. Care should be exercised in treating patients 
with active gastric or duodenal ulcers or patients predisposed to these conditions.
Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or 
obstructive pulmonary disease.
Cholinomimetics may induce or exacerbate urinary obstruction and seizures. Caution is recommended 
in treating patients predisposed to such diseases.
The use of rivastigmine in patients with severe dementia of Alzheimer’s disease or associated with
Parkinson’s disease, other types of dementia or other types of memory impairment (e.g. age-related 
cognitive decline) has not been investigated and therefore use in these patient populations is not 
recommended.
Like other cholinomimetics, rivastigmine may exacerbate or induce extrapyramidal symptoms.
Worsening (including bradykinesia, dyskinesia, gait abnormality) and an increased incidence or 
severity of tremor have been observed in patients with dementia associated with Parkinson’s disease 
(see section 4.8). These events led to the discontinuation of rivastigmine in some cases (e.g. 
discontinuations due to tremor 1.7% on rivastigmine vs 0% on placebo). Clinical monitoring is 
recommended for these adverse reactions.
Special populations
Patients with clinically significant renal or hepatic impairment might experience more adverse reactions 
(see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Dosing recommendations to titrate according to individual tolerability must be 
closely followed. Patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied. However, Nimvastid 
may be used in this patient population and close monitoring is necessary.
Patients with body weight below 50 kg may experience more adverse reactions and may be more likely 
to discontinue due to adverse reactions.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
As a cholinesterase inhibitor, rivastigmine may exaggerate the effects of succinylcholine-type muscle 
relaxants during anaesthesia. Caution is recommended when selecting anaesthetic agents. Possible 
dose adjustments or temporarily stopping treatment can be considered if needed.
In view of its pharmacodynamic effects and possible additive effects, rivastigmine should not be given 
concomitantly with other cholinomimetic substances. Rivastigmine might interfere with the activity of 
anticholinergic medicinal products (e.g oxybutynin, tolterodine).
Additive effects leading to bradycardia (which may result in syncope) have been reported with the 
combined use of various beta-blockers (including atenolol) and rivastigmine. Cardiovascular beta-
blockers are expected to be associated with the greatest risk, but reports have also been received in 
patients using other beta-blockers. Therefore, caution should be exercised when rivastigmine is 
combined with beta-blockers and also other bradycardia agents (e.g.class III antiarrhythmic agents, 
calcium channel antagonists, digitalis glycoside, pilocarpin).
Since bradycardia constitutes a risk factor in the occurrence of torsades de pointes, the combination of 
rivastigmine with QT prolongation- or torsades de pointes-inducing medicinal products such as 
5
antipsychotics i.e. some phenothiazines (chlorpromazine, levomepromazine), benzamides (sulpiride, 
sultopride, amisulpride, tiapride, veralipride), pimozide, haloperidol, droperidol, cisapride, citalopram, 
diphemanil, erythromycin IV, halofantrin, mizolastin, methadone, pentamidine and moxifloxacin 
should be observed with caution and clinical monitoring (ECG) may also be required.
No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between rivastigmine and digoxin, warfarin, diazepam 
or fluoxetine in studies in healthy volunteers. The increase in prothrombin time induced by warfarin is 
not affected by administration of rivastigmine. No untoward effects on cardiac conduction were 
observed following concomitant administration of digoxin and rivastigmine.
According to its metabolism, metabolic interactions with other medicinal products appear unlikely, 
although rivastigmine may inhibit the butyrylcholinesterase mediated metabolism of other substances.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
In pregnant animals, rivastigmine and/or metabolites crossed the placenta. It is not known if this occurs 
in humans. No clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. In peri/postnatal studies in rats, an 
increased gestation time was observed. Rivastigmine should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly 
necessary.
Breast-feeding
In animals, rivastigmine is excreted in milk. It is not known if rivastigmine is excreted into human milk. 
Therefore, women on rivastigmine should not breast-feed.
Fertility
No adverse effects of rivastigmine were observed on fertility or reproductive performance in rats (see 
section 5.3). Effects of rivastigmine on human fertility are not known.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Alzheimer’s disease may cause gradual impairment of driving performance or compromise the ability 
to use machinery. Furthermore, rivastigmine can induce dizziness and somnolence, mainly when 
initiating treatment or increasing the dose. As a consequence, rivastigmine has minor or moderate 
influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Therefore, the ability of patients with dementia on 
rivastigmine to continue driving or operating complex machines should be routinely evaluated by the 
treating physician.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The most commonly reported adverse reactions (ADRs) are gastrointestinal, including nausea (38%) 
and vomiting (23%), especially during titration. Female patients in clinical studies were found to be 
more susceptible than male patients to gastrointestinal adverse reactions and weight loss.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
Symptoms
Most cases of accidental overdose have not been associated with any clinical signs or symptoms and 
almost all of the patients concerned continued rivastigmine treatment 24 hours after the overdose.
Cholinergic toxicity has been reported with muscarinic symptoms that are observed with moderate 
poisonings such as miosis, flushing, digestive disorders including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and 
diarrhoea, bradycardia, bronchospasm and increased bronchial secretions, hyperhidrosis, involuntary 
urination and/or defecation, lacrimation, hypotension and salivary hypersecretion.
In more severe cases nicotinic effects might develop such as muscular weakness, fasciculations, seizures 
and respiratory arrest with possible fatal outcome.
Additionally there have been post-marketing cases of dizziness, tremor, headache, somnolence, 
confusional state, hypertension, hallucinations and malaise.
Management
As rivastigmine has a plasma half-life of about 1 hour and a duration of acetylcholinesterase inhibition of 
about 9 hours, it is recommended that in cases of asymptomatic overdose no further dose of rivastigmine 
9
should be administered for the next 24 hours. In overdose accompanied by severe nausea and vomiting, 
the use of antiemetics should be considered. Symptomatic treatment for other adverse reactions should 
be given as necessary.
In massive overdose, atropine can be used. An initial dose of 0.03 mg/kg intravenous atropine sulphate is 
recommended, with subsequent doses based on clinical response. Use of scopolamine as an antidote is 
not recommended.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: psychoanaleptics, anticholinesterases, ATC code: N06DA03
Rivastigmine is an acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor of the carbamate type, thought to 
facilitate cholinergic neurotransmission by slowing the degradation of acetylcholine released by 
functionally intact cholinergic neurones. Thus, rivastigmine may have an ameliorative effect on 
cholinergic-mediated cognitive deficits in dementia associated with Alzheimer’s disease and 
Parkinson’s disease.
Rivastigmine interacts with its target enzymes by forming a covalently bound complex that 
temporarily inactivates the enzymes. In healthy young men, an oral 3 mg dose decreases 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in CSF by approximately 40% within the first 1.5 hours after 
administration. Activity of the enzyme returns to baseline levels about 9 hours after the maximum 
inhibitory effect has been achieved. In patients with Alzheimer’s disease, inhibition of AChE in CSF 
by rivastigmine was dose-dependent up to 6 mg given twice daily, the highest dose tested. Inhibition 
of butyrylcholinesterase activity in CSF of 14 Alzheimer patients treated by rivastigmine was similar 
to that of AChE.
Clinical studies in Alzheimer’s dementia
The efficacy of rivastigmine has been established through the use of three independent, domain 
specific, assessment tools which were assessed at periodic intervals during 6 month treatment periods. 
These include the ADAS-Cog (Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive subscale, a 
performance based measure of cognition), the CIBIC-Plus (Clinician’s Interview Based Impression of 
Change-Plus, a comprehensive global assessment of the patient by the physician incorporating 
caregiver input), and the PDS (Progressive Deterioration Scale, a caregiver-rated assessment of the 
activities of daily living including personal hygiene, feeding, dressing, household chores such as 
shopping, retention of ability to orient oneself to surroundings as well as involvement in activities
relating to finances, etc.).
The patients studied had an MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) score of 10-24.
The results for clinically relevant responders pooled from two flexible dose studies out of the three 
pivotal 26-week multicentre studies in patients with mild-to-moderately severe Alzheimer’s Dementia, 
are provided in Table 4 below. Clinically relevant improvement in these studies was defined a priori as 
at least 4-point improvement on the ADAS-Cog, improvement on the CIBIC-Plus, or at least a 10% 
improvement on the PDS.
In addition, a post-hoc definition of response is provided in the same table. The secondary definition 
of response required a 4-point or greater improvement on the ADAS-Cog, no worsening on the 
CIBIC-Plus, and no worsening on the PDS. The mean actual daily dose for responders in the 6-12 mg 
group, corresponding to this definition, was 9.3 mg. It is important to note that the scales used in this 
indication vary and direct comparisons of results for different therapeutic agents are not valid.

Clinical studies in dementia associated with Parkinson’s disease
The efficacy of rivastigmine in dementia associated with Parkinson’s disease has been demonstrated in 
a 24-week multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled core study and its 24-week open-label 
extension phase. Patients involved in this study had an MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) score 
of 10-24. Efficacy has been established by the use of two independent scales which were assessed at 
regular intervals during a 6-month treatment period as shown in Table 5 below: the ADAS-Cog, a 
measure of cognition, and the global measure ADCS-CGIC (Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study-
Clinician’s Global Impression of Change).

Although a treatment effect was demonstrated in the overall study population, the data suggested that a 
larger treatment effect relative to placebo was seen in the subgroup of patients with moderate dementia 
associated with Parkinson’s disease. Similarly a larger treatment effect was observed in those patients 
with visual hallucinations (see Table 6).

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
rivastigmine in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of Alzheimer’s dementia and in 
the treatment of dementia in patients with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption
Rivastigmine is rapidly and completely absorbed. Peak plasma concentrations are reached in 
approximately 1 hour. As a consequence of rivastigmine’s interaction with its target enzyme, the 
increase in bioavailability is about 1.5-fold greater than that expected from the increase in dose. 
Absolute bioavailability after a 3 mg dose is about 36%±13%. Administration of rivastigmine with 
food delays absorption (tmax) by 90 min and lowers Cmax and increases AUC by approximately 30%.
Distribution
Protein binding of rivastigmine is approximately 40%. It readily crosses the blood brain barrier and 
has an apparent volume of distribution in the range of 1.8-2.7 l/kg.
12
Biotranformation
Rivastigmine is rapidly and extensively metabolised (half-life in plasma approximately 1 hour), 
primarily via cholinesterase-mediated hydrolysis to the decarbamylated metabolite. In vitro, this 
metabolite shows minimal inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (<10%).
Based on in vitro studies, no pharmacokinetic interaction is expected with medicinal products 
metabolised by the following cytochromes isoemzymes: CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, CYP2E1, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, or CYP2B6. Based on evidence from animal studies the major 
cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are minimally involved in rivastigmine metabolism. Total plasma 
clearance of rivastigmine was approximately 130 l/h after a 0.2 mg intravenous dose and decreased to 
70 l/h after a 2.7 mg intravenous dose.
Elimination
Unchanged rivastigmine is not found in the urine; renal excretion of the metabolites is the major route 
of elimination. Following administration of 14C-rivastigmine, renal elimination was rapid and 
essentially complete (>90%) within 24 hours. Less than 1% of the administered dose is excreted in the 
faeces. There is no accumulation of rivastigmine or the decarbamylated metabolite in patients with 
Alzheimer’s disease.
A population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that nicotine use increases the oral clearance of 
rivastigmine by 23% in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (n=75 smokers and 549 non-smokers) 
following rivastigmine oral capsule doses of up to 12 mg/day.
Special populations
Elderly
While bioavailability of rivastigmine is greater in elderly than in young healthy volunteers, studies in 
Alzheimer patients aged between 50 and 92 years showed no change in bioavailability with age.
Hepatic impairment
The Cmax of rivastigmine was approximately 60% higher and the AUC of rivastigmine was more than 
twice as high in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment than in healthy subjects.
Renal impairment
Cmax and AUC of rivastigmine were more than twice as high in subjects with moderate renal 
impairment compared with healthy subjects; however there were no changes in Cmax and AUC of 
rivastigmine in subjects with severe renal impairment.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Repeated-dose toxicity studies in rats, mice and dogs revealed only effects associated with an 
exaggerated pharmacological action. No target organ toxicity was observed. No safety margins to human 
exposure were achieved in the animal studies due to the sensitivity of the animal models used.
Rivastigmine was not mutagenic in a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo tests, except in a 
chromosomal aberration test in human peripheral lymphocytes at a dose 104 times the maximum clinical 
exposure. The in vivo micronucleus test was negative. The major metabolite NAP226-90 also did not 
show a genotoxic potential.
No evidence of carcinogenicity was found in studies in mice and rats at the maximum tolerated dose, 
although the exposure to rivastigmine and its metabolites was lower than the human exposure. When 
normalised to body surface area, the exposure to rivastigmine and its metabolites was approximately 
equivalent to the maximum recommended human dose of 12 mg/day; however, when compared to the 
maximum human dose, a multiple of approximately 6-fold was achieved in animals.
In animals, rivastigmine crosses the placenta and is excreted into milk. Oral studies in pregnant rats and 
rabbits gave no indication of teratogenic potential on the part of rivastigmine. In oral studies with male 
13
and female rats, no adverse effects of rivastigmine were observed on fertility or reproductive 
performance of either the parent generation or the offspring of the parents.
A mild eye/mucosal irritation potential of rivastigmine was identified in a rabbit study.

4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Symptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe Alzheimer’s dementia.
Symptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe dementia in patients with idiopathic Parkinson’s 
disease.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the diagnosis and 
treatment of Alzheimer’s dementia or dementia associated with Parkinson’s disease.
17
Diagnosis should be made according to current guidelines. Therapy with rivastigmine should only be 
started if a caregiver is available who will regularly monitor intake of the medicinal product by the 
patient.
Posology
Rivastigmine should be administered twice a day, with morning and evening meals.
Nimvastid orodispersible tablet should be placed in the mouth, where it will rapidly disperse in saliva, 
so it can be easily swallowed. Removal of the intact orodispersible tablet from the mouth is difficult. 
Since the orodispersible tablet is fragile, it should be taken immediately on opening the blister.
Rivastigmine orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to rivastigmine capsules, with a similar rate and 
extent of absorption. It has the same dosage and frequency of administration as rivastigmine capsules. 
Rivastigmine orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to rivastigmine capsules.
Initial dose
1.5 mg twice a day.
Dose titration
The starting dose is 1.5 mg twice a day. If this dose is well tolerated after a minimum of two weeks of 
treatment, the dose may be increased to 3 mg twice a day. Subsequent increases to 4.5 mg and then 
6 mg twice a day should also be based on good tolerability of the current dose and may be considered 
after a minimum of two weeks of treatment at that dose level.
If adverse reactions (e.g. nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or loss of appetite), weight decrease or 
worsening of extrapyramidal symptoms (e.g. tremor) in patients with dementia associated with 
Parkinson’s disease are observed during treatment, these may respond to omitting one or more doses. 
If adverse reactions persist, the daily dose should be temporarily reduced to the previous well-tolerated 
dose or the treatment may be discontinued.
Maintenance dose
The effective dose is 3 to 6 mg twice a day; to achieve maximum therapeutic benefit patients should 
be maintained on their highest well tolerated dose. The recommended maximum daily dose is 6 mg 
twice a day.
Maintenance treatment can be continued for as long as a therapeutic benefit for the patient exists.
Therefore, the clinical benefit of rivastigmine should be reassessed on a regular basis, especially for 
patients treated at doses less than 3 mg twice a day. If after 3 months of maintenance dose treatment 
the patient’s rate of decline in dementia symptoms is not altered favourably, the treatment should be 
discontinued. Discontinuation should also be considered when evidence of a therapeutic effect is no 
longer present.
Individual response to rivastigmine cannot be predicted. However, a greater treatment effect was seen 
in Parkinson’s disease patients with moderate dementia. Similarly a larger effect was observed in 
Parkinson’s disease patients with visual hallucinations (see section 5.1).
Treatment effect has not been studied in placebo-controlled trials beyond 6 months.
Re-initiation of therapy
If treatment is interrupted for more than three days, it should be re-initiated at 1.5 mg twice daily. 
Dose titration should then be carried out as described above.
Renal and hepatic impairment
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate renal or hepatic impairment. 
However, due to increased exposure in these populations dosing recommendations to titrate according to 
individual tolerability should be closely followed as patients with clinically significant renal or hepatic 
impairment might experience more dose-dependent adverse reactions. Patients with severe hepatic 
18
impairment have not been studied, however, Nimvastid orodispersible tablets may be used in this patient 
population provided close monitoring is exercised (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).
Paediatric population
There is no relevant use of Nimvastid in the paediatric population in the treatment of Alzheimer’s 
disease.
4.3 Contraindications
The use of this medicinal product is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the active 
substance rivastigmine, to other carbamate derivatives or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
Previous history of application site reactions suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis with rivastigmine 
patch (see section 4.4).
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
The incidence and severity of adverse reactions generally increase with higher doses. If treatment is 
interrupted for more than three days, it should be re-initiated at 1.5 mg twice daily to reduce the 
possibility of adverse reactions (e.g. vomiting).
Skin application site reactions may occur with rivastigmine patch and are usually mild or moderate in 
intensity. These reactions are not in themselves an indication of sensitisation. However, use of 
rivastigmine patch may lead to allergic contact dermatitis.
Allergic contact dermatitis should be suspected if application site reactions spread beyond the patch 
size, if there is evidence of a more intense local reaction (e.g. increasing erythema, oedema, papules, 
vesicles) and if symptoms do not significantly improve within 48 hours after patch removal. In these 
cases, treatment should be discontinued (see section 4.3).
Patients who develop application site reactions suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis to rivastigmine 
patch and who still require rivastigmine treatment should only be switched to oral rivastigmine after 
negative allergy testing and under close medical supervision. It is possible that some patients 
sensitised to rivastigmine by exposure to rivastigmine patch may not be able to take rivastigmine in 
any form.
There have been rare post-marketing reports of patients experiencing allergic dermatitis 
(disseminated) when administered rivastigmine irrespective of the route of administration (oral, 
transdermal). In these cases, treatment should be discontinued (see section 4.3).
Patients and caregivers should be instructed accordingly.
Dose titration: Adverse reactions (e.g. hypertension and hallucinations in patients with Alzheimer’s 
dementia and worsening of extrapyramidal symptoms, in particular tremor, in patients with dementia 
associated with Parkinson’s disease) have been observed shortly after dose increase. They may 
respond to a dose reduction. In other cases, rivastigmine has been discontinued (see section 4.8).
Gastrointestinal disorders such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea are dose-related, and may occur 
particularly when initiating treatment and/or increasing the dose (see section 4.8). These adverse 
reactions occur more commonly in women. Patients who show signs or symptoms of dehydration 
resulting from prolonged vomiting or diarrhoea can be managed with intravenous fluids and dose 
reduction or discontinuation if recognised and treated promptly. Dehydration can be associated with 
serious outcomes.
Patients with Alzheimer’s disease may lose weight. Cholinesterase inhibitors, including rivastigmine, 
have been associated with weight loss in these patients. During therapy patient’s weight should be 
monitored.
19
In case of severe vomiting associated with rivastigmine treatment, appropriate dose adjustments as 
recommended in section 4.2 must be made. Some cases of severe vomiting were associated with 
oesophageal rupture (see section 4.8). Such events appeared to occur particularly after dose increments 
or high doses of rivastigmine.
Electrocardiogram QT prolongation may occur in patients treated with certain cholinesterase inhibitor 
products including rivastigmine. Rivastigmine may cause bradycardia which constitutes a risk factor 
in the occurrence of torsade de pointes, predominantly in patients with risk factors. Caution is advised 
in patients with pre-existing, or a family history of, QTc prolongation or at higher risk of developing 
torsade de pointes; for example, those with uncompensated heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, 
bradyarrhythmias, a predisposition to hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia, or concomitant use with 
medicinal products known to induce QT prolongation and/or torsade de pointes. Clinical monitoring 
(ECG) may also be required (see sections 4.5 and 4.8).
Care must be taken when using rivastigmine in patients with sick sinus syndrome or conduction 
defects (sino-atrial block, atrio-ventricular block) (see section 4.8).
Rivastigmine may cause increased gastric acid secretions. Care should be exercised in treating patients 
with active gastric or duodenal ulcers or patients predisposed to these conditions.
Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or 
obstructive pulmonary disease.
Cholinomimetics may induce or exacerbate urinary obstruction and seizures. Caution is recommended 
in treating patients predisposed to such diseases.
The use of rivastigmine in patients with severe dementia of Alzheimer’s disease or associated with
Parkinson’s disease, other types of dementia or other types of memory impairment (e.g. age-related 
cognitive decline) has not been investigated and therefore use in these patient populations is not 
recommended.
Like other cholinomimetics, rivastigmine may exacerbate or induce extrapyramidal symptoms.
Worsening (including bradykinesia, dyskinesia, gait abnormality) and an increased incidence or 
severity of tremor have been observed in patients with dementia associated with Parkinson’s disease 
(see section 4.8). These events led to the discontinuation of rivastigmine in some cases (e.g. 
discontinuations due to tremor 1.7% on rivastigmine vs 0% on placebo). Clinical monitoring is 
recommended for these adverse reactions.
Special populations
Patients with clinically significant renal or hepatic impairment might experience more adverse reactions 
(see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Dosing recommendations to titrate according to individual tolerability must be 
closely followed. Patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied. However, Nimvastid 
may be used in this patient population and close monitoring is necessary.
Patients with body weight below 50 kg may experience more adverse reactions and may be more likely 
to discontinue due to adverse reactions.
Nimvastid contains sorbitol (E420)
The additive effect of concomitantly administered products containing sorbitol (or fructose) and 
dietary intake of sorbitol (or fructose) should be taken into account. 
The content of sorbitol in medicinal products for oral use may affect the bioavailability of other 
medicinal products for oral use administered concomitantly.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
20
As a cholinesterase inhibitor, rivastigmine may exaggerate the effects of succinylcholine-type muscle 
relaxants during anaesthesia. Caution is recommended when selecting anaesthetic agents. Possible 
dose adjustments or temporarily stopping treatment can be considered if needed.
In view of its pharmacodynamic effects and possible additive effects, rivastigmine should not be given 
concomitantly with other cholinomimetic substances. Rivastigmine might interfere with the activity of 
anticholinergic medicinal products (e.g oxybutynin, tolterodine).
Additive effects leading to bradycardia (which may result in syncope) have been reported with the 
combined use of various beta-blockers (including atenolol) and rivastigmine. Cardiovascular beta-
blockers are expected to be associated with the greatest risk, but reports have also been received in 
patients using other beta-blockers. Therefore, caution should be exercised when rivastigmine is 
combined with beta-blockers and also other bradycardia agents (e.g.class III antiarrhythmic agents, 
calcium channel antagonists, digitalis glycoside, pilocarpin).
Since bradycardia constitutes a risk factor in the occurrence of torsades de pointes, the combination of 
rivastigmine with QT prolongation- or torsades de pointes-inducing medicinal products such as 
antipsychotics i.e. some phenothiazines (chlorpromazine, levomepromazine), benzamides (sulpiride, 
sultopride, amisulpride, tiapride, veralipride), pimozide, haloperidol, droperidol, cisapride, citalopram, 
diphemanil, erythromycin IV, halofantrin, mizolastin, methadone, pentamidine and moxifloxacin 
should be observed with caution and clinical monitoring (ECG) may also be required.
No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between rivastigmine and digoxin, warfarin, diazepam 
or fluoxetine in studies in healthy volunteers. The increase in prothrombin time induced by warfarin is 
not affected by administration of rivastigmine. No untoward effects on cardiac conduction were 
observed following concomitant administration of digoxin and rivastigmine.
According to its metabolism, metabolic interactions with other medicinal products appear unlikely, 
although rivastigmine may inhibit the butyrylcholinesterase mediated metabolism of other substances.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
In pregnant animals, rivastigmine and/or metabolites crossed the placenta. It is not known if this occurs 
in humans. No clinical data on exposed pregnancies are available. In peri/postnatal studies in rats, an 
increased gestation time was observed. Rivastigmine should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly 
necessary.
Breast-feeding
In animals, rivastigmine is excreted in milk. It is not known if rivastigmine is excreted into human milk. 
Therefore, women on rivastigmine should not breast-feed.
Fertility
No adverse effects of rivastigmine were observed on fertility or reproductive performance in rats (see 
section 5.3). Effects of rivastigmine on human fertility are not known.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Alzheimer’s disease may cause gradual impairment of driving performance or compromise the ability 
to use machinery. Furthermore, rivastigmine can induce dizziness and somnolence, mainly when 
initiating treatment or increasing the dose. As a consequence, rivastigmine has minor or moderate 
influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Therefore, the ability of patients with dementia on 
rivastigmine to continue driving or operating complex machines should be routinely evaluated by the 
treating physician.
4.8 Undesirable effects
21
Summary of the safety profile
The most commonly reported adverse reactions (ADRs) are gastrointestinal, including nausea (38%) 
and vomiting (23%), especially during titration. Female patients in clinical studies were found to be 
more susceptible than male patients to gastrointestinal adverse reactions and weight loss.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
Symptoms
Most cases of accidental overdose have not been associated with any clinical signs or symptoms and 
almost all of the patients concerned continued rivastigmine treatment 24 hours after the overdose.
Cholinergic toxicity has been reported with muscarinic symptoms that are observed with moderate 
poisonings such as miosis, flushing, digestive disorders including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and 
diarrhoea, bradycardia, bronchospasm and increased bronchial secretions, hyperhidrosis, involuntary 
urination and/or defecation, lacrimation, hypotension and salivary hypersecretion.
In more severe cases nicotinic effects might develop such as muscular weakness, fasciculations, seizures 
and respiratory arrest with possible fatal outcome.
Additionally there have been post-marketing cases of dizziness, tremor, headache, somnolence, 
confusional state, hypertension, hallucinations and malaise.
Management
As rivastigmine has a plasma half-life of about 1 hour and a duration of acetylcholinesterase inhibition of 
about 9 hours, it is recommended that in cases of asymptomatic overdose no further dose of rivastigmine 
should be administered for the next 24 hours. In overdose accompanied by severe nausea and vomiting, 
the use of antiemetics should be considered. Symptomatic treatment for other adverse reactions should 
be given as necessary.
In massive overdose, atropine can be used. An initial dose of 0.03 mg/kg intravenous atropine sulphate is 
recommended, with subsequent doses based on clinical response. Use of scopolamine as an antidote is 
not recommended.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
25
Pharmacotherapeutic group: psychoanaleptics, anticholinesterases, ATC code: N06DA03
Rivastigmine is an acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor of the carbamate type, thought to 
facilitate cholinergic neurotransmission by slowing the degradation of acetylcholine released by 
functionally intact cholinergic neurones. Thus, rivastigmine may have an ameliorative effect on 
cholinergic-mediated cognitive deficits in dementia associated with Alzheimer’s disease and 
Parkinson’s disease.
Rivastigmine interacts with its target enzymes by forming a covalently bound complex that 
temporarily inactivates the enzymes. In healthy young men, an oral 3 mg dose decreases 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in CSF by approximately 40% within the first 1.5 hours after 
administration. Activity of the enzyme returns to baseline levels about 9 hours after the maximum 
inhibitory effect has been achieved. In patients with Alzheimer’s disease, inhibition of AChE in CSF 
by rivastigmine was dose-dependent up to 6 mg given twice daily, the highest dose tested. Inhibition 
of butyrylcholinesterase activity in CSF of 14 Alzheimer patients treated by rivastigmine was similar 
to that of AChE.
Clinical studies in Alzheimer’s dementia
The efficacy of rivastigmine has been established through the use of three independent, domain 
specific, assessment tools which were assessed at periodic intervals during 6 month treatment periods. 
These include the ADAS-Cog (Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive subscale, a 
performance based measure of cognition), the CIBIC-Plus (Clinician’s Interview Based Impression of 
Change-Plus, a comprehensive global assessment of the patient by the physician incorporating 
caregiver input), and the PDS (Progressive Deterioration Scale, a caregiver-rated assessment of the 
activities of daily living including personal hygiene, feeding, dressing, household chores such as 
shopping, retention of ability to orient oneself to surroundings as well as involvement in activities 
relating to finances, etc.).
The patients studied had an MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) score of 10-24.
The results for clinically relevant responders pooled from two flexible dose studies out of the three 
pivotal 26-week multicentre studies in patients with mild-to-moderately severe Alzheimer’s Dementia, 
are provided in Table 4 below. Clinically relevant improvement in these studies was defined a priori as 
at least 4-point improvement on the ADAS-Cog, improvement on the CIBIC-Plus, or at least a 10% 
improvement on the PDS.
In addition, a post-hoc definition of response is provided in the same table. The secondary definition 
of response required a 4-point or greater improvement on the ADAS-Cog, no worsening on the 
CIBIC-Plus, and no worsening on the PDS. The mean actual daily dose for responders in the 6-12 mg 
group, corresponding to this definition, was 9.3 mg. It is important to note that the scales used in this 
indication vary and direct comparisons of results for different therapeutic agents are not valid.

Clinical studies in dementia associated with Parkinson’s disease
The efficacy of rivastigmine in dementia associated with Parkinson’s disease has been demonstrated in 
a 24-week multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled core study and its 24-week open-label 
extension phase. Patients involved in this study had an MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) score 
of 10-24. Efficacy has been established by the use of two independent scales which were assessed at 
regular intervals during a 6-month treatment period as shown in Table 5 below: the ADAS-Cog, a 
measure of cognition, and the global measure ADCS-CGIC (Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study-
Clinician’s Global Impression of Change).

Although a treatment effect was demonstrated in the overall study population, the data suggested that a 
larger treatment effect relative to placebo was seen in the subgroup of patients with moderate dementia 
associated with Parkinson’s disease. Similarly a larger treatment effect was observed in those patients 
with visual hallucinations (see Table 6).

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
rivastigmine in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of Alzheimer’s dementia and in 
the treatment of dementia in patients with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Rivastigmine orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to rivastigmine capsules, with a similar rate and 
extent of absorption. Rivastigmine orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to rivastigmine 
capsules.
Absorption
Rivastigmine is rapidly and completely absorbed. Peak plasma concentrations are reached in 
approximately 1 hour. As a consequence of rivastigmine’s interaction with its target enzyme, the 
increase in bioavailability is about 1.5-fold greater than that expected from the increase in dose. 
Absolute bioavailability after a 3 mg dose is about 36%±13%. Administration of rivastigmine with 
food delays absorption (tmax) by 90 min and lowers Cmax and increases AUC by approximately 30%.
Distribution
Protein binding of rivastigmine is approximately 40%. It readily crosses the blood brain barrier and 
has an apparent volume of distribution in the range of 1.8-2.7 l/kg.
Biotranformation
Rivastigmine is rapidly and extensively metabolised (half-life in plasma approximately 1 hour), 
primarily via cholinesterase-mediated hydrolysis to the decarbamylated metabolite. In vitro, this 
metabolite shows minimal inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (<10%).
Based on in vitro studies, no pharmacokinetic interaction is expected with medicinal products 
metabolised by the following cytochromes isoemzymes: CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, CYP2E1, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, or CYP2B6. Based on evidence from animal studies the major 
cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are minimally involved in rivastigmine metabolism. Total plasma 
28
clearance of rivastigmine was approximately 130 l/h after a 0.2 mg intravenous dose and decreased to 
70 l/h after a 2.7 mg intravenous dose.
Elimination
Unchanged rivastigmine is not found in the urine; renal excretion of the metabolites is the major route 
of elimination. Following administration of 14C-rivastigmine, renal elimination was rapid and 
essentially complete (>90%) within 24 hours. Less than 1% of the administered dose is excreted in the 
faeces. There is no accumulation of rivastigmine or the decarbamylated metabolite in patients with 
Alzheimer’s disease.
A population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that nicotine use increases the oral clearance of 
rivastigmine by 23% in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (n=75 smokers and 549 non-smokers) 
following rivastigmine oral capsule doses of up to 12 mg/day.
Special populations
Elderly
While bioavailability of rivastigmine is greater in elderly than in young healthy volunteers, studies in 
Alzheimer patients aged between 50 and 92 years showed no change in bioavailability with age.
Hepatic impairment
The Cmax of rivastigmine was approximately 60% higher and the AUC of rivastigmine was more than 
twice as high in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment than in healthy subjects.
Renal impairment
Cmax and AUC of rivastigmine were more than twice as high in subjects with moderate renal 
impairment compared with healthy subjects; however there were no changes in Cmax and AUC of 
rivastigmine in subjects with severe renal impairment.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Repeated-dose toxicity studies in rats, mice and dogs revealed only effects associated with an 
exaggerated pharmacological action. No target organ toxicity was observed. No safety margins to human 
exposure were achieved in the animal studies due to the sensitivity of the animal models used.
Rivastigmine was not mutagenic in a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo tests, except in a 
chromosomal aberration test in human peripheral lymphocytes at a dose 104 times the maximum clinical 
exposure. The in vivo micronucleus test was negative. The major metabolite NAP226-90 also did not 
show a genotoxic potential.
No evidence of carcinogenicity was found in studies in mice and rats at the maximum tolerated dose, 
although the exposure to rivastigmine and its metabolites was lower than the human exposure. When 
normalised to body surface area, the exposure to rivastigmine and its metabolites was approximately 
equivalent to the maximum recommended human dose of 12 mg/day; however, when compared to the 
maximum human dose, a multiple of approximately 6-fold was achieved in animals.
In animals, rivastigmine crosses the placenta and is excreted into milk. Oral studies in pregnant rats and 
rabbits gave no indication of teratogenic potential on the part of rivastigmine. In oral studies with male 
and female rats, no adverse effects of rivastigmine were observed on fertility or reproductive 
performance of either the parent generation or the offspring of the parents.
A mild eye/mucosal irritation potential of rivastigmine was identified in a rabbit study.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What Nimvastid is and what it is used for
The active substance of Nimvastid is rivastigmine.
Rivastigmine belongs to a class of substances called cholinesterase inhibitors. In patients with 
Alzheimer’s dementia or dementia due to Parkinson’s disease, certain nerve cells die in the brain, 
resulting in low levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (a substance that allows nerve cells to 
communicate with each other). Rivastigmine works by blocking the enzymes that break down 
acetylcholine: acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. By blocking these enzymes, Nimvastid 
allows levels of acetylcholine to be increased in the brain, helping to reduce the symptoms of 
Alzheimer’s disease and dementia associated with Parkinson’s disease.
Nimvastid is used for the treatment of adult patients with mild to moderately severe Alzheimer’s 
dementia, a progressive brain disorder that gradually affects memory, intellectual ability and 
behaviour. The capsules and orodispersible tablets can also be used for the treatment of dementia in 
adult patients with Parkinson’s disease.
2. What you need to know before you take Nimvastid
Do not take Nimvastid
-
-
if you are allergic to rivastigmine (the active substance in Nimvastid) or to any of the other 
ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).
if you have a skin reaction spreading beyond the patch size, if there is a more intense local 
reaction (such as blisters, increasing skin inflammation, swelling) and if it does not improve 
within 48 hours after removal of the transdermal patch.
If this applies to you, tell your doctor and do not take Nimvastid.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor before taking Nimvastid:
69
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
if you have, or have ever had, a heart condition such as an irregular or slow heartbeat, QTc 
prolongation, a family history of QTc prolongation, torsade de pointes, or have a low blood level 
of potassium or magnesium.
if you have, or have ever had, an active stomach ulcer.
if you have, or have ever had, difficulties in passing urine.
if you have, or have ever had, seizures.
if you have, or have ever had, asthma or severe respiratory disease.
if you have, or have ever had impaired kidney function.
if you have, or have ever had, impaired liver function.
if you suffer from trembling.
if you have a low body weight.
if you have gastrointestinal reactions such as feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting) and 
diarrhoea. You may become dehydrated (losing too much fluid) if vomiting or diarrhoea are 
prolonged.
If any of these apply to you, your doctor may need to monitor you more closely while you are on this 
medicine.
If you have not taken Nimvastid for more than three days, do not take the next dose until you have 
talked to your doctor.
Children and adolescents
There is no relevant use of Nimvastid in the paediatric population in the treatment of Alzheimer’s 
disease.
Other medicines and Nimvastid
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.
Nimvastid should not be given at the same time as other medicines with similar effects to Nimvastid. 
Nimvastid might interfere with anticholinergic medicines (medicines used to relieve stomach cramps 
or spasms, to treat Parkinson’s disease or to prevent travel sickness).
Nimvastid should not be given at the same time as metoclopramide (a medicine used to relieve or 
prevent nausea and vomiting). Taking the two medicines together could cause problems such as stiff 
limbs and trembling hands.
If you have to undergo surgery whilst taking Nimvastid, tell your doctor before you are given any 
anaesthetics, because Nimvastid may exaggerate the effects of some muscle relaxants during 
anaesthesia.
Caution when Nimvastid is taken together with beta-blockers (medicines such as atenolol used to treat 
hypertension, angina and other heart conditions). Taking the two medicines together could cause 
problems such as slowing of the heartbeat (bradycardia) leading to fainting or loss of consciousness.
Caution when Nimvastid is taken together with other medicines that can affect your heart rhythm or
the electrical system of your heart (QT prolongation).
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
If you are pregnant, the benefits of using Nimvastid must be assessed against the possible effects on 
your unborn child. Nimvastid should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.
You should not breast-feed during treatment with Nimvastid.
Driving and using machines
70
Your doctor will tell you whether your illness allows you to drive vehicles and use machines safely. 
Nimvastid may cause dizziness and somnolence, mainly at the start of treatment or when increasing 
the dose. If you feel dizzy or sleepy, do not drive, use machines or perform any tasks that require your 
attention.
3.
How to take Nimvastid
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse if you are not sure.
How to start treatment
Your doctor will tell you what dose of Nimvastid to take.
 Treatment usually starts with a low dose.
 Your doctor will slowly increase your dose depending on how you respond to treatment.
 The highest dose that should be taken is 6.0 mg twice a day.
Your doctor will regularly check if the medicine is working for you. Your doctor will also monitor 
your weight whilst you are taking this medicine.
If you have not taken Nimvastid for more than three days, do not take the next dose until you have 
talked to your doctor.
Taking this medicine
 Tell your caregiver that you are taking Nimvastid.
 To benefit from your medicine, take it every day.
 Take Nimvastid twice a day, in the morning and evening, with food.

 Do not open or crush the capsules.
Swallow the capsules whole with a drink.
If you take more Nimvastid than you should
If you accidentally take more Nimvastid than you should, inform your doctor. You may require 
medical attention. Some people who have accidentally taken too much Nimvastid have experienced 
feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting), diarrhoea, high blood pressure and hallucinations. Slow 
heartbeat and fainting may also occur.
If you forget to take Nimvastid
If you find you have forgotten to take your dose of Nimvastid, wait and take the next dose at the usual 
time. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What Nimvastid is and what it is used for
The active substance of Nimvastid is rivastigmine.
Rivastigmine belongs to a class of substances called cholinesterase inhibitors. In patients with 
Alzheimer’s dementia or dementia due to Parkinson’s disease, certain nerve cells die in the brain, 
resulting in low levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (a substance that allows nerve cells to 
communicate with each other). Rivastigmine works by blocking the enzymes that break down
acetylcholine: acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. By blocking these enzymes, Nimvastid 
allows levels of acetylcholine to be increased in the brain, helping to reduce the symptoms of 
Alzheimer’s disease and dementia associated with Parkinson’s disease.
Nimvastid is used for the treatment of adult patients with mild to moderately severe Alzheimer’s 
dementia, a progressive brain disorder that gradually affects memory, intellectual ability and 
behaviour. The capsules and orodispersible tablets can also be used for the treatment of dementia in 
adult patients with Parkinson’s disease.
2. What you need to know before you take Nimvastid
Do not take Nimvastid
-
-
if you are allergic to rivastigmine (the active substance in Nimvastid) or to any of the other
ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).
if you have a skin reaction spreading beyond the patch size, if there is a more intense local 
reaction (such as blisters, increasing skin inflammation, swelling) and if it does not improve 
within 48 hours after removal of the transdermal patch.
If this applies to you, tell your doctor and do not take Nimvastid.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor before taking Nimvastid:
-
if you have, or have ever had, a heart condition such as an irregular or slow heartbeat, QTc 
76
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
prolongation, a family history of QTc prolongation, torsade de pointes, or have a low blood level 
of potassium or magnesium.
if you have, or have ever had, an active stomach ulcer.
if you have, or have ever had, difficulties in passing urine.
if you have, or have ever had, seizures.
if you have, or have ever had, asthma or severe respiratory disease.
if you have, or have ever had impaired kidney function.
if you have, or have ever had, impaired liver function.
if you suffer from trembling.
if you have a low body weight.
if you have gastrointestinal reactions such as feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting) and 
diarrhoea. You may become dehydrated (losing too much fluid) if vomiting or diarrhoea are 
prolonged.
If any of these apply to you, your doctor may need to monitor you more closely while you are on this 
medicine.
If you have not taken Nimvastid for more than three days, do not take the next dose until you have 
talked to your doctor.
Children and adolescents
There is no relevant use of Nimvastid in the paediatric population in the treatment of Alzheimer’s 
disease.
Other medicines and Nimvastid
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.
Nimvastid should not be given at the same time as other medicines with similar effects to Nimvastid. 
Nimvastid might interfere with anticholinergic medicines (medicines used to relieve stomach cramps 
or spasms, to treat Parkinson’s disease or to prevent travel sickness).
Nimvastid should not be given at the same time as metoclopramide (a medicine used to relieve or 
prevent nausea and vomiting). Taking the two medicines together could cause problems such as stiff 
limbs and trembling hands.
If you have to undergo surgery whilst taking Nimvastid, tell your doctor before you are given any 
anaesthetics, because Nimvastid may exaggerate the effects of some muscle relaxants during 
anaesthesia.
Caution when Nimvastid is taken together with beta-blockers (medicines such as atenolol used to treat 
hypertension, angina and other heart conditions). Taking the two medicines together could cause 
problems such as slowing of the heartbeat (bradycardia) leading to fainting or loss of consciousness.
Caution when Nimvastid is taken together with other medicines that can affect your heart rhythm or
the electrical system of your heart (QT prolongation).
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
If you are pregnant, the benefits of using Nimvastid must be assessed against the possible effects on 
your unborn child. Nimvastid should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.
You should not breast-feed during treatment with Nimvastid.
Driving and using machines
Your doctor will tell you whether your illness allows you to drive vehicles and use machines safely. 
77
Nimvastid may cause dizziness and somnolence, mainly at the start of treatment or when increasing 
the dose. If you feel dizzy or sleepy, do not drive, use machines or perform any tasks that require your 
attention.

To benefit from your medicine, take it every day.
Take Nimvastid twice a day, once with your breakfast and once with your evening meal. Your 
mouth should be empty before taking the tablet.
Nimvastid orodispersible tablets are fragile. They should not be pushed through the foil in the blister 
pack as this will cause damage to the tablet. Do not handle the tablets with wet hands as the tablets 
may break up. Remove a tablet from the package as follows:
1.
Hold the blister at the edges and separate one blister cell from the rest of the blister by gently 
tearing along the perforations around it,
Pull up the edge of the foil and peel the foil off completely,
Tip the tablet out onto your hand.
Put the tablet on the tongue as soon as it is removed from the packaging.

water. The mouth should be empty before placing the tablet on the tongue.
If you take more Nimvastid than you should
78
If you accidentally take more Nimvastid than you should, inform your doctor. You may require 
medical attention. Some people who have accidentally taken too much Nimvastid have experienced 
feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting), diarrhoea, high blood pressure and hallucinations. Slow 
heartbeat and fainting may also occur.
If you forget to take Nimvastid
If you find you have forgotten to take your dose of Nimvastid, wait and take the next dose at the usual 
time. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

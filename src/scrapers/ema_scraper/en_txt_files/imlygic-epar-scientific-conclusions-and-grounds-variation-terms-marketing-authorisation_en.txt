Scientific conclusions and grounds for variation to the terms of the marketing authorisations 
‘Accidental exposure of health care provider (HCP)’ is an important identified risk and ‘Transmission of 
Talimogene Laherparepvec from patient to close contacts or HCPs via direct contact with injected lesions or 
body fluids resulting in symptomatic infection (primary or reactivation)’ is an important potential risk for the 
use of talimogene laherparepvec. In view of suspected herpetic infection events as well as quantitative 
PCR-confirmed infections, the PRAC considered that the overall monitoring of herpetic infections should be 
improved. Therefore, additional wording regarding the possibility of qPCR-testing for talimogene 
laherparepvec should be included in section 4.4 of the SmPC through the amendment of the existing warning 
regarding accidental exposure to Imlygic, and section 2 of the Package Leaflet in order to improve the 
screening for transmission of talimogene laherparepvec.

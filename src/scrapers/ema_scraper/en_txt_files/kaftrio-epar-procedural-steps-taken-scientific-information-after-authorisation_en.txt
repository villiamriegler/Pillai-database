Update of section 5.3 of the SmPC in order to update 
the non-clinical information based on final results 
from a 2-year oral carcinogenicity study in rats (VX-
445-TX-015) evaluating the carcinogenic potential of 
up to 10 mg/kg/day of elexacaftor. An updated RMP 
(version 6.0) has also been submitted to include the

C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
reports from 2 non-clinical studies.  
In the 2-year oral carcinogenicity study in rats (VX-445-TX-
015), administration of elexacaftor up to 10mg/kg/day by 
oral gavage did not reveal carcinogenic potential.  
The juvenile toxicity study (VX-661-TX-038) aimed to 
determine the potential effects of once-daily oral (gavage) 
administration of tezacaftor alone or in combination with 
ivacaftor on growth and development in juvenile rats. Rats 
exposed during postnatal day 7 to 35 (PND 7-35) showed 
mortality and moribundity, even at low doses. Findings 
were dose related and generally more severe when dosing 
with tezacaftor was initiated earlier in the postnatal period. 
Exposure in rats from PND 21-49 did not show toxicity at 
the highest dose which was approximately two times the 
intended human exposure. Tezacaftor and its metabolite, 
M1-TEZ, are substrates for P glycoprotein. Lower brain 
levels of P-glycoprotein activity in younger rats resulted in 
higher brain levels of tezacaftor and M1-TEZ. These 
findings are not relevant for the indicated paediatric 
population 6 to 11 years of age, for whom levels of P-
glycoprotein activity are equivalent to levels observed in

Elevated transaminases are common in patients with CF 
and have been observed in some patients treated with 
IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA. In patients taking 
IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA, these elevations 
have sometimes been associated with concomitant 
elevations in total bilirubin. Assessments of transaminases 
(ALT and AST) and total bilirubin are recommended for all 
patients prior to initiating treatment, every 3 months 
during the first year of treatment, and annually thereafter. 
For patients with a history of liver disease or transaminase 
elevations, more frequent monitoring should be considered. 
In the event of ALT or AST >5 x the upper limit of normal 
(ULN), or ALT or AST >3 x ULN with bilirubin >2 x ULN, 
dosing should be interrupted, and laboratory tests closely 
followed until the abnormalities resolve. Following the 
resolution of transaminase elevations, the benefits and 
risks of resuming treatment should be considered. 
Liver injury and total bilirubin elevations are added as new 
adverse reactions with a frequency “not known” as the 
frequency cannot be estimated from the available data. 
Kaftrio’s RMP is updated to version  3.1 to upgrade 
hepatoxicity from a potential serious risk to an important 
identified risk.

category 3 study in the RMP with the aim to evaluate

there is a clear medical need and the benefits are expected 
to outweigh the risks.  
In these patients, a recommendation to apply a reduced 
dose was agreed during the initial marketing authorisation 
as follows:  In case of moderate hepatic impairment, a

possible 25% reduction of the elexacaftor and tezacaftor 
dose, 62.5% reduction of the ivacaftor dose over a 48 hour 
period should be considered. 
Data from the Study VX18-445-007 provide further support 
for the current dose-advice in patients with moderate 
hepatic impairment. The dose-reduction (i.e. a 25% 
reduction in the doses of elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and their 
respective metabolites and a 62.5% reduction in the dose 
of ivacaftor over a 48-hour period) is expected to lead to 
comparable exposure to elexacaftor and M23-elexacaftor, 
to a 40% reduction in ivacaftor exposure and to a 10% 
decrease in tezacaftor exposure. In conclusion, the current 
recommendation in the product information does not need 
to be amended. The RMP (version 1.2) is updated to reflect 
the submission of this category 3 study and fulfilment of 
this post approval commitment.

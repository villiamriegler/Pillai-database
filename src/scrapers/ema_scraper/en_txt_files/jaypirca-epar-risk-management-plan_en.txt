Not yet assigned 
Eli Lilly Netherland B.V.  
Pirtobrutinib 
Jaypirca 
Centralised  
Chemical class: Pirtobrutinib is a highly selective ATP competitive small 
molecule inhibitor of the BTK. 
Summary of mode of action: Pirtobrutinib is a small molecule reversible, 
noncovalent inhibitor of BTK. BTK is a signalling protein of the BCR and 
cytokine receptor pathways. In B-cells, BTK signalling results in activation 
of pathways necessary for B-cell proliferation, trafficking, chemotaxis, and 
adhesion. Pirtobrutinib binds to wild-type BTK as well as BTK harbouring 
C481 mutations leading to inhibition of BTK kinase activity. In nonclinical 
studies, pirtobrutinib inhibited BTK-mediated B-cell CD69 expression and 
inhibited malignant B-cell proliferation. Pirtobrutinib showed dose-
dependent tumour growth inhibition and induced tumour regression in BTK 
wild-type and BTK C481S mutant mouse xenograft models.  
Important information about its composition: Empirical formula of 
pirtobrutinib is C22H21F4N5O3. The chemical name is: (S)-5-amino-3-(4-((5-
fluoro-2-methoxybenzamido)methyl)phenyl)-1-(1,1,1-trifluoropropane-2-
yl)-1H-pyrazole-4-carboxamide.  
The proposed PI is provided in the submission for the initial marketing 
authorisation application (Module 1.3.1). 
Proposed:  
Jaypirca as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have been 
previously treated with a Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor. 
Proposed:  
The recommended dose is 200 mg orally once daily. Treatment should be 
continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
Dose interruption is recommended for specific adverse events, depending 
on the CTCAE grade and associated symptoms. 
Pharmaceutical form and 
strengths 
Proposed:  
Pirtobrutinib is provided as 50 mg and 100 mg film-coated tablets

Part II: Safety Specification  
Module SI - Epidemiology of the Indication(s) and Target Population(s)  
SI.1 Mantle Cell Lymphoma  
SI.1.1 Incidence  
MCL accounts for 2% to 10% of all the cases of NHL in the North America and Western Europe 
(Sant et al. 2010; Dreyling et al. 2017; Jain and Wang 2019). In the US SEER database (1995 to 
2013), the overall age-adjusted incidence of MCL was 1.01 in 100,000 persons per year (Fu et al. 
2017). Several population-based studies in Europe (France, UK, Denmark, and Sweden), at 
various times between 1992 to 2012, reported annual incidence rates ranging from 0.42 to1.27 
per 100,000 persons (Andersen et al. 2002; Abrahamsson et al. 2014; Leux et al. 2014; Smith et 
al. 2015).  
Compared to the US and Europe, lower incidence of lymphoid malignancies, particularly mature 
B-cell NHL, has been reported in Asian countries (Lee et al. 2018; Chihara et al. 2014). 
According to data from the Singapore Cancer Registry (2008 to 2012), the annual age-
standardised incidence of mature B-cell NHL was 8.5 per 100,000 population and MCL 
accounted for 2.4% of the incident cases (Lim et al. 2015). Similarly, MCL comprised 1.7% of 
the mature B-cell NHL in Korea (1999 to 2012), with an annual age-standardised incidence of 
0.09 per 100,000 (Lee et al. 2018).  
SI.1.2 Prevalence  
Using data from the Global Cancer Incidence, Mortality and Prevalence, the overall complete 
prevalence of MCL, which is the proportion of patients alive with MCL, in the EU in 2020 was 
estimated to be approximately 0.61 per 10,000 people. In the US, the estimated number of 
patients with MCL was 18,414 in 2020, with the complete prevalence estimate of 0.56 per 
10,000 people from the SEER data (1992 to 2016).  
SI.1.3 Demographics of the Population in the proposed Indication – 
[age, gender, racial and/or ethnic Origin] and Risk Factors for the 
Disease  
Age: MCL affects mainly older individuals. According to the US SEER database (2000 to 2013), 
median age at diagnosis was 67 years (Epperla et al. 2017). A slightly higher median age at 
diagnosis was reported from 2 European population-based studies: 71 years in Danish and 
Swedish population (Abrahamsson et al. 2014) and 72 years in French population (Leux et al. 
2014).  
Gender: Incidence of MCL is higher among men than in women. Age-adjusted incidence (per 
100,000 person-years) was 1.58 in men and 0.57 in women in the US SEER database (1995 to 
2013) (Fu et al. 2017). A similar gender difference has been reported in European studies, with a 
male-to-female ratio of 2.5 to 4:1 (Abrahamsson et al. 2014; Leux et al. 2014; Smith et al. 2015; 
Andersen et al. 2002).  
LY3527727 
EU Risk Management Plan (Version 0.3) 
Page 9 of 64 
Race/Ethnic origin: Racial/ethnic variation in the MCL incidence has been implied by higher 
rates in the US and Europe relative to those in Asian countries (Lim et al. 2015, Lee at al., 
2018;). However, ethnic differences were also observed in the population within the same 
geographical regions. For example, in the US, the incidence rate (per 100,000 person-years) of 
MCL was highest among Whites (0.73), followed by 0.52 in Hispanics, 0.33 in Blacks and 0.29 
in Asian/Pacific Islanders (Aschebrook-Kilfoy et al. 2013).  
Risk Factors: According to a pooled analysis of 13 case-control studies from Europe, North 
America and Australia (557 cases and 13766 controls) in 2014, a haematological malignancy 
among first-degree relatives was associated with a 2-fold increased risk of MCL. The largest 
analysis, to date, has also reported a protective association with a history of hay fever and a 
positive association with living on a farm and select occupations characterized by exposure to 
engine exhausts, organic solvents and polychlorinated biphenyls, or electromagnetic fields. On 
the contrary, no statistically significant associations with MCL risk were found with autoimmune 
disorders, tobacco smoking, alcohol intake, body mass index, or ultraviolet radiation (Smedby et 
al. 2014).  
Among genetic factors, ATM, CCND1, and TP53 are the most common somatic mutations 
implicated in the development of MCL (Cheah et al. 2016), whereas no high-impact germline 
mutations have been identified for MCL or for mature B-cell neoplasms (Sud et al. 2019). 
SI.1.4 Main Existing Treatment Options  
MCL is a rare and aggressive subtype of NHL. While indolent subtypes of MCL have been 
characterised, the typical presentation of MCL is usually aggressive and incurable requiring 
treatment at diagnosis for most patients. Treatment is required for most patients to improve 
survival and quality of life. Heterogeneous disease behaviour dictates the indications and timing 
for therapy, although the specific treatment approach is generally the same. Median overall 
survival at diagnosis is estimated at only 3 to 5 years (Dreyling et al. 2018).  
First-line treatment  
At diagnosis, patients have a median age of 65 to 70 years, with associated comorbidities, which 
must be considered for appropriate treatment selection (Kluin-Nelemans et al. 2012). Frontline 
treatment selection is based on patient characteristics including age, with categorisation of 
patients as “younger than 65” or “older than 65” as a common key factor influencing treatment 
selection. More commonly, patients who are younger than 65 years and fit are candidates for 
intensive CIT approaches, often with SCT consolidation, followed by rituximab maintenance 
(Lenz et al. 2005; Flinn et al. 2014). In transplant-ineligible patients, commonly due to age and 
comorbidities, induction CIT followed by rituximab maintenance without transplant is an 
accepted alternate approach. Ultimately, none of these approaches are considered curative, and 
relapse is nearly universal. (Lenz et al. 2005; Flinn et al. 2014; Dreyling et al. 2017). 
Relapsed and refractory treatment 
For relapsed patients with MCL, the goals of treatment are focused on disease control. Standard 
prognostic features have less impact on treatment selection in this setting. Traditional approaches 
LY3527727 
EU Risk Management Plan (Version 0.3) 
Page 10 of 64 
to R/R MCL have typically included chemotherapy and CIT regimens; however, the standard of 
care is moving toward targeted therapies, primarily BTK inhibition. 
Stem cell transplantation 
Although SCT following multiagent intensive salvage chemotherapy is typically viewed as part 
of effective salvage for most other aggressive lymphomas, autologous SCT is less effective for 
MCL when used after relapse than when used to consolidate first remission (Cassaday et al. 
2015). As in frontline settings, allogeneic SCT may be administered in relapse. Toxicity may be 
a limiting factor, thus, autologous and allogeneic SCT for treatment of MCL are complicated by 
toxicity concerns and are of limited benefit to a selected group of patients. 
BTK inhibitors 
Interruption of B-cell receptor signalling via BTK inhibition effectively limits cell growth via 
negative impact on downstream pathways mediated by NF-kB and phospholipase C-γ2 (Merolle 
et al. 2018). The importance of these pathways in the pathogenesis of MCL led to investigation 
of the first generation BTK inhibitor ibrutinib in advanced MCL. Patients with a median of 3 
prior therapies had an overall response rate of 68%, complete responses in 21% and median 
duration of response of 17.5 months (Wang et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2015). These data led to the 
authorisation of ibrutinib for the treatment of relapsed MCL (Imbruvica summary of product 
characteristics). The BTK inhibitors acalabrutinib and zanubrutinib have recently received 
marketing authorisation in the US for R/R MCL and have a similar mechanism of action as 
ibrutinib by covalently inhibiting BTK and demonstrate similar efficacy (Brukinsa® package 
insert, 2019; Imbruvica® package insert, 2020; Calquence® package insert, 2022). 
With these results, ibrutinib is increasingly supplanting other previously approved agents for 
relapsed MCL as it offers response rates and response durations better than reported with 
bortezomib (Goy et al. 2009), lenalidomide (Trněný et al. 2016), and temsirolimus (Hess et al. 
2009). However, BTK inhibitor therapy is not curative, and patients continue to relapse. Of 
importance is the discontinuation rates of ibrutinib due to adverse events (AEs) which is reported 
in up to 25.6% of patients in some studies. Despite the superior benefits of BTK inhibition with 
ibrutinib over temsirolimus, salvage treatment with BTK inhibitors is still not curative and 
prospective studies evaluating therapy options specifically in the post-BTK inhibitor setting of 
relapsed MCL are rare (Dreyling et al. 2016). Available data demonstrate that following 
progression on BTK inhibitors, the survival of patients with MCL is very poor with median 
overall survival ranging from only 2.5 to up to 8.4 months (Martin et al. 2016; Cheah et al. 2015; 
Epperla et al. 2017). Thus, identifying agents that are effective and tolerable remains an unmet 
need for patients with relapsed MCL, particularly following BTK inhibitor therapy. Besides 
CAR-T, which has significant limitations as discussed below, currently, no other approved 
therapies are available specifically for the treatment of patients who have received a prior BTK 
inhibitor therapy, highlighting the unmet need in this area. 
CAR-T 
LY3527727 
EU Risk Management Plan (Version 0.3) 
Page 11 of 64 
For patients who have failed prior BTK inhibitor the CAR-T cell therapy, Tecartus, has recently 
been made available for relapsed/refractory, heavily pre-treated MCL patients. Approval is based 
on a single-arm Phase 2 study, which predominantly enrolled patients who had received prior 
BTK inhibitor therapy (Tecartus SmPC). Despite an impressive ORR of 93% with CR rate of 
67%, CAR-T treatment has associated considerations that limit its utility for many relapsed MCL 
patients. CAR-T toxicities, including severe cytokine release syndrome occurred in over 90% of 
patients, with Grade 3 or higher in 15% of patients. Neurologic events, occurred in 63% of 
patients, with Grade 3 or higher occurring in 31% of patients. Additionally, CAR-T is associated 
with significant toxicities with Grade ≥3 AEs occurring in 99% of patients (Wang et al. 2020). 
Prescribing CAR-T therapy requires successful leukapheresis, product manufacture, bridging 
chemotherapy, and conditioning therapy prior to cell infusion, all of which introduce additional 
logistical and clinical complexities given the specialised nature of treatment. Limitations due to 
safety concerns and treatment barriers are significant barriers for the larger population of 
relapsed MCL patients (Cerrano et al. 2020, Wang et al. 2020). 
Bortezomib, lenalidomide and temsirolimus 
Agents such as bortezomib (Goy et al. 2009), lenalidomide (Trněný et al. 2016), and 
temsirolimus (Hess et al. 2009) are less used in the modern era for patients with relapsed disease 
because of 
 
lower response rates (versus BTK inhibitors) ranging from 22% with temsirolimus to 
40% with lenalidomide 
  CRs being less than 10%  
  PFS being shorter than 9 months, and  
  preference to be combined with chemotherapy when using bortezomib or temsirolimus in 
first line (Dreyling et al 2017). 
Marketing authorisation for these agents were granted in the EU for the treatment of relapsed 
MCL for lenalidomide in 2007 (Revlimid SmPC) and for temsirolomus in 2007 (Torisel SmPC). 
No prospectively published efficacy data for these agents are available in the post BTK inhibitor 
setting of relapsed MCL. 
SI.1.5 Natural History of the Indicated Condition in the Population, 
Including Mortality and Morbidity  
MCL results from a malignant transformation of a B lymphocyte in the outer edge of a lymph 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Typically, the first sign of MCL is the enlargement of lymph nodes, 
followed by digestive tract symptoms (loss of appetite, indigestion, bloating, nausea, and 
vomiting) and fatigue from anaemia. Approximately half of MCL patients also experience 
symptoms such as night sweats, fever, and weight loss, commonly referred to as B symptoms 
(Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, 2014, Wang and Ma 2014).  
Although a small set of patients with MCL presents clinical features that do not need immediate 
treatment, the clinical behaviour of MCL is usually aggressive and most patients (approximately 
70%) are diagnosed with advanced disease (Cheah et al. 2016; Fu et al. 2017). According to data 
from 404 patients with MCL managed at a tertiary hospital in the US (2000 to 2014), 22% (90 of 
LY3527727 
EU Risk Management Plan (Version 0.3) 
Page 12 of 64 
404) were initially observed, of which 20% (18 of 90) never received therapy and 80% (72 of 90) 
were subsequently treated. A total of 386 patients eventually received first-line treatment, and 
58% (222 of 386) had R/R disease during a median follow-up of 74 months, requiring multiple 
lines of therapy. Treatment outcome shortened with each successive line of therapy, with the 
median PFS from 14 months after second line therapy to 3.3 months after 5 or more lines of 
therapy (Kumar et al. 2019). 
Median overall survival of patients with MCL was 52 months in the US SEER database (1995 to 
2013) (Fu et al. 2017). Older age was associated with worse survival, with the 5-year relative 
survival rates decreasing from 75.4% in age <50 years to 67.4% in 50 to 64 years; 56.6% in 65 to 
74 years; and 36.2% in ≥ 75 years (Epperla et al. 2017). The MCL international Prognostic 
Index, formulated by the European MCL Network, is the prognostic model that incorporates age 
and other independent prognostic factors such as performance status, lactic acid dehydrogenase 
level and white blood cell count at diagnosis. Based on the MCL international Prognostic Index 
risk stratification, the median overall survival among patients with advanced MCL was 29 
months and 51 months in the high and intermediate risk groups, respectively, and it was not 
reached in the low-risk group after a median follow-up of 32 months (Hoster et al. 2008; Vose 
2017). Even with low-risk MCL, this disease is still considered incurable. 
SI.1.6 Important Co-morbidities  
  MCL mainly affects the elderly where the overall comorbidity burden is high. In a 
Swedish national registry-based cohort of MCL patients (2000 to 2014), 44% had at least 
1 major comorbid condition at the time of diagnosis and 28% had 2 or more (Gilmelius et 
al. 2020).  
  Table SI.1 summarizes the more common and/or important comorbidities in patients with 
MCL and expected comedications. Prevalence of comorbid conditions comes from a 
Swedish cohort of MCL patients (Glimelius et al. 2020), and US administrative claims-
based data of MCL patients treated with acalabrutinib (Ryan et al. 2019).

500 mg/kg twice daily. Significant effects observed in repeat-dose studies in rats, dogs, or both 
consisted of 
 
lymphoid organ effects, such as decreased size, weight, or cellularity, 
  decreases in B lymphocytes and other markers of immune system function, 
  mortality in the 28-day dog study at clinically relevant exposure levels, and 
  corneal lesions in the 3-month dog study 
Effects on lymphoid organs and immune system function are consistent with the clinical safety 
profile of pirtobrutinib. 
Dogs have generally been less tolerant of exposure to pirtobrutinib than humans. The relevance 
of this finding to human usage is not believed to be significant, as humans have been treated for 
longer durations than dogs, and pirtobrutinib is well-tolerated in humans at efficacious exposure 
levels. 
Minimal to mild corneal lesions were observed in 2 dogs treated with pirtobrutinib for 3 months 
at clinically relevant exposure levels. Eye effects were not observed in rats treated for 3 months. 
It is not clear if this finding will translate to an effect in humans; however, it has not been 
identified as a risk in humans to date. If it were to translate to a human effect, it would have 
limited impact on the risk-benefit profile of pirtobrutinib since such lesions are readily detectable 
in humans and clinically manageable. 
Genotoxicity 
Pirtobrutinib has been tested in a complete battery of genotoxicity studies. It is an aneugenic 
genotoxicant based on the finding of predominantly centromere-positive micronuclei in in vitro 
micronucleus studies. However, this is not a significant clinical risk, as exposure levels in the 
clinic at 200 mg once daily are approximately 12-fold lower than the no effect level for 
micronucleus formation in a rat micronucleus study. Therefore, at clinical exposures 
pirtobrutinib is not expected to cause aneugenic genotoxic effects. 
Pirtobrutinib was negative in all other genotoxicity studies. 
Carcinogenicity 
Studies to assess the carcinogenicity of pirtobrutinib have not been conducted.  
Reproductive/developmental toxicity 
Fertility risks of pirtobrutinib were assessed in repeat-dose toxicity studies. No effects on male or 
female reproductive organs were observed in any animal study. There are no data on the effect of 
pirtobrutinib on human fertility.

EU Risk Management Plan (Version 0.3) 
Page 15 of 64 
Pirtobrutinib caused embryo-foetal toxicity and malformations in pregnant rats treated during the 
period of embryogenesis in the absence of significant maternal toxicity. These effects occurred at 
clinically relevant exposure levels. Female patients of reproductive potential are advised to use 
effective contraception in accordance with product labelling. 
Local tolerance 
Local tolerance studies are not warranted or applicable for the oral route of delivery. 
Phototoxicity 
Pirtobrutinib is not phototoxic. 
SII.2 Safety Pharmacology  
Minor QTc prolongation was observed at the mid-dose in the 28-day repeat-dose dog study at the 
end of the study. The increase was minimal and was not considered physiologically important. In 
contrast, no QTc prolongation was observed at a higher dose level in a Good Laboratory Practice 
dog cardiovascular safety pharmacology study. Unbound or free human pirtobrutinib Cmax at 200 
mg is approximately 56-fold lower than the hERG IC50 measured in an in-vitro hERG study (see 
Module 2.6.2.4.1). Thus, QTc prolongation is not considered a significant risk to humans. 
There were no effects on central nervous system or respiratory safety pharmacology endpoints in 
repeat-dose toxicology studies. 
SII.3 Other Toxicity-Related Information or Data  
Other findings in nonclinical studies that were minor, with little relevance to human safety, 
included: 
  bone marrow toxicity in the 28-day dog study, 
  GI toxicity in the 28-day dog study, 
 
lung inflammation in the 28-day dog study, 
  decreased red cell mass in rats and dogs, and 
  a rat-specific pancreatic effect. 
Bone marrow toxicity, GI toxicity, and lung inflammation occurred only in dogs at dose levels 
that were not tolerated. Decreases in red cell mass were minor, not adverse, and clinically 
monitorable. The pancreatic effects were consistent with a well-known rat-specific effect that has 
been documented (Erickson et al 2017; Bhaskaran et al 2018). This effect is not known to 
translate to a clinical effect. Therefore, the effects listed above are not considered to be a clinical 
risk.

Relevance to Human Usage 
The nonclinical data indicate that there is a risk for 
negative effects in lymphoid organs, which may 
translate to immune suppression. Patients should be 
advised of the risk of infections and prophylaxis is 
considered in patients who are at increased risk for 
opportunistic infections. Based on the grade of infection 
and whether it occurs with neutropenia, dose 
adjustment may be required.

Humans tolerate pirtobrutinib treatment better than 
dogs; thus, there is no relevance to human usage. 
The nonclinical data indicate that there is a risk for eye 
lesions. There were no reported clinical observations of 
corneal lesions in Study 18001.  
Aneugenic genotoxicity does not occur at clinically 
relevant exposure levels; thus, there is no relevance to 
human usage. 
The nonclinical data indicate that there is a risk for 
reproductive and developmental toxicities in women 
exposed to pirtobrutinib during pregnancy. Women of 
childbearing potential should be advised to use highly 
effective contraception according to product labelling.

Module SIV - Populations Not Studied in Clinical Trials  
SIV.1 Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Studies within the Development 
Programme  
In the pirtobrutinib clinical development programme, the primary population studied comprised 
patients with histologically confirmed B-cell malignancies failed or intolerant to either at least 2 
prior standard of care regimens given in combination or sequentially, or who have received 1 
prior BTK inhibitor-containing regimen when a BTK inhibitor was utilised as first-line therapy. 
Key exclusion criteria were intended to ensure safety and minimise risk in a research setting. 
Specific and relevant exclusion criteria that are important to pirtobrutinib are addressed below. 
Criterion: Patient is pregnant or a lactating woman 
Reason for exclusion: Pirtobrutinib caused embryo foetal toxicity and malformations in pregnant 
rats treated during the period of embryogenesis in the absence of significant maternal toxicity. 
These effects occurred at clinically relevant exposure, therefore, risks to new-borns or infants 
cannot be excluded. It is unknown whether pirtobrutinib is excreted in human milk.  
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No 
Rationale: Labelling information will clearly indicate that women of childbearing potential 
should use highly effective contraception during treatment with pirtobrutinib and for 5 weeks 
after the last dose. In addition, patients will be instructed through labelling that they should not 
breastfeed during treatment with pirtobrutinib and for 1 week after the last dose. 
Criterion: Patients with significant cardiovascular disease 
Reason for exclusion: As a class, BTK inhibitors have exhibited cardiotoxic AEs. To mitigate 
this known class risks, patients meeting the following criteria were excluded from Study LOXO-
BTK-18001 (18001): 
  unstable angina 
  history of myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to planned start of pirtobrutinib 
  previously documented left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by any method of not 
more than 45% in the 12 months prior to planned start of pirtobrutinib; assessment of 
LVEF via echocardiogram or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan during Screening 
should be performed in selected patients as medically indicated  
  any Class 3 or 4 cardiac disease as defined by the New York Heart Association 
Functional Classification 
  uncontrolled or symptomatic arrhythmias, or 
  prolongation of the QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTcF). 
Additionally, electrocardiograms (ECGs) were required to be administered at regular intervals to 
detect any potential cardiac issues.  
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No 
LY3527727 
EU Risk Management Plan (Version 0.3) 
Page 22 of 64 
Rationale: Patients with significant cardiac diseases were excluded from Study 18001 as per the 
exclusion criteria; however, patients presenting with other subtypes and severities of cardiac 
conditions were allowed in the study. In the overall monotherapy safety analysis set (OMTSAS) 
population, 184 (25.4%) patients had history of cardiovascular disease. The most common 
conditions were atrial fibrillation (11.3%) and coronary artery disease (4.3%).  
A comparison of incidence of cardiovascular events in patients with underlying cardiac disease 
(n=184) against all patients in OMTSAS (n=725) showed a significant numerical imbalance in 
the incidence of atrial fibrillation: 6.5% in patients with underlying cardiac disease and 2.3% in 
the OMTSAS.  
The risk of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter in patients with cardiovascular conditions is 
recognised and a warning statement is included in the Summary of Product Characteristics 
(SmPC). The following is mentioned in Section 4.4 of SmPC:  
Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter have been observed in patients treated with pirtobrutinib, 
particularly in patients with a history of atrial fibrillation and/or multiple cardiovascular 
comorbidities. Monitor for signs and symptoms of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter and obtain 
an electrocardiogram as medically indicated. Based on the grade of atrial fibrillation/atrial 
flutter, dose interruption may be required (see section 4.2).  
SIV.2 Limitations to Detect Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trial Development 
Programmes  
The clinical development programme is unlikely to detect certain types of adverse reactions such 
as rare adverse reactions, adverse reactions with a long latency, or those caused by prolonged 
and/or cumulative exposure.

Patients with relevant comorbidities:

  Patients with renal impairment 
Exposure 
Not included in the clinical development programme  
Patients with severe hepatic impairment were excluded from 
entering Study 18001. 
In a population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients enrolled 
in the Study 18001, mild hepatic impairment (per NCI 
criteria) had no effect on the exposure of pirtobrutinib. 
Data from the clinical pharmacology Study LOXO-BTK-
20012, in participants with mild, moderate, and severe 
hepatic impairment, systemic exposure of pirtobrutinib was 
similar between subjects with mild hepatic impairment and 
normal hepatic function and was approximately 15% and 
21% lower in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic 
impairment, respectively, compared to subjects with normal 
hepatic function. Hepatic function has no effect on the Cmax 
of pirtobrutinib. No adjustment of the dose of pirtobrutinib 
is required for patients with mild to severe hepatic 
impairment. 
Patients with severe renal impairment and patients on 
dialysis were excluded from entering Study 18001.  
Data from the clinical pharmacology study in patients with 
severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min) did not show 
clinically meaningful differences in exposure.  
In a population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients enrolled 
in Study 18001, mild (60 mL/min /1.73m2≤ eGFR<90 
mL/min/1.73m2) and moderate (30 mL/min /1.73m2≤ eGFR 
<60 mL/min/1.73m2) renal impairment had no effect on the 
exposure of pirtobrutinib. 
Patients with relevant comorbidities:

Although the number of Asian and Black/African American 
enrolled in Study 18001 are limited (42 and 22 patients, 
respectively), no clinically significant differences were 
observed in relation to overall incidence of TEAEs, TEAEs 
leading to dose reduction or treatment discontinuation in 
these populations when compared to the white patient

Module SVI - Additional EU Requirements for the Safety Specification  
SVI.1 - Potential for Misuse for Illegal Purposes  
Pirtobrutinib has not been studied systematically in humans for its potential for abuse, tolerance, 
or physical dependence. While the current clinical trial programme did not reveal any tendency 
for any drug seeking behaviour, these observations were not systematic, and it is not possible to 
predict on the basis of this limited experience the extent to which an anticancer drug will be 
misused, diverted, and/or abused once marketed. If stolen, like any drug, pirtobrutinib has a 
potential for misuse.

Module SVII - Identified and Potential Risks  
SVII.1 Identification of Safety Concerns in the Initial RMP Submission  
The primary safety analysis set of Study 18001 is the OMTSAS (n = 725) and includes patients 
with CLL/SLL, MCL and other NHL (including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, marginal zone 
lymphoma, Richter´s Transformation, follicular lymphoma and Waldenstrom’s 
macroglobulinemia), who received at least 1 dose of pirtobrutinib as monotherapy, at any dose 
level, as of the data cut-off of 31 January 2022. Separate analyses for the patient populations 
with MCL (MCL safety analysis set [MSAS]; n = 164) and CLL/SLL (CLL safety analysis set 
[CSAS]; n = 311) were also performed to investigate whether there were any notable differences 
in the safety profile of pirtobrutinib in these individual tumour types compared to the OMTSAS. 
No notable differences in the safety profile of pirtobrutinib between the OMTSAS and MSAS 
were identified, hence, OMTSAS is the primary analysis set utilised for the determination of 
pirtobrutinib’s risks. 
SVII.1.1 Risks Not Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of 
Safety Concerns in the RMP  
Risks with minimal clinical impact on patients (in relation to the severity of the indication 
treated): fatigue, diarrhoea, contusion, nausea, abdominal pain, headache, arthralgia, petechiae 
and rash. 
These events will be categorised as adverse drug reactions (ADRs) for pirtobrutinib and 
further included in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Adverse reactions with clinical consequences, even serious, but occurring with a low 
frequency and considered to be acceptable in relation to the severity of the indication 
treated:  
  Lymphocytosis: Lymphocytosis is a recognised effect of treatment with covalent BTK 
inhibitors and has been observed in patients treated with pirtobrutinib. Lymphocytosis 
will be included as an ADR for pirtobrutinib and included in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
While lymphocytosis is a known, on-target drug class effect of BTK inhibitor therapy, it 
is also a manifestation of disease in this patient population. Severe lymphocytosis due to 
progressive or active disease that could lead to complications such as leukostasis that 
may have resultant clinical complications (for example cardiopulmonary events) and/or 
require procedural intervention (for example, leukapheresis), is distinctly separate from 
lymphocytosis that may result from treatment with BTK inhibitor therapies, including 
pirtobrutinib. In Study 18001, 35 patients (4.8%) had lymphocytosis (20 patients had 
events assessed by the investigator as related, 2.8%) with a median time of first onset of 
1.86 weeks. The majority of patients (22 patients, 3.0%) had Grades 3/4 events and no 
Grade 5 events were reported. One patient required dose reduction due to lymphocytosis 
(0.1%). No patient discontinued from pirtobrutinib due to lymphocytosis.  
At baseline, prior to initiating study drug therapy, history of lymphocytosis or 
lymphocyte count increased had been reported (OMTSAS: 0.8% and 0.3%, respectively), 
mainly in CLL patients (CSAS: 1.6% and 0.3%, respectively; MSAS: 0.6% and 0, 
LY3527727 
EU Risk Management Plan (Version 0.3) 
Page 29 of 64 
respectively). In addition, prior to initiating study treatment, 36.9% of OMTSAS patients 
had a Grade ≥2 elevated lymphocyte counts based on laboratory tests (257/696 patients 
assessed). Lymphocytosis is manageable without aggressive intervention and can be 
resolved despite ongoing therapy, which is reflected in the low-dose reduction rate and 
absence of events leading to treatment discontinuation. Thus, lymphocytosis is not 
considered to have a significant impact on the risk-benefit balance. 
Known risks that require no further characterisation and are followed up via routine 
pharmacovigilance namely through signal detection and adverse reaction reporting, and for 
which the risk minimisation messages in the product information are adhered by prescribers: 
  Not applicable 
Known risks that do not impact the risk-benefit profile: 
  Cytopenia (thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and anaemia): Thrombocytopenia, 
neutropenia and anaemia are considered ADRs for pirtobrutinib and addressed in 
Sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. AEs of ≥Grades 3 were seen in 6.6% patients for 
thrombocytopenia, 19.7% for neutropenia and 7.9% for anaemia. Cytopenias are a 
common part of the disease state and complete blood count monitoring is a known 
practice for management. Frequent monitoring of haematology laboratory values, 
together with the implementation of a dose modification strategy when the decreases 
occurred, allowed the vast majority of patients with cytopenia to stay on study, and 
discontinuation from study due to cytopenia occurred in only 3 patients (0.4%) due to 
neutropenia, 1 patient (0.1%) due to anaemia. No patient discontinued due to 
thrombocytopenia. Of note, at baseline, it is notable that 13.7%, 23.8%, and 19.9% of 
patients in the OMTSAS had Grade ≥2 decreased laboratory values for ANC, 
haemoglobin, and platelets, respectively. Cytopenia-related outcomes do not translate 
into significant impact to the risk-benefit balance of pirtobrutinib, therefore cytopenias 
will not be considered important risks. Instruction on dose interruption for selected 
cytopenia-related events are outlined in Section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Other reasons for considering the risks not important:  
  Not applicable  
Risks reported for other members of this pharmacological class but not considered a risk for 
pirtobrutinib: 
  Tumour Lysis Syndrome: Patients with haematologic malignancies are at theoretical 
risk of disease-associated, as well as treatment-induced TLS. While this is a recognised 
rare risk of treatment with ibrutinib, it has not been an identified risk with other BTK 
inhibitor therapies. In Study 18001, 3 patients (0.4%) had TLS, of which 2 had a Grade 3 
event and 1 had a Grade 4 event; however, none were considered related by the 
investigator. Even though 2 patients required dose interruption, no one had to reduce dose 
or discontinue from pirtobrutinib due to TLS. One case of a fatal TLS event that was 
assessed as being related to pirtobrutinib was reported in a separate ongoing trial 
LY3527727 
EU Risk Management Plan (Version 0.3) 
Page 30 of 64 
conducted in China (J2N-MC-JZNJ), not part of the OMTSAS. The event occurred in a 
patient with follicular lymphoma with a large retroperitoneal tumour as well as multiple 
lesions throughout their neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis, including lesions encasing large 
vessels and left kidney/ureter. Approximately 8 hours after the patient received a single 
dose of 200 mg pirtobrutinib, they developed acute onset of abdominal pain and 
distension. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with acute onset of oncolytic 
syndrome, abdominal blood clotting, and haemorrhage. The patient was transferred to the 
intensive care unit and treated aggressively for electrolyte derangement, haemorrhage, 
and renal failure but ultimately died. This event does not change the overall safety 
assessment on the risk of TLS with pirtobrutinib. While TLS is a known risk for all 
patients receiving anti-cancer therapy, especially in patients with haematologic 
malignancies and/or large tumour burden, it is not a risk unique to the nature or use of 
BTK inhibitor therapy specifically. Considering the overall severity of outcomes of TLS 
seen with pirtobrutinib and the paucity of events, TLS does not have a significant impact 
on the risk-benefit of pirtobrutinib and will not be considered an important risk. 
  Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (excluding atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter) 
and ventricular tachyarrhythmias:  
There were 21 patients (2.9%) with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, mainly driven by 
sinus tachycardia events (2.1%, 15 patients), followed by supraventricular extrasystoles 
(0.4%, 3 patients) and supraventricular tachycardia (0.4%, 3 patients). All but 4 events 
were Grades 1/2 (3 unrelated Grade 3 events of sinus tachycardia and 1 unrelated Grade 4 
event of supraventricular tachycardia) and none resulted in dose reduction or study drug 
discontinuation.  
Ventricular tachyarrhythmia is listed as an ADR and as an important identified risk for 
ibrutinib but is not listed as ADR for the second-generation BTK inhibitors acalabrutinib 
and zanubrutinib. In Study 18001, there were 5 patients (0.7%) with events of ventricular 
tachyarrhythmia (ventricular extrasystoles in 4 patients and ventricular arrhythmia in 2 
patients), all classified as Grades 1/2 and none resulting in dose interruption, reduction or 
treatment discontinuation. Among these, only 2 events were deemed related to 
pirtobrutinib by the investigator: 1 non-serious event of Grade 2 non-specified ventricular 
arrhythmia and 1 non-serious event of Grade 1 ventricular extrasystole (premature 
ventricular contraction). 
No QT prolongation signal identified. No patients had a serious adverse event (SAE) of 
QTcF prolongation. One patient (0.1%) had a QTcF prolonged AE that led to dose 
interruption, and no QTcF prolongation AEs led to dose reduction or discontinuation. 
One event of sudden was reported in a patient with significant cardiovascular 
comorbidities and aggressive disease.  
At this point, there is insufficient evidence to support the classification of 
supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (excluding atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter) and 
ventricular tachyarrhythmias as important risks for pirtobrutinib.

SVII.1.2 Risks Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of 
Safety Concerns in the RMP  
Important Identified Risk 1: Serious haemorrhage 
Risk-Benefit Impact: 
Serious haemorrhagic events may be considered to have an impact on the risk-benefit balance of 
pirtobrutinib, as outcomes can be life-threatening, severely debilitating, or result in clinically 
relevant sequelae. Such events, defined as ≥Grade 3 haemorrhagic events (excluding 
bruising-related events), were observed in 2.2% of patients in Study 18001 (16 patients, with 4 
[0.6%] considered as related).  
Overall, 17.4% of patients reported any grade haemorrhagic events and 2.1% of patients reported 
any grade SAEs of haemorrhage. No patient had to undergo dose reduction due to serious 
haemorrhage. One Grade 5 haemorrhagic event was reported, considered not related to 
pirtobrutinib by the investigator. This event occurred in a patient, treated for MCL, with a prior 
history of bladder cancer and thrombocytopenia who had an accident and experienced a 
haemorrhagic event. 
It is acknowledged that patients with haematologic malignancies are predisposed to bleeding-
related events due to concomitant factors such as thrombocytopenia and deficient platelet 
aggregation.  
Overall, considering the potential significant impact on the risk-benefit of the product and the 
fact that haemorrhage is a known class effect, serious haemorrhage is considered an important 
identified risk for pirtobrutinib.  
Important Identified Risk 2: Serious infections 
Risk-Benefit Impact: 
Serious infections may be considered to have an impact on the risk-benefit profile of 
pirtobrutinib, due to potentially severe clinical outcomes.  
Infections were commonly reported among patients treated with pirtobrutinib (47.2%), with 
majority of the events being Grade 1 or Grade 2 (29.4%) and only 8.7% of patients presenting 
infections considered related to pirtobrutinib by the investigator. Few discontinuations (2.3%) 
were reported, and dose was reduced for 2 (0.3%) patients due to infections.  
Serious infections, characterised as Grade ≥3 events, were observed in 17.7% of patients (2.8% 
of patients with events deemed related to pirtobrutinib by the investigator). There were 130 
patients (17.9%) with infection-related SAEs (2.5% considered related by the investigator) and 
29 patients with fatal events due to infection, of which 3 were considered related to pirtobrutinib 
by the investigator: Enterococcus faecium-related septic shock, COVID-19 pneumonia and 
pneumonia necrotising.  
It is notable that 12.7% of patients reported a TEAE of COVID-19 infection, including 6.5% of 
patients with SAEs and 2.1% (15 patients) with Grade 5 events, 1 of them was considered related 
LY3527727 
EU Risk Management Plan (Version 0.3) 
Page 32 of 64 
by the investigator. This is reflective of the COVID-19 pandemic that began during the course of 
Study 18001. In addition, the overall incidence of severe COVID-19 events was likely impacted 
by factors such as local COVID-19 case rate, access to treatments, and vaccination rates during 
the study. 
Although the frequency of serious infections in Study 18001 is lower when compared to other 
BTK inhibitors and patients with B-cell malignancies are predisposed to serious infections, 
infection is a class label risk with a known mechanism of action and events of infectious nature 
are described in Section 4.8 of the pirtobrutinib SmPC. Furthermore, infections can lead to 
potential severe clinical outcomes; therefore, serious infection is considered an important 
identified risk for pirtobrutinib. This risk will be closely monitored and further characterised in 
the Phase 3 clinical trials. 
Important Identified Risk 3: atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter  
Risk-Benefit Impact:  
Due to the potentially severe clinical consequences associated with atrial fibrillation and atrial 
flutter (e.g. shock, cardiac arrest and thromboembolic events), such events have the potential to 
impact the risk-benefit balance of pirtobrutinib. 
Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter were observed in 2.6% of patients (19 patients: 17 patients 
with atrial fibrillation and 3 patients with atrial flutter) in Study 18001. The majority of the 
events were Grades 1/2 (1.6%), and there was a total of 7 patients with Grade ≥ 3 events (1.0%), 
only 1 considered related by the investigator (0.1%). In addition, 5 patients reported SAEs of 
atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter (0.7%). No fatal outcomes were reported. No patient had to 
undergo dose reduction or treatment discontinuation due to atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. 
Previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter was reported in 6 patients and, in addition, 
11 patients had relevant comorbidities or other significant risk factors for the occurrence of atrial 
fibrillation or atrial flutter (for example, hypertension, coronary artery disease, aortic stenosis, 
acute myocardial infarction, cardiac failure, pacemaker insertion, asymptomatic bradycardia 
incidents, atrial septal defect/supraventricular tachycardia).  Out of the 19 patients, 10 patients 
had a past medical history of atrial fibrillation (2 patients), concurrent systematic infection (4 
patients), or both (4 patients). 
Considering that atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter are known adverse reactions for both first and 
second generation BTKi with suggested mechanism of action and described in Section 4.8 of the 
pirtobrutinib SmPC, atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter are considered important identified risks 
and will be further characterised in the Phase 3 clinical trials.  
Important Potential Risk 1: second primary non-melanoma skin cancer  
Risk-Benefit Impact: 
The occurrence of second primary non-melanoma skin cancer has a potential to impact the risk-
benefit balance of pirtobrutinib because it can lead to increased morbidity (additional 
LY3527727 
EU Risk Management Plan (Version 0.3) 
Page 33 of 64 
concomitant oncologic treatment) and potentially serious outcomes depending on the subtype 
observed. 
In Study 18001, 33 patients reported second primary non-melanoma skin cancer (68.8%). The 
main events were non-melanoma skin cancers in 33 patients (4.6%), with basal cell carcinoma 
(3.6%, 26 patients) and squamous cell carcinoma (1.4%, 10 patients) being the most common 
subtypes.  
All except 1 were Grades 1 to 2 (4.4% of patients). Only 3 patients had events assessed as related 
to pirtobrutinib by the investigator (0.4%) and the occurrence of second primary non-melanoma 
skin cancer did not lead to dose reduction. Two patients discontinued due to second primary non-
melanoma skin cancer (0.3%); neither of which was considered related to pirtobrutinib. 
It is known that patients with NHL, including MCL and CLL, are at increased risk for the 
development of second primary malignancy, especially skin cancer, due to immune dysfunction 
associated with the disease, use of immunosuppressive agents, and DNA damage secondary to 
prior treatment (Brewer et al. 2013). Non-melanoma skin cancer including basal cell carcinoma 
and squamous cell carcinoma are the most common type of skin cancer in the general population, 
with nearly 1.2 million patients newly diagnosed each year globally (Sung et al. 2021). Non-
melanoma skin cancer was also the most common second primary malignancy reported with 
other BTKi drugs: the incidence of second primary malignancy skin cancer (mostly non-
melanoma skin cancer) ranged from 4 to 13% for ibrutinib (Imbruvica package insert, 2013), and 
6% for acalabrutinib and zanubrutinib (Calquence package insert, 2022; Brukinsa package insert, 
2019). 
The observed frequency of second primary non-melanoma skin cancer with pirtobrutinib appears 
to be lower than what has been described with other BTK inhibitors. Second primary non-
melanoma skin cancer is considered an important potential risk for pirtobrutinib.  
In order to characterise the risk of second primary malignancy including second primary non-
melanoma skin cancer, an integrated analysis of all reports of second primary malignancy in 5 
years follow up of clinical trial subjects who received pirtobrutinib 200mg QD as monotherapy 
supplemented with analysis of postmarketing reports will be conducted. This analysis is included 
as an additional PV activity for this risk. An interim analysis is planned for submission to EMA 
by September 2025 and a final report by June 2028 (see Part III.2 Additional Pharmacovigilance 
Activities). 
Important Potential Risk 2: second primary malignancies other than non-melanoma skin 
cancer 
Risk-Benefit Impact: 
The occurrence of second primary malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancer has a 
potential to impact the risk-benefit balance of pirtobrutinib because it can lead to increased 
LY3527727 
 
EU Risk Management Plan (Version 0.3) 
Page 34 of 64 
morbidity (additional concomitant oncologic treatment) and potentially serious outcomes 
depending on the organ involved, stage of disease, and subtype observed.  
In Study 18001, 17 patients reported second primary malignancies other than non-melanoma 
skin cancer (2.3%). The most frequent events were malignant melanoma in 3 patients (0.4 %) 
and 2 events each of malignant melanoma in situ, second primary malignancy, and Eight events 
were reported with higher grade severity of ≥3 (1.1% of patients) and there was no fatal case. 
Only 2 patients had events assessed as related to pirtobrutinib by the investigator (0.3%), and the 
occurrence of SPM other than non-melanoma skin cancer did not lead to dose reduction. Two 
patients discontinued treatment due to SPM (0.3%); neither of which was considered related to 
pirtobrutinib. 
Patients with MCL and CLL might be also at increased risk for the development of secondary 
malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer due to immune dysfunction and DNA damage 
secondary to prior treatment. In an analysis of the US SEER database, it was observed that 261 
out of 3149 patients (8.29%) with MCL as primary cancer developed second primary 
malignancies, over a median follow-up of 31 months. A statistically significant excess risk for 
cancers excluding non-melanoma skin cancer, especially other haematological cancers and 
melanoma, was observed in patients with a primary diagnosis of MCL compared to the expected 
incidence of second primary malignancy in the general population (Shah and Khanal 2015). 
Similarly, in the analysis of the US SEER database, second solid cancers occurred in 1820 out of 
16367 patients with CLL (11.1%) over the average follow-up of 5.2 years. Kaposi sarcoma, 
malignant melanoma, and cancers of the larynx and the lung were among the cancers associated 
with a statistically significant excess among patients with CLL (Hisada et al. 2001). Reported 
occurrence of second primary malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancer was between 
1% and 4% for ibrutinib (Imbruvica package insert, 2013), 3% for zanubrutinib (Brukinsa 
package insert, 2019), and 6% for acalabrutinib (Calquence package insert, 2019). The observed 
frequency of second primary malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancer with 
pirtobrutinib appears to be lower than what has been described with other BTK inhibitors. 
Second primary malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancer is considered an important 
potential risk for pirtobrutinib and will be further characterised in the Phase 3 studies. 
Additionally, to characterize the risk of second primary malignancy, an integrated analysis of 
reports of all second primary malignancy in 5 years follow up of clinical trial subjects who 
received pirtobrutinib 200mg QD as monotherapy supplemented with analysis of postmarketing 
reports will be conducted. This analysis is included as an additional PV activity for this risk. An 
interim analysis is planned for submission to EMA by September 2025 and a final report by June 
2028 (see Section III.3 Summary Table of Additional Pharmacovigilance Activities).

SVII.3 Details of Important Identified Risks, Important Potential Risks, 
and Missing Information  
SVII.3.1 Presentation of Important Identified Risks and Important 
Potential Risks  
Important Identified Risk 1: Serious haemorrhage 
Potential mechanisms: 
Increased bleeding susceptibility has been observed in association with BTK inhibitors. Ibrutinib 
causes GPVI and integrin αIIbβ3 platelet signalling deficiencies that result in formation of 
unstable thrombi and may contribute toward the bleeding events observed in patients (Bye et al. 
2015). Similar to what was described previously for the atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter risk, 
patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia do not present a higher risk of bleeding-related 
events and this increase in bleeding propensity linked to BTK inhibitors can be attributed to 
blockage of activation of platelets by BTK, and inhibition of the closely related tec kinase and 
Src-family kinases (von Hundelshausen and Siess 2021). Although major haemorrhagic events 
are not frequently seen in patients treated with more selective BTK inhibitors and are likely 
reflective of off-target inhibitory effects (Nicolson et al. 2018), haemorrhage is characterised as 
an important identified risk for the authorised BTK inhibitors.  
Evidence sources and strength of evidence: 
Serious haemorrhagic events have been reported at a low frequency in Study 18001, compatible 
to that expected from a highly selective BTK inhibitor, but clinically significant events have 
been observed, including 2.1% of patients with Grade 3 events and 1 fatal event.  
Characterisation of the risk: 
Bleeding events were reported in 34.3% of patients in Study 18001, which included patients with 
low-grade bruising events (contusion, petechiae, ecchymosis or increased tendency to bruise 
events in 23.2% of patients) and haemorrhagic events (17.4% of patients). The most commonly 
reported haemorrhage-related events were epistaxis (3.7%), haematuria (3.2%) and hematoma 
(2.1%), while the most common bruising-related events were contusion (19%), petechiae (4.0%) 
and ecchymosis (1.2%). Serious haemorrhagic events (≥Grade 3) were observed in 2.2% of 
patients. Overall, dose interruption occurred in 2.2% of patients due to a haemorrhagic event. No 
patient had to undergo dose reduction and 1 patient discontinued from treatment due to a 
haemorrhagic event. This event was reported in a patient with Richter’s transformation as an 
unrelated Grade 3 GI haemorrhage. Of note, the patient passed away approximately 2 months 
after treatment start due to disease progression.  
One Grade 5 haemorrhagic event was reported and was considered not related to pirtobrutinib by 
the investigator. This event occurred in a patient treated for MCL, with a prior history of bladder 
cancer and thrombocytopenia (baseline platelet count of 41X109/L), and a chronic history of 
episodes of confusion and amnesia. At the start of Cycle 3, they sustained an accident and died 
as a result. A large amount of external bleeding was reported, which was presumed to be the 
LY3527727 
EU Risk Management Plan (Version 0.3) 
Page 36 of 64 
cause of patient death based upon history. No hospital records were found and no autopsy was 
conducted. 
A total of 218 (30.1%) patients in the OMTSAS (including 43 [26.2%] in the MSAS and 97 
[31.2%] in the CSAS) were reported to be on antithrombotic concomitant medications. 
Consistent with the approach used in other BTK inhibitor clinical studies, Study 18001 protocol 
prohibited the use of vitamin K-dependent anticoagulants, but allowed all other anticoagulants to 
minimise bleeding risk given the known benefits of direct oral anticoagulant therapies and lower 
bleeding risk as compared with warfarin (Eikelboom and Merli 2016). Of the 16 of 725 (2.2%) 
patients who reported Grade ≥3 haemorrhagic events, 11 of 725 (1.5%) had not been on 
antithrombotic therapy and 5 patients (Grade 3 upper GI haemorrhage in 2 patients and 
suprapatellar haematoma, post-operative haemorrhage, and subdural hematoma in 1 patient each) 
had been on antithrombotic therapy: 
  81 mg aspirin daily for cardiac prophylaxis in both patients with upper GI 
haemorrhage and in the patient with post-operative haemorrhage 
  325 mg aspirin daily for cardiac prophylaxis in the patient with subdural haematoma, 
and  
  apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily for history of atrial fibrillation in the patient with 
suprapatellar hematoma.  
Haematuria has been added as a new ADR in Section 4.8 of SmPC under group ADR term 
haemorrhage. Following bleeding related ADRs are already included in Section 4.8 of SmPC; 
haemorrhage (epistaxis and haematoma) and bruising (contusion and petechiae). 
Risk factors and risk groups: 
Patients presenting with severe thrombocytopenia are at increased risk of serious haemorrhagic 
events (Neunert et al. 2015). Per Georgantopoulos et al. 2019 and Dmitrieva et al. 2020, other 
reported risk factors for the occurrence of major haemorrhage in patients with MCL and CLL 
include  
  history of major haemorrhage 
  concomitant use of anticoagulants (for example, warfarin, heparin, enoxaparin) and 
antiplatelets (for example, acetylsalicylic acid, clopidogrel) 
renal disease 
 
  anaemia 
 
  alcohol abuse.  
thrombocytopenia, and  
General medical conditions associated with increased propensity for haemorrhagic events 
include acquired coagulopathies, inherited bleeding dysfunctions, hepatopathy, renal dysfunction 
(leading to uraemia-induced platelet dysfunction; Boccardo et al. 2004), and connective tissue 
disorders leading to haematologic abnormalities.  
Preventability: 
LY3527727 
 
EU Risk Management Plan (Version 0.3) 
Page 37 of 64 
Instructions on monitoring for signs and symptoms of bleeding while on treatment with 
pirtobrutinib will be provided in Section 4.4 of the SmPC. Patients presenting with severe 
thrombocytopenia and consequent increased bleeding risk will be treated according to local 
oncology clinical practice guidance, and treatment may include platelet transfusion and 
antifibrinolytic agents (Kuter 2015). 
Advice on considering the benefit-risk of withholding pirtobrutinib for 3 to 5 days pre- and post-
surgery depending upon the type of surgery and risk of bleeding is included in Section 4.4 of the 
SmPC. 
Recommendation to consider the benefit-risk of anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy when co-
administered with pirtobrutinib is included in SmPC Section 4.4.  
In Section 4.4, a statement on the fact that pirtobrutinib has not been studied with warfarin or 
other vitamin K antagonists is also included.  
Patients presenting with Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding or Grade 4 thrombocytopenia 
while on treatment with pirtobrutinib may undergo dose interruption, and this guidance is 
provided in Section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product: 
Serious haemorrhagic events can have a significant impact on individual patients, and outcomes 
can be life-threatening, severely debilitating or result in clinically relevant sequela.  
Majority of bleeding-related events observed with pirtobrutinib were low grade, with most cases 
compatible with bruising (23.2% of patients) and, therefore, less clinically impactful. Section 4.4 
of the SmPC provides relevant risk factors for the occurrence of bleeding and advised monitoring 
for signs and symptoms of bleeding to facilitate prompt diagnosis and management, thus 
reducing the risk of severe outcomes. 
Cases of bleeding-related events of ≥Grade 3 have been observed in 2.2% of patients in 
Study 18001, including 1 fatal event (0.1%). Due to the occurrence of severe haemorrhagic 
events associated with pirtobrutinib treatment, serious haemorrhage is considered to have an 
impact on the risk-benefit balance of pirtobrutinib.  
Public health impact: 
The incidence of serious haemorrhagic events reported in Study 18001 is considered low. In 
addition, administration of pirtobrutinib is limited to a subset of patients with haematologic 
malignancies, therefore, the public health impact is estimated to be low. 
Important Identified Risk 2: Serious Infections 
Potential mechanisms:  
BTK is an indispensable component of the B‐cell receptor signalling pathway through which it 
mediates B‐cell growth, adhesion, and survival. It utilises pathways involving innate and 
adaptive immunity. The clinical hallmark of congenital BTK mutations is recurrent bacterial 
infections in the X‐linked agammaglobulinemia syndrome, and there are also reports of 
LY3527727 
EU Risk Management Plan (Version 0.3) 
Page 38 of 64 
opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis jirovecii as index manifestation (Tillman et al 
2018).  
The nuclear factor of activated T cells is BTK-dependent and plays a key role in the macrophage 
inflammatory response to Aspergillus fumigatus, initiating antiviral responses and leading to 
activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to bacterial infections (for example, 
pneumococcal pneumonia; Good et al 2021). Therefore, it is postulated that the BTK inhibition 
could impair the aforementioned processes and increase the susceptibility to infections. 
Evidence sources and strength of evidence: 
The occurrence of serious infections has the potential to impact the risk-benefit balance of 
pirtobrutinib. Grade ≥3 events (17.7% of patients) and fatal cases (29 patients, 4.0%) have been 
reported, but the causal association with pirtobrutinib is still unclear at this stage.  
Infections is a known risk observed with other BTK inhibitors (Teh et al 2018; Estupiñán et al 
2021). Nevertheless, sustained increases in serum immunoglobulin A levels induced by ibrutinib 
and acalabrutinib have also been observed, and this finding has been correlated with a lower risk 
of developing infections with long-term BTK inhibitor therapy (Byrd et al 2015; Pleyer et al 
2020). Particular types of infections (for example, fungal infections) observed with ibrutinib are 
postulated to be also caused by off-target inhibition of tec protein tyrosine kinase, and this effect 
is diminished with pirtobrutinib due to its higher selectivity for BTK. 
Although the frequency of serious infections in Study 18001 is lower when compared to other 
BTK inhibitors and patients with B-cell malignancies are predisposed to infections, serious 
infections are class label risks with a known mechanism of action, described in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC and have potential for severe clinical outcomes therefore, considered an important 
identified risk for pirtobrutinib. This risk will be closely monitored and further characterised in 
the Phase 3 clinical trials. 
Characterisation of the risk: 
Overall, infection events were commonly reported (47.2%) in patients treated with pirtobrutinib, 
with majority of the events being Grades 1 or 2 (29.4%) and only 8.7% of patients with 
infections deemed related to treatment. The most frequently reported infection events were 
COVID-19 (9.2%), pneumonia (8.7%), upper respiratory tract infection (8.3%), and urinary tract 
infection (8.0%). Excluding COVID-19-related events, infections were observed in 41.4% of 
patients and most frequently reported events were pneumonia (8.7%), upper respiratory tract 
infection (8.3%) and urinary tract infection (8.0%).  
Serious infections, characterised as Grade ≥ 3 events, were observed in 17.7% of patients (2.8% 
with events deemed related to pirtobrutinib by the investigator). The most frequent Grade ≥ 3 
events were pneumonia (4.8%), COVID-19 pneumonia (3.7%), COVID-19 (2.3%), sepsis 
(2.2%) and urinary tract infection (1.4%). Excluding COVID-19-related events, the incidence of 
serious infections (Grade ≥ 3 events) was 13.1%, with main reported events of pneumonia 
(4.8%), sepsis (2.2%) and urinary tract infection (1.4%). 
LY3527727 
EU Risk Management Plan (Version 0.3) 
Page 39 of 64 
Infections were primarily managed through concomitant medications with antivirals and 
antibacterial agents, the 2 most commonly used concomitant medication classes in Study 18001, 
and dose interruption in 113 (15.6%) patients. Overall, there were few discontinuations (2.3% of 
patients) and dose reduction in only 2 patients (0.3%) due to infections. There were 130 patients 
(17.9%) with infection-related SAEs (2.5% considered related by the investigator), and 29 
patients with fatal events due to infection. Among the Grade 5 events, over half of these patients 
(15/29, 51.7%) had fatal COVID-19-related events. 
Three fatal infection events were considered related to pirtobrutinib by the investigator: 
Enterococcus faecium-related septic shock, COVID-19 pneumonia and pneumonia necrotising.  
The event of Grade 5 Enterococcus faecium-related septic shock occurred in a patient with CLL, 
within 8 days of the last dose of study drug (on Study Day 23). The patient previously had an AE 
of Grade 3 Escherichia sepsis that began on Study Day 3, the study treatment was interrupted, 
the event resolved on Study Day 16 and was not considered to be related to study treatment. The 
patient had multiple underlying concomitant risk factors; including underlying disease, recent 
splenectomy prior to enrolment and 11 prior lines of therapy. While the investigator did not 
deem pirtobrutinib directly causative, the study treatment was believed to be contributory to the 
event severity. 
The other 2 related Grade 5 infection events occurred in the context of COVID-19 infections. 
The event of bacterial necrotising/cavitary pneumonia occurred concomitantly to a COVID-19 
infection, in a patient with Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia and medical history of 
hypogammaglobulinemia. The Grade 5 event of COVID-19 lung infection was reported in a 
patient with CLL, who had been treated with multiple lines of therapy and had not received 
COVID-19 vaccination. After an internal committee assessment, it was felt that pirtobrutinib 
could not be ruled out as a potential contributing factor to the COVID-19 lung infection, thus the 
event was deemed related by investigator. 
There were 12.7% of patients who reported a TEAE of COVID-19 infection, including 6.5% of 
patients with SAEs (47 patients) and 2.1% (15 patients) with Grade 5 events, only 1 was 
considered related. It is noteworthy to mention that 7 patients who presented with COVID-
related Grade 5 events were from 2 sites in the same country and the COVID-19 pandemic status 
at that time might have had an impact in the occurrence of severe COVID-19 events. Therefore, 
the risk of a severe COVID-19 infection in the studied population might have been further 
enhanced by local case rates, access to treatment and the lack of availability of vaccines during 
the time in which most patients were enrolled in the study. Nevertheless, the proportion of 
patients with COVID-19 events who died due to those events in the OMTSAS (15 of 92 [16.3%] 
patients) is lower than those (30% to 34%) reported elsewhere (Roeker et al. 2020). Patients with 
MCL presented with fewer infection events when compared to patients with CLL (36% versus 
61.1%, respectively) and lower rates of Grade 5 infection events (2.4% versus 6.8%). This could 
in part be explained by the known humoral and cellular immune dysfunction in CLL patients, 
illustrated in part by a higher prevalence of prior hypogammaglobulinemia (13.8% of patients 
with CLL, 1.8% of patients with MCL) and secondary immunodeficiency (1.6% of patients with 
CLL, no patients with MCL) among patients with CLL in Study 18001. The most frequently

reported infection events (excluding COVID-19-related events) of pneumonia, upper respiratory 
tract infection and urinary tract infection are considered ADRs for pirtobrutinib and will be 
further included in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Risk factors and risk groups: 
Identified risk factors for the occurrence of serious infections include neutropenia (with longer 
duration and severity of neutropenia increasing the risk; Crawford et al 2004), delayed 
antimicrobial therapy initiation and patient-related factors (for example, age, previous 
comorbidities, nutritional status, performance status, prior chemotherapy; Nucci and Anaissie 
2017; Xiao et al 2020). It has been described that ≥ 3 prior treatments, diabetes and liver disease 
have been associated with the development of opportunistic infections in patients treated with 
ibrutinib (Rogers et al 2019). 
Preventability: 
Antimicrobial prophylaxis can be considered in patients who are at increased risk of 
opportunistic infections and this is indicated in Section 4.4 of the SmPC (Taplitz et al 2018). 
Prompt initiation of antimicrobial therapy in the event of an infection is also advised in order to 
minimise the risk of serious events (Ramphal 2005; Tang et al 2020). Monitoring neutrophil 
counts and promptly managing neutropenia reduces the risk of developing serious infections. 
Dose interruption instructions in the event of Grade 3 neutropenia with fever and/or infection, 
Grade 4 neutropenia lasting ≥ 7 days or Grade 3 or Grade 4 non-haematologic toxicity is 
included in Section 4.2 of the SmPC.   
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product: 
Serious infections can have a significant impact on individual patients, as they can be associated 
with potentially life-threatening outcomes. Fatal infections have been observed in Study 18001, 
but considering the severity of the treated disease, paucity of alternative treatment options, and 
known predisposition to infections in patients with haematologic malignancies, the risk is 
considered to have a low impact on the risk-benefit balance of pirtobrutinib. In addition, 
considering a significant number of the fatal infection events were driven by COVID-19 
infection, it is expected the incidence of such events will go down as vaccination rates rise 
worldwide, therapeutic interventions become broadly available, and the severity of cases reduces 
accordingly.  
Public health impact: 
Considering that serious infections during the treatment with pirtobrutinib have been observed at 
a lower frequency when compared to other BTK inhibitors, and also the limited patient 
population exposed to pirtobrutinib, the public health impact is estimated to be low.  
Important Identified Risk 3: Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter 
Potential mechanisms: 
LY3527727 
EU Risk Management Plan (Version 0.3) 
Page 41 of 64 
The exact mechanisms linking atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter to BTK inhibitors is unknown. 
Patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia, a primary immunodeficiency disease, characterised 
by BTK deficiency, secondary to BTK gene mutations, do not have a higher risk of developing 
atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, implying that other kinases may be involved in the 
pathophysiology of such events (Tang et al 2018). This is corroborated by the fact that more 
selective BTK inhibitors, with reduced off-target activity, present a lower rate of atrial 
fibrillation and atrial flutter compared to less selective BTK inhibitors, such as ibrutinib 
(Brukinsa package insert, 2019; Calquence package insert, 2019; Imbruvica package insert, 
2020; Brukinsa summary of product characteristics 2019; Calquence summary of product 
characteristics, 2019; Imbruvica summary of product characteristics, 2020). McMullen et al. 
2014 hypothesised that the first generation BTK inhibitor ibrutinib causes atrial fibrillation by 
inhibition of BTK and related kinases such as tec protein tyrosine kinase, ultimately impacting 
the protective PI3K–Akt pathway in the heart.  
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence: 
Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter are considered class effects based on the safety profile of other 
BTK inhibitors, although they are less frequently reported with the second-generation (and more 
selective) covalent agents (that is, acalabrutinib and zanubrutinib). 
Considering atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter are known adverse reactions for both first and 
second generation BTKi with suggested mechanisms of actions and described in section 4.8 of 
the pirtobrutinib SmPC, atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter are considered important identified 
risks and will be further characterised in the Phase 3 clinical trials.  
Characterisation of the risk: 
The overall incidence of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter TEAEs was 2.6% (19 patients out of 
which 17 with atrial fibrillation and 3 with atrial flutter). Most of the events were Grades 1 or2 
(12 patients, 1.65%), and there was a total of 7 patients with Grades ≥3 events (1.0%), Overall, 5 
events (0.7% of patients) were considered related by the investigator, and only 1 of those was a 
Grade ≥3 event. No Grade 5 events were reported. While 4 patients (0.6%) had to undergo dose 
interruption, no patient underwent dose reduction or treatment discontinuation due to atrial 
fibrillation or atrial flutter.  
It is noteworthy to mention that 11.3% (n = 82) and 0.6% (n = 4) of patients in study 18001 had a 
medical history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, respectively. This includes 6 out of the 19 
patients with TEAEs of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter events described here. Additionally, 
among the patients with TEAE of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, 11 had other relevant 
comorbidities or significant risk factors for the occurrence of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter (for 
example, hypertension, coronary artery disease, aortic stenosis, acute myocardial infarction, 
cardiac failure, pacemaker insertion, asymptomatic bradycardia incidents, atrial septal 
defect/supraventricular tachycardia).  
Out of the 19 patients, 10 patients had a past medical history of atrial fibrillation (2 patients), 
concurrent systematic infection (4 patients), or both (4 patients). Additionally, 2 of the 19 
LY3527727 
EU Risk Management Plan (Version 0.3) 
Page 42 of 64 
patients had atrial fibrillation events with temporal fever events, 1 had an atrial fibrillation event 
during worsening heart failure, and another patient’s atrial fibrillation event developed during an 
endoscopy procedure and was cardioverted. 
Risk factors and risk groups: 
Patients at risk for the occurrence of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter include those with a 
history of coronary artery disease (especially if complicated with acute myocardial infarction or 
heart failure; Crenshaw et al 1997), congestive heart failure (Santhanakrishnan et al 2016), 
hypertension (Krahn et al 1995), valvular heart disease (Grigioni et al 2002). Other conditions 
that predispose the occurrence of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter include infectious events 
(Musher et al 2007), hyperthyroidism (Woeber 1992), obesity (Nalliah et al 2016) and alcohol 
consumption (Ettinger et al 1978).  
Preventability: 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC advises to monitor for signs and symptoms of atrial fibrillation and 
atrial flutter and to obtain an ECG as medically indicated. ECG patterns associated with atrial 
fibrillation and atrial flutter are distinctive of such conditions and lead to prompt recognition and 
treatment, which ultimately minimises the risk of serious outcomes.  
In addition, dose interruption instructions in the event of a Grade 3 or 4 non-haematologic 
toxicity are included in Section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product: 
Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, if not promptly recognised and treated, can lead to significant 
morbidity and in some cases to serious outcomes, such as cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, 
myocardial ischaemia and thromboembolic events (Chen et al 2014; Lip and Apostolakis 2014). 
Since the observed incidences of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter in Study 18001 are low, and 
considering that such events are rapidly recognised, manageable and potentially reversible, the 
impact of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter on the risk-benefit balance of pirtobrutinib is 
considered limited. 
Public health impact: 
Considering the incidence of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter reported in Study 18001, which is 
within what is expected for the treated population, and limited population exposed to 
pirtobrutinib, the public health impact is estimated to be low. 
Important Potential Risk 1: Second primary non-melanoma skin cancer 
Potential mechanisms: 
NHL, including MCL, and CLL, are associated with an increased risk of second primary non-
melanoma skin cancer, due to reasons such as perturbed immune function and DNA damage 
secondary to prior treatment (Benjamini et al 2015; Bond et al 2020; Kyasa et al 2004). 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence: 
LY3527727 
EU Risk Management Plan (Version 0.3) 
Page 43 of 64 
Second primary non-melanoma skin cancer has been described in the labels of other BTK 
inhibitors as an important identified risk (“second primary malignancy”) for acalabrutinib; 
important potential risk (Second primary non-melanoma skin cancer) for zanubrutinib. Non-
melanoma skin cancer was also the most common second primary malignancy reported with 
other BTKi drugs: the incidence of second primary malignancy skin cancer (mostly non-
melanoma skin cancer) ranged from 4 to 13% for ibrutinib (Imbruvica package insert, 2013), and 
6% for acalabrutinib and zanubrutinib (Calquence package insert, 2022; Brukinsa package insert, 
2019). 
There have been cases of SPM observed in Study 18001 (6.6% of patients) and most of those 
were non melanoma skin cancers (4.6%). Given there is a high predisposition of skin cancers 
among the patients with the types of haematologic malignancies evaluated in Study 18001 and 
considering that such events are not uncommon in the elderly population, second primary non-
melanoma skin cancer is considered to be an important potential risk for pirtobrutinib since the 
association with the drug is still unclear. 
In order to characterize both risks of second primary malignancies other than non-melanoma skin 
cancer and second primary non-melanoma skin cancer an integrated analysis of reports of all 
second primary malignancy in 5 years follow up of clinical trials supplemented with analysis of 
post marketing reports will be conducted. This analysis is included as an additional PV activity 
for this risk (refer to part III.2 Additional Pharmacovigilance Activities). 
Characterisation of the risk:  
In Study 18001, 33 patients reported second primary non-melanoma skin cancer (4.6%). The 
main events were basal cell carcinoma (3.6%, 26 patients) and squamous cell carcinoma (1.4%, 
10 patients)  
All except one were Grades 1 to 2 (4.4% of patients). Only 3 patients had events assessed as 
related to pirtobrutinib by the investigator (0.4%) and the occurrence of second primary non-
melanoma skin cancer did not lead to dose reduction. Two patients discontinued due to event 
(0.3%); neither of which was considered related to pirtobrutinib. 
The median time to onset of second primary non-melanoma skin cancer diagnosis was 39 weeks. 
Three (0.4%) patients developed second primary non-melanoma skin cancer within the first 4 
weeks of treatment, 3 (0.4%) patients had onset between 5 and 8 weeks, 3 (0.4%) patients had 
onset between 9 and 12 weeks, and 22 (3.0%) patients had onset after more than 12 weeks on 
treatment. While some of the late onset events may have been compounded by the on-target 
effects of pirtobrutinib treatment and its resultant immunosuppression, those with earlier onset 
events are less likely to have been impacted by pirtobrutinib and more likely reflect the impact of 
underlying disease and prior treatment history. 
Of note, past medical history of neoplasms (benign and malign conditions) was observed in 25% 
of the study population (181 patients). In addition, among patients with non-melanoma skin 
cancer (n = 33), 15 had a medical history of skin cancer (basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell 
LY3527727 
EU Risk Management Plan (Version 0.3) 
Page 44 of 64 
carcinoma or melanoma) or pre-cancerous lesions (actinic keratosis), which might suggest an 
increased propensity for the development of non-melanoma skin cancer in these patients.  
Risk factors and risk groups: 
Significant and unprotected sun exposure, fair skin color, smoking, advanced age, male gender, 
specific comorbidities (for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cirrhosis), and 
previous treatment (radiotherapy, fludarabine-combination chemotherapy, BTK inhibitors) are 
considered risk factors for the occurrence of second primary malignancy in patients with CLL or 
MCL (Morrison et al 2002; Lam et al 2005; Chien et al 2015; Bond et al 2020).  
Preventability: 
Most of the SPM cases observed are skin cancers, therefore advice on protection from sun 
exposure and on monitoring patients for the appearance of suspicious skin lesions is provided in 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC. In Study18001, active second malignancy unless in remission and with 
life expectancy > 2 years are excluded from enrolment and similar guidance is provided in other 
phase 3 studies in order to prevent development of cancer in high risk population. 
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product: 
Non-melanoma skin cancer was the main type of SPM observed, with most non-melanoma skin 
cancer events being low grade. Considering that skin cancers are potentially preventable and 
curable if diagnosed early, SPM is considered to not have a significant impact on the risk-benefit 
balance of pirtobrutinib.  
Public health impact: 
Second primary non-melanoma skin cancers have been observed in a small subset of patients in 
Study 18001, the majority of events were composed of low-grade non-melanoma skin cancer, 
and the indication of pirtobrutinib is limited to a subset of haematologic malignancies, therefore, 
the public health impact is estimated to be low. 
Important Potential Risk 2: Second primary malignancies other than non-melanoma skin 
cancer 
Potential mechanisms: 
NHL, including MCL, and CLL, are associated with an increased risk of second primary 
malignancy, due to reasons such as perturbed immune function and DNA damage secondary to 
prior treatment (Benjamini et al 2015; Bond et al 2020;Kyasa et al 2004).  
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence:  
Second primary malignancy has been described in with the labels of other BTK inhibitors and as 
an important identified risk for acalabrutinib (second primary malignancy); important potential 
risk for ibrutinib (other malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) and zanubrutinib 
[Second primary malignancies (other than non-melanoma skin cancer)]  
LY3527727 
 
EU Risk Management Plan (Version 0.3) 
Page 45 of 64 
In Study18001 study 2.3% of patients reported second primary malignancies other than non-
melanoma skin cancer. Although the causal association with pirtobrutinib is still unclear, 
considering an increased risk of second primary malignancy associated with haematologic 
malignancies, especially in the older age group similar to our study population and the 
immunomodulatory effect of BTKi class of drugs SPM other than non-melanoma skin cancer is 
considered to be an important potential risk for pirtobrutinib.  
In order to characterize both risks of second primary malignancies other than non-melanoma skin 
cancer and second primary non-melanoma skin cancer an integrated analysis of reports of all 
second primary malignancy in 5 years follow up of clinical trials supplemented with analysis of 
post marketing reports will be conducted. This analysis is included as an additional PV activity 
for this risk (refer to part III.2 Additional Pharmacovigilance Activities). 
Characterisation of the risk:  
In Study 18001, 17 patients reported second primary malignancies other than non-melanoma 
skin cancer (2.3%). The main events were malignant melanoma in 3 patients (0.4 %) and 2 
events each of malignant melanoma in situ, second primary malignancy and squamous cell 
carcinoma of head and neck.  
Eight events were reported with higher grade severity of ≥3 (1.1% of patients) and there was no 
fatal case. Only 2 patients had events assessed as related to pirtobrutinib by the investigator 
(0.3%) and the occurrence of SPM did not lead to dose reduction. Two patients discontinued 
treatment due to SPM (0.3%); these 2 events were considered related to pirtobrutinib. 
The median time to onset of second primary malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancer 
diagnosis was 36 weeks. One (0.1%) patient developed the event within the first 4 weeks of 
treatment, 2 (0.3%) patients had onset between 5 and 8 weeks, and 13 (1.8%) patients had onset 
after more than 12 weeks on treatment. While some of the late onset events may have been 
compounded by the on-target effects of pirtobrutinib treatment and its resultant 
immunosuppression, those with earlier onset events are less likely to have been impacted by 
pirtobrutinib and more likely reflect the impact of underlying disease and prior treatment history. 
Of note, past medical history of neoplasms (benign and malign conditions) was observed in 25% 
of the study population (181 patients).  
Risk factors and risk groups:  
Smoking, advanced age, male gender, specific comorbidities (for example, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, cirrhosis), previous treatment (radiotherapy, fludarabine-combination 
chemotherapy, BTK inhibitors), significant and unprotected sun exposure are considered risk 
factors for the occurrence of second primary malignancy in patients with CLL or MCL 
(Morrison et al. 2002; Lam et al. 2005; Chien et al. 2015; Bond et al. 2020).  
Preventability:  
LY3527727 
 
EU Risk Management Plan (Version 0.3) 
Page 46 of 64 
In Study 18001 active second malignancy unless in remission and with life expectancy >2 years 
are excluded from enrolment and similar guidance is provided in other Phase 3 studies in order to 
prevent development of cancer in high risk population. Additionally, risk of second primary 
malignancy has been communicated through label for the awareness of the prescribers. 
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product:  
Second primary malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancer has been reported with a 
very low frequency, with most SPM events are judged as not related to pirtobrutinib by the 
investigator. Therefore, the risk is considered to not have a significant impact on the risk-benefit 
balance of pirtobrutinib.  
Public health impact:  
Second primary malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancer have been observed in a 
small subset of patients in Study 18001 and the indication of pirtobrutinib is limited to a subset 
of haematologic malignancies; therefore, the public health impact is estimated to be low.

III.2 Additional Pharmacovigilance Activities  
No other specific additional pharmacovigilance activities are planned. However, further safety 
information to confirm the positive benefit-risk of the conditional marketing authorisation for 
pirtobrutinib for the treatment of MCL will be established in the confirmatory Phase 3 Study 
LOXO-BTK-20019 for MCL. This study is included as a post-authorisation efficacy study (see 
Part IV in this RMP). 
In order to characterise the risk of second primary malignancies other than non-melanoma skin 
cancer and second primary non-melanoma skin cancer, an integrated analysis of SPM in 5 years 
follow up of clinical trials supplemented with analysis of post marketing reports of SPM will be 
conducted. The Applicant has a post marketing commitment with the US FDA to provide an 
integrated safety analysis of approximately 1400 patients treated with pirtobrutinib 200mg 
monotherapy) with haematologic malignancies treated with pirtobrutinib monotherapy at the 200 
mg daily dose in clinical trials. The clinical trials contributing to this analysis are Phase 1/2 
Study 18001 and four ongoing randomised Phase 3 studies, including the Study LOXO-BTK-
20019 in the MCL population. The integrated safety analysis will focus on the SPM incidence 
rates, types, severity, time to onset, potential predisposing factors, and outcomes. Patients from 
the Phase 1/2 Study 18001 will have a minimum follow-up of 5 years and patients from the four 
ongoing randomized Phase 3 studies will have up to 5 years of follow-up to assess SPM. See the 
Section III.3 Summary Table of Additional Pharmacovigilance Activities for details on timelines 
for fulfilment of this commitment.

Part VI: Summary of the Risk Management Plan  
Summary of Risk Management Plan for pirtobrutinib  
This is a summary of the RMP for pirtobrutinib. The RMP details important risks of 
pirtobrutinib, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about pirtobrutinib’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Pirtobrutinib’s SmPC and package leaflet give essential information to healthcare professionals 
and patients on how pirtobrutinib should be used.  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
pirtobrutinib’s RMP. 
I - The Medicine and What It is Used for  
Pirtobrutinib is proposed as a single agent for the treatment of adult patients with MCL who have 
been previously treated with a BTK inhibitor (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains 
pirtobrutinib as the active substance and it is given by oral dosing in the form of a film-coated 
tablets in dose strengths of 50 mg or 100 mg.  
II - Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or 
Further Characterise the Risks  
Important risks of pirtobrutinib, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about pirtobrutinib’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals. 
 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging. 
  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to 
ensure that the medicine is used correctly. 
  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., 
with or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute 
routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of pirtobrutinib is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of Important Risks and Missing Information  
Important risks of pirtobrutinib are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important 
LY3527727 
EU Risk Management Plan (Version 0.3) 
Page 57 of 64 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of pirtobrutinib. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has not been established and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information 
on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on 
the long-term use of the medicine).

II.B Summary of Important Risks  
Important Identified Risk 1: Serious haemorrhage 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Serious haemorrhagic events have been reported at a low frequency in 
Study 18001, compared with that expected from a highly selective BTK 
inhibitor. However, clinically significant events have been observed which 
included higher grade and fatal events. Since haemorrhage is considered a 
class effect and characterised as an important identified risk for the 
authorised BTK inhibitors, the risk of serious haemorrhage will be 
classified as an important identified risk. 
Patients presenting with severe thrombocytopenia are at increased risk of 
serious haemorrhagic events (Neunert et al 2015). Other reported risk 
factors for the occurrence of major haemorrhage in patients with MCL and 
other haematologic malignancies include history of major haemorrhage, 
concomitant use of anticoagulants (for example, warfarin, heparin, 
enoxaparin) and antiplatelets (for example, acetylsalicylic acid, 
clopidogrel), renal disease, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and alcohol abuse 
(Georgantopoulos et al. 2019, Dmitrieva et al. 2020).  
General medical conditions associated with increased propensity for 
haemorrhagic events include acquired coagulopathies, inherited bleeding 
dysfunctions, hepatopathy, renal dysfunction (leading to uraemia-induced 
platelet dysfunction; Boccardo et al. 2004), and connective tissue disorders 
leading to haematologic abnormalities. 
Risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
  Recommendation to monitor patients for signs and symptoms of 
bleeding is included in SmPC Section 4.4. 
  Recommendation to consider the benefit-risk of anticoagulant or 
antiplatelet therapy when co-administered with pirtobrutinib is 
included in SmPC Section 4.4. A statement is included in the 
same section that the use of pirtobrutinib has not been studied 
with warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists.

Important Identified Risk 2: Serious infections 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
The occurrence of serious infections has the potential to impact the risk-
benefit balance of pirtobrutinib. Grades ≥3 events observed in 17.7% of 
patients (2.8% of patients with events deemed related to pirtobrutinib by 
the investigator) and 29 (4.0%) patients with fatal events due to infection, 
of which 3 were considered related to pirtobrutinib by the investigator.  
Serious infections have been commonly reported in patients taking other 
BTK inhibitors (Teh et al 2018, Estupiñán et al 2021), nevertheless, 
sustained increases in serum IgA levels induced by ibrutinib and 
acalabrutinib have been observed, and this finding has been correlated 
with a lower risk of developing infections with long-term BTK inhibitor 
therapy (Byrd et al 2015; Pleyer et al 2020).  
Although the frequency of serious infections in Study 18001 is lower when 
compared to other BTK inhibitors and patients with B-cell malignancies 
are predisposed to infections, serious infections are a class label risk with a 
known mechanism of action, described in Section 4.8 of the SmPC and 
have potential for severe clinical outcomes; therefore, considered an 
important identified risk for pirtobrutinib. This risk will be closely 
monitored and further characterised in the Phase 3 clinical trials. 
Identified risk factors for the occurrence of serious infections include 
neutropenia (with longer duration and severity of neutropenia increasing 
the risk; Crawford et al 2004), delayed antimicrobial therapy initiation and 
patient-related factors (e.g., age, previous comorbidities, nutritional status, 
performance status, prior chemotherapy;  Nucci and Anaissie 2017; Xiao 
et al 2020). It has been described that ≥ 3 prior treatments, diabetes and 
liver disease have been associated with the development of opportunistic 
infections in patients treated with ibrutinib (Rogers et al 2019).

Important Identified Risk 3: atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter are considered class effects based on the 
safety profile of other BTK inhibitors, although they are less frequently 
reported with the second-generation (and more selective) covalent agents 
(i.e., acalabrutinib and zanubrutinib). 
Considering atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter are known adverse reaction 
for both first and second generation BTK inhibitors with suggested 
mechanisms of actions and described in Section 4.8 of the SmPC, atrial 
fibrillation and atrial flutter are considered important identified risks and 
will be further characterised in the Phase 3 clinical trials. 
Patients at risk for the occurrence of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter 
include those with a history of coronary artery disease (especially if 
complicated with acute myocardial infarction or heart failure; Crenshaw et 
al 1997), congestive heart failure (Santhanakrishnan et al 2016), 
hypertension (Krahn et al 1995) and valvular heart disease (Grigioni et al 
2002). Other conditions that predispose the occurrence of atrial fibrillation 
and atrial flutter include infectious events (Musher et al 2007), 
hyperthyroidism (Woeber 1992), obesity (Nalliah et al 2016) and alcohol 
consumption (Ettinger et al 1978).  
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
  Recommendation to monitor for signs and symptoms of atrial 
fibrillation and atrial flutter and obtain an ECG as medically 
indicated is included in SmPC Section 4.4. 
  Guidance on dose interruption based on the grade of atrial 
fibrillation/atrial flutter is included in Section 4.2 
  Communication to the prescribers of ADRs atrial fibrillation and 
atrial flutter through labelling under the SmPC Section 4.8.

Important Potential Risk 1: second primary malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancer   
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Second primary malignancy has been described in association with other 
BTK inhibitors and is included as an important potential risk for ibrutinib 
(“other malignancies [excluding non-melanoma skin cancer]”) and 
LY3527727

identified risk (“non-melanoma skin cancer”) for ibrutinib and as an 
important identified risk (“second primary malignancy”) for acalabrutinib 
(Ghia et al 2020; Sharman et al 2020).  
In Study 18001 study 2.3% of patients reported second primary 
malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancer. Although, the 
association with the drug is still unclear, considerinng an increased risk of 
second primary malignancy associated with haematologic malignancies, 
especially in the older age group similar to our study population and the 
immunomodulatory effect of BTKi class of drugs SPM other than non-
melanoma skin cancer is considered to be an important potential risk for 
pirtobrutinib  
Smoking, advanced age, male gender, specific comorbidities (e.g., chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, cirrhosis), previous treatment 
(radiotherapy, fludarabine-combination chemotherapy, BTK inhibitors), 
excessive and unprotected sun exposure are considered risk factors for the 
occurrence of second primary malignancy in patients with MCL and other 
haematologic malignancies (Bond et al 2020; Chien et al 2015; Lam et al 
2005; Morrison et al 2002).

Important Potential Risk 2: second primary non-melanoma skin cancer 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Second primary non-melanoma skin cancer has been described in the 
labels of other BTK inhibitors and as an important identified risk (“second 
primary malignancy”) for acalabrutinib; important potential risk (Second 
primary non-melanoma skin cancer) for zanubrutinib.There have been 
cases of SPM observed in Study 18001 (6.6% of patients) and most of 
those were non-melanoma skin cancers (4.6%) with basal cell carcinoma 
(3.6%, 26 patients) and squamous cell carcinoma (1.4%, 10 patients) being 
the most common subtypes; 2.3% of patients reported second primary 
malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancer.. Given there is a high 
predisposition of skin cancers among patients with the types of 
haematologic malignancies evaluated in Study 18001 and considering that 
such events are not uncommon in the elderly population, SPM will be 
considered an important potential risk for pirtobrutinib since the 
association with the drug is still unclear. 
Smoking, advanced age, male gender, specific comorbidities (e.g., chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, cirrhosis), previous treatment 
(radiotherapy, fludarabine-combination chemotherapy, BTK inhibitors), 
excessive and unprotected sun exposure are considered risk factors for the 
occurrence of second primary malignancy in patients with MCL and other 
haematologic malignancies (Bond et al. 2020; Chien et al. 2015; Lam et al. 
2005; Morrison et al. 2002).

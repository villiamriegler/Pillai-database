4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of erectile dysfunction in adult males.
In order for tadalafil to be effective, sexual stimulation is required.
Tadalafil Mylan is not indicated for use by women.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Posology
Adult men
In general, the recommended dose is 10 mg taken prior to anticipated sexual activity and with or without 
food.
In those patients in whom tadalafil 10 mg does not produce an adequate effect, 20 mg might be tried.
It may be taken at least 30 minutes prior to sexual activity.
The maximum dose frequency is once per day.
Tadalafil 10 and 20 mg is intended for use prior to anticipated sexual activity and it is not recommended for 
continuous daily use.
In patients who anticipate a frequent use of tadalafil (i.e., at least twice weekly) a once daily regimen with 
the lowest doses of tadalafil might be considered suitable, based on patient choice and the physician’s 
judgement.
In these patients the recommended dose is 5 mg taken once a day at approximately the same time of day. The 
dose may be decreased to 2.5 mg once a day based on individual tolerability.
The appropriateness of continued use of the daily regimen should be reassessed periodically.
2
Special populations
Elderly men
Dose adjustments are not required in elderly patients.
Men with renal impairment
Dose adjustments are not required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. For patients with 
severe renal impairment 10 mg is the maximum recommended dose. Once-a-day dosing of tadalafil is not 
recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).
Men with hepatic impairment
The recommended dose of tadalafil is 10 mg taken prior to anticipated sexual activity and with or without 
food. There is limited clinical data on the safety of tadalafil in patients with severe hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh Class C); if prescribed, a careful individual benefit/risk evaluation should be undertaken by the 
prescribing physician. There are no available data about the administration of doses higher than 10 mg of 
tadalafil to patients with hepatic impairment. Once-a-day dosing has not been evaluated in patients with 
hepatic impairment; therefore, if prescribed, a careful individual benefit/risk evaluation should be undertaken 
by the prescribing physician (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).
Men with diabetes
Dose adjustments are not required in diabetic patients.
Paediatric population
There is no relevant use of tadalafil in the paediatric population with regard to the treatment of erectile 
dysfunction.
Method of administration
Tadalafil Mylan is available as 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 mg film-coated tablets for oral use.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
In clinical studies, tadalafil was shown to augment the hypotensive effects of nitrates. This is thought to 
result from the combined effects of nitrates and tadalafil on the nitric oxide/cGMP pathway.
Therefore, administration of tadalafil to patients who are using any form of organic nitrate is contraindicated 
(see section 4.5).
Tadalafil must not be used in men with cardiac disease for whom sexual activity is inadvisable.
Physicians should consider the potential cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with pre-existing 
cardiovascular disease.
The following groups of patients with cardiovascular disease were not included in clinical trials and the use 
of tadalafil is therefore contraindicated:
-
-
-
-
-
patients with myocardial infarction within the last 90 days,
patients with unstable angina or angina occurring during sexual intercourse,
patients with New York Heart Association Class 2 or greater heart failure in the last 6 months,
patients with uncontrolled arrhythmias, hypotension (< 90/50 mm Hg), or uncontrolled hypertension,
patients with a stroke within the last 6 months.
Tadalafil is contraindicated in patients who have loss of vision in one eye because of non-arteritic anterior 
ischaemic optic neuropathy (NAION), regardless of whether this episode was in connection or not with 
previous PDE5 inhibitor exposure (see section 4.4).
3
The co-administration of PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, with guanylate cyclase stimulators, such as 
riociguat, is contraindicated as it may potentially lead to symptomatic hypotension (see section 4.5).
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Before treatment with Tadalafil Mylan
A medical history and physical examination should be undertaken to diagnose erectile dysfunction and 
determine potential underlying causes, before pharmacological treatment is considered.
Prior to initiating any treatment for erectile dysfunction, physicians should consider the cardiovascular status 
of their patients, since there is a degree of cardiac risk associated with sexual activity. Tadalafil has 
vasodilator properties, resulting in mild and transient decreases in blood pressure (see section 5.1) and as 
such potentiates the hypotensive effect of nitrates (see section 4.3).
The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the 
identification of appropriate treatment following an appropriate medical assessment. It is not known if 
tadalafil is effective in patients who have undergone pelvic surgery or radical non-nerve sparing 
prostatectomy.
Cardiovascular
Serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, unstable angina 
pectoris, ventricular arrhythmia, stroke, transient ischemic attacks, chest pain, palpitations and tachycardia, 
have been reported either post marketing and/or in clinical trials. Most of the patients in whom these events 
have been reported had pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors. However, it is not possible to definitively 
determine whether these events are related directly to these risk factors, to tadalafil, to sexual activity, or to a 
combination of these or other factors.
In patients receiving concomitant antihypertensive medicinal products, tadalafil may induce a blood pressure 
decrease. When initiating daily treatment with tadalafil, appropriate clinical considerations should be given 
to a possible dose adjustment of the antihypertensive therapy.
In patients who are taking alpha1 blockers, concomitant administration of tadalafil may lead to symptomatic 
hypotension in some patients (see section 4.5). The combination of tadalafil and doxazosin is not 
recommended.
Vision
Visual defects and cases of NAION have been reported in connection with the intake of tadalafil and other 
PDE5 inhibitors. Analyses of observational data suggest an increased risk of acute NAION in men with 
erectile dysfunction following exposure to tadalafil or other PDE5 inhibitors. As this may be relevant for all 
patients exposed to tadalafil, the patient should be advised that in case of sudden visual defect, he should 
stop taking Tadalafil Mylan and consult a physician immediately (see section 4.3).
Decreased or sudden hearing loss
Cases of sudden hearing loss have been reported after the use of tadalafil. Although other risk factors were 
present in some cases (such as age, diabetes, hypertension and previous hearing loss history) patients should 
be advised to stop taking tadalafil and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss 
of hearing.
Renal and hepatic impairment
Due to increased tadalafil exposure (AUC), limited clinical experience and the lack of ability to influence 
clearance by dialysis, once-a-day dosing of tadalafil is not recommended in patients with severe renal 
impairment.
4
There is limited clinical data on the safety of single-dose administration of tadalafil in patients with severe 
hepatic insufficiency (Child-Pugh Class C). Once-a-day administration has not been evaluated in patients 
with hepatic insufficiency. If Tadalafil Mylan is prescribed, a careful individual benefit/risk evaluation 
should be undertaken by the prescribing physician.
Priapism and anatomical deformation of the penis
Patients who experience erections lasting 4 hours or more should be instructed to seek immediate medical 
assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency may 
result.
Tadalafil should be used with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as 
angulation, cavernosal fibrosis or Peyronie's disease), or in patients who have conditions which may 
predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anaemia, multiple myeloma or leukaemia).
Use with CYP3A4 inhibitors
Caution should be exercised when prescribing tadalafil to patients using potent CYP3A4 inhibitors 
(ritonavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, and erythromycin) as increased tadalafil exposure (AUC) 
has been observed if the medicinal products are combined (see section 4.5).
Tadalafil and other treatments for erectile dysfunction
The safety and efficacy of combinations of tadalafil and other PDE5 inhibitors or other treatments for 
erectile dysfunction have not been studied. The patients should be informed not to take Tadalafil Mylan in 
such combinations.
Lactose content
Tadalafil Mylan contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total 
lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.
Sodium content
Tadalafil Mylan contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Interaction studies were conducted with 10 mg and/or 20 mg tadalafil, as indicated below. With regard to 
those interaction studies where only the 10 mg tadalafil dose was used, clinically relevant interactions at 
higher doses cannot be completely ruled out.
Effects of other substances on tadalafil
Cytochrome P450 inhibitors
Tadalafil is principally metabolised by CYP3A4. A selective inhibitor of CYP3A4, ketoconazole (200 mg 
daily), increased tadalafil (10 mg) exposure (AUC) 2-fold and Cmax by 15%, relative to the AUC and Cmax 
values for tadalafil alone. Ketoconazole (400 mg daily) increased tadalafil (20 mg) exposure (AUC) 4-fold 
and Cmax by 22%. Ritonavir, a protease inhibitor (200 mg twice daily), which is an inhibitor of CYP3A4, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, increased tadalafil (20 mg) exposure (AUC) 2-fold with no change in 
Cmax. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other protease inhibitors, such as saquinavir, and 
other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, itraconazole and grapefruit juice should be 
co-administered with caution as they would be expected to increase plasma concentrations of tadalafil (see 
section 4.4).
Consequently the incidence of the adverse reactions listed in section 4.8 might be increased.
5
Transporters
The role of transporters (for example p-glycoprotein) in the disposition of tadalafil is not known.
Therefore there is the potential of drug interactions mediated by inhibition of transporters.
Cytochrome P450 inducers
A CYP3A4 inducer, rifampicin, reduced tadalafil AUC by 88%, relative to the AUC values for tadalafil 
alone (10 mg). This reduced exposure can be anticipated to decrease the efficacy of tadalafil; the magnitude 
of decreased efficacy is unknown. Other inducers of CYP3A4 such as phenobarbital, phenytoin and 
carbamazepine, may also decrease plasma concentrations of tadalafil.
Effects of tadalafil on other medicinal products
Nitrates
In clinical studies, tadalafil (5, 10 and 20 mg) was shown to augment the hypotensive effects of nitrates. 
Therefore, administration of tadalafil to patients who are using any form of organic nitrate is contraindicated 
(see section 4.3). Based on the results of a clinical study in which 150 subjects receiving daily doses of 
tadalafil 20 mg for 7 days and 0.4 mg sublingual nitroglycerin at various times, this interaction lasted for 
more than 24 hours and was no longer detectable when 48 hours had elapsed after the last tadalafil dose. 
Thus, in a patient prescribed any dose of tadalafil (2.5 mg-20 mg), where nitrate administration is deemed 
medically necessary in a life-threatening situation, at least 48 hours should have elapsed after the last dose of 
tadalafil before nitrate administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should only be 
administered under close medical supervision with appropriate haemodynamic monitoring.
Anti-hypertensives (including calcium channel blockers)
The co-administration of doxazosin (4 and 8 mg daily) and tadalafil (5 mg daily dose and 20 mg as a single 
dose) increases the blood pressure-lowering effect of this alpha-blocker in a significant manner. This effect 
lasts at least twelve hours and may be symptomatic, including syncope. Therefore this combination is not 
recommended (see section 4.4).
In interaction studies performed in a limited number of healthy volunteers, these effects were not reported 
with alfuzosin or tamsulosin. However, caution should be exercised when using tadalafil in patients treated 
with any alpha-blockers, and notably in the elderly. Treatments should be initiated at minimal dosage and 
progressively adjusted.
In clinical pharmacology studies, the potential for tadalafil to augment the hypotensive effects of 
antihypertensive medicinal products was examined. Major classes of antihypertensive medicinal products 
were studied, including calcium channel blockers (amlodipine), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitors (enalapril), beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (metoprolol), thiazide diuretics 
(bendroflumethiazide), and angiotensin II receptor blockers (various types and doses, alone or in 
combination with thiazides, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, and/or alpha-blockers). Tadalafil 
(10 mg except for studies with angiotensin II receptor blockers and amlodipine in which a 20 mg dose was 
applied) had no clinically significant interaction with any of these classes. In another clinical pharmacology 
study tadalafil (20 mg) was studied in combination with up to 4 classes of antihypertensives. In subjects 
taking multiple antihypertensives, the ambulatory-blood-pressure changes appeared to relate to the degree of 
blood-pressure control. In this regard, study subjects whose blood pressure was well controlled, the reduction 
was minimal and similar to that seen in healthy subjects. In study subjects whose blood pressure was not 
controlled, the reduction was greater although this reduction was not associated with hypotensive symptoms 
in the majority of subjects. In patients receiving concomitant antihypertensive medicinal products, tadalafil 
20 mg may induce a blood pressure decrease, which (with the exception of alpha blockers -see above-) is, in 
general, minor and not likely to be clinically relevant. Analysis of phase 3 clinical trial data showed no 
difference in adverse events in patients taking tadalafil with or without antihypertensive medicinal products. 
However, appropriate clinical advice should be given to patients regarding a possible decrease in blood 
pressure when they are treated with antihypertensive medicinal products.
Riociguat
Preclinical studies showed an additive systemic blood pressure lowering effect when PDE5 inhibitors were 
combined with riociguat. In clinical studies, riociguat has been shown to augment the hypotensive effects of 
PDE5 inhibitors. There was no evidence of favourable clinical effect of the combination in the population 
6
studied. Concomitant use of riociguat with PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, is contraindicated (see 
section 4.3).  
5-alpha reductase inhibitors
In a clinical trial that compared tadalafil 5 mg coadministered with finasteride 5 mg to placebo plus 
finasteride 5 mg in the relief of BPH symptoms, no new adverse reactions were identified. However, as a 
formal drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effects of tadalafil and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors 
(5-ARIs) has not been performed, caution should be exercised when tadalafil is co-administered with 
5-ARIs.
CYP1A2 substrates (e.g. theophylline)
When tadalafil 10 mg was administered with theophylline (a non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor) in a 
clinical pharmacology study, there was no pharmacokinetic interaction. The only pharmacodynamic effect 
was a small (3.5 bpm) increase in heart rate. Although this effect is minor and was of no clinical significance 
in this study, it should be considered when co-administering these medicinal products.
Ethinylestradiol and terbutaline
Tadalafil has been demonstrated to produce an increase in the oral bioavailability of ethinylestradiol; a 
similar increase may be expected with oral administration of terbutaline, although the clinical consequence 
of this is uncertain.
Alcohol
Alcohol concentrations (mean maximum blood concentration 0.08%) were not affected by co-administration 
with tadalafil (10 mg or 20 mg). In addition, no changes in tadalafil concentrations were seen 3 hours after 
co-administration with alcohol. Alcohol was administered in a manner to maximise the rate of alcohol 
absorption (overnight fast with no food until 2 hours after alcohol).
Tadalafil (20 mg) did not augment the mean blood pressure decrease produced by alcohol (0.7 g/kg or 
approximately 180 ml of 40% alcohol [vodka] in an 80-kg male) but in some subjects, postural dizziness and 
orthostatic hypotension were observed. When tadalafil was administered with lower doses of alcohol 
(0.6 g/kg), hypotension was not observed and dizziness occurred with similar frequency to alcohol alone. 
The effect of alcohol on cognitive function was not augmented by tadalafil (10 mg).
Cytochrome P450 metabolised medicinal products
Tadalafil is not expected to cause clinically significant inhibition or induction of the clearance of medicinal 
products metabolised by CYP450 isoforms. Studies have confirmed that tadalafil does not inhibit or induce 
CYP450 isoforms, including CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19.
CYP2C9 substrates (e.g. R-warfarin)
Tadalafil (10 mg and 20 mg) had no clinically significant effect on exposure (AUC) to S-warfarin or 
R-warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), nor did tadalafil affect changes in prothrombin time induced by warfarin.
Aspirin
Tadalafil (10 mg and 20 mg) did not potentiate the increase in bleeding time caused by acetyl salicylic acid.
Antidiabetic medicinal products
Specific interaction studies with antidiabetic medicinal products were not conducted.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Tadalafil Mylan is not indicated for use by women.
Pregnancy
There are limited data from the use of tadalafil in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or 
indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal 
development (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Tadalafil 
Mylan during pregnancy.
7
Breastfeeding
Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of tadalafil in milk.
A risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. Tadalafil Mylan should not be used during breast feeding.
Fertility
Effects were seen in dogs that might indicate impairment of fertility. Two subsequent clinical studies suggest 
that this effect is unlikely in humans, although a decrease in sperm concentration was seen in some men (see 
sections 5.1 and 5.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Tadalafil has negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Although the frequency of reports 
of dizziness in placebo and tadalafil arms in clinical trials was similar, patients should be aware of how they 
react to tadalafil before driving or using machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients taking tadalafil for the treatment of erectile 
dysfunction or benign prostatic hyperplasia were headache, dyspepsia, back pain and myalgia, in which the 
incidences increase with increasing dose of tadalafil. The adverse reactions reported were transient, and 
generally mild or moderate. The majority of headaches reported with tadalafil once-a-day dosing are 
experienced within the first 10 to 30 days of starting treatment.
Tabulated summary of adverse reactions
The table below lists the adverse reactions observed from spontaneous reporting and in placebo controlled 
clinical trials (comprising a total of 8022 patients on tadalafil and 4422 patients on placebo) for on-demand 
and once-a-day treatment of erectile dysfunction and the once-a-day treatment of benign prostatic 
hyperplasia.

 (1) Most of the patients had pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors (see section 4.4).
(2) Postmarketing surveillance reported adverse reactions not observed in placebo-controlled clinical trials.
(3) More commonly reported when tadalafil is given to patients who are already taking antihypertensive 
medicinal products.
Description of selected adverse reactions
A slightly higher incidence of ECG abnormalities, primarily sinus bradycardia, has been reported in patients 
treated with tadalafil once a day as compared with placebo. Most of these ECG abnormalities were not 
associated with adverse reactions.
Other special populations
Data in patients over 65 years of age receiving tadalafil in clinical trials, either for the treatment of erectile 
dysfunction or the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, are limited. In clinical trials with tadalafil taken 
on demand for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, diarrhoea was reported more frequently in patients over 
65 years of age. In clinical trials with tadalafil 5 mg taken once a day for the treatment of benign prostatic 
hyperplasia, dizziness and diarrhoea were reported more frequently in patients over 75 years of age.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked 
to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
Single doses of up to 500 mg have been given to healthy subjects, and multiple daily doses up to 100 mg 
have been given to patients. Adverse events were similar to those seen at lower doses.
In cases of overdose, standard supportive measures should be adopted as required. Haemodialysis contributes 
negligibly to tadalafil elimination.
5.
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Urologicals, Drugs used in erectile dysfunction, ATC Code: G04BE08.
Mechanism of action
Tadalafil is a selective, reversible inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific 
phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). When sexual stimulation causes the local release of nitric oxide, inhibition 
of PDE5 by tadalafil produces increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. This results in smooth 
muscle relaxation and inflow of blood into the penile tissues, thereby producing an erection. Tadalafil has no 
effect in the absence of sexual stimulation.
Pharmacodynamic effects
Studies in vitro have shown that tadalafil is a selective inhibitor of PDE5. PDE5 is an enzyme found in 
corpus cavernosum smooth muscle, vascular and visceral smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, platelets, kidney, 
lung, and cerebellum. The effect of tadalafil is more potent on PDE5 than on other phosphodiesterases. 
10
Tadalafil is > 10,000-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE1, PDE2, and PDE4 enzymes which are found 
in the heart, brain, blood vessels, liver, and other organs. Tadalafil is > 10,000-fold more potent for PDE5 
than for PDE3, an enzyme found in the heart and blood vessels.
This selectivity for PDE5 over PDE3 is important because PDE3 is an enzyme involved in cardiac 
contractility. Additionally, tadalafil is approximately 700-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE6, an 
enzyme which is found in the retina and is responsible for phototransduction. Tadalafil is also > 10,000-fold 
more potent for PDE5 than for PDE7 through PDE10.
Clinical efficacy and safety
Three clinical studies were conducted in 1054 patients in an at-home setting to define the period of 
responsiveness to tadalafil on demand. Tadalafil demonstrated statistically significant improvement in 
erectile function and the ability to have successful sexual intercourse up to 36 hours following dosing, as 
well as patients’ ability to attain and maintain erections for successful intercourse compared to placebo as 
early as 16 minutes following dosing.
Tadalafil administered to healthy subjects produced no significant difference compared to placebo in supine 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mean maximal decrease of 1.6/0.8 mm Hg, respectively), in standing 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mean maximal decrease of 0.2/4.6 mm Hg, respectively), and no 
significant change in heart rate.
In a study to assess the effects of tadalafil on vision, no impairment of colour discrimination (blue/green) 
was detected using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue test. This finding is consistent with the low affinity of 
tadalafil for PDE6 compared to PDE5. Across all clinical studies, reports of changes in colour vision were 
rare (< 0.1%).
Three studies were conducted in men to assess the potential effect on spermatogenesis of tadalafil 10 mg 
(one 6-month study) and 20 mg (one 6-month and one 9-month study) administered daily. In two of these 
studies decreases were observed in sperm count and concentration related to tadalafil treatment of unlikely 
clinical relevance. These effects were not associated with changes in other parameters such as motility, 
morphology and FSH.
Tadalafil at doses of 2.5, 5, and 10 mg taken once a day was initially evaluated in 3 clinical studies involving 
853 patients of various ages (range 21-82 years) and ethnicities, with erectile dysfunction of various 
severities (mild, moderate, severe) and etiologies. In the two primary efficacy studies of general populations, 
the mean per-subject proportion of successful intercourse attempts were 57 and 67% on tadalafil 5 mg, 50% 
on tadalafil 2.5 mg as compared to 31 and 37% with placebo. In the study in patients with erectile 
dysfunction secondary to diabetes, the mean per-subject proportion of successful attempts were 41 and 46% 
on tadalafil 5 mg and 2.5 mg, respectively, as compared to 28% with placebo. Most patients in these three 
studies were responders to previous on-demand treatment with PDE5 inhibitors. In a subsequent study, 
217 patients who were treatment-naïve to PDE5 inhibitors were randomised to tadalafil 5 mg once a day vs. 
placebo. The mean per-subject proportion of successful sexual intercourse attempts was 68% for tadalafil 
patients compared to 52% for patients on placebo.
In a 12-week study performed in 186 patients (142 tadalafil, 44 placebo) with erectile dysfunction secondary 
to spinal cord injury, tadalafil significantly improved the erectile function leading to a mean per-subject 
proportion of successful attempts in patients treated with tadalafil 10 or 20 mg (flexible-dose, on demand) of 
48% as compared to 17% with placebo.
Paediatric population
A single study has been performed in paediatric patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) in 
which no evidence of efficacy was seen. The randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, 3-arm 
study of tadalafil was conducted in 331 boys aged 7-14 years with DMD receiving concurrent corticosteroid 
therapy. The study included a 48-week double-blind period where patients were randomised to tadalafil 
0.3 mg/kg, tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg, or placebo daily. Tadalafil did not show efficacy in slowing the decline in 
ambulation as measured by the primary 6 minute walk distance (6MWD) endpoint: least squares (LS) mean 
11
change in 6MWD at 48 weeks was -51.0 meters (m) in the placebo group, compared with -64.7 m in the 
tadalafil 0.3 mg/kg group (p = 0.307) and -59.1 m in the tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg group (p = 0.538). In addition, 
there was no evidence of efficacy from any of the secondary analyses performed in this study. The overall 
safety results from this study were generally consistent with the known safety profile of tadalafil and with 
adverse events (AEs) expected in a paediatric DMD population receiving corticosteroids.
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies in all subsets of 
the paediatric population in the treatment of the erectile dysfunction. See section 4.2 for information on 
paediatric use.
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption
Tadalafil is readily absorbed after oral administration and the mean maximum observed plasma 
concentration (Cmax) is achieved at a median time of 2 hours after dosing. Absolute bioavailability of tadalafil 
following oral dosing has not been determined.
The rate and extent of absorption of tadalafil are not influenced by food, thus tadalafil may be taken with or 
without food. The time of dosing (morning versus evening) had no clinically relevant effects on the rate and 
extent of absorption.
Distribution
The mean volume of distribution is approximately 63 l, indicating that tadalafil is distributed into tissues. At 
therapeutic concentrations, 94% of tadalafil in plasma is bound to proteins. Protein binding is not affected by 
impaired renal function.
Less than 0.0005% of the administered dose appeared in the semen of healthy subjects.
Biotransformation
Tadalafil is predominantly metabolised by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 isoform. The major circulating 
metabolite is the methylcatechol glucuronide. This metabolite is at least 13,000-fold less potent than tadalafil 
for PDE5. Consequently, it is not expected to be clinically active at observed metabolite concentrations.
Elimination
The mean oral clearance for tadalafil is 2.5 l/h and the mean half-life is 17.5 hours in healthy subjects. 
Tadalafil is excreted predominantly as inactive metabolites, mainly in the faeces (approximately 61% of the 
dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 36% of the dose).
Linearity/non-linearity
Tadalafil pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects are linear with respect to time and dose. Over a dose range of 
2.5 to 20 mg, exposure (AUC) increases proportionally with dose. Steady-state plasma concentrations are 
attained within 5 days of once-daily dosing.
Pharmacokinetics determined with a population approach in patients with erectile dysfunction are similar to 
pharmacokinetics in subjects without erectile dysfunction.
Special populations
Elderly
Healthy elderly subjects (65 years or over), had a lower oral clearance of tadalafil, resulting in 25% higher 
exposure (AUC) relative to healthy subjects aged 19 to 45 years. This effect of age is not clinically 
significant and does not warrant a dose adjustment.
12
Renal insufficiency
In clinical pharmacology studies using single-dose tadalafil (5 to 20 mg), tadalafil exposure (AUC) 
approximately doubled in subjects with mild (creatinine clearance 51 to 80 ml/min) or moderate (creatinine 
clearance 31 to 50 ml/min) renal impairment and in subjects with end-stage renal disease on dialysis. In 
haemodialysis patients, Cmax was 41% higher than that observed in healthy subjects. Haemodialysis 
contributes negligibly to tadalafil elimination.
Hepatic insufficiency
Tadalafil exposure (AUC) in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and 
B) is comparable to exposure in healthy subjects when a dose of 10 mg is administered. There is limited 
clinical data on the safety of tadalafil in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency (Child-Pugh Class C). 
There are no available data about the administration of once-a-day dosing of tadalafil to patients with hepatic 
impairment. If tadalafil is prescribed once-a-day, a careful individual benefit/risk evaluation should be 
undertaken by the prescribing physician.
Patients with diabetes
Tadalafil exposure (AUC) in patients with diabetes was approximately 19% lower than the AUC value for 
healthy subjects. This difference in exposure does not warrant a dose adjustment.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, 
repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to reproduction.
There was no evidence of teratogenicity, embryotoxicity or foetotoxicity in rats or mice that received up to 
1000 mg/kg/day tadalafil. In a rat prenatal and postnatal development study, the no observed effect dose was 
30 mg/kg/day. In the pregnant rat the AUC for calculated free drug at this dose was approximately 18 times 
the human AUC at a 20 mg dose.
There was no impairment of fertility in male and female rats. In dogs given tadalafil daily for 6 to 12 months 
at doses of 25 mg/kg/day (resulting in at least a 3-fold greater exposure [range 3.7 – 18.6] than seen in 
humans given a single 20 mg dose) and above, there was regression of the seminiferous tubular epithelium 
that resulted in a decrease in spermatogenesis in some dogs. See also section 5.1.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of erectile dysfunction in adult males.
In order for tadalafil to be effective for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, sexual stimulation is required.
Treatment of the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia in adult males.
Tadalafil Mylan is not indicated for use by women.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Posology
Erectile dysfunction in adult men
In general, the recommended dose is 10 mg taken prior to anticipated sexual activity and with or without 
food.
In those patients in whom tadalafil 10 mg does not produce an adequate effect, 20 mg might be tried.
It may be taken at least 30 minutes prior to sexual activity.
The maximum dose frequency is once per day.
Tadalafil 10 and 20 mg is intended for use prior to anticipated sexual activity and it is not recommended for 
continuous daily use.
In patients who anticipate a frequent use of tadalafil (i.e., at least twice weekly) a once daily regimen with 
the lowest doses of tadalafil might be considered suitable, based on patient choice and the physician’s 
judgement.
In these patients the recommended dose is 5 mg taken once a day at approximately the same time of day. The 
dose may be decreased to 2.5 mg once a day based on individual tolerability.
15
The appropriateness of continued use of the daily regimen should be reassessed periodically.
Benign prostatic hyperplasia in adult men
The recommended dose is 5 mg, taken at approximately the same time every day with or without food. For 
adult men being treated for both benign prostatic hyperplasia and erectile dysfunction the recommended dose 
is also 5 mg taken at approximately the same time every day. Patients who are unable to tolerate tadalafil 
5 mg for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia should consider an alternative therapy as the efficacy 
of tadalafil 2.5 mg for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia has not been demonstrated.
Special populations
Elderly men
Dose adjustments are not required in elderly patients.
Men with renal impairment
Dose adjustments are not required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. For patients with 
severe renal impairment 10 mg is the maximum recommended dose for on-demand treatment.
Once-a-day dosing of 2.5 or 5 mg tadalafil both for the treatment of erectile dysfunction or benign prostatic 
hyperplasia is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).
Men with hepatic impairment
For the treatment of erectile dysfunction using on-demand tadalafil the recommended dose of tadalafil is 
10 mg taken prior to anticipated sexual activity and with or without food. There is limited clinical data on the 
safety of tadalafil in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); if prescribed, a careful 
individual benefit/risk evaluation should be undertaken by the prescribing physician. There are no available 
data about the administration of doses higher than 10 mg of tadalafil to patients with hepatic impairment.
Once-a-day dosing of tadalafil both for the treatment of erectile dysfunction and benign prostatic hyperplasia 
has not been evaluated in patients with hepatic impairment; therefore, if prescribed, a careful individual 
benefit/risk evaluation should be undertaken by the prescribing physician (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).
Men with diabetes
Dose adjustments are not required in diabetic patients.
Paediatric population
There is no relevant use of tadalafil in the paediatric population with regard to the treatment of erectile 
dysfunction.
Method of administration
Tadalafil Mylan is available as 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 mg film-coated tablets for oral use.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
In clinical studies, tadalafil was shown to augment the hypotensive effects of nitrates. This is thought to 
result from the combined effects of nitrates and tadalafil on the nitric oxide/cGMP pathway.
Therefore, administration of tadalafil to patients who are using any form of organic nitrate is contraindicated 
(see section 4.5).
Tadalafil must not be used in men with cardiac disease for whom sexual activity is inadvisable.
Physicians should consider the potential cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with pre-existing 
cardiovascular disease.
16
The following groups of patients with cardiovascular disease were not included in clinical trials and the use 
of tadalafil is therefore contraindicated:
-
-
-
-
-
patients with myocardial infarction within the last 90 days,
patients with unstable angina or angina occurring during sexual intercourse,
patients with New York Heart Association Class 2 or greater heart failure in the last 6 months,
patients with uncontrolled arrhythmias, hypotension (< 90/50 mm Hg), or uncontrolled hypertension,
patients with a stroke within the last 6 months.
Tadalafil is contraindicated in patients who have loss of vision in one eye because of non-arteritic anterior 
ischaemic optic neuropathy (NAION), regardless of whether this episode was in connection or not with 
previous PDE5 inhibitor exposure (see section 4.4).
The co-administration of PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, with guanylate cyclase stimulators, such as 
riociguat, is contraindicated as it may potentially lead to symptomatic hypotension (see section 4.5).
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Before treatment with Tadalafil Mylan
A medical history and physical examination should be undertaken to diagnose erectile dysfunction or benign 
prostatic hyperplasia and determine potential underlying causes, before pharmacological treatment is 
considered.
Prior to initiating any treatment for erectile dysfunction, physicians should consider the cardiovascular status 
of their patients, since there is a degree of cardiac risk associated with sexual activity. Tadalafil has 
vasodilator properties, resulting in mild and transient decreases in blood pressure (see section 5.1) and as 
such potentiates the hypotensive effect of nitrates (see section 4.3).
Prior to initiating treatment with tadalafil for benign prostatic hyperplasia patients should be examined to 
rule out the presence of carcinoma of the prostate and carefully assessed for cardiovascular conditions (see 
section 4.3).
The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the 
identification of appropriate treatment following an appropriate medical assessment. It is not known if 
tadalafil is effective in patients who have undergone pelvic surgery or radical non-nerve sparing 
prostatectomy.
Cardiovascular
Serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, unstable angina 
pectoris, ventricular arrhythmia, stroke, transient ischemic attacks, chest pain, palpitations and tachycardia, 
have been reported either post marketing and/or in clinical trials. Most of the patients in whom these events 
have been reported had pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors. However, it is not possible to definitively 
determine whether these events are related directly to these risk factors, to tadalafil, to sexual activity, or to a 
combination of these or other factors.
In patients receiving concomitant antihypertensive medicinal products, tadalafil may induce a blood pressure 
decrease. When initiating daily treatment with tadalafil, appropriate clinical considerations should be given 
to a possible dose adjustment of the antihypertensive therapy.
In patients who are taking alpha1 blockers, concomitant administration of tadalafil may lead to symptomatic 
hypotension in some patients (see section 4.5). The combination of tadalafil and doxazosin is not 
recommended.
Vision
17
Visual defects and cases of NAION have been reported in connection with the intake of tadalafil and other 
PDE5 inhibitors. Analyses of observational data suggest an increased risk of acute NAION in men with 
erectile dysfunction following exposure to tadalafil or other PDE5 inhibitors. As this may be relevant for all 
patients exposed to tadalafil, the patient should be advised that in case of sudden visual defect, he should 
stop taking Tadalafil Mylan and consult a physician immediately (see section 4.3).
Decreased or sudden hearing loss
Cases of sudden hearing loss have been reported after the use of tadalafil. Although other risk factors were 
present in some cases (such as age, diabetes, hypertension and previous hearing loss history) patients should 
be advised to stop taking tadalafil and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss 
of hearing.
Renal and hepatic impairment
Due to increased tadalafil exposure (AUC), limited clinical experience and the lack of ability to influence 
clearance by dialysis, once-a-day dosing of tadalafil is not recommended in patients with severe renal 
impairment.
There is limited clinical data on the safety of single-dose administration of tadalafil in patients with severe 
hepatic insufficiency (Child-Pugh Class C). Once-a-day administration either for the treatment of erectile 
dysfunction or benign prostatic hyperplasia has not been evaluated in patients with hepatic insufficiency. If 
Tadalafil Mylan is prescribed, a careful individual benefit/risk evaluation should be undertaken by the 
prescribing physician.
Priapism and anatomical deformation of the penis
Patients who experience erections lasting 4 hours or more should be instructed to seek immediate medical 
assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency may 
result.
Tadalafil should be used with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as 
angulation, cavernosal fibrosis or Peyronie's disease), or in patients who have conditions which may 
predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anaemia, multiple myeloma or leukaemia).
Use with CYP3A4 inhibitors
Caution should be exercised when prescribing tadalafil to patients using potent CYP3A4 inhibitors 
(ritonavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, and erythromycin) as increased tadalafil exposure (AUC) 
has been observed if the medicinal products are combined (see section 4.5).
Tadalafil and other treatments for erectile dysfunction
The safety and efficacy of combinations of tadalafil and other PDE5 inhibitors or other treatments for 
erectile dysfunction have not been studied. The patients should be informed not to take Tadalafil Mylan in 
such combinations.
Lactose content
Tadalafil Mylan contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total 
lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.
Sodium content
Tadalafil Mylan contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’.
18
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Interaction studies were conducted with 10 mg and/or 20 mg tadalafil, as indicated below. With regard to 
those interaction studies where only the 10 mg tadalafil dose was used, clinically relevant interactions at 
higher doses cannot be completely ruled out.
Effects of other substances on tadalafil
Cytochrome P450 inhibitors
Tadalafil is principally metabolised by CYP3A4. A selective inhibitor of CYP3A4, ketoconazole (200 mg 
daily), increased tadalafil (10 mg) exposure (AUC) 2-fold and Cmax by 15%, relative to the AUC and Cmax 
values for tadalafil alone. Ketoconazole (400 mg daily) increased tadalafil (20 mg) exposure (AUC) 4-fold 
and Cmax by 22%. Ritonavir, a protease inhibitor (200 mg twice daily), which is an inhibitor of CYP3A4, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, increased tadalafil (20 mg) exposure (AUC) 2-fold with no change in 
Cmax. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other protease inhibitors, such as saquinavir, and 
other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, itraconazole and grapefruit juice should be 
co-administered with caution as they would be expected to increase plasma concentrations of tadalafil (see 
section 4.4).
Consequently the incidence of the adverse reactions listed in section 4.8 might be increased.
Transporters
The role of transporters (for example p-glycoprotein) in the disposition of tadalafil is not known.
Therefore there is the potential of drug interactions mediated by inhibition of transporters.
Cytochrome P450 inducers
A CYP3A4 inducer, rifampicin, reduced tadalafil AUC by 88%, relative to the AUC values for tadalafil 
alone (10 mg). This reduced exposure can be anticipated to decrease the efficacy of tadalafil; the magnitude 
of decreased efficacy is unknown. Other inducers of CYP3A4 such as phenobarbital, phenytoin and 
carbamazepine, may also decrease plasma concentrations of tadalafil.
Effects of tadalafil on other medicinal products
Nitrates
In clinical studies, tadalafil (5, 10 and 20 mg) was shown to augment the hypotensive effects of nitrates. 
Therefore, administration of tadalafil to patients who are using any form of organic nitrate is contraindicated 
(see section 4.3). Based on the results of a clinical study in which 150 subjects receiving daily doses of 
tadalafil 20 mg for 7 days and 0.4 mg sublingual nitroglycerin at various times, this interaction lasted for 
more than 24 hours and was no longer detectable when 48 hours had elapsed after the last tadalafil dose. 
Thus, in a patient prescribed any dose of tadalafil (2.5 mg-20 mg), where nitrate administration is deemed 
medically necessary in a life-threatening situation, at least 48 hours should have elapsed after the last dose of 
tadalafil before nitrate administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should only be 
administered under close medical supervision with appropriate haemodynamic monitoring.
Anti-hypertensives (including calcium channel blockers)
The co-administration of doxazosin (4 and 8 mg daily) and tadalafil (5 mg daily dose and 20 mg as a single 
dose) increases the blood pressure-lowering effect of this alpha-blocker in a significant manner. This effect 
lasts at least twelve hours and may be symptomatic, including syncope. Therefore this combination is not 
recommended (see section 4.4).
In interaction studies performed in a limited number of healthy volunteers, these effects were not reported 
with alfuzosin or tamsulosin. However, caution should be exercised when using tadalafil in patients treated 
with any alpha-blockers, and notably in the elderly. Treatments should be initiated at minimal dosage and 
progressively adjusted.
In clinical pharmacology studies, the potential for tadalafil to augment the hypotensive effects of 
antihypertensive medicinal products was examined. Major classes of antihypertensive medicinal products 
were studied, including calcium channel blockers (amlodipine), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 
19
inhibitors (enalapril), beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (metoprolol), thiazide diuretics (bendrofluazide), and 
angiotensin II receptor blockers (various types and doses, alone or in combination with thiazides, calcium 
channel blockers, beta-blockers, and/or alpha-blockers). Tadalafil (10 mg except for studies with angiotensin 
II receptor blockers and amlodipine in which a 20 mg dose was applied) had no clinically significant 
interaction with any of these classes. In another clinical pharmacology study tadalafil (20 mg) was studied in 
combination with up to 4 classes of antihypertensives. In subjects taking multiple antihypertensives, the 
ambulatory-blood-pressure changes appeared to relate to the degree of blood-pressure control. In this regard, 
study subjects whose blood pressure was well controlled, the reduction was minimal and similar to that seen 
in healthy subjects. In study subjects whose blood pressure was not controlled, the reduction was greater 
although this reduction was not associated with hypotensive symptoms in the majority of subjects. In patients 
receiving concomitant antihypertensive medicinal products, tadalafil 20 mg may induce a blood pressure 
decrease, which (with the exception of alpha blockers -see above-) is, in general, minor and not likely to be 
clinically relevant. Analysis of phase 3 clinical trial data showed no difference in adverse events in patients 
taking tadalafil with or without antihypertensive medicinal products. However, appropriate clinical advice 
should be given to patients regarding a possible decrease in blood pressure when they are treated with 
antihypertensive medicinal products.
Riociguat
Preclinical studies showed an additive systemic blood pressure lowering effect when PDE5 inhibitors were 
combined with riociguat. In clinical studies, riociguat has been shown to augment the hypotensive effects of 
PDE5 inhibitors. There was no evidence of favourable clinical effect of the combination in the population 
studied. Concomitant use of riociguat with PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, is contraindicated (see 
section 4.3).  
5-alpha reductase inhibitors
In a clinical trial that compared tadalafil 5 mg coadministered with finasteride 5 mg to placebo plus 
finasteride 5 mg in the relief of BPH symptoms, no new adverse reactions were identified. However, as a 
formal drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effects of tadalafil and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors 
(5-ARIs) has not been performed, caution should be exercised when tadalafil is co-administered with 
5-ARIs.
CYP1A2 substrates (e.g. theophylline)
When tadalafil 10 mg was administered with theophylline (a non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor) in a 
clinical pharmacology study, there was no pharmacokinetic interaction. The only pharmacodynamic effect 
was a small (3.5 bpm) increase in heart rate. Although this effect is minor and was of no clinical significance 
in this study, it should be considered when co-administering these medicinal products.
Ethinylestradiol and terbutaline
Tadalafil has been demonstrated to produce an increase in the oral bioavailability of ethinylestradiol; a 
similar increase may be expected with oral administration of terbutaline, although the clinical consequence 
of this is uncertain.
Alcohol
Alcohol concentrations (mean maximum blood concentration 0.08%) were not affected by co-administration 
with tadalafil (10 mg or 20 mg). In addition, no changes in tadalafil concentrations were seen 3 hours after 
co-administration with alcohol. Alcohol was administered in a manner to maximise the rate of alcohol 
absorption (overnight fast with no food until 2 hours after alcohol).
Tadalafil (20 mg) did not augment the mean blood pressure decrease produced by alcohol (0.7 g/kg or 
approximately 180 ml of 40% alcohol [vodka] in an 80-kg male) but in some subjects, postural dizziness and 
orthostatic hypotension were observed. When tadalafil was administered with lower doses of alcohol 
(0.6 g/kg), hypotension was not observed and dizziness occurred with similar frequency to alcohol alone. 
The effect of alcohol on cognitive function was not augmented by tadalafil (10 mg).
Cytochrome P450 metabolised medicinal products
Tadalafil is not expected to cause clinically significant inhibition or induction of the clearance of medicinal 
products metabolised by CYP450 isoforms. Studies have confirmed that tadalafil does not inhibit or induce 
CYP450 isoforms, including CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19.
20
CYP2C9 substrates (e.g. R-warfarin)
Tadalafil (10 mg and 20 mg) had no clinically significant effect on exposure (AUC) to S-warfarin or 
R-warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), nor did tadalafil affect changes in prothrombin time induced by warfarin.
Aspirin
Tadalafil (10 mg and 20 mg) did not potentiate the increase in bleeding time caused by acetyl salicylic acid.
Antidiabetic medicinal products
Specific interaction studies with antidiabetic medicinal products were not conducted.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Tadalafil Mylan is not indicated for use by women.
Pregnancy
There are limited data from the use of tadalafil in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or 
indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal 
development (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Tadalafil 
Mylan during pregnancy.
Breastfeeding
Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of tadalafil in milk.
A risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. Tadalafil Mylan should not be used during breast feeding.
Fertility
Effects were seen in dogs that might indicate impairment of fertility. Two subsequent clinical studies suggest 
that this effect is unlikely in humans, although a decrease in sperm concentration was seen in some men (see 
sections 5.1 and 5.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Tadalafil has negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Although the frequency of reports 
of dizziness in placebo and tadalafil arms in clinical trials was similar, patients should be aware of how they 
react to tadalafil before driving or using machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients taking tadalafil for the treatment of erectile 
dysfunction or benign prostatic hyperplasia were headache, dyspepsia, back pain and myalgia, in which the 
incidences increase with increasing dose of tadalafil. The adverse reactions reported were transient, and 
generally mild or moderate. The majority of headaches reported with tadalafil once-a-day dosing are 
experienced within the first 10 to 30 days of starting treatment.
Tabulated summary of adverse reactions
The table below lists the adverse reactions observed from spontaneous reporting and in placebo controlled 
clinical trials (comprising a total of 8022 patients on tadalafil and 4422 patients on placebo) for on-demand 
and once-a-day treatment of erectile dysfunction and the once-a-day treatment of benign prostatic 
hyperplasia.

 (1) Most of the patients had pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors (see section 4.4).
(2) Postmarketing surveillance reported adverse reactions not observed in placebo-controlled clinical trials.
(3) More commonly reported when tadalafil is given to patients who are already taking antihypertensive 
medicinal products.
Description of selected adverse reactions
A slightly higher incidence of ECG abnormalities, primarily sinus bradycardia, has been reported in patients 
treated with tadalafil once a day as compared with placebo. Most of these ECG abnormalities were not 
associated with adverse reactions.
Other special populations
Data in patients over 65 years of age receiving tadalafil in clinical trials, either for the treatment of erectile 
dysfunction or the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, are limited. In clinical trials with tadalafil taken 
on demand for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, diarrhoea was reported more frequently in patients over 
65 years of age. In clinical trials with tadalafil 5 mg taken once a day for the treatment of benign prostatic 
hyperplasia, dizziness and diarrhoea were reported more frequently in patients over 75 years of age.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked 
to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.
23
4.9 Overdose
Single doses of up to 500 mg have been given to healthy subjects, and multiple daily doses up to 100 mg 
have been given to patients. Adverse events were similar to those seen at lower doses.
In cases of overdose, standard supportive measures should be adopted as required. Haemodialysis contributes 
negligibly to tadalafil elimination.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Urologicals, Drugs used in erectile dysfunction, ATC Code: G04BE08.
Mechanism of action
Tadalafil is a selective, reversible inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific 
phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). When sexual stimulation causes the local release of nitric oxide, inhibition 
of PDE5 by tadalafil produces increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. This results in smooth 
muscle relaxation and inflow of blood into the penile tissues, thereby producing an erection. Tadalafil has no 
effect in the treatment of erectile dysfunction in the absence of sexual stimulation.
The effect of PDE5 inhibition on cGMP concentration in the corpus cavernosum is also observed in the 
smooth muscle of the prostate, the bladder and their vascular supply. The resulting vascular relaxation 
increases blood perfusion which may be the mechanism by which symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia 
are reduced. These vascular effects may be complemented by inhibition of bladder afferent nerve activity 
and smooth muscle relaxation of the prostate and bladder.
Pharmacodynamic effects
Studies in vitro have shown that tadalafil is a selective inhibitor of PDE5. PDE5 is an enzyme found in 
corpus cavernosum smooth muscle, vascular and visceral smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, platelets, kidney, 
lung, and cerebellum. The effect of tadalafil is more potent on PDE5 than on other phosphodiesterases. 
Tadalafil is > 10,000-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE1, PDE2, and PDE4 enzymes which are found 
in the heart, brain, blood vessels, liver, and other organs. Tadalafil is > 10,000-fold more potent for PDE5 
than for PDE3, an enzyme found in the heart and blood vessels.
This selectivity for PDE5 over PDE3 is important because PDE3 is an enzyme involved in cardiac 
contractility. Additionally, tadalafil is approximately 700-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE6, an 
enzyme which is found in the retina and is responsible for phototransduction. Tadalafil is also > 10,000-fold 
more potent for PDE5 than for PDE7 through PDE10.
Clinical efficacy and safety
Tadalafil administered to healthy subjects produced no significant difference compared to placebo in supine 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mean maximal decrease of 1.6/0.8 mm Hg, respectively), in standing 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mean maximal decrease of 0.2/4.6 mm Hg, respectively), and no 
significant change in heart rate.
In a study to assess the effects of tadalafil on vision, no impairment of colour discrimination (blue/green) 
was detected using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue test. This finding is consistent with the low affinity of 
tadalafil for PDE6 compared to PDE5. Across all clinical studies, reports of changes in colour vision were 
rare (< 0.1%).
Three studies were conducted in men to assess the potential effect on spermatogenesis of tadalafil 10 mg 
(one 6-month study) and 20 mg (one 6-month and one 9-month study) administered daily. In two of these 
studies decreases were observed in sperm count and concentration related to tadalafil treatment of unlikely 
24
clinical relevance. These effects were not associated with changes in other parameters such as motility, 
morphology and FSH.
Erectile dysfunction
For tadalafil on demand, three clinical studies were conducted in 1054 patients in an at-home setting to 
define the period of responsiveness. Tadalafil demonstrated statistically significant improvement in erectile 
function and the ability to have successful sexual intercourse up to 36 hours following dosing, as well as 
patients’ ability to attain and maintain erections for successful intercourse compared to placebo as early as 
16 minutes following dosing.
In a 12-week study performed in 186 patients (142 tadalafil, 44 placebo) with erectile dysfunction secondary 
to spinal cord injury, tadalafil significantly improved the erectile function leading to a mean per-subject 
proportion of successful attempts in patients treated with tadalafil 10 or 20 mg (flexible-dose, on demand) of 
48% as compared to 17% with placebo.
For once-a-day evaluation of tadalafil at doses of 2.5, 5, and 10 mg 3 clinical studies were initially conducted 
involving 853 patients of various ages (range 21-82 years) and ethnicities, with erectile dysfunction of 
various severities (mild, moderate, severe) and etiologies. In the two primary efficacy studies of general 
populations, the mean per-subject proportion of successful intercourse attempts were 57 and 67% on tadalafil 
5 mg, 50% on tadalafil 2.5 mg as compared to 31 and 37% with placebo. In the study in patients with erectile 
dysfunction secondary to diabetes, the mean per-subject proportion of successful attempts were 41 and 46% 
on tadalafil 5 mg and 2.5 mg, respectively, as compared to 28% with placebo. Most patients in these three 
studies were responders to previous on-demand treatment with PDE5 inhibitors. In a subsequent study, 
217 patients who were treatment-naïve to PDE5 inhibitors were randomised to tadalafil 5 mg once a day vs. 
placebo. The mean per-subject proportion of successful sexual intercourse attempts was 68% for tadalafil 
patients compared to 52% for patients on placebo.
Benign prostatic hyperplasia
Tadalafil was studied in 4 clinical studies of 12 weeks duration enrolling over 1500 patients with signs and 
symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. The improvement in the total international prostate symptom 
score with tadalafil 5 mg in the four studies were -4.8, -5.6, -6.1 and -6.3 compared to -2.2, -3.6, -3.8 and 
-4.2 with placebo. The improvements in total international prostate symptom score occurred as early as 
1 week. In one of the studies, which also included tamsulosin 0.4 mg as an active comparator, the 
improvement in total international prostate symptom score with tadalafil 5 mg, tamsulosin and placebo were 
-6.3, -5.7 and -4.2 respectively.
One of these studies assessed improvements in erectile dysfunction and signs and symptoms of benign 
prostatic hyperplasia in patients with both conditions. The improvements in the erectile function domain of 
the international index of erectile function and the total international prostate symptom score in this study 
were 6.5 and -6.1 with tadalafil 5 mg compared to 1.8 and -3.8 with placebo, respectively. The mean per-
subject proportion of successful sexual intercourse attempts was 71.9% with tadalafil 5 mg compared to 
48.3% with placebo.
The maintenance of the effect was evaluated in an open-label extension to one of the studies, which showed 
that the improvement in total international prostate symptom score seen at 12 weeks was maintained for up 
to 1 additional year of treatment with tadalafil 5 mg.
Paediatric population
A single study has been performed in paediatric patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) in 
which no evidence of efficacy was seen. The randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, 3-arm 
study of tadalafil was conducted in 331 boys aged 7-14 years with DMD receiving concurrent corticosteroid 
therapy. The study included a 48-week double-blind period where patients were randomised to tadalafil 
0.3 mg/kg, tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg, or placebo daily. Tadalafil did not show efficacy in slowing the decline in 
ambulation as measured by the primary 6 minute walk distance (6MWD) endpoint: least squares (LS) mean 
change in 6MWD at 48 weeks was -51.0 meters (m) in the placebo group, compared with -64.7 m in the 
tadalafil 0.3 mg/kg group (p = 0.307) and -59.1 m in the tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg group (p = 0.538). In addition, 
25
there was no evidence of efficacy from any of the secondary analyses performed in this study. The overall 
safety results from this study were generally consistent with the known safety profile of tadalafil and with 
adverse events (AEs) expected in a paediatric DMD population receiving corticosteroids.
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies in all subsets of 
the paediatric population in the treatment of the erectile dysfunction. See section 4.2 for information on 
paediatric use.
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption
Tadalafil is readily absorbed after oral administration and the mean maximum observed plasma 
concentration (Cmax) is achieved at a median time of 2 hours after dosing. Absolute bioavailability of tadalafil 
following oral dosing has not been determined.
The rate and extent of absorption of tadalafil are not influenced by food, thus Tadalafil may be taken with or 
without food. The time of dosing (morning versus evening) had no clinically relevant effects on the rate and 
extent of absorption.
Distribution
The mean volume of distribution is approximately 63 l, indicating that tadalafil is distributed into tissues. At 
therapeutic concentrations, 94% of tadalafil in plasma is bound to proteins. Protein binding is not affected by 
impaired renal function.
Less than 0.0005% of the administered dose appeared in the semen of healthy subjects.
Biotransformation
Tadalafil is predominantly metabolised by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 isoform. The major circulating 
metabolite is the methylcatechol glucuronide. This metabolite is at least 13,000-fold less potent than tadalafil 
for PDE5. Consequently, it is not expected to be clinically active at observed metabolite concentrations.
Elimination
The mean oral clearance for tadalafil is 2.5 l/h and the mean half-life is 17.5 hours in healthy subjects. 
Tadalafil is excreted predominantly as inactive metabolites, mainly in the faeces (approximately 61% of the 
dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 36% of the dose).
Linearity/non-linearity
Tadalafil pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects are linear with respect to time and dose. Over a dose range of 
2.5 to 20 mg, exposure (AUC) increases proportionally with dose. Steady-state plasma concentrations are 
attained within 5 days of once-daily dosing.
Pharmacokinetics determined with a population approach in patients with erectile dysfunction are similar to 
pharmacokinetics in subjects without erectile dysfunction.
Special populations
Elderly
Healthy elderly subjects (65 years or over), had a lower oral clearance of tadalafil, resulting in 25% higher 
exposure (AUC) relative to healthy subjects aged 19 to 45 years. This effect of age is not clinically 
significant and does not warrant a dose adjustment.
Renal insufficiency
In clinical pharmacology studies using single-dose tadalafil (5 to 20 mg), tadalafil exposure (AUC) 
approximately doubled in subjects with mild (creatinine clearance 51 to 80 ml/min) or moderate (creatinine 
26
clearance 31 to 50 ml/min) renal impairment and in subjects with end-stage renal disease on dialysis. In 
haemodialysis patients, Cmax was 41% higher than that observed in healthy subjects.
Haemodialysis contributes negligibly to tadalafil elimination.
Hepatic insufficiency
Tadalafil exposure (AUC) in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and 
B) is comparable to exposure in healthy subjects when a dose of 10 mg is administered. There is limited 
clinical data on the safety of tadalafil in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency (Child-Pugh Class C). 
There are no available data about the administration of once-a-day dosing of tadalafil to patients with hepatic 
impairment. If tadalafil is prescribed once-a-day, a careful individual benefit/risk evaluation should be 
undertaken by the prescribing physician.
Patients with diabetes
Tadalafil exposure (AUC) in patients with diabetes was approximately 19% lower than the AUC value for 
healthy subjects. This difference in exposure does not warrant a dose adjustment.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, 
repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to reproduction.
There was no evidence of teratogenicity, embryotoxicity or foetotoxicity in rats or mice that received up to 
1000 mg/kg/day tadalafil. In a rat prenatal and postnatal development study, the no observed effect dose was 
30 mg/kg/day. In the pregnant rat the AUC for calculated free drug at this dose was approximately 18 times 
the human AUC at a 20 mg dose.
There was no impairment of fertility in male and female rats. In dogs given tadalafil daily for 6 to 12 months 
at doses of 25 mg/kg/day (resulting in at least a 3-fold greater exposure [range 3.7 – 18.6] than seen in 
humans given a single 20 mg dose) and above, there was regression of the seminiferous tubular epithelium 
that resulted in a decrease in spermatogenesis in some dogs. See also section 5.1.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of erectile dysfunction in adult males.
In order for tadalafil to be effective, sexual stimulation is required.
Tadalafil Mylan is not indicated for use by women.
30
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Posology
Adult men
In general, the recommended dose is 10 mg taken prior to anticipated sexual activity and with or without 
food.
In those patients in whom tadalafil 10 mg does not produce an adequate effect, 20 mg might be tried.
It may be taken at least 30 minutes prior to sexual activity.
The maximum dose frequency is once per day.
Tadalafil 10 and 20 mg is intended for use prior to anticipated sexual activity and it is not recommended for 
continuous daily use.
In patients who anticipate a frequent use of tadalafil (i.e., at least twice weekly) a once daily regimen with 
the lowest doses of tadalafil might be considered suitable, based on patient choice and the physician’s 
judgement.
In these patients the recommended dose is 5 mg taken once a day at approximately the same time of day. The 
dose may be decreased to 2.5 mg once a day based on individual tolerability.
The appropriateness of continued use of the daily regimen should be reassessed periodically.
Special populations
Elderly men
Dose adjustments are not required in elderly patients.
Men with renal impairment
Dose adjustments are not required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. For patients with 
severe renal impairment 10 mg is the maximum recommended dose. Once-a-day dosing of tadalafil is not 
recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).
Men with hepatic impairment
The recommended dose of tadalafil is 10 mg taken prior to anticipated sexual activity and with or without 
food. There is limited clinical data on the safety of tadalafil in patients with severe hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh Class C); if prescribed, a careful individual benefit/risk evaluation should be undertaken by the 
prescribing physician. There are no available data about the administration of doses higher than 10 mg of 
tadalafil to patients with hepatic impairment. Once-a-day dosing has not been evaluated in patients with 
hepatic impairment; therefore, if prescribed, a careful individual benefit/risk evaluation should be undertaken 
by the prescribing physician (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).
Men with diabetes
Dose adjustments are not required in diabetic patients.
Paediatric population
There is no relevant use of tadalafil in the paediatric population with regard to the treatment of erectile 
dysfunction.
Method of administration
Tadalafil Mylan 10 mg and 20 mg film-coated tablets cannot be divided and should be swallowed whole. 
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
31
In clinical studies, tadalafil was shown to augment the hypotensive effects of nitrates. This is thought to 
result from the combined effects of nitrates and tadalafil on the nitric oxide/cGMP pathway.
Therefore, administration of tadalafil to patients who are using any form of organic nitrate is contraindicated 
(see section 4.5).
Tadalafil must not be used in men with cardiac disease for whom sexual activity is inadvisable.
Physicians should consider the potential cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with pre-existing 
cardiovascular disease.
The following groups of patients with cardiovascular disease were not included in clinical trials and the use 
of tadalafil is therefore contraindicated:
-
-
-
-
-
patients with myocardial infarction within the last 90 days,
patients with unstable angina or angina occurring during sexual intercourse,
patients with New York Heart Association Class 2 or greater heart failure in the last 6 months,
patients with uncontrolled arrhythmias, hypotension (< 90/50 mm Hg), or uncontrolled hypertension,
patients with a stroke within the last 6 months.
Tadalafil is contraindicated in patients who have loss of vision in one eye because of non-arteritic anterior 
ischaemic optic neuropathy (NAION), regardless of whether this episode was in connection or not with 
previous PDE5 inhibitor exposure (see section 4.4).
The co-administration of PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, with guanylate cyclase stimulators, such as 
riociguat, is contraindicated as it may potentially lead to symptomatic hypotension (see section 4.5).
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Before treatment with Tadalafil Mylan
A medical history and physical examination should be undertaken to diagnose erectile dysfunction and 
determine potential underlying causes, before pharmacological treatment is considered.
Prior to initiating any treatment for erectile dysfunction, physicians should consider the cardiovascular status 
of their patients, since there is a degree of cardiac risk associated with sexual activity. Tadalafil has 
vasodilator properties, resulting in mild and transient decreases in blood pressure (see section 5.1) and as 
such potentiates the hypotensive effect of nitrates (see section 4.3).
The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the 
identification of appropriate treatment following an appropriate medical assessment. It is not known if 
tadalafil is effective in patients who have undergone pelvic surgery or radical non-nerve sparing 
prostatectomy.
Cardiovascular
Serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, unstable angina 
pectoris, ventricular arrhythmia, stroke, transient ischemic attacks, chest pain, palpitations and tachycardia, 
have been reported either post marketing and/or in clinical trials. Most of the patients in whom these events 
have been reported had pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors. However, it is not possible to definitively 
determine whether these events are related directly to these risk factors, to tadalafil, to sexual activity, or to a 
combination of these or other factors.
In patients who are taking alpha1 blockers, concomitant administration of tadalafil may lead to symptomatic 
hypotension in some patients (see section 4.5). The combination of tadalafil and doxazosin is not 
recommended.
Vision
32
Visual defects and cases of NAION have been reported in connection with the intake of tadalafil and other 
PDE5 inhibitors. Analyses of observational data suggest an increased risk of acute NAION in men with 
erectile dysfunction following exposure to tadalafil or other PDE5 inhibitors. As this may be relevant for all 
patients exposed to tadalafil, the patient should be advised that in case of sudden visual defect, he should 
stop taking Tadalafil Mylan and consult a physician immediately (see section 4.3).
Decreased or sudden hearing loss
Cases of sudden hearing loss have been reported after the use of tadalafil. Although other risk factors were 
present in some cases (such as age, diabetes, hypertension and previous hearing loss history) patients should 
be advised to stop taking tadalafil and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss 
of hearing.
Hepatic impairment
There is limited clinical data on the safety of single-dose administration of tadalafil in patients with severe 
hepatic insufficiency (Child-Pugh Class C). If Tadalafil Mylan is prescribed, a careful individual benefit/risk 
evaluation should be undertaken by the prescribing physician.
Priapism and anatomical deformation of the penis
Patients who experience erections lasting 4 hours or more should be instructed to seek immediate medical 
assistance. If priapism is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency may 
result.
Tadalafil should be used with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as 
angulation, cavernosal fibrosis or Peyronie's disease), or in patients who have conditions which may 
predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anaemia, multiple myeloma or leukaemia).
Use with CYP3A4 inhibitors
Caution should be exercised when prescribing tadalafil to patients using potent CYP3A4 inhibitors 
(ritonavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, and erythromycin) as increased tadalafil exposure (AUC) 
has been observed if the medicinal products are combined (see section 4.5).
Tadalafil and other treatments for erectile dysfunction
The safety and efficacy of combinations of tadalafil and other PDE5 inhibitors or other treatments for 
erectile dysfunction have not been studied. The patients should be informed not to take Tadalafil Mylan in 
such combinations.
Lactose content
Tadalafil Mylan contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total 
lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.
Sodium content
Tadalafil Mylan contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Interaction studies were conducted with 10 mg and/or 20 mg tadalafil, as indicated below. With regard to 
those interaction studies where only the 10 mg tadalafil dose was used, clinically relevant interactions at 
higher doses cannot be completely ruled out.
33
Effects of other substances on tadalafil
Cytochrome P450 inhibitors
Tadalafil is principally metabolised by CYP3A4. A selective inhibitor of CYP3A4, ketoconazole (200 mg 
daily), increased tadalafil (10 mg) exposure (AUC) 2-fold and Cmax by 15%, relative to the AUC and Cmax 
values for tadalafil alone. Ketoconazole (400 mg daily) increased tadalafil (20 mg) exposure (AUC) 4-fold 
and Cmax by 22%. Ritonavir, a protease inhibitor (200 mg twice daily), which is an inhibitor of CYP3A4, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, increased tadalafil (20 mg) exposure (AUC) 2-fold with no change in 
Cmax. Although specific interactions have not been studied, other protease inhibitors, such as saquinavir, and 
other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, itraconazole and grapefruit juice should be 
co-administered with caution as they would be expected to increase plasma concentrations of tadalafil (see 
section 4.4).
Consequently the incidence of the adverse reactions listed in section 4.8 might be increased.
Transporters
The role of transporters (for example p-glycoprotein) in the disposition of tadalafil is not known.
Therefore there is the potential of drug interactions mediated by inhibition of transporters.
Cytochrome P450 inducers
A CYP3A4 inducer, rifampicin, reduced tadalafil AUC by 88%, relative to the AUC values for tadalafil 
alone (10 mg). This reduced exposure can be anticipated to decrease the efficacy of tadalafil; the magnitude 
of decreased efficacy is unknown. Other inducers of CYP3A4 such as phenobarbital, phenytoin and 
carbamazepine, may also decrease plasma concentrations of tadalafil.
Effects of tadalafil on other medicinal products
Nitrates
In clinical studies, tadalafil (5, 10 and 20 mg) was shown to augment the hypotensive effects of nitrates. 
Therefore, administration of tadalafil to patients who are using any form of organic nitrate is contraindicated 
(see section 4.3). Based on the results of a clinical study in which 150 subjects receiving daily doses of 
tadalafil 20 mg for 7 days and 0.4 mg sublingual nitroglycerin at various times, this interaction lasted for 
more than 24 hours and was no longer detectable when 48 hours had elapsed after the last tadalafil dose. 
Thus, in a patient prescribed any dose of tadalafil (2.5 mg-20 mg), where nitrate administration is deemed 
medically necessary in a life-threatening situation, at least 48 hours should have elapsed after the last dose of 
tadalafil before nitrate administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should only be 
administered under close medical supervision with appropriate haemodynamic monitoring.
Anti-hypertensives (including calcium channel blockers)
The co-administration of doxazosin (4 and 8 mg daily) and tadalafil (5 mg daily dose and 20 mg as a single 
dose) increases the blood pressure-lowering effect of this alpha-blocker in a significant manner. This effect 
lasts at least twelve hours and may be symptomatic, including syncope. Therefore this combination is not 
recommended (see section 4.4).
In interaction studies performed in a limited number of healthy volunteers, these effects were not reported 
with alfuzosin or tamsulosin. However, caution should be exercised when using tadalafil in patients treated 
with any alpha-blockers, and notably in the elderly. Treatments should be initiated at minimal dosage and 
progressively adjusted.
In clinical pharmacology studies, the potential for tadalafil to augment the hypotensive effects of 
antihypertensive medicinal products was examined. Major classes of antihypertensive medicinal products 
were studied, including calcium channel blockers (amlodipine), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitors (enalapril), beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (metoprolol), thiazide diuretics 
(bendroflumethiazide), and angiotensin II receptor blockers (various types and doses, alone or in 
combination with thiazides, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, and/or alpha-blockers). Tadalafil 
(10 mg except for studies with angiotensin II receptor blockers and amlodipine in which a 20 mg dose was 
applied) had no clinically significant interaction with any of these classes. In another clinical pharmacology 
study tadalafil (20 mg) was studied in combination with up to 4 classes of antihypertensives. In subjects 
taking multiple antihypertensives, the ambulatory-blood-pressure changes appeared to relate to the degree of 
34
blood-pressure control. In this regard, study subjects whose blood pressure was well controlled, the reduction 
was minimal and similar to that seen in healthy subjects. In study subjects whose blood pressure was not 
controlled, the reduction was greater although this reduction was not associated with hypotensive symptoms 
in the majority of subjects. In patients receiving concomitant antihypertensive medicinal products, tadalafil 
20 mg may induce a blood pressure decrease, which (with the exception of alpha blockers -see above-) is, in 
general, minor and not likely to be clinically relevant. Analysis of phase 3 clinical trial data showed no 
difference in adverse events in patients taking tadalafil with or without antihypertensive medicinal products. 
However, appropriate clinical advice should be given to patients regarding a possible decrease in blood 
pressure when they are treated with antihypertensive medicinal products.
Riociguat
Preclinical studies showed an additive systemic blood pressure lowering effect when PDE5 inhibitors were 
combined with riociguat. In clinical studies, riociguat has been shown to augment the hypotensive effects of 
PDE5 inhibitors. There was no evidence of favourable clinical effect of the combination in the population 
studied. Concomitant use of riociguat with PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, is contraindicated (see 
section 4.3).  
5- alpha reductase inhibitors
In a clinical trial that compared tadalafil 5 mg coadministered with finasteride 5 mg to placebo plus 
finasteride 5 mg in the relief of BPH symptoms, no new adverse reactions were identified. However, as a 
formal drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effects of tadalafil and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors 
(5-ARIs) has not been performed, caution should be exercised when tadalafil is co-administered with 
5-ARIs.
CYP1A2 substrates (e.g. theophylline)
When tadalafil 10 mg was administered with theophylline (a non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor) in a 
clinical pharmacology study, there was no pharmacokinetic interaction. The only pharmacodynamic effect 
was a small (3.5 bpm) increase in heart rate. Although this effect is minor and was of no clinical significance 
in this study, it should be considered when co-administering these medicinal products.
Ethinylestradiol and terbutaline
Tadalafil has been demonstrated to produce an increase in the oral bioavailability of ethinylestradiol; a 
similar increase may be expected with oral administration of terbutaline, although the clinical consequence 
of this is uncertain.
Alcohol
Alcohol concentrations (mean maximum blood concentration 0.08%) were not affected by co-administration 
with tadalafil (10 mg or 20 mg). In addition, no changes in tadalafil concentrations were seen 3 hours after 
co-administration with alcohol. Alcohol was administered in a manner to maximise the rate of alcohol 
absorption (overnight fast with no food until 2 hours after alcohol).
Tadalafil (20 mg) did not augment the mean blood pressure decrease produced by alcohol (0.7 g/kg or 
approximately 180 ml of 40% alcohol [vodka] in an 80-kg male) but in some subjects, postural dizziness and 
orthostatic hypotension were observed. When tadalafil was administered with lower doses of alcohol 
(0.6 g/kg), hypotension was not observed and dizziness occurred with similar frequency to alcohol alone. 
The effect of alcohol on cognitive function was not augmented by tadalafil (10 mg).
Cytochrome P450 metabolised medicinal products
Tadalafil is not expected to cause clinically significant inhibition or induction of the clearance of medicinal 
products metabolised by CYP450 isoforms. Studies have confirmed that tadalafil does not inhibit or induce 
CYP450 isoforms, including CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19.
CYP2C9 substrates (e.g. R-warfarin)
Tadalafil (10 mg and 20 mg) had no clinically significant effect on exposure (AUC) to S-warfarin or 
R-warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), nor did tadalafil affect changes in prothrombin time induced by warfarin.
Aspirin
Tadalafil (10 mg and 20 mg) did not potentiate the increase in bleeding time caused by acetyl salicylic acid.
35
Antidiabetic medicinal products
Specific interaction studies with antidiabetic medicinal products were not conducted.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Tadalafil Mylan is not indicated for use by women.
Pregnancy
There are limited data from the use of tadalafil in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or 
indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal 
development (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Tadalafil 
Mylan during pregnancy.
Breastfeeding
Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of tadalafil in milk.
A risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. Tadalafil Mylan should not be used during breast feeding.
Fertility
Effects were seen in dogs that might indicate impairment of fertility. Two subsequent clinical studies suggest 
that this effect is unlikely in humans, although a decrease in sperm concentration was seen in some men (see 
sections 5.1 and 5.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Tadalafil has negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Although the frequency of reports 
of dizziness in placebo and tadalafil arms in clinical trials was similar, patients should be aware of how they 
react to tadalafil before driving or using machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients taking tadalafil for the treatment of erectile 
dysfunction or benign prostatic hyperplasia were headache, dyspepsia, back pain and myalgia, in which the 
incidences increase with increasing dose of tadalafil. The adverse reactions reported were transient, and 
generally mild or moderate. The majority of headaches reported with tadalafil once-a-day dosing are 
experienced within the first 10 to 30 days of starting treatment.
Tabulated summary of adverse reactions
The table below lists the adverse reactions observed from spontaneous reporting and in placebo controlled 
clinical trials (comprising a total of 8022 patients on tadalafil and 4422 patients on placebo) for on-demand 
and once-a-day treatment of erectile dysfunction and the once-a-day treatment of benign prostatic 
hyperplasia.

 (1) Most of the patients had pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors (see section 4.4).
(2) Postmarketing surveillance reported adverse reactions not observed in placebo-controlled clinical trials.
(3) More commonly reported when tadalafil is given to patients who are already taking antihypertensive 
medicinal products.
Description of selected adverse reactions
A slightly higher incidence of ECG abnormalities, primarily sinus bradycardia, has been reported in patients 
treated with tadalafil once a day as compared with placebo. Most of these ECG abnormalities were not 
associated with adverse reactions.
Other special populations
Data in patients over 65 years of age receiving tadalafil in clinical trials, either for the treatment of erectile 
dysfunction or the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, are limited. In clinical trials with tadalafil taken 
on demand for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, diarrhoea was reported more frequently in patients over 
65 years of age. In clinical trials with tadalafil 5 mg taken once a day for the treatment of benign prostatic 
hyperplasia, dizziness and diarrhoea were reported more frequently in patients over 75 years of age.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked 
to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.
38
4.9 Overdose
Single doses of up to 500 mg have been given to healthy subjects, and multiple daily doses up to 100 mg 
have been given to patients. Adverse events were similar to those seen at lower doses.
In cases of overdose, standard supportive measures should be adopted as required. Haemodialysis contributes 
negligibly to tadalafil elimination.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Urologicals, Drugs used in erectile dysfunction, ATC Code: G04BE08.
Mechanism of action
Tadalafil is a selective, reversible inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific 
phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). When sexual stimulation causes the local release of nitric oxide, inhibition 
of PDE5 by tadalafil produces increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. This results in smooth 
muscle relaxation and inflow of blood into the penile tissues, thereby producing an erection. Tadalafil has no 
effect in the absence of sexual stimulation.
Pharmacodynamic effects
Studies in vitro have shown that tadalafil is a selective inhibitor of PDE5. PDE5 is an enzyme found in 
corpus cavernosum smooth muscle, vascular and visceral smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, platelets, kidney, 
lung, and cerebellum. The effect of tadalafil is more potent on PDE5 than on other phosphodiesterases. 
Tadalafil is > 10,000-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE1, PDE2, and PDE4 enzymes which are found 
in the heart, brain, blood vessels, liver, and other organs. Tadalafil is > 10,000-fold more potent for PDE5 
than for PDE3, an enzyme found in the heart and blood vessels. 
This selectivity for PDE5 over PDE3 is important because PDE3 is an enzyme involved in cardiac 
contractility. Additionally, tadalafil is approximately 700-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE6, an 
enzyme which is found in the retina and is responsible for phototransduction. Tadalafil is also > 10,000-fold 
more potent for PDE5 than for PDE7 through PDE10.
Clinical efficacy and safety
Three clinical studies were conducted in 1054 patients in an at-home setting to define the period of 
responsiveness to tadalafil. Tadalafil demonstrated statistically significant improvement in erectile function 
and the ability to have successful sexual intercourse up to 36 hours following dosing, as well as patients’ 
ability to attain and maintain erections for successful intercourse compared to placebo as early as 16 minutes 
following dosing.
Tadalafil administered to healthy subjects produced no significant difference compared to placebo in supine 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mean maximal decrease of 1.6/0.8 mm Hg, respectively), in standing 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mean maximal decrease of 0.2/4.6 mm Hg, respectively), and no 
significant change in heart rate.
In a study to assess the effects of tadalafil on vision, no impairment of colour discrimination (blue/green) 
was detected using the Farnsworth Munsell 100 hue test. This finding is consistent with the low affinity of 
tadalafil for PDE6 compared to PDE5. Across all clinical studies, reports of changes in colour vision were 
rare (< 0.1%).
Three studies were conducted in men to assess the potential effect on spermatogenesis of tadalafil 10 mg 
(one 6-month study) and 20 mg (one 6-month and one 9-month study) administered daily. In two of these 
studies decreases were observed in sperm count and concentration related to tadalafil treatment of unlikely 
39
clinical relevance. These effects were not associated with changes in other parameters such as motility, 
morphology and FSH.
Tadalafil at doses of 2 to 100 mg has been evaluated in 16 clinical studies involving 3250 patients, including 
patients with erectile dysfunction of various severities (mild, moderate, severe), etiologies, ages (range 21-86 
years), and ethnicities. Most patients reported erectile dysfunction of at least 1 year in duration. In the 
primary efficacy studies of general populations, 81% of patients reported that tadalafil improved their 
erections as compared to 35% with placebo. Also, patients with erectile dysfunction in all severity categories 
reported improved erections whilst taking tadalafil (86%, 83% and 72% for mild, moderate, and severe, 
respectively, as compared to 45%, 42% and 19% with placebo). In the primary efficacy studies, 75% of 
intercourse attempts were successful in tadalafil treated patients as compared to 32% with placebo.
In a 12-week study performed in 186 patients (142 tadalafil, 44 placebo) with erectile dysfunction secondary 
to spinal cord injury, tadalafil significantly improved the erectile function leading to a mean per-subject 
proportion of successful attempts in patients treated with tadalafil 10 or 20 mg (flexible-dose, on demand) of 
48% as compared to 17% with placebo.
Paediatric population
A single study has been performed in paediatric patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) in 
which no evidence of efficacy was seen. The randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, 3-arm 
study of tadalafil was conducted in 331 boys aged 7-14 years with DMD receiving concurrent corticosteroid 
therapy. The study included a 48-week double-blind period where patients were randomised to tadalafil 
0.3 mg/kg, tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg, or placebo daily. Tadalafil did not show efficacy in slowing the decline in 
ambulation as measured by the primary 6 minute walk distance (6MWD) endpoint: least squares (LS) mean 
change in 6MWD at 48 weeks was -51.0 meters (m) in the placebo group, compared with -64.7 m in the 
tadalafil 0.3 mg/kg group (p = 0.307) and -59.1 m in the tadalafil 0.6 mg/kg group (p = 0.538). In addition, 
there was no evidence of efficacy from any of the secondary analyses performed in this study. The overall 
safety results from this study were generally consistent with the known safety profile of tadalafil and with 
adverse events (AEs) expected in a paediatric DMD population receiving corticosteroids.
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies in all subsets of 
the paediatric population in the treatment of the erectile dysfunction. See section 4.2 for information on 
paediatric use.
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption
Tadalafil is readily absorbed after oral administration and the mean maximum observed plasma 
concentration (Cmax) is achieved at a median time of 2 hours after dosing. Absolute bioavailability of tadalafil 
following oral dosing has not been determined.
The rate and extent of absorption of tadalafil are not influenced by food, thus tadalafil may be taken with or 
without food. The time of dosing (morning versus evening) had no clinically relevant effects on the rate and 
extent of absorption.
Distribution
The mean volume of distribution is approximately 63 l, indicating that tadalafil is distributed into tissues. At 
therapeutic concentrations, 94% of tadalafil in plasma is bound to proteins. Protein binding is not affected by 
impaired renal function.
Less than 0.0005% of the administered dose appeared in the semen of healthy subjects.
Biotransformation
40
Tadalafil is predominantly metabolised by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 isoform. The major circulating 
metabolite is the methylcatechol glucuronide. This metabolite is at least 13,000-fold less potent than tadalafil 
for PDE5. Consequently, it is not expected to be clinically active at observed metabolite concentrations.
Elimination
The mean oral clearance for tadalafil is 2.5 l/h and the mean half-life is 17.5 hours in healthy subjects. 
Tadalafil is excreted predominantly as inactive metabolites, mainly in the faeces (approximately 61% of the 
dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 36% of the dose).
Linearity/non-linearity
Tadalafil pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects is linear with respect to time and dose. Over a dose range of 
2.5 to 20 mg, exposure (AUC) increases proportionally with dose. Steady-state plasma concentrations are 
attained within 5 days of once-daily dosing.
Pharmacokinetics determined with a population approach in patients with erectile dysfunction is similar to 
pharmacokinetics in subjects without erectile dysfunction.
Special populations
Elderly
Healthy elderly subjects (65 years or over), had a lower oral clearance of tadalafil, resulting in 25% higher 
exposure (AUC) relative to healthy subjects aged 19 to 45 years. This effect of age is not clinically 
significant and does not warrant a dose adjustment.
Renal insufficiency
In clinical pharmacology studies using single-dose tadalafil (5 to 20 mg), tadalafil exposure (AUC) 
approximately doubled in subjects with mild (creatinine clearance 51 to 80 ml/min) or moderate (creatinine 
clearance 31 to 50 ml/min) renal impairment and in subjects with end-stage renal disease on dialysis. In 
haemodialysis patients, Cmax was 41% higher than that observed in healthy subjects.
Haemodialysis contributes negligibly to tadalafil elimination.
Hepatic insufficiency
Tadalafil exposure (AUC) in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and 
B) is comparable to exposure in healthy subjects when a dose of 10 mg is administered. There is limited 
clinical data on the safety of tadalafil in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency (Child-Pugh Class C). If 
tadalafil is prescribed, a careful individual benefit/risk evaluation should be undertaken by the prescribing 
physician. There are no available data about the administration of doses higher than 10 mg of tadalafil to 
patients with hepatic impairment. 
Patients with diabetes
Tadalafil exposure (AUC) in patients with diabetes was approximately 19% lower than the AUC value for 
healthy subjects. This difference in exposure does not warrant a dose adjustment.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, 
repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to reproduction.
There was no evidence of teratogenicity, embryotoxicity or foetotoxicity in rats or mice that received up to 
1000 mg/kg/day tadalafil. In a rat prenatal and postnatal development study, the no observed effect dose was 
30 mg/kg/day. In the pregnant rat the AUC for calculated free drug at this dose was approximately 18 times 
the human AUC at a 20 mg dose.
There was no impairment of fertility in male and female rats. In dogs given tadalafil daily for 6 to 12 months 
at doses of 25 mg/kg/day (resulting in at least a 3-fold greater exposure [range 3.7-–-18.6] than seen in 
humans given a single 20 mg dose) and above, there was regression of the seminiferous tubular epithelium 
that resulted in a decrease in spermatogenesis in some dogs. See also section 5.1.

Possible side effects 
1. What Tadalafil Mylan is and what it is used for
Tadalafil Mylan is a treatment for adult men with erectile dysfunction. This is when a man cannot get, or 
keep a hard, erect penis suitable for sexual activity. Tadalafil has been shown to significantly improve the 
ability of obtaining a hard erect penis suitable for sexual activity.
Tadalafil Mylan contains the active substance tadalafil which belongs to a group of medicines called 
phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors. Following sexual stimulation Tadalafil Mylan works by helping the 
blood vessels in your penis to relax, allowing the flow of blood into your penis. The result of this is 
improved erectile function. Tadalafil Mylan will not help you if you do not have erectile dysfunction.
It is important to note that tadalafil does not work if there is no sexual stimulation. You and your partner will 
need to engage in foreplay, just as you would if you were not taking a medicine for erectile dysfunction.
2. What you need to know before you take Tadalafil Mylan

Possible side effects
1. What Tadalafil Mylan is and what it is used for
Tadalafil Mylan contains the active substance tadalafil which belongs to a group of medicines called 
phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors.
Tadalafil Mylan is used to treat adult men with:
-
erectile dysfunction. This is when a man cannot get, or keep a hard, erect penis suitable for sexual 
activity. Tadalafil has been shown to significantly improve the ability of obtaining a hard erect penis 
suitable for sexual activity. Following sexual stimulation Tadalafil Mylan works by helping the blood 
vessels in your penis to relax, allowing the flow of blood into your penis. The result of this is 
improved erectile function. Tadalafil Mylan will not help you if you do not have erectile dysfunction. 
It is important to note that Tadalafil Mylan for the treatment of erectile dysfunction does not work if 
there is no sexual stimulation. You and your partner will need to engage in foreplay, just as you would 
if you were not taking a medicine for erectile dysfunction.
-
urinary symptoms associated with a common condition called benign prostatic hyperplasia. This is 
when the prostate gland gets bigger with the age. Symptoms include difficulty in starting to pass 
water, a feeling of not completely emptying the bladder and a more frequent need to pass water even at 
night. Tadalafil improves blood flow to, and relaxes the muscles of, the prostate and bladder which 
may reduce symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Tadalafil has been shown to improve these 
urinary symptoms as early as 1-2 weeks after starting treatment.
2. What you need to know before you take Tadalafil Mylan
Do not take Tadalafil Mylan
-

of medicines (“nitrates”) used in the treatment of angina pectoris (“chest pain”). Tadalafil has been 
shown to increase the effects of these medicines. If you are taking any form of nitrate or are unsure tell

Possible side effects 
1. What Tadalafil Mylan is and what it is used for
Tadalafil Mylan is a treatment for adult men with erectile dysfunction. This is when a man cannot get, or 
keep a hard, erect penis suitable for sexual activity. Tadalafil has been shown to significantly improve the 
ability of obtaining a hard erect penis suitable for sexual activity.
Tadalafil Mylan contains the active substance tadalafil which belongs to a group of medicines called 
phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors. Following sexual stimulation Tadalafil Mylan works by helping the 
blood vessels in your penis to relax, allowing the flow of blood into your penis. The result of this is 
improved erectile function. Tadalafil Mylan will not help you if you do not have erectile dysfunction.
It is important to note that tadalafil does not work if there is no sexual stimulation. You and your partner will 
need to engage in foreplay, just as you would if you were not taking a medicine for erectile dysfunction.
2. What you need to know before you take Tadalafil Mylan
Do not take Tadalafil Mylan
-
-
if you are allergic to tadalafil or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).
if you are taking any form of organic nitrate or nitric oxide donors such as amyl nitrite. This is a group 
of medicines (“nitrates”) used in the treatment of angina pectoris (“chest pain”). Tadalafil has been

pressure in the lungs) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (i.e., high blood pressure 
in the lungs secondary to blood clots). PDE5 inhibitors, such as Tadalafil Mylan, have been shown to

increase the hypotensive effects of this medicine. If you are taking riociguat or are unsure tell your 
doctor.

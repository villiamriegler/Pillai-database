2.  Introduction 
On  the  29th  of  October  2020,  the  MAH  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  study  for  Omnitrope,  in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
EP00-501  (PATRO  children)  PMS  study  was  an  international,  non-interventional,  noncontrolled, 
longitudinal,  open  and  multicenter  study,  designed  to  record  the  safety  and  effectiveness  data  of 
paediatric patients treated with Omnitrope in various indications within routine clinical practice. 
This non-interventional PMS study was designed as an additional Pharmacovigilance activity in the RMP 
committed to EMA following the marketing authorisation approval of Omnitrope in Europe on 12-Apr-
2006.  Sandoz  requested  in  2019  to  close  the  study  (EMEA/H/C/000607/MEA  012.4),  and  the  CHMP 
adopted the request on 27-Feb-2020. Database lock for the final analysis was on 23-Jul-2020. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
3.  Scientific discussion 
3.1.  Information on the development program 
The final CSR of study EP00-501 is submitted as a standalone PAM. 
3.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Omnitrope is available in the following suitable paediatric formulations: 
  Omnitrope  5  mg/1.5  ml  (corresponds  to  3.33  mg/ml)  solution  for  injection:  a  ready-to-use 
solution  to  be  injected  subcutaneously  using  a  pen  injector.  One  cartridge  contains  1.5  ml 
corresponding  to  5  mg  Somatropin  (15  IU)  produced  in  Escherichia  coli  by  recombinant  DNA 
technology. One ml contains 9 mg benzyl alcohol. 
  Omnitrope  10  mg/1.5  ml  (corresponds  to  6.7  mg/ml)  solution  for  injection:  a  ready-to-use 
solution  to  be  injected  subcutaneously  using  a  pen  injector.  One  cartridge  contains  1.5  ml 
corresponding to 10 mg Somatropin (30 IU) produced in Escherichia coli by recombinant DNA 
technology. 
  Omnitrope  15  mg/1.5  ml  (corresponds  to  10  mg/ml)  solution  for  injection:  a  ready-to-use 
solution  to  be  injected  subcutaneously  using  a  pen  injector.  One  cartridge  contains  1.5  ml 
corresponding to 15 mg Somatropin (45 IU) produced in Escherichia coli by recombinant DNA 
technology. 
3.3.  Clinical aspects 
3.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
Study EP00-501: PATRO Children.  
Omnitrope, a recombinant human growth hormone was developed as a biosimilar medicinal product to 
the reference product Genotropin and has been approved in the European Union since 2006 through a 
centralised procedure (EMEA/H/C/607) for the following indications: 
Infants, children and adolescents  
-  Growth  disturbance  due  to  insufficient  secretion  of  growth  hormone  (growth  hormone 
deficiency, GHD).  
-  Growth disturbance associated with Turner syndrome.  
Final assessment report for paediatric studies submitted in accordance with article 46 
of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended  
EMA/201250/2021  
Page 4/26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
-  Growth disturbance associated with chronic renal insufficiency.  
-  Growth  disturbance  (current  height  standard  deviation  score  (SDS)  <  -2.5  and  parental 
adjusted height SDS < -1) in short children/adolescents born small for gestational age (SGA), 
with a birth weight and/or length below -2 standard deviation (SD), who failed to show catch-
up growth (height velocity (HV) SDS < 0 during the last year) by 4 years of age or later.  
Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), for improvement of growth and body composition. The diagnosis 
of PWS should be confirmed by appropriate genetic testing.  
- 
Adults  
-  Replacement therapy in adults with pronounced growth hormone deficiency.  
Dosing 
Dosing  in  the  paediatric  population  varies  between  indications  and  ranges  from  0.025  to  0.050 
mg/kg/day. 
For  PWS  the  dose  regimen  is,  generally,  a  dose  of  0.035  mg/kg  body  weight  per  day  or  1.0  mg/m2 
body surface area per day. Daily doses of 2.7 mg should not be exceeded.  
Treatment should not be used in paediatric patients with a growth velocity less than 1 cm per year and 
near closure of epiphyses. 
For SGA the dose regimen is a dose of 0.035 mg/kg body weight per day (1 mg/m2 body surface area 
per  day)  until  a  final height  is  reached  (see  section  5.1).  Treatment  should  be  discontinued  after  the 
first  year  of  treatment  if  the  height  velocity  SDS  is  below  +  1.  Treatment  should  be  discontinued  if 
height velocity is < 2 cm/year and, if confirmation is required, bone age is > 14 years (girls) or > 16 
years (boys), corresponding to closure of the epiphyseal growth plates.  
3.3.2.  Clinical study 
EP00-501: PATRO Children  
Description 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  investigate  the  long-term  safety  of  Omnitrope  in  infants, 
children and adolescents treated within routine clinical practice, with particular focus on the following 
aspects: 
  Diabetogenic potential of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) therapy in short children 
born small for gestational age (SGA) and treated for growth disturbance, 
  Occurrence of malignancies in rhGH treated patients, 
  Risks of rhGH treatment in Prader-Willi-Syndrome (PWS) patients, 
  Occurrence and clinical implications of anti-rhGH antibodies. 
The secondary objective was to collect and analyse data on the effectiveness of treatment. 
CHMP Rapporteurs comment 
This PMS was set-up as part of a post-authorisation commitment and is classified as a category 3 Post- 
Authorization Safety Study (PASS) following the current European Pharmacovigilance legislation. Via 
this non-interventional surveillance method information on the long-term safety of Omnitrope is

gathered with a specific focus on the aspects mentioned above. A second interim analysis with data 
until November 2017 has been submitted and assessed in 2018. Based on this interim analysis, a 
PSUSA and a literature review, the applicant submitted a request to close this study which was 
accepted in February 2020. In the current procedure, the final CSR for study EP00-501 is submitted.  
Study design 
This study was an international, non-interventional, non-controlled, longitudinal, open and multicenter 
PMS,  designed  to  record  the  safety  and  effectiveness  data  of  paediatric  patients  treated  with 
Omnitrope in various indications within routine clinical practice since 2006. 
As an observational data collection of paediatric patients, the PATRO children PMS study involved the 
examination  and  evaluation  of  medical  care  without  “controlling”  the  therapy  beyond  normal  medical 
practice.  The  diagnosis  of  the  primary  disease  and  the  treatment  with  Omnitrope  was  left  to  the 
discretion of the paediatric endocrinologist. All data recorded during patient visits that were available in 
the charts (e.g. laboratory data and any other findings of examinations) and relevant for effectiveness 
and safety evaluation were to be documented corresponding to the Protocol. 
The frequency of visits was at the discretion of the treating physician. No additional or specific visits, 
tests  or  assessments  were  required  for  the  purposes  of  this  PMS.  For  all  children  and  adolescents 
treated  with  Omnitrope  within  routine  clinical  practice,  all  available  data  (visits,  laboratory  data  and 
other findings of examinations) were requested at least once a year. 
Study population 
The  paediatric  indications  that  could  be  enrolled  across  the  countries  where  Omnitrope  received 
marketing authorisation are listed below. Per indication, additional specific information was requested 
to be documented the eCRF. 
GHD: Type of pGHD and corresponding etiology 
TS: Karyotype and specification of the genetic abnormality 
CRI: Etiology and current status of the patients 
SGA: IUGR was diagnosed with the gestational age 
PWS: If DNA mutation was analysed with the specification of the genetic abnormality 
ISS: Specification of any abnormalities during fetal growth or abnormal body proportion  
Treatments 
This  was  a  non-interventional  study  to  investigate  Omnitrope  in  clinical  practice.  Omnitrope  was 
administered  subcutaneously  according  to  prescribing  recommendations  in  each  participating  country 
(see table 1).

Table 1 Paediatric Omnitrope treatment across regions 
All  concomitant  therapy  was  to  be  documented  by  providing  generic  drug  name,  route  of 
administration, the reason for use (clinical indication), and start and stop dates of administration. 
Once  included  in  the  PMS  study,  it  was  anticipated  that  patients  were  treated  with  Omnitrope  until 
achieving  final  height.  However,  Omnitrope  treatment  could  be  interrupted  and  discontinued  at  the 
discretion of the physician. Moreover, every patient, and his or her legal representative, had the right 
to withdraw their Informed Consent at any time without giving any reason. 
All  data  generated  up  to  the  time  of  withdrawal  of  the  Informed  Consent  or  study  discontinuation 
including all periods of interruption of Omnitrope treatment was to be analysed. The reason(s) and the 
definite discontinuation had to be recorded. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Safety  assessments  consisted  of  monitoring  and  recording  of  all  AEs,  including  SAE,  regardless  of 
whether suspected to be related to Omnitrope or not.

Particular  emphasis  was  placed  on  long-term  safety,  the  development  of  diabetes  mellitus  during 
treatment  with  Omnitrope  in  patients  born  SGA  (if  applicable),  the  recording  of  malignancies,  any 
safety issues in patients with PWS and the occurrence and clinical implications of anti-rhGH antibodies 
(if assessments were performed). 
Auxologic parameters were measured to assess Omnitrope effectiveness. The following were recorded: 
  Height (H) and H SDS 
  Height velocity (HV) in cm/year and HV SDS  
The  SDS  represents  the  relative  deviation  from  the  mean  value  of  normally  growing  children  of  the 
same gender and CA and according to the relevant country-specific references.   
Other growth parameters assessed in the PMS study were target height and target height SDS. These 
parameters  were  derived  from  the  height  of  the  patient’s  mother  and  father.  Also,  the  patient’s  final 
height and final height SDS were assessed for patients who reached final height.   
Bone age and anthropomorphic measures were expected to be documented if and as performed during 
routine clinical practice.  
CHMP Rapporteurs comment 
The  per  the  study  protocol  defined  outcomes  are  suitable  to  assess  the  long-term  safety  and 
effectiveness of Omnitrope.  
Statistical Methods 
Sample size justification 
As specified in the European RMP, the original intention was to enroll a total of 600 patients. Based on 
epidemiological  data,  this  should  include  approximately  100  to  200  patients  with  the  indication  SGA, 
and approximately 30 patients with PWS. However, later enrollment was no longer limited to the total 
of 600 patients in order to enroll the requested 30 patients with PWS. In addition, it was considered to 
further  extend  the  global  safety  database  of  Omnitrope  in  patients  with  growth  disorders  and  short 
stature and to fulfil local commitments including separate country-specific analyses: 
 
France: to follow-up at least 300 SGA patients until reaching final height 
  Taiwan: to follow-up 20 GHD and/or TS patients for at least 3 years, even if discontinued from 
Omnitrope treatment before 
Generally, a population of at least 7,000 patients using the “rule of three” allows for signal detection of 
rare events occurring at 4.3/10 000 patient-years, being the estimated upper limit of the 95% CI for 
the  probability  of  a  rare  event  (Eypasch  et  al.  1995,  Jovanovic  and  Levy  1997).  Short  children  born 
SGA  may  be  at  an  increased  risk  of  insulin  resistance  and  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  in  later  life 
(McCance et al. 1994, Curhan et al. 1996, Phillips 1996, Lithell et al. 1996, Reynolds and Phillips 1998, 
Rich-Edwards et al. 1999, Boyko 2000, Veening et al. 2002, Cutfield et al. 2003). 1900 patients born 
SGA followed for 5 years, correspond to 9500 patient-years. If the estimated proportion of diabetes is 
0.01, the chance of observing at least one rare event of diabetes in this SGA population is >99.9%.  
Statistical  tests  were  not  applied  and  consequently  p-values  to  indicate  statistically  significant 
differences were not provided. Summarised descriptive data is provided.  
Safety set (SAF) 
The SAF consisted of all patients documented within the EDC application. Patients for whom neither a 
visit date nor a start date of Omnitrope treatment has been documented were excluded from the SAF.

of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended  
EMA/201250/2021  
Page 8/26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Effectiveness set (EFF) 
The EFF was a subset of the SAF and consisted of all patients: 
  Aged < 18 years at baseline 
  With a documented height measurement at baseline (start of Omnitrope treatment) 
  At least one measurement of height under Omnitrope treatment at least 60 days after baseline 
 
Patients with known or re-categorized Other primary diagnosis 
CHMP Rapporteurs comment 
The MAH had provided a sample size calculation to justify that the obtained sample size is sufficient to 
detect a rare event of diabetes in the SGA population. This is agreed with. No further calculations are 
made to detect the other events of interest; however, given the studies closure, this is not considered 
of relevance.  
The definitions of the safety set and effectiveness set are accepted.  
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Overall,  280  centres  in  11  European  countries,  21  centres  in  North  America  (Canada:  7  centres  and 
USA: 14 centres), 1 centre in Australia and 2 centres in Taiwan have recruited a total of 7359 patients 
by  the  database  lock  date  (23-Jul-2020)  for  the  final  analysis.  7359  patients  were  included  in  the 
analysis for safety (SAF) and 6589 patients in the analysis for effectiveness (EFF).

Figure 1 Patient flow chart 
Discontinuations 
In  addition  to  the  reasons  mentioned  in  the  flow  chart  above,  patients  discontinued  for  the  following 
reasons (above 1% of the cases):  
Non-responder: 134 (1,8%) 
Patient non-compliant: 93 (1.3%) 
Physician decision: 89 (1.2%) 
CHMP Rapporteurs comment 
A  total  of  7359  patients  have  been  enrolled  that  are  evaluable  in  the  safety  set.  Of  those,  6589  are 
evaluable for effectiveness. This is considered a significant sample size.  
Unsurprisingly,  due  to  the  requested  closure  of  the  study,  the  most  frequent  reason  for 
discontinuations is a documentation stop requested by the sponsor. The other discontinuations do not 
give rise to any new relevant concerns.

Baseline data 
Most  patients  received  Omnitrope  treatment  because  they  were  diagnosed  with  GHD;  4260  (57.9%) 
patients,  followed  by  patients  born  SGA;  1958  (26.6%)  patients.  Considerably  fewer  patients  were 
treated with Omnitrope for TS with 363 (4.9%) patients, PWS with 235 (3.2%) patients, ISS with 243 
(3.3%)  patients  and  CRI  with  74  (1.0%)  patients.  225  (3.1%)  patients  were  treated  with  Omnitrope 
for  Other  indications  (after  re-categorisation)  and  1  (0.0%)  patient  for  an  Unknown  indication. 
Treatment naïve were 6326 (86%) patients, and 3009 (41%) were female patients. 
Overall, baseline H SDS ranged from -6.7 to 2.9, with a mean (SD) of -2.51 (1.08). Baseline HV SDS 
(CS) ranged from -7.4 to 9.2, with a mean (SD) of -1.78 (1.89) and baseline HV SDS (PC) ranged from 
-11.9  to  16.8,  with  a  mean  (SD)  of  -2.48  (2.68),  approximately  50%  of  both  HV  SDS  assessments 
were  missing.  Baseline  BMI  SDS  ranged  from  -5.7  to  5.3,  with  a  mean  (SD)  of  -0.35  (1.36).  As 
expected,  rhGH  pre-treated  patients  were  closer  to  country-specific  growth  reference  charts 
considering  H  SDS  (median  -1.50  vs  -2.64  in  naïve  patients)  and  had  higher  HV  SDS  (CS  and  PC) 
values than naïve patients; this holds true for all indications. Median BMI SDS was -0.08 in rhGH pre-
treated and -0.40 in naïve patients. Positive median BMI SDS values were observed in naïve patients 
with TS and  CRI and in rhGH pre-treated patients with TS, PWS, and nil in Other indication. Patients 
born SGA, patients with TS,  CRI, ISS, and Other indication were shorter than patients with GHD and 
PWS regarding H SDS. Patients with PWS were taller than all patients, having a higher HV as measured 
in H SDS or HV SDS (CS (cross-sectional) and PC (peak centred)). 
CHMP Rapporteurs comment 
The  proportions  of  enrolled  patients  by  indication,  pre-treatment  and  gender  are  similar  to  the 
proportions  in  the  previous  report.  No  new  concerns  could  be  identified  from  the  provided  data  on 
baseline characteristics.  
Pre-existing Diabetes Mellitus 
Pre-existing  diabetes  mellitus  was  recorded  in  19  (0.3%)  of  7359  patients;  12  (0.2%)  patients  had 
type 1, 2 (0.0%) patients had type 2, and 4 (0.1%) patients had type 3 diabetes mellitus (other than 1 
or 2) and 1 (0.0%) patient had diabetes mellitus of unspecified type. Nearly all patients who had pre-
existing diabetes mellitus were naïve of previous rhGH treatment; 2 patients (1 patient with type 1 and 
1 patient with type 3 diabetes mellitus) were rhGH pre-treated. 
Pre-existing diabetes mellitus was most prevalent in patients with GHD (total: 10 patients; 8 patients 
with  type  1,  1  patient  with  type  3  and  1  patient  with  unspecified  diabetes  mellitus),  followed  by  TS 
(total:  5  patients;  2  patients  with  type  1,  1  patient  with  type  2  and  2  patients  with  type  3).  Pre-
existing  diabetes  mellitus  was  recorded  in  2  patients  born  SGA  (1  patient  with  type  1  and  1  patient 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus). One patient with PWS had type 1 diabetes mellitus, and another patient 
with Other indication had type 3 diabetes mellitus.  
Pre-existing impaired glucose tolerance was recorded in 58 (0.8%) patients. Also, other hyperglycemic 
conditions,  such  as  insulin  resistance  in  15  (0.2%)  patients,  impaired  fasting  glucose  in  3  (0.0%) 
patients  and  metabolic  syndrome  in  1  (0.0%)  patient,  were  recorded  under  this  High-Level  Term. 
Slightly higher proportions were observed in patients with TS and PWS.  
Pre-existing malignancies 
The medical history and concomitant diseases recorded 304 pre-existing neoplasms in SOC ‘Neoplasms 
benign, malignant and unspecified (incl. cyst and polyps)’ in 285 (3.9%) patients. A total of 143 pre-
existent malignant neoplasms were counted in 129 (1.8%) patients. Most of these patients were naïve

of previous rhGH treatment with 131 events in 117 (1.8%) patients, and few were pre-treated with 12 
events in 12 (1.2%) patients.  
Most  frequently,  patients  with  GHD  had  pre-existing  malignancies;  pre-treated:  12  events  in  12 
(1.2%) patients and naïve patients: 124 events in 110 (1.7%) patients. Three (<0.1%) patients born 
SGA, 2 (<0.1%) patients with CRI and single (each <0.1%) patients with TS and Other indication had 
a pre-existing malignancy. 
There were 5 patients all GHD, all naïve of previous rhGH treatment, who had a pre-existing neoplasm 
for it was unknown if it was malignant.  The three most frequent PTs of the pre-existent malignancies 
were: 
 
 
 
‘Medulloblastoma’ in 42 (0.6%) patients, all (1.0%) GHD 
‘CNS germinoma’ in 12 (0.2%) patients, GHD: 11 (0.3%) patients, Other: 1 (0.4%) patient 
‘Acute lymphocytic leukaemia’ in 8 (0.1%) patients, all (0.2%) GHD 
CHMP Rapporteurs comment 
Pre-existing  diabetes  and  malignancies  belong  to  comorbidities  that  can  be  expected  in  the  indicated 
patient population. 
Safety results 
The main objectives of this PMS study were to monitor the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus in 
short children born SGA, onset or reoccurrence of malignancies, antibody-induced lack of effectiveness, 
and  unexpected  adverse  events  in  patients  with  PWS  during  treatment  with  Omnitrope.  Therefore, 
these objectives are presented first. 
Extent of Omnitrope exposure 
Median Omnitrope treatment duration was 3.20 years; mean (SD): 3.66 (2.39) years, with a 
duration range from 0.0 to 13.4 years (0.0 to 160.4 months). Treatment duration was shorter in pre-
treated patients (median 2.93 years) than in naïve patients (median 3.28 years). Treatment duration 
was  shorter  in  patients  with  CRI  (median  2.28  years)  and  in  patients  with  Other  indication  (median 
3.09 years), and treatment duration was longer than in the total cohort in PWS patients (median 4.74 
years);  comparable  treatment  duration  was  observed  in  patients  born  SGA,  with  GHD,  TS,  and  ISS. 
Median  rhGH  treatment  duration  was  7.3  years/87.00  months;  mean  (SD):  87.53  (35.59)  months  in 
pre-treated patients versus a median Omnitrope treatment duration of 3.3 years/39.36 months; mean 
(SD): 44.74 (29.03) months in naïve patients. 
In  pre-pubertal  patients,  the  median  rhGH  treatment  duration  was  5.3  years/64.10  months;  mean 
(SD): 62.07 (33.84) months in pre-treated patients versus a median Omnitrope treatment duration of 
1.4  years/17.20  months;  mean  (SD):  26.20  (28.01)  months  in  naïve  patients.  Table  2  presents  the 
number patients and patient-years per indication. The PMS study collected data of 7359 patients and 
26957.0 patient-years until study closure.

CHMP Rapporteur’s comment 
The extent of exposure is considered sufficient to be able to assess the long term safety concerns that 
were pre-defined as safety objectives in this study. 
Development of type 2 diabetes mellitus 
Three patients developed type 2 diabetes mellitus while participating in the PMS study: 
  One patient had GHD and was naïve of previous rhGH treatment; the patient developed type 2 
diabetes mellitus and impaired glucose tolerance during the first year of Omnitrope treatment. 
The  physician  assessed  that  there  was  no  relationship  to  Omnitrope  treatment;  the  sponsor 
suspected a potential causal relationship to Omnitrope treatment. 
  One  patient  was  born  SGA  and  was  naïve  of  previous  rhGH  treatment;  the  patient  developed 
type 2 diabetes mellitus during the second year of Omnitrope treatment. Physician and sponsor 
suspected no relationship to Omnitrope treatment. 
  One  patient  had  PWS  and  was  pre-treated  with  Genotropin  at  0.8  mg/day  for  33.0  months 
(2.75  years)  before  enrollment  in  the  PMS  study,  the  patient  developed  type  2  diabetes 
mellitus  and  had  increased  glycosylated  haemoglobin  during  the  seventh  year  of  Omnitrope 
treatment.  The  physician  suspected  no  relationship  to  Omnitrope  treatment;  the  sponsor 
suspected a causal relationship to rhGH treatment.

Development of type 1 diabetes mellitus 
Three patients born SGA developed type 1 diabetes mellitus while participating in the PMS Study: 
  One patient had pre-treatment with Genotropin at 1.30 mg/day for 88.0 months (7.33 years) 
before  enrollment  in  the  PMS  study;  the  patient  developed  type  1  diabetes  mellitus  in  the

second  year  of  Omnitrope  treatment.  The  physician  suspected  no  relationship  to  Omnitrope 
treatment; the sponsor assessed the causality to Omnitrope as not assessable. 
  One patient who was naïve of previous rhGH treatment developed type 1 diabetes mellitus in 
the  second  year  of  Omnitrope  treatment.  The  physician  and  the  sponsor  suspected  no 
relationship to Omnitrope treatment. 
  One patient who was naïve of previous rhGH treatment developed type 1 diabetes mellitus in 
the  first  year  of  Omnitrope  treatment.  The  physician  and  the  sponsor  suspected  a  potential 
causal relationship to Omnitrope treatment. 
All 3 patients who developed type 1 diabetes mellitus during the PMS study were born SGA. Diabetes 
mellitus  was  not  diagnosed  in  any  patient  of  the  other  indications.  The  incidence  rate  for  developing 
type  1  diabetes  mellitus  was  0.40  per  1000  patient-years  for  patients  born  SGA  and  0.11  per  1000 
patient-years for patients of the SAF.

CHMP Rapporteur’s comment 
During the PMS study, 3 patients developed type 2 diabetes. These patients were not known yet at the 
time of the second interim analysis. Two of those cases were suspected to be related to omnitrope 
treatment. It is agreed that a causal relationship cannot be ruled out. However, there are likely other 
confounding factors present in these patients that could cause diabetes, such as obesity. The only case 
of diabetes in an SGA patient was not suspected to be related to omnitrope treatment.  
Three patients developed type 1 diabetes during the PMS study. Three patients were known at the time 
of the second interim analysis, but it is unclear whether these are the same three patients. The MAH is 
requested to clarify (LoQ). These were considered not related to the study drug at the time, this is 
acknowledged since SGA has been described in the literature as a risk factor for childhood type 1 
diabetes.  
Development of glucose metabolism disorders 
A  small  proportion  of  patients  developed  glucose  metabolism  disorders;  82  events  in  81  (1.1%) 
patients, the incidence rate was 3.00 per 1000 patient-years across all indications. The indications with 
most  patients,  namely  GHD  and  SGA  showed  similar  proportions  of  affected  patients  and  incidence 
rates  per  1000  patient-years;  GHD:  36  (0.8%)  affected  patients,  incidence  rate  2.38,  SGA:  with  26 
(1.3%) affected patients, incidence rate 3.44. In all other indications, the number of affected patients 
was small, but the incidence rates for patients with TS (6.23 per 1000 patient-years) and PWS (5.99 
per 1000 patient-years) were about twice as high as across all indications.   
  There were 7 SAEs in 7 (0.09%) patients; the incidence rate was 0.26 per 1000 patient-years 
across  all  indications.  The  SAEs  were  observed  in  4  (<0.1%)  patients  with  GHD,  in  2  (0.1%) 
patients born SGA and in 1 (0.4%) patient with PWS.

  The  physician  and  sponsor  suspected  that  45  events  in  45  (0.6%)  patients  had  a  causal 
relationship to Omnitrope treatment.  
  Most  events,  with  57  events  in  57  (0.7%)  patients  did  not  mandate  a  change  of  Omnitrope 
treatment  and  most  events  with  77  events  in  76  (1.0%)  patients,  needed  no  further 
medication. 
  Most of the glucose metabolism disorders were mild or moderate, few were severe; 4 events in 
4 (<0.1%) patients. Severe events were observed in patients with TS with 1 event in 1 (0.2%) 
patient  and  in  patients  born  SGA  with  3  events  in  3  (0.1%)  patients.  The  incidence  rate  for 
severe glucose metabolism disorders was 0.15 per 1000 patient-years across all indications. 
  About  half  of  the  events  resolved  completely;  43  events  in  43  (0.5%)  patients  or  were  still 
ongoing;  37  events  in  37  (0.5%)  subjects,  at  the  time  of  study  closure.  Two  events  in  2 
(<0.1%) patients resolved with sequelae. 
  10 events in 10 (0.1%) patients led to permanent discontinuation of Omnitrope treatment.  
Table 5 Development of glucose metabolism disorders 
CHMP Rapporteur’s comment 
No unexpected number of glucose abnormalities was recorded.  
The risk minimisation measures concerning treatment of children born SGA and the increased risk of 
glucose metabolism abnormalities are included in section 4.4 of the SmPCs for somatropin and are 
considered adequate. 
Newly diagnosed malignancies 
A total of 11 new on-study malignancies were diagnosed in 8 patients and for 1 further patient it was 
unknown  if  her  newly  occurring  neoplasm  was  malignant.  Seven  patients  had  GHD,  6  were  naïve  of 
any  previous  rhGH  treatment  before  Omnitrope  start.  One  patient  had  TS  and  was  naïve  of  any 
previous rhGH treatment before Omnitrope start.  
  One  patient  had  a  newly  diagnosed  malignant  astrocytoma  and  neoplasm  progression  in  the 
4th  year  after  Omnitrope  treatment,  for  which  the  physician  suspected  no  relationship  to

Omnitrope, and the sponsor could not assess the relationship. The patient had TS (Mosaicism; 
Karyotype XX/X), which might be a potential genetic predisposition for neoplasm development. 
  One patient had experienced a medulloblastoma leading to GHD prior to the start of Omnitrope 
treatment;  the  physician  considered  the  development  of  the  papillary  thyroid  cancer  in  this 
patient as a consequence of radiation treatment of the medulloblastoma. The medulloblastoma 
was regarded as a second primary cancer. 
  One patient had suffered from acute lymphocytic leukemia which was treated by allogenic bone 
marrow  transplantation  prior  to  start  of  Omnitrope  treatment  and  later  on  developed  a 
neuroendocrine  tumor.  Secondary  to  this,  the  patient  developed  metastases  to  liver  and 
peritoneum. 
  One patient had a history of pituitary disorder. Acute lymphocytic leukemia was diagnosed 2.3 
years  after  the  start  of  Omnitrope  treatment.  The  physician  and  sponsor  suspected  no 
relationship to Omnitrope treatment. 
  One patient had a history of neurosecretory dysfunction that possibly could have been related 
to the beginning of a developing malignant neuroblastoma prior to Omnitrope treatment. The 
patient  had  an  18-month  latency  period  between  start  of  Omnitrope  treatment  and  cancer 
diagnosis. The physician and sponsor suspected no relationship to Omnitrope treatment. 
  One  patient  had  secondary  hypothyroidism  reported  as  chronic  illness  and  developed 
myelodysplastic  syndrome  1.2  years  after  the  start  of  Omnitrope  treatment.  The  patient  was 
pre-treated  with  0.60  mg/day  Nutropin  AQ  and  had  an  overall  growth  hormone  treatment 
duration  of  34.6  months  (2.88  years).  This  patient  was  the  only  pre-treated  patient  with  a 
newly  diagnosed  malignancy.  The  physician  and  sponsor  suspected  no  relationship  to 
Omnitrope treatment. 
  One patient had an ovarian cyst diagnosed previously (as an AE) which might have contributed 
to  the  development  of  ovarian  adenoma,  that  was  diagnosed  during  the  fourth  year  of 
Omnitrope  treatment.  The  physician  and  sponsor  suspected  no  relationship  to  Omnitrope 
treatment. 
  One patient had experienced cryptorchism and ectopic testis which might have contributed to 
the development of testicular germ cell cancer, which was diagnosed during the second year of 
Omnitrope  treatment.  The  physician  and  sponsor  suspected  no  relationship  to  Omnitrope 
treatment. 
One  further  patient  experienced  a  benign  pituitary  tumour  (belonging  to  SOC  ‘Neoplasms  benign, 
malignant and unspecified (incl. cysts and polyps)’ and a pineal gland cyst belonging to SOC ‘Nervous 
system disorders’, it was unknown if the newly occurring neoplasm was malignant. 
Recurrence or progression of pre-existing malignancies 
In  the  medical  history  and  concomitant  diseases,  304  pre-existent  neoplasms  were  counted  in  285 
patients  (3.9%).  A  total  of  143  pre-existent  malignant  neoplasms  were  counted  in  129  patients 
(1.8%).  There  were  9  pre-existing  malignancies  in  7  (0.1%)  patients  (all  GHD  and  naïve  of  previous 
rhGH treatment) that were considered recurrences or progressions that occurred during the PMS study. 
The incidence rate was 0.26 per 1000 patient-years for patients who had a recurrence or progression 
of a pre-existing malignancy and were naïve of previous rhGH treatment. 
CHMP Rapporteur’s comment 
Of note the malignancy risk was previously extensively reviewed, i.e. in the context of the Article 20 
referral procedure EMEA/H/C/607/A-20. Based on the assessment of all available safety data, the B/R 
profile was considered to remain positive. A contra-indication was included that GH treatment should 
not be initiated in patients with active cancer (SmPC section 4.3). 
At the time of the last interim analysis, 7 patients were diagnosed with new malignancies. In the final 
CSR, the MAH reports 8 patients with malignancies. However, 1 patient reported before is not reported 
here,  and  two  new  patients  are  reported  here.  The  applicant  is  requested  to  clarify  this  discrepancy 
(LoQ).

At the last assessment, the conclusion was that it is was unlikely that the newly reported malignancies 
were caused by somatropin treatment.  
Compared to the last interim analysis, one additional patient was diagnosed with a recurrence of a pre-
existing malignancy.   
The new findings do not give rise to safety concerns with regard to new developed malignancies or the 
recurrence of existing malignancies. 
AEs with possible causal relationship to Omnitrope in patients with PWS 
The  AEs  with  a  possible  causal  relationship  to  Omnitrope  treatment  were  evaluated  if  they  were 
unexpected  or  unique  to  patients  with  PWS.  Overall,  56  AEs  with  a  possible  causal  relationship  to 
Omnitrope treatment were recorded in 39 patients (16.6%) with PWS.  
A medical assessment performed by the sponsor came to the conclusion that all 56 AEs with a possible 
causal relationship to Omnitrope treatment are expected in children with PWS. Of the 56 AEs, 34 were 
serious  (SAEs)  and  were  experienced  by  22  patients  (9.4%);  16  patients  recovered  completely  from 
the  SAEs  and  for  6  patients  the  SAEs  were  ongoing  at  study  closure.  The  intensity  of  the  AEs  with a 
possible  causal  relationship  to  Omnitrope  was  mostly  mild  in  12  (5.1%)  patients,  or  moderate  in  21 
(8.9%) patients, few were severe in 7 (3.0%) patients. Most AEs with a possible causal relationship to 
Omnitrope treatment were recorded in SOC ‘Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders’ (24 of 39 
patients).  In  addition,  drug-related  AEs  were  recorded  in  SOCs:  ‘Investigations’  and  ‘Metabolism  and 
nutrition disorders’ (each 4 of 39 patients), ‘Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders’ (3 of 39 
patients), ‘General disorders and administration site conditions’ and ‘Nervous system disorders’ (each 2 
of 39 patients). Other AEs with a possible causal relationship to Omnitrope treatment were recorded in 
different SOCs in individual patients.  
CHMP Rapporteur’s comments 
No safety concerns could have been identified from the data provided on the analyses of PWS patients. 
Data are in line with the expected safety and efficacy profile of the drug and the expected 
comorbidities in PWS patients.  
Antibody-induced loss of effectiveness 
As  the  PMS  study  was  non-interventional,  and  the  routine  anti-rhGH  antibody  sampling  was  not 
compulsory  –  the  systematic  collection  and  analysis  of  immunogenicity  data  was  not  possible.  Anti-
rhGH  antibody  assessments  were  generally  not  performed  in  daily  routine  unless  there  were  clinical 
concerns.  The  reason  for  testing  anti-rhGH  antibodies  was  not  documented.  The  currently  available 
rhGH  formulations  (including  Omnitrope)  very  rarely  cause  the  formation  of  anti-rhGH  antibodies.  In 
the  rare  cases  where  these  antibodies  were  observed,  the  antibodies  had  low  affinity  and  had  no 
clinical  consequences  for  the  patients  (Romer  et  al.  2009).  Overall,  only  a  low  number  of  anti-rhGH 
antibody  assessments  were  recorded:  31  assessments  in  31  patients  prior  to  baseline,  114 
assessments in 114 patients at baseline, and 122 assessments in 77 patients post-baseline. For all 77 
patients  with  post-baseline  anti-rhGH  antibody  assessments,  the  test  results  were  negative.  One 
positive  anti-rhGH  antibody  test  result  was  recorded  at  baseline  with  a  titer  index  value  of  2.03, 
thereafter,  3  post-baseline  test  results  were  negative.  One  patient  had  isolated  GHD,  was  naïve  of 
previous rhGH treatment and was non-pubertal. The patient reached a height of 130 cm, with H SDS: -
1.021,  HV  SDS:  0.435  (PC)  and  0.462  (CS)  at  CA  of  9  years  before  PMS  discontinuation  due  to 
physician’s decision. 
Considering  the  low  number  of  anti-rhGH  antibody  assessments,  further  evaluation  of  potential 
antibody-induced lack or loss of effectiveness in patients participating in the PMS study was considered 
not meaningful.

CHMP Rapporteur’s comments 
Data on anti-rhGH antibodies are scarce and incomplete, which hampers to draw proper conclusions on 
reported data. Based on the currently available data, no new relevant safety information could be 
identified. However, no post-baseline positive tests were recorded. In addition, the low number of tests 
also likely reflects that there were no clinical concerns that would warrant further investigation.  
Drug-related AEs 
Overall, AEs were suspected to be drug-related in 614 (8.3%) patients (835 events). These were most 
frequently in the SOCs ‘General disorders and administration site conditions’ with 219 (3.0%) patients 
and ‘Nervous system disorders’ with 137 (1.9%) patients. Across all indications, the most frequent AEs 
with a suspected causal relationship to Omnitrope treatment (by MedDRA PT) were ‘Headache’ in 121 
(1.6%)  patients,  ‘Injection  site  pain’  in  84  (1.1%)  patients,  ‘Injection  site  haematoma’  in  81  (1.1%) 
patients, and ‘Arthralgia’ in 47 (0.6%) patients. The majority of AEs assessed as related to Omnitrope 
treatment were expected based on the SmPC. 
CHMP Rapporteur’s comment 
The  reported  drug-related  AEs  are  known  from  Omnitrope  and  are  already  included  in  the  SmPC.  No 
safety concerns are raised based on the presented data. However, the MAH is requested to include the 
ADR Headache in section 4.8 of the Omnitrope SmPC (LoQ). 
Drug-related SAEs 
There were 84 (1.1%) patients who had 113 related SAEs.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
In patients with GHD (N=4260), the most frequent SAEs with a suspected relationship to study 
drug  were  ‘Endocrine  disorders’  in  11  (0.3%)  patients,  predominantly  ‘Hypothyroidism’  in  9 
(0.2%)  patients.  Other  drug-related  SAEs  occurring  in  more  than  1  patient  by  PT  were 
‘Neoplasm  progression’  in  3  (0.1%)  patients,  ‘Lipodystrophy  acquired’  in  4  (0.1%)  patients, 
and  ‘Glucose  tolerance  impaired’  in  3  (0.1%)  patients.  All  other  events  were  single  events 
occurring in individual patients. 
In patients with TS (N=363), there were 2 drug-related SAEs in 2 (0.6%) patients within the 
MedDRA  SOC  ‘Nervous  system  disorders’  (PT:  ‘Idiopathic  intracranial  hypertension’,  both 
events of moderate intensity).   
In  patients  with  CRI  (N=74),  there  was  1  drug-related  SAE  in  1  (1.4%)  patient  of  ‘Idiopathic 
intracranial hypertension’, mild intensity.  
In patients born SGA (N=1958), the most frequent SAEs with a suspected relationship to study 
drug  were  in  SOCs  ‘Endocrine  disorders’  with  5  (0.3%)  patients,  ‘Musculoskeletal  and 
connective tissue disorders’ with 4 (0.2%) patients, ‘Eye disorders’ with 3 (0.2%) patients and 
‘Metabolisms and nutrition disorders’ with 3 (0.2%) patients. Drug-related SAEs that occurred 
in  more  than  1  patient  were  ‘Hypothyroidism’  in  3  (0.2%)  patients,  ‘Glucose  tolerance 
impaired’ and ‘Otitis media chronic’ 2 (0.1%) patients each, other drug-related SAEs occurred 
in single patients. All events were single events occurring in individual patients. 
In patients with PWS (N=235), there were 34 drug-related SAEs in 22 (9.4%) patients with a 
suspected  relationship  to  study  drug.  The  most  frequent  MedDRA  PTs  were  ‘Sleep  apnoea 
syndrome’; 1 mild, 7 moderate and 3 severe in 11 (4.7%) patients, ‘Adenoidal hypertrophy’; 1 
mild,  3  moderate  in  4  (1.7%)  patients  and  ‘Tonsillar  hypertrophy’;  4  moderate  in  4  (1.7%) 
patients). All other AEs were single events occurring in individual patients.  
In  patients  with  ISS  (N=243),  there  was  1  SAE  in  1  (0.4%)  patient  with  a  suspected 
relationship to study drug; the preferred term was ‘Kyphosis’, the intensity was severe.

CHMP Rapporteur’s comment 
Overall, the reported SAE’s are known for Omnitrope and covered in the SmPC. However, the MAH is 
requested to include the ADR Hypothyroidism in section 4.8 of the Omnitrope SmPC (LoQ). The related 
SAE’s reported for PWS such as sleep apnea are considered a consequence of the disease rather than a 
treatment related AE.  
Adverse events of special interest 
For  targeted  follow-up,  the  RMP  stipulates  the  following  AEs  of  special  interest:  “Intracranial 
hemorrhage and intracranial aneurysm and possible drug interaction with sex steroids, corticosteroids, 
anticonvulsants and cyclosporine”. Two AEs were documented in 2 patients with GHD (one patient had 
‘Cerebral haemorrhage’ and one patient had ‘Intracranial aneurysm’) and 2 AEs in 1 patient  with TS: 
‘Subarachnoid haemorrhage’ and ‘Intraventricular haemorrhage’. 
CHMP Rapporteurs comment 
The two AE of special interest in the patient with TS were known at the second interim analysis 5 years 
ago.  The  two  additional  events  of  cerebral  hemorrhage  and  intracranial  aneurysm  are  considered 
related to pre-existing conditions and not to the study drug.  
Efficacy results 
In naïve and pre-treated patients, a sustained catch-up growth was observed as early as 1 year after 
start  of  Omnitrope  treatment  compared  with  baseline:  Naïve  patients  showed  an  increase  of  median 
(range) H SDS by +0.65 (-1.5 to 3.3) (from median -2.64 (-6.6 to 2.3) H SDS at baseline to -1.97 (-
6.8 to 2.6) H SDS after 1 year of treatment). In pre-treated patients, mean H SDS had increased by 
+0.24 (-3.8 to 2.9) (from -1.49 (-6.3 to 2.9) H SDS at baseline to -1.21 (-6.7 to 3.0) H SDS after 1 
year Omnitrope treatment. After 5 years of treatment, H SDS further increased by +1.79 (-3.7 to 6.2) 
change from baseline H SDS in naïve and +0.73 (-1.4 to 3.7) in pre-treated patients.

Final height and target height 
Overall, a total of 1628 (24.7%) patients with 1289 naïve patients, 338 rhGH pre-treated patients and 
1 missing patient reached final height according to the physician’s opinion. 
The median (range) final height SDS in naïve patients was -1.51 (-9.3 to 2.7) and -1.43 (-8.7 to 2.1) 
for pre-treated patients. Patients with GHD, irrespective of naïve or pre-treated, reached higher (less 
negative) final height SDS than all naïve or pre-treated patients (median -1.20 (-9.3 to 2.7)). Patients 
with other indications showed slightly lower (more negative) final height SDS values than observed for 
all  naïve  or  pre-treated  patients  (except  for  pre-treated  patients  with  PWS,  CRI  and  ISS  with  only  a 
few values to interpret). Within each indication, except for patients born SGA, pre-treated patients had 
slightly higher (less negative) final height SDS than naïve patients. 
Target  height  SDS  was  assessed  in  1483  (91.1%)  patients  of  the  1628  patients  who  reached  final 
height according to the physician’s opinion, of these patients 1175 were naïve (114 missing) and 308 
(30  missing)  were  rhGH  pre-treated.  The  median  (range)  target  height  SDS  in  naïve  patients  was  -
0.48  (-2.8  to  1.6)  and  -0.47  (-4.0  to  1.5)  for  pre-treated  patients.  Patients  with  TS  reached  higher

(less negative) target height SDS with median (range) -0.10 (-1.3 to 1.6) than observed for all naïve 
and pre-treated patients. Patients born SGA and with ISS showed lower (more negative) target height 
SDS values, than observed for all naïve or pre-treated patients. Within each indication, naïve patients 
had higher (less negative) target height SDS values than pre-treated patients, except for patients born 
SGA  and  with  ISS  for  whom  the  pre-treated  patients  had  higher  (less  negative)  target  height  SDS 
values than naïve patients. 
Similar median (range) difference between final and target height SDS was observed with -1.00 (-6.7 
to 2.4) in naïve patients and -0.94 (-5.2 to 1.8) in pre-treated patients. Patients with TS generally had 
the  greatest  median  (range)  difference  between  final  and  target  height  SDS  with  -2.07  (-4.2  to  0.4) 
and  patients  with  GHD  the  smallest  median  (range)  difference  between  final  and  target  height  SDS 
with -0.76 (-6.4 to 2.4).

Height velocity 
After baseline, Omnitrope treatment induced an above normal increase in HV SDS that leveled off to a 
normal HV SDS for most patients at or around the 5 years visit. This profile was observed for all and 
naïve  patients;  pre-treated  patients  had  a  higher  baseline  HV  SDS  and  most  pre-treated  patients 
reached normal HV SDS earlier, at or around the 2 years visit. HV SDS (CS) and (PC) versus analysis 
visit  showed  similar  profiles  for  naïve  and  pre-treated  patients,  between  indications  the  profiles  were 
roughly  similar.  Only  for  patients  with  PWS  no  great  difference  between  naïve  and  pre-treated  was 
observed with respect to the HV SDS versus analysis visit profiles. 
CHMP Rapporteurs comment 
The  MAH  presented  data  on  height  and  derived  parameters  per  indication  and  rhGH  pre-treatment 
status.  The  changes  in  derived  height  parameters  showed  the  expected  catch-up  growth  in  patients 
during the first year after start of treatment in naïve patients. As expected, the catch-up growth in pre-
treated patients is less pronounced since these patients had a higher HV at baseline and had a lower H 
SDS  compared  to  naïve  patients.  Continuous  improvements  in  H  SDS  are  visible  in  especially  naïve 
patients up to 10 years after start of treatment.  
In  the  population  of  patients  that  reached  final  height,  the  median  (range)  final  height  SDS  in  naïve 
patients was -1.51 (-9.3 to 2.7) and -1.43 (-8.7 to 2.1) for pre-treated patients. Slight differences are 
observed  between  the  different  underlying  conditions,  with  patients  with  GHD  having  the  best 
prognosis. Overall, these data are as expected and in line with the expected adult height after growth 
hormone treatment as reported in the literature. However, the information on the long-term safety and 
H SDS in patients reaching final height should be included in section 5.1 of the Omnitrope SmPC.

3.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Within this final CSR, the MAH submitted safety data of 7359 patients and effectiveness data of 6589 
patients enrolled in this long term noninterventional PASS study.  
The safety data provided in the final CSR support: 
 
 
 
 
that no safety concern has risen with regard to the ‘diabetogenic potential of rhGH therapy in 
short children born SGA’ during Omnitrope treatment.  
that no safety concern has risen with regard to the ‘occurrence of malignancies in rhGH treated 
patients’.  
that reported AEs findings did not identify a new significant safety concern which are 
unexpected and/or unique to patients with PWS. 
that no safety concern has risen with regard to the occurrence and clinical implications of anti-
rhGH antibodies. 
The effectiveness data provided by the MAH supports the benefit of Omnitrope. After initiation of 
Omnitrope treatment catch up growth is observed as expected. In addition, the final height of patients 
treated with Omnitrope is as expected.  
Overall, the final study data support safety and efficacy of Omnitrope throughout the range of 
indications in paediatric patients < 18 years of age.  
The applicant has updated section 4.8 and section 5.1. of the SmPC based on this new information at 
the request of the Rapporteur.   
4.  Additional clarification requested 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this 
procedure: 
1.  At the time of the last interim analysis, 7 patients were diagnosed with new malignancies. In 
the final CSR, the MAH reports 8 patients with malignancies. However, 1 patient reported 
before is not reported here and two new patients are reported here. The MAH is requested to 
clarify this discrepancy.  
2.  Three patients developed type 1 diabetes during the PMS study. Three patients were known at 
the time of the second interim analysis, but it is unclear whether these are the same three 
patients. The MAH is requested to clarify. 
3.  The MAH is requested to update the Omnitrope SmPC section 4.8 with the ADRs ‘Headache’ 
and ‘Hypothyroidism’ (frequency unknown), and section 5.1 with information on the long-term 
safety and Height Standard Deviation Score in patients reaching final height. A proposal of an 
updated SmPC is expected in the responses of this procedure. The formal finalisation of the 
SmPC update can be concluded in a separate type II variation. 
The timetable is a 30-day response timetable with clock stop.

5.  MAH responses to request for supplementary information 
Q1: At the time of the last interim analysis, 7 patients were diagnosed with new malignancies. In the final CSR, the 
MAH reports 8 patients with malignancies. However, 1 patient reported before is not reported here and two new 
patients are reported here. The MAH is requested to clarify this discrepancy.  
MAH response 
Sandoz acknowledges the Rapporteur’s finding regarding patient. 
The  reason  why  this  patient  is  no  longer  reported  in  the  final  CSR  as  diagnosed  with  a  “new 
malignancy”,  as  it  had  been  in  the  previous  second  interim  report,  is  due  to  the  fact  that  additional 
respectively updated information on this case became available after the second interim analysis data 
cut-off. Following this update, the ‘thickness of pituitary stalk’ was finally entered as ‘current illness’ in 
the medical history of this patient and the verbatim of this AE was adjusted to ‘progressive thickness of 
pituitary  stalk  histological  findings:  Germinoma  (malignant)’  accordingly.  The  investigator  rated  this 
adverse event as serious and as suspected to be causally related to Omnitrope treatment; this patient 
was consequently permanently discontinued from the study. 
Therefore, the initially diagnosed ‘Germ cell cancer’ which had been categorized conservatively in the 
second  interim  report  as  new  malignancy  (verbatim:  progressive  thickness  of  pituitary  stalk, 
histological  findings:  Germinoma)’  of  this  patient    has  now  been  presented  in  the  final  CSR  as 
progression  of  a  pre-existing  malignancy  and  not  anymore  as  a  new  occurring  malignancy. 
Consequently,  this  case  is  now  shown  in  report  Table  10-34  in  section  10.4.2.2  ‘Recurrence  or 
progression of preexisting malignancies’. 
The malignancies diagnosed in the mentioned two patients were indeed new cases both of which were 
reported  only  after  the  cut-off  date  of  the  second  interim  report,  and  therefore  newly  added  and 
presented in Table 10.33 ‘Newly diagnosed malignancies’ in the final CSR. 
Assessment of the response 
The  applicant  has  clarified  that  the  medical  history  of  this  patient  has  been  updated  to  reflect  the 
presence  of  thickness  of  pituitary  stalk  as  current  illness.  Therefore,  the  development  of  the 
germinoma has been re-classified as progression of a pre-existing malignancy. This is acknowledged. 
Conclusion 
Issue resolved.  
Q2: Three patients developed type 1 diabetes during the PMS study. Three patients were known at the 
time of the second interim analysis, but it is unclear whether these are the same three patients. The 
MAH is requested to clarify. 
MAH response 
Sandoz acknowledges this valid question. Actually, only two patients of the three patients reported 
with a new onset type 1 diabetes mellitus were identical in the second interim report and the final CSR. 
The third patient in the final report is different compared with the second interim report for the 
following reason: 
  The third patient was entered as new onset type 1 diabetes mellitus case only after the cut-off 
 
date of the second interim report, and thus appears as newly reported in the final CSR. 
In  contrast,  the  third  patient  from  the  second  interim  report    was  no  longer  considered  as  a 
new  onset  type  1  diabetes  mellitus  case  in  the  final  CSR  due  to  the  following  reason:  During

the course of the continued data cleaning process, the verbatim for this serious adverse event 
was corrected by the investigator from ‘Suspicious of starting Type 1 DM – coded by default as 
‘Type  1  Diabetes’  to  ‘Suspicious  of  Prediabetes’  that  is  hence  no  longer  considered  as  a  new 
case of Type 1 diabetes mellitus. This correction took place only after the cut-off date for the 
second interim report and could therefore only be updated in the current final CSR. In addition, 
a  second  serious  suspected  adverse  event  was  later  reported  (after  more  than  2.5  years)  for 
this patient  which confirmed the manifestation of the earlier suspected ‘Prediabetes’ (coded as 
PT  term  ‘Glucose  tolerance  impaired’  /  LLT  Term  ‘Prediabetes’);  this  adverse  event  was  not 
treated  with  any  concomitant  medication  but  resulted  in  permanent  discontinuation  of  the 
patient.  The  diagnosis  of  ‘Prediabetes’  was  also  verified  against  the  source  data  by  the  study 
monitor. (Of note, the patient’s relevant parameter for glucose metabolism had been regularly 
assessed  including  yearly  OGTT  assessments.)  Therefore,  this  case  is  now  presented  in  Table 
10-49 in section 10.7.4 ‘AEs leading to withdrawal from the PMS’. 
Assessment of the response 
The  applicant  has  clarified  that  of  the  3  patients  reported  as  “new  onset  type  1  diabetes”,  2  were 
already  known  at  the  time  of  the  interim  analysis.  One  patient  has  been  re-classified  since  to 
“prediabetes”  leading  to  withdrawal  from  the  study.  One  new  patient  has  been  identified  since  the 
second interim analysis.  
Conclusion 
Issue resolved.  
Q3: The MAH is requested to update the Omnitrope SmPC section 4.8 with the ADRs ‘Headache’ and 
‘Hypothyroidism’ (frequency unknown), and section 5.1 with information on the long-term safety and 
Height Standard Deviation Score in patients reaching final height. A proposal of an updated SmPC is 
expected in the responses of this procedure. The formal finalisation of the SmPC update can be 
concluded in a separate type II variation. 
MAH Response 
Sandoz acknowledges the request to provide an updated SmPC proposal. The following 
wording is proposed for the sections in scope: 
Section 4.8 Undesirable effect 
Post-marketing experience: 
Below  presented  adverse  drug  reactions  have  been  reported  in  post-marketing  studies,  along  with 
frequency estimation from the available data. 
Nervous system disorders: Headache (Frequency: unknown) 
Endocrine disorders: Hypothyroidism (Frequency: unknown) 
(The package leaflet has been updated accordingly.) 
Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties 
Post-marketing study experience: 
An  international,  non-interventional,  non-controlled,  longitudinal,  open  and  multicenter,  voluntary 
category  3  PASS  designed  to  record  the  safety  and  effectiveness  data  of  7359  paediatric  patients 
treated with Omnitrope in various indications was conducted by Sandoz between 2006 and 2020 in 11 
European countries, in North America, Canada, Australia and Taiwan. 
The  main  paediatric  indications  were:  GHD  (57.9%),  SGA  (26.6%),  TS  (4.9%),  ISS  (3.3%),  PWS 
(3.2%)  and  CRI  (1.0%).  Most  patients  were  naïve  of  previous  rhGH  treatment  (86.0%).  Across  all 
indications,  the  most  frequent  AEs  with  a  suspected  causal  relationship  to  Omnitrope  treatment  in 
patients  were  headache  (1.6%),  injection  site  pain  (1.1%),  injection  site  hematoma  (1.1%)  and 
arthralgia (0.6%), assessed in 7359 paediatric patients (SAF). The majority of AEs assessed as related

to  Omnitrope  treatment  were  expected  based  on  the  SmPC  and  as  known  for  this  type  of  class  of 
molecule (GH). The intensity of most AEs was mild or moderate. 
The effectiveness results, assessed in 6589 paediatric patients (EFF), show that Omnitrope treatment 
was effective and resulted in a substantial catch-up growth which are consistent with those reported in 
observational studies of other approved rhGH medicines: the median H SDS increased effectively from 
-2.64 at baseline to -1.97 after 1 year and to -0.98 after 5 years of treatment in naïve patients, and a 
median  H  SDS  increased  from  -1.49  to  -1.21  after  1  year  and  to  -0.98  after  5  years  of  Omnitrope 
treatment in pre-treated patients. 1628 (24.7%) patients of the EFF reached final height according to 
physician’s opinion (naïve: 1289, 22.7%); rhGH pretreated: 338, 36.9%). Median (range) final H SDS 
in naïve patients -1.51 (-9.3 to 2.7) and -1.43 (-8.7 to 2.1) in pre-treated patients. 
Assessment of the response 
The additions to section 4.8 should also be included in the table with ADR’s.  
The proposed addition to section 5.1 is endorsed.  
6. Rapporteur’s final overall conclusion and recommendation 
  Fulfilled 
The applicant has submitted the final CSR for study EP00-501, a non-interventional PASS study in 
children treated with Omnitrope in clinical practice.  
The safety and effectiveness data, as presented in the CSR are in general as expected and do not give 
rise to any concerns with regard to long term safety or the effectiveness of the product.  
The MAH is requested to include the adverse drug reactions “Hypothyroidism” and “Headache” in the 
ADR tables of section 4.8 of the Omnitrope SmPC when the SmPC is formalized in a type II variation.

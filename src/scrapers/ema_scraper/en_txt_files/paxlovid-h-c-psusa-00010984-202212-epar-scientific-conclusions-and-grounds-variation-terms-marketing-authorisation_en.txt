Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for (1r,2s,5s)-n-{(1s)-1-cyano-2-
[(3s)-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl]ethyl}-6,6-dimethyl-3- [3-methyl-n-(trifluoroacetyl)-l-valyl]-3-
azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2-carboxamide / ritonavir (Paxlovid), the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as 
follows:  
In view of available data on dysgeusia from the literature and spontaneous reports, including a high 
number of patients specifying the altered taste as metallic, bitter taste, the PRAC considers that a more 
precise description of dysgeusia in section 4 of the PL may be useful for patients. The PRAC concluded 
that the product information of products containing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir should be amended accordingly. 
Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and 
grounds for recommendation. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for (1r,2s,5s)-n-{(1s)-1-cyano-2-[(3s)-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-
yl]ethyl}-6,6-dimethyl-3- [3-methyl-n-(trifluoroacetyl)-l-valyl]-3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2-
carboxamide / ritonavir (Paxlovid) the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the 
medicinal product(s) containing (1r,2s,5s)-n-{(1s)-1-cyano-2-[(3s)-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl]ethyl}-6,6-
dimethyl-3- [3-methyl-n-(trifluoroacetyl)-l-valyl]-3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2-carboxamide / ritonavir 
(Paxlovid) is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

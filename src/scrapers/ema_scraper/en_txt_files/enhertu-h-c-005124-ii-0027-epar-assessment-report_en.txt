2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
The MAH initially applied for the following indication: 
Enhertu as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic 
NSCLC whose tumours have activating HER2 (ERBB2) mutations and who have received a prior systemic 
therapy. 
During the procedure the indication was amended. The agreed indication is as follows: 
Enhertu as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced NSCLC whose 
tumours have an activating HER2 (ERBB2) mutation and who require systemic therapy following 
platinum-based chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy. 
Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in the 
world. In 2020, there were an estimated 2.21 million new cases of lung cancer globally (11.4% of all new 
cancers), with an estimated 1.8 million deaths due to the disease (18.0% of all cancer deaths). (Sung H 
et al., 2021). Despite progress in earlier detection, a majority of lung cancers (57% in the US for the 
2009 to 2015 period) are still commonly diagnosed at the metastatic stage, when the disease is not 
curable, with a 5-year relative survival rate of 5.2%. (Howlader N et al., 2019) 
The therapeutic approach to lung cancers is based on the specific histologic and genetic characteristics of 
the tumor.  Lung cancers are classified into 2 major histologic types: the most common is NSCLC, found 
in ~85% of all lung cancers; small cell lung cancer occurs in ~15% of lung cancers. With the recent 
progress in targeted therapies for specific histologic subtypes in the last decade, NSCLC has been further 
categorized into 2 subtypes to determine eligibility for molecular testing and therapeutic strategies: non-
squamous carcinoma accounts for ~60% of all lung cancers and includes adenocarcinoma (~50% of all 
lung cancers3), large cell carcinoma (~9% of all lung cancers), and other tumor subtypes; squamous cell 
carcinoma accounts for ~30% of all lung cancers. (Pikor LA et al., 2013; Berbescu EA et al., 2012; NCCN 
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology, 2021).  
The identification of specific genomic alterations in tumors or immune biomarkers (programmed cell 
death ligand 1 [PD L1]) that are indicative of therapeutic efficacy of targeted therapies or immunotherapy 
transformed the therapeutic approach to and prognosis of metastatic NSCLC.  On the basis of current 
clinical practice guidelines in the US, Europe, and Japan, patients with metastatic NSCLC should undergo 
testing for PD L1 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) to determine whether they are candidates for 
immunotherapy. (NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology, 2021; Planchard D et al., 2018; 
Akamatsu H et al., 2019). In addition, patients should be tested for “predictive biomarkers” including, but 
not limited to, sensitizing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, anaplastic lymphoma 
kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements, ROS proto-oncogene 1 (ROS1) rearrangements, B Raf proto-
oncogene (BRAF) point mutations, neurotrophin tyrosine receptor kinase gene (NTRK) fusions, and c 
mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor exon 14 skipping mutations.  Patients with metastatic lung

cancer who are eligible for targeted therapies or immunotherapies are now surviving longer, with 5-year 
survival rates ranging from 15% to 50% depending on the predictive biomarker. (NCCN Clinical Practice 
Guidelines in Oncology, 2021).   
Despite these recent advances, most lung adenocarcinomas lack an actionable driver oncogene or 
eventually progress after treatment with targeted therapies or immunotherapies, and are still treated with 
conventional chemotherapy. (The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, Nature 2014). 
HER2 (also known as ERBB2) is an emerging targetable oncogenic driver in NSCLC.  Sequencing of HER2 
in lung tumors revealed the presence of somatic mutations within the kinase domain of HER2 in ~3% of 
all lung tumors (all of which were adenocarcinomas), suggesting a potential role for HER2-targeted 
therapies in patients whose tumors contain HER2 mutations. The majority of these mutations occur in 
exon 20.  HER2 mutations and other driver oncogene genomic alterations are usually mutually exclusive. 
Patients with tumors that have HER2 mutations tend to be female, never smoker, and younger (median 
age ~60 years).  (The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, Nature 2014; Pillai RN et al., 2017; 
Stephens P et al., 2004; Pao W et al., 2011; Mazières J et al., 2013). 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
In several studies, the survival outcome for patients with metastatic HER2-mutant lung adenocarcinoma 
was found to be shorter than that for patients with tumors harboring other driver mutations.  In a US 
Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium (LCMC) study (Pillai RN et al., 2017) conducted in 1007 patients with 
advanced lung adenocarcinoma, the median overall survival (OS) was lower in patients with HER2 
mutations independent of treatment received (1.37 years [~16.4 months] for those who received HER2-
directed therapy and 2.09 years [~25.1 months] for those who received systemic chemotherapy).  In 
comparison, in the overall LCMC study population, patients who had received targeted therapy for a 
driver mutation achieved a median OS of 3.5 years (~42.0 months) and those not treated with targeted 
therapy achieved a median OS of 2.4 years (~28.8 months) (Pillai RN et al., 2017).  The survival 
outcome in patients with HER2-mutant NSCLC in the LCMC study were similar to those reported in 
patients with HER2-mutant adenocarcinoma in the retrospective EUHER2 cohort (N = 101; median OS, 24 
months) and the nationwide genome screening project in Japan (LC-SCRUM) (N = 73; median OS, 18.8 
months). (Mazières J et al., 2013; Udagawa H et al., 2019) 
Management 
Outside of the US, there is no approved targeted therapy currently available for metastatic HER2 mutant 
NSCLC.   
Currently approved treatment options in the second-line setting without actionable oncogenic driver 
mutations show ORRs ranging from 5.5% to 22.9%, median DoR from 6.3 to 8.4 months, median PFS 
from 2.8 to 4.5 months, and median OS from 6.0 to 13.8 months. (Planchard D et al., 2019) 
The data obtained for the HER2-mutant population is limited and consists of real-world data and data 
from small retrospective cohorts (n=12-52 patients). The latter reported ORRs varying between 5-18% 
with median PFS 2.9-4.9 months , and median OS after first-line therapy 9.9-24 months. (Mazières J et 
al., 2013; Auliac, JB et al., 2019) 
Only one study provided data for the second line population for the HER2-NSCLC population. In the 
second line, the EUHER2 cohort (Mazières J et al., 2013) showed an ORR of 10% and a median PFS of 4.3 
months (95% CI: 3.1, 5.5). The reported median OS was 19.4 months (95% CI: 9.6, 24.7). This appears 
to be prolonged, but the reported mOS in HER2 NSCLC show a large variability. 
Assessment report  
EMA/444980/2023 
Page 10/143 
 
 
 
 
Patients may receive targeted therapy off-label by means of irreversible pan-HER TKIs or during trials. 
Limited evidence (n=24) with HER-2 targeted therapy shows that the OS might improve if HER 2 targeted 
therapy is given (median OS 1.4-year [~16 months] vs 2.1 years [~258 months]. (Pillai RN et al., 2017). 
A Phase 2 basket study of the HER2-targeting ADC trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in a small (N = 18) 
(Li, BT et al., 2018)  cohort of patients with metastatic or recurrent HER2 mutant lung cancer who had 
received a median of 2 prior lines of systemic therapy (range: 0 to 4) suggested a potential role for 
HER2-targeting ADCs in this patient population. In this study, confirmed ORR was 44% (95% CI: 22, 69) 
and median duration of response (DoR) was 4 months (range: 2 to 9). Responders were seen across 
HER2 mutation subtypes, including exon 20 insertions and transmembrane and extracellular domain point 
mutations.  
The limited efficacy of available therapies highlights the high unmet medical need for efficacious HER2 
targeted therapy for patients with metastatic HER2-mutant NSCLC who have received at least 1 prior 
therapy, which might be addressed by new targeted agents. There are currently no approved HER2-
targeted therapies for metastatic HER2-mutant NSCLC in Europe. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Enhertu (trastuzumab deruxtecan, T-DXd) is a HER2-directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed 
of a humanized anti-HER2 immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody with the same amino acid sequence 
as trastuzumab, covalently linked to the membrane-permeable topoisomerase I inhibitor deruxtecan 
(DXd) via a stable tetrapeptide based linker. 
In Europe, Enhertu is approved as monotherapy for advanced HER2+ breast cancer in second or ulterior 
line of treatment (5.4 mg/kg Q3W), advanced HER2-low breast cancer after chemotherapy (5.4 mg/kg 
Q3W), and advanced HER2+ gastric or gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma after a trastuzumab-based 
regimen (6.4 mg/kg Q3W).

events (SAEs), and SAEs reported cumulatively through 19 Jun 2022 are listed in the summary of 
clinical safety (SCS).  
DESTINY-Lung 04 has been ongoing since 28 Oct 2021. As of 20 Apr 2023, 195 subjects (target sample 
size is N=264, (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05048797) have been randomized. Enrolment is 
expected to be completed by Q3 2023. 
No scientific advice from the SAWP/CHMP was requested concerning the design of these trials. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The clinical studies included in this application were conducted with the approval of Ethics Committees or 
Institutional Review Boards and in accordance with established regulatory guidance, including relevant 
International Council for Harmonisation guidelines. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects. The 
studies were performed in accordance with the version of the Declaration of Helsinki that applied at the 
time they were conducted and with the principles of Good Clinical Practice. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
New non-clinical primary pharmacology studies in support of the new indication of mutant HER-2 positive 
NSCLC were submitted for assessment. Moreover, a secondary pharmacodynamics study has been 
submitted in support of this application and as a post-approval measure for the previous indications of 
breast-cancer. Finally, the environmental risk assessment was updated to include the new indication. 
T-DXd exhibits antitumor activity in HER2-expressing cancer cells by topoisomerase I inhibition through 
DXd which is released from T-DXd. T-DXd also exhibits antibody dependent cellular cytotoxic (ADCC) 
activity and HER2-mediated Akt phosphorylation inhibition. In vitro studies indicated that T-DXd exhibits 
HER2-expression-dependent cell growth inhibitory activity, and that the impact of drug conjugation on 
HER2 binding activity and ADCC activity is minimal. In vivo studies using HER2-positive tumor mouse 
xenograft models indicated that T-DXd exhibits more potent HER2-targeting antitumor activity and tumor 
regression than its mAb alone. 
Various mutations in HER2 have been reported across a variety of cancers including lung cancer, in 
various domains such as extracellular domain, transmembrane domain, juxtamembrane domain, and 
kinase domain. Many of these mutations are believed to induce HER2 activation and promote oncogenesis 
despite the variety of locations and types of mutations (point mutations or insertion-deletion mutations). 
Activated HER2 is believed to undergo efficient internalization and subsequent degradation. The activation 
of HER2 by mutation is therefore thought to facilitate HER2 internalization and degradation, which could 
be utilized by anti- HER2-ADCs and contribute to antitumor activity as a mechanism of action in HER2-
mutated tumors. 
Increased internalization is hypothesized to be one of the mechanisms of action in anti-HER2-ADCs for 
HER2-mutant tumors. Albeit with some variations, an increased tendency of internalization of T-DXd was 
observed in transgenic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells expressing various mutated HER2 (15

DM1) and the combination of T-DM1 and neratinib in a patient-derived xenograft model of HER2-mutant 
(A775_G776insYVMA) NSCLC.14 T-DXd showed potent antitumor activity in a xenograft model of HER2-
mutant (G776delinsVC) NSCLC cells in which HER2 expression was low. T-DXd also showed antitumor 
activity in xenograft models of transgenic NSCLC cells expressing various mutated HER2 (15 mutations) 
relative to the WT HER2-expressing model.

Internalization Activity of T-DXd in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells Expressing Wild Type or 
Mutated HER2 (Report Number CY20-H0009-R01) 
The activation of HER2 by mutation is thought to facilitate the internalization and degradation of HER2, 
and increased internalization may contribute to the mechanism of action of anti-HER2- ADCs against 
HER2-mutant tumors. The internalization activity of T-DXd in NSCLC cells was evaluated for various forms 
of HER2 mutations that are potentially HER2- activating in comparison with WT HER2 using a transgenic 
cell approach similar to that reported. 
Transgenic cells were established using an NSCLC NCI-H322 cell line. HER2 genes of WT or 15 mutations 
(extracellular domain mutation S310F; transmembrane domain mutations V659E and G660D; 
juxtamembrane domain mutations R678Q and V697L; kinase domain mutations L755S, L755P, D769Y,

A775_G776insYVMA, G776delinsVC, G776_V777insVGC, V777_G778insGSP, V777L, V842I, and T862A) 
were then introduced into the cells. Flow cytometry was used to quantify the amount of T-DXd bound to 
HER2 on the cell surface, before and after the 3-hour internalization. Internalization activity was 
determined as the ratio of internalized T-DXd after incubation for 3 hours in comparison to T-DXd on the 
cell surface prior to incubation. Internalization activity of T-DXd was also examined in the NSCLC cell line 
NCIH1781 harboring a HER2 mutation G776delinsVC. 
The results are shown in the Table below. The internalization activity of T-DXd was 23.2% in the WT 
HER2-expressing cells and ranged from 26.9% to 71.3% in the mutated HER2-expressing cells. The 
internalization activity of T-DXd was significantly higher in some mutated HER2- expressing cells than in 
the WT HER2-expressing cells.  
The internalization activity of T-DXd in the NCI-H1781 cell line was 60.1% ± 3.9% (mean ± standard 
error for 3 independent experiments). 
These results suggested that T-DXd showed various levels of internalization activity in the tumor cells 
expressing mutated HER2 that were examined in this study. An increased tendency toward internalization 
of T-DXd was noted in mutated HER2 compared with WT HER2 in this experimental setting.

In vivo 
Antitumor Activity of T-DXd in a Patient-Derived Xenograft Model of HER2- Mutant 
(A775_G776insYVMA) Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in NOD Scid Gamma Mice (Report Number 
Li BT et al. 2020) 
Antitumor activity of T-DXd was evaluated in a PDX model of HER2-mutant (A775_G776insYVMA) NSCLC 
in female NOD scid gamma mice, originally generated at Memorial Sloan Kettering. T-DXd was 
administered intravenously at 10 mg/kg once every 3 weeks to the mice (n = 6/group, initial dosing on 
Day 0). Antitumor activity was also evaluated for T-DM1 administered intravenously at 15 mg/kg weekly, 
neratinib administered orally at 20 mg/kg for 5 days a week, and a combination of T-DM1 and neratinib. 
Tumor dimensions and body weight for each mouse were measured twice a week. 
The results are shown in the figure below. Although the model was initially sensitive to both the T-DXd 
and the T-DM1 regimens, mice receiving T-DM1 or the combination of T-DM1 and neratinib showed tumor 
relapse shortly after treatment was discontinued. In contrast, mice receiving T-DXd showed no signs of 
tumor regrowth up to 1 month after treatment discontinuation. Antitumor activity of T-DXd was 
significantly superior to the combination of T-DM1 and neratinib (P < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA test). 
The results suggested that T-DXd was effective and superior to T-DM1 in NSCLC harbouring HER2 
mutation A775_G776insYVMA.

In order to examine antitumor activity of T-DXd for mutated HER2 in comparison with WT HER2, 
antitumor activity of T-DXd was evaluated in mouse xenograft models of NSCLC NCIH322- derived

V777_G778insGSP, V777L, V842I, and T862A) in female CAnN.Cg-Foxn1nu/CrlCrlj mice (nude mice). T-
DXd was administered intravenously at a single dose of 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg to the mice (n = 6/group, Day 
0). Tumor dimensions and body weight for each mouse were measured twice a week until Day 21. 
Antitumor activity was evaluated on Day 21. For any mice that were euthanized before Day 21, this 
evaluation was performed on the last measurement day when data from all mice were obtained. To 
compare the in vivo effectiveness of T-DXd in each mutated HER2 model against the WT HER2 model, the 
effectiveness ratio of T-DXd to WT HER2 model was calculated for each model by parallel line test. 
The results are shown in the table below. T-DXd at 10 mg/kg significantly inhibited tumor growth in all 
models tested. T-DXd also showed significant antitumor activity at the lower doses of 1 mg/kg and 3 
mg/kg, depending on the model. The ED50 value of T-DXd for the WT HER2 model was estimated to be 
4.3531 mg/kg, and for the 15 mutated HER2 models were estimated to range from 1.1167 mg/kg to 
6.2382 mg/kg (Table below). Effectiveness ratios of T-DXd in each mutated HER2 model, compared with 
the WT HER2 model, ranged from 0.7991 to 4.0257. Higher effectiveness ratios represent equivalent 
activity at lower doses than in the WT HER2 model, suggesting that T-DXd provides greater in vivo 
effectiveness in some mutated HER2 models than in the WT HER2 model. HER2 expressions in the 
xenografted tumors were determined as IHC scores ranging from 1+ to 3+. 
These results suggested that T-DXd showed antitumor activity in the tumor models expressing mutated 
HER2 that were examined in this study. The in vivo effectiveness of T-DXd in the mutated models relative 
to the WT HER2 model varied depending on the mutation. T-DXd showed higher effectiveness in some 
mutated HER2 models than in the WT HER2 model in this experimental setting.

intravenously at a single dose of 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg to the mice (n = 6/group, Day 0). Tumor dimensions 
and body weight for each mouse were measured twice a week until Day 21. 
The results are shown in the figure below. T-DXd at 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg significantly inhibited tumor 
growth by 96.7%, 97.3%, and 99.1%, respectively, compared with the vehicle control on Day 21 (P < 
0.0001 for all comparisons, Dunnett’s test). The 50% effective dose (ED50), which was defined as the 
estimated dose resulting in 50% tumor growth inhibition compared with the vehicle control, was <1 
mg/kg. HER2 expressed at a low level (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 1+) in this model. 
The results suggested that T-DXd was effective in NSCLC harboring HER2 mutation G776delinsVC, even 
at low levels of HER2 expression (IHC 1+).

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In vitro pharmacological actions of DXd were evaluated on a total of 86 receptors, channels, transporters, 
and enzymes by radioligand binding and enzyme assays at Eurofins Panlabs, Taiwan. The assays were 
performed in duplicate at concentrations of 10 μmol/L. Results showed that DXd had no significant 
response (within 50% inhibition of baseline) to those 86 receptors, channels, transporters, or enzymes 
(Report Number TW04-0008917), see Table below. 
In conclusion, DXd showed no significant affinity for any of the 86 targets at 10 μmol/L (approximately 
5000 ng/mL).

A comprehensive effort has been presented to show that T-DXd promote internalisation and cell killing in 
both wild type and mutated HER2 tumour cells. This was shown for 15 different mutations compared to

wild type HER2 and both in vitro and in vivo. The efficacy of a single dose in a mouse tumour model 
determined as ED50 was 4.4 mg/kg for wild type HER2 and in the range of 1.1 and 6.2 mg/kg for mutated 
HER2. Hence, the non-clinical proof of concept can be accepted. 
A safety pharmacology screen did not raise concern for off-target effects. 
Based on the updated data submitted in this application, the new indication does not trigger a Phase II 
environmental risk assessment.  
2.2.5.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
New primary pharmacology studies provide non-clinical proof of concept in support of the new indication 
of HER2 mutant NSCLC. A safety pharmacology screen did not raise concern for off-target effects. 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of trastuzumab deruxtecan. Considering the above data, trastuzumab 
deruxtecan is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

The clinical studies supporting this application are: the ongoing Study DS8201-A-U206 (DESTINY-Lung02, 
hereafter referred to as Study U206), the completed studies DS8201-A-U204 (DESTINY Lung01, hereafter 
referred to as Study U204) and DS8201 A J101 (hereafter referred to as Study J101). 
The proposed dose of T-DXd in patients with unresectable or metastatic NSCLC with activating HER2 
mutations is 5.4 mg/kg administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion Q3W. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Serum concentrations of the intact ADC T-DXd, total anti-HER2 antibody, and the topoisomerase I 
inhibitor DXd were measured to evaluate the PK of T-DXd by noncompartmental analysis (NCA). An 
integrated PK analysis across studies was done using data from NCA analysis as well as by PopPK 
analysis. Total anti-HER2 antibody concentrations refer to the concentrations of the mAb against HER2. 
No new bioanalytical methods were employed. 
Pop PK analyses 
Assessment report  
EMA/444980/2023 
Page 25/143 
 
 
 
 
 
The PK of T-DXd was describe by a two-compartment model with linear elimination and IV infusion. The 
PK of the DXd was described using a one-compartment model with two-component, time-varying release 
rate from the T-DXd (Equation 1) and a linear elimination. The first component of this T-DXd release rate 
was a constant reduction after Cycle 1, and the second component was a gradual decline per cycle (See 
Figure 4). 
Figure 4: T-DXd PK model structure 
The T-DXd population PK model was updated with data from Study U206 (interim analysis with data cut-
off date 24 Mar 2022) which was appended to the existing PK dataset. Study U206 enrolled patients with 
HER2-mutant metastatic NSCLC who received T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg (n=100) or 6.4 mg/kg (n=50). Study 
U204 also contributed data from patients with HER2 overexpressing and/or HER2 mutated NSCLC, where 
49 patients with HER2 exp NSCLC received 6.4 mg/kg, 41 patients with HER2 exp NSCLC received 5.4 
mg/kg and 91 patients with HER2 mutant NSCLC received 6.4 mg/kg. 
The full merged dataset was comprised of 24,558 T-DXd samples from 1821 subjects and 24,507 DXd 
samples from Studies J101, U204, U206, J102, A103, A104, U201, J202, U205, U302, and U303. A total 
of 1128, 293, 21, 346 and 34 subjects had breast cancer (BC), gastric or gastro-esophageal junction 
adenocarcinoma (GC), colorectal cancer (CRC), NSCLC and other cancers, respectively. A total of 65, 919, 
246, 100, 468 and 24 subjects had negative, positive, mutant, overexpressing, low and missing HER2 
status, respectively.  
Model parameters were re-estimated after inclusion of data from Study U206 using a sequential modeling 
approach. First, the T-DXd model was re-estimated using T-DXd PK data only. Second, the T-DXd PK 
parameters were fixed, and the remaining model parameters were re-estimated using both the T-DXd 
and the DXd PK data. A covariate modeling approach emphasizing parameter estimation rather than 
stepwise hypothesis testing was implemented. The full covariate model was constructed with care to 
avoid correlation or collinearity in predictors. For the population PK analysis, covariate effect sizes 
between 80% and 125% from the typical reference subject were used as a limit for clinically meaningful 
changes.

Efficacy-response analyses 
E-R analysis was conducted for confirmed ORR among subjects with HER2-mutant NSCLC across Studies 
U206, U204, and J101, using T-DXd average serum concentration over Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 (Cavg,Cycle 
2) as the exposure metric under logistic regression framework using a linear exposure logit ORR 
relationship. The existing model for ORR was updated with data from U204 and U206. Several covariates 
were included: albumin (ALB), time since diagnosis (TSD), sum of diameters (SOD), liver metastasis, 
prior platinum therapy (PLAT), prior platinum and anti PD(L)-1 therapy (PDL1), and race-country. Body 
weight was included as an exploratory covariate. None of the tested covariate effects were significant 
(See Figure 12). Residual plots and PPCs did not indicate model deficiencies (See Figure 13). 
Asian subjects were associated with higher ORRs than non-Asian subjects, larger baseline target tumour 
size were associated with lower ORRs and lower exposure than smaller baseline target tumour size. 
Simulations comparing T-DXd doses indicated no clinically relevant difference in ORR.

Safety-response analysis 
The data set for the exposure-safety analyses and for the Pop PK analyses came from the same studies. 
Evaluation of the exposure-safety relations were performed by logistic regression, except for interstitial 
lung disease (ILD) which was analysed by a parametric time-to-event (TTE) model. The exposure metrics 
selected for the final models were similar to prior E-R analyses including the initial BC application. Tumor 
type / HER2 status and prior checkpoint inhibitor were included for each safety point. Additional 
explorative covariates were evaluated and included if warranted by the diagnostics. 
The investigated safety endpoints were: Adverse events (AEs) associated with discontinuation of study 
drug, AEs associated with dose reduction of study drug, Grade ≥3 AEs, Serious AEs (SAEs), Any grade 
and Grade ≥3 (lab-defined) anemia (only Grade ≥3), Any grade and Grade ≥3 drug-related ILD and Grade 
≥2 left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decreased.

Dose selection 
The recommended dosing regimen for T-DXd in adult subjects with unresectable or metastatic HER2-
mutant NSCLC who have received ≥1 prior systemic therapy is 5.4 mg/kg Q3W. 
Results from Studies J101 and U204 demonstrate that a T-DXd dose of 6.4 mg/kg has clinical activity in 
subjects with HER2-mutant NSCLC and has an acceptable and generally manageable safety profile in this 
population of subjects with NSCLC (see sections 2.4 Clinical efficacy and section 2.5 Clinical safety). 
PK, safety, and efficacy data as well as E-R analyses for efficacy and safety endpoints for T-DXd in 
subjects with BC supported that the 5.4 mg/kg dose of T-DXd has a more optimal benefit-risk profile in

subjects with metastatic BC. These data along with PK similarity between NSCLC and BC subjects also 
supported that a 5.4 mg/kg dose would have clinical benefit in subjects with NSCLC. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
No new analytical methods were used for the data analyses. Final documentation for analyses of the data 
from U206 are recommended to be provided when finalized (REC).  
The existing Pop PK model for T-DXd and DXd was updated with data from Study U206 (data cut-off 24 
Mar 2022) from patients with HER2-mutant NSCLC (n=147). Overall, the diagnostic plots indicated the 
model could predict the observed data. Observed DXd exposure values following 5.4 mg/kg trastuzumab 
deruxtecan administration seem somewhat higher in subjects with NSCLC compared to subjects with 
breast cancer and seemed to be underpredicted by popPK analysis. The GoF plots for DXd indicated an 
underprediction of the individual DXd concentrations especially at the higher plasma concentrations. 
Shrinkage of the IIV values was rather high for DXd. However, as individual exposure-response data were 
only supportive in this procedure, no update of the DXd popPK model is requested for this procedure. 
The PK of NSCLC patients (Study U204 and U206) were comparable at each dose level and seemed 
independent of HER2 status. Study J101 also contributed data to the NSCLC population (n=18). The 
pooled NCA based PK analyses are not considered acceptable due to different PK sampling of the two 
investigated doses. A few NSCLC subjects from Study U204 had abnormal high Tmax values e.g. 211.4 
hours post-infusion due to concentration data right after infusion being missing or BLQ. Body weight had 
impact on both T-DXd and DXd exposures even the dose is weight based. The predicted AUC of DXd 
varied less over the investigated body weight span after 6.4 mg/kg compared to after 5.4 mg/kg in 
NSCLC-mutant subjects. Comparing the exposure in NSCLC patients by HER2 status with BC patients, 
based on the model predicted exposure metrics, the exposure ratios are close to 1 for each dose level. 
From a PK perspective, the rationale for selecting the lower 5.4 mg/kg dose Q3W over the 6.4 m/kg dose 
Q3W for HER2-mutant NSCLC patients can be supported if the exposure in NSCLC patients is comparable 
to BC patients. as indicated by post-hoc derived exposure metrics.  
There are no additional studies or analyses regarding QT intervals. The incidence of ADAs was low across 
cancer types and low in the studies including NSCLC patients. Immunogenicity is not expected to have 
any effect on exposure, efficacy or safety. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the clinical pharmacology of T-DXd in HER2 mutant patients is considered well described. 
However, final reports for bioanalyses conducted in Study U206 are recommended be provided (REC).

Study U206 (DESTINY-Lung02) 
Study U206 is an ongoing, global, multicentre, open-label, randomized, 2 arm, Phase 2 study to evaluate 
the safety and efficacy of 2 doses of T-DXd, 5.4 mg/kg and 6.4 mg/kg, in subjects with metastatic, 
centrally-confirmed HER2 mutant NSCLC who had disease recurrence or progressed during or after at 
least 1 regimen of prior anti-cancer therapy that must have contained platinum-based chemotherapy.  
The study design is presented in Figure 16.

Treatments 
Duration of treatment: During the Treatment Period, subjects were to receive the assigned dose of study 
drug Q3W until progression of disease or until the subject meets one of the discontinuation criteria 
(death, adverse event, progressive disease, clinical progression, withdrawal by subject, physician 
decision, lost to follow-up, pregnancy, protocol deviation, study termination by sponsor or other). 
Guidelines for dose modification: 
Assessment report  
EMA/444980/2023 
Page 49/143 
 
 
 
 
 
The investigator was to evaluate which toxicities are attributed to the study drug and adjust the dose of 
the drug as recommended below for study drug. All dose modifications were to be based on the worst 
preceding toxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] version 5.0). Specific 
criteria for interruption, re-initiation, dose reduction and/or discontinuation of trastuzumab deruxtecan 
are listed in table below, which is applicable only to TEAEs that were assessed as related to use of 
trastuzumab deruxtecan by the investigator(s).  
Once the dose of trastuzumab deruxtecan has been reduced because of toxicity, all subsequent cycles 
should be administered at that lower dose level unless further dose reduction is required. More than 2 
dose reductions are not allowed and the subject will be withdrawn from the study treatment if further 
toxicity meeting the requirement for dose reduction occurs. The adjustments for reduced dosing of 
trastuzumab deruxtecan depending on the initial starting dose are shown in Table 16. 
Table 16: Sample dose reduction levels of trastuzumab deruxtecan 
A dose could be delayed for up to 28 days (49 days from the last infusion date) from the planned date of 
administration. If a subject was assessed as requiring a dose delay of longer than 28 days, the subject 
was to be withdrawn from the study. Treatment cycles for a subject for whom trastuzumab deruxtecan 
dosing was temporarily withheld for any reason may have future cycles scheduled based on the date of 
the last trastuzumab deruxtecan dose.  
Investigators may consider dose reductions or discontinuations of the study drug according to the 
subject’s condition and after discussion with the Sponsor Medical Monitor. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 events, 
monitoring (including local laboratory tests when appropriate) should be performed at intervals no 
greater than 7 days until AE is determined to be resolving or subject is discontinued at EOT. Prophylactic 
or supportive treatment for expected toxicities, including management of study drug-induced AEs was to 
be as per treating physician discretion and institutional guidelines. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate confirmed ORR based on blinded ICR of tumor scans 
in subjects with HER2-mutant NSCLC.  Confirmation of response was required.   
Outcomes/endpoints 
The main objectives and endpoints are described in the following table.

Sample size 
The sample size in this study was determined on the basis of the probability evaluation that the 95% 
Clopper-Pearson CI exceeds and excludes the ORR benchmark of 26.4%. 
Consistent with the primary objective, for each of the two single arm treatment groups, the probability 
that the resulting Clopper-Pearson 95% CI will exceed and exclude the ORR benchmark of 26.4% will be 
evaluated. This benchmark is the upper bound of the 95% CI (ORR 22.9; 95% CI: 19.7 to 26.4) in 
ramucirumab plus docetaxel arm in the REVEL trial that was investigated as a second-line treatment for 
patients with stage IV NSCLC after platinum-based therapy. One hundred and fifty subjects will be 
randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive T-DXd at the 5.4 mg/kg or 6.4 mg/kg dose level, respectively. 
With 100 subjects to receive T-DXd at 5.4 mg/kg, the probability to exclude the ORR benchmark of 
26.4% is at least 80% when the true ORR is 40%. Assuming 50 subjects will be randomized in the 6.4 
mg/kg concurrent arm, the probability to exclude the ORR benchmark of 26.4% is at least 80% when the 
true ORR is 45%. Details of the probability evaluation under different true ORR values are shown in Table 
18. 
The resulting 95% CIs using exact (Clopper-Pearson) method under several scenarios of observed ORR 
are provided in  
Assessment report  
EMA/444980/2023 
Page 52/143 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 19, indicating that with 50 subjects and 42% observed ORR, the 95% CI excludes the benchmark 
of 26.4% ORR. With 100 subjects and 36% observed ORR, the 95% CI excludes the benchmark of 26.4% 
ORR. 
With 100 subjects at 5.4 mg/kg and 50 subjects at the 6.4 mg/kg dose level, if the higher dose true ORR 
is at least 12.3% higher than that of the lower dose, the probability of observing the ORR difference 
between dose levels being 5% or more is at least 80%. 
Assuming 100 subjects at 5.4 mg/kg and 50 subjects at the 6.4 mg/kg dose level, the 95% CI of the ORR 
difference between dose levels is expected to extend approximately 16% from the observed difference in 
proportions to either confidence limit.

Randomisation 
Once all screening procedures have been completed and study eligibility has been confirmed, 
approximately 150 subjects were to be enrolled in the study and centrally randomized in a 2:1 ratio to 
receive trastuzumab deruxtecan at a dose of either 5.4 mg/kg or 6.4 mg/kg. Randomization was stratified 
by history of prior treatment with anti-PD 1 and/or anti-PD-L1 (yes, no).  
Randomization was to be managed through an Interactive Response Technology (IRT) for subjects 
meeting all eligibility criteria.  
After randomization, the first dose of study treatment should occur as soon as possible and no more than 
7 days after the randomization date. 
Subjects who have dropped out were not to be replaced. 
Blinding (masking) 
The treatment assignment was to remain blinded to study subjects, Investigators, study site personnel 
(except the unblinded pharmacist and other unblinded staff members as deemed necessary for site 
operations to maintain the blind), central imaging readers and the ILD Adjudication Committee. The 
Sponsor and the CRO were not blinded to the treatment assignment of subjects. 
The randomization schedule was to be kept securely. 
Statistical methods 
Summary statistics will be presented by treatment group, 5.4 mg/kg and 6.4 mg/kg doses, and overall, 
across all subjects (5.4 and 6.4 mg/kg doses) for safety analysis set and summaries of disposition and 
demographics and baseline characteristics, while it will be presented only by treatment group, 5.4 mg/kg 
and 6.4 mg/kg doses, for full analysis set (FAS), pharmacokinetic analysis set and immunogenicity 
analysis set.  
Assessment of change from baseline to post-treatment or the ratio of post-treatment to baseline will 
include only those subjects with both baseline and post-treatment measurements. The last non-missing 
value of a variable taken before the first dose of the study treatment will be used as the baseline value, 
unless otherwise specified. In general, missing or dropout data will not be imputed for the purpose of 
data analysis, unless otherwise specified. 
In the protocol amendment (Version 3.0 Date 01 DEC 2021), an early cohort of subjects is prespecified 
and defined as those who have been randomized 4.5 months (137 days) before the DCO. If not 
discontinued treatment early, subjects in this pre-specified early cohort should have at least 3 post-
baseline tumour assessments and approximately 4.5-month follow up on safety and efficacy. Statistical 
analyses will be performed on this pre-specified early cohort to provide more robust assessment of 
efficacy and safety. 
At the time of developing the IA SAP was planned to have “at least 75 subjects”, at the DCO of 24 MAR 
2022 82 subjects are included in the pre-specified early cohort. 
Efficacy analyses will be performed on the full analysis set  (~n=150 ) and the pre-specified early cohort 
(~n=100).  Safety analyses will be performed using the safety analysis set and the pre-specified early 
cohort. PK analysis will be based on the PK analysis set and the pre-specified early cohort. In general, the 
pre-specified early cohort will be analysed within each full analysis set, safety analysis set, and PK 
Assessment report  
EMA/444980/2023

analysis set unless otherwise specified. All other exploratory analyses will be performed based on the full 
analysis set and safety analysis set. 
Analysis sets 
Full analysis set: The full analysis set (FAS) will include all subjects randomized into the study. The full 
analysis set will be the primary analysis set for all efficacy analysis. Following the intent-to-treat principle, 
subjects will be analysed according to the treatments and strata they were assigned at randomization. 
Safety Analysis Set: The safety analysis set will include all randomized subjects who received at least 1 
dose of study treatment. Subjects will be summarized according to the treatment actually received. 
Response Evaluable Set: Not Applicable to the interim analysis. 
Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set: The PK analysis set will include all subjects who received at least 1 dose of 
T-DXd and had any measurable post-dose serum concentrations of T-DXd, total anti-HER2 antibody, and 
MAAA-1181a. 
Immunogenicity (ADA and NAb) Analysis Set: The Immunogenicity analysis set will include all subjects 
who received at least one dose of the study drug and who had at least one baseline or post baseline 
immunogenicity assessment.  
Prespecified early Cohort Analysis Set: The pre-specified early cohort analysis set within the FAS will 
include all subjects who have been randomized 4.5 months (137 days) before the DCO. The pre-specified 
early cohort analysis set within the safety analysis set will include all subjects who have been randomized 
4.5 months (137 days) before the DCO and received at least 1 dose of study treatment. The pre-specified 
early cohort analysis set within the PK analysis set will include all subjects who received at least 1 dose of 
T-DXd and had any measurable post-dose serum concentrations of T-DXd, total anti-HER2 antibody, and 
MAAA 1181a. 
Multiple comparisons/multiplicity 
The evaluation of the study results at DCOs for both IAs and primary analysis will be based primarily on 
point estimation and 95% CI. For both IAs, there is no plan to stop the trial in response to the efficacy 
results. Hence, multiplicity adjustment is not applicable. 
Interim analyses and data monitoring 
Two IAs are planned for this study. The first IA will be performed when a total of at least 75 subjects 
have been randomized to receive a dose of trastuzumab deruxtecan (5.4 mg/kg or 6.4 mg/kg) and have 
had at least 4.5 months of follow-up before the DCO or have discontinued treatment. This dataset will be 
named “Pre-Specified Early Cohort”. 
The main purpose of the interim analyses (IA) was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of each dose 
without the intent to modify the study design and study conduct. There was no plan for stopping the trial 
for efficacy. The evaluation of the study results will be based primarily on point estimation and 95% CI. 
Hence, futility and efficacy stopping boundaries are not defined for both IAs. A PK assessment will also be 
performed. Additionally, exposure-response analyses (ER) for key efficacy and safety endpoints may be 
performed at the time of these IAs. 
For each dose, the primary efficacy endpoint of confirmed ORR by BICR will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics including 2-sided exact 95% CI (Clopper-Pearson). Other efficacy endpoints based 
on response rates will be summarized by dose level using the same methodology as the primary efficacy 
endpoint. For time-to-event endpoints such as DoR, Kaplan-Meier (K-M) estimates of median and their 
corresponding 95% CIs using Brookmeyer and Crowley method will be provided. Safety data related to 
AEs will be summarized using descriptive statistics. For the first and second IAs, in addition to analysing 
Assessment report  
EMA/444980/2023 
Page 55/143 
 
 
 
 
and presenting the FAS for efficacy and SAS for safety with respect to both DCO dates, data from the 
subset of subjects who were randomized at least 4.5 months before the DCO will also be analysed and 
presented to allow for a more robust assessment of the efficacy and safety data from this pre-defined 
subset. 
Efficacy analyses 
Efficacy analyses will be performed for the FAS and the pre-specified early cohort analysis set within the 
FAS. Point estimates will be accompanied with 2-sided 95% CIs, unless specified otherwise. 
Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint – cORR:  
Primary Analysis: The primary efficacy endpoint is confirmed ORR, defined as the sum of CR and PR rate, 
assessed by the BICR based on RECIST version 1.1. The best overall response of CR/PR cannot be 
determined unless it is confirmed, no earlier than 4 weeks (28 days) from the time a response of CR/PR is 
first suspected.  
The primary analysis of ORR will be performed for FAS. The ORR for each dose level will be estimated 
along with the two-sided Clopper-Pearson 95% CIs. A swimmer plot for response over time will be also 
prepared. 
The ORR difference between dose levels will be estimated and provided with 95% CI using a stratified 
analysis for prior anti PD-1/PD-L1 treatment, where the strata-adjusted ORR difference is computed, and 
each stratum is weighted according to the inverse of variance, which is the reciprocals of the variances of 
the stratum-specific differences. This inverse of variance weighting strategy assigns a larger weight to 
strata in which treatment differences have been estimated with greater precision, and they yield an 
estimate of ORR difference that has minimum variance. Note that the randomization stratification factor 
(prior treatment of anti PD-1/PD-L1 or not) as recorded in IRT will be used for the stratified analysis. 
Analysis of the Secondary Efficacy Endpoint – DOR: 
Duration of response is defined as the time from date of initial response (CR or PR) to the date of disease 
progression or death due to any cause for subjects with a confirmed CR or PR. DoR based on BICR will be 
summarized with median duration and its two-sided 95% CI for the median using Brookmeyer and 
Crowley method for each treatment group. Kaplan-Meier estimates of the distribution of DoR will be 
calculated and presented graphically by treatment group. The censoring rules are described in the 
following table: 
Assessment report  
EMA/444980/2023 
Page 56/143 
 
 
 
 
DoR will be calculated only for subjects with a best overall response of CR or PR. The same analysis will 
be performed for DoR based on investigator assessment. 
Changes to the statistical analyses specified in protocol 
Changes in the planned analyses are described below. 
•  The imputation rules for incomplete date of prior medications described in Section 8.3.3.2 of the IA 
SAP (v1.0, 17 Feb 2022) were not followed during the execution of the analyses. Instead, the T-DXd 
program convention was followed, and the imputation rules described in Section 8.3.3.3 of the IA SAP 
(v1.0, 17 Feb 2022) were Interim Analysis 1 Study Report DS8201-A-U206 used to impute the 
incomplete date of prior medication. The incomplete dates were not imputed for post anticancer 
therapies. 
•  To follow T-DXd program convention, the derivation of Number of Lines of Prior Systemic Therapy for 
Advanced/Metastatic Disease (≤2, >2) included the following: 
o  Therapies intended for “Locally Advanced” or “Metastatic” or “Other” (palliative) 
Assessment report  
EMA/444980/2023 
Page 57/143

•  The number and percentage of subjects who were positive for neutralizing antibody (NAb) of T-DXd 
were not summarized due to delay in receiving the NAb data. 
Results 
The interim analysis (IA) was conducted after at least 75 subjects had been randomised to receive at 
least 1 dose and had at least 4.5 months of follow-up before the IA DCO. The DCO for the IA was 24-
MAR-2022.  
According to the protocol, the primary analysis (PA) occurred 9 months after the last subject was 
randomized and treated as per protocol, with a DCO on 23-DEC-2022. The timing of the DCO was driven 
by when the primary endpoint, confirmed ORR by BICR, was considered mature. 
Only results from the primary analysis are presented in this report. 
Participant flow 
As of the DCO date, 152 subjects (T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg: 102 subjects; T-DXd 6.4 mg/kg: 50 subjects) were 
randomized and 151 subjects received treatment with T-DXd. One subject discontinued from the study 
before starting treatment with T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg due to a SARSCoV-2 infection. As of the DCO, the 
majority of subjects in both dose groups had discontinued study drug (T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg: 74/102 [73.3%] 
subjects; T-DXd 6.4 mg/kg: 36/50 [72.0%] subjects). Overall, 27.2% of subjects were still receiving 
study drug (T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg: 27/102 [26.7%] subjects; T-DXd 6.4 mg/kg: 14/50 [28.0%] subjects). 
The disposition of subjects is summarised in Table 20.

Recruitment 
The first subject was randomized on 19 Mar 2021. Enrolment in this study was completed on 24 Mar 
2022. The study recruited patients in 47 sites from USA, Canada, Netherlands, France, Spain, Italy, 
Australia, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. 
At DCO (23-DEC-2022), median follow-up was 11.6 months for the 152 enrolled patients.  
Conduct of the study 
Changes in the Conduct of the Study 
Changes in the conduct of the study were documented in a protocol amendment. Written approval of all 
protocol amendments was obtained from the IRB or IEC. The study was initiated from Amendment 1 
(Protocol v2.0). 
Amendment 1 (Protocol v2.0) - 22 October 2020 
The primary changes made by Amendment 1 were as follows: 
•  Updated protocol design, increasing the sample size from 100 to 150 subjects in total to better 
characterize the efficacy and safety profiles of the 5.4 mg/kg dose group, with a focus on subjects who 
had disease recurrence or progression during/after at least one regimen of prior platinum-based 
anticancer therapy. 
•  An estimate of the number of sites was provided. 
•  Blinding procedures were described. 
•  The time frame of the study was increased from approximately 7.5 to at least 9 months after the last 
subject was randomized. The anticipated total duration of the study was increased from 25 to 31 
months. 
•  The description of the stratified subgroups was updated. 
•  The schedule for the HEOR assessments was updated. 
•  Bone scan was added to the list of “Treatment response/disease assessments.” 
•  Enhanced data collection for ILD adjudication was guided by a set of pre-defined list of PTs as per the 
Event Adjudication Site Manual. 
•  Updated several sections to align with the updated study design and latest safety information. 
•  Subjects having first, second-line, and later therapies were removed from the list of subgroups for the 
exploratory analyses. 
•  Statistical analysis to assess the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection (ie, COVID-19) was added. 
Amendment 2 (Protocol v3.0) - 01 December 2021 
The primary changes made by Amendment 2 were as follows: 
• 
Incorporated interim analyses for early assessment of the efficacy and safety of the 2 doses 
administered in the study. 
•  The primary analysis DCO time frame was updated. 
• 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were updated to provide clarification and align with the latest safety 
information.

•  Efficacy data from an interim analysis of the results of the DS8201-A-U204 study were updated. 
•  Lung cancer of the subject population was specified. 
•  The description of the duration of study administration was updated. 
•  Description of the preparation of the study drug for infusion was updated. 
•  Duration of infusion was adjusted in case of no IRR. For cases of IRR, reference to management 
guidelines was provided. 
•  Hy’s Law text was updated. 
•  The management guidelines for Grades 2, 3, and 4 ILD/pneumonitis were updated. 
•  Exceptions to the prohibited corticosteroids were updated. 
•  The purpose for analyzing banked samples was updated. 
•  The storage and disposal of specimens were updated. 
•  The list of HER2 mutations was updated. 
•  Death resulting from disease progression was removed from the list of events exempted from SAE 
reporting. 
•  The list of prior and concomitant medications relating to SARS-CoV-2 was removed. 
•  SARS-CoV-2 assessment(s) was updated.

DOR sensitivity analysis based on treatment policy estimand  
According to this analysis, all PD/deaths were treated as events, regardless of the intercurrent event, 
such as the start of new anticancer therapy.  
For responders without PD/death, DoR was censored at the last tumour assessment before the first new 
anticancer therapy if the subject received new anticancer therapy after T-DXd or censored at the last 
tumour assessment if the subject did not. 
Median DoR was 11.9 months (95% CI: 5.8, NE) in 50 responders in the T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg group and NE 
(95% CI: 8.3, NE) in 28 responders in the T-DXd 6.4 mg/kg group.

Note: The analysis was based on a treatment policy estimand strategy. All PD/Deaths are treated as events. For responders without 
PD/Death, DoR is censored at the last tumour assessment before the first new anti-cancer therapy started if the subject had post-T-
DXd-treatment new anti-cancer therapy and the last tumour assessment if otherwise. PD was assessed by independent central review 
using RECIST version 1.1.

DOR sensitivity analysis based on a composite estimand strategy  
According to this analysis, all PD/deaths were treated as events. 
For responders without PD/death, the date of start of a new anticancer therapy or of discontinuation from 
study drug was used as the event date for determining the end of DoR. 
For other responders with ongoing T-DXd treatment, DoR was censored at the last tumour assessment. 
Median DoR was 7.1 months (95% CI: 5.7, 11.9) in 50 responders in the T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg group and 8.1 
months (95% CI: 5.1, NE) in 28 responders in the T-DXd 6.4 mg/kg group.

Note: The analysis was based on any deaths or PD after the last dose was counted as an event (i.e., a treatment policy strategy) and a 
composite estimand strategy was applied for the use of new anticancer therapy or discontinuation. All PD/Deaths are treated as events. 
For responders without PD/Death, if the subject started new anti-cancer therapy or discontinued from study treatment, the date was 
used as the DoR event date. For other responders who have ongoing T-DXd treatment, DoR is censored at the last tumour assessment. 
PD was assessed by BICR using RECIST version 1.1.

DOR sensitivity analysis combining the BICR and investigator assessments. 
According to this analysis, the earliest of the PD event dates between the BICR and investigator 
assessments was taken as DoR event date if at least 1 assessment resulted in an event. 
If an event of PD, either by BICR or by investigator assessment, occurred on/after the start date of DoR, 
the earlier PD date between the BICR and investigator assessment was taken into account to determine 
the end of DoR Otherwise, DoR was the same as DoR by BICR.  
Median DoR was 8.7 months (95% CI: 5.7, 16.8) in 50 responders in the T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg group and NE 
(95% CI: 6.8, NE) in 28 responders in the T-DXd 6.4 mg/kg group.

In vitro biomarker test for patient selection for efficacy 
Subjects enrolled in Study U206 and randomized to the T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg group with available archival 
and/or freshly collected tumor tissue processed into formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples 
were tested retrospectively at a central laboratory with the to-be-marketed companion diagnostic 
Oncomine™ Dx Target Test (hereafter referred to as ODxTT).  ODxTT is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic 
that uses targeted, high throughput, parallel sequencing technology to detect HER2 SNVs and exon 20 
insertions for Enhertu NSCLC indication in nucleic acid isolated from FFPE tumor tissue specimens using a 
reference hotspot file.  The clinical validity of ODxTT was assessed by evaluating the concordance 
between the results obtained with ODxTT and the results obtained with the local assays used for the 
enrollment in Study U206. 
In vitro biomarker test for patient selection for efficacy: Out of 102 samples (deemed to be HER2-mutant 
positive by local assays) corresponding to the patients randomised to arm 5.4 mg/kg of trial U206, 29 
were deemed insufficient for central testing using the to-be marketed CDx (Oncomine Dx Target Test, aka 
ODxTT). From the remaining 73 samples which were tested, 59 were positive, 2 were negative and 12 
were labelled as “unknown”. While the MAH claims for concordant results between local assays and 
ODxTT based on the positive (59/61) and negative (107/117) samples, it is noted that ~12% (22/190) of 
the samples tested with ODxTT corresponded to the “unknown” category, which could become an 
important proportion for the commercial application of this CDx. Upon these limited sample of centrally 
confirmed samples, concordance cannot be claimed. 
Supportive studies 
Study J101: 
Study J101 was a Phase 1, multicenter, 2-part (dose escalation followed by dose expansion), open-label, 
nonrandomized, multiple-dose, first-in-human study of T-DXd in subjects with advanced solid tumors with 
HER2 expression or mutations refractory to standard treatments or for which no standard treatments 
were available, with study sites in Japan and the US (see study design in Figure 23).

Figure 23: Study J101 Design 
Dose Escalation (Part 1, 27 subjects enrolled) was intended to identify the maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD) or the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of T-DXd.  Part 1 consisted of modified continuous 
reassessment method with escalation with overdose control design and included at least 3 subjects 
evaluable for assessment of dose-limiting toxicity per dose level (ie, 0.8, 1.6, 3.2, 5.4, 6.4, and 
8.0 mg/kg). 
Dose Expansion (Part 2, 265 subjects enrolled) was intended to further assess the safety, tolerability, 
and efficacy of T-DXd at the MTD/RP2D (5.4 mg/kg and 6.4 mg/kg) and was conducted in 5 cohorts of 
subjects. 
The submitted SCE presented efficacy data from 11 subjects with NSCLC whose tumors had a HER2 
mutation and who were treated with T-DXd 6.4 mg/kg from Part 2d of Study J101. 
Results 
Of the 11 subjects with HER2-mutant NSCLC from Part 2d, 8 (72.7%) subjects were female and 7 
(63.6%) subjects were <65 years of age.  Seven (63.6%) of the 11 subjects were White.  The majority of 
subjects (72.7%) had an ECOG PS of 1 at baseline and had received >2 lines of prior systemic therapy 
for advanced/metastatic disease (81.8%). Among these subjects, specific mutations included:  8 (72.7%) 
subjects with a kinase domain mutation; 1 (9.1%) subject with an extracellular domain mutation; 2 
(18.2%) subjects with a transmembrane domain mutation. 
At DCO on 01-AUG-2019, for the 11 subjects with HER2-mutant NSCLC from Part 2d, a confirmed ORR by 
ICR was achieved in 8 (72.7%) subjects (95% CI: 39.0, 94.0), with all 8 (72.7%) subjects achieving 
confirmed PR.  The median DoR by ICR was 9.9 months (95% CI: 6.9, NE), and the median PFS by ICR 
was 11.3 months (95% CI: 8.2, NE).  Median OS was not estimable in these 11 subjects, with 7 (63.6%) 
subjects censored at the time of DCO. 
Study U204: 
Study U204 was a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter, 2-cohort study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
T-DXd in subjects with HER2-overexpressing (ie, IHC 3+ or IHC 2+) or HER2-mutant (defined as a known

documented activating HER2 mutation) NSCLC. To be enrolled in Study U204, subjects had to have 
pathologically documented unresectable and/or metastatic NSCLC that was relapsed from or was 
refractory to standard treatment or for which no standard treatment was available. Subjects had at least 
1 measurable lesion assessed by the investigator based on RECIST v1.1, had an ECOG PS of 0 to 1, and 
were willing and able to comply with protocol visits and procedures. The study was conducted in North 
America, Japan, and Europe, with a planned sample size of approximately 170 subjects.  Study design is 
provided in Figure 24. 
Figure 24: Study U204 (DESTINY-Lung01) Design 
A total of 181 subjects were enrolled in the study: 49 subjects in Cohort 1, 41 subjects in Cohort 1a, and 
91 subjects in Cohort 2. The submitted SCE presents results from the HER2-mutant NSCLC subjects 
treated with T-DXd 6.4 mg/kg Q3W from Cohort 2.   
The primary efficacy endpoint was confirmed ORR assessed by ICR.  The primary analysis was to be 
performed when subjects in Cohort 2 had a minimum of 6 months follow-up past onset of response for all 
subjects who had a response by ICR.  Of note, 1 subject was a late responder and did not have a 
minimum follow-up duration of 6 months after the onset of response. 
No IA was planned in the original protocol.  Three IAs were conducted to guide the future strategy for 
T-DXd in this population.   
Results 
In Cohort 2, the FAS (all enrolled subjects) included 91 subjects.  All enrolled subjects received at least 1 
dose of study drug.  At the 03 Dec 2021 DCO, the median duration of follow-up was 16.7 months (range: 
0.7 to 36.9), and 11 (12.1%) subjects were ongoing on treatment.  A total of 80 (87.9%) subjects 
discontinued treatment, with the 2 most common reasons for discontinuation being PD (37 [40.7%] 
subjects) and adverse event (AE) (28 [30.8%] subjects).  
The majority (65.9%) of the subjects were female (34.1% were male) and the median age was 
60.0 years (range: 29 to 88).  Forty (44.0%) subjects were White, and 31 (34.1%) subjects were Asian.  
For 20 (22.2%) subjects, race was reported as “Other”.  The median body mass index was 22.5 kg/m2 
(range: 15.3 to 38.8).  All enrolled subjects in Cohort 2 had an activating HER2 (ERBB2) mutation.  At 
baseline (based on the FAS), 33.0% of subjects had >2 lines of prior systemic therapy for 
advanced/metastatic disease and 65.9% had prior treatment with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor.  Thirty-
three (36.3%) subjects had a history of central nervous system (CNS) metastasis, 20 (22.0%) subjects 
had a history of pneumonectomy, and 7 (7.7%) subjects had a history of pleural effusion.  The specific 
mutations in Cohort 2 included: 85 (93.4%) subjects with a kinase domain mutation; 6 (6.6%) subjects 
with an extracellular domain mutation; none of the subjects had a transmembrane domain mutation.

At DCO 03-DEC-2021, in subjects with HER2-mutant NSCLC (Cohort 2), the primary efficacy endpoint of 
ORR by ICR was achieved in 54.9% (50/91 subjects; 95% CI: 44.2, 65.4), with 1 (1.1%) subject 
achieving confirmed CR and 49 (53.8%) achieving confirmed PR.  The ORR by investigator assessment 
was achieved in 61.5% (56/91 subjects), with 3 (3.3%) subjects achieving confirmed CR and 53 (58.2%) 
achieving confirmed PR. 
The median DoR based on ICR was 10.6 months (95% CI: 5.8, 17.7), 21 of 50 (42.0%) subjects were 
censored for the DoR analysis, including 8 of 50 (16.0%) subjects who were ongoing without an event.  
Of the 50 subjects with confirmed CR or PR, 26 (52.0%) subjects maintained a response with the 
observed DoR at ≥6 months and 17 (34.0%) subjects maintained a response with the observed DoR at 
≥12 months. 
The median PFS by ICR was 8.3 months (95% CI: 6.0, 11.9) and the median OS estimated by 
Kaplan-Meier method was 18.6 months (95% CI: 13.8, 25.8).  The estimated 6-month and 12-month OS 
rates were 83.3% and 68.8%, respectively. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
This application is to extend the indication of Enhertu (trastuzumab deruxtecan, T-DXd) to include the 
treatment of unresectable or metastatic HER2-mutant NSCLC in patients who have received prior 
systemic therapy. The intended posology for this indication (5.4 mg/kg) is based on the primary analysis 
of ORR from phase II trial U206. Results from similar patient cohorts treated with T-DXd at 6.4 mg/kg 
from trials J101 and U204 were submitted as supportive evidence of efficacy. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study U206 is an ongoing partially blinded phase 2 study that randomised patients from the targeted 
population to T-DXd at 5.4 mg/kg or 6.4 mg/kg in a 2:1 ratio. The overall design of this trial is followed, 
noting that the two arms were different posologies of T-DXd, hence uncontrolled. Of note, both patients 
and investigators knew about treatment with T-DXd, the blinded portion was the dose. The rationale for 
randomisation is followed: Phase I J101 identified the two potential RP2D for T-DXd (5.4 and 6.4 mg/kg 
Q3W), and these were investigated in NSCLC patients in phase II U204, albeit the 5.4 mg/kg dose was 
only investigated in HER2-overexpressing patients. The paucity of data on Enhertu 5.4 mg/kg in HER2-
mutant NSCLC patients prompted evaluation of this dose in another phase II trial, namely U206. Since no 
statistical hypothesis testing between both arms of U206 was considered and the dose proposed for 
marketing is 5.4 mg/kg, the assessment of efficacy results from this trial focuses on the T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg 
arm from U206. The study planned to randomise ~100 patients to the 5.4 mg/kg arm and ~50 to the 6.4 
mg/kg arm.  
The main limitation of the trial derives from its uncontrolled nature, hampering the ability to draw 
conclusions on clinical benefit in terms of the time-to-event endpoints PFS and OS. Further, the lack of a 
standard-of-care (SoC) control arm also results in uncertainty on the observed treatment effect as patient 
selection may have occurred, though in general, patients with HER2-mutant NSCLC seem to have a 
poorer prognosis than patients with non-oncogene-addicted NSCLC.  
Results from the primary analysis, which occurred 9 months after the last subject was randomised and 
treated as per protocol, are presented and discussed in this report. The timing of the DCO (23-DEC-2022) 
was dependent on maturity of primary endpoint (confirmed ORR by BICR). This is endorsed since these 
results provide sufficiently mature of treatment effect from T‑DXd 5.4 mg/kg in subjects with advanced 
HER2-mutant NSCLC.

Study participants: Patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumours presented activating HER2 mutations 
documented in tissue via NGS, PCR or mass spectrometry (among others) in local laboratories could be 
enrolled in the trial. Central confirmation for the presence of such mutation was carried on some of the 
samples from the recruited patients, but since no conclusions of concordance can be drawn upon these 
limited data, the related SmPC statement on central confirmation of the biomarker has been removed 
(see further data on the concordance study below).  
Inclusion of patients who had discontinued previous treatment because of toxicity (in addition to those 
who had discontinued because of progression) was added as of protocol V3, while recruitment was 
ongoing. 
To appropriately reflect the inclusion/exclusion criteria from the targeted population, in particular in 
consideration of prior treatments (disease recurrence or progression during or after at least 1 regimen of 
prior anti-cancer therapy that must have contained platinum-based chemotherapy), and to align with 
similar indications in the oncogene-addicted NSCLC field, the MAH was requested to modify the originally 
sought therapeutic indication in section 4.1 of the SmPC. The following wording was agreed to better 
represent the population intended for treatment: Enhertu as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment 
of adult patients with advanced NSCLC whose tumours have an activating HER2 (ERBB2) mutation and 
who require systemic therapy following platinum-based chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy 
The term “advanced” in therapeutic indications for oncogene-addicted NSCLC is understood to encompass 
patients with metastatic (stage IV) disease and locally advanced unresectable disease (i.e., stage 
IIIA/B/C) that for diverse reasons cannot receive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (1L approach) or have 
already received it and present locoregional –i.e., non-metastatic– progression (such as in this 2L+ 
setting), and would then be approached with systemic therapy as if metastatic. Acknowledging that 
performing a specific trial in such rare subgroup of incurable patients would face recruitment issues and 
would thus likely be unfeasible, and expecting similar benefits as their metastatic counterparts on account 
of the predictive potential from the biomarker, this extrapolation of benefit has been allowed in this 
specific oncogene-addicted setting for multiple products. 
Treatments: The T-DXd schemes as proposed (5.4 or 6.4 mg/kg Q3W) in U206 were based on results 
from studies J101 and U204. Dose reduction schedule and dose modification approach for the dose 
intended for marketing in advanced HER2-mutant NSCLC (5.4 mg/kg Q3W) are appropriately described in 
section 4.2 of the SmPC. Duration of treatment (until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity) is also 
adequately described in sections 4.2 and 5.1. 
Objectives/endpoints: The primary objective of U206 was to evaluate the antitumour activity of T-DXd as 
measured per confirmed ORR assessed by BICR. Assessment of images by blinded review partly mitigates 
the open-label nature of the trial, but concordance with investigator assessment is expected. Duration of 
response (DOR) was a secondary objective. Both ORR and DOR are considered appropriate endpoints to 
evaluate efficacy in this rare oncogene-addicted NSCLC setting, since spontaneous regression is not 
anticipated. However, considering the limitations from these endpoints, the results should be outstanding 
in relation to what can be achieved with approved existing therapeutic options.  
Statistical methods: The differences in the IA SAP and main study SAP do not affect the calculations for 
the primary endpoints. The amended version of the main study SAP (V2, 13-FEB-2023) correctly defines 
the efficacy dataset as patients from the ITT, in comparison to the “Response Evaluable Set” (patients 
with measurable disease at baseline), as the previous version declared.  
The MAH has reasonably demonstrated that no actions were taken on the final SAP based on the interim 
analysis. A series of sensitivity analyses on DOR were requested and their results are discussed under the 
results section. Regarding sample size, the choice of benchmark (ORR 26.4%), albeit stemming from an 
unselected (oncogene-agnostic) 2L+ NSCLC population, is regarded as relevant for the indication 
Assessment report  
EMA/444980/2023 
Page 91/143 
 
 
 
 
pursued, noting a similar approach in other trials for advanced oncogene-addicted NSCLC in the 2L+ 
setting.  
Recruitment and participant flow: Between March 2021 and March 2022 the trial completed recruitment 
(N=152), and data on ORR and DOR have been submitted with a DCO of 23-DEC-2022, which is 
considered sufficient follow-up to assess and confirm response. As expected in this advanced 2L+ NSCLC 
setting, about half the patients had discontinued treatment because of progressive disease. Of note, 
about a quarter of patients (27 out of 110 = 24.5%) discontinued treatment because of adverse events, 
with a slight predominance in the 6.4 mg/kg arm. 81% (50 out of 61) of patients who discontinued the 
study had died, whereas the rest withdrew voluntarily. 12 patients did not fulfil eligibility criteria and were 
registered as major protocol deviations. 
Baseline data: HER2-mutant NSCLC is rare and predominantly occurs in a relatively younger, female 
predominant and non-smoker population, in nearly all cases with tumours of adenocarcinoma histology. 
In U206, the recruited population across arms corresponds to most expectations (median age 60 years, 
65% women, 99% adenocarcinoma), albeit the proportion of former smokers (45%) was higher than 
anticipated. Of note, about two thirds of patients were recruited in Asia. Regarding specific disease 
characteristics, HER2 mutations occurred in the kinase domain and in exons 19/20 in nearly all patients. 
Two thirds of the patients had received 1 prior systemic treatment for advanced disease (2L setting) and 
the remaining, two or more lines (3L+ setting). All patients had received prior platinum-based treatment, 
75% of patients had received prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy and 31% prior docetaxel. 37.5% of patients 
had a history of brain metastases at the time of enrolment. The reason for discontinuation of most recent 
prior therapy in 76% of patients was disease progression, while 5% had discontinued because of adverse 
events, and the rest for other reasons.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
At the final analysis (DCO 23-DEC.2022) and with median follow-up of 11.6 months for the ITT population 
(N=152), confirmed ORR as assessed by BICR was 49% in the T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg arm and 56% in the 6.4 
mg/kg arm. Most of the responses were partial in nature. 5 subjects were considered non-evaluable (3 in 
the 5.4 mg/kg arm and 2 in the 6.4 mg/kg arm) because they discontinued T-DXd before the first post-
baseline assessment, and there were no tumour scans after study treatment initiation. In any case, these 
patients are considered as non-responders. Median DoR was ~17 months for the 50 responders in the 5.4 
mg/kg arm and it was not reached in the 6.4 mg/kg arm.  
To understand the clinical background for this specific disease, it is noted that experience with other 
therapies in HER2-mutant NSCLC is limited and none of the HER2-directed products has a specific 
indication for lung cancer, even if several prospective trials showed a degree of antidisease activity: ORR 
44% for T-DM1 (n=18, Li et al JCO 2018) and 29% for trastuzumab + pertuzumab + docetaxel (n=65, 
Mazieres et al JCO 2022).  
Subgroup analysis of ORR-BICR in the 5.4 mg/kg arm does not show specific trends, noting similar 
response rates across diverse categories of age, gender, smoking status, race, presence of CNS 
metastases, region of the world and HER2 mutations. Noticeably, ORR was slightly higher in patients with 
CNS metastases (ORR 60%), than those without (ORR 43%). Although similar results were observed in 
arm 6.4 mg/kg, the smaller size of the subgroups seems to cause higher variability. Concerning patients 
with baseline CNS metastases, CNS response (as per brain imaging) was not systematically collected in 
the pivotal trial. Regarding asian and non-asian patients, ORR seems comparable across arms, although 
slight differences were observed for DOR. However, considering the small number of patients, results 
must be interpreted with caution. 
Assessment report  
EMA/444980/2023 
Page 92/143 
 
 
 
 
Sensitivity analyses: ORR by investigator (INV) was numerically lower at 42%, noting concordance INV-
BICR rate at ~80% for both 5.4 and 6.4 mg/kg arms. All the requested sensitivity analyses on DOR 
(treatment policy estimand, alternative censoring rules, combination of BICR and investigator 
assessments) resulted in a shorter mDOR, ranging from 7.1 to 11.9 months. It is, therefore, considered 
plausible that censoring for anticancer therapy and missed assessments resulted in an upward bias 
(overestimation) of the mDOR in the 5.4 mg/kg arm and that the median DoR is somewhere between 8 
and 12 months, rather than the originally estimated 16.8 months. 
Supportive results: Response rates in the T-DXd 6.4 mg/kg cohorts across trials U206, J101 and U204 
are comparable to ORR in the pivotal 5.4 mg/kg cohort from U206. Of note, confirmed ORR by ICR in the 
6.4 mg/kg pool (53.4%, 70 responders from 130 patients) is identical to that of the 5.4 mg/kg cohort. 
Responses in the 6.4 mg/kg cohorts seem durable, approaching 10 months in median. 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional marketing 
authorisation  
Although response rate and duration of responses for T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg in advanced HER2-mutant NSCLC 
2L+ from the uncontrolled study U206 are regarded as promising and have been confirmed with updated 
results, these endpoints are not surrogate endpoints for OS and PFS in HER2-mutant NSCLC, and thus 
the totality of currently available data are not considered comprehensive enough for a full approval in the 
new intended indication. The MAH will submit the results of Study DESTINY-Lung04 (a phase 3, open-
label, randomised, controlled trial of T-DXd vs. standard-of-care immunochemotherapy in the first line 
treatment of patients with advanced HER2-mutant NSCLC) as a new specific obligation (SOB) by Q4 
2025. The study started in October 2021 and is close to finishing recruitment (252 subjects enrolled up to 
July 2023, out of targeted sample size of 264), and it is therefore realistic that interpretable results of 
time-to-event endpoints in this biomarker-driven population will be eventually provided.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Trastuzumab deruxtecan shows promising activity in terms of response rate in patients with advanced 
HER2-mutant NSCLC, a setting for which no HER2-targeted treatments hold an approved indication. 
Responses seem durable, but could be overestimated, as suggested by additional sensitivity analyses. 
The data supporting this extension of indication come from an uncontrolled trial and are not considered as 
comprehensive. However, the requirements for a conditional marketing authorisation are considered 
fulfilled for this extension of indication (See section on Additional consideration on the benefit-risk 
balance). 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the context 
of a conditional MA: 
In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of Enhertu in the treatment of adult patients with advanced 
NSCLC whose tumours have an activating HER2 (ERBB2) mutation and who require systemic therapy 
following platinum-based chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy, the MAH should submit the 
results of the study DESTINY-Lung04, Open-label, Randomized, Multicenter, Phase 3 Study to Assess the 
Efficacy and Safety of Trastuzumab Deruxtecan as First-line Treatment of Unresectable, Locally 
Advanced, or Metastatic NSCLC Harboring HER2 Exon 19 or 20 Mutations.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Enhertu (T-DXd) as monotherapy is currently approved in the EU for advanced HER2+ BC 2L+, advanced 
HER2-low BC after chemotherapy and advanced HER2+ gastric/gastroesophageal cancer after an anti-
HER2-based regimen. 
The safety profile for T-DXd was determined in patients who received at least one dose of Enhertu 5.4 
mg/kg (n = 573) across multiple tumour types in clinical studies. The median duration of treatment in 
this pool was 11.3 months (range: 0.7 to 37.9 months). 
Safety datasets 
To provide an analysis of the safety profile of T-DXd in HER2-mutant NSCLC, a review of the safety data 
was conducted in NSCLC subjects treated with T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg and 6.4 mg/kg doses from Studies J101, 
U204, and U206. The following pooled data were presented in the SCS: 
•  HER2-mutant NSCLC T-DXd 6.4 mg/kg Pool, which includes 152 subjects with HER2-mutant NSCLC 
treated with T-DXd 6.4 mg/kg in Studies J101 (n = 11), U204 (n = 91), and U206 (n = 50) 
•  NSCLC T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg Pool, which includes 142 subjects with NSCLC (HER2-mutant or 
HER2-overexpressing) treated with T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg in Studies U204 (n = 41), and U206 (n = 101) 
•  NSCLC T-DXd 6.4 mg/kg Pool, which includes 208 subjects with NSCLC (HER2-mutant or HER2-
overexpressing) treated with T-DXd 6.4 mg/kg in Studies J101 (n = 18), U204 (n = 140), and U206 (n 
= 50) 
The applicant has also provided data from 2 safety pools that include subjects from several studies 
irrespective of tumor type.   
•  All Tumor Types T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg Pool, which includes 1045 subjects assigned to T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg 
across all tumor types. This pool included: Study J101: 91 subjects; Study U201: 184 subjects; Study 
U204: 41 subjects; Study U206: 101 subjects; Study U302: 257 subjects; Study U303: 371 subjects. 
•  All Tumor Types T DXd ≥5.4 mg/kg Pool, which includes 1741 subjects assigned to T DXd ≥5.4 mg/kg 
across all tumor types. This pool included: Study J101: 280 subjects; Study J202: 169 subjects; Study 
U201: 253 subjects; Study U204: 181 subjects; Study U205: 79 subjects; Study U206: 151 subjects;

Notable differences in baseline characteristics between the U206 HER2-mutant NSCLC T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg 
group and the All Tumor Types T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg Pool were: 
•  A higher proportion of subjects with ECOG PS of 1 in the U206 HER2-mutant NSCLC T-DXd 5.4 
mg/kg group than in the All Tumor Types T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg Pool: 
- 
- 
ECOG PS of 0: 30/101 (29.7%) subjects vs. 551/1045 (52.7%) subjects

Notes: A TEAE was defined as an AE that occurred, having been absent before the first dose of study drug, or had worsened in severity 
or seriousness after the initiation of the study drug until 47 days (for all studies except Study J101 [28 days]) after the last dose of 
study drug.  SAEs with an onset or worsening 48 days (29 days for Study J101) or more after the last dose of study drug, if considered 
related to the study drug, were also TEAEs.  If relationship was missing, the TEAE was also considered to be related to the study drug. 
If a subject had both missing and non-missing CTCAE grades for a TEAE, the missing CTCAE grade was treated as the lowest 
severity grade.  Percentages were calculated using the number of subjects in each treatment group as the denominator.

A TEAE was defined as an AE that occurred, having been absent before the first dose of study drug, or had worsened in severity or 
seriousness after the initiation of the study drug until 47 days (for all studies except Study J101 [28 days]) after the last dose 
of study drug. 
Common TEAEs were defined as ≥10% of subjects from Study U206 with HER2-mutant NSCLC at T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg. 
If a subject had multiple preferred terms or grouped terms, the subject was counted in each of those different terms. If a subject had 
multiple occurrences of the same grouped term or preferred term, the subject was counted once for that specific term.

If a subject had both missing and non-missing CTCAE grades for a TEAE, the missing CTCAE grade was treated as the lowest

Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) 
At the beginning of the T-DXd clinical program, AESIs included ILD, left ventricular ejection fraction 
(LVEF) decrease, QT prolongation, and IRR.  On 09 Jul 2019, based on the comprehensive review of the 
safety data, and taking into consideration biological plausibility, QT prolongation and IRR were no longer 
considered AESIs for the T-DXd clinical program.  In addition, on 06 Apr 2020, “left ventricular ejection

Notes: Each subject was counted only in 1 of the summary blocks.  For subjects having ILD cases across multiple summary blocks, the 
subject was counted in the block according to the preceding order presented in the table. 
If a subject had multiple ILD events, the CTCAE grade was shown for the event with the worst grade. 
Percentages of ILD grades were calculated using the number of subjects with each treatment group with non-missing 
investigator-reported ILD grade as the denominator. 
This table includes all events that were submitted to the ILD Adjudication Committee for adjudication.

gTreatment of ILD included the antibiotics/steroids used/reported by investigators for subjects with adjudicated drug-related ILD events. 
Adjudicated drug-related ILD includes ILD events that were submitted to the ILD Adjudication Committee for adjudication and 
adjudicated as both ILD and related to T-DXd by the ILD Adjudication Committee; adjudicated drug-related ILD was summarized based 
on the ILD adjudicated outcomes (CTCAE grade, drug-related) by the ILD Adjudication Committee. 
Percentages were calculated using the number of subjects with any event adjudicated as drug-related ILD as the denominator.

Study U303. (U206 DCO 23 Dec 2022) 
Left ventricular dysfunction 
The MAH reviewed the selected PTs in the AESI of LV dysfunction to determine whether the event was 
related to LVEF decrease per echocardiogram (ECHO)/multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan. 
In the U206 HER2 mutant NSCLC T DXd 5.4 mg/kg group, 1/101 (1.0%) subject reported TEAEs 
indicating LV dysfunction.  Among the relevant PTs included in the case definition of LV dysfunction (Table 
53), only the PT of ejection fraction decreased was reported.  A brief narrative of this case is presented 
below: 
•  A middle-aged male treated with T DXd 5.4 mg/kg in Study U206, had a nonserious Grade 1 
event of ejection fraction decreased on Day 42 of the study that was considered not related to the 
study drug by the investigator.  The study drug was interrupted and the outcome was not 
recovered at the time of the DCO. 
On 06 Apr 2020, “left ventricular ejection fraction decreased” was renamed to “left ventricular (LV) 
dysfunction” to reflect that this is a clinical concept rather than a laboratory finding.

f Non-missing n was the number of subjects with post-baseline non-missing data. Percentages were calculated using the non-
missing n as the denominator. 
g ≥90% baseline since worst grade was defined as the highest post-baseline LVEF after the measurement with worst grade that was 
≥90% of the baseline LVEF value. 
h Percentages were calculated using the number of subjects having worst post-baseline value at the specific grade.  If there was no 
LVEF measurements after the worst grade of LVEF, the subject was not included in the denominator. 
Per CTCAE version 5.0, Grade 2 LVEF decrease was defined by a resting ejection fraction of ≥40% to <50% or a 10% to <20% drop 
from baseline.  Grade 3 LVEF decrease was defined by a resting ejection fraction of ≥20% to <40% or a ≥20% drop from baseline.  
Grade 4 LVEF decrease was defined by a resting ejection fraction of <20%.

Combined Elevations of Aminotransferases and Bilirubin 
Two of 99 subjects (2.0%) of the U206 HER2-mutant NSCLC T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg group had post-baseline 
liver function tests that met the biochemical criteria for potential Hy’s Law (ALT or AST ≥3 × upper limit 
of normal [ULN] and TBL ≥2 × ULN) (Table 55). One subject had ongoing Gilbert syndrome and the other 
had elevated ALP at baseline and during T-DXd treatment. 
Results of the liver function tests were similar between the U206 HER2-mutant NSCLC T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg 
group and the All Tumor Types T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg Pool, with the exception of the following notable 
differences: 
•  A lower proportion of subjects with baseline AST ≥ULN in the U206 HER2-mutant NSCLC T-DXd 
5.4 mg/kg group (28/101 [27.7%] subjects) than in the All Tumor Types T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg Pool 
(404/1036 [39.0%] subjects) 
•  A lower proportion of subjects with baseline ALT or AST ≥ULN in the U206 HER2-mutant NSCLC T-
DXd 5.4 mg/kg group (31/101 [30.7%] subjects) than in the All Tumor Types T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg 
Pool (429/1036 [41.4%] subjects) 
A total of 19 of 1036 subjects (1.8%) in the All Tumor Types T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg Pool had post-baseline 
liver function tests that met the biochemical criteria for potential Hy’s Law.

Adverse drug reactions: 
During the assessment period the MAH has provided safety data from further 404 patients included in 
Study U301 and treated with T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg. Study U301 was a Phase 3, randomized, 2-arm, open-
label, multicenter study designed to compare the safety and efficacy of T-DXd vs TPC in HER2positive, 
unresectable and/or metastatic BC subjects who were resistant or refractory to TDM1. The safety data of 
these patients were added to All Tumor Types T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg Pool (N=1449) and presented in the 
SmPC.

ADR = adverse drug reaction; CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0; ILD = interstitial lung disease; MedDRA = 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, version 25.1; PT = preferred term; SAE = serious adverse event; SOC = system organ class; T-DXd = 
trastuzumab deruxtecan. 
For a grouped term, there are multiple PTs, which could be corresponding to different SOCs. The different SOCs were unified to one SOC as 
displayed in this table first, and then the subjects were summarized in that grouped term and that SOC. 
Percentages were calculated using the number of subjects in the Safety Analysis Set as the denominator. 
SOCs and PTs/grouped terms are sorted by descending frequency in all grades in the All Tumor Types T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg Pool column. 
Ejection fraction decreased includes both laboratory parameters of LVEF decrease and AE preferred terms of LVEF. (grouped PT terms for LV 
dysfunction includes PTs of Acute left ventricular failure, Acute right ventricular failure, Cardiac failure, Cardiac failure acute, Cardiac failure chronic, 
Cardiac failure congestive, Chronic left ventricular failure, Chronic right ventricular failure, Ejection fraction decreased, Left ventricular failure, Right 
ventricular failure,

f Grouped terms. 
g Interstitial lung disease includes events that were adjudicated as ILD and considered study drug related by the Adjudication 
Committee (includes cases of potential ILD/pneumonitis, based on MedDRA for the narrow ILD SMQ, selected terms from the broad 
ILD SMQ, and PTs of respiratory failure and acute respiratory failure). 
h These events were not assessed as drug-related ILD. 
A TEAE was defined as an AE that occurred, having been absent before the first dose of study drug, or had worsened in severity or 
seriousness after the initiation of the study drug until 47 days (for all studies except Study J101 [28 days]) after the last dose 
of study drug. 
SAEs with an onset or worsening 48 days (29 days for Study J101) or more after the last dose of study drug, if considered related to 
the study drug, were also TEAEs. 
If a subject had multiple PTs or grouped terms, the subject was counted in each of those terms.  If a subject had multiple occurrences 
of the same grouped PT, the subject was counted once for the specific PT. 
Percentages were calculated using the number of subjects in each treatment group as the denominator. 
Preferred terms/grouped terms were sorted by descending frequency in the U206 HER2 mutant NSCLC T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg column.

One on-treatment death due to an adverse event occurred in study U206: a 73-year-old female treated 
with T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg in Study U206 had a serious TEAE of pneumonitis on Day 42 of the study that was 
considered related to T-DXd by the investigator. This event was adjudicated as not ILD. The subject died 
on Day 44 of the study after receiving the last dose of T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg on Day 24.

A TEAE was defined as an AE that occurred, having been absent before the first dose of study drug, or had worsened in severity or 
seriousness after the initiation of the study drug until 47 days (for all studies except Study J101 [28 days]) after the last dose of 
study drug. 
SAEs with an onset or worsening 48 days (29 days for Study J101) or more after the last dose of study drug, if considered related to 
the study drug, were also TEAEs. 
If a subject had multiple preferred terms or grouped terms, the subject was counted in each of those terms. 
If a subject had multiple occurrences of the same preferred term, the subject was counted once for the specific preferred term. 
Percentages were calculated using the number of subjects in each treatment group as the denominator. 
Preferred terms/grouped terms were sorted by descending frequency in the U206 HER2-mutant NSCLC T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg column. 
Data are included as of data cut-off of 01 Aug 2019 for Study J101, 03 Jun 2020 for Study J202, 08 Jun 2020 for Study U201,

Baseline was defined as the last non-missing value taken before the first dose of study drug. 
Blood chemistry data were graded according to CTCAE Version 5.0 based on laboratory criteria only. 
Percentage was calculated using the number of subjects with both baseline and post-baseline measurements in each treatment group 
as the denominator. 
Data are included as of data cut-off of 01 Aug 2019 for Study J101, 03 Jun 2020 for Study J202, 08 Jun 2020 for Study U201, 03 Dec

QT prolongation: 
At the beginning of the T-DXd clinical program, AESIs included ILD, left ventricular ejection fraction 
(LVEF) decrease, QT prolongation, and IRR. On 09 Jul 2019, based on the comprehensive review of the 
safety data, and taking into consideration biological plausibility, QT prolongation and IRR were no longer 
considered AESIs for the T-DXd clinical program. In addition, on 06 Apr 2020, “left ventricular ejection 
fraction decreased” was renamed to “left ventricular (LV) dysfunction” to reflect that this is a clinical 
concept rather than a laboratory finding.

f To be considered concurrent, abnormalities must have occurred within a 28-day window. 
A subject with multiple occurrences of a new occurring abnormality was counted only once per abnormality. 
Baseline value was defined as the last non-missing value before initial administration of study drug. 
If multiple ECG measurements were taken at the baseline, the average of all baseline values was used as baseline. 
New was defined as an abnormal ECG finding at post-baseline that was not present at baseline. 
Non-missing n was number of subjects with both baseline and post-baseline non-missing data.

A TEAE was defined as an AE that occurred, having been absent before the first dose of study drug, or had worsened in severity or 
seriousness after the initiation of the study drug until 47 days (for all studies except Study J101 [28 days]) after the 
last dose of study drug. 
SAEs with an onset or worsening 48 days (29 days for Study J101) or more after the last dose of study drug, if considered related 
to the study drug, were also TEAEs. 
If relationship was missing, the TEAE was also considered to be related to the study drug. 
If a subject had both missing and non-missing CTCAE grades for a TEAE, the missing CTCAE grade was treated 
as the lowest severity grade. 
If the sample size was too small (<10%) in a subgroup, then that was not included in the table. 
Percentages were calculated using the number of subjects in each treatment group as the denominator. 
Data are included as of data cut-off of 01 Aug 2019 for Study J101, 03 Jun 2020 for Study J202, 08 Jun 2020 for Study U201, 03 Dec

Regardless of subgroup, for most TEAE parameters, there was a lower proportion of subjects with TEAEs 
in the U206 HER2-mutant NSCLC T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg group than in the HER2-mutant NSCLC T-DXd 6.4 
mg/kg Pool. 
The frequency of events in male subjects was similar between the U206 HER2-mutant NSCLC T-DXd 5.4

A TEAE was defined as an AE that occurred, having been absent before the first dose of study drug, or had worsened in severity or 
seriousness after the initiation of the study drug until 47 days (for all studies except Study J101 [28 days]) after the last dose of study 
drug. 
SAEs with an onset or worsening 48 days (29 days for Study J101) or more after the last dose of study drug, if considered related to 
the study drug, were also TEAEs. 
If relationship was missing, the TEAE was also considered to be related to the study drug. 
If a subject had both missing and non-missing CTCAE grades for a TEAE, the missing CTCAE grade was treated as the 
lowest severity grade. 
If the sample size was too small (<10%) in a subgroup, then that was not included in the table. 
Percentages were calculated using the number of subjects in each treatment group as the denominator. 
Data are included as of data cut-off of 01 Aug 2019 for Study J101, 03 Jun 2020 for Study J202, 08 Jun 2020 for Study U201, 03 Dec

T-DXd was first approved in the US on 20 Dec 2019 as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with 
unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive BC who have received 2 or more prior anti-HER2-based 
regimens.   
As of 19 Jun 2022, ENHERTU had been approved in over 40 countries, including in the US and Japan, and 
in the EU for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive BC who had 
received 2 or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens.  ENHERTU is approved in Japan, the US, Israel, and 
Singapore for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive gastric cancer 
who have received a prior anti-HER2 based regimen.  A third indication has been approved in the US for 
the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive BC who have received a 
prior anti HER2-based regimen in either the metastatic setting or in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, 
and have developed disease recurrence during or within 6 months of completing therapy. 
The first 5 Periodic Benefit Risk Evaluation Reports (PBRERs), covering the reporting periods 20 Dec 2019 
through 19 Jun 2020, 20 Jun 2020 through 19 Dec 2020, 20 Dec 2020 through 19 Jun 2021, 20 Jun 2021 
through 19 Dec 2021, and 20 Dec 2021 through 19 Jun 2022 have been previously submitted. 
Spontaneous Events 
According to the cumulative summary tabulations of serious and nonserious adverse reactions from 
post-marketing data (Appendix 3 of the PBRER for reporting period 20 Dec 2021 through 19 Jun 2022), 
there have been 5247 AEs meeting PBRER criteria reported, of which the majority (4181) were 
nonserious.  AESIs from these 5247 AEs are summarized below. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
ILD and LV dysfunction are AESIs for which targeted questionnaires are used for systematic data 
collection.  Additionally, neutropenia including febrile neutropenia is also an important identified risk for 
T-DXd. 
Interstitial Lung Disease 
ILD/Pneumonitis remains an important identified risk for T-DXd and is subject to close monitoring.  The 
following group of MedDRA PTs have been used to define T-DXd-related ILD in the post-marketing 
setting: pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, organising pneumonia, and acute interstitial pneumonitis.  
Further details of identified cases are presented by PBRER period in Table 68

Period in reference to PBRER-period: Q1/Q2: 20.Dec to 19 Jun, Q3/4: 20 Jun to 19 Dec. 
Data Retrieval Date: 17 Jul 2022, MedDRA version 25.0 
The proportion of fatal cases to total ILD post-marketing cases was similar to the one observed in clinical 
studies.  It should be noted that the reporting rate of global ILD cases increased from 2020 Q3/4 and 
peaked in 2021 Q1/2.  In the latest reporting period, there was a slight decrease in global ILD reporting 
rate in comparison to the prior period.  The reporting rate for fatal ILD remains stable for the latest 
reporting period compared to the prior period.  Furthermore, most of ILD cases were reported in Japan 
even though ENHERTU exposure is much higher in the US and Europe than Japan.  There were 2 all-case 
surveys on ILD with ENHERTU treatment conducted in Japan, which could have stimulated the reporting 
of ILD events. 
Overall, evidence from post-marketing spontaneous cases does not alter the risk of ILD/pneumonitis as 
observed in clinical studies. 
Left Ventricular Dysfunction 
For the purposes of post-marketing data collection, a potential LV dysfunction event was defined as any 
of the MedDRA version 25.0 PTs within the narrow scope of the cardiac failure SMQ and the PT of LV 
dysfunction.   
This approach yielded 31 cases cumulatively; 22 reporting ejection fraction (EF) decrease (2 of them 
accompanied by cardiomyopathy and cardiotoxicity, respectively), 7 cardiac failure, 1 pulmonary edema, 
and 1 LV dysfunction were received.  From the overall 31 cases, 13 cases were serious (mainly cases of 
cardiac failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiotoxicity) and 18 cases were non-serious (mainly cases of EF 
decrease).  Cases were often confounded by underlying cardiac/cardiovascular comorbidities and/or 
disease progression.  For 3 cases (2 cardiac failure, 1 EF decrease with pneumonia) a fatal outcome was 
reported.  However, these deaths were associated with progression of the underlying disease. 
When information was provided, EF decrease was reported to be mild including isolated cases with EF 
decrease to 30%.  Dose reduction in line with the scheme provided in T-DXd label or drug withdrawal led 
to improvement of EF decrease, where information was available. 
Overall, the limited evidence from post-marketing cases does not alter the risk of LV dysfunction as 
observed in clinical studies. 
Neutropenia, Including Febrile Neutropenia 
Post-marketing data as well as clinical study data confirm neutropenia as the most frequently reported 
hematologic event, with the majority of patients recovered or were recovering.  Many patients were able 
to continue T-DXd with or without dose reduction or interruption, approximately 22% received G-CSFs as 
treatment.  Febrile neutropenia represents a fraction of below 12% of reported neutropenia cases.  Fatal 
cases were mostly reported in patients developing febrile neutropenia associated with severe infections 
and septic shock or patients experienced neutropenia during treatment but died due to aggravation of the 
primary disease or pulmonary toxicity.  It should be noted that the global reporting rate of neutropenia

cases increased from 2020 Q3/4 and peaked in 2021 Q3/4.  There is no further increase in neutropenia 
reporting rate in the latest PBRER period in comparison to the previous period.  Further details of 
identified cases are presented by PBRER period below.

Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA 
The size of the safety database in HER2-mutant NSCLC (n=101 on 5.4 mg/kg and n=152 on 6.4 
mg/kg) is limited and the lack of a (SoC) control group, hampers the causality assessment and 
contextualization of the safety profile. The results of study DESTINY-Lung04 (SOB) will address these 
uncertainties. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Albeit the most common adverse events patients experience with Enhertu are chemotherapy-like 
(nausea/vomiting, fatigue, alopecia, cytopenias, decreased appetite, constipation, etc.) and thus likely 
related to its cytotoxic component, there are certain HER2-block-related events (e.g., ILD and left 
ventricular dysfunction) which incidence and seriousness require close attention from clinicians. 
To date, most of the clinical experience with T-DXd has been established in patients with HER2-
overexpressing tumours, particularly breast (approved dose 5.4 mg/kg Q3W) and 
gastric/gastroesophageal cancers (approved dose 6.4 mg/kg Q3W). The all tumours 5.4 mg/kg pool 
(N=1449) consists mainly of patients with HER2+ and HER2-low breast cancer (n=883) and HER2-
mutated NSCLC (n=142) treated with Enhertu 5.4 mg/kg Q3W until PD or intolerance. Safety results from 
the 5.4 mg/kg arm from study U206 in HER2-mutated metastatic NSCLC (n=101), for which the 
indication is sought, are crucial to understand the toxic impact of Enhertu in this particular patient 
population: NSCLC is a different oncology entity from the cancer types already indicated for treatment 
with Enhertu, with a specific pattern of pleuropulmonary-related events. Supportive results from trials 
U204 and J101 were also provided to characterise the safety profile of T-DXd in lung cancer. 
Exposure: Safety data have been provided for 1,741 subjects receiving trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) 
≥5.4 mg/kg across eight clinical trials in various solid tumour types, of which 1,045 subjects received 5.4 
mg/kg (safety Pool SmPC). During the assessment period the MAH has provided safety data from further 
404 patients included in Study U301 and treated with T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg. Study U301 was a Phase 3, 
randomized, 2-arm, open-label, multicenter study designed to compare the safety and efficacy of T-DXd 
vs TPC in HER2positive, unresectable and/or metastatic BC subjects who were resistant or refractory to 
TDM1. The safety data of these patients were added to All Tumor Types T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg Pool (nr 1449) 
and presented in the SmPC. but the T-DXd 5.4 mg mg/kg pool assessed in this procedure was still the 
(N=1045). 
Assessment report  
EMA/444980/2023 
Page 131/143 
 
 
 
 
 With the updated data from study U206, the median exposure in the all tumours 5.4 mg/kg pool 
(N=1045) is 9.6 months, whereas for the 5.4 mg/kg safety dataset from U206 (N=101) it is 7.7 months, 
corresponding to a medium number of cycles of 13 and 10, respectively.  
Uncertainty arises from the limited size of the safety database in HER2-mutant NSCLC (n=101 on 5.4 
mg/kg and n=152 on 6.4 mg/kg) and the lack of a (SoC) control group, hampering the causality 
assessment and contextualization of the safety profile. The known safety profile of T-DXd aligns with that 
known for topoisomerase I inhibitors and trastuzumab. The updated data do not raise any new signals in 
the proposed target population compared to the treatment of other solid tumours (mainly 
HER2-overexpressed BC). Overall, the safety database may be considered sufficient to characterize the 
safety profile of T-DXd in the target population with supportive data from other solid tumours for long-
term safety as well as identification of less frequently occurring events. 
The higher dose of 6.4 mg/kg was less tolerable with numerically more Grade≥ 3 AEs (68.4% vs 52.5%), 
and AEs leading to dose discontinuations (32.2% vs. 14.9%) (HER2-mutant NSCLC Pool 6.4 mg/kg). 
These data support the choice of the proposed lower dose of 5.4 mg/kg from a safety perspective. 
Following an updated results from study U206 5.4 mg/kg arm the event rates increased and were similar 
to those observed in the all tumour types pool 5.4 mg/kg.  
Most commonly reported AEs:  
The most common adverse reactions were nausea (75.0%), fatigue (57.3%), vomiting (42.1%), alopecia 
(37.6%), neutropenia (35.2%), constipation (35.0%), anaemia (34.4%), decreased appetite (33.1%), 
diarrhoea (28.8%), transaminases increased (26.5%), musculoskeletal pain (26.2%), thrombocytopenia 
(24.5%) and leukopenia (23.7%). 
The most common Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were neutropenia (17.0%), anaemia (9.5%), fatigue 
(8.4%), leukopenia (6.4%), nausea (5.9%), thrombocytopenia (5.0%), lymphopenia (4.8%), 
hypokalaemia (3.8%), transaminases increased (3.6%), vomiting (2.7%), diarrhoea (2.0%), decreased 
appetite (1.7%), pneumonia (1.4%) and ejection fraction decreased (1.1%). Grade 5 adverse reactions 
occurred in 1.4% of patients, including ILD (1.0%).  
Dose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 34.3% of patients treated with Enhertu. The most 
frequent adverse reactions associated with dose interruption were neutropenia (13.3%), fatigue (5.0%), 
anaemia (4.7%), leukopenia (3.7%), thrombocytopenia (3.0%), upper respiratory tract infection (2.7%) 
and ILD (2.6%). Dose reductions occurred in 20.6% of patients treated with Enhertu. The most frequent 
adverse reactions associated with dose reduction were fatigue (5.0%), nausea (4.9%) neutropenia 
(3.5%) and thrombocytopenia (2.1%). Discontinuation of therapy due to an adverse reaction occurred in 
13.0% of patients treated with Enhertu. The most frequent adverse reaction associated with permanent 
discontinuation was ILD (9.2%). 
Most common ADRs were gastrointestinal (GI) or haematologic in nature, and in line with what is already 
described in the SmPC and known side effects of cytotoxic drugs such as topoisomerase inhibitors.  
The various types of adverse events were generally similar between study 206 (5.4 mg/kg) and the all 
tumours 5.4 mg/kg pool although there was a higher overall SAE frequency in study 206 (5.4 mg/kg).  
Not unexpectedly with the doubling of exposure in study 206 (5.4 mg/kg; 7.7 months) the adverse 
events increased, and particularly neutropenia was higher compared to the all tumours 5.4 mg/kg pool 
(42.6% vs 35.2%).   
With the updated data for study 206 (5.4 mg/kg arm) the frequency of ILD (12.9%) is now in line with 
the all tumours 5.4 mg/kg pool frequency (12.5%). For the HER2-mutated pool with the dose of 6.4 
mg/kg (N=152) a higher frequency (27.0%) of ILD was seen.  
Assessment report  
EMA/444980/2023 
Page 132/143 
 
 
 
 
The profile of LVEF decreases post-baseline was similar for study U206 (5.4 mg/kg) and the All tumours 
5.4 mg/kg Pool. There is no observed dose-response relationship for LVEF decrease.  
No new ADRs have been identified.  
Interactions – extrinsic/intrinsic factors: AEs evaluated for intrinsic factors (age, sex, baseline ECOG PS, 
renal function at baseline, and hepatic function at baseline) did not reveal new safety signals. Tolerability 
appears lower in elderly (subjects ≥65 years of age), as was seen before. AEs evaluated for extrinsic 
factors (country, geographic region, smoking status, prior therapy, and prior pneumonectomy) did not 
reveal new safety signals. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
No new adverse events or any AEs with a clearly higher frequency or severity were identified in HER2-
mutant NSCLC patients (5.4 mg/kg cohort) compared to the all tumours 5.4 mg/kg pool, which mainly 
consists of breast cancer patients. Incidence and severity of AEs is considerably higher in the lung cancer 
pools treated at 6.4 mg/kg, supporting a considerably safer profile at the lower dose. 
The size of the safety database in HER2-mutant NSCLC (n=101 on 5.4 mg/kg and n=152 on 6.4 mg/kg) 
is limited and the lack of a (SoC) control group, hampers the causality assessment and contextualization 
of the safety profile.  
The  safety  profile  of  Enhertu  in  the  treatment  of  patients  with  HER2-mutant  NSCLC  will  be  further 
characterized in the ongoing confirmatory study DESTINY-Lung04 results of which are required as a special 
obligation for this new indication. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 7.0 is acceptable.  
Safety concerns 
There was no new safety concern identified for T-DXd. 
Pharmacovigilance plan 
No new additional pharmacovigilance activities were identified. Routine pharmacovigilance activities 
remain sufficient to mitigate the risks for Enhertu in all approved indications.

Characteristics 
To improve clarity and readability changes have been made in Annex II D of the SmPC to align with the 
information in Annex 6 of the RMP.  
2.6.1.  Overall conclusion on the RMP 
The changes to the RMP and the changes to the conditions and obligations of the MA are acceptable. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated. 
Annex II conditions and Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
1.  In accordance with articles 59(3) and 61(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC, the MAH completed a full 
user test of the PL during the review of the initial Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for 
Enhertu in 2020 (EMEA/H/C/005124/0000). 
2.  Enhertu is prescribed by a physician and administered intravenously under the supervision of a 
healthcare professional at a hospital/clinic setting. The posology, administration and method of 
reconstitution for the extension of indication are unchanged. 
3.  The updates to the PL, including the safety sections, are not significant and utilise well recognised 
lay terms. Furthermore, the PL will be kept identical in format size, colours, layout/design as 
illustrated in the agreed mock-ups.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Enhertu as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced NSCLC whose 
tumours have an activating HER2 (ERBB2) mutation and who require systemic therapy following 
platinum-based chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy. 
The intended posology for this indication is 5.4 mg/kg and is based on preliminary results from phase II 
trial U206. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Treatment for advanced NSCLC is tailored according to the expression of PD-L1 by IHC or the presence of 
predictive genomic aberrations, e.g., EGFR/BRAF mutations, ALK/ROS1/RET rearrangements, METex14 
skipping or exon 20 insertions. HER2 mutations occur in ~3% of all lung cancers, and are predominantly 
observed in female patients, non-smokers, and patients with adenocarcinoma subtype. 
Considering its relative rarity, clinical experience in HER2-mutant NSCLC is limited and none of the HER2-
directed products has a specific indication approved for lung cancer in the EU, although several trials have 
shown a degree of antidisease activity.  
Docetaxel is the current standard-of-care in the 2L+ setting for most patients with advanced non-
oncogene-addicted NSCLC (pemetrexed and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 products can also be used if not used in first 
line), but it also constitutes an appropriate treatment in patients with oncogene-addicted disease for 
which targeted products are not approved/available. (L. E. Hendriks et al., 2023). 
Evidence of efficacy of anti-HER2 products in HER2-mutant NSCLC is limited and mainly consists of real-
world data and results from small retrospective cohorts. EUHER2 was a retrospective study (Mazieres et 
al, Ann Oncol 2016) which reported 44% ORR from conventional chemotherapy (n=93) and 51% from 
HER2-targeted therapies (among which trastuzumab, neratinib, afatinib, lapatinib, T-DM1)(n=65). T-DM1 
(Kadcyla®) showed 44% of responses in the HER2-mutant NSCLC cohort (n=18) from a basket trial (Li et 
al, JCO 2018). IFCT.1703 R2D2 (Mazieres et al, JCO 2022) reported 29% ORR from trastuzumab + 
pertuzumab + docetaxel in 45 patients. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The current application (T-DXd at 5.4 mg/kg Q3W) is based on preliminary results from phase II trial 
U206. Results from similar patient cohorts treated with T-DXd at 6.4 mg/kg from trials J101 and U204 
were submitted as supportive evidence of efficacy. 
Study U206 is an ongoing partially-blinded phase 2 study that randomised patients from the targeted 
population to T-DXd at 5.4 mg/kg or 6.4 mg/kg in a 2:1 ratio, hence uncontrolled (both patients and 
investigators were aware of treatment with T-DXd, the blinded portion was the dose). The study planned 
to randomise ~100 patients to the 5.4 mg/kg arm and ~50 to the 6.4 mg/kg arm. The primary objective 
was to evaluate confirmed ORR by BICR, and the key secondary objective was DOR. 
Enrolment for the pivotal trial Study U206 is currently completed.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
Results of the primary efficacy analyses based on database lock 23 December 2022 come from a dataset 
that includes a total of N=152 randomised patients (5.4 mg/kg n=102; 6.4 mg/kg n=50) with median 
follow-up of 11.6 months. 
•  Confirmed ORR as assessed by BICR was 49% (95% CI 39.0-59.1) in the T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg arm and 
56% (44.9, 62.6) in the 6.4 mg/kg arm.  
•  Median DoR was ~17 months for the 50 responders in the 5.4 mg/kg arm and it was not reached in 
the 6.4 mg/kg arm 
•  Response rates are overall similar in patients with/without baseline CNS metastases, prior or no prior 
anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and of asian/non-asian ethnicity. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The main limitation to the interpretation of efficacy results is the uncontrolled nature of trial U206. Since 
the provided dataset is not considered comprehensive. The MAH will submit the results of study DESTINY-
Lung04 by Q4 2025, as a new specific obligation to confirm the efficacy and safety of Enhertu in the 
intended indication (see section below on Additional Consideration on benefit-risk balance). 
The applied censoring rules for the DOR primary analysis resulted in an upward bias (overestimation) of 
the median DOR, and it is therefore considered more plausible than the median DOR is somewhere 
between 8 and 12 months, rather than the originally estimated 16.8 months. This uncertainty will be 
addressed by the results of the SOB.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Safety data have been provided for 1,741 subjects who received trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) ≥5.4 
mg/kg across eight clinical trials in various solid tumour types, of which 1,045 subjects received 5.4 
mg/kg, with a median exposure of 9.6 months, whereas for the 5.4 mg/kg safety dataset from U206 
(N=101) it is 7.7 months, corresponding to a medium number of cycles of 13 and 10, respectively.  
The safety pool in the current SmPC consists of N=1449 patients receiving 5.4 mg/kg including 404 
patients from trial U301 (patients metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer) in addition to the 5.4 mg/kg 
pool assessed in this procedure (N=1045). 
The adverse events were generally similar between study U206 (5.4 mg/kg) and the all tumours 5.4 
mg/kg pool.  
In study U206 (5.4 mg/kg) neutropenia was reported more frequently compared to the all tumours 5.4 
mg/kg pool (42.6% vs 35.2%).   
With the updated data for study U206 (5.4 mg/kg arm) the frequency of ILD (12.9%) is in line with the 
all tumours 5.4 mg/kg pool frequency (12.5%). For the HER2-mutated pool a higher frequency (27.0%) 
of ILD was seen with the dose of 6.4 mg/kg (N=152).  
The profile of LVEF decreases post-baseline was similar for study U206 (5.4 mg/kg) and the all tumours 
5.4 mg/kg pool.  
No new adverse events or AEs with a higher frequency were observed in the HER2-mutant NSCLC 
patients (5.4 mg/kg cohort, n=101) compared to the all tumours 5.4 mg/kg pool (N=1045). The most 
Assessment report

commonly reported ADRs were gastrointestinal (GI) or haematologic in nature, and in line with what is 
already described in the SmPC and known side effects of cytotoxic drugs such as topoisomerase 
inhibitors.  
The most common SAEs were dyspnoea, adjudicated drug-related ILD, malignant neoplasm progression, 
nausea, pleural effusion, pneumonitis, thrombocytopenia (grouped term), and troponin I increased 
(2.0%, each). 
In study U206 (5.4 mg/kg arm) the most common AEs associated with study drug discontinuation were 
adjudicated drug-related ILD (9.9%) Neutropenia (11.9%), and adjudicated drug-related ILD (5.0%) 
were the most common TEAEs leading to dose interruption whereas neutropenia (4%), decreased 
appetite, and fatigue were the most common TEAEs associated with dose reduction (3.0%, each). 
There were more ≥3 Grade TEAEs and SAEs in patients ≥65 years. 
Incidence and severity of AEs is considerably lower in lung cancer patients treated at 5.4 mg/kg as 
compared to those from the 6.4 mg/kg pools.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The size of the safety database in HER2-mutant NSCLC (n=101 on 5.4 mg/kg and n=152 on 6.4 mg/kg) 
is limited and the lack of a (SoC) control group, hampers the causality assessment and contextualization 
of the safety profile. The results of study DESTINY-Lung04 (SOB) will address these uncertainties.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Lung cancer with HER2 (ERBB2) mutation subtype is rare (~3% of all NSCLC), and mainly affects women 
and non-smokers. None of the targeted anti-HER2 products is approved for HER2-mutant NSCLC. 
Previous results from phase I trial J101 and phase II trial U204, in which T-DXd was evaluated at the 6.4 
mg/kg dose, already reported encouraging efficacy in heavily pretreated HER2-mutant NSCLC patients. 
The design of trial U206 accounted the paucity of data for the 5.4 mg/kg dose in these patients and 
randomised patients to both dose schemes. The primary endpoint for this single arm trial was ORR which 
show a treatment-related anti-tumour effect.  
In this heavily pre-treated population of patients with advanced HER2-mutant NSCLC (two thirds of them 
having received ≥2 lines of previous treatments), the reported ORR (49%) and median DoR (~17 
months) exceeds treatment effects previously seen in historical data from HER2-mutant NSCLC cohorts in 
the 2L setting (ORR 5-18%). Besides, while acknowledging the limitations of cross-study comparisons, 
the results appear comparable to those observed in previous applications for the treatment of advanced 
oncogene-addicted NSCLC in 2L (ORR 41-60%, median DoR 9-17.5 months). However, it is considered 
plausible that DOR results are overestimated, and it remains uncertain whether treatment effect in terms 
of ORR/DOR would reflect into long term benefit (PFS/OS) in this particular setting. Since the totality of 
presented data is not considered comprehensive for full approval of this extension of indication, the 
ongoing Study DESTINY-Lung04 in the first line setting has been requested as a new SOB in the context 
of the conditional marketing authorisation of Enhertu. 
Regarding safety, the data from Study U206 indicate that interstitial lung disease is of particular concern: 
although the frequency is in line with the larger safety pool, ILD presents a larger therapeutic problem in 
patients with lung cancer (as opposed to breast cancer, which represents the majority in the pool). This is 
reflected in the percentage of AEs leading to discontinuation (11.9 % vs 9.0%) as well as drug 
interruption in study U206 (5.4 mg/kg) compared to the one for the all tumour 5.4 mg/kg pool. 
Although the currently reported efficacy results seem to be overall comparable between the 5.4 mg/kg 
dose and the 6.4 mg/kg dose (noting numerically better results in the 6.4 mg/kg arm), T-DXd at 5.4 
mg/kg was less toxic and better tolerated than T-DXd at 6.4 mg/kg, supporting the currently intended 
(5.4 mg/kg Q3W) posology for marketing.

EMA/444980/2023 
Page 140/143 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Pivotal evidence to ascertain the benefit/risk balance for T-DXd in the targeted population comes from an 
uncontrolled efficacy dataset. Mature data from ORR and DOR for the intended posology for marketing 
(5.4 mg/kg Q3W) have been provided, but it is uncertain whether these data could reflect long term 
benefits in terms of PFS and OS. The study DESTINY-Lung04 will be submitted by Q4 2025 as a new SOB 
to confirm the efficacy and safety of Enhertu. 
The safety profile of T-DXd is non-negligible and ILD/pneumonitis remains an important safety concern. 
Most frequently occurring GI and haematological adverse events related to the MoA are reversible upon 
supportive management and/or dose modifications.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
Enhertu is currently authorised as a conditional marketing authorisation. The data supporting the 
extension of indication to advanced HER2-mutant NSCLC are not considered comprehensive, a conditional 
marketing authorisation is therefore also proposed for this new indication. 
Importantly, this extension of indication falls within the scope of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004 concerning conditional marketing authorisations, as it aims at the treatment of a seriously 
debilitating, life-threatening disease. Furthermore, the CHMP considers that the new indication for this 
product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing authorisation: 
•  The benefit-risk balance of T-DXd 5.4 mg/kg Q3W is positive, as the results from Study U206 outline 
promising response rates in patients with advanced HER2-mutant NSCLC. Responses seem durable 
and overall efficacy data is supported by results from the 6.4 mg/kg cohorts across trials U206, J101 
and U204. The safety profile of T-DXd is well-known and there does not seem to be any new adverse 
event with a clearly higher frequency or severity in patients with lung cancer.  
•  It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. Study DESTINY-Lung04 
(DL04) is a phase 3, open-label, randomised, controlled trial of T-DXd vs. standard-of-care 
immunochemotherapy in the first line treatment of patients with advanced HER2-mutant NSCLC. The 
study started in October 2021 and is close to finishing recruitment (252 subjects enrolled up to July 
2023, targeted sample size is ~264), and will provide interpretable results of time-to-event endpoints 
in an earlier setting for this biomarker-driven population. Study DL04 has been added as a new SOB 
with due date Q4 2025. 
•  T-DXd fulfills an unmet medical need for patients with advanced HER2-mutant NSCLC, since there are 
no approved HER2-targeted therapies in this setting, particularly after progression to first-line 
platinum-based chemotherapy. Currently approved treatment options in the second-line setting for 
NSCLC without actionable oncogenic driver mutations show response rates ranging from 5.5% to 
22.9%, and median DoR from 6.3 to 8.4 months. While the limitations related to indirect comparisons 
between studies are acknowledged, response rate in the current approved treatments are lower than 
that observed with T-DXd in the pivotal Study U206 (ORR 49% (95% CI 39.0-59.1. Moreover, 
providing a new treatment option with a new mechanism of action T-DXd is expected to bring relevant 
therapeutic advantage to patients.  
•  The benefits to public health of the immediate availability of T-DXd outweigh the risks inherent in the 
fact that additional data are still required. Patients with advanced NSCLC and activating HER2 
mutations have a dismal prognosis and will likely benefit from the availability of a HER2-targeted 
treatment.

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Enhertu for the intended treatment of advanced HER2-mutant NSCLC after progression 
to platinum-based chemotherapy +/- immunotherapy is positive, subject to the specific obligations and 
conditions imposed in order to obtain further clinical data to generate a comprehensive dataset. 
Consequently, the ongoing study DESTINY-Lung04, a phase III RCT of T-DXd versus standard-of-care 
immunochemotherapy in the 1L setting is imposed as a SOB in Annex II of the Opinion.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications   
Ozawade is indicated to improve wakefulness and reduce excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in adult 
patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) whose EDS has not been satisfactorily treated by, or 
who have not tolerated, OSA primary therapy, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).  
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated by a healthcare professional experienced in the treatment of OSA and 
cardiovascular risk. OSA disease should be annually reassessed. 
Ozawade is not a therapy for the underlying airway obstruction in patients with OSA. Primary OSA 
therapy should be maintained or periodically rechallenged in patients not tolerating primary OSA 
therapy. 
Posology 
Pitolisant should be used at the lowest effective dose, depending on individual patient response and 
tolerance, according to an up-titration scheme, without exceeding the dose of 18 mg/day: 
- 
- 
- 
Week 1: initial dose of 4.5 mg (one 4.5 mg tablet) per day. 
Week 2: the dose may be increased to 9 mg (two 4.5 mg tablets) per day. 
Week 3: the dose may be increased to 18 mg (one 18 mg tablet) per day or decreased to 4.5 mg 
(one 4.5 mg tablet) per day. 
2   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At any time the dose can be decreased (down to 4.5 mg per day) or increased (up to 18 mg per day) 
according to the physician assessment and the patient’s response. 
The total daily dose should be administered as a single dose in the morning during breakfast. 
Maintenance of efficacy 
As long-term efficacy data are limited (see section 5.1), the continued efficacy of treatment should be 
regularly evaluated by the physician. 
Special populations   
Elderly   
Limited data are available in elderly. Therefore, dosing should be adjusted according to their 
individual response and tolerance. 
Insomnia has been reported in higher rate in the elderly and dosing should be adjusted accordingly 
(see section 4.8). 
Renal impairment   
No dose adjustment is necessary. 
Hepatic impairment 
No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment. 
In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B), the titration period should be two 
weeks up-titration steps instead of one after initiation of treatment, due to expected longer half-life and 
higher exposure, and a dosage adjustment in patients with moderate hepatic impairment could 
eventually be considered depending on individual response and tolerance (see section 5.2). 
Pitolisant is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) (see section 
4.3).  
Paediatric population   
There is no relevant use of Ozawade in the paediatric population in Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA). 
CYP2D6 metabolizers phenotype (If known) 
By comparison to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, higher systemic exposure (up to 3 fold) is 
observed in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and lower exposure (by 0.8-fold) is observed in CYP2D6 
ultra-rapid metabolizers. No differences in systemic exposure is observed between CYP2D6 extensive 
and intermediate metabolizers.  
In the up-titration scheme, dose increment should take into account the higher exposure in CYP2D6 
poor metabolizers, and a dosage adjustment in patients with known poor CYP2D6 metabolizer 
genotype could be considered depending on individual response and tolerance (see section 5.2). 
Furthermore, no dose recommendation can currently be given for CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizers 
taking a CYP3A inducer, because the PK is currently unknown in this subpopulation. 
Method of administration 
For oral use. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). 
Breastfeeding (see section 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
3   
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Psychiatric disorders 
Pitolisant should be administered with caution in patients with history of psychiatric disorders such as 
severe anxiety or severe depression with suicidal ideation risk. Suicidal ideation has been reported in 
patients with psychiatric history treated with pitolisant. 
Hepatic impairment   
Pitolisant should be administered with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-
Pugh B) and dosing regimen should be adapted according to section 4.2. 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
Gastric disorders reactions have been reported with pitolisant, therefore it should be administered with 
caution in patients with acid related gastric disorders (see section 4.8) or when co-administered with 
gastric irritants such as corticosteroids or NSAID (see section 4.5). 
Nutrition disorders 
Pitolisant should be administered with caution in patients with severe obesity or severe anorexia (see 
section 4.8). In case of significant weight change, treatment should be re-evaluated by the physician.   
Cardiac disorders 
In two dedicated QT studies, supra-therapeutic doses of pitolisant (6-12-times the therapeutic dose, 
that is 108 mg to 216 mg) produced mild to moderate prolongation of QTc interval (10-13 ms). 
Patients with cardiac disease, hypertension, at risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), 
co-medicated with other QT-prolonging medicinal products or known to increase the risk of 
repolarization disorders, or co-medicated with medicinal products that significantly increase pitolisant 
Cmax and AUC ratio (see section 4.5) or patients with severe renal or moderate hepatic impairment (see 
section 4.4) should be carefully monitored (see section 4.5). 
Epilepsy 
Convulsions were reported at high doses in animal models (see section 5.3). In clinical studies, one 
epilepsy aggravation was reported in one epileptic patient. Caution should be taken for patients with 
severe epilepsy. 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment and at least up 
to 21 days after treatment discontinuation (based on pitolisant/metabolites half-life). Pitolisant may 
reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Therefore, an alternative method of effective 
contraception should be used if the woman patient is using hormonal contraceptives (see sections 4.5 
and 4.6). 
Drug-drug interactions 
The combination of pitolisant with substrates of CYP3A4 and having a narrow therapeutic margin 
should be avoided (see section 4.5). 
Drug abuse, rebound effect 
In a specific study, pitolisant showed no or very low signal suggestive of abuse at the current 
therapeutic dose of 36 mg and at doses up to 216 mg; consequently, potential for drug abuse or 
recreational drug with pitolisant is very low. 
4   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No rebound effect was reported during clinical studies. However, treatment discontinuation should be 
monitored. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Pharmacodynamic  interactions 
Antidepressants 
Tri or tetracyclic antidepressants with anti-histaminic H1-receptor properties (e.g. imipramine, 
clomipramine, mirtazapine) may impair the efficacy of pitolisant because they may decrease the effect 
of endogenous histamine released in brain by the treatment and alternative should be used. 
Anti-histamines 
Anti-histamines (H1-receptor antagonists) crossing the haemato-encephalic barrier (e.g. pheniramine 
maleate, chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine, promethazine, mepyramine, doxylamine) may impair 
the efficacy of pitolisant and alternative should be used. 
QT-prolonging substances or known to increase the risk of repolarization disorders (e.g. haloperidol, 
risperidone, erythromycine, clarithromycine, roxithromycine, loratadine, sildenafil) 
Combination with pitolisant should be made with a careful monitoring (see section 4.4).  
Pharmacokinetic  interactions 
In subjects that are CYP2D6  intermediate, extensive (normal) or ultra-rapid metabolizers, CYP2D6 is 
the main enzyme involved in the biotransformation of pitolisant, CYP3A is involved to a lesser extent. 
In subjects that are CYP2D6  poor metabolizers or are  CYP2D6 intermediate, extensive or ultra-rapid 
metabolizers  taking CYP3A  inducers, CYP3A  is  significantly involved  in  the biotransformation of 
pitolisant and CYP2D6 is involved to a lesser extent. 
CYP2D6 inhibitors   
Medicinal products affecting pitolisant metabolism 
- 
CYP2D6 inhibitors will most likely have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of pitolisant in subjects 
that are CYP2D6 intermediate, extensive metabolizers or ultra-rapid metabolizers and taking no 
CYP3A inducers, but not in subjects that are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers or intermediate, extensive 
metabolizers or CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizers and taking CYP3A inducers. A dosage adjustment 
during the combination could eventually be considered depending on individual response and 
tolerance.  
Co-administration of pitolisant with paroxetine significantly increases pitolisant mean Cmax and 
AUC0—72h ratio about 1.5 fold and 2 fold, respectively. Given the 2-fold increase of pitolisant 
exposure, its coadministration with CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g. paroxetine, fluoxetine, venlafaxine, 
duloxetine, bupropion, quinidine, terbinafine, cinacalcet) should be done with caution.  
Enzyme inducers 
- 
CYP3A inducers will most likely have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of pitolisant in CYP2D6 
poor metabolizers and CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizers and their effect in these populations is 
currently unknown. A clinical monitoring should be made when both active substances are combined 
and, eventually a dosage adjustment during the combination and one week after the inducer treatment. 
Co-administration of pitolisant with rifampicin in multiple doses significantly decreases pitolisant 
mean Cmax and AUC ratio about 0.6 fold and 0.5 fold, respectively. Therefore, co-administration of 
pitolisant with potent CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin) 
should be done with caution. With St John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum), due to its strong CYP3A4 
inducing effect, caution should be exercised when taken concurrently with pitolisant. 
5   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CYP3A4 inhibitors 
- 
CYP3A inhibitors will most likely have an effect on the pharmacokinetic of pitolisant in CYP2D6 
poor metabolizers and their effect in this population is currently unknown. 
The combination of pitolisant with grapefruit juice and itraconazole was evaluated in healthy 
volunteers. No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction was evidenced with any of 
these combinations. However, based on the biotransformation pathway caution should be exercised in 
subjects that are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers due to a significant decrease in clearance and an increase 
in exposure. 
Other 
- 
In a clinical multiple dose study, the combination of pitolisant with probenecid decreases the AUC of 
pitolisant by about 0.7 fold. The underlying mechanism is unknown. A dosage adjustment during the 
combination could eventually be considered depending on individual response and tolerance. 
CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 substrates  
Medicinal products that pitolisant may affect metabolism  
- 
A clinical induction study showed that pitolisant is a weak inducer of CYP3A (0.2-fold reduction in 
midazolam exposure). Therefore, the combination of pitolisant with substrates of CYP3A4 and having 
a narrow therapeutic margin (e.g. immunosuppressants, docetaxel, kinase inhibitors, cisapride, 
pimozide, halofantrine) should be avoided (see section 4.4). With other CYP3A4, CYP2C (e.g. 
repaglinide, phenytoin, warfarin), P-gp (e.g. dabigatran, digoxin) and UGT (e.g. morphine, 
paracetamol, irinotecan) substrates, caution should be made with a clinical monitoring of their 
efficacy. 
Pitolisant might decrease the exposure to oral contraceptives and an additional further reliable 
contraceptive method should be used (see section 4.6).  
Substrates of OCT1   
- 
Pitolisant may be a clinically relevant inhibitor of OCT1 based on in vitro data and a clinically 
relevant interaction may occur with substrates of OCT1 (e.g. metformin). 
Even if the clinical relevance of this effect is not established, caution is advised when pitolisant is 
administered with a substrate of OCT1 (e.g. metformin (biguanides)) (see section 5.2). 
Other 
- 
The combination of pitolisant with modafinil or sodium oxybate was evaluated in healthy volunteers, 
at therapeutic doses. No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction was evidenced 
either with modafinil or with sodium oxybate and no dose adjustment is necessary when pitolisant is 
co-administered with those current treatments of OSA symptoms. 
Pitolisant decreases the olanzapine exposure by 0.3 fold.  
Paediatric population   
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment and at least up 
to 21 days after treatment discontinuation (based on pitolisant/metabolites half-life). 
Pitolisant/metabolites may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Therefore, an 
alternative method of effective contraception should be used if the woman is using hormonal 
contraceptives (see section 4.5). 
Pregnancy 
6   
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of pitolisant in pregnant women. Studies in 
animals have shown reproductive toxicity, including teratogenicity. In rats, pitolisant/metabolites were 
shown to cross the placenta (see section 5.3).  
Pitolisant should not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk 
for foetus.  
Breast-feeding 
Animal study has shown excretion of pitolisant/metabolites in milk. Therefore, breastfeeding is 
contraindicated during treatment with pitolisant (see section 4.3). 
Fertility 
Study in animals has shown effects on semen parameters, without a significant impact on reproductive 
performance in males and reduction on the percentage of live foetuses in treated females (see section 
5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Pitolisant has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Patients with abnormal levels of sleepiness who take pitolisant should be advised that their level of 
wakefulness may not return to normal. Patients with excessive daytime sleepiness, including those 
taking pitolisant should be frequently reassessed for their degree of sleepiness and, if appropriate, 
advised to avoid driving or any other potentially dangerous activity. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequent adverse reactions are headache 12.4%, insomnia (all types) 8.9%, nausea 3.3%,

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Headache and insomnia   
During clinical studies in OSA indication, episodes of headache and insomnia have been reported 
(12.4 % and 8.9%) more frequently in women (headache and insomnia) and in elderly (insomnia) 
patients. Most of these adverse reactions were mild to moderate (see section 4.2). Dosing should be 
adjusted accordingly. 
Gastric disorders 
Gastric disorders presumably caused by hyperacidity have been reported during clinical studies in 
3.5% of the patients receiving pitolisant. Higher rates of nausea are reported in women. These effects 
were mostly mild to moderate. If they persist, a corrective treatment with proton pump inhibitor could 
be initiated. 
Patients with low/normal Body Mass Index (BMI) (<25) 
Headache, insomnia, nausea and anxiety have been reported in higher rates in patients with 
low/normal BMI. Dosing should be adjusted accordingly. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms 
Symptoms of pitolisant overdose may include headache, insomnia, irritability, nausea and abdominal 
pain. 
Management 
In case of overdose, hospitalisation and monitoring of the vital functions are recommended. There is 
no clearly identified antidote.

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other nervous system drugs, ATC code: N07XX11. 
Mechanism of action 
Pitolisant is an orally active histamine H3-receptor antagonist/inverse agonist which, via its blockade 
of histamine auto-receptors enhances the activity of brain histaminergic neurons, a major arousal 
system with widespread projections to the whole brain. Pitolisant also modulates various 
neurotransmitter systems, increasing acetylcholine, noradrenaline and dopamine release in the brain.  
Clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of pitolisant in the treatment of Excessive Daytime Sleepiness (EDS) in patients with 
Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) has been studied in two pivotal clinical studies: HAROSA I and 
HAROSA II. 
HAROSA I studied the efficacy and safety of pitolisant in the treatment of EDS in patients with 
Obstructive Sleep Apnoea syndrome (OSA), and treated by Continuous Positive Airway Pressure 
(CPAP), but still complaining of EDS. This was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind 
study of pitolisant versus placebo, 12-week double-blind phase. 244 patients were analyzed (183 
pitolisant, 61 placebo), 83% male, average of 53 years old, 12% over 65 years. Patients had EDS (an 
Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS] score greater than or equal to 12) and were submitted to nCPAP 
therapy for a minimum period of 3 months and still complaining of EDS despite the efforts made 
beforehand to obtain an efficient nCPAP.  
The primary efficacy variable was the change in Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) Score between 
baseline and end of treatment. During the double-blind phase, the maximum dose prescribed was 18 
mg for 79.8% of the patient in the active treatment group and for 88.5% of the patients in the placebo 
group. The maximum dose is reached after a three-week titration, starting with 4.5 mg. 
After 12 weeks DB treatment, a significant improvement of the ESS was reported with pitolisant 
compared to placebo (table 1).

Double-Blind Phase - ITT Population (N=244) 
HAROSA II studied the efficacy and safety of pitolisant in the treatment of EDS in patients with 
Obstructive Sleep Apnoea syndrome (OSA) refusing the Continuous Positive Airway Pressure 
(CPAP) therapy. This was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study of pitolisant 
versus placebo, 12-week double-blind phase followed by a 40-week open-label extension phase. 268 
patients were analyzed (201 pitolisant, 67 placebo), 75% male, average of 52 years, 12% over 65 
years. Patients had an Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS] score greater than or equal to 12 and were 
refusing to be treated by nCPAP therapy, and still complaining of EDS.  
The primary efficacy variable was the change in Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score between 
baseline and end of treatment. During the double-blind phase, the maximum dose prescribed was 18 
mg for 82.5% of the patient in the active treatment group and for 86.6% of the patients in the placebo 
group. 
After 12 weeks DB treatment, a significant improvement of the ESS was reported with pitolisant 
compared to placebo (ANCOVA model adjusting for ESS and BMI at V2 and study center as random 
effect) (Table 2).

Open-label data 
Patients who participated in the double-blind 12 weeks period of HAROSA I and HAROSA II studies, 
could participate in the 40 week open-label phase. The primary objective of the open-label phase was 
long-term safety and effectiveness of pitolisant up to 18 mg/day. Maintenance of effect of pitolisant in 
EDS in OSA patients has not been established in blinded, placebo-controlled studies. In HAROSA I, 
1.5% of patients discontinued study participation during the open-label phase, due to lack of efficacy 
and 4.0% due to adverse events. In HAROSA II, 1.3% of patients discontinued study participation 
during the open-label phase due to lack of efficacy and 2.5% due to adverse events. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Ozawade in all subsets of the paediatric population in Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) (see section 
4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic  properties 
12    
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
The exposure to pitolisant in healthy volunteers was assessed in studies involving more than 200 
subjects that received doses of pitolisant in single administration up to 216 mg and for a duration up to 
28 days. 
Absorption 
Pitolisant is well and rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentration reached approximately three 
hours after administration. The steady-state (geometric mean, CV%) Cmax  and AUC of the therapeutic 
dose (18 mg) is 35.5 ng/mL (59.2%) and 378 ng x h/mL (86.3%), respectively. 
Upon repeated administrations, the steady state is achieved after 5-6 days of administration leading to 
an increased serum level around 2-fold. Inter individual variability is rather high (Geom CV% of 59.2 
and 86.3 for Cmax and AUC0-24h respectively), some volunteers showing outlier high profile (without 
tolerance issues). 
The pharmacokinetics of pitolisant is not influenced by concomitant food intake. 
Distribution 
Pitolisant exhibits high serum protein binding (91.4-95.2%) and demonstrates approximately equal 
distribution between red blood cells and plasma. 
Pitolisant is widely distributed with an apparent volume of distribution of 5-10 L/kg. 
Biotransformation 
The metabolism of pitolisant in humans is well characterized and represents the major route of 
elimination. The major non-conjugated metabolites are cleaved forms of pitolisant leading to inactive 
major carboxylic acid metabolites, three of which being major and in a lesser extent five 
hydroxylated/N-oxide derivatives in several positions found in urine and serum. By combining the 
contribution of enzyme determined in vitro with the exposure of the main metabolites identified in the 
mass balance study, the estimated overall contribution of CYP enzymes in pitolisant metabolism is of 
60% for CYP2D6 and of ~ 30% for CYP3A4/3A5  when CYP2D6 phenotype is extensive metabolizer. 
Several conjugated metabolites were identified, the major ones (inactive) being two glycine conjugates 
of carboxylic acid metabolites of pitolisant and a glucuronide of a ketone metabolite of monohydroxy 
desaturated pitolisant. 
Inhibition/Induction  
On liver microsomes, pitolisant and its major metabolites do not significantly inhibit the activities of 
the cytochromes CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2C8, CYP2B6, CYP2E1 or CYP3A4 and of 
uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferases isoforms UGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9 and 
UGT2B7 up to the concentration of 13.3 µM, a level considerably higher than the levels achieved with 
therapeutic dose. Pitolisant is an inhibitor of CYP2D6 with moderate potency (IC50 = 2.6 µM).  
Based on in vitro data, pitolisant and its main metabolites may induce CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 at 
therapeutic concentrations and by extrapolation, CYP2C, UGTs and P-gp. A clinical study was 
conducted to assess the effect of pitolisant on CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 using midazolam and bupropion 
as a CYP3A4 and a CYP2B6 model substrate, respectively. Pitolisant does not affect the 
pharmacokinetic of bupropion and consequently is not a CYP2B6 or a CYP1A2 inducer and should be 
considered a borderline/weak inducer at clinically relevant concentrations. 
In vitro studies indicate that pitolisant is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of human P-glycoprotein 
and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Pitolisant is not a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3. 
Pitolisant is not a significant inhibitor of OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE1, or 
MATE2K at the tested concentration. Pitolisant shows greater than 50% inhibition towards OCT1 
(organic cation transporters 1) at 1.33 µM, the extrapolated IC50 of pitolisant is 0.795 µM (see section 
4.5). 
Elimination 
Pitolisant has a plasma half-life of 10-12 hours. The elimination is mainly achieved via urine 
(approximately 90%) through pharmacologically inactive non conjugated and glycine and glucuronide 
conjugated metabolites. A small fraction (2.3%) was recovered in faeces. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
13    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A cross-study assessment of single-dose data shows that pitolisant exposures increase proportionally 
with doses between 18 and 216 mg pitolisant but slightly more than dose-proportionally over the 
clinical dose range of 4.5 to 18 mg. 
Special populations 
There are unlikely to be any clinically relevant differences in the PK of pitolisant due to sex. 
Pitolisant has not been studied in obese population with BMI >40 kg/m2. 
Elderly 
In 68 to 80 years old healthy volunteers the pharmacokinetics of pitolisant is not different compared to 
younger patients (18 to 45 years of age). Above 80 years old, kinetics show a slight variation without 
clinical relevance. Limited data are available in elderly. Therefore, dosing should be adjusted 
according to their hepatic status (see section 4.2 and 4.4). 
Renal impairment 
In patients with impaired renal function (stages 2 to 4 according to the international classification of 
chronic kidney disease, i.e. creatinine clearance between 15 and 89 ml/min), Cmax and AUC tended to 
be increased by a factor of 2.5 (see section 4.2). The underlying mechanism is unknown. 
Hepatic impairment 
In patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A), AUC increased by a factor 1.4 while Cmax 
remained unchanged, compared with normal healthy volunteers.  
In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B), AUC increased by a factor 2.4, while 
Cmax remained unchanged (see section 4.2). Pitolisant pharmacokinetics after repeated administration 
in patients with hepatic impairment has not been evaluated yet. 
Race 
All studies have been performed mainly in Caucasians (Caucasians = 270; Black = 38; Asian = 20; 
Other = 3). Based on the data provided by the Applicant, the exposure appears to be similar between 
the different races. 
CYP2D6 phenotypes and CYP3A polymorphism 
The exposure to pitolisant was higher in the CYP2D6 poor metabolizers after a single dose and at 
steady state; Cmax and AUC(0-tau) was approximately 2.7-fold and 3.2-fold greater on Day 1 and 2.1-
fold and 2.4-fold on Day 7. The serum pitolisant half-life was longer in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers 
compared to the extensive metabolizers. 
In subjects that are CYP2D6 intermediate, extensive (normal) or ultra-rapid metabolizers, CYP2D6 is 
the main enzyme involved in the biotransformation of pitolisant, CYP3A is involved to a lesser extent. 
CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 genetic polymorphisms are unlikely to have significant effect on the 
pharmacokinetic of pitolisant.  
In these subjects, CYP2D6 inhibitors will have an effect on the pharmacokinetic of pitolisant, not 
CYP3A inhibitors. In subjects that are CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizers, CYP3A inducers may lead 
to an even more rapid elimination of pitolisant and lower exposures compared to the other subgroups. 
This may result in exposures below therapeutic concentrations. 
In subjects that are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers or are CYP2D6 intermediate, extensive or ultra-rapid 
metabolizers taking CYP3A inducers, CYP3A is significantly involved in the biotransformation of 
pitolisant and CYP2D6 is involved to a lesser extent. Only under these conditions, genetic 
polymorphisms in CYP3A4 and 3A5 may have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetic of 
pitolisant.  
In subjects that are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, CYP3A inhibitors and inducers will have an effect on 
the pharmacokinetic of pitolisant and CYP2D6 inhibitors to a much lesser extent. In subjects that are 
CYP2D6 intermediate, extensive or ultra-rapid metabolizers taking a CYP3A inducer, a CYP3A 
inhibitor will lead to a decrease in the contribution of CYP3A to the overall metabolism. However, the 
exposure is most likely similar to that in subjects that are not taking a CYP3A inducer. Thus, in this 
subpopulation, CYP3A inhibition is unlikely to affect the pharmacokinetic of pitolisant.

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In rats, transient reversible convulsive episodes occurred at Tmax , that may be attributable to a 
metabolite abundant in this species but not in humans. In monkeys, at the highest doses, transient CNS 
related clinical signs including emesis, tremors and convulsions were reported. At the highest doses, 
rats presented some limited histopathological changes in some organs (liver, duodenum, thymus, 
adrenal gland and lung). 
Pitolisant blocked hERG channel with an IC50 exceeding therapeutic concentrations and induced a 
slight QTc prolongation in dogs. 
In preclinical studies, drug dependence and drug abuse liability studies were conducted in mice, rats 
and monkeys. However, no definitive conclusion could be drawn on tolerance, dependence and self-
administration studies. 
Pitolisant was neither genotoxic nor carcinogenic. 
Teratogenic effect of pitolisant was observed at maternally toxic doses (teratogenicity safety margins 
7.3 and 2.6 in rats and in rabbits, respectively). At high doses, pitolisant induced sperm morphology 
abnormalities and decreased motility without any significant effect on fertility indexes in male rats and 
it decreased the percentage of live conceptuses and increased post-implantation loss in female rats 
(safety margin of 2.3). It caused a delay in post-natal development (safety margin of 2.3). 
Pitolisant/metabolites were shown to cross the placenta barrier and secreted in breast milk in animals. 
Juvenile toxicity studies 
Juvenile toxicity studies in rats revealed that the administration of pitolisant at high doses induced a 
dose related mortality and convulsive episode that may be attributable to a metabolite abundant in rats 
but not in humans.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Ozawade is and what it is used for 
Ozawade is a medicine that contains the active substance pitolisant.  
Ozawade is used in adults with obstructive sleep apnoea to treat excessive daytime sleepiness. It is 
used when sleepiness occurs despite treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or in 
patients who have not tolerated CPAP. 
Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a condition that causes you to stop breathing for at least 10 seconds 
during sleep. This can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness and a tendency to suddenly fall asleep in 
inappropriate situations (sleep attacks). 
The active substance, pitolisant, works on receptors (targets) on cells in the brain that are involved in 
stimulating alertness. This effect helps to reduce daytime sleepiness and tiredness. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Ozawade 
Do not take Ozawade if you   
- 
- 
- 
Are allergic to pitolisant or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Have severe liver problems, as pitolisant is normally broken down in the liver and high levels 
may build up in patients whose liver function is severely reduced. 
Are breastfeeding. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Ozawade if any of the following apply to you: 
- 
- 
- 
You have ever had anxiety or depression with suicidal thoughts. 
You have liver problems, as your dose may need to be adjusted. 
You have a gastric ulcer or you take medicines that can irritate your stomach such as medicines 
to reduce inflammation, since gastric reactions can occur with Ozawade. 
28   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
You are very overweight or underweight, as your weight may increase or decrease while you 
are taking Ozawade. 
You have heart problems. Your doctor will need to check this regularly while you are taking 
Ozawade. 
You have severe epilepsy. 
If any of these apply to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Ozawade. 
Ozawade does not replace your OSA primary treatment such as CPAP. You should continue to use 
such treatment as well as Ozawade. 
Children and adolescents 
Ozawade should not be taken by children or adolescents. 
Other medicines and Ozawade 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Ozawade can affect the way other medicines work and other medicines can affect the way 
Ozawade works. Your doctor may need to adjust your doses. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines:  
- 
antidepressant medicines such as clomipramine, duloxetine, fluoxetine, imipramine, mirtazapine, 
paroxetine and venlafaxine 
bupropion, used either as an antidepressant or an aid to help stop smoking

- 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or you are planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Pregnancy 
You should not take Ozawade during pregnancy unless you and your doctor decide that you need to 
take it. There is not enough information on the risk of taking Ozawade during pregnancy. If you are a 
29    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
woman, you have to use effective birth control during your treatment with Ozawade and for at least 21 
days after stopping treatment. As Ozawade may reduce the effectiveness of a hormonal contraceptive 
(birth control medicine), an alternative method of effective contraception has to be used. 
Breast-feeding 
You must stop breastfeeding when you start taking Ozawade. Ozawade passes into milk in animals. 
Driving and using machines 
You may feel sleepy or your ability to concentrate may be impaired. Take care with activities that 
require attention such as driving a car and handling machinery. Talk to your doctor or your pharmacist 
if you are unsure about how your condition affects your ability to drive. 
3. 
How to take Ozawade 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Treatment is normally started with a dose of 4.5 mg once per day, and gradually increased over three 
weeks to the most appropriate dose. At any time, your doctor can increase or decrease your dose 
depending on how well the medicine works for you and how well you tolerate it. The maximum daily 
dose is 18 mg. 
It might take a few days before you feel the medicine starting to work and you may usually feel the 
maximum benefit after a few weeks. 
Do not change the Ozawade dose on your own. Any change in dosage must be prescribed and 
monitored by your doctor. 
For a dose of 4.5 mg, take one 4.5-mg tablet. 
For a dose of 9 mg, take two 4.5-mg tablets. 
For a dose of 18 mg, take one 18-mg tablet. 
Take Ozawade once a day by mouth, in the morning with your breakfast. 
Do not take a dose of Ozawade in the afternoon since you may have difficulty sleeping. 
If you take more Ozawade than you should 
If you take too many tablets of Ozawade, contact your nearest hospital casualty department or tell 
your doctor or pharmacist immediately. You may experience headaches, stomach pain or feel sick or 
irritable. You may also have difficulty sleeping. Take this leaflet and any remaining tablets with you. 
If you forget to take Ozawade 
If you forget to take your medicine, take the next dose at the usual time, do not take a double dose to 
make up for the forgotten one. 
If you stop taking Ozawade 
You should continue to take Ozawade for as long as instructed by your doctor. Do not stop taking 
Ozawade suddenly on your own. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
